I was about to tag you...on your own comment lmao

---
Every month its something new with this game
---
Except its within the last 30 days.  So has he put in enough time within 30 daya to collect that much of RARE items.  Super stims, magazines. Bobbleheads.
---

---
Although i will concede the mule theory as a possibility.  
---
How much for furious 50 cal
---
If I see someone my level with a workshop I will contest it. I leave low levels alone tho
---
Did you message me on xbox? 
---
You seem fun. 
---
I just started playing yesterday. I'm level 5. I didnt know a thing about this whole "controversy" until some 5 minutes ago when I came here to read up on the game. Fortunately yesterday when I played for the first time no one was on the server with me.
---
If someone approached me though and offered some sweet swag i would have taken it without a second thought and built a monument to them when i was eventually able to set up C.A.M.P.
---
It's perfectly within the realm of reason for someone to have something duped and not even know it.
---
It say 100k of rare game items... 
---
that's what I'm telling myself, but we don't know how long, do we?
---
No wasn't me 
---
flatwoods monster my dude
---
I think the queen has always had the ability to drop serum recipes, its just been impossibly rare that she actually does.
---
Thank you appreciate it! I don’t know what to tell you man just the way things go I guess
---
Taking offers. Sorry someone just messaged me about that on xbox.

---
Denial is the first step, stop defending this trash game maintained by trash devs 
---
I was given a full set of sent armor but very rarely pvp. I use it for the people that decide to try and start stuff against me and give them a surprise with my AAE lever action 
---
It seems like bans went out unexpectedly over the weekend and they corrected the email issue today in the office.  Lies or not, there are plenty of people on here that seemed to have been banned unexpectedly, and I can't believe they are all lying.
---
If OP's account gets unsuspended or at least looked at does that mean the rest of us will be able to repeal these suspensions? 
---
No disrespect to OP but if you're looking into his ticket than does that mean are people from bethesda looking into this or at least other people's ticket? It says in the email there's no chance to repeal but that doesn't seem to be the case here. 
---
Are these bans open to discussion or is it final like the email states?
---
It's a sad truth, because Fallout is my favourite videogame world and I hate what Bethesda have done to its once well regarded reputation (and their own).
---
However, I'd be lying if I said the catharsis from this tatters of a game being torn to shreds hasn't been the equivalent of getting like super high.
---
Deathclaw farming or the cap run ones if I had to guess. 
---
What I'm saying is if you did some of those multiple times in a week or so  you might have had a large quantity of items or caps pass thru your character.
---
Keep telling yourself that. Fo76 is dying.
---
so you were duping but not duping and therefore shouldn't be banned. Sorry, but the game is better without you. Addition through subtraction. If they keep banning you clowns, I may even give them some more money. 
---
It is easy to one-bonk people when using melee.
---
750
---
Be careful the white knights will tell you that you should have walked everywhere, the fact that you sprinted for an hour is an exploit and doing any exploit unintentionally or not is grounds for a ban
---
I'll believe it when I see it. Do you really believe Bethesda will just "correct" another fuckup like this?
---
Medically I've taken a break, been having nerve issues with on and off loss of control of my hands/limbs. Silver lining is that I might still be able to play FO76 when I am more capable!
---
I Q&amp;Aed a bunch of people candidly, I feel confident this suggested method was deployed.
---
A problem shouldn't have to go viral for Bethesda to respond.
---
Oh Jesus so when I used the word him or he it was a generalization not anything related to sex. Please don’t associate my poor attempt at showing duality in regards to support in this thread and doing a 180 in other threads just because this one poster is a girl. I didn’t even realize this poster was a girl until after I read your comment.
---
I LOVE THIS
---
Well, then for one glorious moment, RNGesus has smiled upon my sorry ass!
---
Think it is common. I’ve had it on my list for a while. I usually wear the clown costume and have killed a few, but you must have to have the hat to complete it. 
---
I love my Excavator , but I ground out violet flux to give my T60 calibrated shocks.
---
I still just use the Ex, because its 440 and the T60 w/shocks is 340 and I can't get by without that extra 100 lb!
---
 Fuck. Level 50 is max level. Sure you get perks galore but the weapons and armor are done. New player ... no.
---
If you're crafting .50 or 5mm it is easy to get 10000 in a day, though you'll burn through it just as fast in a day.
---

Suuuure buddy. Suuure.

Bugthesda paying influencers now, r i p

Docking computer ftw, small ships are easy to dock, anacondas for some are not, a docking computer makes it cake walk especially now that the bugs with the docking computer are gone.
---
I only wanted it since I'm a level 30 with not the biggest group of friends (1-2 friends) so to me it would've been useful

You are 100% correct, every one sees a sexy girl and just tries to comfort them lol

Bullshit.

I had a feeling just wanted to make sure there's not something else I needed to chase, I'm gonna go look for him I'm intrigued, thanks man.
---
LOL I woulda baited him into a message war while launching a nuke at the factory.
---
where did he send a message?..im on ps4 and using the chat is a PIA
---
well some random person on the internet said it so it must be true.
---
wait a minute how can it be dead its supposed to go f2p
---
wait a minute how can it go f2p it was supposed to get loot boxes
---
wait a minute its almost like random people on the internet dont know shit....
---
I’ve got most of ones I like, but I wouldn’t mind a few more!
---
Why does anybody even play this game still.
---
I can't say that I'm surprised. BSG is just plain incompetent.
---
Doesn’t work here I still have support tickets from a few weeks after the game launched that are just sitting ignored 
---
Wasn’t the duping fixed 2 updates ago? The hotfix was supposed to fix the previous update that said ended duping but really opened it back up. And then this one was supposed to I guess fix it but also said it was to take away items that you had too many of if questionable like junk and ammo And ban accounts with multiple weapons and guns of the same thing. I have friends that had some stuff taken out but could still play and then got banned. 
---
I might have had over 100k in ammo that was probably duped but I got it before the last 30 days and dropped most of it before the update because I was worried it was going to been seen as questionable. I haven’t gotten a reply for why yet. But I bet it’s for something I know is bullshit or for 1million flamer fuel lol 
---
Yeah, the bad thing about PvP in this game is that the suspicion holds you back.  If they want to work in teams, that's fine.  If you want to have a battle, that's fun.  But when there are certain builds that make you pretty damn immune to everything, that's not a "Raider looking for a fight."  That's a griefer acting in bad faith and, unfortunately, they hold all the cards because they can simply disconnect.
---
I'd hate to hear snot ears effect on audio
---
ive never seen it in game so im jelly
---
How come they level up if they don’t achieve anything in the game (and what’s the bloody point ?)
---
Theres an update scheduled for Feb 19th on Bethesda website. So let's hope that's the update in the email..
---
I see your point but no where near enough items would be generated by farming a deathclaw, I haven’t done them in months also, I’ve seen some people talk about the caps (when buying and selling items) passing through your inventory is the problem.
---
I dont know man I’ve never duped , and farming locations surely is not grounds for a ban
---
We should all switch to melee builds, because apparently crafting a lot of ammo is a sin around here...
---
I would bet money this is the explanation. 
---
Sure. 
---
Warframe is a great game, subreddit is super active if yuou have questions.
---
I know I wasn't attacking you personally, just stating an observation on what usually is the case.
---
Lol jelly fingers would be rhe cause of many rages
---
Quality post. One downvote from me. Excellent job!
---
You just made the most incoherent comment I have ever read. Are you saying it's going F2P and that there is going to be loot boxes, or are you poking fun at the people who said those things? Either way, your comment doesn't make sense. How would the game going F2P (obv it isn't) mean it **isn't** dead??
---
I completed it once but the next time I logged in it started again
---
I know, I'm shocked by all the support I'm receiving here, no one knows me, but I'm still trying to get help, and everyone supporting me gives me hope
---
I wasn't hunting them, just if I came across someone duping I'd mess with them. Like I said in the OP, never kept anything but some stable flux to make my DB prime. But I guess those few minutes are all it takes to flag. I'm just surprised because I know the last time I stole from a bag was over 30 days ago on Jan 10th. I haven't even played the game since RE:2 came out.
---
r/Market76
---
haha like in RDR? after failing so many times u can skip to the next chapter..BTW..i was just saying this the other day..i HATE the watoga area..im done with that place
---
Yeah using a minigun or gatling gun start to finish when launching a nuke on the queen is an easy 1500-2000 rounds. I buy bulk lead, steel and acid and using super duper perk will make like 10k rounds every couple days. 100k of these in 30 days is easily done. and the ( rare ) being ultracite ammo which i do make  and use on queen fights is pretty easy to hit that 100k in 30 days.. good grief they really are pissing off the player base. have almost 1000 hours in the game and i farm my materials and did stash it on my alt character just because you cant hold enough materials to supply / fix and feed your main character in game on a daily basis if you play long hours. 
---
How much for the tse gauss?
---
Had a guy bait my group into a fight by holding a high bounty. They had 2 guys waiting to hit us once we killed him. Mind you he had no caps so we didn't get anything for the bounty but his 2 buddies gave us a fair amount.  One of them had similar gear to mine but my AAE got us the win. I wonder how many people fell for there trap befor we did lol
---
Wait what? You got banned for trading??
---
Huh the only thing I could see is you seem to trade a lot for bobbleheads? Which is not wrong nor a ban worthy offense. Have you ever traded with a duper? Have you accidently gotten a boat load of them just to give them back? Or.... They may be doing guilt by association on this? Let me know I've been trying to make sense of all the bans. 
---
Except for that I haven't seen it again and now I've got to look for him curiosity got the best of me right now lol.
---
thx a lot! much love
---
Yah, trying to do the BOS missions with the radio signal
---
I also want mutations to affect your appearance. Got Marsupial? Your legs are now reverse jointed. Got Egg Head? Your head is now 50% larger. Got Scaly Skin? Talons? Eagle Eyes? Reflect that. I would look like a freak of nature with Bird Bones, Eagle Eyes, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Healing Factor, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Talons, and Twisted Muscles.
---
Incidentally, why can you be Electrically Charged *and* Grounded?
---
thanks a lot! ill try all of these. much love
---
Well, they do affect your stats in ways. Rattle hands does affect your ability to aim in vats by affecting your perception(?). Other diseases affect stats similarly, but yeah, it's not quite as immersive as what you suggest, but they didn't not try at all. 
---
What about players who innocently accepted/picked up gear not knowing it was duped?
---
And how do you prove that someone did it intentionally or unintentionally?
---
Or do you just drop a ban-Nuke? 
---
you dont find it. it finds you.
---
That blows sorry to hear that. Hopefully you get this fixed good luck mate.
---
your read comprehension sucks.
---
poking fun at the other bullshit claims people have made. they claimed it was going f2p (false) the claimed it was going to get loot boxes (false) its almost like random people on the internet don't know shit.
---
Haha nice! You gonna be playing tonight brother?
---
I'm sorry it happened as well, thanks for commiserating  with me and I wish you luck as well :D
---
You can't pirate a game that relies on server instructions to operate.  And is shady a proper noun now?
---
just complete the quest "Mayor for a day" all bots will stop attacking you unless you attack them.. they will still accidentally hit you while shooting at the BOS vendor... 
---
I wonder that as well, but I shouldn't be banned for having a duped item, there is no way for me to know something was duped, but who knows with bethesda
---
I don't know how they level up. I just watched them doing the same movement over and over and level up. It is a really rare case that I had only seen it once. Thats why I reported and made this post. Which is to if anyone else know what is happening
---
lol come on, you don't actually think it's ammo.
---
Hmmm people want to play fo76 even after having been banned. It makes me wonder if fo76 is a great game which wants to be fair to all of it's fan or fo76 wants to take the money and run.

Wowowowwowowow just saw your post yesterday and really considered getting back into FO76 because of it. So much that I saved your post for the handy information but looks like I’m gonna stay away for awhile longer.. after all the effort you put into that I really hope they resolve this for you.

---
Wait - Are we not allowed to have mules for our own stuff we've collected?
---
I hope the temporary suspension is over asap, but it still feels like a black mark against me

Just sold that sorry

They've done it with MMORPGs I'm sure if the desire was there they could do it with this.

Keywords "if the desire was there"

Your poor grammar and lack of punctuation make it difficult to be read as sarcasm. You can't hear how someone is talking through reading text, that's why we use punctuation to punctuate an underlying meaning in text. I wasn't taught to comprehend idiots, unfortunately.

---
People found loot boxes in the source code of the game. Of course that didn't mean they would add them for sure, but they were there and that is what was being discussed.
---
Auto stim power armor chest, 400 (d)stimpacks, I hope you like .38 rounds.
---
it is unacceptable, but I know that mistakes can happen, I just want them to make it right
---
I guess I’m just lucky? Level 61 and almost 100 hours and never once had someone attack my camp or workshop 
---
he is a liar
---
Yes thought  the code of the universe
---
&gt;   This isn't some egalitarian or utopia n society where everyone waits their turn to get a hit  
---
Well, Bethesda apparently seems to think that it is. Why do you  think enemies are bullet sponges?  Why did they nerf TSE? Because Bethesda thinks everybody deserves a chance to tag enemies in order to get the loot. 
---
 People complain all the time about enemies being bullet sponges.  If they weren't bullet sponges and enemies went down easy, everyone would complain that they aren't getting a chance to tag enemies. 
---
So making sure more people have a chance to tag means bullet sponges.   Getting rid of bullet sponges means very few people will be able to tag. 
---
And you are presenting this false dichotomy: you're either in the fight or you are a moocher who lots corpses that someone else killed. 
---
Of course that is not how it worse- nowhere close.   More often than not,  it's a case of a player actually tagging enemies like crazy but missing the 1 legendary in the bunch. 
---
Did you even read..? I even stated in the OP I made that post. I was informing people how to delete duped items if they came across them because duping was really bad around that time.. I kept seeing people say they'd drop them in water or a bush but that would leave the bag still. This way the bag would disappear with the items inside.
---
Thank you! Glad it’s not just me that thinks this! They could disguise it sort of like the G.O.A.T for finding the best fit for a server! Sort of like an out-of-the-Vault Placement Assessment. 
---
Nono i liked your feedback :(
---
Hope you get your account back
---
^^^ hopefully:/  huge fallout fan but this shit doesn’t seem worth it. 
---
I had some guys somehow keep getting in through a wall. I know they didn't just log in. They where already online then everytime I killed them they would respawn inside. How does that make since? 
---
All the more intriguing. The cryptids have to be the most interesting part of the game
---
I was multitasking while making my comment so I must have skimmed over the "no appeal" thing. That said I have no argument there. The development teams would know full well of bugs and general issues with game performance *if* they were given the time to do so. That's the issue at hand, they were not given proper time. Production has their "magic November window" but development couldn't keep up with that timeframe (reasonably).
---
Games can't just be perfect in a short timeframe. It took Fallout 4 between 7-9 years to be developed and Fallout 76 is not a small game in comparison while being developed in a shorter timeframe. If the development team isn't done and the bosses tell them to go fuck themselves; it's time to make money. It shouldn't be fault of the developer, right?
---
Then you can't use it yet. Ultracite is level 40 or 50 minimum. 
---
I don't think you realize just how many people were in on the duping craze.
---
Why not, they accounted for players who may have played a insane amount by setting the items limit supposedly to 100,000.  That shows they are accounting for players with significant play time whether you believe so or not.
---
They have obvious coding issues so why wouldnt they struggle to code an algorithm to ban players, they simply struggle to properly code things as they have shown repeatedly so far.
---
I found 700 explosive bobble heads today in a suitcase by a train station.  Hails no I dropped them like a bad habit 
---
Seems like sarcasm..... ummm haha I guess?
---
&gt;in otherwords you have nothing but your personal experiance.
---
which means something when you have close to 1000 hours on your account. besides, I just said I used stats I "collected" from my server hoping during those 1000 hours. numbers aren't subjective. whether you believe me is a whole another story. like I said, I didn't record any of it.
---
&gt;we have a snap shot of players on ps4 when that was trophy stat was announced, but has it ever been updated with new players and **do you you really think ps4, xbox 1, pc sale would all be even close to the same?**
---
usually, yeah. split evenly across their userbase obviously. we can guess a rough estimate based on other, similar games. sales don't tend to skyrocket at random unless there's massive sales. and I \*think\* the PS4 leak was *after* the price dropped.
---
&gt;I never claimed it was some sleeper hit, but that peoples claims of a dying game to be false. frankly by this time the boy that cried wolf should have been bitch slapped.
---
I don't know what qualifies as "dying" but the playerbase is definitely dwindling. I can't tell you with precision, but there's a **lot** less players than November/December. I can even pinpoint when they started to bleed out- two weeks into December, a massive hit in new years (probably because of the y2k bug), then all the way through January, another considerable hit after the TSE nerf and now it seems to have stabilized. I get rotated through the same 3~5 servers at any given time and oddly there's not much of a spike during weekends.
---
I know this for a fact, whether you choose to believe me is up to you, of course.
---
Thanks
---
Thanks so much for this! I noticed this when you posted it, too. Previously, it would take me 1+ week to get things refreshed as well as any fusion cores. I agree on the picking lock on empty containers. 
---
A day or two after this particular update, it changed to daily for me. Did you notice this, too? Fusion cores were either two days or one. 
---
Yet suddenly,I haven’t played for a few days, I log on and every container is empty. I checked later that day, too, but they were all empty again. Not sure if it’s just me... 
---
Guys, we’ll give them all the Rat Poison Kool-Aid as a joke…

Lmao.

---
If you've been banned you may not be able to submit a ticket unless their website is broken... anyone else getting this?  
---
[https://imgur.com/HSxZ51I](https://imgur.com/HSxZ51I)
---
That's your best reply?  You're pretty much proving the point.  You're just a griefer who is pretending their justified because they think they are part of some imaginary majority.  
---
And I don't have a base near the clubhouse, there's no extractors there to be earning me supplies when I'm away, so it's a bad location for that reason alone.  But if I'm at the clubhouse and I see someone wanted for destroying someone else's base there, I will put them down like the griefer dog they are.  
---
If griefers come to your camp, just hop servers. You might think your big and bad enough to beat them, you're not. They run specific builds to limit dmg in PvP as well as armor sets that make them almost invulnerable unless you have the right tools to fight them. Even then, 1 vs 3-4, you'll never win.
---
If you feel the need to extract revenge, you can hire bounty hunters, but it will cost you
---
Trading is an intended mechanic, but your using that mechanic to bypass other mechanics, stash space/carry limit.  No matter how you do it you are still bypassing an intended mechanic in an unintended manner.  There is no easy way for devs to prevent this without completely screwing up player to player trade.   Given all their other mistakes and/or oversights I'm doubtful the game designer implemented a stash and carry limit only so it could be overridden by what your calling an intended mechanic.  Text chat has been in available in MMOs forever, yet here we are in FO76...Wether dev's take action against something has no bearing on whether or not its an exploit.  They took 2? months before they started to do anything about duping does that mean it wasn't an exploit for that time?
---
That statement means more then 100,000 of 1 item or 100,000 of 2 or more items, not combined totals.
---
Your reading comprehension failed sorry to say.
---
they are guilty. guilty people always claim they "din due muffin" 
---
oh the robots are annoying..but i used to get all the brain fungus, cranberries from the field outside of watoga..but the scorchbeasts ruin everything..i dont mind the robots really at all lol
---
We will be kept updated by the tickets and personal info being sent to us directly right?
---
&gt; Bethesda has no reason to lie
---
They do though, the release was heavily scrutinized, full of bugs, and is now being damn near given away for free in many places.
---
I'm not saying they're lying. I'm saying they most definitely do have a reason to lie.
---
Yup.....it makes sense now if it was things I received ....
---
Email for ban says "future patch" not next patch so it might not be tomorrow at all

Everything I have is in the pictures sorry

I did this and ggmmhugf hyuhjhj daafn potato yarbin...
---
Now I'm dead. 
---
sorry, but banning cheaters is fixing the game, dumbass 
---
Email says future update not next update. I think that's how they get around by being vague...
---
They can start by actually acknowledging their mistake.
---
Myself and many others have been banned for apparently having 100,000 of an item with no proof of that being the case. Most I would have is of .45 ammo which I crafted myself and carry lots of due to bandallier reducing their weight to 0.
---
There is no valid justification for these bans, and the very lackluster responses (automated) from bethesda is simply discraceful for a company. We have been denied access to something that we paid for with no valid reason provided. 
---
Thanks anyway.
---
“This decision is final and no further appeals will be considered”
---
“Uhhh yeah we just sent you a PM so disregard that final part because you exposed our flawed security in game. We had no idea someone could do the things you did and not cheat doing it”
---
I know that when I placed a welcome mat in the place, when I logged off there when I logged back on I logged in at that spot. But I know there is also a glitch using Power Armor to get through walls that I didn't think of or know at the time. I saw it in a video of someone glitching into one of the locked vaults. So maybe they were doing that? But as for respawning inside, I don't know how they could possibly do that.
---
She has dropped them for quite some time. It's just really rare.
---
You think Bethesda *perfectly* executed every single ban?
---
*Bethesda...*
---
sorry, but the player base doesn't enjoy playing with cheaters. The game runs better without you, and if they keep banning dupers, I will give them some more money. Good luck with Apex 
---
Ticket system won't work if you are banned, you'll get this and won't be able to select Fallout 76  
---
LOL why is the twitter and Instagram needed? shameless plug? If someone gives you a buttload of rare items its most likely duped and this didn't touch ammo so within 30 days you collected 100k worth of rare items.. blame your viewers they got you banned and honestly if you can prove it with a past broadcast I'm SURE it will get overturned 
---
Yep, just dont use any items in the game. Dont craft, dont trade,n dont use any legitimate game mechanics and you will be fine.
---
It's the legit players that have been banned, I know there are self admitted dupers who have been unaffected.
---
Ok thanks
---
You could probably farm 50k steel in a week, without difficulty 
---
ban dupers and cheaters for life. Console + IP + account bans 
---
I'm in need of a gauss rifle plan or a rifle itself and if anyone has any spare stuff..that's cool..finally got my power armour station up today and will be crafting my ultracite PA soon..
---
I found a more elegant solution to deal with people taking ammo factory.  Go to the computer at the ammo machine, change the ammo type being manufactured to .38 or some other useless ammo, then when that player comes back, they find a bunch of shit in the machine.  You can't lockout the computer and most players don't 100% secure the factory to the point where you can't get in.
---
Ya I agree thanks for the positive comment btw glad you think I'm saying that they should allow cheaters 🤣
---
I suspect you are fucking dumb 
---
I hear you!
---
That’s helpful but there’s a responder eyebot random encounter that doesn’t recognize firebreather gear.

I'm on PC, and just got them, but thank you so much for the offer!

Yah because most big gaming companies have their shit together,  Bethesda does not and continues to fail in coding anything from basic to complex things.
---
bye. you won't be missed, "din due muffin" man 
---
450 for the Radium Rifle?
---
yes. guilty people always lie, especially on the internet. 
---
you believed Jussie's story too, didn't you? 
---
last i checked I had 966 hours in game. Only thing I may have reached 100k in 30 days is Ammo or caps. the ammo i use is ultracite 5mm which is spray and pray on my guns. using super duper perks making a lot of rounds can easily crack that limit. especially since the TSE nerf. Guns doing a portion of damage they use to is making ammo usage silly. I dunno what they are doing over there with the programming but something isn't right. 
---
I don't trust Bethesda nor this sub community really, both lied before, so I this point I take everything as lies until proven otherwise.
---
They are literally trying to give the game away for free because nobody wants to play it, and then they go and ban the one player who actually enjoys it? Wtf?
---
That's fine, happened to me before :D
---
For me, it’s because this rolled up into my All, for whatever reason, and I do enjoy a good train wreck.  Plus, I loved Fallout 3 and 4, and had high hopes that this one would be worth playing as well.  It kinda bums me out that it isn’t, but also makes me want to see (a) just what makes a game like this lose fans so hard, so I know what to look for in future games and what to avoid, and (b) whether it ever gets fixed.
---
How do you store more than 25k caps. Do you have 16 mules
---
I mean, hes a dick, but a mom joke? 
---
I like Nirvana. 
---
Thanks! I've been doing that for a while and just haven't had any luck (well, I had one leg)...until today, when I found the other one. It's still tough without the extra carry weight, but I think I'll deal!
---
dont mind me, just watching what's left of this community eat itself alive 
---
They're a pound a piece aren't they? That would be like 700lbs wouldn't that make normal players go over like way over?
---
Yes
---
[Tomorrow](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language%5B%5D=en).
---
Maybe on PC someone will get an emulated server that's good enough.  And this was always destined to go f2p. But when content patches or expansions hit, everyone will be back for more.
---
Idk if it was the cause but she talked to me after I re-listened to the holotape on the console shelf thing that tells her story.
---
Not surprising at all
---
Seriously? I’m so glad I stopped playing this game..
---
Image posted above
---
They weren't banning for ammo and junk, this is another conspiracy theory our out by people. They were looking for rare items like bobble heads and magazines. So either you were banned by accident or you had other items as well as the ammo that your not mentioning.
---
But i didnt do anything, didnt use any exploits or anything, just took items out of a loot bag i found
---
That's Xbox live.
---
Just because you have an item that has been duped is not why this ban wave happened. 
---
It specifically states 100,000 of a rare in game item in 30 days.
---
So having one duped item wouldn’t get you banned
---
thx
---
game cant be broken if nobody is playing it
---
He's A lil salty
---
This made me chuckle
---
Update-I realized I joined a server where whitesprings had just been nuked lol radiation bruh
---
Ha! Same here. Without Marsupial trying to get into my camp tends to be...[painful](https://i.imgur.com/vr4Gifg.png).
---
yea, sure. like I said, you "din due muffin" 
---
We all "believe" you. 
---
You were raised in a day care, weren't you? 
---
Apex legends is free, and runs more than 10 fps unlike fo76
---
Uh huh, okay buddy. Tell that to the guy with 900 hours, or the couple who have 600 hours and spent $300 on the Atom store. Do you think they were all duping too?
---
+karma
---
500. Join my game. Nuclearspank is my gamer tag
---
I don't know about that.
---
This game left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths plus there's the issue of why come back to it if something better comes along?
---
" You have banned the only legitimate player left playing your game. "  
---
FTFY
---
Because Bethesda hasn't been screwing up dam near everything regarding coding with this game since release........grow up
---
Ignore this guy. He's just a troll.
---
Well the more I read this sub the better I feel about not buying this game and spending my money on actually not broken since day 1 game.
---
Sorry I do not proofread text on a message board directed at some self-important douche that claims to know the inner workings of a corporation because he doesn't like a game. You just don't mean that much.
---
People find a lot of things in game code. Always have, Always will. could loot boxes have been planned? sure. Are they planned. nothing to suggest they are but some whiny little trolls on the internet. And, as has already been shown, they don't know shit. Actually someone (can't remember who) came up with a reason for the lunchboxes as they act as sort of a proxy for those events Bethesda has. So they might have never been loot boxes in the first place. but that is just speculation same as the idea of loot boxes in the first place.
---
F2p is false. Loot boxes are false. So most likely The game dying is false. afterall, there is just as much evidence supporting all 3. Which is to say, none.
---
And dope outfits. Don't forget about dope outfits.
---
So what is the connection between game state on release. Game state as it is now greatly improved. And giving bans both permanent and temporary to people who dupped or associated with dubbers. 
---
The boffins at nukacrypt seem to get the codes up fairly quickly. Say a day or so after they cycle generally.
---
don't bother with ultracite, period. at this point you'll probably want a set of T60 as it's the cheapest to repair and does a good enough job.
---
T60 only spawns at level 40 minimum, though. but T51b does have a level 30 version.
---
or you can do what everyone else does and craft Excavator. but I never really saw a good enough reason to do so, though.
---
Please inform us of how this proceeds. I took your last post to heart and all day today I have been farming those areas. You have been instrumental in my progress. If this is corrected soon, I'm gonna completely lose faith in Bethesda.
---
Yeah, exactly. The guy is literally selling duped items on reddit, and gets mad when he gets banned. Pathetic. 
---
I'm glad he's gone. 
---
Loot boxes, like you said, may have been planned. I'm not arguing that they are going to be added 100%. F2P was a speculation that I never agreed with either. The game dying is a statistically provable fact. 
---
Appeal, not repeal. Meaning I'm sure that they have no intention of entertaining appeals process initiated by the customer. As with all things under "their" control "they" can do as they wish including investigating or not investigating public claims of unjust judgements. If this happened to you, I suggest the same course.  Make a fact based post on what happened, no accusations, no acrimony, and hope for the best.
---
I can't get my head around mules being an exploit. If I have my wife log in a few times a day to trade items and that's all she does, that's not an exploit right? (she's sworn to carry my burdens after all). But if I were to log with a second account and push the exact buttons then all of a sudden it's an exploit? It doesn't add up. 
---
Unless someone does a a real study with real and properly collected data, we'll never know for sure. The question as I see it is "would the potential payoff of +%30 procs be worth the investment to get my luck that high?" I suspect it's not really worth it for personal use, so unless you want to try to bust into the in-game market (good luck), I'd recommend you don't spend too much effort on it.
---
No clue what this was in response to, but no I think the Op of this post is telling the truth and never duped anything.
---
When i see alot of people in one spot (typically 5+) i usually travel to that area to what the fuss is about. If its griefers, i usually help defend the base against them. 3-4 people only make it more interesting to do. Sometimes i die but most of the time i come out ahead as far as caps are concerned. 
---
There was a mat but it was my workshop but maybe it still works for them. Either way they didn't win just gave me free caps lol
---
None of that is cheating thats at most a patch, on them, not a player this is bullshit, nothing close to  cheating or hacking, that's a strategy guide at most.
---
$
---
I played the first day and knew it wasn't something I could stick with in the current state, so I started playing Fo4 survival instead, which I had never done and was fucking amazing. 
---
Mutations are caused by radiation. Radworms increase radiation. This obviously has to be a mechanic in the game 
---
I'm pretty sure they couldn't respawn at the workshop unless they own it. Though I did hear one other thing that players might be able to spawn inside if the defend event is active. I don't know though.
---
yes, they are liars too. If you put 600+ hours on a game that has been out for less than 4 months, you do not have a life, and nolyfers are always getting into shit like this. Be honest, bro. 
---
Of course something better is going to come along. I mean, a single game isn't a lifestyle choice. It's just a game. I know the topic creator has 900 hours, but holy shit...
---
I do the same exact thing. I once had the guy teleport back to see what I was doing there(I had just taken the shotgun ammo he was manufacturing), so I crouched and my chameleon armor let me hid directly on top of the ammo machine. Once he left, I saw he locked it, so I just changed it to .38 and left 😂
---
You can definitely lock the terminal. I do every time just to make sure this doesn't happen. Along with overkill on securing each entrance.
---
Not sure all I know is they kept poping up in the room with the generator lol
---
That’s actually so annoying to me, she posted every social link as proof of innocence and got upvoted, when I do it I get attacked 
---
This would be greatly appreciated I'm looking for it as well. Upvoted ! 
---
I highly recommend warframe, especially if you like farming stuff. As someone else has said, have a look at a beginners guide as unfortunately warframe is not the most intuitive for a beginner. Even little things like you want to get a new weapon, you go to the market section in your ship and you see loads of weapons being sold for platinum (premium currency) not realising there is an option on the bottom left corner which allows you to filter the market for blueprints instead, which you buy for in game currency and build instead. 
---
Every weapon and warframe can be gotten in game, and not spend any premium currency. But... You can fast track if you want by spending premium money. That, and fashion, is the only thing worth spending platinum on, and the former is not worth it. 
---
Seriously, the movement mechanics are amazing, really fast and fluid. Every weapon is unique , a oh my there are sooo many weapons! A d the main things is it really really can all be played for free. 
---
Normal armor with the right legendary effects can be far superior to power armor
---
***"We're banning you for playing our broke-ass exploitable game. Thanks for choosing Bethesda, have a nice day."***
---
Oprah already did this in the 90's. People already know to immediately escalate and/or ask for management. 
---
After the bump in price sadly
---
its like the friendly tapeworm and you're sad to see him go when he does and realize just how much work the little guy actually did.... Instant thought: when we take rad away how do we PASS said worms out... wait I've never pooped.... have YOU pooped? DOES POOP EVEN EXIST!! 
---
I'm getting *tired of your low iq*
---
True professional griefers don't give you the chance. They pick their target, sneak in a big group so they aren't seen on the map. And attack all at once to do as much dmg as possible before you understand what's happening and choose to log off. Already destroying half the base and especially targetting the more expensive things to repair.
---
Hmm wonder if the welcome mat actually lets anyone spawn there. Would be interesting to know for sure.
---
Never thought about that. I've certainly picked up stuff lying around in paper bags.
---
some guy said you can
---
he got an email while on his job
---
Have you tried to pacify them with the charisma perks? It gives you a chance to run/hobble away. 
---
It just works
---
Idk what kind of engaging content bc they can even bring really but I hope something get done. Tbh I'm jus waitin on survival mode
---
So if my wife and I are playing and all she does is Lydia my shit, that's not an exploit, right? But if I'm using her controller and mine to do the exact same actions then all of a sudden it's an exploit? That doesn't add up. 
---
With mules, you are preforming identical actions that two players and two characters could preform, but with only one player controlling both characters. 
---
There is no other exploit I can think of where if two people are doing it, it's fine, but if one player is doing it, it's not fine.  
---
I was checking your post. I'm very curious about the bans and have been researching the.. Was the spring cleaning post about your account? If they missed you in the purge it may have triggered the 4:8:2K ban email
---
Not really comparable since it's a forced PVP game...
---
Who the heck are you to assume all of that,  if your friends are as incapable of seeing not everyone is guilty then I'm glad they quit the game, and they quit because Bethesda screws the game up constantly stop trying to act like they are doing anything right at this point.
---
Uh oh! My pc is playing while I’m not there! I knew my house was haunted!
---
Oh okay. If that's the case. I'll take your advice and post something. Thanks
---
if you want a better fo76, go for outer worlds, Alex is a fun free game, not similar but better
---
Yeah it would
---
Most only want the bounty so they can pvp and kill everyone when someone tries to take it. Its more of an instigating thing so they can get a reaction out of people. The true endgame to me. Lol 
---
::points finger and laughs::
---
Find a better game to look forward to, seriously.  
---
The reason everyone uses excavator is because if u have full set it gives extra 100 carry weight then with calibrated shocks 50 per leg then for some reason if you join a server with the armor on it gives another 100 carry so u can get 300 carry with that set that’s the only reason I use it having 570 carry is very nice
---
Close the duplication exploits, remove large stacks of items that appear egregious/duped.   Then roll out the 4 (and hopefully 5) star weapon and armor sets, or just raise the level cap on weapons and armor to 65 to lessen the market for the original OP duped items...
---
Most companies have a good track record, Bethesda does not, in fact they have screwed up countless things in this game and continue to do so.  Usually I agree with you, in this case I agree that OP was probably innocent and Bethesda yet again programmed something in a screwed up way.
---
Yeah I've noticed this happens if you click play 'too fast'
---
I use the trash cans @ the Whitesprings shops, too, and the toolbox by the pinball machine in Watoga Station 
---
It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a black mark against you. The email states that you should consider this a final warning and that any further infractions will result in an immediate permanent ban. :/
---
Like everyone else has said, don’t bother. The X-01 and T-51b are better in every regard. 
---
Yeah, I am happy having gone back to Fallout 4 and doing the DLCs. I'm bored with it. 
---
Didn’t realize fo76 was banning the few players in their playerbase. 
---
PM everyone who got banned today I bet they'll be looking to offload the game for cheap.  
---
Id he off until level ~50.
---
I've seen the codes on nukacrypt an hour after change, I can't even fathom what they do or how they achieve this
---
I think we may have a problem :)
---
They sent me an itemized list and the only things on it were junk, ammo, and some salisbury steaks
---
you mean at the queen? or just going through the silo?
---
the answer is always the same: are you op enough to oneshot stuff reliably? do you have more resources than you know what to do with? would you be pissed if the server crashed and you lost a good chunk of your stimpacks?
---
4.5 floors up and down from where you place the camp device. So if you place it on the side of a cliff or up a tree you can get up to 9 floors. It's a cylinder about 15 "squares" across at its widest point. 
---
Miss Annie and Rose would like words with you. Haha they're sentient quest givers. I even ran into a Mr. Handy that wanted me to help him as he was terrified he was going to blow up.
---
I got this same email today. I mean its not a permanent ban but its still upsetting. Never once have i had over 100k of the same item in my inventory. The only thing close to that is ammo but anyone can easily pump out over 100k rnds of 5mm ammo in under 30 days. I guess this is just how they say thanks to loyal customers that stick with em thorough thick and thin and pump hundreds of dollars in to their pockets. Never once have i duped yet i got this. Yea i have had duped items in my inventory before but just about everyone that plays has even if they dont know it. Im a trade so of corse im gonna have alot of shit in my inventory what do you expect. But not once did i dupe or even have close to 100k of one item in my inventory. Yet they seem to think i did. Oh well im not to upset i still got plenty of other things to play. Plus its not permanent so maybe eventually ill get access back. I thought about trying to fight this but i have seen nothing but stories of people that have tried to fight bans and Bethesda just ignores them so im not even going to waste my time. 
---
All 3 new codes are up now
---
 I mean next update is a future update lmao
---
not here to PvP.  if i want to PvP, i go play CS.
---
i am here to play PvE as a group.
---
like 100,000 sweet swag? You couldn't even run with that stuff. Pretty sure if you take a few hundred items, you don't get flagged. But taking 100,000 is dumb.
---
I mean, I guess that's nice if you're an average/casual player. but I'm so jaded I only carry what I need and only pick good legendaries up, which is very rare to begin with.
---
If they gave us a number to call the wait time would be longer than the call line for Vault Tech from fallout 3 with how many people they banned 
---
Less than 1% apparently
---
That actually happened to me bud. I just picked up the Dark Nuka Cola and Nuka Cola Purple? Drank em all for the exact cap of bottle caps and left. Now I'm banned 🙁
---
Deserved. 
---
Lol this sub is such trash. Just because you like it doesn't mean people having issues are all part of some shadowy cabal of people conspiring to ruin the reputation of this game (as if there's even a reputation left worth ruining). 
---
Go get the plans off of Tagerdy's terminal. 
---
going off the player counter at the top of the page.
---
This guy Fallouts.
---
I mentioned that so people just don’t think that after tomorrow’s patch they’ll be able to login again... even Bethesda isn’t that fast! 
---
sorry.  pc here
---
What party pooping is going on in this thread exactly? The only remotely negative posts just suggest waiting. That's pretty ridiculous to call party pooping. 
---
So how are you enjoying your dupes item ban?
---
Brilliant. Man, how great would this game be, if they put that kind of energy, creativity and imagination (and $$$) into it!
---
Yeah I’m legit too and got banned, but I’m not worried just yet because I know that I’m good so if they look at it then I’ll be back
---
I really don't think ammo counts as "rare" items.
---
I will love him and pet him and pat him and cuddle him and name him George 
---
Holy fuck they’re fast. 
---
This same thing happened with GTAO a while back, were most people guilty...yup. However a ton of people got banned for no reason as well. Same story as here no one believed anyone claiming innocence. 
---
Except its not because we do not have the statistics, because Bethesda does not release them. At most, you have is your personal experience which is colored by your own personal views, on a limited sample size because we do not even know how many servers there are, let alone how Bethesda decides which server to drop you in.
---
I was enjoying it playing with my brother and a coworker of his. We used to beat the living shit out of each other over turns to play fallout 2, and other games of that era. Multiplayer is something we have looked to for a long time. I can look past the warts to play with my brother who is 2,000 miles away. 
---
I dropped two nukes on a guy who stealth killed me after taking Poseidon from me.
---
such rapier wit.  i have heard snappier come backs from a bowl of rice crispys.
---
Thanks for the link. I've watched some of Joseph's videos before and they give a great analysis of the game. I hadn't yet watched this one until now and again, it was a great analysis. I haven't watched the second video cataloging the bugs, but it left me wanting to call out more of the issues with the game and how they essentially backtracked from Fallout 4.
---
There's definitely a core of a good game in here which I think has come from the base game of Fallout 4 as somewhat discussed in the video (I don't recall if he fully calls FO4 the base to FO76, but that's kind of what I was getting). Either way, there is a lot of fun to be had, but it's hard to ignore many of the blatant issues with the game while the developers spend time on fixing the Canned Stew "bug."
---
I thought this was pretty funny, but oh so true. I've brought up similar issues with other games where the developer decided to spend their time on something minuscule rather than fixing a bigger QoL issue. One example was in Clash Royale, instead of changing the layer of a timer that blocked half of the screen during an important stage of the game, they decided they would change the color of a character's crown from gold to silver. Simple to make the color change, but when I quit Clash Royale, the layer issue still hadn't been addressed in over 18 months and have no idea if the issue is still present or not. It just makes you wonder why.
---
As mentioned, I was left wanting to see Joseph expand more on some of the issues of the game. However, perhaps he didn't play as much to touch on things like the CAMP, fundamentals of the workshop, vendor caps, etc. I still need to watch the second video and if there have been any more after that. Very good analysis nonetheless. 
---
I can refer you to the false arenanet bans where arenanet swore up and down they were legit until someone called out the false identifier
---
most of your points are borderline tyrannical. are we living in a police state?
---
**are we**?
---
I'd give you a hug as thanks, but I'm a little worried cuz I've got... swamp gas xD
---
yes. yes this would.
---
i hope you get your comeuppance.
---
Bethesda has shit the bed so many times now. I've been playing Fallout since Interplay. I was lucky enough to have had a job there. I don't think I would've stuck with them for so long (and dealt with the drama) if it weren't for the love of that game. 
---
I am not angry, just sad and super disappointed in Bethesda for trashing one of my top all-time favorite franchises.
---
I've been F76 free for almost a month and its lightening. In my heart and my hard drive. Sorry you're going thru a rough patch, but you'll come thru it Bethesda Free, and be better for it. 
---
They killed a wonderful game.
---
You and me both, Reddit friend ;)
---
Wait...  You are telling me the SBQ drops loot?  When the hell did this update happen.  The last 5 times I killed her she only dropped spinning arrows along with 90% of the mob.  Last time 3 broken guns 3k rounds of ammo and looted 2 double barrel shotguns and a snub .44.
---
Ahh, the classic excuse, "blah blah wasteland." We're not in "the wasteland." We're playing a video game. To be blunt, if we were in a post apocalyptic setting, you'd be dead, just like me and damn near every other reddit reading munchkin reading this. You're not battling for survival. You're making loops around a golf course to collect loot just like every other game with a predetermined farming location. 
---
So please, don't use the game setting as an excuse for your less than friendly manner. Own it like a proper raider. Say it. "I take joy through the suffering of others."
---
Haha, don't love it too much, or you'll get Swamp Itch XD
---
slurp slurp *sluuuuurp*
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does. There's a quest that gives you a legendary 10mm SMG "Perfect Storm." On one of my characters I did the quest as soon as possible and got like a level 25 version of that gun. Went back and did it again with my level 50+ character and got a level 50 version of that gun.
---
I know I was just messing with you. I know what you mean. Knowing their patch schedule it might be until April or beyond lol
---
I thought it was fairly clear that duping wasn't okay.
---
Your entire argument stems from your own experience. You do not know how you are place in servers, if you have even been placed in all server, or how many people play on the whole. Or are you saying your 1000 hours is you setting there refreshing the social tab and counting people on the server? Because even then you don't know how you are placed into a server. do they take into account friends playing? people with ip address that would put them close by or far apart? Does it take into account who you've blocked and how often you have run into someone? Even if you've played 5000 hours without knowing the algorithm they use to place you, you cannot really apply your anecdotal evidence to the whole.
---
I think you misunderstood my question about the ps4,xbox1,pc. Not that the sales themselves from fallout to fallout was similer but that the sales for fallout 76 acrossed the platforms. Even if you think the ps4 version only sold 400K and no more there is nothing to suggest that the pc version only sold 400k. Personally, I would find that rather weird.
---
::points hoof and snorts::
---
I'd love to see someone across the way, bumbling a gun around from hand to hand like in an old cartoon!
---
Point 18 is fine. You can tell us.
---
As far as I can tell they don't know because it's predicated on them eliminating all the easy duping bugs. So it'll likely be some time.
---
so i have been on the same server today for 10 hours.  it was busy early on, but as i watched the map, and time passed, i eventually became the only person again.  fine with me.  i took the munitions factory early on, got like 3000 5.56 rnds.  WOOHOO!
---
That's still thousands, and I was thinking of even the people who did 'light duping', but I guess that wouldn't be relevant as they wouldn't be posting here about being banned.  But still, thousands were likely banned.
---
This post came up in the popular feed. Maybe they looked at the rest of the sub next
---
I went to check you post history to see if you've dupe hunted or traded with dupers I saw the rabbit post lmao you are a saint no way in hell you cheated or associated with dupers I saw enough free moi boi you're innocent. Damn Beth how dare they.
---
Lets agree to disagree so we can stop going around in circles.  Your really talking about multiboxing now, which is another topic.
---
I guess it's a two-part question then. I don't know too much about the end of that quest line other than you launch a nuke and then, I assume, you can go explore the nuke zone. Initially I was just asking about going through the silo. Hadn't even thought about the 2nd part to that.
---
I WOULD probably be pissed if the server crashed and I lost stimpak's. Is that a fairly common occurence?
---
I’m def not a casual lol I put in 304 hours in just January lol I use my alt characters to sell to vendors an transfer the caps to my main so I keep hold of any legendary that’s worth over 150 an get a friend to help with transferring easy caps if ur not a vendor especially sense they patched the cap farm
---
That doesn't mean shit though. Tons of people were impacted by the Arenanet false banwave that took over 6 months to correct. Meanwhile those banned were mocked for being cheaters
---
Yeah, because it would be very bad PR to release the stats of how many players are on this game. Didn't you think about that being a possibility?
---
Nice!
---
What are you want for it? Blood and crit damage?
---
Next time nuke it. Then nobody wins, And they'd see your name show up on their screen saying you launched a nuke. Then they would check the map and see they have 2 min to reclaim scrap and resources.
---
Yeah, that's exactly what I said - they only affect -Stats. Rattle Hands isn't perception, you just automatically do -25% dmg with guns. Whoop-de-do. Instead your hands should visibly shake when trying to aim down the barrel, and your target go all over the place!
---
How do you manipulate items to stack the bodies for the photo? 
---
So, I'm not sure if anyone has a definitive answer to this, but the way I've had it explained to me is that there's a cap on the amount of water your CAMP can actually purify in a given span of time, regardless of the speed of your purifiers.  The reason you see 1 here, 2 there, none there, etc. is because the 5 that one purifier is supposed to extract is getting spread across all your purifiers because they've reached this invisible limit.
---
Someone suggested this was a nerf that came pretty early on.
---
But then again, the small bonus of the underarmor is so laughable when in power armor, why not allow it?  That tiny bonus from underarmor is only valuable to non-power armor users.  It's like the difference between giving a broke dude a few dollars, or a millionare a few dollars.  One guy is going "whoa!' and the other is thinking "...huh...thanks?"
---
I think you might be taking all of this a little too seriously.
---
Lol, that happened to me last night however I had 2 lvl 80 scorch beasts 12 lvl 68 supermutants, and an army of scorched. This is how the game should be. ( maybe the devs are getting onto the glitch band wagon as well )
---
The rabbit thing was pretty damn funny when I saw it at the store.
---
One of my fav munition factory stories was a night a group of 3 guys way above our levels took the place from me and my GF. They didn't lock the computer (didn't know how to) so we changed it to .38 and then stood in front of it so they couldn't even reprogram it. Since there were 2 of us, we could block off any access to the computer to reprogram it. We just sat there and played pip boy games as the machine turned out .38 ammo.
---
Ghouls seem to have a primitive ambush AI. I've watched one run in a big circle (like, max draw distance big) to try and attack me from behind. I've a stealth build, however, so it "forgot" me before it finished the loop and started wandering back.
---
Appreciate your feedback!!
---
And especially when you're working on the same mission and out of power armor. Cowards. 
---
I was banned to, I have atleast 500 hours.
---
i would just never play any of their games again
---
I wasn't banned.... because.... I don't .... dupe 
---
only the dupers got banned, clown
---
Save yourself, he/she won’t understand no matter how well you explain. Or maybe they refuse to understand. 
---
When you pretend to be smart buy mispell Occam 
---
"100% never playing it again"
---
Well no shit you were banned
---
great tips and bits from the tribe elder!
---
i know and hang at many spots you

noted. my camp is by a lead deposit
---
just down the western cliff below top
---
of the world. i'm in and out, but drop
---
on by. you've got the key. thanks.
---
i've not played since the item duping was brought up, and people being able to steal items from inventories, and the news just keeps getting worst and worst... i really wanna come back but i'm waiting for some polishing. 
---
Yes.
---
The only exception to this is the whole Mistress of Mystery quest line, whose loot is upgradable at a workbench.

I was really looking forward to the upcoming hinted-at Mothman skins, thinking we might get something like an outfit that lets you look like the [Mothman statue](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/7d462bf9-74df-4fc2-a16a-43b22e9cbf14/dcukr9b-00a28512-4bf0-40f7-b782-ebd9c0586f36.png). Then I found out that it's just [this](https://imgur.com/a/Y3UWEp2). To say the least, I was disappointed. 
---
be honest, bro
---
Exactly.  I've said this a bunch of times in other posts.  We have no social tools and what we do in the world is not persistent.  They made an online multiplayer game without any of the online multiplayer functionality.  It's really weird, and it's fundamentally what's flawed with FO76.
---
People complain about all these little things in FO76 as to why it's bad.  No.  The game, effectively as a single player, solo game is pretty good.  I think it's even more content dense than FO4, and the landscape is more interesting.  In some ways, I believe it's a better game.
---
It's just the whole online, multiplayer bit.  All of what's necessary is missing.  It should be an open world builder, think Mindcraft Fallout in a sense.  I dislike the CAMPs as an idea, although there should be something that kind of defines "home."  Beyond that, I'd much, MUCH prefer open world, build anywhere, and own nothing.  All you do is collect raw materials and build in the landscape.  People can make or destroy anything.  Creeps can spawn and be agroed by nearby structures (sort of like FO4 settlement attacks).  Spawns can even scale with building content size.  You could literally just have a thousand dots across the map that spawn creeps only if there are enough nearby buildings within X radius of the spawn points.  Set a random timer, and let human players protect what they want or let the creeps destroy everything.  It doesn't matter.  You protect what you want and let go what you don't.  Players can build upon other players work or destroy random stuff.  Again, protect what you want and let go what you don't.  People can build up a big ass town and nuke the whole thing.  It doesn't really matter.  The only thing I'd do is have a nuke deal X total damage to the sum of building structure assets in the nuke area so bigger and more dense settlements may take more than one to fully destroy.  People may be able to build nuke defenses if they wanted.  In terms of player effort, just let anyone blueprint anything made, so if the players have the bulk resources, they could rebuild pretty easily (so it's not tedious and only from memory).
---
And like you said, we need social systems, a quest builder, jobs, a barter system, etc.  I want to be a merc, a traveling vendor, a medicinal store owner, a restaurant owner, etc.  I do think to make a "world" run smoothly, it would be useful to have some AI functionality to automate your avatar while not playing.  That may not be really possible, but I'm just thinking what do you do when you're not actually there?  Does your store just close?  Can someone else take your spot?  What happens?  How can the world remain active and alive when human players can be so dynamic?  There's concepts that have to be worked out.
---
I would love a quest builder where you can make structures, place creeps, set triggers, define loot drops, and then place this event into the world and let other players interact.  The whole thing would just consume your resources per building items, per creep spawned (you may pay into it by what items it drops (you'd need that item for example or raw materials for that item)).  It's still a lot of resource farming to let you do these things, but that's part of the issue right now.  People end up with piles of resources and nothing to do with it all.  I drop or sell piles of raw materials, and I do this already at a pretty low level with pretty low hour investment.  Resources need to go out and also be useful as a tool for social and world building.  Things like quest building, social systems, and a build anywhere world creates this stuff.
---
For a multiplayer, online game it lacks every aspect of multiplayer, online play.  I don't know if this was a lack of vision, a lack of time and budget, or purpose of intent of this specific game.  For all we know, FO76 might only be a test bed, a tool to gather info for the next multiplayer, online game, Bethesda's WOW equivalent...which I think is sort of the ideal end game for many modern developers...if it's not generic mobile platform whale catchers. 
---
Haven't given 76 much more than a sideways glance in close to a month(thank you x4 foundation and BFGA2). Saw the threads about the error yesterday and tried to login, only to get the error and an email today.
---
I haven't played enough in the last 30 days to get 10k of anything and certainly not 100k.
---
bruh move from out of the cranberry bog
---
They’re a community manager though.. who else is can we talk to 
---
Really cause I have seen it a few times and have even seen those bans reversed, tho those game companies were far more reliable and didnt have the mud on their face Bethesda currently does with this game.
---
hehehe I've contracted dysentery from dirty water... I NEED THIS! can you imagine my toon running around grabbing his butt, with brown liquid spraying everywhere, uncontrollably?   
---
\~You're Welcome &lt;3
---
It's that you're calling people who are probably NOT dupers, lairs because you can't admit that Bethesda Austin mighta done FUCKED UP&gt; 
---
Works for me. Have a nice night. 
---
Ohhh, how does that even connect, anyway?
---
At 10 hours a day, I think this is for the best, for the time being.
---
I’m just sick of hearing it. Sure the game has issues but it’s like it’s become trendy to shit on it.  Plus their are some things the game does generally well such as the depth you can spec your character. It’s definitely not the worst game ever and some make it seem as if it is. It was a game that was rushed that has sky high potential. I don’t see why we can’t just be constructive and enough with bashing it nonstop. It’s getting old.
---
Oh wait, nvm. Is that how many redditors are in this sub right now?
---
I got banned? How am I on right now? 
---
"People aren't honest ever." &lt;-- only truth you have said
---
Ta !
---
You're an awful troll.
---
So now a lack of evidence is evidence? About the only reason we have stats on older games is because of the way steam worked and how people got stats from it. As far as I know Bethesda never gave any hard numbers for any game. Why would that suddenly change?
---
I just didn’t like that the guy who was trying to help was getting shot on, I understand he’s the community manager but regardless he’s still trying to do the right thing 
---
No you gain 1 water every 5 minutes. Purifiers dont stack. 1 fills first then the next then the next and so on and so on they dont all make 1 every 5 min. If that made sense.
---
Occam's Razor can also show us that (while I love this game and play it semi-religiously) the company behind the game has half assed a lot of it. I think it's entirely possible that there are this many false bans
---
Yeah. No.   
---
I bet the system recorded the usernames of every player who got edited by the purge a few days ago. Then they just copy-pasted that sucker to the ban list.
---
WUT. No! You're joshing me!!! You don't even get wings?!
---
Just remember to replace the Mainframe cores to the left of the huge security door not the ones you destroyed... it will hold you up for a bit seeing the damn marker points to a workbench....
---
I am confused about this because I got an email saying my account is banned or suspended or whatever for having that but I can't think of a single item other than maybe ammo that I've had more than a hundred thousand of in my entire play time and most of my Mo I've gotten of either bought from other players made myself or taken the ammunitions Factory and held it for a long time I am wondering if there is a glitch in the system and I got this email by mistake and that's why I can still access my account or if my Mo flagged it and then it just never actually been to me did anything to my account
---
Which entrance are you trying to enter the service entrance or main entrance ? Can you send us a screen shot of the map ?
---
This would not the most sense. I amassed about 200 waters in a few hours accross my camp and 2 workshops and I noticed the workshops' worked fine. Not so much back at camp. I wish we knew the cap... I may have some of them going to waste.
---
Name checks out
---
Lol Bethesda drops their most rushed, least well received game of all time then bans the few players who are enjoying the flaming pile of garbage they released? Seems reasonable
---
just trying to be as transparent as possible, I only got 2 weapons and a power armor set from my friends, surely not enough to ban me, I didn't get a buttload of rare items, but thanks for your input
---
Well, I HADN'T imagined it before this moment - and now I can't burn it from my mind's eye. Ever!
---
But I do like how far you took it. Let's get gross.
---
Also what platform are you on, if you on console have you tried clearing your cache ?
---
Two InsideTheVaults ago I talked shit about their laziness, and a whole lot of people seemed to agree. Last week after Inside the Vault I talked mad shit about the “purge” and how it’s just them being lazy furthering the corporate greed etc etc and it got downvoted to hell. Here we are in week 3 since my good Inside The Vault hate and it seems the game has all but died.
---
The purge didn’t just clear player inventories it just left players with nothing else to do or enjoy, and have left. 
---
First they were worried about pushing this game early.
---
Now all their time is trying to fix a game that should of never launched broken or been fixed at launch. 3 months later.
---
When in those 3 months if the game came out without all the bullshit that came with it , us players would probably still be around enjoying new content and having a better experience.
---
But lack of direction has led us to this and there’s not much reedeming effort to bring people back 
---
I actually haven't successfully launched a nuke yet. But it's on the agenda.
---
Just remember one simple rule. 
---
900 hours or 5 hours played, you don't matter untill you make a public scene. 
---
Now spend some Atoms© at the store!
---
Luck also plays a role in rng
---
So you got banned. You're not honest about being online 
---
Yeah I think so, I just wanted to add a sort of spectrum of obviously fine -&gt; obviously bad
---
The last time Bethesda threw out a banwave we saw this exact same behaviour. People declaring themselves innocent, only for Bethesda to step in and say: "No, these people were correctly banned." something that Juicehead mentions in his most recent video on this topic.
---
Now if this was just a 'exploiting the economy' generic email, which can mean many things including botting, duping or even accessing the dev room, I might be a bit more cautious with my cynicism, however in this case it's a very specific ban with Bethesda stating that this person has obtained over 100,000 of a rare item within 30 days. Note the phrase 'rare item' which means stuff like Uranium Ore, Ballistic Fibre, Nuclear Material. Stuff that you'll come across in a decent quantity if you play for 30 days, but not to the point where you have 100,000 of said item.
---
Any clue what it's for?
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
If they build on a foundation that let cheaters thrive, those people will be over powered and will make things suck forever. Better to get that fixed before things are expanded upon. I know people are getting antsy. I am too. But I'm fine with them taking time to get rid of the things that would screw up the economy going forward
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
Why does it say 60/hr then? I really don't think it's 1 every 5 minutes. Source?
---
Exactly! No wings. No antenna. Nothing. At the *least* I'd want a helmet that looks like the Mothman head instead of just another power armor recolor.
---
It will complete if you have the full costume.. (outfit and hat) but will come back when you log back in.. 🤨🤨🤨🤨
---
I would definitely prepare for it. Do the homework and what's needed. I've been watching a certain Youtuber (MixelPix) that's bad ass at running the silos. He has his girlfriend and another friend all levels 130 to 200 and they make it look like kids play, cool to watch. Good luck! :)
---
What was the purge, I’m not aware of it.
---
Nice work!
---
Ps4 doesn't have mixcloud, so Spotify is the best-no-effort alternative.  You won't be able to get every song you want unfortunately, but hundreds of other songs make up for it. Just one of those playlists is in the ballpark of at least 25 hours of songs. The literally only 30 seconds long ad every 25 minutes is a complete non-issue for me. I wouldn't bother using it if it were several minutes of ads, but 30 seconds is plenty acceptable.
---
Dude. That sucks. I'm sorry. 
---
Except there is no meaningful SLA between players and Bethesda. 
---
I'm afraid it was a hypothetical rock
---
Thanks much! I built until my budget wouldn’t let me go anymore!
---
Update: It seems related to the clothing I'm wearing. 
---
I had on the silver space suit and the atom store space suit helmet. I switched to a different outfit (random drop bomber jacket, sweet) and hat, and now I don't seem to be getting stuck any more.
---
The "economy" is totally fucked. Duppers made sure of that. And players exploiting xp glitches did the rest.
---
But at least the game makes a fine coaster
---
They don't have the priority to help people, I submitted my ticket Saturday, my son today found an exploit, not a big one but I used it to test a theory... sure enough they will look at tickets about exploits in less than 10 minutes but logins they don't even look at for days  
---
[https://imgur.com/heYxlzQ](https://imgur.com/heYxlzQ)
---
It’s not just the cheaters issue.
---
They spend vast amounts of effort each patch fine-tuning the economy, be that increasing repair costs or reducing boss mob rewards.
---
Sorry for the delay, had to be a responsible adult for a bit.  
---
  
---
Perspectives imply flexibility, a "stance" is closer to what you seem to be taking.
---
I've implied willfully ignorant because people have weighted in saying "getting X amount is easy..."   
---
Rather than re-assessing "if someone having Z must be a cheater " you continue.  
---
    
---
Your insinuation others (me in this case) are cheating should by definition require you to actually listen to what others are saying, aka think about their response in reply / in their defense.   
---
Your statement your don't need too reinforces the fact this is more of the same nonsensical witching that's been going on for months..  
---
And honestly You should atleast take a minute to look at someone (in Reddit's case their post and comment history) before implying they are cheating...
---
If the person has been selling stacks of 1,000 Fluxes that's one thing...   
---
Again your statement you don't need too reinforces the witch hunt.  
---
Our / my point is we should not need to "prove" anything to the community, because statements like "you'll have to prove it" continue the negativity and downward spiral...    
---
The fact the community demands proof is the problem, as I said in the first place.  
---
You can't disprove a negative, especially when you can't log on in the first place...  
---
How do you show the community you only had 600 Nuka Quantums (more than reasonable if you don't use them) and not 6,000?   
---
Hell if this was bad heuristics it reinforce the fear the portion of the community like me has had this would happen.   
---
The assumption anyone who has X, or more than Y is a cheater, because haven't kept an open / flexible mind, this alienates and drives people away...   
---
In this case, the day after someone posts a helpful guide to enrich the community, he gets a ban.   
---
Some of the community directly implies, alludes he/she deserves it, and when others come to the OP's defense the implied cheating continues to be smeared liberally.
---
So not just another "tough luck" scenario...  A contributor...  
---
As for trusting Bethesda, the community is mixed there, and I've swung back and forth myself, but this is likely not handed down from the Dev's, but flagged and done by a CS / support rep...   
---
And Bethesda has been handing out temp suspensions with [literally no reason listed](https://image.prntscr.com/image/7wSOEPYbSlCrXg6YldcibA.png) 
---
?   
---
I don't need to work out a resolution...  
---
Not banned, I was just empathized with the OP, proving some context when you alluded to my need to prove I wasn't cheating..   
---
Pretty sure I understood where you were coming from in the first place...  
---
Another anonymous person comfortable with spreading a little more ill-will, because why not...?
---
But whyyyyyyy don't they do something like this that would make them heroes in our minds?? Big, beady mothman-eyes that light up when your headlight is on?!? People would say, "Damn, they got me with the mothman PA helmet. Good for them!" instead of, "Oh. Another PA skin, but muted-blue this time."
---
Yeah dude like you're a higher level than number of hours i've even played, I'm sure aside from you there MIGHT be like fifty people who've poured that much time into this game, and like, you should at LEAST get the first ear of any employee that could reverse the ban, rather than all these dupers out here like SCARFACE like OH SHIT BABY WE'RE MOVING LEGENDARY PITCHFORKS OUT HERE! BARBED TWOSHOT WALKING CANES FOR SALE!
---
Alright, thank you!
---
I have 8 ind purifiers. The game seems to produce water at a certain rate and deposit it into a purifier at random that still has room to hold water. The number of purifiers doesn't seem to affect the rate. Also, the rate seems much lower than 60 per hour. I'd believe 1 in 5-10min.
---
The many purifiers are for water storage space, rather than an increased rate.
---
Hes said numerous times they can show every item in his account as an example, guilty people dont usually say by all means show everyone everything I have in my inventory.
---
You deserve to be banned for ignorance.....see how asinine that sounds?  Take it as a lesson in life and stop assuming the worst in people, sometimes they are indeed telling the truth. 
---
Guess I should be glad I returned my Power Armor edition after Christmas....
---
It works exactly how I explained it.
---
Not that way for us because clients with multi-million dollar contracts get listened to. Or we might be paying them money for each day of SLA violation. 
---
Nothing like banning one of your few remaining players based on the fact that you think they are cheating. Gotta get rid of them so you can shut off the servers and cut your losses. 
---
Not sure why youre getting downvoted, it was in the last ITV.

---
Uhh, mate, most of the EULA's out there for online games basically come down to the player leasing their account and all the contents therein, not actually owning it (or at least, most of them in the US do, I can't speak for other nations). They often flat out state they can and will end your account on a whim. And then there's usually arbitration clauses, and lately, anti-class action lawsuit clauses.
---
Bethesda doesn't need to "prove" jack until and unless it hits arbitration/court, at which point, it then pulls out some documentation and wouldn't you know it, your account had 100k Nuka Cola Grapes at one point, which would be impossible to get legitimately in the time played... and so on.
---
So... good luck
---
awww, you are too sweet
---
He has stated numerous times he has not duped anything, and even asked Bethesda to show all his items as an example, people don't usually do this when they are actually guilty of what's being said.
---
^^ case and point
---
LOL then I'm sure they wrongly looked at your item history and found in-excess of 100k rare items in the last 30 days... put a ticket it should be fixed right away if that truly is the case.
---
Trick question. The answer is: Money.
---
You on xbox yeah? I'm just about to login. If you have a mic/ the person still has the munitions factory I can help.
---
Sky high potential? I've put my fair share of time into FO76, and since the release, Bethesda has had a mountain of controversies, has failed to effectively communicate, and has not added any significant content to the game. I'm fed up with the game they launched and don't see any great potential from it. The criticism is warranted, Bethesda definitely earned it.
---
Ban in 3..2...1..
---
Don't tease. You just want to farm it all for yourself don't you. hehehe.
---
‘Small break’, now I’m 64% on RDR2. 
---
Go read his posts, he had stated he doesnt have over 100k of anything and has asked numerous times for Bethesda to use his account and show his inventories as proof.
---
My day was fine. Hardly have any visitors because my CAMP is hanging on a cliff in the middle of no where...
---
Even if you do glitch your way into more items, that’s the games fault not the player. The game needs to get its shit together. Bethesda is a joke.
---
You should of given them the thumbs up while you proceed to change worlds but not before you block them all
---
I was one of them, I was weak and fell into the mob 
---
you're arguing against estimation at this point. you're making a case that anything's possible and without hard data we can't know for sure, and while that's true, the same applies to literally everything else and that doesn't stop people from making estimations that are oftentimes correct- if they have enough data.
---
now I'm not saying that I do have enough data, but people like me are in the best position to make these estimates. for example, when the game came out, I exhausted the legendary prefix table after two weeks. so I got a pretty good idea of how many worlds there are at any given time. I also know about pools and regional servers and I have compared my experience to other users'; it's not uncommon for two or even three people to be on the same world and witness the same events and players, at least here in this sub. I also don't have friends nor have I blocked people as to not bias my encounters.
---
what I'm saying is that I've gathered enough data in these 1000 hours to be able to extrapolate a "close" estimation based on the facts- **or do you honestly think the playercount is rising**? because, although possible, that's absurd to say the least and my experience points otherwise. **maybe** there's someone manually placing me in order to muddy my perception, because I don't know, Bethesda hates me for straining their servers, but I'd rather believe Occam's razor and say that the game is dying.
---
hell, even this sub has been steadily slowing down.
---
&gt;I think you misunderstood my question about the ps4,xbox1,pc. Not that the sales themselves from fallout to fallout was similer but that the sales for fallout 76 acrossed the platforms. Even if you think the ps4 version only sold 400K and no more there is nothing to suggest that the pc version only sold 400k. Personally, I would find that rather weird.
---
why? that's usually how it goes. games like Fallout sell similarly across all platforms. at the very least you can compare it to Fallout 4 and then account for the fact it sold less.
---
Ding ding! It’s always about the money... never the customer who they already have their money...
---
Sounds like you didnt actually read through his responses.....good job tho.
---
Exactly!! People would go nuts over it. Instead their big Mothman event is gonna flip.
---
Yes, of course they will. 
---
This is an idiotic post. Use your common sense. 
---
The game itself isn't glitchy, other than the sound bug. It's just crashy af. Me and my mates crashed like 5 times today.  
---
Just played a match where my friend was kicked of the match because "The leader left the group", was full equiped with yellow shield with my other mate, then I crash at the last round.   
---
If you haven't crashed on Apex yet, you probably haven't played enough. I have 47 hours on it.
---
I found a bag a few weeks ago and started grabbing everything in it.  After weight shot up I realized I'd picked up 8000+ scrap steel.  Didn't get a ban notice, but I see how easily you can get duped material.
---
[removed]
---
I was wondering why the hell I had two sets marked like that. Thanks.
---
Ridiculous.  And instead of fixing it, you'll end up getting banned.  I guess it's easier to sweep it under the rug than to actually do something to correct it.
---
True. Keep the Wastelands safe.
---
Thanks but I'm on PC. *insert lame master race joke here*
---
Maybe someone botched their query. 
---
Nice job. I gave up and got my x whatever enclave armor, then finally accidentally found the right leg. 😒
---
what outfits have you gotten?
---
You are correct,  but Bethesda doesnt exactly show that they use Industry standards, they use antiquated tech that fails to accomplish what it actually should more often then not.  Hell everytime I log back in wearing excavator I have an additional 100 carry capacity.......they cant even code fixes for basic problems.
---
They are scrambling to fix broken systems, and they more often then not fail to do so why would setting up a ban algorithm be any different given their history?
---
*Perfectly innocent* users, don't forget!
---
This is probably an unpopular opinion here,  but personally I am glad to hear they are finally cleaning up the servers.  Duping was ruining the end game pvp aspect. Hopefully they are only doing it where there is solid evidence of exploitation. My guess is that they are. 
---
One more thing that happened in a different case. The drive that my Windows pagefile is on was really low on space (&lt;3GB). RAM would fill up, no room for pagefile to grow and game would just close. This one is more of a hail mary since it was closing and not disconnecting like you said. 
---
Hope you can figure it out. Good luck.
---
Ding Ding Ding!!! And we have a winnnnnnnah! Sir here's your cigar!  
---
jk. But I've heard crazier theories.   
---
Same here. My tag is the same

So many subs and likes and hey here's my patreons and don't forget to tweet this's.

I don't think Zennimax is publicly traded. Bethesda is a subsidiary.

I'm noticing a trend, Dr Watson. They were all....

Exactly. I do believe BGS have love for their fanbase/games, but not this 1. This game is just cashcow, reselling previous coding to fund (employ more people) to work on future projects.
---
Oh I wasn't trying to be lol
---
Yeah. They are.   
---
Most of the folks who are left playing have been willing to give Bethesda Austin the benefit of the doubt on every issue that's come up.   
---
So their instinctual response is going to be to jump to the game's defense and to declare people liars. 
---
I've never owned the game and pop in expecting the same old complaints. Hoping it gets better but not holding my breath. 
---
If you have ever helped someone move things between inventories, picked up duped items and dumped them in a river, or basically had any of those items touch your inventory in large amounts they banned you. They said it was for rare items but mine was all for junk and ammo.
---
Warframe has one of the best communities for any game IMO. 
---
Funny, that. And every last one was 100% totally innocent, except for the ones that admit they picked up some stuff but *never* duplicated, they totally stole that stuff from some dupers they found out in the wild.
---
The character i did it on is named banmebethesda, it would please me if they banned me. It means they are actually paying attention and going to do something about it. So far, 4 hours into the account its still going strong. Despite doing nothing but teleport into dev cells over and over.
---
so you are saying I should accidentally file my ticket in the exploits category? lol
---
Every current ban has that email, OP has said numerous times Bethesda can show his inventory to everyone and he has never had 100k of any items let alone rare ones.  In general yes I agree the accused are usually full of shit because they are mad, based on this guys numerous posts showing where to farm and do various things he has at least the credibility of knowing where to farm, he knows this from farming those places (you dont bother with that if duping you just dupe the dam items).
---
I think the email is generic and doesnt say why they were actually banned, the excuse they give is what they wrote in but it may not be the reason for each person, Bethesda is known for doing things outside of what and how they wrote it.
---
I’ve helped a friend move some Armor he bought to his low level acc but no never done that, I’m stumped man 😔
---
got about 175 without trying to hard here.  great spot for when you've neglected picking it up for ages, and then try to rebuild your base
---
please just tell us Wooby is okay 
---
I agree with what you're saying more than anything else. Disinformation. I'm not sure why the 900 hour guy or the twitch streamer them spreading disinformation doesn't make sense. But without hard proof from everyone that was banned I'm leading to another "trade-gate" maybe some investigation can be done though. Find the original profile complaining/detailing the trade theft thing and see what's common? I dunno, I'm just some guy on the internet that plays a video game and talks to other people on the internet that plays the same game. 
---
I only have rank 1, rank 3 tightens your spread up so much it's like using a slug shotgun. Useful at longer ranges, but situational.
---
The little side mobs are random spawned when you load in. There is a little area behind the 76 mountain where critters spawn, have seen chickens, squirrles, and rabbits there.
---
Make sure you post in the official forums as well for visibility 
---
Then put your fix my account in as cheating. Then they might read it. 
---
Why not? I personally believe that Bethesda could have screwed up their criteria or their query, but people willing to dupe might also play a lot of hours. 
---
Damn it Carol...
---
&gt;Is that a fairly common occurence?
---
yes, especially when you nuke the queen. there's little reason to nuke her unless you want to check it off, really. better off nuking Whitesprings and hoping to get something decent from the Ghouls.
---
nukes are supposed to be done in groups unless you got end game equipment. you can solo it, of course, but it's gonna be a strain on your resources unless you take casual strolls in the Cranberry Bog, for example. it's not something to be done willy nilly.
---
Don't gotta refund a broken game if nobody's playing it anymore.

Zenimax is not publicly traded, there will be no public disclosure on their numbers.

JUST MORE LIES!
---
Level 200 I found a ton of ammo on one of my characters and picked it up and really didn't pay it any mind. Guess I'm banned now, how dare I pick up a big bag of ammo out of the overseers stash. 
---
It's a two part song. If you look up the second half on youtube, it goes from creepy to outright funny as it goes to further and further extremes. Not sure why they cut the second half, aside from length maybe.
---
Exactly! I know that some things are bad atm but this is crazy. Hopefully I wont be that unfortunate.
---
They literally said they answer all tickets in the order received per Bethesda Customer Support via Twitter... 
---
All asking about tickets for logins get told this so I tested it... sure enough in less than 10 minutes status went from waiting on agent to under review... meanwhile on my account it still says waiting on agent even though ticket was placed on Saturday. 
---
BOS armor plans and mods not showing up at vendors is a know issue that that they are "looking into":

We're hoping to reduce the edge so they don't cut themselves with it.
---
When White Knights get banned, you know you dun goofed Bethesda lol.
---
Never show unwavering loyalty on a shit company, hopefully you learned your lesson.
---
Not at all. Each account has a stash limit. There is no problem there. 
---
Did the game say “only one per person”?
---
Producer, his info is COMPLETELY fake. If you own a workshop they HAVE to initiate the whole stealing workshop thing. If you are in the general area, then they can shoot you. However if they successfully claim the workshop you will be back to a non hostile state.

I am a PVP player so I know this for certain.

I get this same screen often on the PS4.. I can usually hit ok several times and it will go through.
---
lol u must be trolling
---
To be honest they likely are holding out until an update to reverse the bans so that might be why tickets are low priority. Sucks, but hope they fix everyone soon
---
30% of the time it works everytime!!
---
😆 but really though... 30% means 30% 
---
I don’t know, OP has a post 61 days ago about he picked up duped items. Could’ve only picked it up that one time, but whom knows. 
---
yeah 2 million weight limit hahaha
---
My brother got suspended all he had on his mule was steel,cement and Stimpacks.

I will edit a photo of his email.

I know he never duped or never bought duped items off reddit.

This is how it works. Game bombs, people abandon it, then judge the next game by same big name producer by what happened. This guy's just being honest. Most people effected like this don't plan it out. They just see the next game and go "eh, though Fallout 76 sucked. I'll pass. Maybe if the reviews are good".  
---
The next game by Bethesda Studios is going to be punished by the public in it's first few weeks for the sins of Bethesda Austin. 
---
Dunno why people even bother making post such as this one, when it's so easy to check for someone else's chronology.
---
And people wonder why claims like this are doubted out of hand.
---
Not tonight, gotta wake up too early lol
---
Hit me up tonight psn rogue-firebomb 
---
Banning would be the wrong kind of response, but it will be the easiest fix for them. It is the same with the dupers, in stead of fixing the duping issue, they "spring clean" and ban users.
---
Here come the white knights! 
---
I’m with you!  Just hit level 220 and spent most of my time showing off base builds...  also spent around $200 in Atom store to showcase and encourage build integrations.  PSN: Twitch_COMGUY
---
I think many are genuine bans and people just got caught doing whatever but I know a few from different groups that did at all levels that have a hard time killing molemen so doing anything or getting that much seems like a bad algorithm they used to catch people.
---
The latter of course, if this hadnt gotten attention, he would have been completely fucked, even if employees saw it. Guarantee this is the result of a higher up having all this publicity brought to their attention
---
I transfer junk and extra weapons or armour to my other accounts to keep for others or to sell. I get all my weapons legit so why would it flood or damage the economy? They’re meant for trading, which is why I keep them on a separate account. Makes it easier to play without being weighed down. 
---
lmao. Bethesda, Blizzard, god knows what.. Stop buying these games and start learning how to make em. These people don't care about you and once you accept that then maybe you will be the programmer you always strived to be!
---
Ok. Source?
---
be honest about duping, bruh 
---
I'll just say this. It's not like actual players (and people who have never played the game) have never lied before. 
---
What?
---
You can get nuke codes online u dont have to mess with dev room google it 
---
Careful, this guy is a hero xD
---
I'll get downvoted but if it wasn't for dupers, the vast majority of the playerbase would be running around with pipe guns. the odds of rolling a god legendary are less than 0.000001%.
---
case in point: now that stacks have been purged, both the bazaar and the market are back to asking 25k caps for crap 2\*s and locking decent 2/3\*s behind trades most people will never qualify for.
---
so essentially capitalism, except in game. people who bought sentinel/cavalier armor and meta weapons are now the 1% who rule pvp.
---
Interesting and worth a shot. Were you stuck on Gourmond part, too?
---
stop lying tho
---
There appears to have been a number of false positives in a recent ban wave targeting exploitative accounts, unfortunately for now we can only hope this gets addressed sooner rather than later.
---
One of the CMs has responded to one player so they can be investigated and with the influx of support tickets this presumably extends to others.
---
In emails sent out to those affected it has been stated that the ban (legitimate or not) is temporary until the supposed duping issue is fixed, the game will receive an update tomorrow so we may be reinstated then but it isn’t certain.
---
I don’t know what to believe. I play solo, and mostly just lurk on these boards, and I’ve *never* had a problem. I’ve swapped/given stuff away and found the occasional thing, but I’ve had zero issues. There was that whole thing about people duping and stealing peoples stuff, but I never saw any actual evidence of it. Are there ways for people to validate their claims? Not that I disbelieve or believe anyone, but the burden of proof seems to rest on the shoulders of anyone who was banned. 
---
L
---
So what, it’s much better to let the pathetic cheaters roam free and do what they want than to crack down so hard that you ban innocent accounts too.
---
This gotta be fake because nobody enjoys playing fallout 76!
---
Thanks again man. Very professional. +karma. 
---
lmao!!!!! OWNED!
---
Sorry this happened to you but y did u take a pic of your face
---
I learned from ESO that MMOs are stupid for reasons like this. People can get banned for exploits that they didn’t even know were exploits. And for those of us who are pretty much only single player game players, why would we think that we should avoid doing something that the game allows us to do? Sure, I know better because I read forums and reddit. But many people just play the game. 
---
In fact, many of those people don’t even care what others are doing. They are doing their own thing. 
---
It's a possibility, but you shouldn't get banned unless you actually duped. The suspected items should only be removed.
---
Wrong. .50 no way you farm 10000 a day unless you play 20+ hours 
---
Banning is something they should do alongside REMOVING THE DEV CELLS FROM THE GAME. They have half assed every fix they have applied so far, including this one.
---
i lost my 3 star metal chest in this way...
---
this is gonna get blocked too watch lol 
---
We’re happy for you cheater 
---
If your referring to https://nukacrypt.com , I made that website.
---
Quite true. Even worse, it's not even for *my* use. I horde it for other people to grab. haha
---
yes, because there's someone out there hellbent on gaslighting a Fallout sub. it's not Bethesda who's at fault, nope. a company known for not being able to code a decent piece of software to save their lives.
---
drop that tinfoil hat man
---
Wow it actually made it through! 
---
So you technically paid money for a broken game you don't physically have. Physical copies are better.. Easier to sell if you get sick of em

It will conform to your level. Just dont so it alone.

Troll. See post history.

Honestly, if I knew it was you and your GF I would have taken it from you too. 
---
Why is that PA specifically never gotten a paint job while all other PA has at this point?
---
If it’s for some lore reason it doesn’t really make sense and if it’s to string players down the road to eventually be able to paint the PA, that kinda crappy. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7l4u7/taking_peoples_duped_items/?st=JSB36PKR&amp;sh=4e24ccc7
---
ok
---
There has been some dishonesty surrounding this issue, just now a post was made from a “new player that was banned” with a post history complaining about their 2 million carry weight.
---
But there’s most definitely cases of accounts being mistakenly banned on this occasion, I wouldn’t dismiss them as easily as we did last time.
---
Well to be fair this subreddit was created when Bethesda contacted MrWoodhouse days before the announcement. He's essentially an unpaid shill but he does do the same things for multiple games. 
---
If you want proof look at the day this sub reddit was created vs the announcement.
---
&gt; You are bypassing a game mechanic through unintended means
---
Unintended?  It's a time-honored MMO mechanic.  So is twinking. 
---
 Do you think the devs were unaware of that, as game developers?
---
There are plenty of in-game and on-platform solutions to muling, and the devs enacted exactly none of them.  They don't mind.
---
I don't know what to think, the true.
---
I feel like Bethesda was not prepared to handle a multiplayer game like this and they are trying to rule it, but at this point it's out of hands…
---
Dupers, exploiters, weak game-mechanics abusers… damage is already done.
---
Yeah I don’t get why people don’t understand this. I’m using a second character to exploit a game limitation but I shouldn’t be banned. 
---
Last weeks Inside the vault included 9 hours of server downtime to do the most half assed “duped” item deletion I’ve ever done did see.
---
Well I'm glad you're happy. Buy I dont even play this game anymore since it's a steaming pile of shit that they will more than likely never fix. The only thing that made this game fun was all the exploits, and that's so fucking sad. They really turned out a shit game.
---
It's not a tinfoil hat I'm holding. But evidence of past baseless outrage culture in this sub.
---
 
---
The being able to steal people's stuff while breading was fake.
---
Also the last time they dropped the ban hammer, lots of these types of posts popped up too and BGS confirmed those reports to be bullshit.
---
Because I should believe people i dont know because they're on reddit. :P
---
&gt; In 76 the only song they did a decent job (maybe unintendedly) of living  up to the old series music choices was 16 Tons because of the heavy  suggestion of abuse towards workers by labor bosses 
---
... It's literally about the miserable life of a stereotypical miner of the times, and how hard you had to be to survive it. Most of it doesn't even talk about the boss, and implies that the job/life in itself is a horrible experience (much like "Dark as a Dungeon").
---
Also, fully half the soundtrack is rather upbeat. While I agree that those songs do not match the original "what a shithole world" or "Comedic sociopathy" vibe of the classic fallouts, they fit the Bethesda interpretation fairly well, a solid mix of "life is shit" and "but let's keep going anyhow."
---
If this was Fallout 1/2, I'd agree that it might imply cannibalisim, but that interpretation is rather weak from my point of view even so. I rather suspect it was instead placed as a "keep going" moment of humor as opposed to the "well shit" side of the playlist.
---
I also point out that "I don't want to set the world on fire" is literally a love song, and not even remotely dark, nor about murder or lawlessness. I'm starting to wonder how much of the lyrics you're actually hearing.
---
You can either believe all claims are true or false and be ignorant.
---
Or you can take the more logical belief that Some claims can be true or false. 
---
Had 3 S.B.'s fly in to White Springs the other day while I was working the club house(new one on me, have only seen them there after a nuke previously) and started kicking my ass hard, I did the only reasonable thing I could..............ran like a bitch and brought them(and 3 rad scorpions and a handful of ghouls, glad I wasn't overencumbered, lol) back to all the sentrybots hanging out at the hotel where after a 10 minute battle and a lot of needless robot death we prevailed and I was able to pick the corpses of those dirty S.B.'s clean.
---
Sometimes posts get stuck in the spam filters, which happens on high traffic subs. Ask any Reddit mod.
---
Pro Tip: this isn't always going to work. Some companies do empower their agents to fire customers. Granted most companies are just going to stop and get you a supervisor; but I enjoy telling my customers no, particularly when they start the conversation like an entitled child.
---

---
The economy isn't fun to be in because of all of the duped gear.

You don't / can't do it...that's exactly where they dropped. Which is why its such a frickn' cool shot.
---
I'm on PC too. May I add you as a friend?
---
Ive seen him 3 or 4 times in about 300 hours, once in savage and in the ash heap. He always disappears never fought me. Got 1 sneak attack kill on him and he had no memorable loot.
---
r/all plus being high and I ended up here.
---
Is taking duped items the same as duping?
---
Are buying items from a pawnshop the same as stealing them yourself?
---
Lol. Fuck that game. 
---
Just lost mine.  Wtf.  Anyone figure this out ? 
---
Wouldn't they have to buy a 2nd copy of the game to do this? That alone would make it not an exploit imo. 
---
So I'm curious, what could someone possibly do to show that they *haven't* been duping? The email rejection also doesn't offer proof that you did something wrong, only that Bethesda is claiming it. And given FO76's track record so far, their technical claims are about on par with anyone claiming the opposite side.
---
picking up 100,000 items can get u banned. Not 1. Relax
---
you said that, then said you could load tracks onto a usb drive (from a pc im assuming). What i meant was if you went that route and you sourced from mixcloud most mixes are at least an hour so with only putting a couple mp3s on a thumb drive and inserting in into your ps4 you could have a good 3-5 hrs of “radio” easy.
---
Yeah, it’s absurd...
---
Word
---
I used to work MMO support and spamming tickets would actually be a valid reason to get you banned there. I wouldn't try it.
---
and you actually believe Bethesda?
---
wow
---
LOL so why suppress a PSA? its there, it just never made it through, has nothing to do with anything about anything  its just proof this subreddit is supressing info.
---
Yeah, this is horrid. This guy gets special treatment because he has some popular Reddit posts? Who the hell is in charge of customer service?
---
I uninstall the game throughout my strategy guide and refuse to purchase any more Bethesda titles
---
I feel lucky I got to kill him then. I was actually trying to sneak close for a picture but he turned and attacked.    
---
Never killed Mothman though. Twice he fled and once I had Stalker Mothman flatten me on a couple hits, I wanna kill it...
---
Jokes on them, I banned Fallout76 from my PC.
---
You unfairly cheat the system to get items then complain that Bethesda are unfair to you? Beautiful logic my friend.
---
Yup.
---
Try to get a officially statement
---
but this one made it through with links to an Imgur within seconds...... 
---
they're correcting symptoms of a problem they don't understand. there is no damage progression as a casual who plays this like an online shooter and who aims down sights. Bethesda needs to do a massive overhaul of weapons, mods, damage, ap usage to fix a crap ton of issues.
---
Bull
---
Fucking
---
Shit
---
Jesus I forgot about this post. I haven't found a soultion lol
---
I have seen several posts where OP has been quite indignant, and on having this idea pointed out to them, say "that might explain it."
---
I thought she only dropped Ultracite Explosive Vents???
---
Something is triggering it. 
---
If you run all the top purifiers, make a lot of ammo, farm a lot of resources, gather a lot of ore, play a lot. 100,000 isn't out of the realm of possibility.
---
The thing is casualplayers that didn't even dupe (stock weapons) have reported getting banned. Likely a false positive. They do exist.
---
I mean, it's not like they have lied before. it's a great idea to blindly believe a company. what could possibly go wrong, right?
---
I mean it’s not uncommin for a ban, in fact most companies do this. For example in WoW back in the day a guy was accidentally given a Dev room item. He sold it, and the guy who bought it ran his entire guild through the hardest raids 1 shotting everything. Everyone was banned in his guild, only one used it, but people knew something was wrong. Most companies TOS explains this, I’m assuming Bethesda did the same. Look at the bright side, at least it’s a temp.
---
So the real response to your theory is "why bother". Bethesda isn't competing with anyone with FO76, it's already a sunk ship that they're trying to get back above sea level. There's no reason to throw money away on that.
---
I didn't necessarily think you cheated. I would have probably guessed 'exaggerating' when you wrote hundreds of thousands of steel... but it's not a big deal on that point, and I've seen a few others explain ways to farm a resource super fast so I'll bow to your expertise. 
---
Going back to the people who were banned, we may have to agree to disagree when it comes to proof. There are a lot of misleading/false things said about this game, so I have no interest in blindly accepting what people claim to be truth on reddit. I view asking for proof as the compromise of a reasonable human being sitting on a computer in a place that is full of misleading BS (the internet), and I'm not going to turn off my principles and logic circuits just because these are fellow gamers. That would be no better than tribalism (or fanboyism when on behalf of a company).
---
If you don't mind my asking though, what would your solution be in this situation? Like if you were Bethesda, what way could you solve this without asking for some kind of proof? The only other thing I can think of is to just give a pass to anyone who claims innocence, which seems silly in general, but also like it would set a bad precedent for future exploiters.
---
Damn.  I'm gutted.  I. Just used all my lead to make like 200 bullets and scraped all my guns.  Took a break to eat and now I have no guns lmao.  
---
You mean something other than a Bot response?
---
That's really annoying since 95% of the time your issue can be fixed by a typical agent.
---
If you scrap all it counts it as wood...I’ve lost many bleached dogwoods ..very annoying  
---
Possible stupid question: Do you stand at the normal place, or do you go through the door and stand right in front? A few times, I went in the door, until I realized I wasn't getting tokens. Once I stopped doing that, I started getting them again. Not saying that is what's happening to you, just asking in case it's possible.
---
She has always dropped them. First queen fight I got the carnivore serum recipe. 
---
FYI serum recipes are not 3.8k-5k caps, that is what the actual serums go for. Currently you can buy the recipes from the whitespring bunker for about 16k.
---
Perhaps they have justification that you are a cheating duper.
---
I agree with you man. The subreddit should fully admit to it's ties.
---
good ban! next...
---
Some people blame dupers for the majority of problems with the game, and therefore, anybody with the slightest whiff of it should get the banhammer. They think you're at fault, and they don't give a shit whether you're being treated fairly or not as a result.
---

What do people mean by "XP glitches?" Just curious.
---
guessing 2.5 - 4 hrs as per usual
---
To OP you are a trash liar and you deserve it. Wake up and climb out of your mommies womb. Take responsibility. We don't need ppl like you in the wasteland. Enjoy your ban
---
I am only subbed to this to monitor the morale to see if I should jump in at some point.  After the last couple days I think I will just unsub and call this game a loss.  I was so hyped for this too and was going to start playing after I was done with RDR2.
---
Little things please little minds. 
---
Just going to ask the obvious question here, not saying it's true, just going down the mental checklist. Did you check your stash? If you have a copy in your stash, and it's a unique item, it'll still say you "have" it even though you don't.
---
My favorite place to pvp. Always end up with 1000s of caps.
---
everything i heard about this game is fucking garage, what the fuck is up with the publisher? jesus chris t bethesda get your goddamn shit together you sniveling fuckers
---
I've had friends I play with on XBone get banned, some were known dupers other not.  The "ban" seems very scattered and unorganized, like someone threw a handful of shit into a fan and whoever was caught standing in front of the fan and got splattered got the ban.  Pretty sloppy work on their part as some of the people that I know who were banned are legitimately innocent while others not so much.
---
There's potential in the idea... if FO76 were actually competing with anyone in any meaningful way. 
---
You can quite easily set the entire place up to be completely blocked off. Lock all the doors, stack barriers and/or furniture in the openings in the walls. If done right, no one can get inside without getting a bounty in the process.
---
Just don't miss the hole in the roof. I sneak in there all the time and kill unsuspecting Vault Dwellers.
---
Same here, I would stream base building... 🤷‍♂️ PSN: Twitch_COMGUY
---
I don't know whats happening in this thread as I haven't logged in a  few weeks because Lack of content. What I read is people are getting jerked off with code bans after recent item purge. I wouldn't blame Bethesda as they probably soft coded it into the item purge as they are fkn lazy. That's all just ranting. 
---
Retard alert. 
---
How is it blind belief when there is fairly recent evidence of completely fabricated exploits/bans?
---
Was there a "defend the workshop" event going on? Because someone who goes to the map and selects "Join Event" can teleport right inside when fast traveling.
---
Killed both they shouldn't bee so rare their cool Cryptids
---
I got a free copy with my One X and haven't even installed it.
---
Lol. This goon was buying duped weapons 66 days ago. GTFO. 
---
Yep. Sure is. Welcome to de-escalation 101. "What's the problem, so I can tell them?" "It's X." "Oh, well I should actually be able to fix that for you here if you like."
---
what evidence? I'm genuinely interested.
---
but to answer your question, no one should take Bethesda on their word. they have lied before and everything they've done so far has been questionable.
---
It's on All

Annoying event u need 2 players minimum and use butchers bounty perk run round the house and to the lighthouse those big frogs spawn

thatd be epic!
---
You have until march 1st
---
U sound like a real worm.
---
&gt;That depends on how you measure them. Bethesda games have a lot more in them to do. 
---
That's entirely debatable dont you think? One of the biggest gripes about 76 is the lack of content right? And I'm not some Bethesda hater either.   I love just about every game I've played of theirs with the bugs and all.  No matter what anyone says about FO4 it's one of my favorite games of all time.  Skyrim is a game that I still play to this day as sad as that sounds given Its age and how many times I've beaten it.  But to try and compare which games have more in them is trivial. And again I'm saying that as someone who has gotten an insane amount of hours logged into bethesda games so obviously i agree with you largely but I'm not gonna get into what games have more playable hours.
---
&gt;You can't interact with the environment very much in GTA or RDR2.   
---
Then your missing out man. In both games the environment is incredibly interactive.  GTA alone had so many Easter eggs in it that it took years to find them all and that's just Easter eggs.  The amount of story telling in the environments in those games are great as well but RDR2 hit it out of the park.  The amount of detail inside RDR2 is something that they should be very proud of as VG developers. 
---
&gt;I've not played RDR2 but something tells me you can't walk into a random house and pick up everything in the house and move it around.
---
Then that something telling you is 100% wrong. You can absolutely stumble across someone's homestead and rob them blind.  You can come across a bunch of cowboys or gangs camp and eavesdrop on a very detailed conversation and decide to murder them. But of course you can't walk into building in RDR2. But again let's be honest you cant do that in Bethesda games either.   Yeah you can go into SOME homes and fuck their shit up but not every single one. How many buildings were inaccessible in FO4? How many buildings were inaccessible in skyrim? How many homes are there in 76 that you arent able to go into? Dont judge something if you haven't played it.
---
&gt;I know you can't do it on GTA as the NPC's are simple programs to do one action and are randomly spawned in.  Not many large open world games has that much interaction with the game world.   
---
I think your kinda putting bethesda on a high horse here.  Is there a bunch to do? Yeah but what game are we talking about? Because it certainly can't be 76.  There plenty of open world games that give you as much environmental interaction and environment storytelling as any bethesda game to date. 
---
&gt;Bethesda is also one of the few game developer at least major ones that are fully in support of the mod community and allow their games to be modded till they are completely different games. 
---
That's great but I'm not sure why that's relevant to this.  It's not okay that they become almost reliant on the modding community to fix many issues with their games.   Im very happy that they allow mods but to be honest I don't think it's as impressive as it was in 2008.
---
&gt;Are you talking about the company as a whole including all the individual subsidiaries that are working on their own projects? Or are you looking at just Battlecry Studios?  
---
I'm pretty sure Battlecry Studios has renamed to Bethesda studios Austin but could be wrong.  I'll go so far as to say take anyone of BGS teams or whatever you want to call them and WC still doesn't have the resources or manpower or support that they do. 
---
Its not exactly controversial to say that a medium sized studio has the same advantages as another who's under the Bethesda umbrella. 
---
OP already quoted the fake exploit (being able to steal while in trade) and the previous bans for "crafting more than 5 items" which was also false.  All you need to do is go back in this sub and you'll see the posts in question unless they were deleted.
---
the Fallout playerbase is comprised mostly of solo players. everyone plays solo except for people with friends irl to coop.
---
pvp is mostly griefers blowing up bases or people you will never be able to compete with because of legendaries.
---
Sit at your camp and watch like I did
---
If they backtrack on this dude, then their post about not banning people for no reason is 100% null and void.
---
base building ... streaming .... (and duping, but don't admit it) 
---
That looks awesome. They'd love this on /r/fallout76settlements 
---
I think the fact that cheating was your solution to have fun speaks more to you, than it does about the state of the game. 
---
When they all said can't wait for the banwave, brb grabbing popcorn &amp; they get banned LOL!!!! Brb grabbing popcorn this is very enjoyable to watch.
---
Not only that but we’ve had a problem of people trying to spread lies in this sub.
---
Customer Support doesn't have players in mind to help and I can prove it.   
---
1. First you get an error trying to login -  Login Failed. This account is not authorized \[4:8:2000\] 
---
2. You submit a ticket and wait
---
3. They tell you to buy the full game and give you a link that says the error is from you playing the BETA
---
4. They have you do a hard reset on the console
---
5. They have you delete the user and data which reboots consoles
---
6. They have you reinstall the game
---
7. You then receive a letter banning you: [https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)
---
My ticket has yet to be answered from Saturday or even looked at. Via Bethesda Customer Support on Twitter, they state that all tickets are looked at in order received... however that is not true. Look at this image:  
---
[https://imgur.com/heYxlzQ](https://imgur.com/heYxlzQ)  
---
My son discovered an exploit so I thought I would test a theory to see if tickets were answered in order... nope! In less than 10 minutes the ticket went to under review while my ticket sat like many others.   
---
I'm documenting everything and I know exactly what I have in my inventory because Im a geek and have it on an excel spreadsheet...lol So I know I don't have 100,000 of anything even over the last month total let alone rare items. 
---
I'm not a programmer man, I'm just letting you know that if one your post doesn't show up it's because its stuck in the spam filter. You're not important enough to be censored.
---
I would agree that building multiple bases is a form of duplicating a certain item/structure.  
---
Alright, good information to know. I really appreciate your feedback!
---
it sure does. duped  a shit ton and still not banned
---
I wouldn't qualify those as evidence. afaik, no one ever proved that the trade exploit was fake. same with crafting bans. for all we know, people just got the ban reverted or simply dropped the game.
---
again, **as far as I know**, there wasn't a followup.
---
It's called double entendre my dude. My whole point is that many of these songs have multiple meanings in the context of fallout and were chosen for that reason. I know that I Don't Want To Set The World on Fire is a love song. I do think that the phrase is a little dark in the context of a post-nuclear apocalypse, and I'm pretty sure they intended it that way.
---
What platform 
---
Hunter / hunted is an interesting take on PvP but can be a little bit tedious, and it’s rare anyone participates.
---
Workshop battles are about the only PVP and even then they are rare and usually very one sided. Almost all of my PVP experiences have been attacking random players who are wanted, or defending myself when someone else has instigated PVP.
---
Thank you!
---
Exact kind of reaction you'd expect with a username like that
---
Haha, good try, how's that money EA/UBISOFT SHILL
---
It's one of the odder conspiracy theories I've stumbled across in gaming.
---
"in excess of 100K"...full stop
---
You have to use all your wiles and cunning.
---
So, since you used a pawnshop as an example. I will do that too.
---
Suppose you go to a pawnshop, to buy an item that you KNOW is stolen. There is no question, no doubt that it is stolen. It's ok? Because if you say yes, you're a hypocrite and an idiot. 
---
Because this is exactly what OP did/is doing. He/she looted a bag full of OBVIOUSLY duped items, and then sold them to make a profit. He/she knew what he/she was doing.
---
Keep up the good work Bethesda. Keep banning the scum and losers like this. 
---
Chance are you'll just get a $5 credit to the store for your next account. 
---
Something smells fishy... if they triggered his account, I have to believe he had 100k of something suspicious. 
---
They are so out of touch they don't realise that gamers will no life the shit out of games.
---
I believe you can lock the shutters. Still doesn't do much but it's something. 
---
Luckily I read into it and submitted a ticket.  Then I get an email about being Suspended.  I think if I added up my entire inventory I would have a hard time getting to 100K...  
---
I'm just going to walk around and do nothing
---
What else was there to do in the game? Fight broken scorched queens or farm whitesprings non stop?
---
Yep, Level 220 and I would stream base building...  makes sense right?  PSN: Twitch_COMGUY
---
&gt; Seriously, how does this happen?
---
Somebody decided that the duping issue was serious enough to push out a solution that would require just an insane amount of testing, without the testing.
---
I don't know enough about the issue to say whether this was a good call or a bad call, but it's a legitimate decision someone had to make in a narrow time frame.
---
The unforgivable mistake, in my mind, was assuming that there wouldn't be **any** false positives.  Perma-ban, no appeal.  Whoever made that decision has failed upwards.
---
/r/all
---
You said it 
---
this.
---
Exactly! They say in a future update you may be unbanned, keyword future... doesn’t mean tomorrow’s update! 
---
Fact they don’t tell you and that everyone got the same letter says a lot... they also don’t tell you what you had, just 100,000 rare items... 
---
I’m calling bull... unless they count everything as rare and even if they did I know I have had 100,000 items total in my possession even over 30 days.
---
PC
---
Stay mad white knight. 
---
Ya it increases accuracy and armor penetration with heavy guns WHILE in power armor. That ap is worth it for sure
---
For me, exploring and reading terminals is a lot of fun. There are so many little locations to see. You could have played another game, or gone outside to play like your mom is always telling you to do.
---
So what items did you have 100,000 or more of?
---
Then they need to show me the proof they have, because I guarantee I didn't cheat or dupe
---
Also let's not ignore the role of mine owners and "company stores" in keeping coal miners in poverty. The chorus specifically mentions that for a days hard work you get deeper in debt. Yes, the work was and still is  hard, but that part of the song and it's call back to the reality of exploitation by mine owners can't be ignored.
---
You're turning this into a binary, like some kind of forced decision. Trust this side OR this side. But the community doesn't have to make that kind of choice, I think.
---
In the current situation I don't personally 'trust' or 'distrust' either side. Bethesda issued bans, they fumbled notifications but the rest is common practice. As happens in probably every ban wave, there are people who claim innocence. But if they don't have proof, it's of no more relevance to me than some stranger in the street running up and saying they've been unfairly handled by a business. My response to that would be something like: "I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with me? Do you have any proof?"
---
I think it's only fair I apply \*at least\* the same amount of healthy skepticism online that I apply in real life, when it comes to people I don't know. After all, this is \~reddit\~ on \~the internet\~. :-P
---
However, there are two further points I'd make to nuance my essential view on this whole situation:
---
1. I don't like that the idea of 'final decision, no appeals will be considered'. This seems wrong to me and there should, IMO at least, always be an appeal process. They should be aware that technology isn't perfect and there will likely be innocents who need recourse.
---
2. I'm bothered by gamer tribalism these days. In one sense it's awesome to be alive in modern times, I've never had so much contact with my fellow nerds, but good lord the amount of presumption when it comes to games taste and anti-corporatism can be stifling!
---
How can you gain 100k in 30 days if you haven't played in 30 days?
---
Same. I do this for lots of games I am considering for purchase, just to see what the chatter is for a while to guide my decision. For me it's better than reading through a bunch of reviews. 
---
Salt.
---
Ash just wondering I had someone like that spend half an hour trying to kill me while I was building my base
---
Exactly, I do this and sometimes the question will be something insanely simple like 'I need to know what time you close'. It's just drilled into some people's head that the person answering can't help
---
What were you duping?
---
Exactly!
---
Yeah, they're cheaters.
---
I guess it's because I posted a link and that's my profile pic in the link, I don't know, I didn't post a pic but that picture is my default profile pic
---
If they ban all the players and make the rest quit they won't have to make dlc,they just take our money and run
---
If you reload you are putting a full core in and putting a partial in your inventory. Just use the whole clip.
---
sadly you could earn an xbox live ban for this :(
---
I sell serums. Or used to, until I realized that caps are pointless. It's really easy to get buckets of caps doing this very quickly -- the limit is you can only hold 125k caps on one account. And the thing is, people will often provide the mats in order to absorb the costs, so there really isn't a practical limit to how many serums you can make for people.
---
Serums isn't the only way to make caps either. But personally, I'm sure last month I had over 100k caps come and go from my account. Possibly over 200k caps. No cheating involved at all.
---
So you stole a stack of 100,000 items and are suprised you were thought to be a duper?
---
I’ve been wondering this for sometime now, whenever I go there I hope I can grab all that delicious lead...but I’m always sorely mistaken 
---
I made a bet with a friend over Fallout 76 turning out like this... Looks like it's time to claim my free flat screen TV!
---
__be honest about duping, bruh__
---
You are getting downvoted because you are a moron. Weapons and gear are level limited and you can't craft on an alternate account without learning plans, which you would actually have to find by playing. 
---
Yeah, they literally take no accountability.
---
It is actually because they chose not to listen to the Mothman's wisdom when they made those attempts to cease being Canada.
---
Don't leave the vault...lol
---
Make a game that forces you to trade with others.ban you for being good at trading.
---
Pepper?
---
I really couldn’t care any less. I’m enjoying Anthem. I have no interest in fallout 76 and all its bugs and awful mechanics.
---
Hahaha I follow your stream and when I saw this I laughed so hard.
---
I'm so fucking glad I didn't buy this game.
---
Game has a dwindling player base and is selling so poorly that many stores are trying to dump stock.
---
Bethesda response? BAN THE LEGIT AND DEDICATED PLAYERS.
---
Sucks that this happened to you, thankfully you are quite prominent in the community and will likely get a resolution, but I imagine there will be many other genuine legit players who get banned incorrectly with little to no chance of justice.
---
Have you checked If your account is somekind of compromised? Maybe it got hacked and someone used it to dupe.
---
put me down for the coat tail. and also the doing something wrong. am i doing this right?
---
Would you say 2 is a good medium ?
---
My brother received a banned. Hasn’t played since Christmas. He had a mule with a lot of steel,cement and Stimpacks on it. My brother never duped or bought any items from other players.
---
If I found something my brother wanted I bought or Trade for it for him. Yet he was suspended today.
---
My brother had a lot of steel from workshops and resource spots you could farm with your camp. He had a lot of steel for ammo and camp building. Because he always moves his camp. He always built his camp out of steel.
---
Some innocent people where suspended today.
---
Here is a pic of his suspension email.

Not mad. I'm laughing at the losers getting banned. Also, how am I a white knight? Your comment literally made no sense lol. Try harder. 
---
"If you haven't experienced a bug in f076, you haven't played it enough."
---
Just be careful there s a faction on this sub so dedicated to saying Bethesda was right that they'll pour over your entire Reddit history looking for something to attack you with. 
---
Bethesda's Internet Defense Force 
---
There is no hard evidence if you that what you want, simply the fact that the game was released on three platforms of which two are consoles and that consoles by in large are designed with group play in mind that games that cater for this demographic also do better on consoles and you can tell FO76 was designed for consoles in mind because the exclusion of even a token text chat interface or like how there wasn’t a push to talk feature on release (because consoles already have excellent voice recognition features). 
---
I keep considering downloading it again, and every time I do I come check this sub to see what's up and
---
*Nope*
---
He'll be able to since the ban isn't permanent. I also highly doubt steel was one of the "rare items" that triggered the ban.
---
Oh look a dumbass
---
I’m on ps4 I live alone and I only have 1 ps4 assigned to my account

Thanks, I'll do that!

Just stay in your room.

Still you care enough to make a post.
---
Anthem looks like a good game so far, I enjoyed the VIP demo.
---
You just come by it naturally? Haha
---
They are busy in another thread at the moment, give them time. 
---
Why not just server hop? 
---
Had to be. He has no duped items and never trade for them. All he had was a mule with a lot of carry weight of steel cement and Stimpacks.
---
Can you link the email. There a lot of hearsay going around this sub and some actual proof from the Devs would help clear it up 
---
That's the other end game.
---
All heavy guns suck big time, but energy variants are the worst right now. Both gatling laser and plasma last 1-2 cores max. And the gatling laser does such low damage that it just chews through cores.

He said he’s a solo player

*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** Frankyboy66! ^(hug)

Mail in rebates. Even if you tell people what to do most people won't do it.

Then I’ll respawn back there
---
I was implying that they messed up like they usually do.
---
Sure, you fix the "Feed the People_ bug right after I fall victim to it and accidentally lose two legendary armor pieces and a ton of ammo. 
---
Like the casual players that reported being victims of the non-existent trade bug? Every so-called casual player I've seen say they were banned also admit to picking up enormous stacks of items from paper bags, or trading for likely duped items.
---
As someone who has suffered through Dengue Fever, you're a cruel person for wishing that on anyone.

Lol fallout 76 prison edition!

The kids that die in a game and yell cheater grow up to be dudes who strike out with a lady and call her a lesbian.

I’m so proud of this community

Suck eggs to all the duper’s and people who have ruined the game with there unfair advantages and “legit” level 400 characters.. so full of it. Only got themselves to blame.  Thank you Bethesda!
---
Cool, hit me up as well. KR1Sone87
---
Not caring about this game doesn’t equate to calling out one of my favorite studios on their bullshit
---
So you have nothing better to do and you dug up someone's Reddit history. I know it's presidents day but you have school tomorrow.
---
Let them, I have nothing to hide
---
Me neither, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if some of the caps or materials accepted in trade by dedicated traders initially came from dupers.
---
CenturyLink, when you call customer service, just say “Send me to retentions”, the rep has no options, and must immediately transfer you, and can be fired to even trying to rebuttal the caller. Retentions can make the best cuts to your phone/internet/TV prices, immediately dispatch techs, cancel bills, etc.
---
Every company’s CS has magic words.
---
Yes, but there's a chance there won't be 3 SBs and a pack of mutants camped on the spawn. 
---
Since a lot of people with high hours and levels are reporting getting banned, just checked and my account is not banned. ~480hrs and lvl260.
---
I've never duped but I do tend to pick up everything and sort it out later. That includes paper bags lying around at Whitespring, which I Take All from and then move anything I can't use to the ice cooler for others to find in one place. I did pick up a ton of aluminum in this way once (~10,000 if I recall correctly) which I assume was duped, and I dumped it.
---
I've also crafted tons of ammo and rarely drop any; thus have probably approached 100,000 total inventory items at one point or another as a result. I know I had over 25k in Prime 50cal rounds alone, which I crafted myself (not all at once). All this to say that you CAN have tons of items, somewhat high hours and level, and not get banned.
---
One thing I have not ever done is use a mule character. I think that's bypassing inventory restrictions obviously intended to be part of the game. Not that I'd necessarily agree with banning players for using mules (and I doubt that is or ever will be BGS policy), but I'm totally against mules and would just like to point out that I've never used one and I also happen to be having no problems. Even though I almost certainly picked up duped items ar least once (aluminum).
---
I'd bet it was the stimpacks, not steel or concrete.
---
This is quite interesting 
---
same category 
---
Completely random thought that just occurred to me, but I just remembered that there have been reports of a bug where players were randomly burdened with massive amounts of a resource (like the maximum amount the game can process), perhaps this could be attributed to the bans? 
---
Not possible if you loot everything you kill. You may not know it, but you've definitely had more than 10k steel go through your character if you're lvl 109. Unless you don't break down looted weapons. Steal scrap is the biggest scourge on my inventory. Every few days I have to bundle it all up and sell it, or Im hitting my weight limit. I'm not lvl 109 yet, I only sell steel when it's over a 1000, and I've definitely had to do it more than ten times. Do you by by any chance, only quest and never loot?
---
It would be a different story if you logged in and were banned though, wouldn't it?
---
Yes, usually. 
---
900 hours and you STILL wanna play? take the break they gave you
---
Yes usually.
---
You do realize mods are coming when we get private servers right? Like mods aren't a question, just a question of when. Originally they mentioned private servers near the end of the year, but I'm willing to bet they'll push it sooner to reclaim player base since mods and private servers are probably the two things players want the most.
---
He crafted Stimpacks...and then diluted then. You also get a lot Stimpacks from the Queen and events.
---
You fucking pathetic moron. Are you that fucking stupid to believe no one would check your post history. This is Reddit jackass. That’s the first we do. You’re a dupper and got caught. See ya. 
---
Got it
---
The serum prices are exactly what I wrote...? Think you mis-read my post, haha.
---
the same could be said about people taking a company on their word
---
I commented on ur last post. It was fkn awesome. I heard somewhere that trading over 100k items will trigger ban also.that includes every round of ammo and every piece of scrap. So I assume it's triggered through  moving items between mule/main and back again.
---
So this is how you get un-banned and or looked into why your banned to begin with. Go on social media and get 6,500 point thread going? Fascinating.
---
I missspoke, er, wrote - I meant something like Champyrus.
---
Idk, the trading explanation makes a lot of sense to me so your argument about the amount of hours needed to play to obtain 100k of an item doesn’t necessarily hold water. I’m not saying you’re wrong and the OP and others didn’t dupe, but I don’t think it’s fair to their character to claim that, especially given the lack of a clear response from BGS about the specifics imo. 
---
How is this still happening?
---
Ooooooo. Burn.
---
&gt;You intentionally broke the rules. 
---
Y'know there's a reason we don't give the death sentance for littering.
---
So this is how you get un-banned and or looked into why your banned to begin with. Go on social media and get 6,500 point thread going? Fascinating.  
---
There also aren't as many people playing anymore. I stopped in January. I played through all of Christmas and finished basically everything except for getting all the plans and atomic shop stuff. Grinding is okay, but it's better when you know what to expect. Since the legendaries are completely random, you can't really search for the one you want and work towards it. The most you can do is try to trade for it. So basically you run out of things to do.
---
You were talking about serum recipes, I was stating that they cost 16k for a serum recipe. Typically you can buy serums from players who have most of the plans for like 250-500 caps each(at least that’s there value on the market)
---
How much Ultracite ammo did you have?
---
This one makes me chuckle.

I'm sure these were legitimately farmed, lol.

Your addition to the conversation "Have several you don’t that are 3 star/higher than what you have here. Interested in trade message Twitch_COMGUY"
---
Also, I bet yours were all legitimately farmed.
---
You get a list of weapons bigger than that through just a bit of base building?

"Yeah, they literally take no accountability."

Yeah, keep telling yourself that sparky.

These aren't independent, hand-off, companies.  They are all divisions of Zenimax Media, all published by Bethesda Softworks - who are Zenimax Media in all but name.

Saw it the same day I saw the moth man for the first time shortly after seeing the moth man at that.   Basically saw the moth man at Charleston fast traveled to whitesprings and saw the flat woods monster there.   Only seen both that one time in 400 hrs.  This was after patch 5 but before the hot fix, not sure if it had something to do with the stealth issue?
---
He made it pretty clear that he doesn't dupe or otherwise cheat, so that's not happening.
---
I was at missile silo Charlie and for the life of me i couldn't get to where i needed to go without lock pick max and or hacker max(which i don't have). Luckily some random players in the mid 100 level hit me up and came and picked the lock,and escorted me. It got real though as the level of robots and amount exponentially increased(assuming due to them twice my level).  I'm not going in that silo alone anymore without at least max lock pick.  Idk if it was honestly even possible felt like i did ten circles tediously with no other route in sight. 
---
Edited the OP with the most recent email I received and my theory behind the bans.
---
I should reinstall and try to login. I never duped purposefully, but I suspect that I've been traded a duped item before and I know that my camp was duplicating itself at one point. 
---
Not bigger, but better.  And White Springs was not an exploit
---
Honestly, by level 30 I started getting really picky about what I picked up.  I really didn't collect a bunch of weapons to scrap because they weigh too much, and why waste time with that shit when you could just keep fighting things?  Just my philosophy, but I would have thought everyone would eventually become selective about what they pick up. 
---
So, by your own admission, you just blindly support one side?
---
that wasn't me it was my little borther
---
Yes, this wouldn't be a sarcastic post
---
the only thing i'm guilty is for having like 2k crops from the workshop lol
---
It doesn't say in "the last" 30 days. We'll see an official report by Bethesda tomorrow, and I'll bet it's the same as the previous one: These players are full of shit and cheaters. Did you notice that last time, not a *single* one of them refuted the claim?
---
The elder one isn’t rare, it’s impossible to obtain outside of dev room access. 
---
&gt; Well, Bethesda apparently seems to think that it is. Why do you think enemies are bullet sponges? Why did they nerf TSE? Because Bethesda thinks everybody deserves a chance to tag enemies in order to get the loot. 
---
Umm... I don't think it because of that. I would have thought it was to slow progression down an be a resource sink for bullets, repair mats etc. whilst giving a false elevated sense of difficulty with the least amount of effort required.
---
Just because people have enough time to tag is at best a bi-product.
---
Neither of us know for certain but the way I see it makes the most sense to me. I mean if what you said was true, teams would all share XP from kills in the area (which they don't) and loot drops would lean to sharing, which not only do they not do with fallen enemies, they've explicitly taken that away from supply drops and rewards for the Feed the People quest.
---
The evidence just isn't there to support your point of view, unless you have something I've missed.
---
&gt;Yes, in competent development companies. Its become pretty clear that BA are building those tools still.
---
&gt;Ad Hominem. Cute
---
OMG - you don't know what an Ad Hominem is?  In 2019?  When Wikipedia's right there?
---

---
There you go.
---
Bu-bye.
---
&gt;In a defense case like this the first step is not to 'prove a negative', but to provide alternate explanations or reasoning/evidence to compromise the accusation itself, which would constitute proof of innocence (i.e. 'in their defense'). For example, one dude I was just replying to claims he uses 3 accounts at once to farm, so he could point that out as proof that it's possible for him to get so many rare items without duping.
---
I'm c/ping this from the first post of mine you replied to. 
---
If the person can't provide some kind of proof they're not a duper, they're out of luck. That's just the way it is no matter how you or I feel about it. No dev company would accept "I'm innocent" as a valid reason to lift a ban, and to be honest, most players would agree (technically we all do when we accept the TOS).
---
Banned here  also .... I bought caps from mmoko  ...

You were saying? Lmao. Caught a liar red handed. Enjoy that ban, good sir. Too bad it's not permanent.
---
If I prove your 30 days comment wrong will you admit to being a shill?
---
Hahahahahaha I always wondered why I never had any when I know I picked some hahahaha 
---
So stable you could balance a newborn on them
---
No, you find in a few locations such as a Train station in the ash heap. Just not buildable at a camp, much like the like harmonica-like instrument
---
Oh, well I was talking about finding a recipe, but I wasn't going to sell THAT. I already learned it. I was talking about making and selling the serums. I made one reaction serum for myself already. Speaking of which, I have enough stable flux to make about 6 more. Selling Adrenal serums for...ehhh...450 caps? Any takers? lol
---
How can I become invisible while crouching and moving?(does it work in PA?)
---
I found it before. Is that the one south of Vault 76?
---
It was pretty good to play. I'd like it if we could have it in CAMP.
---
PSN exilefalcontr01
---
First, I'm usually long winded, but wow. Secondly, like far too many players you seem to latch on to the idea that your ideas are better than theirs, when in reality your ideas wouldn't make most people happy (thinking of the last 100 people who think this was a "build your own game" with a million ideas).
---
Mods can change pretty much anything I've seen suggested, the biggest failure on Bethesdas part was not having private servers and mods available much closer to release, like around now.. rather than the end of the year.
---
Getting back to your post though, sitting there and really focusing on the main thing you want to say will make it easier for someone else to both read and respond to your thoughts.. if it becomes a discussion then the million other things you wanted to bring up may come up as part of the discussion.
---
Just friendly feedback since you're all over the place and it's hard to decide in what you said is worth replying to, and which part.
---
He didn't dupe?
---
GTFO, if that really is true. You can thank him and Give him a beating every day you can’t play. 
---
chamelon armor.
---
U become visible while moving, but u do not appear on the radar or map while moving.
---
We all did
---
Apparently [it is happening](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ron-Paul_Its-Happening1.gif).
---
&gt;Well....except for this one, teensy little time...and my friend only gave me ONE duped item...". It would seem Bethesda's detection system is working. 
---
Except for people that haven't been banned who have the exact same weapons/armor etc as others who have been banned...
---
Ha! It's funny when they can't take the heat they try to deal, most likely he was picked on or still is...lol
---
It takes me off the map if I’m in it???
---
I don't understand why they still aren't getting this right. 800 stash simply isn't enough. I currently have 2 million weight on my character and 671000 in my stash. Why do they think that 800 is even a feasible number? Stash needs to either be made infinite or made to go up to 2,671,000 so I can fit my items. 
---
No explanation? They got them.  They duped. 
---
Radworms has changed certain effects since last patch. Screws with mutation buffs and some other random stuff. Lockpick level 4 anyone. 
---
Do you have a mule character? You probably passed 100k worth of ammunition
---
Well deserved ban!
---
you dont have to physically have 100,000 of something on you at the one time.
---
Its over a 30 day period, so you might of met a duper and picked his bag up and had 10's of thousands of junk or something as this will contribute to the total of 100,000.
---
I understand people saying i didnt do anything but this is over a month period so most people dont remember every detail of what they picked up or crafted for 30 days.
---
So in conclusion dont say i got banned and i didnt do anything wrong without proof!..
---
Too much hear say this and that :).
---
I think you missed something in the OP:
---
&gt;Bear in mind this is coming from someone who intentionally uses a lower powered weapon for events with legendary enemies so other people can have a chance to get a hit in. 
---
So choosing to underpower myself intentionally is "less than friendly"?
---
I'm just saying I don't feel entitled to legendaries that I miss or whinge about missing out on them when people one-shot them away.
---
ur icon doesn't show on the map if ur crouched.
---
and it doesn't appear on the radar if ur crouched with chameleon

Thanks.
---
You mentioned in a post 19 days ago that mule accounts have been comprised, if you had one with a lot of weight on it after the upper cap was put in place it might’ve been because of that.
---
They haven't made a statement on these claims yet...
---
They did you a favor. Imagine playing 900 hours for a shit game 
---
what?
---
exactly my thoughts OP love your work.
---
people need to read and see thats its 100,000 of items over 30days which no person can prove they didnt do as who holds 30 days of records for a game you just cant.
---
So Bethesda we believe you and love you.
---
Dont be discouraged be encouraged 
---
Warframe is a good game, I played for 6 months b4 I got bored.
---
This failure of a game helped me quit video games. 
---
I’m so grateful 
---
Damn. This is awesome. do I need a full set?
---
The point is he didn’t dupe
---
Shitty range and the scope is eh? What’re you comparing it to?
---
just 1 piece
---
you are banned, there's nothing you can do about that.   
---
once code of conduct is breached rightfully or not, that's you done.

No matter how many support tickets you make they will eventually get closed.

Intelligence affects XP gain, and durability of equipment you craft. Charisma affects buy/sell prices, maximum perk card value you can share (1 star per 3 charisma), and (rumoredly) value of quest rewards. What that even means or if it’s even true is anyone’s guess.  Maybe you get more caps from quests *shrug*
---
Doesn't .50 craft 100 at a time?  
---
For me tge game was nothing like this sub made it seem to be.
---
Check your reading comprehension. It still says "within 30 days of game play" and not "the last 30 days." Plus, not for nothing, but even if it did, I still wouldn't necessarily believe you didn't play since December just based on your word. All of these posts blur together to look and sound almost exactly the same.
---
You duped or profited from it. Bye bye!!!
---
I'm constantly over my carry weight, but that has more to do with fact that I compulsively pick up every piece of junk, any ammo, and all the chems I find.
---
yeah hes dead now so he cant really do those things to my accounts anymore. I miss him :'(
---
Maybe you should vote with your wallet and stop supporting EA and EA Lite (Bethesda) altogether?

Also, yes. You could. And I would.
---
Lol BIDF in full force. Your comment sounds like it's scripted like all the other bots saying the same thing. Bye-Bye

Yes please! Such effects would really add a nice touch, show attention to detail, and make Appalachia--or rather its population--a more diverse, interesting view demanding more double-take and warranting a lot more screenshots haha.
---
Why did you have to call them a she? I envisioned myself cock punching them for making me read such a self absorbed self righteous diatribe.. and here you are, just taking away my vision of punching one in their cock.

How dare you sir/madam.

Edit: added /madam
---
Not to people who are *actually* innocent.
---
I was just on a server last night where someone dropped 3 nukes in a row. First kill was less than 5 minutes (I wasn’t paying attention), next 2 were under 3 (last one, timer was at 28:30, and once she landed she went from from 90% to dead in ~10 seconds). 5-7 level 10p+ players, mix of rifles, HW, and melee. No idea how many were working together; it didn’t seem like there was a specific group, maybe 1-3 players with the nuker, I couldn’t tell. 
---
PC. 
---
Lol what a shit company.  God the industry is fucked.  
---
I don't have a mule, I haven't needed one
---
I mean, if you are a heavy weapons build, you kinda do. Keystone HW perk requires PA.
---
Word of advice don’t use your mic. Even turn it off in game if you use chameleon armor. It will give away your position as it pops in and out over your head 👍🏻
---
!remindme in 1 week
---
I wish they had a place on the map for you guys to pvp to your heart's desire so I can make some bullets in peace. 😋
---
I have **zero** faith in Betheadas ability to detect and ban people without affecting innocent people who never duped.
---
They can barely patch this game without accidently uploading a previous version (Bobby pin fiasco)
---
What makes you so sure everyone is guilty, OP?
---
Even the 900 hours guy who spent all his time making guides of farm locations to help the community?
---
I’ll see you in time.
---
I’m with you, and the rad resistant helps with someone busts out the gamma gun. Combat armor doesn’t have natural rad resist.
---
You might want to go through your post history and delete some of your posts and comments, by the way. You're full of shit and it's on full display. You've played (relatively often, too) in the past month alone.
---
Go dilute another community with your worthless presence.
---
Pretty much gonna let Bethesda sort it out. I mean, that’s kind of what they’re supposed to do. Not like we can make a fo76court.
---
Seems he'd been playing the game within the last 30 days as well.
---
They’ve made a couple, first was saying that the error is related to exploits, 100000 items etc, basically the same thing we’ve got in the emails.
---
Second was from one of the CMs asking the 900 hours player for their ticket so it can be investigated.
---
The latter was made a few hours after the former, assuming that the single request is part of a larger investigation on mistakenly banned players we could see these suspensions restored. 
---
Me following the games updates means I’m playing the game?
---
Where I work, specialized department in large corporate, asking to escalate the ticket does nothing because trust me, we just want the problem solved too. The correct management and leadership has already been engaged on the back end to resolve as soon as physically possible.
---
Clients that repeatedly break chain of command when their issue is being taken care of as fast as possible in the best possible way - there's tracking for that, and if the amount of man hour time you're costing the company is no longer reasonable from a profitability angle...measures get taken.
---
And all of your tickets you've ever had are permanently in your profile, seeing a 3 - 6 month tenure with 100 tickets already..not a good look. Word gets around the department, and it's best to have the lowest exposure possible, not "that guy".
---
My two cents.
---
wrote?
---
Try cities skylines. It's a great time waster!
---
In my job, if someone asks to escalate, they get to talk to another person at the same level as me, who will say "yes, I am a supervisor" and will give the exact same level of support as I would have given them.  There are very few reasons we will bother a supervisor to talk to a customer, that rarely come up, and demanding a supervisor with no further information given is not one of them. The person you talk to will be less motivated to be helpful (because they are having to deal with a difficult customer) but rest assured, you're going to annoy the first person you talked to because they're going to have to teen the favor by taking the next "I demand a supervisor" caller that the "supervisor" gets.

You sure you aren’t a chinese bot?

Another comment about TSE and other nerfs and their effect on the game.

Looks like another lying POS looking for pity and attention.

Good riddance, OP

 See,  Bethesda is screwing this one up
---
Lmfao
---
I’ve heard that not fully looting a body causes server lag and instability, not sure if this is true but it’s a major part of why I loot everything, scrap and drop.. and like In most fallout games I’m a bit of a hoarder 
---
&gt; I don’t really care because I don’t play fallout 76 but how can your anticheat be this fucking terrible? 
---
If you didn't really care, would you just not have posted about it?
---
OP updated the post.
---
Never did I claim that I haven't played in the last month. Going though someone's post history is funny. Really need to prove your point.
---
I got the invisible power armor bug.   Treated it like I had "Creepy slender disease" or whatever.  I made sure to emote to everyone I came across, the long limb waves were bizarre.
---
I'll reply later, I'm at Panda Express rn
---
Serves you right for playing their shit game
---
How do you know that? Are you all knowing? Are you on the payroll? Is Bethesda infallible?
---
Why dont they perma ban if they think it's an exploit? Instead only until the bug is fixed? Bethesda is too generous
---
Sell me your game lol
---
Depends on if you've got an explosive shotgun or not. 2 for a non-explosive, but only 1 if you want a nice cone of splash damage.
---
I'm surprised you can't mess with other people's stats and stuff like Dark Souls 3 and get people banned that way.
---
Making a post saying that you were playing with your friends does
---
Lol are you going for a gold award at shilling?
---
Bethesda let duping go on for so long, you're most likely right -- duped stuff was assimilated into the economy. But that's far different from thinking that someone who has made more than 100k caps in a month is most likely duping or that a high cap transaction involves knowingly duped items and/or caps.  Heck, I spent 50k caps in a transaction back when I started buying serum recipes. It's possible the recipes were duped, but I don't think so for a few reasons.
---
However, if someone is a dedicated farmer, you can make 6k per day if you have 5 characters doing the sales rounds, especially if you can make the witch's outfit.
---
When Bethesda said that to use a caracter like a legit mule is a bannable act? Link, please...
---
Shill scum.
---
They banned you for having a mule guys it’s not 100k items on you it’across all chars if u was in beta and stock piled bulk resources like steel,copper,etc even if u got rid of all of it right before the purge *aka I did “it wasn’t hard to get loads of resources when game first came out.* they still banned my account because I had so much in the last 30 days between all 5 chars
---
Are you a mind reader or...?
---
where is it?
---
Same as the ones at the top of the monorail elevator  😡
---
Pretty sure I picked up some duped aluminum once while indiscriminately taking all from various bags (take all now, sort later) ar Whitespring. Otherwise, yeah I'm happy to have played the way I believe the game was intended to be played.
---
What I'm more proud of than not taking duped stuff though, is not using a mule account. I see that as bypassing inventory restrictions obviously intended to be part of the game. Unpopular opinion, but I'm totally against it and I think it matters.
---
I’ve enjoyed your posts and found them helpful. I hope you can return soon
---
yeah, normally when there is a ban wave I assume the relatively small amount of the community that cries got banned for a reason, but in this case there are way too many posts for that to be the case, plus the track record on this game is shit...
---
That’s what they told me in reply email
---
Agreed.
---
Bahaha everyday it’s bans and griefers. We need new content to talk about 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
You said you played with your friends on your reddit post. People aren't blind you know
---
Partially the same response..  
---
Scripting is my weakest area, and there are still a number of unknown variables in the ESM, which would/could make the interpretation off...  
---
Though someone may have, but I've not seen it shared yet...    
---
And....   
---
We know (and Bethesda has said) some of the data is Server side only, unlike FO4), so we are working partially blind.
---
I don't see how what you said applies to what I said. They said what the bans were for, then they told someone who said they were innocent to send them his info so they could investigate. How is this a problem? Are you assuming that they want to ban their fans? Are you assuming that they don't care and are more than willing to drive a game they invested millions in into the ground? Are you assuming that they won't actually do anything? If you do, then there is nothing anyone can say to you.

I can go to West Tek and the black water mine and walk away with 1.5k steel easily especially when participating in events like uranium fever. That takes me about 30min because of how I’m specced and OP weapons. The fact that other people might be more efficient/have different play styles than you shouldn’t be that surprising. If you want proof go do that run I described, loot everything and scrap it.. trust me you’ll have more steel than you know what to do with.. also other mats that you do need.
---
A guy I know that we use to play with deployed after Christmas and no he can't or hasn't logged in... he got an email saying he was banned and no one used his account.

There are plenty of anti griefing and bounty hunter discord groups. Send them a message with the GT and proof of griefing and they’ll sort them out.

But proof is needed. Otherwise they won’t risk their rep incase someone is trolling an innocent player.

&gt; Trade: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.
---
The patch notes don't just call out item theft ("trade without consent") but confirms the accounts of people being able to view your inventory without you knowing. Literally it's the two steps described in accounts of the exploit.
---
Whoo hoo, thanks devs and Ladydevann!
---
There's several updates coming with new content, called would Appalachia or some such? But it's supposed to include weekly updates, with a roadmap to finally be released right before that.
---
I don't know if the experience on PC has gotten better, but I know on console it's been pretty rock solid for a while now.
---
That said, there's hundreds of locations worth finding and exploring, content a lot of players skipped (namely the ones that think doing nukes daily to power level was what the game was about) or just assumed wasn't worth doing.
---
Anyways, to the point, I imagine this new content will be for higher level players, but perhaps I'm wrong. I'm burnt out as I'm sure many others are, but that doesn't mean there isn't a few weeks worth of stuff to explore until this new content comes out..
---
Just saying, I'm sure you can get this game dirt cheap at this point, but if future content actually ends up being decent that may not always be the case.
---
Besides, maybe you'll end up on your very own server! 😋🤣 But seriously, if you were waiting for a certain time, in case the new content requires a higher level, now is the time.. by this time next week you could be the one posting how you've gotten banned! 😍

The crafted drink counts for that perk, basicly any food or drink with a condition bar is effected by good with salt, belive even uncooked meat and picked fruit and vegetables 
---
I’m coming from /r/all. I was really excited for this game when it was originally announced but I never hear anything good about the game.  Didn’t buy it because of all the bad consumer reviews. Hoping their next attempt goes better..
---
I believe some got banned that either duped or picked up duped stuff not knowing but no way does this account for everyone. I think the algorithm they used to fish for these is broken to the net cast too far.   
---
They ban everyone then later release the ones that aren't bad with no remorse on any action taken.  
---
This is way too long of a post given how trivial this all really is. I think I need a break from video game subreddits. Y’all take this shit far too seriously. 
---
This 100%.
---
Why would I delete ? I haven’t played in over a month and I was banned for something I never did? 
---
It’s morons like you that will keep this train wreck burning on and on until Bethesda is a meme beyond measure
---
I have no idea what the circumstances of these other people might be. How they acquired their items, anything. As such, I cannot really provide a reason for this. Maybe these "people" had legit gear? Maybe the banhammer is just pending, and they are going to get their ban in the next wave? Impossible to say. But a lot of people who feel they were unjustly banned are admitting they had some dealings with dupers or the items they duplicated, even if accidentally, so it stands to reason the real deal malicious cheaters are getting slammed right now. So it IS undoubtedly being quite effective at weeding out cheaters.
---
Did you not read what my post was in reference to?
---
Doesn’t the ban also effect you Bethesda.net account and lock you out of ALL of your Bethesda games?  If so, I’d be pissed off too. 
---
Rad worms are currently giving super powers by boosting all consumable effects, mutations and some perks (what's amazing in PvP, but don't tell anyone)

---
Whattatool. My friends didn’t quit because they’re incapable. They quit because of the crappy unstable gaming experience brought on by you dupers.  
---
Denial, not just a river in Egypt.
---
You seem to struggle with logic and facts. So I’ll reiterate in simpler terms.
---
ZeniMax and Bethesda the game manufacturer are gunning for dupers, they’ve had enough crap from people talking crap, and from people doing crap on their gaming platform. They’re taking names and kicking butt.
---
ZeniMax is owned by Bethesda, they both control the game access and user experience. 
---
What you and other dupers have done wasn’t just exploit a gaming platform, you profited from everyone’s misery. 
---
You’re the reason why The gaming experience was horrible for everyone, and you broke their terms of service, licensing agreement.  You profited and ruined people’s perception of the game and financially impacted a company’s revenue stream If you STILL hadn’t guessed yet that your actions have consequences, consider this a teaching moment.
---
Put simply, if you’re dirty, you’re out.  You may think you have dodged that bullet but with each passing patch, but it’s not question of WHY, but a matter of WHEN.
---
You can cry, and whine and beg but you know you’re guilty.  WE know you’re guilty. COWBOY the hell up, and take your lumps with dignity and with grace.   
---
Or not, and cry / scream  FAKE banned accounts, that you’re a victim of crappy software. I know you hope that saying it over repeatedly will create doubt or pity. Continue denying the damage you’ve inflicted, accountability and transparency is for chumps. 
---
But with each pass of dupers getting banned,  the environment and gaming experience continues to improve. So, whether you agree what Bethesda is doing right or not is irrelevant. Your choice to play has been removed.
---
FWIW, Those of us who got griefed by dupers with TSEs. We, who didn’t dupe, or buy duped items will keep playing. 
---
Finally a suggestion there’s this line from an old song..
---
An honest mans pillow is his piece of mind.  If you don’t lie, your story never needs changing. It’s always consistent with verifiably proven facts. 
---
Would be awesome if they were interested in enhancing the experience in any way!

Just because you weren't playing doesn't mean you weren't carrying massive amount. You got a bit too greedy and didn't dump yo stuff

---
It’s called we ban you so we can make up list profit margins want to play? Buy a new copy I don’t support that business model
---
So you can increase your stash limit by paying $$$?  Sounds pay 2 win to me 😉.   It doesn't matter whether it's done on the same account via 3rd party/ container or a 2nd account it's still bypassing the limit.   So to me it's an exploit and it will stay an exploit in my mind unless Bethesda explicitly states it's okay.
---
29 days ago and you said you didn't play since December. LIAR
---
Right, at my work we sort tickets by "last updated" and work oldest to newest.  If you submit a new request, that updates your ticket, which moves you to the back of the queue.
---
Another thing people do that screws them over is that we request you put the date of your service on the ticket.  The highest priority tickets are those that are due today, then tomorrow, etc.  Way lower in priority are those with past dates, because they've already missed their appointment without being helped, it's not time sensitive now.  Past date tickets get worked on sporadically when everything else is caught up.
---
What happens is someone whose appointment is a week from now enter today's date to get served faster.  This is very risky because if it's very busy that day there's a good chance we won't get to you in time - almost all requests are for something a week or more out, we make it clear that our turnaround time on email is 72 hours and you should call in, not email, if it needs to be handled today.  So, a couple of weeks later we're catching up on past date tickets that we weren't able to get to (because submitted at last minute and we were working the ones that were submitted earlier first), and we see in the body "my appointment is actually next week but I'm really important so I put today's date." If they had put the real date, they would have been helped a long time ago as they contacted us a week in advance.
---
Why do the posts with the best ideas get so few upvotes? 
---
They never used the word “error.”
---
32 days ago,
---
You’re blind
---
the point is that only a fool would trust a corporation regardless of the matter.
---
a vast array of npcs there are!
---
Lol, I had that, too. Terrifying!
---
They replied asking for a PM with ticket number, that's all.
---
Can you imagine the screenshots!!! Hahaha
---
🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Wow so I’m sooo sorry I stopped playing in January instead. I’m mistaken, that doesn’t make you any less pathetic.
---
I never even ventured in White Springs till I was over level 30 for that very reason.
---
how did he write to you? fuck
---
...no, I believe they will do something, I know that they didn’t want to ban their fans that didn’t deserve it, and they are definitely trying to make the game better.
---
I was just responding to you saying that they haven’t made a statement on it yet with what they have said so far.
---
How do you lock the terminal itself?
---
damn bethesda, dump some tses into this dudes account.
---
Again, did you not read what my post was in reference to?
---
Idk if they'll lock characters to servers. as alot of ppl dont wanna start over at lvl 1 from 250+(I'm lvl 74atm). And yes I think survival  will be hard for everyone hopefully, not jus noobs. But a fresh start would be most fair. Survival mode is what my eye is on but I'm actuallybeondering what kind of quests and event and new PVE stuff will be comin too. I hope it's a bit more engaging than press button go to next location press button. Something with choices n consequences like old fallout stuff. Dont get me wrong I think fo76 is my favorite fallout jus because of the threat other players bring. I'm wanted alot jus so ppl come to hunt me lol
---
Theeeeee number ONE choice of every hungry Chinese bot! Accept no substitute for low budget chinee food.
---
Come in TODAY for limited-time bleak fortune cookies! It’s funny cause some of them are true!
---
Bethesda has provided multiple games I've enjoyed (Oblivion, Skyrim, New Vegas, and Fallout 4). And even games made by studios under their umbrella have been great (Doom 2016 and Prey, I'm looking at you).
---
What have these "actual" players done for me to make me trust them? 
---
If that is the case then I doubt that every single tse/aae/sentinal assassin armor that is still being advertised on reddit for sale was found legitimately. They all came from same source.
---
I have never duped (believe that or not I dont care but it's the truth). I collect and hoard items yes, I buy/trade with alot of people for items yes. Sure those items were dupes at one stage or another, but those are the same items being sold by players at this very moment on reddit etc. They have not been banned. 
---
I know players who openly have admitted to duping who are still online after this ban wave, and also know many players that are either new to game (below level 50 with only one character) and experianced at over level 200 playing legitimately who have been banned. It just doesn't make sence. 
---
In no way am I defending dupers, and ofcorse I'm prepared for downvotes.
---
No it won't get you banned, they specifically targetted certain items when looking at banning people, ammunition is not one of the things they looked at. 
---
You mean I might get back my 10% budget for my dead pet frog tomorrow?! 
---
*For the drama* 
---
Correction then: They haven't made a statement on the individual claims made on this reddit that they were unfairly banned.
---
Oh gotcha
---
yeah, that was already pointed out. I just assumed they were publicly traded since most of the big names are. 
---
again, does it matter at all?
---
You can easily be just as tanky and way more tanky in a regular armor build of full sentinel, cavalier, bolstering, or vanguard armor. With the right perk cards of course.
---
I use a full sentinel build and also run bloodied and stay around 30% health and use serendipity rank 3. I can tank the queen and a handful of her enemies at a time and be fine. It’s all in the build my friend.
---
Did you know that alot of dupers didnt get these bans and alot of legit honest players did? 
---
His posts get an automatic upvote, and whoever he's arguing with get 2 downvotes. He's the one using multiple accounts. Report him to [/r/Reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit.com) in a PM.
---
Well it shows up as 29 days to me. and still, you lied. Glad you got banned. Last thing this subreddit needs is liars
---
On a serious note, I've gotten the majority of my equipment from other people offloading their unwanted items to vendors. I have very little luck with farming. 
---
Yes, because I generally agree with you.
---
Ahh now I get it. How did the griefer txt OP in game. Must be a console thing. We don’t have that on PC. 
---
I believe it might, the only "ludicrous" amount of items I have/had is ammo, crafted from items I collected myself in game with no duping, yet ban hammer got me. 
---
I'm 5 years in and still enjoying it. Would recommend trying it out. Even if you cbf trying to grind to 'end game' (there's no end game) the gameplay is really fun. just be ready to invest half of your first hundred hours into reading the wiki.
---
I got Egghead. 
---
Did you know alot of dupers got these bans and only a few honest players got caught up in it? (see I can make claims too)
---
I’ve seen a ton of people get banned on this game in waves.  I’ve never duped and probably only traded a dozen times.  I’ve never held all those weapons, but the ones I had I know would get dudes attention.  I have 600+ hours in the game, I’ve met tons of people (some duper’s who rightfully got banned) and grinded and traded my ass off for gear.  As I submitted to Bethesda, check my character history and inventory.  There’s nothing crazy about it, I also don’t have any sub characters either (meaning no account mules).  
---
uWuWuWuWu
---
I’m skeptical myself. I think it happens without a doubt that innocence got banned, but I believe that’s  a very  slim minority
---
A quick check of past posts quickly eliminates most of these complaints 
---
Never debated FONV had bugs. I loved it, but it was a mess on launch.
---
As for FO76 having a future...believe it when I see it.
---
Lmao I feel ya.
---
I have a feeling that the "fix" won't be coming in this patch since it says "a future patch" in the email. And why would they go through all the trouble to suspend people for one day?
---
Just wanted to throw this out, Bethesda doesn't have shareholders in the way you're thinking of. They're a private company, not a public one, so they can operate however they want without really caring.
---
Well apparently a lot of the "bans" are suspensions so it's likely to be temporary.
---
Drinks are the same they wil not spoil with the perk
---
I know, but I would rather have a place separate for pvp. You can't make fusion cores or ammo without possible pvp, and for me, that sucks.
---
Sure.  
---
Hey I suggest you try repeating what he did and try getting all lawyered w/Bethesda to get them on a technicality. You know like them old movies where the hero at last minute screams, A HA! pulls a save.
---
I wasn’t carrying jack shit because I basically didn’t know how to play the game 
---
Everyone can make claims agreed. There is just more then one side to this issue atm. 
---
If dupers have been banned (which some have), then great.
---
If honest people have been banned (which some have), then something is wrong.
---
"I've seen TSAA, BAA, AAE"
---
Probably should ask mommy for tips on lying better. 
---
WTF?!
---
Just keep an eye out for the shills. They will reveal themselves.
---
But you DID play....
---
I feel ya. 90% of the time I never have any pvp in workshops so it's not as common as it could be
---
Are you on Xbox? If so I'm pretty sure I saw your GT awhile ago and got a good chuckle out of it
---
Suspended * for having things I didn’t have. 
---
It’s cool you wanna shill for this dumpster fire to make yourself feel like a hero go ahead.  
---
Many of them are banned too, read the forums. There are *tons* of these posts.
---
Also, not to be a dick, but your son got what he had coming because it's pretty evident that he knew what he was doing.
---
I thoroughly recommend the remake of Resident Evil 2. It is bloody amazing. They did an outstanding job both making it up to date with current controls and engine, as well as staying true to the old school survival horror that Resident Evil used to be.
---
   I love Fallout 76 and enjoy it as well, but since I was gifted this game and basically forced into playing it (I had no plans to get it as I was still enjoying 76, and I am looking foreward to Anthem, Outer Worlds, and Sekiro: shadows die twice.) I haven't been able to get back into Fallout 76. I am waiting for PvP servers to play again now. 
---
  Eventhough RE2 remake is a single player experience, and not an overly long campaign, it has alot of replay value, there are 4 different main campaigns, then several bonus modes. Capcom even released a free DLC adding more new  scenarios a couple days ago!
---
 Tldr, Resident Evil 2 remake is a fantastic game bringing me feelings of nostalgia from childhood as well as legitimately giving me a constant adrenaline fix while playing. It's a damn tense game.
---
They should have made the effort to suspend players for their current inventory....not 100k for any given 30 day period....it was crazy times during the high dupping period....many players would have picked up things without even thinking or thought it was no big deal....but then later corrected their inventory etc.....it’s a game not real life. This game shows less tolerance than real life....but I think that’s just due to Bethesda’s incompetence to deal with the situation.
---
I picked it up on sale for like 8 bucks, had a terrible time with the tutorial, like when it came to docking it gave you like zero idea which way was the correct way.. sat there probably 30+ minutes turning in place fumbling around and when it finally parked- why is this the right angle??🤔
---
Think I got past the first combat only to quit on the second? Or maybe I finished it, because I remember thinking "wait, what am I supposed to do now?"
---
I don't think I uninstalled, but there isn't enough alcohol in the world to give be the patience I need to learn that game. PS4 if it makes any difference.
---
Heard so many good things about it, truly disappointed I couldn't figure it out..
---
Will they be earn-able within the game or are they going to cost $18?
---
Which category do we submit this under?
---
We will have alot of new players after survival and new content drops. I'm not banned and I jus want real players who enjoy the game to play with me
---
He wrote that post after he was already banned 
---
It might be a slim minority but it does exist. I am not accusing anyone on here of duping and I know everyone is just going to downvote me and assume I'm some evil duper. Im not assuming the same thing of anyone.
---
Bummer. Sorry 
---
Another wanna be psychic with Stockholm syndrome. Very sad
---
Upvoting. 
---
Whitesprings is actually a 45+ zone but lower levels keep going there to tag mobs from higher level players. I have solo played this entire game except for a SBQ run. I have over 225 hours played and level 57-58 it can be done. I run a sneak sniper build 
---
Interesting. I'll keep that in mind. Just out of curiosity, what level were you when you were there and had the mid-100 level players with you? I can only imagine what it must have been like. I try to avoid Whitesprings Resort because I get mauled by ferals every time I'm there because of all the higher level players in the vicinity.
---
After 900 hours you wrote your guide AFTER you were banned and are using that as your argument?
---
How do you know people aren't telling lies trying to stir up controversy?
---
Are you all knowing?
---
And wow alright I followed but if this is your community dang. Good luck beaver.
---
Totally legit. That's what I was wondering. The only reason I still loot weapons is for the rare occasion I unlock some mod for a random weapon that ill never use. I've gotten a little selective but still hit every weapon. To each their own.
---
I seen hell lot of dupers crying out innocence. I'd rather trust bethesda when it comes to bans. Too many lying as$holes in this subreddit
---
What do you expect them to magically fix the pugs and add content in a span in 4 months? The game was obviously released when it shouldn’t have been but they lowered the price of it and have been putting out patch after patch trying to address the bugs. It took 2 years for ZeniMax to fix Elder Scrolls online. Online games aren’t simple fixes and this one is no exception. If they have it running good and added the content in the time frame they have been given I’ll be amazed. The potential for this game is high because I’ve never played an MMO with a dynamic world that feels like a Bethesda game. If they can capitalize on what they are trying to do it will be amazing. We will see what happens but if they put in the time and don’t abandon it then it’ll pay off. 
---
I always kind of thought it was an elevation/activity thing. Similar to the dragons in skyrim. Always seemed like if you were on a mountain getting something done one would randomly show up.
---
Yep. The right move is to bait them into a profane response and then ban them.
---
That's my point. Another "different account" using the same language in this same thread and upvoting everything right away before to try to swing momentum. Luckily it's pretty obvious this guy is full of shit.
---
The thing is it is not a permanent ban. it is a suspension until the underlying issues can be fixed (which could be tomorrow's patch for all we know)
---
since it is not permanent I am inclined to think that bethesda cast a wide net to catch a lot of the duppers and caught up some nonduppers in the process (nonduppers being the minority, but vocal due to no wrong doing). The real issue will come when we see if it is a long term suspension or if it will be lifted as soon as tomorrow's patch.
---
Agreed there are lots of lyers and lots of a$$holes.
---
But not everyone is like that. There are alot of honest people in the world, even on reddit. 
---
I am not a hero. But you definitely are the villain. And you just got busted lol
---
Sure whatever you say buddy. Honest. That's laughable. I'm in a FB group with around 200 people, ALL legit players, ALL honest. Not one banned. 
---
Keep acting like the victim. I'll keep sipping my tea. 
---
As a level one bitch, the only thing I want more than customers who aren't idiots is customers with difficult problems that know I can't do anything and beg to talk to someone else.
---
This is what I’m doing with /r/RedDeadRedemption. Online mode’s been out for almost 4 months and it’s garbage. Waiting for a massive update before I head back to that game. 
---
Lolz every duper has their panties in banned bind and is flooding this sub.
---
This could be the case yes, but the suspension emails only say "in a future update". Could be tomorrow's patch, could be 4 patches time for all we know from the lack of Bethesda communication.
---
Agreed with ya. 
---
You are. Let Reddit look into your vote history, see if anything fishy is going on.
---
You’re finally right about one thing here
---
No you aren’t a hero, you’re a dumb shill
---
Ah yes so I used it properly. You attacked the character not the point. 
---
You sure showed him, amirite?
---
This is fucking cringe
---
That happens to me too sometimes but after a bit it then shows him as normal walking. 
---
The codes are in the dev room. Someone just breaks in an posts them. Otherwise, two of the silos would be mathematically impossible without thousands of trial/error runs.
---
I'm not out for sympathy or anything buddy. Simply stating some observations so as to present a more open view to everyone if people would be interested in that. 
---
Enjoy your tea :)
---
The dupers are vocal too, though. Plenty of 12 year old kids cheating and got banned then flood Reddit "waaah I didn't cheat at all!"
---
So you're buying another copy because you were banned? That's the equivalent of supporting their practices. The more they ban you, the more money they'll make from you. Huge red flag, my guy. Don't buy a new copy.
---
How can you be an honest person if you duped and got banned in the first place?
---
&gt; I've had friends who were completely against cheaters banned as well. Doesn't make sense 
---
It could be that Bethesda made a mistake and they were wronged. 
---
It could also be that they were projecting and really were cheating. Much like people who are very anti-gay can sometimes turn out to have gay tendencies and pious monogamist that speak out against adultery are serial adulterers.
---
"I have a sup call" 
---
I think you're drunk.
---
Bump!
---
As the saying goes, an honest mans pillow is his piece of mind.
---
Don’t want none? Don’t start none..
---
When did I say I duped?
---
So, instead of not picking them up, you decided...what? Well, they're just sitting there and I'm really thirsty? I'll just hold on to them for a short bit, but I'll dump them all later...sure.  Oh and the thousands of "free" didn't hurt either, eh?
---
No I wish you to apply the logic being used here to other situations.  Like police or family members or food companies.
---
Demanding perfection from one group but not from the other is amusing. 
---
Have you taken any chems like mentats or buffout? It possibly, might be caused by the addictols. Have been drinking any booze?
---
You're a fucking idiot if you think I cheated.
---
everyone has always know she drops them rarely
---
You are the one who's being dumb. You got caught bro haha
---
oh..cool..thnx for the reply
---
You're a fucking idiot if you think I'm lying.  
---
Not really responding to my inquiry 
---
Confirmed tomorrow: [https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1097629439985364992](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1097629439985364992)
---
"Alot of legit honest players"
---
So that's an observation? And where is your proof? Oh let me guess, your proof is this subreddit full of its "I'm innocent but I'm banned" posts lol. 
---
Again, laughable indeed.
---
Read ANOTHER comment below of someone else getting banned for the same stupid reason. I just bought an Xbox one x, came with a copy of fallout 76, i was CONSIDERING playing it. Now I'm gonna take it out back and burn the fucking thing. 
---
i took chems..but i took addictols after the chems wore off..addictols are supposed to help arent they
---
Error as in the error code that players are getting trying to log in, Bethesda haven’t said that some of these bannings were erroneous (although that may be the case).
---
Just remember that each time there's a ban wave dependent on certain conditions, Bethesda is admitting that they have no idea how, nor do they intend to fix whatever may have led to those conditions. They believe the solution to cheating and exploits is to ban the players who participate in it. For a company that behaves as though they have psychologists directing their decisions, they sure don't seem to get it.
---
I think if duper hunters didn’t hold onto the duped items it’s fine. But if you’ve got metric tons of duped items, if you haven’t pitched it, you’ll be pitched.
---
No problem. I would go to "Account" and "I can't Log in", and select "No" on the question about needing to recover your account. After that, it gives you a place to put in your username and issue, so you'd put user name and in the issue explain you were banned and give as much detail about what you think might have happened as you can. 
---
Especially note things like having a second account you use as a mule, having picked up stuff that was laying on the ground to toss it as part of a "duper hunt", or any other mitigating factors you can think of. 
---
Also, try to be polite. The person who will be reading this is just a customer support rep. They're not responsible for your ban and, being that they're just human, will be more likely to go above and beyond to try to be helpful if they feel appreciated rather than attacked.
---
I *knows much*, *tells some*. I knows many things others do not. 
---
Oh you meant *me?* That's fine. I thought you meant OP based on all the positive votes and similar language of other replies before people realized he was full of it. I only have ever had one account.
---
I haven't even used it since December.
---
I see no question marks.
---
Thats why I said the real issue comes when we start to see how long the suspension is. If it is not up lifted after tomorrows patch I would think waiting until the next inside the vault would be pushing the limit of people patience.
---
 Thanks. Yeah, I eventually found the hole in the floor. Couldn't tell you how long I tried running and jumping up the east side of the porch though. 
---
And yeah, the Jacuzzi is hilarious. I haven't seen if they've expanded on the story of the sickle man except for some lady. They totally should if the haven't. 
---
Thats what I read. Very much similar style to 76, but very hard for new players. If I don't get my account back or if I lose my drive to play more 76 I'm gonna play warframe.
---
I checked a guide and addictol is very dehydrating and it increases your hunger.
---
You can think whatever you want it doesn’t change the fact I never duped or had 100k of anything.  Bethesda is in no way or shape capable of handling a live service.  
---
I think they are also tagging how quickly people are getting resources not just total amount.  This is why it’s harder to believe The whole “ it wasn’t me. It was my brother “ statements. 
---
Maxing out your budget.  Had a guy fill my camp with porta johns.  Was awesome.  Got about 150 plastic after scrapping it all.
---
Yeah, but the frauds tend to out themselves. quicker if they get defensives about having to provide some kind of evidence. (faster still if they forget to clear out their past posts)
---
ohh..ok cheers
---
you should burn everything your path until fuel runs out a few seconds later
---
Oh so you're one of the banned people?? Should've known. Good riddance, I say. Too bad it wasn't permanent. 
---
When did I say you duped? Was talking about the dupers not you
---
Sadly, the same applies to the disease cure.
---
I stated above from the outset yes I got banned. No have never duped. And dont stoop to calling me a 12 year old whinger like one of your other comments.
---
😥
---
That was the nice part about it. I got some steel from the hoops it made the cleanup worth while.
---
The game itself is really fun. The map is huge and looks great. Bethesda though have been not the best at maintaining it. Thats saying it as nicely as possible.
---
Please delete before Beth sees...
---
Sorry, my apologies. Saw as reply to my comment and wrongly assumed.
---
(Happy to admit when I did something wrong)
---
Also you're banned now
---
I don’t drink, but whatever. I’ll post back in a few days to prove your little “theory” wrong.
---
Maybe, just maybe somewhere in that closed up shrivel walnut you use to conceive thoughts with you might be able to consider Bethesda royaly screwed up with this change. It’s not like the released a working game and didn’t break it over and over again.
---
Oh you're telling me.
---
I've seen posts "I haven't played for X months, WHY AM I BANNED?" but they have posts that is 1 hour old trying to sell stuff etc. 
---
Actually, maybe 95% of the posts I've seen is like that. People expects us to be dumb enough to believe them, and unfortunately some people are dumb enough. Smh.
---
I would say I play a lot and don't go through anywhere near 3000 rounds+ of ammo a day. Maybe if you are using a minigun as your main weapon I could see that.
---
Upvoting.. he’s not a duper, he’s just easily misunderstood..😳
---
So you don't have a responds. Got it. 
---
He was actually on your side, saying that stuff about me. Go change your votes and apologize for the insult! =p
---
Btw, for anyone having FPS issues with FO76, give [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/) a read.
---
" Those who have been suspended this way were identified as having acquired over 100,000 of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of play through duplication exploits. These accounts have been suspended from Fallout 76 until this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once a fix is live, we will reactivate these accounts and notify the owners that they can access the game a"
---
from the forums its a temp ban chill you will be able to play after the maintenace
---
Unless they've fixed it I always had the issue of whenever I equip it the amount of rounds in it is the number of fusion cores I had on me. 
---
Ah your phrasing made it sound like you didn't think NV had that many problems.
---
Lol
---
This shit right here is another MAJOR reason I fucking hate full online multiplayer games. Any time anyone is capable of preventing me from playing a game that I paid for, fuck them, fuck the game. Now I have personally never been banned. It is the fact that I have to watch my back and make sure I don’t accidentally do something that could be misconstrued as cheating..... 
---
I mean, people are still getting emails, just an hour ago from a post further up, which is 4 hours past when you posted, check again, might be banned...
---
And you expect me to believe you. Ha. Okay. Sorry buddy not gonna happen. GL enjoy that ban, hopefully it takes forever for you to recover your account. 
---
I told you HE is the one with multiple accounts. Report HIM. But you get all defensive and think I'm talking about you. maybe you do too. Since you're getting so defensive about it.
---
Buy some shares and escalate to investor relations.   Extra bonus if you go then go the shareholder annual meeting with your grievances.
---
Okay I admit that I had no idea what I was talking about, that's just it
---
I think you’re just remembering the past as better than what it was. This sub was always mad lol
---
You lie all the time. Why should i believe you this time? There's a very high chance you duped. At least you were carrying loads of duped items that's for sure
---
I went through 16000 5.6 rounds on my assault rifle guy at a WS nuke event. Its honestly not crazy to have and use thousands of rounds in any of the automatic weapons
---
Ah I see. Thought I’d missed something.
---
Remember when bots weren’t racist?
---
Yup I'm waiting for Survival myself. I'm big on PVP, earn around 10k caps a day off it currently. Love PVP. 
---
Honestly there's no need for this sub. People just use it as a bitch box.
---
I've been looking and yet to have seen them anywhere.
---
The people downvoting you for explaining a mule account are just people that arent aware of how mmo's work. mule accounts are commonplace on mmo's since their inception. its well accepted as commonplace. 
---
It’s a witch hunt and I’m on FIIIREEE
---
Np bud
---
They have no reason to lie? Then what about thos 'canvas' bags they were pushing on Power Armor Edition owners?
---
You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia." But only slightly less well-known is this: “Never trust Bethesda when your account is on the line!"
---
No I dont expect you to believe me. I dont expect anyone to believe anything. 
---
Some people are blinded by their own beliefs, and that is not implying you personally. 
---
Again I hope you enjoy your Tea.
---
A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers. 
---
Stick to the forest region, ash heap, and pretty much everything west of the savage divide. Scrap your junk at a work station, sell what you don't need. As for your perks, you have to decide what you want your character to be. If you want, I can team up with you amd help. Gamertag is warp58. 
---
Yes. This. I love this idea. I had a similar thought when I picked up the first banjo in this game.
---
The spookss
---
&gt;Bethesda: We're going to fix dupers.  
---
Remaining Players: Yay.  
---
Bethesda: Any complaints?  
---
Remaining Players: Nope, that was ok. To be honest, we were kinda worried you'd screw something up with this.  
---
Bethesda: Really? Huh...here, hold my beer.
---
also not OP, just here for the trainwreck XD
---
That’s what I’m wondering too. I had a couple people give me cool stuff and I thought they were just being nice... I’ve given stuff away just because I had too much or didn’t need it, but I worry some people weren’t *just* being charitable. 
---
It wouldn’t surprise me if not a single dev has ever killed any target other than Wooby.
---
Lol happens every time I try to explain it, thanks for being the exception..
---
U shouldn't need perk cards unless you have the 200% fix on armor and weapons. 
---
They used to be available at vendors but after the last patch I haven't seen them at all...if your lucky, you can find them as mods at vendors. 
---
The thing is, they don't have the ability to track what you picked up and got rid of. The way they've been doing this is proof of that.  All they can do is scan inventories, as in, what you currently have on you, in your stash, or on an alt (which maybe you forgot about ?). 
---
Too late. BGS is already dabbing on you.
---
That is insane and also why all my weapons are semi-auto.
---
Well I remember, I remember, don't worry, how could I ever forget
---
If you haven’t experienced a bug in FO76, you haven’t gotten past the load screen yet :p
---
You have 900 hrs on the game and your only 250??? I quit in December and I was level 256.
---
Probably about level 70-72
---
The shills like to butter me up with upvotes. They  think they can buy me, and punish me with downvotes if I say the wrong thing. I'm going to be alayzing this subreddit and reporting to consumer protection and trading standards agencies.
---
same exact thing with me, also subbed to sea of thieves for that reason but they're mostly chill over there now.
---
Sadly anthem is going that route and I initially wanted to buy it
---
So far no one who has been banned has mentioned having items removed by that purge.
---
Assumptions based on cynicism
---
Yeah, I got flagged as well. And I feel like I'm going to be walking on eggshells wondering what will get me banned after the suspension is lifted. All I ever really did was craft lots of 5mm and .50 Cal ammo for queen fights. And I was slowly switching over to 5mm ultracite to make up for the 2 shot Nerf on my Gatling. Guess crafting over 40k ammo with all the violet flux my friends help me get after the fights got me flagged. Other than that I don't know what else could have done it
---
Sniper vats build isn't real great against close range cloaked assaulttrons lol
---
Says KKKlaptrap. =p
---
Can you dupe in rust?
---
Shills? Not familiar with that term, I don't use Reddit much.
---
You still got plans? Noticed the vendors have jacked prices way up over the last few weeks. 3-5k for power armor mods? Anyways, I'd like a set of plans, given I've never landed a legendary modded style of this yet... Still not sure how you all find all these instigating explosive whatever kill everything game breakers?  My only cool loot is instigating Dragon. Double damage with critical &amp; rifleman perk cards and sneak attack should land almost 2k hit points
---
Sell to me.  Oh shit, you on PS4...or PC?
---
See, I don’t care about karma. I downvote myself sometimes 
---
It happens randomly and I love it!! Can't get enough of those rag dolls flying around! Upvote for prosperity!
---
lmfao a console feature thats not on pc? good job
---
These guys that have played their first mmo on elder scrolls or fo76 have no idea the scope of the bigger mmos. Eve online for example. so big that the battles on there have their own fleshed out Wikipedia articles. 
---
Game name:  TheHexi
---
I was wrongfully accused of duping on my level 400+.
---
Review it.  Fix it.  
---
I like your little extra hint you left for Bethesda next to the codes on your site
---
Why the hell should you post a picture of yourself for a wrongful suspension post? Doesn’t make any sense.
---
Thats a bit melodramatic. It's not like everyone is being banned. The guy even linked an email where it shows they banned him because he was dropping ammo and picking it up.
---
This may be an unfortunate case and a wrinkle in the crack down on dupers, but not a reason to "take it out back and burn the fucking thing." 
---
I had a set of plans and just sold them yesterday actually.  I can't remember where I got them though.....sorry
---
Because this is clearly an Ad for her Twitter and Instagram.
---
Thank you for the well thought out response. It wasn't my attempt to turn this into a more divided sub. It was mainly a response to those that are claiming all people banned are lying/cheaters. I hope most of the sub can look more into both positions in the future, instead of blindly following one way or the other. I deeply feel that these "white bethesda knights" can gain some perspective and need to learn they are potentially hurting the game and sub when they do not consider all possibilities.
---
I've had that before... just completely restart game, fixed it for me.  If that doesn't work reboot box maybe...
---
Every time I visit Camden, there is at least one there, if not both. You can also visit the big monorail elevator next to Fort defiance and usually get at least one. Never mind the workshops or crafting or random loot, there's plenty of them out there away from the commonly farmed areas, and I regularly drop any that are below %100 charge to reduce the amount of carry weight dedicated to them.
---
The only thing I can think of that eats enough to concern me is the jetpacks. Those will chew through your cores so fast that yeah, grabbing a workshop for an hour might be good.
---
Oh, also, there are other power plants than the one in the mire. There is one to the south-west of Charleston train station. And if you do the "power up the plant" quests, you will eventually get a nuclear generator to hook up to the fusion core creator without the admitted hassle of powering up the stupid power plants.
---
Calling you out on your BS.
---
You, Madam/Sir, are a hero. Thank you for the information and consideration for the retail/human side of the company. ♥️
---
Thank you so much, I'll try to do that now :-)
---
I spent most of my levels to 50 just wandering around and killing things and getting my map filled out
---
Dude, I feel exactly the same way. Probably not even banned. Feels like a giant Ad doesn't it?
---
I think we are Freddy...
---
Do you play on ps4 by chance?
---
Yet another reason to not by FO76
---
Or you could try... NOT violating the TOS.
---
Well apparently the suspensions have been rolling out since the weekend, just hasn’t really gained traction until today.
---
Thank for the info, I'll record a video next time I encounter him.
---
Exactly 
---
Don’t all perma-bans start as suspensions though while they investigate?  I’m not a scofflaw so I don’t know. 
---
You're welcome :D It doesn't help *anyone* to foment anger and discontent. Spreading it around just makes everyone worse off :)
---
You mean January right?
---
Good Choice, I went from that to 76 and I'm thinking of going back to Warframe,  avoid story spoilers if you can. 
---
[This recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/arzcgu/just_started_and_holy_balls_how_have_i_never/) by a new player is full of good starting tips but going in blind is a great experience too
---
Fu 
---
XB1 sorry man! Xbox master race! Har har ;)
---
The hero we need,sneaking in the shadows, waiting for bad people to do their thing to ruin their day
---
Lol, I didn't! I think it's because I posted a link to my twitch channel and that's my profile pic, I wish I had no pic
---
The more I read this sub, the more glad I am I canceled my preorder after playing the beta. This is a shitshow
---
Don't know but if you look at the emails, the ones I've seen talk about lifting the suspension once fixes some into action.
---
You can also go into social under team since you’re still considered to be in a team and just choose to leave it , that happens with me sometimes as well 
---
It's the first time, the last time, we ever met
---
I am not banned but I also haven’t played in a week or two 
---
I don't play warframe but if you need something to kill time that game will do it. Black desert online also kills time but might not be your cup of tea 
---
Damn I need a bloodied weapon. I had a bloodied lever action once and sold it for 7,500
---
Clipboards my friend. They take you further now than they ever did in the corporate world.
---
I havent gotten banned and i am level 33 on PC
---
A **shill**, also called a **plant** or a **stooge**, is a person who publicly helps or gives credibility to a person or organization without disclosing that they have a close relationship with the person or organization. Shills can carry out their operations in the areas of media, journalism, marketing, politics, [confidence games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_game), or other business areas. 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill)
---
It worked, but didn't at the same time if that made any sense lol. Somehow, after rebooting the console the main screen had the original option, but was still stuck having me join a team. I've bit my tongue on a lot of things with the game to spare the horse being beaten to mush after it's death. However, that was a pill I was just going to have to refuse to swallow!
---
Doing Atom's work.
---
When the last patch was released, everyone on this sub was praising it for not breaking anything. This sub has extremely low expectations and is only upset when Bethesda makes progress by stopping dupers.
---
That’s good, though they’ll probably wipe parts of their inventory if they think they’re exploiters.
---
I'm not banned, none of the people I play with got banned. Even the ones that do nothing but buy and sell gear and items. 
---
I wasn't banned but I didn't do any of that duping shit 
---
Damn you lol, well damn I'd be wanted and we would be fighting otherwise!! I wanna fight alot mpre but ppl dont too often and sometimes I just outmatched due to mutations and serums
---
Great 
---
Two of my friends got "suspended" but they deserve it.
---
Thank you so much s/deadpooliooo
---
Over the wall [of text] with you!
---
I'm not banned, as far as I know. And I'm not squeaky clean either.
---
Me!!!!
---
I would expect any game to ban exploiters. I also expect exploiters and people who only post popcorn drama to submit posts like this
---
Same here. Played Beta, level 136. Never duped , never learned to dupe, never exploited any glitch, and got the 100k email today. WTF can I do? This is only the 2nd game I've bought on PS4 ( FO4 ) was the other. Im a single dad on a tight budget, so it's not like i can drop 50 to 60 bucks everytime a game comes out that I want. I feel so screwed with no recourse. 
---
My brother was suspended he was around level 180 and hadn’t play since Christmas. He had a mule with a lot of cement steel and Stimpacks.
---
He farmed for steel using workshops. He also had a lot of steel on his mule because he would move his camp daily and for ammo and he would build the metal building camp. He had a lot of Stimpacks cause he crafted them and diluted them with super duper.
---
So I know for a fact some innocent people where banned with people who where guilty and deserved to be banned.
---
Also here is proof of his Suspension Email.
---
Sorry, there's too many believable reports from people with established reputations on this sub to just be lies and misdirection. Stripping out the obvious suspect posts, it seems clear Bethesda picked some poorly thought out test for duping and now people are being caught by false positives. Rather, the poorly thought out part is not allowing for the possibility of false positives. Even a company with a spotless record of code development would allow for that, and Bethesda sure as hell doesn't have a spotless record.
---
Not banned. Don't know a single person that was banned either. No one on the "official" discord seems to have mentioned it yet from what I've seen.
---
Maybe not that widespread...?
---
My recent 10 day, 4 visit, 15 phone call Spectrum internet installation would beg to differ. 
---
What the hell is going on with this poor game? I liked it, but it's like the company's being run by a hamster ball full of Mexican jumping beans.
---
Comment history tells a different story...
---
Console master race ftw!
---
The tos states you wont use exploits its a standardized things in games 
---
He’s using a classic troll tactic: make it your burden to define widely known/accepted terms or concepts, then nit-picking at a word or two you happened to use to try and make his point.
---
Notice how he used your original sentence structure but left out the hugely important “legitimately” part out to try and make it sound like _you_ were justifying duping?  And if you call him out on it, he’ll ignore it even happened and move on to some other minor half-cocked argument that will morph over time...
---
This game is nothing like Fallout 1 or 2.  It’s about as far away as a game can get.  
---
Would you like some cheese with your whine?
---
There's definitely somebody placing and posing skeletons out there. 💀🤳  
---
Lolz. It’s 16bit graphics. Who cares if there’s 10m mats? It looks like crap. Lolz
---
How about just not playing a game that is literal trash?
---
The problem is that you can't get ammo for it. Ammo almost never drops and crafting it is insanely inefficient.
---
One thing I like about Hopewell Cave is that if you time it right you can smack the Deathclaw once from stealth then run outside and let the scorchbeast finish it off (changing weapons to scorchie shooter while they are occupied...)
---
you are not required to join a team so not sure what's up.  Did you restart game from scratch too?  Maybe needs another reboot lol... sucks tho I hope it will reset
---
I've seen plenty of high levels (100+) at whitesprings for the past 2hrs. Looking at a 159, 190, 83, 69, 70 here right now after logging in.
---
Like 4 days ago lol
---
I wonder if this has something to do with the Eastern Regional Penitentiary exp glitches/ cheats from November that thankfully got patched?
---
I remember back when I was at about level 160, I had the feeling that I must be one of the highest level players in the game (I have the free time to take advantage of the crazy exp at Whitespring once nuked. I then came a cross an almost level 300 player and I was flabbergasted. I thought to myself, How could he have so much less of a life than I do :)
---
With the Home defense perk, at Eastern Regional Penitentiary, you could disarm "Grenade Bouquet" and receive 100 exp and a Fragmentation Grenade but the trap would never trigger so you could spam it non stop with the click of a button.
---
Maybe these folks with 100k items collected during a certain period of time ended up with too many frag grenades?
---
200% repair perk + by base was by the creek.  Was a good time.
---
&gt; Do you remember how many posts were made about the trade stealing exploit? Because there was never a single article of proof that it ever existed. 
---
Other than the patch notes:
---
I honestly like the feeling of the 50cal and mini gun, but the mini is especially hard to keep flush in ammo.
---
Haha, you actually should be grateful we're on different consoles. I can consistently win 4v1 and 5v1s. I've hired "merc groups" (group of paid players that hunt down griefers etc for caps) to hit me and I won, etc. I'm bored so I quit until the Survival mode comes out, then I'll be PVPing 24/7. Even players with full set of Assassin/Sentinel can't win against me.
---
I completely agree with this sentiment. Everyone should remain skeptical of both sides. 
---
Now they have to explicitly state what is NOT an exploit!?!  Does that mean you don’t hide behind cover when enemies are shooting because they never told you it’s explicitly okay to mitigate damage through wall/bullet collision mechanics??
---
Best new feature recommendation  in weeks
---
Sure.
---
The burden of proof is on dupers.
---
Maybe if you’d stopped duping you wouldn’t need an alibi for everything you do ingame. Lolz
---
The best evidence is a video.
---
Word of warning though. Don’t post that in the subreddit. Or the GT of the player. If will get flagged as promoting harassment of the griefer.
---
Yep I know counter intuitive, greifers being protected for their bad conduct cause you can’t name and shame.  
---
PM me personally and I’ll pass on the info to the appropriate discord groups. I know of 4 that have hundreds of players between them that would welcome said info.
---
In fact if anyone is suffering from griefers. You can PM me the details, include a pic or video of proof and a description of their conduct and I’ll pass it on.
---
Thanks. 
---
It's a bug that should be updated tomorrow. My work around was to take all of the supplies I needed to repair the armor out of my stash.
---
Ex: if I needed six screws and I had a 100 stashed, I would take all 100 out of the stash, repair the armor, and put the remaining screws back.
---
Yeah maybe it’s just heavy on this sub.  It’s just crazy you look at the posts seemed like a mass purge but doesn’t seem that different in the game.
---
I've invaded workshops with 7-8 players there, obviously were playing together and I've won. All my friends know to hit me up if they meet someone they can't kill. It's enjoyable being godlike in this game. 
---
Explosive shotgun, non vats build. Primarily an unarmed build, though can swap shotgun perks in for range combat. 
---
Also could potentially supplement with heavy guns 
---
Agreed block then server hop.
---
Hopefully they’re duping ass gets booted.
---
I appreciate the good will response. I don't think any specific poster is lying, but in the same sense that I'm sure innocents get hit in ban waves, I'm also sure a lot of cheaters will be willing to lie and take advantage of decent people who are trying to defend the innocents. Probably best to just withhold opinion for now unless you personally know someone banned (I would go to bat for friends I trust).
---
It's a bit of a shitshow, really. Just made worse because of 76's reputation. But at least the top comment to this thread is pretty neutral.
---
LOL I can only imagine. It should be interesting, at least.
---
Regardless of wether the game is bad you and it friends chose to use exploits which breaks the tos 
---
What an assault rifle tho?? 
---
It would be hilarious for you to livestream this stuff sometimes dude
---
Had my deathclaw gauntlet do that yesterday.  Hit the mole miner, couldn’t see where he went, then all of the sudden he fell out of the sky right beside me. 
---
16k ammo on one run though of nuked Whitespring  is a load of bullcrap, I suggest you find a better lie to use. 
---
The fact that people are still riding that burning trainwreck is absurd to me. I'm done with Bethesda. They did me dirty like Bungie. At least Bungie made a decent attempt to turn it around. Bethesda is still a shit show. 
---
So what happens if you get banned then? 
---
There are those being honest and stating they have done wrong but have been banned, while others claim they have done nothing wrong as well.
---
&gt; False positives and claims are fairly common when massive automated waves happen.
---
Yeah, false positives are common quite honestly. The only reason there's a problem here is because Bethesda isn't allowing appeals. They're assuming their dupe detection code is perfect, which I find... unlikely.
---
Although ammo is pretty different, don’t you think? A magazine, bobble head or nuka cola is found in the wild and then dupped to 100k, but cartable ammo that comes out 180 at a time is pretty different.
---
We had the trade theft scare infest this sub too at similar levels and that was entirely unsubstantiated. Maybe it's the same here. Maybe not that people aren't getting suspended (though I guess that could be faked too) but the severity and seeming innocence of it all.
---
Who knows. I certainly don't.
---
Yeah I did stop by a lobby with that place nuked and some jacked up players shredding ghouls.  I was surprised by how many low levels I saw too.  I think I get confused because people here make it seem like a ghost town with a huge purge but things felt the same today mostly.  You on xbox?
---
I thought I saw the plans at watoga or harpers. Kinda pricey tho..
---
Workshops are not worth bothering with for that very reason 
---
You know the terms and agreements that every game has yeah you agreed. Also yeah they can ban people because they made the fucking game. Don't like it leave your peace and go. Im tired of people saying how bad it is and still playing it. Complain by all means just don't ask dumb questions and state that you didn't agree to the fucking terms and agreements which basically mean they can ban whoever the fuck alters the gane, people exploiting a glitch in the game, or being harmful in ways to other users. It's their product you paid for. Don't like it file a complaint try to get your money back and just go. 
---
The same way you lock anything else, left trigger in build mode (if on console).
---
I do :)
---
Well done sir
---
What the fuck 
---
I will not trade with anyone now... not touch a brown bag, and not buy anything that isn't static at a vendor (e.g. plans).  All you other players are just boss mobs I don't want to fight... it's single player from here on out. (until I need one of you NPCs to mode my armor... but then you could pass me a duped one back...  arrrrgggghhh)
---
Very true, but you also can't convince me 900 hours is the ONLY one falsely banned.
---
We’re glad you took a break too.
---
Your banned email is awaiting for ya.. lolz
---
I used to be a heavy build. 3k a day was nothing. I could drop over 2k on a single queen fight depending on my weapon choice. 
---
Anyone using an LMG will go through 308 like crazy. 
---
Another promising feature that failed due poor design and bad implementation.
---
Double think if I kill this super mutant will I get banned?
---
Umm... aren't they just playing the game as intended? Sucks for you, no question there, just that it is what it is.
---
Nice, and I’m betting you xp glitched it the whole way. You’re cool
---
Seems like a completely broken business if they're banning the people who are the most obsessed with the game ... on the flip side maybe they're giving you an opportunity to RP against a real life the institute.
---
Lvl 210 not banned, my bf 190 not banned. The game isn't perfect, but we still have fun. 
---
Lol so you just farm lead all day or never move your camp off an extractor? 
---
Seriously. I’ve went though with a .50 and never used that much. 
---
This reads a lot like propaganda without any evidence one way or the other.
---
Did you get banned and get one of these emails?
---
Not banned. Never done anything wrong. My friends are mostly ok. Those who got suspended this time kinda deserved it. They were very exploitive and I was kinda surprised when they weren't perma banned during the last ban wave
---
&gt; I find it incredibly likely that a service provider that logs delta's out on the back end can reliably detect not only who duped items but also those that received those duped items.
---
Except they've admitted they don't track item IDs or anything of the sort. If they don't assign instanced item IDs then they can only detect based on characteristics, and there aren't enough unique combinations to make dupe detection 100% accurate.
---
I believe it. There might be a handful of wrongful bans but I think the majority did something against eula. 
---
Everyone in prison is also innocent? 
---
Lol you just got destroyed op
---
I never found a "good" one of those, but they sound awesome.
---
Lead wasn’t my issue. Batches of 50 ammo needed both Violet and steel. I was always running Uranium Fever to scrap weapons for steel. Would get plenty of lead from the silos as I was running them probably a half dozen times a day on my days off and usually once a day after work.  Pre-nerf I was down to less than 20 minutes between getting off the elevator and fast traveling out. 
---
The one guy that likes this game - *banned*
---
Silly question, but what is the goo good for??
---
I 'member.
---
Do you 'member when Bethesda used to be revered as a top tier AAA developer?
---
Meh. I didn’t say or imply he’s the only one. So I’m not sure what you’re adding here.
---
Had a TS one pre-nerf. I primed it and it did ok. Not worth the ammo cost though. 
---
Really you know the guy well enough to know he didn’t dupe?
---
Or has he been banned so long it doesn’t matter.?
---
May I ask why you’re championing his claim?
---
You a friend a pal..?
---
honestly, if you've already played the game for 900 hours, Bethesda did you a favor by banning you
---
&gt; aren't they just playing the game as intended?
---
Isn't the OP playing the game as intended too?
---
I don't think that will happen no duplication or exploitation on any of my 3 characters dont even trade so ya but we can hope right lmfao
---
Bethesda: *makes all enemies bullet sponges*
---
Players: *carries lots of ammo to combat this*
---
Bethesda: *bans players*
---
That is 100 percent false, ghoulish heals you as you take rads, share ghoulish and radsponge and ghouls have little to no affect against you.
---
You look at the inventory before and after that's all you need to track down who's duping.
---
If they send a craft command to the server and the inventory increases by more then there is a dupe.
---
Scrap rifles of that type till you learn that plan
---
they never admitted anything if the sort, what are you talking about. 
---
I actually started to feel sympathetic towards Bethesda a little, but this is probably the dumbest thing I have ever heard anyone getting banned for awhile.  Ammo. No weapons, no Halloween Candy, no Nuka Colas.. ammo. Considering his hour count, his story in addition to that recent e-mail it all seems very believable.  Everybody gave this man so much grief including Bethesda over ammo he probably did legitimately acquire and trade
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/78/AssaultrifleFO4.png/revision/latest?cb=20170112014130
---
The one I said?
---
IIRC The tongue hanging out is not about thirst. It’s about being under the influence of a chem. 
---
All these post about being banned makes me afraid to even login or just do the daily challenges. 
---
Has Bethesda released any informations about this ban wave? All I've got from reddit posts; if you're crafting or looting anything above 100000 rare items within 30 days you'll be banned. I'm worried because I've been trying to craft a lot of radium rifles and scrap em to learn the mods.
---
Probably, yeah.
---
Disassemble the same style of weapon gives you plans for that weapon. For lower level stuff you’re pretty much guaranteed a plan. 
---
But some rifles may not even have a bayonet option.  IDK
---
It's fault for playing such a horrible game. Next time, you'll learn.
---
I want explosive minigun.
---
I have 8 caps.
---
Let's trade.
---
Do you know how hard it is to have 100k items in 1 month?
---
Now for caps I'm torn. I want to see players trading but 20k for a TSE or plan or mod is a bit much,
---
Of course I get downvoted because all these kids can't believe someone didn't dupe at all or own 100k tse weapons. Oh my god, is there more people than just me being falsely banned over the past two days? Who didn't see that coming.. oh wait. All of you who think they know everything, just shut up. I doubt half of you even play 76 anymore.
---
This thread popped up on r/all
---
I'm fallout fan but genuinely didn't find anything about this game appealing. I still browse through the threads I see from time to time to see how it's holding up. 
---
ohh..i see... lvl 160 noob here lol
---
Well you’ve got yourself another viewer now, Rock on dude 🤟
---
Lolz it’s robot romance.
---
Let them have their privacy.
---
I'm sure we will find out after tomorrow's patch.
---
I have tons of plans I could give you/her if you're on Xbox
---
Like I said I never had a good legendary one, but they also kindof kick and shake a lot.  I think that's why I like the assault rifle, it's deadly accurate with all the stabilized mods and silencer
---
Mouth harp? or is that another one you can't build at CAMP?
---
Wow, that's weird that it still happened after reopening the application, I've had this happen but restarting normally works. Hope it got fixed for you
---
If you equipped that card and bloody mess it should be like a bomb went of in a slaughterhouse. Fireworks of gore!
---
My DeathClaw Diablo attacks anyone in my party....damn
---
Unfortunately, this. If it’s a hunting rifle it may not be too hard. Just go kill Scorched and muties. If it’s a handmade, well best start grinding. Only way you’re gonna get a ton of those is making them yourself. 
---
I reflexively downvoted but then came in and he gave me a good chuckle, i switched to upvote :p
---
imo, all this chaos comes thanks to the "brilliant" idea to mix PvP and PvE in the same map/game...
---
I used to steal bunch of stuff from dupers and drop them all in a lake or some tree stump. Not banned yet, which means bethesda does review carefully when landing bans
---
I don't even feel bad for them if they're enjoying themselves! 
---
&gt; I don't think I've once held more than 36,000 ammo at one time. 36,000 being a very specific number I am stating as that was the rough amount of 5mm ammo I had collected.
---
I noticed in their letter they didn't state it was a particular type of ammo on your main account.  They simply stated "ultracite ammo"; so it sounds like all of your ultracite ammo of all calibers was being included in the tally
---
Still not fixed. Super annoying because I swap guns constantly as I go and find myself needing to “reload” the core each time I put it away
---
Awfully defensive for an innocent person. Proof that you are a cheater. Enjoy.
---
I’m not even gonna buy the game so they can’t ban me! 
---
Edit: they got me, fellas - https://m.imgur.com/HC3VVwG
---
Play a different game.  If you can afford a different game, then wtf were you doing spending hundreds of $$$ on a PS4 when you couldn’t afford it?
---
Don’t answer that. GameStop sells used games for as cheap as $3.00.  You can afford a different game. 
---
I don't know how many times I've been told one thing by a rep, ask for the supervisor, "they'll tell you the same thing", "I'd like to hear it from them", the supervisor gets on and 'works magic' the original rep swore would never happen.  That's why people(myself included) go straight to escalation. 
---
Ah yes, mouth harp, I forgot the name. Yeah can't build it, but you find them in the wasteland
---
That’s the other kicker. There’s very few mods for any of the heavy weapons except the energy ones. You can’t even get a sight for the 50, and the one you can get for the gatling is completely useless. 
---
Bethesda devs: "How dare you violate the nebulous spirit of the game with exploits we *chose* to leave in when we decided a November release mattered more than giving it the development  time it deserved!"   
---
You have it ? 
---
not banned nor is my playing partner , I'm 130 and they are 80 . we spend a lot of our time exploring and are still enjoying ourselves .
---
It's a Pvp game. 
---
&gt; If they send a craft command to the server and the inventory increases by more then there is a dupe.
---
That's not how the duping works. The various methods all involve getting the server to do things out of sync or without running validation checks due to gaps in the code logic (or due to poor handling of lag). Detection after the fact is going to be incredibly difficult.
---
Source: this is more or less my day job. Data integrity is a bitch.
---
Doesn't matter. He's playing a survival game that has PVP at all times. 
---
I just... Would never throw away any ammo is all.
---
Seems like it was a higher percentage in this sub then other places so I dunno.  Just seemed crazy all these I was wrongly banned posts so I was curious.  Good to see plenty of advanced level people playing clean who haven’t had an issue.
---
Same.
---
make sure all the junk is scrapped fully, some items need to be manually scrapped like assaultron heads and hardened mass.
---
get rid of excessive easy to get items - you dont need 500 steel, wood or cloth as they are easy to get went ever you need them
---
keep stuff like screws,springs, ballistic fiber, aluminum,copper,silver - you will need them later on.
---
you perks/specials are going to depend on your build, decide what type of weapon you want to primarily use
---
at that level do events and kill mutie and mole miner mobs, or if you have decent weapons/armor Whitesprings
---
the Mistress of Mysteries and Roses sidequests are good to do around that level and are 2 of the most interesting quests IMO
---
Two people on my friends like got banned and they swear they dont even know how to dupe, they were told it's because they had too much ammo
---
Taking a workshop literally warns you that PVP may happen. That's the entire point of the workshops. 
---
F
---
This is true of most things. I used to *hate* calling internet support at my previous ISP, though - the first line agent would expect you to do their whole script (including restarting your computer, which still makes no sense to me for a network outage) to report an outage upstream, which the tier 1 tech couldn't even do (they would escalate after doing the script.)
---
I eventually got on a business plan, which supposedly bypased all that, but it actually worked, so I ended up never calling them. So..yay!
---
I love how my current ISP handles this - when you call in, the IVR system asks reasonable questions (does this problem affect one device or all? Have you restarted things/reseated cables, etc?) and even tells you if they are working outages in your area, which, *gasp*, they usually detect and get onto relatively quickly. What required escalation at the other company doesn't require an agent at all *most* of the time.
---
But yeah, all that to say - sometimes the immediate escalation is warranted, but it probably says more about their support organization than it does your problem.
---
Then they were stupid, because they can lock the terminal like anything else. If you hacked it you'd become wanted and he could just kill you.
---
I got the error message for a moment. Then it resolved by itself. No e-mail received. I think it is because I caught a duper once, picked up his stuff, then dropped them. The ban list seems manually checked.
---
Haha, yes.  I've used the Gatling with sight.  It does increase the accuracy stat, but is distracting as hell to have that little ring floating in a random spot
---
Lolz.
---
It’s Bethesda’s fault you got banned..
---
It’s Bethesda’s fault you got 100k worth of crap.
---
It’s Bethesda’s fault you’re not able to play...
---
It’s Bethesda’s fault you’re not happy..
---
Fwiw, I think you’re right Bethesda went home, just not with you..
---
I think it’s a bug. Same thing happens to my brother and his wife when we play on PS4. I can still click their name to team up or fast travel to them... it just shows them as “offline” for some reason even though we’re all playing together. It didn’t used to do that either. Seems recent. 
---
No, I have 8 caps. But because I like you, I'll pay 7.  You trade?
---
I do believe they were cheaters. They'd rage for points on reddit and discredit the dupers. Then when all friends logged, they'd clean their hands off from Cheeto crumbs and get a hold of a duper to sell them a gun.
---
Endorsement, or association? We be the judge.
---
I'm melee so I never have to worry about ammo lol, but I once had a character using a shotty (a normal, non legendary one) and I used maybe 200 ammo max for the ENTIRE WS area, on my own. So 16k? That's laughable. Laughable indeed how some people thinks we're dumb enough to believe their lies.
---
But but but but... that 10 atom daily challenge &gt;\_&lt; "Trade with someone."
---
It just reminds me that I hate \^ that challenge, Revive a player, and take a picture while in group daily challenge. I haven't even done this week challenge do 10 events while in group lol
---
Yes I do....Please understand, I’m not saying that players may have legitimately gained 100k items and are now suspended. I’m saying that players may have been dealt a heavy hand even though they removed the stuff they acquired via pickups months ago or when it all became a big deal and very obviously a Nono.  When it comes to actual players who dupped them, then I am a bit on the fence, but then I doubt Bethesda would ever be able to split that hair.
---
Which platform?  Curious, who told them they had too much ammo, Bethesda?  Cause that would be fairly crazy I’d have them post that email somewhere. One of my friends has so much ammo he’s obsessive about it,  not like 100,000 haha but a lot.
---
I don't think that will ever happen because the spawns rely on players in that area..I was using my alt in harpers ferry last night..lowest level enemy was 68
---
No way, once upon a time this sub literally was the 'Bethesda can do no wrong and any criticism valid or not gets downvoted.'
---
Even legit bug reports and crash details were mass downvoted into the negative.
---
The cheaters are trash but we're way too many months in for people to still be leaning on "read the terminals, explore the environment!!!"
---
You got banned 
---
Your option to play, was removed.
---
Think of it this way, you’ve overstayed your welcome.
---
Bump 
---
Someone’s not happy being dumped..
---
I run 3* ghoulish, for health regen in battle with rad sponge every hit that does rads heals itself and some hp, also have adrenal reaction mutation for quicker health regen at low health, then healing factor for outside of battle or just a good sneak build will do, scaly skin and grounded, serendipity half the time I take no damage, dodgy you have to drain my ap before my health drains, unyeilding armor half sentinel half cavalier, that 20 hp is plenty. Lone wanderer is another damage resist.
---
I have around 2800 atoms... not spending them on anything as I'm forced into Excavator prison... a slave to my scrap... a true packrat...  And I'll be damned if I risk my account by trading with someone... You never know where that bobby pin's been.
---
Xbox 1
---
If it’s a robot vendor no. Everyone else is suspect 😉
---
One exception being if you're a power armor build and severely low on cores, which OP might be. Only takes a few hours to farm a month worth for me. Still bait for griefing though. Routinely taking workshops is a dangerous lifestyle.
---
All those bombs might make people stressed 
---
The more I see /r/fo76 on the front page the better I feel about not having started playing.
---
We go elsewhere as the Reddit Discord was toxic and useless. The vocal skreeching was too much to bear and they drove us all to other places :(
---
I'm not demanding perfection from anyone.
---
I'm simply pointing out that neither side has a reputation good enough to merit automatically believing them.
---
You don't seem to respond to that I've written, rather you respond to what you think I've written.
---
Laugh I should tell my buddy to relax on the stockpiling cause we’re on Box 1 too, or he should give me some,  I under ammo and run out all the time.
---
And I know many players who where affected but did not have 100k items.....there is so much inconsistency. What I have noticed is that things/players get missed.
---
it's because it's a part of the console OS, separate from FO76.
---
and there's a chat mod for pc &gt;.&lt;
---
You’re no friend of theirs lol
---
Every day Bethesda keeps giving more and more reasons to never buy from em again, either Todd Howard is sinking the ship to buy it cheap or he's an asshole that hates gamers by selling them shit and then taking it back while keeping the cash. PR studies will look to companies like this as an example to how not to act like towards customers. 
---
People say it's the developers fault for having glitches in their game. Like why the fuck wouldn't they. It's a guarantee in any game that has ever fucking existed
---
As a level 200+ I have many friends with legitimate accounts, never done worst than crafting a shit ton of ammo to farm the queen, who got banned.
---
Using a semi-automatic rifle i don't need to craft as much ammo as these guys with heavy machine guns, but even so, I try to avoid crafting too many ammo just because of what's happening atm.
---
Wth....
---
Anthem got a lot of attention but my friends and colleagues who like a certain stykle game are the ones who went to check it out. APEX, on the other hand, seems to be grabbing everybody I know, got my eye on it as another breakout surprise hit
---
I'm not 100% certain the rollback update was accidental. They went from stating they had no way of identifying those with duped items to announcing the duper purge shortly after the patch. Logically, it would seem that something was inserted with that patch which enabled them to start taking anti-duper steps. Perhaps it had to be rolled back to an earlier state for it to work.  
---
No, I didn't 'attack the character and not the point' - the point *is their character*.
---
That's an exploit you're banned
---
Lol so anyone over level 250 was an exp glitcher or has over 1000 hrs in the game?   Unless you consider farming white springs before the exp nerf a xp glitch.
---
😭
---
Bypassing a shitty inventory restriction is not “part of the game” 
---
In almost every survival game, you’re limited by how much storage you build, not some arbitrary amount set by the devs. 
---
There was none else on the server but me.  They literally wanted jot because I own it.  There should be none pvp servers
---
Stopped reading after seeing that you couldn't be bothered to spell anything correctly.
---
Can you pls tell me where there plans spawned for you ?
---
Probably.
---
TSEs do that occasionally
---
I've seen screenshots of them banning people for making less then 100k ammo, no mention of rare items.
---
I'm not banned, and I'm fucking furious about it ;p
---
Simple math guys..... 1% got banned... 1% didnt.... 98% quit long time ago. 
---
Lolz are ya sure?
---
I mean you sound hopeful you will be, so..
---
Here’s to hoping you will 👍
---
If he got banned with only a few hours total played does that not provide insight into how terrible implemented this ban wave was?
---
I have been following this sub since before release, but due to technical issues with my computer at release, I didn't buy it then. And let me just say:
---
I AM SO FUCKING HAPPY I NEVER BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME! 
---
My account that i havent played on since a week after launch has been banned only got to level 12 on it and left it then my main at level 226 got banned today as well 2 different accounts but I didn't do any exploits the other one wasnt even a mule
---
*Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition...*
---
You didn't have to take the 150K colas, which, btw also mean 150K CAPS, but you did. You knew it was not legit and took them anyway. I'm sure you were just going to hold them long enough to drop in a river, eh?
---
"Easily"
---
Says the person talking about using a full set of 3\* Armor with god-rolls.
---
Then why care about being banned if you didn’t play much?
---
Sounds like you’re feeling hurt..
---
Worth pointing out... just because the letter says "rare item" doesn't mean their software was correctly written or set up to check only rare items.
---
I mean, right now (or at least last time I logged out) I have a quest telling me both to pick up a holotape and to go do the things after getting the holotape while the holotape is in my pipboy, after quitting and reloading the game once already. That's **1** freaking condition and it's not getting it right.
---
It depends on the first player in a particular area on the server..and if u are elevated at whitesprings none of the enemies can really touch u..btw the charred ghouls are the fastest in the game..
---
That's not how it works anymore, nowadays Bethesda rents virtual space on super servers in datacenters. If 4k people were playing @ 24 per server, there would be around \~200 servers up. If 4k MORE people suddenly joined in an instant, then \~200 MORE servers would 'spin up' out of nowhere on the same super-server running the original \~200. 
---
Yeah it's just a bunch of dupers whining cuz Bethy finally caught them OR a bunch of people spewing BS outta their ass just because they can. 99% of the "banned" posts in this subreddit are either lies or dupers crying. I guarantee it. 
---
"of course, you can play this SOLO"
---
Todd Howard.
---
I'm disabled and i have 966 hours online.. nothing fishy at all about that.. your welcome to sit in my chair and only have cable tv or play online games to keep your mind. 
---
That’s bananas!  Banning a level 12 like wtf how could that account even have accomplished what they’re banning for?  Geeeeesh.
---
My account was suspended and I haven't even been playing it. I've never been in possession of anything rare or not remotely close to 100,000 items let alone within the past 30 days. Shame on you and your company for treating paying customers like this.
---
they don't exist anymore and really didn't affect the economy. But there were a few infinite traps you could spam disarm on and get small amounts of XP very fast from. You also got a ton of resources (frag grenades from one, flamer fuel from another).
---
The Damage/Energy Resistance resulting from Armor shouldn't be counted while in Power Armor. The giant Metal Can wrapped around you is taking all the impacts.
---
But there is no reason that other bonuses like SPECIAL increases or Action Point speed boosts or anything like that don't come through. The gear is still on you, it's just not helping stop the bullets.
---
Who knows? Very high chance they are just lying to make themselves look good.
---
Im thinking its just a faulty detection system on bethesdas side of thing because none of the accounts to my knowledge deserved thw suspension because even on my main I never had stacks of anything passed 20k ammo
---
God damn dude if anymore updates happen pls tell us
---
Ignorance isn’t excuse to be banned. 
---
Apparently duping excessive items and breaking their terms of service, may include griefers will.
---
Post pics of the Bethesda email stating the reasons.
---
"Even if it's a combination of stim-packs, purified water, nuka-cola or  whatever, it still far exceeds what you could acquire through normal  game-play."
---
Except you can do easily more than 5k ammo in few hours - Not sure about what you can do within 24 hours of hard grinding, but I bet you could easily go above 20k within 24h.
---
Between events, grind locations, server hopping etc., for experienced players, it is easy to craft a shit ton of these in no time. And I'm no snowflake here, a lot of players grinding the hard way knows the feel.
---
I'm sorry mate, but on this one, you are wrong.
---
I'd say they're all liars as well but, when GTA V online did a massive ban wave I got banned and I've never cheated on a PC game. I got my ban immediately reversed because it was wrongfull. Maybe that will happen to the innocent people.
---
Madlad 
---
I mean TF2 has been “dead” since it went F2P back in 2011, but...here I am, playing TF2 every week still. 
---
Here here, brother. 
---
Yeahup, play with a half dozen friends from school/work none of us are banned, we're like saints apparently :)
---
No he got banned for duping or breaking their TOS.
---
Everyone complaining about their banned stats, are.
---
Some good can come fro this. Lolz
---
Ad Victoriam
---
I wouldn't listen to this moron, look at all those downvotes.
---
&gt;That’s completely false, plus I haven’t even played since December.
---
you're right. december was more than a month away.
---
How can these morons be so stupid that they thought they could get away with these blatant lies? It's almost insulting. 
---
Digital fingerprint, you (op) dumbass
---
Correct, pull the materials from stash. The game has issues when it needs 5 from inventory and 2 from stash.
---
I picked up 97 nuke key cards and did not get ban yet spent every one of them but 6 on caps. So to me anybody who says they got ban deserve it.
---
Yes I fully agree with this 
---
Reminds me of Runescape. If you're too good and you never talk they'll just autoban you for being a bot. 
---
Lol are u ps4 someone was bullying my low level alt yesterday..how did he finally figure out who I were?
---
Crafting 100k ammo is possibles over a couple months. My explosive handmade is my main and I'll go through 2k ammo during queen runs alone. Each session I play I expend over 1k easily plus with the amount that we shoot, everyone one does tend to craft a boatload of ammo to be extra prepped.
---
I put this under the heading of “ kill them all and let God sort it out. “. 
---
You deserve it for buying and playing this game. 
---
This is what you get for supporting a blatantly unfinished game. 
---
Good job sheep dog. You got the sheep all rounded up.
---
Upvote cuz illiteracy is a serious issue.
---
I have no doubt that even players who did not have 100k weight ....even collectively of there mules at the time of the last patch got suspended. My point is that this wave appears to be for any 30 period since launch. 
---
Yes all food drink..raw or cooked
---
LOL
---
If they have that ounce of intelligence, they wouldn't have done this. 
---
I did the xp exploit on my alt ages ago but im golden. 
---
Lolz I’m playing. I didn’t get banned. Seems like a lot of legit folks are playing as well.
---
I know cuz I see them playing.
---
Hey look on the bright side, you can’t complain how crappy the game is, since you’re banned.
---
Claiming a workshop warns you that you can get in pvp with other people. Sorry that those people did that to you though.
---
Hmmm...key cards have no weight and you don’t have 100k of them....
---
It's more about the setting.  Fallout after 2 is only related by lore and setting, we always wanted a game we could play together. This game actually does a good job at that and has potential.  Imo it was released a year too early but in time it could be a classic.  
---
I wouldn't. He didn't understand nor made the connexions. He's good at covering obvious stuff but not as digging.
---
Plus you probably won’t land a better outcome. I’ve been trying to do this for days and I can swap servers 10 times in a row and still end up with a 50+ level gap to another player every single time.
---
Well, you tell me, what is worse physical agony or downvotes?
---
Again you show your obvious ignorance.  Your friends quit because the game had immense failures, you falsely assume those failures were a direct result of dupers and not Bethesda having unstable servers due to data leaks and an overall lack of understanding in online gaming.   Just because Bethesda looked for a scapegoat.....dupers
---
.....and blamed their failing servers on them doesn't make it a factual statement, they have lied and continue to lie to try to cover their increasing mistakes.  Further if Bethesda would have properly tested the game and patched out duping in Beta like any major online publisher would have the issue would have never been a problem in the live game.
---
You falsely again assume that I am a duper, not only have I never duped a dam thing I play solo and I am not banned, the OP who wrote the post is not by default guilty, just because he played an obscene amount of time and was then banned doesn't mean Bethesda didn't make yet another mistake, something they have done non stop with this game since it has been released.  Everything they fix breaks something else, and when they claim to have prevented duping and have banned players who did so with large amount of items, you would think server stability would be greatly improved.....it hasn't btw, I still get kicked off constantly.
---
So what now.....is Bethesda and people like you going to blame people constantly logging out and back in to farm whitesprings on the server instability?  Just because you and your beloved company claim something as fact, doesn't make it so.  Servers are still unstable so obviously banning the people who have duped wasn't the dam server issue.
---
My point you so blatantly failed to see through you absolute tunnel vision is that a company who has lied constantly and continues to do so is highly likely to ban a subset of people who never deserved the ban.  I have more faith in the people of this Reddit sub then in Bethesda at this point......and that's as sad as your rebuttle to my comment in the first place.
---
no but i did buy all the power armor plans of the vendors and alot of other things. it's about gaining in set ammout of time not holding
---
You wrote an essay but all I read was "waah waaaaah waaah boohoo waaaaah boooo hoooo *snivels* waaaah waaaaaah"
---
I dont beleive that, especially given Bethesdas ineptitude at patching. The #1 upvoted post on the front page is definitely not a duper, for example. 
---
I banned myself from playing this game. Just kidding, I had a friend that got suspended for having 15k nuka cola quantums 
---
Fun fact: most highly profitable companies are not publicly traded (because they don't need to be). 
---
I vote “Aye!”
---
Over half a mil rounds of ammo 3/4 of is ultraice info from Bethesda and you say they still messed up... I smell something fishy no offence but they seem to have done the homework this time and reports on you wont bring up your ammo count like that 
---
He is my real life brother and yes I know he didn’t Dupe or cheat.
---
100k ammo in a week is easy 
---
There were a few spots where you could get repeated XP.. One such spot was at a prison disarming a grenade trap
---
What the hell is up with your username
---
Why not just ask the rep to help, and if they cant then escalate? It takes 60 seconds maximum.
---
If you aren’t swiftly restored it will be my 2nd strike on their blunder count against those at the 76 helm. 
---
the first being trying to promo a survival mode with higher player drama and difficulty whilst still having a sort of broken perk ui and quite broken system for action bar and ui customization and major responsiveness issues in the controls and combat itself. 
---
I am going to add a gold to this post each day. I encourage anyone else who cares and loves this game as it’s true supporters to do the same. 
---
I haven't seen any change, same old ppl 
---
It really is on Reddit, it's like nobody gives a fuck. 
---
That would depend on the ammo type, I imagine. 100,000 cannonballs would raise some eyebrows! 
---
Damn man,  reading sure is difficult.
---
I noted it happens with mole rat teeth too.. Wtf bethesda..
---
Maybe they  should give us the option to lock things. Where they become exempt from scraping or accidental sell/drop
---
i think you meant to post here https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/
---
How very sisyphean.
---
Really? I could have sworn I tried that forever ago. Good to know though, thanks.
---
Why not? The game is overwhelmingly considered garbage and their most loyal gamers are being punished. I didn't pay for it. Hell, the Xbox one x was DISCOUNTED $100! Probably because it had fallout 76 on the box. $399 brand new xbox one x fallout 76 edition. Its gonna burn.
---
You're making it harder to believe people that may have actually been unfairly banned. Thanks a lot, douchebag.
---
Yeah. That shit is annoying. I could have had a lot of clean water but nooooooo.. 
---
and im done Bethesda. you made millions and didnt fix known bugs or exploits for launch, probably reassigned most of the staff and felt like an untested game was great... the minimal patching is nuts for this game. 
---
Never noticed lol
---
And I care about downvotes why? All of it is from banned dupers that can't handle the truth. Cry harder, try hard loser.
---
Yeah, it really isn't.  High end for high end. 
---
225111 ultracite ammo? How do you "acquire" this much ammo? Serious question. I mean even if you are trading back and forth with other people and picking up and crafting all the time, ultracite ammo is relatively time-consuming to produce. Are you sure you didn't pick up some duper's stash or something?
---
This hurt to read. 
---
Their words and trust, they did.
---
I believe early on that Rockstar likely paid people across social media to badmouth this game, I have a friend in Russia that straight up explained that a government facility they work at was hired to promote Rockstar games at any chance they got on other media channels (and far too often even months after release I see people bring up red dead for no reason, trying to bash fallout)..
---
That said, I really do think that the damage done is so severe at this point that no one benefits if they were indeed being paid to talk shit.. anthem has enough bad going for it right now that I can't fathom them paying for anything except positive words for their game.
---
Yes, espionage is a real thing, yes there's "fake news" and fake reviews.. but this game threatens no one and nothing anymore.
---
I left on my own accord, but I’m not going to banter with some stupid fanboy. Enjoy your broken game 😂
---
Why? If their friends were cheaters then they deserved the suspensions.
---
Definitely bullshit. Unless he's one of those people who spray ammos into the air non stop.
---
I use automatic fucking laser pistol and i never need that much ammo. 
---
they were doing it for an achievement and trying to troll without being wanted
---
Fair enough, its just one of those things that you'd expect, since even companies like activision and take two are traded. I thought it was a pretty common thing in the gaming industry. never occured to me zenimax wasnt trade until I made this post.
---
Yes make the perks actually useful!
---
I've read about people getting banned for no reason kinda makes me not wanna invest time into something that may end up banned.
---
1. on PC, a second account is cheap. And you can run 2 simultaneously without much trouble if you have a decent computer.
---
2. yes, moving stuff around. Do you not like having a 600 weight stash? how about 5x \~2200 weight stashes?
---
3. other benefits. I have one "farmer" character on my second account that runs water purifiers and food, for restocking supplies and selling. He's also level 20 with high charisma for sharing perk cards, and has the Empath mutation for boosting my main with damage reduction as well as constant access to Strange in Numbers. And a free fast travel location.
---
Put it this way. I have pretty much sworn off of EA games. If I were "accidentally" banned, I might just be playing Anthem until Division 2 comes out. That's pretty big. So I just wonder, what market? Do you think this game, with all its crashes and disconnects is going to retain players once these games are out? 25k for an item will be the market, because the drops are so rare that without the dupers hardly anyone will have the item you really want.
---
What achievement is that?
---
I dropped a nuke on a CAMP that prevented mine from placing itself when I logged in. 
---
that is so badass
---
not exactly sure, but theres 2, one is placing functional items down and another is furnishes i think 
---
Yep, I promise it will work.
---
I have, I just tested it today
---
In the other side, it's embarrasing for a 3 digit character to go to discover a new event, to find there level 1-9 ghouls (me, yesterday, Arktos Pharma)
---
I've played solo 100% of the time since day one and have had 2 issues with players attacking me. Not game breaking. Switch server. 
---
?
---
I think you don’t seem to understand what a god roll is. 
---
A piece of armor with sentinel on it does not make it a god roll.
---
A piece of armor with sentinel/Assassin, vanguard/sentinel, bolstering/sentinel, unyielding/sentinel, and a beneficial major prefix such as +1 agi, +1 str, increase action point refresh speed.
---
Acquiring a piece of armor with sentinel on it is hardly a god roll, and I’ve acquired at least a dozen in my playtime.
---
But that's not what kind of game it is. That was made very clear before launch. 
---
For the last 24hrs we have held the server we are in right now and have been the only ones in the server the entire time, i spent the rest of the evening last night farming whitesprings and have since accumulated hundreds of 1* and 2* legendaries and either sold to vendor bots or just dumped out into the game world what i didnt want to keep and have also held workshops all over the map. I have spam crafted boiled water and other materials to keep our workshops running. My inventory is full and so is my stash. Do i have to worry about getting banned as well since i have a bunch of collected legendaries and have spam crafted a bunch of materials as fast as i can hit the space bar?  I dont have more than 1 of the same legendary items though i have had at one point over 40+ shotguns that scrapped for materials after clearing the super mutants from top of the world.
---
Anyway, i just got up to take a smoke break and im going back to farming legendaries in this private server that we have ( we have been alone in the server since 530am Sunday morning, no one has joined the server since then other than friends and were still in it right now) hopefully i dont get the ban hammer too.
---
Its racist 
---
are all the perk cards level 1?
---
how about one where all the exploits work, so they can walk around all lagged out and constantly rebooting.
---
Sure you keep telling yourself that. I’ll still play. I HAVE THAT OPTION..
---
Ima be 100% honest I dont care about the suspension I just wanna play on my main o would start I new account and play but i like my camp on my main lol
---
False. It allowed you to see the other person's inventory without them accepting your trade invite. You had to press the trade button twice in quick succession or something like that. It did not effect what was being traded. If you bought something while they were setting the price of another thing, it would set that price for the next item above or below it- but both users would see that the wrong item was posted, it was not a bug.
---
Okay, but do you recognize the difference between TF2 and Fo76?
---
Meh I can play anytime I want. No ones asked me to leave. Couldn’t care less what you think.. lolz
---
Same for AT&amp;T/DirecTV. I use to work in their retention dept.
---
I work in IT and I love calls like this.  "You don't want me to work on the problem?  Hey you got it man!"
---
No idea man.  That was a while ago.  Think i got the. Near harpers ferry in a shack or from the vendor.
---
I have it.
---
I still have all my grenades from when that was a thing will I get banned :( 
---
Yes, but you can misinterpret what you asked it to calculate. Computers are very literal. 
---
Lolz..
---
Not ultracite though. You need a massive amount of ultracite to get that many crafted.
---
Ps4 Not banned, and I'm level 150.  
---
I'm the opposite. I'd rather be banned than lose my items.
---
I had 2 nuke quantums but I turned them into grenades.
---
Kill credit damage is not simply tagging. You have to do a minimum % damage. It's low, somewhere between 1-3% would be my guess, but it's not as simple as getting a single bullet on the enemy to get credit.
---
Good for you? If you don't care then why spend your time writing lengthy posts about how disgruntled you are about dupers.  People like you often fail to understand the basics of life, good luck out there, you are obviously going to need it.
---
I haven’t been impressed by the shop. The last game that had a shop that actually sometimes got me buying was Star Wars old republic mmo. I’d like to see them come up to that level but first I want to see them finish the game and ideally let modders finish much of it that is about player preference and customization. The best classic games had that element. Wow classic is just one example, it wasn’t the first and isn’t the best example either. Just a popular one 
---
If u have modifiers on special, it doesn't count toward point values for cards. 
---
So it is Bethesdas fault people cheated?
---
This x1000
---
No - I’ve got 4, 1 rated cards
---
And 3, 3 rated cards. 
---
I've played SOLO 100% too…
---
 yes, you learn to live with it, but the game could be much better not having to deal with the gangs of schools kids and all that crap...
---
Taking cover is normal shooting mechanics....Your argument is nonsense.
---
In a game all about resources with a limited amount you can store, yes artificially inflating that storage is an exploit to me.  I'm tired of arguing with people about this.  If you don't share the same opinion that's fine, I'm okay with it.
---
I stopped playing weeks ago with no intention of returning, but please. Please tell me what I’m thinking 🤣
---
I farmed good weapons myself so I'm good if they give me my account back hopefully but yeah i understand what you mean finding weapons is rng and 90% of the time 3* legendarys give me nothing or 1* legendary so trading does help even if the item is something everybody owns
---
will all these sort of topics popping up I just think I would like to say [called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/amwz44/anyone_else_starting_to_default_to_skeptical/) about 2 weeks ago! :-p
---
No it isn't? How are you reading it?
---
Reading this is the equivalent to reading a story about a tobacco abuser complaining that they got cancer from the product. 
---
Don't blame Bethesda when the world has been kind enough to tell you what a shitty idea it is to deal with that game. Bethesda is guilty 100%, don't get me wrong, and you're a damn fool for sticking around. Put your faith and time into a game worthwhile.
---
You brought this upon yourself, bud. LEARN FROM IT.
---
I have no modifiers, effects or anything active on strength. 
---
Isn't the whole point of BoS underarmor to be worn under PA?
---
Dude, next patch (tomorrow? Only for pc. Or they already got patch last week. They are increasing stash to 800
---
I do that all the time with extras I don't want/need.. Good Karma 
---
Or better yet, play something that isn’t a shallow bug ridden joke of a survival game 🤔
---
I pick up everything but never picked up any large quantities of anything which is what I don't get.   
---
Like you, I have a mule character but on another account and another xbox but other than regular junk, that's about it and yes, it's overweight, weighing about 2000-2400 tops so not really that bad compared to some I've seen.   
---
I'm not sure what qualifies as "rare items" let alone 100,000 rare items.   
---
I have a 1 star 10mm 30% robot gun and a 1 star quad capacity combat shotgun. I did have a 2 star exploding shotgun but I died way too much...lo and traded it but that was early December.   
---
I made about 30 stimpaks on Saturday and bulked stuff I got from scavenging all day for so I really like to know from them since I got the same generic letter.   
---
I believe a lot of people got banned for picking up stuff no doubt but how do you know? 
---
I can't fucking believe Todd Howard put his name on this dumpster fire of a game. What a fiasco. smh
---
Bethesda is trying to commit suicide as a company.
---
They are not going to fix this; they are going to fuck it up even more.
---
I'm not a smart person, but even I have finally learned to recognize their pattern. 
---
Well there's your answer. You only have 13 points worth of cards. Next level up, pick a different SPECIAL but choose a strength card.
---
.... I can MAKE a prime gatling plasma with some scrap and some flux. 5-6k for what is still a top-tier legendary combo is a steal. 
---
Hell I could turn a TSE gatling plasma into a prime plasma for a hell of a lot less than 1250
---
(x) doubt

Unfortunately even though you've gotten a response from a CM you'll still probably be waiting over a month for a response from support.  My original email I received was January 9th that caused me to be locked out of my account.  I made a post on the subreddit about 20 days ago and got a response from a CM, I was finally allowed access back to my account on February 14th.  I have my doubts that making a fuss like I did on the subreddit actually did anything.
---
Useful info, thanks. However, my argument against the duplicates use is that it’s use is bloat. The interaction is a waste of time. The same result can be accomplished by awarding the next level card while not removing the initial and lower levels upon pick or pack roll. This reduces the number of level ups it takes to finish a perk max out and removes some bloat from the user experience. 
---
Along with the option to store any card to a back burner tab, the card system itself would become finished, optimal, and more free of its current annoyances without compromising its core design. 
---
My dream hope is to also gain a bobble and magazine tab where a limited number can be equipped in card form, and have cooldowns so that their benefit is limited in the same way it is now, minus the Eating them component which players all really dislike and would also highly appreciate a way to build and display them as collectibles. 
---
I’m 305 and going strong, but I’ve never had any large amounts of anything in my inventory. Any junk I pick up is usually crafted into ammo, which I burn through, or I just bulk and vendor extra junk I don’t use. I’ve bought ammo once, maybe twice from other people over the past few months - my most recent was 8000 regular 50 cal rounds with caps. 
---
So, long story short, never had a problem and still don’t, but I’ve also not tempted fate and never picked up anything I thought might be questionable. Which, actually, I’ve never even seen. I’ve read some people saying they’ve come across bags and containers with thousands upon thousands of whatever. I can’t say I have, but I sure as shit wouldn’t pick it up if I did see it.
---
And for those who are feeling these delusions, he is saying you may want to check out r/topminds but in reality those are the people that would make fun of you, what you're really looking for is r/conspiracy
---
They get to BETA test Survival mode.  No Adventure option.
---
&gt;That's entirely debatable dont you think? One of the biggest gripes about 76 is the lack of content right?
---
One thing that I see a lot of people not really taking into account is the fact that 76 is different then 3,NV and 4 much in the same way 1 and 2 are different from 3, NV and 4.  The previous 3D games were all single player action role playing games while 76 is a survival action role playing game.  The survival aspect of the game is part of the content. Granted it is a survival lite much in the same way Destiny/Anthem are/will be MMO lites.    
---
Simple acts such as forging enough steel, gunpowder and lead to keep your bullet counts up is part of the game. Much in the same way with ark mining iron, flint and stone to process them into bullets is part of the game play.  How ever an intermittent complaint I've seen flare up again and again is the complaint that you spend more in ammo to kill something then you get back. Which is trying to bypass that game play bit.   
---
&gt; Then your missing out man. In both games the environment is incredibly  interactive.  GTA alone had so many Easter eggs in it that it took years  to find them all and that's just Easter eggs.  The amount of story  telling in the environments in those games are great as well but RDR2  hit it out of the park.  The amount of detail inside RDR2 is something  that they should be very proud of as VG developers. 
---
I have played GTA 5. I can not walk into a room and pick up every object in the house. I can not trash Michel's house for shits and giggles. The only objects that you can interact with are very specific story related items. For example in one of the earliest Franklin missions when you are sneaking into Micheal's house to repo the car you can knock out the gardener. But you are unable to interact with the leaf blower in any way shape or form.  How ever in games like Skyrim, FO4 and 76 to a lesser extent I'm able to loot 90% of items placed in the game if not out right pick it up and move it around. 
---
&gt; Then that something telling you is 100% wrong. You can absolutely  stumble across someone's homestead and rob them blind.  You can come  across a bunch of cowboys or gangs camp and eavesdrop on a very detailed  conversation and decide to murder them. But of course you can't walk  into building in RDR2. But again let's be honest you cant do that in  Bethesda games either.   Yeah you can go into SOME homes and fuck their  shit up but not every single one. How many buildings were inaccessible  in FO4? How many buildings were inaccessible in skyrim? How many homes  are there in 76 that you arent able to go into? Dont judge something if  you haven't played it. 
---
Do you have a video of that because I tried to look and all I could find was someone robbing a specific chest from a homestead. Not walking into the building and taking all the planets, forks, pillows, etc.  And as I said before I never played RDR2 how ever it fits with how Rockstar and other game developers then to treat the game worlds.   
---
&gt; I think your kinda putting bethesda on a high horse here.  Is there a  bunch to do? Yeah but what game are we talking about? Because it  certainly can't be 76.  There plenty of open world games that give you  as much environmental interaction and environment storytelling as any  bethesda game to date. 
---
Yes and no because at least in Skyrim and Fallout the NPC's had a schedule and would move around across the day.   In other games anything that isn't a story related NPC is just procedural generated to do a simple task like walk in a line with only basic reactions build in.  Or if an enemy they just spawn in when you get within a certain distance.   
---
It is really noticeable on GTA Online were with enough players in a game lobby raising hell you can actually drive though areas that are completely free of all NPCs and their cars because the game lobby is over loaded due to all the police spawning in another part of the game.  Equally if all the players in the lobby are out in Grand Senenora Desert and you drive to vespuchi beach while you are speeding a long there will not be many NPCs that spawn there. But if you sit and wait the game slowly spawns more in around you.  It is also how you can manipulate car spawns to have high value cars like the Dubsta 2 spawn that can be sold for like 15-20k.  Once you get your first Dubsta 2 you can manipulate the game spawn to fill a 10 car garage in an hour or two depending on luck. While normally it would take days if not weeks the regular way because of how rare the spawn is.   
---
And in 76 rather like ARK the game server is keeping track of the movement of every NPC that spawns across the whole server.  That is why I can walk into a mine in the Ash Heap and see the corpses of the mole miners another player has already dealt with. 
---
&gt; That's great but I'm not sure why that's relevant to this.  It's not  okay that they become almost reliant on the modding community to fix  many issues with their games.   Im very happy that they allow mods but  to be honest I don't think it's as impressive as it was in 2008. 
---
Actual I think PC gamers are the ones becoming reliant on mods to play the game.  They are so use to mods that when presented with an actual game they reject it because it isn't like what they were use to. Rather on the same way people use to playing on boosted private servers on ARK would probably reject the game if have to played on official server settings.  That said the statement was more directed to coding.  The more spaghetti code they make to fix issues the harder it becomes for mod makers to come a long behind them and create modes that have to use the spaghetti code. 
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure Battlecry Studios has renamed to Bethesda studios Austin  but could be wrong.  I'll go so far as to say take anyone of BGS teams  or whatever you want to call them and WC still doesn't have the  resources or manpower or support that they do. 
---
It was but people seem to think that BGS Austin is the main studio for BGS not a subsidy of ZeniMax. Who laid off most of their staff in 2015 after their first game was canceled. And who only job after that was working with Id software with post release content for Doom and combining the Creation Engine with Quake Net code for Fallout 76.  Then co-develop FO76 with BGS. That is a lot of work for a company that literally never made a game before and for people to expect everything to be perfect.  And given ElderScrolls is still in development I'm more then willing to bet they dropped support for the game on BGS Austin's lap.
---
Odds are if they didn't rebrand Battle Cry Studios there would be a few less people complaining about BGS because they wouldn't assume it was their main office that was the only developer of the game. 
---
&gt; Its not exactly controversial to say that a medium sized studio has the  same advantages as another who's under the Bethesda umbrella. 
---
When the main studio is in Canada and the other studio is in Austin Texas it makes cross communication limited to e-mails, video calls and phone.  Particularly when that game studio was primarily focused on free to play style games. 
---
I have never personally duped or taken advantage of duped weapons or armor. However before they removed the old easy method all I did was server hop and look for suspicious groups of people in strange places. I'd pop a stealth boy and steak right up on them in the middle of duping and snag everything in the container they where using. Never got any guns or armor from it but I had a 500,000lbs of junk and ammo stored away on a level 2. Though that was way more than 30 days ago so what i think I got popped for was when I found some people out near whitesprings drop trading hundreds of nuka cola and then proceeded to appropriate them for myself. I was under the belief that Bethesda was just going to delete all the duped crap, which i was totally fine with. However they just decide to lock accounts with no warning.
---
Time to see if my credit union will do a chargeback. 
---
Oh yeah bethesda said on to a person reporting the same thing saying if a player has obtained any item over 100k of said item they will be suspended due to them most likely not gotten by legitimate means so it even flags you if you pick up a bag of a dupers junk when they died even if you dont keep it just having it in possession for any amount of time flags people bullshit but whatever
---
Ah look. A cheater defending a cheater. Boohoo.
---
So much this.  Don't take workshops if you don't want pvp.  You don't get to have these resources indefinitely 
---
...
---
If you want to play with others, I HIGHLY encourage making getting your mic working a top priority. I can't help you with that though; I'd suggest some googling based on your OS and stuff. 
---
Friends are all in the Social view, which you can view from the start screen, but also can view as an overlay at any time by hitting CTRL-TAB. You can only join a team if you are already on the same server as someone, but if you're friends with them you can use the Social view to travel to their server and then join teams there.
---
I don't know of any idiot's guide, and it'd have to be specific to FO76 anyway. You can use the Emotes key for some VERY rudimentary communication though.
---
Sounds like it would be fun, actually. 
---
It's just a game you piece of shit.
---
Should have nuked him instead
---
Some users are talking about this wave like it’s banning everyone alongside a few legitimate exploiters, however from some of the posts today, some of the banned claims are unsubstantiated and can be desputed via the OPs post history o 
---
May I ask, since I don't even know how to dupe, how I could have cheated? 
---
Oh this happened to me!!! I was not very pleased having gone through a huge load of ammo to do so. It's not the only quest to do this. 
---
with ammosmith and super duper on you can craft 360 rounds in one button push.. you have 1000 steel (like 1.5 - 2 runs of westek = 25 crafts for 30 min work roughly 5760 rounds\*) thats alot of .50 cal crafts and plenty of chances to proc super duper for 360 rounds per craft, it would be very very easy to craft over 10k rounds of .50 cal in just couple runs of westek and a good haul from lucky hole mine (i just left lucky hole with 387 ore, when smelted each one turns it into 5 lead.) you have plenty to craft in just an hour or 2 of work. 
---
\*on above statement i am assuming a fast killer not sneaking and moving slow, i can do westek solo in about 20 to 25 min sneaking and slow killing. i can do roughly three runs in an hour i pull about 600 steel from weapons in a run (using scrapper when breaking down weapons for more steel).   
---
25 crafts needs 250 lead (10 per), and 1000 steel (40per), each craft gives 180 rounds with ammosmith on, super duper has a 30% chance to double the craft to 360 rounds. assuming you get 7 procs of super duper out of 25 (about 30%) 18 crafts would net 3240, and 7 proc'd from super duper would net 2520.  
---
someone determined to not wanna farm rounds for their .50 cal sniper rifle can take 2 to 3 hours and break 20,000 rounds relatively easily. i know ive done it. until i switched to a lever action for my main i used a .50 cal sniper because i could craft more ammo for it than i could .308, i gladly took the loss of 1 damage going from 308 to .50 cal for easier ammo to get/make.
---
On PS4 there's an app
---
I wish I had that much ballistic fiber. 
---
Also, the issue on both consoles was because both companies were using crappy thermal paste and it wasn't applied well, it would dry out and get brittle, and the extra heat would lead to the solder connections on the CPU melting enough to cause issues.
---
Source: I used to work in a repair shop when this was a big issue.
---
Or.. you can believe Microsoft paid people somewhere or something something.
---
Did they not inform people of the change over? Part of the kick back was Bethesda announcing the change over due to manufacturers costs. They were honest but it did represent false advertising  and opened them up to a lot of lawsuits.
---
And you got spoiled meat in return. Godspeed, sir.
---
I've seen this happen before in a number of games, and in most of those situations all these posts are by cheaters trying desperately to get unbanned by claiming they're innocent.
---
Maybe you are innocent, maybe they did stuff up, but this does look like a very familiar trend and as such I don't think innocent players should be worried
---
why is too much ammo bannable? 
---
So you continue to repeat what I say.
---
HAHAHAHAHA! That's a 3 pointer! That's funny.  
---
Hope she didn't give you "Weeping Sores", should only last 15 minutes. 
---
So it's ok to bypass the developer's intent if it doesn't suit you?
---
I suspect dupers etc. would agree. Good luck!
---
Man I wanna be toxic but seeing someone enjoying themselves makes me happy.
---
Right and I saw that but I've only been over weight once coming out of the vault I picked up all the lead weights in Flatwoods...lol I learned not to do that again.   
---
As far as 100k of anything... I saw like 2,000 38 rounds dumped but nothing that high.   
---
If I did see junk I would have but not taken enough to go overweight.   
---
What in the 100k world wouldn't make you overweight? That was a rare item?
---
I totally agree with you. I didn't factor that into my comment.
---
Some users are talking about this as if *most* of those affected were banned unfairly, but really it seems to me that a lot of the bans have some legitimate reason and some other innocent players were “caught in the crossfire” as it were, accidental flagging due to mistaken variables.
---
Haven't been hearing a lot of good stuff about division tbh
---
Who said they haven't banned dupers?  Did you expect when they did all of the dupers would come around here to post about how unfair it was for them to get banned just for duping?
---
And the point of removing all but one item was so  they could clear out the excess without fucking over the innocent bystanders.  If you're an "honest" player and bought a weapon from a duper would you be fine logging in to find out Bethesda destroyed your favorite gun because someone else cheated to get it and now you're out a weapon and all the caps you paid for it?
---
Highly depends on your build, gun, etc. An instigating gatling gun will do far better than a furious gatling gun on everything but SB/SBQ, for instance. Whereas a furious minigun will do far better than an instigating minigun (both will still be pretty trash, though).
---
A bloodied gun of any sort will be top tier damage if you are committed to running a low health build, though. Running 20% health and Adrenal Reaction mutation, Nerd Rage perk, and a Bloodied heavy weapon (I'd recommend Gatling Gun or 50cal if you like the automatic heavy weapons) with Emergency Protocols torso mod makes you very durable in PVE and do a TON of damage.
---
Yeah I have too but I give most of it away to lower levels. I'm very item oriented person. I collect stuff. I get attached to stuff. But with the weight limits I have to let go of stuff. And most of the good stuff I find gets given away to lower levels. So if I did lose my items, then I wouldn't have much to fall back on. And I never found anything as good as what I traded for.

Its always bout the money and never the player, im sure that the majority of the letters being sent out are copies for minimum effort.  Im glad i stopped playing a week after it came out. Gotta love them devs for punishing players for crap they never envisioned. 
---
No fuckin way 
---
Same here! If the servers keep improving like the past few days, i am willing to throw a lot of money for this game to support it ! If they un-ban the cheaters then there's no hope
---
Yes.  I agree Warframe is awesome.  I'm on disability and throw myself into games. I spent 2 years playing most of my days and I only stopped when I burned myself out.  I would still recommend the game to anyone.  It's free to play and its not pay to win.  Their support is top notch.
---
https://youtu.be/Rt0spqQtMKg
---
I would have guessed they would take the weapon in that case but allow you to keep playing. Instead they just banned people but I’m not getting the 100k of rare items deal on the banning letters people show.
---
This was a shorter explanation to answer the specific person, I said exactly what you just did to somebody else in this thread
---
I agree with almost everything you’ve stated here, except quest building. Don’t get me wrong! It would be a great thing to have, but I don’t see it being possible on the official bethesda servers. In private servers, sure, but at that pount you just build your own mod that makes that a thing, and beth doesnt have to/wont do anything. 
---
The ‘build-anywhere’ idea tho I totally agree with. I play a lot of DayZ, and although the building isnt as in depth as FO76, they have this and it works fine. Bethesda’s fear was losing the player base due to online griefing and raiding, but an online multiplayer survival game *without* the risk of losing everything at a moments notice, is kind of boring. Having these things in FO76 would bring with it a *purpose* for pvp, a *reason* to team up with people and *roleplay* factions/clans/tribes. It would give me a goal to come back for: protect my town/base, re-build, stock supplies, interact with my neighbors/community, and/or be the *real* raider for once. If they did this, they’re would be no need to have human NPC’s in the game, we’d be able to *actually* create our own unique narative like they supposedly wanted.
---
And as for the whole testing for future WoW MMO contender thing, Bethesda put Elder Scrolls Online out years ago, which is literally an MMORPG like WoW... just FYI...
---
That's a weird nickname you gave it. Mine's the octogon.
---
Troll me pls, me likes free stuff
---
No you haven't.
---
Yeah and ima be real I know my story is the classic "I have never duped but real dupers are still online bla bla bla bla" but I have been a hardcore bethesda fan since fallout 2 came out and i dont care of people or you believe me when i say I have never duped or owned mass amounts of items because to many people saying there innocent is bullshit and thats the truth but im beong honest when i say i have been unfairly banned today and why would i dupe to throw away 400+ hours of my life
---
ye, only way I'll believe false bans at this point is if I log in and see a ban, and I don't play much nowadays so that's not likely to happen
---
they suck at trolling, the real way is spamming small letters around their home
---
U/ladydevann Another one
---
I read an article that said Dark Zone is viable for solo, as I play 99% solo that sounds good to me. But I read a Reddit post that said it's not. So I might not buy it instantly at release. I might wait and watch some streams and make a decision. Honestly though I wouldn't buy Anthem either. hehe. I'm just saying it like "if" I did get "accidentally" banned, which I'm not, so it's not going to happen anyway, but yeah banning people at this point in time is just a disaster for them really.
---
I don't get people like this, it's pretty clear you either duped or was given items by a duper
---
I'm wondering if I'm just... Not meant to be a gamer. I loved fo4, obviously has flaws but I enjoyed it very much. When I found out fo76 was online only, I created another character on fo4 and did all the things again. Tried the newest basketball game, didn't like that like I used to when I was a kid (has franchise mode become WORSE over the last decade or so?). Bought RDR2 a couple weeks ago, absolutely appreciate the graphics but I'm having a hard time getting into it. Rockstars battle system seems to have not improved since gta3. That's probably inaccurate but it's not exactly immersive. 
---
I feel like I literally just want a new elder scrolls/fallout every year or so (single player only) and I would be happy AF. I really want a fps, and I generally like COD, but it just seems like they recycle the same game every year for years now. 
---
Sorry about my rant, I don't expect a response lol
---
I just returned from a trip where that was exactly my objective.  Weapons, carefully chosen ammo to match the weapons, Stimpaks, food, drink, maybe a plan or two.
---
And I throw in a collection of spare quest holotapes just to mess with their minds.  
---
I don't understand. How would that be different from the current servers? Except for not choosing your own name, that sounds about right.
---
inb4 some dev tried to make a joke by tagging every account marked for future ban wave as "super duper" and this is actually what happened as a result
---
I mean honestly I assume you are lying and probably deserve the ban if that means anything. People don't want to go against the crowd and get down voted and you are a girl and posted a picture so you have that going for as far as getting sympathy online.
---
 At the end of the day every online game I have played has so many posts like this flood the message boards everytime a bunch of people get banned and the vast majority of times it turns out people will do and say whatever they can to get their accounts back and were banned for a good cause. 
---
I will say though if it was any other game I would be positive you are lying but I do have some doubt only because it is bethesda and how incompetent they have been with fallout 76 up to this point. I guess the only positive side is you will get your account back, eventually.
---
So long as there is a roll back occurring on server crashes etc.....dupping will always be possible....so unless that changes it will never be patched. That’s why it’s always this patch it will be fixed from them.
---
8000 scrap steel is an easy amount to come up with. A bit of ore, a bit of acid.. boom. When I craft ammo, steel is what I end up needing the most of, and that's a really really small figure when it comes to me crafting a large amount of ammo for me and my friends.
---
Also, realize that the pack rat perk reduces junk weight by 75%, and you can also stack for reduced weight for junk on your armor. It's risky, but 600 pounds of junk in your stash only weighs something like 150 pounds on you- you could have just happened upon someone who carried their stash and stored things you can't easily reduce the weight of.
---
Looking at your reddit history, you should delete that shit before claiming you are an honest player, just saying.
---
You know, I wonder if somehow it's related to Chameleon. My chameleon mutation wasn't triggering on my main (I stripped naked, nothing) but another player in game couldn't see me AT ALL even when I was fully in power armor. I haven't investigated beyond that one occurrence but it makes me wonder.
---
Also, we weren't even friends when it started, it was just some random lowlevel I came across near my CAMP
---
And he comes back with the typical comment of "idk how to cheat!! I'm innocent!!"
---
Did you know that everyone in prison is innocent? 😂🤣😂🤣
---
when u get killed. It says who killed u. He took my gamer tag and messaged me on ps4.
---
Cool, meet me in Junktown.
---
Yay! I might fire it back up again then!
---
he picked my gamertag off the killed by message.  maybe. or maybe from the player list before it alk went down. 
---
this would be a 300iq play but I somehow doubt that's the case. that would be way too smooth of an execution for what we have seen so far

Yeah exact same thing as I said to the other dude that commented Yeah and ima be real I know my story is the classic "I have never duped but real dupers are still online bla bla bla bla" but I have been a hardcore bethesda fan since fallout 2 came out and i dont care of people or you believe me when i say I have never duped or owned mass amounts of items because to many people saying there innocent is bullshit and thats the truth but im beong honest when i say i have been unfairly banned today and why would i dupe to throw away 400+ hours of my life
---
Good point, it's possible.  I assumed something nefarious as there were a lot of people spawning near the munitions factory and they were exchanging, but it could have been anything.
---
I find reading reddit history of these "innocents" interesting 
---
"Oh, i NEVER duped anything, i just found a bag of 5000000000 nuka-colas !"
---
I’m with ya! I’m in the same boat! My character weighs maybe 200 and I only have or had about 500 in the stash. So not sure how they can say I’ve had 100k of anything let alone rare items. 
---
I admit I have lame 1 Star guns, I don’t PvP and just wander doing quests... 
---
I had a shotgun the exploding kind and traded it with someone here for a quad capacity 1 Star due to me killing myself about a dozen times...lol
---
Okay, so number one. I'm a girl, so not a "he". 
---
And I could give you my xbox gt and you could see that I have an insanely low score because I very much suck at any and all video games. I have a hard enough time using two joysticks at once.
---
They'd make it up because people in general tend to be vindictive assholes.  Even cheaters get pissed off when they get caught cheating and go looking for revenge and the easiest way to do that around here is to play innocent and try to start an angry mob over how  much Bethesda sucks.
---
This is why when the first complaints about this popped up there wasn't even any mention of people getting banned, people were just complaining about the error message as if it was Bethesda's authentication servers shitting themselves and stoking outrage over how Bethesda wasn't "fixing" the problem of telling anyone what was wrong. 
---
Then someone let it slip that they got an email saying they were banned and everyone figured out that the first people complaining about it were full of shit and hadn't been telling the whole story.
---
Where you suspended?
---
Old bump but maybe useful in future for someone, i finally found the wedding ring. Go to the monorail elevator head west into the mountains and follow the old tracks theres one big metal pole and the next pole will be a concrete white pole. Its there, theres a green camper half submerged and a lawn chair the rings on the chair.
---
My boyfriend usually uses the second controller to guide my character around to help me.
---
Guy with 900 hours makes a great alibi 2 days before the ban wave. Creates post where he explains his routine and all. His post becomes famous and when he gets banned 2 days later he cries that he's legit and used his second account only to store items - ha !
---
Scotty, we need more screws! 
---
"I didn't hack, it must have been my brother playing my account."
---
\- Every kid ever banned in the early 2000's.
---
The servers have improved a LOT . If dupers stay banned i am willing to spend a lot of money on this. 
---
Idk why the downvotes but ya, I guess I am. Can you share any tactics or have any advice for PVP of this level. I have balnecedish fights sometime but sometimes I get wrecked and sometimes  my attackers go down fast as hell. I like PVP but it sounds like I need to learn some shit. If you can help at all I'm listening
---
You think Stalin cry? Off to Gulag now. 
---
&gt;Bought RDR2 a couple weeks ago, absolutely appreciate the graphics but I'm having a hard time getting into it.
---
RDR2 is a good movie but a bad game,as a game its extremely slow and boring  so i can get you on that one 
---
&gt;I really want a fps
---
well there is a huge fps market with games like borderlands 2,apex legends,dusk,far cry 5 ,metro exodus
---
Controlled mutation choice without spending hours trying to farm the right combo? Hell yes. On PC you can find them for 100-150 caps with mats, 500 without mats (And I know a guy who does it free if you provide mats). 
---
And I'd guess most people who have learned the recipes got them from SBQ drops/traded with people who got them from SBQ drops.
---
Have you been keeping track of who has actually been complaining about it?  I haven't but what I have noticed is that there is A LOT of cross over with the same people complaining about it over and over in different threads.  A vocal minority may get a lot of attention, but it's still a minority.  If Bethesda had fucked up to a degree where they were false positive flagging accounts for all of the simple crap people are claiming they've done this entire subreddit would be flooded with complaints.
---
Read the TOS they don't need to show you anything. They can ban you at any time for any reason and there is nothing you can do about it. 
---
BLYAD' DER'MO NOT THE GULAG AGAIN
---
I don't get why some would be so vocal about not-believing those stepping forward saying they were unfairly banned. 
---
If the past consisted of Bethesda putting out a polished game with a fairly low # of bugs and those bugs that were present were addressed in a timely manner with no further bugs being introduced in the process, then yeah I would probably be doubtful also.   
---
But the reality of this all is that the # of bugs and stability of this game has been beta level at best, the fixes that they have put into place have many times introduced other issues.   They have broken other things in the process of fixing other things.  They have introduced older versions of code into the process of fixing new bugs, bringing old bugs back in addition to new bugs.   Pretty bad in most peoples opinions, so this makes it a real possibility that they are WRONG, and yet they screwed up again.  It would be the logical  collusion based on past behavior.  It seems that some of you all you need to see is the word cheater (or duper in this case) and that's all you need to get the pitchforks out, pretty narrow minded given the circumstances.  To those that have been unfairly banned, they are doing you a favor you just don't know it.  
---
I dont wanna be godlike I'm sure it took alot of effort n time to get there. I jus wanna have fun for real even if I lose sometimes, I know using mustations and serums helps alot but what else am i missing??
---
No, they said it was a 'lack of materials' like canvas is made of fucking diamonds.
---
as a disabled person, I too understand this.. 966 hours for me. Pain keeps me awake, and the alternative to this is Cable tv and you can only take so much of that. It's a social thing for me, when you can't get out and deal with real world people then this is all you have. 
---
But where in the ToS does it state that you can't pick up a loot bag that has a lot of junk items that you have farming for? honestly, if I broke an actual rule, please show me. Until then, I would at least be able to communicate with Bethesda and work this out. Even if I have to have my junk wiped off of my account, I don't care. As I've said before and I'll say it again, I love this game to death. I played the B.E.T.A. and have loved exploring West Virginia ever since. I have defended this game tooth and nail against all haters and trolls saying how bad of a game it is, the excessive whining of those who want a refund, and those who just hate it without even playing. I understand that the excessive junk items are hurting the servers, and for that reason, I would gladly purge my junk inventory to keep the game running smooth. I just want to be able to play the wonderful game that Bethesda has published, the game I bought at full price and would pay full price again for. I don't however want to spend my time just waiting around for the patch, being harassed by people who claim that I am lying and I should not get access to this wonderful game. Sorry it did not happen to you, but for those of us who were wrongfully banned, we care. 
---
apparently the pvp servers are supposed to be tested/balanced sometime in march. that is it as far as announced content currently. this isnt capcom. they didnt hack finish data off the game to sell back day one.
---
I have been replying to what you have been saying. You are trying to equate two separate actions that are night and day difference as the same thing. 
---
You are literally saying because Tommy can cook it means he can fix a car based only on his ability to cook food. Or the reverse that because James knows how to rebuild a transmission it means he can cook like the finest chefs based only on watching him work on cars.
---
And that is were the perfection comes into play.  Because they haven't done the best in a separate unrelated event it automatically brings then down to the same level of validity.
---
This is doubled down by this same sub reddit jumping heavily on the Bethesda is banning people for crafting without providing any proof band wagon pretty hard against Bethesda.  And the Bethesda is making the game f2p and the whole pay to win atom shop.  Since I've been posting here no issue is to small no rumor was to unsubstantiated for people to jump on the complain about Bethesda band wagon.
---
In this case Bethesda is far better reputation then players do.
---
Well.
---
Do you have any screenshots of your inventory?
---
This is great.  My brother was one of the people who got killed and his base destroyed.  Thanks for the grieving of the a hole griever. 
---
Your comments try to tell a different story.
---
Thanks but no news on Pve dlc I was hoping something to do with the vaults
---
Honestly, This guy and everyone elses complaints is bs. I talked to a dev directly (friend)  they stated that this process is pretty fool proof. When an item is dropped, looted, or whatever it has a unique identifier. When an item is duped the identifier is BASICLY the same expect an added digit. So for instance 0xab2 would be duped to like 0xab21. The thing is the sequence is randomized and they're not supposed to follow a pattern so dupers stick out. Also they have logs on what's crafted. The reason why they said it's non-negotiable is because they have undeniable proof you're a cheater or received duped items from someone. Just be glad it wasn't a permanent ban or character wipe.
---
Oh? Do you have link? Because I swear it was production costs. They estimated the cost far lower then it turned out to be so they announced they were going with cheaper version.
---
On each entrance? No, what you do is cover the place in turrets all facing in, towards the terminal. When they pick the lock they go hostile, and a dozen turrets all open fire. If they try to get smart and damage a turret, same thing. 
---
Now that’s just evil 
---
They are mostly lying. Anyone play tarkov? Remember all the people claiming to be false banned and in the end from 1000 claims like 1-2 where false ban but they had very shady behaviour.  I dont want to say nobody got false banned but the majority did some shady stuff
---
Sorry, what I meant was why the assault rifle??Jus for fun? Handmade does alot damage and is the best semi auto rifle ingame unless I'm wrong(lol ot happens)
---
I'm honest. I got banned from a game before and I went to the forums and was honest about it. I said straight up, everyone else was doing it, so I evened the odds. It's their loss. I was the good guy in a bad situation and I loved the game, so I evened the odds against the cheaters and also cheated. I got banned and explained the situation honestly. I didn't expect any sympathy or to get unbanned. But if they didn't allow the cheating for so long then I wouldn't have thought it was ok to do it. It was funny I had played the game for a while, and practically everyone was doing it except me. As soon as I did it the banwave comes. That's my luck. 
---
I didn't dupe in this game. It's kinda obvious you'd get banned for that. I didn't do the xp glitch or weight glitch. Even though you'd probably get away with it. Though you wouldn't in most games. I think a lot of people still see this as a beta. And I don't blame them. That's the state the game is in.
---
All those have a strong online multiplayer matchmaking like COD? I thought I've read apex is another battle royale thing... Loved far cry 5, but it's totally different from COD. Kinda wish I could keep doing compound takedowns but once I did them all that was it. 
---
The rest of us are pretty glad you stopped playing too. Thanks for taking one for the team.
---
It's a good story, hard to believe, but good.  Try to video capture the fun next time.
---
Well seeing how the community has lied repeatedly to drive outrage and hate for this game. Yeah I'll take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Look man I'm not trying to turn this into a Bethesda bash because I really like them. Youre obviously a very big supporter of bethesda since your clearly in the know about their company make up and I like them as well so this isn't a shit on them attempt by me.   But You're talking about games you haven't even played and even making assumptions about them.  I have yet to play a game with the amount of detail and environment storytelling like in the world of RDR2. In that game you can walk into homes and rob people.  No not tin cups and desk fans but consumables and loot to sell.   In GTA I do remember being able to walk into establishments but your right never a persons home. It was always some place like a store or bar or club. Something of that nature.  I didn't know that you can walk into every single building in 76 and skyrim and FO without a single one being inaccessible.
---
Bethesda has put out great gems over the years a definitely deserve praise and support but they can't be excused. Others can excuse possibly the largest studio continuously putting out bug riddled games but I expect more of them when smaller studios are putting out better quality products.  I know there are a bunch of different studios for Bethesda but I also remember Todd continuously repeating that all the studios had a hand in 76 and how it was a team effort.  No one there gets a pass for how 76 has gone when I really believe they could've done a lot better than what we got.  I know Bethesda can be better and just cant give them a pass because of who they are and let's face it that's been going on for years.  It just works right?  
---
The fans have become reliant on the Mod community? Maybe.   Just as relevant as bethesda has become I would say.   But then again that's the fault of the developer to let it get that far.   Thomas the tank engine mods are cute and funny but having to download a mod to make the grass look like grass is inexcusable. 
---
It's pretty safe to say that someone who doesn't know the difference between exploiting a game and hacking doesn't deserve to have their opinion respected. Also, they didn't ban cheaters, they put them in the bad sport lobby with other players they decided broke rules, for an increasing amount of time based on how many times they've been punished.

Haha don't worry about it. There are lots of bitter 12 year old kids in this subreddit.

Anyways I don't really know what to say, but I have a full set of Heavy Combat with Unyielding+AP Refresh (trying to upgrade to Unyielding Cavalier AP Refresh), Nerd Rage, Radicool, bunch of mutations etc. I have around 450 AP and my Anti Armor DCG with 40% swing speed and 90% reduced weight hits for 1200 dmg.. 1500 if Rad Worms is active and 2000 dmg if both Rad Worms and Strange In Numbers is active.

borderlands 2 is a co op looter shooter
---
Apex legend is a br but very good
---
metro exodus and fc5 are SP shooters
---
overwatch has strong mp matchmaking AFAIK rainbow six siege too just ask on /r/pcgaming 
---
Warframe's certainly a smart choice. 2,000~ hours and the game still feels great for me. Can be a steep learning curve, however 
---
Yup! and received the honorary letter: [https://imgur.com/mklmf8p](https://imgur.com/mklmf8p)

My ticket hasn't been answered and Bethesda Customer Support via Twitter told me to reply to the email I received... well the emails email address was  "[no\_reply@mailmw.custhelp.com](mailto:no_reply@mailmw.custhelp.com)"... businesses make emails like this so people don't reply... no one monitors it.

Some have but you can only craft the bos helmet when it happens, that's what I've heard.

Ya ever heard of Metro
---
You found 200,000 cola’s and didn’t think that was odd? Lol 
---
This game should be renamed Fallout: Windows Vista memorial edition.
---
Lol close enough 😉😂
---
LOL!
---
Even better! I just wish I had known that before I bought the damn thing! I still hold out hope that given a year or so, it can become good.  Definitely not holding my breath, though.
---
There's a shack that one might use for hunting... in a certain part of the map that can trigger any of the cryptids to spawn in the area. It was so bad people built bunkers...

Instead you sold them to other players, didn't you?

---
I tried to create a fan-curve by myself and it works great. Gpu stays cooler and the fans on my MSI card are still quiet at 60-80%. 
---
The only reason I capped fps at 100 is: it allows me to play the game at max setting without getting any stutters (except load-ins if I run fast through the world, maybe because it’s not installed on a ssd?) 
---
From what I’ve read on the internet, not only fps are important to make your games feel smooth, you also need matching frametimes. 
---
I honestly don’t understood most of the things I read  about frametimes and how to controll them, but, for me, if I cap fallout 76 at 100 fps, it’s way smoother than at the 144cap. 
---
The best frametimes for smooth gameplay on different fps caps are these:
---
30fps = 33 ms
---
60fps = 16ms 
---
120fps = 8 sec
---
144fps = 7sec
---
So; if I cap fallout 76 at 100 fps on max settings playing on 1440p with a msi gtx 1080 nonti I get 10ms frametimes most of the time without any spikes. 
---
But last time I played the game with 144fps cap my frametimes went totally crazy from 40ms to somewhere below 10 in rare scenarios. But to be fair, it was early after the release of fallout 76. 
---
So maybe it was just an optimization problem early on or my gpu is to weak to achieve the low frametimes at 144fps cap to make the game feel as smooth as it should be.
---
Maybe you can help me understand how to controll frametimes and what causes extreme frametime jumps in fallout 76? 
---
I saw my first at Pylon V13.  Some level 100+ was sniping him from on top of the pylon while it was fighting other shit on the ground .  I snuck in a few Dragon shots from behind lol. 
---
ok what would stop you from using the perk then overloading your stash the unequipping the perk that's why it doesn't work on your stash
---
Thank you
---
Sorry, not sure why the link didn't work. You can copy and paste though. 
---
Also AFAIK they didn't say anything about it, just shipped out the shitty bags.
---
You arent the only one, watch when inside the vault is due to be posted, people ask repeatedly if it is going to be posted and then complain about no info when it is.
---
Yeah I sent 3 support tickets and friend bought 120k .50cal ammo yesterday and got suspended today and he sent a ticket but they havent responded to use either
---
No offence meant, but I don't understand how it can be that bad. I never run out of ammo and I can wander all day doing several events or a quest, scavenging good materials spots (usually I hit up hotspots for screws, ballistic weave, and steel and lead and take whatever other junk is laying around and bulk it and sell it if I don't need it), and clear one low level area of enemies (for low cost ammo drops), and kill about 3 or 4 nuisance scorchbeasts a session. I'm level 86 and I have a decent one star (no explosive though) legendary of every ballistic ammo type (except .50 cal) so I cycle from one gun type to another so I use all the ammo I collect (except energy and fire weapons which I don't like or use at all). Most people dump their .38 ammo.. I use mine. A .38 auto perforating mag combat rifle with all perk cards is really good even non legendary. A way to really conserve ammo though is to do the sandman perks and the sneak perks and use a suppressed weapon. You almost always get the sneak critical as long as you're crouched, and it cuts your ammo use in half by dealing 2X (or more) damage. Also, if your GF wants CAMP plans for cheap just take workshops (you get a plan) and wait a minute and do the initial workshop defend event (another free plan) and then server hop before someone kills you for the workshop. You can get almost all the camp plans that way for very cheap (you get 20 caps for clearing a workshop and it costs 25 to claim an empty workshop so net cost of 5 caps).
---
The fact that they ban people from such a piece  of shit game is a joke in and of itself. 
---
Why does anyone bitch about this game anymore? 
---
I feel you. I paid full price and was extremely hyped to play, then extremely disappointed.
---
I could care less if I got banned. I logged in the other day for the first time since the original dupe glitch and it was still the same old trash. Game sucks. 
---
dude i do pvp all day everyday. trust me. 1 shotting this dude was a piece of cake.
---
Scroll through my posts and u will see my raider guide or how to deal with griefers.
---
Today was just trolling lol
---
I mean what have the players ever done that should make people double guess panics like this?
---
Other than the time people started a panic that cheaters could steal your entire inventory just by initiating a trade while they had a weapon drawn... or started a panic after the first round of patches that Bethesda had destroyed stealth builds by nerfing Sneak... or started a panic that Bethesda has patched out server hopping... or started a panic that people were getting banned for installing client side mods... or started a panic that Bethesda was going to remove dupes by wiping peoples entire accounts...
---
Oh my gosh, that's so interesting. As I typed that out, I suddenly felt very uninformed on how this all works (hence why I put "servers" in quotes!), so I was hoping for a response like this one! Thanks very much for the info :D
---
Check this... create a ticket about an exploit, I did and it was looked at in under 10 minutes... try it, not kidding. 
---
Bethesda CS said all tickets regardless of type are answered in order so I’m taking it as banned players don’t get responses since we’re banned. 
---
(I created an account with another email to log the ticket) 
---
I like how you have 264 karma. But your history only has this post and no comments. I’m suss on this account 🧐
---
What's wrong with using a second account to store items? I do this for the legendaries I find 
---
It was a wasteland smash.
---
Are you banned?
---
Nope
---
I was suspended for picking up junk off peoplve ive killed. I do it to at least inconvenience the dupers but i guess ill fuck myself.
---
And I thought I had no life...
---
Its 366071 he had 140960 on an alt account 
---
I bought the plans from vendors. 
---
You know. At launch, within like 3 casual play days, I had easily 600 or so .308
---
It's not a stretch for it to have added up over 900hours of play. Even with drop nerfs.
---
Calm down lol I said nothing about losers or not liking this game. I legitimately was surprised people still play it. I've often been the only one on a server. I'm still subbed in it because want it to be something it's not. Seems like it's improving slowly, but as a die hard Bethesda fan I was let down.
---
I also store things i find but on the same account , no need for a second one.Many people were exploiting the game with a second account resulting into duping items.
---
You know how you fix the economy of this game? Make pve servers.
---
Yeah this is what I sometimes do when customer support ignores me. Be really mean to the person on the phone and shit. Nothing personal but my inquiries are faster if I do this.
---
Didn't they use Zendesk for their support? lol it'd be funny if you some how got one of them to respond to the email with: #priority urgent
---
I mean ... 
---
First off, if you market a game to people as 'It's a multiplayer Fallout 4! It's a Bethesda game! It's a big, crazy sandbox! Do whatever!' What would you expect other than players pushing every boundary possible?

Would you ban someone for duped items in a public Minecraft server? Of course not. To what end? It's just about having stupid fun. Isn't that what this game, *a game where you drop nukes on the heads of other players* is supposed to be about? You can't just push players into that mindset, then all of a sudden act like this was supposed to be a serious, competitive E-Sport all along retroactively! 
---
Second, Even the laxest creative sandbox games like Garry's Mod, Minecraft, and Rust never had any dupe glitches as readily accessible as Fallout 76. Being able to dupe because of an out of bounds error when having 300 of the cheapest item in the game? Coommee on. They didn't even attempt to program in / the engine was never stable enough to have the necessary safeguards in place for a serious, stable MMO economy. The players exploited the game, alright. But if it is going to be an account terminating infraction, you don't think it might have been in the developer's best interest to put in some beefier security than what amounts to 'the honor system' *before beta*?
---
This is all so crazy and backwards. If it was a 4 player, co-op Fallout that you and your friends could mod and cheat in to your heart's content, no one would have a single complaint ...   
---
Sprint has the same, though we were never fired for attempting to dissuade the customer.
---
It is viable for solo. Significantly better and more balanced than the original Division’s DZ, which was a real fuckfest if you didn’t grind every day to keep up with everyone else.
---
Bethesda should never try to make an online game ever again.
---
I have never seen a development team so incompetent as this one.
---
Yes but the amount of Steel you need will bankrupt your stash. 
---
.50 Cal - 10 Lead 40 steal per 100 or 180 with Ammo smith. With super duper working at 1/3rd return,  that's around 1500 scrap steel alone. That's 50 bulk steel, or 75lbs of steel in your stash. The 370 lead you'd need isn't difficult though. 
---
I'm a heavy gunner with a Gatling Gun and I'm always hoarding steel, and that's for a weapon type that's only 15 lead and 30 steel. I might craft 5000-6000 in a long day of playing and that's with a route that heavy favors steel collecting. 
---
It is acquire that amount of caps. Things like that are ways over time.

There’s a a sign out there that has commie written on it something along the lines I’ve I’m not a commie but I see where they’re coming from my gt is CommunistRaptor and love to walk around with the sign
---
I wonder how many of those players woke up this morning to find out that they've been banned?
---
Bruh you are literally selling duped items in your post history I'm sorry they bagged you and you're salty
---
Well I have heard of communist posters 
---
I saw someone mention before if someone takes my workshop, I should be given the option of pvp, not automatically dragged into it.
---
You don't need that much ammo.
---
Nope this is the way for the underpaid cs worker to be fired. It never not worked for me.
---
I’m an old player and found Reddit to help me get through quests like many other pages. Trying to learn tips and tricks also any updates on fixes like being trapped in power armor and so on. 
---
I’ve been on since the BETA and liked it even though the server disconnects were frustrating. I still stuck with it. 
---
I admit I picked up stuff but nothing that would make me over weight ever, unless I was doing Uranium fever then I could scrap it after. 
---
I just got over level 100 so not sure why honestly especially the 100k in rare items????
---
The more I follow the FO76 saga, the more I worry about the next Elder Scrolls.
---
My guess is there is no appeal because it is not [permanent.It](https://permanent.It) is not a ban, it is a suspension. I would hope it is lifted with tomorrow's patch and if not then they give some kind of actual time frame for those who were suspended.
---
Increase the stash
---
Bethesda itself will have set an internal SLA for their customer relations department.
---
I got banned for week on this reddit for yo mama joke and u get 230upvotes? THIS IS NOT FAIR!!! WHERE IS LOVE FOR RAIDERS !?!?!?
---
I installed Twitter just to wait for this (and other) announcements
---
What really sucks is the loot, you absolutely won’t get any legendary even from a level 80 SB, when some fat ghoul in WS walk around with a bloodied 50 cal in its pocket. The reward system is just silly and needs to be completely reworked. 
---
Not even Bethesda wants people to play FO76. 
---
I think and this is just my opinion that what they are doing this time is during the sweep all the accounts where flagged somehow so Bethesda has issued temporary bans to give them time to thoroughly review the accounts before issue more permanent bans also some people are repeat offenders so they want to make sure they have patched it properly before letting them back in the game. Again this is only my opinion and we all know opinions are like A holes everyone has them and they all stink. 
---
Pathetic response.
---
This is my problem exactly I would love to know what Items I came into mass contact with I've heard so many different things that its just rare weapons that its caps junk ammo either way there isn't enough information and there blanket statement is an insult.
---
Okay, but it has no teeth because no one external can hold them accountable. 
---
I found if you don't hoard, you never need any of the weight reduction perks.  Save the points for something useful.  It was hard on my first character.  My second character, however, rarely has more then 120 pounds on him.  
---
Source?
---
I'm willing to pay atoms or caps for this
---
Interesting read. For any that don't want to click the link, the developers basically tried to see what software was running on users PC, but the game isn't given admin rights, so all they got was an empty hash. The empty hash was blacklisted as cheating software, so if another user was logged into your computer, it could not see what software was running for the other user and they would get flagged as cheating.
---
I wonder if Bethesda is making a similarly amateur mistake, if people who've crafted a lot of ammo are getting pulled into this or something equally mundane.
---
They really should have limited it to nukacola, as it would be common sense that 99% of people duping were duping literal caps, not just "rare junk". You can't reasonably say you've found out purchased say 10k cola, and it would be a simpler thing to prove on the developers side.
---
And if they **didn't** dupe nukacola, they almost certainly didn't dupe junk.. unless they're idiots?
---
They could also check for realistic numbers of highly rare drops like serum recipes, something I know absolutely ruined the markets.. would be hard to argue that you've found 50 of any of them, but the ones duping them likely created far more.
---
You should've let Bethesda police the dupers.
---
i think its just your awful personality. even if someone agreed with you, you come across real shitty
---
I absolutely believe it

Good bot 
---
Exactly! Duper’s could appeal and many duper’s still played and after all the fixes and stuff being deleted they do this... 
---
I see a few posts by people admitting they duped and still playing... 
---
People selling a ton of 3 star legendary weapons here and knowing that it’s rare to get any yet they have 10???? Really? 
---
I know players level 150 and above who NEVER got a 3 star exploding ever in any drop so how does one player get 10 or so many like all the time? And still play? 
---
&gt;Pull uhp the social tab, highlight player and join game on them.
---
... how?? Do I have to invite them to my team? Add them as a friend?  
---
So I'm basically always at the mercy of that particular player(s)?
---
Me and my friend put stuff in the cash register at artisans corner shop all the time..... generally it’s all the stuff we did not want from a nuke zone
---
Most the people who have complained about getting banned on here have admitted to participating to some degree in duping. I wouldn't worry if you're clean.
---
I'm thinking maybe I responded to you and I meant to respond to someone else, reading it again it's clear you weren't the intended person.. sorry.
---
Yea it works both ways. Though I do think having the enemies scale to whatever level you are ....per person  would probably be good . So weather your 1 or 1001. All the content is viable for you.
---
90% of them were cheaters. The other 10% were griefers who took it upon themselves to police the wasteland, most of the people they harrassed were just as innocent as they were.
---
How did you move like at all after all that??? lol that’s some serious weight! Seriously... just wondering...
---
Over 225k ultrcite ammo made in 30 days? Questionable. 
---
Yeah, I've obtained that mod from scrapping. Took many bits of combat armor to get though
---
Saw a discord member lose a weapon from his inventory. All I've seen this far 
---
Are you saying you were banned?
---
I don't own FO76, but following the game for the Schadenfreude, and to see if it ever drops down to &lt;$10, probably won't, but that's what I'd pay for it. 
---
Anyways, I gotta say that some apologist bullshit. From reading the post the guy didn't accumulate 100,000+ of something, Bethesda just seems to be tracking it in an inaccurate way. Also saying that it's not a big deal and he should play another game or buy aother copy is crazy. He paid for the game and seems to be one of the more loyal users, these are the customers companies should want to keep.
---
You'd probably be upset if your account was banned. And that's my piece.
---
&gt;  It only happened on units from a specific factory, I believe in China - after investigation it was discovered that a Microsoft employee had paid the factory workers off.
---
Do you have a citation for this? To me you sound like the liar.
---
And there's another crybaby. If you think I'm offensive, what are you doing on the internet, least of all Reddit? Lmao. Always happy to trigger people.
---
I played and quit the game day one, and just restarted playing a week or so ago.  I feel pretty safe from the ban hammer with my level 15.  I'll just keep plodding along unable to finish a few quests due to bugs, or spawning near my invisible base getting attacked by an invisible whatever.
---
Pretty wild stuff. This needs more attention

“I simply enjoy playing Fallout 76”

So you’re the one...

Me and my gf started about a week ago. Hit us up if you two what to kill crap with us from time to time. 
---
Lotta wooosh in these comments
---
True, but I doubt it's impossible. There were farming guide literally within a week. So if someone really went hard...maybe? And of course trading for supplies to do so is...well questionable. 
---
Just wondering... Any low levels been banned?
---
[Bethesda themself] posted on this sub, just about a month ago. (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/?st=JSBBEP5A&amp;sh=6a6d0133) 
---
Not answering the question to make over 225k in 30 days.
---
Creative use of hijacking a highly discussed topic on Reddit to drive traffic to your social media pages. Should get a job in marketing.
---
Do you happen to have a screen shot or something?
---
Otherwise all we have is a he said she said between you and bethesda with things like the emails and [reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ars37j/error_482000_why_is_there_not_more_noise_over/egqnrj3/?context=3) saying it is 100k rare items.
---
Not saying you are lying, just suggesting you beef up your case since trolls are already poisoning the well with claims like they just bought the game and got banned in an hour.
---
Here’s what you should do.  Take all of the time you were putting into playing this game and instead use it to figure out how to fuck over this gaming company.   A person with as much free time as you have can come up with a very creative way of getting your revenge.   I’d steer by charging them back (if you bought it with a credit card).  
---
i believe it.
---
we've seen this before where a bunch of random ads people show up bitching about trade stealing or some exploit that lets griefers not get wanted, or getting banned because you crafted too fast. 
---
and it always turns out to be fake.
---
always. 
---
Reddit has become self aware...
---
Where I work it's as simple as stating you're a VIP and us being able to verify it.
---
Never seen anyone with - Karma. Toxic fuck.
---
Will do. I'm on Xbox. GT is UnicornQueen971 😊
---
That's the problem with the way they did level scaling. Mobs have set levels and the first person there spawns them. Something like the way World of Warcraft does it works better. Zones have level ranges and mobs and players effectively scale to each other, programmatically. If a level 30 and a level 50 are in the same zone, fighting the same creature, the level 30 sees it as a level 30. The level 50 sees it as a level 50. When the level 30 does damage the damage is scaled to deal an appropriate percent of damage for their stats. Same for the level 50. Two different people who are 20 levels apart can fight the exact same creature, at the same time, and both get the same challenge from the fight. Now, granted, it took them over a decade to put something like that into effect but it works a hell of a lot better than the half-assed way it was done in FO76.
---
Thanks much!
---
Buy a ps4 with taxes;)
---
This explains why I have to talk to to folks with little technical knowledge before they transfer me to someone who can actually understand what my problem is. Believe it or not, but that makes me feel a lot better about the hours wasted on the phone before I get to talk to the right person and get it fixed in minutes.
---
Yup! Put my ticket in and even responded to the email per Bethesda Customer Service via Twitter. 
---
I wanted to know what I did wrong. I know I didn’t dupe anything nor did I pick up that much of anything... that’s a lot of stuff especially rare stuff! 
---
I don’t expect anyone to believe anyone, I just want to know. 
---
Only thing I can think of was shooting in the windows at White Springs by tennis court... like the side or back window so you could kill ghouls... did that a lot with a 1 Star quad capacity combat shotgun... had to farm materials to make shells literally all the time. 
---
So again I just want to know what triggered in on my account so I tend to believe a lot of others getting banned... not all but many. 
---
But Pvp is part of the game. Doesn't matter who the others are. Pvp is always on. 
---
Level 77 Xbox not banned and i don't exploit or dupe and barely found out what that was.... Kind of lol
---
We seems to have two different e mails. One that just lists vauge over 100k and ones that list specific items like 225k ultracite ammo in 30 days.
---

Act like your 13.

Gotcha, I have no mutations but a few decent legendaries(weapons n armor)

Nah, just give them a Dunce hat. They can always wear a different hat but everyone will see the Dunce hat. Even in power armor.

I would but I'm right next to the workshop that has both gold and acid.
---
Odd issue I've been getting recently: when I harvest plants I lose ammo. 
---
I'm 300 hours in and have never seen one, despite regularly visiting the locations listed as likely spawns.  
---
So from my perspective, you're quite lucky.
---
More crybabies. 🤣 
---
Interesting how posting anything about these "innocent"  people instantly gets you downvotes, they must be really salty. 
---
Not really. This is pretty common logic by certain people. Like the people that defend dupping because it is on the game and thus should be fien.
---
I've also sold a great deal of junk, I've horded massive amounts of common junk on an alternate character as a "mule" for myself and friends.. any legendaries I don't need are stored on other characters.
---
There's a lot of weird reasons people do shit in this game, and it's far too easy to assume shit when you see people together and you can't quickly see why.
---
Hell, look at the guy who got banned, the 900 hour guy, look at his farming techniques, think about all the shit he does that may not make sense if you saw this guy doing very specific things.. people just assume too much.
---
Hell, I think these bans are a result of Bethesda assuming shit too. They could have looked at the number of nukacolas someone's had(dupers favorite), how many duplicate serum recipes (another thing they ruined the market with you won't have a ton of), or the *exact same* legendaries if they had 3 or more, or *something* that isn't so vague and harder to argue.
---
Outside of the hunter's long coat, and maybe some of the responder outfits what super rare outfits are in the game?  
---
never said its offensive, just sounds really stupid. you arent triggering at all
---
Idk why people still play or support this game smh.
---
I’m kinda glad they showed him why he was banned! Most people never got that at all. 
---
As far as ammo goes... I’ve had maybe a max of 1100 tops... but I only use 308 in a sniper and a shotgun. 
---
Hmm okay i haven't seen that one yet, are you able to post it? 
---
I've only seen the 100,000 one as that's what my bf was hit with 
---
Nah getting banned is the true ending.
---
Woah they’re like “we’re too lazy to fix this bug so we’re just gonna van you for now” not your fault if they’re a bug in the game and you take advantage of it. 
---
I thought one of the complaints was that they didn't tell you what you were suspended for?  
---
Yes, thoughtful...
---
Guy who cheated in a video game calls Bethesda lazy.
---
Yep she was dropping it even before they fixed her loot tables for first time. Guys i was hunting queens with had all mutation recipes. Thats why you can buy serums on reddit for 200caps each. My first was chameleon serum, around 1month after release. It was great, because i was one of first person who had it, so i sold 12serums for 12000caps. 
---
Now it is duped and like that so um whatever.
---
Everybody is innocent in Shawshank....
---
He got an e-mail for the reason he got banned. At least he was honest about that, gotta give him that !
---
What are the other mods on the mole miner gauntlet?
---
Really happy I didn’t get this game.
---
Which trashy have are you talking about?  This was my fallback after giving up on black ops 4.  I'm on a bad steak of paying full price for junk.
---
Quite a few gnomes behind the General's Steakhouse.
---
Now this is podracing
---
How about not buy the game in the first place if thats how they treat customers.
---
lol
---
To be fair the 900 hour guy made that guide after he was already banned to use as a reference in his I was unfairly banned post.  Check the time stamps.  He could be innocent though, idk,  it’s possible he legit exchanged 250,000 ultra cite ammo with his 900 hours.  I have know  idea,  but the whole I made a guide thing was very orchestrated.
---
\&gt;It feels like half of the community was banned
---
Because people who NOT banned don't screaming about it on every social media
---
I dump recipes and plans in the overseer's camp periodically. Feels good to give the new players a leg up.
---
Holy shit what is the fucking point of having that much ammo?
---
It’s actually 2*.  I fat fingered it.  Executioner. 
---
Also roof of Watoga High School.  And I think there is also one somewhere in AMS.  Watoga is thick with PA. 
---
If the accounts are connected and show trade activity they will target the mule account for participating. 
---
I see. Thanks anyway. 
---
Yeah lol I got past the intro, then got overwhelmed by everything, and I haven't opened the game since. Probably a good thing, I hear it's a massive time sink
---
What a toxic shitty post...
---
My primary gun is a single shot explosive nocturnal handmade. I've probably shot off 55k of 5.56. Most I've ever carried at one time was 3300ish.
---
Wasn't that one. I specifically avoid it. But I do use class freak. And about 9 other mutations
---
Most I carried at once was 12000 5mm rounds for a night off queen nuking. Though that much ammo is nuts
---
it's hit r/all
---
I'd be running around with a sign saying "make fallout great again"
---
He’s clearly trolling. 
---
900 hours guy just received the e-mail explaining why he got banned.
---
 Enjoy : [https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz)
---
What why
---
Between several ammo types I have well over 100k ammo, I've definitely crafted well over 100k 5mm ammo when I get low.. 15k is "oh shit, I'm almost out of ammo".
---
I use automatic weapons and heavy guns, I used single shot for the longest time until I realized how easy it is to farm lead and steel and craft gun powder, how much extra ore you get in excavator armor. Add super duper with all that, you could craft half a million ammo over the course of a week without breaking a sweat.
---
I'm not 100 percent on the parameters for detecting dupers, Bethesda said they look for high quantities of rare items added to your inventory in the last 30 days. It seems like they didn't take into account certain things like when a player accidently picks up a dupers bag without realising it's full of duped items, or farmers who can amass a lot of items. 
---
I'm lucky I didn't get the ban hammer. Just a roll back for xp farming. They also saw fit to roll back my items a few levels further back and delete ALL ammo and caps. As always, very unevenly spotted as all my buddies got away with it smh.. 
---
ill usually carry about 1.5k and have another 1.5k in storage for my TSE Handmade and TSE Combat Rifle. My sniper is usually around 350 rounds carried and 350 in storage. I can easily go days without dipping into my storage ammo. He's either a really, really bad shot or he's an insane hoarder. Probably the latter, and he probably used some not so legit methods to amass that ammo count. Can anyone calculate the weight of that many rounds?
---
I know that wasteland whisperer doesn't work on SB. Animal friend does. So... Hunters? Or possibly both. Ie deathclaws can be pacified with either perk.
---
Get weight reducing perk cards. That’s what I did. 
---
You DON'T need it. Seriously
---
Search sub reddit by best and it is literally second topic. The 900 hours post. Maybe it was just because he made an inquiry to the ban. But they list his and a mule account having over 225k ultracite ammo between the two.
---
There's a mandatory "/s" in there
---
I think it may be the rad worms glitch
---
Are you sure it was for an armor piece and not the helmet?
---
The codes on nuka crypt are right I used them for silo b and c
---
No, I don’t do any invites or anything, just pull up their profile and select “join game” on the person you are using to hitch back into the server. It *is* risky, but if it makes you feel any better I’ve done it literally a hundred times now and have never lost any items. You just have to be careful.
---
Why don't you just ask the developers to stop working on the game entirely, shut down the servers, and ban us all, that way we can all go back to doing something productive rather than wasting our time on a shell of a game that will never be what 90% of us expected it could be?  
---
I hate to be such a pessimist... I've spent over 200 hours playing this game and 150 of those hours was grinding for absolutely not reason other than I wanted to feel like I got my money's worth out of this steaming pile of shit.  Now you're going around handing out bans that just don't make any sense at all.  Did the developers not realize that they built this game around a grind and that it's totally feasible 4 months after launch (all while having absolutely ZERO additional content added) that some people might have found legitimate ways of farming these so called "rare" items?  
---
Every day these guys shoot themselves in the foot to the point that their feet should be non-existent.  It's a joke, and it's gone on long enough.  It's time to end it.  Tell the team to just go home and shut the servers off.  It's over.  It failed.  It was an interesting idea but it's time to admit you just didn't know how the hell to accomplish what you set out to do.
---
It actually makes my day when I find something useful at a train station. 
---
If they devoted nothing but making that ammo maybe. But you don't need 10% of that amount.
---
Is that for Feb 18th or the next week? Not sure when the codes update. Also, thanks.

Good guide I'm using.  Watch your chems too!
---
Because mobile versions of sites suck some times. That is why link didn't work. I have had the same issue.
---
I am prepared to claim that literally everyone who purchased the game is a victim, long before I would ever assume Bethesda is doing the right thing.
---
I can feel the salt in those downvotes ! LOVE IT!
---
Yeah or why anyone does it.  Just playing the game seems better then watching you tube videos of how to have 50,000 nuke cola quantums then spending your afternoon doing that.
---
100k items in 30 days. Now what if there is some error in the detection code? What if you craft 30k, drop them, pick them back up, drop them pick them back up? Etc.? Does it account for that? I wouldn't trust it to.
---
One of the promises for what this game was sold on is that you'd never see a server when playing, and that they would not limit players allowing them to enjoy it as a solo game. Banning people from cheating is something directly related to seeing servers and something you should beable to do in a solo game.  
---
Decent advice no matter if you inherently believe or disbelieve the player. Post history will often paint a very clear picture of how much you should believe them.
---
It's incredibly unlikely that a ban wave will have no false positives... about as unlikely as a ban being a false positive in the first place. I'm sure there's at least a few legit players who were hit by this ban, but there's no way every post claiming that is true. 
---
lol.
---
By the time I get through the launch area to enter the codes I'm afraid itll be the next week not sure what time zone the site runs on.
---
Uh this is every online game that has ever been released. Actually Bethesda is actually saying they will unban the accounts after a future update, other games bans are permanent with zero chance of getting account back so they are treating cheaters better than most.
---
Was this prior to the latest patch? I think they have dropped off the vendors lists after the patch and seem to be rare now.
---
Also, I need them!
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Lol they actually get people to play this Alpha Early Access game and then ban them for bugs...
---
Oh look another one of these threads. 
---
If my stash is full and I give my wife some items to hang onto until I've lowered my stash limit be an exploit? If so, why? If not, how is it any different? Still spending our money to circumvent the stash limit. A stash limit that is only in place for technical reasons and not for gameplay balance I might add.

THANK YOU!
---
They used to be farmed,.   This change happened a few months after they began trying to fix the trap disarm/xp glitch
---
I’d admit if I found stuff and hell, even sell it! That’s what you do in the wasteland, either use it or sell it... but I haven’t been that lucky yet. 
---
I like to know how they define “rare”. Even still 100,000 of all stuff over 30 days and only playing a few hours a week (maybe 4-5 tops) there’s no way to do that just picking up scrap. 
---
The letter is generic and everyone got the same deal so hopefully they’ll respond to the ticket however I’m seeing that banned accounts are low priority so it might be a long time!
---
Yes sorry this was prior to patch. Now I think only forbidden knowledge quest gives you BoS plans. 
---
I got the shielded underarmor and initiate paint from that recently. 
---
&gt;  But in this instance, there seems to be a somewhat organized group actively spreading misinformation and discontent.
---
Conspiracy theorist nonsense. No need to defend Bethesda's bullshit practices in this manner. A friend of mine got his account temp banned. He never had anywhere near 100k items. He never duped. He also never hunted dupers to take their items. All that happened to him that could have caused this was the C.A.M.P. bug that gave him lots of corn everytime he logged on.
---
I want Fo76 to succeed. But writing off the mistakes Bethesda is making, especially stuff like this where they ban people who have not done anything wrong, as "trolls" and "liars", wil just kill this game off more than it already is.
---
I can see why they would use ultracite as one of the items flagged as it's extremely hard to have in large quantities. I know there are some people who can amass those amounts without using exploits, how ever I would wager those people are quite rare compared to the majority of people who actually duped them. The ban wave was a short term solution and they will look at all banned players to determine whether a claim is geuninky or not. For the time being it does suck he was banned, but if 1000 actual dupers were also banned as douchy as it sounds, it's acceptable losses in the shitstorm of duping. I just hope that anyone unfairly banned by Bethesda is given something as a way of apologising.
---
Gonna delete after I launch my nuke sir, appreciate the help glad i waited.
---
I have been doing forbidden knowledge every chance I get and still no luck. I'll try again tonight.
---
No prob if thier not ready it will say unsolved under the silo name
---
Yep it’s RNG. Luck will get you across the line. 
---
No, that was nerfed.
---
This level of backlash is going to teach Bethesda are hard lesson. Multiplayer and Fallout are a bad mix. 
---
I see thanks again, like I said last time I did this wasted both my friends time and myself. We entered last weeks codes. 
---
Also true. Though looking at things. Due to dupers, at one point .308 ammo was 500 for 5 caps according to the one person on discord. So the cost of a couple fast travels and a moved camp and you have 1-3k .308 bought before even accounting for personal stash/crafted.
---
But yeah I don't viably see why someone got that much. How is questionable, entirely due to the why not being there.
---
Mind you if stashes were cross characters....yeah I would happily see it being legit. Putting time into never needing to grind again would make sense
---
DEAR BETHESDA IF HE IS A DUPER AND SUBMITS A TICKET PLEASE INCREASE PUNISHMENT TO IP BAN XX

That isn’t true. My brother hasn’t played since Christmas. He never duped. I know this to be 100% fact. Because him and his wife separated for about a month and a half. He stayed with me while they where Separated. He used a hard copy of Fallout 76 that belong to my GF. The only time he played FO76 was the time he stayed at my house. He got back together with his wife at Christmas. So he moved back in. He didn’t own or Fallout 76 or an Xbox.
---
He did have a mule who had a lot of steel cement and Stimpacks on the mule. He farmed the still and crafted the Stimpacks.
---
So yes why I believe 75-85% people Suspended was guilty of something. I just happen to know he was innocent.
---
Hello Chris, I’m contacting about a review copy of Anthem. I’m a disabled small time twitch streamer with around 1000 of followers. I also write reviews for games. I have already purchased Anthem and EA access. I was looking for a review code on Xbox One version of Anthem so I can finish writing a review.
---
I also want to build a community on Xbox for Anthem. I believe Anthem has the Potential to be a huge game with longevity.
---
I’m also wanting to build a relationship with EA and BioWare. I have loved all your guys games. I even love Mass Effect Andromeda and I’m said we will not be seeing DLC or Expansions for that game.
---
I will edit pic of his suspension notice in a min.
---
I mean I probably crafted 100,000+ 5.56 rounds. Good thing it’s been over a few months.
---
100,000 bullets in a month is a different story than Aid/junk/gear. 100,000 bullets is doable in a month.
---
Though this picture looks guilty as fuck. 
---
Sounds like you don’t have a clue what you are talking about 
---
Exactly and as I said in another post, as shitty as it sounds but if you were banned unfairly, there are far more people who deserved it and their absence will make the game a better place.
---
If you are one of the few who didn't deserve it, don't stop messaging Bethesda support until you receive answers.
---
Fair enough. But there's much more than 100.000 in a month. I calculated aprox. 640.000 bullets, a lot being ultracite which is a big harder to come by
---
/r/foundsatan
---
&gt;They can ban you at any time for any reason and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
" They can ban you at any time for any reason and there is nothing you can do about it. " This implies they can ban for any reason even on a whim you claim to have read the TOS if they do say this it surpasses bad business.
---
Surprise surprise. The one post that actually seemed remotely credible turned out to be using exploits.
---
Good riddance 900-hour guy.
---
I was banned also even though I don’t play the game... I am lvl 5 and played for 1 day. Probs 6 hours of gameplay. I don’t have internet now so can’t play. But yet I was banned and haven’t played since the game was released . Makes me now want to buy any game from them again...
---
Well, it’s happening again right now (first one I didn’t even get there fast enough to tag her). Soooo...  maybe it doesn’t require any cheating? :P
---
It sucks that you were banned, but I can’t say I’m surprised. 
---
Why would a company like Bethesda, with a hunger for money matching that of EA and mobile game companies, waste resources on a team to fix their incredibly broken “game” when they can just put in cheap monitors that detect if someone is “cheating” and call it fixed?
---
Their interest isn’t in the player, it’s in the dollar. 
---
Hey do you still have that’s bos pain plan for me I still want it?
---
This guy gets it
---
or... what if these 'victims' are liars? That makes more sense right? During the last ban wave? and wave before that? Dupers cried their innocence but it turns out they were lying. Same thing is happening now and you still believe these people?
---
Also at the top they put the dates thier good for.
---
not my post history.
---
He actually created that guide after her got the error message,  even worse.  He was unable to play the game and then went and created his guide.  Right after that he used said guide to prove innocence.
---
That being said,  if he was using a mule and playing 10 hours a day 7 days a week it’s possible he just moved that much ammo around back and forth and that’s how it was flagged.  Seems insane but so does playing 40% of the time since the game was released,  home injured or not.  Either way the guide thing was a cheap trick.
---
It's surprising that people think that people won't bother looking back into their history
---
Was it like a specific 30 days? I'm curious because I know for a certain fact I did that exact thing and had way over 100,000 items at once but I didn't get banned. 
---
I know a girl that had nothing and got banned for barely playing 5 hours over the last 30 days. Or a kid who barely knew what it did, never had a mule and probably max 50k items if you combine ammo + junk + caps + all the rest. A lot of causals were banned, as well as most players with 800+ hours.I bet they duped their playtime ! 
---
     
---
But yeah of course Mr. /u/Moredius knows better and is glad they banned all those horrific exploiters.       
---
        
---
I hope you get banned too :)
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** Fractal_one! ^(hug)
---
I believe that it is possible that the way it detects these high numbers could be flawed.
---
The perk card system works but it doesn’t work _well_. I expect the devs find the same frustrating elements as we do, they just have more pressing problems to solve before they refine things like this. I expect we will one day be able to save perk cards in sets (one set for crafting ammo, one for repairing PA, one for heading out to The Whitespring, etc) and also to be able to store duplicate cards or cards we don’t use in a location that removes the chore of scrolling through that mess every time we want to make a change. 
---
I have put over 1000 hours into Fallouts 3, New Vegas, and 4. I always wished I could play those with friends. 76 sounded perfect to me.
---
anthem is only $15??????? 
---
Some of us are just paying it forward. We're all from the same vault after all :)
---
Yeah, that's how I got burned last time. Wrote down the codes ran through the area... Then entered wrong codes because of updated codes to the following week when I finally got through said area.
---
Even worse, i thought he made the post before the message. Now it's all OBVIOUS and any sane person would realize it's just smoke
---

---
You are doing great work. A true Raider!
---
You have to swap perk cards a lot for crafting but it's doable.
---
Some people can dish it out but can't hack it when it's dished back to them. Such snowflakes :)
---
How is this so highly upvoted? It's a "your mom" joke. Am I missing something?
---
Okay so you have around 400k ultracite ammo. Let's assume you need 1 flux to craft around 100 ammo. You'll need 4k fluxes to craft that much. How tf do you come up with 4k fluxes? on top of that you'll need tens of thousands of steal and lead. Get lost
---
You have posts about tons of legendary armor for sale lol I'm glad you're banned bub 
---
So, not so innocent then?
---
And it is very much possible that these people are lying.
---
The change Monday at 7 PM eastern time no matter where you are located. Like for me it's at 6 PM when they change
---
That and players on this sub reddit have been declaring anything and everything against Bethesda as true. 
---
Remember when people were declaring then game was going f2p because of one person talking to a friend in one gamestop in Australia. 
---
Why not? Aprox. 650.000 bullets (ultracite included) is doable in one month if you skip sleeping and bathroom breaks.
---
This needs more attention. Another lying bastard revealed
---
Yeah he himself said he made the guide after he got the first error message because he finally had time to since he couldn’t play.
---
As did I, friend.
---
Did you even read what the guy wrote or did you just take the e-mail he got at face value?
---
:)
---
That and you have more time to troll reddit if you've been banned.
---
Well now it makes more sense.There's no doubt anymore.
---
What lesson? he had like 400k ultracite ammo! He's an exploiter and deserves a ban
---
I hate to assume but I don't think they are going to release any new content until they get rid of most of the major bug issues.  
---
Can't you just delete your PS+ account? Then resign up with a different email and play the game again?
---
Muwahwah Ive gone and pulled a David Blaine havent I 
---
Seems like a waste of time. 
---
With how lackluster this game is compared to the others, I can see why Bethesda thinks that nobody will legitimately play that much. 
---
It is probable that a number of them are not. And they are innocent until proven guilty.
---
If you are able to "cheat" in a game without 3rd party software or changing game files. This is not cheating.. this is bad software development.. v
---
I played for about 20hrs before uninstalling it and going back to factorio. It had its moments of fun, but was far too buggy for me to waste time on when I need more iron
---
Lmao okay. Any specific posts? I invested over 800 hours in trading and got some stuff... and? I bought junk, fluxes, ammo &amp; other stuff. Would a duper do that? Also have fun wasting your time trying to figure out which weapons I sold 'millions of times'. I never had a weapon twice.      
---
Thanks for your baseless accussions tho, I bet you're a wonderful guy to play to with... please let me know when you got banned too :)
---
Sure as hell not.In the GW2 subreddit the devs will answer any claims of an unfair ban with evidence in post no chance of bad PR or false positives there Bethesda on the other hand just seems to not give a shit as they dont address anything.
---
yeah, except in the email you receive is says  **"This decision is final, and no farther appeals will be considered in this matter"** 
---
and you account cant access support on the website when you are banned.
---
Yeah bro. I'd imagine the unlocking chance is low because it took a while to unlock anything
---
A chargeback is a great idea. If you bought it directly from Bethesda. They start getting a lot of chargebacks and they can lose their merchant account. 
---
Someone said that items don't have an ID like that, which would be true for certain items at least, otherwise they could just check for unique item ID where players had 3+ of that item, say for 2 or 3 * legendaries. If they could track those, they wouldn't be banning based on sheer number of basic junk items. That also reasonably says they can't track those kind of items between players, meaning you can't get in trouble for getting an item that was duped, only getting an absurd number of items.
---
They could have chosen to use nukacolas or serum recipes or something else that's commonly duped and been far less likely to catch innocent players in their net. Much harder to argue you've never had thousands of nukacolas it dozens of serum recipes, items you just can't naturally come into that quantity of.
---
Seriously what is funny about this? I'm with you dude. 
---
Same, I spent like 20 minutes in online trying to figure out how to do private servers, found out *you can't set a private game* and just noped the fuck out because it's somehow even worse than gtav with griefers and assholes
---
Good man
---
 **"This decision is final, and no farther appeals will be considered in this matter"**  pisses me off the most
---
What is the actual definition of a "Rare Item"?!? If Legendaries are considered a "Rare Item", then how would anyone be able to play the game with over 100,000 Legendaries in their inventory?!? All of these so called "bans" were not all mule accounts! Many were main accounts that players used to play this broken beta... I mean game. There is NO WAY I could possibly play with any item over 100k in my inventory, much less Legendary Weapons/Armor. Players are really taking Bugthesda's side on this...SMH?!? No matter how many broken, bug filled, so called patch/hotfix's that they have released. That Alone... more than serves as proof that these clowns have no clue what they are doing...lol. How many more broken, glitch filled, so called updates do you need to be released before your clouded mind is changed?!? 
---
They were proven guilty. That's why they are banned
---
What if my gremlins escaped and got wet, but I didn't dampen them intentionally. Will I get banned for having these 5,000 gremlins? Also, send help. 
---
*"Everybody lies."*
---
*- Gregory House, M.D.*
---
Maybe. It's unclear how Bethesda has arrived at the 100k+ item total, because they've made it clear they're not looking at total held at one time, just total acquired over 30 days. How are they tracking acquisition? Are they counting player trades? Container pickups? Does the total go up each time a player transfers the same items from one account to/from a mule account?
---
Depending on the answers to those questions it's very possible that high volume players would get hit by false positives. Someone who's logged 900+ hours on the game would be a prime candidate for that. Not saying it's certain, just saying if there were anyone to be likely to be a false positive it would be someone who plays the game that much.
---
You do remember that at least one person in that story was actually innocent, right?
---
If you feel that negatively about them, why are you still here?
---
The answer is he's full of shit.
---
I feel like the majority of the negative comments aren't actually reading anything he says and just takes the e-mail he got at face value. He even says he never had that much, but speculates on ways they could have been counted. 
---
I have been permanently banned
---
all i can say is they are getting things wrong, over and over and over. they arent listening to the casual RP players or the streamers or the meta endgamers, they arent listening to the people that love this game, every move they are making is wrong. i dont know how to fix it, but it seems like they should have a community team that works for them and a 2nd team that is made up of US, the players on the pulse of the game, that communicate with each other and the rest of the community pillars like our best posters here, our twitch people, our podcasters. The 900 hours guy made one of the best posts ever and is in the same boat with a wrongful suspension. they are really really messing up by not having a consult team made up of US the regular players who care a lot and spend time both playing and interacting in forum and twitch and podcasts.
---
so you think all bans are accurate?
---
I think you are elaborately full of shit.
---
So if my buddy gives me shit to hold on a mule for him I’m the bad guy? 
---
Sometimes you want to respec a bit and might want level 2 of something instead of 3 so you can use level 4 or 5 of something else. 
---
So do Death Tambos.  Both benefit from the Gladiator perks.  I'm fairly certain the Deathclaw Gauntlet does as well, never tried the knuckles or boxing glove.  Meat Hooks are the best of them; none can be used in PA.
---
Hello everyone i realized that it should be 1366x720 borderless BUT its still not fullscreen though but at least it isnt a stop dance anymore when I go to flatwoods
---
Nah man. If you buy a second copy of the game you are entitled to every bit of functionality from that copy as you are from the original. There are limits on characters, not players. There's nothing unintended about it.
---
You'd better hope the judge isn't so quick to condemn you.
---

Well shyyyt..... i just picked up a lot of stuff within the last 24 hrs farming whitesprings over and over and over again in my own private server that ive been on for more than 24 hrs now, and im still here over encumbered with legendaries and still the only one in the map. 
---
You're half right because it was 1366  but half wrong because its 720 :/ 
---
only keeps honest people away...
---
Knowing Bethesda that won’t be for a while thanks for the help
---
Me too, I just played the game and did not dupe anything.
---
LOLZ 👌🏻😩😩😩💀💀😩💦👌🏻👌🏻💯💯💯
---
I grind my ass off about 3 or 4 hours a day to make ammo and I can maybe, MAYBE get 5 or 6 k a week after hoarding lead and steel and gunpowder. And that's usually 45 and 308 ammo combined. 600k? No fucking way. 
---
Once again yes, that is exactly what it means not sure what is so hard to understand. It is the same thing in any other online game do some research.
---
This, but they should let us choose how many stars to use if we have the perks.  Kind of like the lockpick/hacker perks.  It's kind of a pain in the ass but I had to take 1 star 'first aid' to make room for something when I already had 3 star.  Let us unstack the cards.
---
we dont need to know you, this is fallout, fallout means family. most of the people here probably aren't even from vault 13, thats ok with me, i am from there, i was born in that dimension and became a traveler to all these other dimensions and 2019 the madness that is now, before the nuclear revolution
---
I hope it gets patched so people like you struggle.
---
Even everyone's trusted "900 hour guy" basically admitted to having about 360 thousand rounds of ultracite ammo and being like, "oh no, but I crafted that all legitimately". Give me a break.
---
I can understand the twitch, but the bottom two distract from the issue. 
---
Nice reference sir. Very obscure of you 
---
Dabbing on them noobs
---
I’m at 290 without pa, 390 with x01 shocks, 490 with ex armor, 590 if I log in with ex armor on lol. I kinda like wearing my ex armor more often because of less dr. Keeps things challenging plus all the extra carry weight. 
---
What story does it tell, if you don't mind me asking?
---
You know that 900 hour guy? Turns out he had more than 400k ultracite ammo and was indeed exploiting. Bethesda does not fuk around.
---
Hahaha! I've heard that one a thousand times.
---
They didn’t just ban dupers. There is some innocent people who got banned also. Then people who horde items in mass quaintly also got banned.
---
I do believe about 80% of people who where banned was done Justly. I do believe about 20% of people where innocent. 
---
Most of your posts look suspicion, trading lots of good legendaries and rare outfits. You even made a post asking if  any other players lost stacks of duped items. You could very well be a farmer and earned them legit, but judging from your history and your open hostility to me I'm going to wager you did something wrong and got banned deservingly.
---
Bunch of Bazaar and Market posts, like the others you more than likely knowingly, maybe but less likely unknowingly, were involved in some shady shit.
---
My brother got banned and I know 100% he wasn’t a duper. Here the link to the story.
---

Please tell me thats sarcasm 
---
Can you even make another account on Xbox or am I totally f’ed
---
I think Death Claws and Mole Miner Gauntlets got patched/nerfed and no longer benefit from both Gladiator and Iron Fist. I'm with you on the meat hook though! I'm looking for a bloodied 3* hook right now.
---
Ive never heard of this, so have an upvote. Can anyone else confirm? Ill be trying this out tomorrow!
---
Apex legends is pretty good
---
Not sure how they selected, I craft a ton of stuff and I wasn't banned either. Curious to know what the actual algorithm was or if they just played Russian roulette with it.
---
Yes and you have probably crafted under 100 so far.  If you are crafting 100,000 items its because you were duping resources.  
---
Not sure myself but some say that premade object eat into your budget and that camping near water gives more budget. Just something to note.
---
The ban had nothing to do with op players. You can make a broken build without exploiting the game. 
---
I absolutely love Bethesda games. I've played them all. But holy shit are they riddled with bugs. He's right. They can't get their engine to not completely crap it's pants, who is to say their cheat detection thingy is any better?
---
Over 200 hours you played this game you think is a steaming pile of shit.
---
&gt;  i own duped items like most people  
---
Funny how you just assume that most people have duped items.  You speak about duping as though it were the norm  and talk about having mule characters (which is very common among dupers).
---
You are saying that you don't dupe while admitting to doing things that dupers do. 
---
Same, except the guy shot at me and used the taunt emote first.
---
Thx for updating!
---
For most of that ammo, I feel like there could be possible explanations.  But a quarter million \*ultracite\* ammo?  I don't see how that'd be possible.
---
If you have a lot of something then it is easy to get so you don’t need to stockpile it!
---
The increased stash to 800 will help you transiently but unless you stop hoarding you will soon be full again.
---
Well, I used original textures from the game archives for the Quantum skin, actually. (At least for the older version which is now in the optional section. Still, even the revamped one is based on the other set of original textures)
---
Save those atoms, and some day maybe...
---
Anyone innocent, but banned, now suffers the undeserved second penalty caused by the dupers: no one believes them.  
---
I’ve seen him once in over 400 hours of game time on 3 different characters. Of course the one time I found him I was only level 14, and he’s programmed to run away if you’re that far below his level. Haven’t seen him since.
---
Yeah, I heard about the water camp. Idk. Doesn't feel realistic , especially like the floating camps.
---
where did they say they had no way of identifying duped items? 
---
Dick poster down vote lol 😊
---
1. Really only there to co-op
---
2. Favoritism at the cost of others.
---
3. White Knight to the extreme.
---
Are you for real? If so, this would be hilarious.
---
Does it really turn out that way? Do you just accept whatever you are told? The whole thing could be a slick maneuver by them to discredit the real false positives. Or maybe the guy crafted 30k and transferred them back and forth between accounts and it added them up every time to come to those numbers. All you know is what you see, and you make a judgement based on no actual evidence. So again. You'd better hope your judge isn't so quick to condemn with such flimsy evidence as you are.

Jehova's witness.

Second time this year I agree with Aggie!

It's a slap on the wrist. Only "suspended" until the patch cleans out the ill-gotten loot.
---
And you get to keep the god-tier weapons and armor.
---
Yes, I read every word he said. It sounds like an elaborate web of horse shit.

Nope standing right behind the counter where you pick the dross up. I always got 3 tokens up until the last two times where I got none.

Uh... it's definitely not dead

Keep in mind, this guy has admitted to duping
---
I think he did indeed cheat. He just deleted his thread with about 10k upvotes lul
---
One sbq fight if you’re heavy. Doing a sbq and silo you can use 5000 or more 50cal; why I switched to a Gatling gun lol
---
I saw him about ten or fifteen hours in. Tried to kill him but he vanished. Cute little thing 
---
Of course! Bugthesda's track record is more than enough proof that they are infallible. (Lol, sorry! But I've about had it with this BS)
---
I like the idea of item specific stash at camps.
---
Yes. Because nobody will believe them. It’s an uphill battle. I honestly believe there is a system that auto Flags people with to much inventory and then they get banned if it’s not in the realm Bethesda feels is fair or deems reasonable.
---
Reddit can advise great! Remember the time they got the Boston bomber??
---
Yep. I’ve been toying with a bloodied build, trying to get all the perks I was missing (lvl 235 is a poor time to respec...  for the 3rd time) 
---
Even with rads at only 50% and bouncing between low health and there, I can usually do close to pre-nerf damage with a BE handmade.
---
The guys that run melee can get stupid high damage stats because melee weapons are buffed by the Strength stat, and a full set of Unyielding grants a buff of 15. They’ll also use buffout, alcohol, bobbles, etc to further increase that stat and continue increasing damage. This paired with a bloodied melee weapon, “Radicool”, and “Incisor” can do a lot of damage while ignoring 75%+ of the target’s armor. 
---
OP you are literally part of the problem, and the exact useful idiot that Bethesda has specifically counted on.
---
*Dying*, is that better? They’ve driven away a good chunk of folks who at one point were ride or die for this shit, despite all of the hate.
---
Huh lmao
---
So you've issues with players being overpowered with the right build now? Get your head out of your ass. Just because you can't build right don't come on reddit crying.
---
Maybe it's a secret Challenge which isn't published, get Banned 1/1 for 10 Atoms?
---
The guy had over 360k ultracite ammo, which is rarer than 308 and has to be crafted.
---
Well, there it is guys. He farms 10k karma and just deletes his thread. Good job guys well done. I'm very proud of you
---
Since the last patch plans for dense mods for armor are gone from vendors, I believe bos combat armorvmod plans are also gone. Traper dense used to be at harpers ferry and for some reason is not on the list now.
---
Even if you played 12 hours a day every day for a month and crafted ammo non stop, then maybe youd get up there but ultracite doesnt drop from enemies and is not easy to craft. I agree just no way. 
---
reading your post history, you either duped, or you aided a duper.
---
fair, next. 
---
I, too would love to know exactly how many players were banned today! 
---
I actually just tested this myself and only the meathook benefited. I expect it to be patched eventually
---
I'm confused, who's image is that?
---
"Quit telling me what to do and do what *I* say, [insert parental unit-level insult here]!" 
---
It's a good thing Red duped that two shot explosive rock hammer for Andy. Otherwise he'd still be in prison. Get busy living or get busy duping.
---
I don't have the mental capacity to play a minute max build. Too many things to worry about. I tend to stay away from the damage dealing perks 
---
I have and it has not been successful for me yet
---
Because to get that much ultracite ammo you had to be exploiting the game. He had over 360 thousand.
---
Once you level to 50 or even 70 (to level up perk cards) someone being 200 levels above you doesn’t matter. Unless he happens to have better gear. 
---
I really don't care about any individual case you think you know anything about. There are people caught up in this that shouldn't be, and the whole game from the start has been a shitshow. Now crafting too much ammo is a crime. Well whatever.
---
Senior is 8-10 years...
---
Did you ever asked yourself why I had to ask others if they lost stacks? May because... I had none? I wondered if Bethesda really deleted items shortly after patch was live.      
---
       
---
Yea trading is absolutely a justification for bans. And you totally must be right about all those assumption because well, it's YOU who assume it.      
---
      
---
I'm not even hostile but your whole argumentation is as loose as your background check.
---
360k ultracite ammo in a period of 30 days? That is crazy... maybe if he spent his entire time playing only making ammo and apparently never using it.
---
&gt;So everyone saying “I got suspended for no reason” are liars.
---
Agree with this.  A classic example is [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as67d0/my_suspension_just_wanna_talk_about_mine_and/) where the guy actually says "like most people I own duped items."   That is a statement  suggesting the duping is just normal and acceptable. And he talks about having a mule character (common practice among dupers).
---
So he's proclaiming innocence while at the same time admitting that he knowingly purchased duped items and admits to doing something that is common among dupers.  Which doesn't exactly sound innocent. 
---
If you’re innocent then there is no reason to be mad, talk it out peacefully because if you’re so enraged you’ll look guilty. If they’re wrong they’ll notice later and compensate. People know that cheaters react loudly on the social platform when banned or found out and everyone will notice. 
---
This! ^^
---
Uh...  over 100k UC ammo in a 30 day period?  And with equally large amounts on an associated account?  Sounds fair. This person was probably warned in the past as well. 
---
&gt;since Bethesda themselves said they have no real way to track what items are duped and what isnt.
---
#where did they say this
---
Or you are just salty that you got banned.
---
The approximation is bullshit but I don't doubt that with the right techniques and perk combinations and caps etc you could build buy and find hundreds of thousands of bullets over a month of gameplay.
---
360 thousand rounds of ultracite ammo?
---
Again, still not what I am interested in. Mods like that only reflect for me, no one else. That may interest others, but not for me in this context.
---
Dude why you here though 
---
Dude.  Dupers are duping dupes during dupapalooza.  You help yourself to their duped wares.  You think "It's okay because I'm a vigilante rofl".  You get suspended along with them.  Think about this for a while.
---
I just started and it's awesome.  Do you really think hundreds of people a day aren't buying it? It's dead cause you said so?
---
Nah...ban those fucks
---
They really dont. 
---
I always try to look for locations that have enough water nearby for a large purifier, some kind of resource I need nearby and some area to loot close to camp. It doesn't hurt to center yourself between places you visit often to save on travel costs. You could look at the interactive map to find a place where you can set up an extractor at your camp if you like the idea of mining resources while you play without having to defend a workshop.
---
What? Go for a game that’s not out yet? 
---
There's a dece+ house southwest of the nukacola plant. Ya can find a roach on the toilet wearing a hat and wedding ring inside. You can build inside and it's fully furnished
---
You get the full game if you subscribe to origin access premier, a monthly subscription of $15, easily cancelled 
---
yeah, pre order that good game
---
Stfu you are worse then the dupers. 
---
I think it counts them all together. So it wouldn't even need to be just 100k of one type, but could be split between different calibres.
---
I see, more witch hunting, less blaming Bethesda for releasing a shitty product that allowed this to happen in the first place. Nice subreddit.
---
Yeah whatever. I don't care about those 'innocent' cases either
---
Found a trapper deep pockets chest mod plan today randomly inside a locked safe.  I think stuff is still dropping, at least in the random reward loot tables.
---
&gt;...Bethesda will absolutely not stop shooting themselves in the feet and, by extension of that, Fallout 76.
---
All I’m really saying.
---
Interesting idea, as it would still require us to collect the cards.   It would still be rng based on what you get just prevent the duplicates when you get a max amount number.   There are 507 ranks of all cards at max.  The way they give card packs you need to get to lvl 615 to accumulate all the cards if no duplicates are given.   I don’t see how your idea would damage the devs plan for how cards are used or given.    I would rather not have two travel agent or woodchucks cards in my deck.   
---
Good idea. 
---
50 atoms should do it
---
Yeah because 7600 hours is also worth 10 atoms!
---
Were people calling in about problems with Fallout 3? I feel so out of the loop rn
---
Good to hear. I’m level 40 (not sure how many hours... probably 80ish, just guessing) but have done a TON of scrapping. I’ve completed razed and rebuilt my camp several times, and is the same 2 or 3 weapons that need constant repairs... so most of my map exploring has been purely looking for junk to scrap.
---
I’ve never duped anything or traded with another player, so unless I picked up  a duped item left in a container - I’m legitimately safe. But the more posts I’ve read throughout today, the more I’ve been scared to login and find myself banned from pure volume of scrapping. So relieved to here that it’s not been an issue for you!
---
So it's not possible using Ammosmith and Super Duper perks???
---
I thought Bethesda was against the use of mules as well since it’s somewhat of an exploit to increase stash space. Not like they’re actually playing the mule character, just using them for storage. 
---
You must have gotten lucky last 8 queens I have seen only 3 died before the timer, of the 3 that died was only able to loot one....the other two just spinning loading wheel till she despawned, wasted stims ammo and repairs.
---
Nah dude, they should atleast give them them a canvas bag for their trouble
---
I trust nobody
---
I put in all the plans I can't sell on the discord in the suitcase in watoga station.
---
Not just the ultracite plans (useless), but the CAMP and weapon plans too.
---
Also bulked scrap if I'm overencumbered but I've exhausted the vendors for the day.
---
I hope not. I had 4bajillion aluminum one day, but it didn't change my weight. So I said "lol no." And logged out after taking a ss. It was fixed when I logged back in. Hopefully I don't get flagged because these clowns can't fix their game
---
Your mom jokes are funny when they're directed at douchebags.
---
I got downvoted to hell for calling him out too 
---
Nobody is legitimately wasting the time to pump out 100 thousand rounds of ammo. You'd spend your entire time making ammo and nothing else.
---
Easy to say when it doesn't happen to you.
---
Those mutations though
---
NO. NO HORNS BETH, HEAR ME? NO HORNS NOT ON PAVEMENT NOTHING. GAME BREAKING. 
---
Thank you. Good to know they are still around as loot. Hopefully they will show up on vendors again too.
---
Good game...hasn’t been released yet...good to see the circlejerk in full force still
---
Did you never call The VaultTec number? Where it was like “thank your for calling VaultTec, your call is very important to us. Please wait for the next available Handy, your estimated wait time is 5,784,657 minuets and 46 seconds” it was just a funny thing they did 
---
I dunno, millions of people disagree with our president, but they haven't stormed the white house or fled the country. 
---
Of course I am but yeah just want to warn others because it seems they ban all who use a 50cal or minigun as main weapon and played at least a few hours each day. Just because of their ammo consumption.
---
What's the point? Somebody had 100k ammo. Big deal. I bet people are making money from this in some way. Maybe driving people to play Anthem or something. Maybe they have shares in EA.
---
They need to stop people from cheesing the fight.
---
No SBQ outside of the nuke zone. It's insanely annoying to spend 30 caps to fast travel to the event only to have it over in 3 minutes.
---
Craftable radium rifles aren't rare.
---
I got 10k-20k of several ammo. You have to have obsene amounts and doing something strange, to worry about getting banned.
---
Why are people doing this again? Just a moment ago everyone was so hysterical about losing majority of their items because they were convinced they were duped.
---
Both of which are much harder to do than simply *not* posting on the forum for a game you obviously hate.
---
Bethesda fkd up. They released a buggy and unplayable game, with many exploits. Their merchandise is a true overprized scam. I wouldn't wonder if they fkd up again. It's very likely. 
---
woah you used the 3 dots twice, high IQ, but original creators of fallout and no doubts like when we found out fallout 76 had multiplayer too, theres good reason to have hope for this game.
---
Yep.  That's exactly what they are doing. I don't know if its a TOS violation by itself.  But it pretty much goes had in hand with duping.  People have a mule because they have way more stuff than they can store in their stash. Why so much stuff? Because they are duping the hell out of it and selling it on ebay? Very often that is the case. 
---
I found 5000 steel in a filing cabinet at the White Springs train station. Was it duped? Probably, but I split it with my friends and we made a shit load of ammo. It was pretty awesome honestly.
---
That being said my main gripe. My main and only gripe. The SBQ. We legit tried to take her down so many fucking times and her health would not deplete. We couldn't bring her down even at level 100+. Now all of my friends have stopped playing which sucks hard because I actually made NEW friends playing this game which is something I NEVER do in other games. Now I sit in our discord channel and listen to them play Battlefield V which I have no interest in playing.
---
I WANT to play this game, but it's chased off any reason for me to do so. I log in now to farm my personal steel stash of commie robots because of where my CAMP is at then log off. Used to spend hours playing. Now? I am just waiting and hoping that change comes and I can get my friends to play again. Fucking sucks.
---
225k Ultracite ammo, totally not a duper
---
Think about it. What kind of people are downvoting  this post? This post filled with truth about ammo usage?
---
This subreddit is infiltrated by paid PR/Marketing shills. And I'm pretty sure it's illegal.
---
This constitutes false and misleading marketing practices. They are attempting to silence criticism from paying customers, and present the image that everything is fine, to deceive others into buying this broken mess of a game. They manipulate the voting system and make posts that seem like they are just regular players. This is against consumer protection regulations in many countries. I feel like I have to post this to make people aware of what is happening here. Just so you know.
---
Git out of heer S.t.a.l.k.e.r.!
---
Cheeky Breeky!
---
if you decide to use a 50cal or minigun aa main weapon they'll ban you too just for their ammo consumption. 3.4k rounds per day is not much for those weapons...
---
OP is a whiny bitch.  
---
I read some of your comments on other posts and it sounds like you are crafting them *and using them*. This guy had 360 thousand rounds of ultracite ammo sitting *unused* in his inventories. Even in the unlikely case that someone is crafting 100 thousand ammo over the course of the month, they are actually using it. It's not just sitting there in a pile of 200-300 thousand. Can you imagine crafting that much of an ammo you actually use and some how stock piling 300 thousand of it? You'd have to spend your entire play time every day farming ammo materials.
---
I recommend heading NW from the vault toward the fairgrounds/dirt track. 
---
You get an easy workshop, tons of nearby scorched in the faire, Legendary Items event called Leader of the Pack for easy level 10/15 legendaries early, and the route can include swinging by the Mothman shrine/,useum for tons of mothman eggs which are easy cooking for good xp and sellable for best early caps.
---
*this is one of the many reasons people think we're all kids*
---
I friended an extreme min/max guy and tag along with his fights. I’ll use a shotgun and “Enforcer” to try and keep her crippled and on the ground.  She’s usually dead in under 3 minutes. 
---
Bloodied melee builds can do absolutely insane amounts of damage. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
i havent been playing alot recently, what is the " sentinel assassin " thing?
---
But of course you weren't duping were you? Why can't people play a game as intended.
---
Yeah. As of lately I've been building around  Charleston Landfill. I enjoy the junk.  I'm good away from water, don't need it. It be nice to build extractor at camp. I didnt know you could. Thought it was set just for workshops. I'll have to look into that. Thanks
---
I use my 50 cal all the time and I am not banned
---
50k items? I can only hold about 400 in my stash or something wtf
---
1. The email flat out says it's a temporary suspension.
---
2. Despite saying that there is no appeal, some people replying to that email have already gotten responses.
---
Well I hope you’re not disappointed. We all know every game that sounds good always meets expectations, right?
---
And insulting my IQ? Wow, you must really be defensive about that game already. 
---
Hope you aren't talking about RMT
---
Sure . If you skip sleeping and bathroom breaks .
---
Just being curious here...but does anyone here believe that all the posts on Reddit Fallout 76 market... selling 3* Bloodied Weapons this and 3* Unyielding &amp; Assasins Sentinel that and thousands of rounds of ammo and aid, and always have maxed caps, obtained all these "Rare Items" legitimately?!? Is that why many don't use their GT/player name on here to create these posts??? 😒
---
It seems pretty obvious to me that he's full of shit and taking advantage of the people here.
---
Dunno I wondered the same. I don't care much for karma but found no post warning heavy gun users so I assumed I should make one since Bathesda bans .50 cal &amp; minigun users for their ammo count
---
Nope. Still a massive fanbase.
---
No I'm talking about people who own Bethesda. Maybe they don't like the competition. Maybe they are selling stuff on ebay. Maybe they also have shares in EA.
---
I read them. Yes, he is full of shit. 
---
The servers are sooooo empty right now
---
Was gonna say... that NukaCrpyt guy on point. Usally takes 6-12 hours after reset till they up. 
---
The screenshot is still floating around: [https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz)
---
If enemies weren't bullet sponges, then far fewer people would be able to tag them.  I don't know if Bethesda intended this or not.  I do know that if they weren't sponges,  very few people would be able  to tag legendary enemies before they went down.
---
And people would be raising hell about it.
---
My point is that you can't complain about bullet sponges while at the same time supporting the tag requirement,  Because being bullet sponges is exactly what makes  it possible for people to tag it, you included. 
---
Of course not, you're really smart knowing that, because no one else in the world knew that every game that sounds good isn't always good. And you can keep defending this flood of fo76 with your scotch tape, but I've proved my point.
---
You are weird
---
For reals. Instead of helping each other out and band together what people that is left, they establish a false hierarchy comprised of the "betters" vs the "guilty", and try to wipe each other out. It's both hilarious and sad to watch.
---
Hey... some people have nothing better to do... But I'm not judging. Lol
---
Srs Bsns. Complete that quest and Watoga almost becomes the safest place on the map to run around in.
---
Try a .50 cal and do the math how much ammo you'll need for a ban ;) Even causals can exceed the 30 day limit...
---
Yeah he's not though. He has over 360k ultracite ammo? You'd have to spend your entire play time crafting it and not even using it.
---
I started to worry, have about 250 hours and running commando so all fully auto and constantly need ammo.  I scrap everything and constantly craft ammo in batches of 500 to 1,000 maybe more for .50.  Just got home and logged on, no issues.  
---
Do you want some food for the salt you carry?
---
Or complete a questline, have to find a comic nerd's card collecting album, prompted by a funny holotape at a Hubris Comics shop like the ruined one in Watoga
---
People don't seem to get that it's not a ban it's a suspension. Could be fixed in the patch in 7 hours for all we know.
---
Thank you! Wow, that's interesting that that email was specific to their account but the other emails going around are general. 
---
Makes you wonder why they differ.
---
Think about it to make 3,4 or 5 thousand ammo a day you need so much of certain resources too. 
---
It's just not super viable to say I only crafted ammo and shit and to make that much stuff each and everyday unless you take advantage of things you shouldn't.
---
It's not unbelievable that people lie just accept what you get and move on.
---
Either you wait till your unsuspended or you move onto something else.
---
They've made the game way better... what? Server stability has increased tenfold. They're implementing changes the people want (stash? Pvp only servers?), they're banning cheaters  Fixing bugs... seriously what are you talking about
---
There’s 7 different types of vendors and they have 200 caps every 20 hours. Go the same time daily and you’ll be good. 
---
Yes there are more vendors but Raider all share as do Responder and  2 locations at White Springs each with 200 caps. 
---
I posted this to the official forums so hopefully it gathers some steam
---
An exploitable glitch is a feature until it patched out!!
---
This is game is great go play with your tool elsewhere I bet you got suspended account.
---
Boo hoo to you too.
---
Love fallout 76 
---
If I was banned unfairly I'd go to support rather than badmouth Bethesda on Reddit. I've been banned on other games for no reason and when I went through the proper systems I got unbanned . It still sucks to get banned  
---
Of course you shoot level 10's with a 50cal?  My 50cal is like a BB gun so I don't use it. What 30 day limit? Oh and you didn't answer my question - so yes you hot caught CHEATING and got banned. 😂😂😂
---
You don't lock up your house when you leave home?
---
I didn’t get suspended and I love the game, fucker. Read my other comments before you go talking shit.
---
Sure buddy. Wether you lie or just play 1 hour a day :)      
---
Otherwise just do the math. 250 rounds per reload. A couple thousands per SBQ. But only slightly more than 100k **over 30 days**. Just killing queens twice a day in a small group with a 50cal gets you banned.
---
Blaming Bethesda is OK when Bethesda is doing wrong,but there is no point in blaming them when they are fine. That's what everyone forget. 
---
How about just showing it on the map when you hover over the station? 
---
People might use that much ammo but they aren't stockpiling 100+ thousand of it while not using it. The banned accounts have this ammo just sitting there. Sounds like you got banned and are trying to make a believable excuse.
---
What utter BS
---
&gt;...this game is a prime example of **“Too little, too late.”** Good God.
---
Don't do things that would get you banned. Pretty plain and simple actually 
---
They have done literally nothing "fine" since releasing this joke of a game. But whatever, this sub is beyond repair. Bye people, enjoy this "game". 
---
Right.
---
You were well informed about the dupe ban, yet 200k nuka colas and 20k TSE wasn't a red flag? You can't blame Bethesda for your stupidity
---
not items :'D I meant each single cap + each single bullet + each single junk scrap a.s.o.
---
Sanjay's is inside a pipe on the west side. You can see the open pipe from the road facing east. I think I have the directions correct
---
Pfft what's this poppycock? Bethesda's automated systems are completely foolproof just like their games, how dare you imply otherwise you degenerate heretic!
---
/s if that's not obvious.
---
Thanks for the sound advice but this is a joke hahaha joke
---
I'd love to build in the Mire, but that whole place still freaks me the fuck out. 
---
Splendid, thanks. I always tend to neglect that area.  
---
Looting weights is a really poor way of farming lead. Put on your excavator armour and go to lucky hole mine.
---
You’re damn right I’m salty, being salty isn’t inherently a bad thing. Yes, I’m salty and for a good reason. Why aren’t you?
---
I'd really like to know why all these banned players have all been a Reddit users for one month. 
---
I'm sure he actually used a Grafton calculator.
---
This is one of a few reasons why I uninstalled.
---
I'm not touching the game again until they release the server files.
---
You haven't played the game day one and today, to say something like that. 
---
#Fuck the TOS.
---
There's always some bullshit in there about how you're not buying the game, but access to a service and companies can ban you for whatever reason they want.
---
And terrible developers like Bethesda would rather ban players Bethesda's own incompetence than actually owning up to their mistakes.  
---
how do i increase my strength and intelligence please
---
Uhm... okay. I bet you're a wise guy...
---
I primarily use a power fist, which necessitates repairing every 15-20 minutes IRL time... costing gears, adhesive, and steel. Being a melee build, I also have to run armor repairs and do a lot of cooking to maintain health... so I’m in a similar boat. But yeah, just logged on... no issues. I’m real skeptical at this point of anyone claiming to have been booted unfairly. 
---
Bethesda didn't ban everyone who bought duped weapons and armor. IMO using duped weapons and armor is cheating. A lot of athletes use steroids, just because they don't get caught doesn't mean they are not cheaters.
---
Another exploit is fighting the queen outside of the nuke zone so the cheaters can run their duped unyielding armor bloodied builds with their duped bloodied deathclaw gauntlets. Bethesda needs to fix the Queen's pathing so that she won't leave the nuke zone.
---
Sooooooo..... people are still cheating.
---
Same here.
---
Can't be banned if you never traded/interacted with others.
---
It's not though. The premier was lacking to say the least, but it's consistently gotten better and it's exciting to see where it will go especially with consistent community feedback! What platform are you on? Play with me. Im telling you... the games only getting better.
---
Because I don't have a problem with the game. So do a lot of people. That's why you expect down votes. Because you know a lot of people would disagree.
---
At least I'm not banned.
---
Awesome! That's pretty cool. No, I didn't call the VaultTec number but now I really wish I had!
---
I'm not falling for that!
---
Lol made a whole ass post. let him live 
---
noticed this the other day also
---
Yeah sadly they shut it down I think mid last year some time. It was cool while it lasted tho 
---
I have played it day 1 actually. I'm not playing it anymore that's true. I won't be playing it anytime soon that's for sure. Now, I lost all hope and unsubscribed from this subreddit. I was only subbed to keep minitoring this game and hold out hope that it gets better. After almost 4 months, nothing substantial happened. Zero. But hey at least the ATOM shop is updated regularly. 
---
I didn't even know this was going on. Me and all my friends have just been playing the game. It's not even about playing it as it's intended to be played. We just *play it*. No insane grinding for hours and hours, no trying to dupe items or crash servers, closest any of us have to mule accounts are second characters to try different builds and lore run throughs that we transfer some plans and fully modded plans to. How is any of that stuff *fun*?
---
+karma really appreciated man! Thank you!
---
This guy deleted his main post, and that either proves that:
---
1: He’s a duper.
---
2: He bought his ammo in bulk off the market, and the ammunition was probably duped.
---
3: He was receiving hate mail or worse from that post.
---
4: All of the above?
---
Even though he made two posts about guides to the game, he could’ve easily just stole someone else’s information off of youtube or even possible reddit. And I’m pretty sure that those guide posts he made were to give him cover, such as being able to say ”Look, I made a guide to the game, so I’m innocent!”
---
I knew a lot of folks would be in denial, sure. Fallout 76 is a shell of what it once was and that’s not okay for a game that’s not even a year old yet.
---
I’m not defending 76 at all. I’m saying recommending an alternative game that’s not even out yet is dumb. They can’t go get it yet, so why recommend it like you’ve played it already?
---
Don’t even start the character 
---
Well it takes around 60 junk scraps in total to craft 240 .50 ammo. If Super Duper triggers you'll even got more.      
---
Can't speak for others but I'm 100% confident that I never had just 10.000 junk scraps of a certain item. For .50 ammo I only crafted like half of the ammo count and bought the rest. I think I used around 200-250k bullets over the past 30 days since I used to play a lot.
---
Then why you banned tho? I do exactly what you be talking about every single day. Idk if i used around 100k bullets but i definitely use a lot. What you do bro? Dupe?
---
Some people might be banned unfairly sure, but why should i trust this community to be honest? It's been making up blatant lies since before the game even came out. Just to cause drama.
---
To default to a position where you believe anyone who claims to be unfairly banned is just as reckless.
---
Looting weights is good for a quick burst of lead if you hit all the weights and tin can joints.  Also if you don't feel like farming acid to turn ore into scrap.
---
Why did you delete it all
---
Yeah thats kinda weird 
---
This is not true. I had no stockpile too.       
---
They ban if you own over 100k bullets **over a time span of 30 days**. No matter if you used most of them, sold a few or stored the rest. 100k bullets **combined**.
---
I wonder if anybody tried to create a Todd Howard look alike chatacter....imagine running around....Im going to work on this!
---
Yep and I've got it
---
This guy posts in an LSD sub all the time, I wouldn't listen to him lol.
---
It's got the original fallout creators and new Vegas developers, they have made good games, and have seen 76's fuck up. They won't let us down, especially since it isnt multiplayer, there is less to mess up on. Plus any game at this point sounds better than 76.
---
They had to have been bought or farmed. They aren't duplicates.
---
There is a 100% learn chance in the marine helmet only
---
It’s been getting technically better, but only by a tiny bit each time and they’ve made a bad habit of taking one step forward then two steps back. Plus they’ve already driven away a metric fuckton of players; you can argue that it’s not too little, but it’s most definitely pretty late. 
---
I’m on PS4. If you wanna play sometime, I’m down. I really do love this game, guys, I think y’all have misunderstood me in this regard. That is why I’m so “salty” about how Bethesda has been doing things.
---
Thanks for your feedback. 
---
However, I'm still missing this particular option completely, no matter what I do. 
---
Maybe because I'm on PC? 
---
I've come across a more recent post about this and someone replied that PC seem to simply lack the option to join someone's game who is not your friend. /slowclap
---
99999999999 hour guy
---
I had nothing else just over 10k for sure. They 100% banned me for .50 cal usage... I had around 20k stockpiled I think but used may 200-250k over the last 30 days. 100k+ seems to be enought...
---
I went to support almost 48 hrs ago, and have yet to hear back. It's frustrating and once you're just stuck waiting, joining in on the reddit conversation makes sense.
---
Why are so many people looking for bloodied meat hooks?
---
Really? Playing this game for 316 days and 16 hours is only worth 10 atoms? What a dick slap to the face for putting up with this clown fiesta for almost a year
---
Yes and I have it
---
That guy is also me ;)
---
We talking about the same Oxhorn? You got some better videos?
---
Want to sell the fat man
---
Who are the 'best posters here'?
---
:O Yoh put my name somewhere on the website. I wanna be cool :D 
---
We’ll see
---
They 100% banned you for your 50 cal usage? What is this smell? Oh it's bullshit. You sure it wasn't your duping?
---
What I look for in a C.A.M.P. location is simple - water for my large purifier, and far enough away from Vault 76 that I have a second free FT destination that isn’t a redundancy.
---
I’ve built south of Nuka-Cola (someone’s already mentioned the spot I believe). But currently I’m in the Eastern swamp near Valley Galleria. Ive built my camp against a cliff pocket at the map edge, have access to water, and plenty of soil for farming. It’s perfect for me!
---
If you do get suspended you can buy a new account for $5 because the game is so shit 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Wtf are you on about? You're telling me it's unethical to team up against other people with people you know?
---
&gt; but it will be the easiest fix for them.
---
I mean, even the bobby pin fix took two attempts.
---
dunno why you got downvoted but yes that might be possible, I know a few causals who got banned for having literally nothing, not even legendary gear 
---

---
I'm on ps4 too! Psn same as user.  I understand frustration but honestly,  every patch its getting better,  and i think people may forget the team aspect is 100% the best part. Games never slow or boring in good company. Can't wait for new content. 
---
No they were not. The ONLY place I heard people saying that's how it was is the /r/fallout guys.
---
If you hit the command line you’ve gone too far. 
---
what's so good about sentinel assassin?
---
Thats wat u get for being a shitty duper 😂😂😂
---
Ok, I'm wondering how this poster got it then. I checked 900 hour guy's comment history and he hasn't seemed to share that image.
---
I guess that's the confusing thing. I mean sure SOMEONE cheated by why are we to believe it's that guy when this post doesn't really link it to him directly?
---
I know and get that, they seem to be waiting till the patch today to explain their actions. I hope by that point you'll get your answers and be back on 76
---
No such thing as acceptable losses when it comes to being able to play a game u paid for.  If u didn't cheat then it's not right.  Just fix ur damn game and quit punishing ur players.
---
Okay, let me stop you right here. Just because we have different opinions on a game doesn't mean we're delusional. I wouldn't call you delusional for not liking the game. And of course the game might not be in it's best state right now, but some of us are hanging on with patience because we know that the game will be spectacular when they fix things over time. You can lose hope and leave right now and that would be understandable. However, it's unreasonable to call people indenial for having an opinion that differs from you. 
---
you mean 900 ? or that 900 was a lie?
---
Sigh... well lets see when you get banned. Then you may re-think your accussations...
---
Yeah, I'm hoping we find out more, but I doubt it will be this patch solely because it would take more time to create the fix for that. 
---
It'll still be there. I try to do that at WS 
---
Love your name!
---
Oh that image was on his main thread that got like 10k upvotes. He deleted the thread after he revealed that he was exploiting and people started questioning him
---
Don't even buy the game.
---
I just want to come over and chill out in your camp. It's beautiful. 
---
That's the other thing, in the comments the poster seems to be referring to 900 hour guy but the title say 999999 hours and I'm confused overall here.
---
Incoming shilling... Holy shit that game is soo good. And it's free to boot! I've always hated BR games but man Respawn is killing it with that game. Games are just so perfectly paced you don't even have time to get salty, even with shitty teammates! The robust pinging system is godsend as well, fuck am I grateful I never have to open my mic in a team based game! What you doing reading this? Go try it out now!
---
I doubt that
---
That Play With Team is not to FIND you a team, it means you were already on a team and it was trying to put you on that same server. If tehre was an error, it was that someone sent you a team invite you didnt respond to and it didnt 'clear' that invitation upon disconnect (assuming you werent on a team, I assumed from your post you dont play team)
---
My preferred is the suitcase at white spring station next to the stash. 
---
Occasionally I found something. 
---
This guy knows what’s up
---
Ok, damn, anyone got a screenshot of that edit since it's deleted now? I mean I believe it but I'd kind of like that bit of proof before I try to tell anyone in other subs that "no, Bethesda didn't do anything wrong here, turns out the poster cheated". Like other subreddits are crossposting it as "LOL Bethesda screws up again, they can't do anything right".
---
Hey, when is this error message thing supposed to pop up? Its before the main menu with play/character/settings right? Away from home but my younger brother feeds my dogs so i asked him to to start the game and he got to the main menu. I should be fine then? 
---
It’s kind of hard for you to prove that you didn’t do it but nothing you provided is really evidence unfortunately :( sorry you got banned but I’m not sure I entirely believe you
---
/u/aten_ra for a start, he has made extremely extensive bug report framed posts about the issues that deserve attention, how and why they deserve it.
---
there are others, but that is one of the ESSENTIAL members of the coalition that I would place for nomination for the first round.
---
&gt;One day before the ban wave? 
---
He was already banned by then.
---
&gt;And of course the game might not be in it's best state right now, but some of us are hanging on with patience because we know that the game will be spectacular when they fix things over time.
---
This just leads me back to the too little, too late statement. Of course I don’t think you’re delusional. I’m just saying alot of people are in denial that Bethesda is fucking up big time. I love the game. i wish the best for it. I just hate Bethesda for going about things this way and harming Fallout 76.
---
Lmao 76 market, lots of legendary items, yeah you're ban worthy
---
so did I and if you scroll throught all the posts and think all are liars then I can't help you :) of course most cheaters would claim their innocence at first... but Banthesda just got rid of a large junk of their player base incl. causal gamers.     
---
You said you used lots of .50 ammo and they still ban people so I see no reason why you shouldn't be affected too
---
Easy with melee builds but if you have a rifle build you can sneak solo the whole thing in like 30 mins once you learn proper pathing. Only really works if you have the tank buster tho. That 36% pen is too good to not have.
---
Basically this entire sub at this point lmao
---
I'd rather Bethesda do a ban wave and fix the duping even if a small percentage of those people were innocent. I know what it's like not being able to play a game you bought. I bought tricential  full price at launch and haven't played since December because of the duping. I want the game fixed, and I'm sure the people banned wrongly will get unbanned pretty shortly 
---
Ha I didnt downvote anything but you are the same old whine record throwing around 'denial' and fuckit let's join in on the downvoting
---
Man y'all coming with some good conspiracy theories. Keep them coming 
---
This patch may have changed the ban hammer parameters and unban people that didn't actually dupe and were flagged falsely.
---
apex has been endorsed by the greatest game community minded influencers i trust, give it a shot. i may, soon.
---
the guards?
---
I checked their history, going back a while they haven't sold anything except flux, they repeatedly try to sell some decent armor but never make a sale. Going back farther they're buying pretty basic stuff, doesn't look like someone selling dupes at all.
---
You probably shouldn't make accusations considering you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Never heard of Just Survive
---
I got banned and I haven't even played since day 2. I'm still lvl 12. I just logged in for the patch to see if my fast travel bug was gone
---
How about you read my other comments and get the full picture instead of jumping to conclusions, and while you’re at it quit assuming that I care about internet points.
---
I'll get back to you when that happens buddy. keep your fingers crossed
---
So hold on a second. It's a handful of 'miss-identified' people making tons of posts, rather than a group of cheaters making tons of posts? Uhh...
---
Semantics aside the probability of one has nothing to do with the other. You can have both conditions be true, or neither be true. I don't quite think 'Occum' or Occam for that matter would agree with your implementation of the practice.
---
Well there is no unbanning after that.
---
ok, can you name some of your favorite games that might describe how warframe gets placed / is enjoyed? what is it like / one upping / combo of ?
---
It was Clara
---
The 900 hours guy was proven to be lying through Bethesda’s response email to him. Stop believing every user who said they were wrongfully banned.
---
Never thought of taking a screenshot. You don't expect someone to delete a thread with 10k upvotes lul. 
---
Buying sure, staying with it I doubt. 
---
Betheada wanted a live service game, and they've made a pretty bad one. 
---
It's fun, but it has no depth and very little if interest in the long run. 
---
There are games which do everything FO76 does better. As I've said before on this subreddit, if it didn't carry the Fallout name this game would be another forgotten survival game. 
---
If he then crashes the server and dupes those items then yes.
---
Awesome :D I'm overweight right now. Not sure how increases stash size will help my ass size but that'll be nice too.
---
it still shows you on radar when you're crouched with chameleon, I've tested it. Unless something changed with the last patch.
---
Never said it didn’t have a *decent* fanbase (not quite massive at this point) but it’s been massively cut down by Bethesda and it’s growing smaller and smaller.
---
yeah unimpressed with it.
---
just sticking with vanilla barrell
---
"Just survive" is litterally the way i describe 76 to people who havnt played it. Its a trash game
---
I also have a 11 yo and im pretty sure he would also take a deal like that. 
---
Cos there is only so many hours in the day and you are boring and predicatable, I turn my more focused attention at stuff that might payoff. Sorry man it is the truth, you sound like 100 other posters
---
Ah, this would make a lot of sense! I often get team invites from random people and just ignore then. Thank you for taking the time to take this lady back to school!
---
I hope that Survival mode also balances the survival aspects of this game, because at the moment, the game is like surviving at the food buffet.
---
I know that at the moment it's just a PvP mode, but I can hope...
---
So it is like JS ! 
---
It did get ironed out, thanks for the positive vibes and giving me some problem solving options
---
Should still be there. I’ve hopped the golf club and ended up finding the ice box with the stuff I had left in it. 
---
could also have been pissed off at community attitude to him (not saying right or wrong) -- I had a load of really helpful Division stuff (I think anyway) that I deleted after a bit of a disagreement with the community at large.
---
Yeah I hope they wont the same mistakes that Db made 
---
Everything Atom related is a dick slap in the face of the game’s fans, from the drip fed, minuscule amount they let you earn, to the fact that the Atom Shop is updated every week, while the game is unplayable.
---
BuT YOu cAn EArN AtOMs iN tHe GAmE
---
No worries. Back when disconnects were happening so very much, we saw this PLAY WITH TEAM option replace PLAY on every disconnect, which were hourly!
---
With all my friends getting banned for bs reasons it is the current objective for me
---
If you really have that much shit better to do and if I’m really so boring and predictable then how about you quit replying and go about your day, bud. If you’re going to put in the effort to vote and especially reply, you should put in the effort to read. Otherwise just ignore this whole thing and get to the important stuff.
---
why did he reveal that he was exploiting?
---
I bet you remind the teacher about homework
---
1 dollar 100 atoms some things they want 1800 atoms common
---
For a toxic shitty game
---
Oh no... please don’t say I could’ve lost more and didn’t notice 
---
Oh but still worry my ammo crafter who makes a ton of ammo just got banned for making almost 100k .50 ammo in 1 month
---
If you’re referring to the 900 hours guy, Bethesda proved he was lying in their response email. Stop believing everyone who says they were wrongfully banned.
---
Email: https://imgur.com/gallery/4hSqlRE

This kind of thing always reminds me of the CS:GO streamer that was playing on stream with her hack turned on, then blamed her friend for ‘using it on her computer and not turning it off’. I love online ban waves cause the train wreck stories that come out of it
---
Have no idea. Maybe he was so high on dupes that he thought 400k ultracite ammo was a common thing for everyone
---
I just commented about that girl 😂😂
---
Wow why did you get downvoted just for asking a question?? Smh
---
Assassin’s Sentinel armour is really good for PVP,  it reduces damage something like 15% while standing and not moving, and reduces damage from other players. It might do other stuff, but I don’t have it yet myself so I don’t know 🤷‍♀️ 
---
My fingers are crossed that we won't be making anymore steps backwards on the game with future updates/patches. I remember the continuous server crashes all too well. I was one of the suckers who were in what they were calling a beta.
---
Btw - thanks for your service to the community... Pretty sure if you stopped that nuke launches would grind to a standstill. 
---
If you are crafting .50 or 5 mm 100k+ ammo in a month is easy if you are playing 6+ hours a day
---
Dunno, but thanks for the answer
---
we got them reddit barbed flaming pitchforks boi    
---
-------E    
---
-------E
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda would take into account that you can make far more .50 cal ammo (180 with ammosmith 2 vs 25-50 with other types). Even if they did set a limit of 100k in a month for .50s, that's an average of 3333 1/3 rounds per day crafted. Which would mean you'd have to craft the ammo an average of 14-15 times a day to hit that mark if using Super Duper. Possible? Yeah, but only for someone who really plays hardcore every day.
---
But again, I highly doubt they put the same limit on .50 cal (180 rounds with ammosmith 2) as they would on .45 (27 rounds with ammosmith 2).
---
Fatman for life
---
There is a junk pile just upstream and a little east of Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm, plus another junk pile at that workshop so you could have both.
---
And for shit, too. Shitty, ugly skins.
---
Many people cheated and now they came here when banned to claim "innocent".
---
Yeah the 900 hours guy was proven to be lying lol 
---
This would be the correct answer if OP asked how many vendor factions there are. But instead OP suggested that hovering over the vendor location would show if there’s any caps at all left over. 
---
 Sometimes, you just need a little less gun :)
---
Just so you know. I'm not banned. But I've had enough of this experiment. So I'm going to break away and find something else to do.
---
Being afraid to play a game isn’t how we should be. Bethesda should accept responsibility for making an easily exploitable system 
---
Too late. I had 10 maps and 10,000 caps... naughty naughty im gone 
---
3.4k a day? Try 3.4k per minute of SBQ fight
---
If your point was to troll with a stupid statement and then proceed to contradict that statement then uh I guess? But there’s really not a point to that outside of  trolling. Otherwise you’re just stupid if all that’s asnt intentional. 
---
...........
---
..........
---
‘K
---
Son of a bitch. The one guy I was willing to give an ambivalent response to, that maaaaybe he was legit. But no.
---
Yeah and now that it’s “popular” to say you were wrongfully banned, all the real dupers who got banned for good reason are coming out of the woodwork and raking in the upvotes.
---
wasn't* don't call someone stupid when you can't spell.
---
Is anyone there? This is getting beyond a joke 
---
Some legit players are getting hit on accident tho
---
Bans... bans never change
---
Regarding reports: Rule 9 ("no witch-hunting") applies to in-game stuff. We have no rule against /r/quityourbullshit type posts, such as this that serve to clarify the facts of the situation. However, any personal attacks or attempts to harass the user in question will still result in a ban. The post itself is fine - what you do with the information may not be.
---
"You guys really believe to all banned" The words of an illiterate are lost on me. 
---
haha yeah ikr ;) but then it's just 100min til you get flagged for a ban
---
Wait what was posted that was removed so fast? Lol 
---
I never pre-order anything, but damn Bethesda is like an old girlfriend you can't say no to when she texts :(
---
I'm happy with my stability now, it's my #1 hope that it doesn't regress. I have never cared about canvas bags or youtube haters or that fool rum bottle, but damn you have to have a stable game!
---
Except he said he only really uses shotguns. As a shotgun user myself, no way would I waste so much time making ammo I’d never use. He bullshat us all.
---
Can u point me to the post that revealed him to be lying?
---
Seems like your post was removed.  IDK what that is all about.
---
1. He deleted his original post
---
2. Here’s a link to Bethesda’s response email to him https://imgur.com/gallery/4hSqlRE
---
Not 100% sure this proves duping.   
---
None of those ammo totals outside the Ultracite are crazy, it may loot insane but with a "mule" account that is not unreasonable, I'm a melee build and until the Black Tuesday patch I saved every round and stored it for later use / sale.   
---
I'd need to do the math, but I do know the last time I bother making Ultracite ammo, with super duper and just burning lead and some extra fluxes I ended up with a few thousand rounds...   
---
I wish they paid me to downvote your post 
---
I take it you are going to pass on a rebuttal?
---
Well all the facts may not be entirely accurate it seems. Just going through his post history he has an impressive list of very rare legendary weapons for sale, acquire every single serum recipe plus spares that he sells, and in addition some other rare plans and rare outfits.
---
I have a hard time believing that he got all of that legit when he already admitted to having gotten items from a duper 'friend'.
---
they dont take count of char/account "age" i have several mules that were left untouched by spring clean and apparent suspension of accounts, but they had recieve tons of items, even the supposed "rare" ones within the last 30 days
---
If you are some one who farms Halloween candy likes it's a job 100k of it is possible I have gotten 10k in a few days maybe 13 hours of play time if and that was for farming legendarys not call candy
---
Interesting to know. I use the handmade, some days i play all day long I've probably fired off more then 4000 rounds before in a day if im feeling trigger happy. At the end of each night me and the wife back all our extra unused ammo we find on a 2nd character. we have been doing this for some time. Im sitting with 500 pounds in stash and around 800 on the character. Hope that doesn't put us at any risk. Im totally against duping , it has destroyed our economy. Be sad to see any players playing the game in a legit manner get banned .
---
He also deleted his original post. You recognize that the amount of Ultracite is crazy but assume he got the rest legit? Come on man.
---
Maybe after 900 hours he got tired of it. Not saying this guy duped, but I don't think game time means anything. He could've made the secondary account so he wouldn't get caught, but failed to hide his identity in the process (using the same IP address).
---
I'd be very skeptical, I know there probably are a few who didn't deserve it, but knowing or unknowingly, the vast majority triggered the banned by doing something wrong 
---
Well there's some bullshit getting sprayed around here, I craft 5-7k 5.56 ammo every day to split between mine and my wives gun toons.
---
 Takes roughly 2hrs with the hammer swingers to collect the lead, steel and gunpowder to do this. We do this every day and haven't had an issue. Make the ammo and 2-3 hours later with the shooty toons it's gone again.
---
The thing is if you trigger their system the code tells them if it's been crafted or duped. There's thousands of players that craft these amounts all the time without getting banned. 
---
I go through 2K rounds of 5.56 a day playing.  I make that much if not more daily.  I was up to 5K in one day.  So yeah, it is feasible if that's all I do in a day is play Fallout 76 all day.
---
If you didn't think Bethesda didn't give a shit about anything they do before, hopefully you know now.
---
&gt; a lot being ultracite which is a big harder to come by.
---
Seriously. When I need to craft 1,000 ultracite 50 cal ammo, it's a big project. The amount of hardened masses and violet flux you need for that, you can MAYBE acquire in like two hours of work, if everything lines up in your favour. Like, if the nuke drops on an area with an especially high number of mutated ferns and the RNG REALLY favours you in terms of getting those hardened masses from enemies. Then I sit down with level 3 ammosmith and level 3 super duper and I get enough ultracite ammo for one SBQ fight. 
---
The idea of 640,000 being obtained by any legitimate means is absurd to me. 
---
I hate that I know exactly where your camp is now.
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence, and the idea of having a group / coalition / etc (that Bethesda was interested in working with) would be nice 
---
There is no way that is a legit account. If you've never duped then you have nothing to worry about. Case closed.
---
My ammo crafter who only ever crafts ammo was hit because they had 100k +.50 ammo which they farmed for or paid for in caps non stop
---
So the anti duper thing is hitting innocent people 
---
You are crying harder than anyone else on this sub and coming up with new bullshit every minute.
---
Lolll
---
You're definitely one of those "shill/fanbois" that are obvious to just about everyone.
---
It really does feel like that sometimes
---
I use different levels of several perks. I don't mind the perk packs at all.
---
Hardened mass drops from glowing ghouls.  You can junk it for untracite.  If you nuke WS and kill all the ghouls there, forcing re-spawns with a player at the clubhouse, you can get a lot of ultracite.  It's not difficult.  I throw away ultracite now and only keep 25 to 30 hardened mass on my account to stabilize flux.
---
Lol, OP deleted the post, I think our debate is over
---
👍
---
Not 100k items. 100k RARE items. Like Ultracite ammo.
---
Mental illness. 
---
And I'm not saying that to be cute or cheeky. I mean seriously that that level of obsessive collecting looks like some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder. 
---
it is this love that has inspired my primary suggestion other than allowing people to collect and build the items found as camp decor - containers we can build and carry for functional usages related to or exactly the purpose of donating our excess crap. supply /delivery / vendor / junkyard RP. possibilities are endless, and the fallout 1 barter system could be done with a container placed down like power armor frames are.
---
If you use 5000 heavy ammo in an SBQ fight I submit your problem isn’t needing more ammo. 
---
It’s needing to learn to play the game, and how to do a proper heavy build. 
---
You should be able to take a queen down with 1-3 mags of 50cal, gatling or gat laser on any decent build, using a 1* bloodied, AA or furious weapon, 
---
Sorry, heavy build isn’t an excuse for 600,000 ammo. 
---
&gt;While I don't usually like when people go through other users history,
---
It's a legitimate way to get context on a person. It's not like it's private.
---
Bye!
---
Rare items as in 3 stars, bobbleheads, mags, and super stimpacks things not readily available... So ammo and scrap I don't think we're calculated because I woulda got banned I made a boat load of ammo to prove the "I got banned from crafting" peeps wrong ... Made 60k Ammo...no ban
---
I mean the game is built around crafting and hording items, Rare or not. So now players are being punished for this? I'm not saying everyone is innocent or guilty but I wouldn't be so quick to judge either way until sufficient evidence is presented.
---
you'll get an email informing you about that you have 100k+ of a rare item. Thing is that all items are considered rare incl. standard ammo or halloween candy. The only thing I had combined over 100k over the last 30 days is .50 standard ammo. Only had 17-20k stockpiled before I got banned.     
---
Also isn't 180 without ammo smith? Can't check tho. However you could buy ammo too (I think I bought 30-40k .50 over the last 30 days) or loot a couple thousands .50 bullets combined over 30 days. So it's not limited to craft 100k+. Just own them.
---
also the ice machine that you see when spawning in at the golf house upper level entrance is used a lot for excess / donation
---
thank you based overseer 
---
Because duping took the excitement out of finding rare loot.
---
If your day that most cheaters will proclaim their innocence first doesn't that...kinda...out yourself?
---
Did he remove his own post or did the mods delete that piece of shits post?
---
Ya, I was in there on that thread and got downvoted when I stated people jump to the conclusion that all people who say they were banned for no reason are legit even with no evidence.  One person who replied saying they tend to believe the posters right off got upvoted lol. 
---
Yeah and an idiot to boot.
---
You're the dude that holds a gun used in a murder for a couple of days and then wonders why the cops arrest you for it.
---
The 999999 is a joke referencing how the 900 hour guy lied about not exploiting so who knows what his true hours are. 
---
Is it ok to link this post/image to people who refuse to believe otherwise?
---
I've seen so many people flame every thread regarding those suspensions. It's fun to see that as soon as it is a woman, especially a streamer everyone suddenly seem so helpful and stuff. I'm sorry for you suspension if it is true but I'm more sorry for the self promotion and all those suddenly helpful people
---
No... its 100 without ammosmith.
---
And "all items are considered rare"? Do you have a source to back that up or just making supposition?
---
i like the trait screen but lets be honest the main thing it needs fixed is scrolling through piles of the cards we won't equip.
---
adding a store function to backburner every card that has no equip use is a lighter weight solution to this problem and is a simpler feature going along with the design of the cards and equipping mechanics, and matches the mechanics already in the game for CAMP where items get stored out of view and then recalled.
---
Did the OP remove it? (Vs locked or hidden by mods?)
---
I’m on mobile I’m not sure how to tell the difference 
---
Yeah, always the OP is that one...
---
Fallout 2 wasn't Betheada...
---
Yeah it's been oddly perfect.
---
The worst thing about 76 apparently was the players!
---
Fair point
---
Looks like he was legit banned. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as6rlq/999999\_hours\_guy\_with\_50000000000\_ammo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as6rlq/999999_hours_guy_with_50000000000_ammo/)
---
Because theres nothing to buy or trade for anymore and if they do find something nice it’s really really expensive. They dont want dupers but they want dupe prices
---
You are right, man; physical agony just hurts the body but downvotes hurt the soul
---
If they're claiming that the original OP didn't do anything wrong, and you want to use this image to show what they did, feel free. Just make sure you stay on the right side of the line between "here's what *actually* happened" and "OP is a fucking piece of shit and here's why". Easy enough, but you'd be surprised with some people.
---
Most likely they added it as more proof to an account that was clearly exploiting and needing a ban. 
---
hahaha wow so classic, this is amazing
---
I’m guessing he also exploited repeatable bugged quest turn ins like “Battle Bot” that players used to macro the turn in key to to get multiple quest completion rewards.
---
And obviously this amount of (rare) ammo is duped.  
---
I think I have a rather nice build near WS, just outside the nuke radius and near a pond that spawns level 50 legendary mirelurkers
---
https://imgur.com/a/axrJHXx
---
I know but the email told me I had 100k of an rare item. But the only item I gathered over 100k over a time span of 30 days is .50 standard ammo.      
---
The 900 hours guy got banned for his ultracite ammo count but they listed him standard ammo as well.       
---
I made a ticket but got me response yet. If so I'll add a screenshot because I know there nothing else I had just 50k+ of. It can only be the .50 standard ammo.     
---
I advise you to stop crafting ammo or use different guns til ban wave is over. Else you might get banned too.
---
I'm totally with ya on your entire post. I typically don't pre-order either... The last time I did that was GTA V lol. 
---
Maybe fix your game? I mean it's been out for what, 3 months? I dont know anything about game development but I feel like it shouldn't take that long to fix a duplication glitch. 
---
You sound like the crazy drunk person barging into a conversation. Go back to r/thoughtpolice. My comments weren't even entirely serious. 
---
So, about those guarantees...I call bs
---
A player just suggested that you will be given the cards until you have the number of cards to own every rank. Which makes  a funny kind of sense with how they decided to make you pick it over and over to own different ranks instead of just giving the next rank up so that picking it twice means you own rank1 card and rank 2 card (how I would code that). 
---
I am not sure if its true but I hope so.
---
But I still want duplicating not to exist and have the picking just result in progressing to a higher level while always retaining the initial levels.
---
Did not realize that!
---
Based on your post history you're some insane .1%'er
---
You're buying and selling TSE weapons constantly, trading tens of thousands of caps, crafting and using **over 100,000 bullets per month*, and saying you can farm *500,000 candies per month*
---
You clearly triggered their detection system, and that sucks. But don't make yourself out to be some normal player who got hit with this. You're... you play this shit 16 hours a day 7 days a week, clearly
---
This is completely ridiculous and I love everything about it. Be sure to post it over in r/Falloutsettlements too! 
---
He won't get unbanned, he'll buy another copy of the game and claim he was unbanned.
---
I sure as hell trust them more than a bunch of vitriol laced, hate filled kids who had their cheating ability taken away and are whining about how unfair the universe is to them. 
---
Bethesda made a game I enjoy. 
---
These kid’s contribution to the universe is pouring their terrible emotional management skills onto social media, and nothing else. 
---
If you trust them over Bethesda, I submit there may be something very wrong with you. 
---
Where's the mic drop icon when you need it?

---
I get that but I feel like not everyone that got l l suspended was duping the pitchforks and angry mobs should be reserved for undeniable dupers
---
Anyone who’s knee-jerk reaction to the “I got wrongfully banned” posts is anger at Bethesda, you need to grow up and learn that people will lie to get others on their side.
---
Here’s the thing tho
---
Who cares?
---
Do you really care anymore?
---
Whoever is still playing this game should just do what they want, it’s a Bethesda game. It’s meant to be broken and cheated and made into your world. It’s on Bethesda that they left all of these aspects in a MULTIPLAYER game and didn’t QA. Quit blaming dudes who exploited an easily exploitable game and defending a shitty, greedy company who doesn’t care about you.
---
I've got probably 20 pieces of Unyielding gear. Maybe 6 Bloodied weapons of various types. I literally do not trade with anyone. 
---
Expecting everyone to fight in the nuke zone means you expect everyone to fight in either Power Armor or in Hazmat suits. That you thing that is a reasonable thing tells me all I need to know about your logic.
---
You sound salty as fuck. I hope you can enjoy the game without stressing over what other people are doing.
---
I know right?! It’s bizarre, blame the shit ass company.
---
Plus she wants the fact she's female to help her get unbanned.  It's quite shameful 
---
Glorf, would you mind commenting on users suggesting you revealed you were exploiting, or why the other post about being banned is removed? I can't figure out what's happening and I want to have a handle on what is going on with bethesda and our player community
---
IT vs Users
---
IT: Don't do thing.
---
User: Does thing.
---
IT: Did you do thing?
---
User: I didn't do thing. This just happened.
---
IT: Finds out User did do thing and fixes it.
---
Literally every day. Hell, it's not just IT. 
---
The problem is that it took a bunch of social media drama for them to even allow people to appeal. You don't start a ban wave with "you cannot appeal this decision". 
---
False positives happen. Pretending they don't was an unacceptable move on Bethesda's part.
---
Among other things, these: 
---
   
---
    Stash Limit Increase to 800 – We know this continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item’s you’ve found in the Wasteland!
---
    The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as Heavy Weapons – A fix is being made to properly label the M79 Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher as Heavy Weapons. They will also now correctly benefit from all Heavy Weapons perks except for Heavy Gunner, as we believe it makes more sense for these weapons to benefit from the Demolitions Expert perk. Boom!
---
    Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED – From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot, hit, or disturb another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED and viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely monitor player feedback to this change.
---
    Player Icons now display in more areas throughout the game – Once Patch 6 arrives, hovering over a player on the map will now display their player icon, and Workshops will display their owners’ player icons, too. Additionally, when viewing a turret created by another player, you’ll now be able to see the owner’s name and player icon in the turret’s nameplate.
---
  Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items – With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest items.
---
There will be many more fixes in Patch 6 as we work to make the game stronger and address your top concerns.
---
Yup. We live in the age of Internet mob justice and many are trying to take advantage of that.
---
They are not fine. They left in known exploits from previous games and didn’t QA test. It’s on them that they released a half-assed multiplayer game.
---
That doesnt work. Real assholes will give your gametag to a person who you dont have you blocked, let them enter your server and then piggyback onto your server and harass you that way. Blocking a person does NOTHING to stop harassment because they are still allowed on your server. People can see your game activity from the PS homescreen and log right into your server from there without even being a friend. They just need to be in contact with a person thats following you on PSN. I had an asshole who thought he was gonna troll me in this game with no consequences, he was recently shot in real life.... People think its a game till they play with the right one then its GAME OVER LOL.
---
Bethesda, Players that go out of their way to make these conspiracy theory r/quityerbullshit style posts, deserve lifetime account bans.
---
As am I, lol...  
---
My assumption it was a possible mistaken ban was based on that and the OP being a contributing member vs a random.     
---
The OP must have had serious nerve going for a bluff like that, as Bethesda has pulled that move before, if it was a 9k up voted post and it was complete hogwash
---
I mainly use non-auto weapons beside the 50cal and always gift ammo I don't use to friends who need it. It's beyond me why Bethesda wouldn't make a difference between .50 or 5mm ammo and fusion cores for example. But it seems they don't care and just ban anyone over 100k.      
---
As long as you don't have a combined 100k of a specific ammo type looted/bought/crafted you should be save. In case you feel like you're close to 100k then better use other weapons a few days.
---
Wow, people used outside forums to be able to find people to trade with due to the feature not existing inside the game?
---
*criminal*
---
Absolutely criminal.
---
It's not like the game was setup to have a player trading economy over having NPCs or anything, but is totally missing any usable features to allow that.
---
How *dare* those players try to find a way to play the game.
---
The only real solution is to Ban all people who ever talked about FO76 outside the Bethesda.net site. Its nit like Bethesda has *ever* gone and deleted complaints from their forum to make things look better.
---
This was post just marked removed.....  
---
Wtf 
---
As a side note, every other “I got wrongfully banned” post has been removed, and there’s a new mod stickied post about it 
---
yes
---
Just stand in radiation:) Have to switch server every time you get a mutation..  (equip and unequip starched genes so you dont lose it when taking rad away or other ways of removing it)
---
I posted a post about this so please kindly go to it and make this same statement.  Nothing I post seems to get seen by anyone and this idea for a team of us to advise them is the solution I've been thinking of for that. 
---
&gt; Exactly and as I said in another post, as shitty as it sounds but if you were banned unfairly, there are far more people who deserved it and their absence will make the game a better place.
---
Not if they aren't allowing people to appeal the decision. Let's not forget that Bethesda's initial emails told people they can't appeal, and even walled off their accounts from using the support form on the site.
---
Takes 7600 structures to get each of the 80 atom challenges. 
---
Though some items qualify for more than one challenge and take as little as 1 wood to craft with contractor. 
---
You’d want to do that at a workshop rather than at your camp, so you can use workshop mats and don’t have to dismantle it later. 
---
Great post, had a long debate with someone saying the same thing earlier today!
---
Don’t worry it won’t.
---
That's not surprising with the amount of bullshit on this subreddit. It's like everyone's just doing the whole confirmation bias thing...
---
Nice
---
It’s okay to leave. The engagement on this sub dies more and more by the day. Let Bethesda know they failed hard haha
---
Speaking of which (apart from main topic).. what would be the best area to nuke for harvesting cobalt flux please?
---
Where do I say "they have done all fine" ? I'm just saying that, when bethesda ban dupers, this is fine. 
---
We were all stupid enough to buy this game, is anyone really surprised by how gullible the users here are?
---
Noice
---
War. War never changes.
---
I think it's the parte where they sell stuff for real money that is making them so aggressive.
---
Hahahaha you’re fucking kidding? This game is a continuous train wreck. Please, tell me all the good Bethesda has done since this game released.
---
Lol was just reading it, could be OP didn't remove it and the mods did
---
Kids don’t understand how survivor bias works.
---
A team made of the players would be the kind of team that catalogs the best content and best posters here and on the bethesda general forum, as well as showcasing great streamers, podcasts, and players. That's the only way we can take all the great thought and discussion going on and distill it into a usable form for the benefit of the rest of the players and the bethesda teams trying to do their important job
---
900 Hours?! Maybe this is a good thing
---
Who cares anymore? Game’s dead.
---
They just bought the game and it got the the pint where they were looking trade, get feedback on bugs or just learn more about 76 in general? It’s the only reason why I made mine. 
---
It's pretty obvious that Bethesda designed the queen fight with the intention of it being fought inside of the nuke zone...... without legendary armor.
---
Do keep in mind that you're the one who felt the childish need to revisit this topic 12 hours later.
---
Sooooooo.......
---
That’s called 50% got banned.
---
I got downvoted too but not real bad the people downvoting me downvoted me because I said I don't believe people that say they got banned for no reason without proof.  
---
In any case, OP didn’t provide any proof of her innocence, nor did any of the other posts. Bethesda provided proof to the contrary. The mods are considering any of these types of posts spam from now on, and I completely agree with them.
---
This is correct.
---
The Meat Hook has both WeaponTypeUnarmed \[KYWD:0005240E\] and WeaponTypeMelee1H \[KYWD:0004A0A4\] keywords.
---
Is one of the hundreds of bugs that have been widely reported and to date remain unresolved and unacknowledged.
---
It will probably be fixed at some point in the future.
---
Not seeing a post newer than 3 weeks under your profile
---
Remember when you used that 12 ultracite bullets you accidently crafted 28 days ago? Those will get you banned bro :'D
---
They are fucking cowards, having the gall to spam "innocent" around here after they fucked the game for us and sold shit for real money, get lost you pieces of shit.
---
It's 100k over a 30 day period, and multiple people have all ready lied about false bans, so far not a single one I've seen claiming it was a ban in error has had any evidence and then Bethesda usually replies to the thread going "so how'd you get those 100,000,000,000 nuka quantams?" Or one dude had litterally millions of guns 
---
You better ditch it before its to late man
---
Bugs fixes. You can see all of them on their website. You can find it's not enough (that's a fair opinion) but saying they've done nothing is lying.
---
Can't ban me twice bro lol just made me laugh so though it ighr someone else :) 
---
Not sure every duper sold stuff for real money
---
I play on PC. What is the situation with disappearing corpses?
---
Apart from the normal corpses:
---
I have had Legendary mobs disappear,
---
Scorched Beasts, one as recently as a couple of hours ago, during the Hold the Line Event,
---
and Last night a Mothman corpse disappeared. With the Mothman corpse I was able to open the loot window for a second, no looting, and it instantly disappeared along with the corpse.
---
*shrug*.   
---
One could argue my walls of text regarding bugs are spam as well! ;). 
---
But seriously, I want to do the math in the morning with super duper, might be outside the reasonable numbers...
---
&gt;Quit blaming dudes who exploited an easily exploitable game and defending a shitty, greedy company who doesn’t care about you.
---
That's not what this is about. It's about some guy lying and fanning the flames. 
---
Easy. Morgantown. There's heaps and heaps of mutfruit plants in the area around Mamma Dolche's, and they produce cobalt flux. And there's lots of spawn points for feral ghouls and scorched in the city and airport, making those great spots to farm for hardened masses and such too. 
---
There's SOME cobalt flux to be had off on the far eastern edge of the Whitesprings, along the road between the resort and the Blackwater Mine, but it's not nearly as rich a source as Morgantown is. 
---
Butthurt, Butthurt never changes.
---
The difference between your post and the wrongful ban posts is that your posts are actually beneficial to the community 
---
A little love for Cancer Bats. 👍😎
---
I said “they are not fine” in regards to them leaving in these legacy exploit bugs to begin with and now straight up banning people who abuse it. It’s as if Bethesda set them up. Where did I say you said they have done all fine tho? 
---
The battle lines have been drawn, there are a group that will defend whatever happens in this game through some incredibly bizarre mental gymnastics. There is also a group that enjoys the chaos and just wants to watch the world burn, unfortunately it is next to impossible to accurately tell these types from the legitimately spurned. 
---
&gt;If you see someone make a post about how they got banned, check their history before commenting.
---
Better yet, just don't comment. Don't even pay any of these people any attention, as harsh as it is to say. 
---
Wouldn't it be great if VATS melee benefitted from one of the mutations ? I think that twisted muscles or marsupial are the best candidates, to provide double the range for vats attacks with melee, seeing as that is a leaping maneuver and the mutation that boosts melee or the one that boosts jumping should directly impact that, as eagle eyes does for vats Criticals.
---
Picture does't seem to list which ultracite ammo type... Which does make a difference 
---
Check his post history.
---
He has a trade thread up where he is selling a very impressive list of rare legendaries, he has every serum plan plus spares that he sells on top of other rare plans, and as a cherry a bunch of rare outfits. That is just what he advertises. 
---
His first trade on reddit is made a month ago and a few days after that he is dropping offers in the excess of 100k.
---
Not including armor and admitting to having a couple thousand of a certain power armor mod that honestly i don't know where you get, but i don't even haven't even seen a couple thousand of the barbed walking cane mod.
---
When everything is tallied i can totally see why he got hit by a ban.
---
Sadly the post is deleted but the 900 hour guy posted a screenshot from support which listed ammo counts as reason for a ban. There were some probably justified 250k ultracite rounds (not impossible but still highly unlikely) but also standard bullets were listed (unrealistic for things like .44 or 2mm EC but pretty common values for .50 or 5mm).
---
Hacked it and whacked and slashed it
---
The main problem I feel is that when someone gets banned they run here and say O I did nothing wrong and got banned. Other people who also got banned back up the story all with no proof and then When the proof comes out like you posted everyone backs off until the next guy does the same thing and then here comes everyone that is supposedly banned for no reason yet offer no actual proof and when someone shows why they got banned the community backs off and forgets it until the next "banned for no reason" shows up. 
---
You admitted to cheating. You got banned. Accept this. 
---
Sure buddy... Selling Fluxes, Rare Legendaries, Serums and Serum Recipies.
---
Sure you never duped, not once.
---
Yeah, “bug fixes” that bring in more bugs, bring back EXISTING bugs and nerf all the fun out of the game. Why defend a shit company, friend? They don’t care about you haha
---
Yep. Some red roses like the ones from FO4 and some Hubflower would be nice.
---
Indoor planters would be nice for the veges too.  Obviously we're going to need a bigger CAMP budget for this cool stuff. ;-) 
---
Welcome to reddit... You could create a breakthrough cure for life threatening diseases and 99.99% of Reddit users will downvote it.
---
Look at them crying and trying to stir shit up here...
---
Why are you on this subreddit if you hate the game so much?
---
Again, who cares? Let the homie play the game, shit, someone’s gotta play it these days...
---
&gt; This guy deleted his main post
---
Not to rain on your parade, but that's not true. If you check the thread it's marked as "[removed]", meaning a mod removed it. If the user had deleted the post himself it would be marked "[deleted]".
---
I don't get it, I've definitely gone through that much ammo if not more, and I haven't duped anything. I've also not played nearly as long as that guy claims, maybe 300 hours.
---
Since I switched to a heavy weapons build, I've gone through several hundred thousand .50cal rounds.
---
Now, I also stopped playing right as they nerfed all the workshops. So, I don't know what has changed since then. I just follow this sub in hope that the game won't be a complete and utter disappointment.
---
Lucky hole cave = 400 lead, steel is everywhere.  I craft about 2000 5.56 per play and that's with ammosmith x3 and superduper x3. I only use the handmade in semi-auto but if you're using a machine gun, you'd burn through it faster.  I could see a mini gun or machine gun user needing to craft 3-4k per day, eale if they have the when day off and will be playing for hours.
---
Thanks for that. I always farm the one at whitespring but I get something around 10+.. so perhaps I will do my own nuke over Morgantown and see how much I can reap. Any ideas about violet flux too?
---
By that logic they must be robbers and murders too. Might as well be put to death cause they obviously broke real life laws
---
Perk loadout manager on PC is exactly this and it’s amazing. 10/10 wouldn’t play without it
---
Not fishing, just saying what one considers spam another might not..   
---
Honestly want to know if OP or Mods removed the post, in my mind that makes a huge difference
---
When I used a gatling gun I purchase close to 60k worth of ammo from several transactions within 4 days. Getting to 100k+ in 30 days isn't hard at all
---
I've seen him once, right after I hit lvl 50 at the Overseer's Camp, I couldn't believe it.
---
Couldn’t agree more. This is one thing that’s rarely mentioned by the F76 haters. But the more you explore, the more scenes of breathtaking creativity and splendor you encounter. 
---
you actually found it? where?
---
Nah, just banned suits me fine. Also love to see their hypocritical tears.
---
We'll that's pretty lame.  I usually craft 2000 5.56 a play for the handmade semi-auto but just got a mini gun double-shot and was thinking about trying that out.  I use ammosmi x3 and super duper x3 to craft a bunch as well.
---
And now everyone is crying about being banned for crafting ammo, you don't get banned for crafting
---
How tf do you know they're illicit goods ? I call bullshit big time. Please find me someone that said "selling duplicated items, have 15000 TSE guns". If you have super duper perk and ammosmith it's easy af to craft hundreds of thousands of rounds. 
---
Anyone who's traded a decent amount of r/market76 is probably going to have whatever you're calling "high quality illicit goods." I have plenty and I've never duped. I traded for them and intend to trade them for other stuff I want. That's kind of how the in-game economy works
---
Good lawd, you have the Bethesda police force and now you have to deal with the heavies on the bloody reddit? Lmao its getting harder to enjoy this game all round. This kid didn't do anything wrong. 
---
I saw that post. I still sonn't think it shows regular ammo as "rare".
---
Ultracite is definitely rare ammo and while there were some more normal rounds in there, I'm pretty sure they were just part of the overall massive amounts he had altogether. He had something like 500-600k rounds of ammo. I just don't see them banning someone for having lots of a single, high crafting ammo type.
---
The best place to farm violet flux is in the north of the Cranberry Bog.  Drop your nuke directly on "Mac's Farm," and there's a load of areas around there where you can farm violet flux. The garden behind The General's Steakhouse is the most obvious location, but there's lots of mutated ferns and pitcher plants you can harvest in that area too. 
---
There's not too many enemy spawn points there, though, so it's probably a good idea to make sure you already have plenty of hardened masses and whatnot in your stash before you do so, for crafting purposes. 
---
Is there a point to gather 5 chameleon part?
---
Thanks for going all Punisher on him and give the little guys a little payback. 
---
Everyone i know who dupes has multiple accounts so it really hardly effected them. They might have lost a couple things probably but they still have the majority. I dont think its them whos doing the crying
---
Yeah nicely put
---
Like I said earlier, she never gave any proof of her innocence other than a convenient story. Bethesda has provided proof every time these ban waves have come about proving all these people false. Believe what you want, but don’t believe a word any of these people say without evidence.
---
how did this picture get obtained in the first place? how do we know its him?
---
I just explained why I understand the distrust but when thousand of players got banned, including a few causal, like 90% of the traders, .50cal &amp; minigun users, etc. there must went something wrong. I wouldn't wonder if they even accidently banned some of their employees who just play the game.
---
I guarantee you it's an organized effort. Most of the people shitting on this game refused to actually give it a chance, treating it as an affront to god or some shit simply because it was an experimental game. 
---
I get that when my controller batteries get low (on PC using XB1 Bluetooth controller). New batteries resolves it.
---
Because he went over 100k bullets which is easy to do when farming nuke zones for mats and using super duper and ammo Smith. Also, you find fucking tons of ammo on everything. Also, he used two separate characters. It's not hard to get 100k ammo. This witch hunt is insane. 
---
... the fact that you think it’s childish to respond to a 12 hour old message... yeah. I’m just going to leave that there.
---
Also it’s pretty obvious Bethesda fucked up a LOT of design things. Believing that it’s a GOOD thing with the current game design of weapons and armor to force people to fight in the nuke zone is.. heh. Yeah. 
---
So an entire class of weapons should either be unusable or make you extremely vulnerable (fist weapons)? And I ask that as someone who doesn’t even use them. 
---
Before they “fix” queen pathing (which I’m not against, but see following) they need to redesign a lot of things with weapons, armor, perks.... 
---
It’s becoming tough to manage my photo captures. Seems like I reach the max limit at least once a week after a massive round of deleting. 
---
Thank you based code merchant
---
Nice use of the rugs to cover up the corner's that you couldn't put flooring under.
---
I hope they will all get caught eventually.
---
I'm pretty sure having mule accounts is a form of cheating. You are bypassing personal storage system by in a sense, doubling or tripling your storage capacity with the alt accounts.
---
I feel bad for the people that don’t deserve it but if you have been duping then I guess you deserve it 
---
They would end up in my generator shed that has no doors or windows if they tried to fast travel to my camp. I learned that tonight when the person (who I met on reddit) I had fun adventuring with fast traveled to my place. Had to take a wall down to let him out. Lol. I unintentionally created a fast travel trap. 
---
He still kindly replaced my medium generator with a fusion generator. Better to be trapped with a cleaner burning generator I suppose. :-) 
---
They deserve it, be sure of it.
---
From your post history you state you play with people who have used the duping glitch. It's possible you were banned along with them, or that you've held vast quantities of items for them at some point. 
---
I don't. Stop on by, we'll do some Jet.
---
It's unlikely he ended up flagged because of the "normal" ammo, that shit is easy enough to spam since all it requires is the steel, lead and gunpowder.  It's more likely they just tossed that all in on his mule as an extra "yea, we know you were duping all of this too" on top of the ACTUAL rare item that got him flagged, the ridiculous amount of ultracite ammo.
---
Thanks again. Got lot of farming to do for that Jetpack. 
---
I just don’t think it’s that deep that everyone needs to attack every single post lol
---
I PvP and have over 100 bulk springs from killing players. I don't farm sugar grove anymore. I farm players
---
Seriously doubt they will even come close. And your discontent for them just keeps them pushing on. So stay salty my friend because i like the deals they give for high end guns that are otherwise unattainable
---
Yeah I got down voted for calling him out too, this subreddit is so bipolar a lot of the time. 
---
Go look at more feet porn, weirdo. 
---
Heh, yeah i wonder who's salty and who's gonna be....
---
I didn’t dupe and I was banned though 🤷🏻‍♂️ I just spend most of my free time farming in the game for end game gear so I very possibly did handle 100k I’d rate items in a month, I’m 550 hrs into the damn game do they expect me to be looking for wood scrap?
---
So presumably this guy would have had a full set and therefore a 75% damage reduction while standing still?
---
Upvote the fuck outta this. Lolz.
---
Dude that's so rough to hear.  I remember when I fell in love with Bethesda.  June of 2002.  I was going through some long-term medical stuff (yay Crohns) and finally gave into the inevitable and moved back in with the parents in their house in the middle of friggin nowhere (the type of rural where you have to travel to see your nearest neighbor).
---
Being a city boy at heart, it was incredibly difficult.
---
That's when a friend hooked me up with this little game called Morrowind.  I probably put in five hundred hours that summer while recovering.  And holy cow did I love that game.
---
I can't imagine that same experience but having it totally devastated the way that seems to be happening to you.  That really sucks my man.
---
If you want to look to get into games like Conan Exiles or 7 Days To Die, send me a PM.
---
Hope your 76 situation gets FIXED really soon.  Best of luck.
---
Over level 50, having duplicates is kind of nice, because you can swap in cards.
---
Bethesda and anti-dupers have been salty since day 1. That’s undeniable
---
i don't defend them more than they deserved. I just think that, when they are doing something fine, you can't blame them.   
---
I doubt it, unless they can somehow delete duped items. They're more concerned about people doing the duping than those who may have gotten a weapon from one, though.
---
Your history shows you defend dupers forever and have some high acidic posts.
---
Yeah... sure.   
---
I think every single person banned has received an email about the ban inside that email will have the explained reason of the ban.  
---
Of those banned, I am willing to bet 99% of those are cheaters.
---
"Please help, I am innocent and have been banned!"
---
Great write up!
---
Idk if they necessarily deserve it but they should expect it for sure
---
Use some common sense will you, when has cheating EVER been acceptable in a multiplayer environment?
---
The fact you think cheating is worth defending shows a lot about your integrity, you have almost definatly done some form of glitching or cheating that we see so many people get banned for, there is no other reason you would defend it.
---
I second on this. People are quite lazy with hiding this information. 
---
The guy who got caught and called out for lying and has now deleted his thread?
---
Yeah, that's a real strong case you got there. /s
---
Hahaha i can taste that salt from here
---
Yep. 
---
I've noticed a trend with the people who got banned:
---
1. Some eventually admit to actually duping or playing with people who have
---
2. Most are insanely active on the trading subs, usually selling vast amounts of weapons
---
3. Most of them have a heavily redacted post history. I'm talking about two year old accounts with consistent post patterns a month ago, but with big gaps in their current post times. Almost like, I dunno, they've deleted a bunch of posts.
---
If I had silver, I would give it.  This person highlighted all the toxicity of the dupers/cheaters.
---
Funny thing is he posted an image condemning himself, he admitted to having thousands of pure flux in just 1 month on ammo in some cases up to 8k flux worth of ammo
---
I have nearly 1100 hours but that shouldn't really matter since others with less than 100 hours got banned too.       
---
I stopped buying TSE when the nerf was announced, well except for hunting rifles :'D        
---
100k bullets for .50 or 5mm isn't uncommon. Thats why it shouldn't be on the same level as fusion cores for example. For both you'll need 100k+ for a ban.      
---
Halloween candy I did not got much over the 2 months at all but farmed Monster Mash after Launch. The comment you're refering to I just made as example of why halloween candy isn't rare. If they now ban for 100k halloween candy you'll get banned for just playing 1 hour a day, farming monster mash 2-3 times. That would be ridiculous but honestly wouldn't surprise me at all.      
---
If you're on PS4 feel free to browse all my mules when I'm unbanned :) I'm confident that I was banned for .50 standard ammo because nothing else I had just 50k+ of.
---
Banning people for something that is their fault is not cool. Take away the duped items, great! Fix the duplication bugs, perfect! Ban people who are using a legacy bug from the single player engine that this multiplayer game is built on, yikes...
---
Hello ! Im away from my ps4 but i asked my brother to start fo76 when he was feeding my dogs y-day. The error/Ban note should appear befoer main menu with play/character/ settings right?
---
I didn't even deny him, I just said that his excuse sucked. Apparently that's unreasonable?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/z/egr41mk
---
You understand the 100,00 ultracite was just on one of his accounts he had ammo on both and was actually banned  on both before the duping ban wave happened.  
---
he was banned for having 140,960 ultracite ammo on his main along with his secondary which had also got flagged because it had
---
150.825 -45 ammo
---
225.111-Ultracite ammo
---
72.809 5mm Ammo
---
55.949 55.6 ammo
---
This is all in just 1 month of playing the game! I mean that is 336.071 of just Ultracite which is harder to get and craft than the other ammo that he crafted all in 1 month. 
---
What? People would just lie? On the internet?
---
Oh shit sorry man, risread and just noticed you said VII. 
---
You cant even follow the rules of Reddit. Probably should get banned
---
suuure you didn't, *pats head*
---
I've gone back to FO4 until the (literal) fallout of all this blows over. I missed my 80s Mix mod and my Krupp arms factory setup. Now just to remove the XB1 settlement budget, and I can make some proper settlements this time instead of the stripped out and sterile ones of previous.
---
Use punctuation, you sound like a dumb, liar. You knew you had dupes and exploited, fuck outta here. Ban deserved. 
---
I know right? It’s unbelievable that someone would take advantage of anonymity to stir up trouble!
---
That's not as if the duper discovered that they were not playing the game the way it was mean to. They broke the rules knowing that fact, the ban response came lately but it was not a surprise.
---
I support this 👍
---
Heh they will rush to downvote you, looks like it's all they have time for, now that they can't  be in the game to exploit.
---
Also the area around the pumpkin house has a ton of corn which turns into cobalt flux
---
Run around in the excavator armor, +100 carry. I'm chronically encumbered because I love swapping between guns.  Feels like a shame you have to commit to 2 weapons and ditch the rest, when we have weapons like the Tesla rifle, broadsider, railway gun and others to try out.
---
People with a QUARTER OF A MILLION Ultracite ammo wondering why they've been given the boot... I can barely make 1000 of it without pulling my hair out. They deserve it. 
---
meh, keep failing, pathetic
---
The ban is temporary by the way. They will probably be unbanned tomorrow after maintenance. So enjoy your schadenfreude while it lasts.
---
Absolutely wrong. I've not accumulated crap in the last 30 days cause I haven't even played and I got a ban. I have no idea why I actually got banned. But I'm guessing since I was trading a lot and I did sell items for ammo instead of caps in very high amounts. But that was not in the last 30 days.
---
Don't have as much ammo as this guy but I do have quite a lot. If he's played 900 hours and used ammo as a currency I don't find it all that farfetched though.
---
LOL.  I have a 3 star rolling pin for ya...
---
Salty dupers, youtube fanbois with hater channels... yanno. normal reddit bullshit
---
😩
---
You just need to make a Mercenary Gang and go hunting griefers then ;) I would if I played RDR2
---
I spat out my drink. Lol.
---
Yeah, it's like a leave a bullet take a bullet box at the gas station.
---
Well, I'm happy to have helped. Happy farming to you! 
---
Of course you should give it a try :) Just keep the limit in mind, to make sure you don't get banned in error. But there should be nothing wrong about crafting 50-80k over 30 days for example. If you just started using it as main weapon then Bethesda probably fixed the ban script before you hit 100k.
---
It's not just on reddit. TBH, im tired of you people complaining that they're pissed about being banned for no reason. 
---
When I was new, I commented on a thread here, looking for people to play with. I got invited to a guy's discord community and it made the game so much more entertaining. They taught me the game, helped me and we continue to play together every night. 
---
Now the leader of that community is banned as of a couple of days ago. The guy is legit. Just knowing him, and seeing what's happening to him, infuriates me. There are definitely regular players caught up in this broken net. To assume most of these players are guilty, and try to e-sleuth them to prove that, is pathetic. Sorry, not sorry. 
---

... and there you have it.   Fact based information!
---
Bullets are different story, but its still very difficult to get up to 100k.
---
Nothing new. The community has always been like this.
---
All these issues of bans and liars is quite amusing. The main issue is how broken the game is, hence all this bullshit.  I quit weeks ago. Pointless sinking time into something so fundamentally broken 
---
He had in total crafted in just 1 month of playing 
---
140,960 ultracite ammo on his main along with his secondary which had also got flagged because it had
---
This is all in just 1 month of playing the game! I mean that is 336.071 of just Ultracite alone which is harder to get and craft than the other ammo that he crafted all in 1 month. in all, he has a total of 645.654 ammo including the Ultracite.  Also, that is an odd total to come out with and even if it has nothing to do with if he cheated or not
---
Bethesda said he had one hundred thousand of a rare item drop. I'm probably going to belive them over a guy on reddit saying "he did nothing wrong" 
---
You don't have to trade with people to get duped items. You can kill them and pick up duped items too or pick up times who got killed that duped. Not to mention he was not banned in the ban wave he got banned before the ban wave.  
---
It would be nice, if game would have some restricted areas, that will tell you that enemies are +10 LVL higher than you. Enter at your own risk.
---
I currently play 2nd time thru this game and it is not fun at all, when game story missions need you to go areas, where you have no business to be on your level, like giving Belly of the beast, when you are at LVL 30.
---
I know that you need to play and leveling up, but this design is also from daily quests too. So it would be nice that game will give you challenges, but not daily quest to near fissure site prime for lvl 30 players, but also no lvl 20000 players quest to places, where toughest enemies are like lvl 9
---
No worries dude, they look similar in-game as well actually. 
---
Shills be shilling all day every day.
---
banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy
---
I'm not talking about the duper, I'm talking about this reddit mod telling this kid off on THIS post for making fun of the duper, you misunderstood completely. 
---
Truly sad is how spineless and cowardly those who exploited are, trying to look innocent.
---
But why should they listed it then at all? They only listed 5 or 6 types of ammo, not all. But they do list standard ammo.      
---
That Ultracite is considered rare I can understand. But still .50 or 5mm ultracite are possible to farm (the mats) and craft with some dedication.    
---
Also Bethesda once put up halloween candies as 'rare' example. It's easy to get 1k per run, if you skilled 2k+ are possible too. If they now ban for 100k candies, you'll get banned for monster mashing a hour per day. Just 1 hour each day, 2-3 runs.
---
1 Ultracite makes 72 Ultracite 5.56 rounds.
---
150k ammo of it would have taken less than 2100 Ultracite.
---
Which, after 900 hours, and countless nukes, is probably quite easy. Especially with extractor armour that doubles ore collection.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4mGmDyOl0c says they get 85 ore per hour. (though they did admit to server hopping.) I think it was 35-40 without server hopping
---
Which makes the time needed to get that ammo at less than 25 hours of game time. (with server hopping) Or 60 hours without.
---
Is it not possible that someone who has played 900 hours may have dedicated 60 hours to collecting ultracite ore? Assuming nothing killed drops ultracite scrap that is...
---
Cap economy is just screwed by the duping.
---
Yeah right, fail
---
i'm not sure I would have banned player after deleting the duped items, to be honest.
---
It doesn't make that much difference whether you fight the SBQ in the nuke zone. Just another 30 seconds of walking and a more orange palette.
---
What is wrong with you? You know that by definition what you're talking about is witch hunting right? Literally taking superstitious beliefs about pretty much every ingame activity and somehow turning it into an accusation of cheating.
---
Guess what dude, it isn't "dedicated farming" to get a shit ton of ore, there's events that give you a shit ton, multiple vending machines and vendors that sell it, you can get in excavator armor and you grab 3-8x more ore per grab. All you need is acid and you can make enough steel and everything else you need in about 15 minutes. There's so many ore nodes that anyone who isn't an idiot can do exactly this.
---
This goes for just about everything you're saying. I've got a shit ton of caps, I've bought and sold and made a ton and have multiple characters that have been capped on caps.
---
Also, anyone who knows any outfit of value or plans or mods will buy it every time- why? 🤔 Because they know it's valuable, and with the limit on caps being so low, you buy these things so you're not maxed out. I buy the 10k signs and letters anytime I'm maxed out if I can't find anything else worth buying that's higher in demand.
---
You've got like a dozen activities that are perfectly normal that you're trying to link to cheating, simply because you don't know how to do those things well, or never saw the point in doing those things, or.. whatever.
---
Stop witch-hunting, you have no idea what you're talking about and you're just going to create more paranoid players that are going to go around making accusations based on this stupidity.
---
I’m actually planning a trip to The Greenbrier it seems their off season prices aren’t too bad. Is late March a good time to go weatherwise? And are places like Helvetia and Charleston close enough for daily side trips?

Damn, that's rough. Sorry about your luck.
---
I just woke up from a nap and have no idea why it's gone. Literally all I want is just to play fallout. 
---
Nah, i'm savouring the moment. You can take your advice and follow it.
---
Do you think 300+k of just ultracite is doable in 1 month with all the other ammo he had too that he made in 1 month? That is a total of 645.654 ammo in just 1 month which around half of that ammo is rare and takes an abundance of time-consuming things you must do just to get the supplies. 
---
Also I wish Bethesda would answer my ticket just to show how ridiculous it is. The only item they can say I had 100k+ of is .50 standard ammo. Would be funny if they listed my 10 nuka colas, around 20 stealthboys, 6 keycards, few hundred fluxes or ultracite scraps. Oh also had around 150 bobby pins... suspicious I guess. Dunno how much supply drops bit something between 40 and 50 I think.
---
Foreal like what’s the deeper issue here 
---
&gt;This witch hunt is insane. 
---
It's justified. Duping and other cheaters are killing the game 
---
Is there a way to see, how much time i have played Fallout 76. Or are all of these x numbers of hours estimates?
---
It's almost like it's not a single person with a single mindset but rather a group of people with lots of different ideas and mindsets. Like they can log in at different times and thread sentiment can shift from hour to hour. Weird...

Where did I say I hated the game?

People cheat for all kinds of reasons.

Literally every bit of evidence I put forth that these bans being incorrect was in my thread. Why did someone delete it?

True. I blindly pick stuff up as well. I don't have the curiosity nor the drive to look at the HUD before taking everything.  Luckily I haven't been hit yet.
---
The PR Marketing shills and fanbois are in extreme damage control mode with their "The cheaters are liars" "Don't believe the false positives" etc. A few of the big innocent ban posts have disappeared, and been replaced by a stickied shilling "megathread" with a few shill and fanboi posts in it. This subreddit is a disgrace. And it is against consumer protection regulations what is happening  here. This false narrative pushing shill controlled subreddit. By Reddits own rules it's not meant to be used for self promoting. There are rules about false and misleading marketing practices that deceive the consumer in most developed countries.
---
You can build your base next to enemies that drop acid. You can gather tons of items that create acid. You can capture the workbench in the North east part of the map and have 3 acid collectors going at once, which produces more acid in a few hours then you'll need in a week. Acid is not hard to come by.
---
I stick mine, based on type, in static containers at different areas (so it doesn't despawn as quickly) . So. 10mm, 38, shotgun shells and 308, I either stick in the cash register at the flat woods church, the overseers box at the overseers camp, or a suitcase in the sutton train station. The other types I dump in the suitcase inside the Watoga train station. 
---
I actually stick a lot of stuff in the Watoga suitcase, and I'm not the only one. Plans, basic legendaries, junk I cant be bothered to sell? All goes in the suitcase! The ice chest in front of the White Springs golf club is another hot spot for unwanted plans, ammo and legendaries. 
---
Because those were the only ammo he probably had in massive amounts and again, it wasn't just one ammo type that did it. It was the combined total of ALL the ammo he crafted in that month that did it. It was over half a million rounds.
---
And I doubt anyone is getting banned for Halloween candies. Until we see more reasons for bans, ie Bethesda specifically telling people they were banned for X reason, we have literally one post to go off of, and I believe that's mostly because of the hundreds of thousands ultracite rounds he had combined with the tens of thousands of other rounds.
---
We can't say Bethesda is banning people for hitting 100k .50 rounds of ammo because there's zero evidence pointing to that.

---
&gt; is it more likely that a group of cheaters organized together and decided to make tons of posts about wrongful banning
---
Yes it is, because that's exactly what happened with literally any online game with ban waves. Besides, they didn't "organize together". They were banned at the same time so of course they'll be complaining at roughly the same time. And once someone starts, others will follow.
---
True true but you and I both know rare guns can still be attained with luck or good trading and elbow grease lol 
---
AMEN
---
Did he seriously post that email himself?  Why? 
---
I mean... did he think it would exonerate himself somehow?  I'm trying to do the rough math right now to figure out how much crafting someone would have to do over the course of a month to have THAT MUCH ultracite ammo and the numbers are insane.  
---
Assuming a middle of the road yield ammo like 5.56's at 20 a pop even after factoring in Ammosmith and Super Duper I think that's still like 7000 crafts.  I've done the math further and it doesn't get any less insane from there when you factor in the required Flux and Ultracite Scrap needed for each of those 7000 ammo crafts.  The Flux itself requires gathering a Hardened Mass/Glowing Mass/High Radiation Fluids and 10 flux each... forgetting how long it would take to get that many nuke zone drops if it's even possible I think even with Green Thumb the flux alone would still require 27000 harvests which again I'm not even sure would be possible in the first place.  And that's not even factoring in the ultracite scrap you also need, which itself would require so much ore and acid.
---
If people are still going to try and make the argument that "It's just ammo, you can craft so much of that"... no... not when it's ULTRACITE ammo.
---
You don't understand what the word justified means. How is it just harassing and verbally abusing people who you suspect, not know, are cheating? You're taking a dumb random guess. Nothing justified about that. 
---
Truly brings a tear to my eye
---
Exactly the reason I was TELLING people to look at mine. All I want is for the game to succeed.
---
The UI and menus are still hot garbage! I get stuck in my inventory all the time, loading my pipboy and pause menu takes ages and I even lost a t-60 leg part in the Feed the People event because the menu screwed up and drop a piece of my power armor on the top of the list halfway through putting the catapults in the drop off and in true Fallout fashion it instantly disappeared! 
---
Enemies disappear all the time even seconds after I kill them and its normally the ones with decent loot on them. I can't claim half the workshops I want because I keep getting that enemies are nearby message. I take fall damage in power armor. 
---
This is just a small percentage of the problems I have had with 76. I'm trying so hard to have fun but when I finally get something that isn't garbage my game crashes, the server goes down or some kind of glitch happens that gives me the middle finger and all my happiness is tossed out the window.
---
That's not true, the limit is too low without duplication exploits too. 
---
You can get 1500+ caps per day easily. Just by playing a few hours. It takes around 2 weeks to solo farm 25k caps.     
---
Can you solo farm a bloodied explosive handmade within 2 weeks? A TSE hunting rifle? A quad explosive combat shotgun? A Sentinel Assassins full Set? Or a tattered field jacket, a 0.3% event reward?      
---
No? Well then may all those items actually would be worth 25k+.      
---
Some of those items were duped and that's the only reason you can buy them for caps at all...
---
Seems at least their customer service is working ok.
---
Just picking items off the floor can get you banned 🙄
---
coming from someone whos been waiting 28 days for a un-ban. i hope you get to play again soon. but i dont see it happening.It seems like the devs are trying to push an update and wont be unbanning until its pushed .Weird. even weirder is that they are adding to their terms of service. so read carefully 
---
Genius!
---
How is it floating? Is it on a single column..?
---
better pick up another game . its gonna be a while .(source) iv been banned since jan 23rd . no updated since they said they were doing their investigation on me which was suppose to be 10 days tops . that was 18 days ago. good luck .
---
Yeah, I don't farm acid. I get about 500/wk from normal play. And I don't capture workshops, the risk of PvP isn't worth losing a week's worth of junk that I make my living with in FO76 as a crafter.
---
FYI they didn't fuck the game. Duplicating items has very little impact on the game. They removed all duplicated items and are now working on patching the duplicate bug that allowed for it. So tell me exactly how they ruined the game? Or is all you do just insult people on the internet and bully them? 
---
Sure bro it's not like you opened some of those nukas for caps anyway. Hope you get unbanned soon. /s
---
For sure. It’s an unfair move. Personally, I think the only problem duping caused was server disconnects, that’s bullshit. But who cares if everyone gets a TSE gun through duped trades, when you think about it, that makes PvP more fair haha I haven’t duped, for the record. Online games are dangerous, man, sure you paid $60 for it, but it belongs to Bethesda. You’re renting it, until they ban you or shut off the servers.
---
That's crazy talk.
---
Sounds like they're trying to build up to a safe "shutting the game down because our players ruined it" PR tactic to me.... 
---
That’s because I pin things on it so when I tell people my /u is always open they get the opportunity to see the major suggestion posts I’ve made and then cross posted there. 
---
I wasn't banned but my friend IRL was and I know for a fact that he didn't duplicate anything considering I played with him. 
---
Political troll attacks on a non-political game. Well, as much as FO76 is non-political, really.
---
Good way to refresh their troll skills, most likely.
---
The 900 hours guy. After reading the stuff that came out how he had something like 200k ultracite ammo I just laughed. 
---
I tried to find his post as it was at like 5k upvotes till he removed it, it seems. Bethesda posted a response to his ban with information on the items he had duped or knowingly accepted. 
---
I hear ya thr!
---
you got banned legitly. It even happened before the ban wave.  dude, you had over 300k in just ultracite combined on your two accounts for just 1 month. That is not even taking account of the other ammo you had with a total on both accounts for just 1 month as 645.654 in just ammo along with the fact ultracit is kind of rare and takes way more time to gather and craft. If that is all legit ok but I truly do not believe that is legit also considering you were banned before the ban wave took effect.  Also, that total 654.645 of total ammo is an odd number even if it has nothing to do with you being banned or not just funny how it came out that way.
---
I opened a few yea. I left enough on my character to max out my weight. On a new character that isn't many at all. But the point I'm making is I'm banned for items that are no longer in existence 🙊

People cry enough about melee being "op" this would sadly never happen :(

Btw//FYI

All the posts about being banned are getting removed, like the op gets replaced text with -removed-

I find this in itself questionable. How can we hold a discussion about these bannings if the op content keeps getting chopped out ?

Indeed, I have 8 different profiles set up for everything from adventuring, shotgun build, crafting, power crafting etc. Good stuff, quick and useful!

And yet mob mentality is very popular.

&gt;To date, the majority of accounts that have been turned off are accounts that have managed to collect over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions) of **specific rare items (for example, Halloween Candy, Nuka-Colas, or Ultracite Scrap)** inside of a 30-day period.

It's about the ban-wave before that one. But it seems they used the same script, just reduced 500k to 100k. May there comes a 50k+ ban wave soon. Then we'll see who's left...
---
Buzzwords - the post.
---
But they capped the absolute max weight limit, so how could you have picked that many up?
---
I wrote up that info because I couldn't play. As I stated so many times, literally all I do is play 76. I only did the initial write up because I couldn't access the game. And I never used that as an alibi or excuse to being banned.
---
In fact every single bit of evidence I put forward in my thread is factual. I didn't delete it, why would I? In fact before being such a judgmental ass, look through my post history. My account is 5+ years old and I never started posting anything until fallout 76. Think for one fucking second that some people actually like the fucking game. Thank you for keep my screenshot alive. 
---
How is this linked to the guy with 900 hours?
---
So, nothing seemed fishy about 100k nukas? 
---
gone through mine yet? You'll find someone actually passionate about fallout 76.
---
Yep, psychology is a crazy thing, but lets understand the difference between mob mentality and referring to reddit like it's one person.
---
This new Bethesda account is on the same hardware as your main? Because they can (and do) associate accounts and may ban both if they ever get around to banning the one breaking ToS.
---
Ultracite are very rare outside of nuke zones (and remains rare inside of one), and you need ultracite AND pure fluxes to make any ultracite ammo type. Still calling bullshit to have 360k ultracite ammo of any type.
---
This is before that patch 
---
I did a take all on some nuka quantum, but if I remember right it was about 15000 of them, and I accidentally disconnected myself trying to take a photo of the suitcase screen I found it in to send to a friend (I was on my phone’s hotspot and the camera was being a pos so I went to restart the phone and then face palmed).

It wasn’t hundreds of thousands, someone had just offloaded / donated some around graft on station suitcase. That’s the most of anything I’ve ever encountered. I did gain the benefit of nuka quantum to heal myself in battle because I kept several hundred and donated 12 packs to many containers from then on till I was out. As I could only keep a few hundred anyway most of it went back into the similar suitcase after I got logged back in to a new server after the phone rebooted. 
---
I realize you said that before.  But I bought one at Watoga and scrapped it.  Did not learn,  bought two more, scrapped, did not learn them.  There was one left in vendor I bought and put in stash.   My int was 18 on the last two and 14 on the first.   
---
I was new to the game as I said (my first fallout game too)

---
You have been **banned** from Fallout.
---
heh, I enjoy this quite a lot, please continue
---
maybe they nixed the learn chance in the last patch?
---
This is why having my original thread still active is important.
---
I go into long detail as to why I think the system says I have such high amounts of ammo. Because I do not.
---
It’s something they use with a bloody-build.... it keeps their health low..... I don’t really understand the specifics...
---
You play with him everytime he plays? 
---
Thanks so much. Dropping all other holotapes worked!
---
I wonders if the people believing and fueling their stories are just normal users or a bunch of drama queens.
---
Ultracite junk itself isn't rare and that hard to get, but the flux to create the ammo does require more effort. Much easier to trade for or loot off of players.
---
I mean he accumulated a total of 645.654 of ammo in 1 month and 333.071k of that is of  untracite ammo which is rare and takes a lot of time-consuming things you use do to harvest and craft that kind of ammo. I really don;t see someone doing all that in one month time unless they were duping. 
---
where does it say its associated with the 900 hours guy?
---
Its a story i hear all too often . sadly . the only people left are the ones that defend Bethesda at every turn. but its okay. those guys are seeing the ban hammer now too. 
---
FO76 sub brigaded by FO76 players? 🤔🤔
---
Ok, cool... I just think maybe glorf’s should’ve been left alone but ok, I’ll trust overseer wisdom.

---
At least we see who's coming out of the woodwork to cry innocent. Too bad it will not last...
---
Yeh it's pretty simple, you log out and log in and your ammo doubles, "cry on Reddit, I got banned for crafting".
---
If you were passed a ridiculous amount of items it makes sense you were banned. How are Bethesda supposed to determine whether you're a dupers mule or not? Also youd have to be pretty naive to not be a least suspect of that amount of free shit. I get people are pissed off about it but the temp ban makes sense.
---
 I'm pretty lucky I found a huuuuge amount of duped stuff on my alt in the flatwoods overseer's stash but it wouldn't even let me take 1 thing as the box contents were over the 1500lb limit. I would have so raided that box if I could and inevitably been banned today. I would have been pissed off but I also have brain power to realise how I was complicit and took my temp ban like a big boy.
---
Would be well deserved. I mean it is not like you found a brown bag and had no idea of duping. You were clearly aware of duping, you were aware of their junk being illegal, so yeah. 
---
But now there are some reddit overlords saying he's innocent because apparently he didn't sleep or take break to spend all the times he has crafting all that ammo legitimately. It is amazing. 
---
I used to hunt dupers, and thus have a lot of junk, then found my account suspended yesterday. Wouldn't mind saying goodbye to all the junk...
---
Unarmed weapons dont work in Power armour, I would say drawing her out of nuke zone makes big difference 
---
But who was camera? Seriously, did he post this message himself or did someone grab it from the open-source customer service?
---
Oh wow he made ammo in a video game.
---
They wiped duped items, except one of each.
---
Bethesda couldn't even update their game properly and managed to undo an entire patch due to an apparent scripting error that is *still* to be fixed.
---
But an automated script to find and ban people. Well obviously they aren't going to mess that up, and everybody it finds is going to be 100% guilty.
---
Quite comical really, a game trying to push as online only and struggling to get and keep players is blanket suspending/banning paying the customers who took the chance and played "correctly". Great business model, piss off customers already pissed off, and lose future business.
---
They did screw with the bos mods so anything is possible if we are talking the same things.  Interested in seeing what changes happen with the 2/19 maintenance and updates. 
---
Yea and the character was deleted before that;-) this is my point exactly. They aren't even checking if you kept the items. In my case I deleted a whole character
---
Pulled up your deleted comments. You have mule accounts, use macros, and leveled a charecter with just grenades. Seems pretty clear.
---
Awwww. Now you have to find a different shitty game to play and cheat in.
---
I as others have seen the email you got to why you were banned. Not only that you got banned before the whole ban wave of duping happened and changed your whole thing from 99999999-hour guy to 900 hours. Explain why you come here to try to make it out that the ban wave mistakenly banned you when you got banned before that happened? 
---
Stupid lil kids lol.
---
But don't worry, it's the same as every game. You always got a 12 years old crying baby in every game and server how's raging when you kill them. And 70% call you a cheater or hacker when you one hit them. 
---
I thought they were just removing the items instead of banning.
---
&gt; He deleted the thread 
---
False, the thread was removed, not deleted.
---
It is GTA Online for me all over again. Damn it.
---
They removed all items except 1 for stacks of specific duped items. This didn't effect Me as by that point I got rid of mine. After that though they gave temp bans to people who got over 100k items in 30 days 
---
If a player is sneaking they don't show up on the map. Did you own a workshop at the time? If you own a shop you are flagged for PvP in the entire map for you and anyone you are grouped with. If you did then a player can be in sneak with  chameleon and just keep shooting you every time you spawn.
---
Feel for bad for accidentally banned people
---
I believe it is possible if he bought flux and ultracite on reddit's market.
---
Thanks! This was even dumber than retrieving DNA on a sorched by pressing space... 
---

Sorry it took a week.
---
My base is just north of Alpha. My character icon is standing exactly on the missile Silo lid. 
---
amen to that (banned 28 days now)
---
My best guess, a Super Mutant spawned into a wall or into the ground.  They can still shoot but you can't see them.  If you can pinpoint the location, you can try tossing a Plasma Grenade.  Sometimes it kills them, sometimes it forces them into sight, sometimes it just doesn't work.
---
I think you are giving BGS way too much credit.
---
Did you spend 400 hours farming flux and lead to make 100+ Ultracite ammo too?
---
I'm looking at an archived version of the thread and still not seeing that image anywhere.
---
I've never seen a cheater so dedicated to defending his bullshit before
---
It was removed before I even woke up, but that post was edited and re-edited and edits were removed all over the place - according to the comments - so I'm waiting for the mod who removed it to wake up so I can ask why before I re-approve it.
---
...is that a social interaction? 
---
My garb also disappeared and I am stuck unable to craft a new one! No idea what happened but I am devastated. I thought that the fabricator issued a new one if destroyed or lost, but no dice. 
---
&gt;Its not a issue of going through all that ammo. Its about crafting all that ammo in 1 month and considering what it takes just to craft the ultracite needed to have over 300k in just 1 month. 
---
Does not work, the menus are played out and it offers no options for crafting. Seems like a glitch/simple fix to me but I'm devastated right now.
---
Haha deserved imo
---
Not sure if it exists for other plans but the power plant workshops are the only ones that give the various generator plans so, at the least, there is some specificity to it.
---
Announced is a strong word, as 2 days before FO76 came out, I saw an unboxing of the PA edition from someone who got it early, and was  very dissapointed that the bag was not canvas.
---
I then went to my local game store website, and checked the advertising, and it was still saying Canvas Bag. 
---
So... when *exactly* was it announced? Because the tweets about it from Bethesda i can find were from quite some time *after* the launch and people had their game and already complained.
---
So, yeah, why would they lie? Why wouldn't they? Thus far, it has been SOP.
---
&gt; Anyone who passed the threshold of 100k rounds, banned.
---
That's not how it works, stay mad though.
---
I'm sure people will spend a ton of money just to get one guy before they're banned.
---
Last time I played GTA Online it was clear it's become a Pay to Win game.  But i do remember when there were so many exploits for getting money, infinite health, infinite ammo(no reloads.)  Also remember in that game killing someone that was marked as having a bounty and I received 8 billion dollars in the game.  I actually thought it was a glitch in the text or something so I logged out and then back in but nope, 8 billion dollars in my characters bank, so I went on a shopping spree, most expensive condo, cars ect.  This was way before you could buy jets and tanks though.
---
It is not even permanent ban lol. Just go outside or play something else for a few days then comes back. 
---
So.... Banning actual dupers is a bad thing because they didn't fix the dupe before launch is what you're trying to say?
---
That's just the state this sub reddit is in at the moment :) 
---
I used to be an adventurer like you, but...
---
Someone did a rough estimate--on another post, 
---
I mean... did he think it would exonerate himself somehow? I'm trying to do the rough math right now to figure out how much crafting someone would have to do over the course of a month to have THAT MUCH ultracite ammo and the numbers are insane.
---
Assuming a middle of the road yield ammo like 5.56's at 20 a pop even after factoring in Ammosmith and Super Duper I think that's still like 7000 crafts. I've done the math further and it doesn't get any less insane from there when you factor in the required Flux and Ultracite Scrap needed for each of those 7000 ammo crafts. The Flux itself requires gathering a Hardened Mass/Glowing Mass/High Radiation Fluids and 10 flux each... forgetting how long it would take to get that many nuke zone drops if it's even possible I think even with Green Thumb the flux alone would still require 27000 harvests which again I'm not even sure would be possible in the first place. And that's not even factoring in the ultracite scrap you also need, which itself would require so much ore and acid.
---
He had a total of over half a mil of ammo including 333.071k of just ultracite ammo it's self. The total is 645.654k ammo total in just 1 month. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** Truffleshuffle03! ^(hug)
---
Occam's razor would suggest Bethesda, who have been bumbling idiots about everything with 76, made the mistake.
---
Why not both?
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah, how fucking common sense is this? 🤔 My friends needed Violet flux for his calibrated legs I think, it's a little more rare than the others- but every time you do a queen fight you get 2 of almost every flux.. I think he ended up paying 50 caps each?
---
This isn't fucking rocket science people. I could gather enough to craft 100k 5mm ammo in about 15 minutes, go sell that ammo for 30-50k pretty easily- how much flux could I afford with this?
---
Smarter yet, the flux weighs close to a pound each? Even if you don't use the ammo, it's super easy to get ultracite and once you turn it into ammo it weighs virtually nothing, literally nothing if you have the right perks or armor.
---
So why store flux if you're running out of stash space, craft it to sell or use later. If I don't use it a while, move it to another character.
---
Also, I call bullshit that if someone is *actually duping*, that what they dupe is **fucking ammo** of all fucking things. Fucking common sense people, not rocket science!
---
Its a witch hunt! bethesda is colluding with Russia. They get their intel from Putin!
---
I am not sure how complete this is, but someone kindly linked it to me a few weeks back when I asked the same:

We can all pretend shit buckets don't exist... But I mean come on
---
Census violence is a good one to do for rare plans
---
Man I remember every now and then one of those cheaters would give everyone in the lobby a fuck ton of money so if they spend all that, a lot of them would get banned and went on the forum to cry about it. Much like the dupers in this game dropping stuff for people to pick up. Uhhh...online games. 
---
😂
---
I thought Excavator armor didn't work on ultracite nodes. 
---
At least the looting message didn't show it giving me more than one ore per node the last time I went for ultracite.
---
Although this was back in the first or 2nd month of the game and it may have been bugged at that time.
---
Yeah. Banning is unfair because of a bug Bethesda failed to iron out in QA testing. Take away their items, fix the bug. Done. Banning is unnecessary.
---
Probably a wall or cliff spawn so it still counts as an enely in the area but they cant get at you as they are either way above or below or embedded in a goddam rock lol. Spamming grenades around sometines will help to pinpoint where the fucker is hiding 
---
Leave that to the Indy games.
---
Hahahahahaaugh *sob* kill me
---
The one thing that still seems fucked, if all of what you say is true, is that people buy stuff from other people. I get the obvious shit - buying a TSE shotgun or w/e - we should be able to tell that it’s not legit by the seller’s inventory or other markers. 
---
But buying extra mats for caps to make ammo from multiple peeps to complement what you make already so can focus on legendaries, etc could be legit. I really don’t know if that’s the case here, but it makes me feel like Beth has some of the responsibility for fucking the market up so much that you should worry about buying even flux or ultracite ammo.
---
Again not saying I know about this case but fuck, you basically can’t know for sure about *anything* that’s for sale if it’s duped at this point.
---
I think they were already salty which is why they went and got bounties. Lol. These people. These sad people in our game worlds. We need to give them hugs. The hugs... of bounty collection. LOL. they need love. But they don’t know it. Knowing that you don’t know is the definitions of smart. Them do not know. Thus, I sad. 
---
Not when u know how to counter it. They become standing targets lol. Criticals  ignore all the damage mitigation perks. Melee with stagger or heavy weapons. Although it felt like that when people first started using it.
---
the 900 hours guy was banned for too much ammo. 
---
Sure, some was ultracite ammo, but considering you get 72 ammo for each ultracite used (assuming super duper doesn't kick in i guess)... having 150000 isn't outside the realm of possibility, especially considering he played for over 900 hours.
---
Yeah I know. It's a bunch of fun though 
---
Out of curiosity, are the banned players removed from your friends list?
---
First time here on reddit dot com?
---
Definitely progress but the mechanics to dupe are still in game. Anyone else noticed slightly more disconnects since the patch?
---
Proof that we are in a simulation!
---
Just to be clear, any 1  item, 100k or more, picked up in paper bag get you banned.
---
Just like in real life, you pick up items of significant value, (cash, drugs) you run the risk of it being contraband, and you’re gambling with an outcome.
---
Don’t make your statement sound innocent or innocuous.
---
no :) bethesda just suspends account and doesn't delete them
---
Then can I say: quit your bullshit? Literally this post is showing ammo is what the guy got banned over, fucking ammo. I'm not sure I believe the screenshot in the first place but let me ask you: who the fuck would dupe **ammo**? I don't give a shit if it's ultracite ammo, if they're going to have duped anything, there's going to be *something besides fucking ammo*.
---
You can farm absurd amounts of ultracite, you can buy a variety of pure flux for 25-50 caps each, there's **no reason someone would dupe ammo if they know how to play the game**.
---
This is a guy who explained at great depth that he knows how to play the game, he gave exact routes he takes, where he gets ore for crafting ammo.. literally he proved beyond any doubt that he wouldn't need to **dupe ammo**.
---
So is this common sense enough? Is this quit your bullshit enough? Or are you going to let users dox another user because Bethesda wrongly labeled them a duper over **fucking ammo**.
---
If you don't remove this post I'll report this to the admins myself, this is definitely doxxing and definitely a witch hunt, and you should be ashamed of yourself for letting you go on, worse for not seeing the common sense of **ammo not being ban worthy of a guy who explained how easy it is to get, in great detail**.
---
Bethesda pretty much killed the game themselves. Dupers suck, but they aren't the reason behind the countless flaws in the game.
---
I lived in places where I haven't for sure. I do where I live now, but in real life we don't have people who can use guns to destroy your whole house just because they couldn't get in the door. In 76 there's no point in locking your door because there's nothing to steal and mobs can spawn inside anyway.
---
How could he send you a message?  
---
So far I could not find a way to do that and thas actually the biggest downpoint of this game...relying on spoken area communication in a serversystem that is not country/region based.
---
sentinel gives 15% reduced damaged while standing, and assasin does 8% from players.
---
So 75% + 40% = 115% reduced damage. Basically a wall. 
---
Yes, it does seem broken. However, many players found counters around it. Critical hits ignores all these reduced damage perks. So a strong 1 shot weapon can always sweep them from under their feet.
---
People use stagger perks, that do little knock back, so the sentinel gets deactivated with the push.
---
Heh, I have experienced this on other game subs, but this is starting to be a one of the worst cases of sub PvP.
---
I just think we deserve better.
---
I got collection of 400 weapons and over 250  armor but i dont have mule and i dont dupe, thats why i trade aae handmades, bloodied vats crit lever rifles etc. Pls stop lying you 100% had something with duping
---
Didn't the e-mail that was sent out specifically state that the 100k items in 30 days were rare or hard to get items (ie, nukas, orbitals, flux, TSE weapons ect) is what they looked for and if thats what they found that was the cause of the ban hammer.  Super duper with ammo smith would not cause the flag for banning according to their own e-mail.  I've seen people drop stacks of over 100k nuka grapes before the weight limit in world boxes was fixed.  The last hotfix reduced alot of the duped items in the tens to hundred thousands down to 1, now they must have written some kind of code that banned those players who had the excess nukas or bulk or whatever.  At least thats my dumbed down understanding of the bans.
---
Nice! Great job on this build! I’m running something similar and came looking for more insight. You helped this Vault Dweller! 
---
Select transfer and select the highlighted password reminder in the safe under the filing cabinet. 
---
Youu....you got a weapon? All I ever gotten is all these armor pieces I'll never use because I'm a PA main. 
---
People abusing an obviously game-breaking exploit is definitely a bannable offense.
---
Ammosmith can be level 3? I saw only two stars and thought it’s a max.
---
Youuu mother fucker. I hope you don't get unbanned you lying pos
---
I had a situation like that. It sounds just like the dude my friends and I encountered at whitesprings just after we set off a nuke there. There were a handful of low levels we decided to help out since they were rank between 10-15. and we were all fairly higher ranks.  
---
While we were killing some of the glowing dudes inside a building we noticed a lot of the lower rank guys were dying and it ended up being from a dude hiding on top of the building we were in while his lower level friends would attack them first and when they attacked back the 40 rank dude would kill them. 
---
He was about rank 40 and his lower rank friends were about 20 I think and once their friend would finish off the lower rank guys they would loot what they dropped.  They made a mistake and tried it on us too but we had a lot better weapons and stuff. They just kept coming at us the entire time during the nuke and were following us the entire time. They would wait till we were attacking something like a herd of glowing ones but as soon as they attacked we would just insta kill them. We all had a really powerful shotgun. Finally, they figured out after us killing them like 20 times they could not do anything we then got a bunch of nasty messages and they left the server. 
---
Come to think of it, ever since I switched to PA main I have had a stalkers cane. 
---
Robot arms though. Let me tell you about Kali-Mass v0.2
---
Going to delete this because all of the toxity. But as soon as Bethesda starts replying to tickets some 100k standard ammo ban posts will pop up.
---
Does that make them commies or trumpettes?
---
Game’s already broken, people duping TSE’s and trading them ironically makes PvP more fair lol
---
Lolz
---
I think the problem is that Bethesda hasn’t said jack shit about it’s script or data collection methods. 
---
As far as we know, if you make 10k ammo, drop it in a bag and pick it back up, that’s acquiring 10k more ammo for a total of 20k counted towards the month.
---
Legendary weapons trigger their stat display thing when you loot em from a mob *and* when you take em out of your stash or a dropped bag.
---
The totals that they emailed to him are not what he had on him but the number their system says he “acquired.” So that shit was not in his bank. He used mules to move stuff so it might show up as acquired multiple times - once when crafted or traded for another time when the mule got it.
---
So fuck, I don’t know what exactly happened here but I’m also far from confident that Bethesda’s methods are fair.
---
As for daily vendor run, I equip the perks that reduces shotgun and heavy gun weights by 90% then I proceed to farm mole miners in Blackwater. Really efficient, they drop a tons of shotguns and missile launcher and they only weight 1 to 2 pounds each and sells for 15+ 
---
I will be honest. I made an ultracite weapon when I first got ultracite, and it was shite compared to other weapons I had.
---
So... I never bothered to harvest any more ore even when I got excavator armour, so... not sure. I said it gives extra ore, because that's what the item says about wearing both arms. 
---
though, have mined ore in excavator armour and only got 1 iron ore at a time, so I thought it may be either broken, or that you only get 1 per pickup but more pickups or something.
---
Sorry for stating something I wasn't 100% sure about. I forgot we were talking about FO76, where what we are told isn't what actually happens.
---
I got band, with drum and geetar and banjo and cello and piano
---
Did you never dupe ammo? How did you come by so much of it? I got banned too, and I have been naughty, but.....I never had lots of any stacked item, just like 20 tse weps.
---
That is not the workshops though, it is the "Power Up" events.
---
I don't remember anyone getting banned for the money hack/glitch or whatever it was mainly because it was so widespread and out of control on Xbox Rockstar was basically like "Fuck it, roll back everybody's money to 500k and remove the glitch/hack."
---
We must not forget about radioactive fluids. They also need to be in an inventory for crafting.
---
Two common sense points for you. The first one, I don't have any ultracite receivers on any of my weapons, but I have a ton of ultracite ammo- care to guess why? 🤔
---
Flux weighs close to a pound, ammo weighs nearly nothing, and with my perks it weighs literally nothing- if I don't need the flux, why shouldn't I turn it into whatever kind I know other players need? 🤔 It takes up no space or weight or has any negative impact on my character at all as long as I keep it on me.
---
Secondly, you can buy flux dirt cheap, why? 🤔 Because unless you need that shit, it weighs a **pound each**, so selling it makes more sense than storing it if you don't need it. You also get 2 of most kinds of pure flux after every queen fight, and it adds up fast.
---
Lastly, this is the guy who wrote up a detailed guide that explains where he farms, what he farms for, and he included the materials and ore that you use to craft ammo.
---
Why the fuck would this guy need to dupe ammo if he's writing a guide that explains in detail how to craft it? Also, if he was going to dupe something, there would be something of value on that list *besides ammo*. You can claim they duped ammo *also*, but there is zero reason to dupe **ammo alone**, especially if you know how to play the game.
---
So please: explain how this makes any sense to you whatsoever? How is this guy duping ammo but nothing else, and *why would he dupe ammo*?
---
Lol the only people that back you about not duping anymore are the dupers that have been banned themselves. Move on bud, nobody cares about your crap
---
Because it sets a bad precedent. If you're going to bitch about the game and hurl pitchforks at bethesda, then it needs merit. Not some bullshit drummed up by some cheater who got rightfully banned for cheating. 
---
PS4 messages, not in game. He picked my gamertag and messaged me on the console.
---
Oops, yeah, you're right. Sorry. Brain fart.
---
I mean the way Bethesda is fucking all of the FO76 players from the start, I'm surprised people even stick around. 
---
Cant someone just shoot the floor and break it?
---
Of course this idiotic subreddit is taking inept Bethesda at their word.
---
It’s only 3.3k a day. It’s possible for heavy weapons ammo when you get 234 rounds on average per craft with 5mm and 50 cal. With 30 minutes I can farm enough lead and steel for 4K rounds (not ultracite tho).
---
Not hard to go through 2k rounds or so on queen run, way more at white springs.
---
link?
---
Harmless pranking is the best pranking 
---
May I ask what you're looking for in Lewisburg, R&amp;G stations (apart from selling stuff to vendors) and Pleasant Valley Ski Resort?
---
Not true. It wasn’t sitting on a character or in a stash. He simply “acquired” those totals over the 30 days. He was using them too. 
---
I don't need the TSE.  I don't need the Bloodied Explosive Handmade.
---
I have a normal crafted handmade at level 140 and I'm fine with that.  I get plenty of caps by getting them off the vendors.  
---
The limit supports the in-game prices on the vendors for the Serums and plans.  Its not supposed to support whatever the people want to charge outside the game.
---
Those items are supposed to be so rare, you would not sell them for caps anyway, but trade for other rare items.   The chance of getting a real TSE dropped is like 0.00006 percent chance.
---
The market is flooded with exploited items and now people complain they cannot get get enough caps for them?
---
Hey you, great post.
---
Happy cake day.
---
Upvoting your comment on that piece.
---
Ahhhh, I get it. I completely missed the small portion above where it says specifically the 140k ultracite ammo.
---
I play on 2016 and PC if there is a different procedure for PC. But if you have illegitimately money on you, you pretty much have two options. 
---
1: Leave it alone and wait for them to remove/rollback (Which could take weeks since they do it once at a time) 
---
2: Spend the money and risk getting banned. 
---
Maybe they got stricter and basically saying we won't let you get away for spending exploited money repeatedly. 
---
I work with software support. Can confirm.
---
I agree. But fuck dupers and cheaters. Their accounts should be permanent banned 
---
Lewisburg and R&amp;G - It is what I worked out as the shortest trip to visit all vendor types (Raider, free states, Responders etc)
---
Pleasant Valley Ski resort - visit the both vendors including the hidden one downstairs through the keycard zone
---
Happy for advice if you have a shorter run to visit all vendor types :)

If a player bought 100k ammo they would be suspended so its just the value that got them suspended
---
Come on now, is it not absurd that a guy got banned for crafting or buying the single most easy thing in the game to craft? Even if flux was expensive, say it was 100 caps each- you can buy 14 flux from other players with what you get from vendors alone, per day. It if you have max caps you could buy 250 flux at once.
---
It takes one flux to craft the ammo, you could buy the flux you need and craft an absurd amount, it simply craft it every time you do a queen fight to get the weight out of your inventory- it would add up fast.
---
Is this not common sense? Does this make any real sense to get banned over the easiest thing in the game to craft?!
---
You sure did. Remember that post.
---
That still doesn't excuse people duping in the game. So what should they do when they find dupers? Let them roam free and continue to dupe items until they have fixed the issue? Once the issue is fixed, will they get banned?
---
Thanks!
---
Ah! My mistake. You're correct. 
---
I imagine cuz it’s PJWing seems like it’s the hip thing to do. Everyone wants to feel elite and get a jab in on someone when they feel the rest of the masses will congratulate them for it. 
---
Thus the "and whatnot" in my statement. But yes, you're quite right. 
---
I don’t think he intentionally revealed his duping. But Bethesda had him with dirt. So he played victim card and chose the lesser of 2 evils. 
---
But you're active on the No Man Sky subreddit. Surely you have some optimism for this game to be turned around. 
---
Who said some would sell those? But they ACTUALLY worth 25k+. Just because **you can't farm them**. The only reason they're cheap is because others duped them.
---
And that 140k is just on 1 of the 2 accounts he had that got banned. his other account which also got banned had 255+k ultracite which is a total somewhere around 333k of just ultracite not including the other ammo types that he crafted. 
---
I’m not sure I understand. Are you saying because you played this game for a long time, you should not get banned? I really don’t get the reasoning.
---
Whether you like a game or not, in the end one question matters: Did you cheat? It’s a simple yes/no question.
---
That's why I posted this info. If the value alone is selective criteria and bugs as described above occur, some false positives may have occurred.
---
depending on the underlying infrastructure that tracks and analyzes modification of the inventory, it is possible to have a system that will not give false positives. [How?](/s) … Not saying they did, but if Bethesda has designed a "near perfect tracking and analyzing algorithm" then they can be confident in their claims against cheaters.
---
That this is considered obscure makes me feel very old...
---
You keep your junk on you? I can't remember the last time I had a workshop contested, and if you're a crafter it makes all the sense to constantly have a few captured any time you're online- it's free materials.
---
I don't lock anything so they have no reason to try to take it, I have everything fully built and open.. if someone tries to claim one and I'm remotely worried I would just hop servers rather than get into a pissing match, it only takes 5 minutes to claim and build everything you need and it doesn't use any of your materials.
---
I'm just saying, it's rare that anyone claims any in the first place, what do you have to lose?
---
Fwiw, I think the only ones upvoting wrongfully banned are the dupers.
---
Thats what happened to my buddy and I cant remeber what I did maybe picked up a pile of junk from a duper that died Idk lol
---
200k+ ultracite ammo. Do you really think some crazy guy will craft it all?
---
Do you realize how many resources you need to craft this?
---
Please read the TOS, all game companies reserve the right to block your access at any time for any reason, usually because you violated part of the Terms and Conditions.  Whether this game is good or bad does not matter in that context. 
---
So what?
---
Oh Bethesda tells you why you’re banned. You don’t have to share that out though if you’re guilty. 
---
Sorry. English isn't my native language
---
No Man's Sky showed surefire progress just three months after launch, not to mention the actually rapidly fixed the game breaking bugs in the month after launch.
---
This game is every bit the garbage fire it was on launch day. If an indie team can outdo Bethesda in this situation in a faster time frame, that actually only bolsters my position.
---
It’s a playable cartoon for children made by an incompetent developer, chill brother
---
I just started playing. I’m level 7 with about 6 hours of play - 5 disconnects and I lost everything I crafted in my camp when I moved it (no, nothing is in my storage either).
---
I knew it was a gamble to start playing; not sure how much longer I’ll last.
---
Maybe fix the bug and remove their items? They already showed they can do that.
---
I dunno, at my pace that I have been playing it’s fine. I’m 27 and have a work and family life. For the few hours I get to play every few days There is a ton left for me to do personally. I’m level 55 or so and still have maybe 40% of the map to see. I know that some other people are much more...dedicated in the hours that they play the game. But I would wager that those people are the minority. I don’t think you guys that marathoned through the game to get to the non existent endgame right away have no right to complain. You did it to yourself. More pve content is coming soon. 3 months or so after release is definitely not “way too many months” to wait for additional content.
---
Absolutely. I mean, if someone has done it once by mistake (unlikely, but they must have found out how to do it somehow, and accidents happen) and didn't do it again, or submitted a bug report, they should be fine.
---
Anyone who has done it more than once should be banned for sure. I should clarify I have never done it, not even the theoretical "once" I mention above, but we do have to accept while 99.9% of dupers did it intentionally, there will be the odd few players that stumbled upon it by mistake. And with the logs they use to catch dupers, those people should be safe with the system they have in place. 
---
Better late than never right?
---
oh yes, when the guy complains about being banned unfairly it's all so super serious, but when someone rebukes with basic logic that he might have been banned fairly it's suddenly just all trivial.
---
kind of petty to pick the last post in a long exchange of posts ad say "this was way too long" as if you didn't go through the choice of reading every single comment yourself.
---
what a bunch of hypocrisy.
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** Lrnbnn! ^(hug)
---
As soon as you are doing something not intended by the developer, to farm or gain an advantage it is considered exploiting and it is a violation of the ToS.
---
I've been following this story for a bit and it seems Bethesda is sending a very clear message.  Massive farming methods, glitching, duping, and mass crafting of items will not be tolerated like one may do in "other" online games.
---
Most of these people did not do nothing wrong, they exploited, massively farmed, or cheated in some fashion to move 100k plus items in 30 days and they got their just desserts and aren't happy about it.
---
If you didn't convict anyone who claimed they didn't commit murder, on the basis that they said it, there would be no murderers in prison.
---
We are not the judges or the jury, we aren't being given full information, and we aren't being given a defense as of yet by Bethesda. Ergo it is impossible for us to properly deem, with suitable accuracy, whether someone has or has not duped or cheated.
---
Bethesda has that information and is acting on it. If there are no suspicious items, as some people claim, then after said character is checked there will be nothing found, and the character will be returned with no items removed. They aren't permabanning players, they're suspending them until they remove said items. If there's nothing untoward, then nothing will be removed and the account will be put back online.
---
Yes, there may be false positives, but no, that doesn't mean everyone who appeals is innocent, and therefore we, with next-to-no details on the proper systems behind the "banhammer", cannot properly judge without making assumptions about who is innocent and who is not.
---
Why you waste your time in subreddit of toxic shitty game? You pervert? 
---
Good god thank you. I am of the same mind about that case, and know how easy it is to make absurd amounts of caps, flux and ammo. If you work hard to figure out the most efficient methods of things you’ll suddenly be swimming in ammo. It’s a joke.
---
Somebody suggested that you could do it using a vibrator.  I can think of better uses for a vibe myself.
---
Ultracite ammo is easy and cheap to make, I craft it every time I finish a queen fight just to get the weight of all the pure flux off my character. The ammo weighs zero with the perks I have, and I don't even use that ammo. I don't have a single weapon with an ultracite receiver.
---
So should I be banned for having a ton of ultracite ammo on me? It's there in case I ever need caps, throw it up on the market, instant profit with no negatives for simply keeping it on me..
---
Well, no negatives until Bethesda starts banning people for having ammo on them that's "rare" even though it's the most common and easiest thing in the game to craft, and it's a good way to get rid of unwanted flux if you don't need it.
---
Source of the picture though?  How do we know it was the 900 hour dudes? 
---
Hey can they block your acess on a game like fallout3? 
---
No one would care what you do with an offline game, don’t be obtuse. 
---
Ok what's the max weight you can put in a bag and pick up? 
---
Another spin of the "punish users for using a defective product" philosophical wheel. 
---
Leaving dev and test resource accessible in any way is a product unready for release (imagine if the console was enabled in error), but clearly the "fix product no punishments needed" engineering is too hard. GGez
---
I won't deny that. It's really feel like they are sticking to their planned schedule from release instead of pushing to fix all the bugs in a month or two. 
---
If there is a bug or design flaw you're responsible for, shouldn't you just remove the items or something rather than banning a customer?
---
"Exploiting a system issue" is so incredibly vague, you can blame anyone for anything using this expression.
---
What did you do ingame?
---
Well, as for pure vendor run I go to Sutton (Raider), Charleston (Responders), back to base (west of WS), WS bunker (Enclave+Technical Data from military wing), WS station (Whitespring), NAR Repair Yard and nearest train (for BoS and Marine plans), Watoga station (watoga vendor), Watoga superduper (BoS vendor Phoenix), Camp Venture (technical data dump), Harpers Ferry (Free states vendor), Crevasse Dam (trick-and-tread rare encounter possibility + 2 possible spawn for magazines) and back to CAMP.
---
Peach man. Tons of players on here don’t get how easily it would be to buy, make or sell shit tons of ammo. Someone said it was *hard* to make 1k 50 cal ammo. Someone else said ultracite itself is rare. There seems to be a big difference between people who *play* this game and those who have studied it.
---
How about you give us a valid source?  
---
This sub screams at people for reporting bugs and glitches to provide evidence.  Where is the evidence this is the 900 hour guys? 
---
They just need to get rid of player trading and drop bags.  It’s a great concept but when you have issues like this it makes for a grey area between the blatant cheater and the innocent sucker who picks up 500K rounds found in a bag or world box and thinks, nice I don’t have to worry about ammo for a bit.  It would be nice to believe that everyone banned deserved it but I doubt that is the case.  If they treated everyone that had duped items the same whether 1 or 1 million this game would be a lonely place. But someone with 1 duped TSE handmade violated the TOS the same as the guy with 500K Ultracite 5.56.  I’m not bashing to defending either side, just my opinion.  (not everyone reads forums and there are still players who don’t even know duping exists)
---
&gt; you could build buy and find hundreds of thousands of bullets over a month of gameplay.
---
You could.  But why would you?
---
Yeah buying 100k ammo gets you suspended lol why even need that much Idk 
---
Nice.  At some point I'll have to explore the Mire for a build site as well.  But right now I'm happy just dealing with the occasional neighborhood Super Mutant ruffians.  Dealing with Death Claws, Gulpers, etc. would make for a lot of repairs unless it's a spot like this where the camp is isolated.
---
 I didn't know that you could place foundation blocks under water.  That's good to know. 
---
I really wish that there was a stair variant that included concrete posts that stuck into the ground, similar to the way foundation blocks do.  
---
HELLOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! YOU DEFEND A LYING SACK OF SHIT COMPANY HERE THAT RELEASED A BROKEN PRODUCT!!!!!!
---
Nah but having 100k of any item even if made fairly (ammo counts) will get you suspended though
---
 Over did this crap and now I walk everywhere. ;)
---
Dear Fallout,
---
My name is xXxEpic_And_Le_InnocentxXx
---
I didn’t cheat. I just wanted to play the game a little faster. Please, I am innocent. My stacks of nuka grape are the real deal. I duped those bad boys legitimately and I would like them back. It took time to do that and I’m *pissed* I don’t have them anymore.
---
I roleplay as an avid nuka-cola drinker, and I need caps to trade with that dude on r/fo76bazaar who’s got all the best shit for dumb cheap. 
---
Not only that, but you punish me for my bobblehead collection! If you *CORPORATE SHILLS* would increase the stash size already, I wouldn’t need to lug around 30,000+ bobbleheads...
---
Un-freaking-believable. I am one unhappy C.A.M.P.er 
---
Sincerely (NOT) yours,
---
Some lousy grump on reddit 
---
How many time nad resource you need to craft 200k ultracite ammo?
---
Not 1k, not 20k, but 200\_fu\*\*ing\_k!
---
I don't even look at the daily challenges, so every atom drop is a pleasant surprise. 
---
The 'This Operation could not be completed ' statement is identical to a bug Bethesda has yet to permanently fix on both Skyrim and Fallout 4 which affects both mod's and Creation Club Content. It's not permanent (yet) but it's a problem -so I'd have to agree cheating is still a thing, but it's pretty unlikely everyone that got banned actually cheated.
---
Nah, too much work, lazy fucking Bethesda wouldn’t consider this at all.
---
But then you won't win internet points like that 900 hours guy.
---
It's not that. All it takes is a griefer to touch the workshop and then leave, find you anywhere on the map and kill you. The smart ones work in teams, one or more working on finding workshop owners and one ready to activate the workshop. One touches the workshop and the other kills you milliseconds later anywhere on the map.
---
PvP mode should only engage if you choose to defend your workshop. But that's not how it works. You are open to PvP vs. a whole team of griefers anywhere on the map after any one of them touches the workshop. They don't even have to claim it. Most workshop PvP griefers don't care about the workshop. They just want you caps and whatever junk you are carrying and then move on.
---
For someone who plays as a crafter in the game, 600 stash space is not near enough to hold all the materials you need to provide services. Especially since stable Flux are 1 lb each. I use my stash almost exclusively for junk, 50 of each (including flux) and it's full. So, as a crafter, you have to carry junk. That means workshops aren't worth the risk. If I am on long enough to have an empty server, I'll claim workshops. But that usually only happens at the end of a long playing session with no crashes or DCs, and that doesn't happen very often, and when it does I'm already too tired to get much out of them.
---
So the mods deleted it? Idiots.  If they found concrete proof then should have left it up with a tag saying, proved duper or something.  Putting it out for everyone to see.
---
Instead the remove it.  With Bethesdas track record of censoring their own forums, I wouldn't be surprised if they asked the mods here to remove it.  This sub is literally tearing each other apart right now.  
---
I wear full unyielding armor, so even though I'm not a melee character by default, even with a base strength of 7, I have my strength at something like 24. That with a bloodied power fist with power attack damage and a bloodied 2 handed with swing speed- ammo is never an issue.
---
That doesn't keep me from having a 50 cal on me and a minigun and at least 100k ammo between the two. I also have an automatic handmade and combat rifle and keep between 15-25k ammo of each on me minimum.
---
But I run 2* bandolier with 1 substat on my armor that reduces ammo weight, so literally it weighs nothing.. why not be Rambo even though I make a good grognak at a moment's notice?
---
It's fucking absurd that there's a chance I can get banned for having absurd amounts of ammo on me- why the fuck not?
---
Even with no ammo issue I had a base built on the edge of a cliff that allowed me to gather lead from a resource up top and acid inside a cave down below, with the only downside being attacked by scorched beasts every time I go home.. though that last bit was why I didn't stay there for very long, it was tedious to defend and I would use more ammo than I was getting from the resources..
---
Do you have any notion how many of anything 100,000 is? It's not something you're going to run into even with the most vigorous crafting of anything outside ammo. 
---
What is actually happening to get you a ban?
---
Yo sorry youre getting downvoted by cheaters, the only way to fight this is to keep stealth boys on you and berry mentats. Stealth boy makes you un vats able and then berry mentats highlight all living things with purple aura. Atleast now its fair, nobody can get vatsed and you have an edge with the mentats. And always have perks ready for each situation. When you die the first time, change your perks. For instance if its a melee guy spec into the perk that reduces incoming melee damage, Guy not taking damage from guns put on tank killer etc. Good luck 
---
They didn't say the *last* 30 days.
---
Just a 30 period.
---
Any 30 day period.
---
*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** -Graveborn! ^(hug)
---
Yeah, I had to mention this in my 4 point debrief on the game's identity, what's done so amazingly right in a heritage of adventure games. It's point 3, the vast open zen conveyed in a feeling of smallness and wandering slowly a very expansive locale, it's meditative when done right in a game. I loved that in the game journey and in one scene in The last of us where zoo animals are depicted
---
Still not banned. 
---
Hold on.... lemme throw a spreadsheet together... 
---
 Dude, you definitely lied to us in something. 
---
Something I rarely seen considered when bashing people over quantities is clans, you get a large enough group of people together consolidating resources and having designated people hauling types of items to minimize perk demand and I would imagine it wouldn’t be hard to get some impressive stacks of just about anything without using exploits
---
Thanks...will give it a run tonight as my base is at the Junk spot near WS
---
Yeah no. Let me guess, you got banned?
---
Are you contradicting your argument by allowing the trollers to troll? 
---
As far as I know, some items do not unlock all the mods (if any), one example is the black powder rifle, which does not seem to unlock the bayonet mod but it can be found in vendors.
---
Both.
---
&gt;the trading explanation makes a lot of sense to me so your argument about the amount of hours needed to play to obtain 100k of an item doesn’t necessarily hold water.
---
BSG said earlier they check items that are looted, not traded/vendored. he would have had to trade with someone who for \*some reason\* put those things in a container and then he looted them. you know... another container \*apart\* from the paper bag.
---
who does that? a duper! every time! like we have SEEN, have had ADMITTED, and CONFIRMED, by players, dupers and developers alike! we even KNOW the method of duping involves putting things into a world container! we literally know the EXACT method which uses the EXACT 'excuse' that OP is using here. literally no one else puts their stuff that they plan on using and selling in random world containers.
---
it's completely inane and asinine to beeline to OPs side in this exchange WITH NO PROOF from either side except an automatic email from bethesda (which is NO PROOF, either). and to then to further go on about some tangential rant how this game is horrible is just one step beyond what i thought was pettily possible.
---
if you're going to complain about the game, let's complain about REAL stuff. real, honest-to-god-i-dont-even-know-why-i-play-this-game-anymore stuff, LIKE: 
---
\- horrible AI with scorchbeasts
---
\- no-rewarding fights
---
\- no end-game
---
\- no community-building
---
\- broken PvP, no PvP activities
---
\- and so fucking on.... BUT NAH. making a stand? yeah hell man, i'm putting my effort down right here! DOWN WITH BETHESDA! this guy didn't dupe!! for reals! ....and then some people have the mettle to say "grow up" in response to people who are asking everyone to just step back and chill; get some perspective. **literally \*EVERY SINGLE\* sob story about someone here being banned 'unjustified' has been proven to be 100% FALSE.** even admitted so by said duper. confirmed by bethesda. and that is just IN THIS GAME! imagine all the false lies and sob stories in OTHER games! but naw... this guy is obviously legit. do you know why? because he linked 10 locations with good loot - 10 locations, that, by the way, i also know of, so that means if i ever get banned for cheating, i'll just mention those locations and say "hey look, i love this game, i know this game. i didn't cheat."... oh god man. this is borderline gaslighting insanity. how is there NO ONE else here seeing this clearly?
---
**i'm sorry. there is so much legit shit to say about bethesda** \- their game design, their road maps/philosophy, the way they handled launch, their publisher, cheaping out on fucking nylon bags, sending PRIVATE INFORMATION to random people over emails (highly illegal!! JESUS!)... but NAWW. out of all things, it's THIS thing. this sob story from a most certain duper. this was the last straw. yeah, i'm going to kick up a fuss over THIS one thing!
---
again, this subreddit:

---
if anyone truly lost their taste for gaming subreddits after reading my "wall of text", and are not coming back; GOOD. fucking thank you. you are probably part of the problem anyway. i hope you never come back because you can't even rub two brain cells together long enough to process the most basic of messages.
---
(also when people refer to 1A page as a 'wall of text' you know they're probably preschoolers anyway, because that's the most they've had to write).
---
anyway ty u/ATXlien23 for giving a proper response and not just giving in to the blind mindless hive-mind frenzy. anything rude or offensive in this post is not directed at you, but sorry anyway. cheers mate.
---
An organized effort? Why? Fallout 76 is doing badly enough on it's own. If it was successful then you'd have a point.-
---
They all give slightly different bonuses, so they do depend on your playstyle.
---
30 days of play? (720 hours of gameplay?) or 30 calendar days? 
---
Here, let me fix that
---
Why is it everyone's immediate reaction to look st the post history of someone venting about this game? Why can't you just accept what people say at face value?
---
That's like if I eavesdropped in on your conversations after I hear you disagree with me on something just so I could bring it up as a moot point. If you don't have anything constructive to say then don't say anything
---
"Putting up with"? LOL
---
Anybody who is playing a game they don't enjoy either a) they work in QA and are getting paid for it, or b) they're fucking imbeciles and deserve not sympathy but derision. 
---
What does your answer have to do with the situation? The dudes were cheaters and got banned. Now they write that they have not done anything illegal, and I try to say that not all of them should believe. 
---
And here you appear and write that I defend bad game and bad company. What is the point of your post? 
---
Do you think that in good games they do not ban cheaters? Or if the game is bad, then you can use cheats and exploits in it? Or do you just want to fart in thread? 
---
The exploits from previous games were a problem with the engine. That is a million times harder to debug than just the game itself
---
So they suspended accpunt who have held on them at some point 100k of any in game item (ammo you crafted/bought, picking up a bag of duoed junk left by a duper, ect) no matter if it was gotten without duplication legit or not gets the player suspended
---
When looting a paper bag in a game can get you banned.  Lmao 😂
---
Found a little over 65k ultracite 5.56 in a suitcase in December when looting Charleston Station one evening. Took em. Split the stack on my 2 accounts. Hadn’t even used a single one lol. Was waiting to make a rifle build. 
---
That was beautiful 
---
They are obsessive and stalking anyone who posts negative things about a broken game.  This is not a sign of a healthy community.
---
He posted the email from Betheshda which showed he had 360k of Ultracite ammo just sitting in his inventories. You wouldn't just need the ultracite but also all the acid to smelt lead ore into scrap. Or of course the most obvious answer... it was all duped. And everyone is taking his whole sob story and claim of 900 hour play time at face value.
---
Hehehe. This guy over here ☝🏻
---
Man, I cook so much of that in FO4. Very lucrative. 
---
Yeah man but I don't care about my suspension. I mean yeah i understand there system holding for me holding 100k+ ammo That I made/bought kinda walked into myself but I mean I can play new vegas again now right
---
Why do these look so good? 
---
Ugh more EA propaganda...
---
Imagine fixing this bug will take 3 weeks. Do you want these players to go around for 3 weeks duping everything? 
---
I fail to see how duping would be acceptable in any scenario. If there is a game-breaking exploit that allows you to dupe, abusing it obviously isn't the right thing to do, and bethesda has every right to ban them.
---
Grafton day, Grafton day, Grafton day, Grafton day. It's GRAFTON DAY... Again. 
---
And yet we give Bethesda shit for not listening to "the community". We certainly want to have it both ways. 
---
Lol, so true
---
Prepare to be attacked by fanboys who tell you to show patience...its "only" been 4 months lol
---
When I was playing at my peak, before the general populace was doing the scorch queen, my friends and I would basically follow the other traders I've met (who were amazingly geared early on, benefit of being a trader) and we would do scorch queen fights back to back probably 10-15 times in a row.
---
You get 2 of each kind of flux except for one, the traders would trade the ones they don't want with the rest of us for what they do want, to craft the serums that were selling well. That's about 80-100 flux every day that I don't need, that's when I started crafting ultracite ammo.
---
I never was into selling ammo, but it was there if a friend was low, or if I ever needed caps fast.. every day the amount of ultracite ammo I had grew, yet I wasn't going to convert my guns to ultracite receivers when I know you can't switch some back. I probably have nearly 100k of several different kinds, but that's over the course of months.
---
I have made a couple of trades in game for some really great weapons to people that basically never wanted to worry about ammo again, that's how I got my "god roll" 3* bloodied power fist.
---
The 900 hour guy sounded like people from my crew, people that didn't half ass anything, none were casual players.. they had their routine, their own personal farm, and they weren't the type to share this info like the 900 hour guy.
---
There's what's normal to everyone else and then there's what's normal to the people that networked with other players to truly maximize their gameplay, trade the best weapons and armor, etc.
---
I've sold over a thousand flux FYI, any time I did any nuke I made a point to grab flux every time I get hardened mass, because that's the only thing that was rare, so I had an absurd amount of flux that wasn't really good for serums and ammo.
---
Feel free to check mine if you don't mind nsfw links 🍑
---
Eloquently put. Bravo. 
---
This is fallout, you are not supposed to pick up stuff you find.  They clearly put out limits to how much of any one item you are allowed to have.  It has been crystal clear from day one that trading with a player or finding loot in a bag is not how Bethesda intended us to play.  It’s clear in black and white that you are not allowed to have 100K of anything clearly established as rare even if found or traded for.  They even have all kinds of mechanics built into the game that prevent you from even possessing that much. They don’t have perk cards that make things nearly weightless or dupe items you craft.  
---
I can understand 225k normal 5.56 but ultracite hell no lol
---
Well that sucks! I would of thought you'd hit the storage cap long before getting close to that number. If it's a online social game where team work is kinda needed. Why are people being punished for storing something that you actually need Because of your guns, ammo armour and always thirsty or hungry? 
---
I know, that ‘s why i asked without okay style. Say. I was a noob I I could pick any shielded suit to my choosing on lvl 5 or 2. Which one would be the best? No play style. Just picking random perks and not know what to do. Using every weapon you could find and sneak. Everything. Which one would be best?
---
There are people I know who never cheated and stuck by this shitty pile of shit through and through and now they are banned. I personally no longer care, cause I gave up on the game in December. Been hoping that Beth would turn it around and I can get back but with all updates, they just fuck shit up even more.
---
Also, it's been 4 months since release without any content added to the game (except for the ATOM shop of course).
---
Now, the main thing that is annoying about all this is that people have turned into blind mind fucked fanboys who will do anything to say Beth has no fault in this. Ok, let us examine from the start:
---
BETA - People are reporting duping. Beth says it will be fixed.
---
Release - Same duping mechanics still in the game, even though literally hundreds of people reported them to Beth.
---
1-2 months in - They try to fix A dupe glitch so lazily, that a simple new step introduced can just achieve the same dupe results.
---
Now - They  admit that they still have dupe glitches in the game and ban players randomly for having "too many" items in their inventories UNTIL they can fix the glitch (no timeframe provided mind you).
---
So what do we have here? A company that CANNOT fix its product and blames people for playing the game as the game lets the play.
---
And what does people like you in this community do? They attack the players for speaking out, not Bethesda for being incompetent ever since fucking BETA. 
---
Your whole thread is a huge FART lol. You provide nothing and just ask players to turn on each other instead of blaming Bethesda for their incompetence. 
---
this is not even an A4 page. i guess you are still in pre-school.
---
i decided to dumb down my message to a few easily consumed chunks, so that even pre-evolved people like you can have a gander at the obvious:
---
a) no proof either way. bethesda warns they will ban dupers. next day a sob story pops up.
---
b) going to believe sob-story over bethesda, despite numerous occasions of sob-stories turning out to be false (on this very sub)
---
c) going to tell people who point out these two basic facts (a and b, mind you, in case you forgot) for being 'awkward' and 'posts that dissent from the mere expression of opinion and not the opinion itself'
---
d) also thinks that the quote "posts that dissent from the mere expression of opinion and not the opinion itself" is not directly hypocritical and is an offender of just the type you described
---
e) pretending to 'check in on the state of the game that you love so much' by hopping onto the first sob story written after bethesdas first ban-wave. you have an odd way of 'checking in on the game'. but none of these things would matter to me, except that
---
f) you also said 'grow up', as if you were in any part exemplary. you're just here whining, ignoring basic facts, telling others to grow up because they don't instantly believe a sob story at face value.
---
u/Chief_Willy
---
you must not know what a straw man fallacy is, i suggest you read up on it and understand what it is before you call out others on not knowing it.
---
and most ironic of all, you people are actually upvoted. it would be easier for me to accept that you were some corporate chills for some other game, than to believe that you are all this collectively deluded and so easily fooled by some random guy posting sob stories. but it's really becoming increasingly hard giving any of you the benefit of the doubt. i can only assume you are not that bright (like this sentence foretolds 'wow, wall of text' in reference to 1 A4\~ page)
---
but naw mate. you just keep coming back here whenever there is something negative. hop on the hate train. write your stuff. write rude things - like 'grow up' - just because people are asking you to not jump to conclusions. be an asshole. congratulations, you've done all of the things you championed again in your original post.
---
Holy shit for real?
---
Where’s the proof that it was the guy with 900 hours played?  
---
Hey kink shaming aint cool lol
---
Didnt the email (at least the one linked in the 900 hours thread) say youd be banned until the duping glitches are sorted out and not permanently. 
---
rofl... read, can you do it?
---
Yeah its fucking gross. Literally looking at every post where someone so much as sighs at the game is like:
---
"Oh I saw you posted on r/relationships that your wife left you. Maybe that's why you're having a hard time playing this perfect game. Maybe that's why she left you."
---
Like DAMN CHILL LMAO
---
People like you make me glad to be playing this game. I try to help out anybody lower than me also.
---
How did you make it circular wtf that is amazing
---
Expected for Bioware. Either that game do well for them or they are completely fucked and EA gotta pull the trigger. 
---
Lol.. dude.. wHaT aRe YoU gOiNg On AbOuT? 
---
Yep, I had a trader/friend show me early on a place I could fast travel to and grab 300+ if each ore needed for ammo in less than 3 minutes, lucky mine takes too long. It's the only reason I got excavator armor. You can make an absurd amount of gunpowder with a tiny bit of acid and paper (you'd be surprised how many people don't even know this), so all the acid you have left turns it into scrap, which turns into 15-20k ammo. If you server hop for 10 minutes, you'll get enough ore for a month from one spot.
---
Ultracite is around every fissure site, anyone who thinks it's rare hasn't been to one apparently.
---
You're absolutely right, people haven't even looked up tips for the game if this stuff is hard for them, much less explored anything for themselves.
---
Like 14 days I think
---
Got to say, the server stability has been fantastic!
---
Almost always find one in the Pro Shoppe at Watoga Golf Course (on the counter near the manequin on the left of the room as you enter)
---
You mean your Mom's credit union right?
---
I'm there with you.   I have zero fears of being banned at all.  I am certain I won't get touched.  Never traded a single item to anyone, never duped, never accepted a single item from anyone, cept some random common ammo at train stations. 
---
Tomorrow
---
No I was more into nonstop legendary farming mixed with always bulking everything I could for OCD sake, I def had over 100k ammo on me but I’m perkd for that being a heavy gunner. 
---
I'm 400 hours in, levels 216 and 50. I craft 5mm 2k-3k at a time. Maxed out caps. I have 0% fear of being banned because these people are full of shit.
---
Today but depends on where you live 9am Est i believe
---
This is kind of an unfair position to put banned players in. They can't login to show their inventories and prove innocence. This stacks the deck on bethesda's side.
---
I know two people that've been banned and I still don't understand why or how they have been. Meanwhile, Bethesda has had zero communication with the community on what they're flagging and whether the system could possibly lead to false positives. 
---
I think it's quite early to take sides here on account of one player's post
---
It’s too damn entertaining to leave
---
People seen you were able to get $20+ on certain weapons and so they duped and sold and resold.
---
It’s as if they shouldn’t have made a multiplayer game on this engine...
---
I dont see a difference between an online or an offline game. I paid for the product, you dont get to tell me how to use it. If you want to prevent certain things (such as duping) from happening in the game - then make such dupes impossible. If they are doable - then you are A) a shitty game developer B) fully responsible for the issue and its consequences, and cannot blame your players for exploiting the issues in your game.
---
This subreddit isn't much different. It tends to hop on the bandwagon for everything and it's pretty bad about taking in outsider opinions. 
---
You’re missing my point 
---
Even with Chemist for 4 diluted from 1 normal, he would have needed to start with  25,000 stimpacks and 50,000 purified water to get to 100,000 diluted stimpacks. Add in super duper and that's still 17,500 stimpacks and 35,000 purified water. Even if he were crazy and played 8 hours every day for 30 days in a row, he'd need to get 73 stimpacks and 146 purified water an hour, every hour.
---
TL:DR - your brother either duped himself or bought/picked up duped items and deserves the temporary ban.
---
So now you have fun?
---
Having a duped weapon violates the TOS the same as having 100K of “rare” ammo.   
---
This one time, at the overseer camp........
---
I mean I assumed upon picking the bag up that I could be flagged for having duped materials, and against my better judgment I picked it up anyway and look what happened. I knew damn well that a resource that valuable wouldn’t be dumped into a container if it was made legitimately. The number alone reflected the man hours it would take to farm the ultracite so I knew it was likely illegitimate. What sucks is that I made a greedy impulsive decision when I knew better. 
---
Banned huh?
---
I've never kept flux on my main character, it just weighs too much for a character I'm playing on daily, but that's why my original character became my crafter/mule. It's my melee character, which became obsolete when I decided to use unyielding armor, so that's his only job, using specialized materials.
---
My main can craft everything else that doesn't require flux. And I've read about people using teams to attack players workshop simultaneously, I just figured it was a myth or greatly exaggerated to be honest.. I'm on PS4 and I've only had people come after me twice, and that was at my base.
---
If you don't have a friend to help you get stuff over to another character I can understand your dilemma, that's what I do for my friends provided they help me get my stuff on my other characters.. that's all they're really useful for to me, lessening the burden of one stash.
---
nope lol.... haven't played since Christmas, but nice try
---
They have logs for everything, so finding just the duplicated items shouldn't be very difficult. Yeah I guess technically they are at fault. Releasing old  bugs with a long fix time was pretty stupid... Yeah people were fired lol. Thats something that happens in schools or on your personal computer while smoking or getting drunk lol.
---
I would go melee to avoid getting banned for ammo
---
I agree with you, if they are issuing bans over high amounts of ammo, I think that’s a little ridiculous. I thought they were banning people that had high amounts of rare items. I think it’s incredibly unhealthy that some people have that amount of time to play the game, but I accept that some people do, and that it’s probably possible to farm a huge amount of ammo.
---
Got to get to McClintock early in the morning.
---
Seeing as there have been repeated lies and scandals made from nothing and circumvented by salty players or r/fallout that we're proven to be false at the end of the day,
---
Yeah, I definitely believe Bethesda over these people.
---
Unfortunately for you, this is your opinion that is not supported by said  company. So basically, as a real life example, if it is possible for me to steal from a shop, I can keep it because the shop owners did not prevent me from stealing despite their warning that shoplifters will be prosecuted. 
---
Or play melee and kill a lot of crap, most of which drops ammo.  I've dropped easily 500k ammo with far less play time then him.
---
It’s not for having 100,000 of one item. The suspension is for having what they deem rare items or a larger amount of an item they find odd and over the norm. It can also be a combination of all the above.
---
I know my brother got a response email. All the response email said that they would look over his case again and get back to him in 48 hours.
---
Huh, Salty Dupers was my porn stage name.
---
I don’t see how duping hurts the game other than disconnecting the server, which I’m unsure was even confirmed. The game has PvP, sure, but ya’ll don’t even touch it, so duped weapons don’t matter. Duped mats, consumables? Shit, that’s just making the game playable. I don’t dupe, I don’t play the game anymore, but I think it’s unfair to harshly punish people who paid $60 for using what Bethesda left in the game. Bethesda isn’t taking responsibility in this case, they’re only further reinforcing the idea that dupers are to blame for Bethesda’s incompetence so you target them and ignore Bethesda’s shit deeds.
---
And everything I've read about that game so far is that its mediocre.
---
Bump! And upvoting.
---
Everyone is a victim. No one ACTUALLY committed wrong. /sarcasm.
---
Used to get around 40 raw cobalt in WS, then with green thumb equipped it jumped to 80. You can find the other components by looting all the meat piles. whether you tagged the ad or not. Most times it will be glowing meat or some such, but ever so often you'll find hardened mass and the like.
---
Speaking of hardened mass, I still remember my 2nd or 3rd run of prime fissure when I scrapped 60 hardened mass. RIP
---
My favorite part is how you wrote that guide after you got banned in order to use it as a part of your story of an innocent and passionate fan.  You'd make Jussie Smollet proud.
---
Enclave.   
---
Two stars, look at him, the big guy.

I got my first "useful" legendary, a furious lever action rifle last night.

Great.  Furious on a weapon with a max ammo capacity of five rounds.

Guess it could have been worse, a furious black powder pistol would have been fun.
---
Where the heck do you find rare loot?  best drop I’ve gotten is a 1* troubleshooters rolling pin.

---
He didnt to my knowledge, and I have been in both his posts about his guide and about the ban, and I have not seem that image or a claim by him he was exploiting.
---
To me, the guy posting this thread is full of it, creating proof based on his own beliefs to justify what he thinks is true. 
---
That doesn't prove anything but I do believe that is what your intent was. To craft an image for yourself as a person who couldn't possibly be guilty.
---
here in Italy is goin to be today feb 19th at 3pm. Im happy i'll be still at work so it will be done when i come back
---
😂😂😂
---
I think I've traded with you in the past. Your inventory didn't raise any red flags from me. Hopefully your suspension will be lifted post-patch and your dupe raids will be all you lose.
---
#BelieveDupers?
---
Link to where he shares that photo or says he was duping ammo.......cause I still haven't seen one. 
---
Upvoting you win today’s ass kicker award!
---
Yeah, coming from WoW I'm used to these kinds of posts. "Help, I got banned for doing simple thing X", where X is usually something questionable but totally OK within the game rules. Usually the post tries to gain sympathy by trying to paint the devs as bullies who basically shoot you for jaywalking. Then someone from support wastes his time just to confirm "No man, you did Y, which is very very wrong". And result? Quite often the banned person just deletes the post text, like the 900 hrs guy here...
---
I'm not claiming that there are no false positives in their cheater detection system. But using my experience with other games (like wow above), the cheaters are quite arogant people. And these people are more likely to go on reddit to either weaponize the community as a means for lifting the ban or just for simply kicking the company/game one more time. I agree that 90% of "wrongfully banned" people are liars. But I'd like to also point out that any negative news surrounding this game tends to attract people who come just to badmouth Bethesda and keep the negative narrative going. I can guarantee you that some of the "I got banned" people here don't even own the game.
---
You shld definitely post a new post to respond to this if you are what you say you are. Otherwise with no response or further evidence, it's quite ambiguous. 
---
Hi guy. I'm confident this isn't what you are looking for, but I work in tech and if a business app crashed consistently for you but not for the other people on your floor of the office tower, we would 100% always assume your device is the problem.
---
Maybe you are on a PS4, but Microsoft has programming kits that these developers have to use to make it all communicate, and your device is being passed a piece of information (first assumption is the graphics for a nuke explosion) and that info is not processing as expected. The simple fact that mine has never crashed while nuking (though Im not on Sony so maybe all Sony guys have your issue) is frustrating for you, is possibly poor Bethesda programming at the root level, perhaps it's dust in your fan, (who knows without having it looked at) should logically illustrate to Fo76 haters as well as fanboys that this probably isnt correctable by programming.
---
BUT for any software in any industry, no programming is ever going to be done to fix your issue. It's not that it takes time, or low priority, it's that no business model allows for companies to follow up with individuals or pursue bugs that only affect .01% of the population.
---
I'm not trying to correct you. I saw how you worded your post and there is NO amount of time where this would be fixed, unless there were many reports and it is reproduce-able. Nobody is slapping you, you just got bad luck with your 360/PC. Or, you have a PS4 and this is common on that platform!
---
Anthem is and Amazing Game. It’s the game I’m replacing Fallout76 and Defiance 2050 with..
---
4. Players who knew they did wrong when looting a bag which was probably from a duper clearing his inventory. However even if they regret &amp; dropped it, it most likely was too late already.       
---
5. Players who actively played in a small group and everyone had his job, e.g. a serum chemist, a power armor mechanic, an ammo smith, a junk hoarder and a weapon/armor modder. 2 of those (junk hoarder &amp; ammo smith) might got banned.      
---
6. Queenhunters who thought it was a great idea to make use all their stored fluxes by turning them into ultracite ammo. Buying missing junk &amp; selling the crafted ammo. It's more profitable then just selling fluxes.
---
That's what you get when culture grinds to a screeching halt in the 1950s.
---
Hmm the game is kinda forcing you to make that decision. Like you said its hard to come by that amount. It's not like you can drop it off at a lost and found office and wait thirty days for someone to claim it?
---
Report it to Sony they won't like him talking about your mother and I'm certain your not the only person he's done this to. A little vacation from his PS4 might teach him to act right
---
If it’s good and you don’t have like a 1000 Of any item, I’m guessing you’re fine 
---
It’s not mediocre. It’s more base Destiny 1 at end game.  Good News BioWare starting in March will be adding content on a regular basis for free at least for the first year.
---
I got bored by the demo, the game content is thin, but the point I want to make is, what is BGS doing with thr FO76 money? They arent using it to fix FO76 obviously given the state of the game. I got my money's worth lf fun but my goodwill for BGS has turned negative, at least EA supports their games, BGS cant even convince us that the game has more than a token amount of people working on it. 
---
That’s not possible to get do much Ammo in 30 days even with this modded lvl 900.... 
---
Cmon, 240K ultracite ammo acquired is totally believable.  After all, it’s so easy to farm and craft and with my super duper perks and ammosmith perks gimme 45 minutes and I’ll get there 
---
Sure sure.  "Help please, I am innocent, never sold any TSE or duped any items in my life".
---
Confirmation that it would be today?
---
Yeah, it is. If years of online gaming have taught me anything, it's that 90% of "false positive" posts are just bullshit. Add in the fact that people love to create fake posts here just to take shots at Bethesda and we're at the point where that change of "false positive" being true false positive are slim.
---
Your kid is probably lying to you my man. Kids lie or downplay their shit all the time, especially if they did something that cost you your money. He had more than just Nuka Colas but those were all duped too.
---
He is full of shit. They found him with 360k rounds of ultracite ammo.
---
That's not the minuteman way
---
Upvoting 
---
It's not witch-hunting. If you're wearing specific PA and constantly searching for ore to smelt, guess what? You are a dedicated farmer.
---
If you constantly buy common aid items and expensive plans specifically to trade with other players to get around the cap limit, guess what? You are a dedicated trader.
---
Having multiple characters specifically to get around the cap limit is not normal player behavior. You're an outlier, not a common player.
---
Given how long duping has been around and how apparently popular it is with people who also post on reddit, it's extremely likely that any dedicated trader has dealt with duped items. It's not inherently their fault, given that a duped item looks exactly the same as a non-duped item to players, but given how rampant duping has been and how insanely inflated the prices were on player trading sites, it's a "you should have known better" situation.

and lo and behold, just now here we see: this was, after all, just another sob story. a false, fabricated story. he was a fucking liar: 100% they always are, every damn time. still, you u/Chief_Willy thought this was the perfect time to write:
---
&gt;All that's left is the awkwardly positive posts and front page threads with titles: "Playing in an abandoned server is literally the best" since those are the only people left playing. Sad at the same time.
---
in response to that people are banned innocently. and then when you are asked why you are still here if that's what you believe you tell people to grow up.
---
guess my 'wall of text' cautioning common sense and basic reasoning to not let some random users fake stories sway your emotion to the point where you feel the need to "share to others how you just check in the state of the game, but all there is left is sad people" was the correct way of thinking after all.
---
you have an odd way of checking back on games that you might want to play in the future. but each to their own i guess.
---
Seriously. You can say there's no frame of reference on the fucking map and these people will swallow it whole, because Fo76 O B J E C T I V E L Y bad.
---
For being so picky with their lore, they sure love to rewrite history a lot. Just tell them you've played a couple of hours and you can say just about anything and they'll believe it. Tbf some people here have pretty much said they're only here to see the game burn, and as you said people love drama.
---
Why are you still subbed here
---
I actually watched him do it.  I warned him he might be banned.  The issue is not that he was banned.  Its that bethesda is not consistent with these bans.  If you did not dupe huge ammounts of nuka colas, you dont get banned for duping 100s of TSEs and othe end game weapons and armor.
---
I’ve taken over workbenches after people have logged and kept their stuff there. I don’t know what the timeframe is for the stuff dissolving but I’ve taken several reactors that were not claimed but clearly had been, fortifications, guns bench’s and storage boxes all in place.

The robots can be very helpful sometimes.  Got a nuke card on Saturday because the robots got pissed having a cargobot flying over *their* town.
---
What amount of time? Early on when most Queens wouldn't die, our queen fights lasted at most 9 minutes.. as we got better we got those fights down to 6 minutes, fastest was just over 2. We would rotate 1 player who would be in the process of launching on a different server when we are doing a fight, as we got faster and our group got bigger, it would be about 3 different players with numbers ready and waiting (before we got there) on 3 different servers.
---
That means we went from about 4 Queens an hour to about 9? Even with 3 people each fight not in the fight, because we did so many an hour everyone got more in per day. 3 hours of Queens a day to less than 2.
---
Ultracite Ammo was a byproduct of so many fights, but you had to craft enough for the fights themselves, so you've got about 1 hour or so of prep for each day. I could trade the ultracite ammo I created to those who needed it at a 1:4 ratio and never need to prep like they did, so I got to screw with friends more. I also never gave away all my ultracite ammo, so it accumulated.
---
They have a million other things they can/should ban over, things that ruined the market like nukacolas and serum recipes would make sense- ammo does not. It's probably the only thing you can craft large amounts of without absurd farming.. I was telling someone else, I could server hop in one spot alone and grab 300+ of each ore in 3 minutes per hop and easily craft over 100k ammo with just acid and paper and ore, that's it. Not even that much acid honestly.
---
I am not

I notice no one is saying you should be banned for life for using exploits.

Yeah, pretty much
---
The gunfire sounds of supermutants and scorched are really similar to one another be it a minigun a laser rifle or etc2. They will also shoot at you consistently and seem to have infinite ammo until killed, combined this with guttural groans from scorched and whining aggression from the mutants if they have you in sight. Also, I have also encountered enemies that have spawned underground or inside and they usually respawn properly once you move away. 
---
If none of this occured, it is mostly likely a player crouched with chameleon's armor (so it can hide you from the radar if you have high perception). 
---
Sorry I must be missing something but how does this prove he was lying? Where is this screenie from?
---
I thought they just set duped items to one, like say you had 5000 bloodied explosive shotguns they would remove 4999. But say you bought one of a duper without knowing it, you'd still get to keep your main. I could be wrong but that's what I've heard.
---
I just did up a quick table with all the shielded lining values. There was one post up but it was missing some info. So...[this](https://imgur.com/a/WAXF6B7) may help a bit with your choices?
---
Now call me crazy, but perhaps this multi-million dollar triple A company should have...I dunno, fixed some of this stuff in any of the time between now and the launch last year? I waited probably for about a month and a half after launch before I included things like server hopping to enhance my farming abilities, simply because they didn't address it either in a "Inside the vault" or otherwise. The message isn't clear at all, to be honest other than "You better not ever obtain 100k of certain items in a month that we will not mention specifically, or else." Ammo, especially, is easy to get 100k of. Ultracite isn't rare. I have a stockpile of about 13k ultracite .45 ammo myself and that's not even spending all that much time farming it. I farmed queens and traded excess flux for the flux I wanted, and the ultracite itself comes in the hundreds from the mine and even more from unwanted masses/scorchbeast bones. Lets not even start on the volumes that serious traders might come across in a month.
---
I could be wrong, but I feel that Fallout 76 is gonna last a lot longer than Anthem. Anthem fits into that quick scheme of "release popular genre - abandon it for the next shiny one". Fortnite is like that. APEX is like that. Battlefield 5. Destiny 2. The Division 2...

No one forced them to do it.

It's up to them to prove they didn't. 
---
Bethesda have all the proof the need that says otherwise, yes potentially the innocent can get caught but the new restrictions introduced, but sadly that's a byproduct of the cheaters etc. Fault that had to be introduced. It's easy enough for Bethesda to see who is innocent
---
Keep the guilty banned, the wasteland will be a nicer place for it. 
---
Unpopular opinion time now!

They should have gone the whole hog with the item removal in the game in my opinion.

When i logged in 2 hours ago it said that update is due 9 am est tuesday

Guess that means it dissapears after X amount of time. Looks like a fast-ish time as well.

I've seen this kinda thing quite often in other games; with a once popular Youtuber from GuildWars2 being the most memorable (banned for teleport hacking and claiming unjust ban on Reddit till exposed). Mr 900's story wasn't too meaningful and it should be taken to Bethesda support, not Reddit anyways so I downvoted and moved on despite it just being a small drop in an excessive amount of upvotes and gold but whatever. :)
---
I dunno what his community goals were or anything but really... it's better to just accept punishment and wait out suspension or work something out with support (or just Rebuy the game if it lets you) and carry on legitimately than make a scene that could end up making you look worse. People are easier to forgive that way too.
---
God dammit. I love you. 
---
"You mean it can make pancakes, biscuits, and my husband more faithful?"
---
And now we see why I titled [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as13p6/482000_error_ban_and_reading_comprehension/) what I did.
---
Forcing? Nah chief. I hit the E key all by myselfz.  Didn’t anyone ever tell you that you don’t bring a blame-thrower to a ban-hammer fight?
---
Wipe your cache you smelly puke!
---
BS. I picked up a bag with hundreds of lead and circuits and spend 2 weeks selling them off to vendors, and I did not get banned.
---
 Also, the ultracite argument is stale as well. People were banned for having a several 100.000 uc ammo acquired in one month, this is as good as impossible through normal game play. 
---
Awesome thanks!
---
Look at the dude with over 900 hours and he got banned for having too much ammo, I have about 30k 5.56 and over 40k shotgun shells, and over 12k ammo for the bolt action and mine is legit 
---
Yes white knight decreases cost more with each level. Power patch we I can not recall off hand.
---
Man, not like they didn't have....oh, I dunno, something like a decade or more of use on the same engine to debug them before making a multiplayer game on it where exploits are 10x worse, or even simply say "These are known issues, people caught abusing them will be dealt with."
---
Did the wash your windows too?
---
What you are describing sounds like a visual bug which wouldn't be stored server side. Also, screenshots or it didn't happen?
---
I wonder how the community will act tomorrow (or in a future patch I guess) If those who are "banned" / suspended, turn out to be the victim of an overly aggressive anti cheat system that flagged them for even the smallest infraction. 
---
Would People go back to getting along?  Would the wedges between folks in the sub be too deep? Could the game even recover after this latest loss of consumer faith? 
---
Kinda funny when you look at those post who love playing in a server by themselves. They may be the only ones left, and hopefully content with that.
---
Frankly I've been fed up with this game for a long time, in large part because Bethesda's negligence (or incompetence) allowed the toxic community of dupers and exploiters to fester and absolutely murder server stability, balance, the in-game economy, etc.
---
The news of these ban waves and dupe deletions has been an absolute *joy* to read about and has restored some of my faith in their ability to turn this game into something playable eventually. Every one of these "I'm innocent guys I swear" posts brings a smile to my face.
---
Way to go Bethesda, keep bringing the hammer down. 
---
Well they admitted to my brother some people could have been banned by mistake that it was an automated ban wave. So if you contact them and they say it stands you was guilty of something. If they say they will review it then you are most likely innocent.
---
Thnx
---
If you ever been to an exploiter forum you will know the first advice you get is deny everything, blame a glitch and or a friend. Never admit you cheated even if it is obvious. 
---
I love that you're acting like any build in this game is a secret. There's extremely little variation in build setups.
---
Most like he made up the story to cover the fact that he exploited the system himself.
---
Spin it all you want. The outcome is the same
---
Banned lolz
---
So storing your junk that you find on a “mule” is an exploit?  My wife stores all the teddy bears and toys she finds on a “mule”.  I guess she should be banned because Bethesda intended them to be scrapped?  Must be duping if she hides them there.
---
Jesus I just remembered that time I found 117 lockpicks in a trashcan and I'm shitting myself.
---
Upvoting for trying
---
You would have busted weight before and in between the weight patch for pins lol
---
Yea I couldn’t tell you timeframe, I logon, see what’s taken for what I need and go from there
---
If you took their stuff... Killing them is one thing, then taking their stuff is another.
---
That's just waiting for someone to do the dirty work and then stealing all their exploited stuff.  Its worse.
---
Doing it in the name of "hunting down the bad people" is worse yet.
---
\[Bethesda\] (probably): We need to find some arbitrary reason to drop players but let's keep the $40 they've knowingly spent on a &lt;purposely&gt; broken game. \[Employee of the month raises her hand and suggests\] "Ban wave!" \[Previous Employee of the month pounds table with fist "We will have the reddit account shills post's pointing fingers and distract attention from our plan to keep their money." \[Programmer whom rigged servers to light switch leaked info how to copy power armor, artillary cache, and multiple weapon crafting\] ::Sits quietly::
---
ofc there are perk cards everyone uses when they run a melee build, but some things have lesser known mechanics and have yet to made public
---
That was fun trying to figure out why I logged in encumbered.
---
Well your stretching it with the whole "husband more faithful", they dont have 4 star ones in the game yet.
---
Or traded back and fourth between himself.   My only point is that I have 0 faith in Bethesda to tell the truth about most anything around the game at this point,  they constantly screw it up so why have faith in them now.
---
To go through that much ammo in 30 days is certainly possible. Crafting it all in 30 days is another thing. If it were just normal 5mm it'd be doable but you would be spending all of your time farming for the lead needed. No way you could get enough ultracite to craft anywhere near the numbers in the screenshot.
---
Those SBs are vindictive prix. Screw them and their posse.
---
Had one stalking me for an hour at hopewell.
---
Even lucky enough to inspire the death claw there to fight it.
---
In the end it cost about 400 rounds of ammo,
---
.308 / .45 and .44
---
Yeah but what kind of music do you want to play that works with the fallout universe? 
---
Not so stupid now dumb ass 
---
Lol this guy was right 
---
Guess you were drunk and I was right 
---
Be careful, fun is a direct violation of the TOS
---
Seems bethesda agrees with me 
---
You're right. This post isnt that interesting
---
I don't look for ore, I know where it's at- total time dedicated 3 minutes while wearing armor. I don't go looking for things to buy, I buy them when I see them when I'm selling to the 7 different vendors just like everyone else- time dedicated 9 minutes.
---
What is normal behavior when you're capped on caps? You're wrong, it is common behavior. Most players don't have a list of things they actually need to buy and it's a common sense thing that your other characters can store caps. It's as common sense as using other characters and their stash to store stuff, which has been common knowledge since day 1.
---
It isn't nearly as common, the duping that is, as the things I mentioned above that you *didn't think are common*. That's called perception, and because of your personal experience with dupers you've become paranoid that this is common behavior, just like you not seeing the behavior I mentioned makes you think it isn't common when it actually is.
---
I'm aware of what players dupe more than you are because I watched the market react. Also, your answer might be "well you can't really trade because dupers" but again, that isn't true. I had people that bought off of me because I didn't have dupe prices, and I wouldn't buy a weapon or armor that was being sold for obvious dupe prices, but when it became the new market value because of saturation I didn't have a choice.
---
Honestly, you can take this "you should have known better" concept and learn a thing or two. You should have known better for how you play the game, what players want, where to store items and excess caps, how and where to quickly grab ore and craft absurd amounts of it really quickly with little/no effort.
---
Instead you're trying to be some sort of duping guru- why is that? What makes you such an expert? Do I need to go through your post history?
---
If less than 1% of players actively cheated it's actually safe to say that very little changed market values that weren't going to happen eventually regardless from normal gameplay, they simply accelerated the process. Perhaps they saturated the market here, perhaps on Facebook, that doesn't mean what you buy somewhere else must be a dupe, it just means the value went down.
---
You really need to play the game more to find out what normal is, I think you're more than a little out of touch with things like "dedicated farming" or dedicated trading. That implies I spent the majority of my time doing those things when I didn't.
---
I'm just better at doing those things than you are, that's why they didn't take much effort on my part.
---
 But you were doing such valuable work for them finding out how to recreate the amazing pinata player bug?
---
I love that OP is acting like "melee is very good" is something that nobody else knew.
---
Exactly this.....in what way is ammo rare, even ultracite ammo.
---
You people really need to read the EULA. Technically they don't need an excuse to ban people. This goes for any subscription based game.
---
Could be, just put it out there.
---
Screenshots may be tampered. It maybe an age issue, but I really don't care whether random users give me credit or not.
---
Oksure.
---
Every game is like this. Cheaters that get banned flock tk the forums with their claims of innocence. They'e already banned, they have nothing to lose from lying. Regular people aren't getting banned.
---
Whoever invented the stash system is the enemy of fun.
---
Ban hammer tells you why. 
---
Ban hammer says it wasn’t that stupid, actually happened 
---
I may agree with you but you are taking this game too seriously anyways. Play something else bro
---
Ban hammer says bad luck 
---
Kinda reminds you of that trade-exploit glitch that never existed, brought out numerous people who said they've been "affected" by it.
---
Haha haha yes, it happened 
---
I was speaking to people like 900 hour guy. That’s a lot of time to play this game in 3 months.  I generally agreed with you man, I know that there are people who can industrialize this games systems with things like server hopping. Although a normie like me was always running out of acid. It’s hard to imagine having enough of that to smelt all that ore you server hopped for.
---
Oh I actually been there before and still have the [picture](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/547377761312964609/unknown.png) lol. 
---
Launched the game just to see if it was really the same one.
---
Well look at that!  [https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz) No way he got that much ultracite ammo without duping. 
---
Seems they had issue 
---
Thanks. That looks incredibly well done :)
---
No it didn't? I have a mule and I'm not banned. 
---
Did you get banned little one? 
---
You are right. Turns out it was removed by one of the mods 
---
Oh, just wait when the melee get's the nerf hammer.
---
so you'd go around and craft over 200k of some random ultracite just for carry weight convenience, and then mule it over to other characters (for more carry weight convenience? or what?). sounds like bullshit to me mate.
---
why the hell would you even be gathering any flux actively - at any meaningful rate - if all it amounts to is weight that you ultimately have to get rid of?
---
for example, i can fill my camp with a lot of mutfruits or tatos or whatever. i could make fucking bank on that shit, and easily get laughable amounts in a month. but why the hell would i? we're not talking about how much you can "possibly get if you try as hard as you can", we're talking about "what amount if reasonable for someone to have?".
---
all of your examples throughout this thread are only examples talking about how you can gain a lot of it, not why you would ever do that or what the reason is behind gathering something up that you have to stockpile on several characters.
---
to me, these just look like excuses or smoke. attempts at discourse from the real question: who at their right mind would continue to grind (either by buying on the market or going through nuke zones) materials needed - hop on servers back and forth between gyms for lead, sitting on the workshop near wavy waterpark for acid, EVERY DAY, for a whole month - producing ammunition THAT THEY ARE NOT EVEN USING to the point that they have to waste perks AND use mule characters to carry that ammunition.
---
i'm sorry but if that is true the guy has a SERIOUS mental illness. it's far, far easier to assume what's much more likely here: the high amount comes from the amount of duping, which doesn't let you dupe in whatever amount you want, but in higher integers (which works in a specific way); and this guy doesn't know shit, so he didn't dump the excessive ammo and instead used a mule to carry all that extra stuff.
---
EASY BRAIN. i can't believe there are some who still dispute this somehow.
---
No ma'am
---
Thank you (from Switzerland)
---
Same here, it’s tough when you play by the rules but here we are and banned they are 
---
Where/how do you get an Enclave one?
---
Upvote for exposing me to the term 'sub PvP' :)
---
So tell me about your one shot please. What’s the dmg on it?
---
500k nuka colas won't load fast enough to pick them up "accidentally". Cool story though.
---
Not us. NOT US.
---
I think you're very confused
---
You are right. Ever since the game release there was a big number of people actively trying to damage the game and Bethesda. I'm not sure they were actively organized. The "waves" in which these people come surely suggests that, so I can't rule out some organized effort by EA/Ubisoft/Rockstar/Obsidian. But my guess is indirect organization. More like a guy saw a friend or another guy from their community spread bullshit about the game and they decided to join since they both have negative opinion on Bethesda. And it's not hard to guess which communities are doing this. FNV fans are so toxic towards anything connected to Bethesda (despite FNV existing only because of Bethesda, ironic) and love to spread bullshit all over youtube (see the dumpster fire quality videos like "Fallout 3 is shit and here's why") and the comments there. They've even constructed their version of reality where everything wrong with FNV is Bethesda's fault. Those people are living in their own, twisted version of reality, so it's quite probable that they would go and spread lies just to keep their reality alive.
---
Really, Just look at the amount of bullshit spread right after announcement. Rust-clone, gank-fest, no NPCs. Later they added "no story", "no new assets" and "needs new engine" to their narrative. Yeah, like problematic engine didn't stop FNV from being their holy grail. And after launch it's just waves on bullshit trying to gain credibility due to mistakes made by Bethesda. They tried it with "multiple crashes per day" -  painting the game as more buggy than even the FNV which is the buggiest AAA game I've ever played. Then they saw that there are many exploits in the game and invested their "trade steal exploit". After one of the banwaves came they tried it with "I've got banned for using mods". Everytime they catch that the sub is getting restlest due to lack of news from the devs they create those "I'm disappointed at Bethesda. I'm uninstalling" drama queen posts. And now here we are yet again with fake ban posts. 
---
These people are so persistent with their attempts to shift the narrative against Bethesda that I've learnt to ignore every negative post here as a fake. And it must be even worse for the devs or community managers to search through tons of shit to find legitimate issues and concerns. It doesn't help the development of the game, but that's exactly what those trolls want. They want to see the game and the company burn and simple things like facts and truths don't stop them.
---
If your real life example were to be correct, it would have went something like this: you go into a shop and buy a t-shirt. This is now your shirt. Then the shop starts demanding that you only wear the shirt on even days of the month, and if you dont comply - they are taking back the shirt without a refund. Sounds absurd, doesnt it? 
---
Fantastic photo buddy :)

Actually, much more stupid than previously thought. People weren't banned for having mules. 
---
i make sure to always set aside some time for trolling on reddit even if i work 5 to 5 ^(please no downvote)
---
Dont get it ... So if you have over 100k of enything you will get banned,
---
 so how can someone with more than that get in the game and drop stuff ? Wouldent that person allready be banned ? 
---
Kinda reminds me of this reddit being filled with shills who commit fraud (a real crime) on a daily basis. 
---
Lul!
---
Brilliant. Love your honesty! You'll be kicked off the internet for that. Don't bring a blame-thrower to a ban-hammer fight. Should be a new saying!! 
---
I *think* you have to complete the Enclave questline. Alternatively, someone could craft you one. I think they usually go for 1 - 1.5k caps.
---
maybe they did it for witchhunting/doxxing reasons. someone might even have contacted an admin. i could totally see death threats flying about in this sub
---
They look duped to me
---
"I think Bethesdas track record shows something different. I think their  track record shows that they consistently put out quality content that  people enjoy." - White Knights
---
I LOLed
---
I don't ignore Bethesdas shitty deeds. I quit the game and happened to see this thread on the front page. I'm not saying that bethesda is doing a good job, I'm just trying to understand why you think flooding the game with duped rare items, knowing these will possibly get wiped, is a good idea.
---
Just because a person is be a piece of shit doesn't allow you to kill them. Just like although fo76 is a shitshow duping shouldn't be, and isn't, allowed.
---
Man, all you have to do is say something bad against dupers or exploiters and watch the down votes roll in. It's how I knew a couple months ago this sup was tainted. Personally I think they should have gotten perma bans, would have freed up the community of a lot of bad mojo.
---
No he has acquired that much ammo, it does not say he is currently in possession of it.  Trading it back and fourth by their standards would easily flag this.  In no way should any ammo be considered a rare item even ultracite ammo, it is 36 to 180x the amount of any other item, banning for ammo that you may have simply moved back and fourth while farming or killing the SBQ is asinine.
---
This still doesn't show he duped the ammo (and someone who is generally guilty doesn't post the evidence showing such).
---
I saw nothing, very sad.
---
But funny thing which I noticed- Lone Wanderer has 3 stars looking card but max level is 4. So you really could be right with Ammosmith lvl 3 and btw it worth checking.
---
This sub was always brigaded, you can tell because people post the same subjects over and over even when it's not a large complaint. They definitely come from some same-group. Maybe it's the Russians preparing for the 2020 election
---
"900 hour guy" is definitely going to become a meme
---
Not if you bought the shirt together with a contract that said when and how you are allowed to wear it,  
---
Your argument is about possession of an item. However, we are talking about how an item is being used.  
---
This could swing both ways here but I guess since the other posts were removed this guy might be telling the truth?
---
Sure buddy. I've got almost 300 hours into the game. I'm not banned and the ~~legitimate businessmen~~ dupers are, so who's really better at playing the game?
---
Good question, I haven’t seen an answer yet.
---
Lol op don't be dumb
---
I've read that post, ammo is by no means a rare resource,  even ultracite ammo, all this shows is he had a lot of ammo that he moved between alts,  doesnt even state he was currently in possession of anywhere near that amount, guilty people rarely tattle on themselves while proclaiming they are innocent.
---
I think we may be talking about different things. I’m not talking about the upcoming survival mode. I’m talking about PvE-*only* and PvP-*only* servers with each balanced for that mode, which would require characters being locked to the server type they were made for. Survival mode isn’t creating that afaik. 
---
I saw a level 2 yesterday. Name? Ban me again 76.
---
Yeah. After seeing the effort of many people to damage the game (and Bethesda) I automatically assume every single of these treads as being part of the same effort. Sorry, but even Bethesda is more believable at this point. Bethesda at least made mistakes and screwups on the way to make a genuine game, while these folks are just inventing fake after fake usually because they are upset that they won't ever see FNV 2
---
Just because you don't have faith in them doesn't matter, the op is clearly iether lying or exadurating let's assume it only took 2k flux ignoring every other requirements like hundreds of thousands of steel and lead assuming he spent 450 hours that's still 5 flux an hour at only 2k flux when it's likely two or three times that many that were used meaning he would need about 10 to 15 flux an hour at minimum for 450 hours which is over 50% off the 750ish hours in a month just to craft that much ammo legitimately.
---
P.s. it's all been crafted or traded by outside sources as the alt and main have different amounts both over the 100k though.
---
Is Bethesda perfect hell no, but saying "they have messed up before and people don't like them so let's all bandwagon on something we have no knowledge of" at best seems stupid, not fucking once yet has a negligent ban been proven most of the time it's something like this where the op admits he iether duped himself or used duped materials to make too many of a certain item and was rightfully flagged for it.
---
I use three weapons. Depending on builds and distance.
---
If the player is out of vats range, I use a bloodied explosive gauss rifle, that has a dps of 900 damage. 
---
If in vats range, I use a bloodied explosive lever action rifle which goes upto 600 damage. When I critical with it, It's almost a 100% one shot! unless the player is using max damage res. power armor plus dodgy. It's a crit followed by another shot.
---
In close range, I use a bloodied explosive handmade. I crit first shot, then spray.
---
I am a bloody explosive stealth sniper. I sit at only 25% health and highly depend on chameleon rather than  
---
I have a over 100k in ultracite.. it's not the ammo. Stop believing everyone's sob story. 
---
You can put a connector on a welcome mat, hook a wire to it and then move it.
---
Tell that to Russia
---
Removed not deleted and I'm still attached to the post.  While his post was removed the picture he himself put up of the ammo is there, but it in no way says he was in possession of the ammo, just that he had acquired it, dropping it and picking it up would flag the same dam thing, I still think the guy didn't dupe the ammo, Bethesda has done nothing to earn anyone faith.
---
ultracite ammo don't drop
---
Justifying people for using exploits when they know they shouldn't is like justifying people speeding because their cars can go faster
---
The Death Star should be next
---
If you're actually legit don't worry. I craft/carry way more stuff than that and I haven't been banned (nor will I be). These people are full of shit.
---
I was kinda wondering the same thing. 
---
Same. I feel as though the last decent game they put out was Oblivion and I will still take that over FO4 and Skyrim any day of the week, both were substantially sub-par by comparison. 
---
I hate melee and never played it in any Fallout game (and not planning to)...
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Read Bethesdas response, it states "acquired over the last 30 days" moving the ammo back and fourth at a few thousand rounds per move would flag it as obtained, Bethesda has still done nothing showing he has that much dam ammo on his characters.
---
I've done it but just have the officer outfit and hat
---
I feel you. Been playing with my son since the BETA and i created a second "mule" charactor to hold all our excess bagage. 
---
I can't see how BGS doesn't see a low level second charactor profile living not far from the vault is pretty damn obvious a mule stash box for hardcore players that think outside the box. Especially the stash box limit after no limit in all fallout series which is understandable but come on.. we loot and waste nothing. 
---
Anyway just supporting your voice on it. 
---
I was banned and i hope they fix it. 
---
I was already disappointed. 
---
Have a good one 
---
Batman?
---
Energy Weapons are not as good as Ballistic Weapons. We have no solid date of when that's going to change so I wouldn't hope for a buff any time soon. Plasma Cartridges are rare and heavy, but I wouldn't bother hoarding them, if you want you can try the Plasma Gun with the Flamer barrel as the dps on that is pretty good.
---
Nah man you just like to divide people so you posted this to try to get shit going. 
---
The bans are going great and Im joyous about it
---
Not for anyone was the last patch the last straw, not even the suspended players, and you know it. 
---
I've been wading thru these shit posts all night burning a work shift. You trolls have less than usual to work with but most have adapted, you are particularly pathetic with this grasping of straws. Honestly kid, even masturbation would be a more rewarding hobby than trying to get a rise out of adults on the internet. If you have to troll, atl east put some effort into it. 
---
And thanks for saying Im ALLOWED to enjoy the game, thats fucking magnanimous of you
---
No but it also doesnt say he has that much ammo just that hes acquired that much,  moving ammo between characters would flag the amount even if only moved a few thousand at a time.
---
Spin it?
---
Its call sarcasm mate.
---
I was taking the piss out of someone who was saying: "hey these guys all traded on a non-bethesda site, therefore they are guilty."
---
I was taking the piss out of them by pointing out the fact, there is NO OTHER OPTION TO FIND TRADING!!!
---
This is all true, but I don’t think you’re going to get *that* level of interaction from this platform. I just don’t believe the servers and software are robust enough to handle that much. At least not at this point. But I do agree you’d need to at least approach that in order to truly have a “no NPC” sort of world that Bethesda seems to want.
---
Sorry that they deleted your thread but we are interpreting the evidence differently than you.    What is your stance on the quantity of rare ammo you have?
---
Ban seems more like a favor after seeing those numbers
---
Nice! It's better than nothing
---
Sad but true
---
Enclave is great for a new caracter because +3 ST  means +15 carryweight.
---
If you just focus on leveling up fast, the Vault Suit raises +1 INT, so it slightly help with the won XP.
---
It will be cheaper to buy from someone. It should come from "Production", and I think the lining plans are there too. Unfortunately you have to buu the lowest, which unlocks 3rd tier, then 2nd, then 1st (shielded). Gets pricey!
---
https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz is a screenshot from bethesda.net telling 900 hours guy that it was the ammo that got him banned.
---
Care to revise you position of "It's not the ammo"?
---
Whoa you guys can see views?
---
Well, this is based on FO4, so that’s not surprising. But no actual choice is based on FO4’s crappy writing more than anything imo. They didn’t write it to *have* real choices. 
---
Where did you read that Bethesda banned people with mule accounts? Are you sure you know what a mule account is? 
---
At some point you get one of the underarmors (there are two, forest and urban) as a reward. The linings show up in the production vendor's inventory (not the military wing). 
---
&gt;normal game play.    
---
causal solo game play     
---
Bethesda did ban a huge chunk of the active players. For instance (5.) &amp; (6.) are totally legit but still would get you banned. That's why so many posts pop up. Sure there are a lot of exploiters getting banned which is good news, but on the other hand it seems than more legit players were affected than Bethesda may expected.
---
Hey I appreciate the response and understanding that we’re all just trying to figure out what’s legit or not and I agree I cant comprehend that people feel the need to hate when they haven’t even played it, seems ridiculous to me. 
---
One thing I’ll point out just to play devils advocate here.. I’m sure we’ve all had the experience where items we drop disappear from the world. And with the trading system the way it is, it’s much easier to drop the item and then sell 1 for the desired amount of caps. I could see a scenario where someone would choose to store the items they were trading in a container in the world to avoid this bug where their items disappear. 
---
I’m not trying to start an argument because it seems highly unlikely but it’s plausible because my friend does this every time because he doesn’t trust the game not to cause dropped items to fall through the map.
---
Hopefully you’ll see I’m just trying to keep it in perspective because at the end of the day I’ve crafted close to 60k .50 cal ultracite ammo and currently have close to 50k from trading and because after the TSE nerf you need a lot to slay the queen. I’m just saying there’s ways for the scenario you’re describing to play out, is it likely for all the coincidences to line up? Probably not, but it’s possible and now that the OP knows which items were in question hopefully we can get a legit response to explain it. 
---
Not trying to start an argument or take sides, just feel like when it comes to bans we should take everything into consideration. Stay blessed!
---
Green thumb super duper ammosmith and doing a lot of nukes.  That is all the ultracite combined.  If you play solo nothing else to do with flux...  I think it's possible. 
---
Because people like to run their mouth about the "game dying" even though they have no actual visibility into how much the game is being played and are instead projecting their dislike of the game onto the entirety of the player base.
---
That is irrelevant. It still sets a bad precedent. If you can't understand that, then perhaps you shouldn't open your mouth on matters such as this. 
---
I remember there used to be 2 options shown: pacify and tame. I only get pacify now but I assumed that’s because my budget is maxed out. So if my assumption is correct, make sure u have enough space in your budget and choose tame rather than pacify next time. 
---
I’m going to hold off judgement until I see what links that screen shot to 900 hour ago. No one has given an answer on that yet.
---
Check out my post history for some info on what's happening here.
---
Ah, I see you've met Rocky
---
I wonder why we don't just get the skill tree of fallout 4. Of course with the option to remove one point of a perk and select another one. Maybe even leave the skillpoint requirement out.
---
Imo it would be way easier to handle.
---
Probably it's only me, but i find the current system quite confusing. I don't have a good overview.
---
The only people who can claim to have been caught up accidentally in the ban wave are people who killed dupers, picked up their junk and dumped it somewhere else to keep them from getting it back. They're the only ones anyone should feel sorry for, but even then it's only a temporary ban and they'll be back soon.
---
If you're holding 100k+ of an item I think it just stands to reason you'd have a mule of some kind, otherwise you'd never be able to fast travel anywhere.
---
I don’t think there is a update today is there?
---
Is this satire? I cant tell anymore
---
Photomode. The best thing ever introduced to Fallout period.
---
I violated rule 2
---
Giggled just for the thought of it, bravo
---
Too much ultracite ammo, that shit *is* rare and he didn't get that much legitimately.
---
They don't need to prove their innocence to anyone. The people banning them already have all the proof they need.
---
I am legit. I think I just got needlessly sucked in by at all. Seemed to be an awful lot of people getting banned. Surely not that many have "cheated"?
---
It's an online game. Anyone playing with someone else is playing favorites.
---
That seems normal. If anything, it sounds like you've previously been runninf an exploit to duplicate frames to make your instance run smoother. Shame. 
---
Not justifying the behavior, if you bother to read my post, just saying that this all could have been avoided had Bethesda actually...well, done anything correct. The white knighters gonna hate because Bethesda can do no wrong. I believe that this ban wave has false positives, tbh, because otherwise they wouldn't have included the "We'll unban you after we fix the glitches." in the emails people are getting. Just a blanket suspension on anyone suspected, guilty or not to try to flail around and damage control because they have no idea what they're doing. Bring the downvotes if you want.
---
I prefer 2 underarmors. 
---
Shielded Harness: 3 agility, 3 perception, 1 luck
---
Shielded Brotherhood (black one): 2 strength, 3 endurance 
---
Both look really nice, so much so to the point where i dont even wear a chest piece on my character. Brotherhood is nice for carry weight and hp. Harness is nice for female characters without chest piece equipped ;) 
---
IIRC the next big patch is today, I think. Or was today just maintenance and it's actually next week?
---
That was round 1. This is apparently round 2, where people who had 100,000 or more of rare items are getting TEMPORARILY banned until the duping exploit is fixed.
---
Dr Evil is that you? From Rockstar or Respawn? Your plan coming to fruition? 
---
wowzers ya got me
---
Enjoy your ban!
---
No the patch is this week but I think tomorrow.
---
Bruh you have been salty af all fuckin day, are you okay?
---
Where did 900 hour guy post this? You haven’t clearly answered that. 
---
this isnt an email i received, its the 900 hours guy at the top of reddit. he explains everything pretty well.
---
There is.   
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language=en)
---
Basically demonstrating the extreme reactions from the ban wave and the accusations and assumptions made by many. 
---
I burn through a good 5k 10mm a day.
---
Guess I have an allergy to hypocrisy.
---
I have more hours than you do and I'm not banned either even though I likely have just as much ammo as the 900 hour guy, that's why I think it's full of shit. I'm definitely better, hence why I know all these things that are normal that you've oblivious about.
---
Well, my reasoning for trusting Bethesda:
---
Bethesda made some screwups while trying to make a genuine game
---
vs
---
Players (alleged players) make fake posts about exploits, bans and state of the game.
---
Bethesda made a game I really enjoy
---
Players (alleged players) are actively trying to bring the game down
---
Sorry, but Bethesda wins 2:0 here. If the question was trust Bethesda or not, I'd be hesitant to express my trust. But if we pit Bethesda against alleged players, I know who I'm rooting for. If that's not enough, than look at what gamers have done for bullshit outside of Fallout. They've brigaded reviewers who dared to give RDR2 scores lower than 10/10. They've insulted developers by asking if a game is "an out of season April fool's joke" while not being able to stomach the similarly snarky reply. They've banded against Jason Schrier just because he dared to call the gamers out on their bullshit.... that's just from the top of my head. There's certainly more that happened. And I should trust these people? If we look at Bethesda, they are one of the worst when it comes to quality and the execution of the games, but they are also one of the most genuine and passionate developers out there...
---
Yeah, go cry to mom duppers and cheaters, let the game rise without you.
---
Ok but how is OP linking this particular image to 900 hour guy?
---
I add stuff too!  The game is sort of like a treasure hunt.  Besides, can’t sell ammo or patterns to vendors so why not make someone’s day.....
---
That’s uh LEGENDARY BUTTHURT..
---
lmao. That would be overkill. 
---
Fyi, a simular scenario to this one. A friend of mine who started new was getting slapped around to death by a level 80 dude. I told him not to hit back until I arrive. The moment I reached, the guy slapped him to death lol and began bagging and shooting his body, making it roll. I crouched my way to them and one shotted him out of his bounty. He had loads of bulks on him and I took it all. Then he tried to pvp me for the items. I killed him 3 time in a row. He send me a message saying, I have 10 seconds to give him back thw stuff or I could kiss my account goodbye. He put an ip address from his @$$ and said this is your IP address. lol I reported him and he was immediately dealt with by psn network.
---
Yup, but only on desktop as far as I know. 
---
Oblivion was decent by what standards?
---
No one's buying it. You can stop now.
---
I do appreciate the creativity of these dupers to pull at heart strings. For example I liked the one duper pitty party post where she not only included her headshot but her Instagram. 
---
Don’t think there are.  My friends and I got scorch beast credit by going to Survey Camp Alpha, tagging the beast and letting the anti air artillery kill it. 
---
Don't believe everything you read
---
You've been posting about shills for like 10 hours, my dude. Take a nap or somethin. 
---
Thursday's Inside the Vault only showed things that is going to be updated in upcoming time, hopefully at the next 2 hours.
---
You can’t say everybody on that list
---
Though I believe around 80% is guilty of duping. I still believe there was some innocent people suspended also. I know for a fact my brother was one.
---
Remember they said only 1% of player base was guilty. I promise you more then 1% where suspended..
---
Fireproof makes the damage almost nil 
---
It’s mind boggling to me hearing their explanations.  I mean, who has 100K of anything in their possession?  Heck, who has 10K of anything in their possession?
---
Either you duped weapons or junk or you got in on it.  Bottom line, you deserve to get banned.  For those of us that had to grind and craft and acquire and level up the old fashioned way (work and effort) it’s good to know they are doing something about it.  
---
A lot of them have admitted to duping or trading with dupers. Others have been outed by their own post history or by videos on their youtube/stream channels.
---
It is hard to fuck up a database query that is looking to see if you've had 100k of a rare item in the last 30 days. A lot of sob stories trying to garner sympathy. People that cheat also lie, especially if they have nothing left to lose. If you're legit you are perfectly safe my man.
---
It might just be because server stability is just that shitty you know.
---
You mean biased?
---
‘If they upvote me they agree with me, if they downvote me it proves they are just haters. Haha, I can’t lose in my own head!’
---
I think we should just have a refrigerator that keeps food from spoiling indefinitely and possibly just restores the food “health” if it’s low. There’s all these neat foods to craft but no one will go out of their way to do it if it goes bad before you even need to really use it.
---
you can't contact bethesda support on the website if your account is banned.
---
Spell crafting, lore, conjugation, dark brotherhood, mele fighting, the intro, just to start. Every aspect of that game was better aside from graphics. Every game since they has felt watered down to appeal to a larger crowd of simpler people. 
---
You were banned for a reason.
---
Build a bridge and get over it.
---
This!
---
Bump! And upvoting. 
---
Zenimax and bethesda control access and the game.
---
You bought a license to play the game  not to exploit it.
---
Please remove the cap charge for fast travelling. It's pointless, annoying and removes the fun and adventure of exploration. It makes the game like current real life (the unpleasant bits). This is especially annoying because, when we get killed, we are forced to respawn at inconvenient places with no choice allowed and get charged for it. It sucks. 
---
Bullshit.   I’m not sure it’s even possible to craft or purchase that amount and type of ammo unless 1) you got caps illegally or 2) you duped the ammo yourself.  Or 3) you happened to find it in a suitcase but picking it up seems to be an intelligence test.  
---
wtf? I'm not even saying I'm in one of those categories but those are example of false bans...      
---
If you don't think so bring up valid points why you wouldn't get banned for. From my friendlist I can tell you would I even explained why &amp; what might caused the ban.
---
Really liked the mannequins in FO4 would be nice to have in FO76 
---
The email doesn't say crafted.  It says 'acquired'.  Crafted and bought, and for the non ultracite ammo, found.  
---
Going by his time, that's over the span of 300 hours ( 1 month x 10hrs/day).  If he was buying/trading for ammo it's completely doable.
---
There was once a Hearthstone streamer, Kripp. He would always play draft, and when he lost because the guy had an OP deck, he would claim that they were stream sniping him. It happened so much that he thought there must be a group doing it. 
---
Eventually after at least a year of this, a viewer sends him a discord link or something of people who were talking about what time he was streaming, what kind of decks they were able to put together, if anyone had an old deck from a previous expansion they could use, etc.
---
This is just mostly a silly anecdote, and maybe he set up the group himself for drama, but the idea remains that if it seems like a string of users are constantly barraging the same, it is possible that there is a large group that they are part of
---
It doesn't take much acid first off, secondly if you don't know why I have this ammo, then you're better off not making assumptions right? Buying/selling/trading would be the most common sense answer- why would anyone store anything they aren't using on another character except for those common sense reasons. Not my fault you don't see it.
---
I don't gather flux actively, it's something I do while I'm in a nuke zone because I'm already there- again common sense, why do you collect anything anywhere in the game?
---
You have a example of why you think it's pointless to collect or gather absurd amounts of things- you're playing a game full of hoarders that 600 pounds of storage along with character space isn't enough.. who the fuck are you to decide who should gather how much before it's absurd? Especially if it doesn't weigh anything?
---
There probably are mentally ill people that play this game, but you're trying to create an imaginary "crime" that somehow fits the finished because you say it isn't logical. I think that's silly, are you mentally ill?
---
Assassins Butthurt!
---
Oh damn lol
---
80% guilty of duping is way off, probably around 20% and the other 60% of your 80% guilty of making a bad decision and picking up stuff they probably shouldn’t have
---
Been wanting one since BETA.  My son wants to have a wasteland cafe.  He’s been gathering recipes from day 1.  Food spoilage kinda makes it hard to have anything but tea and soup.
---
OOTL can someone ELI5?
---
Yeah, I basically planned my build poorly, so I'm trying to respec and create a melee build. 
---
 I have my messages set to friends only because I kept getting spam in my messages. I'm not sure how common it is for people to send messages like that because I don't get them. If I did I'd report them I'm trying to enjoy gaming not deal with BS
---
Definitely not longer than 76 notes combined. 
---
Nice hyperbole though.
---
Maybe you should go play Anthem bud. Or, *gasp* post in their subreddit. 
---
I didn’t when I posted above, I don’t think the full details were released however yes I’ve since seen the full story. It is poor to go on a faux outrage rampage when you’ve been part of the problem and caught fair and square. 
---
Good riddance; 
---
I'd be happy if they just didn't penalize DR in in PA for some under-armors (BOS,Marine, and Raider UA all incur a significant DR penalty if worn with PA).
---
His original post which got deleted he said he spent that time collecting it and crafting it. Not to mention his ban happened before the duping ban wave happened. yet he tried to make it as if the sweeping ban wave picked him up unfairly. Some were saying he even admitted that he had duped in a threat he had 10k up votes on that he deleted.  
---
Bethesda is not flagging you for crafting components. They explicitly mentioned things like ammo, armor, weapons, nuka cola, etc. Also, they are going through your actual inventory list so chances of getting flagged by this is low, if not none.
---
I hope this begins a permanent landmark in the community. 
---
Fallout 76 2
---
“We all had a really powerful shotgun”
---
Sounds suspiciously like duped TSE
---
Can please has link?
---
Twin lakes has a gaurenteed behemoth spawn. West of the map marker, in a lake.
---
&gt;I used to hunt dupers,
---
So you "hunted" people you knew were cheating, then kept all the stuff they dropped that you knew was created using exploits.  In other words, you were intentionally seeking to acquire stuff you knew was created with exploits. How are you not a cheater?
---
I wish players could temporarily mark themselves as vendors for this sort of role play. I would gladly buy from other players that enjoy plan collecting and cooking. I have set up a little trading post but can only ever sell to players that wander by and see my shop setup.
---
I commented to respond to the deleted comment above but 900 hour guy posted his own e mail. 
---
He didn't remove his post or it would say deleted, it's more likely after he posted the conversation Bethesda community managers asked for the post to be removed.  This would further support his story because the only reason to remove his post is because of the traction it's getting against Bethesda.
---
The disparity would be there as a lot of the ammo would be crafted on his main some of it getting used before ever getting swapped to his alt, therefore his main would have more, vice versa if he stored the crafting mats on his alt the same would be possible.
---
Why would he need a 3rd party when he said numerous times he plays 2 accounts and has multiple characters as mules on his second account to trade to himself.  You cant hold all that ammo and since the materials to make ultracite degrade you need to make the ammo then move it to an alt then get it back when you want to fight a SBQ and utilize that ammo.
---
I understand if all of this is above your comprehension tho dont feel bad about that, not everyone understands common sense, btw he could very well be guilty of duping, but large amounts of ammo is by no means rare and shouldnt have ever been in with the same number limitations as the required amount of actual rare items to get banned.
---
He posted it himself
---

Seriously. PlAyInG tHe gAmE cIrCuMvEnTiNg pLaCed MeChAnIcS HuR dUrRrRr
---
I do believe there is few people innocent. I’m sure Bethesda will make it right.
---
Yes the more I read about it all,  the more people seemed to have actually been legitimately banned. Seems to be, like you said, sob stories. I never cheat in games apart from if I'm really stuck on something I'll Google it.  But then only having tried myself countless times. Never seen the point. It takes all the fun out the game. I like to take my time and enjoy the game. No need to exploit to jump up a few (or lots)  levels. We all get there in the end and especially with a Fallout/Skyrim type game the faster you rush the more you miss. 
---
I'm a raider and a trader, still have my account lol
---
Before I vote..
---
Can I ask what was the point of hunting duper’s 
---
if you’re gonna loot their rotting corpses? Lolz
---
Ya didn’t dupe items but you robbed duper’s of their duped items. 
---
Isn’t the outcome the same, as buying duped items? 
---
How you got it doesn’t justify. It means you’re just as dirty. Lolz
---
It's on the internet, thus is fact. No need to delve deeper.
---
Lolz bump and upvoting for quoting scorched 
---
Lul

he deleted his post.
---
Cheating = Easy win with no (apparent) consequence = More cheaters
---
That was the thought process of cheaters till now. Occum's razor: Sub is filled with cheaters.
---
It's the level 50 you get from legendary drops not hard to get. I actually got mine at level 30 and stored it until I could use it. 
---
100% duping, you can all claim w/e you want but he was duping, fact. 
---
You're probably fine as long as you haven't duped or acquired a dubious amount of rare items.
---
I know this post is old, but where can you find Radscorpions?
---
Actual no he didn't the post was removed as is evident by the word [removed] where his post was and not [deleted] 
---
In BETA I lived my game life over encumbered.  It wasn’t until they increased the stash size that I was able to consistently stay under the weight limit.  I’m a hoarder, I need a 12 step program or something.  Perhaps we could hold weekly meetings in Flatwoods?
---
I think I have around 700 hours so I don't doubt your time :)
---
All you’ve explained here is that it’s a high level drop from a legendary enemy. And if it is a guaranteed drop it most likely had a name.  
---
20% blatant dupers (deserves)
---
20% innocent (don’t deserve)
---
60% acquired/kept (not innocent) (grey area)
---
This happened to me.
---
Except a nuke hit the area so I didn't have to worry about respawn.
---
There's enemies that drop acid, some drop adhesive, you simply go where they are, I think 900 hour guy actually mentioned where to get some. And you don't have to server hop unless you need an absurd amount, you can make tons of ammo in a single run. Can't remember the name off hand, but button left of the map at the very southern most industrial icon there's tons of ore nodes you can grab from on the walls facing north. If you continue going south while looking for North facing walls you'll find tons.
---
Acid resource (3 of them) at a workshop West of the water park up north. You don't even need much, a few hours each day sets you up for a while.
---
I certainly didn't see prominent modders of those games (who actually has done something to the game's longevity) got banned.
---
Can’t play Fallout 76 what else can they do besides throw hate and excuses 
---
I’m sorry but I have to ask:  what is an instigating super sledge?
---
I think that’s probably the most accurate statement and estimate of the situation.
---
Yea I wonder about that too why does my Lone wander perk card have 3 star to max unlock but you need 4 charisma points to use it.
---
He has actually posted it on his thread. The thread is back up with a half assed "oh please sympathy me" explanation to how he has "nowhere near that amount of ammo but he can't check as he's banned" like Bethesda don't have it all stored in their DB.
---
You have a source for those numbers?
---
It's my feeling that 85% of numbers on the internet are fabricated 100% of the time.
---
While I agree that it’s good they’re removing accounts that have abused exploits, this game is so beyond repair I can’t imagine myself ever saying that I have no problems with it...
---
Check his post, it's back up. He posted it himself in his edits.
---
I don't know the name of all the weapons. I have not played this game in months as we got tired of the glitches and stuff. I could prob log on and find the name in my stash where it's stored. 
---
Haha to item #10
---
The thread is back up
---
Mods deleted it apparently 
---
You are better off starting a new character to try the min/max stuff out
---
Rough estimate. I do know some people like my brother got suspended. He doesn’t Dupe and hasn’t played since Christmas. Bethesda said 1% of player base where dupers and etc. I believe the ban wave was for more the 1% of player base. In my opinion and Guesstimation.
---
o no my bag
---
Yes because I have that same ammo in a higher quantity than his.
---
r/prequelmemes
---
I'm active on trading subs and have vast amounts of weapons and armor. Believe it or not, it's possible to trade your way into high tier weapons. I started when I was level 40 selling ammo and junk. Became an armor vendor after farming whitesprings during nukes. For a while I was using TSE weapons like currency because of the cap limit. Never duped anything, just grinded my way through and knew how to make deals. This sub doesn't understand how these vast quantities of items are seemingly possible and sometimes easy to come by in the trading circle. 
---
But ammo-boi does seem like a stretch, but I don't think we can discount all reports just because it would be impossible to do as a solo player
---
Yep you’re crazy. 
---
Bethesda and zenimax spells out the tos before you agree to install.
---
If you don’t read the ELA or disagree with parts of the TOS, and get banned don’t blame them for you breaking your end Of the TOS.
---
Thing irritating me most on this sub is if you got banned your a blatant duper/cheater and the scum of the earth when in reality the mass isn’t innocent or terrible but in the middle (same applies to everyone saying their innocent)
---
I can’t. Because I don’t know of any game that’s like it at all. It’s that unique. All I can say is watch some streams it just play it. It’s a free game the worst that happens is you uninstall!
---
&gt;Never used as an alibi
---
Then what did you mean with this? 
---
In https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arzs0d/the_new_ban_complaint_is_just_the_newest_lie/ someone asked "But how they prove they weren't duping? Or using exploits?"
---
Your response: "By posting guides on reddit after playing for 900 hours."
---
That is likely where people are getting the idea you wrote the article to cover yourself.
---
Sometimes when the house is deadly quiet, and my girlfriend is trying to concentrate on something I’ll randomly blare out “Iiiiiiiiits Grafton dayyyyyy....... Agaaaaaiiiinnnnn”
---
But Andy took all that duping money an made a better life for Red and himself in Zihuatanejo!!!
---
There is a system that checks inventory they've said so.. Get 100,000 of an item in a 30 day period and it's ban time. 
---
Maybe, i hope that is the case lol
---
For what it's worth I don't even care if it was duped (I dont think it was and think the same that it was moved back and fourth) its frecking ammo, how is that a rare item in this game.  You can reliably farm for insane amounts of even ultracite ammo and make a few thousand of it in a few hours, you can not do the same with bobbleheads or magazines.  It's a craftable ffs, not a world drop only obtainable on occasion randomly. 
---
Yeah my brother was banned hasn’t played since Christmas. He had steel cement and Stimpacks on a mule. He crafted and then diluted all Stimpacks.
---
He never duped I 100% know that as a fact and will edit a post explains his case after I post.
---
I mean it says he has 140,000 rounds on his primary account, the wording makes it sound like he still has that much which would indicate he didnt just pick some up, also i said removed in my comment you replied to.  
---
Im not saying this is entirely the case but bethesds are now looking into his ticket so they will be able to tell
---
Bethesda doesn’t own Reddit.  They’re completely independent of each other. 
---
If I was a Reddit CM I’d be pissed at your accusations.
---
I never said I got banned? I'm just saying that they created this problem. Put the pitchfork away man.
---
Nah, I'd rather believe the people playing the game still over a company that destroys its IP for money.  They have hearts and souls, even if some of them are lying it's folly to believe everyone is lying and that Bethesda's autoban net, like many others before theirs, doesn't falsely ban people.
---
Whenever you automate anything, shit goes unintentionally wrong, just look at Watoga.
---
900 hours guy is probably innocent but got hit for maximum efficiency, playing their game like the nolifiest of nolifers, (no offense 900 hour guy) and managing a lot of ammunition in the process.  Dupers hit weapons, armor, aid items, not just ultracite ammo.  Their language indicates their measurements take the last 30 days of items info and tallies it up.  If you can manage 200k ammo in 30 days from maximizing efficiency in a game you love and played for 900 hours within 4 months, that's not legitimate proof of duping to me.  If he had 500k ammo I'd be nopeing my way out, but 200k with perks and a clear efficiency routine, naw I can believe it.
---
OP is probably innocent, and some others are, but not all.  Don't lump everyone together, unless you'd like to be treated like crap too.
---
Interesting story. So the streamer was targeted and he was on the outside from what the group was doing? 
---
I've seen super mutants drop lots of 500 5mm ammo. So if I picked up twenty of those, or crafted, for 1000 ammo, then dropped and picked that up 100 times over a course of 30 days, I'd be banned ? 
---
Couldn’t agree more! You can achieve some great shots and cinematography, particularly in Photomode but also by dropping the HUD out of regular gameplay.
---
I’ve been taking DVR footage and dubbing audio clips over... take a [look](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) 
---
Thanks. I'll pass that back.
---
Today.
---
900hour guy posted it himself, it's right there in the thread he made. Not even difficult to find.
---
It comes down to 37.5 days played........ Bethesda's servers for FO76 aren't even that consistent 😂
---
"This account was found exploiting the following items" is not the same as "this account was found to be possessing the following items".
---
In my opinion whether it was duped or not isnt even an issue, the fact they include craftable ammo in a search for excessive items shows how poorly they are executing the bans.  Even ultracite ammo is craftable and can be crafted 2k to 4k at a time after an hour or so of farming a nuke zone, why would that be considered the same as 100k bobbleheads.  I've had maybe 50 bobbleheads in a couple hundred hours yet I've had well over 50k to 100k ammo in the same time.
---
If he honestly felt he was wronged he wouldn't remove it. Even moreso when supposedly the company at the heart of this would be the one asking
---
Also if he had the materials on his main to craft said ammo on demand why the hell wouldn't he just craft on demand? Instead of just randomly trading it?
---
Love how you call me stupid when in the same post you say stable flux decays.(it doesn't I've had flux in my storage for over a month)
---
Honestly not sure what 2 accounts would matter if he was on PC he may be able to run two instances of the game to trade with himself but that's a MAYBE at best on PS4 or Xbox that would be impossible without two full gaming systems copys of the game and such.
---
He posted the picture himself, but deleted the post afterwards.He got an answer from Bethesda regarding the reason of his ban because he got like 10K upvotes.
---
I’m gonna fill it up with shitty one-stars I’ll never use and bone shards then start complaining two days later about how the stash limit is too small.
---
Lol, I called him out too. Didn’t bother checking if I got downvoted cause I know this sub eats up b.s like that 
---
Pretty much 👍
---
Yeah I said tomorrow by my timezone, but yes it's today by US times.
---
You can't just say this without any evidence...
---
"How did you know he was a duper? It's perfectly do able for him to have the a tse instigating weopon for every ammo type and 87 of each serum and 23,000 nuka quantems. I get tired of people calling out 'dupers'"
---
Found like 3 of these in venture camp last week - I'm dumping Technical Data for BoS radiant quest and seen mod many times there.
---
Did Abraham Lincoln say that? That sounds familiar. 
---
I know I’m safe because I didn’t go out of my way to find out how to dupe. Still don’t know how to do it. Don’t wanna know, the temptation would be too great.
---
Where does it say past 30 days. Past 30 is your problem. It’s any 30-day period. 
---
If you’re Xbox I can help you out after work.
---
I know, but I'm trying to do anything to fix this, and I understand your skepticism, thank you
---
I haven't played 76. I wanted to until I heard the terrible state it was in and the apparent ease of being banned. I have played fallout since the first game (straight out of vault 13). I was willing to forgive the murdering of fallout lore if the game was good.
---
But... Even with places almost giving away the game I don't think I'll ever end up playing it now. What a tragedy Bethesda.
---
Sounds interesting but camps should be safe zones, i dont want to deal with that shit while im building my camp for the nth time
---
ok then I take it back. 
---
Still 360.000 ultracite ammo? 
---
Ultracite Shotgun Shell x24
---
Pure Fluorescent Flux - 1
---
Ultracite - 1
---
I dont know what the rate is for 45. but this means he used 15.000 flux and ultracite. With 900 hours played it means he found 17 Flux and Ultracite "per hour" - every hour.
---
How?
---
Did you not read any of the comments? 
---
Now I only need a machine that products ballistic fiber.
---
Rekt
---
This sub definitely is not representative for the fanbase of this game. The people here wish it was, but it isn’t. There are a lot of other subs where the subscribers are not whiny bitches, who think they are the only ones Beth should listen to. But the bottom line - like it or not - this shithole of a sub is not representative for the fanbase. Not even close.
---
you are awesome, thanks for helping :D
---
The inner game dev and modder in me really wants to know how this is done, but I also don't want it to be widely abused...
---
Read Bethesda response, it states account not character. 
---
Same sh!t different sub, banwave happens, people get banned, then all the exploiters go on their preffered exploit forum, band together and start making posts like the one above. 
---
Tactic has been used about 20 million times now
---
ok....but what if you don't like to wear dresses or think that black green and gold color combo is so last years style?
---
Read the Bethesda response, it says account meaning all characters 
---
I'm just a lowly lvl 35 and I love to do this too and sometimes there's something hidden that I need too!
---
There's actually a location in game that alludes to this somewhere..
---
you'd have to have a squad of 8 people all picking flux at fissure site prime and you're looking at 22 violet flux per person if they have the HR fluids, hardened mass, and glowing mass. They'd have to jump server after every fissure site prime nuke, so you'd have to nuke FSP 40 times to get to the violet flux necessary to support the amount of rounds to get near 100k. Shortest I think you can narrow it down to is 15 minutes per nuke, so something like 10 hours of game play with a dedicated group that all shove their ammo crafting off to one person. All of that ignoring the steel and lead required to get support this with high yield ammo crafting (like 5mm/50 cal) or the glowing mass, hardened mass, and HR fluids. I keep a good amount on my characters, but nowhere near enough to craft 7000 fluxes. It'd probably have to be violet flux too, since that's the highest ultracite ammo yield. You could do it with 5.56, but that'd be even more of a grind.
---
Not saying it's impossible, but highly improbable.
---
‘I can’t be excited about my loot because someone else has the good item’
---
I read a few?
---
Cool. Missed that part. 
---
Read the Bethesda response. It says account not character. It counts across accounts. 
---
&gt; Have you been keeping track of who has actually been complaining about it? 
---
nope, but the number of people claiming a false ban is higher than it has ever been with literally any other game ever, I am on multiple game's subs and have never seen this amount of claims of false bans, combine that with FO76's track record...
---
&gt; If Bethesda had fucked up to a degree where they were false positive  flagging accounts for all of the simple crap people are claiming they've  done this entire subreddit would be flooded with complaints. 
---
it literally is
---
Ban hammer says Bethesda account meaning all characters 
---
I bought $5 Polish thumbsticks and got canvassed for free.

Whiny ass bitch, naps won't help...

I wanted to be as transparent as possible, I'm sorry you feel they distract from the issue, I think having my picture on there takes away from the issue, but I didn't know it would put my profile pic up for the websites I posted, but it only shows on mobile
---
Upvoting because I want assassins lolz
---
Stay out DUPER!
---
Only thing that would be better is something like rockstar editor from gta v. Recording gameplay footage and being able to edit it after with custom camera angles and stuff to make mini movies would be awesome in fallout 76. I know there are ways to do it in fallout 4 on pc but I loved that gta v had it on console. Spent so much time playing around with that. Like photomode but better
---
That's some good info, thanks.
---
Enemies already routinely spawn near camps, it's already a feature. That's why people place their camps near cliffs and build upwards, so the enemies spawn out of aggro range. Is that cheesing? No, but I prefer to live on the ground, in the Bog. Let the muties, ghouls and Sierra bravos come
---
Where does it say the last 30 days. The email says 30 day period. That’s at any point. 
---
I think it's fun to go "bug hunting" and seeing what bugs there are, I was actually expecting more bugs in FO76, but now I'm suspended and that's worse
---
Unless they can be made much bigger. 
---
You're jumping to conclusions.
---
An application crashing "just for me" does not mean it's their machine definitely, it certainly isn't "dust in the fan"(?)
---
It's quite possible it's actually the way they're using the software is wrong or different from anyone else.
---
In this case, OP are you using the threat detection HUD mod on your power armor helmet? (The one that makes enemies glow red). This is a known specific cause for crashes which I can vouch for.
---
It totally works. I'm using it every day to get the challenge for 76 events in group.
---
Okay but most people with mules didn't get banned. I have multiple accounts and mules (not duping tho) and I'm not banned on anything. Same for my friends who didn't dupe or pick up any duped items. They are going to town on players who had more than 100,000 or more of rare items. I can make as many characters or "mules" as I want, it's not gonna break the terms of service unless I actually *cheat*. 
---
Downvoting because you didn’t say you were wrong, just editing your post 
---
A little dramatic for 3 crashes. Especially the “they’ll never fix this game” comments considering the original state of the game. 
---
They are clearly showing progress, example, youre here complaining about only 3 crashes... 
---
It was nice having you in the community though! Bye!
---
Endless horde events. Protect a thing against wave of increasing difficulty. Better loot for higher tier reached before the team dies.
---
&gt; I don't believe this "false positive" bullshit for a second.
---
I like how people are so quick to dismiss people being falsely banned with Bethesda's track record of doing such a *fantastic* job with this game.
---
I found a random drinking fountain once that had that same texture on the water. I immediately decided against drinking from it. Any water that glows purple can’t be good for you
---
Yeah and I'm not even banned. How'd you like them apples? Bet you'd love to gloat about that.
---
It's rare now that a perk pack actually adds to my collection, it's pretty depressing
---
I play loads of pvp of destiny and I am near the top 1%. I love reading salty messages, it's kind of like feedback that you are doing it right.

You missing the best underarmor of them all! The officer suit.  Carry weight and HP!

Shielded Brotherhood Officer Suit: 2 Str, 3 End.  13/9/5

Shidlded Harness: 3 Per, 3 Agi, 1 Luk. 10/5/0
---
Thanks. I have heard about that workshop. But it’s such a drag to have to keep going back to it every few minutes to collect. To me, it completely gets in the way of whatever quest I was doing and ruins any immersion or fun. I know snallygasters have a lot, but I’ve only been able to find 2 at a time, and even then they are rare to see compared to most other enemies. Perhaps my perception of the time it would take to quickly pump out a bunch of ammo is wrong. I know other players can optimize all that to a crazy degree. But all that stuff is not fun to me, and would make the game feel more like a job. 
---
But are you jake and wear khakis? Lolz
---
This would be such a simple addition for content for them to add. ESO already has it, though. Maybe they didn't want to straight up "copy" their other game's content?
---
All these posts about people "crying innocent" are hilarious, actually believing Bethesda hasn't somehow fucked up this ban wave and banned innocent players, yet complaining and hating on every other fuck up they do.
---

Charleston is about a 2 hours drive but Helvetia is a bit far away. Would be about a 2-3 hour drive to Helvetia
---
Yeah but don't you know, some players have 900+ hours in the game, run the Scorchbeast queen 80 times a day (expending 50 thousand ammo each fight) and spend all their time/resources crafting ultracite ammo that they don't use. It's like, totally legit for someone to have 200-300k of an ammo type, they're just really serious about needing that ammo for a rainy day. Feeling so bad for these legitimate and casual players caught up in an indiscriminate ban wave that has so heinously and falsely banned them... lul.
---
i disagree with this. i want my camp being attacks hard once every 2 hours. 
---
Lol 😂
---
My rifleman has been feeding my heavy gunner supermutant dropped 5mm for a while now. Currently have over 20k. No ban yet.
---
i am only a level 40 after playing 110 hours, most of my weapons are shit and i can probably only craft about 500 bullets max per playing session but i don't have the idea that your posts are crap or that you are a scammer.  the way you explain yourself do give me the impression that you might be "innocent".    anyhow, your guide was helpfull and i hope you can continue playing.
---
The idiots here tend to think Bethesda has done a perfect job with the ban wave and that no innocent player could have possibly been banned, what with their perfect track record for Fallout 76.
---
*Good ol' Bethesda couldn't have possibly fucked this one up.*
---
What’s the difference between crafting and duping? Banned! Lolz
---
A machine called KLEO
---
Like copying fallout 4?
---
Okay but he didn't cheat to get the items he got. So he shouldn't have been banned in the first place. 
---
The temp ban thing tells me exactly how confident Bethesda is in no false positives (they aren't). Otherwise if they had proper evidence internally, the bans would be permanent, especially after the item removal wave last week and people kept duping to trigger the ban.
---
I don't recommend "promoting" this way, as I've had no new followers at all, lol, promoting wasn't my intention at all, I just want to be transparent, I included my full name and phone number on all the emails and interactions I sent to bethesda as well, so hopefully that doesn't turn out poorly
---
I've seen a lot of supportive threads and some questioning the poster, it's hard to believe people you don't know, but the fallout community has been really supportive, which isn't surprising to me, I was one of the people that was so excited to play a multiplayer fallout game, because almost every interaction I have with fallout players online has been great and I was excited to be able to play with them
---
This thread is a great idea. It's so hard to drink all of their tears. They should all be collected in a single place like a wine glass.
---
Fallout 76 is not a subscription based game. Where did u even get that from? 
---
Hell yeah!
---
It exists.   I bought one post-patch.   I do not see it often.  I ether got it from Harpers or Watoga 
---
It was originally posted by him 
---
Cranky because you're banned aren't you
---
Because it starts out requiring 2 points at rank 1
---
lol really
---
Probably I'd either a high schooler or a dude with no life and no job... Or he has a job and only works 4 hours a day and spends every waking moment on the game. 
---
So you got banned for not having a life? Time to go outside and enjoy this blessing in disguise.
---
Interested in the facts on this one too.
---
I was banned but i was role playing as a magician with a magical box that doubled my items? Is Bethesda really trying to stifle roleplay in an RPG? So unfairrrrrrrrrr
---
&gt;you don't have to server hop unless you need an absurd amount
---
I mean he only had 360 thousand ultracite ammo on him
---
BREAKING NEWS: NASA has decided to use a new time standard they call the '76' standard, in which all clocks within the building and in their satellites are set relative to how often Fallout 76 fucks up, proving to be more accurate a measurement of time than the current standard for accommodating for GPS time relative drift.
---
Yeah I got that too somehow in mire.
---
It’s up there W/legendary explosive diarrhea 
---
Not sure I want my toon dripping all over my gear and myself during game okay 
---
Not really my point , just saying how you said originally that you had never had large quantities of duped rare items in your inventory , then on an older post (the one I linked) you say that you have stolen large quantities of rare items from duper’s.
---
Am I saying your ban is justified , no.
---
Am I saying that you’re un trustworthy , yes.
---
I strictly started and completed that mission during the line in the sand events.. kept server hopping and killing scorchbeasts. I had the surface to air missile launcher ding more damage than I was, but made sure to get some hits in there. there were a total of 4 scorchbeasts that did not count for me, but I kept at it. 
---
I am too 
---
No cause my friends weren’t cretans 
---
Yeah
---
That one was so weird
---
Like a picture of her exonerates her accusations 
---
What kind of person is made happy by the misery of others?
---
Yeah thats not been 100% proven. Even the 900 hours really doesnt add up. 
---
Just cranky about the game in general
---
&gt;I even preordered the game and purchased the second teir of the game so I could play beta, now I'm out that money, I did have fun playing it though, I'm sad they suspended me and hope I get it back soon
---
&gt; I’m sure Bethesda will make it right
---
This is Bethesda you're talking about.
---
My apologies as I meant to say this goes for any game including subscription based games, as people are under the impression that because they have paid for the game or are paying for the game that they have "rights" when in fact they can ban you without reason.
---
Serves you right for playing a piece of shit game
---
You are right I did mix a few things up.  
---
That said marketing and game development are two different groups within the company. Marketing would be the one to take care of the collectable set ups. While it would be development that would be dealing with bans. 
---
Video games are toys. Maybe grow up and don’t take toys so seriously, I dunno
---
I can confirm now I unlocked the BOS Helmet paint plans on an alt (Because OF COURSE) after scrapping only 20 light combat legs. The unlock order seems to be random but it does seem it is possible to get full BOS from strictly scrapping.  
---
INT was 12, Luck was 5. and i had scrapper equipped. IDK if that has an influence, but hey, the more ya know.
---
Again. How does this relate to the fact that cheaters got banned, and people protect them? Are you dissatisfied with the game? Ok, you can talk about this in another thread. You do not like the development of the game? You can create your thread about it. But you came here and write these thing... this is nonsence.
---
This thread **NOT** about game state, **NOT** about bugs, **NOT** about content. It's about **cheaters and bans.**
---
Nah
---
So either Bethesda is lying to people on why they are banned, or they are incompetent.
---
Both equally plausible.
---
My guess is both, they ran a script, and when random people got caught up in it, they started looking for any reason to type into the ticket.
---
Ass covering at its finest.
---
We all believe you, Jussie. You don't have to write another paragraph. 
---
You mean you had too many of the same rare weapons stacked up lol
---
I like how its the length of the notes that was hyperbole and not the 1 programmer part. 
---
okay, Jussie
---
Yeah, you concocted an elaborate mass of horse shit. Enjoy the ban?
---
sure, I "believe" Jussie too
---
derp 
---
I wonder why anyone would think Bethesda made a mistake?
---
He didn't. A moderator did. There is a sticky post stating that they are deleted all "I got banned posts".
---
Then I need to be able to put down more then 3 turrets before my budget is filled. 
---
I am. Very happy.
---
Isn't it a misery that *they* chose, after all?
---
I'm on PC but thanks anyway!
---
I am enjoying this banfest
---
Check Whitesprings train station. Many of us dump 1* legendary items due to lack of space and vendors being out of caps.
---
Also the ice machine by the big golf club is a frequent dumping place.
---
I too have heard that people from Crete are not to be trusted.
---
Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.
---
Dodgy people I tell ya; shifty.
---
He didn't delete it, it was removed by a mod and as you can see is now back. 
---
Also aww
---
He didn't delete his thread. A mod took it down. See how it's back up now? Maybe don't be a presumptuous asshole? 
---
Either your suggestion or given higher level turrets. I honestly dont even use turrets because of the budget thing. 
---
My God Bones, what have you done?
---
I’ve seen this message, however I suspect that we’re not actually *losing* ammo, it’s just that the game unnecessarily reports recent consumption of ammo.
---
For example, sometimes if you fire off three shots, then pick a flower, messages will report the flower, then the 3 bullets.
---
Have you checked the count of bullets left before and after the message?   I haven’t, so I could be wrong.   It’s just that the number in the message corresponds with the number of bullets I fired.
---
Oh. Well then give me a minute to change my thing cause I guess autocorrect snagged it 
---
How was I wrong, did I say that 900 hour guy was innocent?  No I didn't.  However regardless of that, without a valid source it is hard to say if the guy was right or wrong.
---
Having that uncertainty can break up a community pretty quick.  It's good to have transparency on these matters as it stops future FUD.
---
You need **less than 500 fluxes** for 100k ultracite .50 or 5mm. It's even possible to farm those solo.      
---
Ammo Smith 2: 180 bullets per Flux        
---
Super Duper 3: 30% Chance for 100 extra Bullets       
---
Combined thats 210 bullets per flux (180 + 100 x 0.3).          
---
Also: Let's assume you craft just half of those as .50 and a friend crafts similar amount of 5mm. Both of you had some ammo left and decide to help each other to transfer the new ammo to a mule until you need them. If so both of you would get flagged for having a total of over 100k over a time span of 30 days.
---
right, cos Bethesda hasn't given us one reason to believe they make mistakes...
---
Nooooo! Don't do that. You will ruin my pun! :P
---
Fuck yeah, I thought I was wrong but man - it's crazy how many people show up to defend the exploiters.
---
Yeah so it might be a year before they make it right lol..
---
He did contact costumer support. He exchanged 2 or 3 emails with him. They said they would relook at his account and let him know something with in 48-72 hours. Which is a much better result then I seen most people post. They also said Suspension where automated with their new back in systems.
---
I’m constantly surprised how people don’t understand that certain players do things differently. I launch 7 nukes a day on the queen and whitesprings and with my ammo perks it’s easy to craft that amount of ultracite ammo in a month. The 900 hour guy literally plays the game 10+ hours a day so I don’t see any reason he wouldn’t be able to do the same as well as loot bodies/trade to account for the other ammo. 
---
And everyone asks why you’d want that much ammo? It’s a fantasy world I don’t think logical explanations are necessarily the best route to approach this scenario. 
---
With super duper and ammo perk you can get 240 .50 cal per stable flux, collecting 500-700 stable flux in a month is child’s play and just because that’s not your play style doesn’t mean it’s not possible. Smh y’all need to put your pitchforks away and think through the role playing/trader aspects of this game a little more and what the implications of that are for people having mass stacks of rare items. 
---
Btw I’ve never duped, I’m not banned, and I apparently also don’t have this red haze over my eyes that most of the haters on here do who show just how big of scrubs they are by not understanding the game mechanics and how easy it is to obtain mass quantities of these items if you play 10+ hours a day. 
---
I said good day!
---
Fallout 76 is part of a long running franchise where its older entries are still played. Id like to see a complete FO76 capacity with some added content years down the line. 
---
I agree eith you that Anthem probably doesnt have legs. 
---
I gotcha lol 😉
---
No one is going to post for account reinstatement and actually admit to cheating. That would defeat the whole angle they're trying to portray.
---
Good point lots of oressure on the studio
---
Yes, cheaters, like children getting in trouble, have a million explanations for how it all could have gone down without it being their fault. You can just stop now.
---
No one wants to play with you lying dupers. Go sleep with Jussie. He will pretend to believe you.
---
The attention you ordered is out of stock
---
Yeah, that could be cool. I just hate how they are pushing it on people with this game. I like the separate server idea. 
---
Maybe but the outcome is still the same NO ACCESS. 
---
Can’t break what you can’t touch 
---
Hopefully there won’t be a big rush to patch that.
---
Personally I’d rather Bethesda spend the resources building new DLC then wasting time trying to manage dupers.
---
Jokes on you OP, none of my friends got FO76 in the first place and the friends I did make in game quit playing haha. Though to be fair I never really spoke much or got on mic when I said I was gonna. Or responded to messages. I got social anxieties
---
You have never played csgo, you either start cheating cos you are bad, or start cheating when you get 1.5k hours and find everyone cheats
---
"that results in item duplication." Might want to read the full sentence before saying it's vague.
---
Not playing anymore, but hey this is good to see.
---
💯 
---
What if I told you that people getting banned from video games have been falsely yet adamantly claiming their innocence in every available public forum since the internet was invented?
---
Ah, I'm glad those with the moral high ground are so less toxic than those filthy dupers. 
---
As if those are the only three crashes I've had. No, those are just 3/3 nuke launches made worthless by conveniently consistent crashes at various stages during and after the launch. 
---
I'm sure Bethesda appreciates your tireless defense of this crap heap, fanboy.
---
The more I hear/read about Bethesda's behavior regarding this game, the happier I am I skipped it completely.
---
I smell some serious bullshit here.
---
Thanks! :) 
---
BS, those who deserve to be called out will be called out.  This will serve as a lesson
---
I know, but my main knows way too many plans to start from scratch. I hate trying to xfer crap. 
---
I know about the list. I’m actually looking for an answer to what the best,all rounder. Opinions or facts. No specific build or okay style.
---
I bet those people that bought awards for him feeling salty as fuck after reading this.
---
TSE butthurt is more like a tickle these days
---
hahaha what a fucking tool...
---
Your absolutely right.  I started up RDR2 again... far better game in literally every way.
---
As a trekkie fan, this is incredible.  Live long and prosper 🖖
---
Well, I own enclave, BOS, marine, and Vault Suit.  And I consistently use the enclave underarmor. 
---
This. Lol. The irony makes me a bit salty (never duped but I feel like it's Bethesda's fault for allowing it in game in the first place) but it's also quite hilarious to see their hypocrisy in action. 
---
Me neither, really. I had, like, two people I'd play with regularly.
---
I just found it hilarious that a bunch of angry players quickly put away their pitchforks and posted their support because this woman happened to be attractive. 
---
He's one of the best streamers for Blizzard's online card game, Hearthstone. His twitch follower count is 1.2 mil, I'm assuming it used to be more when HS was fresh

---
This guy was cheating. This post is BS. You're falling for it all. It's a great game. Stop believing confirmation bias. 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who uses Rockstar Editor to get those *amazing* photos on console
---
You seemed to imply that building a home was in FO3 which it clearly wasn't. You had the Megaton home or Tenpenny suite(without mods). FO4 introduced the building aspect and it attracted a ton of casuals. FO76 kept this trend going in an online setting and building was never the primary focus in either game. Each new addition to the Fallout franchise is catering to the casual "fans" who spend more time complaining than enjoying the game. It's annoying.   
---
"I think Bethesda has missed a valuable lesson to all those young people who have not experienced their own physical home."   
---
Wtf does that even mean? It's Fallout not the Sims. 
---
I hope they bring it into RDR 2 
---
Dupers are not my friends. I'm glad they're gone.
---
I don't know whether OP is telling the truth or not, but "decision is final, and no appeals" sounds sketchy as fuck to me.  What, you know for a fact that it is literally impossible for any mistake to ever be made?  Come on.
---
But the crash diet was rewarded the first time my pc could fast travel in excavator power armour since starting to play the game.

If your CAMP cannot be placed, it will tell you when you first log into the server with a pop up box that must be confirmed.
---
If your camp is being destroyed by creatures or people, you may want to look at choosing a less traffic'd area.  Monsters will not spawn at your CAMP unless you or someone else walks into the area and causes a spawn to occur.  If you are there, you can easily pick them off.  If others are there though, they will likely just walk thru the area and leave the monsters to tear apart your shit.
---
The only other time I've had issues is when I built my camp at the very edge of the NW side of the map.  I think about 25% of the area was actually out of bounds.  Even though I did not build on the out of bound area, the next time I tried logging in my CAMP could not be placed.  And it refused to place again until I moved my CAMP so it was not overlapping out of bounds.
---
Looks like someone deleted their post lol. 
---
I don't post on reddit a lot. Do people not joke aroind and take everything serious?
---
Right? lol It doesn't bother me when I get downvoted though, it says more about the voter than the poster.
---
The graveyard should have a monument to "900 hour guy" that spawns a single round of ultracite ammo at the base of it.
---
Yeah, that’s totally possible, though they were all banned awhile back and even when they were around I didn’t really do the whole “I’m just transferring items for them” thing — I didn’t want to mess with it and end up banned.  I’ll admit as I did above that I sold some weapons... but I def never had anywhere near 100k of anything, not even total within a 30 day period.
---
Um... You know OPs post is BS right? Like 90% of the bad things you're hearing are all made up BS.... Don't get me wrong, the game has it's issues and Beth messed up hard on some PR this time around, but it's still a great game. 
---
Yeah, and combine that with the Assassin's 8% damage reduction from players effect. Not sure the math on those two stacking though.
---
The 900 hrs guy doesn't have a life
---
For anyone interested, the location is &gt;!Braxon's Quality Medical Supplies (located at the top right of the map.)!&lt;
---
And then there is a group that stays out of it and just plays for fun.
---
Scorchbeast bones have ultracite in them. I was throwing ultracite away when we was farming scorchbeast queen same for flux. I had like 20 of every flux and 400ultracite in one day.
---
Nope! None of the folks I play with cheat so no one I know has been banned.
---
Use 2 turrets at the most with the Home Defense perk card. Turrets are budget killers and too many will leave you with nothing of importance to defend rendering them meaningless. 
---
That would be hilarious lmao, I love this idea, tombstones with gamer tags on them and the more overt the crime (e.g posting on YouTube that your duping and giving instructions on how to cheat) the bigger the gravestone, tomb or even mausoleum. There’s always that area over the other side of the river west of the forest that looks like it has plenty of room lol. There would probably be the odd duper vigilante wrongly banned for temporarily accumulating excess stuff before jumping off a cliff with it depicted on a gravestone but you could always introduce an appeals process. I’m probably thinking about this too much lol.
---
While I agree with everyone that he's probably cheating, aren't you assuming that he got all the crafting materials in one month?
---
One of the best shows so far, I've really enjoyed the f76 fallout. It's a game that keeps on giving, thanks Bethesda. Definitely going to log in more frequently now.
---
Ya know there's something called the truth and you should tell it bud
---
It's not just this, other things have swayed me as well. Namely being that there are no human NPC's giving out missions, and the way pvp works.
---
Also the fiasco at the beginning with the bait n switch tactics regarding the expensive edition and people not getting what they paid for.
---
Besides, I'm still stuck on 4, I have many hundreds of hours left yet.
---
Why do you think this dudes cheating? Wouldn't he give himself something more worthwhile than tons of 5mm ammo? I don't understand why a person would risk being banned for ammo, doesn't make sense to me.
---
Yea which is kind of the point of my post.  If we are going to deal with waves of enemies we need to be able to defend our camps better. 
---
Lol “part of the problem” give me a break man... so you’re saying he crafted ammo in an online game? Sorry you’re traumatized about it guess I’ll switch to melee so you don’t get triggered again. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png](https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png)
---
Yes like if something very specific was needed for something else then have a window pop up asking if you really want (whatever it is) scrapped ..that could save a lot of accidental scrapping lol 
---
I have never in my 175 levels found even one round of ultracite ammo and the guy had over 300k of it between his accounts.
---
He didn't find it.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as6rlq/999999\_hours\_guy\_with\_50000000000\_ammo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as6rlq/999999_hours_guy_with_50000000000_ammo/)
---
My only response for all the people saying they did nothing to get banned and only getting called out: [https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png](https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png)
---
Neither is she. Just sayin.
---
You know OP is full of shit right? 
---
The real end game is to avoid getting banned knowing you duped items. Who needs survival mode when you got avoid deletion mode?!
---
No, because OP is full of shit 
---
How can you even post *400k* when the email showing *225k* is right on the post lol. You pretty much doubled it for hyperbole. 
---
I convert all my lead/gunpowder straight into ammo asap.  And have all the perks to reduce ammo weight that exist.
---
I'm nearly always needing 5.56 ammo and have thousands of spare shotgun shells.
---
My PSn name is tracyg1976 if anybody wants a few thousand shells lol.
---
Plenty of people...depends on whether the misery is deserved...
---
A lot of enemy encounters in this game could be more interesting simply by having more enemies. That's one of the reasons Whitespring runs are the most satisfying in the game. The mob quantity and density is something you can't find anywhere else, save for maybe West Tek and if you nuke Morgantown. 7 days to die (or whatever it was called) used to have wandering hordes of zombies... I'd think it was fuckin' cool if 40 ghouls showed up out of nowhere outside my base.
---
I did my vats sniper build per my norm I'm fo new Vegas and it was fun.  My second go through of the game did it melee. Highly disappointed, never again. 
---
Not everyone wants to minmax their balls off and be level 400
---
um... Ultracite Ammo is rare. Very hard to get a large quantitiy like that. Also, this guy was 99.99% involved in duping. OP is full of shit and everyone is believing him. 
---
I'm 161 and it's much more time consuming. I also really like something like "re-spec all points".
---
"now I'll ask you a bunch of questions that immediately reveal to you that I actually have zero ability to fix that for you, and you will need to escalate the issue to a manager who may know what the fuck they are talking about because I definitely do not." 
---
Lol funniest post I’ve seen in a while,  for real I know traders with that much ammo tho so I can get you on the low..
---
yeah except he likely (as in 99.99% likely) did cheat to get this stuff
---
You originally wrote
---
How about you give us a valid source?
---
This sub screams at people for reporting bugs and glitches to provide evidence.  Where is the evidence this is the 900 hour guys?
---
Your initial tone was of indignation and outrage
---
Catching your mistake and hoping no ones notices doesn’t make you less wrong. It just means you were faster.
---
My opinion stands
---
I'm just saying that too many turrets won't leave you enough budget to build a decent camp. This game makes you choose between a great camp, adequate defenses, or something in the middle. That choice is part of the survival aspect and ensures that everyone stops to think about what they want most from a camp. Increasing the budget or decreasing the turret budget size would mean that everyone can have an amazing camp and that would ruin the fun. It's all about choices. 
---
They usually sell for 250 caps.
---
The kind of person that wants to enjoy the game and have exploiters flushed out of the experience? I don't care that they're miserable, I care that they're actually being punished/having their accounts corrected.
---
I'm pumped... another 200 pounds is exactly what I've been needing. Have too many legendaries taking up stash space.
---
You realize that this isn't a competitive game, right? You're not better at Fallout 76 than anyone. I'm pretty sure I'm enjoying it more though.
---
It's a good idea, but not for saving weight.  Clothes all weigh 0.1 lbs unless they are underarmor.  Still it would be nice to not have to scroll so much to find things.
---
all the other email images I have seen don't specify anything specific.. just a generic 100k items.  
---
this one seems suspect to me
---
Lol.... what?
---
Yup, several perks now do nothing, namely cap collector and skeet shooter (my combat shotgun has 15 accuracy with or without it) unless I’m confused as to what it actualy does of course... which is probable...
---
You rock
---
This would explain how I got the collect 10,000 caps challenge when I only had 600 or so.
---
This weeks codes got leaked by people who broke into the "Dev Room". So the codes on NukaCrypt are up to date and do work. For Feb 18-24th. 
---
225k ultracite ammo... nevermind the quantity, the fact it doesn't say anything about the ammo type.. 45, 44, 308, etc.. that seems fishy.  and that no other email I have seen posted from anyone lists anything specific, so why does this one?
---
Well that's pretty obvious, the notes required a double check as it's not *that* farfetched.
---
Unless there are other effects on them you would also like 
---
Bethesda keeps going this route and I'll need to pick the game up again.
---
I dont believe a single one of these "I'm innocent" posts.
---
For me melee is not only unfunny, it's also illogical - doing more damage with single swing of the walking stick or rolling pin than with high-tech weapons is just bad game development...
---
that sounds like a bug. 
---
Please take my upvote
---
Having extra perk serves the same purpose.  I have a concentrated fire 3 for daytime and a concentrated fire 1 for night time when I need to equip night eyes (2 perk card).
---
What would be better would be to redo the interface and treat all cards as singles and then give us saved slots to save different configurations of cards.
---
You’ve made the same post 4 times , judging by the fact you’ve deleted 2 of them already I’d say you know your argument is flawed and that this time maybe you should delete this post and not post it again , thanks x.
---
yes, yes indeed. so why not all under armor?
---
until Dupageddon is done, just hold you caps for now
---
What are you talking about? 140K on his main and 225k on his mule. Do the math please
---
A true raider stop people from raiding?
---
Must have missed that charter meeting 
---
Thanks for brightening my day and upvoting.
---
I hope because of you that clown will always look over his shoulder and wonder where the next bullet will come from.
---
How do i even find loot?
---
No. Good luck with that.
---
This is a temporary thing. Bans come in waves. People should absolutely call them out. Don't give them an echo chamber they can garner unopposed sympathy in. They will leave when they either realize the ban is permanent or get unbanned when their relevant items are removed. Or they will just leave when they get bored, which seems really likely for someone that needed to exploit/dupe a relatively simple game in the first place.
---
The bans aren't permanent because they realize people who didn't dupe items themselves would get hit with it. Whether a duper traded with them, they found a bag full of duped items, or they were one of the people out hunting dupers and trashing their duped junk, they'd get picked up on this ban despite not duping anything themselves. 
---
It also serves as a warning to actual dupers. They get a temporary suspension for this first offence, and once the known methods are fixed they'll get a permanent one if they use an unknown duping method in the future.
---
What are you referring to, can you clarify rather than just coming back to your old post to thumb your nose at people?
---
You're correct and I misread it. I will accept my down vote(s) lol. 
---
Man this game just keeps getting worse. 
---
I used to love Fallout. But after this release and the horrendous game that was Fallout 4, I can’t promise I’ll buy another Bethesda Fallout game. 
---
Hopefully this guy gets unbanned. 900 hours in a game he likes only to be punished for liking it. 
---
but... they let the peoples keep the duped gear and now start banning peoples becuase amo??? when the servers r real wastelands already??? idiots...
---
Or a third option, though unlikely, the mail could be fake, hear me out ... He wrote a book lol (and kudos to him for it I wouldn't have) and then posts a mail, similar to his helpful post. Now this mail doesn't look like any of the other mails and even states the reason he was banned! While EVERYONE else got a generic 100k rare item within 30 days speil... Hmm ok possible, but why just him why not everyone? This would imply a specific intention by a person other than a bot spewing a generic legal document and not a detailed one anyone with a modicum of intelligence can accurately fabricate a plausible scenario. The opinion is yours to formulate.
---
TLDR: it might be fake it might not you decide.
---
That’s not all I’ve found some say that they don’t dupe , which they haven’t , but also state they’ve never come into contact with duped items, however in their post history they’ve stated how they steal duper’s items in containers. 
---
I think I'll take that advice. Thank you
---
Wait is it a flaming chainsaw or a flamer with a chainsaw bayonet
---
You can think things in this game have been done or handled poorly while also thinking cheaters are habitually and well-known to be full of shit. The two things aren't mutually exclusive. I've been watching banhammer outcries for almost two decades now. Banned cheaters all sound the same.
---
Mine is usually turn game on, realize there is still no new content, see none of my friends log on any more, turn off and go play something else.
---
I have a routine for my current pc at the moment.  Visit Camden park to do the dailies, walk up to Charleston and server hopping a bit to see if I can bump into Grahm or the vendor bot, walk up to Sutton and sell excess bulked stuff then fast travel to whitesprings train station, wander through the first part of the mine behind it then sell up and fast travel back home.
---
And that is Jade's life right now lol
---
There are enough people who didn't dupe items themselves that got hit with the ban to warrant making it only a temporary ban. People who picked up duped items should have known better, but I'm fine with them getting this as a warning. People who were duper hunting and destroying stacks of duped junk have been hit with this ban too.
---
Yeah I followed the PA helmet bug and know its legit, and it is a sound point you make that it could be your loadout or some unusual perk or a solitary item in your inventory, but you would know if that is so by having a second toon in a different playstyle/loadout. And for sure its bad code form Bethesda, I dont disagree, I just want to acknowledge that it isnt the kind of thing that gets fixed and you framed the post as How long Does It Take
---
I love Beth but they've been the buggiest studio since Morrowind, sad that they havent nurtured some corporate culture to rectify. Have an upvote
---
Yeah and that's why bans like this are hardly ever lifted because the devs doesn't know if it was really a false positive from the anti-cheat and the user is telling the truth or if it was a legit cheater who is trying to get rid of his ban.
---
It wouldn't matter if it were a single player game but it isn't, it's a multiplayer game.
---
There's a metaphor about Wal-mart in here somwhere
---
I borrowed my brothers copy of this to see if I it had improved, haven't played since the beta, cancelled my preorder then and there, installed the game and got the error, turns out I'm banned too lol. Ah well, I don't care enough about this game to care much, I just found it hilarious. 
---
Honestly this doesn't seem that undoable in one month at all, as someone who farms SBQ and trades a lot and has at least done that amount of normal ammo (Probably even more in fact). 
---
Why would your ammo crafter pay for ammo non-stop?
---
Even though the higher level turrets only do so much 
---
lol Wrekt.
---
By leveling up. When you level there are 2 things you need to do, put one point into your SPECIAL stats and choose a perk card. Whatever stat you choose will allow you to get a perk card for that area (ie you put 1 point into strength, the choose a perk card for the strength category).
---
30k bobbleheads for your “collection” 
---
i like to dump stuff in the cash registers at Railroad vendors. Feels like im rewarding someone for really looking about the place. Like how all the old RPGs would hide the best chests just behind a background element. Just hiding in plain sight.
---
There are NPC's in the game, just not human... If you had played the damn game you would know they're not necessary to the game being "good" I mentioned that they had bad PR with this game. I was referring to the "canvas bag" scenario there. He had hundreds of thousands of ultracite ammo. You can not get that much ultracite without duping it. Also, probably duped ammo for the same reason you don't suspect him. He probably thought others wouldn't suspect him either. If he's actually playing, ammo is one of the few things you always need. There's no need to have multiples of the same weapon unless you're reselling for real world currency. If you're actually playing the game ammo is absolutely worth duping.
---
It sounds like your C.A.M.P. either couldn't be placed/loaded when you logged in (in which case you should log out and back in) or you moved it and the camp items are currently in your "stored" tab.
---
When i worked CS If you submit a duplicate ticket, one of the duplicates gets closed with the resolution of "ticket is duplicate of ticket number 1234".. usually on ticket number 1000.
---
My friends are long gone, no ban necessary. 
---
I've done both duping (I'm sure some here are aware of that) and dupe-hunting successfully.
---
Still going strong over here.
---
We need those Explosive turrets you see in Harpers Ferry. Those things scare me even in full Sentinal.  Especially when you see them sideways in clusters of 3-4 for some odd reason. 
---
I found over 120 Bobby Pins in that one safe in Morgantown Airport, still find 50 in it to this day. Biggest jackpot was the safe near the APC (Also at Morgantown Airport) with 80 Stimpaks! Still find 30/40 of them in the safe rarely.
---
All 100% legit. I now always carry 150 Stomped on me since I'm a Field Medic for a Brotherhood of Steel group I'm in. Although I usually make my own Stimpaks when possible.
---
I knew people who duped and knowingly accepted it, was only junk items: 20 bulk each which goes by super fast. That was over 2 months ago (Gotta be honest) There was 1 duper I knew got ermenitly banned from ever playing Fallout 4/76 due to having hundreds of thousands junk and hundreds of duped weapons all on alt characters. I found that to be true justice. That was 2 months ago.
---
I kind of had a feeling that the system is tracking the items themselves, so even if you weren't a duper, that if you had any interaction with a duper whether killing them and touching their stuff, taking caps, trading, etc that the system would identify you as being a part of that cheating.
---
I only come to this conclusion due to your history search, no shame, that it seems a lot of it is just from interactions with the cheaters themselves. I've only mingled with players early after the games launch, but after awhile started minding my own business (when duping was starting to become a thing).
---
We have yet to see though and I'm curious what the company will describe to us as their anti-cheat system.
---
There's usually one in the river just south of the Charleston train station.  Head south on the train tracks and  stop on the 2nd red train bridge.  He should be right under you.
---
Lucky! Hope you found a lot of awesome stuff. I don't know how long I would've tried to farm 😂 Definitely wishing for the option to select "friends only" or at the very least "zero PVP" electives not just what is in game now. Having to deal with the self appointed dupe police and others who enter into nukes and make them chaotic isn't my thing. When I have found a server with great players rolling through queens and organized nukes they're stay and play moments. 
---
I'm sorta scared this will happen to me over this weekend I grinded whitwsprings from level 18 to 51 with a team and we passed around items alot. Since I had speed demon since level 30 I was sorta the pack mule with excavator gear at level 45 I could hold a ton and still run at a reasonable speed so I would sell at dealers let them fast travel and split up we made each a good 4000 caps. The carry weight was maxed out on me twice so I hope nothing happens.
---
I’m with you man, make guns good again.
---
I'm still enjoying the game. Every time people get banned I actually enjoy it a little more!
---
With a high powered rifle.
---
This sub-reddit is not the core fanbase of the game... most people don't use the sub-reddit or even care about it.
---
This makes me want to go bounty hunting with my 3* rapid instigating gausse rifle
---
Nah, I tried a bunch of new combinations of things and can't select it. But thank you very much for the suggestions.
---
Yes, I’m a fanboy that should be burned at the stake 
---
Not for “defending Bethesda for their poor performance” but for acknowledging that progress is being made 
---
Good good 
---
I think you're neglecting the other 300,000 ammo he had... 600,000 total ammo.... In 30 days... You really gonna tell me that's possible without duping? By your own admission you could only craft over 100k 50 Cal in a month. How about 600k? Yeah, nah.
---
"I'm right and if people don't agree with me they must be in denial"  
---
Was that intentionally ironic?
---
I take my extra known plans and find someone to give them to, then I look around the map for locations I haven’t found yet. I found a church that sunk into the Mire, at the bottom was more weird cult-stuff probably related to the Lucky Hole mine. After that I do events, and occasionally I drop into some of my fav spots to go legendary monster hunting. I try not to play longer than an hour.
---
If you want to be paranoid wouldn't a better question be why the guy is posting an email that incriminates himself? 
---
That email is the strongest argument people have to call shenanigans on his claim to be innocent.
---
It is fully possible, A LOT of people on my list ended up going to duping when they found it as an option.  Several are fairly active in reddit, and I stopped playing with them because of the duping/ cheating. 
---
Here is your pat on the back I guess. *Pats gently*  
---
Just try not to be to upset when / if it catches up with you.  Just because you robbed a bank and didn't get caught doesn't mean you're innocent.
---
Perhaps you did it in a way that didn't trigger their algorithms...for now.
---
900 hours? Bro truly they did you a favor, walk outside download tinder and get some pussy for once in your pathetic life 
---
Until the end of the week when you stuff another 200lbs of trash in it
---
Can you hate anymore damn.
---
The only hard part of that quest is getting the Wendigo to put on the clown suit.  He doesn't like to do it.
---
I doubt the games are serial numbered they wouldn't know you used your brothers game. Unless you used a PC version with an activation key? Otherwise I don't think they have that ability.
---
Until Mexico took Zihuatanejo down for maintenance and removed all the duped money except for a dollar. 
---
This sub represents less than 5% of  the player base. Get your head out of the clouds. Half the people here are saying "I don't even play this game but..." It is absolutely possible every poster here claiming a flase posotive is possibly lieing. 
---
Legitimate? hardly.  There is no way you can farm/make that much ammo in 30 days with just a single type of ammo!
---
Lets not even consider the ultracite ammo.
---
Like a guy did the math in the other post, you would need to play 12 hours a day, every day, for the full 30 days.  
---
Assuming you have job and dont eat or sleep.    Or you just sleep and have no job.
---
Assuming resources respawned fast enough for you to mine them every hour...
---
I think I remember a screen shot of 133k ammo in just one category, but you had over 650k in total in 1 month.  (Including over 100k ultracite).
---
So to get to 133k ammo in 30 days, at 12 hours a day, that means 369.44 bullets per hour.
---
I don't even think you can get that much steel and lead because they cannot spawn that quickly or others mine them too.
---
Plus the amount of acid and gunpowder to gain.
---
Your character would be doing nothing but farming mats for the bullets every single day for entire month.
---
Also yo had +300k more ammo beyond that?!  So.. thats now at 369.44 X 3 = 1108.33 ammo crafted per hour (given 12 hour days).  
---
Hell I got trouble crafting 1000 ammo while mining the best spot for steel/lead.  You server hop all the time to get them I assume?
---
You were flagged because you had over 100k ultracite ammo.  (in addition to your other ammo).  No.  No freaken way.
---
But I’m not.
---
The folks who picked up duped items didn’t work for it, so there’s no sense of accomplishment especially when they grief and trash peoples camps.
---
They can all get banned for being culpable.
---
Most of these bans seem to have been issued in the last few days so if you can still log in now you might be o.k, I’ve seen screenshots of emails here on reddit showing ammo quantity as an issue but they had big impossible numbers of ultracite ammo in addition to regular ballistic ammo, they had over 100k of .50 but it might have been the ultracite ammo that flagged them and the large number of .50 might have been coincidental, who knows
---
Probably lol
---
I've built camps all over the wasteland and I've never seen that happen. Premade objects absolutely do not affect your camp budget.
---
I can't remember the last time I was this hard due to a banwave.
---
The guy just randomly opened a trading window with me. I thought “weird, but this game is a giant grind so i’ll take some free caps, whatever.”
---
Like, item duping is bad when it’s used for PVP trolling etc. But getting some random free caps from a random player while i’m trying to buy plans in a broken economy where vendors have a punishingly low level of caps and don’t actually keep the caps you give them? Yeah, to me that is not an issue. 
---
Great!
---
Just buy them from the Enclave, a bit more expensive but they are always available.
---
I'm on xbox, I just think Bethesda is banning people on their server at random. 
---
They're just copying Bethesda.
---
I get that shit all the time in GTA Online. Apparently when a level 100 slaps around a level 5 player it is OK. But when my level 300+ self rolls up in my fully upgraded Kanjali tank and starts to slap around the same level 100 who was targeting the level 5 I'm a mean griefer. 
---
I found a loot bag with a lot of bulk junk. I didnt think much of it other than i, "wow, i can repair all my weapons, armor, camp, etc." Now im banned because i picked up a dupers loot bag. I don't think i violated any ToS by doing that, but if im wrong, by all means.
---
Upvoting because I was unsure of the rollout date!
---
Excited to get another 200lbs of stupid stuff to haul around lolz
---
Warframe is basically a bunch of monkey ninjas bouncing off of the walls rocket league style, and while you are looking at the neat base you're exploring (or trying to figure out how to get to point B) they're all waiting at the exit and getting annoyed at you for being slow.
---
Looked neat, but the farming mechanic ruins it.
---
Personally I've sunk a boatload of hours into Minecraft and still enjoy it.  I think it may be past it's golden era (there were some fantastic modpacks for earlier versions), but it's still quite good and the community is welcoming.
---
Oh, so cute. But don't worry about me, friend. I know how to handle these things.
---
Hey, come visit at Grafton some time, okay? 
---
A little confused here. In a another post you commented that you had both duped and hunted down dupers. You seemed like you were quite happy for getting away with it unscathed . . . so far. Now you're saying that "kid's can't understand that actions carry consequences," yet you're gleeful that you received none and laughing at others who did. Seems fair? 
---
Oh really? You're 51? Because your [poist history](https://www.reddit.com/user/McSaltMaker?sort=top) says different. 
---
I smell a loooot of bullshit here. 
---
It’s good for nuked flora too as well as all food and drink 👍
---
Yeah, I don't know what people are talking about here. I don't play much, maybe an hour or two a night if that. And I hardly do nuke zones....maybe only a dozen of them. 
---
I still have nearly 40 hardened mass on me and about 20 of each stable flux. Only thing that stopped me from more is the stupid stash limit. With any desire, a mule could have easily solved that issue, but the hassle required to trade between was not worth it. 
---
The thing with hardened mass and those other materials....they aren't instanced. They are generated per mob per server. And, most people don't even bother looting non legendary mobs. I could just run over to a whitespring nuke near the end and harvest hundreds of the stuff from all of the meat piles lying around. No need to shoot a single bullet.
---
A single stable flux yields 2x the normal bullet output for Ultracite for the same materials. It's actually cheaper to just craft ultracite ammo in terms of time/materials if you have the flux. 
---
I built a platform outside of my base and put one of every instrument on it! Now I just need some friends
---
Even if all you're duping is Comrad Chubs teddy bears, you need to be banned. **PERIOD.**
---
That being said, as someone who actually shoots 45 ammo through a lever gun, I craft and shoot 300 rounds a day.
---
I have 2-300 hours play time in, so let's call that 9000 rounds in 30 days. 
---
He *might* have legitimately picked up the 5mm and 5.56 ammo, with the pathing rounds he claims to make.
---
If I tripled that play time and crafting, that would only be 27,000 rounds. this guy has 150,000.
---
The kicker is, he's a shotgun build.
---
The question is not why would someone dupe ammo, but why **did** they?
---
Gotta call this ban deserved.
---
You didn't get banned for mule accounts, you got banned for cheating. Anyone who says they got banned for moving on mules is a 
---
l i a r
---
The truth is out there.
---
Is there proof that this email is directed at the guy with 900 hours? I just see an email detailing what someone has been banned for but it doesn't contain user names or any proof of who it belongs too. 
---
225,000 ultracite ammo is something you just came across between your two accounts? 🤔
---
Ever talked to a 2 year old who did something wrong? They use the same logic of deny everything even when caught with the crayons in their hand and the wall colored on. 
---
Or maybe OP is lying.
---
My friend got one to drop during the SBQ, while I got a hunter’s walking cane... I feel your pain 
---
Upvoting because It’s called integrity. You got it now pass it on.
---
Taking the easy cheating duping way is always faster but not necessarily moral ethical or legal.
---
Know that you won’t have to worry about getting banned or look over your shoulder.
---
Well, i got the picture from his OWN post before it got deleted by the moderators.
---
Weird, he said on the internet that he wasn't a cheater, but it turns out he is?
---
If you are using two accounts it's not very legtitimate
---
Just send them this: [https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png](https://i.imgur.com/jqfE4IV.png)
---
It's thanks to nice people like this who leave two dozen half full fusion cores in a bin so I can kick the ass out of my freshly made excavator armour.
---
I fall into category 4. I even posted about it way before they started banning people for duplicating. I never used an exploit or duplicated anything, i just picked up a bag filled to the brim with junk items and thought it was a blessing from Bethesda, now im banned and can't even talk to Bethesda. 
---
I had to look that up. Never heard of it before, lol.
---
Now i get it tho.
---
How does someone else having something impact your enjoyment of searching for it?
---
Sure, that’s a possibility. But as someone who has sent out wrong reports before due to botched queries, I know that is also possible. 
---
Ahh, there are so many posts a d comments around this that's it's hard to track and keep on top of. It's like a shitfest. Thanks for the info.
---
They arent npcs, they have no character
---
Great. Haven't found explainations in links above
---
WTH? What kind of dark magic is this? I can barley get a square house together, this is insane haha! 😯😁
---
Did you ever use the endless warfare mod in fo4? The menu was pretty confusing, but youd basically configure spawns for enemies (which ones, how many). It was pretty crazy, had like liberty primes, sentry bots, assaultrons, deathclaws and yao guais all constantly spawning in the vicinity fighting each other, then me.
---
That would definitely make it more interesting, it would be fun until Im in the middle of something else and dont want to fuck with them (kind of like SBs behaviour all the time)
---
Just play another game man! So many good games. Better than a game that's doomed from the beginning...
---
Agreed!
---
I looked at 5-6 of them and post histories littered with selling TSE, Serums, ect.
---
Or large chunks of time where no posts were made, but outside that chunk?  Several per day.
---
Ha! I like that.
---
I've spent 7 to 8 hours on average a day on a game before like for the span of 3 to 4 months. Life gets busy, I work nights sims normally would be my main thing to do when the hotline or shelter was full of sleeping people. You can have a life and still play an average of 5 to 7 hours worth of gaming. Honestly this is why I always turn on play TV and record everything I do. That way I have evidence. 
---
“The login error”? If you mean the error 4:8:2000 that’s been the error folks have been getting when they’ve been temp banned for having more than 100k items accumulated over 30 day’s, seems the email comes a few days after the ban. There’s been a big banning wave so I suspect they are inundated with support tickets relating to login.
---
I often drop ammo/items i don't use or need, either at a station or in de white springs resort. 
---
Cool
---
"Decision is final"...unless it gets really popular and we need to watch our already shitty PR
---
How do you think he knew the ban wave was coming?
---
Upvoting your post but curious why you’re sorry?
---
I can dream lol 
---
There are several factors at play.
---
The sources for this currency are diminishing over time. Alot of those rewards are linked to the world or the character itself and can only be redeemed once. Players report, that their currency gains through gaming drastically reduce later on. In that sense a common marketing scheme is at play, being generous in the beginning and let the rewards dry up over time.
---
Furthermore a lot of currency rewards are not obtained by common gameplay naturally. The conditions to be met sometimes are very specific - like having to group up, being at a specific place and wearing a specific attire for example. This is not inclusive gameplay and outright annoying for many players. The main problem is, that it is not solely in your own hands to fulfill such conditions. Maybe nobody wants to group up with you, you might not have access to the location and not possess the required attire. On top of that many players have no interest in the picture feature or playing fashion model. Other videogames figured this issue out ages ago. For example card games do not require wins anymore in order to reward players. They get rewarded for participation - for simply playing the game, no matter the outcome. FO76 has nothing of it. They currency reward system is restrictive and exclusive.
---
Last but not least players have to be able to make reasonable sense between an asked price and the quality of a product. If they perceive a product as underwhelming, then their tolerance towards reasonable cashshop pricing goes down. The hate for the game and its pricing are not seperate issues. You cannot look at one of it without considering the ilnfluence of the other.
---
And there are games out there, for which people happily spend tons of money, cause those are made of quality (PoE for example).
---
In conclusion the pricing from Bethesda and the way the currency reward system is implemented into the game is simply insulting towards the consumer.
---
It also sucks when you know they can't solve your issue and won't pass it on. Wasting my time. 
---
Damn. Bethesda just keeps this shit show going
---
funny way to spell *day*, up there.
---
You knew going into the game that it wasn’t gonna be like any other fallout game. You knew it was going to be an mmo. Just because it wasn’t fallout 5 everyone is shitting their pants and whining. It’s not a bad fallout game it’s just a different one.
---
Seems i was wrong. He made the post after he got banned.He used his guide to provide proof for his high amount of ammo. His high upvotes made Bethesda give him the reason for why he was banned , this - [https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz)
---
all this salt lmfao just play the damn game
---
Lurking through a post history to find duped trades definitely disproves any claims of being innocently banned.  It's slightly greasy but so is lying about being banned for nothing.  It's just that some people have taken it too far and posted about a users recreational activities and life problems.  That's not cool at all.
---
The game already has a track record of game breaking bugs.  Bethesda have even messed up on a deployment.  They have little credibility left to assure their ban script works as intended.  Being on the back foot of course people will see these posts and think, maybe Bethesda has messed up again?  
---
Yet without any proof a lot of people took a side.  Whether right or wrong a lot of users gave instant judgement.  Turns out like you say, a lot have traded duped items willingly and are by no means innocent.  The top post was removed then reinstated.  Then further evidence shows there was foul play in ammo creation.  The writing on the wall is definitely pointed to dupers/traders trying to discredit the ban system to cause more drama.
---
Just one bit of proof of a mistaken ban would be another major blow for Bethesda.  That has not been proved yet and Bethesda seem to have the tools to show exactly in which items they were flagged for.  So instead of fighting and bickering, maybe everyone should work together in the [megathread](https://redd.it/as7w92) to solve these claims....without name calling or witch hunting.  A simple reply like 'your post xxxxx shows you were selling known duped items' will soon dispel any claims.  A final note is that some people are being banned for picking up stuff that has clearly been duped but thought it was ok to take anyways.
---
Early spring cleaning
---
What's the point of exploring if the first chest you come across is loaded with plans and recipes? A couple stimpacks a couple purified water and a few .38 ammo is all I ever leave in an overseer's chest. I don't pick up plans unless I need them. Leave them for the next guy to find them. Let someone else play the game.
---
hey! how the hell were they supposed to know that their alternate accounts were selling them duped items for free!?!?!?!?! 
---
I'm looking forward to having space for a few sets of armour, anti-mutant, anti-robot, etc. Be nice to be able to specialise for different situations.
---
At this point I'm just in it for the schadenfreude. The never ending cavalcade of gaffes has been really good for my self esteem.
---
Yep, need a shared stash box really
---
Maybe I expect too much, but if the developer of the game doesn't want you to have over 100k rounds of ammo, why can just not set that amount as the limit.  Or actually tell people, or just delete the amounts over 100k via a script.  I haven't seen other games ban players for picking up items in the wild or buying from a trader system that they implemented.
---
Well now that more stuff has come out he pretty much was legit banned. from what has come out. From the amount of stuff, it showed on his two accounts that got posted which he had 333.071 ultracite ammo that he supposedly gathered and crafted to the rest of the ammo on his accounts that he crafted and stuff all in just 1 month which the total for all was 645.645k in total ammo. Also, it came out he was actually banned before the ban wave that just happened for duped stuff and tried to play it off as if it just happened. Also, but not 100% sure he people said he admitted to duping in a thread he deleted as well but I have no idea if that is true or not. It just doses not add up that he was mistakenly banned. 
---
Yep I’m sure you believe every company commits resources bodies time and skillsets, to fail 
---
I dump excess recipes and plans and sometimes legendary weapons and armor that I don't want or are too low level. Usually in the cash registers next to vendors or any container near a station.
---
how are they getting "countless" nukes without duped nuke cards? lol dig that pit 
---
Oh, because I know they carry consequences. If you are stupid enough to let them get to you.
---
Absolutely 👍
---
Imo they cheated and are lying. 
---
It's a mod for the Chainsaw which adds energy damage. Its exact name is 'Chainsaw Flamer' I believe. I see how one could get confused.
---
It's the best BR I've played, just tryna save you guys from this shit
---
100K ? He has aprox.650.000 on two accounts.A lot of that being ultracite ammo that doesn't drop. 
---
Wouldnt it be nice if the time was localised and I didn't have to run off to Google to find out what EST was in real money.
---
"I never had more than 36,000 ammo, I don't understand"
---
You had over 360,000 of RARE ammo, and hundreds of thousands of other types over two accounts.
---
"But I never owned more than 100,000! People just report because I'm high level!"
---
No one reported you lol you got detected for cheating by the algorithm they used for this ban wave. Eat the ban and come back if you like the game, or good riddance if being held accountable turns you off to it. Honestly, the entitlement of some people lol
---
Fallout 4 wasn't even a bad game. People are jaded from NV, its definitely a disappointment but its not the shit show 76 is. 
---
What's new?  Read the paper much?  This mechanic has existed pretty much since civilization, and I don't mean Sid Meijers.
---
Same man, after farming nuked Whitesprings for the who the hell knows many times the best thing I got was a two shot cryolator 2 stars. Never got a 3 star legit, mostly 1 star wood  / leather pieces and chameleon stuff. 
---
I'd say it's bots. That '900 hour' guy has 10K upvotes within 18 hours only 10% of those votes are real. How are people believing him when there's clear evidence against him?🤔 900 hours is 6 months, so in actuality he kept his console on every single day without rest, or he's a legit no-lifer. I only have 100 (Maybe 150?) hours of gametime on Fa76 I'm only level 120. I don't care about leveling; I care about Role-playing with like minded people and helping friends. That's how Fallout 76 was supposed to be. Not about duper apologists complaining relentlessly over getting rightfully banned.
---
I found one of those stashes once. A real pleasant surprise. Grabbed some ammo I needed and dropped some ammo I didn't.
---
Plenty of legit players have a lot of things that I don't but they either worked for it or were lucky, so someone having something doesn't impact my enjoyment of searching for it. We're all searching on the same playing field. Joe Hax having 100 thousand copies of something is destabilizing the servers, the economy and bringing an inordinate advantage to every pvp encounter. It devalues any legitimate effort people put into the game. That's like saying why would you be mad that someone uses an aimbot and a wallhack in CS, just because they have access to something that you do not.
---
The more I see posts on /r/all the better I feel about but buying it lol
---
No, they fail and then remove resources.
---
Did a little research and apparently they both reduce cost even more at level 3, by a lot.
---
So stupid. I just googled MMO and got a different definition. One without the specification of thousands of players per server. This is absolutely an MMO regardless of what bethesda wants to brand it as. You are seriously so stupid for arguing with me about such a nebulous definition.
---
Got it. 
---
As long as you can get away with it, anything goes. You do you . . . while you still can.
---
Nah, that one is cumulative
---
But that is dumb, bash me all you want, but about a month ago i found a loot bag that was filled to the brim with junk items and thought it was a blessing from Bethesda, I repaired all my weapons, armor and camp. Even went around offering to repair other people's stuff. Now im banned. I never once duplicated or exploited anything, but now i'm banned. 
---
If this game was really important to your livelihood then why take the risk of being banned?
---
I’m just saying if this game meant a lot your actions seem reckless and foolish.
---
You do other risky things like skydive or walk against the crosswalk?
---
Lolz it’s today 9amEST
---
Dang! Thanks, would you say it’s worth it? I’ve got an 8 hour drive to get there from home, but I’m used to driving. 
---
Do me next! Do me next!
---
LOL.  Awesome!
---
Look at all the "I'm banned and innocent" crap!
---
The best way to fight this fight is to ignore this topic totally. 
---
Fallout 4 was a good game, just not a good Fallout game. 
---
Fallout 4 is definitely nowhere near the shitshow that is Fallout 76
---
How long does it take them to reply? My character got switched with someone else's. I sent a support ticket in about 1 month ago and still no word
---
How does it contradict it? I don't understand 
---
Honestly dont give a shit
---
I'm a 100% Power armor player, so I haven't had to look for ballistic fiber, how much do you need/go through a week? I'm genuinely curious. I see people complain about it all the time, and I often use it to sweeten the deal when trading with friends, since I've got around 300 or so, and find usually 10 - 30 on a good junk run. 
---
Again, asshole, read my other comments. If you read my other comments, you would see that I **know that** and I **fucking love this game**!
---
feed them to death like "sloth" in the movie seven
---
Does she play FO4? With mods like Sim Settlement or Horizon, she should have a blast in settlements.
---
Wow. Fallout 76 is such a shitshow they ban the only people still playing it.
---
Most people know why they got banned. They only showed this guy because he threw a hissy fit on social media that was bad for the company's reputation. And the idiot actually shared the proof, as if people would believe him after showing his "legitimate" half a million crafted ammo
---
Nope, the game has run so smooth since the ban wave.
---
Cause if it was a bayonet for the flamer, it would be like playing GoW
---
(Not the person you replied to, but I also didn't buy it)
---
For me, I just see stuff on /r/all. Normally I don't waste my time on drama, or "bad" products and stuff I generally don't care about. But while I've always enjoyed Bethesda games I thought they were vehemently overrated. So I kind of enjoy the clusterfuck that this game has been.
---
Ultimately, I hope it pushes them too make better single player games in the future.
---
Ah, fuck me good question - it's over by the civil war re-enactment fort!
---
As long as you have pacifist mode on, you're fine. 
---
Nope you wouldn't hurt them.
---
Skeet shooter reduces spread of shotgun bullets and it is far from useless. 
---
Makes sense to me honestly. Wasnt try to spread misinformation. Though me one buddy swears by it only builds by lakes. Drives me nuts his current camp drops me in the lake when ever I fast travel to it.
---
It automatically sets you into a team with whoever else is in the objective so either way you can't damage them 
---
You said that in a similar post so I'm gonna rightfully assume your a bot or just some seriously edgy no-lifer.
---
Feel better now?
---
Your bio is ethical hacker... Those two things rarely go together... Account is not even 2 months old. I know why the post is recieving downvotes now. I'm not digging through anyones history. All I did was notice the same name and imgur link in two seperate posts I saw. 
---
its worse what they are doing.  "Duper Hunting?"   No, they are getting others to do the dirty work, then steal all the items from those people.  Scumbags still.
---
as in, not counted. or at least not specified.
---
And, you are assuming they are the only one dropping the nukes.
---
That being said, a month ago there was usually a nuke dropped on 1/3rd of the servers I connected to, either when i logged in or within 10 minutes or so.
---
1 third on average was at fissure prime, 2 thirds were at whitesprings.
---
Do that ever single day since launch of the game, and you'd still be \~3000 flux short.
---
I keep seeing people talk about how easy this would be, but I don't think you are grasping the sheer number this guy produced. I doubt that even if you use your method with 100% efficiency you could probably just get to the level of ultracite ammo that this guy made. But he also had 300,000 OTHER ammo types that he claims to have "crafted"
---
How can you even move with that much ammo? Even with Bandolier rank 2 to reduce ammo weight by 90% 1000 ammo of 5.56, shotgun shells and 308 equals to 1. That means you carry about 40+30+12=82Lbs of ammo, Still have to carry weapons, armor, meds, food, and junk too.
---
lol, okay, duper. You should have played legitimately then. 
---
Yeah I wasn't a fan of going through post histories. There were so many I didn't do nuffin rants the only way to get any info was to go through post history. Most of these posters did nothing to hide thier previous post which disprove them. Even given that info I didn't name anyone and kept it polite. It's not my place shame them when they're already suspended. 
---
Untill Beth releases how they determined bans/suspensions all anyone has to go on is the word of people who were banned. They have every reason to lie and make Beth look bad. Hopefully we get some clarity on these bans and Beth can save themselves some undue bad publicity. Well undue on this instance....
---
bro, you sound like jussie smollet 
---
you're overlooking a few factors.
---
each batch requires one violet flux. to make one stable flux you need 10 raw flux of the same variation, and one each of high radiation fluids, glowing mass, and hardened mass. yes, these are able to be farmed from nuke zones, but it takes a lot of time for small results, further complicating the equation.
---
you also are underestimating his numbers, which were a grand total of roughly 366k for ultracite ammo alone, requiring over 5,000 ultracite scrap and over 5000 violet flux.
---
on top of that, the video you cited is to farm ultracite *ore,* when you need the actual ultracite to craft. it takes 5 ore to craft one piece of ultracite. at 85 ore/hour, that is actually 300 hours just to gather the ultracite alone.
---
on top of that, the other ingredients factor in to this as well. steel and gunpowder may be easy to come by for the layman, this guy had a grand total of 651,654 rounds (also, these are just the totals mentioned in the email), *at least* more than half of which is self-crafted rare ammo. it takes 12 steel per batch of ultracite 5.56. for the ultracite ammo alone, that's at least 60k in steel, 25k in gunpowder, and 40k lead. if he did in fact farm ore for the ultracite, it takes 5 acid on top of the 5 ore to make 1 ultracite. that's 25k acid.
---
that said, does he not use ammo? are we to believe this is all that was ever crafted? if he doesn't use it, why is he spending so much time crafting it? if he's selling it, that means there was likely more.
---
i don't think it is *impossible* for him to have done this in 900 hours, but it would be quite the feat, with maybe half of his total game time just going to craft the ammo mentioned in the e-mail alone.
---
the more you break down the facts, the less likely it is that this guy is 100% clean.
---
What I don't understand is why anyone needs even 5K of anything, nevermind 100K.  
---
(Be it components, food items, weapons, ammo, clothing/armour etc)  
---
Currently, lvl 92 and keeping my eyes on the goal of reaching 100, after that, well, we shall see.  
---
I rarely trade with others, sell only to vendors and feel rich if I have over 1K caps.
---
Your missing some things, it isn't the amount they are currently carrying, it's the amount that passed through their hands.  I do think this is very flawed and absolutely could false flag some innocents.  100k ammo could absolutely be used up by a very active player in 30 days.  On the other side even if the banned could login to show their inventory, it would be very easy to pass some stuff off and scream I'm innocent.  While I'm sure Bethesda's method has flagged alot of cheaters, it has the potential to false flag their most active players as well and they really need to take a second look at their method.
---
Why? I use an extra for muling legendaries, what's so bad about it? Doesn't break terms of service. 
---
Actually there a ton of ethical hackers these days, also known as white hats and we are preventing you and the websites you love to use from getting bodied by the big scary black hats. 
---
He states he's 2 different levels in the posts.. Unless his mule is lv 51, that doesn't add up... Very similar wording through them both. Looks very much like a dupers alt account stoking the fire, promoting bans as false positives to keep their cheating accounts.
---
I work in financial services and this is something that even I have to say several times a day. It's like, I'm just as qualified??
---
It always goes like this:
---
Customer: I need to speak to someone
---
Me: well what's your issue?
---
Customer: I'd rather talk to someone.
---
I. Am. Someone. 99% of the time I've been able to help.
---
The 900 hours guy posted it in his post
---
Jeeeez, no one care about all this ban bullshit, you really don't have anything better to do than spying on someone else's posts? Just play the game (or don't if don't like it) and stop that drama.  it's as interesting to me as what you ate for breakfast - I don't caaaaare.
---
I keep around 100 of each of my crafting supplies and that consumes a good amount of space. Add to that my growing PA collection and the handful of interesting weapons and I'm occasionally maxing out.  
---
That extra 200 should do the trick. 
---
I havent been banned on 76 because I've played less than like 30 hours. Not as interested in it. Thanks for your concern though. Take a cookie on the way out (:
---
In his post where he posted it for everyone to see for some reason.
---
You're doing Gods work, friend.
---
The one thing that stood out for me in his thread is the number of people who have mule accounts. I've used them before on games I enjoyed like Eve, WoW, GW2, etc... It's normal when dev's put stupid limits on character inventories. But what occurred to me is that the **real** population numbers of 76 are definitely lower that it might appear on the surface. With the almost immediate price drop for the game, it would be well worth it to get 3 or even 4 mule accounts to circumvent the stupid inventory management punishment all game devs LOVE to set up. So the real population of 76 is probably only 2/3rd's of what it appears to be.
---
The problem is they are being scrutinized quite a bit right now due to the past.   Bags, leaked info, ect.  Pretty certain all public responses are reviewed before being posted.     However, anything posted from their official source? You betcha its being reviewed, probably 2-3 times in review.
---
Except maybe the community managers on reddit.
---
Cheers!!! I wouldn't care if they had a system to breakdown perk cards and get the ones you need, but that is the type of foresight that was sorely lacking in the development of this game.  Hopefully, they will get this on their to-do list because it's a huge problem.  My card deck is littered with dupes I don't need.
---
Sure what is your account?
---
I'm not denying that he shouldn't of been banned, but what I am saying is that he isn't contradicting himself
---
I’m pretty sure that there is only 4 civil war era plans, both hats don’t work. If you find them just hold on to them for now haha I think that so few ppl have them that this is very low on the fix list :) 
---
I just build really silly traps and buildings on workbenches, sometimes just 50 Brahmin 
---
&gt;so someone having something doesn't impact my enjoyment of searching for it.
---
Well...
---
&gt;duping took the excitement out of finding rare loot.
---
no mention about taking the fun out of PvP. Or taking the fun out of trading. Or taking the fun out of anything except for the one thing you are now saying it doesn't take the fun out of.
---
You care entirely too much about this and it bothers me.
---
These people were making posts like these lies here the entire time. We've never "played the game in peace" except when we left this subreddit and moved to the trade discords
---
"I cheated, but I am not really a cheater" &lt;---- that is literally how you sound. you just took extra steps. 
---
I'm pretty sure that Vault Jumpsuit Shielded is +2 int, which is what the other thread lists. I have it in-game but cannot check at the moment. 
---
??
---
Hmm checked your post history and it seems you are selling ”almost every god tier item” and ”every rare item”.. you do know that sounds super shady as no legit player propably ever gets his hands on multiple tse guns and is willing to sell them all (as in tens or hundreds opposed to a few) 
---
This post reeks that you try to make it look like all the bans are false positives.
---
I would just like to know how you accuired ”almost every god tier item in the game” in a legit way
---
It's hard to say, because I am in "casual mode" with the game at the moment and there was some changes to White knight, but everytime I play, I run one scavenging run with four BF hotspots, and I still sometimes don't have enough.
---
spam away.. but watch the framerate.. It;s probably better now, but a lot of people would avoid explosives, because it would bog the game down during the SBQ fight. Also, when you hit other people, you will get a message in the top corner saying that you can't hurt people with pacifist on. 
---
I mean it could be bots, we don't really have a way of knowing, so I would be careful about spreading potential misinformation, that's one of the ways we ended up where we did (with all the mistrust and bad info floating around).
---
But I do agree, the game is much more fun if you just put all the hate aside and get to playing :)
---
I'm not spying on posts. I just noticed the same imgur link twice with very similar wording on 2 posts I came across in this sub. 
---
If in the event active and they are also in the event PvP is off in general till the queen dies or flys away.
---
I got “suspended”.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/aq2dlr/update_on_the_ufo/?st=JSBTTH5X&amp;sh=fb6c197e
---
Fully agreed. Or its bot accounts created to sneer Bethesda more. Which is possible.
---
Either way I find it strange how the '900 hour guy' gotten 10K upvotes within 18 hours by clearly lying. Very sketchy.
---
I know that this will get downvoted but honestly I think the wording is a bit inappropriate.       
---
I do totally understand that all those *I'm banned* posts are annoying. And indeed there will be exploiters in between. And I understand why everyone who invested a couple hundred hours into trading raise some eyebrowns.         
---
But I do not understand all those toxic comments on posts where people explain how they might got banned. Yes even the 900 hours dude. Because he is right: If you just help a friend transfering ammo it counts as ypur own ammo too! Now imagine having multiple friends...      
---
Some seem not do understand how broken this ban script is and that there are indeed thousand of false bans.      
---
###It's not impossible to craft 100k ultracite ammo!
---
Wrong. It totally is doable solo within 30 days. For .50 or 5mm you just need less then 500 fluxes. You get multiple fluxes per queen and you can kill her multiple times a day. Also you could trade fluxes you don't need for junk or fluxes you need. If you play in a small group and you just share stuff and help each other out you could craft 100k 5.56 ultracite too (2400 fluxes required = 80 per day).        
---
Also Bethesda did list standard ammo as well. So they're probably not just after Ultracite ammo.       
---
###... but only if play 24/7 !!!
---
Not true. Also just imagine you play with 1 friend and you help each other out to transfer ammo to a mule. Both of you need to own only 50k ammo. For a second you'll carry his 50k and he carries yours. Both would get flagged for 100k.      
---
Or imagine you just buy 5-10k ammo from a few other players. If you bought to much over 30 days you'll get flagged &amp; suspended.       
---
###Just stop being mad! Bethesda finally banned exploits, it' fine.
---
No it's not. They might banned exploiters too but I think the majority don't even know how exploits work.      
---
It's fine to take some hours or days off but I do totally understand why so many players are mad about that kind of ban-wave.       
---
###BUT THEY BANNED EXPLOITERS !      
---
Well... may some. But I don't understand why 100.000. If you exploit and duped 20.000 ultracite fusion cores, mini nukes &amp; grenades you're FAR from getting banned. But if you legit craft ammo where you get hundreds of per flux, then you're suspended. This can't be right.       
---
That' it. Thanks for reading :)
---
*Judge me, analyze my history, downvote all my posts. Do whatever you feel to. It won't change my mind. It's just sad to see how toxic &amp; ignorant this sub became. It was a lovely place once.*
---
Upvoting for making the effort. Lolz
---
Stop. Just...stop. Get the fuck over it and move on so the non-exploitative players can game in peace. I guarantee you that nobody outside of yourself and other exploiters give a rats ass about your bans and we'd all just rather you go circle-jerk on Obsidian's  front-page instead. 
---
Sincerely, probably a lot of us
---
still, nobody cares...
---
Definitely valid, but a full set of sentinel gear is exponentially harder to acquire than a suit of T-51b.
---
I'll throw my two cents in: Google suggested this to me on the homepage.
---
How'd he know it was not legit?
---
I just wanted to give some advice on how to protect yourself when you play the game legitimately. I've beenreported, falsely for stupid shit on gmod. Showed it to mods of the group and they let me back in. Play TV saves your ass. Idk who uses aim bot for gmod a silly game to play when drunk but it was not myself lol. 
---
Eh. Yet another reason to wait for Fallout 5. 
---
All plans for excavator are for sale at vendor bot greg in Grafton. He is at Trading Post building.
---
What's hot in this sub right now might disagree with you. 
---
Idk, there’s a lot of witch hunters running around that are pretty toxic.  
---
I don't even understand what you're trying to say but alright... you quoted something I never said?
---
lol I didn't know that violet flux were so important for high end ammo. I always vendored those flux from SBQ because they weigh so much. I only keep 10 of each stabilized flux in my stash to mod my power armor after I get the calibrated shocks plan / jetpack plan.
---
I do this with Legendaries I don't need whenever I'm at the Whotesprings. I place 1 in each garbage can, starting from the crafting area and working outwards.
---
I have the Chameleon Mutation, use One piece of Chameleon Armor, and all the Sneak Perks, I'm almost always in Party Chat.
---
I do not show on the Map or Radar (Compass), and even my team mates can't find me if I'm not moving, I have also tested this (I have two Xboxes, &amp; multiple accounts), and the only thing that will give away my position is for someone to get close enough to initiate a trade.
---
That's McSaltmaker. He's Irish.
---
I was bored before that.  I just sit here and wait for an update that seems enticing.
---
I'm cool with a temp ban, but permanently banning for that, especially on the first infraction, is a bit much.
---
I have a picture with that rock lol
---
Did they send you the list of what you did leading to this "suspension"?
---
Did you eat it?
---
What kind of fucking child types like this? 
---
It can be picked up in the wild, from people that dropped it, bought in the trader sections.  Unless you happen to be a player that follows reddit you would not even know if there was or was not a duping method.  If Bethesda decides you should not have more than 100k of an ammo type they could do other things, like not allowing you to carry more than that, actually telling you that they don't want you to have more than that amount.
---
Ive made and sold over 100k ammo over the last month. Youre fine. If you trade it to a mule character...not fine.
---
Just saw a thread where the op was insisting that all the banned players are pobs innocent, checked post history and well he was selling ”almost every god tier item in the game” as well as advertised having a shit ton of different tse weapons.
---
Yep, completely legit..
---
Toxic people.
---
" I've spent 7 to 8 hours on average a day "   ------  " I've played less than like 30 hours "
---
So you have played the game less than 5 days? Why are you here talking, Jussie? 
---
I read this post, and I find myself in a rare state of speechlessness...  So good...
---
I think its believable to craft 100k of ammo. But its not believable that you would keep it. I've certainly crafted over 50k of 5.56 and 50c. But guess what, ive used it lol handmade and 50c are hungry beasts and SBQ is a pain in the ass
---
This advice is good for anything really. Always fact check before blindly believing something. Even though when I saw those posts, my immediate thought was that it reeked of bs. I have no sympathy for dupers 
---
Actually he said he was banned before that, if you check my post in his banned topic. Doesn't mean he's a liar, he gave a reason. But yes that was my suspicion, as I'm suspicious of everything.
---
BS. That’s all.
---
It's good because it's true.
---
We have a guy in the trade discord mass-crafting ammo just to check, he was still playing as of yesterday. He said he was up to 30k 5.56
---
People seem to be confused about that. Dupers were not targeted, duped items were. You don't have to have ever used a dupe glitch.
---
well I had paid you 100 caps each :'D I was always low on violet flux :/
---
Great I’m sure you’re gonna do well.
---
Have you considered working in the state prison industry ?
---
Any specific issues you had ? Can you share what major bugs you are referring to ?  
---
Yes, the game has gotten better.
---
Nobody is getting banned for crafting ammo. I've literally crafted 60,000+ .50 cal ammo, at once, and I regularly trade large amounts of ammo/junk/legendary items back and forth between a mule account and my main account, and I'm fine.   
---
Don't cheat, and you won't get banned. 
---
Agreed, while the game has flaws and some annoying bugs the world/map is just brilliant.  
---
You might be right about them getting banned for cheating, but there are indeed lots of different issues with FO76, the game has been released too early imo [https://bethesda-softworks.pissedconsumer.com/complaints/RT-P.html](https://bethesda-softworks.pissedconsumer.com/complaints/RT-P.html)
---
My bad. But the point still stands that we are talking about duping taking the fun out of finding loot.
---
Well shit, a couple times I've had about as much 5mm as he had 5.56 on his secondary XD
---
What exactly is it that you tried to type here? 
---
XX--BATMAN19--XX
---
Average on the sims I legitimately said the sims, I gave an example of how long or often people can play a fucking game if you could have read that it clearly said the sims. Because I'm not playing multiplayer at work if I have to pause for when I'm needed. I dont sleep on my sleep shifts. Also I would play 76 more for sure if 76 worked well with google fiber. For some reason it's really slow in my area and I think it's because of google fiber. 
---
Imagine it was like a double xcell and raised all special by 4 :D
---
Don't play games with cheaters, I guess. 
---
I hope so, I mean, I don't even have a mule character...
---
all good
---
I have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Why must you turn this comment chain into a house of lies
---
Well i guess just items dissapearing was the most frustrating, but just the small bugs kinda ruined it for me for example enemies looking glitchy
---
Also has the spawn rate for junk increased? That was one of the major things that made me leave, you just couldn’t find adhesive and aluminium and all that
---
Ended up getting to it with 9 minutes left and completed it on my own! butchers bounty only ever gave my legs but I still got it solo!
---
The "din due muffin" crowd is crying about getting caught. they are jussie smallot clones 
---
Maybe 25 levels ago I was gifted a furious machete and have since noticed about 10 people with the exact weapon in their inventory. Now I might have snuck under their radar but I’ve made it through 2 patches with that weapon in my inventory. One would hope that an simple mistake would be overlooked, after all one oops is a lot different then 100k. 
---
Just fearing they have some auto-ban script running around, I hope this guy won't get ban in the next days 
---
Dupers getting banned and pretending to be innocent.
---
I think it's actually a bug that they don't.  I thought I read somewhere that only the vault 76 under-armor keeps its stats in power armor, but it doesn't sound like it based on your post.  Not sure if they're addressing it.
---
^This exactly. This bug drives me insane.
---
upvote for the ownage
---
yeah just wait until you cap out again. stash should of been at 1000lbs from the get go
---
It’s fairly easy to obtain thousands and thousands caps worth of stuff from whitesprings in a short amount of time. 98% of it is junk and is primarily used as vendor trash.
---
The issue is the logistics of actually vendoring it all. Like you said, you’ve got 1000 lbs worth of junk stuff on your account, and it’ll take almost 3 full days of trading to remove it (assuming you have access to enclave bunker, which I assume you don’t at low level) and even then it would be very tedious travelling between vendors over encumbered.
---
Better off collecting golfing outfits and selling them. Much higher cap/LB ratio.
---
His username checks out, just from this post.
---
Except Red.  Only guilty man in Shawshank.
---
And what proof would allow me to show you that you're wrong? 
---
Well, you're half right.  But in a way still wrong.  Have a drink!
---
I was lucky lol had a guy trade me \~72k 5mm rounds for free because he didn't need them. Awesome, right? I took them, but dropped or sold most of it because of weight. Narrowly missed the ban hammer on that one
---
Should we really be willing to believe a guy has played this game for 900 hours legitimately? The game has been out for about 2300 hours so far total. So that means he has played for one of about every two and a half hours that the game has been out. I just don't see how that is possible. 
---
I'm pretty sure that ammo and the mats used to create them are not rare, I don't care about your routine.
---
To my knowledge or to the best of it. The bans are hitting people with 100's of thousands of rare materials or those who have duped.
---
If you do not fall into either of those categories you should be fine.
---
In a month when I was playing 100k ammo is nothing .. Still not banned, cause I didn't do anything wrong. If you didn't do anything wrong, don't fear a ban.
---
When should the notification show? Before the Main menu i assume?
---
I recently bit the bullet and purchased a second account. It's great. Same as storing items on another character, except I can do it solo, instead of requiring a friend. 
---
It's just personal preference. I just can't get into a game without people populating the towns and giving out missions. Especially when all the others I've played do just that, and it works amazingly well. 
---
The whole multiplayer aspect is also a big turn off. I don't think a MP Fallout is a good idea at all, this is exactly why I never got into ESO; these games are about single player story imo, not many people sharing a story. 
---
Fusion cores arent too hard to come by especially if youre finding power armors. If you want to use PA at that level  maybe worth getting. Tbh i wouldnt get PA until lvl 25 when you can craft Excavator. It has way more benifts. +100 carry weight and +100 more if you can get calibrated shocks on it and like another 10 if you throw the motion assist torso on. 
---
Wait, we now have 800 lbs for stash?
---
Np
---
Here's hoping you stay banned cheater!
---
none of my friends got banned... I guess they weren't cheating
---
Cosmetic plans have random RNG spawns/drops to create character diversity and to entice people to trade. If everyone has the same stuff, no one will want/need to trade. Bethesda is trying to create an economy in the game, and will eventually come out with player vending. 
---
Most gaming subs have a handful that cry and moan.  
---
Ultracite and flux aside, the RNG for HR Fluids and Glowing Mass can be ridiculous some days. That's what makes that amount of ammo in a *relatively* short amount of time suspicious to me. Beth agrees it would seem
---
I think it’s hilarious that you think that it’s dumb but all of us who didn’t dupe or participate in duping didn’t get banned and are still playing.
---
You got what you wanted but at a price.
---
Note you really thought that Bethesda gifted you a big bag of booty?
---
People were bad at video games, so they cheated, then they got banned, now they're making threads here. 
---
Resist the urge, he's just a troll.
---
Sorry to deflate you a bit, but it's only temporary bans. They'll be back (unless we're real lucky and they finally move on from this game they love to hate)
---
Man this post made me cringe.
---
The loud minority.
---
He's full of shit
---
I think Bethesda is trying to save some of the players left in the game as I only did whitesprings for 8 hours and based on what I sold I probably got like 1500lbs+ of items myself and the rest of my team experienced similar rates. 
---
the dupers who were ruining the fo76 servers? 
---
Would the anti-armor legendary effect on a rifle with tank killer negate most of the the damage resistance?
---
When you play a game you play with one character. That's the point of the game. Each player is one character. Anything beyond that isn't very legit. As you said muling legendaries is pretty rediculous
---
Did Bethesda ban people with mule characters?  Oh, right they didn't.  They banned people with over 100,000+ rare items passing through in a short period of time.  Alcohol is a hell of a thing!
---
Wait till level 25 to do Miner Miracles and get the Excavator PA.
---
I had this yesterday. Doesn't seem to work in power armour
---
I went through 8k in one night farming queens 
---
Heh heh Penetration Testing lol 
---
How to be a smug prick, step 1.
---
I see this about 5% of the time. I call it the "golden server." It seems to affect drops on everything (like non-legendaries dropping legendary items 1/3 of the time or more. 10+ legendaries on a single run through of WS)  
---
I farm White Springs until I hit one, then farm the other high density mob spawn areas (WS, Westtech, Watoga HS, Sugar Grove, etc) in a ring until im so over-encumbered &amp; capped out ive gotta wait for a buddy to hop on for muling.
---
But he played 99999 hours! How could they do that to him!?!?!
---
Dang, son!
---
For everyone jumping on the guy with 900 hours by referencing this image, is there somewhere that the two have been positively connected, or are we just assuming because of the existence of 1 legit ban that his ban is also legit?
---
I don't think PA needs a buff, but it makes sense. I like that it would add another minor build-choice and add one more hard-to-acquire item to work towards (if they don't buy it for caps). Lastly, it would mark your underarmor as equipped and make you a little less likely to accidentally scrap, which sadly I've already done once. I like it, but I'd rank it as a low priority. 
---
Pretty sure they don't he started as soon as those reports rolled out. He said he did the 30k all at once
---
Im not sure how many people are just lieing to save fac, but from face value 100s to 1000s (its hard to get exact numbers) of players are complaining that bethesda has banned them unfaily by implemented a system that is banning people for having 100 000 "rare" items accumulated over a certain amount of time. Its hard to tell who, if anyone has actually been unfaily banned because noone records 100%of the time.
---
the latest ive heard is that bethesda will be doing a bunch of unbannings soon. 
---
Sorry i honestly wish i had more info because its starting to turn into a circus haha
---
Writing software is kinda hard. It could have been a big in some query that just selected the wrong accounts or something. 
---
Source: professional software engineer for 12 years. 
---
I got away with it because I didn't know the gun was loaded. I'm so sorry my friends. 
---
Should be fine. Ive talked to a lot of people who caught the ban and it seems mule characters are the 1 thing in common. I can see why because transferring between main and mules especially with caps will hit that 100k trading flag real fast.
---
Wow! u/Jullz-Wolf has shown the math. That is ridiculous!
---
Saved for future burns, thanks!
---
Why would you get banned for carrying ammo anyways?
---
He isn't talking about cheating or duping.  This guy wants anyone with more than one character (the others being used as bank toons) to get banned.  Check his posts.
---
&gt; You have to prove that you didn't do it. 
---
Actually the burden of proof should be on BGS to show evidence of cheating or exploiting. It appears, simply picking up a stack of a few thousand items is enough evidence.
---
However, they do not provide any of that in these messages but use them as a justification to ban paying users from their service, essentially breaking the product they sold. This also makes it impossible to avoid accidental bannings, like OP (supposedly).
---
When i first got the game i had all the evil intentions, the game had such a bad reputation that i didn't really cared about it...
---
But then...i started enjoying the game, i became attached to my little camp, i started to enjoy farming legendaries and well, it's not worth risking my account anymore. 
---
I never traded, and chances i won't trade with anyone while the current trading system is in place; i'm waiting for player shops or whateverthings they are.
---
I don't have everything i wanted, and since i'm not trading i either need to farm it myself (which i'm already doing or i would need access to the dev room for that, sooo bethesda if you're out there, how do i get inside that fancy room? and can you promise i won't get banned? :D
---
Unfortunately, I'm not certain that's how their triggers work.  It appears to trigger on if you had more than 100,000 items over 30 days.  So the way I interpret that is to mean if you had 50,000 5mm one day, used it all up, and got 75,000 5mm in trade the next day, that could trigger the ban (50,000 + 75,000 = 125,000).  However we have no idea what items are triggering this, so 5mm is just an example.
---
"When you play a game you play with one character." 
---
No. When *you* play a game, *you* play with one character. I bought the game twice, I'll do whatever I want as long as it doesn't break the terms of service and you have no right to tell people they aren't playing *legitimately* just because you don't like it. 
---
It shouldn't matter if you have mules.  People rely on mules who don't dupe.  I have a couple.  One holds some extra junk (rarer stuff).  The other holds cool weapons that I may use in the future but can't justify stashing on my main.
---
Welcome to the game that the didnt play and have no f\*cking clue about balancing... sad but true story -,-
---
If you think about it: 10K upvotes about a guy falsely saying he's innocent while clear evidence is in our faces is just idiotic. It's either bots or his fellow dupers. Bots are easy to create, so I wouldn't be suprised if that was the case.
---
But yeah Fa76 regardless is fun when playing the game how it's meant to be played. I hope the PvP Survival Mode next month ditches the caps loss/reward system since everyone will be beyond broke lol. Plus it'd be a great opportunity for true Raider groups to spring up, that'll be fun especially setting up ambushes against Raider gangs, the Roleplay opportunities are going to be endless! 
---
All this hate is driving people away, the misinformation/lying is really causing a split in the fanbase. I hope this montsh/next months updates restore their faith in Bethesda. Seeing how they are going to fix the game more and are actually listening to us is a huge step in the right direction. 
---
I still have hope for Fallout 76 to succeed. Even though it'll take time.
---
Sure thing, I spent way too much time making it this morning lol
---
You should use a seriously edgy “you’re” next time.
---
The thing is, these damage reduction don't factor with the damage resistance. It reduces ur own damage by said number. So when you attack, your damage is minus that number.
---
Antiarmor kicks in then and helps ur dps vs damage resitance.
---
At least that is how I understood from another dude here on reddit that made a far more better detailed damage test explaining this. I will try to find it and link it here.
---
I know. I just like engaging with trolls because really they live a sad life. Some sort of neglect or lack of love must lead them to live these lives online that lets them feel big and powerful.
---
Rules of the Wasteland... Rules of the Wasteland...
---
This is just angry BS.  BGS probably has just done the best thing they could for the game and its performance by the ban wave.
---
Okay so you can account for the 300k ultracite. What about the other 300k ammo? Can you really produce 600k ammo in 30 days legitimately. If so, I'll give my account info and you can record yourself doing it. I'd love to have half a million ammo.
---
I figured nobody would miss all those hobos 
---
And true I did the enclave at 18 and nuke launched at 34 so I could sell there haven't been a real brotherhood guy on fallout 76 so I'm still putting it off and for defiance has the straitjacket which is even better in the caps department. I finished my xo1 set yesterday and launched another nuke so I've fought the queen twice and I see where people are coming from for example from the queen kills I got a 1star instantiating golf club then second kill I got a vampire pickaxe.
---
Are we thanking them for basic fixes now? 
---
I worked in a call center for 7 years, never worked that way.
---
I’m not sure what you are saying here. 
---
If a company has a history of messing up changes to their database such that data is lost, they no longer get the benefit of the doubt. There may be issues with how they handle change management. They may have cavalier employees who don’t follow safeguards in place to avoid such things. 
---
I don’t know how their data is stored, but from experience, I can say that when you deal with huge volumes of data such that queries take hours to finish (or hours before failing due to some resource issue), it is very tempting to not do all the testing and verification you would like to do. And even if they nailed the query, there is the question of their tolerance for false positives in their criteria.
---
I get why they aren’t allowing appeals. If a lot of people were suspended, it could take an absurd amount of resources to investigate all appeals. Ideally, the ban is short and they have a dupe fix ASAP. But basing on amount of an item without consulting a record of how that was acquired doesn’t seem reliable to me. People in MMOs who are into farming mats can get absurd amounts. I remember when ESO launched, I was in a guild with a member who essentially did nothing all day but farm mats for crafting. He also played all day because he was on disability. 
---
The queen drops them all the time. I've legitimatly looted at least 6 Adrenal Reaction recipes from her, and you get a ton of flux just for completing the Scorched Earth event. 
---
A lot of people just drop nukes and farm the queen for legendaries once they reach the end game so it's very possible for him to have acquired that stuff without duping. You can drop 3 nukes every 3 hours, so if you have a few friends you can kill her multiple times a day. I'm level 162 and have an abundance of rare plans, weapons, armor and flux that I've looted in the game.
---
I doubt that 5mm ammo is considered "rare", but idk
---
I'll keep saying this: go on the CS:GO steam forums. Look at how many people are simultaneously complaining about there being no anti-cheat and about being falsely banned. Can't have both at the same time, can we? Happens in pretty much every game I've played that actively enforces bans. Idk if people want attention, or they think going on a forum is going to get them unbanned, or if they just want to get negative attention to the game, but a vast majority of the people claiming false bans anywhere are full of shit, and considering this sub's history of being full of shit, I'm not keeping my hopes up
---
This was very big problem. After I picked up the stuffs I could not move anymore. So I have bent in the train station for 3 weeks. It very much change the game for me and was sacrifice. I could only talk to peoples when they would come in to train station and I could shoot out at the cups and chairs in train station. I’ll could also listen to my music and stuff too. 
---
No it was blank lol.  
---
yes.
---
Get some grape nuke cola from the soda parlor in white springs. It removes rads and not mutations. Or try to get sun kissed(removes dads during the day).
---
It’s meant to be comical and not taken seriously 
---
Yes. 
---
Upvote for clever title
---
Actually non legends drop legends because the diseased prefix will overrule
---
I thought the massive ban wave and dupers being caught made the servers stable? Shocked it didn't work tbh.
---
And I found about 2 golden servers they were insane 10+ legends per wave :D
---
Wait he got banned from Fallout 4 for duping in Fallout 76?
---
to be fair I have like 15k 5mm ammo. That's after 200 hours of playing, picking up every bullet I ever found, and only using a two shot gatling gun for a little while.

I killed a bloated glowing one last night with ‘scorched wendigo’ label on its dead body. 
---
RNG loot, though rare.  I’ve gotten 3 off of kills. Honeybeast and Flatwoods monsters, I believe.
---
Every legendary is a random drop except the ones you get from quests
---
I love this.
---
Here you are pointing out how the amount of ammo he has is proof he cheated, and in a different thread someone is claiming the screenshot of the bethesda ticket might be faked, as he has much ultracite ammo than this guy did, and hasn't been banned and therefore it isn't the ammo that got 900hours guy banned.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as2veo/banthesda_could_we_get_some_numbers_for_this/egso9uf/
---
Two completely opposite reactions to the exact same screenshot of a reason for someone being banned.
---
I am thoroughly convinced the devs don't play the game or if they do then they don't play it enough and not as every playstyle.  It isn't surprising that some percentage of the devs don't play it, I am just concerned it is a much larger percentage than it ever should be.
---
i ate half of it kept getting pellets stuck in my teeth ;)
---
Shared stash would be wonderful. Is that going to be a thing.?  :)
---
Ok, thx. I might as well leave it in the stash then instead of lugging it around.
---
Got one from a mob aswell as drop. Must be in the loot table.
---
There is a big balancing patch coming sometimes...probably...in a distant future...and it may not affect TS. 
---
True, it's possible that wouldn't have been banned. Bethesda replied to the 900 hours guy and listed the items he was banned for, total of 360k ultracite ammo, but they also included normal ammo types over 100k as further evidence.
---
Goddamn it, the one guy I was willing to trust and turns out he’s a liar. This sub is in the midst of a civil war.
---
have you duped stuff? then dont worry. i;m level 270 made more ammo then these dupers have duped. my 2 accounts are fine.
---
I've only been kicked once in the last 2 or 3 weeks. 
---
did all dupers get banned or just those excessively abusing dupes?
---
I swear I'm innocent! All that Psycho and Buffout was just sitting there in an abandoned CAMP! So what if the bullet holes in those players match the bullets from my handmade? It's a coincidence   I tell ya! The toilet was clogged too. How come no one is mentioning that? Bastards deserved to get a pack of Ferals sicced on them!!
---
You can’t really be bad at this game.
---
That's some Gordon Gekko shit right there
---
bored because not much left to do yes. no one i know was banned. because i dont play with dupers.
---
I think not all of them are liars or cheaters, rather they've picked up some duped stuff. The script should give a warning when a player tries to pick up 'wrong stuff'  so players will have to blame only themselves and not Bethesda in reviews [https://bethesda-softworks.pissedconsumer.com/review.html](https://bethesda-softworks.pissedconsumer.com/review.html)
---
The only thing I'm a little worried about is a paper bag I picked up in Artisan's Corner which contained about 2000 ballistic fiber, screws and springs. It was almost certainly produced by duping. I suspect it falls well below the critical threshold for Bethesda to give me a hard time about it, but I guess you never know. I've been giving away stacks of 100 of these scraps to people, partly to ameliorate the carry-weight and partly because I know I'm not wholly entitled to it. 
---
I don't think you can break floors
---
Eh not really
---
Don’t be talkin bout that Whitesprings cobalt flux! Also, if top of the world is nuked, there is a lot of cobalt over by the pond and the road to the BBQ.
---
Right when you try to sign into the Bethesda account so yeah.
---
Yes I thought was weird to. But finders keepers right?
---
That's what I was thing should be best. Thanks for thor input
---
You get a pass on heavy wep ammo- can craft 300+ a pop, and pretty easy to use up thousands in a queen fight.
---
SHIELDED VAULT SUIT GIVES WHAAAAT
---
Ok , thank u very much
---
It's kind of low to purchase a game twice to get an edge but do whatever. And it's not legit to purchase something to get an edge on other players. And I'm not telling you it's not legit I'm informing you, because it is a fact. Just because you are willing to spend money to do better in a game does not make it a legitimate strategy or part of the game.
---
Bet you are fun at parties. 
---
That's what I read thinking I should do. Thanks for thor input 
---
You deserve it at this point for still playing this abomination. 
---
Hopefully doesn’t create any annoying bugs
---
lol wasn't trying to *own* anyone. just pointing out some bad math and how, based on the info presented, the guy is more likely to be illegitimate than legit.
---
They did a passive aggressive spring cleaning, then a shotty ban wave. 
---
HAHAHAHA!
---
Good post mate
---
\+1
---
Your understanding of the 30-day period is correct, I hardly use 5mm though so there's no way I would have organically come across 28k myself. Also after looking into it more, it seems normal ammo types are not triggering the bans, but are used as additional evidence for bans triggered by rare items.
---
&gt; a bot or just some seriously edgy no-lifer
---
That's really the best you've got?
---
God it's not even worth talking to idiots like you.
---
Thank you very much! I understand now. I was incorrectly thinking of the sentinel effect being an armor effect. But of course it's not. As you says it just flat out reduces the attackers damage, which is why it is so OP. Good to know the critical hits ignore it though. I think you have basically come up with an anti-griefer build :-)
---
Yeah, no. Stash limit needs a *significant* increase. This is not enough.
---
Time travel.  Time never travel changes.
---
I get where you're coming from, but it's really hard to prove you *didn't* do something. That's why our Justice system puts the burden of proof on the accuser.
---
I got all Versions of PA. And started with Raider. It's not so hard to come by. There are spawn points near or in the forrest. Great River Gorge Bridge for example (long time i did this, it's the west entrance afaik). Just server hop a little. should not take you so long.
---
Hehe penetration lol
---
I bought the game for myself and my girlfriend and she didn't like it, so I used her account for muling. It's completely legitimate, I'm not fucking anyone over by doing this, and it doesn't break the terms of service. It's only *not legitimate* in your eyes. That's just your opinion, which you're entitled to no matter how flawed it is 👍
---
Will this patch also unban players?
---
How did you manage to play so long? I made it to the overseers camp outside the vault and decided this was a trainwreck of a game. 
---
SQB loot tables?
---
4) is the only even remotely reasonable one. I'd feel bad for the people who found dupers and tried disrupting them then tossed all the cheated items away, but I have no pity for the people who took all the duped items and used it themselves, saying it's fair because they stole it from a cheater.
---
Nobody gets banned for crafting too many serums or mods. Nobody happens to have enough flux lying around to make 200,000 ultracite ammo. I can tell you that I've crafted thousands of marine tactical helmets to sell throughout a month and, surprise surprise, I haven't been banned. 
---
Essentially this.
---
Weapons: Flare Guns have been removed from the legendary weapon list, as they can’t benefit from legendary mods.
---
What about drill and syringer? Both do not have legendary mobs and still drop as legendary loot.
---
&gt;Well i guess just items dissapearing was the most frustrating, but just the small bugs kinda ruined it for me for example enemies looking glitchy Also has the spawn rate for junk increased? That was one of the major things that made me leave, you just couldn’t find adhesive and aluminium and all that
---
Enemies looking glitchy ? like not coming alive when yo see them ? no that still happens.
---
Junk spawn rates? I did not know it is/was an issue.  I get plenty of junks by playing and using resource gathering on junk piles.  
---
Adhesive is simple to get, just farm it (tato, corn and mutfruits and the perks that double gathering and the super duper when cooking it )
---
Well, I was drunk all weekend and apparently missed this ban wave, but it sounds like ammo totals are now Soul Memory from DKS2 which had its problems to put it mildly.  Somebody holding 100k ultracite ammo at one time is obviously suspicious to me, but if the game is instead tracking their total amount across their overall gameplay, aka Ammo Memory, that is inevitably going to eventually sweep up anybody who likes weapons that use a lot of ammo.  As I've often said, ironically the least frustrating way to play this game is still as someone who wears a burlap sack and fights with a stick.
---
Unless a legendary has a special name like All Rise, Bunker Buster, or Silver Lining (for examples) it's a total random drop.
---
I don’t care? My comment said they fucked him. They did. Whether he fucked himself is another issue
---
My tse flare guns nooooo /s
---
Nice, but kind of dissapointed. Can't keep playing with this content, but I will be back when new arrives.
---
in my post above, special stat bonuses do not apply when wearing under armor, and testing shows that under armor provides no damage resist bonuses either. it would be nice if they allowed them too
---
oh my oh my!!! here we go.
---
i have several friends who bought a stick but its collecting dust because they prefer controllers.
---
That makes the cheating even more stupid.
---
I pretty much did my run through up until I got the excavator by running in just the frame. However, it's not hard to get the lvl 15 Raider power armor so if you want one it will be an easier grind for the Excavator than just running on the frame. 
---
[The place is called "The Crosshair", you might have to server hop a couple of times, but for me it always spawns level 15 PA. It's a fun trip to the location so you could think of it just as another quest if you really want to. If you are on PC and need some help getting it let me know.](/spoiler) 
---
If the game has to ban you out of suspicion and you have to write an essay to detail how, I would rather lip sync for my life.
---
tell me about it, i've accidentally scrapped my under armor 2 times. luckally i have the plans for the vault 76 jumpsuit and the shielded lining
---
Yeah dude, this is a witch hunt. You guys shouldn't be doing Bethesda's support work on their behalf, and you guys definitely shouldn't be scrutinizing people's past posts on what presumably is their hobby.
---
I don't know how they decide to ban someone or not, neither do you, like I said, if the dude with "900 hours" thread is correct and "innocent", the hammer ban could fall for other innocents.
---
I don't know if he is and I'm not interested to know to be honest, just wants to make sure "legit" players like you (apparently) and me doesn't risk anything.
---
Fuckin’ Bethesda. They’re running this game like a bunch of Nazis.
---
get rekt 
---
Im just saying that finding a bag with junk and picking it up shouldn't result in being banned.
---
Can we get some action on this please, /u/ladydevann?
---
Well mules are whats kicking the flags because people are dumping tons of stuff on them. Especially caps. If you transfer 25k caps from your character to a middle man and back to your mule. Thats 25k caps x 2 trades which means youre halfway to being flagged for the 100k item trade in 10 minutes. As long as you're not dumping too much on mules you won't get flagged.
---
If you try to use them from the pip boy they’re bugged, but if you set them to your favourite wheel and use them from there they will work. Hope this helps. 
---
Correlation is not causation my friend. Those people getting banned are getting banned because of excess dupes, not having mules. Excess dupes means excess weight, which can only really be remedied by a mule at that point.
---
I'm affraid you'll wait a long time - this game is broken and unbalanced - currently rolling pins and pool cues make more damage than high-tech weapons...
---
To be fair, it was more like "I cheated before but am not currently a cheater"
---
Bad game AND bad service. Damn....
---
That guy added that image to his post.
---
I logged in this morning to do my vendor run and the sack outside of the Whitesprings station was so full it looked like somebody dumped their entire inventory into it. It wasn't duper-level item counts but literally weapons, armor, food, meds, holo tapes, plans, junk, ammo... it's like they decided to quit the game and just put everything they owned in that sack.
---
I just hit lvl 100 and still have never seen him or the flatwoods monster. I wish the cryptids spawned a little more frequently. That's one of the things in this game that really sets it apart from the other games and I particularly enjoy. The weird thing is that I see wendigos and the grafton monster all the time.
---
And you wonder why people shit talked this game to hell and back.
---
Fuck always online multiplayer bullshit. How do I block this sub on mobile? It's all bullshit. Ban me plz idgaf
---
its possible it was doctored. it's also possible those people are lying about their numbers or have been banned themselves. its also possible that the numbers on the email reflect his current stash and not total traffic. wasn't 900 hours guy the one that shared the screenshot though? why would he edit it?
---
Regardless, that amount of ultracite ammo is obscene and at minimum requires hundreds of hours of dedication for that ammo alone, without using it. 
---
your original point was that the numbers presented were feasible. my argument is that while it is technically possible, it would take the majority of his total playtime dedicated just to crafting that ammo to get that amount.
---
you're now moving the goalposts. im not making a blanket statement about the bans, and i am not commenting on the legitimacy of the email (that you cited in the first place). im solely commenting on the fact that it is highly unlikely he legitimately crafted that amount of ammo. it just doesn't add up based on the info presented.
---
No doubt - appreciated the post.  
---
People acting like crafting with ammosmith / super duper can result in 10s of thousands of rounds rather quickly conveniently leave out the time it takes to farm all the required mats.
---
No, they will probably passively aggressively tell you to kick rocks.  If you buy a plane ticket and go to Beth and begin flipping tables, you may get your answer.  100% recommend this route.
---
In turn makes them dump 100k into mules which kicks the flags. Its the excessive trading or transferring at once that kicks it not getting 300 can chimes and making 10k rounds.
---
&gt; **Diseases:** Rad Worms now only increases radiation damage taken by 50%, and no longer incorrectly increases Mutation and other effects. 
---
:-(
---
I don't know what else to do with them. I was playing on the weekend had a good run without any crashes and had them cranking out at the power station. I still have 15 of them
---
Haha this is awesome
---
Good now you don't have to play this crap.
---
You would be suprised how many players in sentinel get shocked when the critical breaks through. I normally get area chat accusations of being a hacker because it's impossible my bullet can break through and one shot a full sentinel assassin gear.
---
Perks for damage output, full rifle perks, tank killer maxed, bloody mess, demo lv4 (useless cuz of dense/fireproof), adrenaline mutation plus bloodied weapon, health at 25%. Eagle eye for bonus crit damage, and covert operative if u get the sneak multiplier. 
---
It's not what your looking for. Checked stats and it's neither of those. Can just have it if you want it. 
---
So out of curiosity, what would you consider convincing evidence that someone was banned for no reason?
---
Oh great more stash space yay!
---
What is the point of this post, anyway?
---
Are you looking for attention, is that it?
---
"Feed the People" ... ***^(SHOTGUN SHELLS!)***
---
Oh so you agree that martial artist was affecting the speed of the Gatling so you fixed it?
---
Could ... you know FIX THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE GATLING GUN TOO WHILE YOUR THERE!
---
Happy with these notes, notably the Scorchbeast, stash, and Grenade Launcher changes!
---
It's time for yet another bug list.

***Bugs***
---
* Cryolator uses wrong ammo model for reload, uses yellow fusion cells instead of blue cryo cells
---
* Cryolator Crystallizing Barrel projectiles have a delayed impact/damage on targets, similar to the problems Plasma weapons had on release
---
* Plasma Cores still incorrectly use the Fusion Core model, the model is visibly different when reloading the Gatling Plasma
---
* Nuka Quantum Grenades have a tiny explosion radius, 1/8 the size of a standard Nuka Grenade explosion (50 units vs 400 units)
---
* Ultracite Laser/Enclave Plasma weapons have the wrong preview model: when you 'inspect' them, they appear like normal Plasma/Laser weapons, but when equipped you can see they have different color schemes
---
* There are 2 [floating wall trims](https://imgur.com/a/RUc96qf) in Berkeley Springs
---
* A bus stop in Watoga has occlusion planes inside of geometry that has gaps, this lets the player [see the surrounding buildings become unloaded](https://imgur.com/a/iki1ZEG)
---
* There is a building in Watoga that is [missing a roof](https://imgur.com/a/Pv7GEnh), you can reach unintended areas this way
---
* When a Yao Guai is dismembered via Bloody Mess, a piece of the [torso always floats](https://imgur.com/a/cBUByaH) in the air without physics (nearly 100% reproduction)
---
* As of 1/29 patch, your player name shows up in the team menu as if you are an additional member of the team (even though this is probably a bug, it's pretty useful for making sure perk cards are shared/seeing HP in a terminal)
---
* As of 1/29 patch, if you have 2 weapons of the same type and one is favorited, relogging will cause the unfavorited one to become favorited instead of the original
---
* As of 1/29 patch, if you have more than one weapon of the same type favorited, relogging will cause all versions to become unfavorited besides one
---
* Fusion Generators are lit up and make sound regardless of if they have a core or not (likely related to the lower % chance to spawn a core introduced on 1/10)
---
* Subsequent Serendipity procs will create a backlog of sound/animation
---
* Radaway no longer shows a bar that says Rads -300, only disease resist -50; the only place the number '300' is shown is the description, and the displayed number does not change when you equip Pharmacist (affects Diluted too)
---
* 'Use 76 Bobbleheads' challenge is not counted correctly, I completed it by drinking purified water
---
* Some challenges are tagged as complete as soon as you log in, without doing anything and without recieving any atoms
---
* When Power Armor Targeting HUD/Berry Mentats affects one person, the effect is visible for all nearby players, even when not grouped and not part of the same event
---
* Treasure mound dust effect (after you dig it up) sometimes shows up as purple squares (typically means the texture is missing)
---
* Toxic Valley Treasure Map #3 - The mound for this map often cannot be interacted with
---
* Dead Feral/Scorched Officers will drop a Silo Piece (sometimes multiple) on the ground near them that cannot be interacted with
---
* Urban Scout Armor Left Arm has 15 less ballistic resistance than its Right Arm counterpart - no other armor set behaves this way
---
* Urban Scout Armor Arm pieces have less ballistic resistance than Leg pieces - in every other armor set, the arms/legs have equal resistances (before mods)
---
* If you deploy a mine and then pick it back up, it appears in your inventory as a separate item from the main stack of mines, each individual mine will appear as its own stack after pick up
---
* 'Vampire's' affix has one extra space after it, ex: "Vampire's  Ripper" vs "Vampire's Ripper"
---
* There is a duplicate version of the Bowler Hat, simply named 'Bowler', that is separate from standard Bowler Hats but not discernably different
---
* 'Asylum Worker Hat Forrest' is spelled incorrectly - 'Forrest' should be 'Forest'
---
* Arktos Pharma - Test Log 5-31-77-P3 appears on a security door terminal in Arktos Pharma, likely an error since the same log appears on the Arktos Lab Terminal in Flora Research
---
* Kanawha Nuka-Cola Plant - Current Product Status terminal has an entry 'Sea Lion'; when opened, the entry incorrectly states the product codename as Walrus instead of Sea Lion
---
* Project Beanstalk - The Pharmabot chemical sprayer uses the Mr Handy flamer attack as a base, so it sets the terrain on fire when spraying
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Turn down SAM Turret missile volume, with the rate they spam missiles they are deafening
---
* Allow us to use any type of Stimpak to revive teammates - currently you cannot use Super Stimpaks/Diluted to revive
---
* Nuke Silo keypad needs to be lit better, you can barely see the numbers you have entered
---
* Ability to display 'Jarred Scorched Head/Hand/Foot' in CAMP
---
* Ability to view CAMP budget (and the items it consists of) and remove them without needing to manually find/scrap the item, this could help with invisible items that take up budget
---
* Ability to view how much budget an item will take before you place it
---
* Scorchbeast Queen needs to either not become a meatpile at all, or needs a special meatpile to separate her from the rest
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Apply the change that was made to Plasma Weapons (most/all are now hitscan and not projectile) to the Cryolator Crystallizing Barrel, its current projectiles have very delayed impact
---
* Need more 'wild' Crystal nodes, there appears to be only one non-workshop crystal node on the entire map
---
* Lifetime Challenges for cooking different food, ex: "Cook 25 Smoked Scorchbeast Lungs", "Cook 10 Pumpkin Pies"
---
* Bring in more legendary effects! Return some of the old ones (ex: last bullet in the chamber does double damage, % chance to set enemy on fire when blocking), and introduce some new ones!
---
* Ability to upgrade a weapon's level; it's pretty sad to find an awesome 3 star legendary only to realize it's level 15, and this also would remove the gimmick of stalling your quests until you are level 50 to gain the highest level version of quest rewards (such as All Rise)
---
On PS4 the update is 4.6 GB 
---
Did he put 500 rounds on the SBQ while you helped him with the scorched and ghouls? All I ever get from SBQ was tire irons and walking cane, yet one night last week when all other players were hiding and minding their own business i was the only one keep firing at the queen with my bloodied Gatling. Matter of fact when she was hovering she only attacked me while I kept firing at her. When she died I got a hunter’s Gatling with exploding bullets while I heard others complained about their rolling pins. That made me think maybe the reward system was tweaked so that the more you damage the queen the better weapon you’ll get. 
---
They nerfed its damage while doing nothing for the accuracy debuff it already suffered.  All they need to do is lighten up on that now that it doesn't do much more damage but is way less accurate than a non-legendary.  I doubt they'll ever retouch TS weapons though.  I think they're gonna be stuck in nerf oblivion for a while.
---
Stash increase is welcomed ! That's at least 2 weeks of content for me right there
---
I hope to god they don’t fix that, that is amazing. 
---
&gt; since 95% of the time your issue can be fixed by a typical agent.
---
Then why dont' they fix it before you have to call in?
---
Hence why I said " To my knowledge".
---
But in general, even if he duped once to see if he could that could have easily flagged his account.
---
Again "TO MY KNOWLEDGE", as I am not privy to the way BGS does or handles shit.
---
But while BGS is not exactly known for doing things the proper way, one can ASSUME that one would be fine if they did nothing wrong. The only reason you'd truly need to worry is if you did anything wrong.
---
Worst case if you honestly did nothing? You have to explain yourself to BGS and lose out of a few days.
---
My advice. Keep calm and do you. If you're honestly doing nothing wrong that is.
---
I'm trying to find the guy who did the damage testing properly here on reddit. I will link it here as it would be very useful as it provides better details than my own.
---
It's a small sample but I'm 2 for 2 on Ultracite Explosive Vents post-tweak. It's probably just lore appropriate, as the Queen likes to eat humans in PA with explosive vents. 
---
Everybody already does this. That's why the ticketing system where I work has a customer facing priority and an internal priority the customer can't see. We use the internal one.
---
Not a bad update. Waiting on my adsl to download it lol. 
---
Talk about a complete and total waste of time. Hello? Buehler... Buehler... Move on. No one cares about a shit game and your experience... Didn't you catch the whole "wow this is the shittiest video game in the last 20 years" buzz? Do u live under a rock? Invest your time in something less stupid. Like.. watching reruns of the Puppy Bowl.  Counting stars.. Anything! Ffs man.. 
---
If you're "Looking for another no man's sky," you need to wait longer. It was almost exactly a year before No Man's Sky got update 1.3 started shaping up.
---
If you're in it for the long game, it's going to be a LONG game.
---
I've been lucky enough to see a ton of Mothman the last couple weeks. But now I'm not seeing Flatsey anywhere. Been a few weeks since we bumped into him. 
---
I admit that I myself really dont like fallout 76 (for many reasons I'd rather not list right now lol) but I'm with you on this, Bethesda needs to get their head straight in order to provide a good service to their fans. Theyve messed up so much recently that they should be trying a lot harder than they are to fix it, which honestly is starting to make me think that this game was an easy out for making another fallout game due to what seems like an enormous lack of effort on their part
---
Wait so you got banned?  I’m confused.
---
"I didn't dupe the ammo! I only crafted the ammo with duped items! oh wait, I wasn't supposed to say that! DELETE DELETE DELETE" #derp 
---
From what I've heard yes. 
---
I am still a bit salty that 'Wind Instruments' is just a tuba.  Just say tuba!  Don't get my hopes up that there is a trombone or trumpet or kazoo.
---
I think that with the way the game is going, I will be waiting for a long time.  Even a content update won't get me back in the game.  I don't want to have to deal with the same poorly balanced shit just to explore some vaults in the future.  I want to be able to play the game without also wanting to pull my hair out.
---
You can even launch a Fatman into the crowd of melee around a SBQ in pacifist mode if you want, used to be my go-to qeen strat before the explosives go nerfed to oblivion.
---
I haven't been disconnected for a long time. 
---
\&gt;First and foremost I know going through a users post history is generally frowned upon
---
I disagree, I actively encourage people to go through my post history to see that I've been consistent with my anger at Bethesda the past few weeks due to my constant disconnects on the game, and that I'm not just some rabid fanboy, rather I'm just have played enough MMOs to not trust "innocent" players. 
---
Taking something someone said out of context or using very old posts without acknowledging posts in between (for example if todays patch solved my issues I may start to enjoy the game again) would be rude, but I mean, it's sometimes the only way to detect trolls or catch people in lies.  
---
NMS had 2 years before it became better. This one has only 3 months. Not defending Bethesda here, just stating the obvious
---
After the last patch junk that you bulked up would be scrapped if you hit scrap all junk. When do you think this will be sorted?
---
Yeah, and they can answer any balancing questions with this upcoming "big balancing patch".
---
That's a fair question. Personally, I haven't ran into any game-breaking bugs, and the general consensus is that at least the majority of people that are complaining about being banned did on fact dupe (time will tell). I got the game for $40 and have had almost 200 hours of generally very fun gameplay.
---
That being said, from your post, it doesn't sound like you want to try the game, which is fair stance. So... don't.
---
Pretty sure I saw this. He was like a level 183 I think. I was watching it happen on my map as I was working on a few things in my camp. Went to explore and decided to steer clear of Mr. Wanted since he would easily take me out as a lowly level 31 currently.
---
Props to you for helping those in need!
---
Im more annoyed by attaching that scope on gatling guns... its not even centered bethesda wtf
---
So they are adding a mothman power armor?
---
Lame.  I was/still am hurt myself.  It’s better, but when it first happened I was playing COD: Advanced Warfare and then BO3 every day.  It absolutely helped me through some hard times, and I can absolutely understand your frustration.  Hoping it gets fixed for you ASAP!
---
That has always been the trade off for two shot legendary affix, more damage but more spread. It's been like that since FO4. 
---
I was always against them nerfing the two shot affix by so much since it already had two big things going against it: the additional bullet doesn't gain damage from perks and the accuracy goes way down.
---
While not as noticeable on snipers, two shot on any other type of weapon is significant enough. 
---
That all being said two shot on a shotngun was only good when paired with explosive bullets since it gave you an extra pellet and all you damage came from the explosive effect. A two shot shotgun by itself wasn't anything too special pre or post nerf.
---
Why did you repost their post.
---
Over 400k Ultracite ammo across 2 accounts being held in a 30 month period. As in during some point in a 30 day period he had over 400k ultracite ammo in his accounts. 
---
&gt;Workshops: You can now contest a Workshop that’s owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop’s build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it’s been barricaded by the owner.
---
What is this? It's so stupid. I can sit far outside rendering all defence useless?
---
I put 4 up but honestly imo it's the least reasonable of those 3...      
---
(5.) affects everyone playing with a couple friends or as part of a clan.     
---
And regarding (6.) you only need 500 fluxes for 100k+ of ultracite .50 or 5mm. Over 30 days. That's just 2-3 queen kills each day and fluxes you don't need you could trade for junk required to craft ammo. You need help in queen battles but you could get 100k+ ultracite ammo solo(!) just by farming 2 hours a day and trading those fluxes you don't need.     
---
Imo those are far from being unrealistic or even 'hard to gather'.
---
Also don't forget to sleep with everyone's girl and boyfriends who worked on the game just to show dominance
---
Have fun, enjoy! But be careful with the big numbers
---
Hope you get unbanned rather sooner than later
---
Ooooh majestic FO76 subreddit's Magic 8-ball, what shall we be mad at tomorrow?
---
&gt;Reply hazy, try again.
---
Depends on armors and such. Might have legendaries that reduce weights for items.
---
you are not worth people time
---
So the red mothman headlamp I have won't be available? Otherwise solid update 
---
It is, but most of the people with full sets didn’t get them via random drop. They traded for pieces  or bought a set off eBay. 
---
My question is who got banned that didn't dump stuff on mule characters? Ive yet to find one so far and 100% believe this is how you hit the 100k trading flag. 
---
This!! Absolutely this! Also can you let us put the cards we dont want to use or even see face down?
---
They’re literally 5 posts down.
---
Yes shotguns are tricky, it’s mostly used for close quarters but when they suddenly get too close (like machete welding zealots) you easily blast yourself to death. I have two bloodied pump and one battle shotgun but don’t use them very often now. Gatling and 50cal can mow them down from a good distance. I can easily shoot down flying scorchbeast with those but with shotty i have to patiently wait for them to land first, that can take a while. 
---
Based on my level 35 trapper armor about 4-8 pieces to build and around 3 or 4 to repair.  Been a while so might not be 100% accurate.  
---
The problem is at level 25 is when ballistic become required but you can't access good farming spots until much higher level 
---
Question how did u get that sweet enclave thing next to ur name?
---
I was dealing with two level 50 scorchbeasts and managed to pacify one of them. It just quit attacking me and flew off. I was hoping it would fight the other one for me, but no. Once when I was attacked by a three Yao guis and a group of super mutants at the same time, I pacified one of the Yao guis and it actually fought for me. That was pretty awesome. It gave me a little breathing room. 
---
I don't know what you're talking about. Seems like every patch that's released they're at least trying to fix legitimate issues. 
---
The cake is a lie!
---
Considering there a real world AR-15 that shoots soda cans, this is just a shotgun you load with canned food.
---
It's probly been in a borderlands game before somewhere too.
---
How the heck do you do that with the camp budget? Or does the camp budget grow with your level?
---
With pacifist mode enabled, you won't hurt others.  I throw a plasma grenade here and there until I remember that a couple rifle shots will do way more damage.
---
Hmm... Not exactly a good reason if so. But now the question being as to why they removed the armor ratings in the first place? And I highly doubt it's for balance reasons.
---
The thing is Bethesda's justice system banned him so they had the proof.  he was the one saying without proof that the justice system banned him for no reason. The burden of proof then falls on him as they are coming here claiming they were banned for nothing. The thing is things came to light earlier today and the email he got to why he was banned with the information got posted. He came here claiming that he crafted and gathered all the stuff and nothing was duped. Well between his two character's he had 333.071k of just ultracite ammo not including the other ammo he had. The total amount of ammo was 645.654k. that is over half a mil in just ammo alone in just 1 month. Someone did a rough estimate of what it would take to gather just the ultracite and it was crazy. It also came to light that he was actually banned before the duping ban wave from the other day that he claimed banned him by error.  Some people also were saying that he had admitted to duping but that he deleted that thread where he stated it but I have not seen that since it was deleted. 
---
Post activity isnt the greatest way to tell though, I go through phases of posting and commenting all the time, then not at all for days/weeks, then back to almost everything I look at again
---
Are private servers finally here like todd promised long time ago? Or are you guys just lucky and the exact amount that fills a server? 
---
Me and my friends played in all the beta slots that were there and one time right after release. Nobody touched the game since due to the crippling 400 limit back then. From what I understand the limit has doubled since and if it’s possible to roam an untouched and unlooted map, we might give this game another shot. Fighting through certain areas just to find them already looted was really annoying plus by now almost everyone but us will be super op and dropping nukes left and right. 
---
I kinda want to like and play this game since it’s still better than fallout tactics or Command &amp; Conquer sole survivor (if anybody remembers that cash grab that’s somehow missing in the C&amp;C collection that was sold a few years back) imho.
---
Hey I heard about that. So you got free copy of fallout 76 from x-kom?
---
Gatling Plasma durability says hello....
---
Yep. I was suprised myself. He must've been duping wayyyyy worse then the '900 hour guy' was.
---
“Change user flair”
---
Graphic!
---
Okay thank you for the info
---
&gt;Performance: Attempting to craft many items at very high speed will now result in a delay of up to 1 second between subsequent crafting attempts after the first few. This was done to help improve server performance and should not affect normal crafting.
---
I'm still surprised there isn't a slide for crafting, at least for ammo. It seems that it would cause less strain on the servers in general. I believe this delay is still needed, since from what I understand it should help prevent one of the Dupe crashes, but I always feel bad when I've gotta craft a bunch of ammo to replace my depleted 5mm stock since it impacts the whole server each crafting action. 
---
&gt; Yeah I wasn't a fan of going through post histories
---
I'm a huge fan of going through post histories, when appropriate (though it's hard to know what's appropriate until you know).  I don't do it very often, but there have been times when a compelling sob story turned into 'screw you you lying piece of shit'.
---
This is the internet.  Never take anything at face value.  Outing a scammer might save other people from harm (or at least disinformation), don't ever feel bad about being cautious.
---
"I cheated before, but now that I am banned, I haven't cheated!!!!" 
---
That'll teach you to get so invested with a game that is garbage from a company that doesnt give a shit anymore. Hope you get your stuff back though 
---
YW
---
&gt;**Wanted:** Damaging a C.A.M.P. or workshop object created by another player no longer causes the attacker to become Wanted. The object must now be completely destroyed by the attacker in order to flag them as Wanted.
---
Just bare with me for a second - hypothetical scenario. With this design, it is theoretically possible for a player to damage another players structures to almost destroyed as a way of griefing. Then a mole rat would just finish the job - no bounty. I doubt this would be exploited severely, but it is something that players could do to other players. 
---
I have approximately 40,000 5.56 ammo. It's easy if you find people willing to trade ammo.
---
I had to walk literally about 5 feet away from enemies in order to hit them with my two shot shotgun but it was still worth it as I did much more damage.  If I was anything less than 5 feet away then I would miss most of my hits and it wouldn't be worth it.  Now it isn't worth it at all since I can use a completely unmodified combat shotgun and do more damage from further away since I can actually hit my shots.  A completely modified TS is less accurate than a completely unmodified non-legendary by a HUGE margin.
---
I literally just missed it... 
---
Didn't mean to russle your jimmies...
---
Does this mean the Grounded Mutation's negative effects are correctly reduced with Class Freak ?
---
cheater will never admit that they are one if there is a ny loop for an excuse they will used it
---
Looks like an upcoming atom shop item.  Save your atoms, brother! 
---
Hey Bethesda, go smack a cactus.
---
Good callouts thank you, will bring these up for discussion to see where they are at as well.
---
Honestly, no info presented about fo76 has added up in the long run.
---
Bethesdas complete lack of any transparency in anything they have done has been an absolute shitshow. From their advertising, to their bug fixing to their patch notes, to their lack of responding to tickets that are lodged, to their community people who's only response is, great feedback/idea we are sending it to the dev team shredder for them to ignore.
---
The only reason I keep this subreddit subscribed is for when private servers or mods are released. They said it would come Nov 2019, 1 year after launch, and I have a $50 bet that we are going to be screwed over on that front as well.
---
Though, I really really do have my fingers crossed that I am wrong. 
---
I would like to know what the limits are. I try to have at least 4,000 rounds of .50 ammo. 
---
I can't imagine having anough scrap to make much more at a time though, much less carry it. 
---
The games been out for like 3 months and youve played 40 days?! Jesus dude... The game is fun and all but wtf? 
---
After you leave the server they will still be there and anyone can pick them up. But if you want a certain friend of yours to get them, you need to let him join you BEFORE you hop. 
---
This is the nail in the coffin for me. My dad is an older guy who grew up during the cold war. Playing Fallout seems like living in what he as a child must have imagined the world could easily become. I'm not buying a game for him just to explain that he didn't do anything wrong but he's still not allowed to play with everyone else. That's so fucking shitty.
---
I did the same thing yesterday and pretty much came to the same conclusion and sentiment you did.
---
I wanted to vet these claims of innocence by seeing if they made a trade post that was blatantly dupe related (for example, posting the same legendary multiple times over a long period). I didnt see anything obvious.
---
It does make me wonder if they traded a legit legendary for a duped legendary (one of the 400 that were on the no-fly list). Id say that there would be way more bans if their criteria was merely having one of those items.
---
You mentioned that there were some that had no history at all- I saw a few users that were over a year old karma but had very few posts (mostly comments). Most of those had lower karma ~500 which appears to be in line with someone not all that active. The number of posts/comments itself doesnt mean anything, but I wonder if any dupers crying wolf saw [My post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as3a0s/almost_all_of_the_482000_banned_posts_i_checked/?utm_source=reddit-android) and decided to cover their tracks? Possible explanation why you found no history on a few.
---
In the end, dupers are going to spread false information, and Bethesda hasnt ~~earned~~ regained my vote of confidence in their coding ability.
---
Moral of the story: Trust no one!
---
P.s. Im newish to reddit (started when FO76 was released because of it), I wasnt aware that looking at user history was frowned upon.
---
So, when you log back in, do you have to restart from an earlier point in the quest or does it start you at the point where you insert the ingredients? If it starts you at an earlier point, maybe try inserting the other materials before the bone meal? At this point, I would submit a support ticket to Bethesda. Maybe message the Bethesda reps here and see if it's a known issue they are working on (like the Swarm of Suitors event and the upcoming fix for Mama Dolce's)
---
DELICIOUS
---
I have not logged on in a few weeks, but after seeing this I may need to jump on this weekend. 
---
I think the good outweighs the bad on this one :)
---
Not trying to be a dick.  Just see a lot of reposts like this.
---
&gt;Power Armor: Now correctly prioritizes using the Fusion Core in the player’s inventory that has the least remaining charge, rather than selecting them at random.
---
I've been waiting for this since FO4
---
Free or paid respec? Come on Beth, we've been asking for this one for months
---
How is this possible, did you hop back onto the server where you left the stuff? 
---
Do you think that will costs more than 1800?
---
I think \*most\* people are safe. I still routinely see explosive weapons in events and players with ludicrously high bounties.
---
" I have also done no trading or mass dealings in the past month " I mean, your post history says you were selling a shitload of stuff in the past 30 days so i'm gonna take that everything else you also say is a lie because if not then why lie about the trading ?
---
[Your post history](https://imgur.com/a/2IwS8Cp)

In patch 6 we fixed an issue affecting her plan drops so she should now be able to drop the full breadth of Ultracite Power Armor Mod plans in her loot list. We're still working on more comprehensive updates for Scorchbeast Queen loot for a future update.
---
It is not fun at all to have to walk up to every enemy to shoot them with a gun like you're playing melee.  I can't stress this enough.  It just isn't fun to do that.  On melee it is different but walking up to an enemy to shoot them just fucking sucks.  While before I could at least kill enemies by doing that, now I just do regular damage but still have to stand right in an enemies face.  It isn't fun and now it's not even worth it.
---
Alright bethesda Fuck you. Seriously, the change to workshops is just going to INCREASE the amount of griefers. Yes its cool to enable a more streamlined workshop take over system preventing people from blocking off the workbench. However now the workshop PvP exploit {Getting a team member to start claiming a workshop, will you attak the player whereever they are on the map beacuse it flags them for PvP no matter how far away they are from the workshop} will be eaiser then ever to use!
---
No clue, but I'd wager it'll be at least that much.  Probably time limited too. 
---
So nothing fixed, got it.  
---
What I do t get how is a glitch made by Bethesda considered violating there terms it’s a glitch made by you guys just because people found how to abuse it your punishing them. Doesn’t make sense you guys screwed up by creating it it’s not the community fault for using it to there advantage!! 
---
Does the nuka girl outfit protect you from airborne diseases?
---
Yes this. I want to change from 3x L3 Rifleman to 3x L2 Rifleman + 3x Bloody Mess. Doing so is going to cost me:
---
6 levels to re-pick all three Rifleman perks at L2.  
---
3 levels to pick L3 Bloody Mess.  
---
3 levels to move points from Perception to Luck.
---
:ok:
---
Its because your game code didn't register. They stated this would come up if you Haven'tnt played since beta.
---
Yes - my thoughts as well, but they'd have to do that surgically, so hopefully it doesn't become too much of an issue.  Most people that want to grief just go nuts.
---
I think my point was that this sub demands corroboration in an instance where it's not possible. This criteria sort of only give bethesda the high ground and they really haven't done much to outline what their bannable criteria is or how we can be confident that their system is truly working to ban obvious cases of people exploiting/duping.
---
The burden of proof is really on bethesda in this case because they're the only one with access since the banned player has none. Bethesda has provided some context to the 900 hours case, but tbh it doesn't say much. I have friends that rock 50 cals that go through 100k ultracite ammo in a month. 
---
I'm choosing to take a wait and see approach. Bethesda hasn't necessarily instilled confidence with everything about this release.
---
No friends, I want everyone to be able to have the legendarys
---
What I understood is that he suspected it was counting the amount of ammo he picked up in total, not the actual amount he had. It seemed a plausible scenario to me. 
---
For example. I find 10 bullets. I give them to you, you later give them back to me. The system counts 10 bullets when I first found them, and then another 10 when you give them back to me, crediting me with 20 bullets found, when in reality I only found 10.
---
Not saying that *is* how it works, but given how buggy shit has been in this game so far, it wouldn't surprise me at all if that's how it counted items picked up. Not taking into account people passing the same items back and forth between accounts would be an easy mistake to make. 
---
Since they took both accounts together into account, making 1,000 Ultracite Ammo would increment his count by 1,000. He then passes that to his mule, so both accounts have 1,000. He then passes that from his mule back to an alt and he is shown having 2,000 on one account and 1,000 on another.
---
Do I believe him entirely? No. Is it worth giving him the benefit of the doubt until his story is confirmed bullshit? I think so.
---
It's the same for my Gauss Rifle. I was so happy when I finally got it, but it's way less effective than my regular one. Keeping it just in case they make things better.
---
I know some of you grew fond of the little guys, but they were beginning to develop a mind of their own and we had to crush the Rad Worm uprising before they took over the Wasteland as we know it.
---
&gt;**Workbenches:** Attempting to place a Power Armor Station on a foundation in a structure that has multiple levels no longer causes the station to be placed on the second floor.
---
What about decontamination showers, and the few other items that do that same thing?
---
I consider getting disconnected, crashing, freezing, black screen PA hud when fast travelling, and infinite load screens as game breaking. A simple solution would be rejoin previous server but they haven't implemented it or even to my knowledge even acknowledged the issue. SO when people say "nothing game breaking" don't believe it. There are plenty of things that will completely break your game and ruin all of your progress.
---
Yep today’s patch gives us the long awaited stash increase and also a fix for feed the people event eating P.A bits and weapons. The hoppers will only take the quest items now apparently and also accidental damage to c.a.m.p’s won’t land you with a wanted status 👍
---
Any word on how I get all my crafting tables and turrets back that disappeared when I moved my camp? I’d rather not rebuild everything AGAIN.
---
Not sure how it could be "shite" ... considering it's the exact same as the non-prime version, except it does more damage. And I believe EVEN MORE damage beyond that, to scorched specifically. The only complaint I've had about prime weapons/ultracite ammo - other than the materials constantly required - is that the prime receiver is nowhere near as fast as my old speedy receiver on my gatlings. Fortunately martial artist - at least up 'til now - mitigates most of the slowness of a prime receiver.
---
for some thumbs up I guess. There were some posts before and after this one as well. The last guy to re-post the patch notes, is getting hit by the thumbs down moster
---
I want human NPCs
---
Positive reinforcement never hurts lol
---
Or when I'm cooking up glowing meat - sometimes I get a stack of 20-30 to cook, most times its closer to 10 but still cooking in fast succession does a number on the servers.  Just give us a slider if we can craft more than 1 of any item.  Or crafting armor early on to scrap to learn mods...  all that lvl 1 leather armor crafted 1 at a time.
---
I used raider armor for the first few weeks until I got into HQ and got the excavator armor plans and built it. I have x01 and only use it for fighting,
---
Excavator armor for everything else. 
---
u/Ladydevann Do you know if they managed to get this fix in with today's patch?
---
Sucks to be the guy who doesn't use Reddit and doesn't know not to pick up suspicious stuff.
---
Well this is just sad. Also dress it up however you like, it's still a witch hunt.
---
I think this is more for the workshops where people put stash boxes or other objects all around the the workshop built box making so you had to waste time to attack their crap before you tried to take the workshop.
---
Why downvoted? Ahahahha
---
Anything else about legendary loot drop RNG? It feels really unrewarding at the moment to kill legendary enemies. 
---
This sounds exactly like the entitlement of someone duping on a level 400 account and "oh gee i gawt banned"
---
I have less than 100 hours in and *definitely* had around 4-5k rounds of ammo on me for my main gun in the first 20 or so hours of play. I also had about 5k rounds of .45 on me that I crafted for my SO's main gun. Because I enjoyed picking up the necessary junk and spending the time crafting ammo for the two of us. I haven't logged in in a while due to playing other games, but when I logged off last I still had more than 2k rounds on me after a disastrous encounter with those stupid Civil War reenactor bots that weren't taking *any* damage from any of my regular weapons and could only be taken out with my very limited stash of pulse mines and grenades.
---
Mind, there was no duping involved. Just picking up ammo wherever I found it and crafting more from junk. I was regularly exceeding the amounts I was using in crafting and looting. If I'd been playing for 900 hours, I could *easily* have hundreds of thousands of rounds.
---
I agree - I doubt many players will find a random C.A.M.P. and decide to waste ammo or time individually attacking all his or her structures down to almost zero HP and just leaving. BUT they could do it if they wanted to =P. 
---
Yeah, I believe that's what happened.  I have a habit of checking the ice box before I head inside. After I noticed the same items, I went inside and the bodies were where I had left them.  It was on a consecutive server hop.
---
Energy weapon durability?
---
No love for laser weapons? Alright then...
---
Now the just need to put digestes goo on the Non auto scrap 
---
THE GOOSE YET LIVES!
---
Brilliant, yesterday i hit the stash box limit. (Should lose some glass and bones)
---
That purge was supposedly only done on accounts found to have duped weapons and armor. It seems likely that there was something else that brought attention to his massive amounts of ammo.
---
The only people getting banned are cheaters so if you are a cheater don't buy the game.
---
Before patch 6 your company also did a passive aggressive dupe investigation, when you could have banned everyone from the start instead of wasting time.  Stop the half-ass effort.
---
Meanwhile, still have it set up so that if I own a workshop and someone else claims it, even if I don't mind losing it and am on the other side of the map, that player can fast travel to me and kill me after claiming my workshop and flagging me just to grief me. Thought that would be fixed, so I guess the game remains uninstalled. 
---
That’s correct and it’s also the case in a real world scenario. Shotguns are mostly used for clearing houses. Anything farther than that you need rifles, SMG or heavy guns.
---
Before the nerf I could kill a level 50 mirelurk queen with two to three shots with my explosive shotgun, now it takes at least 10 and by then at that distance she was already killing me with her acid piss. So Gatling is my number one weapon now. 
---
* **Exploits:** **Removed an apparel Recipe that was not intended to be available in-game, as well as items created using that Recipe.**  
---
I wander if this is the Tactical Marine Helmet and Hunter's Hood???
---
Scope, crosshairs disappearing - all bugs that should be fixed.  Countless times my crosshairs just disappear after firing for a while, so annoying.  Aiming should work in 3rd party and 1st party views.
---
Well, we obviously can't have that.   Honestly though I thought it was kind of a clever idea.   They increase radiation effects, so having them mess with your mutations seemed like a good fit.  Plus it made me feel like Fry in that episode of Futurama where he eats the gas station sandwich and gets super worms ;)
---
I mean it all depends on how much time you want to spend driving. West Virginia countryside is beautiful to drive through but I would recommend other locations that are closer to white sulfur springs such as Falling Springs (it’s in Virginia but is half an hour away) and the numerous cave systems found surrounding white sulfur springs, including Organ Cave and Lost World Caverns (which is in-game as Uncanny Caverns).
---
Sadly, West Virginia isn’t a state you can experience all of in one outing. I would recommend a trip to White Sulfur Springs and doing the activities I mentioned and other surrounding attractions. Charleston and Helvetia are fine places to visit but I’d recommend doing those independently unless you plan on staying in the area for more than 2 days.
---
I would also recommend a stay at New River Gorge. There’s a camp there with cabins and you can do so many things such as white water rafting (because in reality there’s a rapids/rivers that goes underneath it and Flatwoods is like 50 miles away).
---
Alternatively, a great area to stay in the winter and even in the summer is Snowshoe (in game as Top of the World) it has a beautiful resort and charming downtown area as well as a great stay for skiing in the winter time and is close to the best natural areas in West Virginia, including Spruce Knob and Seneca Rocks (which obviously are both better in appearance irl than in game) and is also really close to Helvetia!
---
There are so many things to do in West Virginia that you cannot simply do by itself. From Harpers Ferry, to Morgantown, to Charleston, to Fairmont, to Snowshoe, there’s a limitless amount of things to do!
---
Shooting in the windows at Whitesprings cant be it..I do it multiple times a day and im still able to play. I dont see how that would be any different than letting them all run out the front door and group up or running inside and pulling them all to one room.
---
But that’s the *easiest way to say things*
---
Don't buy it! We already have enough people like you here.
---
unfortunately its just not funny at all
---
Not to mention that most "managers" in call centers are just other representatives taking the call from the prior representative. All most people are doing is spending extra time.
---
incorrect. i have more than one full set . i have never traded, jsut played a lot. its not as rare as you think, most 3 star armor will have a chance to be sentinel/cavalier/weight reducing/fall reduction/lockpick boost. You might mean those with full untiielding/sentinel and full assasin/sentinel. Those are kinda more suspect imo, but still possible to loot. Now TSE on the other hand i still have never looted one.
---
I just play the game with the idea that I *might* find some really great weapon off a three star enemy.  I don't really care about having all top end gear immediately, because then what else do you have left to look forward to?
---
My stash has maybe a dozen extra legendaries I'm saving for friends, a possible new character or p2p trading.  I'm lucky if I can hang on to more than 2000 5.56mm rounds at any given time.  Aside from steel and lead, most of my scrap is in quantities of 100-200.  I typically have 15-20 dog foods and maybe 30-40 purified water.  That's all I'll need for the day.  I stopped carrying more than 30 stimpaks, 15 diluted rad-x and 20 radaway.  They're just too heavy.
---
At one point I was doing stash management at the weight limit, looked at my 500 ceramic and asked myself "Mark, do you need 500 broken coffee cups?"  I just pared everything I don't use all the time down to 100 units or less and brought my stash down to about 400lbs.  If for some reason I run low on ceramic, gold or leather, I just tag them for search until I'm back up to 100.  I only carry 10 bone shards and 10 fertilizer now.  I never really use them, and they're easy to reacquire.  The 600 weight limit is easy to deal with if you stop hoarding.
---
This post....
---
Reminds me of shit.
---
Agreed.  Most of the fun of contesting a workshop is overcoming the defenses that another player has built up.
---
Gotta make it boring to satisfy the masses.. I suppose.
---
I have managed to acquire 1 recipe in total. It was a laser pistol IIRC. And did shit all damage compared to my sniper rifle with no range, and considering i play a stealth sniper, pistols... are not my thing.
---
so, yeah. for my play style, it was as useless as tits on a bull.
---
Ah well, just take it as a blessing at this point. FO76 is a train wreck that hit another train wreck on a yacht that hit an iceberg, all of which is also on a space ship on a collision course with the sun. Now you can go play a real game.
---
Because part of the Terms of Service and Code of Conduct you agree to by buying and playing the game state that if you find an exploit to stop doing it and report it, not go all willy-nilly making whatever you want.  Reporting it helps them fix the issue.  
---
Neither one of those things are indicative of people cheating.

When I worked CS I loved being asked for an escalation.
---
Sure, let me put you on hold for ten minutes while I go find the guy, five more while I explain the issue and bring him up to date, a few more while he deals with the actual managerial issues in front of him, then ultimately transfer you.
---
It’s like being given a break and then a reward.
---
I also joined reddit because of FO76. I didn't realize post history was taboo it untill I got some hate over it in previous post. I was just covering my ass. I had a post deleted by the mods here over complaints of this and witch hunting. The mods responded to me and let me know the post was getting out of hand and that's why they deleted it. Which is within thier rights to maintain peace here. But IMO post opinion is public record and shouldn't be taboo. I'll gladly own any of the dumb shit I've posted in the past.
---
I love your name 
---
Yep. I have, or try to maintain, about 10k each of .50, 5mm, and ultracite 5mm. And rely heavily on the ballistic ammo weight perk.
---
This is duped?
---
Have yet to play Journey but heard nothing but good things. That one scene is such a pivotal point in the story, it was done at just the right time and changes your perspective on the world and it’s characters
---
Hope they fix the weapons breaking so fast I'm spending more time looking for junk to fix them.
---
Also the demo perk if it stays at 20% they need to drop the amount of points needed for it as I could use it for something else,so fingers crossed it's a good stable patch.
---
What's REALLY funny is the 'duper hunters' being banned  for having picked up the duped loot :D
---
Does "scrap all junk" still break down your bulk automatically?
---
is the shit wearing a "M76GA" hat?
---
it is when the chances of rolling a god 3\* are less than 0.000001%.
---
Thats the thing tho i never un equip my perks
---
Reaching.

 *Fixed an issue in which the "Play with Team" option on the Main Menu became non-functional when attempting to rejoin teammates in a world following a crash or disconnect.* 
---
Having experienced this recently, I'm glad its being fixed.  Happened to me during an SBQ fight, crashed to desktop, then I couldn't rejoin, had to log out of the client entirely and join back using Social.  Cause clicking on Play with Team did nothing at all.
---
Or under it possibly...
---
Ya know, my first instinct was to talk shit about the 900 banned guy who just made a big guide (knowing he was already banned to try to fall back on that guide as if to say why would I create this if I cheated). But your quality work changed my mind.
---
These are very well done! Clear pronunciation and instead of saying, start here, you actually pull up the maps and show where to go exactly.  I'm definitely going to be trying for the Long Coat. 
---
I hope you continue to make videos and post them.
---
I know I'm late, but with this ban and the one from the guy who's lvl 117, there are only gonna be like...31 players left. Bethesda might want to figure out the actual issues instead of banning the few loyal people they have. Especially with that amount of time on what most of us consider a dead game
---
Sure thing Sargent
---
Everything gets downvoted here ;)
---
ya i see a post at least once a week from a player complaining that PVP has no place in the game because of lore reasons, including several the day i made this post
---
For that I simply drop them in paper bags in front of the vendor bots. I don’t know if people actually go to ice machines. Many times I saw the WS coke machine had several nuke colas in them but nobody picked them up. everyone was too busy with the ghouls and nobody pay attention to anything else. 
---
Now all what we need is ability to not spawn in nuke zone
---
Are bulked items still scrapped into unbulked when using the 'scrap all' button?
---
This is on our radar and we're looking to making improvements in the future. 
---
Sorry to be contrary, but I think you're getting a lot of bad advice.   
---
If you're willing to deal with other players, you'll pay \~90% less for the exact same thing. Why pay more to give money to NPCs? You can see what you're buying in the trade screen. A serum-for-caps trade is quite safe as long as you take your time to read what you're getting. Trading serums-for-ingredients is a bit riskier since they could PVP you for the junk, but that's not a risk for caps, and there's plenty of reputable player merchants. 
---
Why wait? Playing with mutations is fun. If you have starched genes level 2 (and maybe some ranks in Class Freak), go for it. You're not going to play the game forever. Why not have fun abilities for more of the time that you're playing? I wouldn't buy serums to store them, but if you're going to use them, buy now. 
---
As for dupers, the mutation recipes and serums really aren't a big part of duping. There's lots of players who legitimately have the recipes, and the ingredient costs are really cheap for end-game players. When they sell at 200-500 caps, they're happy and you're happy. 
---
As for my own experience, I paid 500/serum (on pc) for eight serums. I had two transactions with different player vendors. Both purchases when smoothly and I don't regret it a bit. There wasn't any sign of duping; to the contrary, one fellow was a serum short and there was every appearance that the crafted it between purchases, so I saw pre-and-post inventory. Everything looked proper. 
---
🙄
---
Does anyone know if this is the case? Marine Tactical Helmet were my go to money maker :(
---
Thank you u/Vault101manguy, very cool.
---
Very well done videos! Keep up the good work.
---
Is there still issues with legendary enemies not dropping the correct loot?
---
No. I heard about it too and made a poor play on words as a joke.
---
Yeah. Like weapon crafting perks. I *need* a 5 in guns, but I don’t want to walk around with it. I just don’t want my gun to break so a 2
---
Is ok. 
---
I feel like there is nothing wrong. You're paying for a second account and using a second account's worth of resources at any one time. You're not on a single account, using potentially thousands of account's worth of resources at any one time. I use mine for legendaries, especially armor I might like to use for specific purposes later, less-used stable fluxes, stable flux components, and any worthy overflow junk I have after grinding that I need to get off my person before doing nuke silo runs and blast zone/SBQ runs.
---
I can provide some sound effects for swamp gas if Bethesda is interested.
---
I thought it might be satire, but took the opportunity to express my frustration about liars/cheaters.
---
We might be further along had they reported the bugs instead of exploiting them...
---
I'll edit the implication that you were serious. :)
---
Yeah.  And it looks like it's fixed in the new patch.  Welcome news.
---
* **Power Armor:** **Resistances are no longer incorrectly reduced when entering Power Armor while wearing Underarmor.**
---
What you do. What you always do. Turn death into a fighting chance to live.
---
Interesting. Sounds like they added up transactions but had no way to avoid double counting. 
---
I didn't see anything in the notes that would address the issue of "Not being able to Synch Friends list at this time" issue.
---
A lot of great fixes in here. I think my favourite will be the Quick Swap key fix. That was driving me nuts and was happening at very inconvenient times. For example - when a deathclaw was stomping on my face.
---
I would think bethesda would be happy someone wanted to play their game. 
---
"I didn't know my alternate account was giving me duped items!! I am INNOCENT!" 
---
Now that's some next level White Knighting right there
---
Well, yes. This is called defense. It's removed from the game now.
---
Interesting, that happened to me only once, after hundreds of hours of play. All other times I was sent to a different server. That one time when I checked the vendor bot at watoga station I saw the same items I just sold to it and realized it’s the same server. 
---
Scorchbreast in lower level areas should have their level reduce to make them easier to be taken down by lower level players.
---
Don’t even know what you’re implying.  
---
Oh.
---
I thought they were going to start fixing Energy Weapons in this patch.
---
Oh well.
---
There's this game called  Nk Man's Sky that has your name written aaaaalllll over it!
---
We wont know until the game is back up
---
You can't prove a negative.
---
The decision process is being made to seem murky and flawed. BTW It's not if they didn't cheat they wouldn't get banned. Post history verifies this for most of the banned players. However half assed game journalist and I use journalist loosly (I'm looking at you polygon you hacks) just copy and paste reddit as a source. So if reddit currently looks like a storm of false bans it'll eventually be reported as a fact. Beth needs to do some damage control on this even if they did nothing wrong.
---
PC? i chuck 100+ aluminum and adhesive almost every session (dont like to carry more than 100 Al, and 150 Adhesive. Bulking chews through my shotgun fodder.)  
---
Server DC's have gotten far better (used to be 1-2 per hour on avg for me. now its maybe 1 per play session, usually around 4-5 hours)  
---
Laggy spawns are still an issue (where everything takes a while to load in. Getting hit by invisible stuff gets old in a hurry)  
---
Spinning loot wheel is still an issue, but far less so than  pre-patch 5. (the queen being the notable exception. She always loot buffers for me.)  
---
Rad worms still messes with effects (boosts by 50% when active and screws with everything when you recover)
---
is the white knight actually two Nigerian brothers? 
---
ok seeing needed stuff getting fixed this patch nice...wondering what parts of the last patch a new patch will undo this time... bets anyone?
---
We're looking into improvements we can bring to energy as well as heavy weapons, including durability, ammo weights, general balance, and bug fixes. I don't have a date to share on those changes yet, but will let you know as soon as they're ready!
---
Fuck I thought this was a actual dlc for a second
---
Nice! Keep at it, digging the tone 
---
check your blue prints section
---
Many people were exploiting the game by simply having an unknowing person on their friend's list serve as an anchor. I have not seen/read any evidence indicating people with second accounts are any more likely than anyone else to cheat. I would hazard a guess that the game's stash management issues have led a fair percentage of us to use a second account, especially after the price drop.
---
It's hard to do the daily material grind/full vendor circuit, AND then do anything of significance, like silo runs and SBQ fights, with the existing stash limit. Today's 200 bump should help a TON, but still, I feel like it's not going to be enough. I should be able to store multiple sets of weapons and armor that work together in different specific situations without running into stash limits and facing being overburdened.
---
Pls explain.
---
That is the proof they must provide. Take what happened to me on rising storm. I was banned from a few servers for supposed mic spam,team killing, role vote, and kick vote spamming. 
---
Now what went on was a group of 3 or 4 people in my game were trolling they actually followed me to three different servers  before I was banned. 1 of those guys made an account with my name and was doing those things in the same game i was in. 
---
There was two ways to prove It was not me and the first way by giving them the steam id of the person who was in my game with the same name as I had. 
---
I did not have his steam id as I was not sure how to find that in game and could not find it when checking for players met. What I did have was video evidence which proved I was wrongly banned because not only did I not have a mic it showed the troll in the spectate and showed me in game. 
---
It's not ideal way to prove something but it works. 
---
Admittedly I'm in the 'White Knight' category but I can tell you straight up: I did in fact dump dupers items at the bottom of a river. I even had Xbox capture as well but it for deleted for some weird reason no idea why.
---
Nonetheless I agree 100% with you. But i must say there were people who were true 'White Knights' and not the sneaky ones who took the loot for themselves.
---
Either way I'm happy those undesirables are leaving in droves, more stability for us!
---
I have 380 storage space left in my Stash now. Now I can finally start gathering resources!
---
I've seen enough vids of people just placing stuff and the game glitching out and duplicating to know that's bullshit. 
---
Patch notes look solid, question for the Devs though...
---
What about the Targeting HUD issue? This has been an issue for quite some time and also effects Grape Mentats. The highlight vision bleeds onto nearby players (sometimes teammates who are far away) and causes stability drops and crashes. I have been forced to not use this mod because of the issue making me crash within 15 minutes or so of entering a suit with the mod on. 
---
Rule 3.
---
Is this referring to the Tactical Marine Helmet and Hunter's Hood?
---
R.I.P Gatling gun 
---
Sounds great!
---
Another day in the salt mine! I love how people were gloating for months about how Bethesda was too stupid to know who was duping and who wasn't, and that's why they couldn't fix anything. And Bethesda allowed that false sense of security to shake out all the most egregious cheaters. Seeing their crocodile tears about not being able to play their "favorite" game now, after spending 3 months ruining the game for literally everyone else, is some delicious schadenfreude.
---
The owner should also only be targetable in the build area now. If they did it right.
---
I don't anyone asked for it but workshops are essentially pvp arenas, always have been. most people don't, or at least shouldn't claim them for the resources alone. or at all, really.
---
although their continued push to please a minimal portion of the playerbase puzzles me.
---
Excal is more effective from the start (i started as volt every account, friends always start as excal) and i dont care, volt is fun. Warframe is more about having fun with a playstyle and layout thay fits your personality (end game anyway)
---
I haven't even bought the game lol. Did you even read what I wrote are are you just duplicating your own bullshit?
---
It doesn't work on ultracite nodes.
---
Ownage!!!
---
Here are my [Shielded Vault 76 jumpsuit](http://www.mediafire.com/convkey/52f0/u58nti16e8bbuslzg.jpg) stats...
---
workshops still aren't worth using. 90% of the workshops you see owned have zero "health" so most people are only taking them for free fast travel and to do defense events for plans.
---
Yeah I can only think of Camp Adams, the Relay stations and Camp McClintock, and maybe a few places in the Ash heap as sub lvl 35 areas.  The rest of them are either on the other side of Savage divide or inside Whitesprings.  
---
/u/valseek
---
This was an issue that was introduced last patch/last hotfix, when they fixed the consumption of weapon/armor mods during the crafting process.
---
Thanks! So far it's been pretty quiet - was attacked by some cave crickets last week, but other than that there is very little traffic - and the Mire really is beautiful. 
---
Believe it or not auto weapons, and heavy guns burn through ammo fast. 3k or less goes by so fast. I always try to keep 4k ish of .50 and 5mm, and 5.56.I'm just speaking from experience of playing as a heavy gun char. Eh.
---
I do, but you know. Not if I'll get banned for pressing a button and it glitches and doubles stuff.
---
Lol nice. 
---
Damn. For a while i was buying all mats needed for ammo and in just a few days I made like 140k .50 cal rounds. My goal was to hit 100k of each round lol.
---
I'm really curious how often this scenario would play out. I never have anyone even try to contest my workshop, let alone do it as an organized unit. 
---
Can't hurt to try.  
---
Who said something about a sentinel set lol?
---
But they have been working hard on the game. Their one developer has been working double duty.
---
&gt;is this a bug
---
take a guess
---
She does! I've never heard of those (not a big modder). I wonder if she has. Thanks! 
---
i hope so, that would be a nice change
---
Dear Bethesda, what situation with energy gun's damage &amp; durability (like gatling plasmas, plasma pistols&amp;rifles, flametwhrowers, laser gatlings &amp; rifles etc)? Why they still junk? I have some cool energy guns, but I can not use them properly. You have said many times that this will be fixed, but so far nothing has been done.
---
Thank you for the tag! Also, thank you u/Waffle_cop for addressing this. I will send this to the appropriate parties over here. If you ever find more things like this in the future, please feel free to message me. 
---
What a well written, insightful post.
---
No wonder it was instantly downvoted by the people of this sub.
---
More like Silver Shoud. 
---
Yeah I'm not disputing the numbers, but I was just trying to clarify that I personally don't find the actual Ultracite Junk/Scrap rare itself. I also personally don't even bother farming Raw Flux, as I've found it to be much more efficient and even more *fun* to just farm the SBQ and trade for anymore I need. Screw going through all the effort farming Raw Flux when I could be possible be getting some decent gear in the mean time lol
---
Hahaha 😂 i guess you are right lol 
---
&gt;Do some Jet
---
&gt;Jet not in the game
---
What other forbidden things does this rock grant you?
---
Are you farming nuke-zones when other people drop nukes? I'm guessing not since even the excavator armor has better rad protection than the T-51b. 
---
If you aren't prepared for the consequences of dropping a nuke, then I don't think there's reason to drop it. Don't do it just because the quest marker tells you to. 
---
Please realize that people get falsely accused and punished regularly.
---
This boot licking has got to stop.
---
because the duping methods literally crashed servers, and the items being duped completely destroyed player economy? although more content is welcome, but did didablo 2 have more content added 3 months post release?
---
It technically isn't, but trading in these kind of games should get you bans anyhow. 
---
Stop trading; play the game.
---
For moneys, go do actual work.
---
It's hard to realize you do actually have to work in this time, where streamers get idolized.
---
are you serious?
---
XD
---
Right! A lot of these people bashed the fuck out of FO76 and now they're all like but but buttt I loved this game now I can't play wahhh
---
I agree, it's just that your reply implied just having a mule was what triggered the ban.
---
ive had it happen 4 times this week on my low level (under 25) build, they never come after my lvl 140 for some reason lol
---
Queue monster mash cheer music.
---
The theory is that something like this is coming.  
---
1. There is a presidential suite in the Enclave bunker and you can buy Presidential items (like armor) with presidential seals.  
---
2. When climbing up the fire escape at the Watoga Civic Center, the announcer states "The Presidential debate happen here".  
---
3. There are voting machines absolutely EVERYWHERE.  
---
The theory is that there will be a PVP mode in the Watoga Civic center with people voting somehow from all over the map to "elect" the president.  Being Fallout, I'm sure ballot-stuffing will come into it somehow.
---
Last time I buy a Bethesda game I pre ordered and spent $60 have over 100 hours and I get banned for what? Nothing? 
---
Why is health important?
---
Still nothing on the screen boundary issue?
---
Memes:

---
sentinel is a god roll, it illustrates my point. an abnormally high number of players is running around in full sentinel.
---
a number that defies probability.
---
wow its almost like ive seen this exact same comment a thousand times and i hate you
---
Excuse me but what is a dev room?
---
I really miss the withdrawal affects 
---
How does Bethesda differentiate from someone who duped 100k items and someone who saw a bag of them and picked it up once?
---
Because Bethesda directly stated they cant.
---
This is like proving they are witches by drowning them imho.
---
Wasn’t there a joke going on a while ago that Bethesda would accidentally add the ability to eat power armour?
---
I did have an enemy beneath the ground once or twice. It'll be able to shoot at you, but otherway around is tricky. 
---
If it is right at your C.A.M.P., relogging might be an option, as I  am not sure whether they can damage your walls and such.
---
It's not our job to convince you to buy this game!!
---
And if you're buying with the intentions of cheating then stay away, we don't need you here or in the game.
---
Cash registers! I always put my duplicate plans in there.  That being said, with the price increase in plans i’m keeping my weapon plans nowadays.
---
holy shit, how did you know i ate that last piece of cake last night. 
---
The opposite I was dps he was clearing the smaller scorched enemies lol he could’ve pulled it off of a different legendary enemy that spawned I just heard him freaking out when he got it to drop
---
&gt;Exploits: Removed an apparel Recipe that was not intended to be available in-game, as well as items created using that Recipe.
---
Which item was this?  It wasn't my beloved Witch Dress, was it?
---
But where was that stated...???
---
Did you have a secondary mule character? Seems like people getting banned had mule characters.
---
I would say he gave a plausible alibi, and the only people who can confirm or refute it is Bethesda. If they reinstate his account, then they likely confirmed that their method of counting materials lines up with his claim. If they uphold the ban, then they have further evidence that's not explained by his story. Either way it's back on Bethesda at this point, and should be easy enough to verify one way or another.
---
Any idea when the servers are back up again? I just got the game lol.
---
okay, Jussie 
---
This is the only thing that sounds really... bad to me.. And you're the only one who has so far mentioned it!
---
Not just the gatling plasma but ALL energy weapons.  Energy weapons play such an important role in the fallout universe and theme of "wonky 50's science".  Keep on working on the buffs and durability!  Keep up the good work BGS.
---
So...Are you an idiot, or...?
---
What about the people that were suspended, any news when we'll be able to get our account back? 
---
Sentinel is NOT a god roll. Sentinel by itself, or with some shitty effects, is pretty common. Same with explosive weapons. I've looted plenty of shitty explosive weapons.   
---
Have you played Fallout 76? 
---
"ITS STILL THE DuPeRs!!!!!"
---
When will this sub ever grow up and realize the servers are shit.
---
I was speaking about the armor itself,not the mods you can buy. I have bought a couple mods for the armor but, I'm sure you can't buy the plans to build the PA.
---
In real life a shotgun has a much further effective range.  In real life, shotguns don't just turn to tickling anything beyond 20 feet.  If you want realistic ballistics, play Rising Storm 2 or Arma.
---
I suppose this is possible, but as others mentioned it does sound like everything would have to be fairly precise in that situation. However, the primary reason we made this change is that our internal data was showing that a large number of players were becoming Wanted by unintentionally damaging other players' CAMP objects. While there are still ways to be a jerk, we felt that making this change would have more positive impacts for the overall playerbase than negative. 
---
&gt;**Sound Effects:** Pulling the pin on a grenade to prime it before throwing now play audible sound effects for nearby players.
---
Can you "prime it" in a way that the timer is already started? (For that after I throw it, it explodes for i.e. 2 seconds later, rather than 4...)
---
The sweetroll was just sitting there for what must have been  years. I didn't even realize I was stealing it. I didn't know. I DIDN'T KNOW!
---
Don’t you have to have a high iq to be tired of someone’s low iq?
---
100% agree. 
---
Actually there at least 1 Bobby pin box I have found that always give 20 and up to 50 every time it spawns.
---
This was fixed in a hotfix shortly after the patch.
---
Server Maintenance: This one sounds very scary, depending on what they mean by "you may be *asked* to join another world".
---
What if I've only just Powered up Poseidon and/or paid for a load of workshops and collectors only to be told that they're intentionally kicking me out? Tough luck? 
---
Yep and you need to be at least level 35 to farm those places with minimal risk of death. 
---
"Feed the people" has eaten my best two handed and alot of my ammo because I clicked too fast :((
---
Thanks for the downvote? I guess. I take it you cant read huh?
---
No, it was the amount on his actual characters at the time of the ban. The email even pointed that out. I try to give most people the benefit of the doubt slightly but when you see all these so-called banned for no reason post on Reddit, GTA 5, and many other forums and games over and over you get jaded to that "Banned for no reason" stick because you know from experience most of the time they were banned for reasons. Also, he had 140k on one account and 255k on another of just ultracite that he "gathered" in 1 month. Not to mention the rest of the Ammo. He was also banned before the whole ban wave happened and trying to play it off like he got caught up in the ban wave and that it was an error.  
---
I got my first verbal thanks from someone randomly finding my drop in Watoga train station yesterday, after I dumped a bunch of stuff there and happened to be hanging around outside, within area audio distance. They were happy about the 10mm I left specifically.
---
I've also dumped large amounts of legendaries and mats at Artisan's Corner more than once, and made sure people in the area knew about it. Got some heart emotes from some of those encounters, ignored on others.
---
I remember how nice it was to find stuff, sometimes at very crucial moments. It's nice to think you might be helping someone else out.
---
&gt;You can farm absurd amounts of ultracite, you can buy a variety of pure flux for 25-50 caps each, there's no reason someone would dupe ammo if they know how to play the game.
---
Of course it's a lot easier to just dupe it.
---
Jesus....
---
Any chance that the "Slay Bells" skin for the Death Tambo has had its sound restored? As of earlier this morning, it is still silent. 
---
:(
---
I’ve been dying to find some! I had one in fo4, but haven’t found it yet. Do you remember how you got it? Also, thanks for doing an amazing job giving this crybaby a taste of their own medicine 
---
You might have just triggered a (another) rewatch of the entire series for me haha.
---
Well there's this weird backlash that post history is somehow private information and going through it is somehow an invasion of privacy.
---
I assume this comes mostly from people with posts they don't want to be judged by. 
---
yes, and it took me roughly 700 hours to get my first explosive shotgun. and it was a mutant's.
---
regardless of how poor my rng is, point is that this happens, it happened to me. but everyone is running around with explosive shotguns, handmades, etc. not crappy randoms, like a 10mm. and people sporting sentinel are always either assassin or unyielding.
---
the vast majority are dupes.
---
Yeah, if it's legit the total amount in inventory or storage at the time, then I agree with you. The wording of the email said he "acquired" that amount though, which I read as being the sum total he's had, including what's been traded away or used.
---
You two should meet after school, out back by the dumpsters (and kiss.)
---
Icarly or old anime one is best.
---
The servers are still crashing though.   It didn't fix much of anything it seems 
---
Railway rifle still does not benefit from any perks. Please address this soon. I know it’s on the devs radar but this gun seriously needs this to make it more viable
---
Did they fix the issue with favorites where if you have two of the same weapon but with different mods they disappear or change places when you log?
---
Yeah and now you can see whose camp it is. I wonder how much stuff can be destroyed until wanted status is gained.
---
i generalliy find no remorse for super high level players
---
All I can say is I feel bad for you. You seem unhealthy addicted to this online game. 
---
So can I take herd mentality without my shared perk cards falling off or no? I've seriously reset my mutations 4 times at this point because when it's mentioned in bug fixes it's not entirely clear if this mutation is fixed yet
---
where what was stated? what the hell are you talking about?
---
Exactly. Given that speedy receiver is near impossible to find, at least for me; time to dump the Gatling guns.  
---
Doesn’t understand what?  The shitty MAGA hat reference?
---
Was banned, found this funny as hell. Life is to short.
---
At least you can be done wasting your time with this shit game 
---
Future Atom Store item.
---
The real fix for scorchbeasts is going to be removing them entirely while adding story to the game and advancing the plot past the Scorched as enemies. 
---
It was still doing it yesterday
---
Look at mr 900hr post history he got baned made a poat about it before the 900hr post then after that 900h farming post got traction made another poat about his ban 
---
Except that it doesn't happen like that.

Amazing. Bethesda came down on people grossly overloading their inventories, then on the duped items, followed by the dupers.
---
Suddenly there is enough room within the server performance to expand the stash size by 33%.
---
It really is starting to look like quite a few issues for the past months were caused by bad players exploiting various aspects of the game, and now that they are being dealt with (finally) we're all reaping the benefits.
---
Has "Select structure" when making a blueprint been fixed? It has been broken for a while now.
---
*Coughs in contempt*
---
What the hell are you talking about?  You said high bounties than sentinel armor.  
---
Every time I see more news on the dumpster fire Bethesda has become, I’m glad I cut their games out of my life. I don’t know how I ever fooled myself into thinking they’re good.
---
Here I am, thinking the tuba should be under “Brass instruments” and “wind instruments” should be woodwinds. Clarinet, Saxophone...
---
Lol that’s hilarious. Yes during sbq fights there’s actually a lot of legendary creatures spawned. I picked up a double barrel explosive shotgun off a NON-legendary scorched zealot I killed during the fight.
---
The stash increase is most welcome and the fusion core change will be handy too.
---
I would like to ask if there's any possibility that plans for the X-01 PA mods will be added at any point?
---
easy way to get it, go whitesprings and farm for it.
---
Better yet, go to the vendor at whitesprings, u will find loads of players dropping 1* armor from their farming. U would always find one there depending on the server activity. 
---
I used a 1* chameleon from level 20 all the way to level 80. I found a 3* one later on and ever since, I have been using it.
---
Hopefully what ever was causing sneak to act crazy will be fixed.
---
when you look at the mini-map, workshops have a little health bar, which displays the health of items in a workshop. zero health bar means nothing has been built, or everything is destroyed. most owned workshops have zero health and are only used for free fast travel.
---
&gt;Don’t even know what you’re implying.
---
That was you, Jussie. That is exactly what you wrote. 
---
I don't feel that phrase should apply to 4. I felt the game captured the fallout universe perfectly.
---
no, give us legendary drills plz. Some of us want that. Chainsaws too. And please fix the level lock for drills (level 20 max) and rippers (level 40 max)
---
This sounds like a reason to build ! I can make a panic room. 
---
A dev room is a room/area that is used for testing things. Generally has normally unobtainable items and such.
---
When is that roadmap coming? Its almost been a month.
---
Hey! Yes this will still occur for now. As you mentioned in your other comment, this was introduced when we made the change that prevented Bulk from autoscrapping while crafting. 
---
To stop Scrap All Junk from autoscrapping bulk in your inventory, but still allow it to autoscrap from the stash while crafting, we need to introduce some new functionality. This is being worked on, but isn't part of today's patch. We'll definitely let you know when that change is in place and ready to roll out though.
---
OBV workshops are PVP arenas, but these arenas currently don't have borders.   I'm happily waiting for more PVP content, but i want it to be working and balanced, not the easily exploitable system that we currently have.  From what i can tell, todays PVP changes seem to make workshop PVP more exploitable, not less.  
---
How can we see users' deleted comments please synk? Sounds useful :)
---
If having 100,000 garden gnomes is wrong, I don't want to be right.
---
and here i thought I was just doing it wrong the whole time lol
---
I did not help my self to their ill gotten goods.  I tool them to fissure site prime jumped into one of the holes of green goop around their and let that be that. It was literally to get rid of the items. Dupers ruined the economy entirely and if i can inconvenience them even mildly i will.
---
I said don’t even know what your implying to your shitty Hat reference.  
---
This is all perfect. Just one thing... Energy weapon durability!!!
---
I would have to go way back in the posts to find it, but I seem to remember them saying that quite a while back when everyone was asking why it was taking so long to take care of the duping issue.
---
" but I stopped playing " -- why are you here? 
---
I guess is that you got flag for selling ammunition well they believe you are.
---
Ill be honest, I uninstalled the game after yesterday.
---
&gt;If you deploy a mine and then pick it back up, it appears in your inventory as a separate item from the main stack of mines, each individual mine will appear as its own stack after pick up
---
The same goes for throwing knives. I don't know if it also works like that for tomahawks, since I haven't actually used any, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. 
---
most people with high bounties that aren't using team mechanics to bait hunters are wearing sentinel.
---
they have such a high bounty precisely because they can't be killed easily.
---
Ah thank you!
---
You know what, my own first instinct is to always avoid subreddit drama when I promote anything official so as to not associate my channel with drama (I typically hate YouTube drama channels), but damn... after I posted this I went into the sub to see what’s up, saw that guide bit... my first thought was “oh son of a b*tch...”, lmao. 
---
But hey, thank you for the support! I’m trying to up the quality with each one until I get the videos to a quality I’m comfortable with. I’m glad to see it’s noticed. 
---
If no one fought in here, bethesda would be in a lot of shit. People are fighting over whether this game is worth playing. The overwhelming majority of critics and players have said no. 
---
Theres a few arguing back and forth. Those are who are arguing to leave or stay. For the majority, the argument is a decision to stay and a default to not play. 
---
Its easier to argue to not do something than to do something.
---
The premise is as long as an object is physically destroyed - but you could damage every object to as close to 100% as possible and just peter out without a bounty. It's an incredibly specific scenario, but it is theoretically possible - I still agree the change is positive. 
---
Perhaps they could re-implement it where a certain threshold is reached. An accidental shot is one thing but if I smack your generator 5 times with my Super Sledge, that's pretty intentional. 
---
Exactly. and I pointed out that you are the one who doesn't understand. Why is your IQ so low, Jussie? 
---
Yeah I’m truly going to miss soaring through the air with rad worms marsupial. But I knew it had to come to an end someday. 
---
Energy weapons fix was promised for March.
---
You should specify next time.  
---
what's the purpose of having a chameleon piece and the chameleon mutation at the same time? I don't think you can have Weightless and chameleon so you would just be negating the mutation by wearing it. 
---
Even without any chameleon, no one shows up on the map when sneaking. I'm pretty sure what's making you not appear on radar is your sneak perks causing your radar dot to not appear until someone is very close, especially if their perception is low.
---
Chameleon on its own, like using one chameleon piece, doesn't cause you to not appear on radar. Your build is an exception to basic chameleon use
---
Passthrough conductors or whatever they're called do this.
---
We're glad you skipped it too. And everyone else who feels the need to drop by and say *this* *exact* *same* *thing* *like* *please* *stop* *BEATING* *THE* *DEAD* *HORSE*
---
https://redditsearch.io
---
That’s a good tip, thanks! Farming just basically means killing a lot of various enemies in this case, right?
---
Well it's the largest reason why people are getting banned. Havnt found anyone yet who caught a ban and didn't have a mule. I'm sure they are out there, but I haven't seen one yet.
---
My IQ is high enough to know how to set PUBG to FPP.
---
I've saved plenty of posts on Android.... But I don't know how to get back to them! 
---
Community Influences are fast tracked and are typically the loudest of the squeaky wheels. The game was rigged from the start. 
---
I'll give you a pass because you seem nice. :)
---
hmmm, thank u for this perspective, i hadn't considered the radius being an impairment.  
---
Right‽ Time to stop storing my near-full ones in the stash and swapping around to get rid of the crappy 20%ers
---
So, no stealth fixes? No ranged weapons improvements (energy and/or ballistic)? Good work :D
---
&gt; My most wanted fix is among the oldest of issues, yet again Energy weapons have been totally ignored as have Heavy Weapons in general (save for the grenade launchers but who uses them?)
---
I'm a Heavy Gun build character and love the energy weapons but they just seem to blatantly ignore the issue preferring to tout the party line "we are aware of that issue and are discussing it internally"
---
I agree that the energy weapons and heavy guns could use some love. My CAMP got attacked by a horde of Super Mutant Mini Gunners so I finally got one only to use it and realize that it was just slapping enemies. Very non-fun. 
---
Oh, I thought getting 1 cap in random cap stashes was not a bug, but a random "bad luck" choice
---
it's pretty obvious to anyone who's played long enough.
---
I see what you did there.. Wait til a ton of people left the game so that you could add stash space!
---
U didn't say "get good" to him?
---
Absolutely correct!  I play in 'explore mode' pretty much solo.  Similar to how I play Fallout 3/4.  The world design is top notch.   I could care less about building, PvP, etc... ( the stuff most people seem to be complaining about ).   I do suspect many play like I do.  
---
One difference from Fallout 3/4....I do tend to crouch quite a bit!   :-)
---
This sub has mods?
---
Seriously.  I commented on this as well.  I don't want to be one of *those* guys, but lack of server persistence is what has completely turned my off of this game.  I just show up for the patch notes now.
---
Do you use Skeet Shooter?
---
By the golf course, u get loads of high level ghouls, so it is a good exp farm. u get alot of legendary ghouls in the bunch. Ur bound to take home some decent items.
---
Long may it continue 👍 
---
maybe because he's hopeful and you dont ave to play a game to enjoy the subreddit
---
But why would it be considered wrong to pick it up if you find it? Where in the ToS does it say you cant pick up loot bags?
---
Ouch! How long do the repairs last typically? Have you tried the basement of M.D.? It's been a while so I can't remember specifically if there's any there.  
---
No, not at all, I don’t make assumptions on what armor people have.
---
Thank you! I'm just mindful about putting the bulk into my stash before scrapping all. The new 800# limit will definitely help with that. 
---
I too have the hoarding bug.  To the point where I have to have an internal intervention with myself as to whether I really need to pick up EVERY piece of trash I find, but I think it stems from the fact that ever since FO4 my brain has been trained to always pick up duct tape / glue whenever I find it...
---
This is why single player games shouldn't be online Bethesda, and obviously you can't handle an online game. 
---
+ karma
---
You didnt play at launch then. it crashed a whole lot more back then.
---
Fake News
---
I could be wrong but i am pretty sure it was for total amount as the email says you were found exploiting 140k on your main account and also found to be exploiting the secondary account and lists the rest of the ammo and ultracite he had.  It also states he will be unbanned after future patches fixes the issues. I take that the issues are duping and things of that nature and once they figure a way to balance all that he will be reinstated. 
---
I've been watching Rust gameplay lately and some of those built up servers look like the game Fallout should have been.
---
I'm not sure if a bug or not, but the enclave bots from "bots on parade" quest just stand around the bot stop doing nothing except saying their lines when interacted and defending their position against enemies.
---
I assumed they were going to take a walk, since it's, you know, "bots on **parade**", and explore the surface and all, but they don't move anywhere. So far I've tried the bot stops near Watoga and Camden park and they both don't "work".
---
I'm thrilled.  Now I can jump in power armor while having radworms and not smash into the ground every time.  I will miss my super-powered food and drink a little bit.  c'est la vie
---
Reach higher, you almost got it.
---
Oh ok. I understand. If you accidentally hit a camp item you don't get wanted status, but you will if you destroy it.
---
I'd also like to add the bug that the CAMP item keypad pylon does not require the use of the keypad, making it pointless. I really want to be able to lock things with it.
---
It was probably the Marine Armor Helmet and Hunters Hood
---
I remember the same thing happened on r/heroesofthestorm. People posting about getting banned for "no reason" when they were actually incredibly toxic... until blizz employees posted the evidence against them. Put a stop to that bullshit real quick
---
Translation:  "I found some people doing some shady shit, so I did a little shady shit myself because I didn't think there would be any *real* consequences (ie *I thought I could get away with it*).  Boy, was I wrong.  Now that I've been banned for doing something I shouldn't have been doing in the first place, I better see if I can get my money back to try to further avoid taking any type of responsibility for my own actions."
---
&gt;**Martial artist**
---
Yay, 3 points of strength freed for my Heavy Guns mode. I'll crank up the damage output now ;)
---
&gt;**Feed the people**
---
Fantastic!
---
&gt; **Rad Worms** 
---
Saw a trapper arm that had sentinel as the secondary effect at Watoga station vendor this morning.
---
Can't get passed the fact you put 900 hours into such a bad game. 
---
I am so out of the loop 
---
Not workshop doors, but concrete foundations that are indestructible. I agree there are holes in how it’s patched but there were ways to prevent anyone from getting the workshop
---
This happened to me in a set of X-01. Luckily it was in a clearing so I got my loot back...
---
you were cheating and got banned. stop acting like the victim, Jussie 
---
I'm leveling my first heavy weapon's character and intentionally did not take Martial Artist because I have always assumed it was a bug that would be fixed.
---
Now I just want a Kung-Fun movie with Shaolin Monks doing Zaney Fu with gatling guns.
---
Did they manage to fix the wall hanging cabinet/stash?
---
It feels so good to see the exploiters choke on this....ahhh...do continue , please...
---
This would be better, they are currency less than useless
---
probably because you haven't played long enough or aren't well versed in pvp.
---
if someone has a bounty in the thousands and there's no teammates around, they're probably sporting something worthy of those caps.
---
One thing that caught my attention was the 900 hours guy says he trades between his main and alt using a mule.
---
Im partly keen to believe that they have no mechanic to track items uniquely, so legendary weapon with 3 specific mods between all players is essentially the "same item".
---
therefore they are unable to track if i drop a item to the world and pick that item back up with an alt uniquely, they just see account X has acquired 2 of  the same item, they probably have another entry in that same db that says account X has lost 1 of the same item. (but i highly doubt anyone wrote the query to account for that)
---
I could see that as showing up as if i gather 5k ammo and give it to a friend and then that friend gives it to my alt as it showing my account as having acquired 10k ammo. because technically i did get 10k ammo across my account since i'm pretty sure they don't care how i got rid of that ammo, i could have fired it, traded it or turned it into food for the people. 
---
This just seems like all the more reason to stop hoarding so much stuff, we already know we cant trade ammo to vendors, you dont carry anything worth using in a .45 why, oh look more 10mm ammo let me grab that cause its rare.
---
&gt;Will get this documented, thank you! Are there other specific items you know of that do this as well?
---
Power generators (specifically the fusion one) and potted plants.
---
Other objects seem to check what's either above them or below them and refuse to plonk down in a legitimate place, but I'm not sure about this.
---
Maybe to you. I use workshops all the time.
---
If you say so, but without a video .. no real proof it happened.
---
happens to me a lot.
---
I don't know what causes the bug but when it happens to me I go check their spawn point and their body is usually there. However, there is no option to loot. This happens to me with at least a quarter of the legendaries at white springs. I hope they fix it soon. 
---
Banned people shouldn't have done things to get them banned.  Tough cookies.
---
Ya, and i did that every single time i took a workshop to give myself some time to react.   without barricading the workbench, players could just tag it and their teammates could kill u anywhere on the map instantly, and they could do it repeatedly as u respawned without ever fully taking the workshop from you.  tag the bench, kill the owner, repeat.   this is much easier to do now that u cant barricade the bench. 
---
This kid fucks.
---
Should have bought a couple days ago, prices on the higher end versions are going to be 25k-75k now.
---
That’s also an assumption.
---
Diapers bro. They have some real premium ones out there. 
---
We actually had a guy in my squad get banned so there IS a ban wave going through for sure. Some are probably legit
---
Am I reading it wrong or is that a suspension notice? Like I know it could take forever till they patch the game in a way that allows him to play again but it’s not a permanent ban
---
Sometimes the body teleports to where they "spawned". Good luck figuring out where that is though, Some spots if you have farmed them enough  you know where the boss/legendary spawns.
---
Yeah, there are a LOT of separate entities being tracked in a queen battle. Ca definitely see how framerate and stability would be issues. 
---
Increased stash sized, reduced spring costs, nerfed scorchbeasts, yawn, fucking yawn, something that should of gone through QA and handled before the game even launched. These random stability and value improvements have gotten so old and annoying. This isn’t shit we should be having a concern about almost 4 months in. 
---
I’ve got the same question as you regarding a similar incidence. This past Saturday a friend of mine happened to get in a server where he and one other person were the only two in it for some reason. No tricks or illicit behavior. He just started a session and for some reason it was just the two of them. I didn’t find out until they were already roughly 9 hours still in the same server and he had collected 100s of legendaries, mostly 1 and 2 stars, though some 3s. I joined in around 11 pm est that night and can confirm that all enemy levels and types were dropping legendaries, usually around one every 2-4 kills.
---
We didn’t know why this was happening nor how he’d gotten lucky enough to be placed in this server, but if you had the time why would anyone leave?? 
---
I don’t have any answers but we were considering the possibility that random legendary drops (regardless of enemy level/type) may be a thing and most of the time it goes unnoticed bc there are far more players in a session killing enemies all over the map. . .
---
We also noticed a trend of around every hour the legendary perk combos would consistently change. As in, we would see a similar perk set per drop for a set period of time, then it’d eventually change to another perk set, and so on
---
Still nothing on the caution bug introduced in last patch. Again, one of the games core mechanics is currently messed up and rather than it being something that should have been hotfixed immediately, it is still on the back burner if even being looked at at all.
---
This bus has stopped me playing since the last patch. No sneak attack bonuses, no healing from healing factor, never knowing if an enemy is actually near me or not, all because I am near permanently in caution.
---
It baffles me that this wasn't right at the top of the list of things to fix after the last patch, it should have been in the hotfix, it is too much of a core mechanic of the game to remain broken for this long.
---
Sneak - Vats build: Broken
---
Sneak - Melee build: Broken
---
I guess I will check back next month to see if it is worth playing with either of my characters.
---
Wait, you mean the people banned for duping and cheating ... \*gasp\*  ... LIED TO US???
---
Even with the speedy receiver the Gatling gun needed martial artist to be viable even with the bloodied explosive tag. I have used all heavy weapons and I loved that one because it was fun in its design. I felt the martial artist should have been intentional as it was cranking the handle.  let’s hope they rebalance all heavy weapons soon. All energy weapons, heavy in specific, are actually unusable due to their laughable damage and instantly breaking. The Gatling was good with all the perks it wasn’t even close to the dps of shotguns and rifles. And now it will be garbage tier. The .50 cal is so expensive you spend more time hunting down ammo than actually playing the game. It’s just a shame I always loved being a power armor heavy guns user like the brotherhood. But it’s so hard to play that way in this game :(
---
Marine Helmet from the dev room most likely.
---
&gt;getting banned for a dupe glitch
---
Why can't they like nuke the guys inventory if they abused the glitch? Every other game i have played that had exploits like this did exactly that. Nuke your inventory/stats/items and give you a warning.
---
I’m not lol.
---
&gt;anonymity
---
on reddit? the avatar fagging website of the internet?
---
Fuck knows but I want it.
---
/u/Valseek pls :( 
---
There was another user who had a brilliant idea of re-purposing the Grafton Monster into something that roams around the entire wasteland, getting stronger (and also getting additional loot) with each thing it kills, sort of like a hostile version of Grahm.  While Bethesda does have a number of enemy variations for each area, you do become familiar with where the "random encounters" show up.  An NPC that is a true X factor in the world would be kind of fun, I think.
---
I haven't crashed since the ban wave. funny how that happens 
---
I feel like talking to trump supports.  Literally treason happening with Russia BUT THE WALLLL.
---
BUTTRR THE DUPING! 
---
If you happened to read the email he was not perm banned. It states once patches in the future fix issues then his account will be reinstated. I figure they are talking about patches that fix duping and stuff and a way to balance it all. 
---
Is the gat suppose to have a 400 fire rate? 
---
Yeah it's sooo annoying. I've lost way too many 3 stars thanks to this bug :/ only thing I can recommend is hit them fast and try to open the tra sfer window instead of manually taking the items. This will allow the contents of corpse to be looted even if it disappears. 
---
**Weapons:** The M79 Grenade  Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as heavy  weapons, and correctly benefit from all heavy weapons perks except Heavy  Gunner, as they benefit from Demolitions Expert instead.
---
Dangit.  I put all those points into shotguns and demolition, and this?  I stopped playing my main because of the encumbrance limit, and started a new toon, and now I have to spend the next 10-15 levels reallocating my points on my new toon?
---
I'm sensing a trend here.
---
post history says that is a lie, Jussie 
---
Stick to lurking, posting isn’t really your forte.
---
Yes bc no one would dupe screws steel wood lead acid etc to make items nope they would only duped tse guns lol 
---
Hope they fixed the quick access dial on PS4. After last patch I couldn’t have two variants of the same type of weapon assigned. Say if I put two Gatlings on the dial, one Hunter’s the other Bloodied, they will stay there in this session but when I log out and go back in, one will disappear. It’s as if the system was now treating all variants of the same type of weapon as ONE weapon. 
---
Also, STEALTH is still broken. Which I stated a long time ago, was something broken from fallout 4 that they don’t even know how to fix, which is never going to get fixed. STILL can’t play my original character because stealth is permanently broke.
---
My grenades have a pretty good spread. ... and there are *so many* enemies...
---
SJW dev team ruined the IP, the company will sell it eventually 
---
I was also thinking the confederate hat as well. It always said I had the plan known but there was never an option to make it.
---
Nope, they cheated.  They're banned. Good riddance.
---
Personally if they were banned from the game I think they should be banned from the reddit.  They clearly proved themselves toxic to the game if they were banned.
---
This is a great update.
---
Having quantity sliders stop at 1 is going to be so great.
---
Not smashing into the ground every time I jump with power armor, marsupial and radworms is going to be great.
---
Having my crappiest fusion core being automatically used without popping out of my armor and manually swapping in the lowest charge is great.
---
Not being bombarded by sonic blasts is going to be great.
---
Not sure why player icons are a thing of importance, but whatever.
---
Aw Jussie.
---
Yeah, thankfully people aren't getting banned permanently for exploiting a loophole that they allowed into their game.  
---
Maybe dupers and people with mule characters with hundreds of thousands of items are bogging down their servers and they're trying to bring stability by banning those accounts until they can patch in a fix.  The #1 gripe from players is getting bumped from the servers and choppy game play.  Maybe this is what needs to be done until they can remedy duping and or mule characters.  Still do feel for banned players as it's not like they're criminals and they still enjoy the game like the rest of us.
---
I notice the same. my guess is server/client desync and general server fuckery.
---
He did something he shouldn't have done, even admitting in the post that he knew it was wrong when he stated that he believed Bethesda was just going to delete duped items. He made a bad decision and bad decisions carry consequences.  Now he's wanting to see if he can get his money back because he got caught?   BS. 
---
*#banmetoo*
---
Go back to whatever social media platform you came from
---
based on what you posted so far, yeah.
---
assumptions keep us alive. it's what tells someone fresh out of the vault that they shouldn't venture into bat-infested parts of the map.
---
anyone who's pvped long enough or just played really, would be able to instantly recognize a sentinel.
---
Proving my point. The serves often crash if more than one nuke launched.
---
How about they focus on building strong servers that can survive almost anything..
---
Stop hiding behind duping when servers can even only handle 600 pounds of stuff apparently 
---
That is true.  I haven't played with the mirv grenades much.  Do you have to throw them really high to get the max spread?
---
True. I tried to claim an unowned workshop where the owner must have logged off or d/c. All the entrances were barricaded and I couldn't get through. I went to another server. 
---
Lmao how are you gonna tell me what I have and have not done
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Yet when asked directly, do you dupe/cheat  you either don't reply or spout a load of BS.  So come on either say you didn't cheat or admit you did. Or you could grow up and accept your punishment.
---
&gt; ‽
---
WHAT IS THIS MUTANT‽
---
Yes the only thing that vanishes when u leave the server is ur camp
---
Lately? how about never. looted plenty of 2 shots. looted a good amount of  explosive. never the both. 
---
Glad stash limit is increased once again, but i hope this isn't the end. I have two mule characters and both are almost at their limit. 
---
I haven't found one period... probably 200 hours in
---
Oh god he had to compare duping to politics its getting worse 
---
A day later I'm even upset anymore. Life is way to short to worry about it. I hope everyone that their account was suspended for one reason or another learned a lesson and will move on. I still love the franchise and support Bethesda.
---
The dude said he is currently off work due to an injury and he threw himself into the game to keep himself occupied. If you've ever went from working 60+ hours a day to none it is insanely hard to just stop and do nothing.
---
It really isn't that hard to believe that someone who is stuck at home from an injury who is used to working long hours could put 10+ hours into a game they enjoy.

I regularly have 25-30k ammo on me, maybe more. I also have a couple weapons spread around my account that I suspect are duped. I sure hope this doesn’t mean a ban is coming.
---
this game gets heat from every single forum and medium out there, on their own forums, other gaming forums, word of mouth, twitch, you name it, not just reddit
---
the game is going down hill, it has been going down hill, you all in denial, lmao
---
The high iq play would be memorising a players name in the game if you feel like you’re about to get disconnected , then joining that players session when you get disconnected 🗿
---
Look in to surface to air event the damn scorched spawn inside the Sam site and immediately destroy it
---
Rubbish, rubbish, and more rubbish.
---
This! This and more subtle / everyday character poses and idol animations 
---
The best thing I've ever looted was a furious explosive black powder pistol 
---
Same. 
---
The hotfix after the last patch is what broke it. Patch 5 made bulk items not autoscrap when you needed them for crafting. 
---
The hotfix fixed that particular issue but also made them autoscrap when you selected “scrap all junk”
---
April 1st release date
---
Probably got specifics because he got a mess of upvotes.

Man, you can’t type that the way you did and call someone an idiot haha

Anyone else have FPS issues at certain places? Especially Whitespring Bunker it drops me from 100 FPS everywhere else to 40-60 and crazy warping / lag when moving mouse. Doesn't make sense that I have worse performance inside buildings vs in the open world. Tested with a friend with similar PC and he doesn't have drops to below 100 there. I tried all different settings in game and nvidia control panel etc but no help.
---
So what you are saying is if people don't play the perfect build they should be banned?
---
oh wait... so your experience is worth something, yet someone who has had the opposite experience is "lying"

I’m on a mission to make it a thing. 
---
I also originally found TNT Dome 2 Key at Mount Blair Trainyard. At the time I didn't think anything of it but I may need to revisit the area and see if I can find anything else related to any of the individuals in this storyline. 
---
Kurt Cobain approves of this meal. 
---
Sadly these "bans" are suspensions. 
---
I was just about to get Martial Artist at my next level for my Gatling. Good thing I held off. 
---
What progress exactly? They've only done 1 thing right in the last 4 months. 
---
He admits to swapping lots of ammo to and from a mule account, which may be a TOS violation even without duping, but idk.
---
I don't know what to think about this and I don't know what I hate more - people trying to weasel out of their righteous ban  or people just making accusations because they think they're Sherlock Holmes.
---
Surprised a constant barrage of disinformation robs these claims of their validity? Maybe the anti-bethesda Cartel of discord weirdos should have padded the breaks on their bullshit
---
Not my opinion as I stated. I never said it's not legitimate bc it broke terms of service. And it's not cheating or anything but it's kinda low ngl. No matter how mad you get it doesn't change the facts. Btw this can be related to a bf5 cheater who is at the top of the leader board for cheating by using multiple accounts. So yes it is low.
---
Happens to me often. Super frustrating. Sometimes i feel like they really do vanish. I have witnessed some corpses fall through the ground as well, that does happen. I wouldn't mind markers over unlooted corpses or something.
---
now you have posted this ridiculous pov, everyone can block you if they so choose.
---
It's much easier to get around a reddit ban than a Bethesda ban. If they want to be here, they're gonna be here. 
---
That sweet sweet trash!
---
That’s for the tip👍🏻 I’ve tried trash cans before but they kept telling me it’s full before I could put more than a couple items in them. Sacks however are like bottomless pits 😂
---
And they should be banned from Facebook, and Costco, maybe local their local libraries too!
---
See the problem with this?  This is a social media site that's not officially affiliated with Bethesda &amp; Fo76.  You can't just ban folk from random places because of how they act at a completely unrelated place.  To get banned here, they would need to violate rules here. 
---
I feel you.  The other day I snuck into a crack house, and stole all of their crack.  I then walked from the crack house, with a big bag of crack marked "Full'o'da'crack" down the street to the city dump where I dumped all the crack for great justice!  Unfortunately the cops had the place wired and recorded me taking the crack, and busted me for possession.  What a world!  What a world!
---
From today's patch notes:  
---
"**Scrapping:** Bleached Dogwood is now protected from autoscrapping when crafting. However, it can still be scrapped manually. "  
---
Am I missing something here?  
---
Is there a reason why you can't just flag all Bulk\_Whatever items with the same protection tag as you applied to Bleached\_Dogwood in this patch and Hardened Mass in a previous patch for example?
---
Wood armor with the shrouded mod is really, really cool for a stealth build. It's the closest thing we have to a ghillie suit, so.... sniper build?
---
Got suspended on one account Jussie.  I’m not worried about nor crying in my own little thread.  But I am tired of seeing posts from window lickers like you, Jussie.
---
Huh, they actually made some fixes to the Nuka Girl outfit (muffled squealing) -- anybody know if she will have human skin again as well?
---
Still hoping for a fix that allows VATS targets to be selected if the left mouse button is remapped. I really want to use VATS but can't learn a new control scheme.
---
that's all fine and dandy but when are we going to address the legendary mechanic itself? or are you people ok with locking good equipment behind astronomically low odds?
---
dupers are bad. that's the status quo, I get it. but my point is that, if it wasn't for them, TSEs would never have been nerfed because only a select few would have access to them. that's how rare they are.
---
I use an alt account to trade all the time.  I've even traded weapons back and forth (mod them on one character, pass off to mule, hand back to original character) etc.  Doesn't seem to matter for weapons, but I don't think that is what they are looking for in this pass.
---
the what? 
---
Same. I have 300 plus hours into this dumpster fire and have never encountered a TSE drop. Lots of two shots and explosives though. 
---
Yeah Bethesda should give "join world" option from the recent players window so you don't have to rely on that. Kind of hard to accept the invite when the other player is busy killing peeps. 
---
Thank you so much for the new patch! Please keep up your work to make this game a great one!
---
If this was any other game, I would agree with this. But this is 76, and  the devs have shown to not really be on top of the ball, and there is a good possibility of mistakes.
---
Picking up a bag of loot containing 500 circuits or 700 steel isn’t unusual.  Picking up a bag of loot containing 50,000 nuka colas is a little different, you know?  
---
The 100k ultracite ammo is a dead giveaway no way can you craft that much shit.
---
Yes, but mind you I have been consistently farming legendaries instead of actually playing the game. I got a TSE black powder rifle a few days ago. Does pretty high damage still, even with the nerf, but I think AAE is a better thing to farm for at this juncture than TSE.
---
Larger beds will also do this sometimes, as well as taller dressers, pianos and the larger weapons workbench.  Not consistently, but sometimes.  It seems to be related to what kind of upper floor or roof, and specifically with the large tent.  Very difficult to place an largish item inside of it.
---
I managed to blow some of the metal parts off the Flatwoods monster and revealed a set of tiny little legs inside. \[Baby Legs\]([https://i.imgur.com/lhNXyyU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/lhNXyyU.jpg))
---
Cap Collector works just like the other discovery perk cards. You press a separate button with the cap stash open to "discover" additional caps.
---
And they need to fix the fire rate tool tip too...  it certainly is nowhere near 400.
---
I love that build and I love punishing bad guy. Once a dude was trying to steal a workshop from someone else and I crit him with the chameleon armor. Then I messaged the owner of the workshop because he had a tower in front of his turret which mean his settlement couldn't defend himself. He thanked me and the other guy left the server.
---
My two-shot combat rifle and lever action are **pretty much** accurate while aiming, and there is a small spread between the two bullets, which can sometimes make me miss a headshot with one of the bullets... My handmade is a completely different story. That damn thing acts as if there is a second barrel mounted on the gun at a 45 degree angle. I can literally hit two different corners of a building at the same time. 
---
Many years ago I worked for Dillards and this was definitely their thing. Management had no fucking spine. Look, if you're just going to cave to the customer demanding you accept their semi-fraudulent bullshit, then let me cave first. Why go through this charade?
---
Wow when I heard about the measures taken to get rid if dupers by looking strictly at numbers of items, I KNEW Bethesda would screw that up, too.
---
oh wow "window lickers" 
---
Someone is angry. 
---
I just saw this in the patch notes and wanted to pass it on to you:
---
One of Us: The Congressional Access Card is no longer lost if the player is disconnected or the server crashes.
---
Hopefully this is what can fix the quest for you!
---
Oh man i would have some fun with legendary chainsaw
---
He really did a disservice to the community by potentially sending the devs in the wrong direction (assuming they believed him), and of course crying wolf.
---
Its....beautiful....
---
No the email doesn't say he has 100k of ammo just that over the 30 day period they are looking at over 160k ammo went through his hands.
---
Also with excavator PA and farming fissure sites will net plenty of enough untracite to craft that much.
---
cool. 
---
Well I'm glad I'm not alone. Like others have said, found a few 2 shots and one explosive, but never a TSE. Was starting to feel like the only one... 
---
This guy gets it. Skeet Shooter is pretty critical for a shotgun build, especially if you want to shoot from the hip.
---
900 hours is 9 hours a day since launch right?
---
If I block them does that spare everyone else who is enjoying the game from reading there garbage ?
---
Comprehension is 🔑.
---
Return to the top,reread  the post and let it marinate in your mind👍🏼
---
Why are you even here?
---
Played this morning and didn’t know if I’d be the only one rattling around on the server after reading all the reddit posts of people getting banned but it was a full server but everyone was going about their quests, events and vendor routes as normal lol
---
http://i.imgur.com/ulEIV.png
---
Nice. My plan to avoid the ban was to not dupe. It worked!
---
Wow, that just about seals it 
---
I hope weapon balance will be addressed soon. Not just energy weapon, but all across the board.  For example, combat rifle, assault rifle and handmade rifle should be rebalanced. Right now, handmade is like mandatory.
---
When I die just throw me in the traaaaash
---
Hi. Any update on screen sizing? Menu items, map etc are still cut off. Thank you.
---
It's in the basement concourse of Whitesprings with all the other shops.
---
Health bar for the workshop implies the owner built something at the workshop.
---
You're saying you don't want people playing the game ok. I mean it's people like you killing the game, but I guess that's what you want?
---
Jussie 
---
why does the game suck?
---
Whelp, guess I'm watching Wargames today.
---
I regularly have over 30,000 rounds on me and I make 10,000 a pop. My only real crutch is acid. I’ve only played about a third as much as the 900 hours guy and his totals are completely believable.
---
why did you delete the edgy sex comment? 
---
Why does the game suck?
---
Join last world option is a commonly requested feature. Also avoid last world to get away from that world that is crashing and "control disabled" popups constantly.
---
The through the wall power junction seems to always default to the second floor on multi story buildings.  
---
Never found one before. Then again i don't farm, im playing the game as i play every other Fallout, the best item isn't my main goal. The lore is, im doing quite well with my Rifle/Heavy Stealth Build.
---
Agreed
---
It has radworms.  Stop bodyshaming it.
---
these youtubers are the problem they are over exxagerating the problem by over blowing it
---
Well then go grab a degree and get a better job that doesn't treat you like a slave.
---
&gt; Rad Worms now only increases radiation damage taken by 50%, and no longer incorrectly increases Mutation and other effects. 
---
Sad however. I liked to imagine them like Fry's worms in Futurama.
---
I want them again as possible disease!
---
For reference fo4s first dlc was 9 months after
---
Me too, but what if I need almost 200 glass in an emergency? It’s hard to not be a hoarder.
---
Neither am I. 
---
With regards to the loading issues, I’ve been getting a lot of glitches on PS4 when I load into a game and try to pull up my weapon or PipBoy. It causes the controls to lock up and my PipBoy to only show a black screen. Is this something that is being addressed in this patch?
---
There's a plan for a set of beige colored cabinets. One of them is supposed to attach to a wall but it won't snap. Posted about it a while back at the link below.

I'm curiusof this as well.  I've been doing posiden, and the 4 or 5 around and seem to get the same plans over and over.  Going to try a different area next time and see if they are different.

It says in the screen shot that you have more than 100000 in ultracite ammo and .45 rounds. Is that a possibility? 
---
&gt;Crevasse Dam (trick-and-tread rare encounter possibility
---
Can you elaborate on this? Not sure what this is.
---
In artisans corner in WS..ppl usually always drop junk and ammo on the floor
---
This is the most ridiculous post!! Do you even understand the impact that the dupers had on the performance of the servers?
---
 Creating thousands of items so the servers couldn't handle it. Switching to alts that had 100s of thousands while normal gamers lost items due to the servers getting rolled back every 30 minutes.
---
 They had to fix these exploits, remove the items and ban the offending players before anything else could get rolled out.
---
 Oh and look what happened right after the dupe purge. Increased stash, multiple bug fixes and new content to be released throughout the year.
---
I had a squad mate who was a good boy and sent all his technical issues to Beth via the proper channels. One of their people told him the reason he'd get the damage glitch is because his internet connection isn't strong enough LOL obviously that is asinine BS, as the problem went away once Bethesda patched it (then came back because of course it did) but at least we had a new "Josh's bad internet" meme for when we were navigating the technical catastrophe that is 76.  
---
Sometimes, the little dudes bring the bigger fish in. Make things more interesting for us pvp hungry bastards lol.
---
&gt;1,000 ultracite 50 cal ammo
---
That's not hard at all. That's less than an hour of work, hell less than five minutes if you've done lots of nukes. For example, one whitespring run for an hour will produce dozens to hundreds of the non flora material (mostly depending on server processing lag). Definitely enough for several flora (if not dozens)
---
\&gt; , if the nuke drops on an area  
---
WYDM if. You drop the nuke intentionally on abernathy farm or centered on Firebase LT and collect it. i.e. areas with tons of flux you need.  
---
I am not a witchhunter, but I promote people getting good at the game. 1000 50 cal ammo is NOT hard. Ammosmith L2 + Superduper rank 3 means on average you're getting 210 50 cal per craft of normal 50 cal, 420 of ultracite. That's literally crafting 2-3 times.
---
" another no man's sky moment would happen "  
---
We are talking about Bethesda here, they just don't have the hability to do that, it was modder who fixes Fallout 4, because of Bethesda lack of skills.  
---
Agreed. And I think once this foolishness is handled,  it will help.  I was always in the "400 is enough space!" camp, but I'm starting to turn around on that...   
---
Even if it was decorative racks / etc as more space.  Sure, you still only have 800lbs Stash (as of today's patch), but you can still have several 20lb guns hanging on the wall that you can grab, etc.  Same with Armor.  It's not part of the stash, it's part of the camp.  It can be stolen. That's supposed ot be part of the fun!  
---
But I digress...
---
Not banned 
---
Wait, the one in the secure area is a vendor too? What does it sell? I never even thought to interact with it.
---
The fact you would read my post that basically says I'm uncomfortable with the ambiguity because of glitches as I want to cheat, kinda proves you didn't actually read and are being defensive of a broken game. 
---
Plus Reddit has this nice little feature where you can browse people's post history and dig up proof they are lying. The community has been doing a great job linking proof of lying as a response to every upvoted comment and post. So many comments are just pure bullshit.
---
You have played for 1.5 of 3 months. 
---
~2.1k hours in 3 months
---
My group of three claimed that workshop, with our levels 63-122. Another 3-4 people come there lvls 200-400 and kill us two or three time. They didn’t get our caps. We didn’t retreat to camps for fear they’d destroy them &amp; server hopped til we lost them. A-holes! If you’re that bored with the game find another to play. Ridicoulous 
---
also....***THATS WHAT SHE SAID***
---
Lying on Reddit=fraud now? Fuck when did big brothers neckbeard cousin get in charge?
---
I think you should be able to separate the perks at any time, so let's say you want level 3 Dem expert. Only when it's maxed can you separate it so the dem expert 2 is put into the selection and 3 is equipped and if you don't need it you can rejoin them and split them again however you choose up to max points. 
---
cool bro. I get to enjoy the game without crashing while you are suspended for "not" duping 
---
have fun with that, killa 
---
Kinda like calling me Jussie over and over right, Jussie?
---
Nope cheaters and dupers should remain banned
---
Fallout 76 has some of the most devoted apologists I've ever seen. What they don't seem to get is everybody who bought the game wanted it to succeed. People don't sink money and time into something hoping it's going to be a shitshow 
---
Some of the build zones in workshop areas are enormous. So players will be able to hide out in an undefended corner somewhere and take over the whole thing while sneaking? That sounds like a great way to grief the few people that actually use workshops for resources.
---
That is a good idea, thank you! Has that worked well for you?
---
I haven't placed one recently, but fusion generators used to do the same thing.
---
This is still an issue. I killed four (three stars) legendary enemies in my last play through session, and none of them dropped any legendary items. I waited (to compensate for server lag) but nothing dropped. Very frustrating. 
---
Would like to see this fixed (Hot Fix) ASAP. 
---
Also, it would be great if Bethesda could simplify the Legendary system, i.e. 1 star enemies drop 1 star legendary items, 2 stars    
---
drop 2 star legendary items, etc. No fun killing a three star just to get a level 35 one star wood armor piece. (If it drops anything at all). 
---
edge lord RealUncleJussie with the comment delete 
---
have fun with your ban 
---
I like it 
---
You admitted to swapping lots of ammo to and from a mule account, which may violate the TOS, even without duping, but I don't know.
---
I'm probably up there. can't know for sure because I've been through half a dozen characters that were eventually deleted.
---
first time I checked I thought to myself "no way I played for more than 300 hours", then bam. 350. and that was on my least played alt.
---
on PC tho, wouldn't mind starting a nolifers club
---
Its not rare at all. Kill scorchbeasts, pick up ore all around cranberry bog / fissure sites / glass cavern. Most high level players have more ultracite than they know what to do with and either sell or drop it.
---
Excal is definitely more effective and a ton of fun, but I start Volt... again because it is a nightmare to make 
---
If Jussie's shoe fits, wear it, Jussie. 
---
Sub got bamboozled
---
Why does it matter to you? I just don't get these posts pointing out their time investment. 
---
Does it have warp capability?
---
You’re the one calling me Jussie over and over.  
---
I’m level 300 now and all I do is enjoying the wonderland in different locations. The lighting and atmosphere design are absolutely gorgeous. It’s a visual masterpiece. 
---
Ultracite is not the limiting factor in crafting over 360,000 ultracite ammo. Yes, 100k over a 30 day period is the criteria for a ban. Which he verifiably exceeds.
---
I'm sure they can look at how u crafted ur ammo..so I think ur fine
---
Out of curiosity, what made him the one guy?
---
I stopped playing, I didnt stop follwing the game, you can stop playing a game and still invest time in the community and wait for things to improve. Follow it's development. 
---
I stopped playing because I wanted to quite before I got bogged down with the issues and instead watch and wait.
---
No...you seem to be though.
---
How on earth do you prove that you didn't do something?
---
glad to see im not alone...these must be extremely rare drops...and i agree an AAE may be better, but i just want a rifle that does the same damage as my melee items. 3 shots max to kill lvl 70 or below.
---
Are you out of work?
---
I remember in Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, my brother got banned for "Speed hacking".  No idea what the fuck that even is.  This was within a month of launch and the game was laggy/glitchy as hell, especially in keep sieges with 100+ players in the area.   
---
I enjoyed the game so I tried to make a post on his behalf on the forums asking for help, but everybody claimed it was really me that got banned and it was just a total clusterfuck.  Asking for help/pity from people on the internet for being banned is just a huge waste of time because people are dicks and look for any reason not to believe you.
---
Based that on your experience? Or it’s a fact that is proven? Or just what Bethesda said they are?
---
Did they fix the Stealth issue?
---
Berry mentats for highlighting enemies 
---
Grape mentats for better barter 
---
based on their post history? 
---
MacCready approves
---
Please add legendary pipe revolvers!
---
I'm at the point of dropping them too - will have a short stock up period after the stash increase - but 6-10 in the bin is all I ever need
---
...But you're talking still on Reddit, right? 
---
You don't have to say it like that but I think you might be hinting to a fact that something might be wrong in their life and fallout is their escape. I mean the game only came out like 90 days ago and the guy claims to have played it for over 37 days of play time. That's unhealthy.
---
My problem with this change is that it makes it easier for griefers to target players who are harvesting resources and uninterested in PvP.
---
It's a problem I already had several times before this change. A person shows up contentests the workshop but doesn't claim it and never intends to they just want to force someone into PvP. It's gotten to the point now that of someone does this. I logout and play something else because I don't want to spend more resources claiming the workshop again.
---
It is a particularly bad issue with Grafton Steel Yard because you have 30+ super mutants that you end up having to kill in addition to powering up Posiedien if you really want the yard to be productive.
---
oooo wow you really broke down that straw man. how gansta, much thug, very edgy 
---
Not for nothing that 200 extra pounds means I can start an all outfits in the game collection
---
Does this stuff stay if you server hop? It stays on the server it was placed in indefinitely yes?
---
Then you are only seeing a small part then. Because there are a lot more innocent people that got banned that didn’t post here. 
---
they didn't wipe all duplicated items. the wipe only affected a minority of sellers mostly, not actual players.
---
Or trading, or as the person said previously it depends on how they are getting these numbers on Bethesdas end. Like most have said, it seems like what bethesda is doing is counting every bullet that has come and gone out of his inventory, regardless if it is the same ammo he had previously and had been counted previously.
---
Look at it like this, Say you have 5k ammo of one type you don't use, so you mule it to your mule, now both the main and the mule have 5k ammo as far as bethesda is concerned (the email doesn't say he currently has that much on him). Now imagine he decides to try to use a new gun that uses that ammo he muled, so now he transfers it back, guess what? Bethesda now looks at his character and in their messed up coding he now has had 10k ammo even though it is the same 5k ammo he had previously, it just got muled back and forth. Do that a few times and with larger numbers than 5k and you could see how 300k is easily doable without ever actually getting anywhere near that actual amount of ammo.
---
If you rob a bank and they put an APB out looking for you, you don't get to just return all the money and go home.  You still going to jail, bruh...
---
My bad, you're right!
---
As long as you're on the same account multiple toons shouldn't matter. Welcome to the club, you can introduce yourself or we've got a pc set up in the corner if you've got things to be getting on with!
---
come to think of it, seeing the interaction this post got. I will record the next bounty hunting i do. It seems like players would find it interesting.
---
Only reason I take any workshops at all is because I need fusion cores for my power armor and it's the best way to get them at a steady rate. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't go near that PvP crap.
---
No fix to Stealth being broken? Why is this not being adressed asap?
---
Im up to 500 i wish i had 1000 only game ive had more than 1000 was borderlands 2 
---
I read a lot on here about people placing stuff in the overseer's cache and I've always wondered...wouldn't they just get overwritten when someone comes down from the vault and find the beginning of the game loot that's supposed to be in it?
---
Can't get banned if you don't play. 
---
&gt; The thing is Bethesda's justice system banned him so they had the proof.
---
This is a fallacy.
---
It's like saying "Oh well if you got copyright stricken on YouTube you must have violated a copyright".
---
Hey, I think the whole things shit - but I strive to be fair about it.
---
How does post history tell my age? Tell me please, I’d really like to know since I’m literally 51 and retired military. I’ll wait... 
---
What is the “punishing” legendary effect? I’ve experienced the bug the patch is fixing, but I have no idea what effect it’s referring too, I have also had it happen when trying to initiate pvp against someone in power armor, this is confusing as hell, what are you talking about Bethesda? 
---
You can stop playing a game and still remain invested in it, watching and waiting for things to improve. 
---
I chose to stop playing because I knew if I continued at this pace I would get bogged down with the issues and begin to actually hate the game which is what happened with me and Destiny 1. 
---
Instead I choose to stay out of the game but watch for updates and how people are finding the updates in game and waiting for the bigger fixes. That way once I join back in it will feel fresher, less annoying and I'm less likely to rage out.
---
I can’t play this game until more quests have been loaded into it. The daily’s don’t do it for me. 
---
That is assuming it's all crafted, yes. These numbers are still  crazy if you consider trading as well, because of course, massive stockpiles of these ammo types only exist due to duping.
---
Thanks statbot! 
---
Holy crap!!! U found gold in that bag

Our savior! Thanks a ton for it, I was transcribing them thinking it'd be the time to finally get it done and bang, much better than I could have done without having to do extra research.  Wonder if it is still being missing from the Wiki as they got a few of them covered that were more difficult to gather from alternate sources.
---
But I was never suspended or banned? Can you not read? 
---
No, the radium modding world keeps me busy. 
---
Maybe, maybe not.  I think Bethesda would be better off keeping them banned permanently.  They've demonstrated a willingness and eagerness to violate TOS so keep them out from future issues.
---
Yes it was something silly like a lvl ten pipe bolt action. 
---
So did you really fix feed the people because I lost a 10k piece of armor to that event 3 days ago it’s was a lvl50 chameleon butterseed trapper chest piece with strength +1 and weapon weight reduction. Really bummed me out and made me very mad
---
You mean VATS
---
Unlike you, he posted something full of thought. You mad?
---
The guy had more like 250k if memory serves correct but I have to admit, I do like crafting in bulk as well and that's just for a semi-auto. As long as someone isn't legitimately duping, I don't see how it's Bethesda's job to tell people how much ammo someone, "needs".  It probably really comes down to that their servers can't handle so many items at once and that's why everyone has such a rediculoisly-small camp storage.
---
The guy apparently had an injury which took him out of work for a bit. 
---
Not saying he should’ve spent all his time playing video games, but he has a good reason.
---
Not TSE. A couple 2 shots yesterday. Explosive shot a couple days back.  
---
I wonder if the owner can be anywhere in the build area to contest it? Haha what if the owner and contester both use chameleon? It could be constantly contested. I wish Bethesda would present us with all the player feedback before they decide to do something. 
---
Yes. I love my comfortable office job.
---
It's the one with all the crafting stations in it
---
Heh, just found out I was banned as well because ammunition. Cant say I really care, did play a lot but truth is this game is a disgrace. Reviewers said that and so did customers. Sold poorly and most people quit. Personally havent logged in for over a week, wouldnt find out without reading here. They are doing us a favor really.
---
thought aka bull shit
---
This is the only thing that matter of all the patch notes
---
From their explanation above, it looks like doing that would prevent bulk from Auto scrapping to build things if it's in the character stash.  I know some players that bulk all junk so this would break their game.
---
Off the top of my head and please excuse my lack of knowing exactly what the items may be called:
---
Conduit wall pass through will snap to the floor above if you attempt to place it on a wall without a floor piece on both sides of the wall.
---
Similar for the side power conduit wall connector. If you attempt to place it on an inside wall without a floor below it, it will snap to another wall piece on the same level but where the wall is "properly" aligned via inside/outside on the floor piece.
---
I know that's hard to understand and explain, but it's the best I can think of.
---
IRL
---
No, I have a life outside of Fallout.
---
In FFXIV. ,_,
---
Learning all the Radium mods certainly helped me rack up some hours! 
---
I meant like , searching their gamertag up and joining their session. Idk if you’re on pc or not and idk if you can do it on pc but on console that’s something you can do.
---
My main is 233 at the moment, I don't power lever or use any xp boosts, i only sleep before important fights. But the AP refresh Tuba life is Bae. 
---
What is your user name? 
---
I went full Marie Kondo on myself around the beginning of the year after agonizing over my stash to fit a new quad auto tesla rifle in the mix.  I was looking at my scrap and asked myself why I need 500 ceramic.  There's coffee cups and vases everywhere.  I slashed almost everything down to 100 units or less(lead and steel were spared), got rid of my rainy day extra food, water and chems, tossed the bobbleheads and magazines I never used, and wound up with a stash under 450 lbs, even with a couple extra rifles in there.
---
Use the perk that reduces damage from explosions!  My guy is all explosives!  
---
And then we’d cap out at 1000 too honestly. Fallout has always been Hoarder Simulator for me and it’s so hard to get out of that mentality. 
---
I did this with dark souls 1-3 when I was in the middle of the worst depression of my life. Not trying to go too deep here, but it sort of gave me a reason to live at the time. I dunno if these people who play so much have similar reasons, but it just hits me in the feels I guess. 
---
Can you prove fallacy? Other than someone saying "I got banned for nothing" The op got banned for the sheer amount of items he would not have been able to have in just 1 month of crafting and gathering like he said. Not to mention it got found out he was actually banned before the duplication ban sweep which he claimed banned him in error. 
---
I appreciate the increase in STASH size, but is there any plans to make a universal stash that all your characters can access?  Borderlands 2 had "Claptrap's Secret Stash" that did this after people complained about Borderlands 1.
---
You could make it only accessable in the Enclave bunker, to make sure that you have to do a few quests at least before accessing it.
---
there's a thread dedicated to issues like these [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as7w92/i\_got\_banned\_info\_threadmegathread/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as7w92/i_got_banned_info_threadmegathread/)
---
I've got a number of issues not mentioned in the patch. 
---
1. If I favorite more than 1 of the same type of weapon, only one of those weapons stays favorited after relog. I've got 8 miniguns with shredder mods that I used one after another until they are all broken and I have to refavorite 7 of them every time I log in. 
---
2. Laser/plasma gatlings start with the number of cores as the number of rounds after swapping. So if I have 14 cores, the weapon shows 14 rounds/14 cores. So I either have to reload immediately or it will reload after those 14 rounds are shot.
---
3. Speaking of gatlings/miniguns. Why is it that my gatling laser lasts FOREVER before breaking and yet my gatling plasma and miniguns last about 60 seconds each? (I know, incoming gatling laser nerf)
---
Got a Tse double barrel lvl 45 from West tek a couple days ago
---
cool story bro. not cool that you knew to keep your stash low but you let your bro hold thousands of halloween candy. 
---
I think he meant 2.1k total hours in 3 months
---
Lol apparently you cant read. Half the people banned were because of in game trading and picking up 100k items. So blocking banned players from a forum that one of the devs of fallout responds on is rediculous and sounds like you sir need to rethink your role in life and step down a peg or 2. I personally am one of those banned for trading ammunition. So do i deserve to be blocked from a reddit sub thread because your to damn sensitive to actually see the bigger picture? Ive put a few hundred hours in the game. And i feel its people like you who cry and whine about things they have no involvement in making the game that much more distasteful in the eyes of so many player that they just walked away from the game entirely. So think be fore you speak and keep your bs to your self the community doesnt care and i can sure as it shit say this was the most fulfilling 3 min of my time putting the ego down.
---
100.000 **over 30 days** is the current limit, wether it's .50 ammo or fusion cores. If you always have 30.000 and craft every 4 days 10k or just help friends transfering ammo you might be near the auto-ban limit.
---
Glad not everyone is easily duped by dupers 
---
I just block them and go to another server. I also have the Contractor level 2 perk so that greatly reduces the resource cost. They should increase the amount of resources that a workshop has so we don't have to use our own resources but I doubt that will happen.
---
I'm assuming having so many items on one server (via duping and mule characters) is a contributor to the choppy game play and people getting bumped from servers.  It's probably why we have such a small camp storage as well.  Get rid of the players with hundreds of thousands of items in their inventory and improve the server stability.  That's my guess.
---
Not really, as it has been stated elsewhere and by reading the email reply it is obvious bethesda is talking about ammo that has gone through his character, not being on the character all at once. The dude said he has mules and trades back and forth between his mules and main character. 
---
The issue is, with say 25k ammo you go and mule it off to your mule and then back to your main character by bethesdas checks that character has had 50k ammo even though they are double dipping with the ammo and counting it against him twice for the same ammo. Now imagine swapping ammo back and forth a few times and it could easily add up to the numbers you see in the email.
---
Not to mention, it doesn't even make sense. If you are duping why would they only dupe ammo and not items actually worth having. The fact the only thing that seems high is ammo and there is no sign of duped serums, or bobbleheads, or anything, just ammo seems to me more likely he wasn't duping and instead was actually farming like he claims.
---
Ooooohh that’s a great idea. I need to find a list. 
---
Yeah I can totally see that grinding random people's base will be the next griefer's national sport :/
---
One of "RealUncleSam" PMs
---
" Well whatever the hell this was I’m done with this. Enjoy being a little bitch hiding behind a keyboard your whole life. "
---
If they're bad for the game, they're bad for the forum.
---
What is the issue you are having with stealth?  I sometimes get stuck in danger when no enemies are around but not very often and as long as I go through a load screen door while standing it solves the problem.  Other than that I've been running a stealth character with no problems since day one.
---
what? this is news to me.
---
Lolol how many hours I've played 12 for about 2500
---
Where is the endgame Content?
---
Crazy amount of hours. When do start and stop playing? I thought I had a lot of hours in at 350 lol
---
Yes.  Posting in some...infamous...subs can get you banned from other (oppositely) infamous subs.  It's totally up to the mods to determine the rules, so they can be as cutthroat as they want.  And there is no transparency, unless they want to be transparent.  Mods rule the roost in their own subs, almost completely.
---
Hasn't happened to me, I tend to actively avoid those kinds of places, but nothing is stopping the mods here from going over to the /r/fo76FilthyCasuals sub and banning anyone who posts there (as an example, not that they'd do that, it's just possible).
---
If they mods here wanted to verify dupers' post history and ban anyone claiming to break the rules, they could do that, even if it wasn't in the rules.  Or, just ban whoever they didn't like, or who had a name staring with C.  There may well be fallout from doing so (lol), but nothing is stopping them.
---
I'm bummed that you can't make outfits (cloth) on the spinning wheel.
---
And you can't cook on most of the oven/stove/campfire items in the game &gt;:-(
---
Nope, PC, always.
---
To be able to sell the icons on the power shop ? ( atom shop or whatever )
---
Right! 
---
We're supposed to be rebuilding Appalachia, Where's our worlds worth of storage space then!? lol 
---
350 hour gang 
---
No, that was this one:
---
https://youtu.be/OOQnk-hRVuc
---
I heard if you email the Todd telling him you duped he forgives you and grants amnesty 
---
My fear is if I go back into the game and my account is banned from my friends duping. I'd trade with them and try to get unduped stuff but I don't know what is and isn't.
---
Nuka girl suit is 2 pieces, nice little change, despise the helmet.
---
So anyone know what recipe accidentally in game I presume,  was removed?
---
I stopped playing a month or two ago, but I still enjoy the drama.
---
Pretty sure all characters on that account.
---
Seen them here first, cheers OP
---
Ok
---
^ That's called 100% no sense of humor 
---
you aren't a reliable source tho....
---
It wasn't my OP
---
Yeah, it's one of those things were you'd think someone wouldn't stoop to that level of douche - but my 20+ years on the internet has taught me otherwise. 
---
WTB 3 star ali baba sword
---
I agree that it's obscene that you would get banned for that. You're not participating in the exploit and just happened to come across it.   
---
Why would anyone just walk past free stuff in a grind based online game? I would have done the same and picked it all up. 
---
Yeah, I get why people use mules to get around the storage limits. I have one, but I gave up on wasting my friends' time to transferring to/from the mule. So, I've learned to live with the limits. We'll see how the stash weight bump to 800 goes today as far as reducing my need to have to carry junk as a crafter. Thanks for the conversation!
---
Oh look still no perk reset for forcing everyone to only use melee in power armor. 
---
225k ultracite ammo? Why would you need all that? That's gonna be enough for at least 2 months. That's suspiciously close to 255k.
---
When you spawn on this location turn right 90 degrees and look on the road - there are various ecnounters you can find - dropped vertibird, broken tank, dropped satelite, deathclaw nest etc. One of them can be a dead body of trick-or-treater guy who can wear various outfits - halloween skeleton, halloween witch etc. Sometimes he also carries correspondence plan for those outfits.
---
To all the cheaters:
---
If you like the game, just repurchase it and don't cheat this time. Problem solved.
---
Too true OP, too true!
---
I'm still waiting for them to keep PvP within the workshop confines and stop the exploit to initiate PvP and go hunt people elsewhere on the map instead of taking over the workshop.
---
for DR, a full vanguard combat armor set is equal, just keep your health up. Problem is radiation, nothing besides hazmat is on par with PA for rad resistance.
---
Snitchs get stitches. 
---
You posted dupe videos from before the dupe exploits were patched and two glitch compilations made using those old videos, by people who stand to make money by showing such hate videos. Bravo!
---
I'm not even saying that he's not guilty. I'm simply saying you're putting entirely too much trust into this system of theirs if you think they're infallible. And a lot of this shit is automatic, and automatic systems are pretty crappy sometimes (see: YouTube).
---
lmao I feel less safe in my PA than i do with regular armor. 
---
I have no opinion, but I think that any mulling may be a violation: it is an exploit, it is just the amount that got it flagged in this case. 
---
I do agree that it is a silly way to get your account suspended.
---
stealth move speed maxes at 3 pieces AFAIK. Get an unyielding set and you can have 30 agility which makes you move faster improves stealth further. You'll be invisible to anything but mole rats and rad scorpions
---
The email doesn't say he has that much ammo just that that much has traded hands through his character. Trading his ammo over to a mule and back by bethesdas coding would then double the "ammo" he has had. So if you have mules and trade ammo to them to hold and then trade it back when you need it you could easilly get over 100k ammo in a 30 day period without actually having anywhere near 100k ammo.
---
I seriously think you should also buff ballistic rifles / pistols. Heavy weapons are much more powerful than those since the latest patch.
---
Yes, a completely modified TS shotgun is less accurate than a regular unmodified shotgun by a huge margin.  The completely modified TS shotgun with skeet shooter is still incredibly inaccurate let alone when compared to a regular shotgun.
---
When you spawn on this location turn right 90 degrees and look on the road - there are various ecnounters you can find - dropped vertibird, broken tank, dropped satelite, deathclaw nest etc. One of them can be a dead body of trick-or-treater guy who can wear various outfits - halloween skeleton, halloween witch etc. Sometimes he also carries correspondence plan for those outfits
---
Lol what?
---
If you're going to do that then you should also remove this thread **where people are actually witchhunting him**.
---
I'm having trouble finding a way to interpret removing his post as anything but a mod deciding "this guy is a duper and doesn't deserve to defend himself".
---
This. Thank you. 
---
I have fire proof, iron clad and barbarian all maxed as well as lone wanderer. With full BOS armor at level 50 and 3 assasins pieces, my damage resist is as high as my x01 armor. My build is sneak but I have little trouble with most PVE things in the game. PvP is fun with this build as well.
---
Yes- The fusion generator is a specific one as well.
---
You do realize that this sub is a minor minority? And the game still has a lot of players?
---
right ur "friend"
---
So, unless people post exclusively positive posts, they should be banned from the sub? 
---
That is stupid. 
---
By your own metric, you would be blocked too, for this post. 
---
Yeah and I don't see players going to a random camp and doing an orbital strike. That never happens...
---
You only like brass instruments? I get not liking clarinets but you left out flutes and saxophones! I’d love a saxophone man.
---
Ahh.. that was the random one I was also trying to think of. 
---
I’ve been playing since day one and have not been banned!
---
Here is the secret!!
---
I didn’t dupe or cheat or pick up 100k of anything.
---
I am still enjoying the game and plan to enjoy its forums.
---
You on the other hand are here for what?
---
Sympathy?
---
Backing?
---
Beat it, you played like an idiot and won an idiots prize.
---
&gt;Neutral players display a pale-yellow icon, Allies display gold, and Hostile and Wanted display red.
---
Neutral players are pale yellow. Allies are *another* shade of yellow. And Hostile/Wanted are red - which often appears as a shade of yellow or grey to people with red/green colorblindness, which is the most common form of colorblindness. That seems... helpful. :-/
---
If a vendor doesn’t have caps it means it hasn’t been enough time since last time you’ve been there so unless you’re playing for 20 hours straight the vendor isn’t going to have any more caps. 
---
You basically wait a day (20 hours is what I’m reading in another post) and the vendor will have 200 more caps. 
---
Yes. I am melee with mostly Vanguard BOS combat armor and one Vanguard Sentinel leather piece. I only put on power armor for nuke zones.
---
I do have an instigating deathclaw gauntlet and I do my best to get my strikes in first. You can take a few hits.
---
It's viable.
---
Not sure *how* viable, but some non-PA armor pieces have pretty nice stats, so I'm sure you can make it work.
---
I'm not a PA user, and I've done SBQ runs with just a hazmat suit on, and while it's a bit dicey, it's doable.  I'm not heavily speced into stealth (I think 1 star stealth card), and even though stealth is a bit broken, I'm still fine out there.
---
No I understand that people deserve to be punished, I just don't get what else they can do it the "future update" it says in the ban notices people posted on here.
---
no.
---
Bethesda general customer service said they couldn't do anything.
---
everyone took that to mean the developers couldn't do anything, either. 
---
Watch it's gonna be something random like the witches hat/costume.
---
Ah, so Bleached Dogwood doesn't need to autoscrap from stash because, like hardened mass or beer bottles or even mods, they're only used in crafting in unscrapped form. Whereas bulked scrap is only used in crafting in the scrapped form, so has different functionality? So the autoscrap all button and the 'autoscrap 1 when recipe needs item' functions are too intertwined to separate without additional work?
---
 Gotcha, cheers
---
I have exactly 2727 hours into FFXIV. I know people in my Free Company with far more.
---
My stealth works with escape artist.  I creep into white Springs and jump up into the hole in the ceiling and shoot the ghouls with my silencer before they stand up with. I have no sneak perks besides escape artist. 
---
Amen!
---
Is the team aware that the pump action shotgun’s sights are off alignment in two ways (possibly a single glitch)?  The first being the front sight of the gun doesnt properly settle in the middle of the rear sight ring, and the second issue being that the while aiming down sights the point of impact is actually the highest point of the rear sight ring, not on the front sight. 
---
It supposedly helps sneak by a small amount that stacks.
---
Don't worry bro, Hillary's under investigation for selling US uranium rights to Uranium One, a Russian company, karma's a bitch.
---
Well with certain perks, ammo weighs next to nothing. So its not unreasonable to hold TONNES of ammo.
---
10 points to Slytherin 
---
You obviously did not read the post..
---
whats the base dmg on that?
---
If that's your argument, then you are worse than a trump supporter, and I did not know there was such a thing.
---
you need all non-PA DResistance perks (Barbarian, Evasive, etc.) and DReduction ones (Lone Wanderer, Dodgy). it works with either marine or BoS combat.
---
regular armor is actually a lot better *if* you can find sentinel pieces.
---
Yep.  I run a non-PA, non-stealth melee build and it's great.  You'll have to look up various build examples floating around, but once you have all the perks set up it's extremely low maintenance and low effort -- I basically stand around behind trees or walls and murder enemies as they run up.  Crap like spring hunting, ammo crafting, all of that is utterly foreign to me.  I repair my weapon and armor maybe once every 3 days.  If you play in 3rd person with the camera pulled way back nothing can even sneak up on you.  For PVE I recommend Vanguard pieces but there are many viable options.
---
It was mined a few patches back. It's purple. [https://imgur.com/a/0Iepb2O](https://imgur.com/a/0Iepb2O) 
---
Mules aren't against the TOS. This one, anyway.
---
How am I exploiting the legendary drop system? and you have no idea how I played Skyrim oblivion and fallout 3-76 lol I just don’t understand why people are so mad. Yes duper’s messed up the game but instead of being a little baby about it go make the best of it
---
yeah but at this rate it's no exaggeration to say 1% of the total players would have access to the good stuff.
---
I second this. The queen dropped me a drill the other day in place of a legendary
---
Of course it would be reduced today because I just decided to build a set last night..... LOL.
---
Its a game lol for one to be so upset by it is childish. Im more then ok woth people duping go for it past fallout has always supported player modding. So get your head out bethesdas ass and let people be people and play the game. Guess what if you didnt have to see other players in their gear or killing people or having somthing you didnt you wouldnt be complaing and or even know about half of it.  And would probably be ok with it lol. Because of all this crying they removed player trading good weapons and fucked up my weapons and armor which are now consistently broken. If people would have only just played the game and kept their mouths shut we would probably be in a better place. 
---
Are we counting PvP as coop rather than competitive now? 
---
Sure a lot of things can be solved if Bethesda released dedicated servers but they haven't, that doesn't give you a free pass to do whatever you like and is probably the worst attempt at justifying cheating I have ever seen.
---
It's worth noting that none of this cheating would be a problem if people didn't cheat, but they do.
---
Good riddance to him.  Cheaters gotta cheat, that's their behavior.  I'm happy to never have to worry about running into them in game.
---
&gt; oh look more 10mm ammo let me grab that cause its rare
---
And yet, my Perfect Storm will gladly burn (cheap bonus pun intended) through whatever 10mm ammo I manage to pick up in seconds, so leave them for me, mmkay? ;-)
---
Mine too.  \^\_\^ 
---
Can i haz more content other than scorchbeast plz thanks.
---
working on +rad resistance, radsponge duo builds, but havent tested yet.  trying to find a way around PA/hazmat suit in blast zones.
---
I just wish they cut the refresh time in half. Most of the time I play when I get home from work at night. When Im off the  next day I have to wait until night again in order to off load stuff at vendors. During that time Im constantly weighing what i need to keep vs get rid of in terms of weight to caps. This new stash increase will help me alot though so I can store stuff I want to sell later. 
---
&gt;Controls: Pressing the Quick Swap key (Default: Left D-pad) after the current weapon breaks now correctly swaps to an alternate weapon.
---
No one is talking about this. Was I the only person who absolutely hated this? This was so annoying to me as a melee user who would have guns and melee at the swap or two melees at the swap and in nuke zones or getting swarmed by enemies my weapon would break. I'm not constantly paying attention to the health bar of it when the SBQ is on my ass. When I'm literally right up under the SBQ and my weapon breaks and I have to go into the pip-boy and select my other swapped melee or gun to use now, that was really annoying and stupid. It took time and since the game doesn't pause I was getting damage during it.

You think?  It's be a lot more entertaining to watch it actually go down than you tell us about it.
---
Beautiful... do you know also the price? 
---
This is messed up, Bethesda is punishing someone who put this many hours into a game that most people never gave the light of day. Just shows how Bethesda will be treating their day ones 😢 hope you get your account back, and hope Bethesda apologizes for screwing you over for enjoying their unsuccessful game. Bethesda is giving me low expectations for ES6, honestly might not get it day one like I was going to after reading this. I've read so many accounts of players being wrongfully banned and it's just sad. Much love!
---
Balance patches should be your top priority. This is not an improvement scenario. My Gatling Plasma with full Weapon Artisan Repaired breaks in 2 Plasma cores..  
---
Got a few one star two shots, one executioner explosive smg! And one nocturnal explosive way back in the day that of course I lost in a bag...

I’m in the “this is my admission category”.    
---
If you trade it’s gonna happen.  Last trade I did before the dupe kill ,  the guy ended up giving me a whole bunch of stuff..   I refused most of it, and took no more than a copy of anything. (Though I wish I could’ve gotten two dozen nuka grapes,  I just didn’t know about nuka grape!!!) 
---
Or the people that after all these years still can't figure out that VAC bans are not instant. It takes something like 2 weeks from the time you get caught to the time the ban hits. They do this to try to keep the cheat makers/sellers constantly behind the times.

No tuba?

$350 is a sale for the Xbone? Damn, isn't that console an antique now? 
---
Have any issues with the Distant Thunder event been mentioned? I've done this event a number of times, and always end up with either no plan, or the same plan every time.  Is this an issue similar to the patch 6 SBQ drop fix?
---
I only mentioned the pipe rifle because you and the rest of your demographic expend all your energy waving your pipe rifles at anyone doing better than you loot wise and automatically call them a duper/exploiter 
---
caveat: a team that has no way to escalate further does not want to hear you bitch piss and moan about something they cannot do.  If an agent tells you politely that there's nothing else they can do to help, 99% of the time that's completely true.  the other 1% are nubs who don't know all the ins and outs yet.
---
customer support is shitty. don't make it worse for people by being a dick.
---
Yeah I’m finding that every time it’s super mutants there’s one three star up there, sometimes a bonus one star. It’s faster to just server hop that same location over and over than to do anything else so I just constantly do that.
---
Are you going to stop updating the Nukacrypt site?
---
GL, radsponge helps some but i've also tried lead lined mod and some pieces with +rad resist. nuke zone are rough out of PA/hazmat suit.

Your a fool for thinking that way ill troll you with a lvl 30 in a pa chassis . besides how many times have you traded somthing to another player? It isnt hard to get good loot and just because you cant show up to a trade with good gear doesnt mean we should pay the price because your too broke of a player to buy good gear off another player
---
Still no word on the BoS Combat/Deep Pocketed Combat Armor recipes missing from vendors, am happy about the increase in storage though.
---
I find it ironic that a game where we are encouraged to hack consoles, pick locks, murder people, and nuke whole cities, that its looked down upon when people actually “hack” 76 (dupe), “lockpick” 76 (dev room), “nuke whole servers” (toxic duping), and generally cause mayhem. Isn’t that “part of the game”?  And if it wasn’t, would Bethesda really have allowed that in game?  Yes, they messed up, but all of these things we hate were in the game!
---
I feel the vitriol from people here is vastly misplaced. Yes, these things are a detriment to Bethesda’s vision of 76, but have a bit of perspective please. 
---
yeah, it happens a lot, game should honestly still be in BETA or early access and should not cost $60
---
this comment deserves a reward
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
No update on the "LOOKUP FAILED" bug? What about an update on the still broken since beta Daily: Heart of the Enemy quest?
---
After recently returning myself there are still many bugs but it's much more playable now. I haven't had any lost items or perk cards during this play through yet and the NPC'S no longer glitch around like they're tied to an invisible crucifix!
---
Ammo should unlock in the tinker bench once you have the prime receiver.  
---
Um duh ...... oh yeah to remove cheaters
---
Yeah, this whole thing is getting ridiculous. The way they are treating this guy is insane. They have already made up their minds he is a duper even though pretty much all the evidence points to him just being someone who was minmaxing in the game and was good at farming or trading.
---
They are making up any excuse they can from, "oh no one plays that much", or "well he had 640k ultracite ammo" even though the email doesn't say that at all, it says in a 30 day span over 100k ammo went through his main account. Like that is some crazy number, yet they don't realize how bethesda is counting the ammo. If the dude has 25k ammo he mules to his mule, then later gets that 25k ammo off his mule and puts it back on his main, in bethesdas eyes he has had 50k ammo. Bethesda is counting the ammo multiple times for every time it is added to his inventory. 
---
So drop the ammo for a few seconds to do some stash cleaning and pick it back up, then in bethesdas thinking that ammo now goes against your 100k limit twice. Which is absolutely ridiculous.
---
glad to see that we're on our way out of Beta :-)
---
I had a question about how C.A.M.P. defenses will interact when players "hit" another one another's bases (intentional or not).
---
Now, I play with Pacifist on, so I've never become wanted by accidentally hitting a structure. (I once got a bounty by breaking into someone's C.A.M.P. by mistake - it was placed so well I thought it was a in-game structure). 
---
My point is, I've never attacked a base so I'm not sure how the turrets/defenses react. Currently, if you damage a wall (even by mistake) would the players defenses attack back? I guess if this is the case, it will not be the case in the next patch. 
---
So, if you wanted to eliminate someone's base, tactically you could reduce all the defenses to near zero and then take them out one shot at a time. You would then become wanted, but you could easily level a base because you've ensured the defenses will be destroyed instantaneously. 
---
Same. Havent logged for over a week. This game is a disgrace, pretty much killed the franchise. Reviewers said this, customers said this as well, sales were abysmall and most players quit already. Thing is they did us a favor, we dont risk logging in for mistake now. Two of my friends are still upset about me comvincing them into buying the game, at least one managed to get a refund.
---
The first thing I wondered is what this means for defending *other* people's workshops.
---
I'm bored, I see a defend workshop event and the owner on the other side of the map.  Why not?  It's a good way to rack up some XP, fight some interesting hoards, and help someone out.  Now, it seems like their immediate suspicion would be "Oh great, you've come to take my workshop."
---
I assume there's almost nothing else in the dev cells but huge heaps of empty vodka bottles.
---
You unlock the ammo recipe when you unlock the receiver, or get a weapon that uses it. It should be under Ultracite Ammo in your tinker's bench. 
---
They wiped out high quantities of duped items but as I understand it they haven't actually fixed duping. It seems to me like a lot of the suspensions/"bans" are to get the exploiters out of the game until the dupe exploits can be fixed. Some of the "ban" emails even say this, that they're just being suspended until the exploit is fixed. Not saying I agree or disagree with it--that's just what I've gathered from what I've seen on here.
---
My point exactly lol. It seems like muscle fluxing with OP gear. Players love to take their builds to the test, but hate to see it fail, esp. on another strong build. I see this happen alot. 
---
And if you find a bag of money on the street and pick it up and then throw it away you're still going to jail? Sounds reasonable. Not.
---
You should buy a key for a PC game from a RETAILER, and not from a RESELLER. That way, you can actually keep on playing without getting banned.
---
RETAILER = legitimate store. The keys are directly received from the publisher, the store is allowed to sell the game to you. There's zero chance of getting your key banned.
---
RESELLER = illegitimate store. The keys are RESOLD, which is illegitimate. I strongly recommend to not buy from a reseller.
---
The PvP in this game is already known to be awful. 
---
I do not cheat, nor do I condone it, but for this sort of game I do not see anything wrong with it. 
---
&gt;It's worth noting that none of this cheating would be a problem if people didn't cheat, but they do.
---
Absolutely useless tatement. "The bad reviews for this game wouldn't be a problem if people didn't want good games, but they do"
---
Bethesda make a conscious choice to not release this game with dedicated servers, and now they are facing the consequences. 
---
That extra 200 pounds in the stash is going to come in very, very handy!
---
Would love to see BoS armor plans and mods reintroduced into the Vendor inventories.  Same for Marine Armor mods.  
---
Xbox one (X) you ditz 
---
Actually, you are saying that. Your whole statement was just that. The email they sent him as to why he was banned proved what they said and to why he was banned. There is no way he could have accumulated 645.654k worth of ammo in one month just gathering up materials and crafting I mean the ultracite which is rarer than most ammo would take an abundance of time-consuming stuff to gather and he had around 333.071 k worth of just ultracite. A dude did just a rough estimate on just the ultricite -
---
 "Assuming a middle of the road yield ammo like 5.56's at 20 a pop even after factoring in Ammosmith and Super Duper I think that's still like 7000 crafts. I've done the math further and it doesn't get any less insane from there when you factor in the required Flux and Ultracite Scrap needed for each of those 7000 ammo crafts. The Flux itself requires gathering a Hardened Mass/Glowing Mass/High Radiation Fluids and 10 flux each... forgetting how long it would take to get that many nuke zone drops if it's even possible I think even with Green Thumb the flux alone would still require 27000 harvests which again I'm not even sure would be possible in the first place. And that's not even factoring in the ultracite scrap you also need, which itself would require so much ore and acid." 
---
That is just the ultracite not even including all the other ammo he had. in total both accounts had 645.654 total ammo for just 1 month of gathering and crafting. 
---
As I said, perfectly doable if you frequently buy Flux from shops. The fact that someone would be duping ammo is also weird honestly, it's really not that required by anyone. 
---
Probably because they still want Bulk junk to scrap automatically when it is needed for crafting and the tag would prevent that. 
---
Yeah, super muties always spawn in a three star, ghouls sometimes do, and scorched never have yet. But usually they’ve got something for me. Obviously there’s a fair amount of legendary trapper pieces, but since my investment is only two minutes, I don’t feel cheated by the game like I do everywhere else
---
Why?
---
You get receivers on schematics in Charleston fire station on a terminal 
---
&gt; The amount of springs required to craft and repair level 25, 35, and 45 Excavator Power Armor Legs has been significantly reduced.
---
Looks like I made the right decision to not upgrade my legs yesterday.
---
That makes sense since the ovens would all either run off natural gas or electricity, of which there is almost none. I would like to cook on the BBQ pits at the parks though 
---
&gt; sale for the Xbone? Damn, isn't that console an a
---
Xbox One X\*  Not sure if 13 months constitutes an antique, but...
---
Thanks bro I’ll double check when it’s back online. I could see 5.56 and 2mm prime ammo on the menu but not shotgun shells 
---
Yes and with the limited amount of resources that a workshop gives we'd have to spend our own to put defenses all around the area now. Originally when they introduced the workshops they implied that it was a 'team thing' so I wonder if they are trying to encourage people to team up and take over workshops now more than ever. This is about the last straw for me. They keep nerfing things that made the game cool. I wonder what will be next.
---
you need the plan from the queen. But if you can mod the shotgun prime receiver onto your gun, you already know how make the prime ammo for it. You just need mats, and lot of stable flux. if not you are sueriously bugged. prime only increases damage vs  scorchbeast. You can also un-prime your gun, just change the reciever to something else. 
---
You clearly did not read the whole post.
---
OH. 
---
I guess that's not as bad. 
---
&gt; As we work on world servers that have been running for a long time and hitting some lag issues, we’ll be performing maintenance on those servers more frequently.
---
Kind of amazed they stay up long enough for this to be a problem.
---
Impressive !
---
you shouldnt feel guilty if you got a duped item
---
So if the drop rate is that rare on TSE’s Bethesda has to know this amount. So how can there be that many for sale all the time by just one player let alone dozens? 
---
If they’re duplicated how are they still playing? 
---
Hello now's what he did. "I sent it between accounts twice" but totals over 200k.  My math could be wrong but... 6k x 3 ≠ 200k 😂😂
---
Because they *want* the bulk items to autoscrap during crafting, but *not* during mass autoscrapping. Bleached Dogwood and Hardened Mass are being protected from autoscrap during crafting, which is exactly what they *don't* want to happen with the bulk items.
---
Mule account! Trust me, it makes the game at least 50% better. 
---
&gt;- **Budget:** Tamed creatures no longer permanently consume C.A.M.P. budget after they are killed. 
---
Holy crap, thank you. Does this also retroactively fix players budgets who were already affected? 
---
OK so its duping they are trying to fix, that's what I didn't understand
---
Hi! you must be new here, nice to meet you. Sadly this has been happening since day one. Luckily they spared you from getting another 3☆ rolling pin. It shows Bethesda cares. Your welcome
---
So discriminant of the mini gun :'(
---
The noteworthy diffrent betwen prime and regular ammo is prime ammo does bonus damage to scorched, but costs Flux to make. Plans to make ammo are unlocked with plans to make the guns use prime ammo. Prime guns should probly not be used for general purpose but held for Scorched/Scorchbeats/SBQ. Flux costs will get expensive fast.
---
Maybe.    
---
However, I actually rather enjoyed the fact that I had to remain alert at all times and ready to flee if a scorchbeast found me.  I think it really added tension to my game experience and when I was finally powerful enough to kill one, I felt triumphant.    
---
It seems to me that experience is probably working as designed.
---
&gt;It is better that ten guilty escape than one innocent suffer.
---
&gt;-William Blackstone
---
That is the ideal all modern laws and regulations fall under, it is a far greater injustice to cause suffering to an innocent person just on the off chance you also will take out some bad people.
---
But yeah that's kind of the point. If you go to take over an owned workshop, it's supposed to be a battle between you and the owner, not make you wanted and then it becomes a battle between you and whoever on the server wants to kill you.
---
Plus I think it can make it more fun to contest things. A few weeks back, I had the munitions factory. Some guy broke in and stole it from me, so I thought it would be fun to engage and take it back. By the time I got there, two others had also arrived for the bounty. The problem was, he had barricaded himself in that downstairs part (where the fusion generator is) and locked the door. So we couldn't get to him without picking the lock and also becoming wanted ourselves. And to add on to that, he had a window straight to the main workshop bench. So anytime we attempted to sit in the circle and wait to reclaim the workshop, he would simply jump up and one shot us through the window.
---
lmaooooo
---
This, please!
---
Being in stealth with increased crit damage and silenced weapon damage, will hit an enemy, take a huge chunk of damage out, then they get all that hp back and only 1/10th of the damage actually registers. Been broken since launch.
---
I found that the civil war suit was even better as a money maker, 3 cloth + 1 gold and 100 caps base value. Cloth is common and gold is not that rare either. Was doing the Marine helmet for a while until rubber ran low. 
---
Wall pass through connectors, potted plants. 
---
What about getting stuck in a workbench when exiting, it puts me right back into it and I have to exit the work bench 4 or 5 times before I actually leave. 
---
A lot of two shot.... only 3 explo since the release. 
---
Lv 171 rigotte now 
---
Well it seems like it is on purpose, as textures normally should not contain code.
---
"900 hour guy" is the meme of the week: [https://imgur.com/a/QO6SVPc](https://imgur.com/a/QO6SVPc) 
---
Maybe as random Treasure Map loot? I've never seen vendors sell it.
---
You can still go get Nuka Grapes, they are in Whitesprings, upstairs at a Nuka vendor!
---
This ment to be posted as a comment to a kid complaing about duppers on this thread lol dont know how it got to the top
---
Agreed, not a fan of this one!
---
I am 100% in favour of banning players if they are too incompetent to understand that violating terms that they explicitly agreed to can result in a ban.
---
I frequently build Level 5 Armor &amp; Brotherhood Recon Rifles, then drop them for new players at the Overseers CAMP, along with Ammo, Water, Food, &amp; Stimpaks, and if they have a MIC I teach them to make Healing Salve.
---
Some players can't understand why you are helping them out so much, but my hope is that they will pay it forward, and engage in more cooperative game play, and to show them early on that not every player they meet is out to cause them grief.
---
The move speed continues stacking 9n the effects tab.
---
According to the effects tab, 4 pieces gives +80 speed, 5 pieces gives +125.
---
Seems like normal running is 150% stealth move speed.
---
&gt;Your a fool for thinking that way ill troll you with a lvl 30 in a pa chassis
---
I find that hard to believe unless you're exploiting. I'm a sentinel/cavalier myself.
---
&gt;besides how many times have you traded somthing to another player? It isnt hard to get good loot
---
that's precisely my point. most people with "good gear" as you put it either duped or got it from dupers. if it wasn't for dupers, good gear wouldn't be so widespread. both parties would have nothing to offer but crappy 1\*s.
---
but don't take my word for it, check the market. people were offloading tses even before the nerf because of how common they were. try offering your PA chassis for a sentinel set and see where that gets you. I find hard to believe you qualify for meta trades.
---
If you believe even 20% of these people finding duper loot bags threw the stuff away, you're dumber than I thought...
---
If I may piggy-back off your post, here's an [album of some of my pics.](https://imgur.com/a/qnkAWNu)
---
Thanks bro yes I think I got the prime shotgun schematics from the queen thus I was able to prime the receiver. But when I went to tinkerbench the prime shotgun shells weren’t on the menu. I’ll double check. 
---
&gt; Actually, you are saying that.
---
Gonna stop reading here then since you clearly aren't reading what I'm saying.
---
Scraping asaultron head. That fusion cells eating bullshit
---
If you’re able to make it literally impenetrable with foundations surrounding it, then there’s a problem. The entire point of the workshops is that you should be able to structurally defend them, but not make them absolutely impossible to take. 
---
Truthfully it’s a problem with the build system, foundations were never meant to be used like that but since you can stack them, you can block people off. Stacking them isn’t as simple as just building one on top of the other either, it requires some weird fuckery with how the build system works. 
---
i thought i learned this by scrapping the heads? or maybe not. can't remember. 
---
Are you on xbox? If so I’ll help you get rid of empath 
---
I love it 😜😜😜
---
One Explosive in the last 295 drops tracked. You have \~1:4 chance to get a ranged weapon, 1:10 to get a 2\* or 3\* item and 1:7 chance to get the explosive effect: 1:2800 chance on average. You have 1:23 chance to get the Two-shot effect in theory, but I got it as 1:30 chance -&gt; 1:64,400 and 1:84,000 chances respectively.
---
Ya but also you have to take account of the other ammo he also crafted too all in that 1 month period. 
---
Theyre lying. I craft ridiculous amounts of ammo and sell it. I also don't get over 5k before I sell and I don't have a mule. If you do things reasonably you won't get flagged. If I was trying to sell 20k at a time than flags will start popping.
---
They were saying they are looking at the ammo durability, damage and all of the that and it will probably come out next update
---
You sneaky bastard you, 
---
Look at all these ppl thinking you're a saint while we are simple raiders hahahah
---
telesto user found!
---
lol j/k
---
Ah, the 2.1k was just amount of hours in 3 months :l
---
No, but I laughed when the idiots in my classes got busted for cheating and complained about the consequences.
---
Living in your parents basement and still being a virgin probably takes a toll after awhile.
---
For me it's also occurring with the fireplace I got from the Atomic Shop.
---
I didn't realize your question was rhetorical. My bad. The only way they will reinstate accounts will be when all duping methods are fixed. Per the ban emails. So yeah everyone who was banned is screwed.
---
I'm waiting for the essay on how to play the game.
---
Nah, they're more of an end game creature. It makes it more fun if you have to run from them at the lower levels and way more satisfying when you finally take one down. They're supposed to be a big scary monster. 
---
My wildest dreams have come true! I am a bot!
---
I just don’t think sentinel armor is as great as everyone makes it out to be.  They are still killable.
---
Your the type of girl that bangs tons of guys and thens about to have sex with a new and says this is my first time
---
I never said stable flux decays, but the materials required to build that stable flux do decay (plants farmed in nuke zones). He stated he was on PC already and turns the settings all the way down then runs a secondary program.
---
Ammo weight builds up very fast especially when you are not wearing power armor, it's also an advantage to offload that weight and the perks to have a build actually designed for damage over utility. 
---
He posted the picture of what he was banned for and asked them to send what he has currently in inventory because he has not had near that much ammo and also feels it's something that was flagged due to him moving it.
---
Either way, it's an issue that shouldnt exist, when they say rare items, ammo shouldnt be included at the same numbers as items such as nuka cola to ban someone....period.
---
Could be I have never seen it either 
---
It's just not a logical change to foist upon us. There is nothing wrong with being able to build a box around the workshop and make it tougher for someone to claim it from you. They can still go in and destroy the barriers if they want the workshop bad enough, and at that point they will get the fight they have coming to them. This opens the door to griefing as you can have people camp out in some obscure spot in the workshop territory and keep you from operating it as intended while leaving you in an ambiguous state of PVP.
---
I'm willing to cut Bethesda some slack on changes they feel are in the game's best interest, but THIS is not one of those changes. Clean up workshops first. How about making it so the resource collectors produce the advertised amount of resources or don't bug out and make you enter the inventory to collect their product? How about making it so the 4 waves of mangy wolves that spawn in for the defend event actually spawn in and don't run two miles outside of the event boundary when they do? 
---
done\^\^
---
You'd have been better off adding a threshold to the number of hits  + raw damage camp structures could take before giving the wanted status to the player.
---
Like 7 hits and you're done. Wanted ! 
---
Because this WILL be abused, you gotta know it. (to a point it could even be the cause of another hotfix)
---
You can easily just put on the best armor you can find and it will carry you easily through 95% of what the game challenges you with and keep the PA stored on you for nuke zones....that's what I do ...10lbs carrying weight for PA and 2 fusion cores  
---
Oh gosh, it's just so shocking to find out people banned might have been banned legitimately.  You know, because Bethesda can actually see their account, inventory, etc and we can't and the banned people might have \*gasp\* lied to us.
---
What you on about?  
---
When I replied to this comment it only mentioned drills and chainsaws, which are less than useless, especially so at end game 
---
If you have another Live account on that Xbox you can. Ban would be for individual account not the console itself.
---
Cheers I will try that when I am on next  
---
Try a rudimentary test throwing 3 pieces on one player and 5 pieces on another with the same agility. You'll find what I found. There's a cap on move speed just like there's a cap on walking speed with max agility, speed demon, strange in numbers, and squad maneuvers. There's also a cap on sprint speed.
---
Yep, good call, shooting an enemy past 20 yards with buckshot is not realistic at all.  If you could toggle slugs, would be another story.  
---
There have been others who have posted the list Bethesda sent them, not just this guy. 
---
&gt;  My wife stores all the teddy bears and toys she finds on a “mule
---
For what? 
---
If she doesn't need them  for cloth, screws, plastic, etc. then why keep them at all? There's simply  no reason to. None.  The fact that she's doing it at all means there's something going on that you aren't bothering to tell.
---
Still hundred bucks more than the competitor PS4 Pro is like 299$ regularly.
---
You caught me
---
This is awesome!
---
Yeh I think I was scrapping the wrong head not the gun version 
---
Yea they are heavy too, it’s 1 pound per stable flux so I had to create a mule just to be able to carry the fluxes I farmed lol. Since I mainly use Gatlings for queen fights maybe I’ll just switch the shotgun receiver back to normal 😂 
---
They've started giving them a super sledge to the head, that's for sure.  
---
I replied before you edited it my dude, I was talking about drills and chainsaws
---
thx, where do i get that  Sentinel or Cavalier  armor?
---
Banned
---
True. How about this though? Prove Bethesda didn’t ban any innocent players. Obviously Bethesda cannot be source because of conflicts of interest. 
---
unless you're exploiting, no they're not. I should know. sure you can stagger then, but that's why some people mix and match cavalier.
---
Lol i have all the sentinel gear you can ask for with or without it theres ways to make a player so op you cant kill em. Oh hmm medic pump for example or emergency protocols? Sentinel and unyeilding modding for power armor. Does that ring a bell. And besides who cares if its dupped of someone rolled up dropped a full set in front of you. Bet you 5 bucks the greed woupd set in and you would take it therefore making you a hypocrite along with 3/4 of the people complaing
---
Aside collecting armour sets for a different paystyle, I don’t understand how people have so much difficulty tossing out trash items they will never use.
---
LOL, it's funny you mention a mule account, since originally that's what I was going to do with it, but I think I'm probably going to be busy with several other games for the next few months.
---
But just out curiosity, how does it make the game better other than being able to store more stuff?
---
There is still no proof the 900 hour guy duped. Do you even realize how they are counting that ammo? That isn't the total ammo he has on the char, that is the amount of ammo that has gone into his inventory in a 30 day span. The fact the dude has mules and he mules ammo over would cause that number to look extremely inflated.
---
Look at it like this, say you have 25k ammo and you are trying to clean your stash and you drop the ammo on the ground in your camp for a couple minutes to clear your stash out some and then pick it back up, that ammo now counts TWICE towards the 100k cap. Likewise if you take that ammo and mule it off to a mule and then trade it back to your main account later that ammo ALSO counts twice toward that cap, and if you are counting the ammo from both the mule and the main account then that ammo could actually be counting more than twice towards the cap. 
---
Like say you got 25k ammo so you mule it to your mule now the mule also has 25k ammo in bethesdas eyes, and then you mule it back to your main account now your main account is seen as 50k ammo and the mule is seen as 25k ammo, so in bethesdas eyes and that email 25k ammo is being shown as 75k. Even though it is actually only 25k.
---
That is what they did in the past but then you couldn't craft from the bulk.  Sounds like they need a new category that covers bulk items to break down during crafting but not scrapping.
---
She thinks they are cute and has hopes to display them in her camp someday
---
Man the more and more that I see post like this the better I feel about deleting the game last month and taking a break from it... The idea was to come back in like 3 months and see how the game was doing hoping it will be in an ideal condition but the more and more I see posts and updates it just seems like my favorite game of all time it's going to go to s*** with one game I hope they get their heads out of their ass and actually fix this game cuz this is just getting ridiculous
---
Damage was done, but the game is salvageable.  Sounds like some new content coming and interesting developments on the way.
---
its down for patch. 
---
Whether PvP is good or not doesnt suddenly make it competitive or non-competitive.
---
My "Useless" statement was made to show you how useless yours was so now you understand why there was no need for you to ever mention it.
---
Using dedicated servers as an excuse for people to cheat is just pathetic. This problem is not here because there are no dedicated servers, it's because Bethesda are slow to patch bugs and glitches out.
---
Any official word on trophies/achievements not popping for some people?  
---
I still don’t have the trophy for reaching level 100, and I never see this being talked about.
---
So is this the Kobain Special?
---
3* Bloodied Butthurt 
---
Okay, lets say you farmed ammo 700 (probably much less as nobody would play 700h for ammo) out of the 900 hours. You would have to get 300 ultracite ammo per hour. Considering the low drop rates of this ammo type and the high price you'd have to buy it at makes this sound kinda unrealistic. Don't want to accuse you of something but you probably didn't farm ammo and spend all your money on it. You wouldn't need 200k of ultracite to play normally and it would be almost impossible to get such huge amounts. Sorry to say, but I think that Bethesda didn't do anything wrong here. 
---
What would modding a radiun rifle cost? I have an awesome one that id love to mod but only know like two radium mods
---
The edits have muddled it up then, thought we were talking about wood armor.
---
I know that, but I am wondering about the 4:8:2006 error. 
---
That is strange - and would obviously suck and be frustrating.  What platform do you play on?
---
I use better crits, and improved sneak attack, but not the silenced weapon perk - I wonder if it's possibly a glitch with that specific perk.
---
Alternatively there is always delete and reinstall - though this seems like a communication issue on their side - which is what I was told the general high damage bug was before it was fixed.
---
I would love to have this feature! It seems my plasma grenades take FOREVER to explode and the mobs always run away from it before I can hit anything.
---
Much like the bleached dogwood auto-scrapping fix - can this be applied to digested goo? I craft a lot of chems, and have screwed myself a few times by auto-scrapping my harvested digested goo into excess adhesive. 
---
You didn't read the email very closely did you? The email doesn't state he HAS that much ammo, just that that much ammo went through his inventory in a 30 day span. 
---
Look at it like this, say you have 25k ammo and you are trying to clean your stash and you drop the ammo on the ground in your camp for a couple minutes to clear your stash out some and then pick it back up, that ammo now counts TWICE towards the 100k cap. Likewise if you take that ammo and mule it off to a mule and then trade it back to your main account later that ammo ALSO counts twice toward that cap, and if you are counting the ammo from both the mule and the main account then that ammo could actually be counting more than twice towards the cap.
---
So how much is the stash box now?
---
Thanks I’ll check that out. The prime shotgun receiver schematic was from a sbq drop I believe. 
---
Banned. Server maintenance got different message. 
---
This is not the banned error. The banned error is 4:8:2000. Everyone should be getting the same message right now because the servers are down for maintenance.
---
I have same, was not banned yesterday.
---
check your email
---
Are you saying they’re not killable?
---
Way too many negative people?  Bite us.  You're what's wrong with the game.  You 'just wanted to play Fallout' but you didn't care about the damage done to the game with your duping.  
---
People get given things. People trade things. People pick things up. People transfer things to each other by dropping and picking up, possibly to mule accounts or characters. People trade by dropping and picking up. People doing that a lot legitimately could get 100k of certain items within a month if they played a lot, or just by chance find it somewhere. If you think there weren't a lot of people caught up in this that shouldn't be you're as dumb as I thought. Thanks for that one it was easy hehe. Anyway. In the art of war you pretend you are weak when you are strong. I'm just pretending to be dumb. Or maybe I'm pretending to be smart. Hmm you never know. Have to keep you guessing.

@Valseek Any news on a possible fix for not synching friends list? 
---
You might be able to get it by looting rank 3 safes that have weapon plans in their loot table. I know I've seen tesla plans in them and those are off robobrains (also super sledge and so on.) 
---
I got my assaultron plans for helmet and blade off assaultrons and it was not much of a grind, but was more than just several kills. There's a spawn of three assaultrons on the SW wall of watoga that I used for getting the plans... there's also a marine wetsuit  and other plan spawn in the traincar near that which contains a Submachine gun that you can hit up daily.
---
That's literally the only way it improves the game. Being able to transfer things I want to keep to my mule without needing someone else I can trust (ZERO of my friends still play this) makes my experience significantly better. 
---
I found a bunch of two shots..which I gave away all of them..only found 1 explosive gun and it was at a vendor ..just a regular explosive 
---
True, I didn't know it was something players were interested to see. I will be recording my next bounty hunts, and I will edit out the boring waiting parts. like try to keep it to the action bits.
---
Cuz I usually look for small critters to stack my crits, in between fights, esp. if it is a strong build that would require it and positioning my spot and waiting could lead to long and boring videos.  Cuz i wait patiently for my opponents and I refrain from sprinting, so I keep my stealth up at all times. Plus there are alot of monitoring the map to find where the target moves. 
---
But yeah, for the future, I will record it. But I'm not going for 1. Im gonna go for team wipes, cuz those are tense as F and very interesting.
---
&gt; **Transfer Menu:** The transfer bar now correctly stops at 1 when scrolling to reduce the transfer quantity. 
---
Thank you for this.  One small, annoying thing down.  
---
Pretty sure that Berry Mentats are a drug not a mod...
---
Go away.
---
I found a TSE Gatling Gun either right before or right after the TSE nerf
---
Oh shiat... well my fault for taking 5k 10mm ammo for free when it was offered to me lol. I usually never take free stuff in game, because it feels like something I havnt achieved, but my 10mm sub burned through my 10mm rounds so fast and when I said that I am out of ammo during the evnt a guy dropped me 5k. :/ 
---
I kill the queen with a bloodied mr handy buzz saw blade. Secretly the highest DPS weapon in the game. Don't discount auto-melee weapons
---
I'm not so sure about that, I have seen other posts discuss this matter. Here it seems like it is the amount that has triggered the action (otherwise how could you give stuff to friends/family).
---
I'm still running excavator power armor at level 67; I like the extra carry capacity. You can craft that at level 30.  
---
Like in the pain Olympics? Don't Google it.
---
What's even sadder about the whole thing are things like [this](https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/01/fallout-76-free-with-used-ps4-controllers-gamestop-germany/) and [this](https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/18/polish-retailer-gave-away-free-copies-of-fallout-76-with-ps4-thumbsticks/), lol.

I suffer all the time, with my player marker plus mini map thinking I am facing the wrong way. If I use my map or HUD to head towards a waypoint / marker I'm actually going in the opposite direction..  probably happen to me 1 in 4 times I play?

That’s it? Weak.

the idea came from Jug, genuis and simple :)
---
I have to use my phones internet, I only get 10 gigs of tehtering. so this 3.5 gig update isn't getting downloading. I have unlimited data on the phone itself tho.
---
Bethesda! Please let us download the updates on mobile! DOZENS of us exist!
---
No worries, I could've took more time reading the post and would've got it. But I should be working not checking stuff on reddit so I kind of just skimmed the post.
---
Bethesda, thank you for all these fixes. That said, please fix the issue in CAMP where some walls/foundations/stairs can no longer be removed/rotated/scrapped because it says it would leave something floating when that's just not true. I know this can be fixed by moving the CAMP, but I put a lot of time into the current location and would likely not be able to rebuild it in less than a couple of hours and would likely hit the same bug again.
---
I have stopped playing because CAMP is a big enjoyment for and I cannot make some changes anymore.
---
No...you're just an idiot acting smart...or you're on the spectrum
---
Oh god. I have already done this. I have no room.
---
The princess bed does it when placed inside the small tent. Also some taller plants will too
---
Only 3 times? It's nearly every time for me.
---
The guy is full of crap, he got banned for cheating, nobody can get that amount of Ultracite ammo legitimately. 
---
&gt;Oh hmm medic pump for example
---
I can output more damage than a medic pump/born survivor can heal.
---
&gt;or emergency protocols?
---
emergency protocols is just a worse sentinel. 25% less reduction and no assassin. besides, you said you could troll me with the frame alone.
---
&gt;Sentinel and unyeilding modding for power armor. Does that ring a bell.
---
not really because PA can't be legendary. but I think I get the gist. yes, my current "casual" build uses adrenal reaction and emergency protocols. bloodied as well. and I can tell you from experience it's nowhere near as good. not to mention rad, poison and fire are great ways to kill you.
---
&gt;And besides who cares if its dupped of someone rolled up dropped a full set in front of you. Bet you 5 bucks the greed woupd set in and you would take it therefore making you a hypocrite along with 3/4 of the people complaing
---
you're not getting my point at all. all I'm saying is that, if it wasn't for dupers, nobody would even know what a TSE, sentinel or cavalier are because of how rare they are.
---
the odds of rolling one are so astronomically low yet they are so common there's no chance the majority wasn't duped. I'm not arguing whether that's a good thing, just stating facts.
---
the info means nothing if it has no meaningful difference in move speed. I sneak-raced someone with 3 pieces with 5 pieces of my wood armor and it was dead even the whole way. I think the other stealth bonuses might stack, but you could probably do better with unyielding + harder to detect while sneaking with two ultra-light armor modded armor pieces instead of wood. The sneak speed has diminishing returns
---
4.58 GB on Xbox. That's a pretty large. Hopefully a good thing. 
---
I've seen the modern fireplace from the Atomic Shop do the same thing once or twice. 
---
Don’t worry, it’ll all be fixed when Bethesda creates the GM tools they need to be able to address the problem. You know, kind of like every other MMO does in alpha.
---
I just know I’ll run out of space at the end of the day lol. So much lovely junk, so little storage. Grog axe is awesome, I only have a bloodied one star and love it. I hope they fixed it so I can finally repair it to 200% condition 💪
---
Pretty sure they give the same effect and they both have the bug... 
---
I dont use the drug but I'd like to use the mod. The point was the effect is bugged. 
---
There's still a bug which prevents any Groknak's Axe to be repaired to above 100% with the perk equipped.
---
Yeah I noticed the ravenous nature of the board. That's just people feeding off each other playing top that outrage smh
---
Nostradamus
---
But.... it literally worked like that before a few patches ago. I have no idea why/how it got screwed up, but it used to be that bulk items would not autoscrap when you hit "scrap all junk" but WOULD autoscrap when crafting, so the ability to do that is clearly there. 
---
&gt; My theory now is that the system is able to detect when you pick something up, but not where you got it from, nor if you dropped it. It seemingly just keeps a totals tally.
---
You need to stress this part as a lot of people in the thread (including myself initially) are confused as to what you're  trying to explain, and just keep piling on the "omg 400k ammo" bandwagon, ignoring your statement that you in fact never had anywhere near that much.
---
For anyone as confused as me, what the OP is saying is (note: it's their guess, not a confirmed fact, but it does seem plausible): imagine you have 10000 of ammo. You dump it into a public container or an alt, then take it back. The system now thinks you've **"acquired"** a total of 20k ammo (although all you ever had is the original 10k). Do it 10 times, and suddenly you've "acquired" a bannable amount.
---
(Xbox Live) The quest where you have to search the Saboteurs Hideout, when you go inside the hideout it is severely glitched to where you take damage for seemingly no reason, and it constantly gives you damage again and again. While I was hacking the terminal, this effect caused me to die and while I recovered my junk, it is really irritating that I can’t search for the clues in the hideout without taking damage every time.
---
Lolz I’ll upvote if you can show how bloodied beats assassins or legendary?
---
Aw What the F*** 🤬 upvoting 
---
Good changes, but still moving at a snails pace.  It feels like much too little for how long it takes between patches, with major issues still persisting since launch.  Every few weeks, here's some minor changes.  I want to play the game, but none of this even motivates me to turn it on when I'm sure as shit going to crash after launching a nuke and stepping foot into the nuke zone, with no way to return to my previous server.
---
Me too. Except I played for ... an hour or hour and a half? Single player is still the best
---
No. Usually 3-4 hours for the ones in the past. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status

Once that site says it's clear you're good to go
---
Do flare guns even have a real purpose other than looking cool?
---
Except for the fact dupers are still out there duping to their hearts content. Go look at ebay, TSE legendary packs are still being sold left and right.
---
The only thing these bans have done is alienate even more people from the game. This ban wave has hit tons of the minmaxers while the actual dupers are still doing just fine.
---
Look at the top voted post right now in this forum, a guy who put over 900 hours into the game banned because bethesdas way of detecting "dupers" is piss poor. They end up counting ammo multiple times in their detection algorithm. The 900 hour guy got screwed because he muled ammo from his main account to his mule and then back a couple times so in bethesdas algorithm over 100k ammo went through his inventory even though it was literally the same ammo he had muled on and off the character a couple times.
---
Apparently to some 146k ultracite is not alot lol
---
&gt; Recipes and Plans: Fixed an issue that could prevent a player from crafting a Recipe or Plan they had previously learned.
---
Most likely this issue that is being addressed in this patch rather than you having a plan of something that shouldn't be able to be created...
---
Agreed right now we get notified we’re losing fluids 
---
Honestly would love them all, getting 10 players together for a concert would be pretty awesome.
---
So then you agree this change doesn't address the issue and instead introduces new mechanical issues to workshops. Building a 2x2 around the workshop so that a piece of the structure MUST be destroyed in order to challenge a claimed workshop is not an exploit, its sound strategy. 
---
hey I like this idea :P I've even got the western-outfit in the stash as well, I'll try it out the next day I'm "just sitting here" like I did on the day I recorded this other one :P
---
Are you sure you understand what he's trying to say? Do you have any proof to the contrary?
---
A do that a lot. If the Whitespring station should have had loads of .44 ammo, 5.56 ammo, and a ridiculous amount of asbestos, gold, silver, and rubber last night.
---
I was wondering if I was the only one experiencing this. I use crit/vats and it seems like my “95%” shot it’s about 50% of the time. I was wondering if it had something to do with when I charge my shot vs entering vats
---
of course they are. stagger *is* a great way to kill them. but the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against anyone not wearing sentinel as well.
---
then again, you could just pop a stealthboy and sneak a power attack with a minmaxed bloodied power fist. but I know from experience it doesn't always work.
---
Seconded.
---
They all run on nuclear energy. Everything in the FO universe runs on nuclear energy. Pants? Nuclear. Stoves? Nuclear. Nuclear? Nuclear! 
---
No, i can. Because you're acting like one. Everyone knows it's a game, you saying "BUT ITS JUST A GAME" over and over is irrelevant, it makes no difference. 
---
If you intentionally break the rules of the game, you deserve to get banned for it. Full stop. 
---
Lol was thinking the same. Didn't play for the last 3 weeks. Just followed the events here on reddit und now was greeted with the same error code.
---
But in the upper right corner it says maintenance is still going.
---
Glad you're aware of it, but that's how bulk scrap worked before a few patches ago! It isn't a "new functionality," it's just restoring bulked stuff to how it used to work (not autoscrapped with "scrap all junk," is autoscrapped while crafting). The patch that took away autoscrapping mods also broke bulked scrap somehow. 
---
When will the team be taking a look at laser and plasma weapon degredation issues as well as heavy gun degredation issues? Also the Gatling plasma is still bugged. Wondering when we might expect some of those to be fixed, thanks for patch 6 hope to see more soon (as well as more power armor skins)
---
Never found a TSE, but I’ve gotten a lot of explosives the last few days. Bloodied explosive, quad explosive, zealot’s explosive... had an AAE Dragon drop last night. That made me smile. I had maybe one explosive drop in my first few hundred hours of play. 
---
Gosh, it's almost like he was cheating to get that much.
---
So someone can now hide in a bush at the edge of the build area of a workshop and contest it?
---
I understand people bulding stash boxes around workshops, but the entire build area?
---
You cant even craft Ultracite, the guy is a cheater through and through. 
---
The problem is bethesda said that anyone banned in this wave cannot appeal.
---
They kind of aren't, they just have limited use until they can be legendary. They both have use as utility weapons in PvP. 
---
Yeah, I won't touch a workshop now. Full disclosure... I'm one of the players that came up with creative ways to block access to the workbench.
---
Thats not a fact what so ever. Tse has been in fallout since fo3 in fact same with good armor lol. Just because it has a low drop rate and you habe been so unfortunate in your travels to not have gotten one dropped doesnt give you the right to make the statements you did about and you cant correlate those in the same category. Ive personally traded for almost everything i had dupped or non dupped dont be upset bcause someone else can obtain somthing and you cant. Your post screams frustration towards it. Grow up dude its a fucking video game
---
Can confirm it's from scrapping their heads.
---
I love how it specifically states used controllers because let's be real here most people aren't going to buy new controllers when they still retail as the launch Price of 60$ and then it's the cheap end of thumbsticks.
---
Because anything to get rid of that game with so much controversy eyy? 
---
Vibrators? Nuclear!
---
When youre more interesting in banning people for exploiting instead of fixing shit that fucks over players then your game is fucked. 
---
This is why I stopped playing destiny
---
Should just delete mule characters. No ban. Most people would quit anyways.
---
Do you realize he's saying he never had anywhere close to the 200k, and the system just registered him moving the same stuff back and forth as "acquiring" additional stuff?
---
It's got nothing to do with charging the shots. I have a regular Gauss and it works great, even when I charge the shots. It's the TwoShot legendary mod that brings the accuracy WAY down.
---
bwah bwah bwah bwah bwah bwahhhhhmmmmm
---
So the point the guy about playing by the rules isn’t specifically cheating.. lolz
---
Downvoted 
---
around 3 hours? i’m not entirely sure but i’d say it’s been between 2 and 4 hours almost every time
---
im a bygones man myself
---
one of the most demoralizing losses my clan ever had in crucible was one guy on the enemy team using drang/sturm combo, he absolutely wrecked us, and to this day i have never seen anyone else come close to his level with those guns
---
Everything has been "on your radar" but when will the one remaining dev working on the game find the time to actually look at this huge list of things "on their radar"?
---
Yes.  Apparently this is to allow bulk item *in the stash* to be scrapped when crafting, if that didn't happen people who have the habit of bulking everything wouldn't be able to scrap.
---
(personally I'd be ok with that, but some people are weird about bulking things.  Damn waste of good plastic if you ask me).
---
That is a valid point.
---
[This](https://i.redd.it/jvvwy6hgjj7y.png) springs to mind
---
The gun version or the junk version?
---
Great job Bethesda!
---
Now that we're through the worst of the bugs and glitches, I think we're all excited for more content.
---
I agree 3 months in and weapons aren't working correctly.. yikes!  Upside is that you can get plasma cores cheap from other players...stock up
---
terraforming for nuke areas? like rugged terrain?
---
There's a seperate tab for Ultracite ammo.
---
It's a legendary armour effect which reflects damage back to the attacker. 
---
Google is your friend. 
---
You could make a killing selling that to other players. 
---
Literally same except I fell in love with Ds1 and eventually speedrunning, so in the span of a year I logged 2k in Ds1 about 900 in Ds2 and roughly 400 in Bloodborne
---
If I didn't have an outlet like that,I can assure you I'd either be a junkie, an alcoholic or dead. Beyond a shadow of a doubt.
---
Software updates, software updates never change.
---
brb, gonna edit some more comments after the fact
---
check me on destiny tracker ps4, Jullz_Wolf.
---
Yeah I got a tse combat shotgun: A troubleshooters explosive shotgun. It is underwhelming and it makes me a little sad everytime I see it.
---
Because of the duping deletes we I'm sure they can track items, which makes this very unlikely. 
---
Yes!  Ran into this last night for 15 minutes whilst banging my ahead against the wall the entire time.
---
I have tried both with &amp; without the one Chameleon armor piece, and the noticeable difference is remaining cloaked while moving. The not so noticeable is that it definitely improves my overall Sneak ability. One of the other players I team with a lot has also adopted this method, and I can see him on radar when I get within about 40-50 ft, yet he can't see me, but I also have much higher perception than he does (+3)
---
This happens to me a lot. Sometimes they drop and are capable of being looted, but there is not a legendary or legendary substitute (e.g., drill, syringer)
---
&gt;	so that a piece of thr structure must be destroyed
---
That’s the entire problem. Concrete foundations cannot be destroyed. They are impervious to damage. 
---
Of course. 
---
I am happy with all of this. So many little things fixed. I can't wait to play again!
---
Yeah, I think there is more those complainers are not saying. Perhaps they picked up a duper’s bag, but they should have known 35k nuka quantum is shady. 
---
Bethesda would not want to impact the regular player base. They probably went out of their way not to, because those are the folks that make the game fun and hopefully buy atom.  The people complaining got caught red handed and they are getting their due punishment. 
---
check your email, also if you know it's down why would you try to log in?

You acquire it by cheating.  Duh.

&gt;Thats not a fact what so ever. Tse has been in fallout since fo3 in fact same with good armor lol.
---
you mean 4. and everyone locked them in Fo4. people didn't actually farm legendaries back then.
---
&gt;Just because it has a low drop rate and you habe been so unfortunate in your travels to not have gotten one dropped doesnt give you the right to make the statements you did about and you cant correlate those in the same category.
---
it's math. you're literally arguing against numbers. what I said isn't subjective.
---
it's math.
---
&gt;Ive personally traded for almost everything i had dupped or non dupped dont be upset bcause someone else can obtain somthing and you cant.
---
and you're still not getting my point. you were only able to trade for those things because they've been duped so extensively. if duping was never a thing, you wouldn't have those things.
---
&gt;In your screenshot it shows 100's of thousands of ultracite ammo - and you don't even use it?
---
It's been calculated elsewhere how time and resource intensive it would be.  
---
Can confirm fusion generator is a PIMA. I had to disassemble my entire camp so I could place my FG on the ground floor. Took me over an hour to place it and rebuild everything.
---
Sir, i have to argue the following with you: [https://i.imgur.com/bTnqzkq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bTnqzkq.jpg)
---
Start menu in game(below atoms shop) there's a challenges menu. Click it and it shows current challenges, one being how many hours you played.
---
&gt;"Banned" means you can never access the game again. Your account is shut down.
---
Not **technically** true. A ban simply means you cannot access the game. Permanent ban means forever. Temporary ban means exactly that. But to your point, no one was permanently banned.
---
They stay too..it's no longer attached to your character
---
It really isn't ownage when you look at how bethesda is getting their numbers. Read the email closely, those numbers aren't the amount he currently has, just the amount that went through his inventory over a 30 day span. With muling ammo back and forth those numbers can become EXTREMELY inflated very quickly.
---
Good job. You did it. You successfully made an analogy with zero connection and has zero correlation to the issue at hand. Good job on disproving any arguement you may have had and making yourself look like an absolute vegetable. 
---
Well I was assuming you meant level 51...
---
The OP was stupid too. 
---
At least it says you might get your account back when the fix the problem. The bad part is it says when they fix the problem. 
---
Yeah, I'm not happy with this change for exactly the reason you mentioned.  The whole point was to overcome players and obstacles to get to the bench to take it over.
---
What about paper bags on your camp? To they stay in the air or stuff like that?
---
&gt; It really isn't ownage when you look at how bethesda is getting their numbers.

---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Look at it like this, say you have 25k ammo and you are trying to clean your stash and you drop the ammo on the ground in your camp for a couple minutes to clear your stash out some and then pick it back up, that ammo now counts TWICE towards the 100k cap. Likewise if you take that ammo and mule it off to a mule and then trade it back to your main account later that ammo ALSO counts twice toward that cap, and if you are counting the ammo from both the mule and the main account then that ammo could actually be counting more than twice towards the cap.
---
&gt; Like say you got 25k ammo so you mule it to your mule now the mule also has 25k ammo in bethesdas eyes, and then you mule it back to your main account now your main account is seen as 50k ammo and the mule is seen as 25k ammo, so in bethesdas eyes and that email 25k ammo is being shown as 75k. Even though it is actually only 25k.
---
Three out of three attempts.
---
Someone posted about a melee tank build previously - works for ranged weapons too.  Basically you need Blocker, Barbarian, Ironclad, Evasive, Lone Wanderer, etc.  Mixed armor set with resistances towards certain enemies - Zealots, Troubleshooters would be the ones I prioritize given the mix of enemies you encounter.
---
The only problem is with nuke zones, you'll have to wear a hazmat suit.  Even then you can get your DR up to 200-ish, so its not all that bad.  You can do without Fireproof (just get dense mod for your chest piece) but you might want to consider Adamantium Skeleton to mitigate limb damage.
---
Mutations are part of the build too - Grounded, Scaly Skin giving you extra DR/ER.  And White Knight cause regular armor will break down a lot faster than PA.
---
Agree, I made that point in one of my replies. A few stray bullets is one thing, but if I repeatedly smack your water purifier with my Super Sledge, by hit four it's pretty intentional. 
---
Omg it took awhile but I got it! Upvoting

About 3h
---
Welcome. 
---
I take workshops literally every session I am online, and I have never once seen a work bench blocked entirely by foundations. So while I will admit my account is anecdotal, and reflects my own experiences alone, that's a non-issue in the grand scheme of things and could be better addressed with a change to the building engine and perhaps specifically the foundation pieces. 
---
But at any rate, introducing a new mechanic wherein someone can passively challenge the ownership of a workshop from anywhere on the premises is certainly not the solution, even if a problem does indeed exist. 
---
He says he never had that many, if you read the post. He claims he got hit by a bad case of double-counting by Bethesda.
---
3 days 
---
It’s such a joke man lol
---
8m saying this bc I lost a shit ton of good legendaries a week ago, as I dropped them, then my power went out
---
No...lol I’m level 117 or I should say was, still not that high compared to many others...
---
It’s all good, i am not that upset about it. I am sure it will be resolved. But I bought the game from them on there website.  :)
---
I did. But something for me smells fishy here, if I was banned for no reason I wouldn't feel the need to explain how I gathered, spent, dropped, shared, stashed everything, I would file a support ticket, and wait and see. I hope he gets unbanned if he really didn't deserve it.
---
New Vegas had it. 
---
Well if he went around and fixed peoples stuff with the duped items than he participated. Even though it was done in good intentions and slight ignorance to how bad They were going to crack down. It sucks and I feel for you for trying to do a good thing for people, but it still counts as participation. Bethesda drew a line in the sand and eliminated any grey area. Unfortunately you were on the wrong side of that line.
---
Don't forget the beer bottles!
---
I am having similar problems. It's specific items like adhesive, stimpaks, frag grenades, screws, etc. 
---
The odd part is that when you are crafting items, it will use from the exact same inventory just fine, but you cannot take the items out directly. 
---
We have a team of 3 people that play with each other all the time locally, and all have the issue whether they are under weight or not. Other items that can still load my weight up work just fine, it's only certain items that it will not allow you to remove from stash. None of us have stacks of legendary items or anything like that, we've gotten bored and farmed the crap out of things for days at a time. 
---
If it is a mod you're using, they're not going to support it or do anything to fix it. Because there is zero mod support at this time. They *might* fix the drug, but they won't touch a mod.
---
Ok, But like I said it happened to me when attacking someone in power armor, I’ve also never seen or owned armor with this effect, yet when someone attacked me a few days back they died from full health and I became wanted, if someone has a picture or screenshot of this armor I would love too see it cos I’m still confused 
---
Praaaiisseee Jesssussss.
---
Now where are our vendor bots? :(
---
IF ONLY WE COULD RE-NAME ITEMS!
---
u/Valseek Do you happen to know if there's a fix coming for daily and repeating events not showing as completed on our Pipboys? Since BETA, I've only ever shown Fertile Soil as complete, and it's difficult to manage which events I've completed with each character build because of it.
---
I guess fixing duping is harder then it sounds. Hopefully they find a permanent fix soon tho.
---
I got a bunch of that ammo free with a weapon from a kindly trader. I dumped most of it. Only kept a little of it. Might have been before the past 30 days. Don't really remember. Not banned though.
---
too funny
---
Why do they always do maintenance on my days off? It’s a set up 
---
I don't understand your crazy moon language.
---
https://youtu.be/hw58NzHaI0g
---
It is good. I am not maxed and can kill things with ease.
---
Usually around 3 or 4 hours. 
---
I have the plan for the BOS sniper rifle and even though it’s suppressed, and distance and power per my build is awesome, it is no way whatsoever stealth when enemy will come in your direction even from the longest shots you can take. 
---
That’s a lot of ammo but I wouldn’t say it’s impossible to farm up legitimately. I’ve made about 40k 5.56 myself and I only have a couple hundred hours. I’ve also spent very little time actually farming ammo. Hit up all the solos for lead and buy the steel while the steel factory is going, easy.
---
After two chars getting to 50+ and the present one farming from level 13 in Watoga etc I quit.
---
 I have what I need and just wander, although I am still looking for my X0-1 Jet Pack so The Whitespring gets visited a lot.
---
Happened to me many times already. At WS the ghouls bodies often fall below the stairs so you can’t reach them to collect the loot. So now I only lure them out to open ground then start the fight. But yes even on flat ground they disappeared right before my eyes sometimes, one time even a scorchbeast queen. Several guys circled the area for a long time with ??? popping above their heads. 
---
This issue seems to be more that Bethesda doesn't know you track items properly, so when acquired by any means they are tallying, but when traded, dropped stashed etc they are not removing the tallies. Almost like Bethesda made a really broken game, then made a really broken cheat checker too.
---
Lieutenant-General Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov's little toy is always mandatory.
---
Me too, this game rocks!
---
That’s odd, I barely ever take workshops and I’ve seen the foundations as well as stash boxes, just covering the work bench with stacked stash boxes so that it can’t be taken since those can’t be destroyed either. But yeah my experience is anecdotal too. 
---
And we entirely agree that this does introduce new problems (I said as much in my first comment here). Changes to how building works would be better, but building is such a mess I imagine this was a quicker fix. 
---
Or a story,or some dlc?
---
I've had my CAMP griefed by having every structure damaged to nearly broken (walls, crafting benches, etc.). So that is a thing that has happened and I don't think it is something that isn't going to happen. I think bethesda should be careful about how CAMP changes will affect griefing. I'm hoping the 'camp can't be placed, do you want to move to a different server' thing might help slightly with people griefing because you're in their spot.
---
It was mildly funny though that someone went through the effort of systematically damaging everything. The healthbars were all like \~2%. The only frustration I had with it was not being able to choose to repair specific nearly broken things.
---
They will be fighting duping as long as the game is around. Exploiters will exploit.
---
The only gripe I have is that there wasn't a post that said X amount of players were getting suspended and getting ahead of the internet cluster fuck that always happens.
---
First off the stash increase is much needed along with the performance fixes
---
My only beef is changing the martial artist perk for the gatling gun. It makes sense that you can grind faster if you can wing a super sledge faster..... It completely messes up the viability of having a heavy weapon gatling gun build. 
---
Yeah, it's my day off too. Sucks, but if it makes the game better I'm all for it
---
Damn, cheers guys 
---
I found Vegetarian Ham yesterday.  THREW IT IN THE TRASH.
---
Just a heads up, Lucky Hole Mines is loaded with crystal nodes. 
---
See the ban hammer isn’t being wildly swung. They know for the most part how items are obtained. All these duper’s swearing up and down that they’re innocent of everything is annoying. 
---
No more Rad Worm super jumps! Boooo! Nah, it was fun while it lasted. That shit got obnoxious. 
---
When they ask for management they're looking to be compensated. People can be scumbags.
---
This one's on our radar, thanks for mentioning it!
---
What's CWC? Did a google search but all I found was some YouTuber that goes by that
---
I play on Xbox, I have reported this issue since launch. And I’ve managed to make my character to the 70s. It’s not EVERY enemy but say I encounter 5 super mutants, my crit sneak damage registers for the first two and they drop like flies. I’ll still be sneaked camo hidden gone hit them and get the crit damage but their health just bounces back. It’s like the legendary enemy bug that existed or whatever but it only happens with my stealth character doing stealth attacks.
---
Where it belongs!! 
---
I’ve got a 200+ and several 80’s and there’s only been 2 explosive drops for me and never a TSE.
---
Or destroy buildings ( since you can’t go in most of them anyways )in some way and have a fee of resources to “rebuild” America ( like workshop / camp assets )
---
Yeah I got it. I'm just saying that 225k is awfully close to 255k.
---
ya me too, that was most of the fun i had with them honestly, finding new creative ways to hide the workbench so enemies had to shoot through a couple walls to find it and then see it was blocked by some stash boxes that they would also need to destroy.  "Sure come take my workshop from me but its going to cost ya", was the idea.  the people who fight me for my workshops don't even care about the resources, they just want to kill me and leave an immature message for me with signs and letters on the wall.  shoutout to the team of lvl150+ players who killed my level 14 and left "you touch uh my doggy bootyhole" on my workshop at hemlock holes earlier this week.
---
I'm a level 155 and I've only had one TSE drop. A 2* TSE dragon.
---
People will just keep finding new ways tho which sucks not sure if there is one big fix all
---
No, it's not. Sorry I'm skeptical of false bans. No one I know in our discord has had any issues. I'm not saying it's impossible people got wrongly banned. I'm saying it's improbable.
---
FYI, the fact that this decision was "final" until it got enough attention is unacceptable. It is clear to everyone that there are almost certainly a number of other players who have been banned under similar circumstances, but since they didn't generate enough bad PR, they don't get to play the game hey bought and paid for.
---
If you aren't absolutely certain that someone is cheating, you should be allowing appeals, that is common sense. From a developer perspective, applying blanket bans like this with no appeals in such a buggy game is just asking for trouble. Is anyone over there really that confident that some new bug won't come out tomorrow where some bugged quest is rewarding way too much ammo?
---
Power Armour: Resistances are no longer incorrectly reduced when entering Power Armour wearing Underarmour
---
Does this mean this works now and I would get the S.P.E.C.I.A.L bonuses from them?
---
They think it’s duped, but there’s a good chance it isn’t.
---
Where is the FIRE AX plan?!?!?
---
Yep
---
I thought this was going to be a thread about hanging out under a bridge and sleeping in a dumpster. This is still acceptable 
---
Thank you for the patch (and detailed notes)
---
Could we get you guys working on adding the remaining missing items and armors to the legendary drop pool? For instance the enclave scout armor, the ripper and drill and I think one of the pipe weapons.
---
The Scout Armor has such an awesome unique look, it would be a shame to just have it be a scrap item.
---
Yes. This would be a welcome update. Sneaking does feel broken right now; there are times I can sneak right past a mob and others where I will be spotted from 50 feet away. 
---
20 atoms as an award for spending 7600 hours in game? Anyone else think it’s a little sketchy? 
---
sashay away ultracite, shantay you stay legendary flare gun. 
---
If I can pick, I'll be a rutabaga.  Also, you saying my one statement disproves any and all of my arguments makes you look like an absolute child.  ALSO, my analogy has connection but you either can't see it or you just don't want to.  
---
You picked up items you knew were duped.  What you were going to do with them: nobody gives a flaming fuck, what matters is you involved yourself willingly with duped items.  You took your chances and here we are.  Enjoy.
---
This account has violated the Code of Conduct and Terms of Service by exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication. We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items WITHIN 30 DAYS OF GAME PLAY.
---
Yup, bring on the grinding wheel, and make that where your "makeshift Warrior" station.  All Melee weapons should be crafted there and then projectile weapons at the current weapons bench.
---
I think the increase would be worthy of praise if it doubled the limit, but a paltry 200lbs is just "ok".  
---
I can't wait until they fix the light on the T-51 helmet. It's weird having a cone of light coming out of a bulb that doesn't illuminate.
---
Nah not necessarily. With 900 hours you could definitely hit that much ultracite. There’s also trading.
---
they don't need to share anything. It gains them nothing. They have test teams that get paid to put in 40 hours a week into this game. As someone who used to work in games testing, your test team will know better than anyone if something is legit viable in game without exploits. 
---
When reviewing players in a script pass you will always have outliers. Those players that exceed the norm. For whatever reason made it their life to play the game and find the most efficient farming method for an ammo *they'll never use*. Then you have people exploiting, and they always far exceed even those outlier players. It's generally a fairly obvious call to make. 
---
I'm siding with Bethesda here. Even players who made it their job to stream this game for the past month didn't come close to these "I'm just really good at farming" players. Occam's razor here. 
---
Happens to me quite a bit. I’ve noticed sometimes the bodies return to their spawn point but you can’t acces the loot until they turn into a meat pile. This example has happened to me 3 times inside fort defiance.
---
I could have easily been banned for that though if it were within the past 30 days. Maybe if I dropped it and picked it back up a few times trying to figure out how much to keep.
---
Time to move my C.A.M.P...
---
I think my big issue here is the delay in any sort of action once duping was exposed altogether.  I think we went 40+ days without any kind of patch to even attempt to resolve.
---
This is still nerd energy
---
Ohhh I see! Apologies I didn't realise you were getting the bug without having the affect on your gear. Huh, that's very weird, hopefully the patch will fix it for you. 
---
the stash weight cap is by far the hardest enemy to beat in the game
---
But they dumped their stuff the day before patch. They are innocent now
---
There are two different ones that are named very similarly.  The moneymaker you refer to should be fine.
---
Any info on missing BoS armor mod plans, and others that are missing from vendors?
---
Does anyone know what apparel recipe they are talking about?
---
because a level 140 can defend a work shop from a level 25 not vise versa. 
---
This more than anything is the real problem with this ban wave. It's not the bans, it's "you can't appeal and also you can't even contact us." Bethesda does not have the track record to be able to say there are no false positives in the people they banned.
---
Why would your ever think that your account that doesn't own the game would let you log in? You're not banned, you're just an idiot.
---
So basically you're saying that you're talking out of your ass right now and actually have no idea how it works?
---
"Bethesda did nothing wrong because in my imagination I know how the game works"
---
Woah! This was unexpected! Thanks guys! Hope the server is back up soon
---
It's always something with this sub right? There's no way there could be anything wrong with Fallout 76 I mean just look how well it sold.
---
They said by the end of this month. So next week latest. 
---
ha! i have a shot of that same exact rock...
---
Yeah fixing that and a lot of other issues with the build system would definitely be much better but I imagine this was the quickest way to prevent unclaimable workshops. 
---
It probably took them that long to figure out any kind of way to fix it. I'm sure it's more then just a small fix on there end
---
Since when is looking at post history frowned upon? It's there for a reason.
---
YES ! A shared stash or ways to transfer content between characters please. 
---
Here's a list of my most wanted improvements (in no particular order). I'm hoping that you could at least consider them.
---
* Can you please make an easy way to download my photos from console to share publicly? It would be great if I could simply log-in to my Bethesda account online and find my pictures there. Taking a screenshot of my photo and uploading it to Onedrive is not working.
---
* Can you please load more of the game before I enter the world? I'm tired of running around for 5 minutes being attacked by invisible enemies without being able to do anything about it. This seems to be more of an issue when I spawn near my camp.
---
* Can you please make it so we can store more stuff at our camp even if it's not available everywhere like the stash? In a game that is all about collecting, it's frustrating that I can't horde everything that I collect. Upgrading the stash limit is not a valid long term solution, and neither is forcing me to change my playstyle. You will need to find a novel solution to the problem that allows for infinite storage, or at least an order of magnitude greater.
---
* Please consider the following improvements to the UI to help with inventory management:
---
1. show the weight of each tab in the stash menu and inventory menu
---
2. show the total weight of each stack in addition to individual item weight
---
3. give us the ability to rename all items (including aid, junk, everything), even if it's only seen by me, and include an option to reset the name to default.
---
4. either make the quantity slider stop when I hit 1 item, or allow it to wrap around on both sides. It currently only wraps around when I hit left, but stops at maximum when I hit right.
---
I have a Toe-Knife for sell, if anyone needs one. 
---
Incorrect.
---
The scrap head version.  You can scrap gun to get the head to scrap into raw mats too.
---
Turns out he was a cheater all along.  So cheaters shouldn't go viral.
---
So you're admitting to duping time? 
---
No, you didn't. 
---
Ove bult an open concert room at the top of my place! I like to think random people drop by and play when im not home... 
---
The servers are down. 
---
Yes please, so many times i've been excited to see a 3 star legendary monster just to kill it and not have it drop a single legendary item :(
---
There is not a fix because the game has to store your information in case you disconnect. All they are doing is exploiting this aspect of an online game. Drop it, disconnect and the item now exists in your inventory and the container. You have to reduce the delta to make it go away. That means writing more data more frequently. Given the server stability issues, I don’t see them being able to fix this. 
---
Then it could very well be Bethesda covering thier butts. I know my ammo was obtained legitimately and I am not banned so I use this as the basis of my statement. I have more ammo and my account is still in perfect standing. It could be how the ammo was obtained.. you can't store that much ammo in a bag or crate unless it's bugged and if it showed he picked up x amount of ammo from x location that might be the basis. But this is all speculation, the fact is something flagged that account and not mine and if it was just ammo amount, I would be on the banned waggon... Sorry for the pun.
---
Last official word was at 11:00 est  https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323540/fallout-76-maintenance-feb-19-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
If this isn't reason enough to have the ability to rename items then I don't know what is...
---
Careful criticising this game, as we speak someone is probably pouring over your post history looking for a way to assassinate your character so they can make an AHA! post to the sub and write off your valid criticisms.
---
Dicking around with random people isn't fun, it's just being a dick.
---
hi. please list the run you recommend, for us not in the know, thanks!
---
thats only when i play Stinky pete, he eats out of the trash, im said i cant seem my character name in game
---
I'm curious as well...
---
Who uses tens of thousands of ammo every day?  Maybe sellers?  Must be quite a big market if lots of people are trading. Any solid numbers on that market?
---
No, not EVERYONE cheats.  Those who say they weren't and were banned, were likely lying.
---
Fucking dope!
---
How can you build that high? I actually have my camp at the same location (near south mountain lookout) but can't build more than 4 stories.
---
Your not banned, the server are down. 
---
Your reading comprehension seems horrific.
---
Right?  They are focused on fixing all the wrong things!
---
servers down for patching my dude. you can enjoy your duped weapon when it comes back.
---
Wearing a clown suit.....watching..
---
.... judging
---
Trading, there was a massive sell off on the unofficial markets of tse once the nerf hit, I was able to scoop up one of each one I wanted for around 3-5k a piece.  Obviously I didn’t trade for the noted copies that were floating around.
---
this thing is hard to come by for me. I server hopped about an hours near by  the watoga vendors last night....
---
Sorry, I might not have been super clear as to why I would trade back and forth.
---
Character 1 gets a kick ass shotgun, he's a shotgunner, but doesn't have all the mods unlocked.  Character 1 trades it to Mule 1, who trades it to Character 2, who mods the gun, trades it back to Mule 1, who trades it back to Character 1.  Character 1 proceeds to kick ass and chew bubble gum.
---
In all my years of gaming I've never seen a false ban for cheating. These people are definitely lying.
---
dont fight things you want to loot next to bushes. i found the hard way they can land in the bush. 
---
You're not banned. Servers are down now. Calm down.
---
By cheating, of course.
---
The one that cracks me up is the one were they say “well thats an obtainable amount of ammo” ok yeah if thats all you want is that ammo for your one gun ok yeah maybe. But when every stack is that with every account full of weapons and armor and aid, that is not obtainable
---
I say just get rid of the invantory roll back for DC. Dont drop it if you dont want to loss it
---
Is it mean I got banned if I’m getting a 4:8:2006 error? I haven’t even played in months and I’ve never done anything against the rules?
---
This happens way too often, like regularly for me.
---
Well, yes. If you think rationally you would notice how unrealistic it is what he is saying. Bethesda can track items, so they surely didn't just add up all the ammo he had 50 times over. We can't be sure, but some parts of his post are almost definitely not true, that makes me not trust this guy. 
---
Yes but it's a bit different that real life. The thing is, to be banned you have to hit a threshold with having more than 100.000 of a rare item. So I'm very skeptical than many if any innocent was banned
---
i have never gotten ANY great legendaries, always crappy armor that is usually 20 levels too low for me
---
But Source Code Rock is completely broken up and all over the place? How will I get there now?
---
Well on iOS I scroll left to my profile and there’s a “saved” tab under it.
---
What exactly are you looking for stat-wise?
---
350k Ultracite, including a secondary account hiding most of it, if it were legit he wouldn't have had the need to hide most on an alt.
---
Bless up
---
Why so much ammo? Slowing down servers ammo hog only need a few thousand...what u think there will be anmo shortage in the future? 
---
With the multitude of other problems this game has, you're surprised that Bethesda can't keep track of ammo properly?
---
&gt;they never come after my lvl 140 for some reason lol
---
this was sarcasm, i know why my low level build is targeted frequently and why they are weary of engaging my main character.   that being said, i did kill a level 73 player trying to take my workshop when i was level 11, but that was 4-5 shots to take him down and he one shot me when he returned.
---
Because they **NEED** to find something, anything, that they can hold up and say:
---
"Well you posted **THIS** so I'm going to ignore your valid complaints because it suits me and I have no way of refuting them"
---
So turns out proof was provided that he did cheat.  Do you think Bethesda just banned the guy at someone else's word?  Or maybe they actually looked at his account and found hundreds of thousands of ultracite ammo and banned him from that proof of cheating?
---
Nah solo play has been where its at for YEARS. If dicking around is your ONLY idea of having fun when playing solo, you're a dick 
---
Exactly
---
That's how I got the plan just scrap assaultron heads
---
I run 2 stars of the perk (only when fixing weps), won't go to the third star till they fix the axe, as all I use right now is 3 Grognack Axes. Can usally get thru 2-3 Silos and Queens before I need to fix again. (Troubleshooter's for Robots/Silo, Zealots for the Queenfight/Scorched, 3* Antiarmour/PowAtk Dmg/AGI for everything else)
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I just commented on Twitter that I wanted paint jobs for Excavator Armor and had a guy jump on talking about unfair bans... I can’t escape those people and the worst part is they think people will believe them
---
Idk. Window is 830-3. Might work half day depending on how late I'm on. 
---
12 days. 
---
If you're on Xbox I can craft you one for 25 caps
---
While I sympathize with the lot of you saying this is going to make it too easy for people to hide out and challenge a workshop, I have also seen it where workshop owners are placing four of the 12ft tall cement security barricades around the 'shop bench and a fast travel target inside that, ensuring that nobody but him can get to the bench to make the challenge. I suspect that's what they are trying to get around with this change.
---
Don't cheat, won't be banned.  Buh bye.
---
What would a free caps farm be in this case?
---
You mean the only way YOU have fun playing solo is to dick around with randoms.
---
Fanboys are such strange creatures.
---
You have no room to complain haha. I’m a pistol stealth/crit build and it feels like I need two Agility categories to make it work how I want. I’d love for my Gunslinger cards to be under Perception 
---
I mean they paid for the mats to make it since it needs a ton of steel
---
That's so.shitty of them.  I got banned as well and didn't know why.  But now I know exactly why. They are punishing players for playing their game alot .  Good job bethesda 
---
How do you not know which items already do this?
---
"Items", because items are likely to have unique identifiers per item. 
---
But not ammo. A stack of ammo can be split, merged, traded, at which point it becomes a "new" stack(s), which is impossible to track. Unless e.g. they keep a separate tally for how much ammo the character "used" vs "dropped", and only consider the "used + currently owned" amounts. And even then there are probably loopholes I haven't thought about in the 5 minutes it took me to write this.
---
With Bethesda's record do you trust them to do it this 100% reliably?
---
You may be right...  My only hope is that they give this more attention.  I’ve made and lost too many friends in the wasteland due to the lack of attention from the dev team.
---
Post-apocalyptic Doomsday prepper lol
---
If the game is so well made and fun you'd think they'd be spending more of their time, you know, actually playing it.
---
I wonder where they're getting all this free time to witchhunt members of their own sub from? Crashes and loading screens maybe?
---
"You crashed after launching a nuke AGAIN! That's it, I'm taking the kids and moving in with my sister! See you in divorce court, asshole!"
---
Sell it on ebay is the smartest decision. Or make your own Nuke Code and have someone solve.
---
As you can see from the linked email, he couldn't appeal the decision. This was the next best option, easily.

---
Not hiding, storing. 350k ammo weighs a lot even with bandolier equipped.
---
And like I said it’s possible. 900 hours. Plus you craft more ultracite ammo per craft than regular. Combine that with ammosmith, super duper and a lot of free time and you’ll have so much you won’t be able to use it all.
---
Nope but most of my friends did for bs things
---
Why weren’t all of these items already brought up in “the discussion”?
---
is it too high to reach even with marsupial?  
---
Correct.
---
What they don't require you to have an active membership to play it still. On my way to sub, never thought I'd say that. 
---
I've picked up two TSEs total in nearly 500 hours of play.  Neither of them recently.
---
Flamer trap does this, too
---
Possible Bug: Does anyone else see their randomly disappear from their HUD and Pip-boy? 
---
Winning
---
White Knight is for regular armor. Each level is a boost to reducing repair costs and your armor takes less damage. 60% at rank 3 I believe (used to be 90%). If you are running a melee build I would almost say this is mandatory as being equipped. Your stash of ballistic weave will thank you.
---
Power Patcher affects PA. Each level is a boost to reducing repair costs and your armor takes less damage. 60% at rank 3 I believe.
---
On my Heavy Weapons/PA build, I run Power Patcher 3, and I have yet to repair a single piece of my T-60 in almost 65 levels now. That is face tanking SBs and the SBQ.
---
Well that is hilarious so I have a hard time condemning them for that.
---
You need a second account to transfer your stuff over. What’s wrong with you? Not everyone has someone else on 24/7 to help them move stuff. I also have two accounts so I have more storage. I also store ammo on the mule.
---
Go read his thread. It’s very believable and makes sense. There are no holes. If you want to call everyone on the internet a liar without having any real reason too then go ahead, just don’t expect it to end well.
---
I logged on today and freaked out too but it’s just the code for the server being down for maintenance.  
---
You are not banned. That error shows up because the servers are down.
---
There is no "weird ban practice".
---
Servers are going offline for patch maintenance, like every other game in the world, only.
---
I think the solution to this problem is obvious: build a dyson sphere of stash boxes around the perimeter of the workshop.
---
Whats the xp glitch?
---
thanks, dude that's the math right there that I was referring to.
---
This guys!
---
I absolutely feel for you.  Pistols need a TON of love.  I use pistols as a backup on my melee, and even with an instigating/faster reload black powder pistol, I'm just plinking at enemies up on ledges.  I only have 5 cards specifically for my pistol, but +30% damage (+45% with bloody mess) still doesn't feel like much.
---
thank you so much for finally fixing the rad worms-problem :P and the fusion core-ordeal, and for the added stash-size, and so so much for adding a cooldown on scorchbeast-"screech", and for not handing out 1 lousy cap from stashes anymore even though it was slightly chuckleworthy when it happened. Sad to see my extra "swing-speed" on the gatling gun go, but ..all this else is so so worth it plus it was never intended that way anyway so I get it :P 
---
no
---
I would assume crafting is a logged activity as well as farming for flux, or any other type of vegetation. I can't remember if you receive xp for picking vegetation or not, but even if you don't, it is easy enough to have the game create a log for it. Anything related to XP would definitely be logged, and I would assume trading between players would be also. 
---
I am quite sure that Bethesda has enabled logging for much of this game, including player activities, so that they can determine what is working and what is causing issues. That is database/application logging, monitoring and management 101. It wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda's logs for FO76 are in the petabyte size range now.
---
These logs would show a chain of evidence on "HOW" an item was created, and while parsing those logs may take some time, I imagine it would not be hard for Bethesda to determine the exact origin of even a single .50 round.
---
If you never duped your items, I seriously doubt if Bethesda banned your account, as any script that I would create to parse items, would take into account any logs that I have on "how" those items were created.
---
If the logs show that the player actively farmed flux, traded for it, or received it from a non-duped source (another player), and then created ammo from that flux, the script that I wrote to ban people wouldn't place that person into the "banned" list.
---
I don't know the way that Bethesda keeps track of all the game items, does each item have a individual key assigned to them? If so, then said script would only need to parse duplicate keys...easy as pie. If there are no duplicate keys, then the script would just need to correlate crafting and trading logs for that player and people they have traded with. Yes, even the ole', just drop it on the ground and let someone else pick it up would be able to be tracked fairly easily.
---
Again, I'm with Bethesda on this one, it's fairly easy to log what happens in an application, and I am quite sure that they are able to, without a shadow of a doubt, determine the exact origin of any item that a player has in their inventory.
---
Now, before everyone chimes in to say, well if they log everything, why can't they find out that I had a particular item and it disappeared and they are saying they can't get it back. That is a Bethesda question, and something only they can answer, but I would imagine that half their time for tech support tickets would be filled up with people that accidentally deleted an item and decided to put in a ticket to say that it "magically" disappeared, so I understand their position on, "We can't retrieve it."
---
omg the round building needs platforms and those need shit to keep them from falling.... the placing and unlacing i cant even begin to imagine. 
---
100k 5mm
---
Thats only 200 reloads
---
I could probably go through that much ammo for my 5 mm gun 
---
especially considering how piss-poor the damage is on heavy weapons
---
Fighting bosses scorchbeast Queens mirelurk Queens
---
You could go through 200 reloads real fucking quick
---
My sneak sniper is on xbox as well.  If i were in your shoes i would recommend removing the mr. sandman perk and seeing if that's the issue.  I don't hear from many people running with that so it could be a bug specific to that perk.
---
If that doesn't turn out to be it - I would recommend a cache clearing - and if that doesn't work a reinstall.  70% of the time when I'm experiencing a bug that others aren't and I can't find any other fixes - one of those two does it.
---
FAILING ALL OF THAT - let me know if you are posting a thread in this forum to get this specific issue addressed and I can throw you an upvote.
---
It representative of you crapping yourself when the Wendigo jumps out.
---
The only way to have fun playing as a random is to not have some loser dicking around with you.
---
not if they're into it
---
Banned are people who aquired more than 100k of unique item. This glitch included thousands of granades/junk.
---
So they are banned too?
---
To the 'actual people' doubting OP:
---
Bethesda literally admits there's a bug that needs fixed before players are unbanned. Your logic now is "The bug I know about exists, but I have no idea how the backend works so I can safely say this user was cheating and there are no bugs"
---
Absolutely, or traded from by someone who got it organically.  There was only a small number of raw 2* tse dupes floating around.  Almost all had a 3rd * and were the same affix.  
---
Doesn't exist anymore but you were able to repair some traps in the world over and over which awarded XP and items.
---
Have you checked that it actually gives you more HP? Because I'm pretty sure +End clothing is bugged or just isn't intended to give HP. 
---
I know for sure that my +End legendary armor doesn't increase my HP.
---
It's not like cheaters are known for going on the forums claiming to be innocent, not at all, that never happens, the guy is clearly innocent.
---
They did promise player vending at one point but it never happened.
---
Had the same thing a few times as well. Can’t find the body, can’t search some of the ones that didn’t disappear. It’s annoying, I want my well earned pieces of meat and weapon I’ll never use!
---
See thats why i dont invest in those dramas, i just sit back, eat my popcorn and enjoy whats coming. 
---
Non-PA melee build, I have almost too much of the stuff. White Knight and the over-repair really do the job here
---
I can add in potted plants to this list :P Atleast it happens for me.
---
"**Martial Artist:** Now only applies its attack speed bonus to melee weapons and no longer incorrectly increases the Gatling Gun’s rate of fire. "  
---
Awww... it was a good run.
---
Filthy cheaters! Ban them all
---
I logged on to see if I was banned (I don’t dupe or cheat, but don’t trust Beth to know what they’re doing) and got this error... whew. 
---
You could always test that theory, just swap some ultracite ammo back and forth... 100k in total should do the trick
---
Considering your knowledge, how and when does antiarmor factor into dps? 
---
&gt; In a normal situation, I would give a person crying about an unfair ban about a 90% probability that they are entirely full of shit. However, since Bethesda has not exactly inspired confidence in their capabilities with this game, I'm willing to reduce that percentage to around 70%.
---
Considering how egregiously Bethesda has fucked up at every turn since the announcement of this game, I have no confidence whatsoever in their ability to accurately identify cheaters via script.
---
Until they come out and post in a couple of the "I'm innocent" threads some actual evidence along the lines of "We logged you crafting 256 Boards then shortly later logged you picking up 20,000 Nuka Cola" I will give the posters the benefit of the doubt.
---
The difference is that bulk *needs* to be able to be autoscrapped while crafting, but it needs to be protected from 'scrap all junk'. For that to work correctly, it would honestly only need an additional [IF itemClass=='bulk' THEN &lt;skip&gt;] within the 'scrap all junk' method, but then I'm not a developer...
---
You have sentinel assassin armor and rifle with as well?
---
Almost everything you find that is TSE is duped. If you look at Xbox LFG, they were just about giving them away. People have these squirreled away on multiple mules. They aren’t going away until a new God weapon is the weapon of choice. 
---
Your sarcasm just makes you look like a bitch. If you want, you can quote whereupon think his story doesn’t add up and I’ll explain why you’re wrong.
---
oh im sorry if that came across as condemnation other than calling it immature, it was sure as hell funny to me and my friend when we saw it.  i felt much less aggrieved after reading it lol  all in good fun 
---
You are wrong, the issue is how bethesda is counting the ammo. The email it self even says it isn't how much he currently has, just the amount that has gone through his inventory.
---
No idea. Never considered it not working. Just assumed it was working. I use these 2 underarmor's more so because of the look compared to the stats. 
---
These are the same idiots that constantly accuse me of hacking in Rainbow Six and Battlefield.
---
Maybe some people's brains just work better than others even when everyone knows the goal and has the same tools to get there.
---
I'm sure they can keep track of it, otherwise they would not ban for it anyways. I know Bethesda fucked it up hard and I'm angry at them to for making a bugged game like this, but I'm sure that this guy isn't talking 100% truth. There are some posts pointing out the suspicious things about his behavior, read them and choose who you believe yourself, I'm gonna quit this subreddit anyways, as all the shit going on here jsut makes me angry. Why would he trade so much ammo with his own account. Why would he randomly post his 'tutorial' post randomly just before he gets banned. Seems to me like this guy wanted to make himself seem like this trustworthy angel who put 900 hours into the game to get the whole subreddit behind him as a protection against banning. These are all just assumptions, but if somebody is likely to have committed murder, he will also be taken custody. 
---
Yes eventually by scrapping salvaged assaultron heads I learned the plan. 
---
look idc what you like or what anyone else likes in any game I'm just saying my experience. 
---
Not buying your story ... i get that you enjoy gaming the game ... but the world isn't as dumb as you expect it to ne and lies are a simple man's attempt at intellect ... first, if you felt the need for a 'mule' character it was because you were doing something you weren't supposed to be doing ... otherwise you wouldn't refer to it as your 'mule'. Second the numbers add up, you either duped or worked with dupers and i get it this game has been all but unplayable and gaming the game (i.e. figuring out and exploiting the various holes in bathesda's weak coding) has literally kept it alive for a large portion of the community, ammo is easy to get except the untracite stuff and it seems that's what you had an extravagant amount of, curious. Third, no you don't get 50× stable flex in an hour, sorry, maybe 20, maybe when white springs was a grinderfest (and yeah then i believe it for sure), fourth, did you say level 450 ... mmmmm hm ... sounds like someone took advantage of the exp/grenade trap glitch... and who cries this much ... sounds like you're staying a defense not defending yourself. I think you're dirty, i think you got caught, and i think you're trying to slime your way back into the game. Go game another game. 
---
From a day one player, who had access but not the opportunity to play the beta, who's played with dupers (given a full set of Cavaliers armor ... sold it to vendors ... not out of spite or disrespect, i just didn't need it and didn't feel cool profiting from an exploit, role playing as a good man in a bad world ... just like real life), anti-dupers (yeah), kids, adults, vets, rednecks, nerds (i got some nerd in me), wierdos (some of that too), noobs, you tube instructional video hackers, liars, pvp'ers, pve'ers, even girls, yeah ... women, and more. I've pvp'd, i've griefed (well i've provided support for griefers), i've grinded, i've farmed, i've server hopped, and i pretty well know what i know in the game. And you don't strike me as legit.
---
Just my perspective, mind you. I accept that it is just that and could be wrong. I don't think it is, and if it were my call I'd believe the data, not the prepared speech. If I am wrong i hope you're completely reinstated and given an apology, you deserve that. If this whole post is just slime (an attempt at deception, you being slippery, like a salamander to avoid being caught secretes mucus all over its slimy ass body) and you are that mucus coated bottom feeder, have fun starting over. 
---
I believe NO ONE who has over 100k of ANYTHING, but in these cases, they had over 100,000 of EXTREMELY RARE ITEMS.
---
They're all liars.
---
I really hope they do so its easier to trash peoples houses
---
The real tragedy is that you're playing fallout 76; I think they're doing you a favor.
---
An easy way to compare light, sturdy, and heavy categories for each type of armor. Maybe include mods like studded for leather, polished for metal or BoS for combat
---
Yeh I am done deal message me when servers back online GT Benrichardson17 
---
Ahhh, got ya
---
The most fine I have in this game solo is finding new players, usually below level 20, and giving them all my extra aid (stimpacks/purified water/etc...) so they can have an easier time in the wasteland.
---
Nobody asked for a PVP Fallout....
---
I'm almost level 100, I'll do whatever I can to help other players with the hope that they pay it forward.
---
Has anyone actually been banned unfairly. The only post I though had some validity, which was the guy who claimed to farm the game, now people are realising he was probably lieing. So I'm starting to believe no one was banned unfairly. Even people who have never duped but admitted to picking up tons of items dropped by dupers 
---
That’s amazing man, such low maintenance for such high power 👍🏻 how do you fight scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens though? They start attacking from quite a distance. Do you just dodge their projectiles and try to get close to them? 
---
Just wanted to let everyone know that I didn’t get banned. And I haven’t been duping? Is this a coincidence?
---
That is the problem, you don't actually have to have 100k of a rare item. Bethesda is miscalculating the numbers.
---
Read the email closely, those numbers aren't the amount he currently has, just the amount that went through his inventory over a 30 day span. With muling ammo back and forth those numbers can become EXTREMELY inflated very quickly.
---
They’ve been in maintenance mode since it’s release. 
---
I dont see the big deal in a lot of it. I wish duping never was a thing. It shouldnt have been. Bethesda dropped the ball there. I took on a merchant role early. I trade with a lot of people, some dupers, most not. But its a nuclear apocalypse and Im a raider merchant. Why would I care about the gear Im selling? 
---
I found a 3* executioner's .44 with faster reload the other day.
---
Is that a decent roll for a pistol build?
---
Exactly! Which is why I had to max out Luck to give me some reliably criticals. Not really the ideal build but it’s super fun 
---
Thanks for doing the test and even thinking of this. I never even considered a cap on move speed. 
---
PA paint.
---
How many people do you think use mules legitimately vs for exploits. I'll take the latter. Maybe 5% of the player base uses mules for legitimate reasons. 
---
So you made this camp though?
---
I was reading a lot at one point that there were people who were being banned for simply looting bags that a duper had left.
---
Also, being unable to appeal bans is weird. My Blizz account has been banned several times and I’ve appealed it successfully every time, because it was a mistake. 
---
Won't be here me till later still at work but I'll message you, my gamertag is deathcommando91
---
U/Valseek,
---
It would be easier if there was a double ended wall connector that passed through the wall, instead of the conduit type. 
---
Pressure plates will not work on second floor (not the same issue, but *really* annoying)
---
And please have them revisit the powered/keypad doors.
---
The logic is totally flawed.  
---
1.Keypad on wrong side, two electrical connections (one is hidden).  
---
2.You have to add an additional switch to operate from the other side, which the only logical switch to use is a pressure plate (being the only momentary switch available). This ties into the issue of pressure plates not placeable on upper floors.
---
#2 is easily fixed if you can make the delayed switch on the back side interactable.
---
Martial artist? That affects melee weapons.
---
The thing is this could actually happen because of the way duping worked. If someone doesn't subscribe to Reddit or Bethesda's forums (which accounts for 99% of players in any game) how should they know about the repercussions of picking up some items found in a world container?
---
That sucks dude.
---
I'm not interested in FO76 beyond bile fascination at how much Bethesda is fucking the dog, but if you like playing it and you're following the rules you definitely should be able to play it.
---
I do genuinely hope you get your account back.
---
I just still cant wrap my head around *this* being an issue in need of a quick fix. If its worth doing at all, then its worth doing right. 
---
Update was completed. Just wanted to see if maybe by some chance the game is up and running again. 
---
Look, dupers were technically playing by Bethesda’s rules. Bethesda made a game, the game features ways for you to duplicate weapons, so you duplicate weapons. The best Bethesda can do is patch the exploit and remove the items, banning is overkill. 
---
Now if the duper used mods or any outside source to cheat the game, then they’re shit out of luck, a ban is justified.
---
I’ll put it this way. It’s against the law to grow weed. Weed is a herb grown from the earth, yet the government has decided to regulate it. Now, they can come in, say “stop growing weed” and take all your shit. Then they lock you up for years in prison. Does that punishment fit the crime? Hell no.
---
That’s an extreme comparison, of course, because this is just a silly, piece of shit, boring video game. Who are dupers hurting in this PvE game? Who are weed farmers hurting? Make a bit of sense?
---
It incorrectly did. But they fixed it today 
---
About 300 hours in, found 2 two shots and one medics explosive, no TSE though
---
Have you tried wood armor? Maybe that's the purpose of it! Maybe they want to make it viable, since everybody complains about getting it.
---
TBH, I just don’t ever build the next floor till everything is place on the one below, so I don’t know what all goes up when you place it but, if memory serves; fusion gen, wall pass through conduit, PA station &amp; decon shower were the ones I had issues with. 
---
you can place your camp "in a tree". just stand in front of any tree and move your mouse slow forward, the camp will turn green(placeable) 3-4 meters higher than the ground. so you get one more floor in general. i used the same trick on my main char on the top of seneca mountain (astro panda) to get my castle high enough :)
---
I'll usually take a workshop for whatever material I need at the time.
---
Then hit a raider vendor, either closest to my workshop or Top of the World (closest to my camp)
---
Go to the Whitesprings train station and do a Whitesprings run.  Hit the trade cap at the Artisain shop (inside Whitesprings) and the enclave bunker (there's a door between the two).  Also sometimes people sell 1 star legendaries at Whitesprings so keep an eye out.  In the bunker pick up all the Technical data from the desks.
---
Port to Harper's Ferry to max out the Free State's vendor and enjoy his soothing voice.  Drop of Technical Data at BoS Camp.  (Camp Venture I think)
---
Port to Watoga Station.  There's a Stash box and tinkerer's bench here to do any inventory management you need.  Max that vendor then hit the BoS vendor.  Also there's a magazine and ammo pouch in the monorail, plus lot's of plastic in the high school if you need to bulk.
---
Finally, port to Vault 76 fo' free.  Now I just go to Grafton as that's the closest to the vault.  I used to go to Camden Park to do the dailies.
---
That's my vendor run plus all of the other useful stuff I do along the way.
---
bout to go tame a rickety cave cricket
---
I'm ok with the 9 points, because every other weapon is on the same system with the same benefit.  I feel like the stealth related perks need adjustment to provide more bonus for additional damage.  Yes, my melee character can smoke every ghoul in a whitesprings nuke in like 10 minutes while remaining relatively unharmed.  It's not fair or balanced whatsoever.
---
My exact feeling. I realise people can farm games, I use to farm destiny 1 for hours most days. But getting 100k rare items like ultra cite ammo or nuka colas, while theoretically plausible, is highly unlikely anyone would actually ammass that amount in a thirty day time frame
---
Have an AA combat rifle, think it has bash damage too. Have to look I haven't used it in awhile 
---
If you are looting 50k TSE shotguns, then yes, I guess you could get flagged. And I don't think that's unfair.
---
And generally, better when they come back up. (Barring minor issues, like the revert to old patch issue that was hotfixed)
---
Also fun fact: as of last week, my assaultron head worked fine and didnt eat extra fusion cells.
---
Thank you for doing this. Honestly. It is gratifying to know that these \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* get a taste of their own medicine and then are salty about it too. I hope you have more moments to be All Might. In the meantime, I'll leave the game uninstalled until I'm able to play in peace and not have to worry about being on the receiving end of a griefer in the first place.
---
I hope Bethesda takes note of how many people who love their games straight up quit their game because they didn't think through how many of them have zero interest in PVP given their single player game background.
---
Noob question what does bleschwood do? I'm lvl 72 haven't heard about this 
---
Watch the Down The Rabbit Hole video on "Chris Chan"
---
Your flux calculations are way off. I farm 100+ raw violet flux per SBQ.
---
Hate to say I told you so. Nah jk don't hate saying that at all.
---
Gaining XP only affects the person doing it, duping items messes with the in game economy and server stability and thus effects the community as a whole.
---
Making claims without evidence has been a pretty consistent trait in this subreddit.
---
try checking official channels first, [here](https://bethesda.net/en/status) is their server status page, game is still down as of this posting
---
Still no dlc? Still no mods? 
---
Disappoint
---
Lol thanks for reporting in. We have two guys mass crafting in the trade discord, so it's good to see the opposite effects on the community
---
Thanks :) i always laugh at my own jokes but though I'd share this one as it still makes me laugh it's that daft 
---
Do you not understand how console games work? Physical disc, whoever puts the disc in the console owns the game
---
The thing with that analogy is that I think the game tracks the total amount of items rather than picking up 25k over and over. That would still only register 25k ammo. With mules it's a different story. I never felt the need to use mules and don't know much about people with mules. I do know that players who have lots of mules are very sketchy. The game is suppose to be survival, being able to keep absolutely everything item you find defeats that purpose in my opinion, but ultimately if they want to play that way who am I to judge.
---
It's quite simple, every time people get banned for cheating some of them go on forums claiming to be innocent, they are full of shit every single time. I'm done talking to you so don't even bother answering.
---
Paging /u/Valseek because this is an important issue. I uninstalled Targeting HUD because of this a while ago, and it fixed the crashes (mostly), but now I always Get Out Of Dodge ASAP as soon as I notice a red hue on enemies, inconveniencing my session.
---
Agreed. 
---
Especially from the banned folks?
---
Like we’re all supposed to be in awe they spent 900 hours duping items and they’re entitled to compensation.
---
bout to channel my inner stephen king and build a dome of stash boxes to encompass my workshops
---
it took me 2 days to make the NCC-76-A, yes
---
I litterally laughed out loud when I saw the "What are those‽" example on the page.  It's still a stupid meme, but it is amusing that they used it as an example, in hopes to help simpler people understand the purpose/use of the interrobang.
---
...we really need better terms for in-game mods and mods to the game, this shit is getting confusing.
---
So now he could still do that. He could lock himself in the basement and be in the workshop zone and when you come to take it it will just be constantly in contested mode until someone picks the lock to get him or he leaves to go find you anywhere in the zone. But locking himself in the basement also means he can't collect the ammo being produced. 
---
This is something that actualy fking making me crazy. There is maintenance like every week just after i come from work. Mostly to night time.
---
Blizzard knew, its better to do patch in europe on different time than murica.
---
Well congrats its one hell of a base
---
Went out around 2.5 hrs ago I think. Possibly a bit more.
---
Hooray - Patch 6 has dropped.  I stopped playing FO76 and have been on Skyrim and FO4 for the last week. Time to go back and have another try at enjoying this game. 
---
You can enjoy it and still be completely clueless about what actual other players do that's incredibly common, like how to quickly and easily craft a ton of ammo **without* any dedicated time, same as pretty much everything else you loosely try to relate to duplication.. other players are just better than you, and that's why this is a non issue.
---
You can enjoy the game and be really bad at it and completely clueless as to core elements of gameplay- I mean, that's exactly what the case seems to be right now.
---
Fair, but I’m also a simple person. I see loot, and I loot until it’s empty and check the inventory to sort out later. 
---
People were claiming bans for looting and throwing it away after, so for me this was a red flag as it goes against how I play.
---
I would love to see indestructible Player Vendor terminals all in one central location.
---
Two Reasons:
---
1.  It will be super easy and fun to shop ALL of the Player Vendor Terminals in one central location.  You can even server hop to see everyone's shop in that new server.  Super easy, fast, fun trades.
---
2.  Player vending at camps will be a disaster.  There are already people having problems with other people blowing up their bases.  Now increase that ten times because they show up and didn't like your prices, your selection, or just decided "nope, no selling for you today".
---
Same here, my day off too :(
---
That‘s pretty good. I’m probably not the best person to ask because I could care less about having the strongest pistol.
---
My guns: 
---
I have a TSE Western, a Quad Explosive Western, a Stalker’s Western with a increase in VATS hit chance, and a Quad 10mm.
---
Honestly I always find myself going back to the Quad 10mm. It’s insane how much damage I can do per second and I basically never stop shooting. It really just depends on your play style and what’s fun for you. Unless you’re into PVP.  
---
There is a wood burning stove found in most cabins - almost always with a wood pile right next to it - which we can't use to cook.
---
You could do a Tesla Rifle Build with the automatic mod, along with a VATS/Luck build. Focuses on Taking down multiple enemies at once while being able to use a crit vs multiple monster (not sure). Since it hits multiple enemies a lot of the Luck perk cards would be fun in my opinion.
---
&gt; **Martial Artist:** Now only applies its attack speed bonus to melee weapons and no longer incorrectly increases the Gatling Gun’s rate of fire. 
---
You fcking never know what's a bug and what's a feature in this game. I woudn't be surprised if one day they fix nukes so you cannot launch them any more since it was abviously an exploit and it's doesn't make any sense to nuke a nuked world in order to generate more life species, what a nonsense?
---
The burden of proof is on the provider of the product or service, not the purchaser of said product or service. These players were sold a product and now they're unable to use it.
---
Bethesda's responsibility is to prove wrongdoing or refund the victims of their fraud.
---
Ok imma set a timer
---
If they keep the fire rate of the gatlibng gun the same as it would be with the perk on. I wiuld not have a problem.  A lot of ppl upgraded to prime and spend hours farming for its ammo. What not ?  For them  this will be a waste.
---
Liked the idea of Talon Company/Regulators and NCR Ranger Vets/Caesar Vets from previous games. That would definitely liven up Appalachia with a variant
---
*assuming* that's how it works - they overlook the fact that these same items are going back and forth between the same accounts - he would have to be regularly putting ammo back and forth between the two characters. What purpose would that serve? They identify two accounts in the email. Let's say he did have only 35k ultracite ammo, total between both accounts. He would have to trade the entire 35k to the one account almost 5 times, and almost 7 times to the other. Trading less than that increases the hand offs. If one is just a mule, why are you shifting such large amounts of ammo back and forth?  It just doesn't really make sense as to why he would do several passings of the same ammo. It's possible, but doesn't really make sense imo. Especially if one is your main, you aren't  going to be pulling tens of thousands of rounds because it's going to weigh you down. There are just a lot of variables at play. It could be that Bethesda made a poor oversight of mule accounts, but it's just as likely that this dude is a liar.
---
Im not sure either way. my post was intended to point out the flaw in the guys math and reasoning above me. 900 hour guy is just as likely to be guilty as he is innocent, based on what we've been presented. In any case, I hope Bethesda makes a statement on the accuracy of these accusations, and their algorithm. At the very least they should be transparent on what you pointed out; the fact that they may not be considering muled accounts. If muling is a violation of the tos, they should make that clear. I guess we'll see, but if Bethesda continues stonewalling so confidently, I'm going to lean on their side. Until now, anything that is even perceived as a possible issue has been addressed head on and repeatedly. So far we've only seen a couple comments from the CMs, both basically saying "if you were caught it's because you were shady, period." Obviously Bethesda isn't the most transparent, and I'm not going to automatically believe them, but this isn't really lining up with their usual MO when they screw up. I guess we'll see if it's mentioned in this week's Inside the Vault, as other major issues have been.
---
It wasn't in the original, he edited it in. So you need an archive between that edit and it getting deleted. I saw his original post and didn't see that image so that's what confused me.
---
If it works the same then in the same way you could be hiding somewhere in the workshop, and they would be unable to successfully claim it.
---
This answer is so tiring
---
Just that: claims.
---
Also, now it's impossible to pick up that many items at a time. You can't pick up more than 1500 over your max carry weight.
---
I drop alot of my excess junk in the suitcases at morgantown station after my plastic runs :).  I hope someone finds it useful!
---
I should have mentioned - I checked both spots thoroughly, after multiple log-outs and ins - all gone.
---
That is a different issue I think. We are unable to craft *any* hats whatsoever because the devs forgot to put the 'hats' category into the crafting menus. Easily fixable methinks?
---
He's lying to you, check the front page
---
Except nowhere is he lying, people are just misunderstanding what the email said. People are assuming the email said "You currently have 160k ultracite ammo". It doesn't, it says that that much ammo has gone through that characters inventory over a 30 day period.
---
So lets say you have 25k ammo and you need to clean out your stash so you drop the 25k ammo in your camp to make space to do some clean up and then you pick the ammo back up after doing the clean up. That ammo now counts as 50k ammo that has gone through your inventory in a 30 day period because it went through your inventory twice even though it wasn't actually 50k ammo.
---
That is why the 900 hour guy and bethesda both could both be telling the truth with their claims, one being "I've never had more than 36k of any ammo at a time" from the player and bethesda claiming "over 160k ammo has gone through your inventory over a 30 day period" because he muled it off and then later muled it back to his main character. Hell, it is why the numbers are so overinflated. Say he has 25k and mules it to his mule, and then back to his main character, by bethesdas counting, that shows as a total of 75k ammo, even though it was only 25k.
---
Takes a while to break into all our CAMPs to snatch up the TSE and ammos, they aint Santa.
---
Ah, thank you! I'd heard about this but never knew where it could spawn. The first, and only, time I fast traveled there I was surrounded by what appeared to be 2 random encounters of assaultrons, robobrains, mr gutsys, gulpers, and of course, the super mutants on the dam decided to join the fun. Barely escaped with my life.
---
No love for bumblebee?  Lol.  Seriously though I want some hot rod excavators out there, lore be damned
---
Lmao I remember when the duping started happening and I still don’t get it. Why ruin a game you paid for by not playing it correctly. Like y’all so insecure ab how bad you are at gaming you have to dupe to either have good loot or you sell it online cus you can’t get a job in the real world. For everyone that gets banned because you duped or played with dupers. Get guuuuuuuud, have fun at lvl 1
---
They aren’t full of shit every single time. Saying that is saying that is physically impossible for a human being to be falsely banned. That’s a lie. Why are you lying?
---
Did you read where the perk card said "melee weapons have faster swing speed?" Gatling guns are meant to be slow, MINIGUNS are meant to be faster lol. You're using the wrong gun
---
**stop talking crazy hahaha**
---
History also shows that I shouldn't just trust someone who is naked and behind me.
---
It's more the fact that items flooded the market and things went sideways really quick. Remember the posts of people selling weapons and nuka colas for real money. Shit like that is sad and duping basically encouraged that. It was the reason I stopped playing. I tried trading items and hit the cap very quickly. I tied looking for alternatives to caps and when people wanted to trade me nuka colas I just bowed out. If I spend time farming gear and finally have decent items to trade, I shouldn't be given dodgy forms in return. It defeats the purpose of ever being a small time trader.
---
I got a berserkers explosive .44. Closest i came!
---
Right. It might make for a bit of a stalemate, but at least that puts him at a disadvantage for being locked down there, rather than an advantage.
---
I think it'll help flush each other out and help engage in open PvP. At least this way it'll work more towards combat until someone gives up, rather than hiding until the other gives up.
---
But I guess we'll see how it goes.
---
You're not supposed to be able to stay cloaked while moving. You can glitch it by using the perk where you lose aggro by entering sneak and then removing the armor piece once you become invisible. Unless you use a stealth boy, then that's legit
---
I had to look up the “What are those” meme. Is it referencing Black Panther or is Black Panther referencing the meme? If I’m remembering the scene correctly Shuri asks T’Challa “What are those‽” about his shoes. 
---
Yep I can confirm, played about 9 hours before the servers went down, and I also get 4:8:2006 if I start the game now, and wait a bit.
---
Glad it's better for you. I could only play for 15 minutes last night. Two endless loading screens and i just closed out the app
---
Ehh yes.. I know. Still. Seems you arent getting the point
---
12 water purifiers
---
Was this bug that happened all of the time? I guess that I will find out when I log in again.
---
Yeah, I've never got 60 an hour out of it. I don't know what the number 5 reasoning is. 
---
Nuclear Material is rare?  Every other glowing thing I find has it - and there are a LOT of glowing things.
---
Why not tho lol
---
Fair enough, you're better at getting it than me. But even with that, the amount of stable flux needed is still there.   
---
I'll edit and account for that as an alternative  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aifiub/psa\_farm\_violet\_flux\_easily\_and\_effectively/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aifiub/psa_farm_violet_flux_easily_and_effectively/)  
---
Reckons 80, and I think if you account for other people farming it, it's a fair number to put in as an average.
---
ALL HAIL THE WISDOM OF A TRUE FOLLOWER OF THE MOTHMAN!!!
---
Except it doesn't, we know this for a fact already due to the fact bethesda has already said they can't tell individual items from one another, which means they can't tell which bullet is new and which is a bullet they have dropped to make room and pick back up after bulking stuff.
---
I think that you've had to many Psychobuffs...
---
Sure.  And don't forget the people who used the carry weight glitch!
---
And the fusion core recharge when log in glitch.
---
And people who serverhoped to farm caps staches.
---
And those who sell these overpriced golf outfits to the vendors!
---
Hell why not everyone? 
---
I agree that bethesda/zenimax are not affiliated with Reddit. That said why do people post breakfix issues for a program on social media?
---
If you’re saying you can’t ban folks from Reddit then folks complaining about breakfix issues should be. Doesn’t belong in social media 
---
Total, at any given point in 30 days. Meaning that if he went over 100k and maintained that amount in the last 30 days. Nothing implies that you had to *do anything* in that time period, just that you had something that is above that threshold.
---
Ah got ya. So you want one to build a camp near. I think that's because crystal isnt used for much is it? If you excavator armor thru lucky holes you should be set for a while and you can do it once a day I believe. 
---
Lolz, did u read the user agreement nub
---
Thanks u/bethesdagamestudios
---
Any chance of a Mac version some day?
---
GTFO with your silly outrage. It is clear the dude is obsessed with the game to an unhealthy extreme. He is definitely guilty of breaching TOS. I was suggesting alternate routes. All these ban waves have had a zero effect on me and my friends. Guess why
---
I thought he wrote up the guide after he was banned.  No?  If so seems fishy.
---
It will be much weaker. But It is still nice in heavy weapon category. Because most of heavy weapons are even more weak.
---
You thought that a Gatling gun was meant to be a strict upgrade from another weapon? Isn't supposed to work like that. Miniguns have the fire rate you want, just a little less damage
---
Oh no! u/vaulthunter98 is calling me a nerd! Of course I'm a nerd, we're all nerds here, who else would spend their free time on videogame subreddits. 
---
Why would that item count work like that . That would make no sense from Bethesda point of view and would just lead to more heart ache. Until some actually proves it by dropping 1000 rounds 100 times and gets a ban it's all just speculation. 
---
that's pretty awesome.
---
trying to create a duper's asociation?
---
I suppose they could leave coal for all the bad boys and girls, but that is actually useful in the game
---
&gt; It wasn't my beloved Witch Dress, was it?
---
Now removing that would be brutal. I have been searching so long to finally find that specific random encounter. But then, why wouldn't the plans have been intended to be available, as it's a Halloween costume? 
---
It's +1 str, +2 each end, int, luck.
---
Didn't he write that up after he was banned?
---
Sweet Jebus that is awesome!
---
Haven’t found either.
---
Well if they were too stupid to dump the grenades then they did get banned.
---
But yes they could just as easily ban players that have gotten a certain amount of XP in a short amount of time.
---
Drop 2k ammo in a chest and and get a friend to pick it back up again, both do that 50-60 times swapping and see if you get banned, will say for sure if it's true or false :)
---
I personally believe him, people find ways to farm shit fast when they play 10+hours a day.
---
But who really knows.
---
You're no better than people who create floating camps.
---
BoS is str and end, not per.
---
I got banned, I was duping, I care not because I play tonnes of other games. 
---
This.
---
People seem to forget that it's tracking over a 30 day period. Yes having or moving 100k + ammo sounds like a lot, but if you're playing the "end game" and spitting out thousands of rounds into the bullet sponge known as the SQ daily than it's not much.
---
Imagine the last time you fought the SQ, how many bullets you put into her? Must have been around 1-3k if you weren't just waiting for others to kill her. Now imagine you're a high level player who wants to grind her to dust for plans. You know where you can go to get the mats to craft bullets. Now you're killing her maybe 3-5 times a day easy, possibly even more. On the low estimate just on the SQ alone you can blow through 3k bullets per day. 3 x 30 = 90 000. 
---
That's not even including the amount of ammo you're spending on the minions or other SB she spawns. Or the stuff on the way to get the matts. 
---
Who knows maybe you want to stick around and waste ammo in the nuke zone killing the other SB cause hey, why the heck not? You're already there. Not mentioning the fact you might want to collect the flux from nearby plants.
---
The tracker also includes ammo transferred. So let's say your friend wants you to craft him some ammo after giving you the matts cause he might not have all the perks like you. He might be on an alt or just new. That's easily over 100k, going over 100k crafted ammo is nothing in 30 days.
---
"Ultracite ammo is rare" not at all if you've got 1-3 friends to help you gain matts and you're the guy crafting it for them. Moreso if you know what you're doing. Ammosmith, superduper, unyielding gear to boost the luck spec, which increases the chance of superduper going off. Plus getting double flux from green thumb. If you've got a crew for maybe 1/3 of your time playing fo76 and you play daily I could easily see anyone going over near twice the amount crafted ammo needed for the ban. Ultracite ammo is sort of rare, but at the end of the day it's still ammo. 
---
If you counted the average player rounds spent over a 30 day period if they weren't a melee build I can easily see the average being around 300-500k. If they're a late game player I'd imagine they'd be way above average. Probably in the millions just because the way the game works is higher level = more hp. So everything is a bullet sponge. 
---
Honestly I probably wrote too much
---
TL DR: If you haven't played late game fo76 you just don't understand how much ammo you can go through. 100k ammo in 30 days is not a lot. Even for ultracite.
---
Yeah thats true bro. I feel you. I have 5 people I play with so I would hit max and give them caps as I sold so wed all have caps and Id spend caps on gear we all needed but once Id outfitted us all in end game everything I got pretty bored myself. 
---
What do you mean? He’s had an extensive FO76 post history since launch essentially.
---
Don't try and make sense. They don't like that here, they just want to put bethesdas balls in their mouth without criticism
---
There is room for A LOT more than 800 per person, most servers have half the people playing now.
---
Dupers had literally millions of pounds each and the servers still ran OK, we could probably each get 10,000 and the servers would be fine.
---
They won't increase stash space for some strange reason known only to them, but it sure as hell isn't because they are at the hardware limits.
---
:D
---
This happens to me alot with all manner of creatures. Not only legendaries. They'll just fall through the map
---
When it's on PA it's a mod
---
30k is a bit much but I have quite a few. Only because I have used none of them. I can't seem to get past the collecting things of previous fallout games. But when I do break them out it will be Bobblehead Mania!
---
Back in 07/08, over a year I was playing LotRO for an avg of 18hrs a day, it's very believable to play 10.
---
What you do in that time is another matter, I'm not far enough in FO76 to say how easy or not it is to make or find ammo! But 900 hours in 97 days is believable to me
---
Agreed, 800 is slightly better and all but significantly less then what I wish we had, or what would even make it worthwhile to go hunting armor sets ect.  As it stands is near impossible to hold onto most good legendaries you find because you dont have the space to keep them, the stash should be at least 2k.
---
I take it this is *not* the patch that will restore suspended player accounts then?
---
I use the favorite tag on my armor. If it has a heart, then I know it's something I wear.
---
No, I don't have any.
---
You must have missed my TLDR at the end.  Probably because it was too long and you didn't read it :)
---
I did not actualy. Someone else told of this today. All this time I thought the weapon had a good fire rate by its own
---
But is ok,  clealy you never used martial artist before... so lets just agree to disagree here.
---
I really don't think Bethesda can prove that you duped those items. If you are working multiple characters it makes sense how your numbers could be ridiculously high. Bethesda is just a really shit company right now and I hope they don't return to the multiplayer market anytime soon.
---
I once ran across a suitcase that had hundreds upon hundreds and I mean A LOT of items in it......I wonder if they were duped and I caught a ban for picking them up.
---
It took me about 250 hours to get my first explosive shotgun, and it is a troubleshooters. Just because it took you longer doesn't mean that mine is not legitimate. You do not represent all fo76 gamers.
---
There are 2 different Marine helmets. The **Tactical** one *should* still be fine after the patch, the one they are likely referring to is the Marine **Armor **Helmet which could only be obtained via the dev room, and when scrapped gave you the crafting recipe for it. 
---
Yeah though people are talking about something  you can craft, like ammo, using perks that increase the number like ammosmith and super duper. Using materials that you can acquire through a number of means, farming, workshops, friends and trade. Not really the same thing. Then factor in people who play upwards of 10 hours a day.
---
That’s me. 
---
I don’t check this sub that often and had no idea about duping. Someone asked if I was cheating while I was using pharma farm, so I started checking this sub more. 
---
Today, I’m just learning to not pick up items that’s a crazy high amount. Go figure. 
---
Copies of C++ for dummies as well.
---
True. But it was fun bug. :)
---
You paid $300 to get that canvas bag?  Wow, you really have money to burn.  Or, you know, you bought it for the game and the helmet and got both, and are being unnecessarily salty about a cheap add on that due to the advertising department failing to drop a word accidentally listed incorrectly.
---
Being banned my be something that saved your life. Loving games is great, spending 900 hours in Fallout76 already is probably dangerous to your health and life.
---
dont those multiply together i remember some one saying it was like 174k or 1.74m
---
I could be wrong, but I think that swapping stuff to a mule could be a violation of the TOS: if it triggers the 100k in 30 days for rare items it will result in a ban/suspension.
---
Your analogy would be saying I committed a felony. I did not.  What i did was dispose of some junk i took off of someones body. Now lets say i was a random newbie playing and found ass loads of junk i needed laying around. What would i do? Take it. Bethesda should have handled this differently. I tried doing the right thing and bethesda spat on it. One would think with their dwindling player base they would try to keep the last few players active. But im pretty sure they want to forget all about this piece of shit they call a game.
---
I don't have an extra copy of the plans to give you, but I can make you a dress if you're on XB1.
---
I’ve only found a two shot explosive minigun in my game time and I immediately traded it off for a two shot explosive Gatling gun
---
I still use that gat to this day
---
That is what I'm saying.... everyone's arguing if its doable or not. No one step back and said .... hey is that realistic for a player to just to spend all their time farming ammo ? especially ultracite  
---
T::DR - Didn't read.
---
Yes, I used every legitimate applicable means of getting as much as I could. What I did not do was server hop to intentionally farm it, I just fully explored areas that would have it and picked it up every time I encountered it.
---
What parts? Be specific
---
Ok, thank you that would explain one instance, not a PA user myself so was unaware, 
---
No buffs to the Two Shit. 
---
Oh yeah I hate that when mobs are outside the event area and you go out to get them and you get the 'leaving the event area' warning. Or I go to clear enemies from a workshop and they're under the world. I love it when I have a workshop completely barricaded but mobs still get inside. Or you can have people fast travel into your workshop using the glitch. Once I had Sunshine Fields completely barricaded and a dude in PA got inside and claimed it. But no, Bethesda, don't fix those problems. 
---
For M.Queens just go full LeeRoy Jenkins and close the gap and 4-5 PowAttacks and it's down.
---
For the SBQ it's a waiting game till it lands, then much of the same.
---
I know people who do more damage with more complicated melee builds using low heath/high rads or/or legendary armour but In full PA I'm super tanky and do plenty of damage. For a general idea of my build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f33b888&amp;d=ss2sn2sm2s42e60em1l71lu2lt2s72a04i44c13c62c81ce0p90p80pa0id2sg2&amp;w=lm2if1iq2ie2ih2&amp;n=GROGNACK%20THE%20TANKBARIAN (on mobile at work so formating stuff is hard)
---
Not a mistake.  He cheated, it has been proven.
---
Have they fixed the Garb of Mysteries not unequipping your individual armor pieces yet?
---
Maybe steel ive picked up about 5k of steel in a about 4 or so hours though scraping everything before going why am I so heavy?
---
Watch out of shills taking about how awesome wood armor is!
---
Personally, I'm really, really excited that everyone will be able to see a pork 'n' beans icon next to my name.  The amount of people that were banging down bethesda's doors because others couldn't see their little knife or ghoul icon must have been substantial.
---
You are missing the fact he is level 400, he easily could switch the ammo off and on due to respeccing the character after patch nerfs such as the TSE nerf, and it is over a 30 day period. 
---
In one month someone who puts 10+ hours into a game a day could easily need to move that much ammo on and off the character as they switch from one build to another. 
---
It is already been shown by bethesdas statements that they are counting the ammo as every time it is added to your inventory, due to the fact they have no way of telling unique items apart. They can't tell if the bullet is a new one or one he muled off, or dropped in camp to make room to bulk craft to make more space in his stash.
---
The problem lies in the fact they are using miscalculated numbers t ban people. Also, so what if someone has 100k of an item, if they weren't detected duping then they shouldn't be banned just for having a lot of an item(within reason) ESPECIALLY ammo, I mean hell, how many legit traders have been hit? 
---
It wouldn't be hard to get well over 100k of a type of ammo to go through a characters inventory if they trade ammo a lot, some people use ammo as a form of currency so over 30 days it wouldn't be hard for a trader to get well past 100k of ammo to go through their inventory just from normal trading. That is roughly 3,000 bullets a day traded. If you think people couldn't trade 3k bullets in a day you've obviously not looked in the trading subreddit.
---
Armour like reactive plates for power armour that reflects attack damage. I think the issue is it is not labelled as punishing in fo76 while I understand it was in previous games. 
---
I don't know but I like the subject line :D
---
I got a similar bug, my binocular display 11 damage. 
---
and specifically, i know with pass-through conduits and fusion generators, it's not that you can't place them; they turn from red to green, you hit 'enter' and they're gone -- you go upstairs and they snapped to the floor/wall above where you placed them. so you end up stashing all the parts of your camp above them, place them, then rebuild
---
Alright thx for the reply. Ima wait for more replies and make a poll. I’ll update the results on this post.
---
I'm on PS4 so I have no access to mods. 2/3s of the community doesnt at this point. Not to mention Targeting HUD and berry mentats were the point of my post. 
---
Arnt those grenades sorta crap? i made some and they just go fizz... 
---
I absolutely think most of the posts about being banned unfairly are actually cheaters/liars. I also absolutely would have zero surprise if it turned out Bethesda accidentally banned half the playerbase. And considering many people paid hard earned money for this game, multiple copies, sometimes upgrades to make the game work properly on their pc's etc. I think you should grow up and you owe them an apology. They have a right to be skeptical. 
---
Good and helpful post but I don’t think you needed to be cunty about the dupe hunters. It’s fun to hunt dupers and lay them out over voice chat. I haven’t come across many but when I have I’ve dumped all that junk somewhere they wouldn’t find it, one time at the bottom of the mirelurk queen pond in the red area.
---
Assuming every human being on earth who has ever said they hunt dupers and dump the stuff where no one will find it is a liar, is a sure way to make you look and sound like a cunt. Don’t do it. Just make a normal post without lying and trying to stir shit up.
---
outrageous :P
---
Ugh.. pitty Im bring downvoted. Since um sure almost everyone use this weapon.
---
Yeah happens sometimes... shittiest moment was when me and some others killed the sorchebeast queen and she despawned/glitched out....
---
Because it’s after an update and they need time to implement the changes on the servers , settle down.
---
You wait till you pellet dash the wasteland. 
---
Yeah I'm totally incensed about it. Hopefully you and your friends aren't bed ridden at the moment. You can enjoy your game and have a little sympathy. You don't have to, but you could. 
---
That's how the cheaters who've been banned think Bethesda is counting the ammo, but it's not likely how it's being counted. In Beth games items have a ref ID and a quantity. Two stacks can't have the same ref ID unless they were duped. A stack with the same ref ID being transferred between two players isn't going to trigger the ban because there's still only one stack that can be tracked by ref ID. Stop bending over backwards for cheaters.
---
Fucking goddamn splash damage from the two shits. Nerf it already!
---
Lol it says melee weapons, not Gatling guns. You knew it was gonna be a waste when they fixed the bug tho
---
I don’t work for Bethesda. I’m not the one that owes those people an apology,
---
The email doesn't say he has 100k of a single bullet, just that that much went through his character in a 30 day span. That is the point, read the screenshotted email again, or read any of the other shared emails. They all state it the same way.
---
See, now you can never say that this game was inconsistent. 
---
I have assassin/ sentinal chest piece, got it legitimately, as in found on legendary corpse. Not everyone is a cheater. You are basing opinions around your rng. You state no facts.
---
You're
---
Omg they fixed the snowball fight emote. I have one friend that would spam it when we were trying to build. Thank you Bethesda!
---
They have been saying that about a ton of stuff,  it's becoming to late for a lot of the player base and people are just leaving the game.
---
I had originally, then I scaled it way down to just hard to acquire outfit sets. Now I can expand it back out again
---
Go to ams testing site in the South West part of the map, and make sure you're wrong excavator armor. Look at the Rock wall you spawn next to, you'll find plenty of iron right there, head East along that wall and you'll find 5 lead ore nodes. Go south along that area, keeping an eye on the walls facing north along with the edge above them and you will find plenty more ore. Pay attention to the path you take.
---
Switch servers and grab all of that ore again, you can include lucky mine if you're not finding enough of the lead deposits which are harder to spot, but you'll find plenty of iron which is the most expensive part of crafting ammo- the steel you'll need is absurd.
---
If you don't have enough gun powder you only need a little bit of acid and paper to make it, you can very quickly make far far more than you'll ever need so I suggest you do this last and make it in batches.
---
Otherwise the only thing you need is acid, the ammo crafting perk and super duper equipped. If you don't have enough acid it takes very little effort to capture the workshop West of the water park, it has 3 acid resource nodes and can quickly solve any acid issue. But most players have acid unless they already know how to quickly farm for ammo.
---
Considering how the front page has 900 hours guy and then multiple posts directly attacking him, I would say it's less that people want balls in their mouth and more that Bethesda, like every other company that's aware of Reddit and its influence, is actively working to turn the discussion from "Bethesda banning long time players" to "Bethesda is great and never makes mistakes like this"
---
Yup! Kill the mole miners and other enemy by White Springs and Welch and you’ll be over before killing them all usually! 
---
The nuke key cards do have weight like 1 lbs each . Which is why somebody probably dropped like a hundred of them still having that many nuclear cards it's too many
---
has someone been selling duped stimpacks? just found out i'm having the 4:8:2000 and while i'll admit i'm carrying a lot of shit around (that's what my power armour is for) it's just stuff I've found here or there or bought from shops... pretty annoyed TBH not sure if i'll come back to 76 or indeed Bethesda.
---
Didnt Rose not make it? 
---
Yep. They need to tweak the ability to shoot through windows too.  I've tried shooting through the broken windows at the munitions factory and it doesn't work half the time. That would be funny if you could throw a nuka grenade in the window and blow him up hahaha
---
You’re right, the don’t have to share anything. But it does gain them something.
---
I argue that the philosophy of sharing nothing is what led us here. To a sub where thousands of their most vocal players and thousands of dedicated haters are wrapped in another fucked up debacle about this game.
---
Regarding any specific case, I don’t have the information to make the final judgment. If the numbers they listed for the 900 hour guy actually represent how much unique ammo he had, it seems like exploring. If the numbers show how much he *picked up* then don’t tell the full story. I don’t know.
---
But regarding the state of this company’s fan base, lack of transparency and communication about its priorities and practices is a major issue. 
---
Stepping from a single player game to a multiplayer “game as a service” model is a huge transition and even without that, gamers are increasingly holding companies accountable as time goes on. The internet has changed a lot since Fallout 4 and people expect more.
---
I'm a bloody melee user, so yeah I definitely do use it. It says "increases melee attack speed" not Gatling fire rate
---
not the original coommenter here but"more ammo he could have ever gotten legitimately" want to prove that? no, math about how much time it would've taken isn't proof of anything, as long as the number of ammo he has is legitimately possible to obtain in a 30 day span then, you have more work to do to prove to anyone that he's a cheater.
---
This is by no means a guarantee, but I've been moving tons of stuff between my main and alt account for around a month now and neither have been banned. I scoured the TOS for assurance, and, based on MY interpretation, there is nothing that even mentions having a separate account, so I *THINK* you should be fine. 
---
Oh it's definitely very few, but they shouldn't lose their second accounts due to cheaters. Just ban people using mules to cheat and let the few who use them legitimately keep them.
---
Some mods, or even some decent PA skins in the Atom Shop, would be nice about now.  I'm bored stiff and I'm only level 70.  Nerfed weapons don't add additional interest value.  IMO you REALLY need to add some more content.  The Cranberry Bog is pretty much empty and the Ash Heap isn't much better, only even less pleasant to travel in.  Playing FO4 again has shown me how much fuller, fun, interesting and more complete that game is. There's always something to do or build in 4, particularly with all the mods available to keep things fresh.  There's nothing much to do at all in 76.
---
Yeah it is also described as a “legendary” effect, really poor wording by Bethesda, it also doesn’t explain how it’s happened to me when I never wear PA 
---
100 lockpicks wasn't duped. That was someone who just habitually picks up everyone they see, suddenly realized why they are so over weight, and just dumped all of them but like 10 in the nearest container.
---
Its poor subreddit moderation at it's finest.
---
&gt; Increased Stash Limit: We’ve once again buffed up maximum Stash size, this time from 600 to 800 
---
Yay now I can start playing the game again
---
I'd like to think a dev thought that CRANKING the gun was melee oriented and made it perk effected lol
---
I'll just enjoy my badness while my betters whine about their bans then.
---
This is actually a West Virginia landmark. Lots of old hill stories about Source Rock. 
---
6 is 6 times banned ;)
---
Great, thanks!
---
Bethesda has already stated they can't tell the difference between unique id's which is why they are unable to just delete the duped items.
---
I'm going by what bethesda themselves have stated, not cheaters. 
---
The ref ID would change as soon as any bullets were added or removed from the stack, so the fact it was moved to a mule would change the ref ID if the mule had any of that ammo type on them.
---
Also ammo doesn't work that way anyways. 
---
Here from r/all. This game seems like it's even more of a shitshow than it was at launch. Is that true?
---
Who is playing this game 10 hours a day every day?
---
I mean sure if you wanna apply a head canon reason to it. Similar to what they did with the M79 haha
---
Someone did the math in another post in this subreddit and I really have nothing to prove, he's been banned, if he wants to claim he is innocent he needs to prove it, and he hasn't. 
---
Well thanks man!  I actually only recently bought fo76, and I've actually been enjoying it so far.  I was thinking about putting a post up of my experiences later, but I might hold off till I use this roadmap.
---
Because it involves their microtransactions so obviously takes precedence over actual game issues.
---
Yeah, you wont get any closure for that kind of thing here.
---
But the situation right now helps no one. Talking and disagreeing can be good, but yelling "brainwashed by Beth" or "liar" can't. The Sub is strickly bad right now, and no one seems to have a realistic picture of whats going on.
---
And very few are actually talking about the game.
---
This has been a bug since day 1 it feels like
---
I ran into a wendigo in the upstairs room at Mountainside B&amp;B once.
---
I farm for them in a few spots with the perks.  Takes me about 30 mins and get about 50 each run. So it is possible to get alot( think I had at most 1k at once), but not 100k in a month
---
I get that; same with real life, there is a proper way to have discourse with someone. I 100% agree with you that "OmG yOu BeThESDa FaN BoY i never duped but i got banned anyways this game sucks" isn't a proper way to talk. But not having discourse makes the environment susceptible to the opinions if the loud, and the unapologeticly wrong.
---
(I got tired writing like the Spongebob meme so i stopped)
---
Your crappy post is why you owe them an apology.
---
Upvoted and agree, they should at least have a 2 hour countdown when they are going to take down that server.
---
They fixed other methods of duping. Not this new one. 
---
I actually just realized why, too: duper hunters. They *need* to punish people who violate the TOS. Sadly, this same method *might* ensnare some vigilantes. 
---
In fact, as it is now, if you really want to damage the player base, you'd buy another copy of 76 and go in and dupe **TONS** and then drop bags in highly trafficked areas. Unsuspecting players (mostly console as they tend to be out of the loop/not check inside the vaults or Bethesda posts) would pick these up and then be flagged.  
---
If you farm the SQ daily with a crew and you're the one crafting the ammo it isn't that hard to double the amount needed for the ban. Ammosmith, super duper, green thumb? All things that make crafting ultracite ammo easier. Least not forget people can kill the SQ multiple times a day and the tracker is crafted ammo over 30 days. It's easily possible.
---
No TSE here but, I did find a Instigating explosive pump shotgun. It is amazing.

---
President kimball approves this message
---
Yeah because it should be true. If you think the dev wouldn't fix a bug like that after fixing bugs like that then you're an idiot
---
Also a bad way to put things, since as in the real world ignorance does not mean that you are not subject to laws.  
---
&gt; it's not at the door when you enter but when you reach the vault door and get inside the area with robot npc's.
---
You're entering it wrong (TM). Who goes through the main door every time? But you are of course right, the Bunker is a laggy mess and I often get the lovely rubberbanding effect inside. Maybe the ceiling turrets inside could be turned *off* by default and only activate once someone goes rogue on the bots?
---
I’ve saw a workshop unowned yet the workbench was blocked by cement walls no way to claim workshop
---
Guessing the exploit item being removed is the marine combat helmet. If so any chance we will get it back in some propper way in the future.   
---
CAuse quite frankly the game lacks military headgear. To many civilian cloths not enough military. 
---
Everything is viable until you enter a nuke zone. Beyond the radiation resist power armor and hazmat suits have further resistance to environmental radiation
---
I could definitely get 100k worth of steel in 30 days without a doubt.    Wanting to put the time in to do so is an entirely other matter.
---
This leads to new questions though.    How do you store that much?    Why do you need 100k when 10k or 1k in storage, why collect more then you can use to service your immediate needs?     Personally I have had 1300 steel in storage at times and I look at it and ask myself why do I need so much?   I end up collecting more and tossing it.   If I'm not using the first 1300 steel why add 300 more.
---
I feel like enough of a hoarder with 6-7k of 5.56 ammo in my stash.   I cannot imagine 100k+.
---
On his other post, his guide, he mentions that he’s disabled and home from work until he recovers.
---
That’s your opinion, you’ll get no apology from me.
---
Why would they come find me, when they can sit somewhere until I get tired of waiting, or come to them? This completely negates any benefit for me to build defenses, or them to try to circumvent them.
---
Or why contest it at all? I can just come back after they've left and hide until they get bored of looking for me.
---
I believe they're talking about the Reactive Plates mod for Power Armor.  It's where when you're struck by an enemy with melee it reflects 50% of the damage back on the attacker.  It was causing people to unintentionally go into PVP mode when they were set to passive.
---
Example:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8n7ts/problem\_with\_reactive\_plates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8n7ts/problem_with_reactive_plates/)
---
I don't have this mod on my power armor, but I have the electrically charged mutation (the big electrical splash when I get hit by melee).  I never had that trigger PVP, and I've done a LOT of whitesprings runs.  I'm curious if Plague Walker does radiation damage to nearby players even when in passive.
---
Wow, fantastic!  I've been feeling bad, tossing cool weapons that I've found like broadsider, railway rifle, etc because of lack of space and now I can switch things up a bit.  Honestly, I'd love to have more like 2k storage weight but I'll take what I can get.  
---
I'd be willing to to pay extra for increased storage weight, along with a perk card to allow me to fast travel while encumbered, hint hint, Bethesda 
---
I've killed myself a couple of times with MIRV grenades that hit something and bounced back at me. They're pretty powerful. 
---
By this point, I am not sure I am missing any mods at all for every armor type.
---
BOS Combat armor outperforms by a rather large margin any other armor type in the game.
---
Trapper makes a great levelling set at 35/45 because it has good all around resists to include some radiation. The mods as crazy cheap and it's cheaper to repair than other sets.
---
Marine armor looks amazing. Repair costs are ok, uses rubber, asbestos and plastic though. Stats are better than regular Combat Armor. The radiation resist will keep you alive long enough to run out of a nuke zone you logged into. I put muffled on the arms/legs and Deep Pocket on the chest for my stealth build.
---
Wood armor is actually fun to play with. You get shadowed by default. The stuff is stupid light, and repairs are basically free. Only 1 star legendaries (sucks). I would not use it in anything other than a stealth ranged build, and even then only for the occasional fun.
---
Everything else is kinda meh. Yeah it's there for variety. But there is a reason (outside of immersion/rp) you dont see people running around in robot armor, etc.
---
I tend not to repair any armor while I am "levelling" up to my final legendary set. When it breaks, scrap it and hopefully learn a mod. Throw on the next piece you have for that slot and keep moving. 
---
I agree but they say it’s a violation to pick one up but they don’t enforce it or they literally can’t tell 100% if you got one in a drop or not. 
---
Yes, because he doesn't have that much and never did, thats the point. Bethesda is counting the ammo that is added to your inventory. So if you mule 25k ammo over to a mule to make space to bulk craft junk to make space and then mule it back over later that 25k ammo gets counted twice towards the 100k cap over 30 days.
---
It's funny how we can't destroy those structures, but mole rats? No problem. 
---
we got a live one boys 
---
That's why I wonder if people using Mules are telling the truth.  If you had 5000 rounds for a gun.  You were using that gun but decided to play something else so you trade the gun and ammo to the mule.  But over the span of the month if you do something like that 20 times you trigger the limit right?  What if its 5 guns with 5000 ammo that you're switching around.  That only takes 4 moves.   
---
I have a feeling the truth lays somewhere in the middle. I don't trust the cheaters, but I also don't get why anyone is giving "we ran out of canvas" Bethesda any sort of benefit of the doubt.  They need to earn that back. 
---
There's also a mutation that shocks melee attackers too. Not sure if that would so enough damage to kill and make you wanted though.
---
I used a few when I got the plan, and it seems like there was just one explosion.  I didn't know if they split apart in the air, or all came out of the hand like a grenade shotgun blast.
---
you could get hundreds of thousands of items from xp glitch 
---
I’m trying not to fast travel as much anymore, I feel guilty when I do knowing I could’ve stumbled onto something great 
---
I found a tse rifle about a month ago, but that's it. Over 300 hours of play. 
---
I don't see anyone whining, I'm not whining, and I'm also not banned, so I truly have no idea what you're talking about. I'm simply pointing out that half of what you say must involve duping and doesn't require any dedicated effort is you being paranoid and/or delusional. This is an opportunity for you to grow as a player and have something you can offer the community, besides a bunch of complete bullshit.
---
Same here. It’s stunning 
---
Yeah, I tried a grenade. It just bounced off and then we had a little *shitshitshit* moment while running away from it :(
---
How do you come up with that? Pretty sure after you finish the quest she just sits up at Top 'o the World rambling into her microphone waiting for more Raider content to be added. 
---
Checked the post history of 900 hour guy, he seems like he is an honest, good person. Who wants to bet i get downvoted? Also can anyone tell me why they think he's not telling the truth?
---
Your post is misleading.  This email is from one specific case, one which I would assume has already been appealed.  This is their response to the appeal, right?  Where they say no further appeals will be accepted?  Why don't you post the email you personally received and see what it says about appeals?
---
Yeah, but that's if you saw it before you picked it up. Preview only shows the first 5 lines of items. 
---
Very nice 👍🏻 I’ve been playing it strictly like a first person shooter game (I don’t even use VATS, only aim and shoot when I see the creature). I’ll try the first-person slugger route next! 💪
---
I have some relevant diagrams for your research: [https://imgur.com/a/QO6SVPc](https://imgur.com/a/QO6SVPc)
---
I wonder why anyone would think a bunch of bandwagon "I got banned unfairly" posters are either fake posts for manufactured outage, or actual cheaters crying innocence?
---
For example that he didn't notice the weight of the ammo. He was acting like he had a well planned out build and wants to tell me he isn't able to read the description of perk cards. I don't think this guy is so stupid. Another thing I don't believe is, that he didn't have as much ammo as was stated in the mail. I don't think Bethesda would be so stupid to make trading like this able to ban you. I don't have an account to spare to test this myself and see if i get banned, but no company with more than one person working on a piece of code would probably notice such a HUGE mistake. We are not talking about a small bug, but about the obvious mistake of trading ammo seeming like items were created. 
---
Yeah BoS is just too good. Need a trapper or robot equivalent.
---
Yeah, he claims it as his image in this thread as well anyway. 
---
If the amount of dog food obtained in a month is under 300, how can people obtain 100000 items which are classified as rare in that same time.  Wouldnt that mean that dog food is rare?
---
It's live now
---
Some great ones on there. I also enjoy getting burned out vehicles in my shots 
---
there are level-requirements on weapons in F76 :) So the higher leveled' mobs you kill, the higher level weapons you will get up until level 50, that's as high as weapon- and armor levels go at this point. You can craft higher damage-weapons as you level up too. Side-note: modding' is completely different in F76, it's ..whew it's a tough one, but if you bring along _all_ the weapons you can get your hand on and scrap them, you'll be good (you only learn mods by buying plans or a chance to learn a new mod for a type of weapon when you scrap it).
---
Assuming that you are telling the truth, I really hope you get some help with this issue and get your access to your account back. I am willing to bet the vast majority of people whining here did in fact dupe, but it is very likely that at least a few innocents got swept up in the ban wave.
---
Add the legendary AP's!
---
Melodramatic much?
---
Rich people(probably from being passed down), streamers, or people on welfare. 
---
Also I used to work from home and I would play games all day while working side by side.  
---
Some people have different situations than others lol 
---
PErsonally think some diseases should have follow up stages, like the blight eventually becoming the scorched plague, rad worms eventually becoming symbiotic worms.  
---
Some would be good others bad. The longer you go with out cure the worse it gets, or better. With that add bed rest to cure all but the worst. 
---
Yes, this exactly. I was getting really frustrated with these things last time I tried to build a new CAMP.
---
Why do you think we don’t have welcome mats for our camp?
---
Haha yeah haven't played now for about 2 months  and last night on my way to bed got an email saying I was banned. I in fact never duped or anything associated with it. But however I've received over 100,000 items on hand that were duplicated!?! I have around 10k ultracite 5.56 rounds I had bought off another reddit user. I'm lvl 147 on my main and 2 lvl 60+. This was the final straw with this game. I lost entertainment from the game because they were to caught up with glitch updates opposed to actual stuff to do. Now this okay. Dont think I'm going to even try to get my account back. Might just take it to ebgames as a donation because let's be Frank they're paying you just giving the game away now
---
I have a travelling/exploring build that has all of the weight reduction and carry boost perks, and explore in excavator armor. Carry weight is around 400, and most of what I carry is at least 50% reduction. Some like ammo and junk are around 90% IIRC.
---
A very different build from the group build that I run with friends.
---
Are they referring to "Return %50 of damage back to the attacker while blocking"? Nevermind, they specifically refer to armor....
---
Same here.   I've found  a few 2-shot weapons and a one-shot explosive 5.56 automatic rifle.  Most of my good weapon finds have been from 3\* creatures in the wild.
---
And this is why this sub is a fucking joke and a cancerous as fuck: downvoted for calling out silly conspiracy theories.
---
Yes, it’s “corporate espionage” (which I encourage everyone in this thread to look the definition of since, if anything, this is alleged and pathetically aspired marketing sabotage) and not releasing a game that was broken from all angles and had no long-term longevity that caused it to be a failure.
---
Bethesda fanboys are the fucking worst.
---
Already the top sticky on the front page. 
---
The meme predates the Black Panther movie and was started by a young black man loudly asking that question about an officer's shoes; it seemed a mix of disrespect towards the officer in a way that wouldn't get him arrested as well as a way of making light on the situation.
---
Prosecuted for what? For doing nothing. I don't think so.
---
I think that’s why I enjoy it so much, I’ve actually done a college course on coding and don’t understand how this happens. 
---
Are you only 19 years old...?
---
That's what happens when you contract dysentery.
---
TheMonsterMath! 
---
While it is being pointed out that dog food is not crafted, the fact still remains that I found less than 300 while people who have been banned had, in some cases HALF A MILLION of very rare - SUPER rare - ammo in their inventory.
---
Is my flight canceled or did I get put on the no-fly list?
---
I understand my flight isn't until a few hours from now, but I tried to board an aircraft and was refused.
---
As far as I know, people get refused for being put on the no-fly list.  Am I on the no-fly list or do I have to wait for my flight?
---
I avoided all bans by not buying this pile of garbage. Maybe the man will learn from this and make a better multiplayer game in the future that is actually worth a shit. Or not. To each their own though. 
---
Which is why I stopped defending and now wait till it's in a reclaim state,  go there kill the 1 wave and get the workshop back.
---
They are to broken to use properly this isn't fixing any of that in any way.
---
I like the fusion core change.  It drove me NUTS that it would take a 100 charge core out of my inventory when I had a 39, 45, and 75 core just sitting there eating up space.
---
However I'm NOT a fan of how fast fusion cores drain.  I've completely stopped using Power Attacks during queen fights for that reason.  I hate farming for cores, and I don't really want to do workshop PVP with the ability for people to "contest, fast travel, and insta-gank you".
---
I think the "contest workshop anywhere" is going to be a problem.  I didn't use the Munitions Factory (for reasons listed above), but I know people that do like to.  How the F are you supposed to protect it with turrets when they can contest from the furthest corner of the build area?  You can't.  There's no deterrence.  You'll have to PVP even more at workshops now.  Before you could wall it off, and put a bunch of turrets around the bench to do some "passive defense" that would deter people.  Nope, not anymore....lol  Good thing I'm not a fan of workshops since all the nerfs right?
---
Having some atom shop texture issues that went away a while back. my fat man paint job is flat purple instead of aviator, my shag flooring is MIA.
---
I was permanently banned
---
Enjoy your free pose and your mothman stuff
---
but you could
---
Oh my bad, my Reddit app did not updated the front page, I gonna delete this
---
If they are talking about the PA mod they’ve done a really shitty job of it,
---
I also have electrically charged mutation but there’s no way that’s what killed the guy that attacked me, and I was in regular armor,
---
In 30 days, how much ultracite ammo could you get? Could you get half a million like the "300 hours" guy had?
---
At least one duping method seems to have been fixed with today's patch. 
---
It really isn't worth it for any single player, but for my group of friends it usually felt like it was worth the little bit of effort it took.
---
What's funny is that people have been questioning "why would you have x amount of y" and it kind of leads in this circular argument where you can legitimately ask "why would you keep collecting x amount of anything"- for players that don't craft or whatnot, they'll never see the reason why you would have what you have, why it's worth the effort, etc.
---
It's kinda sad it's reached this point where players are constantly just attacking each other because of Bethesda rather than realizing they are the problem from day 1.
---
In a nutshell the game is alot like Fallout 4 but some pvp thrown in, when you die you only drop junk, not gear. And you can play for months and still not find the legendary weapon you want. The lvl cap is 50 so after your first legendary weapon you wont be touching regular ones except for their scrap. And you learn all your mods from scrapping gear and some of the rarer ones from vendors or special events.
---
Updates are rolling out, slowly but glitches are getting fixed over time and theres a good chance youll get at least a months worth of content out of it if you like to explore and do the side quests.
---
LOL at all the pearl clutching from people who don't know how to take this information after having rabidly defended that dude. 
---
Two Shit Explosive damage is already too OP.  Damn synth gorillas ruining the game.
---
Yep I just bumped into a ‘complete’ map of fo76 and realized that I have missed many spots, some are even right next to the areas I frequent. 
---
Yup - this really helped me out when I was a newbie so I make a point to return the favor every few days at the overseers camp in Flatwoods. Added benefit is actually being there to see someone discover the goodies. 
---
Witch hunt bullshit
---
Improvements. Assuming nothing new was broken, or no old fixes got undone, my hopes for the future of this game are improving.
---
That would be a huge time sink, gathering mats, crafting ammo, then running through it in short order.  I see few people farming the SBQ with miniguns just for those reasons. You would likely doing a person that played that much a favor by banning them to give them some IRL time.
---
True I can get between 800 and 1200 steel during uranium fever in that 15- 20 minutes so lets do the math and just say 2k an hour.
---
So wishful game play of 10 hours per a day earns 20k 
---
And 20k time 30 days is 600k so it's possible not really reasonable.
---
My advice set your guy up for 2 handed weapons and figure out your guns later, I run with a melee build and my guy can take on hordes of legendarie ghouls easier than using guns plus I never worry about ammo 
---
Are we getting player vending soon? 
---
Wouldn't be hard to get the exact amount of damage you want if you just use unarmed as a non unarmed character and even use some chems to lower your strength so your hits do less and less damage until it leaves it at 1 hp.
---
I'm not saying that's not the case, but I have seen this before in other gaming communities, and there has never been as many claims of false ban as there are in this sub, and those were games with 10x the population, besides, literally everything Bethesda could've fucked up with this game they did...
---
Yeah it would be nice to open a shop to sell extra stuff. Me personally i look in every corner and every day I make a big amount of scrap/chems/food which i sell at vendors. But obviously, vendors have a limied amount of caps and I'm stuck with things which I usually drop for free to lower levels.
---
But like having a machine in my camp where I store all the things I want to sell, each with my price, would be amazing. Even with a nice marker that shows my shop on the world map...
---
At least we would stress the xbox looking for group service A LOT less
---
I submitted a ticket Saturday and it hasn’t been looked at yet. From another account I reported a known exploit and it was looked at in under 10 minutes (test it yourself by creating another account)
---
To me this tells me that they aren’t looking at tickets in order received. 
---
It also tells me that if you’ve been banned they probably won’t even look at your ticket at all due to the “no appeal” process on the email. 
---
They’ll tell you to reply to the email per Bethesda Customer Support via Twitter but the email address literally says no_reply@ in the address which companies set up that no one monitors. 
---
There is a number you can call but they’ll tell you to submit a ticket and you have to wait. 
---
Here you are guilty until proven innocent when they get around to it, you do not have due process at all and will not be heard... until they want to hear from you.
---
Take pictures of your inventory before patches come out. That's what I do at least. Take pictures and save them in a doc then compare after updating. Then you have proof of what your inventory was coupled with a submitted ticket where you also provided the same pictures to customer service. 
---
What that means is that with two items that have the same ref ID, they can't tell which is the original and which is the duped item. 
---
As for ammo, the ref ID for the ammo stack doesn't change when it's added to or taken away from, the count just increases (or decreases). They'd have two stacks with the same ref ID but different counts.
---
I believe that's the size of the whole game.?
---
No matter what method they fix or correct, some fuck boy will find a new method because they can’t play the game fairly. It’s a never ending cycle 
---
What are the other new items?
---
The 900 hour guy that got banned is stuck at home due to an injury and is unable to work because of said injury. It seems pretty dick move to ban someone in that situation because they want to play the game to take their mind off being stuck in their house because of an injury.
---
k gimme about 15 mins driving 
---
Yes but that event doesn’t happen every hour for the same player, I see it once every few days but not really looking for it. 
---
I hear what your saying but how many play it for 10 hours a day for 30 days??? 
---
The XP alone would make you at least a 200 level for sure! 
---
Very few people try using unarmed/bloodied builds against the queen IME. You'd probably need a full set of Sentinel for the survivability, and PA/bloodied is plenty strong enough to knock down a queen in a couple of minutes.
---
Show me the precedence for someone being prosecuted with theft for not taking something.
---
I believe they nerf PVP damage output for anyone who is out of caps.  Not 100% sure on that though.
---
Just logged in and spawned to my camp, everything is fine, maybe try moving your camp a little?
---
Is my other option to play with people who revel in others' misery?
---
I'd rather play with the dupers.
---
I've heard spinning is a good trick.
---
The power connector with a switch does this too (as I always have one with my decontamination shower.)
---
You'd just feed all the data into the ELK stack and then you can what you need by extensive filtering and relations. At Oak Ridge we feed 1.6TB pr. second into it to look for patterns, and this is way, way more than any game. Ever. 
---
Yeah but if u went back on that server it was still there
---
Yeah, that hurts. I lost a good item that way. When you are getting attacked by the little blue bastards it's easy to do. 
---
NPC: Non Player Character
---
 Do you, perchance, happen to fight Characters that are Non Players, in this game that supposedly contains no Non Player Characters?
---
 Whoever put this line on the advertising was stupid but I don't see why people keep repeating it. It's like saying that the sea contains no animals, just fish.
---
What I'm talking about is that you're very invested in defending cheaters who have been banned. Methinks the lady doth protest too much.
---
How long is it available?
---
Good to know. And yeah, I recognize they were claims. But for me it was a matter of risk vs. reward.
---
I do know one person IRL who was unjustly banned and somehow he appealed it, but it was the only case I knew about where they were unbanned. 
---
Push to talk is my default. For this reason and many others.
---
Considering someone plays five times longer than he did (300 × 5)=1500.  
---
Especially if they do the all concrete foundations exploit
---
Two-shot shot guns were almost worthless for kneecapping at a distance the whole time
---
I'm not basing anything off **my** experience because I know it's not the norm. I'm basing my posts off facts.
---
it's a fact that the odds of rolling a god 3\* are less than 0.000001%. probability dictates it's impossible for so many people to be running around with a full, matching sentinel set. ***yet***...
---
of course there are genuine ones. every dupe has a source. but they're a minority, like 1% of the current market. if anything you're the one being subjective, taking this way too personally.
---
If you check your map, make a left at LOOKUP FAILED. 
---
No Pip-boy textures, no floors in camp and new atom shop stuff has no pictures. Welp
---
First off, never apologize for a pun; especially when it is well placed. 
---
It seems, from the wording of the email, that this isn’t a current inventory total, it is cumulative over a 30 day period. And, if, in theory, this doesn’t flag self crafted item in this is the case, if you trade for any of that ammo instead of just craft it, you are at the mercy of that player’s ethics. 
---
I suppose that implies never to trust trades. 
---
Is steel a rare item?
---
I did, and it was taken. Fml
---
Ok then? Please, give Bethesda a reason to add them, that would make sense perhaps
---
Question,   
---
What about the issues with both the Plasma Gun and Wood armor only having one legendary attach point?
---
Yep, maybe a "unfilled square" instead of the normal "filled square".  I too have problems in Whitesprings especially.  So many random pieces picked up, and if I decide to drop I have to be SUPER careful that I don't drop a primary armor piece I'm using.
---
Let's see a screenshot
---

it's the atom shop floors 
---
Hardly.  
---
My best build- heavy gunner PA Bloodied build uses a mediocre 2* bloodied/bonus limb damage Gatling gun and has never used this bug and I can one shot 90% of enemies when all my perks are procced (which isn’t hard), level 80 scorchbeasts go down in 4-5 shots.
---
yes but without server hoping its sooo slow, since the not sells you only one at a time.  
---
There are people that don't follow the reddit boards for the games they play (its probably about 95-99% of the gaming community that doesn't) and if they find a massive amount of ammo in a bag in a wild or are offered an incredible deal they would probably have taken it.  My account is good (not banned), I have \~40k of 5.56 on me, if tried to make a lot, buy fromm others, or trade other ammo types for it I am pretty sure I could get over 100k.
---
Whoosh
---
It's just that I'm not interested in engaging in your childish back and forth.
---
If you didn't get my point, you're not getting it any time soon. So why bother.
---
Yeah, I use my glitched Nuka Girl outfit that got fragged in the 12/5/18 patch as a measuring stick for their QC.  Interestingly they actually made some fixes to the suit in this patch but it's still not clear if it has been fully reskinned/textured back to where it was.  I honestly am not sure why patches sometimes do this to cosmetic items, it's really weird.
---
Looks like 6 more days. 
---
Oh no haha. I wonder if you could put frag mines by the door.
---
800 lbs
---
&gt;What that means is that with two items that have the same ref ID, they can't tell which is the original and which is the duped item. 
---
Correct, their inside the vault a while ago even admitted that and said that is why they couldn't just remove the duped guns.
---
&gt;As for ammo, the ref ID for the ammo stack doesn't change when it's added to or taken away from, the count just increases (or decreases). They'd have two stacks with the same ref ID but different counts.
---
That isn't how the ammo works in this game. That may be how it works in most multiplayer games, but that isn't how it works in FO76. Otherwise again, bethesda would have been able to tell which items were dupes and which weren't.
---
A single TSE Automatic Rifle between a level 195 and a level 90 character.    Now I have looted some Two Shot weapons and some explosive weapons (a max level pipe pistol just yesterday) but only the one time did the two prefixes intercept onto one weapon.    My luck seems to be Instigating, particularly War Drums for some reason.
---
It's probably even more time, right? Loading screen time isn't logged, so whenever I server hop or fast travel a lot, only two of my four hours play time will be added to that number. I've been playing since the B.E.T.A., too, and I thought my 400 hours until now were excessive.
---
Congrats for beating 900 Hours Guy's score!
---
Upvoting for title alone. 
---
Stash space box change? Anything else 
---
I don't see anything that's been updated that I don't already have.
---
I love playing solo, been doing that on every fallout and TES for thousands of hours. I need my time to visit locations and find all the hidden stuff. 
---
I have to admit that I wasn't goin to buy this game due to the presence of other people in my world, I thought it would have been a lot worse than what it really is.
---
But I'm glad I bought it, now I can't stop playing anymore. And guess what... the best thing that could happen in the game is meeting new people, cooperate, trade, help and drop free stuff!
---
Thank you Bethesda
---
Nice! Thanks for letting know. I never check the Atom Shop, so I would have missed it!
---
How would that affect the super duper perk?
---
You can easily get several thousand materials like steel in a single day in a few hours by looting/scrapping/doing events. You can also craft mass amounts of items/ammo using perk cards. When I played (Took a break) I had around 500 or so diluted stimpacks sitting around from crafting/looting them and doubling my results through perks. You can split one stimpack into 4 diluted stimpacks or craft 2 stimpacks for the price of one and then end up with 8 diluted stimpacks. Ammo in itself can get crafted into massive numbers.
---
Two Shit should not be combined with Explosive. Change my mind XD
---
That’s a great idea. I leave my water purifiers open for people to get free purified water if they need it, but I’d love the option to sell them for 2-3 caps each to make some extra cash. 
---
That's fair. I'm not accusing him of duping, I haven't come across the player - I saw the screen cap spreading across the web. I was looking at the numbers, but it would be nigh on impossible to cover all scenarios.   
---
Regarding single ammo types, he had multiple ammo types too in large volumes, as shown in the image. I've assumed the same type of ultracite ammo for SBQ battles to make it a bit easier.  
---
Side note: If it's rifle ammo for the ultracite, then the crafting costs are much much higher too.  
---
Only he'll be able to explain it all, and maybe if innocent, this post will help him out with that, or help his claim be verified, as I guess he'll have to explain his gaming routine.  
---
&gt;Your gonna assume somehow I cheated 
---
Yes... you either can't log in because of maintenance or because you have 100k+ of illegitimate items.
---
Ah I missed that. Thought it was 100k of any item.
---
This week it's Mothman stuff, including Mothman PA paint, and the Mothman statue. It looks like the statue has special destruction effects. 
---
People still play this game?
---
Also, this subreddit is...something else. Lmao
---
Do the math on how long that would take to farm
---
You've been all over this sub for the last two days, constantly changing your story. Just stop it already.
---
Man, the one guy working on Fo76 is doing a great job.
---
Happens to me all the time :-/
---
I'm assuming the 100k of rare items meant multiple types. I am also assuming that trading back and forth between mule accounts is how the numbers tally up. This would explain how a few honest players got caught up.
---
Imagine if you moved 1,000 rounds of ammo back and forth between 2 accounts 100 times in 30 days. The system doesn't care what you received, just that you received more than 100k items in 30 days.
---
Because no decent MMO's have come out in a while and I'm bored :(
---
Its amazing, I watch Netflix and Hulu all day, chat on reddit and collect a paycheck for it all. I don't know what kind of job you have, but I feel sorry for you :(
---
Wow. This game really is awful. You cant just lock someone put who paid $60 for a game. Companies should not have that power.
---
Yeah ...Im over 200. 
---
Have you tried rebuilding the database on your system? Sometimes it helps "clear" what the console is seeing.
---
More reason to build a suspended camp which people seem to despise haha. Good thing you can't destroy the platform and stairs. Now if they nerf that, it would be funny to see and camp suspended in air with nothing leading up to it.
---
I used to go for the munitions factory back when Tse was still a thing I actually enjoyed pvp for some reason mainly because I used chameleon armor piece 
---
Bingo
---
I see this didn’t lift the suspension; any possible time frame on that?
---
I touch FO76 once every two weeks just to hop on and play a bit, see how many people are on the servers. I was looking forward to the slight dragon nerf/buffed stash limit. I only knew about the ban wave was because I had YT on autoplay and it eventually made its way to FO76. Heard people were banned, went to go log in, and the spaghetti flowed freely. I never duped, never hacked, never did anything that would put me on a radar. I did craft a massive amount of .50 and 5mm for my machine guns, and horde caps like the jew I am, but who knows what they'll tag me for. Waiting for the support ticket to get a reply, but something tells me I'll be waiting a long ass time for it.
---
FO76 just feels like so much more trouble than it's worth. Should I just uninstall it and clean my hands of it? I'm just so... meh about fallout now... which I don't want to be, fallout NV was my childhood, but my patience is finally coming to an end with Beth and FO76.
---
Just tried a restart on my comp to make sure it wasnt anything on my end and still the same old stuff. Not getting the no floors bug thankfully. 
---
you’re not supposed to reply to an email address that says no reply
---
No problem! I figured some people might not find it. 
---
I'm going to start collecting power armors, again.  I didn't see much point in having T-45, T-51, and T-60 suits in storage when I only ever use X-01 and Excavator, but now that I have some stash space...
---
Maybe one of these fixed my encumberment display issues. It’ll say I’m overencumbered out of the pip boy screen, then when I go in, I’ll be several points under my encumberment limit, then when I hover over a stash box it’ll say I’m several points over my limit, but I’m not getting any action points taken away.
---
You're not the only one
---
We used to do that on the EQ PVP servers. Some mid-levels would be ganking noobs at the new player spawn point for shits and giggles. We would wander by those areas randomly and start spanking the griefers. Track their bind point and go spank them there for a while.
---
For some reason, us doing it is evil and should be banned, but them killing brand new players wanting to check out the PVP servers is fine.
---
Butthurt
---
That's cause the update isn't out yet. Wait till the mods are updated.
---
Servers are up mate.
---
Just tried to log in first to see if I can catch the freaking unruly golfers to complete the quest with one or two of my low level mules.
---
Nope, someone beat me to the punch, it was charred ghouls everywhere... again.
---
Lol I was admitting that I duped a ton and didn't get banned yet. I admitted I'm a POS but mods removed the thread. What a shitshow from the game to the sub. Enjoy your dead game with mods that have no idea wtf they're doing.
---
if it wasn't in a container then it probably disappeared with you.
---
Whatever you day.
---
How am I taking it personally? You are replying to every post with your numbers. You said it yourself, it took you 700 hours to find your first explosive shotgun. Your luck sucks. Others don't. Suck it up.  End of story. 
---
Walls and blockades are all breakable, most workshop benches are open on most sides, and impossible to completely barricade. Why not widen the claim area around the workshop, or increase the "no build" area around it?
---
Using campfires to stack foundations is an **exploit**, and isn't part of normal C.A.M.P building. Why not fix that instead?
---
What do you mean? 
---
Well nobody has disproven that if you hang yourself by your testicles and shout "I'm a little fuckboy, wheee" in the voice chat, you get all the items and a personal letter from Bethesda. But it's on the people saying it WAS a thing to prove it. That's what the burden of proof is.
---
What have I changed? Go ahead quiz me... I’ve literally got nothing to lose or a reason to change any story...  so if you’re gonna call me out do it and ask... I got nothing to hide at all... I’ll wait... 
---
I also have the atom shop floors
---
I'm only asking? what's with the hostility?
---
He speeks the truth
---
Actually you are, when you started to use analogies for finding money on the ground, you most certainly started to bring real world laws into the conversation.  
---
The whole thing just seems fishy, there are various red flags. Someone estimate d that it would take a very long time to amass so much ultracite either by trading for it or crafting it.
---
My gripe is they're suspensions not bans. 
---
As a long term MMO player it boggles my mind that clear cut exploiters are only getting suspensions. 
---
Yup, I don't think it's realistic to calculate every possible scenario. Even if he bought 1,000 ammo a day, that still leaves 615,654 ammo unaccounted for, in a month. Or 585k if he bought 2k a day.  
---
I have 1100 hours in been in the vaults an they banned me ha I wanna T-BAG Bethesda
---
That's so weird. So like you can buy them and just not build them in game?
---
Yes, I accidentally scrapped my helmet cause didn't realize it!
---
I wasn’t going to keep them I held them for a while then decided that I didn’t need a mule or the quantum’s I thought the quantum’s were naturally obtained when I got them I barely knew anything about the game so I had no idea he duped at the time but he told us after he set us up for Banning!
---
Didn’t they literally just have the servers down for maintenance a couple of days ago? Jesus Christ Bethesda, is this a regular occurrence? I’ve only been playing about a week and this is the second time they’ve shit the servers down 
---
He might have been banned for the 360k ultricite ammo, and they just listed the other ammo he had on him as well. 
---
OP doesn't state rare items, he says massive amounts of items. Looks like some people are being banned for ammo as well
---
After reading both threads for a few minutes this sums up  exactly how I feel
---
If you invested heavily in the gatling gun and relied on the martial artist perk always working that was just your bad... it never should have worked that way. It made gatling gun the best heavy weapon by far. Now that the perk is gone it's still pretty good. I won't stop using it.
---
Those are all cases of people keeping the money.
---
He just needed to sprinkle in a little bit of "it's white peoples fault" for the Jussie trifecta 
---
I see that it has not been fixed; any word on a time frame for this? Or is it just “whenever we get to it”? 
---
*[awaits the downvoting &amp; “that what you get” comments]*
---
So all you have to do for 10k Karma is lie through your teeth whilst providing clear evidence you are lying?
---
Yep sounds like Reddit to me. 
---
A slider would mess with the super duper perk because it would only make one call to it, either it works or it doesn't, rather than giving you a shot at each individual craft opportunity. 
---
SEPARATE NUKA GIRL OUTFIT FROM HELMET!!! THANK FUCK!!!
---
You know... I was reading the knowyourmeme page about that, I could have looked at the date and answered my own question!
---
Thanks for the info though!
---
Whatever
---
True. Back in beta I had a suspended camp with a locked door and found ghouls inside it once destroying the walls. Still not sure if a player unlocked the door and left it open or if ghouls are smarter than I think they are haha
---
I do see that event about 3 or 4 times a day so about every 2 hours at the most it seems but if your waiting for the event to restart just run over to hunterville and slay the super mutants while your waiting or Welsh.
---
I use to run about 10-16 hours if I had to work in eve online running two boxing.
---
As for levels I got 350+ hours im only 160ish but I play with my buds all the time and we just mess around a lot.
---
Y’all are getting mad over people using exploits that were in the game but not mad at Bethesda for releasing a game with so many exploits
---
Not sure i've not bought anything recently this is just past purchases 
---
Hahaha you got a game that advertised grieving in the preview and are now upset that theres grieving 
---
TIL: Dup less than 100k items, and I'll be fine.
---
No, I didn't. I was responding to someone who did. Easy to see that. And very simple logic.
---
that is still a form of not cheating....
---
Might I additionally request a need for the Auto feature for headset audio to be more malleable when using controller? I love doing Area speak, but hate walking away from a Team member and hearing nothing. I wish that when I joined a team using Auto that I could hear my teammates anywhere, but could also talk to people near me who aren't a part of the team. Like a Team-Area blend option.
---
Well screaming for drugs isn't the only thing I do...I offer 1000 caps if they bust out a freestyle rap, or 500 for a dirty limerick. Hell I offer people caps to jump on the mic just to tell me to STFU. 
---
I’d love if they carried some of these fixes over to FO4. I’ve just started a survival run and I’m damn jealous of this fix alone 
---
completely unrelated? the entire game is one, huge bug. Bethesda managed to break mutations AND diseases while trying to fix something \*completely unrelated\*.
---
and seeing as how other, rare bugs are also downplayed, such as disappearing items which I have experienced myself, three times, I'd rather just believe Bethesda messed up again. because 9 out of 10 times, that's exactly the case.
---
Tbh, I really liked the atomic shop sign next to power armor icon because it let me differentiate between them. 
---
https://imgur.com/L5H2Ax4
---
I just got it recently too. I’m kicking myself for blindly hating on it for so long. All of those reviewers can suck my left nut this game is awesome.
---
Do you use mods?
---
Too bad the playing field isn't level. Most if these people fraudulently obtained the best weapons, armor and mutations, which in turn enabled them to fraudulently obtain XP, flux and other materials for the best PA mods.
---
The temp duper suspensions did not delete the fraudulently obtained items and advantages.
---
And this is the environment you are expected to play in.
---
Gameplay is BROKEN, PvP us a non-starter until the fraud is fixed.
---
I would imagine whether he “fucked himself” is not another issue,  seems like the exact same issue.
---
But You are not considering the fact that ultracite ammo, being one of the huge dupe targets, flooded the market in the millions. This ban wave was not targeting dupers - it was targeting duped items. He certainly could have obtained it "legitimately" through a combination of crafting and trading. However, it's incredibly unlikely that the quantity of ultracite ammo we're talking about was not the result of a dupe -- to the point that Bethesda has flagged them and will delete them, because they were duped. The ban wave is completely agnostic of who actually did the duping.
---
Anything else to add?
---
Cheaters and dupers deserve the bann Bethesda finally did something I support 
---
I got banned for junk
---
And then let's add their political views too just to create further tension! 
---
Nani ‽ 
---
Careful, don't run folks off or we could end up with a F2P game
---
Is it a new pose I already have the rest of them.
---
Lost my first 2 🌟 legendary last night because of this :(
---
There is no way to completely eliminate duping from the game.
---
How do I know this?
---
No other survival game has ever done it.  You're literally trying to fight against thousands and thousands of players who make it their "job" to break the game.
---
Can you clamp down on most of it, sure.  Should they be focusing this HARD on it while not providing any NEW CONTENT, no.  Yes, server crashes suck.  But did I stop playing?  Nope.
---
We are BORED.  I don't give a crap if someone had 100k ultracite ammo.  What I do care about is almost NONE of my friends play anymore.  They're BORED.  Am I thinking about stopping playing, YEP!  
---
p.s.  Do you want to know what REAL "I quit" game breaking cheating looks like? 
---
Just wait until PVP mode comes out and the "aimbot, flying, ESP, take no damage" crap comes out.  I'll bet you $100 that Bethesda doesn't have Easy Anti-Cheat, PunkBuster, or some other AAA anti-cheat added AT LAUNCH of the PVP servers.
---
You want to see REAL problems with cheaters, wait until that happens.  How do I know?  WarZ, H1Z1, The Division, Overwatch, PUBG............all had massive REAL game fun killing cheater problems, and many still do.  To this day I haven't bought COD titles in the past 5 years (yes I caved for Blackout for a short period) because the games are over-run with aimbot ESP losers who completely ruin gameplay.
---
They'll probably fix this next. We go back to reclaim and there will be 4 waves combined haha
---
Why do our posts get downvoted.
---
Maybe an issue with atom shop items? Some other posts about it [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascxic/atomic\_shop\_items\_invisible\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascxic/atomic_shop_items_invisible_again/)
---
Well, it is too early to tell if this patch was a success or not (patches have been known to break or un-do past fixes). That being said, the game has been running pretty well for me. Very few server drops (well, maybe once per every 2 hour session), little to no freeze ups. Playing on Xbox One. If this patch ends up being a success, I think it is a good time to try jumping back in.
---
New Mothman stuff in the Atomic shop including a FREE photo pose.   
---
Now THAT is content I wante dto see!   
---
(New photo pose. Mothman's cool but photo poses are awesome!)
---
If only it changed colors, then you could walk around as a giant disco ball 
---
Oh god yes. I've had a Berserker's Gatling Plasma for about 60 levels that's waiting on a fix. I bring it out occasionally when I forget why I don't use it, and it's broken in about 1 to 2 cores. Trashes sentry bots in seconds but then dies. I've got a bunch of other legendary energy weapons also just waiting to be useful
---
Why not just make it so that if you are in pacifist mode that your attacks don't damage player structures? 
---
Yeah, this is why most online games have persistent, named servers and posted maintenance schedules. Random schedules is no bueno.
---
It's not downloading the whole game for a patch though? The day one patch yes, it was 52g, but every patch after has been less than 10g. 
---
you use any mods?
---
No Bethesda fucked up the patch notes 
---
Bad material paths, bad material paths everywhere! :D
---
Hey, makes me feel better about my rookie day mistakes with these :D
---
10mm is kinda rare though, isn't it? Majority of low level scorched I kill get their inventory switched to something more acceptable for a level 50+.
---
I was actually desperately hoping for 10mm drops during a recent Collision Course event so I could get the kill 80 scorched with a pistol challenge. It was close!
---
Yep banned for life
---
No, do you think you can direct me to a step by step on how to do this?
---
Not sure that the math even maters, you can buy or get ammo from other players, it is not solely sourced from the workbench.  I have \~28k rounds of 5mm in my inventory right now, and I have never made it.  If I sell it cheap to another player give it away it could have pushed someone over the banned threshold for using an in game function.
---
Mods, you have my sympathy: this cannot be a very fun time to moderate this sub Reddit.
---
Hopefully this all blows over and becomes old news within a week or two. Until then may the gods have mercy on you.
---
you need space for the patch file, space for the expanded patch file, and space to hold a rollback version of the game files in case the patch doesn't install correctly.   
---
How not to get banned by the Bethesda Ban Everyone Machine?
---
Step 1 - Don't play.
---
Step 2 - There is no Step 2 silly!
---
Brilliant!  Have an upvote :)
---
Taking the money and throwing it away some where else would still be considered "keeping".  How do you expect to get it to the trash receptacle to throw it out to begin with.  
---
Just look at CA penal code 485 on the subject:   
---
[https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/485.html](https://law.onecle.com/california/penal/485.html)
---
&gt;One who finds lost property under circumstances which give him knowledge of or means of inquiry as to the true owner, and who appropriates such property to his own use, or to the use of another person not entitled thereto, without first making reasonable and just efforts to find the owner and to restore the property to him, is guilty of theft.
---
A bag of money would give you the means of inquiry, and picking up the money afterwards is appropriating it.  End stop.  You don't get to spend it, give it away, or throw it away - as soon as you picked up that cash and did something with it without attempting to find the owner you committed theft. 
---
That is what I intended my previous reply to convey.
---
I can mostly agree with this. I get a few server drops on occasion (which obviously is a non-issue in a game like FO4), but otherwise I would say it seems to run almost as well as FO4.
---
If 3-5 downvotes is being "mass downvoted", I guess that all the upvotes I have in my initial comment means that I've been infinitely upvoted, by your standards.
---
Still, I probably don't care about Internet points as much as you seem to do. Sorry.
---
"Bladed" turns the Commie Whacker into a Bladed Commie Whacker
---
Most people who were banned were probably banned legitimately, but I have no clue why people think that Bethesda couldn't have put in a data entry error flagging something that shouldn't have been flagged. It seems that just about every patch has had bugs introduced that seem to be data entry errors.
---
I have no clue whether every person who said they were banned wrongly are lying or not. I don't even care at this point. But Bethesda's track record makes me think that at least some people may be being honest.
---
Time will tell. I know people are wrong about some things that they think triggered a ban, and when I hear them, I know that they're lying.
---
Having same issue with various Atom Store purchases here.
---
I got disconnected from a server in which I got my first nuke, after I died and dropped all my loot. A thousand times *yes*
---
Might have just glitched in through the door, this IS a bethesda game after all.
---
Project beanstalk is a bug? It should stay, I laughed so hard when he came out to spray and torched the place.  I really thought it was intentional.
---
Exactly which is why I try to ask for evidence when I can to stamp out all the rumours

Keeps getting kicked out because the servers are effed.....doesn't wanna get kicked out so they can fix the effed servers??? Uh wut lol.

There are supposedly PC mods that can cause this every time there's a patch, however I'm on PS4 and still get similar issues so who knows.
---
You won't be able to keep playing once the sub expires. Other person was suggesting to blast through it and then shelf it, which is an odd suggestion for a live game model.
---
&gt;How am I taking it personally?
---
you're ignoring cold, hard facts in the form of numbers and saying that I'm being subjective for simply bringing up a personal experience, one that I'm not in any way, shape or form including in my calculations. all the while using *your* own experiences to back your posts, "**I** have, **I** got, etc."
---
&gt;You are replying to every post with your numbers.
---
numbers based off tangible, factual things. such as loot tables, prefixes, etc.
---
&gt;You said it yourself, it took you 700 hours to find your first explosive shotgun.

yes, and? I was just sharing it to illustrate that, if it happened to me, it could happen to someone else. that the odds are up there with early 2000 Korean mmos.
---
What a logic.
---
You realize thats illegal right? Where do you work because id love to get the feds involved at your place of business. If its on america a company cannot by law tell a customer they are speaking to a supervisor or managment unless that is true and if your found out you can be slapped with a huge fine for misrepresentation. Its not hard to just do correct customer service instead of do stupid shit that costs millions in lawsuits

Armor penetration reduces Damage Resistance ("armor") which is the divisor in the damage coefficient formula. It doesn't help directly against anything that says "reduces damage" but you'll still deal more damage within that 29.% potential that's left in the above example.

It seems clear now that the items people are being banned for are specific to a list of rare items, in this case that was ultracite ammo. Regular ammo does not trigger a ban.
---
Yup, I think so! I haven't seen it before, anyway. 
---
People have no sense of humour. 
---
Confirmed that this is still broken.
---
You say you've not played in a month. Then how do you know you still have the duped items?
---
Also, the first wave of banned happened for people who acquired these items in the last one month, so if you haven't played recently, you might have been spared, for now.
---
All in all, this post is fucking fishy as fuck.
---
That's Sergeant to you, person who can't spell!
---
I am constantly dropping steel, or it will take up 100% of my storage. What are you making that eats it up so much?
---
When duped ammo is added to legit ammo, the count of the legit ammo stack increases and the stack of duped ammo ceases to exist. The ref ID of the legit stack doesn't get changed when the count changes. If they're two different stacks (i.e. player inventory and stash) they have the same ref id problem they have with guns and armor: two items with the same ref ID and no way to tell which is the original.
---
Usually 200 to 500 caps.  Sometimes less if you provide materials.  Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits to find players who sell serums there.
---
It got a bit old since you could jump so high you constantly got the "fell a long way" animation when in power armor.  I know you could counter it by jumping again etc but it was still annoying.
---
What's the advantage to bulking junk anyway? When I first started playing I thought maybe it reduced storage space usage, but found that wasn't the case, which makes sense since it's based on weight and not volume I guess. Is it just for convenience for trading?
---
Hi, thanks for reporting this. Some Atomic Shop textures, including floors, may appear missing if you're running Fallout 76 with mods. 
---
Do you have any mods installed? If so can you please try removing them to see if your floors come back?

awesome will definitely check this out

I have a duped TSE someone who giving away during Christmas, I know its duped because who just gives them away and he had 100 of them. I crafted 10,000 5.56 to go with it over the weeks using lucky hole mines, the hornwright testing site and that workshop north of grafton. No ban here....

Honestly, all jokes aside I lost my power armor I worked forever to put together (it was hard finding all the black titanium for the excavator armor), my game crashed and my armor disappeared. Now I’m back at the beginning try to piece together armor I can wear at level 30. Feels bad bro. I’m in the same boat you are
---
&gt;I can tell you the least enjoyable materials to gather in this game were the ones I saw involved in the duplication glitches.. 
---
Hmm. So when the totally trivial ammo box dupe was fixed maybe 3 or more months ago, suddently people wanted to buy 1k and more of wood and leather and stuff like that. I don't think it was as much effort to people doing it, than what you think it was.
---
Your salty tears are so yummy. Bet you got banned long time ago and just want to cause confusion among players
---
&gt;  I unintentionally created a fast travel trap. 
---
I think this is why they won't give us fast travel landing mats like Fo4. Too much potential to abuse. No matter how hilarious it might be.

I'm on PS4, and maybe my wording was off, but I have the plans. Just took ages to find them. ;-)  Mainly use the dresses to clear out vendors quickly and efficiently, so I hope they don't nerf their value at some point.

800 is still pretty low, but I guess it's better than nothing.... At 800 - the game will still be 90% me in menus trying to manage my inventory. It should be like 2k at least.

Hi! Some textures for items from the Atomic Shop can go missing if you're running Fallout 76 with mods. Do you have any mods installed and if so, can you try removing them to see if that makes your items visible again?
---
Also, you don't take Super Duper into account when crafting the stable flux. As someone that has a pretty high luck and max Super Duper I have also gotten it to proc waaaaay more than 30% sometimes on every other item. 
---
Sounds like a plan to me!
---
What kind of stuff do you give to your mules? I have a manageable amount of junk, 100+ of each junk, various full sets of armour and about 100 to 200 pounds of legendary weapons, and hover around 550 to 600. Do you have 1200 pounds of spare junk?
---
Thanks for mentioning this! 
---

---
Just you.
---
So your theory is more likely then Bethesda screwing up and tracking all the ammo he moved back and fourth.  I'd he truly has that much ammo stored which he says he doesn't then Bethesda should send him a current inventory snapshot, not say hes acquired that much ammo in that much time.
---
Moving ammo back and fourth for various reasons would count as acquiring the ammo and would greatly skew the numbers making it appear as tho he duped ammo when he may have just as likely moved the ammo back and fourth between mules and his main.
---
correct.  Flat "% damage" reduction is not the same thing as damage, energy, and radiation resistance.
---
This happens on PC also.
---
Marsupial mutation is extremely useful as well for non PA and stealth.  It is also fun for jumping away from foes while shooting them with VATS.  A hazmat works fine in nuke zones with an agile playstyle, but the build and weapons need to be matched.

It always leaves off with the steps to insert the bone meal and insert the chemicals. At least I get the bone meal back when I log out. Yeah, sending in a ticket was going to be the next step, just figured I'd see if anyone else here was having the same issue. I've looked at a few forums but haven't seen this one talked about.
---
At 86hp my damage is 1018 hit point so half that is 509 with your hp at 290 your still dead with one hit
---
If you were banned, why would you think updating the game would remove the ban?
---
Picking up something and putting it back down doesn't give you knowledge of or means to find the owner. And you're under no obligation to do so. And lets bring it back into the game now, and then that falls apart completely.
---
It should not, unless the item description says so.
---
Just me 
---
Here, have a cookie.
---
Now be a good boy and go play outside.
---
&gt;But just because it did happen to you does not mean it has happened to everyone else.
---
except it could. that's what probability means.
---
I'm not saying it'll take everyone 750 hours to drop an explosive shotgun. that makes no sense. I'm simply stating a fact, that the odds of rolling a godly 3\* one are less than 0.000001%. this is not subjective.
---
of course you could roll one within an hour of gameplay. that's how rng works. but the **probability** of that happening are next to none, same with all the people running around in full, matching sentinel.
---
maybe you should look into the definition of probability.
---
So for the people like me who got banned, when can we get our accounts back? Any info? 
---
exactly - most of my time with this game is spent managing my inventory and trying to decide what to throw away
---
I think that you being paranoid about people duping when it's less than 1% of anyone actually doing it, while you have little to no knowledge about how actual gathering and crafting in this game works, it is *far more likely* that you're closely related to someone who dupes than I am.
---
For example, someone who's a thief and regularly steals from other people are well known to be much more worried than anyone else that they will have things stolen from them, than the likelihood is that someone will actually steal from them.
---
In this situation it's become apparent there has to be *some reason* that you think duping is so much more common than it actually is! 😋 Sure, everyone knows it happens, there are people that do it- most aren't paranoid to the point of being delusional about it though, blaming players for making normal trades and whatnot.
---
That's sarcasm to the prick E5...
---
Most likely, they prefer to break 3 things with everything they fix, part of the lack of beta testing patches that occurs with this game.
---
&gt; cap collector
---
this one and the Pharmacy one give you a second loot change at containers. You have a prompt to search it again after looting it. Space key for PC.
---
Open cap stash. Take caps. Hit 'space'. Take new set of caps that appears about 75% of the time.
---
Well I doubt people would crunch the numbers to the point where a structure has exactly 1 HP. Basically, you would hit a Generator with your Super Sledge, see how much damage it dealt, if it did less than 50%, you can hit it again (assuming you cannot "critical" a structure). 
---
Granted, the base attack damage might be sufficiently high enough that a single blow destroys the generator. Easy solution to that is to use a sub-par weapon that doesn't one shot.
---
Again, this is all SUPER specific, but a good design looks at all possible exploits and deals with them before they can be abused.

Normally I'd agree. But Bethesda has been, well, less than honest about FO76 since the start of things. So being skeptical of their honesty moving forward and being inclined to believe others isn't unreasonable at all.

Much the same as those who will accuse others of lying to further their agenda, whether that be politics or fanboy-ism. At the end of the day, there is no proof that supports either side. You should choose who to believe based on whomever you believe more. In this case, either the unknown guy or sketchy Bethesda.

Yeah, just let me click the button 20 times and it will queue up to craft 20 in 20 or 20 seconds.

Yesterday many comments about the ban letter saying it would be restored but future updates, just not this one per the comments by people still unable to play so I posted what I saw to let people know. That’s all...
---
Did you just have a seizure?
---
No.
---
damn get a life
---
Then finding out the stuff to tossed out is needed because the legendaries you have kept are now being nerfed and you need a new build that requires the legendaries you had to get rid of.
---
It's become a chore which is what usually kills games.
---
Actually, I find these statements funny. Everyone asked for it. For years, you have all wanted better AI on your enemies in Fallout. Ever since New Vegas, you’ve all clamored for more roleplaying options, like being a full blown Raider. Ever since Bethesda took over, most you have even complained that Fallout is too easy now. They literally gave you everything you ever wanted, but PvP is hard and they are still balancing it. Just remember, be careful what you ask for!
---
You learn how to craft most helmets by scrapping them, so on the upside you can probably just make a new one.

Hey, just logged in and had some issues right away, already submitted a ticket but might as well give the heads up on here.

Atomic shop is broken, items wont display so you cant actually look at them. Also when logging into the world none of my atomic ahop items spawned (Apparel, Floor, decoration) which rendered my base unusable cause my workbenches are floating but since theres no flooring, i just fall and cant craft anything.

I do not have access to the enclave bunker yet so I can only go to 6 of the 7 factions..total travel costs is 49 caps to sell for 1200..so I net 1151 a day

Welcome to "lets make sure the grind is so oppressive they can never get their ideal build" game!
---
I remember that Fortnite Save the World (PVE Mode that costs money to buy) had weekly or bi-weekly events where you could get "really nice" weapons that weren't perfect rolls, but oh man were they pretty good.  I still remember my rocket launcher I got from one of the events.  Gold legendary, decent perks, and I used it CONSTANTLY.  Not like the Bunker Buster (garbage) I got here.......lol
---
Fast forward to Fallout 76, more time, more effort, more grinding, and LESS rewarding.  No wonder a black market exists in the game.  It's impossible to get a full set of Sentinel / Assassin armor.  It's impossible to get a TSE.
---
Fallout 76 = Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, grind, until you realize you're super bored and no new content is coming out.  Then quit.  And move on to something that's at least remotely rewarding.
---
You clearly didn't do your research on the OP before going off on this comment.  
---
IMO, this is way, way down the list in terms of things that need to be addressed. As long as you don't log out at the resort there's a 99.999% chance you'll be OK. If you do log out while at the resort you should know what you're potentially getting yourself into.
---
Thank you! 
---
I would be mad if this wasn't so funny
---
it JUST works
---
You realize anyone can type anything here right?   Maybe he lied at some level, maybe Bethesda made an error in banning him, I really do not have a dog in that fight.  From my experience though, something seems odd about the ammo quantities/time.  In any case its between him and Bethesda.  Probably not appropriate to call out either party.
---
You tried disabling it? From what I've heard, there are some mods out there that mess yo game up post patch
---
Yes my game is modded, the fix listed below solved it.
---
Ik people need to stop being so damn serious about a game. 
---
I like building, and don't necessarily want it to go away, but I'm pretty sure building an indestructable, 4 story, foundation patform right outside fissure prime is not using the C.A.M.P. features as intended...
---
Thanks, it worked!
---
because you take Tuesday off, which is literally the day that almost everyone releases stuff, or when stuff is patched. 
---
nope. Its stacks.
---
What's wrong with it? It has worked every time I've used it :/
---
Dunno, thanks to the Scrounger perk the ammo shows up quite often in boxes and I get some more as quest rewards, Forbidden Knowledge always drops random ammo for example. I'm carrying ~ 900 bullets of 10mm with me right now, but then I've been saving them for a while.
---
As for the pistol challenges, yeah, better switch to a .44 if you plan on taking up the Kill 1011 Robots With A Pistol challenge, too...
---
"The same people complaining that billionaires are exploiting the system to get further ahead are the same people that want to help the poor and disenfranchised. Hypocrisy, no?"

He had 360k ultracite ammo over 2 characters, that would be 1500 stable flux in a month by your math. Do you think that's reasonable? (this is a real question, as I don't nearly play that much but wondering if you still think its fine if its double to triple what you described)
---
cool. Now do ultracite ammo.
---
why are you  asking us
---
Ok I guess I wasn’t clear enough the first time. I’m not going to apologize for what I said. If it offended you or anyone else, I don’t care in the slightest bit.
---
Don't be stupid.  The analogy isn't about you commiting a felony.  It's about doing something that is against policy of the system you are part of, then that system enforcing a punishment because of this.  Stop with the strawman argument.
---
This!!!
---
gotta dedupe stuff and that takes room
---
Made 15 flux last night, and Super Duper only kicked in twice.  Feels bad man!
---
I've never used it but I'm curious, does the targeting HUD outline cloaked enemies such as Assaultrons or players using a stealthboy or chameleon armor/mutation?
---
And I'm sure that less than 1% of players have gotten caught by this ban wave. Duping isn't common except among idiots lying about being unfairly banned on Reddit.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. Worth it to be able to soar over buildings though!
---
It would be a lot easier and less suspicious if you didn't post this with a burner account name. If as you say you traded items on a reddit based marketplace, you would have posts / comments regarding that.
---
Nice, waiting on the update before I can check it out (why don’t background updates work on Xbox..?)
---
I’d love to see more poses and animations added, including some less extravagant/more subtle, everyday options. I’ve been using Photomode or hiding the HUD in regular gameplay, capturing scenes on DVR and dubbing audio clips over... [check it out](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) 
---
The game looks great and you can achieve some great shots and cinematography. I’d love more poses and tools to work with!
---
OP is not bright, I think they're trying to justify their cheating.

---
Asking for better AI and harder difficulty does not equate to fighting other players. A lot of people wanted a Fallout they could play with friends,  not having to worry about getting griefed  by other players.
---
I don't either, just frustrating seeing all these people claiming the guy is "OBVIOUSLY A DUPER" over the email he got even though the email actually makes it sound MORE like a screw up on bethesda's end.
---
I mean check the guys post history, he repeatedly reported dupers and exploits in the past. Makes no sense for him to dupe if he is reporting dupers and the exploits they are using trying to shut them down.
---
Nah, the best way to play solo is by helping people who need help. We’re all trying to survive out here mate. For example. I leave my water purifiers unlocked near vault 76 so the newbies can get fresh water and not worry about rads. I leave my house unlocked so they can use all my work benches and storage containers if they need to. 
---
I regularly drop meds and food to people who need it. People offer to trade and I just ask what they need and give it to them for free, and in return they usually drop something extra they have.
---
If a player is getting swarmed by mobs, I run over and help him out. 
---
These are the things that make the game fun. It’s a world. We are all living in the world. We have houses and neighbors in this game and it’s nice to help them. 
---
It’s not a boring grind though to a point. 
---
But honestly, i probably would’ve stopped playing weeks ago if it wasn’t for my potentially duped weapons I bought from a buddy. Just two guns, a tse pump and an explosive combat shotgun. 
---
They need to make explosive and two shots more abundant. Not necessarily make tse more abundant but one of the perks being present more often. It really makes the game more fun when you have loot that actually makes you more powerful.
---
Bethesda has been improving somewhat recently so I’m hoping they may do this or something akin to making rewards rewarding 
---
No, it's a PA mod, I believe. 
---
4:8:2000 login failure account not authorized (something like that) after pressing any button to  start... 
---
CS said for them to do a hard reset, delete profile off of console, reinstall the game and then after all that they get a letter saying they were banned for having 100,000 rare in game items. 
---
It’s not griefing if he’s initiating PVP with people. He’s wanted, so those players must have tried to kill him and lost. 
---
How is that griefing? 
---
Weird question but okay. This is a forum visited by Bethesda, I'm trying to ask them or anyone who knows about the situation. 
---
Good grief - if I have 1000 rounds of 5.56, it's like i won the lottery. 
---
The only person acting stupid here is yourself. Only problem is you are too dumb to realize it. Im done here. Call me when your comprehensive skills have surpassed 1st grade
---
It sucks, but wait until you're fully loaded in before opening your PipBoy, test it by equipping a weapon first. 
---
so, why here and not on the Bethesda site? 
---
Wanted: yeah lets just damage every part of someone's camp but not entirely so i can be an asshole and get away with it.
---
Workshops: yeah let me just sneak into the farthest obsolete corner of a camp and take it so it renders defenses pretty much completely worthless. 
---
Is this an out of season April fool's joke? 
---
I don’t know that they have the time or tools to figure out how you got it, so I think that is why they left them alone
---
For me personally it is the multi-playstyles that’s the issue, I’ve a weightless set for when I’m in the mood for using my chameleon mutation (e.g nuke silo) but it’s not very damage resistant tbh, a regular PVE set that’s a mix and match of all sorts and I’ve finally got together some assassin bits if I decide to try the PVP mode, on top of that I only use heavy weapons for SBQ fights and the rest of the time it’s melee 50/50 with automatic handmade and there’s the odd occasion I feel like playing more long range and stealth like so I’ve always got a ranged weapon in the collection too which is handy for when your chasing a nuclear key card and the cargo bot wants to fly out of medium range, as far as the junk goes I just keep a 100 of everything apart from lead steel springs gears screws and acid which I keep 250 or so of for ammo and repairs. The 800 will due just great and anything else in the future will just be a bonus.
---
&gt; You will have to fight a group of Mirelurks, including Kings and sometimes a Queen
---
sounds AMAZE
---
Good job overall but  my poor two shot Gatling Gun is but a shadow of it's former self. Guess I need to replace martial artist with the heavy guns damage cards and see if it's still worth the weight it takes up.
---
This pose is a pretty nice one, especially considering it's free. I think it's more subtle than most of their other poses, so ya might like it.
---
I feel like this should be stickied to the front page. This happens after every patch and people start crying as if the patch is broken.
---
There was one from Dev room.  Also I think the Confederate Hat could be learned but not actually crafted, so that might have been it.

Cosmetic only
---
Which sucks since it *did* protect you from hazards in FO4
---
No gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
---
It just seems like a roundabout way to tell someone they've been banned. But I'm more curious as if and why there are people who got the message but weren't banned. Were they false positives? What exactly was that?
---
Gotta find that crazy cat lady. 
---
Your comment has absolutely nothing to do with his. Also, people want to be a raider against npc characters, not real life people just trying to enjoy a game. You’d have to be an asshole to want to torture people in an online shooter, and live a very sad life. 
---
Relogging after this happens usually stops it for my play sessions, but maybe that just my luck.
---
Is this the game that isnt selling any units at all?
---
It's a bad opinion but yeah i guess it stands
---
It never says he “has” the amounts they listed.

If they said “look at this stash” and it had the amounts of ammo listed this would be over.
---
They list “acquired” ammo. We have no idea how that’s tracked, Bethesda isn’t sharing, and the guy is saying he thinks his transferring from mule to main account multiplied the “acquired” amount because it changed hands over and over.
---
Main point: his claim is that numbers in the email are not amounts of ammo he has, nor the amount he made over 30 days. Beth says acquired, not currently have. There is plenty of room for confusion here, not a cut and dry case.
---
Well, lets use lead to start with, as that's the easiest. You can get 240 in 15 minutes, from farming lucky hole mine with excavator armour.  
---
Two lead ore and one acid yields 5 lead scrap.
---
240 lead ore is enough for 120 crafts. 120 crafts make 600 ore.  
---
Assume super duper, then that gives 800 ore.
---
He needs to get 35,850 lead in a month.   
---
So, he needs to do that say, 45 times a month, straight forward - 1.5 times a day in a 30 day month.  
---
So 15 minutes a shot, that's 11 hours a month farming lead ore, then whatever time it takes to craft it from smelting into lead scrap.  
---
35,850 /5 \*2 = 14,340
---
14,340/240 = 59.75 times a month, so that's twice a day for the lead - that's viable, and the easiest one.  
---
You need acid too, which is a bit harder...  
---
Actually, stop press,   
---
quote from the specific banned guy with regards to farming ore.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900\_hours\_played\_my\_favorite\_farming\_locations/egohig8/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arineq/900_hours_played_my_favorite_farming_locations/egohig8/)
---
&gt;" I use macros on PC. One macro spams E very quickly. You can get multiple harvests from 1 node. Usually 12 ore from each ore node. And then stingwings make good acid to smelt it. And they're worth good exp. "
---
So, he uses a macro to get 3 harvests per ore harvest. Normally you can only get one. Which with excavator armour, is 4 ore.
---
Saves me time calculating anything any further. He's using macros. That's why it's more or less incomprehensible for a console player to be able to do what he does. You can't use scripts in console gaming.  
---
I watched videos of people doing it, I've even caught people in the act of doing it in a party chat, I've heard them scream like little babies when their game crashed for like the third time in a row before they were actually able to duplicate anything. It's really quite the time waste, that's why I said if they're going to duplicate**anything**, they aren't going to duplicate ammo.
---
Besides, the same logic people have presented logic why you wouldn't craft ammo to that degree applies to them duping that same ammo. If it doesn't make sense for them to craft that much ammo, it also wouldn't make sense for them up duplicate that much ammo.
---
Then there's the obvious: there's serum recipes, nukacolas (print your own caps), and every other low weight thing with a high value/much more rare in the game that can be sold to players, or vendors.. *why would they duplicate ammo* **but none of these other things while they're already in the process?**
---
See, this is where common sense comes in. Perhaps the majority of players here don't have it, but a guy that's found more variety of interesting places to farm materials, legendaries, ammo materials and much more- he doesn't sound that dumb.
---
It sounds much more likely that he crafted ultracite ammo with excess materials in his **900 hours of gameplay** and put it on another character with the hopes it would one day have value (as we all hope the excess ammo we have will one day be able to be sold to vendors or whatnot).
---
Done.  What's your phone number?  Or are you to dumb to realize what it is?  OH SNAP!
---
(lol this is devolving into a crap argument but still kinda funny)
---
Praaaaaaise the lord and pass the ammunition!
---
I think that was the jackass I just posted about, he was lvl 141 or something? He wanted to fight me and I just walked away. Big man fighting those who are 3 times lower than him....Azzhat......
---
The problem with all this is assuming that bethesda actually is checking these ref ID. The way they have handled themselves every step of the way with this game has shown that they do not know how to properly handle a multiplayer game (tying movement speed to frames per second), sending the "unlock" area for all the locks to the client prior to unlocking so mods can easily see where the "sweet spot" is. ETC.
---
The fact of the matter boils down to this, the guy with 900 hours in the game has a post history full of reporting dupers, and exploits trying to get them shut down/banned. If he was duping I highly doubt he would risk his account duping only ammo.
---
Not to mention the email itself even states he was banned just for having over 100k ammo go through his inventory over a 30 day period. Any half decent trader could easily have that much go through their inventory in the same time. The fact Bethesda is using the fact someone has 100k ammo of one type as a reason to ban someone is ridiculous and asinine.
---
I posted this in another thread, but here's my problem with this.  The 900 hours guy COULD have gotten it all legit, I won't dispute that, however by all accounts it would pretty time consuming right?  Look at his detailed post about his farming habits, the places he goes and what he does there.  Does it say anything about nuking the SBQ multiple times daily and collecting thousands of raw fluxes?  Nope, not one mention.  So explain how he got 200k+ ultra cite ammo based on his own guild explaining his playstyle please
---
Too soon!
---
&gt; Look, dupers were technically playing by Bethesda’s rules
---
No they didn't. Exploiting the game is against the TOS. Something you have to agree to before you actually play the game. 
---
&gt;Bethesda made a game, the game features ways for you to duplicate weapons, so you duplicate weapons. 
---
No, just because bethesda didn't patch the game does not mean you are free to just exploit that exploit willy nilly and face no consequences. That's not how this works.
---
&gt;Now if the duper used mods or any outside source to cheat the game, then they’re shit out of luck, a ban is justified.
---
Yes, but that's irrelevant. Duping and, while we're at it, selling your duped stuff for real tangible money is 100% against the TOS. Especially the latter part.
---
&gt;I’ll put it this way. It’s against the law to grow weed. Weed is a herb grown from the earth, yet the government has decided to regulate it.
---
Yes, because marijuana is an illegal drug. Regardless of why it's illegal or whether or not it grows in the dirt, it's still illegal. if you get caught with it you're going to jail. 
---
&gt;Does that punishment fit the crime? Hell no.
---
No, but it's a law. However, regardless of how frivolous certain laws are, we have to follow them. Same goes for games and the TOS. If you break the rules, you get banned. Full stop. 
---
There's literally no way for you to argue against this unless you're willfully ignorant. 
---
Yes.  This please.  I cannot tell you how many times I almost sold my armor pieces accidentally while in power armor.
---
think it's referring to reactive plates PA mod
---
The Laminated floor from the atom shop doesn't show up when you try to place it, it's completely invisible and my foundation doesn't even show up. Friends are having the same problem
---
Damn, I knew this day was probably coming sooner than later and was sad about it.
---
Thanks for your service up to this point dude. I hope the voting thing works out and the community keeps it up.
---
The Reddit gets more traction, trying to get an actual response from Bethesda on their forums is like trying to bleed water from a stone. It's a slow and not fruitful effort. Plus I wanted to talk to people who got the error message and weren't banned. Did you read the post?
---
Maybe it's time for you to switch up your habits. I've been going through this lately. But if you stay with gaming, find a new niche. I've been playing the crap out of Deep Rock Galactic, and my kids want to do a Minecraft series on YouTube so I've been working on something for that. I dig oldies like D2, and Dungeon Keeper successor War for the Overworld. If no MMO's are doing it for you, maybe, like me, you're just growing out of them. Might be time to find something else.
---
But there's no good coming out of crapping on a game that doesn't play how you want it to, or crapping on someone for liking that same game. FO76 has it's issues, we can all agree, and Bethesda is handling the launch poorly, no argument from me. But plenty of people still like it and play it. Maybe FO is just growing in a direction you don't like and it's time to find something else.
---
Ahh wth?! I can use almost NOTHING that is from the Atomshop.. My Mantaman(?) costume for example makes me invisible (except the head and my two hands + pipboy), and my camp is floating in the air because my foundation uses the vault-tec theme.....
---
BETHESDA PLEASE !! Change the WHOLE NOOBISH TEAM working on this game, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!
---
Marine Helmet, if you had it that was duped.
---
New to the online world, are you?
---
This happens every time there is a mass ban. 10,000 claims of "I am an innocent victim: followed by proof that each and every one is a lying sack of cheater shit.
---
No they just count the total of item X you had over 30days... Imagine you have 4 friends and you help them transfering 5k ultracite ammo per week. Just 5k each. In total 80k per month. If you had 20k yourself over those 30 days, you got flagged and auto-banned. Just because you had over 100k in over 30days. If Bethesda just banned people with 100k+ in total during maintenance, much less false bans would have happened. And it was more likely that those who got banned owned all that ammo.
---
I only saw one post on that scenario, the person said it was an error code due to something else but every player who has been banned gets that exact same code. 
---
To me that would be a connection error code with the justification hidden to user, meaning it could have multiple explanations. 
---
Maybe it's the xo1. I put the headlamp on the helmet last night, now that chassis has the atomic logo next to it. Makes it easier to tell them apart, I hope it's not gone.
---
Callers are standing by. Oh my is that number about to get busy. 
---
I’d love to see them relabel bulk steel etc to steel bulk as it’s done with steel scrap, that way all steel etc would be above and below each other which could help with the inventory/stash micro management but there’s def more improvements that could be made in the future
---
But you can only drink one at a time?
---
Sorry, it didn't auto download :(
---
What about content? You guys rushed this game so bad you're going to spend a year just fixing what should have been implemented to begin with and by the time everything is good most people will have moved on from this game because its so boring. The story is weak at best, it has a good start and is actually good, but any momentum built up is quickly lost with its quick abrupt ending. 
---
Why would you make it harder to become wanted by damaging camp items? so now people who like to harass others can constantly shoot turrets and troll people?
---
The Wall Cabinets will only attach to roofs, not walls
---
That should be right - I think what they were trying to fix is weight reduction under Bear Arms.
---
No, but if they're going to remove it they should add destructible foundations that can be stacked, indoor planters, and a variety of other things they removed switching between FO4 and FO76. Really, the main issue here isn't that campfire counts as ground in interesting ways. It's that foundations are indestructible.
---
I'd be willing to pay a little bit for some underwear options. Just a little though.
---
Well I never got the armor.  I got the plans, but not the armor.  It may be because I snuck through the cavern and never fought what was in there.
---
Oh boi
---
Makes sense. But maybe they could come up with some parameters to minimize abuse. Idk. It would be more convenient for me to designate my fast travel spot. And judging by where my visitor landed, the visitor's spot is about halfway on a line between mine and the CAMP device. 
---
There was no buffs
---
&gt; They can still go in and destroy the barriers if they want the workshop bad enough
---
Concrete foundation blocks are indestructible, so if you build them in the right spots and make them as tall as possible it's possible to completely block off the workshop unit in many cases.
---
Just bits and bytes. 
---
Getting some t45 is now on my “to do” list too, that will complete the collection lol
---
I kinda think they made a call with these mass suspensions that could only work because the game can't really sink any lower with public perception.
---
The game runs almost perfectly now. Animations are smooth, load times are very quick across the board. Enemies almost seem to spawn naturally instead just appearing. I went in and out of power armor several times last night just because i had never seen the full unbroken animation before. Melee combat is fun now, i can actually see enemies as they rush and dodge around me. Frame rate is stable, i can walk around any area without the fps tanking.
---
By suspending problem players they have given the game a foundation to build on, a foundation of stability the game has never had before. If the game was doing moderately good, they may have avoided don't this because of the outrage. But here we are, all the outrage doesn't mean shit to a playerbase this small and begrudged.
---
This is correct, the M79 and AGL are now classified as heavy weapons with today's patch and are intended to be affected by Demolition Expert but not Heavy Gunner. Hope that helps!
---
Fierce combat shotgun of fooding :)
---
The Lookup Failed thing is most likely because you're using an old version of an inventory tags mod.
---
Weapons: The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as heavy weapons, and correctly benefit from all heavy weapons perks except Heavy Gunner, as they benefit from Demolitions Expert instead.
---
Oh thank you so much for your in-depth answer! Since we are going in March to get the Whitesprings..er... Greenbrier discount rates then things like the caverns and springs would probably be best. Was planning on four or five days. Now thinking of a second trip at a later date lol! Thanks a bunch for your local expertise. 
---
It is a conflict with your mods. There are a few posts in this sub regarding how to fix the pref files.
---
&gt; Apparel: Underarmor no longer remains visible while wearing the Silver Shroud costume.
---
But not the Mantaman suit? It doesn't properly take up the hand slots. Please fix?!
---
Man a  stealth sniper build is great. You just have to have a few trusty guns on the side as well. With all the mountains in the game you can just perch yourself above most places and get stealth bonuses for days.
---
It was IN THE PATCH NOTES
---
Sure
---
From what ive read, INT doesnt effect xp gains for this game. Just the condition of crafted weapons. I could be wrong tho
---
Check his post he edited it and added the image himself lol
---
Obviously ultracite requires more resources and is less likely. There's way too much hostility here Haha.  The dev's are back tracking because they released a broken game and because of this you will get legit players, although rare, caught in the crossfire.
---
That's really the problem with it.  The assumption is that anyone who deliberately tries to incite PvP like this is most likely rolling in whatever the exploit-du-jour is.  They do it in bad faith - not looking for a real battle, not seeking a challenge, not acting as "Raiders."
---
i never noticed any of the positive radworm side effects, but when they wore off or were cured i would lose all damage resistance. Hopefully this was included in the radworm fix?
---
Edited to add in.
---
Yup...still waiting on that.
---
The grand hypocrisy that is online gaming.
---
Yea, not so much. people believe what they want to believe, and latch on to any information source that supports their position no matter how many times it has been proven to be bullshit. See any anti-vax group for examples.
---
Blarg.. it's clear enough now that I read it a second time lol.. but damn.. Just bear Arms and Stabilized .. I had high hopes for this :D
---
Tell them to stop cheating.
---
Yeah we need the scroller to just auto-craft, even at a slow pace.
---
I can tell already this is gonna piss me off trying to craft 1k+ ammo...
---
I'll say it.  The player is guilty.
---
i always found it funny when people would claim fallout76 took out the 'role playing' because there isn't 4 choice dialog options for each interaction.  its as if they honestly had no idea that role playing started with pen and paper and people talking to each other to make decisions.
---
No, according to law, it doesn't matter where the money originated - if there was any distinguishing characteristics of the money (and being in the bag would be a distinguishing characteristic) you have to make an attempt to find the owner. Sure, if you kept money that was part of a bank robbery (there's a case where robbers intentionally threw money out the window as they escaped and the FBI advised people that money was stolen and that finding it along the route would constitute theft.) you could be in bigger shit, but one way or the other the law is the law.
---
Your second example, is different than what is happening in the game - a better example would be if someone bought something that had been stolen, off the back of the truck so to speak.   You don't get to feign ignorance that you bought stolen goods, this is why Pawn shops will check for police reports for stolen goods, and why Gamestop requires and ID to buy used games.  
---
We close the older tickets and work off the newest so doing this would get you no assistance.
---
This was a minor quality of life patch, but failed to fix many key concerns. Energy weapons are still jacked up. Legendary mobs still can produce zero loot.
---
I believe they're talking about the Reactive Plates power armor mods.
---
Whoever is proof reading their outbound communications needs to get MORE people proof reading it.
---
Like 1 person from EVERY department needs to read it first, and give every bullet point a "check" mark that the wording is correct.
---
They have a lot of communication problems like this in their outbound communications.  The players shouldn't need constant "clarification" of what they mean with tweets, messages, and patch notes.....lol
---
Cool story bro
---
I didn't get the recipe &gt;.&gt; (I mean it gave me no stats I just liked the look of it)

Sorry, still cant see it
---
&gt; Everyone asked for it.
---
I didn't. 
---
*hasn't happened yet
---
They said this is coming, in some form.
---
&gt;The whole point was to overcome players and obstacles to get to the bench to take it over.
---
I've seen people build massive walls of stash boxes that completely surround the workbench and are too high to jump over even with marsupial. Since stash boxes are indestructible it's literally impossible to capture those workshops.
---
I got some damage loss, my BE .50cal peak on around 330-350 damage and now aroung 240-260. I was wondering why, maybe the Adrenal reaction serum.
---
Try PDAnet. I use it on my straight talk walmart phone to tether to my work computer because I can't Ebay on the shit satellite they use here (we sell stuff). While my use for it is simply because my phone doesn't have the option, there is an option you can check when connecting that says "Hide Tether Usage (Only needed for certain carriers)." This may let you bypass idiotic carrier rules, but it's a paid app. It's limited in it's free/trial version. It's worth whatever I spent on it though as it can turn any shit internet connection into a good one so long as there is an LTE signal. It'll tether 3G too but that shit's too slow for anything but maybe reading only on reddit.
---
POIDH
---
Dont know if I can believe this lol
---
I just got the game a little while agoI’m only level 30 but I’m having so much fun with the game. I’ve only been disconnected a handful of times. Maybe 2 or 3.

A lot of people see this kind of comparison and automatically say "means he must not have done things legit" all that says to me is "well it IS possible, so... Only him and bethesda know what really is going on". I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt

You're less and less visible with each additional piece.

So oddly enough, it was my controller (although it worked before and works in other games) randomly decided to switch controllers before trying more drastic measures and it worked!

Need a mouth harp and a chair with a jug of moonshine beside ya.
---
when u get the plans..make sure u have the double crafting perk when u scrap..ive never ever seen those plans
---
tl;dr
---
Tall stuff is what does this.
---
The devs need to change the way in which the height of items interacts with what surface it gets snapped to.
---
Why ? It's a game with a weight limit.  Tons of players do it.  Even players who play legitimately.  600 stash weight cap. And 300 ish pound character weight cap isn't much if you play a ton and find alot of cool weapons you want to save.
---
Not lately, no. Have been finding a ton of Two Shot weapons lately though!

I’m going to guess that it will be directed to a voicemail system that no one is assigned to to listen to people and won’t get answered much like tickets...lol

&gt;White Knighting (Dupe Hunters) – This one is going to be controversial, but I rather suspect that a decent number of our most recently banned comrades fall into this category. These are the people that heard about duping and said “How can I get in on that action and not have guilty conscious about it?” Hence our White Knights were born. These were the a-holes that took it on themselves to run around looking for dupers to steal their loot and proclaim “Victory” in the face of evil-doers. Sure you dumped that loot into the bottom of a lake, I believe you.
---
Honestly, I'm glad these pretentious douchebags got banned more than the actual DuPeRs tbh.
---
Confirmed to work.  However, one of my installed mods (Perk Loadout Manager) isn't working anymore. Not surprising at all, and will probably get it's own fix soon.
---
I have this issue but the only mod I had was the known plans mod, which has now been deleted. What do?
---
This game is strictly a melee game now. The only way left to feel powerful. Even if you’re 40 levels above the ghoul you’re fighting.
---
OMG this!
---
Maybe I’m too old to understand gaming culture these days, but I have never had the inclination to demand anything from a developer or game community.
---
There are so many games and alternatives out there now, that if I’m not having a good time, I turn off the game and go to the next thing.
---
Oh my god, you’re awesome hahahahaha this made me laugh out loud!
---
Yeah, having 1 of every TSE is exactly the same as recieving 10 stimpacks and common CAMP plans?
---
**That 2nd level noob shouldn't be able to build a piano in his camp yet yet!?! Over powered cheaters!!!!**

---
Yep same here. Only the negatives
---
He didn't delete his post, the mods did.
---
Farming legendaries really hasn't change much. Other than a few legendary creature spawns being reduced. The Uranium Fever and AWOL Armaments events are still great options.
---
same here.
---
How the fuck do you have 900 hours played already?!?!? The game has been out just over 3 months. Let’s say 90 days. Which means you’ve played at least 10 hours per day, every day, since it released. Are you fucking kidding me? You can’t be for real. And if you are, that’s pathetic. I’m a pathetic worm of a human, don’t get me wrong, I know my lack of worth. But holy shit dude you reeeaaaalllly need to find something else to do. 
---
I feel sorry for you bro. Hope you get unbanned
---
I dont want to be that guy but maybe spending 12 hours of the day for 3 months straight could have possibly been the reason you were feeling low on yourself despite you actually thinking the gaming isn't the problem. Nothing wrong with going out and breathing in some fresh air and drinking some tea to help with the mental.
---
Says the guy that doesn't think that the easy to gather materials needed to craft ammo are easy to gather, that it requires *dedicated farming*. Again, you need to learn how to play the game and basic logic skills before you can go around calling *other people idiots*.
---
I've got a friend who got banned, someone who isn't smart enough to figure out Reddit, definitely not smart enough to figure out how to dupe. I know all his friends, because they're my friends, all of them successful enough in this game that they would have no reason to duplicate anything.
---
That friend you just called an idiot (he isn't tech savvy sure, and the process of cheating might be too complicated for him, but he's not an idiot) spent an hour of rage and frustration messaging me through PlayStation yesterday. He's not lying to me, he's got nothing he could even hide from me- it's much more likely that he crafted too much ammo or something else that's ridiculous for Bethesda to classify as "cheating", than the guy who has pretty much every weapon and armor he could ever want suddenly decided he needed to cheat.
---
But, I'm not sure you're smart enough to understand this since you're dumb enough to say anyone who got banned is an idiot and must therefore be cheaters.
---
I’d expand this a bit. Once the player gets more than 20 caps they become re-wanted, this time for debt. Instead of bounty hunters we have debt collectors. When you kill someone who owes a debt to another player for a bounty, the other player gets the caps minus a 25% debt collecting fee that you get. 
---
As of right now, the downsides of not having enough caps for a bounty are not restrictive enough. 
---
Question about CAMP changes.. 
---
I was in a workshop area that someone claimed and noticed a safe with a level 3 lock was on it that the player wasn't able to open.  I opened it, becoming wanted due to that.  Has that changed?
---
If Bethesda is trying to repay us with legendaries then tell me how may of those legendaries weren’t absolute garbage. Did you even get one decent armor piece or gun to replace something you already have?
---
I got a friend who stores 1 stars at lvl 35 just because it's his favorite type of gun, ie. a troubleshooters handmade lvl 35
---
None of those you listed are against FO76 TOS. So not sure what your point is.
---
Thanks for the reminder!
---
Nope, no new content.
---
They're so fixated on bugs, nerfs, and duping that they've completely forgotten what makes Fallout FUN.
---
Content, content, content.  Heck in previous Fallout titles there was DLC!  Imagine that!  More content!
---
I miss new content.  RIP Fallout
---
You should merge lists with /u/Aten_Ra He does excellent work on documenting bugs.
---
Can't see what? My comments? You realize that they are not invisible, right?
---
Warfling
---
Just a clarification that seems to be the crucial point here: Bethesda’s email does not show what he has but what they’ve tracked as “acquired” ammo over 30 days. He doesn’t have that ammo. He’s picked up or traded or mules or whatever counts for “acquiring ammo” that much in 30 days.
---
His whole point is that he thinks transferring shit to mules increase the “acquired” number over and over to make it that high and that he only really had a fraction of the amount listed.
---
Don't worry about your downvotes, you only got them because the truth hurts bethesda fanboys
---
Weapons and armor cap at Level 45 or 50, depending on the type.  Beyond that, you will find Legendaries.  In 76, a Legendary can have more than one effect, up to three.  So, there are many possibilities, even once you've found all the different types of weapons/armor.
---
I'm not sad, constantly losing Marsupial was super annoying
---
Yeah ik that sucks. I farmed in Uranium fever, and I got an actually good legendary weapon. A 3* AAE gat gun, lvl 40, and I was so proud and happy. Now it's gone, probably for good
---
I’ve crafted hats from the more broadly named headgear. 
---
Yeah, to my point it doesn't specify the PAST 30-days like you said. It clearly says ANY 30 days. I'm guessing you have a mule account and maybe transferred large amount of ammo and that added up. Not saying you should be banned, but the majority of people who claimed they were unfairly banned actually weren't.
---
Thanks for your report! Couple of questions for you:
---
* Did you have Rad Worms prior to today's patch?
---
* Do you have any mutations other than Adrenal Reaction? If so, do their positive effects display correctly?
---
Can't upvote enough! There's enough bugs, glitches and idiots around. You would think a little comic relief would be welcome. 
---
Why can't you use the Siphon holotape? If it's the same issue I had (too many holotapes in my inventory apparently), you just drop all but the Siphon in a nearby world container. After you download the EMP just grab your tapes back from the container. Kind of a shitty workaround but it worked for me.
---
If you feel you have been unfairly banned then uninstall. This game isn't going anywhere interesting anytime soon.

Couple of questions for you:
---
Thanks for your report!
---
You on PC using mods? If so:
---
Any mentioning about the damage bug? It keeps getting worse as it seems.
---
Enemies gain half the health back most times from a hit. 
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll take a look when I get home and make sure.
---
BUT l DID NOT DO DOOPS AND STILL BANNED. Check my history. I am legit too quit. 
---
Broken how?
---
Players should not be bulking all junk though, it's a stupid use for plastic.  For now they should just force players to  scrap bulk manually until the 'new functionality' is added.
---
thats impossible, would have meant you only slept 3 hours unless you kept the game running for 3 months straight.
---
I feel like it would be such a waste of time for someone to do that though. I openly invite griefers to whittle everything in my camp down to 1hp, just to give everyone else on the world at least 30 minutes of freedom from them
---
Exactly, launching a nuke is basically dedicating yourself to a 2-hour session. Depending on the frequency of these restarts, this could become a real pain in the butt
---
Depends how much I get attacked.  Outside wondering it can last a few hours.   But if I'm exploring caves or buildings less time. Because it seems one shot aggros the entire area towards you.
---
Since I got excavator armor I just wear level 20 heavy leather armor for wondering and I pull out PA when fighting gets tough.
---
High school above principles office or just south of train station in barn near mirrlurks 
---
Yeah this concerns me
---
Of course it did.  Jesus Christ.
---
first they came for the dupers, but I did not speak out because I was not a duper... 
---
one of the two isn't applying. my bloodied .50 cal went from ~250 damage to 167.
---
Indeed, i am having fun in the game! i didnt know most players are salty as hell.  
---
the 900 hour guy also made several hundred thousand rounds of ultracite ammo. 
---
For power armor you can get a stealth boy torso mod. I know it's on the x01 and t51... Probably t60 too. If you do, get the agility perk that makes stealth boys last longer or your power armor battery drain goes up a lot. 
---
Take a few radaways and then go stand in some radiation until adrenal procs again.
---
it just seems silly to me to think that every time this guy decided he wanted to use a different build, he would transfer over his entire stash of ammo from his mule, then still have leftovers significant enough to transfer back. or that he transfers small amounts so frequently that it racked up over 30 days. plus if he's crafting the ammo, we're creeping back into numbers that are pretty out there when considering that he is actually using this ammo. ("out there" meaning feasible, but requiring significant dedication)
---
you're right, i hadnt considered heavy trading either. if they are in fact counting this way, that would explain it. but the counter argument to that would be why didnt 900 guy cite his trading as a possible source of the "mistake?"
---
while Bethesda's actions and wording would suggest that the ammo is registered in this way, we dont know that for a fact. It definitely would explain the significant amount of "false positives" (assuming that these are real). that being said, it still doesnt make sense that they would go with this flawed metric and assert that their ruling is infallible. i mean, they have to know that it is or isnt counting those traded rounds. logically, i dont see how they could see total handled, including trades, being an option. like you said, trading that much for someone who is an avid trader is definitely possible. would be a ridiculous mistake.
---
maybe they are still getting to the bottom of things before making a statement. I guess certainty is important when dealing with things like this and they dont want to backtrack several times. i just hope tht we get a definitive answer either way. im tired of the constant drama on this sub.
---
side note, just to be clear, im not taking sides. i dont know if this was a mistake or not. i'd lkike to believe it wasnt, but i havent been convinced by anything we've seen either way.
---
plot twist. They're not actually a woman.
---
Can we get durability use fixed for shotgun mods on Tesla and Laser rifles, and have those guns count as shotguns for perk use?  Would be great for us shotgun people who want to branch out.
---
Mouth harps are actually my jam IRL
---
Go to watoga station then go west, along the southern concrete edge of watoga. Should be 3 to 5 of them patrolling on the regular, reasonably easy to handle. Destroy then scap both weapons and junk heads. Hope servers, repeat. Should have it in no time.
---
You forget that the game caps your resistance so you cannot get above like 90% or something. The Dodgy perk closes the gap with the ap cost avoid.
---
Glad to hear it! Keep it up and happy hunting! 
---
I worked in "escalations/retention" for a tech warranty company, where contracts were involved. 
---
Asking to get sent to me was the exact opposite. You just asked to be sent to a guy who's entire job was knowing and understanding the limitations and obligations of the contract. A guy who the company essentially gave the ok to remove the kid gloves, where customer ass kissing stops. 
---
But again, it’s not a joke if it’s not funny 
---
Seriously. I haven't used the main bunker door since I found the side entrance. I'm *waaaay* too impatient.
---
Left, right, what's the difference? Those places are to the right for me. Just saying.
---
They say you have no life? I say you're a champion. Never stop that revolution, bruv.
---
Tetrinox... that person you are talking to... about a month ago or so he was bragging about being a successful duper in this very sub. Apparently he has had a change of heart? Lol some people...
---
The email doesn't say what you think it does. Did you read it closely? It doesn't say he currently has that much ammo, just that that much ammo went through his inventory.
---
The problem is that say you have 50k of one type of ammo and you drop it on the ground in your CAMP to do some junk bulking to make space and then pick up the 50k ammo after done crafting, the way bethesda is counting the ammo that would mean he had 100k ammo in his inventory.
---
The fact he has mules makes that number seem over inflated even quicker, because the number is getting added every time it gets moved. Say he mules the 50k ammo to his mule, now his main character and his mule are showing 50k ammo over 30 days. Now say he mules it back to his main account, his main now shows 100k ammo over 30 days with 50k ammo from the mule over 30 days. So just 50k ammo now looks like 150k ammo.
---
Do you not see how that could really make the numbers seem way off? Especially using heavy weapons ammo.
---
Thats insane, I have 500 days in total on my wow account so 12000 hours and i have played the game since 2004... So 15 years. You are playing the game at approximately 3x as much as i played wow.
---
My power fist went from 1800 on paper to 1400.
---
there's fun, and then there's a dbag with a bunch of stash boxes formed into a wall.  Also, the whole wanted thing. They could get rid of becoming wanted for destroying stuff at a workshop, and instead just have it flag the player hostile with the current workshop owner.

---
I’m glad you’re trying to fix this but it’s worth pointing out that many people get diseases and let them run their courses and just plain don’t notice. Any answer about whether or not someone logged out with rad worms could be an unreliable answer. 
---
I run adrenal reaction and almost always had rad worms so I’ll test this out when I get home and I’ll check for rad worms first thing to see if I logged off with the little buddies. 
---
You lost me at grenades and mines. Still hope you get your account back though. Good luck 
---
np. Hope it helps.
---
Maybe not for your sense of humor but everyone laughs at different things. Don't pigeon hole my jokes because YOU don't find them funny. 
---
The non-Atom Shop Potted Plants
---
Lol. Damn straight. Must be tiresome having to spend so much energy online bashing all the games they don’t approve of! 
---
Go to audio setting can switch to game or prox chat
---
That was it. 
---
you don't get to just pay 5 caps though. becoming wanted in this game is actually a big pain in the ass.  At low cap levels, no one will bother coming to put you out of your misery, and it lasts a long time not being able to see others and wondering what you will be in the middle of when someone decides to just take a shot at you. I needs fixing imo.
---
&gt;Folks when you see a suitcase with multiple stacks of 10,000 items, it was duped. Don’t pick it up and if you do, submit a ticket explaining what happened (might be easy to do if you thought you were picking up someone’s “extras” at a trading post).
---
Just listen to The Offspring: [Woohoo, don't pick it up I say, you're gonna be bummed that you went that way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzDMwFUe02w)
---
There's things I would do for the Dev who fixed that.  Just .. things.
---
I wish I hadn't have been so stupid to think that I could pick up that junk in that bag that automatically jumped my weight up to 800+ from 195 as I usually keep it, even though I died and lost it all an hour later. Sucks, but I understand why I was flagged now, and so I suppose I'll patiently wait until my suspension is lifted. 
---
Gives me a better reason to start my yearly spring cleaning in my home. 
---
I only use PA when going into a nuke zone as I love my grey sequin dress and fashionable sunglasses too much to give up. 
---
I play melee, love scavenging and scrapping, have a fully maxed out (nerfed) White Knight, can go toe to toe with any enemy and I have never run out of ballistic fiber. My bff, by contrast, is challenged with having enough ballistic fiber. I think her problem is she has a gun build so it takes her longer to kill things so her armor takes more damage than mine does.
---
I think that's the issue.
---
Have switched through all the in game settings multplie times 
---
Its because of your mods, there are updates out to fix this, but they aren’t specific to the mods, just some custom stuff
---
Well the critical thing is a bug, dare I even say, an exploit. Critical hits should NOT ignore damage reducing effects.
---
All I can say is thanks to the considerate players who leave Drop Site C2 out of the blast radius when going after the SBQ.
---
Beat me to my buddy did that for about 2 weeks.
---
You are a duper yourself, admitted it a month ago.
---
In March they are changing the energy weapons well thats what I heard anyways.
---
Yeah, I did that for a while. Got downvoted heavily for asking for the headers from an email.
---
I’ve since unsubscribed from this subreddit and just stop in from time to time to see how if the toxicity/bullshit has abated. Spend most of my time with the filthy casuals.
---
I dont blame devs for the poor choices of exploitative users. They got their bans, and should go play Anthem.
---
Now this sounds like a good patch.
---
Unfortunately no, they haven't been improving it.  If anything they've been "stealth nerfing" legendary loot drops.
---
As a hardcore Whitesprings farmer...........I remember the Golf Club fondly.  Walk in the front door, shoot once, run like mad to go jump on top of something, 20-30 ghouls come POURING out of the place.  You'd burn tons of ammo, melee armor and weapons would break, stimpacks would get used repeatedly.  Many legendaries including multiple 2-3 star ones.  You were basically guaranteed at LEAST one 3 star, a couple of 2 star, and a bunch of 1 star items.
---
Try that now.  Walk in the front door, shoot once.  Don't bother running.  If you have a decent gun or melee weapon, dispatch the TEN GHOULS that exit the building.  Feel very lucky if you get a 3 or even a 2 star item now.
---
Not all nerfs have been publicized.  They're doing it in the background hoping you won't notice.
---
Makes me not want to do Whitesprings anymore.  Why farm with NERFED Spawn rates on top of already BAD RNG?
---
Wait sense when did the email state what items they think were duped? I got the same email about 100k items and being banned until the issue is fixed but mine never told me what they thought i duped. Either this is Photoshopped or a diffrent email. 
---
I've never seen that specific mod for sale at any of the vendors... If you're on PC, send me a PM with your in-game name and I'd be happy to pop a suppressor on your LA for you this evening, I hope to get online around or shortly after 7pm EST. I can also do the hardened mod if you need it. I think I got lucky because I unlocked both of those after scrapping very few of them.
---
None explicitly are banned, all 3 are common to exploits. Everyone knows where the grenades come from. We know what mules are for, and why macros are used.  To pretend that this guy was not taking advantage  of exactly what bethesda was after is just silly. 
---
&gt;  It's just sad to see how toxic &amp; ignorant this sub became
---
I hate hate hate hate HATE this fucking logic to no end. There are plenty of good posts here, in fact you're free to make your own posts here in the vein of what you feel is good. QUIT WHINING ABOUT A SUBREDDIT BEING SOOOOO TOXICCCCC BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE WITH WHAT PEOPLE POST AND UPVOTE. It's not toxic, it just doesn't constantly stroke your bias, get over it. 
---
like...............?
---
Yeah I have a few mutations and they are all correct apart from this one. I use class freak so I have -12HP and no positive effect at all. Other mutations seem fine. 
---
I didn’t realise how heavily dependant on this particular mutation I was!!! PLEASE FIX THIS MUTATION. PLEASE PLEASE :-(
---
These are nice changes but what am I supposed to do at endgame as a player that has no interest in pvp? I've explored the entire map and I feel pretty bored of repeatedly farming nuke zones. 
---
Good.
---
&gt; either make the quantity slider stop when I hit 1 item,
---
That was addressed
---
&gt;Transfer Menu: The transfer bar now correctly stops at 1 when scrolling to reduce the transfer quantity.
---
Thanks for the awnser.
---
No I did not have Rad Worms before or after the Patch
---
I dont have every Mutation but from all I have Adrenalreaktion is the only one not working right
---
Also the crit-meter seems to be a bit bugged since patch 5, especially when I use crits repedetly. Please look at this issue too thanks.
---
Try putting it on auto? Maybe your mic been on mute this whole time? 😂
---
If you want workshops, you have to accept PvP, just how it was intended.
---
Yeah boi! 
---
I like seeing which exploits they fix.
---
You're a duper yourself. You bragged about this in this very sub about a month ago... along with inviting people to be griefed by you and your friends at Grafton. I confronted you about it and you admitted it. Quit the bs already. 
---
Turn your mods off.
---
Yep, did have rad Worms.
---
Currently have the following mutations which have the correct values:
---
Carnivore
---
Grounded
---
Marsupial
---
Scaly Skin
---
Speed Demons
---
Twisted Muscles
---
Only Adrenal Reaction is weong
---
It's your mods.
---
With my PVP setting to no PVP and me not fighting back that is a clear sign I want nothing to do with it. When he keeps attacking me to the point where I logged out, that is griefing in my book....Also PVP'ing players that are 3 times lower than you, really?
---
But I found the Marine Tactical Helmet plans at a normal plan spawing location in Watoga... and it's still in my inventory right now. And I can still craft it... 
---
Has to be something else right?
---
&gt;It's really quite the time waste, that's why I said if they're going to duplicate anything, they aren't going to duplicate ammo.
---
This is kinda pointless. You can dupe all at the same time. But if YOU personally find duping tedios, then don't do it :)
---
Are the component to make that ammo rare? Ultracite or Flux? One Pure or Stable Violet Flux requires 10 raw violet flux, 1 Harden mass, and one high radiation fluid. Super duper would get you two.  Getting 100000 ultracite ammo would require 2500 stable or pure violet flux.  I can collect around 100 raw violet flux near fissure prime in one run.  With super duper that would net 20 stable violet flux max. Doing that 125 times, or 4 times a day for 30 days get you to 100000. Then you still need acid and cloth for gunpowder, along with lead and steel, and the time spent finding nuke zones, fast traveling, and using a chemistry station.  If a team is working together to get the components it may be possible.
---
The Nuka Girl thing is actually something wrong with that outfit. What OP is complaining about is what happens when you have mods and they drop a patch. It breaks, your atomic shop stuff disappears, floors disappear in particular, and you get purple textures.  It's entirely within OP's power to fix. 
---
No mention of nerfing the weapons again?  My unyielding bloodied build now sucks. what's up with that? please shed some light if you know something?
---
I don't own the game either, this post just came across my suggested articles. On my phone.
---
What I did I made around 15k or something like that 5.56 ammo then bulked on 5.56 from buying from other players because yeah making 100k of something would take a while 
---
You ever pvp?  You know, sever hop and take every workshop thats occupied....(Cause your high level and board) I've had guys drop insane amounts of stuff (like 2-3 pages worth of junk from one guy but it happens all the time). Good to sell, craft etc.  Its literally the fastest way to get mass mounts of gear and caps.
---
There are many way to get gear and just tripping over it is probly the slowest. We are in a fend for yourself wasteland and stealing is the most effiecient way!
---
Nope. I'm finally gonna fill it with teddy bears!
---
Gotta catch em all.
---
I don't mind defending from other players if they actually want the workshop.
---
What I do mind is being harassed by people that just want to kill me and have no interest in the workshop.
---
Have tried every setting, auto, are and team but nothing works not does the mic symbol appear next to my name :/ plus my mic doesnt have a mute option, using Bose q.c 35s
---
You can also buy ammo from players dont forget. Thats how i got alot of my ammo. You buy 1k rounds here and 2k rounds there and a few transactions later u can easily have 100k rounds of ammo if you mix crafting and scavenging in to the picture. 
---
I have a few TSE now and was very temped, I just really didnt want any of his crap...Been through this in other games and dont want to deal with it here. No I am not upset about it, it just makes me shake my head is all...
---
Show me a screenshot. Most workshops have their work bench in a position where it cannot be blocked entirely due to clipping with existing structures. For the ones that have a work bench in a position facilitating fortification, I have never once seen what you describe.
---
But the reply you quoted was in response to someone who specifically complained about the defensive walls, which are
---
100% destructible and can be overcome if you want the workshop bad enough.
---
If Bethesda wanted to make it so picking a lock or destroying an item at a workshop only triggered PVP with the owner and their party instead of flagging a user as wanted for the entire server, that would have been a fair change.
---
This change however is a response to an issue that by and large does not exist. 
---
I don't even own FO76, and you still look like a smug prick. :') you should definitely feel embarrassed talking like that
---
I think i had rad worms as well. I have other mutations but they work fine. Just adrenal reacrion doesn't work....
---
Yeah, it did. No one wanted PvP he says. I say, be careful what you asked for. Simple stuff bud.
---
Your last removed posts top comment mentioned you finding 200,000 Nuka colas. Why lie dude, specially when you post proof of your wrong doings 
---
Agreed, dupers should be banned they ruined the economy within the first few weeks of the game release, but some of these exploits were in fallout 4 and not patched - what did they think would happen?
---
Why would anyone need to reasonably need to carry more than 5k of any ammo, I am a heavy gunner, my two main weapons are a 50 cal and a Gatling gun. I carry 5k of each. That weighs a lot, and I have to carry fusion cores also because, power armor/ stabilized. Only 14 str all 3 heavy gunner perks maxed out traveling pharmacy and full charge for conserving cores. Sometimes if I'm just doing vendor runs I will switch in all my carry weight perks . I'm getting off point sorry . So it takes me about an hour of scorchbeast hunting( hopping from one fissure site to another ) to use a thousand ammo. The guns I pick up off all the scorched end up making about a thousand rounds of ammo. So I can't figure out why anyone would go through all the trouble to carry so many more bullets than could be used in a week or month. They are so easily crafted. Not to mention the atoms you get for daily crafting challenges. 
---
With all these changes, if they add 25% more CAMP budget and another 10K to the caps limit, i won't care for new content for a long time
---
Maybe you should stick with what worked.... Amazing but buggy, Single-player experiences.  
---
No clue. Just wanted to point out that NV had it. 
---
Fresh air and tea are all well and good but sometimes those suggestions sound a little trite when you're at your lowest. I say do what you need to do until the mood passes, there's not much else you can do! 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
You still available for a BOS shielded?
---
They need a thing that migrates one world over to another server. Prob won't happen though.
---
right now it says 8.1k "in appalachia"  
---
i take that to mean, 8.1k people are playing ATM
---
I'm being affected by this issue as well.
---
no, I don't think I had Rad Worms prior to the patch but I can't be sure.
---
I have 4 other mutations, Bird Bones, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, and Speed Demon and they all seem to working fine.
---
I'm going to miss the extra 100 pounds of carry weight they seemed to add despite my having no mutations. That was weird but nice. I was actually able to stop using the PA for a bit though the stash increase should hopefully get me back to that point.
---
I actually thought this was what Player Vending would be, but that could just as easily be some kind of trading menu option on the player.
---
Did you need two accounts to say that?
---
I have no problem admitting it. I am.
---
Stoked that the helmet is removable from the Nuka outfit. Gonna see that everywhere now lol
---
My best guess is he is either a kid or a v sad adult himself and that he got banned weeks ago. He has been doing this for over a month, acting like he never duped and commenting on people who did. I confront him every chance I get. He's full of it.
---
Same here. I really just collect and hoard ballistic fiber to occasionally gift to a friend.
---
I think snalleygaster drops adhesive, but maybe I'm remembering wrong? I'm sure you know how to mark what junk you need for search, I only use this for what I currently need, so if my goal was ammo I would only mark acid (because iron and lead ore are too easy to get through events and collecting from ore nodes).
---
Even if you only play an hour a day, capturing even a single workshop and taking less than 5 minutes to build resource generators is still worth it. You don't need to collect from it often, I would say once an hour at most, so even if you only have an hour to play- first 5 minutes capture and build whatever workshop that has what you need the most, go do whatever you'd normally do, then collect right before you log off.
---
All it takes is spending that 5 minutes a day to get you to a point where you spend more time playing the game, less time looking for materials. Though, unless you started the game later than most, farming might be 100% of why you even play.. so I can understand if you didn't want to do this.
---
Truly I think the reason anyone would collect absurd amounts of stuff whether it's ammo or junk, is because they hope that whatever future content we get will make it relevant again.
---
Ammo is one thing that most players have complained about not being able to sell or break down, so any player that stockpiles it is likely hoping this is something that will change and be made useful again.
---
My whole game experience brings me to about 65,000 ammo, and pry um idk several thousand junks? Thousand flux? I still ever had 1 piece if any armor/weapon
---
Exactly! Craft your own adventure!
---
I've had several cases where I launch a nuke - particularly at Whitesprings - and if I enter the nuke zone in a rush, it chokes up and crashes out. It seems (limited sample size) that if I let the blast zone fully process before moving in, I avoid crashes.
---
Just in case, I've also taken to making friend requests during, or right after, launch, so I can get back to the same server if I, and not the server, crash.
---
🎶 Jenny Jenny who can I turn to...🎵
---
Pssst: that means you're running mods and your mods are breaking the game. 
---
Agree to Disagree man  
---
Its a PvP game, as soon as theres a separeate server than you can call it Griefing on the PvE server.
---
I'm tired of people doing stuff like say claiming a workshop and then crying griefers when it gets attacked. Its the point of them.
---
That is wrong. You enter a shop area and turrets ignore you until you try to capture. Then you can destroy everything without being wanted.
---
They listened :)
---
I find the people I grief, cry alot more than I do. Unless you count hysterical laughing as "crying."
---
Most games don’t allow contesting from stealth; I would not assume it works that way, although claiming in the first place can be done from stealth. So we’ll see. 
---
If people didn’t try to make it impossible without incurring a bounty which was not the design intent we wouldn’t have this change. 
---
I'm not sure why you got the downvotes and the post you responded to got upvotes, but you are for sure correct about this and it's a bit asinine to believe the reverse to be reasonable.
---
My opinion wasn’t bad. FWIW if you had plead mea culpa I woulda given you the upvote.
---
Making mistakes is easy.  learning from them is harder if you can’t accept remorse.
---
Hi, I just wanted to peek in here to ask about Watoga.
---
I have had several occasions where the bots will spawn then immediately drop dead.  It will affect entire areas of the city.
---
Is this something the team is aware of?
---
Bruh you need to go outside and get some fresh air bc you've spent 900 hours playing a garbage game that doesn't deserve your time (and you need your exercise)
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I'd recommend fallout new Vegas or fallout 4 for the time being new Vegas is very fun 
---
Could I get your weapons or junk if ya leaving lol I am on PS4 also 
---
Not at all, my bf and I sitting together on the train looking at your BS as usual. We love commenting in your sudden but steady change of heart.
---
No, you misunderstood me. Keep starched genes, just build your health back up and then lower it again to make the adrenal buff proc. You don't have to refarm it.
---
It's your mods.  
---
Add these to your Fallout76custom.ini, right after sResourceArchive2list
---
" SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2"
---
If you asked for any one of these things you asked for it. You just didn’t get it the way you expected. 
---
Do you realize though why the way you do things shouldn't be the way it's SUPPOSED to be? If i had the game, and i legitimately had the materials/space/whatever else to craft 20k, or even 100k of something all at one sitting, why should i have to worry about setting off red flags by trying to play the game normally? Doesn't it seem a bit silly to you to have to limit yourself for fear of the game punishing you for playing it how it's designed?
---
&gt;perhaps you moaners should try developing a simple game to see how hard it is. 
---
that's a facile argument, either release the game in a playable state or keep it in BETA until it is...  the patches so far are mostly good but the game is still far from a full retail release.
---
They dupe things like weapons and then scrap then for exp. So item duping is also an exp workaround. So why not scrap stuff you can use to make bullets?
---
Especially since you never know when they will fix it and don't want to run out of their favorite ammo types.....ever.
---
With the new hard limit on char weight will also help with this.
---
No, the shop isn't broken. Those are your mods that are broken.   
---
You can camp fairly close to each other. My husband built his camp close to mine, we can wave to each other from our balconies.
---
My son built his camp fairly close too. Not as close as my husband built his but I can still see his camp through the trees. 
---
They are all within a hop skip and jump of each other. 
---
Which is fine for us. We've kind of got a little family village set up if we play together!
---
You said you haven't played in two months anyway, so why bother posting this or holding onto the game. You act as if you didnt know that recieving over 100k obviously duped items was in violation of every online game ever. Nobody is going to miss you. Give the game to someone who understands that cheating, while fun if you dont get caught, is still cheating. 
---
It's been quite a laugh.
---
Primed weapons imo are useless o
---
They add what like 3 damage to a weapon lol I only used it on the gauss rifle
---
Almost the same exact thing happened to me on Grand Theft Auto V for PC, so I actually believe you. Sorry man.
---
You sir, are the myth, the legend. 900 hours guy never looked so small
---
Nah he is still the same. Except now he is making fun of all the other cheaters because he didn’t get caught and they did. He seems to be almost getting off on the fact. Poor poor child to have such a sad existence in real life that they must resort to such things so they can feel big online. 
---
Sounds legit.
---
Did you ask for any one of these? Probably. 
---
Do a little research.
---
PLEASE address this.  Energy weapons are effectively worthless.  I want to be able to use my Plasma rifle, I miss the green goo!
---
What do you mean about "everyone knows where the grenades come from"? They are dirt cheap to make with mats from super mutants?
---
And yes everyone knows what mules are for. To hold more items when your main character is full. Pretty much all online games with trading economies have mules, Hell back when I played diablo 2 a shit ton I had entire mule accounts because of all the items I magic found.
---
As for macros, yes they are used to help press buttons, like how they are used to swap out perk card load outs when trading or selling items. 
---
What is it that he was taking advantage of? The fact that he was good at farming?
---
You do realize that the email doesn't even say he currently has 160k ammo on him right? Just that that much went through his inventory over a 30 day period. The problem with that is that bethesda is counting ammo multiple times. Say you have 25k ammo you drop in your camp to make room to craft junk into bulk to make some storage space and then pick the 25k ammo back up after, then bethesda counts that as 50k ammo in your inventory over the 30 days. Add in muling the ammo off to save space and then back when needed and the ammo ends up being counted 3 times then at least, once when he creates it, a second time when the mule gets it, and then a third time when he moves it back to his main character. thus 25k ammo is counted as having 75k ammo go through your inventory.
---
Do you not see the issue with that? Especially for people who trade a lot?
---
Change of heart? Not at all.
---
Read carefully. What I'm glad about, is that my competition has vanished almost completely. Ebay, the in-game market, and of course the new players, are mine for the taking.
---
I mean, if you call out “yoohoo” and run towards a guy and start attacking him while he is obviously ignoring you, that’s griefing and you’re an asshole. 
---
I’ve heard that, but it was like $100 last time I checked?? :( 
---
ah, thats why i couldn't do redo it
---
Well are you reading the communications from Bethesda? Because they told us that new content is coming. Seems like March.
---
When exactly don’t know.
---
No Harmonica either...
---
If he was lying he wouldn't want to understand you correctly
---
Your straight goofin kid.
---
Already found what was changed and fixed it
---
They have *limited* character. But no influence on anything in the greater world, doing Rose's quest doesn't change anything in the world, or change anything to anybody in the world (because there is nobody lol). The only thing is changes is the player's understanding of the tactics of dead factions (again, lol). It's a lazy way to lengthen the "main quest" and to add more tools for the boring as shit gunfights. 
---
So yes, they have character. But not very much. They're just cardboard cutouts with the purpose of expositing meaningless bullshit to the player. 
---
I agree.  No joke, I'd really like to have more underwear options, since that's how my character rolls. XD
---
Sure, what console? 
---
Someone else just reported the same thing, oh man Bethesda sure know how to break stuff instead of fixing it
---
I could tell you a few things about people who need to "feel big" online, but I'm a lady ;P he will get banned eventually if he hasn't already.
---
Can confirm. Quit for Anthem for now. 
---
I agree wholeheartedly. Most of this games problems come the risk vs reward not being balanced properly.
---
Only if I'm not a supervisor.  I'm not front line support, my title is the same as the team leads and the people in the department who take escalation calls from the front line support. My department works support for email and social media contacts, and everyone in my department has supervisor title and permissions so we can resolve problems without having to bring other people in.
---
So, when someone says "I want talk to a supervisor", instead of saying "I am a supervisor", I let them talk to another supervisor.  My direct supervisor is now administrative and rarely is going to have reason to talk to a customer - when things are escalated to him, he researches the issue and gets one of us to reach out to them.
---
Soorry to ruin your CS justice boner.
---
What do you get from making up stuff like this?
---
&gt; if I’m not having a good time, I turn off the game and go to the next thing. 
---
heaven forbid a fan of a franchise and developer want that franchise/developer to be good...  sure we can move on but it's not too much to ask for a developer we like to create an entry worthy of the franchise
---
So whilst doing all this server hopping and workshop farming, you're also gathering all the flux and what not necessary for the ultracite ammo? All within 30 days? It's very nicely laid out plan, and I'm sure it works well, but not to the tune of 600,000 ammo. I mean he'd have to be doing this every. Single. Day. All. Day. Not even playing the game, just doing this routine. Or maybe, just maybe, it's easier to dupe the materials or even just the ammo then claim you didn't on Reddit.
---
As I can see your incapable of being able to read ya fuck head

---
Haha I saw his post, he had a great guide and did things very similar to what I did. Too bad he got banned 
---
Are you loving the attention? Very lonely OP...?
---
I agree with you on the wanted thing.  Since workshops are a PvP zone, that mechanic shouldn't even be in play.
---
Cool story brah.
---
Sorry to busy being an adult and working to care about that lol! Just provides more proof to what I said 😘
---
I’m PS4 throwing my name out 
---
Sure, you can dupe multiple things- so why didn't they dupe anything of value BEFORE they duped ammo, the one thing all players have been complaining about since day one, since we can't sell it or break it down?
---
That's where common sense comes in, quite literally it would make sense for them to dupe anything that can be sold to vendors or other players that isn't easy to craft or find.
---
Is it realistic for a player to have more than a few Mr fuzzy outfits? How about thousands of nukacolas? Or serum recipes, the most rare drop from the sbq.. couldn't they just look for high value things like this that dupers have flooded the market with?
---
See, that would make sense. Players haven't ruined the economy with ultracite ammo or normal ammo, but they have ruined it with serum recipes or by duping nukacola to create caps out of thin air, making caps even more worthless than they naturally are.
---
But no, you've got people witch hunting people that got banned over ammo, not the ones that duped hundreds or thousands of weapons and armor and other things that the rest of us grind for daily.
---
Well, whoever is left playing at least, which is even less because of bans. This game is pretty well fucked, but it has more to do with Bethesda not employing common sense, and they players who are left over also not using common sense and attacking each other.
---
Oh, I am very amused.
---
Anything else you wanted to add?
---
I'll call your bluff.  Point out one of these "innocents" whose history you found interesting.
---
Yeah I can only hear people in the ps party likw that works fine its just the in game mic doesnt work
---
Oh man.... if that's the case, I should probably log on and see if I'm in trouble. I started out grabbing LITERALLY everything I found, dropping it in containers or my handy paper lunch bag, changing my mind and picking it back up (you know, just in case)... I haven't been on in well over a month.
---
Go figure......lol
---
It’s that easy?   Wish I were near my PS4.  Thanks for setting up one if my kids with his first mutations.   
---
Since today? 
---
They should drop springs, screws, and ballistic fiber. Lol
---
Well I wouldn't say all that.
---
This is based on the idea that the email is real and accurate, and that Bethesda didn't double count ammo; for example, trading ammo back and forth between mule accounts, or trading it amongst other players. The email suggests that the amounts written were *handled* by the accounts, though it isn't confirmed outright that double counting the same ammo is a possibility. These are still unknown factors.
---
With the change now to grenade launchers I feel like I need a chart for what weapons are effected by what perks.
---
Fallout 4 is still full price but new Vegas isn't that much and goes on sale quite often 
---
Push to talk have been in the game for a while now.
---
You realize no matter what time they do server maintenance someone is gonna bitch?
---
Retention is the magic word for any and all ISPs.
---
TBH i dont really care if it ever drops for me..if it does..cool..but u can obtain almost anything from the market subs..i farm WS for the XP..i dont really care for the drops at all
---
I'm Level 140-something and I've started just leaving when they show up.  Not worth it.
---
There is no given function for trading between multiple different characters. So any effort in mule trading is not going to sway my opinion on if what was done is legit. 
---
If all he did was trade ammo with mules, yea it would have been heavy handed.  But just from post history, not even inventory records, it is obvious many many rules were tested.
---
Thanks I had done this about 4 times just made me not sure if I was doing it right 
---
it's just that specific server beeing shut down for some reason it happens but it's rare
---
Lol seriously? Having fun and ending it so soon? You're TOTALLY having fun. Anywho, nothing else to add, see you on your next post.
---
Ive been playing a few weeks and never have been disconnected... and today i got disconnected 3 times within half an hour... it was torture but i powered through and 4th time lucky
---
Its "only"  been 4 months
---
Wasn't this announced yesterday? 
---
My explosive shotgun just went from 200% repair to broken in literally 3 shots lol
---
They broke low-health builds. 
---
Get them on Steam for cheap (unless you are console) make sure you grab game of the year editions they come with all the DLC
---
I don't possess a mule account. I have 1 account with 5 characters level 50+.
---
On-the-fly server maintenance has already been the case though.  When I've seen it, I was given 5 minutes to finish up.
---
Nobody should ever try anything new? God forbid they take a chance and add multiplayer and pvp, generally really great things in any game for its longevity. Competition keeps people going, and PvP is fun, honourable or not. What all you casual sensitives are calling "griefing" is commonplace in other titles.
---
With the new patch this will be happening significantly more often
---
My post from the market? trading for items is different from duping them. Though with how cheap they are they were probably duped. Does that count as aiding a duper?
---
People lie about this game? 
---
Have you even played Fallout 76 you seem like the type to crap on a game because you've seen YouTube videos saying how bad the game is.  People act like this is the worst game ever made just because "My favorite YouTuber said it was badso it must be".  So sick of people complaining about a game that they heard was bad but haven't even given it a shot.
---
So you have no sophisticated answer. 
---
You must be very new to gaming. Mules are used since many years and in numerous games ... 
---
This subreddit is toxic :/ Alot of players are being accused and wrongfully banned. I get that there's a lot of hate for cheaters but that doesn't mean people should be accused of cheating. And yes I was a guy that came across a bag full of goodies.
---
Not home to test it myself but I did remote into my home computer and noticed that half the Mothman stuff doesn't show up for me as well. It's listed, but the actual place where it's supposed to show what it is shows a blank window.
---
lol, fucking cheater. You got what you deserved.
---
Man! You got a stimpack, you lucky dog, you!
---
As an herbivore, all I ever seem to get is brains and livers.
---
Any news on the missing armor plans like BoS and certain deep pocketed? 
---
the skin is because you have mods. update your custom ini.
---
the addiction is real
---
I know, the thought of spending money on a game where they ban legit players is pretty laughable, glad we can agree 
---
What I'd give for some lacy panties with a matching bra.
---
I am level 192.  Donr waste your time fighting them.  Just hit white springs. 
---
Yes but we are not sure if Mules really increase “acquired” or what causes the “acquired” flag.  If the employees who scour the forms already investigated it directly from this thread I’m inclined to believe that the source of “acquired” is not as easily manipulated as we believe.   Also most duped previously took 2 toons I believe.   I believed OP until Bethesda looked into it and upheld the ban, now I’m curious to learn more details from OP so we know better how to question Bethesda.    
---
Its was my build first ill prove i have screenshots with date. Dont steel credit for one. Also wen you copy some builds, do it right next time and use a shitgun, much better fir any killing
---
Nah, the exploiting duping cheating pricks should feel embarrassed and yet, they don't, like the spineless lying cowards they are.However, you, not even owning FO76...
---
Big surprise 😂
---
You provided no rebuttal for your first post. Simply went to name calling. Let's not make this personal, your first post was just whiny, and I decided to reply. After all, I dont spend my time on subreddits that I tell everyone i hate. 
---
Definitely this! I've rebuilt my CAMP like ten times just because I wanted to move a conduit or make a new power connection in my mansion.
---
hows the new not wanted when shooting a building work? does it mean someone can hit all my stuff to be one shot to mobs without getting wanted?
---
I’ve always loved that era of music, once I found Fallout I was instantly hooked on the radio. It adds so much to atmosphere. Hearing Skeeter Davis’ “End Of The World” while mauling down ghouls in Park Street Station in Fallout4 solidified my love for the series 
---
My friends quit because the game sucks. Not because they cheated like yours..
---
Ps- I quit too cause this “game” is a friggen mess..
---
totally agree OP, when I read that, I just smh .. they care completely clueless. What they should of said, is when there is 1 person or no people on the server, then put it into maintenance mode or maybe give people an hour notice vs the traditional 5 minutes.
---
Had this issue thru beta and as soon as the first update worked fine but blue screen got worse then after next one suddenly everything works fine..I have no clue how or why it just started working I play every day and have not had hardly any disconnect problem ...now I am paranoid waiting for next  bug to hit me. 
---
::paws ground and charges::
---
That's crazy, I guess the only other point not addressed... Do you or more specifically have you duped in the past?
---
Did you get the email specifying what your infractions were? I've seen other sask for it and get it, maybe you should do that.
---
Looks like now it’s semi fixed. I could assign variants of the same weapon to the dial and it works after i logged back in. However the names of the weapons are messed up. I just need to remember which one is which. 
---
Guy was confirmed a cheater today lol. Over 100000 ultracite ammo duped
---
Relavent: "why you heff to be mad" https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A
---
I find it funny that so many people seem to think that only guilty people get upset when they are banned.  If they make a complaint at all they are auto guilty.  Any of these "legit" players were banned unjustly you'd be going on a tantrum.  
---
"Eat lead, punk!"
---
They would have to destroy a complete wall to become wanted, 1 or 2 bullets will not put them in wanted status.
---
Yeah with my All Rise before the patch I was doing 400+ damage when looking at itin the pip boy. It's down to 303 now.  Did they cut damage output or something? 
---
Okay. So if I buy a ticket for a football game (UK) for £50 for two hours entertainment and they play rubbish and lose, if I buy a cinema ticket for £20 and the film is rubbish. You can buy anything nowadays for £100's and it can be rubbish. I paid £23 and if I play 100 hours it's 23 pence an hour. Your point whilst valid, is open to debate as most games are now patched after release. The fact is that half the people moaning are those who have tried unsuccessfully to cheat the system.
---
Yep.  I lost faith in New Content with Patch 5.
---
So far Patch 6 isn't a disappointment, it's a confirmation of my lost faith from Patch 5 :)
---
Meanwhile my friends list is empty.   They're BORED.  Playing something else until SUBSTANTIAL New Content drops.
---
I remember when they confirmed Player Vending would be a thing.  It was one of the FIRST things they ever confirmed for new content.  So far 0 news on when it's coming in. 
---
At Whitesprings there are several cobalt flux outside of the enclave on the hill by the resort.   There are several by the road to the east and north of the first ones.  There are several more to the north on back side of the apartment buildings in side the fenced in area.  There are 2-3 more south of that inside of White Springs proper.  there are 2-3 more north of the north east wall by the super mutant camp.  There is one on the east side of the road right by the road and by some cars.    With Green Thumb, I get well over 40 blue cobalt at White Springs on a single pass.  If I make my run a sufficiently big enough circle, I can keep collecting as I go.  Some flux gets bugged out sometimes, but sometimes it unglitches on the next pass.   There are a few violet flux, but I'll let you find them.  
---
you also literally admitted to duping. 
---
PS4. I've been hoping to get more people doing it so there can be a 24-hour rp world going, but because its on ps4 that's hard to do, hahaha. Even still, it's been really fun. 
---
Well, taking your 1000 rounds of ultracite in 2 hours and layering that with his 900 hours of gameplay means he could technically craft 450,000 rounds in 900 hours.
---
So....
---
You are a god among men. Thank you.
---
OMG that guy is digging a bigger hole for himself - macros to trick the game engine into giving you more ore from a single node?  That's an exploit right there.  He's going to get himself perma banned soon.
---
Thank you very much for the clarification and detail on this, much appreciated!
---
Delusion is the best of all possible systems :)
---
Totally agreed. No one knows the actual mechanics of the system Beth is using. 
---
Do we know that anyone’s actually “upheld the ban” after looking at it? The email with the ammo amounts is apparently part of the automated process and I haven’t seen any response from Beth other than the two automated emails that we’ve seen screenshots of.
---
damn, so someone can just hit all my crap to low health
---
&gt; you're right, i hadnt considered heavy trading either. if they are in fact counting this way, that would explain it. but the counter argument to that would be why didnt 900 guy cite his trading as a possible source of the "mistake?"
---
Because when he made the OP he nor anyone else knew why he was banned and didn't know it was due to he went over 100k ammo.
---
&gt;while Bethesda's actions and wording would suggest that the ammo is registered in this way, we dont know that for a fact. It definitely would explain the significant amount of "false positives" (assuming that these are real). that being said, it still doesnt make sense that they would go with this flawed metric and assert that their ruling is infallible. i mean, they have to know that it is or isnt counting those traded rounds. logically, i dont see how they could see total handled, including trades, being an option. like you said, trading that much for someone who is an avid trader is definitely possible. would be a ridiculous mistake.
---
Bethesda has been making "ridiculous mistake" after ridiculous mistake with FO76, I mean they had movement speed tied to the clients Frames per second. They still have the "sweet spot" for locks stored client side, the whole bag gate was another one of these ridiculous mistakes, and with bag gate they first started off saying that their ruling was infalliable on that as well claiming that they weren't going to give out the bags they advertised because "the materials are too expensive".
---
If it were any other game that didn't have this reoccurring issue of screw up after screw up on bethesdas end I'd say the dude was a duper as well. But the fact that bethesda has dropped the ball over and over makes me much more likely to believe that they dropped the ball on this as well.
---
You are right we don't know about what this guy did or didn't do, but the numbers aren't that out of the question for someone who has over 900 hours played with a level 400+ character when you look into how the numbers are being pulled.
---
Say he has 36k ammo and he moves it to his mule because he doesn't plan on using it then after the TSE nerf he decides well time to try out using this different gun I have 36k ammo for. By him creating the ammo, that counts as 36k, then by moving it to the mule, that is ANOTHER 36k added to the list, then say he moves it back, that is ANOTHER 36k added to the list. So in just the action of muling it off and then back just once turned 36k ammo into over 100k ammo by bethesdas count.
---
As for it being suspicious for him to mule that ammo back and forth repeatedly, Why? When I played diablo 2 I had accounts full of mules and I would move stuff around on them all the time. I don't see how muling things is suspicious at all. Likewise so what if he moved the ammo back and forth a bunch of times over a 30 day period. That isn't against any rules on the TOS and most people who play online games wouldn't even think twice about muling back and forth. 
---
It just seems ridiculous to jump to "OH YOU'RE A CHEATER" just because someone mules stuff and moves their items around a lot because it is insanely common in pretty much every single other online game especially those with a trading economy. 
---
Everybody Respec so you can play for the next two weeks then change it again!
---
I turned in an actual Ticket and not just Feedback about this since it still isn't mentioned.  Ladydevann had replied to someone else's post about this quest a few weeks back and I was hopeful it was going to be addressed.  Lesson learned, don't have hope, lol.
---
Queen of the Hunt is in the same boat for me.  Just stopped showing up.  Was sometime in early/mid December the last time I saw either of these 'high level' repeatable quests.
---
Bethesda, please fix these...pretty please?
---
Good point .. 
---
affected by the bug.
---
Did i have radworms before the patch? No.
---
Mutations:
---
Adrenal reaction
---
Bird bones
---
Eagle eyes
---
Electrically charged
---
Scaly skin
---
Speed demon
---
Adrenal Reaction is not working ,i think. My damage is also too low and i have an UNY set/radicool build
---
Infinite loot loading is still a thing I see 
---
or plastic and oil... 👳‍♂️
---
&gt;• Dev Note: We’ve been reading your feedback that the current stash limit of 600 lbs could use an additional increase, and after some investigation found that we could offer some more storage space in the Stash.
---
LOL 
---
"hey guys, are there any numbers larger than 600?"
---
"BRB, let me investigate...." 
---
I’ve seen them at level 90+ lately, it seems like if you’re the first there, they show up regardless of your level, but they don’t spawn as often as the non-golfer ghouls. 
---
My character has started worshiping the scorch beasts, and is trying to communicate with the scorched. 
---
Naturally, this results in him getting beat up quite a bit, lol
---
this is the truth..after the TSE nerf patch..i was salt..i took a break for maybe a few days..then i was back running around the forest crafting my healing salves and disease cures..making trades with redditors for rare outfits..like nothing ever happened
---
He had two accounts banned, with a combined total of 365K ultracite ammo, plus and additional 280K normal ammo). He could not get that much flux, hardened masses, glowing masses, high radiation fluids, lead, and acid through normal play. No way, no how. He either duped it himself, bought duped ingredients, or bought duped ammo.
---
There is no given function for trading between multiple different characters? There is literally a trade function when you look at someone...
---
Hey!  If you're on PS4 I can mod it for you for free.  I'm on now.
---
I spent most of yesterday looking through each and every ban post made yesterday. one I did not see with multiple H: multiple 3* legendaries w: caps, was the one with the pic of the female twitch streamer. However that post history was very odd as well. But I did not see evidence enough in that 1 case.
---
There were well over 20 with buy sell posts damming them, easy to find.
---
600 level guy has built himself a case, but there are many questionable posts there. 
---
Every one of them were obviously breaking the spirit of the game.  
---
That is 9 hours and 15 minutes a day EVERY DAY since launch. 
---
Dude has been playing this like a full time job. 900 hours at $8/hr is $7,200... 
---
And if you were to ask as CS rep, they would all want that in their retention dept. I HATED those calls.
---
Hope you aren't running a bloodied/low health build. 
---
Not your own creations
---
yup, you are right, anything can be rubbish, it's just more disappointing when it's a publisher that you love and usually does right by it's community...
---
My life is good, don't know why you'd assume I have a problem. I just love causing pvp situations. Consensual or not. You softies call anything "griefing" and in another game like the Souls series you would all cry like bitches at the real shit. Fallout is a wasteland, and I am a raider. I will TAKE your shit. So pardon me if my 2mm EC rounds do the "polite talking and holding hands frolicking through the wasteland" for me.
---
No idea how u fixed it im guessing?
---
Couldn't be. How does Reddit connect to Bethesda.net? I think that's the number of people browsing this sub right now.
---
Nah, still broken, along with some other new stuff. 
---
See we don't really feel like you actually are looking to improve them, they have been this bad from the start of the beta. You've had numerous patches and hotfixes where you could have modified this. Instead you seem to ignore it . Excuse me for saying this but I find this answer to be utter bullshit.
---
that chest piece looks ok tho
---
Its not real. Just someone hoping for karma
---
Do you write to film directors asking for a remake if their film is "shit"? No don't answer that.
---
Yes they are, if you have multiple accounts you can easily trade with yourself using that exact function.
---
Still stand by what I said. You can go eat your own fruit loops kid
---
That's a good point. I'm curious then why weapons and armor were manually scrappable but wouldn't be used in crafting previously - clearly there was SOME way to make sure items weren't scrapped while crafting, but it was only applied to weapons/armor and not mods or non-autoscrap junk. I guess mods may have had some sort of "junk" tag on them that weapons/armor didn't. 
---
I'm kind of amazed that this hasn't been fixed yet to be honest. Every change in the scrapping system fucks something else up somewhere else in the system, it's getting ridiculous. 
---
Mics are the best. Any game with proximity mics instead of shout-it-to-the-whole-game mics can be roleplayed in, but yes, I agree, some sort of text chat would be great for console games. they need to start selling little keyboards with consoles, or letting us use our phones as keyboards.
---
I think they only hold 10 each? But I also don't think they produce that much an hour.. in either case I don't think it's worth the effort to maximize production unless you're really focused on something that needs whatever your getting. Makes more sense to just go there when it's convenient, you're in between doing things and can blow 2 minutes to fast travel there for free and quickly collect what you need.
---
Personally I just grab workshops because you'll simply get more for little to no effort than you would have otherwise.. which seems more important if you've got little time you can invest, since it requires even less time invested to capture it.
---
Hell yeah, no reason to be pissed if we get e free emote , omg cant wait 👍
---
Are they immediate for you?
---
I've had them show up in random locations like 30-60 minutes later. I thought that was normal, and one of the reasons I stopped bothering with them.
---
Thank you very much kind stranger on the internet! I did your workaround and straight away I was able to progress! So many stimpacks, ammo and consumables were taken and hours of my life! I can finally progress the MoM questline! 
---
Yep. I had 25k Ultracite 50cal at one time. No clue how long it took, but between:
---
* running circles around nuked Prime with Green Thumb
---
* mining lead ore at Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator PA
---
* farming Whitespring, Big Bend Tunnel, Blackwater Mine, Grafton Steel Yard, etc. for iron ore, and weapons/armor to scrap (with Scrapper) for steel
---
* crafting with Ammosmith and Super Duper
---
… 100k in 30 days probably wouldn't be difficult. Especially if you use mutations, thoughtful weapon and armor selection, and smart perk loadout strategy to move and kill efficiently.
---
It was my understanding after PMing his ticket number to the Bethesda employee who was asking for it, he got the follow up email.    Which yes is generic but when you are traditionally rejecting an appeal you send the next official rejection template.  Mind you my experience comes from government contracts but I imagine it is the same.  The time stamp on the two emails and the claim others make of not having an itemized breakdown that the second email was sent in response to the first.    Either way Bethesda has looked into it for him and he is not unbanned yet, so there are more variables we need defined although I believe we already were in agreement in most of this. 
---
Maybe they're legitimately in complete and utter disbelief that someone would dump 900 hours into a game that few people seem to like, and take the way more believable approach that you must be cheating.  Just my 2 cents.
---
No, he had 2 accounts banned that had 365k ultracite ammo go through their inventories. Read the email again. It doesn't say he currently has that many on his characters.
---
The last guide he wrote up I thought he said because he "couldn't log in" or some such.  But I could be wrong. I just read another post about the fishy timing of his posts. I'll link it if I can find it.
---
I've also submitted a ticket, and mentioned it here with every patch. I've even had the community managers for Bethesda here in the sub ask for my info, to which I supplied the ticket for it. 
---
I just want to be able to do my BoS Daily...but until they fix this quest, I can't.
---
If they introduce a forced quest reset on active Daily quests at a certain time during the day, the issue should be resolved.
---
I thought they were well known for buggy games?
---
A lvl 10 character is not going to survive long enough to see them lol.
---
I have pretty much given up on this one for the mules; at least I managed to do it in two of my mains :)
---
The offer still stands if you change your mind.
---
A couple years ago, a redditor utilized that symbol to mean a 'cuil' which is an abstraction away from the original idea. It gets more intense as you ramp up the cuils. Here is a video of the famous post.

---
Level 80 Scorchbeasts have a chance to drop a prime receiver, so they may still be worth fighting, but don't waste your time with level 50's
---
There isn't a solution that doesn't have some downside.  Their judgement, I'm sure, is that preventing accidental Wanteds, at the cost of a really methodical griefer taking everything down to low HP, was an acceptable tradeoff.
---
I'll admit in the beginning I used XP exploits but I never ever duped an item. Their email claims that I duped 100,000 items within a 30 day period. I haven't been active in the game in almost 3 weeks, my only login was to check to see if any of my items were affected by the dupe item removal, which they weren't. 
---
didn't work.
---
I did the glitch for inf stash back when it was working, that’s the only glitch I’ve done in this game (so far)
---
I think it might be a problem with adrenal reaction.
---
What Mothman skin??
---
Ya.  Scorchbeasts are garbage for loot.  You'd think they'd at least drop 1* legendaries or plans or something.  But you rarely even get a single ultracite.
---
They really need to rethink the Scorchbeast drop tables.  Deathclaws, Grafton Monsters, Wendigos, etc all drop shit worth much more and take very little effort.
---
For something that is supposedly just a step below the ultimate enemy of the game (Their Queen...) you'd think you'd walk away with more than you put into the kill.
---
Two days ago I got ambushed by two of them leaving the Camp Venture building after handing in Tech Data.  Decided to kill them.  700 or so 5.56 down the drain and I think I had a liver and a heart?  Don't recall any wings, and not even a stimpack.  Some regular garbage armor that was scrapped right away.
---
Tell your friend I had a lovely time playing last night on my unbanned account. I farmed some legendaries, got two new plans from a Queen fight, helped some lowbies take down probably their first scorchbeast and showed them some neat areas off the beaten path.
---
What is this bug/issue? It could be Bethesda don't have enough information to replicate it and find the cause of it. 
---
I think this bug is tied to perks. I don't use perks and stealth works normally. 
---
I crouch, I'm \[HIDDEN\]. I kill a mutant hound (with sneak bonus) in one shot 10m away, the super mutant next to it goes into \[CAUTION\]. I stay hidden in cover long enough and mutant gives up and I go back into \[HIDDEN\], I shoot the mutant (sneak bonus) and I go into \[CAUTION\], I shoot again (sneak bonus), and again (sneak bonus) and then it goes into \[DANGER\] and all the buddies come and hunt me. I kill everything, combat music stops, crouch and I'm \[HIDDEN\].
---
Enemies seem slightly more aware but stealth works as it should without perks. What perks are people using, what is the expected behaviour and how is it breaking. Does removing certain perks fix the issue (to help find the perk causing the issue).
---
&gt; a game where they ban legit players
---
lulz
---
I think it's an age thing. As you get older you realise most things are "average to bad" and are more accepting and move on.
---
So this duper DUPED bunch of horny FO76 players by inserting a female headshot? Ok, that dude needs his account reinstated just for his strategic effort.
---
because so far they haven't. every single person who has cried here about being banned, and totally never did anything wrong, has been outed as a duper through their fucking post history.
---
even the 900 hour guy got outed. 
---
nope. I run a full bloodied build and it's busted right now.
---
This seems like way too big of a headache to start playing this game. 
---
If they can’t provide the product you want, why do you like them?
---
Also there is a line between feedback/criticism and demanding/abuse.  
---
In a broader sense I think the owner of the property or franchise has the right to do what they want with it, creatively or otherwise.  We can ask for something, but when it comes down to it developers don’t owe us anything.
---
Bethesda has every right to ban anyone. If they believe he is breaking the spirit of the rules, which it seems they do, then they can do so.  
---
How so?
---
I am behind you limb. I am tired of Bethesda’s bullshit. Every update they fuck it up 
---
The futurama example really seals it for me that this should be a real in-game effect.  A disease that helps you instead of hurts you is interesting, it already has a built-in time limit so it can't be exploited much.
---
This along with the old "Feed the People" that feed all the people are bugs that are just too much fun for someone to purposefully make, but when you find one, you should embrace it!
---
This is an exploit stop giving out codes.
---
Please, don't be so needy.
---
See you around, friend!
---
I collect all flavors beyond the regular.  
---
I have 100 odd cherries and 80 odd quantum’s.  
---
Only 2 grapes thus far.  
---
so you are saying fans aren't allowed to be disappointed with a product?
---
Same problem here! Adrenal reaction mutation doesn't work anymore
---
Why does your company suck so much ass?
---
The overseer one is annoying.
---
Bird bones also helps a lot with this, I don't powerslam on every jump in PA anymore.
---
That's legit.
---
The amount of ammo is an odd thing. I’ve probably gone through about 100k rounds of .50 Cal ammo in the last 60 days, but a large amount of that is in the last 30, and I find that I’m crafting more and more every day, as my play time increases and the amount of rounds I use goes up, plus a couple more people I play with are also using .50 cal guns now as well, and they’re not fully specced into Super Duper 3 / Ammosmith 2 yet, so I’m making these rounds for 3 people, all for legit use. 
---
However, reading the email from “900 hours guy” and the explanation for his suspension, it appears they’re going to do more of these item purges/ dupe fixes, and his account will one day be eligible for reinstatement, so long term I’m not too worried, and I’d say a lot of people also in the same situation as me probably shouldn’t worry, either. Keep enjoying that .50 Cal, keep making that ammo. 
---
I purchased Fallout 4 Saturday at GameStop used for 9.99.  Before I was even suspended. Playing Fallout 4 after playing 76 showed me how much work they didn’t put into 76.  Give it a try DBill
---
Gonna be a loooooot of unhappy people...
---
yeah, but this game is buggier than the buggiest game ever released
---
How fitting that it is now Mothman Week! Amazing! Can't wait to get home and buy the power armor paint! And maybe a few other items. 
---
Did you get Scorched Earth event loot?  Its different than looting the queens corpse.
---
Oh god...
---
Any chance you turned off the tracking in your Data menu?   My friends and I do all the time cause they show up for other people’s supply drops.  
---
Because I am allowed to hope for the future although it will never come. 
---
Oh....
---
What did they break now? 
---
No it doesn't, the issue is bethesda is only counting items being added into your inventory, so say you have 25k ammo and you mule it to a mule, now both the mule and your main account has 25k ammo in 30 day period in their inventory. Now say you mule that 25k ammo back to your main, your main now shows 50k ammo over 30 days, and mule 25k, so with just a single mule transfer over and back 25k ammo turns into 75k even though you never have anywhere close to that.
---
PC my man but thanks!
---
Secondary accounts in a game with a weight limit.  When you play alot and collect cool weapons you want to keep but can't because of weight. Idk why they makes you auto sketchy.  Tons of players do it.  They have. System to make. Second character built in.  
---
You never played Jet Set Willy then!
---
Ok so no further explanation of the issues I brought up in my first reply? That's fine. This subreddit is for fallout 76, not thinking you're cool because you almost might maybe donate a game you bought, yet you still spend time on the subreddit dedicated to that very game. Just to be clear, I'm more of a fruity pebbles kind of guy.
---
Lol I hadn’t thought of it that way, but I guess it’s true.  
---
The abundance of “average to bad” turns into background noise and makes the good products stand out all the more.
---
Wait what? 
---
That is incredibly true, unless you get some help.
---
Clean Underwear will now be sold in the Atomic Shop.  Only $25, we're practically giving it away!
---
i would love to buy an apartment in white spring. that must be cool! but building ya own village was a dream when ive started the game. *plop* another dream broken!
---
Well i do. And they messed up big time... the adrenal reaction mutation is not working anymore...
---
I mean, this patch has some good changes. But they are minor. And especially far to late. 
---
If they keep making progress with that speed, the first real content addition hits past borderlands 3 release.
---
No they didn't, read the emails they sent. The email states they had 100k of something go through their inventory over a 30 day period. Not that they currently had that much at one time or even at any time. 
---
The issue is bethesda is counting things multiple times if you mule it or drop it to make room in your inventory and then pick it back up.
---
Yup not a clue it just stopped
---
Whats happened with stims ?
---
My life is complete. Kill me now.
---
If one assumed that was literally the only thing he was doing for that entire time, maybe. But then we need to account for all of the hundreds of thousands of other items he was banned for. 
---
Again you are misunderstanding the 30 days... It doesn't say that last 30 days. A 30 day period could be December 15th through January 15th...
---
And it doesn't say YOU duped them, it says you've acquired over a 30-day period... meaning if you transferred ammo (I've seen ultrasite ammo referenced) between accounts maybe 10,000 ammo transferred 10 times within ANY 30 day period you got flagged.
---
HOW DID I FORGET ABOUT CUIL‽ 
---
Wow that’s a blast from the past. Thanks for the memories!
---
I'm not OP. And having to prove your point by playing junior investigator doesn't give much goodwill to yourself.  Unless you want me to also take the time to do the same to you.
---
Same but i transfed to fatman build 
---
Sweet i can finnaly stash the rest of my junk. 
---
no u
---
It zooms in on the back of the gun with me.
---
I still have hope but our goal in this game was rebuild society wasnt it? But we cant build citys...
---
BROKEN!!! Noooooooooo!!!!!
---
Sadly Adrenal Reaction is only debuffing hp and not buffing damage which is TerraBad
---
Well thanks for the input man hope mum is the same one day but wouod really lile to get this fixed asap as i am lvl 153 and am missing out on a big chunk of the game
---
Is there a vendor you can buy T51 plans at?
---
I didn't say that. Have you read some of the comments on here today? They're unbelievable.
---
It is 900 hours and it wasn't a half million, it was 160k.
---
Not to mention you are misunderstanding what is going on. Bethesda is counting ammo multiple times if you mule it off and back onto your character.
---
this is their way of saying "play melee as Todd "the God" Howard intended you blasphemers"
---
So, I just removed all my mods, and the problem still exists :) pssst
---
shop items are bugged.
---
is that Blackbird? because I'd murder your entire family to have it back in the shop
---
I give you a racoon.
---
No its not that. I was asking about the one players could only get from the dev room
---
Yeah totally
---
Now I’ve got it from your other comments - that griefing guy was wearing that kind of armor thinking he was invincible and you did critical attacks which actually ignore those armor perks, right?
---
Indeed. Didn’t realise how heavily dependant on that mutation I was. I like running around with low health to benefit from that mutation so it has obliterated every single weapon damage I have. May as well play with full health again till they fix it. 
---
Dude you get it. There's not a snowball's chance in hell that this game was thoroughly tested and polished before its release. If that isn't a reason to complain then I don't know what is. 
---
&gt; If they can’t provide the product you want, why do you like them? 
---
are you fucking dumb?  is this their first product?  maybe literally every other product they released I liked, in fact, maybe I like this one too, and it is because I like it that I want to see it be good and succeed...
---
&gt; Also there is a line between feedback/criticism and demanding/abuse 
---
are you suggesting I am being demanding or abusive?
---
&gt;In  a broader sense I think the owner of the property or franchise has the  right to do what they want with it, creatively or otherwise.  We can ask  for something, but when it comes down to it developers don’t owe us  anything.
---
they sure can, and yes, they at the very least owe us working game for $60, or just keep it in BETA until it's fixed, just yesterday I helped kill a SBQ and she fell through the map before anyone could loot her, had I been the one to launch the nuke I would've been even madder than I was, hours of his/her hard work down the drain...
---
Already awesome, I’ve heard great things, will try it out! 
---
remove or update your custom ini.
---
No idea why you got downvoted for this, because yeah that makes perfect sense to me. I'm a lone wanderer but was just thinking that'd be a fine use of teamwork.
---
Ohh very nice, thanks for the tip 
---
You think that one of the few end game challenges having the answer posted sounds like working as intended?  If so I am sure that there are some people that would be happy to give you 100,000 Quantums for free.....if they weren't Banned now.
---
And again you're misunderstanding. I never possessed, picked up, traded, whatever that amount of ammo or anything close at any time, on any character PERIOD.
---
Yeah, I left the ultracite out - it's reasonably easier to acquire he'd only need 2,033 in a month. That's 67 a day.  
---
It takes some dedication though.
---
Looks fine to me. Unless you are telling me your dad wasn't Bio-luminescent and your mom wasn't a fucking neon light-bulb....
---
 Is it intended? like two-shots?
---
Got it man 
---
Oh man, thought this was just me! Always with the campfire!
---
Last night, I had just looted the queen and she disappeared for everyone else. 
---
Did not work for me either. Neither did reapply adrenal reaction serum (starched genes disabled, mutation gained when serum was taken but without positive effect).
---
Shop items are not bugged
---
Modded games are bugged. There's plenty of posts already on how to fix it.
---
Wait so does this mean if I want to take over someone’s workshop I can just pic the most obscure and random part of the build area to do so? What are the point of the defenses then? 
---
Right? We shall give it a small break my dude 
---
I'm sure he also has an amazing bridge for sale, just 50k nuka-colas.
---
No, they said they banned him for having too much ammo. Nowhere in any of the rules does it state that having too much ammo or too much of any type of item is bannable or even against the rules.
---
The game is literally about scavenging and hoarding items, which is what the dude did and got banned for it. So no he wasn't breaking any rules or even the spirit of any rules, he was just playing the game TOO well.
---
yeah, they are, on both sides, you are allowed to like something that is broken and want it to be better, what's shitty is a bunch of people pretending there is nothing wrong with this game and sucking Bethesda's dick...
---
Hot pink is the new black.
---
Honestly I dont care enough to go back see what "your" problems with my post. Don't blame you there they are pretty tasty. I just troll. I'm stuck with it seeing it's a digital copy. But thanks for the report for the fact your a fuck head. I'm it hurt you because that's what your parents call you in disappointment because all you do is finger your corn hole and play fALlOUt 7b
---
10 hours per day tho? I've had to take a few months off for illness before and I still didn't have the time to do something like that on a regular basis. A lot of my time was spent rehabilitating actually. 
---
What mods are they using? At least on consoles this game looks like shit. 
---
Finally!   Hot pink power armor.  
---
Have had rad worms, but they were cured.
---
Current mutations are:
---
Adrenal reaction, bird bones, eagle eyes, electrically charged, grounded, healing factor, herbivore, herd mentality, marsupial, plague walker, scaly skin, speed demon, talons, twisted muscles, and unstable isotope.
---
marsupial flex
---
oh, sorry. my mistake. I gathered that from a post I saw right after the servers came back.
---
This is the odd contradiction I run into with New Vegas fans.  It's like they only feel role playing "counts" if they can see every decision they make reflected back at them, explicitly acknowledged by the game.
---
But the vast majority of decisions we make on a day-to-day basis only make sense to us and have no lasting consequences.  By emphasizing so many "epic' choices, it makes the whole thing feel phony and contrived to me.  The world seems exist just for me and my input.
---
I hope you get it figured out.
---
So it should be trivial for you to point out one, right?
---
*Scortchbeast - we realized we made a really shitty, annoying monster that no one likes, and we're working on it. Here's the 5th nerd to its sonic attack, hopefully you will use the extra. 5 seconds between non stop sonic attacks we added to thank us for taking your feedback into consideration and making the necessary changes to improve life in Appalachia. Loot will still be the highly sought after "vented ultracite" mod. 
---
GFY. 
---
Sincerely, 
---
Bethesda 
---
I have looted one on a queen few days ago. That was the first TSE ever looted for me in 600 hours.
---
I believe you are correct about most people who are moaning. I don't agree with the comparison to football games and movies.
---
Lmao
---
Am I being demanding and abusive? Yes mate you are. Not $60. How many hours playtime for that?
---
Why would you be buying to make that much ammo. That is far more ammo then even the most prudent person would ever need.  Hell I don't even think I've used 400,000 rounds of ammo total since I got the game. 
---
thank you!  and when they announced a BETA I was like "good!"  then they announced it was only to test the servers and I was like "really?  you aren't going to run the BETA longer and test for bugs or balance issues?"  I mean, it's not like they couldn't have tested the servers and *then* had a week or two of general testing...
---
No it's not. Until they change the weights of items that you HAVE TO carry, you're always going to need the power armor. 3 rifles weighing over 60 pounds is not ok 
---
I think that if your character has been on a run where you killed the SBQ, that should affect the other Scorchbeasts in some way.  It doesn't really make sense to kill their queen and have them be exactly the same.  The problem is how to do that while being a multiplayer game, though.
---
Imagine if one of these effects (I don't know, pick your favorite) lasted for a week:
---
1. No more Scorchbeasts since the SBQ is dead.
---
2. You still have Scorchbeasts but they're weakened and confused.  Easy prey.
---
3. The remaining Scorchbeasts are fewer but they're twice as powerful.  They are enraged at the death of their queen and fighting for survival of the hive.
---
4. They're the same as ever, but you could much better loot for killing them than you normally would, as a reward for your role in killing the SBQ.
---
Options 1 through 3 make the most sense, but it doesn't work when you share a map with other players.  Option 4 would make it more worthwhile to take the SBQ down IMO.
---
Posting nuke codes like this are not as intended by Bethesda. This type of practice should be reported to Bethesda immediately as an exploit to the system. Bypassing the need to collect Nuke Codes all together or accessing them via a decryption website is a full on exploit. Anyone who has launched a nuke without collected all of the nuke codes for that silo should be examined and banned until they can fix the nuke code system from being using incorrectly.
---
...Did you go into the dev room to get it, or purchase it from someone who did?   
---
Seriously folks, this shit isn't that complicated. Just don't cheat. It's a video game, not something that's actually difficult. 
---
Wouldn't take 30 minutes. Would take like 5 at most. Use melee to get it to half health or less then use weaker weapon to get it to under a quarter than unarmed attacks a few times to get it to sliver health. Would be about melee attacks for each item at most.
---
Please HELP here!
---
There is a PC mod that colors your teammates icon green, it's AMAZING how this isn't in the standard game kills me.
---
I didn’t even realise there was a perk for helping preserve food, thank you so much. I’m tired of having so much food spoiling because I didn’t know a way to keep it fresher for longer.
---
It sucks throwing away so much spoiled food because I have like 8 steaks and numerous other things that I can’t eat before they go nasty 
---
Its the only receiver available, and you can learn it by scrapping
---
I'm the one saying the 1:2 million based on \~1% chance for a 3\* drop, but that's for a TSE 3\* Handmade where the last effect is arbitrary. 
---
Handmade has a \~1:42 chance of dropping from the ranged pool so any 2-3\* TSE has a chance of \~1:270,480. Replace "Handmade" with the weapon type you want, the chances remain the same.
---
These are *estimates* based on previous and current legendary enemy/drop occurrences. We don't know the actual chances as we don't know much about the drop selection process.
---
Stimpaks, who needs 'em? I just plug my wounds with trash. 
---
They have different types of lists.
---
mods, junk ect, have a component list, they are "made of this junk"
---
weapons and armors have a drop list. when you scrap them "you get this junk"
---
This is why they don't auto scrap, they aren't made of junk, you just get some when you break it.
---
Bethesda code
---
&gt; No, I am not 
---
Yes. yes you are
---
&gt; Maybe to you - who somehow missed all the crap BethesdaAustin and  BethesdaSoftworks pulled during the release of this game until now. 
---
I have watched them pull exactly 1 thing since launch. The Canvas bag bullshit which was done by marketing. Since then I have seen this sub jump on the hate wagon for the slightest pretense regardless of how much or how little proof supports the hate fest. 
---
I've been unable to play with my friend for months now, can't see her in my friends list and my invites to her never make it (and vice versa). Any fixes for that incoming?
---
Gunpowder can be gained from killing super mutants. I've had to drop thousands of the stuff because it was weighing me down at one point. Lead and steal can easily be found at mines or simply scrapping weapon and armor drops. Let's also keep in mind that dropping and picking up ammo (not simply crafting) gets tagged as "transferring ammo". To some getting so much ammo without exploiting seems crazy, which in part is if you're not accounting for the fact this is over a 30 day period. A lot can happy over 30 days. Especially if you no life the game. Also acid guides were explained in the 900 hours man og post. Getting cloth is pretty easy IF you somehow needed the gunpowder still. Again if you're with a crew getting these matts over a 30 day period is not impossible.
---
Kind of like those canvas bags bethesda was selling with the PA edition right? Oh wait....
---
This sounds like a classic case of jealousy.
---
LOOK AT WHAT HE HAS! I DON'T HAVE THAT! TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM!
---
It's not a good look, bro
---
This is (likely) the correct answer.  The software builds a new game file before deleting the old one, so you need room for effectively 2 full games at once (minus some ancillary files like caches).
---
Pretty standard stuff for programs that aren't built in modules.
---
Well considering you are 100% guaranteed to learn the recipe if you scrap one, this helmet as spread like wildfire. I dont think there's any way to tell which players broke into the Dev Room to get it and which were recipients of trade.
---
yeah, but have you always played at the same rate or did you play more to begin with?
---

Barry Mentats affects partied players as well. If I use it they all get obstructed vision from a purple aura around them, and thus I cannot ever use it when partied. :-(
---
Yeah but how would they guy charged with banning know all of this personal information about you.
---
?? Are you having a stroke? 
---
ahh, i see, that's why you're the statbot and i'm not!
---
Why? They're all forms of entertainment. There is a cost involved. Some moan I've wasted $50 on a game. Welcome to the real world.
---
\&gt;Chris Chan
---
Oh no. I think I'm good.
---
Same, bought the bench from atom shop and it moves to middle of room or at an angle every single time I leave my camp or login...lol 
---
I thought it was only me and a ghost of all the scorch or ghouls I’ve killed...
---
Purely circumstantial.
---
Well, that's sounds like a collateral damage.
---
Mostly convenience for trading, I think aluminum and one other thing actually do reduce the weight but not the rest.  They were supposed to all give you more space, but are glitched or were changed for balance or something.
---
I play with someone who keeps everything in his stash in bulk just so he can keep track of what's new.  To each their own, I only bulk stuff that you can't sell otherwise.
---
 Well, that’s definitely friendly fire. I’d say Bethesda is now marked "wanted".
---
That is your perogative. Skepticism is healthy, I suppose.
---
Hi There! Adrenal Reaction only debuffing hp for me and not buffing dps. I do not have nor had I been afflicted with Rad Worms
---
Found the plans for this in Watoga 
---
are any of those sentences?  tf are you saying?
---
Yes. They have 0 value if they're irrelevant.
---
Same here, only have the negative effects of adrenal reaction -12 hp. I have several mutations. Pretty much always carry a disease despite having -90 % chance to catch dessease from enemies and always having power armor on.....
---
It can’t be intended. Why have a mutation with no positive effect. Definitely an error, but my god it’s a massive one if you play low health style.
---
Its obvious he had taken advantage of many exploits. Now all that effort is a waste. So no, I would not say too well at all.
---
Thank goodness i stuck to a melee only build. 
---
Thanks!  After clearing the blood from my eyes, can confirm it works.
---
i play at different hours depending on who i'm playing with and where they are located
---
Looks fine to me. 
---
Weren't they like... 15 screws per piece at level 25?  Been a long time since I made mine.
---
Gonna be some drill fools running around now. Smh
---
They specifically said that it's only items that are designed to be rare that trigger a red flag on 100k accumulated in 30 days. The "900 hours" guy had collected something like a quarter million *Ultracite* ammo. There's no way 5mm would flag you in the same way. You could easily craft that much through normal gameplay by using the munitions depot and/or the tinkerer's workbench.
---
What outfit is this that’s been removed from the plans list??
---
No it isn't. Nothing you listed he did is an exploit.
---
He didn't know any personal information? 
---
Holy crap, are you actually making the comparison of banning CHEATERS to the god damn holocaust?????  GET SOME GOD DAMN PERSPECTIVE.
---
Invisible enemies bug is a pathing glitch where technically the ai has found a point to stop and fire at you that is technically around a corner / obstacle - essentially, exploiting terrain in a way us normal living players can’t detect or utilize with our plain senses. It may be they are glitched inside of terrain in combination but usually they are just chilling somewhere findable that doesn’t make sense, firing away. Some players did some investigating in areas that this commonly happened. You may have just found another hotspot for it. For me it happened just south and east of the watoga super duper mart across the stream (the earliest spot I could find to drop camp the first time I ventured into the bog after a team travel near mayor for a day.)
---
you provide the materials and pay me what you feel you can afford, some people pay a lot, some pay a little. All that really matters is people getting their sweet, sweet radiums fixed up to the best spec!
---
Nuked Prime with Green Thumb = 100+ raw flux in minutes.
---
Mining at Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator PA = 100+ lead ore in minutes.
---
Farming Whitespring, Big Bend Tunnel, Blackwater Mine, Grafton Steel Yard, etc. = loads of armor/weapons to scrap; the most time-consuming part in my experience.
---
Scrapping, smelting, and crafting with Scrapper, Chemist, Ammosmith, and Super Duper = tons of ammo from the above resources in minutes.
---
I've never had anywhere near 300k Ultracite ammo at one time, but I haven't the slightest doubt a smart player could craft that much in a month if so desired. Especially with the right mutations, weapons and armor, and perk loadouts to move and kill efficiently.
---
Bonus points if you hunt mirelurks. We're crab people now, Charlie!

Thats what happens when ur a grass

O.o
---
Chameleon mutation?
---
So here is why I come off a little butt hurt talking about Dupe Hunters.  Not saying you need to agree, just want to explain my point.
---
Whenever you see a post about someone doing this on Reddit they are always beating their chest and expositing how they have saved the world from dupers (exaggerating a bit here for emphasis).  They just took 131,072 (I’m using this specific number because of math and also it’s over the ban threshold) out of the loot pool and now they’ve really cooked those dupers goose.  
---
First, the problem is even with that VERY larger number of duped items removed (131,072) they’ve actually done nothing but stop one round of duping, and it’s not even a lot of duping.  Because of math, it will literally take them server hop ONCE to get all that loot back.  Let’s assume you started with 1 item of something, with 18 rounds of server hopping you would end up with 131,072 stacks of that same item (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072).  While I’m sure some of the dupe hunters understand this, it ‘seems’ that the majority of the ones that posted on Reddit do not.
---
Second, I’ve had my fair share of dupe police drop in on me in the middle of a trade and insist that both I and the person I’m trading with show them our inventory so they can make sure that we are not dupers.  More than once I’ve had someone attack my base for the same reason.  Maybe that makes me the a-hole, but I kinda doubt it.
---
Don't worry, man. I got downvoted a lot for questioning a lot of these people saying they were innocent, too. And every effing one of them later either got found out, admitted to something that probably caused their ban, or didn't know what they did exactly to cause their ban, but had still managed to break the terms of service. As usual, don't believe anything you read on the internet without some proof.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate the help. 
---
i'm fairly certain I've lost time rather than gained it!
---
nice, thank you very much for this, im trying to optimize my time better, and this will help a bunch
---
!
---
What does that mean?
---
Diehard... remember the guy who wanted to deal with Hans Gruber... he got killed... 
---
Every movie someone tries to make a deal and they end up dying... welcome to that club...lol
---
I've lost over 300 plastic because I've forgotten several times about this new "feature" while making my vendor rounds. &gt;:[
---
Ditto. I'd rather Pacifist mode be on, then if I want to attack someone else with a Bounty on their head, or return fire to some grub who attacks me and desperately needs it, then I can and it becomes PvP.  That way we get left alone unless we opt in to PvP if the mood hits us. I think that would be fair and discouraging trolling. 
---
Thats not really it i mean i know many people who bought loads of ammo or nukas from dupers are wrongfully suspended. and many people who actully are duplicating all day but with the story for you it just dont sound complete 
---
I beat his score and nearly quit before he even posted :)
---
The odds of the whole thing being legit are incredibly small, especially considering he has no use for Ultracite ammo.
---
Hahaha god people are whiny
---
Lol yeah, they got me good!
---
THEY GIXED THE NUKA GIRL SUIT, NO HELMET NEEDED WOOOOOOOT
---
There’s only one problem that I didn’t see sometimes you’ll get wanted just by getting a supply drop even if it’s no one’s
---
this is kinda the same with all the "Nobody asked for PVP" posts/comments/memes.  a bunch of us are always in there are like "I did."  it doesnt seem like anybody uses the word 'everyone' literally anymore.  people don't even use the word 'literally' literally any more.  
---
cant tell if trolling or serious
---
ROFL You win today!
---
Yeah but not the same or even similar forms. Athletic games for one, rely on the performance of actual people in real time. They can suck for a multitude of reasons and are inherent risks when paying for a ticket.  Everyone’s taste in movies is different and therefore subjective, person to person. One person may love it but the next, feel they deserve a refund. This game had and has, problems. Problems that aren’t acceptable for a full release AAA title. 
---
Any thoughts from the customer response team on the disappearance of certain plans (BoS combat armor chiefly) from vendors and whether or not that's intentional? 
---
And if it is intentional what's the rationale i.e. is there an invisible classification system that can be made visible where we can understand the difference between common and rare loot and farm common and rare loot events? Or perhaps certain events can narrow their loot table where you still need to work at it but at least you know you're grinding in the right spot? Or maybe diversify drops so that we aren't all farming the same few spots?
---
I'm personally feeling a little lost when it comes to trying to figure out 1) what armor to wear and 2) how to find the right mods for it.  I'm not sure what events drop what items so I end up just server hopping at the watoga railcars and waiting for that blackwater mine event with everyone else.
---
nice, thanks for this list
---
Do you even know what needy means? We are just having fun following a loser with zero self awareness.
---
They’ve confirmed it up there y’all, the unit is in lbs.
---
So is stalker supposed to be on the Legendary pool formelee weapons or have they not removed it yet?
---
&gt; 3k bullets per day
---
Or if you're a minigun user, per 5-10 minutes. Yep, I entirely agree, it is super easy to make ammo or get flagged. 
---
&gt;is it really the fault of the developer if someone blatantly cheats in a game they made? 
---
Some exploits are blatantly obvious and should have been caught in QA. If you can essentially "accidentally cheat" then that's on the devs at least as much as the players.
---
Of course exploiting bugs is bad for a player to do when we're talking about a multiplayer game where those exploits seriously imbalance things and fuck it up for everyone. But you're not going to get things done asking those players to kindly knock it off. It's up to the devs to close those holes.
---
I don't see many people in here saying dupers are totally ok and super awesome. It's possible to see what they're doing as wrong *and* want the devs to do something about it (and get mad when they don't)
---
I have Rank 2 Stealth perk, and the perk that makes running not affect stealth and is supposed to make enemies lose you when you enter stealth, as well as chameleon armor. For a while, I could make my way through a building/dungeon using a silenced weapon, and never get spotted. If I killed an enemy that was near another enemy, I'd get "caution", but as long as I was still they'd lose me.
---
Since a couple patches ago, I'd get "caution" before even firing a shot, and sometimes when I can't even find enemies in my area. I seem to get "danger" a lot easier than before, and even when I run and hide and initiate sneak again to lose them, I'd still be in danger. Sometimes I'll just fast travel to a train station, and as soon as I load in I'll be in "caution" even though there's nothing around.
---
However, other times, sneak seems to work as intended, so it's hard to pinpoint what exactly the issue is. At least, that's my experience with it. I'm no Xbox, if that matters.
---
I think is broken. The description about adrenal reaction in the pip boy doesn't show the positive effects.
---
None. Captured on a standard PS4
---
They literally had a website that decoded it all and gave you the launch code not too mention weekly updates for launch codes for all silos... this isn’t new... it’s been around for months.
---
Dead serious. It is an exploit that is used by over 80% of the player base. It needs to be corrected and people who gained an unfair advantage from it need to be banned.
---
Through scientific trial &amp; error (by mistake), I have found that being the Team Leader seems to trigger this issue always, leaving the team, then being invited back by someone else seems to fix it.
---
Also having Team mates in close proximity, can sometimes cause you to be instantly discovered when a team mate is, maintaining a little distance (at least 20') seems to help.
---
Upon exiting PA, sneak is sometimes not working well, only fix I have found is to re-log while out of PA.
---
that's some commitment!
---
The serum removes negative effects but because there is no positive effects it just removes adrenal reaction from your buffs.
---
"Don't be needy" says the guy posting reactionary bs for attention lol bravo
---
I wish I knew how many hours I've played, but FO76 doesn't keep track on consoles. Like some games
---
Right. That's why the first content drop is pvp.
---
You can, if currently on the same team.
---
Today's patch really fixed my problem. Thanks.
---
Correct it is not a Bethesda website. It is a third party providing codes that are aiding this exploit.
---
yeah, it's under Character I think
---
You would like the r/filthycasuals subredit! We don't bitch or moan there!
---
Same
---
They drop ultracite from their bones
---
Their what? Looks like a word randomly disappeared from your comment
---
I also love how I have over 20 perception and it affects me as much as someone with 1.
---
I'll have to do some more testing... I admit after the test in the comment below, I got wrapped up in a few other games and haven't played FO 76 much lately, just a bit here and there. I'll have to see if anything is different now!
---
I disagree completely with this.  I collected the Nuke codes the very first time I went into the silos and I never want to do it again.  It's a complete waste of time to collect them.  Bethesda gives you a way to collect them faster anyway.
---
Ohhhh! 
---
Yes, purified water certainly is a handy thing for selling to vendors.
---
People sharing the codes isn't cheating we were supposed to work together to do it that exactly what people are doing. Teaming up to collect and solve the codes every week and share them with others. If Bethesda didn't want us to do it this way they would have shut down the website people use.
---
Dang it, I was just getting all setup to run a low health build, as the only thing left to do in the game.
---
I would say that calling me “fucking dumb” crosses into the abuse side of things or is at least belittling, and proves my point. 
---
I agree that the products they, or any company releases should be good on delivery, however that is not the reality in any industry.  Even as far back as E.T. game developers had to churn out products sometimes to the detriment of quality, and we consumers always take a risk when we purchase.
---
Haha tattletale! That's what you get. 
---
Maybe it was fixed on one of the recent patches, I’ll have to try tonight. Thank you 
---
Probably explains a lot of the negativity in this sub. I just wanna play the game and have fun. I know it wasn't perfect but Bethesda is working on it. We were told before launch this would be a process. Them getting rid of duping is a great step in the right direction and those who are getting pissed they got banned were probably participating in one way or another. Quit rushing and cheating. Just play them game and have fun. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asde5w/patch_broke_adrenal_reactionbloodied_weapons/
---
It's the adrenal reaction mutation that is bugfed right now with the new patch... many people have the same issue right now including me
---
You need a life
---
Well , it does considering he said he never handled duped items , yet in a previous post he said that he has done in large quantities.
---
Not really looking for goodwill just stating a fact. Thanks for stopping by though.
---
What? I'm calling shenanigans on this.
---
It's a great game ? Really ? It isn't.  It's been fucked royally from the start. I put 250 hours into it and did enjoy alot of it.  But it's not a great game by any means. You should play a few other titles. 
---
you can place an item that they dont know but they wont be able to store it 
---
Dupapocolypse came and went and i still can’t tell what Power armor is in my f-ing stash box with out pulling every single frame out to find the one I’m looking for...................just saying ........ it’s the little things to that affect quality of game fun .................just saying......
---
The nuke codes are meant to be socially deciphered and documented in game for that purpose otherwise they would be unique per player.
---
The code pieces aren't the gate for nuke launches the launch card is.
---
Now I would be ++ for the cyphering method to occasionally change/rotate to make the community band together and decipher it.
---
As for the PA glitch, I agree, I imagine that that it will get patched in the future, they have been gradually patching PA geometry glitches.
---
So you’re asking them to ban the80% of the player base that has already been tired of their Shit and quit?
---
This is the only person ive heard complain about this if anything the decrypting sites are keeping the game alive at somepoints
---
i dont think you can with the atom items though
---
Hope they fix this bug soon...
---
Remember, my friend, deep breaths.
---
Additionally you will not have the option to place items purchased in the Atomic Shop in their CAMP.
---
I also just confirmed that adrenal reaction has no benefit. I even just took a serum with no result...please fix asap. This is my full build
---
Hahaha snakes get bitten too
---
No one wanted PvP - we all wanted NPCs for FO76 though!
---
I think there are grey areas. There are ways to cheese in single player and multiplayer games that just feel cheap and not really fun, but are completely legitimate and not cheating. Then there are exploiting things, maybe it's the one where if you log off and back on wearing Excavator you have 100 extra carry weight. If you need to fast travel and don't want to drop anything that exploit seems fairly reasonable. It's not hurting anyone. If there is a way to kill players in one shot while they are in slap damage mode, I would consider that pretty bad, and people are morally obligated not to do that, because that hurts other players experience beyond the realm of what is intended. I don't see the old cap stash farming as an exploit. I loved it and thought it was fun and worked perfectly. Caps stashes just aren't the same now. A certain feeling is gone with them being containers. There was just something perfect with how they were initially designed. I could talk about a lot of different glitches, cheats, exploits. I'm quite liberal with a lot of it. I would do some of them without hesitation. Building with foundations. Moving my CAMP a few inches to repair it. I haven't done these things but I would if I felt like it. I wouldn't dupe. Not because I feel like it's wrong but because of the consequences. I know developers really don't like that so I wouldn't personally do it. But I'm glad some people did it, because I got stuff that I never would have found myself no matter how many hundreds or thousands of hours I grinded for. And caps are so tedious to acquire now since cap stash nerf probably wouldn't have been able to buy them either.
---
That's a very mean way to treat your gf. She may be needy, but there's no need to call her a loser, friend.
---
"Newest exploit" are you serious? 
---
&gt; Fucking stash limit is too low this is ridiculous they really need to increase that shit 800 is too low
---
Hoarding never changes
---
I like the workshop changes, shows a big icon now of who owns it. And your not stuck in that little area around the bench when capturing. You can go buck nuts now on workshops contesting from outside the bench.
---
So I take it that you're not aware that both the trailer that introduced launching Nukes AND MODUS in-game both highly encourage getting help from other players to get the codes?
---
Yes, I thought of that as soon as I read the patch note, then the next person comes along, and 1 stray bullet still gets them wanted.
---
i totally feel for you, but as I have never been a mod probably have no idea the amount of childish shit you have to deal with, just wanted to let you know I could tell from the tone of this post that you are a bit irritated to say the least.
---
Hope your day goes well my dude.
---
I find if there is going to disconnects it always in the first 30ish mins and usually because the server needs a reboot.
---
/u/Valseek pls ❤️
---
Huh. I will revise.
---
But that said, thats an extreme case. Over 1 million rare items... And i see the "took from a mule" post...
---
Like the developer who leaked the way to exploit the duplication glitch out to the community? 
---
Sorry but no one just figures out that they can make X number of something and put it in something else and then put all their stuff in it knowing they could come back to that very same place and have a copy of it all... without someone inside not only creating it but telling people.
---
Remember what I said about lack of self awareness? Add lack of reading comprehension to that.
---
Lol okay dude... I play a lot of other games. I think 76 is a good game. It has bugs and Beth has been bad at practice this time around. That doesn't mean the game is bad.
---
Nooo maaan, you made group of people who killed so many queens. Maybe best group on PS4. But yeah with 199lvl i had problem killing 4 grasshoping vibranium made fking things.
---
They fucked up, hardly. 
---
Hope u get back when bethesda make survival mode live.
---
It was in the patch notes to "keep servers running more smoothly" or something like that
---
Leveling a char with just grenades is against TOS. It's an exp glitch...
---
I feel like my question is valid, and self explanatory.  
---
I don’t owe you an explanation even if you feel entitled to one.
---
It will be in the challenges menu
---
Just because OP says he isn’t trolling, doesn’t mean he isn’t trolling.
---
You could learn the plan for the Confederate Hat but not make it, I think it may have been the item in question.
---
My place is there too.  It's by far the coolest of all zones. 
---
it was probably his buddy who was snacking on the sprinkles and he just happened to walk by and accidentally got some on his face. Poor kid got banned for just being there..
---
Adrenal Reaction is broken for me too.
---
Is the new Bethdesda office only employed by fresh college interns??  That's a serious question, the sheer amount of amateur coding mistakes, and lack of testing prior to pushing to live shows a blatant lack of quality control that this studio has.
---
No it isn't, killing enemies with explosives isn't against the TOS. Likewise it isn't an EXP. glitch.
---
Pretty sure I read that the reduction was for repair only
---
I have had a few folks just randomly attack me. 
---
Can't stand griefers. That's not roleplaying at all. 
---
I read this as sarcastic 
---
Ok but now one of my turrets is identified as "hostile" with a red health bar and when I fast traveled back to my CAMP I caught it destroying other CAMP components, then it aggro-ed on me and tried to kill me.  I couldn't damage it but had to store it in my CAMP budget and replace it.  I really hope this doesn't happen again when I'm gone and my own turret systematically destroys my entire base
---
Not even stabilized - explosive weapons are a separate resistance, and most enemies don't have any resistance to explosive damage.  Players without the right perks/mods don't have explosive resistance either.  So really its just Bear Arms that will be of benefit to you.  Maybe Stabilized accuracy wise might help a bit to reduce the scatter, but that shouldn't even be enough of a benefit to use perk slots for on an explosive AOE type weapon.
---
It shows under challenges how long you've played for. I forget exactly which heading from there, but it is listed for consoles.
---
That's too annoying. Then we've got to go through the whole 'can my CAMP be placed shit' over and over.  As it is, I have to change servers for that reason and every time I get disconnected.  There's got to be a more efficient way. 
---
Back in my day shit like this would start a war in ashenvale
---
Right, but it’s been around for a long time and not new so I’m guessing Bethesda figures it’s too difficult to change the nuke code process so they’ll just make everything else harder like killing the SBQ or enemy in silos or worse making it not worth doing...
---
He didn't say they had a lot of grenades. They said they leveled a char with grenades. Not sure what you think they did? Make a shitload of grenades, transfer them to a mule, then only kill stuff with grenades?
---
Or do you think then used the grenade disarm glitch...
---
If that's really what they intended, it would have been way easier to just require the code items in order to initiate launch.
---
Sounds like everything worked out then, excellent!
---
FWIW I haven't quit and I'm having a blast. IMO FO76 has never been better than it is right now, with the +200 stash increase, adjustments to workshops and scorchbeast combat, new change so a stray bullet hitting another player's stuff won't make me Wanted, etc.
---
I'm actually just running around firing off Mini Nukes since I have \~200 of them, and Ultracite 50s since I've got about 13k of those left and my TSE 50cal is pretty weak since the TSE nerf anyway. I'm guessing I wasn't banned because I've never used a mule character, never duped, and have crafted all my own ammo etc.
---
So anyway, yeah I'm having a great time and am glad I wasn't banned, and you're having a great time and are glad you were banned. Perfect!
---
I read another post that the text mod wouldn’t flag your account but never saw an “official” answer.
---
Sure gimme a few, on mobile atm
---
Does Bethesda have a moral obligation to fix known exploits?  I’m told by modders that many glitches, including the most popular duping methods, were known issues in Fallout 4, and perhaps earlier.  Does such negligence render Bethesda partially liable when a player inadvertently finds or traded for a duped item?
---
I know several other friends from my discord that got wrongly hit so all of the buzz from nay-sayers doesn’t bother me. I’m definitely soured on this game though, I just have no idea what direction to look for something new to play at the moment :/ especially something fun for us all to be able to get into together in this looter shooter style 
---
So happy I avoided this game.
---
Don't check your email Mr. Schrodinger you may make an observation.
---
So you stopped playing right after release? 
---
I’ve been using a few mods since beta, no issues yet.
---
Interesting point, so you feel its morally ok to cheat in a video game but not to the detriment of other players, but in reality isn't it always to others detriment even our own. If you buy a great gun off a duper doesn't it kill the joy of finding it yourself? Are you not in some way cheating yourself out of the games experience?
---
Well, thankyou for being so mature mate, I must admit that your considered response gave me pause.  Perhapse you are right, I was very frustrated and disapointed with many aspects of 76 especially after FO4. I'm still not convinced that the original poster is being factual in his account but that is by the by.  If Bethesda managed the feedback better I would consider returning to the game, but I am left with being continuously slaughtered by players young enough to be my kids on Apex ledgends.  
---
Cheers &amp; Safe travels.
---
There's mention in the strategy guide of vending machines at your CAMP. I'm guessing this is what we'll end up getting. Probably similar to the ammo abd medicine machines dotted around.
---
Okay, so how do you decode the code pieces? Don't look at the wiki or guides, just write it down the steps! How many times did you decode them yourself? How many times did you benefit from a nuke zone that was dropped because of this "exploit"? "But I didn't/couldn't know!" - that didn't work for duped items as an excuse, why would it work if you did benefit?
---
server hop?
---
purchased of a robo vendor. 
---
From what I've been reading the acquired part might be what makes him seem less of a duper 
---
I'm not 100% sure but just by swapping the amount back and forth it artificially inflates the amount you've acquired in a month
---
For example If you had 15,000 ammo and switched it back and forth with a mule  once you've acquired 30,000 of that ammo .
---
The system in that case is flawed since you didn't actually have at any point  30,000 it's just how it counts 
---
Swap ammo between accounts multiple times and you could easily " aquire  100,000+  ammo in a month if you're an experienced player 
---
"Power Armor: The amount of springs required to craft and repair level 25, 35, and 45 Excavator Power Armor Legs has been significantly reduced."
---
It's funny how easy it is to trigger some people.
---
So sensitive to silly words.
---
He means how would the people who are handling the bans know to pick out and pass you over specifically
---
This means someone else is already trading with him 
---
You implied everyone asked for PvP - just go look around this sub - the majority of the playerbase doesn't have any interest in PvP.  Its just a few tryhards like you - its really pointless in this game because a builds based system will never be balanced well for PvP.
---
A real balanced PvP will make all PvE content a lot less fun overall too.  You better believe it - most of us want nothing to do with this PvP BS, and its watering down the fun in the PvE aspects as weapons and everything will eventually start feeling like pea shooters in the name of PvP balance.
---
Only after listening to your problems with my problems.
---
I still have 7 hours to burn. Thanks in advance for my cheap entertainment. 
---
Lol you guys are sheep who are beta testing the game for me // thanks for making it good for the first major patch /spit
---
So is it ok if I post people's Reddit histories from now on to discredit them. Not to say let's go target so and so but to "warn and inform the community to what they did"?
---
yep lol
---
I'm sure its been broken.. I mean fixed to make the game more fun 
---
did you try the middle terminal? after the last patch (not the one today), I haven't been able to use ANY terminal except for the middle ones for all of the MODUS vendors. 
---
I hope you get your account back soon, it seems ridiculous to get banned over a bugged server side item counter.
---
No more sliding to 0 then 25000? Dang they fixed the game! lol
---
The middle console is the only one that works
---
Herd Mentality is no longer affected by Class Freak while we're on the topic of broken stuff.
---
WANTED STATUS:
---
There is still another way to become accidentally wanted: picking a lock within a workshop's boundaries that you didn't realize was owned. This happens a lot with safes and toolboxes that are in a nearby building that you might not realize still fell within the boundaries of the workshop.
---
"Owned" locks should be displayed in RED like in earlier Fallout games, with an additional warning text, "Picking an owned lock will cause you to become Wanted!" so there is no chance for accidental crimes.
---
Found the guy who got banned for duping.
---
On that I can agree 💯 
---
What your asking for is a way to lock items much like Destiny or The Division. I agree on that, it would be nice.
---
A game I spent $80 on that barely works.
---
But it’s just a game so you have no reason to be mad. /s
---
I'm laughing my ass off, you are delusional.

I don't have a problem with adding more friendly characters, but doesn't rose and the vendors count as NPCs? Or did you just mean humans?
---
You're not selling me ... 'cool' weapons argument doesn't really hold water ... i have plenty of 'cool' weapons. I'm not hoarding every 1 star nocturnal pipe wrench that i find ... im selling them to vendors ... just like everyone else. 
---
Now hoarding ammo on a 'safe' account, while duping on a second playstation/xbox/ whatever amount ... or being the mule for your duper friend(which isn't im my opinion a bad enough offense to warrant a ban)  is technically or directly in violation of the terms and services of the game ... you bought the game not the servers to play it on. 
---
There are plenty of valid reasons for having an abundance of 'cool' stuff ... none of your arguments hold that kind of water ... and changing the reasoning behind your claims of innocence now would only prove your guilt. 
---
Now, you're either scheming for another angle like a scrum bag or you're accepting your punishment like a man, or you really are innocent and then for hope sake i hope you are vindicated. If not, i hope you learn something. 
---
I guess theres a reason they're giving this game away for free!
---
I don’t think we need a higher turret budget. We just need more effective turrets if we are facing large scale attacks. Even rocket turrets don’t do well against level 68 supermutants.
---
Also, we REALLY NEED fixed turret AI. My turrets do nothing far more often than they actually engage. Even when something’s munching on them I’ve seen them just scanning back and forth. 
---
My entire CAMP doesn't have a floor now because it uses the Atom store hardwood floors.  All Atom store objects are not rendering into the game, both texture and object mesh.
---
Believe me I'm not sticking up for Bethesda but if no one cheated in the game would they need to divert man hours to fixing exploits? Would they not be able to actually improve the game and add content instead of trying to stop people cheating?

&gt; Stash size, this time from 600 to 800 pounds,
---
Good to see!   I tried to come back recently, and was about 200 lbs overweight, and just couldn't be assed to spend another 20 minutes playing inventory management simulator.  Ended up just Alt+f4'ing after already having spend 15 minutes trying to reduce weight.  
---
Seems like I'll be pretty close now, so yay!  
---
So glad I am not the only one that thinks this.  Yes I would buy some in the atomic shop.
---
You sure it wasn't the Marine Tactical Helmet?  Pairs well with the wetsuit?  Pretty sure the one this user is talking about looks more like a power armor helmet.
---
Doesn't mean that anyone has to put up with it or should care if you like it. 
---
The game was sold as allowing PvP but people who don't like PvP were told it would be highly discouraged if they didn't want to participate.  ... Bethesda didn't keep their promise on that point. 
---
The bottom lime is that you should be welcome to attack anyone who *wants* to engage in PvP, but you have no right to attack the 12 year old who got the game for Christmas or the 53 year old (me) with crippled hands who couldn't win a PvP fight against anyone. (And I don't want to.)
---
People who are set passive have the right to play how they want to without you being a jerk and screwing with them. 
---
Huh. That's ridiculous. Early on in the game I saved up enough materials and bulk crafted about 30,000 rounds worth of .50 cal and 5mm. All in one go (thanks super duper and Ammosmith!). Their anti-cheat system must be wacky.
---
Use middle terminal in bunker area with 3 kiosks and use the second from the left in production. 
---
There was some glitch that got reported and that’s why only one works now.
---
it is neither, regardless of your feelings.  they have made many games, is it so hard to believe I liked literally every one of them and had high hopes for this particular one?
---
I am actually glad to see this. One of my long term goals with my scout/sniper build is to randomly shadow a newer character in full stealth randomly sniping stuff AFTER they have gotten a hit in without them ever seeing me. Vault survivors be good crazy too!
---
Extremely difficult to pick up = understatement
---
I'm not sure what you are doing wrong.  My stealth rifle guy is tearing it up.  I use a one star instigating lever action and it is killer. 
---
Map -&gt; options -&gt; challenges, its a global timer, not per account.
---
The thing is I know how to dupe items but I choose not to as I believe it is morally wrong, someone could tell me the cheat code to get 1million caps but I wouldn't do it as it would ruin my experience of the game and for others around me
---
Wouldn't be the first time someone made an off the wall build to beat a fallout game. I saw someone running around with a build specifically using a "commie whacker" as their main weapon. So why would it be outlandish for someone who has already put 900 hours into a game make a new build to try to keep things interesting?
---
I mean it isn't hard at all to get an ass ton of mats to make insane amounts of grenades. Especially if you have a higher level character like they did. I know I had over 4k gunpowder before I even hit level 30 on my first character. 
---
So yeah I could definitely see someone use their high level character to feed a new character gear to play a unique way to make the game interesting. 
---
anytime I connect wires now, I get that spark floating in the air. 
---
All of what you said...exactly! I've been carrying all the things I like with me since they weight less, while regretfully selling/giving away all the weapons and armor sets I'd like but don't necessary need. 
---
Also excited to not to NEED all the weight reduction perk cards all the time
---
I agree the frequency of posting should be ignored. But people trading huge amounts of extremely hard to get stuff is a dead give away.
---
It's like the old Xbox forum where people that got banned would complain about how they did 100% absolutely nothing wrong, and then Xbox enforcement would post what they did. It was great reading.
---
My problem is I'm just a hoarder. I spend all of my gunpowder, lead, and steel making 5.56 for my pimped out *** handmade, and everything else is just stuff I loot. I ended up spending over 80 flares I had sitting around to try to draw people towards graham or the charleston vendor bot. I have thousands upon thousands of .45, shotgun shells, .38, etc. Over 100 plasma cores, 30 something fusion cores (despite being EXTREMELY wasteful with them), 250+ 40mm grenades, ~20 mini nukes. Idk how many missiles because I actually use those very frequently. I love shooting down scorchbeasts with my AA quad barreled targeting missile launcher
---
I've seen with decent evidence that it was always a unbeleiveable super rare loot drop from glassed caverns. And only that spot with a giy sayibg farming it for a month and a half to find it on a static enemy. So it's been acuireabke since beta. Not just the development room
---
Excellent! Your ban is a win-win for everyone then!
---
I don't mind grinding for things in games. I have done big grinds to get items I wanted in games, but they were like farming dungeons over and over, and I knew what mob dropped the item I wanted. I don't mind that. I just don't like the loot system in this game. It's too random. Too much noise to signal ratio. Can't find any patterns in it. In my mind I'm seeing thousands of hours to find the exact item I want if I ever actually find it. It wouldn't be any different buying it from a duper or buying it from the market from someone who found it in my opinion. The source doesn't really bother me. At least more people can have fun with it if it's duped. Even though duping may have caused server instability and some people took it too far to the extremes, etc. which I'm not going to try to justify. But I think the loot system is partly to blame for peoples willingness to dupe and engage with the duped market.
---
the official answer is that they don't support mods. Whatever that means is up to you. I've been running most mods since launch, havent been banned.
---
Had to remove that one from the Data folder to get the atom shop stuff appearing / working correctly. In addition to the Archive2List update. 
---
i don't even know where tf to go for the story, not that i particularly care. i'm a fallout lore nerd (and various other franchises) but i don't really care much. i'm just here with my friends giving isotopes and stuff to my friend who sells mutation in return i get cool guns and stuff. i'm here to meme around. i'm not one for hand-holding and feel most games these days do that wayy to much (be more like morrowind please ES6 *please*) anyway yeah.
---
Nope, the game may not work as intended though
---
Middle left one works still. The rest were deactivated in theast patch to prevent a duping exploit.
---
It's griefing if they're minding their business and set passive. 
---
Too. Fucking. Brilliant. 
---
For about a week now. On lots of different enemies too 
---
I guess it is not your opinion of how the rules should be that is being followed. 
---
I got that error 2 days ago. Received an email saying I was banned for duping... WTF! I never duped anything. I don't even have two of the same weapon or armor. Their email said I had over 100,000 Legendary items within 30 days. I don't know how they determine who is a duped but it is GARBAGE BS! Their team or algorithm to find dupers is crap and doesn't work at all. I've always tried to play as legit as possible and I still got banned. Also I know of a few dupers and they are still playing online. Ya real nice Bethesda... I wish I could band you a**
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Should I type in mod names in the \[mod1.ba2\], \[mod2.ba2\], \[mod3.ba2\], or should I leave them as they are?
---
Tis is a good one actualy :D
---
The actual mods are yes, but they're random as to what's on offer so it can be exceptionally tedious getting your hands on a specific mod. The X-01 is now I think the only PA that doesn't have mod plans.
---
Since he doesn't seem to realize that he was using an *ore* duping exploit, of all things, it makes you wonder what other exploits he was using that he doesn't understand are exploits.
---
You're the kind of customer who we like and help as quickly as possible.  There are many who will refuse to give their information to anyone until they feel like they've been escalated at once... They send emails with just their phone number demanding that a supervisor call them and won't answer questions about their issues.
---
That is not what that says. If that was true All his trading between both his accounts as what he said he was doing Would be inflated way more than what his account would have said it had on it and. He said his second account was his mule account. His first account would have had all the same amount of ammo and ultracite. His main was only found to have 140k ultracite. His second account which was a mule account had the bulk of the items found on it. Do you see how that would not work with your explanation? His first account that he was using to craft and stuff would have also had some traces of other ammo, not just the ultracite. 
---
Maybe you shouldn't have duped. Being happy for banned dupers is something that only dupers would cringe at.
---
No :( Rly like the game
---
Wonder if its related to the radworm issue they just patched out.
---
it's intended i hope
---
You're a loser.  Go away.
---
No problem! I know the feeling of watching a beloved franchise crash (goodbye Warcraft). And it took me a while to realize I was both wasting my time and instigating pointless (anonymous) arguments in a forum that maybe I no longer belonged to. Especially if I'm wrong and the devs aren't turning into greedy con-men, my words are just counter-productive. There _are_ greener pastures. And while I'll always appreciate the work Bethesda has done, I hold no illusions it'll last forever (Activision-Blizzard proves it). FO76 wasn't what I wanted either, but for me, it also showed me _I don't really know what I want_. So for greener pastures I search.

I learned one of the most useful things I have ever learned today: Crits render Sentinel's Assassin griefer's protection useless. I just happen to have a rifle crit build...I was leaving certain jerks alone because I thought I couldn't kill them, but the next one I see is getting shot. 
---
Get good noob
---
Bloodied good, adrenal reaction not working
---
Well yeah, there's been brigading on this sub for months. It's probably some 4chin group or troll discord. Maybe even just some dumb 19 yr old college kid who just learned the words "social experiment." Regardless, there are definitely people who benefit from the negativity. Some say corporate espionage but I don't think so. Probably just YouTubers looking for content lol
---
I agree! I was just saying that in this game specifically the ability to duplicate anything was an actual creation and not just a random glitch. 
---
Since you know what is involved... What are the odds that someone randomly, even a skilled Fallout player would decide to craft X items and go through the whole process thinking they would get double? 
---
I’m not buying it at all. The probability of that is astronomical impossible... 
---
What rules were broken? there is no rule against mules, there isn't even any rules at all close to saying mules aren't allowed you could twist into some sort of "but see it IS against the rules". There is literally nothing in the rules at all close to saying any of those things are against the rules.
---
This is the era of misinformation. US politics, fallout 76, and everything in between. 
---
Dupers will not get their bans lifted.
---
You had rad rats inside your armor! 
---
Hmm, now I have to check! Sorry if this was a mistake.
---
I meant actual humans but I’ll take more robots too...  I really only consider Rose and Grahm as close to real NPCs.  There are no true dialog trees with either of them, so they aren’t true NPCs in non human form.
---
Of course. Whatever you need to tell yourself to feel better.
---
This subreddit is kinda stupid. When someone mention real problems he get downvoted. But hoax and bullshit gets insane amound of attention. Cg guys.
---
PC BoS, and only because some one mass sold to it. IT is not a natural spawn.
---
I see that now, thanks :)
---
I've had this happen pretty consistently with potted plants.
---
If I just keep my eyes shut, they can't ban me. 
---
thank you. I've been trying to trade with it for … too long
---
Read my post up above it might always been retrievable.
---
Do you know how much stuff you would need to do all of that. that is not just 300k of ultracite but over 300k of other ammo as well in just 1 month. 
---
Skipped Welch?  Partner's family is actually from there.   Next visit to WV was going to be graveyard hunting but now there are more places I want to see from the game.
---
Ok but do you have hundreds or thousands of the same TSE weapons?
---
We don't know what the weapon cutoff is but for ammo it is characters with 100k+ of multiple calibers.
---
The weapon limit to ban could be 10, 100, or 1000 plus we just don't know yet.
---
But hey, they fixed the Mothman headlamps.
---
Some Atomic Shop items and textures can appear missing or invisible while running mods. If you are using mods, does disabling them resolve the issue?
---
It does though.  Go look at your achievement list in game.  There is an achievement for playing 7600 hours and it will have your total hours listed there.
---
That would be the case if his main character was the only one he played, but he said he has multiple characters he plays, so the mule absolutely would have more than the main characters would because the mule is a mule for all his played characters. While the played characters aren't acting as mules for the other played characters.
---
The people duping shit, I seriously doubt they were doing it for fucking XP. That's just silly when literally one legendary mob at whitesprings during a nuke would give you more XP than *any amount of crafting anything at all in the game for hours, maybe days*.
---
There's only a few ammo types that literally weigh zero, even with bandolier 2 for example 50 cal still weighs something like .00001 or something like that, so when I have 60,000 of that ammo, I'm aware that's 6 pounds of weight on me, while 5mm weighs literally nothing. 55.6, .45, shotgun ammo- pretty much the main ammo anyone but a heavy weapons user uses still has weight.. so duping that ammo when it's so easy to craft doesn't make sense if you're going to add 1 pound per 10k ammo.
---
Look at recent comments for tips how to very quickly and very easily craft a  shit ton of ammo with only 3 minutes and a server hop per large batch.
---
Provided I have enough acid, which I usually have a ton bulked and in my stash, I could easily craft over 100k with less than an hour invested in total. Fuck, if I were determined I bet I could craft over a million ammo in a week, though 100 pounds of extra carry weight doesn't appeal to me **at all**.
---
The guy has 900 hours in this game, that's easily more than double my time invested- and although he gave some solid tips and advice the other day, nothing he suggested is hard to figure out and there's plenty of players that have their own methods that work as well as his or even better.
---
Bottom line, for those who figured out how easy this game is, how little effort just about anything in this game takes- there's simply no reason to cheat at all.
---
Thanks for the report, we're looking into this!
---
Sorry, I didn't read carefully enough.
---
If you were ever in the possession of lots or rare items, like 69 million quantum's or 3 trillion lock pic bobble heads there is a good chance you'll be banned. if you didn't do anything wrong,  you won't be banned 
---
Experience Tranquility...Lane.
---
Come on! One of your 3 possible comebacks again!! Invite him to meet you at Grafton LOL xD
---
thank you, and thanks for the explanation. multiple terminals with a shared stock does sound exploitable in hindsight.
---
If that was the issue then the amount of rare stuff he has on his main and mule accounts would be roughly the same, only being different by an amount about equal to the real amount you have. The differences between his main and mule accounts are off by 84,151, just for the ultracite ammo, and his main account isn't even listed as having the other kinds of ammo.
---
What about the issue with the excavator power armor not registering carry weight properly? If I'm wearing the armor when I spawn into the world the carry weight is correct but if I exit and re enter it, the carry weight is 100 pounds less. Has this been  known?
---
You can’t build atom store items in someone else’s camp though.
---
As far as I could tell he was a duper trying to cover his ass
---
Why the need for two accounts 
---
Just play the game 
---
How is passing items back and forth between characters even a thing anyways I say do away with it 
---
No need for it
---
I second the motion to pass the resolution 😀
---
That's not a bad idea. 
---
Too bad only a fraction of players (those on reddit) will know what it means.
---
Would have been a good thing for BGS to have in the game. Especially for player vending.
---
thanks :)
---
I check it after every single patch to see, especially if it's not mentioned in any patch notes.
---
I love roleplaying, but I have a loud family and I’m not much of a voice actor.
---
Again like I said its a PvP game and until theres separate servers thats how it is.
---
The foundations of my CAMP have vanished after the latest patch was installed.
---
They were items bought in the Atomic Shop if it matters.
---
Oh yeah OK, I get that,this post is not out of anger, it is more to bring attention to the situation.
---
Just make it that you need the physical cards to launch a nuke.
---
I love that they frequently give modded armor pieces. Super valuable for learning mods from scrapping. 
---
"I was only in there to get directions on how to get away from there." -- Principal Skinner
---
Nice job, Bethesda!
---
you need a totally separate perk "escape artist" in order to get the benefit of enemies losing you when you run away.  
---
That said, escape artist is bugged since Jan 29 and currently does exactly nothing.  It used to apply a temporary chameleon effect when you initially enter stealth but it stopped doing this on Jan 29th patch.  Restoring that functionality should fix this bug.
---
*Stable* flux?  You've played 'really' casually and collected enough glowing and hardened masses and hr fluids to craft stable flux? 
---
It's been calculated elsewhere how much time and effort it would take to amass the ultracite 900 guy would've needed.  It's not 'very believable' at all.
---
Then you could just kick his ass. If he spends so much time shooting all your shit, you should be able to realize someone is shooting your shit. 
---
Just came in here to say fuck this game, and that I'd like to pat myself on the back for seeing how much of a shit show cash grab this game was before it came out. Good job me.
---
Used to be back towards the beginning of the game but they started taking a few minutes. Never seen them take 30-60 though. But maybe that’s what’s happening and I’m not being patient 
---
Just faced a queen minutes ago (10-15) - around 10 of us could not take her down.  Got past the initial respawn of her health - then any damage on her just stopped....
---
Ammo sponge after that - just stopped trying and a few folks just ran off.....
---
My speedo goes goes to 260 km/h, but I still can get a ticket for going over the posted speed limit and not following the rules, wtf right?
---
Logic sucks eh?
---
I do have some sense of it, yes, having myself crafted 25k Ultracite 50cal in well under a week before I knew some of the things I mentioned (especially Lucky Hole Mine for lead). I also was just in-game giving away all of my unneeded ammo to a player; since I tend to pick up everything and sort it out later, he probably just got 20,000 assorted ammo items.
---
No you
---
He only had two characters and they were both banned 1 main 1 mule. That is why he came here. He can't use them anymore. Not to mention he lied and said they got banned when the duping ban wave happened but it ended up he was banned before the ban wave and he tried to make it see like the ban wave banned him and it was a error. 
---
Love this patch so much, thank you for your hard work Devs!
---
Kind of minor, but it drives me a bit crazy that spoiled food is in aid. Has it already been suggested to move it to junk? 
---
I can't take credit but thanks!
---
I don’t think so but I’ll pay more attention next time I attempt to call one in to be safe.
---
Maybe I’m just being impatient, but I remember them only taking a minute or two a few months ago 
---
No ur mom

No weapon balance changes huh? Man I just want energy weapons to be good :\

Yeah, I have that. Just couldn't think of the name of it.

Invisible enemies more than likely whenever it happens to me I start swinging until it gives me exp
---
"Dingy draws" made my freaking day.  Thanks :D
---
all is right with the world again....
---
So..... sounds like you fucked something up with the mods then. It works for everyone else not running them. It works for everyone running them who uninstalled them or did the workaround. \*shrug\*.   
---
Maybe before accusing others of being "noobish", try doing some basic research? IDK.
---
I had this happen about a week ago - seemed to be location based.  If I got further away from where it was happening it tapered and stopped.  Like there was a very-strong radiation effect happening that wasn't being indicated in any way.
---
Whee, thank you! Apparently my searching conditions were too specific when I looked on the sub. Thank you!
---
Interesting, what I enjoy about the randomness of the loot is that it forces me to try out new weapons so while I'm not normally a big gun guy if I get a cool mini gun or flamer then I will roll with that, my ideal weapon is a pistol and I haven't found one with all the stats I want but I enjoy the hunt for it, I hate grinding in games but I see grinding as doing something you don't enjoy over and over again to get something where as I enjoy the game so it's not a grind. I personally would never buy an item, whether with real money or in game money from an illicit source as I feel it would ruin the game for myself and for others (market values etc)
---
I remember those lol, still never got banned and had like 60mill in dropped cash. 
---
I freaking killed three in less than 10 minutes along with three waves of scorched for.. SB liver n brains no legendary weapons or armor. On more than two occasions.. 
---
I took one look at the post history and was disgusted to see just how many things he was trying to justify as "ok". not everyone has a "anything not explicitly forbidden is acceptable" attitude. He interpreted the rules as he saw fit. It did not work out well for him.  He lost a massive investment by doing it "his way".  If the world seems wrong change yourself.
---
nice! Thx man!
---
I get downvoted for small things all the time. Especially when I mention a localization issue. Power armor HUD is only in English, and I been asking for a fix since October. I just get downvoted and told to play the game in english.
---
No, if you read his first post he has 4 characters. his mule and his 3 characters he plays.
---
I sell meat - my icon is cleaver.  Who am I kidding the meat is free.
---
But you're spreading the good word. Now I, as a loyal member of the cult of the Mothman, can see all the lovely things I just bought.
---
He's 100% trolling because he's mad he or a friend got banned for doing "nothing wrong."
---
I'll take your shit
---
Are you sure another player didn’t clear the area before you got there and the enemies just loaded strangely before the server recognized that they were all dead?
---
they would need to hit me back though

Check your fallout76.ini and make sure it didn't copy the mods to there. I noticed, when I was having trouble with the Save My Stuff mod, that it really didn't want to let me remove it.
---
Not time bloodied gets a Nerf. Melee next half of it.
---
Hi, this bug existed since Morrowind, almost 20 years ago. The issue is with how the Creation Engine generates the ground. The paper bag is actually generated properly, it just falls beneath the ground.
---
Unfortunately there's no fix for it, it just works man, sorry.
---
 This one isn't really their fault as modding isn't officially supported yet.
---
Noo man now mod will ban u for week like he did it to me. Noooooooo i love u, dont die
---
Sorry you lost your stuff.
---
There is a "work around" for next time, that may let your retrieve your stuff; drop an item as close to where your bag dropped when you died, and if it's close enough, it will transfer all of your stuff to the new bag.
---
I've only done it twice (screw you Morris!), but it's worked for me both times.
---
Sometimes the map fails to load details and enemies. I have been attacked by invisible ghouls and yao guais. Only thing I could do was run away until the game was ready to load the world and objects in.
---
I don't see how It would be close to the same 
---
Just by dropping it and picking up again can easily inflate  ones account , especially since you use a main account to actually play and the other to store stuff.
---
You don't put spent or used ammo on a mule account after all 
---
I don't get what you mean about the main account not even listing other ammo. Since we'll it says he's got a lot of the other ammo types as well
---
I don't need to invite you guys; you already know that you are always welcome at Grafton.
---
What are you talking about? 
---
What is it he said was okay that wasn't in your opinion? Also you do realize he has multiple accounts with high levels given to him already right? He probably made out like a bandit from this and has more now than he did before the ban thanks to ending up with a post hitting the front page of /r/all. LOL
---
I am on PC! I'll DM you!

Marine Tactical Helmet, Wetsuit, and BOS Underarmor, as well as (seemingly more rarely) various actual armor mod plans, spawn in the train car just west of Watoga Station.

Seriously.  I think it's reached peak stupidity when a person compares Bethesda banning dupers to the Nazis hunting Jews in the Holocaust.  JFC.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

Regardless of how or why the method exists, we are responsible to not use it. This is clearly spelled out in the terms, by the way.
---
You just keep on giving ♡ srsly
---
Just quit. This game is garbage.  The only fun is reading this sub.
---
I was really hoping my robot hacker rank 3 perk card would let me do that. But it doesn't =[
---
Fuck I have a bloodied unyielding adrenal build. Hope this is fixed soon 
---
What can I say, I'm a generous man.
---
wait, how do you send a message
---
I can tell! 
---
Better to avoid people these days haha. Feel sorry for your experience, but you know when they are all frustrated, they do negative things to other people.
---
Indeed.
---
Remember they nerfed the explosive legendary effect into the ground. You’re not gonna get any significant damage out of it now
---
I once posted about scorchbeast sonic cry spam needing a cool down timer and got told I was just bad at the game... post tse nerf everyone wanted the cool down timer. I think the ban post are getting so much attention because so many people traded for that one item they think was duped and they’re scared. Ghandi once said fear prevents fact checking 
---
Ummm...can I buy one? If you're on Xbox?
---
Pretty please :)
---
Yeah, kinda annoyed that my underarmor pokes through my Mantaman suit...and kinda think it makes me look like a lunatic who found a Mantaman suit in a bombed out building. Considering I *am* a lunatic who is running around in spandex, wearing a vault boy statue head as a helmet, and leaping through the air while yodeling before smashing down on ghouls it kinda fits.

But yes, please fix clipping...but maybe also give us a fucked up version of the outfits?
---
I only added the locations I’ve been to.
---
Welch is fine but it’s not really prominent. I wish it still looked the same as it did in the 1940s and 50s but it’s kind of just an insignificant urban town now. No offense 
---
Oh boo boo that's good to hear and btw not reading anymore of ur shit 😝
---
I think even human NPC interactions would be the same though. They could add multiple dialogue choices, but I think if they were going to they would have had at least rose have that system from the beginning.
---
Good thing I won't be playing till they fix the game then haha
---
Isn’t using mods currently a bannable offense? Even if they’re just cosmetic?
---
It was definitely very glitchy and things took forever to load. 
---
Oh yea I’m glad you mentioned the nukes part. He told me when he first joined there was a red ring from a nuke drop around the Whitesprings Resort, but it disappeared soon after he got in. Sounds like you’re onto something regarding the nukes. I’m betting that’s a, BIG, part of it!
---
Right? I figured you would be able to at least temporarily make them not hostile if nothing else. 
---
I can verify this! Person dropped a bullet and the bag appeared, only saw it once but remembered it if it ever happened to me to use! 
---
Pete??
---
Tell that to the people that did the XP grenade glitch, it literally gave you a few XP and they sat there for hours doing it.
---
People on twitch and YT streamed doing it... So yes people are stupid enough to do this kind of thing.
---
I would prob say the same thing if I were in your shoes... Except I kept proof of all of this. Which is in my Bethesda ticket
---
Same here .....will ruin this build 
---
It would be very unlikely that anyone would do it by accident let alone realising what they did and then recreating it, I agree it's most likely a developer cheat to help test the game and stuff and it leaked out, but every game has cheats I feel it's up to the player base to take some responsibility for there own actions and not exploit it. What does it say about the morals of people who would ruin other people's experiences to gain a few extra items, or is it ok as it's just a game? 
---
I confirm. no positive effect of addrenalinic reaction
---
Uhm, how long do you want to live? Are you sure u are giving them egouth time? 
---
It's called under armor, not inside armor.
---
I've found that owning a workshop sets you in PvP mode whether you're at the workshop or not. I used to build up the food factory and have it as a free hand out of food and purified water for the low levels that explore that way. I put up the card board vault boy pointing to the resources. After being one-shotted near the church far from the workshop I wont do that mistake again. If a challenge tells me to claim a workshop I just claim it and immediately jump servers. Great way to rebuild Appalachia!
---
Sorry about that.
---
How is using a relevant quote to the situation a comparison to one of the darkest moments in recent history? You can't be this stupid. 
---
Appreciate the info. Will die again soon to see lol.
---
I logged on after updating on PC, to find that my PipBoy using the Grey and Blue colors from the Atom Shop show a blank texture now:
---
https://imgur.com/a/FYLsfPH
---
And you've never held other duped items before or since, and didn't participate in duping before they "patched" it?
---
Lol, driven through it and yes it is very insignificant I agree.
---
I had this happen with the SBQ a few days ago... my first time killing her... made me rage quit for the night.
---
Love watching charge super mutants just stop in their tracks fun perk
---
Some people have been doing the math I am pretty sure that there is no way he could have legit done all 645.654k worth of Ammo all in 1 month collecting and crafting I could be wrong but I would have to see a lot of proof that is what happened and he should not be banned.  What else leads me to belive this was his lie that he got banned in the ban wave for the duping when he got actually banned before the ban wave and then came here saying he was caught up in the ban wave and it must of been a mistake. there are just to many inconsistency with what he says. It is not a death sentence as the email states he will be able to play again after 
---
 future patches fix some issues regarding what he was banned for. 
---
You forgot Hillbilly Hot dogs just north of Huntington.  That's a real place.
---
" SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.
---
Lol.  No, but I'm glad there is someone else out there preaching the importance of a varied meat based diet.
---
No, they are implying he leveled the character by using the grenade XP glitch, not killing stuff with grenades... 
---
That clears it up, thanks!!
---
I know how it works. OP said to have an addition on the map in game to tell you how many caps that vendor still has left, so you’re not wasting caps and time traveling to it just to find out it hasn’t refreshed yet. 
---
Thanks so much! Great info 🙂
---
I think I got a "kill huge creature" reward for just killing a level 20 Vertibot for the Ash Heap event Fly Swatter.  Was kind of surprised that counted.
---
K
---
&gt; Well there's this weird backlash that post history is somehow private information and going through it is somehow an invasion of privacy.
---
It's not that at all, people try to dig through people's post history to discredit their words. Obviously, if there are direct pieces of evidence countering what they say that makes sense, but often it's "you said this completely not relevant thing, or post on this sub I don't like, therefore what you're saying isn't correct". I think digging through people's post history is cringy, regardless of circumstance. 
---
Can't wait to see what kind of trash juice head puts out today.
---
The quote above is pulled directly from their patch notes, verbatim.  It's not a paraphrase or anything.  
---
The springs requirements were 10/12/14 for levels 25/35/45 respectively for Excavator Armor Legs (per leg) crafting with no Power Smith perk addition, and 7/8/9 for 25/35/45 with Power Smith, pre-Pach 6.    
---
I just double-checked to be sure it wasn't just taking a while for updates to change on the servers or something, and the requirements are still the same.  Unless I missed something, they forgot to implement the changes.
---
I believe it was five different creatures needed. Go to the challenge and you should be able to press whatever your activate button is and it’ll give a list. 
---
Works for me
---
You said the materials needed to craft the ammo (stable flux) decays
---
He stated multiple times he ran bandolier but still saw the weight meaning he was holding  most likely 100k+ ammo as even at that point it's only 10 pounds(even less with 1 ammo weight reduction legendary) so hundreds(600 ish)of flux worth of ammo at one time. Meaning it wasn't a slow accumulation he suddenly got far more ammo than intended.
---
Also power armour is worse at managing weight due to lack of legendary effects
---
I honestly don't think every item should be on that list, but an item that takes a lot of prep or rare materials like stable flux should be. But the argument that nuka cola shouldn't be is rather stupid when people had billions of it and used it as caps in purchases and to buy rare things they didn't earn(like power armour modsand plans and serum plans)
---
I can't wait to see what this update breaks
---
Did you complete the weekly challenge which started today with that?
---
Aaarg take it off my hand, it burns.
---
https://i.imgur.com/HUP0q9c.jpg
---
I think that's called grey pipboy. I accdentally brought it a week ago. I have one mod, the perk swapping mod, so not really considering it likely to be causing that.
---
Also I just saw a player using PA, to entirely glow in that same shade of pink.
---
To be a considered a "senior level" developer or software engineer in today's market requires at least 8-10 years of professional software experience.  I have 20 years professional experience, and about 15 years of non-professional experience (I started programming computers at the age of 10, back in the TRS-80 and Apple II+ days....the late 1970's.)
---
This is actually one of the worst gaming subs I know, right after that other Fallout. 
---
I like the game, I have met nice people in the game, and it does not deserve a sub like this.
---
Be careful, we got snitches in here trying to get people banned for sharing codes.
---
Sorry about that, I thought you were someone else.
---
Psst.. Come over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
No, they didn't say that at all. They said they played a character and used grenades as their main attack. Whatever YOU assume is on you, not them.
---
yep
---
&gt; stable flux to need an alt to store it? 
---
1lb each.
---
Thanks, that solved it! I also linked this thread to the creator of the Perk Loadout Manager so he can fix this in his example custom.ini.
---
Word. I will check it out!
---
armor*
---
Check all the piles, yesterday it was like the game was consolidating in the nuke zone.  Pulled several legendary items off normal mobs.
---
uh... yes, you replace those square brackets with the name of the mods that you use.
---
Have you not used mods before? Make sure to read the mod description pages for all mods you use, read their pinned comments as well.
---
Hold on. They count 5mm ammo? Please I wanna test now. I have 10k. So if I do 20 trades of it between an alt and back will I get banned. If I do then you have a case. If not well...
---
How are you level 467 and the SBQ is still alive after 24 minutes?  She got bored brah
---
Bloodied was nerfed by 50% roughly.  Was that intentional or an accident?
---
Like a said he had video evidence and showed me pics. It's spawn rate must be so low. He had it before the developer room even in the beta aparently.  I didn't beleive it either. But he did have some evidence. Maybe not maybe so. When it comes to pc I don't make it a fact u till I deffinetly see it on a Console. 
---
Did you read the post 
---
Show the emails that show the output of a potentially faulty tool?  Or show the numbers that indict them, but try to explain just how such numbers could be done legitimately in-game?
---
If they’re shooting your house, then they’re probably gonna shoot you if you come for them 
---
They only sometimes drop good stuff during events other then that it’s crap drops
---
Thanks for taking one for the team.  If you hadn’t, then we be still be paying the high spring cost.  o7
---
Yes you can, regular stuff but not atoms And yes they can store it if they move camps, I even have the Red Rocket Rocket which I don't own, when it was allowed someone placed it at my camp and have been able to keep it.
---
As far as I know, if they try store it, it it will revert or disappear, but if they move camps, it automatically gets stored and can be placed again. But yes you can built items if they don't have the plan.
---
Use their support site and submit a ticket.

The spinning wheel works with the barn quilts, and the crochet and tatted doilies in the game (I checked, there’s both!)
---
I wish we could make barn quilts to decorate our CAMPS. We could colour code them too. 
---
Almost guarantee you it's about the bloody bug with adrenal reaction which the players in my trade discord are saying doesn't exist. I got bitched out for fear mongering lol. I'm at work and unable to test, when I get home I'll post about it this evening one way or the other
---
Same, thanks for this post.
---
Haha I wouldnt, that shit would go on speaker phone while we all laughed at the customer on mute
---
Okay, and? You're basically bragging that you're still playing a game we've both been bored with for long over a month? He's pissed off out of principal, not because he can't play the game. I've gotten on for less than an hour, maybe two in the last month.. trust me, no one cares what you're doing. You're bragging about doing stuff I was bored doing in the first month the game came out.
---
For me and by friends it wasn't about playing the game towards the end, it was us basically hanging out and rebuilding our bases, and maybe helping out a friend of a friend that was new.
---
The simplest reason I can say his ban is total bullshit? None of us really played the game in the last 30 days, not really. Haven't bought or sold a single thing on the market, haven't gotten new weapons or armor, don't have a single goal left.. what reason is there to cheat when literally it's been closer to two months that all of us have every single thing we could possibly want?
---
The **only person** I know of that gets on daily is a friend of a friend that is a duper, and he gets on trying to sell the shit he has for real money. I don't like the guy, he's super annoying, and he goes against everything I enjoyed about the game.
---
What pisses me off is that he's not banned even though I know him and his friends have duplicated nonstop from the beginning, yet my friend that barely gets on at all, doesn't really play and only socializes gets banned? 🤔
---
Yeah, it's a fucking joke dude. So you have fun. You've had nothing productive to say so I'm going to go ahead and block you, so know if you reply I'll get no notification and you're simply wasting your time.
---
I bought immediately the PA skin but but I'm undecided whether to buy mothman statue. Do anyone know how it works exactly? When it disappear and when it reappear? 
---
Just to be absolutely clear: are you talking about \*this\* week's weekly "Kill \*a\* Huge Creature" challenge?  I am \*not\* referring to the general combat challenge or any previous week's challenges.
---
If developers did it they could easily shut it down by not allowing anyone to place items in random containers... there is literally no quest that has a player put stuff into a random lunch box, suitcase or garbage can (or whatever else). 
---
My point is they could have shut it down a long time ago but didn’t. 
---
They could have also made a limit from the start on how much a player could weigh. 
---
People joked about weighing a million pounds literally... imagine if they capped it to what they did recently from the start? 
---
So doing these things literally created work for themselves at the cost of other players. Look at all the time and effort has gone into all of it... crazy. 
---
I do get what you’re saying and agree but why create something then leak it or let it happen in the first place? 
---
What’s developers moral compass? 
---
How's it going?
---
Upvote for getting Erasure in my head.
---
We've been reading it wrong this whole time. It's actually displaying miss chance. 
---
Emergency Services Building upstairs I believe
---
thats the "missing texture" in fo games, like the black and pink checkerboard from source. known bug with atom shop textures, expect a hotfix.
---
Listen to this jealous scrub
---
Or take their atoms instead if they had some maybe
---
I'm still at work 😭. I will be checking out all of that asap. Absolutely buying the power armor skin. Billboards look promising too. 
---
Thx
---
No mans sky is a great game now, but its reputation still hasn't (and probably won't) ever recover.
---
Sure, but the whole point about it possibly being inflated by mule account use is that people are assuming they are only counting *acquired* stuff, ignoring whether or not it was ever consumed. So if you trade 15,000 ammo to your mule and then back then it counts as 30,000, regardless of whether you then burn through all 15,000 actual ammo. If anything, the *main* account should have the higher amount of ammo acquired *because* you don't put spent or used ammo on a mule account.
---
So each time he wanted to trade ammo to him mule it would count as the mule acquiring 15,000 ammo. Then when he traded it back it would count as his main account gaining it. 
---
As to the other ammo types. The [email](https://imgur.com/a/Ka3rMHz) says his main account has acquired 140,960 ultracite ammo and his *secondary* account exploited 150,825 .45 ammo, 225,111 Ultracite ammo, 72,809 5mm Ammo, and 55,949 5.56 ammo. It doesn't list any of those for the primary account. It's possible they just didn't bother to include it, only listing the most egregious issue for the primary account, but if that was the case then why would they bother to list them for the secondary account?
---
What tag do i use? Account, login information, etc?
---
It's not a bug with atom shop textures; the fault lies with an installed mod.
---
Except it wouldn't, especially if he has two accounts as he claims. If both accounts have all five character slots filled, it would take considerably less time.
---
i'm fairly certain AI was tweaked and sneak is no longer shrinking enemy AI detection for sound.
---
I can still clear West-Tek one shotting everything, but If i do a 10mm pistol run there are a couple of Super Mutants outside of LOS that could hear 20+ silenced gunshots and will go aggro and put me in \[DANGER\]. Previous to the patch, I could do western revolver runs through West-Tek and it was only dicey in a couple of rooms, now i can barely fire a single wester revolver shot without being detected by every Super Mutant outside of LOS.

*Stable* flux?
---
**Inert** flux weighs a pound each - I doubt you've crafted stable.  A casual player can't amass the crafting components necessary to craft hundreds of stable.

thx. really good to know.

DC is indeed rare, now crash to dash is every couple hours.

\*a month ago...

Be patient damn...

Adrenal reaction.
---
&gt; I remember the same thing happened on r/heroesofthestorm.   
---
I remember the same for the last 20 years. No matter the game, after every banwave forums are spammed by the golden, pure innocents that got caught in crossfire or framed by friend/brother or whatever.

Sick &amp; tired of these new bugs with every muthafukin patch by these muthafukin devs IN THIS MUTHAFUKIN GAME 👴🏿

It your archive list for your mods. Needs to be updated.

---
All hail his glowy light and buzzy sound.
---
This. 
---
BOOOOOOOOOO
---
That would be because you don't farm SBQ enough, considering you need almost 1K ammunition for one of them if you have an high ROF weapon (400 SBQ in a month doesn't seem farfetched for me at all honestly, if you get all three silos and then switch servers). 
---
Stop duping or hoarding shit over 100k+ 
---
This is good info..thx
---
Listen I'm just glad they added toilet paper to the game
---
You're welcome! Glad I could help a fellow internet stranger. BTW, I have the same issue that you do with the Overseer's quest line. No nifty workaround that I'm aware of, unfortunately.
---
HAAH
---
Did you receive an email saying you were banned? If you did Bethesda Customer Assistance via Twitter says to reply to email. 
---
If you Submit a ticket, expect to wait indefinitely. People who submitted tickets on Saturday still haven’t been looked at. 
---
By the way the email address they say to reply to is “no_reply@....” address so I doubt anyone looks at or will answer them since it’s a computer generated email not specific to you personally. 
---
Oh we are in a new week my bad. But does it have a list of applicable creatures?
---
Show the emails that say they are suspended. It's easy to understand.
---
hahahaha yea buddy, I sure am! I have a friend that will be contacting you soon for a serum setup.
---
It would be cool if they included a paint job that matches the one on the [magazine cover.](https://cdn2-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/20181109003537_1-e1542054752231.jpg)
---
F-yeah, we need excavator ink.
---
Get back to me when it's the Flatwoods Monster or Wendigo week.
---
Mothmans neat and all, but I like some of the other cryptids more.
---
dude u need your camp in a hidden location
---
Thank you everyone. Your answers have made Fallout 76 a better experience.
---
I dropped 200 pounds of stuff in the blue suitcase at Watoga &amp; hung about to watch what happened. A couple of players didn't check the suitcase &amp; I got nervous all my loot would go to waste. So I took it all &amp; dropped it in on the vendor's counter in a baggie, to be super obvious.
---
The next player in went to the vendor, took the bag of dropped loot, took what they wanted &amp; then put the rest + some of their stuff into the blue suitcase. Great success as I got some plans I didn't have.
---
Since then I've been using the blue suitcase regularly. It's definitely made the game more satisfying to play as the inventory management was doing my head in.
---
Yesterday I started a new character &amp; was setting up camp at level 5 when a couple of high (90+, 100+) level players approached me. After reading the stories on here about high level players helping noobs I waited in anticipation for the generous loot drop. Instead one of them ran up, hit me &amp; waited for me to retaliate so they could kill me - which I didn't fall for.
---
Takes all sorts I suppose.
---
This week's challenge does NOT say (x/5) to complete.  Plus, to clarify, I have killed three \*dfferent\* huge creatures, each of which is on the list you mentioned, and none of them are getting marked as completed.
---
Have you completed this February 19th weekly challenge already today? Or, alternately, have you found the February 19th weekly "Kill a Huge Creature" challenge to not be working for you?
---
Yep hunters long coat, civil war era top hat and welding goggles... was going for a steam punk kinda look
---
So wait, what kind of actions are considered contesting a workshop? like if i just stroll through am i considered contesting it...what if i want to help defend the workshop?
---
No.  Also you missed the point of the thread entirely.
---
May his wise eyes gaze upon you in times of need.
---
Is your camp located at whitesprings or charleston station bridge?
---
what else is new in the atom shop?
---
Flatsey week should be awesome. Alien style things. 
---
Trolls are leaking in from r/all because that lying duper made it to the front page. Trolling this game has become a sport I wouldn't take any of these posts seriously. 
---
The best course IMO would be if player vending machines all looked at the same "pool". Like players would stock their vending machines with what they want to sell, and then when you looked at any vending machine you'd see the stock from all the other players in the server. Would mean it's easier to find other players' stock and find buyers for your own.
---
Trying to leverage player vending to make CAMPs more centralized seems like a good way to get "could not place your CAMP" messages every time you join a world. Plus I like having them in a wider variety of locations.
---
When it's destroyed it performs it's special fade animation.
---
The Red Rocket Station decoration did a similar thing where the Rocket would actually blast off when destroyed.
---
Suspicious.
---
I played hardcore, soloing the queen and the like 20+ times a day at points  but to get just the 2k of one flux that would be needed would be absurd not to mention the like 30k lead or 30k steel 
---
Also if he relied on the queen alone  it would of taken him about days of no sleep and only 10min silo runs and 1 min queen kills 
---
True! our crew named it the Quartershot aswell haha
---
That would be awesome.  I have one I could submit of myself next to the mothman statute in Point Pleasant. I feel a roadtrip coming on lol
---
Thx!! i got all of those!!..i need to wear my civil war era suit more often
---
Listen to what you're saying and how you are saying it.
---
"They are farming.  They are intentionally server hopping to do things that give them advantages."
---
Quit using the company as a scapegoat for poor decisions.  It is not the company's fault.  It is the player's fault.  They know to not engage in that behavior and they did it anyways.
---
NO SYMPATHY WILL BE GIVEN.
---
Yep, sadly Adventure mode is not going to fix this. Sure they'll have a PVP area for all that want that, but the jerks are going to still come around here a pick fights. Slap damage! What a joke! They need to just kill off PVP in Adventure and if anything, only allow it under workshops for contesting. Once your out of the Workshop area, all the damage stops.
---
They don't lose their bounties in full until they get killed in PVP
---
A better explanation: they're out of content. So your base became their content for the evening.
---
lol wth u talking about. I have been sniping chameleon since release buddy.
---
anyways. cool stuff bro. My build is completly catered for my build and gear. I didn't source any of it.
---
Mothman bed, Mothman baseball cap, Mothman poster, Mothman PA skin and lamp, Mothman billboard, Mothman statue 
---
3\*\*\* Legendary Dysentary
---
Literally the only reason I had martial artist rank 3 was for my gatling gun.
---
Granted I do have the speedy reciever and the increase fire rate legendary modifier on it, but I just dont get the logic behind fixing that 'bug'
---
Been away from the game since a couple weeks after launch, other than Bug fixes has there been any content added?
---
Its no challenge its boring. Encrypting is tedious and very complicated. This is by no means an exploit, these are people figuring out the riddle and finding all pieces. That takes a lot of effort and dedication.
---
Comparing encrypting nuke codes to people duping Nuka Colas makes zero sense.
---
Did you ever launch a nuke and encrypting it yourself on the spot? I doubt that. 
---
Don't cheat, and you won't have to worry about it. Simple as that.
---
I feel a road trip coming soon. 
---
I think it's done to get around the thing where people simply have a network of interlocking guns pointed at the workshop bench.
---
The moment you go to take it they open fire.
---
Meat, just meat?
---
So only when is destroyed... I would have loved a statue that disappear and reappear without any warning... Like mothman. I think I will pass thanks for the information 
---
Would you be interested in a quad explosive radium?
---
I will say I had a similar experience during the first round of server updates. 
---
I was at Grafton station and out of nowhere 2 lev 100+ and a level 90 pop out of nowhere and sit there and spam attacks until I die. (pacifist mode was on)  after which they ate my corpse. Not sure what the thrill was there but they tracked me across the map for no reason until the sever went down.
---
I totally agree!!
---
❤️
---
[I want my 2 dollars !](https://youtu.be/iayLBI7nsE0) 
---
Can confirm we're aware of this one and actively working to address it. I know this is frustrating when it occurs, and while I don't have a date to share for a fix, we are working on tracking it down.
---
Good. Fuck them.
---
im selling a set u rodent. check my history.
---
The same thing is happening for me. I had rad worms before the patch. I have marsupial, electrically charged, speed demon and carnivore and they all have their positive effects
---
How about a Laser Turret reskin in the atom shop that uses the "Alien Turret" model from Nuka-World? Or a model change in the Atom Shop that makes the Alien Blaster look like it's Fallout 3/New Vegas counterpart? Or a big doofy mask of a Zetan Head you can wear with the Spacesuit?
---
Just downvote this clown and move on. He got banned for cheating and is now trying to spread negativity cuz he's salty.
---
Get fucked pal.
---
Hit 600 hours last night.
---
That somewhat helped. My PA isn't pink anymore, but I still don't have a floor in my player home (it's an atom shop floor). Any ideas?
---
Any excuse to blame Bethesda for something.
---
People make up so much BS about the game and them that most people forget the real reasons to be annoyed.
---
cuz balance is a myth.
---
No bug zapper? 
---
This may be unpopular… but I don’t give a fuck about whoever gets banned. Y’all clearly did something wrong. A bunch of them just want some pity and won’t admit the shady shit they did.
---
I hadn't ever done this, but now I'm wishing I would have...
---
Corporations, suits, etc. they have all this stuff like projections, charts, etc. and they care about money. If everybody is all oh we love the game. Everything is great., Thank you so much. They will keep shovelling crap. They will keep rushing out unfinished products. Is that what you want?
---
It has a list.  I have killed three different creatures on that list.  None of them are showing as having been killed.  And the quest, which states "Kill \*A\* Huge Creature" and does not have a (#/5) is not completing.   
---
I really like using the stand fast chest piece, I got it at level 50, and have had it since. I'm now level 92 or so. 
---
Fuck innocent traders who just happened to have 100k ammo from trading? Sounds like a good way to make sure the game dies...
---
Those Level 20 Legendary Drills are perfect for this, very fast but controllable damage to CAMP objects.
---
Head lamps are totally worth it!  How else can you alert everything and everyone to your position while not being able to see anything do to the glare?
---
No. It still makes you a jackass if you attack someone who clearly has set themselves as not wanting to do PvP. If it were *only* a PvP game there wouldn't be a passive setting, or rules trying to discourage griefers. 
---
I have as much of a right to enjoy the game without being griefed as you do. 
---
Thank you again for the insights into the decision making process...it helps us to understand.
---
It simply doesn't work, the "blueprint budget" won't increase and the structure isn't highlighted.
---
If your camp is located anywhere near Whitesprings, specifically the golf club/course, or next to the Charleston train station, then your location is why your camp got attacked by different people. It's not cool to be near either of those places, cause one had a rare spawn for the vendor bot and the other is in a popular farm and nuke zone
---
TIL
---
Wouldn't having one dedicated PvP server limit the number of servers for people to place their Camps?  There'd be more competition on the PvP server for the same Camping spot, wouldn't there?
---
We will forever be in beta, either drop the game or suck it up like the rest of these suck ups or wait till the hotfix/patch.
---
I usually come on here to look at any bugs people are venting b4 playing, and looks like I won’t be playing b/c BUGTHESDAAA
---
Looks like we found someone who got banned for duping here, with as hard as you're white-knighting the obvious cheater.
---
It really doesn't take a rocket scientist or even a modest about of emotional development to understand this. 
---
Could you determine if they were raiders? Were they in power armor? Maybe your CAMP rests on a location where they typically CAMP, and they were forcing you to leave. 
---
Praise Atom
---
Nah fam you got owned.
---
We should examine this issue further and let the chips fall where they may. As this exploit is rampant.
---
Nah, you got owned.
---
I’ve thought about that too, but I actually use my favorites for gameplay (and to quickly reequip my power armor that seems to unequip with regularity).  
---
Also if you crouch in your camp, people won't see you on the map and where your camp is located. As soon as anyone comes near your camp, logout, unfortunately because of people like this, we  need to do this.
---
I think that's the medical building I checked out. It makes sense that there should be one. I may have overlooked it. 
---
Everybody is innocent in here...don't you know that?

- Andrew Dufresne
---
And do what? There’s a cap on caps. Not like you’re going to just bank it all. Unless he only plays 76 as a trader and nothing else. It’s an insane amount of shit. He’s a duper and he duped you all too. 
---
Ultracite needs love too,
---
Like the twat in flatwoods yesterday who was repeatedly trying to punch the vendorbot. Then he starts hurling grenades towards me. Well guess what asshole, with my dense armour and fireproof maxed out grenades are like mosquitos. I hope you liked it when I one shot you with my anti armour dragon. And I sold all your junk for like 500 caps.....
---
And everyone the police arrest must have done *something* wrong.
---
Username checks out, indeed.
---
How is this different from the marketplace? 
---
I'll go ahead and ask the question everyone is wanting to know.  Can and will anyone be "banned" for selling items that are probably duped?
---
I love the empty square idea!!
---
Bethesda!   THIS!  DO THIS!!
---
He states that he got banned for passing to much ammo back inforth between his main and second account. That still means his main which got banned with only 140k ultracite and no other ammo would have had other ammo since he passed it around. 
---
"I got banned for having too much ammo.
---
I don't think I've once held more than 36,000 ammo at one time. 36,000 being a very specific number I am stating as that was the rough amount of 5mm ammo I had collected. To further describe my recent play time. I started leveling a second character for the first time. To do that I transferred over several thousand ammo and some armor/guns for various levels to use. Being that my main has stupid amount of play time I have a ton of ultracite ammo. 50x stable flux is easily attainable in an hour. Combine ammosmith and super duper perk cards, and you can craft huge amounts of ammo at once. In addition ultracite ammo crafts more ammo by default than regular ammo. So with the above perks you get even further bonuses." To get all the ammo/gear from 1 character to another I had to move it to my second account to then shift it over to my main account on the second character." He would have still had his main account tagged with how much ammo he had picked up or passed over according to what you are saying if it was truly the way you describe because with the amount of stuff he passed over to that account is a lot. Not to mention this all happened in just 1 month. I also find it hard to belive that in just one time he has only had 36k worth of ammo especially if he crafted 645.654 in one month like the email said between two accounts where he states he started ranking up his other account.   Not to mention the lie he told which was that he was banned in the duping wave when it turned out he got banned before that ban wave even happened yet he tried to make it seem like he was banned during the ban wave for duping. 
---
Lol.  You've been on the forums trying to buy a bloodied explosive shotgun.  Hypocrite or tool bag?  Maybe both?
---
Calling someone fucking dumb is abusive. Moaning about your $60 is precious.
---
Your comments just prove my point about toxic people on here.
---
Well, I have been on the markets for a few months and I've created it in what I feel the majority of people want. Think of it as the good neighbor of sub Reddits on here (that's a really bad metaphor but you get what I mean)
---
Why, there's already a few places like this. You're wasting our time here.
---
Just meat.  I like roving the map from trader to trader with butcher's bounty and thru hiker.  I have so much meat.  Sometimes I clear out all of the traders and I still have a bunch of meat!  I'd like to see it go to a good stomach and not just rot into fertilizer.
---
This isn’t a bug but actually a test to see how many people would be affected by this stealth  nerf.
---
They don’t want to make the same mistake with TES nerf that killed half its player base.
---
I mean, he could 
---
-buy better guns
---
-collect plans
---
-buy shells
---
-buy rare items
---
I'm not saying he isn't a duper at this point, but I do think it's wrong to say you can't do anything with a massive surplus of caps.
---
Potentially 
---
Maybe, it's worth a try though
---
I just listened to a great episode of 99% Invisible about the Interrobang. I highly recommend it.
---
https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/interrobang/
---
Too many items in a 30 day period...that's...insanely dumb. Any items?!?! I farm junk...not special junk..just like steel and aluminum..
---
Same on PC.
---
I don’t think public flogging is out of the question either......
---
Good on ya! The bazaar is already great but it never hurts to have competition! Looking forward to using this!
---
He sent a message on ps4. not in-game. I should made that more clear. My bad.
---
See, that's different because there was zero setup to it at all, you equipped a perk and mashed a button and got a ton of grenades to sell.. it isn't efficient by far, the same people could get 2 levels in 5 minutes doing a nuke at whitespring.. but that's how they chose to waste their time.
---
I did actually try that by the way, I think I was probably 128 or so at the time- sat there pressing x or square or whatever for 10 minutes and probably got less than 10% xp. 
---
Then the sons of Dane event popped up called one violent night. A friend and I did it, finished in less than 10 minutes, and I got 2 and 1/2 levels out of it.
---
So this is a great example of my point, people that don't know about some of the simplest features and mechanics in this game will resort to cheating, while I did an event that was 25x more efficient for leveling and is guaranteed to have at least one legendary mob, but usually has 2-4, and even more before they nerfed all events.
---
So yeah, for people that actually know how to play the game is presents no challenge whatsoever, so there's 0 reason to cheat, especially when playing the game as intended is far more efficient.
---
As somebody who has been ignoring the persistent trash talking of this game and eagerly awaiting improvements before purchasing - thank you for these consistent updates, improvements, bug fixes, and *acknowledgement* of the issues yet to be addressed. It is very reassuring as somebody looking to get into the game to see the developers so in-tune with players. 
---
I love the whole 900 Hour Guy story.
---
Only the Interwebs can come up with a drama like this.
---
Brilliant.
---
Yup on the game it said what time and day
---
Is today the update that we can play again?
---
Sure.  I think this is a separate but related feature that is a must. Although you may want to just lock some things (though I equipped) so they aren’t accidentally dropped or scrapped.  Actually indicating what is equipped would be ideal if you ask me. 
---
I always collect flux in a nuke zone because after going through the hassle of launching it I usually want more profit than the items the queen drops, again that’s just my play style..
---
I usually walk away with 120 raw flux which using the chemist and super duper perks can easily be turned into 15-18 stable flux. Taking the low end of that spectrum.. 15 flux per nuke * 5nukes per day= 75 flux a day *30days= 2250 flux.
---
Each flux is equivalent to 120 .50 cal ultracite ammo, again with the super duper and ammo smith perks you can reasonably assume an average of 170 bullets per flux= 382,500 ultracite ammo without very much effort at all.
---
Again that’s with 5 nukes a day on the queen, if you nuke whitesprings you can gather at least 2x that amount of flux.. Again people need to think about the role playing mechanics of this game a little better imo.. we were supposed to rebuild Appalachia and some people took that to heart and wanted to have a profession.. some people are traders, crafters, raiders, farmers, paladins. 
---
If I’m a crafter or trader then I’m gonna have way more ammo and other things than most players because with the right perks all that stuff is weightless so why not be efficient with your time in the wasteland and convert all the raw materials you gather into profitable items.
---
I just find it a little infuriating that BGS slogan “rebuild Appalachia” doesn’t mean anything because even when we try to make it work people get banned for hoarding items in a post nuclear wasteland smh.
---
Anyways sorry for the wall of text hopefully that sheds some light on the ease at which this can be done.
---
Excited about more Stash Space but i also hope they fix Bulk being broken down when you "Scrap All". i usually have a ton of Bulk on my Character waiting to sell after shops refresh.
---
Interesting quality of life suggestion, I'll note this for discussion. Thank you!
---
Update: the serum removes the negative effect and hides the entire effect in your pipboy until the serum wears off and you regain the negative hp.
---
Weird, and that sucks.
---
900 hours? On Fallout 76?
---
Thank you for the support :)
---
WTH does that answer mean?  Whats the point of creating something we already have in the bazaar and market?
---
Turn ya lights on

Already nerfed the guns. Only prudent they match the melee
---
What? How did I get "owned"? You realize I'm not banned nor have a dog in this fight right? I'm just pointing out that these people are misreading what the email says. LOL
---
K bye.
---
This explains a lot of what’s happening
---
Mate, I created this sub Reddit 3 hours ago. It shall be different but I haven't decided exactly how it will go
---
&gt;	• If you deploy a mine and then pick it back up, it appears in your inventory as a separate item from the main stack of mines, each individual mine will appear as its own stack after pick up
---
True of throwing knives as well. Also, occasionally throwing knives cannot be selected after switching to another throwable. Dropping them all and picking them up again fixes this. 
---
👍👍👍👍
---
Ah, thanks, I'll look into that. Shame I got only that one mod that doesn't even change any visual thing.
---
Nope, not banned at all. Just not as dumb as a box of rocks and actually can read what the email states and understand what is going on unlike you. LOL
---
Call me when you find one, because what you're referring to doesn't exist. They're all dupers. Given how insanely hard you're white knighting them though, I'm sure you're one too.
---
Thanks for looking into this, I'll be looking into playing other games from now on since this will likely be broken for nearly a month, just like rad worms.
---
I've stuck with this game for way longer than I should have. I may not have pre-ordered or played at launch, but I picked the game up during black friday and despite the game's multitude of issues, I believed that you (and please don't take this personally - I mean "you" as in Bethesda the company. You're just doing your job and I mean you no ill will personally) would step up to the plate and make the game really shine. Because I saw a lot of potential in this game and I wanted so hard to believe that it could be good.
---
But patch after patch it's the same story. Fix one thing, break 10 other things. Dupers run rampant throughout the game and when you finally take action not only do you leave most of the duped content in the game, but you also ban a lot of innocent players in the crossfire. [Dev rooms are still accessible](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asde5w/patch_broke_adrenal_reactionbloodied_weapons/) and are actively being exploited to this day. You promised hotfixes for Patch 5 but only delivered one, and you left rad worms broken for over 3 weeks. Legendary enemies are still not dropping legendary loot, or are dropping syringers or drills. I sent you a dozen bug reports through your official channels, one of which EXPLICITLY mentioned that syringers and drills both also suffer from the same problem that flare guns did, and you ignored me. The grind for plans is now even more obscene than before with how expensive they are. The scorchbeast queen is the only real end-game boss and her loot is pathetic, I get way better loot from farming non-nuked Whitespring and events like Uranium Fever than an entire day of Queen kills. And now my high-risk high-reward build is broken because of an oversight and likely isn't going to get fixed for a month because of the slow patch cycle.
---
I'm sorry but I can no longer defend you or this game. I haven't played the game in a week and it feels LIBERATING. Going back to Fallout 4 or even Fallout 3 feels way more rewarding and fun than the abysmal state of this game. Why? Because they weren't designed with this ridiculous "live service" grinding mentality. I could have fixed Rad Worms in 30 seconds if I'd had the ability and freedom to edit the game as I please, just as we have in prior entries in this game. But that's not how Fallout 76 is designed. It's a sham. A shadow of what it could have been, thanks to the higher-ups demanding a cash shop, demanding to jump on the "live service" bandwagon, demanding a piece of Fortnite's pie. And you're not getting that from me. Not anymore.
---
It was fun while it lasted, but I just can't keep living this lie you've been selling me. I've uninstalled the game and I'm not looking back.
---
Bethesda, I hope you learn a lesson from this game. Don't do this to TES6 and Starfield. Because we're not going to stand for this type of treatment anymore.
---
I never called anyone fucking dumb, I asked if someone was fucking dumb for asking a fucking dumb question, and that's rude at best...  and are you suggesting I shouldn't be upset a game that wasn't tested and released in an incredibly buggy state costs $60?
---
And play styles change. Getting an axe to do 30,000 damage isn't fun. So yes it needs a Nerf
---
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
We should feel bad because you cheated, got caught and banned, but you enjoyed the game so now Bethesda is out of luck?
---
Yea, that makes perfect sense....SMH
---
People don't have 60 seconds. If they even think the issue might take more than 5 seconds to resolve, it's absolutely got to go to the highest level possible 100% of the time. You know, people like to think that their lives are the busiest and most hectic.
---
This post doesn't include it, but it also by no means excludes it...  
---
I almost never launch nukes and just farm the Violet comps by server hopping, usually do something like that when I'm low on materials and bored, so it's not something I'd go into detail myself otherwise, just mentioning it's doable.
---
Found a ts dragon for sale in watoga. Got maybe three explosive drops from white springs. 10mm, combat rifle, broadsider. 400 hours played.
---
I was thinking low level combat knives would work really well, or Mr. Handy buzz saws(same concept as the drills)
---
I don't really know what your problem is
---
But that's just a theory...
---
#***A GAME THEORY.***
---
Thanks for watching!
---
I'm always a really big fan of when people post on the League of Legends reddit how "I'm a saint, I would never do anything bad, automated system broke" and then a Riot employee comes around and says "You fed in 20 games, told people to kill themselves, and taught our staff 4 new racial slurs. You're staying banned"
---
Tbf the trade bug was people forcing a trade that the other person reflexively approved of without realizing what they did.  So instead of saying, “I was tricked, but it was my fault”, folks went ahead and claimed it was stolen from them.  
---
Just the ability to force a trade screen onto someone pissed me off.  
---
If you want I created a [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascizj/resident_west_virginian_here_this_is_probably_the/?st=JSC63R6Z&amp;sh=06464bd7)  of a great road trip that would hit all the key locations in the game and also some extra locations that make West Virginia great
---
I've been experiencing this with potted plants and the fireplace from the Atomic Shop.
---
Quality Shitpost
---
Ok.  That would be no.
---
900 hour guy is innocent if you were intelligent enough to understand the wording of the email, but you've already demonstrated that you are an idiot that doesn't understand english. So it isn't a surprise that you'd not get it.
---
There has been no changes in mod policy, so no.
---
This happens from time to time, so might not be because of a change, will be interesting to see what other players says later today :)
---
How was the loot ? did you get a nice Ultracite PA mod ? not the vent and the knuckles i hope , lol
---
Yup, thats how I had lost 17 of them I had collected before I got the quest
---
So, the bulk scrapping bug HASN’T been fixed? I guess we’ve only known about it since two seconds after the last hotfix...
---
Gotta have a business strategy and vision first man. 
---
Yup....sadly fixing all the problems which should be done first (should have been done pre release) is at the cost of no additional end game content, adding content after everyone has left wont do anything to get those players back sadly.
---
ROFL, so you literally can only repeat that. Why is that not surprising that an idiot would have to resort to just trying to rely on insults instead of arguing their point. Oh right, because you don't have one.
---
Yes / no...  
---
There are a couple spots were you can get a large quantity quickly once a day for free, I stopped farming those spots daily once I hit like 6 or 7 thousand Ultracite.  
---
I'm a melee build, so don't need to make ammo, except when I want a change of pace, so if someone made that part of their daily grind (takes about 5 minutes) you could net I think 60 between 2 characters in about 10 minutes.
---
I would not say that this is a "completely unrelated" place...
---
I disagree with you, they should be banned here too. This is the official Fallout 76 Subreddit. 
---
Sorry, but banning people based on some math and numbers aint right. Its not like crafting ammo is only way to obtain it. Yes if crafting was only way to gain ammo, then yes you could do the math. 
---
One Streamer proved how WoW is banning people for no reason. In stream he told everyone to report him for X reason, next minute he was banned for X days. Point he tried to make is that when guild wanted to bann you, they had to make false reports. This showed that Blizz banning people like that was flawed. Similar way could be done here. You tell fans to go and collect Ultracite ammo, one who donates most in 30 days to me, will get 1st place. Obviously F76 have no playerbase, but that doesn't matter. Point is that you can't just do math and say you can't craft that much ammo. Well yeah I can't craft, but that doesn't mean I can't buy them from player or get them from other players.
---
They stealth nerfed plenty of player’s damage, might be why spawns were increasing b/c nobody able to kill em
---
Jesus Christ. A liar as well.
---
Have any mods installed? Try disabling them.
---
I’ve found out that they go to the second story because I use floors instead of roofs as the floor on the second story. The floors rest a little bit lower than the roofs and thus cause them to move to the second story, if I switch and use roofs instead, the power armor stations, pass through connecters, etc will be able to be placed as intended on the first floor. 
---
Same! This is a great fix! 
---
I actually have one. What unarmed weapons or rifles are you willing to trade for? 
---
THIS
---
You just said it, I get to enjoy the game to, which means all aspects which means I can PvP without people being whiny bitches about it.
---
Nice logic bud worked against ya here
---
Imagine exploiting the game and getting mad when you get banned lmao
---
Pm me bro I have a lot just lmk which you looking for 
---
This would be nice.  A lot of times I step out of my PA when I'm selling stuff just so I don't accidently sell off a piece of armor I'm wearing.
---
I always thought on this one. I mean we come out of the vault that underwear should be clean then.
---
It should get dirty on real use...
---
I accidentally sold my stand fast when I was selling all me crappy legendarys didn't realize at the time equipping pa removed my armour too 😥
---
Will they do a hotfix to get adrenal working again? Was really looking forward to playing today. 
---
Folks, a large relevel is coming from what has been put out officially... I'd rather have a thorough and complete balancing done once than multiple one off balancings that often cancel out each other. 
---
That title sounds... confusing.
---
If what you are trying to convey is that the Sentinel damage mitigation effect is deactivated while crouched then yes, you are correct.
---
I do, I didn't think this would happen all so quickly and I don't want to exclude people for reasons like that. I appreciate everyone's input though
---
Bye Felicia
---
yeah but at least they can't be here with their official reddit account and they'll be forced to make a new one. Making it much easier to spot someone with a very limited account presence on reddit. 
---
Not really. Finding yourself dead as soon as you log in the very first time (or more often before you can even take control) is not what you should expect. Being completely unable to ever log in because every death puts you right back at that spawn point to die again means you never play. That is not PvP. That is griefing.
---
Duping was one cause of server instability.
---
I keep meaning to check this podcast out. It sounds fascinating. 
---
Quality details!

We have several Excavator Power Armor paints in the works! I don't have release dates to share for them yet, but will let you know as soon as they're ready. :)

One of the things I like doing most is bangin' whores
---
Oh jeez. That sucks. I'm sorry, man. 
---
oh god console movement is awful.
---
Nice Patch
---
how am I a liar?  asking if one is dumb is not the same as calling one dumb.
---
That's apart of the whole ordeal, man. Just gotta keep stating what's going on, so it can keep being fixed. This digital age is a new one.
---
A large balance drop is coming... I'd rather have it done all at once instead of hodgepodge 
---
Obviously arguing with someone who doesn't understand or care to understand my point is futile, you can proceed to believe what the heck ever you want, doesn't make it true or false, but you should at least be open to outside views as you may find yourself further in life.
---
Considering it’s very easy to acquire a full set of T51b then sounds about right
---
Yes we just completed one, got a 3 star level chest piece, prime receiver plans, Ultrcite Armor plan, Ultrcite Mod plan, level 50 weapon and gear no legendary and two fusion cores.  Along with the normal stuff.
---
Its broken, they know.
---
Everyone quits every game at some point. We used to never care about "end game", now it's a requirement or out comes the pitch forks. Bethesda has no real financial incentive to keep high level players around anyway, there's no subscription here and any low level person can spend money in the atom shop.
---
Gonna make that Who'ur my wife
---
Still locked out. Still no response to ticket or Twitter. Still no email saying I'm banned. Nothing....absolutely nothing.
---
&gt; I looked back on my (long) gaming career and realized how quickly my interest in a game evaporated once I started cheating.
---
Definitely true, for most games. However, in FO4, making my carry weight unlimited certainly increase the enjoyability of the game for me. Inventory management is something that can make a game really annoying, and I am able to enjoy the story so much more if I can focus on that instead of shuffling inventory around just so I can move and fast travel. I'm DEFINITELY not for cheating in FO76. Doing it in a SP game vs doing it in a MP game are definitely not the same, but there could definitely be some improvements if there are still people that feel like they should cheat in order to get the most out of the game.
---
I like Ultracite PA set and All Rise weapon. Seems to be strong enough
---
Yup broke af. Ffs. 
---

---
Generally, as someone who raids, anyone over level 50 is fair game because that's when you should have your build finished or close to finished.  Anything past 50 doesn't add anything, in fact being high level makes raiding worse because you lose more caps.
---
Having a wanted level these days is so hard to get rid of, and I tend to run around whitesprings until someone kills me.  If he's anything like me, he probably would have appreciated it if you killed him.
---
If you need tips on how to deal with pvp I'd be glad to help.  There are ways around sentinel assassin for example.

When will team invites be fixed? Every time I send a friend a team invite they are unable to join. /u/BethesdaGameStudios_

Then why is he so butt hurt? Because he got spanked. Because he did not get his way. Whiney, entitled, elitist, garbage. I hope he gets ip banned
---
The method that crashed servers, yes.  But I didn't do that method.  Other servers handled the login process that the method exploited.  There's a lot of false info out there about what was going wrong initially, but people tell me now that things aren't much better today.
---
I found a two shot flamer yesterday! Not explosive but indeed a two shot
---
Thank you for giving Bethesda so much money. They're making the game *much* better for those of us who can still play!
---
thanks for the PSA!  just logged in and snagged it!

I approve of this idea. (Username extremely relevant)

Somewhat normal for that time of night, people with jobs go to sleep.

I kinda wish i had a PC because of the mods but i always scared of building one because i feel like i might screw it up

I had fun and I hope you still do.

Seems like duplication efforts, but good luck on your endeavors. 
---
Why after every patch does Bethesda have to issue a hotfix. WTF. Check the damn patch in the actual game before you post it. It’s amateur hour in Austin. 
---
Well I think it’s safe to say that since I had to manually select you comment because of all the down votes, you aren’t funny. If you were on stage you would’ve bombed. Would that be the audiences fault for not finding you funny, or yours for not being funny?
---
Still no one at bethesda has addressed this other than reactivation at next patch....which never happened. 
---
Good riddance.
---
I'm almost afraid to say that I have those bullets when I'm in power armor.
---
He isn't being whiny, also you do realize he isn't even perm banned, the email says he will get it back after next patch. LOL

You really are shitty at reading comprehension, no wonder you fail to understand how innocent people can be wrongly banned by an algorithm. LOL

Screws aren’t even that hard to get once you get going. Your friends are lazy and probably a bit slow in the head. You aren’t some underground hero of the game. You made a choice and got what you deserved for it. I know you aren’t upset, you actually sound kind of smug about it all. It’s good you will be gone, but if you don’t care it’s funny that you had to come here and make a post about it. 
---
Funny thing is I am, the point just needs to be based on more than sympathy.

900 hour guy's sockpuppet account spotted.
---
I think the guide is intended for lower leveled players trying to find things. He may have chosen to not mention flux farming cause that's an end game thing and he expects higher leveled players to not use his guide. Since they most likely have their own methods.
---
I have almost every TSE weapon there is along with 100+ other 3* weapons and armor. If you’re active on the market then it’s easy to buy and sell guns for profit until you have all the ones you want. I’ve played this game close to 450 hours since it came out tho so you need to account for people’s play styles and if they have a clan and other things.. just think you’re projecting your play style a little too much on the situation imo
---
Yes you were.
---
Everyone got a 3* weapon and a 3* armor piece, a prime receiver, an Ultracite armor plan and I got the Plan: Ultracite Internal Database

Somewhat normal for that time if night, most people go to bed to get up for work the next day and it seems to be aggressive pvp players that stay up.

Bloody even with the mutation bug is still the best, pretty sure that all of these claims are false. I say this because people in the trade discord are claiming they are still one-shotting stuff after patch. Testing when I get home, will update unless I see proof one way or the other before I get off work
---
It's not my intent to comment on any specific ban, and I know nothing about Glorf's case.
---
It's to suggest more generally, that the majority of players probably haven't experienced how fast you can legitimately craft ammo when you've maxed all relevant perks and other effects, really know the game and its locations, and are determined to craft in quantities that make no sense for most of us.
---
What I crafted was less than a tenth the numbers you mentioned, yet convinced me personally that 300k ammo could be legitimately crafted in 30 days. Even more so the more I think about it; a player could craft tons of ammo in a 30-day period using materials collected over previous months. Or could be part of a team funneling resources toward the player, who might be the team's ordnance officer, for example.
---
This is why I don't think having crafted 600k rounds in 30 days, alone constitutes strong evidence of cheating.
---
do you know how to play with legos? yeah its like that, but easier.
---
Rolling pins and flare guns. Throw on some wood armor and you are invincible/s

Welp there goes my build I guess
---
I would totally take avatage of this but im not even genaral yet😤
---
i wonder if you are going to be banned from all of their games?
---
So you say its legit to have every armor and weapon in the game available for sell? Ok, i dont think its very legit. And what a coinsidence that every player who is innocent just happens to have every single tse weapon in the game 🤷‍♂️
---
Fuck dude, you definitely sound upset.  I'll bet you I sold more copies of this game and spent more on it than you.  But if all that screw hunting has got you in such a shit mood you might wanna take a break.
---
Also Miniguns with Shredder. The Shredder should increase durability, not decrease it. You're wrapping up the barrels in chains and spiky bits of metal. If anything, it should reduce attack speed as that's more weight to spin up. Also please consider reducing the condition loss for bashing. It's too high and really makes the shredder a less viable option.

You could only get unique pieces of legendary power armour in Fallout 4. Random drops weren't a thing.
---
And skip turrets. Useless.
---
Totally different thing than yelling "liar", "brainwashed by Beth" or other crap. Or being liar or brainwashed.
---
Don't use turrets. Or build in a area with low level monsters and just use one turret centrally positioned to defend against them.  Turrets aren't any kind of defense against other players anyway. 
---
It's considered a rare material yes. You can find a lot of it through normal play while picking up junk items etc, but it's not like plastic or steel where you would be able to gather over 100,000 of it in 30 days.
---
Very good post OP.
---
Explains that it in such detail especially love the 15 nukes  a day for 30days.
---
Its just not possible unless your an exploiter i just cant find any viable reason why this is legit :).
---
Oh so you mean he didn't actually work for all of his shit?  But he was innocent right?   
---
LOL 900 hour guy sockpuppet confirmed. 
---
I'm guessing because they have spent zero on turrets.  Everyone I know with a huge place has zero turrets.   I have turrets so my place is pretty small. I honestly don't give a shit about camps though.  A camp for me is just a place to repair stuff and store my junk. 
---
I mean I legit have a few hours in game after I stopped playing the first week. Sorry you have such a low opinion of me immediately. I understand a lot of people on here are disingenuous, but I truly did just get banned. I put in an appeal and am waiting on a response.
---
Seems everyone on here hates me for whatever reason.

Fuckin well said, friend.

I'll attempt to hold a fraction of the faith you hold, but I'm leaning toward fuck Bethesda for the rest of my life and attempt to convince everyone that they are just money grabbing thieves
---
Make sure you don't have a bunch of stuff in the Stored tab either.  You can scrap whatever is in there.
---
Wow, you really do suck at reading comprehension. He was given a shit ton of gear and accounts after he was banned because people were pissed about someone innocent being banned. 
---
Withholding final judgement for 1 months time.

Bethesda have not officially said anything asides from mods will be supported post-launch.. sometime in 2019-2020. Most mods currently use the existing game infrastructure and .ba2 archive system. The .ba2 file type is a Bethesda implemented file method for modding. 
---
Modding is in a grey area and it is a possible risk (since no official word will ever be said if it's ok or not). 
---
Most mods are Quality of Life mods and so far Bethesda have not seen a need to jump on it. 
---
Although they have not said anything on the matter, it is obvious Bethesda aren't entirely against it as they built the systems for modding, they know the systems for modding and could easily prevent people from modding by disabling the ini changes to their archive list but they do not. 
---
They have control over the archive list and could see what mods people are using. They could implement a system (if they wanted) where they could blacklist certain or all mods.
---
On top of that, they DO prevent mods from changing any game files that could enable cheating (such as changing character speeds and developer console controls). The game would not launch and crash if mods edit these files.
---
I use the following mods and have been doing so since the first week.
---
**Better Inventory**
---
Allows you to filter your inventory to only show certain category of items i.e. pressing 2 on the AID menu will show only food items, pressing 3 will show drinks, 1 will reset).
---
**Perk Loadout Manager**
---
Allows you to make save deck builds (1-8). You swap decks/builds the same way (go to pipboy, go to perks menu, press 1-8, it swaps the cards, you tab out. Useful for having your main build [1] and being able to switch to builds for certain situations like opening things (hacker/lockpick) [2] or crafting [3], etc. This is probably a feature that Bethesda should implement for all systems. 
---
**Power Armor Compass Fix**
---
Currently the Power Armor compass is misaligned and all the icons show slightly to the right of where the locations actually are, so this mod just re-aligns it correctly. Surprised this hasn't been fixed already, so I wouldn't need the mod.
---
**Menu Music Replacer**
---
This is just replaces the main menu music.
---
https://youtu.be/ruemozPjowA?t=6
---
You basing your math off the false premise that he currently holds that much ammo and not on the possibility he has passed that ammo back and fourth to his main numerous times.
---
There is little point I'm arguing with people that fail to see that.....Berhesda has a record of screwing up since day one, what makes this any different as another possible screw up of theres.
---
For what its worth I think most the people saying they did nothing most likely did, but there is a significantly different mindset in their posts that screams guilty.
---
OP posted his own picture and explained why he thinks those numbers are there, how about Bethesda posts what he actually has on his account currently not what has been on it over the last 30 days.
---
Has anyone been unbanned ?
---
LOL, I'm not banned genius.
---
I confirm. I was selling stuff (not duped) for huge number nuka grapes and now account is suspended.
---
I meant duplication in the sense of redundant. 
---
I’m in a similar boat, pal
---
Flatwoods monster got you
---
Ask the person to provide specifics and numbers. Crunch the numbers yourself and check the math, so you can avoid searching post history. Ask for screenshots of the email Beth sent them. If they don’t comply, you can surely look at their post history. 
---
Don’t rummage through the comments of others if you don’t have to.
---
The algorithm worked perfectly. It found someone doing exactly what they were looking for. Abusing the game.
---
Stop and think for a second how someone could be given gear, once they were banned.   
---
You continue to self-own on such a massive basis, it's hilarious. 
---
One Gun Army might work with it though - but explosive already staggers, and the crippling chance is really low from the perk.  I suspect most people complaining just wanted the weight reduction to apply properly via Bear Arms to the grenade launchers.
---
And it’s funny you still come back to comment if you don’t care. I said screws aren’t hard to get, man. All I do is grab every fan and typewriter I see. But good on you for spending more money on a game and then burning yourself out of it. Wasting your money seems like a weird thing to be proud of.
---
You can organically support ammo usage with just loot and some crafting for a lot of builds, but for any type of heavy gun you will spend half your time farming materials for ammo crafting. Any serious battle can easily chew through a couple thousand rounds.   
---
I'm at 200+ hours / level 60-ish and I've noticed there's also a marked difference in ammo usage just for casual play. Not even using heavy guns, I can easily burn through 300-500 rounds of .556 in the handmade, just doing farming runs for certain material types. This is just on "average" mobs because everything is such a massive bullet sponge as the enemies get to higher levels.
---
I did some calculations on what it would take to craft this much ammo that you may find interesting:  
---

---
it is possible, but the smarter ones will know to avoid me and leave all my things at one shot durability
---
This post should be locked for now, it's being brigaded by people with duping in their post history.
---
A better question rather than did we have radworms might be - is Adrenal Reaction working for any one at all?
---
i definitely find a lot of his story fishy. If im being honest and biased, I lean more to the conclusion that he is a liar and knows why he got banned. I find some of his actions, as well as the overall situation to be questionable and illogical.
---
that being said, a lot of what we see and know about this can be fabricated. we have very little *hard* evidence supporting Bethesda or the people complaining. all we can really do is take random strangers' words for it, and work with what they tell us. we also have to take Bethesda's word as "these guys did it, not a shred of doubt," while also considering that they have made significant errors before, and the possibility that their algorithm may be flawed.
---
im still unsure about who to believe rn. there are just too many unknowns, and too many "beyond a reasonable doubt" arguments for both sides and, objectively, those things should be considered as well when approaching this. we have had phony stories blow up and spread like wildfire, damaging the game's reputation by the time it was proven bullshit. at the same time, if these people are *really* innocent, this is pretty fucked up. you have paying customers (your last lifelines, really) who are getting stiffed for an undisclosed period of time for something they didn't do without acknowledging it. that's huge. 
---
I think we need some time to pass to see what happens. if it is an issue on Bethesda's part, I don't see them ignoring it. serious issues that have been highlighted by the community have been tackled head on, at the very least with "there is possibly an issue, we're investigating." hopefully they make a statement either way this week. If people are being rightfully banned, I think they need to be more straightforward about the parameters. they cite "excess of 100k" of "certain rare items" over 30 days. that's very vague. As another comment under mine pointed out, you can touch 100k of ammo via heavy trading easily. does that count? if someone passes 50k ammo to their mule and back 3 times in a month, are they flagged? we know that Bethesda's software isn't perfect. the error being on Bethesda's part is an equal possibility.
---
Sorry fix it
---
Oh thanks...
---
I wouldn't mind a platform specific market. Why not just have 3.
---
Sure you're not. Owned.
---
Yes, did you miss the part where he was given accounts with characters on them from people who quit? 
---
Concerning Toxic Valley Treasure Map #3, if you have Savage Divide Treasure Map #5 then you can activate the location. 
---
I also want to know - how come you're not LARPing beta testers on Bethesda's official forum? Are upvotes just a bullies pulpit?
---
What did he do that abused the game and went against any of the rules or even close to any of their rules?
---
From what I'm seeing on other posts it doesn't seem to be. Others are saying speed demon isn't working for them but it's ok for me. I think the biggest question is, yet again, why havent Bethesda tested their patches 
---
What about the Excavator power armor glitch? Even after reloading if you take it off and put it back on you still lose the extra carry weight perk of the armor. Having the extra carry weight is so hit or miss and then you end up overencumbered after fast traveling somewhere.
---
My Twisted Muscles disappeared after fighting Scorchbeast Queen and using Radaway. I had Rad Worms, but I have Starched Genes (lvl 2) to avoid losing the mutation. I was killed twice and revived. I don't know if that helps. 
---
BTW... The queen was just about impossible to kill with 10 players over lvl 100 including me at lvl 150. It broke most of my guns, and I was almost ready to start punching her.
---
They were banned for 120,000 rounds of ammo, it was just noted that there was additional ammo on an alternate account that appeared to belong to them.
---
Yeah, you definitely are. We know, you don't have to announce it, unlike you most people are able to read competently enough to realize that.
---
Yeah, QoL like the ones you listed should be fine. Things like the mod to show the "sweet spot" on lockpicking less so.
---
Let's be honest...Bethesda could come out with smoking gun proof on every single person they suspended and people would still call bullshit...
---
So then "he" wasn't given gear. "He" didn't earn anything himself. Sounds like socialist libtard handouts to me. 
---
Uh what is your problem?
---
It wasn't a waste if I had fun, just not a great investment.  And I has fun.
---
Also, most things that had screws were pretty heavy and I found myself basically having to go on screw runs which weren't much fun.  I'd rather explore and have a baseline of good junk from that than have to target specific things.  That's one of the games failings I feel.
---
And I'm honestly here as my swansong to this subreddit.  I got banned this weekend and popped in to see what was up.  I saw the ban threads and figured I'd give my own slightly different perspective.
---
So you've explained the 300,000 ultracite ammo. What about the other 300,000 ammo he had? Is he dropping 5 nukes a day, farming flux, AND farming lead/acid for the non ultracite ammo?
---
Sounds to me like just getting the ultracite ammo would require all his time.
---
The simplest answer is he duped it. Why is that so hard to accept? He, along with all the other dupers, were banned because they duped ungodly amounts of rare items.
---
Pretty sure some of the arm mods for PA don’t do anything. Like the optimized bracers, I don’t feel there’s a difference in performance with or without them on. 
---
I have that same gun. Spent the money and bought the plans 
---
No one was banned for mass-crafting, so you can feel safe if you're worried about that
---
It doesn't need an increase, it needs a complete rework. I've suggested before a potentially good way to fix the system is to only count unique stack's weights against the stash limit. So 100 bobby pins in 1 stack would only use 1 bobby pin weight worth of space. 
---
Like steel is 0.5 right? So if you had a stack of 1000 steel it'd still just take up 0.5 in stash (though if you move it to character then it'd weigh 500). Fusion cores are 3 per item but can stack if they have same charge. So if you have 10 at 100% and 3 at 50% then it'd take up a total of 6 stash space (3 lbs for the 50% stack and 3 lbs for the 100% stack).
---
This would make it so you aren't disincentivised from playing the game (why should I gather more rare stable flux that weighs 1lbs each when I can't store much more) but would still limit how much random junk you store.
---
Good question.  I'm a bit worried about that but have not investigated yet since I really only played the other Fallout games.
---
But it's a bug. Martial artist work with the galting gun and hunting rifle doesn't even make sense 
---
Dumbest post because martial arts the specifically says melee weapons. A Gatling isn't a melee
---
Too bad he didn't leave a bag for you  to plunder
---
Not a dev room item though. There's a Bethesda Support ticket someone sent where they confirmed it was just an ultra rare item to find. The problem is that once you get one, you're like 95% likely to learn the plans for it when scrapping it.   
---
The hood was removed a few weeks ago though without it being said.
---
I feel you I really do.  But it's not a nerf if something broken and not working as intended gets fixed.  That's not what "nerfs" are.
---
Damnnn is it a nerf or bug?
---
They just stealth nerfed bloodied builds too.
---
They really don’t care about killing their player base at all LOL
---
Yes!!!!
---
Bye moron.
---
That went over my head. 
---
The only perks he talked about using were super duper and a crafting perk I think ammocraft or  something and he states he got banned for just passing ammo between two accounts because he got tired of playing on 1 account and wanted to rank up another. Yet it all happened in 1 month yet he supposedly never had more that 36k of any amount of ammo at 1 time on any of his 2 accounts which if you look at what his second mule account had with just ultracite would say there is no way. Basically he was saying he was just barely crafting anything and with that short amount of time. Like I said I could be totally wrong but with other things stated that turned out to be BS I find I lean more to he lied than anything else. I gave him the benefit up to the part where other things came around and out into the light. 
---
Because every body that has complained said the same things the only thing different is you said you have a few hours played
---
If you’re running adrenal reaction low hp builds that’s why everything was more tanky. It’s broken. 
---
Ir, if it is going to give them to me, let me use them. So I want my 2-star Bandoleer and a 1 star bandoleer active at the same time. 
---
What is it, exactly, you'd like  them to fix? Taking and holding workshops is a PVP activity and it tells you that prior to ever claiming it.  
---
I claim workshops often. I've never once had a person hunt me down across the map to PVP me. That's not to say you haven't, but I check with several people I know that regularly take workshops and none had this happen, though a couple mentioned griefing for the sake of griefing.  I have had plenty come to the workshop to take it from me, or try to anyway, some have, most, not so much. 
---
Think about defensive walls that really show their damage before breaking. You could come back to your base and have your walls looking really busted up with no wanted levels.
---
You can't tell me you thought the Martial Artist quirk was deliberate.  It was clearly an oversight and wasn't meant to apply to anything beyond melee weapons.
---
Well, they used the term "recipe" instead of "plan" so I'm starting to think it's something not many have come across.
---
Has there been any pics shown about this?
---
Hung up on rules? Try knowing right from wrong. Easy enough if you are not a sociopath.  Taking advantage of any exploit is wrong. You dont get to pick and choose, they are all bad.
---

Thanks for the replies y'all. Had 5 turrets on my tiny roof. One for each side and one in the middle. Have 2 left now. The mobs always come from 2 sides.
---
Freed up a lot of budget. Cheers guys, very helpful 👍👍
---
No problem. I'm having the same issue with adrenal reaction mutation like many other players...
---
Is this still in the game after patch 7? I love how no one's reported it and kinda kept it a secret since.
---
RIP bloody builds lol
---
Ya man I actually started it, such a smooth game man 
---
It's mods.
---
Usually other games are quick to hotfix, but bugthesda usually takes a week after the release of a patch 
---
We're all fighting different battles. I think most people here care about the game. They want what is best for the game, though may not always agree on what is best. I want to be positive, but I know nothing will change if you don't fight. You have to fight to be heard. Sometimes you have to make a noise. Sometimes people get in the way fighting against their own best interests. Fighting for the interests of suits who don't care about the game, the way the developers do, the way we do.
---
Selecting your weapon is part of the build. 
---
Selecting the minigun is failing at that part. 
---
Also, ban the worst of the dupers so their giant inventories are not adding further server drag the day before releasing a bunch of stability fixes to make the fixes even more effective.
---
I don’t agree but I agree to disagree lol.. I’ll look at his feed but I doubt he has literally “every weapon and armor for sale” and again take into account clans and things where the whole clan gives excess weapons to one player to sell.. just take a little time to think about the role playing dynamics I think you’re being a little salty imo no offense 
---
I use three mods. Two for sorting and one for perks. The worst I've had is the game crashing because I derped on the Fallout76Custom.ini text.
---
Perk Loadout Manager is busted as of the 1.0.6 patch because of reasons, but that's expected. I wager cosmetic mods are ok, though anything affect gameplay is a no go.
---
Indeed, thank you. I updated my wording to be more accurate.
---
But every player will eventually reach end game. That’s why smart developers install a good endgame to keep player base instead of them moving on after they reach a certain point in the game 
---
The people are really the only thing this game has going for it.  Bethsoft dropped the ball having so few ways for players to interact, and I feel they are shooting themselves in the foot by doubling down on a PvP mode with the engine still like it is.
---
Oh come on, like you haven't found yourself running from mutants before.  Your underwear have had real use. :)
---
Id like to make friends with the Mothman instead of killing him but he doesn't stick around long enough :P
---
Wait, I thought it was a bug. You're telling me, the armor gets unequipped, by design?
---
If you want to contact Bethesda go to their official forums, right? Why isn't reddit just for fun?
---
I was just going to comment with this, if you delete your comment or post it won't appear in the subreddit, but it will always appear in your profile.
---
When I suspected someone of duping in the market subreddit I would ask them leading questions like "how are you selling those serum recipes so cheaply?" If they answered it would give context, you could quickly look in their post history and see their answers, even if they deleted their post.
---
But to those who are curious, you can even see deleted comments and posts, even the ones removed by moderators, just change where it says Reddit to Removeddit in the URL.
---
Here's an example where I believe this guy is actually a duper who's trolling others and basically bragging that he isn't banned. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as13p6/comment/egtrf1h if you click the link it should say deleted, but if you click this link https://www.Removeddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as13p6/comment/egtrf1h it should show my comment, or you can just check my profile and see the comment right there even though it's removed.
---
Rose doesn't count as anything because fuck her and her stupid raider buddies for making the wasteland a worse place to live.
---
Her quest line was interesting but I hated how it sent me all over the mal and into places where the enemies were WAY over leveled compared to me.
---
10k shells in a day is not surprising.  5mm gives 180 rounds and with super duper you average about 60 more each time.  You only have to craft 40 times to get 10k.  I am a melee build.  I use ammo for backup and ranged weapons.  I generally craft 5-10k at a time so I dont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks.  I'm actually happy about the TSE nerf.  If it had not been for that, I was starting to rack up a lot of ammo being made doing SBQ 2-4 times a day.  I wnt back to mainly melee.  That probably saved me from a ban!
---
A victim, yikes, sorry your TSE doesn’t two shot everything now it takes four shots what a travesty 
---
Im not gonna stop using the GC either.
---
This pose is free just so everyone knows. 6 more days.
---
How on earth did you end up here if you didn't buy the game? I don't own RDR2 and I've not been on that sub once. Because... why would I?
---
ikr! huge frame difference from fo76
---
its good thing bethesda is only looking at recent history.  back when i was an ignorant noob last year i picked up a plastic bag and it had TONS of junk.  i just thought someone duped tons of junk/candy to get rid of weight.  in hindsight it may have been dupe but i didnt know people were even duping in fo76.  good thing it was long ago and i quickly liquidated most of it.  
---
I got a permanent ban today and I wrote a long essay before. Im done with Bethesda. I will never buy a game from such a company.
---
Sad that Bulk still scraps when you "Scrap All" 😟 For me this is a big deal and the reason i haven't been playing since the bug first showed up. I have a lot of Bulk on my Character for use on my Vendor Runs or recouping some of my Plan buying.
---
In the patch prior to today's I believe.  I had 2 separate instances of being perma stuck in [DANGER] even when there were no creatures around.  Problem only went away when I relogged. 
---
Level 50 T-51b and X-01 have better resistances than the ultracite, just in case you want more protection. 
---
I've done this on console just honestly thought the ore amount I got was variable...not that it matters, people with tunnel vision see only one verdict and ignore any evidence that contradicts it, good luck with your witch hunts.
---
I agree with you there. Sometimes getting weapons repaired and certain ammo can be a huge pain in this game if you want to use a certain gun all the time. You went the way of cheating to get what you want. I decided to fit a melee weapon into my build and use other types of weapons until my repair and crafting perks were in place. I agree that it sucks the game makes you make that choice, but you made the shit choice. 
---
You play a big burly guy in FO76 too?
---
No they didn't, its just adrenal not working, wasn't supposed to happen. 
---
Did I? 
---
LOL, at least you were right about me not being banned: https://i.imgur.com/5kjYpvY.jpg
---
I am stuck in just Caution, and not Danger.
---
The wording implies they had all that at one point during the 30 day period. Not just cumulative but actually had that much at one point. 
---
Todd Howard knows your schedule... 
---
Says a person without kids!  
---
Not at all, I'm having a good laugh at how stupid you are and to see how long I can continue to troll you. 
---
Ya man. I’ll be back if they fix all these bugs and create new content that is actually interesting. Our group ain’t going anywhere 
---
This would be cool. Shanty towns and cities with friends would be A+ 1
---
2 patches ago, sneak has been very inconsistent. I dont think bethesda has said anything about it yet.
---
&gt; I got a permanent ban today and I wrote a long essay before.
---
You should have bought a better essay
---
ARGH!  80% of the Atom shop items are not visible.  I have no idea outside of the verbal description what is to buy.   Also, the light wood laminate has completely disappeared in game which means my camp no longer has floors!
---
Is the PLM mod working for you after you do this to your INI file?  Haven't gotten a chance to verify.
---
LOL I TROLL U LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
Actually they had to make the Excavator because normal PA couldn’t withstand the damaging effects from mining.
---
My two star pool cue is just awsome, wish I could win some caps at beating noobs at snooker.... :)
---
Like...here's a thing.   
---
I can see going through hundreds of thousands of rounds in this game. I can see that easily, especially for automatic weapons.   
---
What I cannot see is USING hundreds of thousands of rounds, and and still \_having\_ hundreds of thousands of rounds. 
---
Whatever your opinion it's a thing. Sometimes a gray area, but many games have rules against multi-accounting. Obviously fo76 allows alts, but I doubt they intended for people to be playing multiple characters \*at the same time\*, which you would need to do for a mule account to be useful.
---
Call it whatever you want, still he ended up getting free accounts and gear because of bethesdas fuck up and he will even be getting his main character back after a patch. LOL
---
This have been intermittent since release however it became particularly egregious since patch 5.
---
I can go an entire five hour playing session without leaving \[CAUTION\] thus not having Healing Factor kick in.
---
Not an issue today though... they have also borked Adrenal Reaction so I am quite relaxedly browsing reddit instead.
---
He actually didn't but good try.
---
Im worried about dupers coming back
---
No bud. I picked up and dropped a baggy. I picked it up, ignorance. I saw this numbers. (Bobbleheads) I dropped them. All within 30 seconds. It flagged me for items gained in set time. There are plenty in this category of brief interaction with a rampant disease within the game. You just want to believe you are a good guy and we all bad guys. 
---
That essay is bullshit btw

---
Considering that people are accessing the dev room where it is unencrypted and potentially posting it here it looks like hack apologist logic to me.
---
Doing it on accident and thinking you got variable amounts is far different than explicitly setting out to create or acquire a macro that automatically spams the key. I've done it on accident myself when I clicked to acquire from a node and it was still there, assuming that there were multiple stacks of the ore on top of themselves. I did not, however, make a macro to try to take advantage of server lag. That's a quantitative difference.
---
Yes and nothing he did was wrong or even an exploit. Everything he did is common practice in most multiplayer games and are even included in most games "beginner guides".
---
LOL way to hide your in-game user info like a fuccboi bitch because you're scared.
---
You can always edit stuff though
---
Kind of sucks doesnt it? I will just get away now they arent worth the time or repair to my my PA.....
---
With the sheer number of Wendigos, Mothmen, and other monsters roaming around I'm willing to bet there isn't a single clean pair of underwear left in the Wasteland!
---
Previously I had joked that it was related to the Mole Rats having near infinite detection range.  And that when you were Sneaking at Mothman Museum and being under "Caution" it was because a Mole Rat in Watoga sensed your presence.
---
But now I think there may be some truth to that.
---
I've had the "Caution" all the time when no enemies nearby.  And then I noticed that walking around, somewhere 5 or 6 towns over, I spot a Mole Rat and kill it, suddenly I'm Hidden again.
---
The only time that "Perma-Caution" has disappeared for me without server hopping has been after I killed a random Mole Rat.
---
Why do you think the Free States are dead?
---
Sure he will. How much did you pay for that?
---
Don’t forget the free pose!!
---
That’s an absolutely ridiculous assessment of the facts I laid out imo. Through looting and turning excess resources into other ammo, because you hardly use all the lead and gunpowder you collect for ultracite ammo, it’s completely reasonable to collect that amount of ammo in a month. I generally pick up close to 8,000 rounds a day and then craft some more of what I need so 10,000 normal ammo a day is absolutely possible.. again different strokes for different folks. Please understand that as a trader people just give you excess resources such as acid,lead,steel, gunpowder because they don’t want it.. please think through the role playing dynamics a little more, and if you don’t like to RP then maybe you wouldn’t understand why someone would want to have mass amounts of items to trade with the community but it exists.
---
I see what you guys are saying, but if you're willing to apply logic to the other fantastic stuff found in the game world, why not apply the logic that swinging something faster can also apply to the crank mechanism of the gatling gun. ESPECIALLY considering how stupendously slow and unwieldy it is on it's own.
---
Think about it. Finally, something that helps make a heavy weapon not so useless is taken away, leaving the one heavy weapon I found use for useless once more. 
---
I don't think folks are taking into account the hours played enduring bugs, disconnects, and broken bullmalarky to find these now useless weapons as well. Again, I put some serious hours into this joint only to have the second reward for doing so taken away.
---
Not a good feeling, I'm sure you all can agree.
---
Thanks for the reports on this, we're aware and looking into it!
---
I regularly use a prime .50 on the SBQ, and I've never come close to 100K ultracite ammo transferred. 
---
To make ultracite ammo you need stable flux and other rare components such as the ultracite itself and hardened mass. To get the stable flux take 10 raw flux or 1000000 for 100k ammo. 
---
I'm not saying that you or your friends duped, but I'm hard pressed to see where this 100k ammo came from legitimately. Even with that, these people were not banned, only suspended  until the exploits used are sewn up. 
---
I have a PS4 version (in addition to my PC copy) so hit me up. Redimenthus on PSN.
---
Honestly it's the choice I normally make, online game or not.  The way I see it, if I pay for the game I own it.  It's a toy, and it's my toy.  As long as I'm not ruining things or others I can do what I want with it.
---
I blocked him and his content because he's bullshit. 
---
No.  It's a video game.  If it was competitive play with a ladder and maybe achievements / rewards that went with ladder play, then maybe yes.  But just PvE play and PvP without the before-mentioned stuff?  Not at all.  
---
"But it can destabilize the servers, and it can blah blah blah."
---
Right, you are paying for a working product.  It's on Bethesda not yourself to make sure the servers are stable or that limitations are hard-coded into the game to prevent people from accidentally/on-purpose doing things that destabilize them.
---
Now, is it a good idea to cheat if it leads to the game sucking ass?  No, not at all.  You would not cheat simply for the logical sake of keeping the servers stable, the economy worthwhile for everyone (not just the cheaters and their buddies), etc.  You would do this because it benefits you in the long run if what you are looking for is a multiplayer game, keeping in mind the fact that good or bad the situation is what it is and you (instead of Bethesda) have to adapt in this case.  But you are not under a *moral* obligation to do this.
---
no problem. i think you interpreted that as sarcasm when it was not. its actually extremely easy.
---
The logic works if you consider the cranking mechanism.
---
...right.  I think you're experiencing the same bug I did, yours just got stuck at a different status.  If it won't go away, and it's really annoying you, re-log.  If you don't want to re-log because reasons, you're going to have to deal with it until you do.  
---
There was never a trade bug to steal weapons. Thats  was made up. 
---
Bethesda already nuked their own game why y’all gotta keep nuking it 
---
Answer: Daily Double.
---
In all seriousness though, the window is too long and there are problems with reclaiming it.
---
If you own it, the timer to end the contesting claim should be shorter.  Additionally, there should be a cool down period which locks other players out from contesting it after the workshop has been claimed/reclaimed.
---
The two are related to the same issue.
---
I didn't even know it worked with the hunting rifle. In that I agree. Having something that makes you swing weapons faster working in conjunction the gatling's crank mechanism makes perfect sense to me though.
---
Damn you straight said people need to lose their job over a video game glitch.
---
There is a great video made by the verge that can get you started. 
---
Thanks for the info! Appreciate the detail.
---
Cheers for the fix. And thanks to [Deumus82](https://www.reddit.com/user/Deumus82) for the link to get here from Nexus. Now, do I actually want play this without Perk Loadout Manager, let us see...
---
PS4
---
The bloodied build is no match for RAD WORMS
---
It's not just that. You can't say anything nice about the game without getting downvoted or attacked.
---
But you call out the lies, it's all, LET ME SAY WHAT I WANT!
---
Imagine caring this much, and having such a misunderstood sense of your own self importance.
---
Stop making builds based around broken things, and your builds will stop getting broken.
---
That sounds fantastic, can't wait :D
---
Yes but regardless of how many accounts he has, he would still have to get all the items, and unless he has other people play his alts it doesn't make sense. Regardless why are so many people quick to defend him. It's up to Bethesda wether he is legit or not 
---
We may need some clarification from Bethesda on the 100,000 rare items flag as it pertains to ammo. From what I've calculated this is something that is easily doable if dedicated teams pool their resources:  
---
It definitely does not increase with level.  Proven a number of times.
---
That's what I'm implying, made up information to make the game look worse.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. The gatling gun is unique though due to the cranking mechanism. I can't see anyone in their right mind thinking the painfully slow crank of the gatling being intentional. It makes perfect sense for something that would allow for a faster swing working with a faster crank as well. Especially if it makes a gun go from useless to fun.
---
The EULA you agreed to says different. In that regard, things are a bit different for an online game. But you are right, if was your toy to play with. But you didn’t play right, so now your toy is gone. 
---
This time next year the game will finally be at the actual release build.
---
Thank you soooooo soooooo much! Ya'll are awesome
---
The Tactical Helmet is a regular plan. The one they’re referring to is the Marine Assault Helmet, which was the armored helmet from Fallout 4’s Fah Habbah DLC.
---
That's actually the general consensus, but to many people on this sub will take any excuse to shit on Bethesda.
---
Yeah, people have been advocating against my better judgement for years now to go to social media if you want customer service.
---
I've never understood why people think that there should actually be a difference in the level of Support just because the communication medium is different.
---
good work oof
---
The same guy who runs nuka crypt and solves the code makes a post about Dev rooms still accesible. I dont think he exploited it for himself and then made it public. That doesnt add up. 
---
Right!?!?!?! I started messing around with bloodied stuff as well only to have that to start acting goofy to add insult to injury. I can't catch a break.
---
No. I’m telling you 
---
1. We have partial information and are not a court. We are not looking If at logs like Bethesda. We’re looking at his own retelling of his story. _If he is_ guilty, he is most likely also lying about it on social media, and we’re judging on these lies and our own biases, not on data. 
---
2. The information we do have makes it improbable he was innocent, but let’s stop short of issuing verdict because of our partial information. Let’s definitely not come up with science fiction explanations for 600,000 ultracite Ammo per month. Bethesda did “what is plausible for a good confidence many hours a week” player too. Better than us. They actually know where stuff came from, how many hours a week he did actually do (and not says he did) etc. 
---
3. Unlike us, Bethesda has all the information. They have the logs and know happened. 
---
They are doing their job, and taking it seriously.
---
Im sorry, but if I find a bag of ammo or a bag with 4500 bobble heads in it, im not picking it up.  Thats like saying "dur der was money on a flipped over armoured truck.  I grabsed a few bags of it cause it was there, dur".
---
Thats not a valid excuse.
---
They never left
---
Lol so did the M79 being affected by shotgun perks. There was a precedent here, they fixed that type of bug before. Man people are gonna BITCH when they fix the other weapons like these two. If you didn't know, pipe rifle is affected by pistol and rifle perks, and the meat hook gets a buff from 1h and unarmed. But that just means you'll bitch about those after you switch
---
^ 0% sense of humor you mean. 
---
I killed two mega sloths and 2 deathclaws so far and still hasn't completed. Last week's was kill 5 different kinds but this one just says one and even if it was only 5 none of the kills are graying out.
---
Read "I don't like being called on my bullshit"
---
Have you heard of the gay ray? It ignores all these effects!
---
It’s actually the gamma gun lol.
---
Can the admins here do something and stop allowing any discussions of banned horse shit?  Because it's literally taken over this sub and it's the definition of unproductive, low-effort zero-discussion-worthy bullshit.
---
Fair enough, I would still like to know the amount of ammo this individual actually has in their inventory and not what they acquired over 30 days which may or may not include ammo moved back and fourth to mule characters.
---
Bethesda has done little to nothing to make me believe they didn't screw up on some of the bans.
---
For what it's worth most online games consider macros in and of themselves a bannable offense due to their ability to automate farming, it's considered 3rd party software.  I dont agree with that sentiment because I dislike clicking the same button 4k times, it hurts my dam hand.
---
Not only did I think it was deliberate, I thought that was the answer to the riddle of why gatling guns sucked so hard. Why wouldn't I assume that something that enables you to swing faster would enable you to crank faster as well?
---
What clear evidence? That the guy had a lot of ammo? If he has 900+ hours which is more than double what I have and he's written a guide on where and how he's farmed, including for ammo materials- why can't he have a lot more ammo than you who has played less that 1/4th as much as he has?
---
Check my recent comments, I've explained in detail the differences between the average players and those who have figured out more efficient ways to accomplish the same things.. what you "farm" for to make ammo I can likely do in 3 minutes, or 15 if I want to hop servers 5 times and make well over 100k ammo in a single batch.
---
Ultracite is common and easy to find, and if you're participating in nukes and not crafting pure flux with the hardened mass you're getting, or doing something with the 8-9 pure flux you get every time you do a scorch beast queen fight.. I ask you why?
---
So please do explain this "clear evidence", because what you call clear doesn't make sense if you apply some simple logic.
---
Is this satire?
---
Manually decrypting the codes can't be done by laymen.
---
The fact that codes aren't unique per server again points to an intention by Bethesda to have the community share the codes they collect and decrypt.
---
Everything points to code sharing being intended design, no hard in game systems exist, only clues to aid in community decryption.
---
Why have that many Power Armor chassis?
---
So I tried replicating something like this... did you have a lot of trouble with the flamethrower traps themselves breaking?  how many were you able to fit per foundation square? Looks like 4-5?
---
That's a whole lot of hassle just to tell if someone duped or not. So far we havent seen anyone give actual proof that they didn't deserve the ban. Im starting to doubt that there were any innocent parties to begin with and that all bans are justified 
---
Common practice. That's the problem. Almost everyone speeds too, but you still can get a ticket. It is not yours, his, or my opinion that decides how this goes. Its bethesda. This is not a professional sport with a rulebook. If you do things they dont want you to do, you get banned. No need to quote the statute that was broken. It's that simple.
---
Would it be nice if they were more clear about every little reason? Maybe, or maybe it would just give guys like that "acceptable" ways to cheat.
---
Yes, you sold him (at nominal cost) his very first mutation serum.  So—thank you for having been a part of the game for him.   
---
Ok shill with new account trying to soften the PR blow to your company....
---
Lol, there's no way OP could figure it out on their own.
---
If you're banned, you're guilty. They owe you NOTHING. 
---
its an easy source of scrap-able loot to learn mods and easy way to farm ultracite. sadly a lot of armor is messed up and some mods are only available via vendor.
---
It’s a bug with atom shop stuff textures and mods
---
I play with pacifist turned on.  The only time I turned it off was to deal with a guy that destroyed my camp with artillery.  I destroyed him with a TSE Black Powder Rifle.  I also sent an orbital strike to his camp after that, just before he disconnected.  
---
The other time I turned it off was to deal with a level 7 and a level 107 that were farming a glitched supply drop.  The supply drop showed up as a quest marker for my level 7 character.   So I went to it. It was locked.  I thought it was mine because I had the marker AND the quest listing for it.  So, I picked it and they insta-killed me.  I went to get my bag of basic junk.  They already took it of course.  I proceeded to watch them for about 10 minutes while they stayed in that area waiting for other low levels to show up.  They were right next to the Flatwoods Agricultural Center.   So I brought my level 80-something online and proceeded to shoot the level 7 in the face with a suppressed scoped handmade multiple times while hiding in the weeds with chameleon armor on.   Sure, I didn't get the kill because I didn't initiate PVP properly with them by letting them damage me, but I did laugh as I watched them go nuts trying to find me.  They crossed over the river multiple times looking for me.  At one point I dropped an orbital strike on them both.  They eventually found my level 7 character sitting on a rooftop.  As they pulled their guns out, I just disconnected that character and proceeded to immediately shoot their level 7 in the face again for good measure.  Nope, you guys didn't find me.   They did eventually spot me when I shot them from way too close.  As the level 107 ran up on me, I disconnected that character.  I wasn't interested in a battle.  I succeeded in wasting their time.   
---
Your anti-griefer story was even better and more rewarding than my own.  My hat's off to you and thanks for sharing!
---
My English is not so good. I’m from Germany. I’ve tried to get my account back. This company is lying again and again. I’m very pissed about it. I’ve bought the game for 80€ in the pre-sale,  some bucks for the atomshop and I got a permanent ban. It’s like life sentence if you stole a snickers. Some of my team mates can play again and have duped a hundred times more items.
---
I would be nice, right?  But they certainly aren't going to tell us what is triggering their scans.  That would just tell the bad guys what to avoid.
---
More like over hundreds of glitches and a failed launch and the slow snail speed they are doing anything about it. It all leads to management, and that guy/gal has not been doing their job, so fire them.
---
what would you say is strongest:
---
* gun
---
* melee
---
* sentinel is strongest armor?
---
my worst counter. Im a bloodied build. The only weapon that makes me shiver lol 
---
Come on, did you honestly read the EULA?  They tend to be full of various clauses that you most likely violate just my using a PC and are so capricious and bent to the use of the company that they should be rendered completely unenforceable.  They also make you agree it to after you've purchased the software.
---
All that aside, I see what you're saying but if I really wanted to play what they are putting out I'd get another copy.  But the game isn't what I initially paid for so I'm happy walking away with the time I spent there.  If it's working for you I wish you the best.
---
I had a theory about this.
---
Bethesda said that duping was bad, and announced the dupe wipe.
---
My guess is that the people being banned are people who continued duping despite all of the action, attention and warnings.
---
It makes sense too. It’s like if you clear all the water out of the sinking boat, and then see where all the holes are.  Except the boat is the servers and the water is the excessive data created by duping.
---
There was a stash increase? Time to start playing again!
---
Inventory management is my achilles heel. Once all 5 of my guys are filled up I mostly stop playing.
---
Its like they don't have a qa team. 
---
Totally disagree. Mules circumvent inventory restrictions obviously intended to be part of the game. There are good reasons many games (not to mention forums, etc.) have rules against having multiple accounts.
---
He's hackin' and wackin' and smackin'!
---
I does in a way make sense, turning a hand crank is different than just pulling a trigger, but *Martial Arts*?  
---
It was totally fun too, given the state of heavy weapons right now, a month ago my 2-shot gatling was a lot of fun!  Now it's a 30 pound lump of dead weight in my stash :(  
---
That's not what I'm lamenting. It's the time spent acquiring these items and having them rendered useless is what irks me. Looking at the situation from that angle I'm sure you can understand my frustration a bit more.
---
I'll tell you the truth, it also puts hurts my motivation to continue. How do I know that the next thing I spent hours to find that provides me a modicum of fun won't be nerfed as well?
---
It goes far beyond bethesda dashing whatever power fantasy you thought I had hahahahaha
---
They can't really do that effectively unless you buy them direct, so just stick to buying their other games on platforms like Steam, gog, or consoles where the bethesda launcher isn't used and you'll be safe.  
---
It does look guilty, assuming those are actual individual items and it's not just artificially inflated from repeated transfer of items. It's still a hefty number, but if you believe the rest of his story it starts to become plausible.  
---
I personally don't think there's really enough info from either side to judge this guy. I actually find it harder to believe that someone put 900 hours into the game than anything else here, but on other hand I'm not really that surprised someone seems to have done it.
---
Can I ask a different question?  Who the fuck would craft that much ammo?   No one needs that much ammo, not even someone playing 10 hours a day like this guy.
---
Excellent post! Just a small add, hoping they see your post and read this - workshops no longer a possible fast travel spot.
---
Deaths still retain the quest beacon even after you recover the corpse. 
---
Of course I didn’t read it, but of course you knew what you were doing was wrong and of course it’s  in there somewhere.
---
I mean they'd probably say 3 tbh, since it's been 3.
---
I’m all for banning duper’s btw and permanently but this wave of bans went a little too far imo if it’s just having 100k of a rare item that initiated the ban. I don’t have all the info tho but BSG never claimed this guy duped, just that he acquired too much of an item which I believe I proved is easily possible with his play style 
---
Sentinel assassin is best for pvp. Sentinel in general is overpowered. -15% damage while standing still per piece so a full set yields -75% damage while standing still.
---
Assassins does -8% damage from players per piece. So -40% damage from players will a full set.
---
Both of these combined yields a -115% damage reduction from players while standing still. 
---
surely bethesda wouldnt fuck up a 100th time
---
Upvoting Because I think I know who you’re referring to
---
I believe one of the northern raider railroad station vendor sells them.
---
Yeah, macros are a grey area for me too. I used them extensively when I played WoW, but that game has a comprehensive macro system in-game that limits you to doing things they approve of. I wouldn't use macros in an online game without something like that specifically *because* it seems like the kind of thing most likely to flag your account.
---
I'm curious how much he has also, as well as how their detection system works and whether it takes into account things like trading with a mule. From the email he got, it's obvious they *know* he has a mule account and was trading with it. That would at least *imply* that they took that into account. I understand why they are not going into much detail on how it works, though. The more people know about how the dupe detector works, the more likely they are to find a way to evade it. Even if only temporarily.
---
People still play this garbage? lmao
---
I think the top of the world raider traders sometimes have it. Or did you mean the one dropped from Enclave events?
---
I got on this morning, for the first time in a week. And before that, another week. I love fallout, but I just cant with this game anymore. Especially knowing they're doing this to players
---
So it's like... a stealth nerf or their own fix, before the fix is even live.  I don't really know what we call that even.
---
The man has a family! Damn. This is why I call nonsense on the ‘woe is me’ dupers. You’re doing the lords work!
---
I have done this a few times and it’s really satisfying. Keeping overwatch from afar is really fun. 
---
Did the 900 guy get his ban lifted? Lolz
---
Nope, it just says that the player acquired that amount of items during a 30 day period, nowhere it actually said what you are implying.
---
Where would one find the location of.such a room?  
---
I bought one at the Sunnytop vendor bot
---
Nope, the raider one, and u mean the one inside the ski building downstairs?
---
Being an 'older guy'...I am amazed at these open world games.  I mean...I grew up during the golden age of Arcades and while that was cool and all, I have seen technology grow from basically nothing.  Games grew right alongside technology.  The point is that I guess I can be much more 'forgiving' due to what I have seen in the past.  Younger folks don't have that so I guess I can see how they would be somewhat less forgiving.
---
Would have been nice to have when more than half of your player bas was still actually playing, wouldn't it? After a couple hundred hours and putting up with all the numerous bugs, I called it quits a few weeks ago. Ir really seems like the company and the dev's dont give a crap.
---
Wheres sunnytop?
---
I bought one at a raider vendor.  Having said, that, I wouldn't buy it if you are looking for protection against airborne diseases. There's a quest in the game fairly early that gives you a helmet that does the exact same thing. 
---
I  would only spend caps for it if you are going for a raider aesthetic. 
---
It wasn't supposed to be affected by the perk, so no they didn't fix the Gatling, they removed the perk bug. Don't be dense because you're salty
---
I don't think the fallout universe was doing a good job with the environment prior to the war. 
---
My greedy ass agrees with you 
---
I'm guessing for an encore you'll demand everyone who has ever had a power core get recharged because they logged our in PA be banned immediately. 🙄
---
I would bet money my kids are as old or older than you.
---
Think it was simpack when below 25 percent, 25 rad resistane and 25 reduced ammo wieght
---
It’s free because when you use it, you see there is nothing in the future of this game, except bug after bug after bug x1000
---
One of the northern RR stations
---
I didn’t see it...did this patch address how it’s not possible to buy BoS plans due to vendor limits?
---
We don't deserve you.
---
Thanks, I'd have missed it 
---
Sexxx
---
I was just looking for it because i like it haha
---
Players were burying workshops with camp stuff that would cause them to flag for bounty if the picked the lock or destroyed the items blocking physical access to the workshop.
---
Now you can flag on the workshop without being physically obstructed.
---
U remember how much?
---
In addition to that indicator, make it that armor that is in-use cannot be dropped, junked or sold.   Make it so that we have to take off the armor in order to drop it, destroy it, or sell it.   
---
This should apply to any armor when it is being worn regardless of power armor status.
---
That sounds fun, will have to try it later!
---
Auto scrapping still scraps bulk.

I just logged in a this shows as limited time, new, looking to the future.  BUT, there's no picture of an object, so I guess my future doesn't exist.

Please show proof of this.
---
but how does the front of my underwear get brown...?
---
Not everyone who isn’t min-maxing their balls off ends up with 600,000 ultracite ammo in their inventory.
---
I've seen them spawn on the countertop near that raider vendorbot, didn't even need to buy it.
---
This is a pain...&amp; if you're wearing regen armor, it won't proc when you're in pseudo-caution/danger. It's a real pain.
---
ever heard of a game called EVE? if your looking to kill time thats the place to go... I seroiusly lost most of 2013. some players have been leveling / training for 10 years real time to just fly 1 ship... 
---
They probably just eliminated the requirement for you to stand in the circle around the workshop while defending it. Which honestly why add that, it really doesn’t work around what they wanted it to work around. Just more proof they don’t actually test ANYTHING.
---
They do you get a damage nerf vs players for like 3 hours.

i used the FOCUS thing to blur the backgrounds.

I'm currently running [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3855f5&amp;d=eo2ej4am2au2a02s92sf2ss2sg2l71lu2c72pe2i44cm0sb2s72a42&amp;w=ij2if2ik0iq2e82e12el2&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3855f5&amp;d=eo2ej4am2au2a02s92sf2ss2sg2l71lu2c72pe2i44cm0sb2s72a42&amp;w=ij2if2ik0iq2e82e12el2&amp;n=)  and it's a lot of fun.  Radiation is my biggest weakness.  I have Talons, Twisted muscles, Marsupial, Grounded, Scaly Skin and Healing Factor.  In blast zones I just switch to Hazmat suit.  Sure it makes me semi-squishy but still survivable.  I died twice during my only SBQ run (PA users will probably say that twice is two times too many)  but I did survive.  I use an Instigating Mole Miner Gauntlet because I can't find an instigating Deathclaw one yet...  I'm currently in Heavy Combat armor but thinking of switching to Trapper for the rad resist so the normal ghouls don't crank up my rad meter as fast.  Sun Kissed it also useful as a swap in for reducing rads during the day.
---
Are camp keypads not working as intended? What's the point of a keypad if anyone can just activate the pull lever right below the keypad to open my rolling door? 
---
No, you can log into a nuke anywhere. If you've got radworms and no PA or hazmat suit on your dead in seconds. While near the queen, if you die you have like a 50% chance of spawning in the middle of the nuke zone. Quite troublesome if you don't have PA on, if you have radworms you die in seconds causing a never ending loop of spawn-death with no option of spawning elsewhere.
---
Some of the better farming runs for lead and iron ore you can get ridiculous amounts of materials in literally minutes. I think it's Hornwright Testing site 3, I farmed out all the lead and 70-80% of the iron two times, and it probably took less than 15 minutes total. Assuming you have enough acid to process it all, you're talking at least a couple of thousand rounds for about half an hour's work. And if you're 900 hours guy then you can spend the rest of your day farming the acid to make it happen.  
---
Basically if it's plausible to farm that much Ultracite ammo, it's just as plausible to do the rest, as the additional time investment is really minimal.
---
I heard adrenal reaction is bugged, also something about legendaries sinking into the ground
---
Absolutely happened to me and a whole group of people doing a SBQ run last night. So before todays patch. 
---
She disappeared and so did the legendary ghouls that spawned. 
---
No, but I do not think it was too much
---
I completely missed that.  Have to go back in and get that.  Love freebies.
---
It puts the citation on its claims or else it gets the hose again
---
i suppose.  but it says "in appalachia"  which to me says, "in game"  who knows.  not gonna bother with it any more.
---
Pretty sure he's just meming. 
---
That is usually called griefing and no it is not.
---
I go exploring and try to find the places from the default loading screens because some of them have very nice views.
---
"I am Jor El, Master of Scheduling"
---
A perk that enables a weapon to be swung faster also working with a faster crank didn't seem broken. Nor did the explosives considering how similarly they worked in fallout 4.
---
Your statement confuses me. These are builds and weapons I spent after countless hours of farming and playtime. The reward for engaging this kind of game for this amount of time is supposed to yield some kind of high powered playstyle. As a fan of Diablo 3 I expect it actually. 
---
How am i supposed to discern what's broken and what isn't in this unwieldy, glitchy, buggy mess that I've been putting up with since beta? I endured because of how fun the loot hunt is, now I can't even trust that. I cant wait until they considered "bloodied" broken and nerf that as well lol
---
It's the northern most station on the right side of map. Very northern end of the railway if you head north from Pleasant Valley Station/Top of the World.
---
From what I hear it's the mods messing it up
---
That’s all assumption and speculation. The numbers don’t lie. It’s not only the more decent thing to do, it’s also factually correct. That takes work, and I’m sorry it does, but it’s the right thing to do.
---
Actually I have stopped playing, ever since they nerfed the one gun I enjoyed using, my tse .50 cal I got from a scorchbeast queen within the first month of playing
---
Check mine, go head, you'll be disappointed 
---
So cool! Thanks for putting this together, if I'm ever back in your beautiful state I'll give this a shot!
---
I think I've seen that at Sutton train station.
---
It does tend to show up randomly, but the ski resort vendor area is a good start.
---
Sorry, *still* cant see it
---
I thought we were all suppose to be running around in yellow Power Armor.... :)
---
How do you show proof of such an asinine statement? I must have missed the day we went over the gaming Constitution in school.
---
*That* would be awesome.
---
No
---
Excuse me. MOTHMAN power armor?? Since when is this a thing??
---
You forget that flux is around 50 cap being generous to buy so he could have just traded for it farming nukes for legendaries selling them and such, it’s easier to just buy the damn stuff then farm right now anyways
---
Only issue I had is it is negative 2 PER.
---
That’s the thing though, it’s not useless, it still does a shit ton of damage. You aren’t a normal fallout player right? You are more interested in the MMO aspect right?
---
No but if i got that option i absolutely would, with max bodyhair.
---
Does the logic of something allowing you to swing faster also allowing for faster cranking not make sense to you? Not salty, just inquisitive.
---
I can say with confidence that if you were willing to grind out stuff for F76, then you'll probably have a good time in Warframe.
---
I have no sympathy for cheaters and emotional manipulators but I still tried to be nice and offer alternatives
---
I am not saying that HE did it. I am saying that WE have no way of knowing whether it was calculated legitimately or not. So reposting it is de facto supporting stealing the codes from the dev room. Hackers are the reason that we can't have nice things.
---
Besides, if it was MEANT for us to have easy access to the code it wouldn't BE hard to do! Much like the duping of legendary equipment "since the odds are so low to find it" is a similar lazy mindset.
---
Thats my point. They wont and can't. Thus its bogus
---
It's not their fault it's peoples mods
---
Better make it double layer!! :D
---
Instead of getting the big guns buff many people were expecting, you guys get a fix that negatively effects you and nothing else.
---
Most smart companies would balance their guns before fixing a bug that made them actually useable, but Bethesda isn’t a smart company, or isn’t managed by anyone very intelligent that’s for sure.
---
It looks like adrenal reaction is bugged. If you run that it could explain some of it. But the 5% bloatfly damage, maybe that’s not all of it
---
Why do we stick up for these morons? No. The dude cheated. 
---
You have to completely tear down your base after you get some levels since your last build. If I am not mistaken, the way CAMP crafting works is that each item takes a percentage of your build budget. You NEVER get more build budget, you simply use less of your percentage when crafting each item as you level up. So simply moving your base appears to store the same items at the same percentage in your stored tab, thus not giving you the benefit of your new found levels. 
---
Move your camp, scrap everything, build anew. I have a huge base with tons of decorations now using this method. 
---
Love the game, but not gonna lie I picked up AC origins and AC odyssey on sale with some steam gift cards i got from my fiances family for christmas and kind've forgot that FO76, along with everything else in my life except for work existed...

Late to all of these threads and have wasted WAY too much of my time reading up on the controversy...Honestly, I could go either way on this since there are simply too many unknown factors.
---
For one, there seems to be a huge discrepancy between whether these reported ammo numbers are how much was held at any given time, versus 'acquired' in a given time period, which could be cumulative if there was any muling involved.
---
The muling aspect is also important here, because it is entirely possible that all of this crafted ultracite was the guy's total collection throughout his entire playtime, which while an insane amount, is still feasible over several hundred hours if it is your primary focus.  If all of that was slowly transferred to a mule while it stacked up and was then transferred multiple times back and forth in bulk over a shorter time period, it could easily trigger such a flag.
---
As for the rest of the ammo, given my slow play style I still regularly gave away or dropped thousands or rounds of multiple ammo types simply because I always loot EVERYTHING.  The conventional ammo amounts seem perfectly reasonable to me for someone who just hoards everything they can.
---
Personally, I don't really care...What does annoy me is how much misrepresentation of the 'facts' we are seeing thrown around and how adamant people are about their opinions when they have no idea what actually happened.  
---
After reading through all of this dreck, many of the claims made by people, both defending and attacking, are pretty detached from the actual facts we know and make drastic assumptions about what is possible for one person to achieve over the course of hundreds of hours of gameplay, based solely on their personal experiences and gameplay styles.
---
If someone has played 900 hours and spent half of that time singularly and obsessively focused on farming a specific resource using optimal farming techniques, they could easily 'acquire' items in amounts that seem ridiculous to other players.
---
I want to buy cool looking skins for CAPS or have them DROP off of rare mobs.  Fuck this mtx shit.  
---
I heard about that 
---
The 900 hrs guy deleted his post?
---
at this point id rather have my money back honestly.... 
---
I don't think anyone knows the "truth" anymore, because this fight has twisted everybodys point of view, and this is civil war.
---
I'm actually tempted to get that Mothman PA Paint. I have the saved Atoms, and it is kind of cool looking! I really need to get back into the game again, I stopped a few weeks ago, and am actually starting to miss playing
---
No, still not working.
---
It absolutely does, just not in the way you are thinking. The percentage of your budget allocated to the items you craft decreases with your level, so you do in EFFECT get more space as you level up. But the percentage value for the items in your camp is determined at the time of creation. This means items you already built are static and do not see this savings. 
---
I can confirm 100% that you get more for your budget as you level up. 
---
One way I use to pop the always in caution is to go somewhere with a loading screen. Usually pops the lock.
---
It would be more nice if you found better ways to use your time online instead of bitching about a game you probably don't play anymore. Move on. We're doing just fine without you.

tbh, I've read both versions… googled it… and still in doubt.
---
For the moment I take the 2% increase in XP won for every point of INT (max 25) theory.
---
But I am open to someone shows me a serious test...
---
Well, there certainly does to be a movement towards setting up the debate as evil dupers vs. good Bethesda, when in reality neither of them are heroes and pretty much deserve each other at this point.  I mean Bethesda treated this game like an 18-wheeler full of beer that they intentionally jackknifed on a freeway and then got upset that people stole the scattered booze.  That was the inevitable outcome of your terrible planning.
---
So you guys still in denial that your game is a flop?
---
Yeah definitely... they probably broke every 2 or 3 uses. Cost me a fortune in rubber and oil. I can't remember how many I could fit but probably 4 or 5 sounds about right. They were lined up pretty close. The imgur link has some pics that might help.
---
Would you dupe me? I'd dupe me.
---
You might need glasses.
---
Oohoooo, i saved my atoms for thisss
---
I got falsely flagged by the autoban system in POE when I started playing last spring. Support had me sorted in under an hour. I'm sure Bethesda being a larger and much more profitable company will achieve similar results.
---
That loot sounds exactly the same as before lol. All of it useless except a legendary if you’ve done the queen more than 20-30 times.
---
They didn't change that.
---
Ethical is the word you're looking for. Not Moral. Borh are important though.
---
welcome to the club
---
good luck, i believe perfect storm is an automatic pistol, seeing as how its basically just a 10mm submachine gun
---
One for every occasion and mood !! Lol!! I’ve got my Nuke zone kinetic dynamo x-01 , x-01 jet pack with the blackbird paint and red tactical eyes to greet new players with , my nuka cola t-51 , ultracite, my t-60 brotherhood for running around helping low levels , my double calibrated excavator for those overencumbered blues and a few others when I’m feeling a change!! You know I love that power armor man don’t ever leave home without it!!
---
Cuz people bitch anywhere they are allowed to. Most of these posts would likely be removed from their forum.
---
right now it's "pooping on the dupers" tho
---
Absolutely!
---
You might have dropped the note that you get from the corpse.
---
I have done that by mistake on occasion while sorting my inventory out.
---
We shouldn't have to separate perks.  We should just be able to use a higher level perk as a lower level card.   Each card should have its Max Value and it's Used Value.   The Used Value can be anything from the Max Value or less.
---
Also passive skills that affect crafting should just use whatever your highest value is in a card regardless of whether it is equipped or not.   Active skills that are used in combat or to move around with benefits should have to be loaded in the current system.  Abilities like crafting an extra item or bonuses to crafting categories of stuff should just apply all the time regardless of whether the perk is loaded or not.   It is possible for a perk card to have both active and passive effects.  My argument is to have all the passive effects apply all the time and then you only have to manage the active effects.
---
awwright! Any highlights?
---
That makes sense. Thanks for linking. 
---
Also wrong, you become wanted as soon as you contest an owned workshop.
---
The email just says the items were "acquired", which could be interpreted as "new items only" but your theory makes sense. If you're right, wouldn't just dropping and picking up something repeatedly trigger their detection? If that's the case it may explain some of the false positive reports. Can't really be sure without clarification from Beth and they sure as heck aren't going to reveal specifics about their method.
---
It would be easy enough to prove, get 5k ultracite ammo and pass it back and forth with a friend 20 times, that would register as 100k and should trigger a ban. If it proves to be true, that detection method is seriously flawed.
---
Because it's misleading a new player. That's not very humorous.
---
Wikipedia:
---
&gt; A **straw man** is a form of argument and an informal **fallacy** based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this **fallacy** is said to be "attacking a **straw man**." 
---
You are ranting and raving like an absolute loon. My statement was directed to counter a statement that proposed the principle of limiting speech and had absolutely nothing to do with OP. I don't care who cheated. I don't care that the person who I replied to was replying to another person who was replying to OP. That's already 2 deviations from the logical leap you are making that I sympathize with OP. 
---
I was merely replying to someone who made a statement that put forth a principle of limiting critical discussion. Calm your role. You are acting churlish. I threw your straw man fallacy back at you because you clearly don't know how to separate the individual from the whole. My statement or 'argument' does not reflect on the opinion of OP or even the opinion of the person whom I defended. I was defending the principle of critical discussion and free speech. If you want people to sympathize with you then I suggest you take a less bombastic tone and learn grammar, punctuation, and capitalization to the utmost of your intellectual abilities and also apply your arguments to the proper individuals and opinions whom you think to counter. You continue to fool yourself thinking your arguments have anything to do with my short, original statement. Like I told the first person, grow up; adults generally propose rational thoughts and apply them to the appropriate place with attempting to limit the other person's speech so as to undermine their ability to express an opinion. You may continue ranting your non-sequitur beliefs and falsely applied 'points' but as of now I have lost interest and as far as 'me' is concerned it shall fall upon deaf ears. Good day.
---
Not necessarily as I said if you drop any  items it's added to the announcement acquired
---
The way it's counted is flawed.  
---
If you drop 10,000 bullets  pick it back up you've just acquired 20,000 
---
what is to stop them from getting another "$5 copy" and duping again? Penalties like that are the same as a ban- just make a new account and they are gone.
---
So you'd have to fine a workshop with a blockade to test this? Then it just allows you to ghost through the blockade?
---
Scarlet Lettering the dupers? Lol
---
Adrenal reaction is borked now
---
You have to cheat to get in, and your account WILL get banned.
---
When the cost of a key for the game has now dropped to 10$ or less, thats a cost that some people take. I am not going to be sharing how to do it.
---
Is there a fix for Adrenal Reaction coming?
---
I think it's not very funny to intentioanlly mislead a new player. 
---
Placing your camp in a far away local and crouching while at it is a good way to protect it. 
---
I fast travelled to 76 and it didn't work. Only relogging fixed it.
---
That doesn't make sense. Someone tries to claim it, needs to stand in the circle, but defender doesn't? If attacker kills then he respawns in seconds and... no progress?
---
well i wouldn't jump to conclusions just based on my write up.
---
my comment is based on a few things that we do not know for sure is fact. I was just letting the person i replied to know that his math didnt exonerate 900 hours guy. my comment assumes that the email 900 hour guy shared was real, that Bethesda's algorithm isn't flawed (specifically double-counting as mentioned in other comments below mine), and that the ammo was crafted. All 3 of these are unknown factors among many others, and while subjectively i err on the side of this being a duper hoax, objectively, i think there are too many unknowns to say one way or the other. we'll have to see if Bethesda makes a statement, or if more substantial evidence presents itself before making a final verdict imo.
---
They should make paints applicable to all armor types.  Same with power armor paints.  Where's the love for excavator, raider,  and ultricite?
---
That's just it, with this patch blockading no long works.
---
They can't get the basic game right and you want to add stuff?  I mean, yeah it would be nice.... but first thing first :)
---
No, I run a pretty straightforward rifle build, so it couldn't be that - my theory was they "adjusted" her difficulty to justify her dropping guaranteed loot now, but I wanted to ask around for some corroboration before jumping to any conclusions - it could have been a glitched encounter for all I know...
---
Seriously, I've a huge Fallout fan and was holding out on buying it until maybe Bethesda got their shit together, but god damn has this community turned toxic. This dude is completely thrown under the bus because of a vague email that doesn't say what everyone seems to think it does. Fuck that, no way I'd join this community now.
---
Yep.  Full out Scarlet Lettering.  Why not.  Let it be known.  It would be hilarious to boot.  I think the first thing I would do is open the map, look for "Wanted: Duper" and go to town on em.
---
Try sloth, fog crawler, death claw, behemoth, sentry bot
---
That’s good because he can’t understand your terribly worded statement.
---
Also if someone has a full sentinel set and didn’t realize this, they likely cheated to get it all and should just quit the game before Bugthesda bans them.
---
We'd have alcohol poisoning after about 3 minutes.
---
It's not one, single pvp server.
---
There's a whole host of them.
---
Meh. Months too late. O cant believe you people still follow this poece of shit. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Yeah but it more so seems unintentional. Does the logic a grenade launcher shaped like a shotgun allowing for familiarity with the feel of that weapon type not make sense to you? Also wondering if the wording of the perk card dawned on you "melee weapons swing faster" not "hand movements move faster" otherwise the reload buff from Speed demon would work on it too lol
---
They have ways of tying accounts together.  League does it all the time when they perma ban someone :)
---
I got pretty sick of it when there was a call for firing employees. Way too far, reddit. But then they're super offended if you say "99% of your gripes are solved by joining a team."
---
There's a lot of player behavior in this game that doesn't make sense to me- why did I meet a guy who's collected every single kind of stuffed animal in the game even though the rest of us are complaining about stash sizes? He said he believes we will be able to put things on display one day, that's why we are able to craft displays in our camps.
---
Personally my most used ammo is 50 cal because my bloodied explosive 50 cal is best for a queen fight, and I can go through 3-4k easily if she's not dead in under 10 minutes, and that's before they nerfed explosive damage. If I get below 15k ammo I consider it low and craft until I have about 60k, which should last me at least a week and only weighs 6lbs with bandolier 2. It takes less than 10 minutes to get what I need to craft that ammo.. I could craft less and just do it more often, but 6lbs isn't much to lose to have to do it less than once a week. I have a friend I met who's a trader on the market that likes to keep closer to 140k of each of the heavy ammo he uses- I asked him why, he said that's all he uses, why not?
---
If you want some tips on how to get materials to make a ton of ammo quickly, check my recent comments.
---
Why someone would want even more ammo than I keep on me I can't say, what I can say is if there's no point in crafting that much there's equally no point in duping that much, especially with how easy it is to craft at a moment's notice.
---
With how much setup there is to duping(at least the last time I saw the methods), along with how much time is involved each time they want to dupe with a high chance of the game crafting before they've duped anything- I think it's far more likely they would dupe more valuable things long before they got to **ammo**.
---

You're in the wrong genre. You want the Action RPG genre. I highly recommend giving [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/) a try.

I've been a fan since fallout 3 and have gone through all of the games since. I'm sitting on 1,145 hours on fallout 4 alone. Being a fan is what helped me put up with everything that was rough around the edges (and boy is there a lot hahahaha).

Yes it does do a pretty decent amount of damage, but it pales in comparison to where it was at before to the point that the bloodied tesla I found is once more outperforming this bad ass heavy weapon. 
---
Again, I put up a lot with this joint. We all do. I at least expect the loot aspect of a looter shooter to work. To have the hours spent acquiring these items feel like a smack in the face time and time again as a reward for my loyalty isn't a good feeling.
---
He can start a new character, so it's more like a fine for littering...
---
This is a quality, committed troll. I enjoy you.
---
The holotapes weren't bad in a group. Trying to read terminals however...
---
Does this cap off at a certain level?
---
&gt;*Workshops: You can now contest a Workshop that’s owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop’s build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it’s been barricaded by the owner.*
---
*sigh*
---
Damn it.
---
Happened to me too.  The note just vanished.  Had to hunt down the password again in its original location.  Then it happened again, so I just stopped doing the quest.
---
It could be that I'm dropping it somewhere, but I doubt it.  I think it's bugged.
---
That's all I'm sayin too man. I didn't cheat, just got caught grabbing scattered booze man. No where in the EULA did it say that if i interacted with an item from someone who broke the eula, whether knowing or not, I'd be treated as a breach of contract. 
---
CHOPPIN THAT MEAT
---
Thanks, guys. Good efforts.
---
He's just trolling you. No one in their right mind actually thinks like that haha.
---
With so many refrigerators in the wasteland, you'd think that some clever campers would be able to get one working again.  IMHO, refrigerators to store aid items with condition meters is a must have.   
---
Mothman week, who gives a shit, I want bug fixes, not bug celebrating, what in the fuck is wrong with you people.
---
I think the plates SHOULD kill the attacker but not mark you for wanted.
---
In theory yes, I agree they should not be revealing specifics. However, if the email from the original 900 hours post is to be believed, then they did reveal a specific.
---
I'm more looking for an assurance that if someone is flagged for crafting 100,000 ammo in 30 days, a human will quickly review the situation and be able to undo the ban because this scenario is quite possible.
---
Well you kinda have to when the email contains "no appeals will be considered" 
---
I've noticed the same with the behemoth near Twin Lakes. Killed him and his corpse disappeared, and was floating in the lake where he spawns in. Couldn't loot it.
---
Call me a sadist, but I've always been tempted to drop a nuke right there at the beginning. Welcome to the New World Order, bitches!
---
That way lies danger. linking to IP is about the only way to do that, and most providers are using dynamic IP. easy to get a new IP. Banning all of a provider means collateral damage.
---
I'm not a fan of POE. I'm a Diablo III player for LIFE tho.
---
pm me or hmu on discord @ Ocean Slim #4898.
---
Luck of the draw stopped repairing it for me, so I stoped using it in favor of my lever action. I'd be happy to sell it to an enthusiest. 
---
Honestly, it says very little that we didn't already know (and largely expected).
---
People exploited bugs, and got banned.  I'm sure there's a few in there that got hit accidentally (picking up stiff that they didn't create/dupe themselves), but they're a small minority.
---
Honestly, the only part I didn't expect was that they're saying the ban is temporary.  That surprises me quite a bit.
---
Slightly less surprised by the implication that it only affects people that hit that 100K mark (though Beth may not track item IDs as much as other games I'm familiar with).  I'd expected some sort of sanction on anyone in possession of a duped item, but if they don't assign (yet) unique IDs to certain drops, that is probably not feasible.
---
Yeah, I’m tired of looking like a poor mans Bumblebee. I need camo paint, I need hot rod paint, I need all black everything paint. Gib paint!
---
How can you cheat to get armor?
---
I mean, even with that, they can still just get the game again under another account. An IP ban would be better imo 
---
But for the record, it's a really weird, bizarre minority of players. 
---
The problem is sentinel gear works while you’re jumping in place also, so while you’re struggling to target me with your 50 cal, I will have killed you in 2-3 hits in your super squishy power armor. But hey, good effort.
---
Don't lie to me.
---
Is it? No texture would not affect collision boxes right? It would just make it purple. I can go right through that and I've seen other people's camps with the same people.
---
Not that I have witnessed. My base at 50 was smaller than my base at 80, which was smaller than my base at 120 which was smaller than my base at 160.
---
If there is a hard or soft cap, I have not yet reached it. But deleting everything in your camp is the key. Also, in my testing, turrets appear to be close to static at all levels, or at least take way more than they should throughout the progression.
---
I don't use turrets and haven't since around level 20, but I do test them out for budgetary concerns with each rebuild and they are budget hogs every time. 
---
u/Valseek
---
Still no fix for the union / confederate hats being uncraftable even after learning the plan off the reenactor random event?
---
yeah.  before they were giving us 5 minutes warning, but still, give a specific time, so i KNOW when it is to come far in advance, and i can plan my play time around that specific time.  
---
it is NOT that hard.  every other online game i play has server maint. times posted, IF they have them at all.
---
servers are becoming more stable as beth fixes the problems causing server hiccups.
---
i like the idea, if a server is empty, do your maint.!!
---
there is just NO reason to suddenly say, this server needs rebooting.  so what if there are 12 people in it. 
---
it is just laziness.
---
Gotcha! No need to imply. It was totally fabricated. Like many other claims.
---
My favorite was the guy claiming he got discoing red 43 times in one play session. But refused to say how long that session was. Because when you do the math, even an 8 hour long session would mean he got to play on average 11 minutes. He wants us to believe he sat there 8 hours doing that?
---
No problem. I love getting kicked in the nuts.
---
Best part is that I lost my original set 2 months ago thanks to a glitch.
---
I had the same issue, disabling the mod fixes it
---
Seems kind of dangerous. Why would someone risk being banned and then being called a duper or cheater if they tried what you said?
---
I mean that one guy wrote guides, reported exploits and reported dupers and yet people are witch hunting him like crazy for being banned for this exact reason.
---
That's exactly my point.
---
To be honest, I don't have a good feeling about what they're actually going to do to "fix" heavy and energy weapons after these last couple of banana in the tailpipes.
---
Boring missionary sexx
---
He understood it just fine, he was just being pretentious.  Just like understood what he said and was being sarcastic. 
---
&gt; You get a pass
---
Thanks boss, er chief. Anything else we can get passes on here?
---
I don’t see how melee is broken but sneak part of it might be and vats. So is the rifle perks. And many more. 
---
It's a hentai thing. 
---
"Uwu p-put it in me senpai" and all that stuff. 
---
Interesting, I was curious because I only have 2. I have a Raider one which I can take more damage, I use it in high level enemy areas, I also have the excavator which I use when I an grabbing materials.
---
It does do that the go passive and watch you kill there friends, and when they can't take the sight of it anymore they go back to hostile and try to kill you.
---
What I was understanding is there is no circle around the red workstation anymore, the entire workshop build area is the circle and either playing being inside of it will be contesting.
---
At least your honest 
---
Ok.  I'll bite.
---
What game do you work on so we can try it out and see how much better it is? 
---
Suppose we will need your name as well, and proof.
---
That was the most ordinary of ways to insert your foot into your mouth.
---
he outed himself as soon as he posted that email, you're right. 
---
What do you think that quote was in reference to!??!?!  Do some freaking research.
---
Duping
---
Actually this patch is pretty good. I would say at least it’s a good start. Last patch is way worse. 
---
You guys fixed reactive plates wrong, it SHOULD kill your attacker they attacked you your plates did there job. It SHOULD NOT make you wanted.
---
Interesting... I can't pretend to have the technical knowledge to say whether this is what's happening, but I will definitely bring it up with people who do! Thanks very much, I appreciate the added info.
---
If I try to fast travel too soon after logging in this happens. Try waiting till the game finishes loading or back out of your map and try again. 
---
Melee is far stronger than guns, that being said you can still one shot a player from a mile away with a bloodied sniper/hunting rifle/lever action. Well... Not without adrenal reaction. Even without it though it seems like bloodied does far less on it's own.
---
no kidding.  can not please all the people all the time.
---
the fact remains, telling 12 players that the server is being rebooted for maint. is just asinine.  
---
given a specific time, 99.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% of people will plan their play time around that fact.
---
the other .00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001, oh well.
---
Is there any way we can gain the ability to repair structures in the camp BEFORE they are completely destroyed?  Because, not only for griefing purposes, but also after fighting off a higher level attack you might have some badly damaged defenses and or walls, but they haven't been destroyed.  Short of storing them (which might be difficult for structural walls/items with other things attached to them) and replacing them, there is currently no way to repair them except to wait for the next attack, which will almost certainly destroy them.  Same with things like badly damaged but not quite destroyed turrets/stairs/etc....
---
You can't dupe nothing.
---
No.  Explosives are a great way to tag enemies ans still let other players get hits on the too in blast zones.  However, due to the bouncing effect it has on corpses, I'd suggest using Molotov Cocktails.  More precise anyway since they explode on impact, not on a timer.
---
Fuck the haters, you're doing God and Cthulhu's work.
---
Your drastically better off just building sets from scratch.  I ran a mix of trapper and leather until ~45.  Now that you can just buy plans it's more practical as well to have matching sets.
---
I’ve noticed an across the board decrease in damage for my weapons, I’m a melee/unarmed and Heavy Weapons build, and after logging in today there were *significant* decreases in weapon damage (my power fist does about 60-70 less damage, my Bunker Buster does about 90 less). If this was an intended balance fix, I have to ask why considering Heavy Weapons have consistently been underpowered in the meta, and melee/unarmed comes with the drawback of, yknow, needing to be up close and therefore being useless to flying/elevated enemies
---
I actually have been wondering if the wording was misunderstood yet again, and they meant that they won’t be unbanned till Bethesda can figure out how to remove all their ill gotten items. Seems a bit silly to go so far as to ban them then let them back in after merely shutting off the tap. What about the flood that’s still there?
---
Guess we’ll see soon!
---
The drama on this sub is so funny
---
Still need to be able to rename armor!!!!!
---
How about using their selected avatars as low level raiders we can kill.  Repeatedly.  That's as close as we'll get to a public flogging.
---
That's an issue with one of your mods. Add these to your Fallout76custom.ini, right after sResourceArchive2list=
---
I had the same issue.
---
I understand the gist of your counter argument but none of them works with the same logic as how similar faster swinging and faster cranking are. Shotguns don't feel like grenade launchers for example(as ex military I know from experience).
---
Also, I assume theres much more they could be fixing in this joint that "fixing" something that renders yet another weapon useless hahahahahha
---
Thank you appreciate it 
---
THX FOR HELP - WORKS!!!!
---
That's actually inaccurate, my brother got banned and he didn't log in for more than a month.
---
He got what was coming to him. I told him to stop that shit.
---
I'm not,  however could you set up a new character to get the rec day one? 
---
Says the guy making a post just to invite more drama
---
is this because of the mothman stuff? because it's cool and all, but not something I'd use. too tacky.
---
still want blackbird back, though. with a new x01 helmet to go with it, without the brahmin skull.
---
Can you mix and match armor sets? I have x01 armor with t60 legs.
---
Holy shit this thread is so cringy
---
I posted on another thread a compromise.
---
At lvl 50 and every 25 levels afterwards, we get a free re-spec to be used then or at a future time.
---
This should be implemented retroactively as well.
---
Any item above a certain height threshold will do this.  I've had it happen with PA stations (only the one with the big arms though), plants, power connecters (and their switched versions) fusion power generators....probably medium as well although I haven't tried those in a while, and I'm sure there are other things that I'm forgetting.  Oh, the chimneys are notorious for this!!  
---
Basically, anything that normally sits a certain distance away from the floor above it can and will have this behavior.  I haven't tested the full set of items or the exact threshold, but from the examples there you should be able to get a decent idea of it.
---
Actually..... They do
---
In my situation Riot was (still is) a hugely successful company. It took them close to a week to sort everything out. I'll give Bethesda some leniency (for now), being that they are new to this multiplayer thing. I don't want to blindly support them, nor all the claims of false bans. But I'm trying to have faith that those who were actually falsely banned will be reinstated, and that Bethesda is on top of their investigations. 
---
Again, terrible word choice. And obviously, since the entire basis of the definition of dupe is to have something to start with. My my you’re very intelligent aren’t you.
---
Take a chill pill, my man. Screaming on a subreddit won’t solve your inner problems. 
---
Yeah, the issue isn't that the mod is changing visual effects. It's that, by using a Fallout76custom.ini, you are overwriting the default "sResourceArchive2list" section. This patch modified that section to add "SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2". Since you're using a custom ini, your version doesn't include those so the changed values mean you get wonky behavior. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but I can easily get 70 Raw violet Flux in a SBQ Zone with green thumb on. Just letting you know if you wanted to update this.
---
You just have to enter the area to contest
---
It's not duping, it's alternative crafting!
---
I felt the the same thing. I think it should work like how it was if you use radical and plague Walker with it. They over correct somethings that are great. Too many cry babies. (Honestly I didn’t know it was a thing but since plague walker doesnrt work that I can tell it would be nice to keep it buffed. 
---
Yup. One of my clan mules was banned. Over 10 players feeding materials makes it totally possible to obtain the amount needed to be flagged. Shame they used such a horrible method to ban players. 
---
Make it xbox only tbh seeing as i know you're on that platform :)
---
From my understanding yes. You can equip different sets on the same frame. The mothman paint works for t45 t51 t60 and x01 armors.  So you wouldn't have an issue with your armor choices and this paint set.
---
Should have been different types of storage for stackable or not.  Let stackable storage hit 1k or greater and maybe a weapon/armor stash that does count instead of weight.
---
They can find unique identifiers in the hardware of a computer.
---
it took me a while too... like 5-6 server hops but I eventually got it.  Also, keep the circuit boards you get from scrapping the assaultron blades and put them in stash before accidentally scrapping them, you'll need it for helmet.
---
You're wasting your time.  The dude played a month ago today.  If you look through his posting history, he has had probably 20-25 TSEs lol.  But nope.  He doesn't dupe!  
---
I am on ps4.  I got them a while back.  Not sure how to find them now.  I can make what ever you need or upgrade.  Just need to supply the plastic.  I will be on in about 4 hours.
---
Got to agree with you, the Gatling Plasma is totally useless currently, how hard is it to simply increase the durability of these types of weapons. 
---
You can work on the damage etc later, make them actually useful now!
---
It’s been that way forever, it bugs me so much. But I assume it’s so minor we will never see a fix.
---
I didn't know that the queen didn't count as a scorchbeast, kinda makes a prime receiver more of a nuisance.
---
I leave my entire house and purifiers unlocked. If somebody needs to craft or repair something, or scrap and store, or are just thirsty, why should I say no? And if you’re worried about the extractor, why not just slap a level 3 lock on that?
---
Nah. That guy was a cheat. People need to stop defending his dumb actions. 
---
Sadly some people get in a rush and click the take all button befor seeing what's all in it xD
---
Then fuckin leave
---
How is that the problem? You are making an error comparing this to speeding, because speeding is a known rule. Nothing the OP did here went against any written or unwritten rule, so it is comparing apples to oranges with speeding.
---
&gt;Its bethesda. This is not a professional sport with a rulebook. If you do things they dont want you to do, you get banned. 
---
Sure they can ban you for no reason, but that doesn't mean people aren't also well within their rights to call them out for shitty practices if they do. Just like witht he whole lootbox fiasco with lunchboxes.
---
&gt;Would it be nice if they were more clear about every little reason? Maybe, or maybe it would just give guys like that "acceptable" ways to cheat.
---
If they are going to ban people for things that are deemed perfectly fine in every other online game? Yeah they better have it written down that it is against their rules. Because as it stands, the only people in the wrong here is bethesda if they banned that guy just for trading him ammunition to one of his other accounts to save weight.
---
The fact you think that it is okay for them to ban people that haven't broken any of their stated rules and played the game like you would play any other online multiplayer game seems more like you just have some sort of grudge against the OP.
---
they were out yesterday, but thanks.
---
It's scary just how toxic this community is getting. I can't wait for the next ban wave to catch a bunch of these people going at 900 hour guy for being a liar, only for them to find that nobody will stand up for them when they are the innocent one getting screwed over next time.
---
please allow the skins already in the atom shop to be applied to excavator. i've bought a few already in hopes to apply them to excavator armor at some point.
---
Had this problem, removed ALL mods, problem STILL there, reinstalled mods and added what you said and now it works with mods... wth..
---
That was definitely my position during my ban. I got no communication from support except a follow to my ticket saying "this decision is final," until I got an email saying my ban had been lifted almost a full week after the ban. We'll just have to see how this all plays out.
---
I had this and switched between 1st and 3rd person and it seemed to fix it.
---
The previous owner left the game world 
---
Sorry I was late
---
Don't waste your time on a troll. That dude is nothing but a troll, check his post history.
---
Update on this following some initial investigation:
---
* If you had acquired this mutation prior to today's patch, it will not apply its positive effects correctly. If you re-acquire the mutation now that the patch is out, it should work as intended.
---
* Also, for those with Bloodied weapons that aren't applying their bonuses correctly, this should be corrected after you unequip/re-equip that weapon. 
---
As someone that tinkered with weight glitch, it's the non stackable items and not the weight that burns ya.
---
methinks OP got fucked for duping and is throwing a hissy
---
If a patch that addressed a handful of bugs and added a handful more, that took a triple A game studio two weeks to put out is “pretty good” to you, I’d hate to see what you actually think is bad.
---
But keep up that mentality and you’ll be playing this game in 2020 with the same bugs you have now, broken energy weapons, and still 1 raid boss.
---
The screenshot was taken without a Fallout76Custom.ini and a buddy of mine saw the camp in the same state as I see it, so I doubt it's client side. 
---
Sound advise. Not worth the Risk, unless you didn't care about the account like you say. 
---
They need to make sure duping is secure in their next online game; because people won't be so naive next time with the separate accounts. Bethesda should be careful 
---
Go away troll, no one wants you here.
---
One after another, all your shits will be nerft to sea level. Mark my words. 
---
That is a good idea, but then again I want it to be as inclusive as possible. I'll leave that job to someone else to create a sub Reddit for the single platforms. Nice idea, nonetheless
---
What platform are you on? I could get on tonight and give you mine or go to where one spawns and see if it’s there if you’re on pc. 
---
I think one spawns near thw Charlie silo at that mountain spa place
---
Lmao, you're really angry about this aren't you? Grow the hell up, kid. Bethesda themselves replied and confirmed that he was cheating. 
---
How dumb are you? 
---
Check his history guys. He said 40 days ago that he was 500+ hours in. He seems completely legitimate to me.  This subreddit just conforms to whatever the popular opinion is at the time. Rn it’s to bash the banned. I’m positive there are some false positives in the bunch
---
Sometimes I feel like this game runs on Witchcraft and not code.
---
Do you think the dreaded October update to Windows 10 may be a factor?
---
Beta characters seen to break achievements.  Just create a new character and play through all the achievements you are missing.
---
They certainly could, and it would put this whole situation to rest. But until that happens I'm not buying it, even if only 1% of the bans were unjust that 1% needs to be rectified.
---
Sorry only on PS4 but thank you for the offer 
---
Anything yet?
---
That or he’s an actually not all there 
---
Had a similar issue with grounded.  My class freak had no effect on the mutation.  And its a harsh one.
---
&gt;These accounts have been suspended from Fallout 76 until this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once a fix is live, we will reactivate these accounts and notify the owners that they can access the game again
---
[From Bethesda](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323527/regarding-this-account-is-not-authorized-4-8-2000-messages-on-login?language=en)
---
(Believe it or not at your own peril)
---
Why are you mad right now? 
---
Ok thank your will go there to 
---
I'm guessing you have tried Display Driver Uninstaller?
---
Other than that I don't know. I had an unrelated issue with my PC a while ago that I couldn't find a fix for. What fixed it was updating my bios. If you do try that, be very careful and make sure you know how to do it beforehand.
---
Right back at you
---
Right, well you clearly think you're better than me.  Tell me how could you cheat to get a set of armor through duping.  You seem to know more than me, where do you get the original items?
---
I think it depends on the definition of "no reason"
---
Still a bug where I cant see any team invites in game and have to restart my game till I see one when invited at the main menu which means have to repeatedly restart my game for me to be able to join any of my friends
---
Check [my topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asdui1/did_anyone_else_notice_a_slight_discoloration_of/) for the answer.
---
"Can you hear me now?! So he asked himself: could there be a mark that made it clear (visually on a page) that something is both a question and an exclamation?!"
---
No, that tiny thing won't do that. It looks like a question mark.
---
Where did he imply he wrote that before he was banned? He even said now that he was banned he had enough time to write the guide. 
---
squished and shrunkin down. area I live in does not even exist in game. never heard of a grafton monster or snallygaster before this game and always thought a wendigo was a native american myth to warn against cannibalism in times of famine.
---
problem with automation and mining jobs vanishing is frightening accurate if overblown with scifi robots.
---
Thank you.    I'm \*not\* saying that this is the only way this happens...   I want to make sure I was clear in saying that this is one way that it does happen that might not be immediately obvious until these added details are explained.  Looks like someone else replied and had this happen with the Behemoth that has a dedicated spawn location. 
---
There may be other ways that a corpse disappears, but one way for sure is that the mob respawned back in its "home location".
---
After a few weeks of reading around I found an article stating Austin hub is a “freshly fired” team picked up from another company’s discard basket. Not sure if there is any truth behind this but if so it would make some sense. 
---
I mean you're mad because you did something you knew was wrong, got caught, and got punished? 
---
I am running 1803!  The truth is that I decided to update to the October 1809, something screwed up and thought I should just go back to 1803.  So all of this is my own fault.  I didn't need to update to 1809, but I wanted to... and now my PC feels ruined.
---
No, the mods did, which is why it said removed instead of deleted.
---
This is exactly how I got wanted...I had no intention of pvp...I just waited near some folks and surrendered myself to their claim, after dumping my stuff at home first.  But still, an unnecessary annoyance.  
---
This practice is causing people to access endgame content by simply going to a website and obtaining nuke codes. Also their is a exploit used to bypass the silo using Power Armor to come up through the roof on top of the crates just past the area where the keycard is required to enter. This exploit also needs to be examined and appropriate action needs to be taken against all players who have used this to launch nukes.
---
If exploits are to be treated the same these should be treated with the same intensity as all other exploits that cause an unfair advantage or playing the game in an unintended fashion.
---
I thought right after launch there was a freebie on there but I can’t remember what it was. Could be thinking of another game however. 
---
Hope they don't ban me I filed a support ticket with an essay hopefully they don't do the same to me I have put 300 in atoms not because I needed it but because I wanted to love this game I'm worried now...
---
800 is less than unlimited. Looks like there is still no reason for me to log back in.
---
Wish this was posted two nights ago. Found one with my girlfriend but sold it
---
He didn't delete his post, the mods did. That is why it says (removed) instead of (deleted).
---
Dude, you duped when they clearly stated they were banning dupers.
---
Get fucked, you got what you deserved.
---
2-3 queens per day, some trading and you'll get 100k ultracite 5mm or .50 **over 30 days**. Ok, probably you used 80% of it in battles but still it counted against your limit ... you don't have to own 100k at once.
---
Well then yes, you are right that isn't against the TOS in and of itself.
---
Did you find the exact comment they are talking about? Not sure if they offered other details like what level they got the char too etc.
---
If they said I got a char to level 50 with just grenades, I'd say they did something to get grenades outside of regular gameplay based on the sheer amount it would take.
---
Bye
---
This has been posted for every single patch lol
---
I had been playing for a of couple hours when the happened. No loading had happened in some time.
---
Mountainside Bed and Breakfast basement, every time I go there there is one in the basement by the tinkerers workbench. Good hunting!
---
And how exactly are we supposed to re-apply it? Go Russian Roulette with Radaways and hope that Adrenal is the first to go? Seriously.
---
Most containers take a day or two to resupply
---
As in I have seen people get banned for crafting to many items or being overencumbered cause I take all the junk craft it into something and sell it to a vender for caps
---
Dupers are still around, go look on ebay. TSE packs are still for sale, same with serums.
---
I see. is there a hotfix planned for people who have already acquired the mutation? or is re-acquiring the mutation the suggested fix?
---
thank you for the attention.
---
&gt;Considering there a real world AR-15 that shoots soda cans,
---
That reminds me, I miss the junk launching gun from F04. It wasn't particularly powerful, but there was something so satisfying about shooting super mutants in the face with teddy bears.
---
Unsure, this has happened on a regular basis as of late. Server hop with the same results multiple times since the last patch. 
---
I will be playing more today since 1.0.6 is out. 
---
Hopefully this will be resolved.
---
If you and your buds are looking for some squad based online shooter fun, give The Division a try.  It's on sale pretty much everywhere right now and it really is amazing going back to it after grinding out FO76, the storytelling, missions, matchmaking system is so well tuned.
---
Plus lots of endgame content.
---
No, no one is being banned for 'no reason'.  There have been reasons stated.
---
Don't exploit, and try your best not to benefit from other people exploiting.  You'll be fine.
---
This is easier to fix than you think. All you have to do is, build a time machine, go back before you turned into a duper, and smack yourself. Then, when you return, you'll have a healthy, legitimately gained account!
---
Did you make these? This is GOLD.
---
Im mad because Bethesda said we can write an essay to get unbanned. Some of my team mates got the same mail but with one difference. They can play again after the fix! They duped mir then hundred times more items and still can play. THIS isn’t fair. This fucking Game was my Christmas gift and I played it over 200h
---
first one here is post

here is post history

---
literally the first one i looked at
---
claimed never duped or traded, shows heavy activity with legendaries serums etc
---
What difference does it make? Trying to understand how this would influence your decision making.
---
l8r t8r
---
Good riddance. 
---
Mutation serums are so cheap to buy from players that I'd just start clearing them. You could wait months before Bethesda bothers fixing Empath.
---
They weren't hits, it was a steady burn. No, I wasn't on fire. 8)
---
It was like radiation but it was eating my armor too. /u/thatlukeguy below suffered the same thing. I was wondering if it was a Mothman thing? 
---
That's not the point. Not everyone plays the way you do. If he wants to use a system to restrict access to something, that's his decision. Some people like really complicated homes setups that might be more interesting visually. 
---
Unlimited storage for every player is illogical given that this is a server-based game
---
I know there's a youtube channel that posts them regularly.
---
You're probably right. Only logical answer.
---
it pairs well with the Traveling Leather Coat, as it was intended to be a standard raider outfit in Fallout 4. http://www.monkeymods.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Leather-Coat-Recolors-by-Frictionfactor-5.png
---
i have read about the mining in WV.  "The Company Store"  those were some BAD times for miners.  being indebted to TCS.  then they would take all your stuff.  i believe there was even gunfights and such.  pinkertons!!!  lol  HATE 'EM!!
---
but thanx for the input.
---
I checked Watoga vendors and the train car north of Watoga station, no dice for me there.
---
I have an extra bos arm or leg plan can't remember which that you can have if you're on Xbox. I'll be on after 5pm  
---
I gotta side with you on this. It's almost like a low budget soap opera, with a real shitty cast. 
---
It would go great with my legendary Quad Double Barrel Shotgun. [It reminds me of this.](https://bioshock.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_(Rapture)?file=2BarrelShotgun-2.jpg)
---
All in all a very solid set of notes.  There are some specific things however that concern me immensely:
---
&gt;**Wanted:** We’ve made an adjustment so that players must now destroy objects in another player’s C.A.M.P. or Workshop to become Wanted, which should reduce cases of accidental crime.
---
I can see this quickly and easily being abused....because I already had someone do it to me, or try to, before this change.  The guy wandered by and wanted to see inside my base. So I invited him in.  He proceeded to pull out a shotgun and start shooting things.  Quickly he became wanted....but he didn't DESTROY anything.  I killed him for it.  He respawned and tried to start destroying my camp again.  I decided to leave...didn't want to deal with that....but its a valid example of what people will do.  What I expect to see happen is someone will damage as much as they can reach/hit without destroying anything to avoid getting a little wanted at all....then pull out some explosives and destroy EVERYTHING quickly.  They'll get a huge bounty, but it will let them quietly plunk away at things a bit at a time without getting a map flag before BOOM your base is simply gone.  Either that or they'll go after defensive structures and outer walls, not quite destroying them...then laugh when your base gets attacked next and you lose all your primary defenses almost immediately, letting the inner pieces (often times more expensive ones) of the camp be attacked directly.  
---
&gt;**Workshops:** You can now contest a Workshop that’s owned by another player from anywhere inside the Workshop’s build area, which should make it easier to attempt to contest a Workshop, even if it’s been barricaded by the owner.
---
I understand why this was done seeing as I've myself sealed off the Ammo Factory and prevented anyone from getting inside without becoming wanted first.  But at the same time, I feel that "hiding in a corner in full chameleon/stealth boy" and capping the workshop when they finally get so frustrated that they give up and leave because they can't find you.....is going to become a thing.  Either "hiding" should stop the counter from moving, meaning you CANNOT take the workshop from stealth (and revealing you on the map)....or you in some way need to lock down the location of the capturing player, preventing this behavior.  And I will flat out state...this is EXACTLY how I would do it.  Get yourself into the most hidden place you can, toss on a stealth-boy, or make sure chameleon is active, maybe even place a few plasma or nuke mines even,....THEN start capping the WS.  Plenty of frustration for the people trying to hunt you down.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing there is a more efficient or smarter or funner way to level up then button mashing.
---
The issue is people are dumbasses and do dumb irrational stuff all the time.
---
To argue that no one would dupe ammo or waste time getting few XP at a time is kinda pointless. There are examples of people doing it.
---
That sucks. I remembered where the password was - it’s at the Cow Spots Creamery, so I just fast traveled there and grabbed it.
---
I like the idea of preventing dupers from doing something they are bound to complain about, but minor to the rest of us.  Then, when they post their complaints here, we can have a good chuckle about it.
---
My beta character (which is my main character) self taken pictures from the picture mode does not work properly. It actually does not take a picture at all or stores it on my pc as far as I can tell from the locale folder it should save it....not a big deal but I had a few “firsts” in there that have never shown.
---
As of now you can jump and the effect still works. You can’t be staggered mid-air.
---
With all the people getting banned, I havent even logged on because im afraid, my friend who is high level has given me over 2000 308 round. I asked him if it was duplicated but he said no. Guess we will find out eventually. Anyone know how long the ban is ??  
---
"I broke the rules and was punished for it, it's not fair!"
---
My Brother lives in WV and Im in VA , So I have driven through vast tracts of WV.  
---
The ones that feel truly on spot is Whitesprings, Seneca rocks, harpers Ferry, Camden Park, and Berkley Springs.
---
Spruce knob feels rather right but there is no big domed overlook area - but it feels \*AUTHENTIC\* because they copied the overlook from Clingman's Dome (in the Smokey Mountains)  which feels very 50' - 60's  architecture.   
---
Sometimes kids break the toys they get for Christmas.  Should have taken better care of your toys.
---
I am still currently banned. I unsubbed from here. If I do get back on I'm only gonna post on filthy casuals. I'm done with this subreddit. People suck.
---
I hope I haven't missed any cool limited time offer stuff. I've been desperately waiting for a pump action shotgun skin.
---
Yes you can, but not Atom store stuff. Someone gave me a large generator and now a fusion generator. I don't have plans for either one. He just needs to make sure not to scrap it and he will be able to move it and set it up when he moves his camp. 
---
I had one last night. Got bored of running around with it, in mechanics overalls and a sack hood with straps. Dropped it in a suitcase outside pleasant valley station. Dang thing weighs 12 lbs.
---
Man, I was al excited about a video guide. Then I googled it. 
---
I had a TSE before the nerf.  Bought it for 10k caps.  
---
I had about 20k shotgun ammo.  Do you know how much I had of the other stuff?  None.  Why would you keep 50 cal ammo when you clearly don't use it.  I was one shotting everything but the Queen.  What other reasoning is there to keep 100k rounds of shit you dont need?  Unless you are duping for buddies.  
---
Its all just suspect as hell.  On top of this, the guy stated that he never has anything over 36k yet here he is with 6 different items that he had that were 100k.  Im not saying it couldn't be done legit.  What I am saying is this guy didn't do it legit.
---
Ranger station above Watoga. Grabbed a couple from the shed out back. 
---
Again....you did something you knew youd get busted for. And when you did you want people to feel sorry for you? Any game for the last 5-10 years has usually banned people who have found game breaking bugs. So why would you expect anything different once they figured it out and came out with a fix?
---
No pump skin yet 
---
That is my next task.  One thing that is different between pre-reformat and now is I was using a version of Nvidia drivers that was 2 or 3 versions out of date.  So I can try that version. 
---
Thanks for you suggestion.
---
Also I have updated BIOS recently... but it would certainly not be on my list of possible causes.  Maybe I am being naive, it just doesn't seem like that kind of problem.  Feels more like a software issue to me.
---
Feel free to correct me :).
---
Thanks again.
---
No it’s like if you get life sentence for stealing a snickers!
---
Everyone coming up with excuses for the guy focuses on a single part of the puzzle. There's only 720 hours in 30 days, and the game isn't even available for all of them due to downtime for patches. Even if he had no life, no job, and no responsibilities because he lives in his parent's basement and can dedicate 12 hours a day to playing, that's only 360 hours to farm with. Sure, he could theoretically farm that much of any one rare ingredient in 30 days, but there's no way he could farm enough of all of them. 
---
Saw his name in the credits that roll when you beat E.T. on Atari so he obviously knows what he's talking about. Lay off the guy.
---
you can still get syringers and drills. that's a much bigger problem.
---
wood armor is actually the best armor in the game for sneaking.
---
I am on xbox. I should be on around 6pm central time 
---
They also left drills in the legendary loot. These assholes are so fucking incompetent. How long have these things been reported? It's one thing if they're ignored entirely, but to fix one single item and not another is laughable.
---
Wahhhh
---
Just remember that sometimes people are not truthful in their explanations. Just play honest. 
---
How did you fast travel while in caution?
---
There's an American saying 'dont do the crime, if you cant do the time.'  basically actions have consequences.
---
If a banker leaves a stack of cash on a table in the waiting area,  it is not their fault that you decided to steal it. 
---
You live and you learn.  Sometimes it can be painful. 
---
You're confirming nonsense - a couple people went through the effort of doing complete scrap and rebuild with characters in the 20s, 50s, 70s, 100s and confirmed that it's all in people's heads. Budget (and most certainly build radius) do not increase with level.  There's no mechanic for it in the game, and no repeatable example to the contrary.
---
And you cheated and are paying the price. Boo-fucking-hoo
---
We had two people craft 30k ammo at once. Still playing. Those people are fulla shit.
---
Ive needed it every time....
---
It isn't stupid when you can only sell certain junk to vendors WHEN bulked. Can make a hell of a lot of caps from it too.
---
Generally, you'll find it for sale at thr various Raider vendors.
---
Read more into it, the problem is BSG doesn't do a very good job with counting the ammo. They only count it when you put it in your inventory, so with him switching it to and from mules multiple times ends up multiplying the actual amount of ammo he has.
---
He says he only has 36k ammo max which is well within reach of someone who plays for 900 hours and has a level 450+ character. The problem though is that if he puts it on his alt then that 36k turns into 72k in BSG's counting algorithm. He switches that a couple times and that 36k ends up looking like a LOT more than he actually has.
---
They already cleared that up that an essay isn't going to just unban you. Do more research, the information is out there
---
Ok heading there now
---
"Me and my friends killed that guy but the police said if I told on them it would be easier. Why am I in jail!"

Do you not understand the concept of a false positive?
---
It’s happened to me a lot recently.  Killed a 3 star legendary deathclaw at WS the other night and totally disappeared.  Sucks 
---
I haven't heard anything yet but nothing so far. The succulent plants are a good atom price and it fills that void for me. 
---
You have eggs following you around?   Yoshi island style?
---
It'll take you less time to just make a new character. And that might not ever get patched.
---
I had to make a new character to get a handful of quest trophies and the level 10 trophy. Took about an hour all together. Pretty easy since you've done it before.
---
Ah ok musta read that wrong
---
There’s no chemistry bench in Emergency Services.
---
That would be fixed with a probability equation based on the slide's value, with an RNG component tied to the multiplier. That would actually be the most efferent as well, since instead of calling the RNG function 100 times, you call it once and apply the findings to the equation. 
---
What nonsense are you babbling. Sharing nuke codes was talked about by Todd himself at launch and subsequent events
---
In the mail they don’t write I can play again when the issues are fixed. They wrote my account is permanently suspended. 
---
Before release.
---
Lmao. I love when jerks get what they deserve, they abuse low levels simply because they can, and think they can get away with it. You did an amazing deed. Keep it up. I'm friends with a low level *who just so happens to be my best friend of 8 years* and I can't stand when people who are like 5 times his level *level 39* attack him for some stupid reason. I tend to attempt to one shot them, with my shotgun, or my handmade. A bunch of the time, though, they either take no damage, somehow, or they immediately regen health. 
---
Everybody please downvote this guy into oblivion
---
Oh, totally dangerous, and the only confirmation you get is a ban. That said, if I were to test it, recording the process on video and then got banned for passing items back and forth with a friend, my lawyer would have a field day writing a letter to Bethesda on my behalf.
---
I like the fact they are cracking down and taking exploits seriously and am not convinced the theory is correct, but if it is, Bethesda needs to tweak their detection on this ASAP. 
---
Maybe u/Valseek can share the theory with the devs and see if they think it might be a problem. I don't want to know specifics on the detection methods as obscurity is part of how those things work but it would be nice to get a warning if it is possible that dropping and picking up the same 5000 ultracite ammo 20 times, or passing it back and forth with your friend might trigger a ban. 
---
Awww damn.  Did I call out THAT GUY.
---
Damn, my bad.  I should retract my question.
---
Sure. Players will have a fit if they find that type of info is being requested. And all of it can be spoofed easily. Proc serial, MAC, hardware ID strings- anything you want. It might knock a few casual dupers out, but the pros will remain unhindered.
---
Then you haven't been paying attention.
---
Ok going to try and head there might not make it with high level mobs thanks for the info 
---
No, but you may be banned from the store you stole from. This is the same situation. 
---
"I spent money so I should face no consequences for my actions"
---
I’m not sure if this was said, but I get a glitch that when I spam to drop items, sometimes it drops random items like weapons or armor (I only notice it when it says “you can’t drop a key”). I lost a Dragon from this, which isn’t an amazing weapon but I cherished it 💔
---
Give me stuff noob
---
/u/tudvem
---
/u/grim-reefer123 
---
Thanks for the quick reply, can't wait. :)
---
You are assuming that they are going to 'hotfix' it. That is one hell of an assumption.
---
I dont care about microtransactions so long as they arent giving people an edge. Cosmetic stuff dont bother me. Let people buy what they want to buy
---
Good luck, if you need a key I think there was one on the table with the terminal.
---
No no no. It's not, dont exploit, its dont have any interaction with an exploited object at all. I traded for guns. I picked up a baggy then dropped shit. Anyone who hunted supers, stole their shit and dumped I in a lake somewhere is also banned. 
---
I, like many of you, think the OP is a complete douche and we're better off without him. Good riddance. HOWEVER, if Bethesda said they'd reactivate his account after an essay, they should honor that.
---
My question is this: Did they say *when* they will give you access again? From everything I've read, it just says "a future patch," which could be any time.
---
Dunno, the Mothman statue that turns into moths is fucking magic and only 700 atoms compared to the red rocket which was double at 1400. Anybody who sees that they're trying to improve complaints isn't opening their eyes
---
Ultracite is too cool for a skin. :P
---
Ok will keep an eye out 
---
If you don’t get one, I can give you one later today. Psn sneazel

Yea. I probably will be fine. I am casual player though.

I grow my own memes. It's honest work.

See I can write a ridiculous essay that nobody will read too! 
---
Yea, and again like I've been trying to say if they released a fallout 4 with coop people would be so happy and it would be unbelievable and that's what I want. You've decided that Ive said this is a great survival multiplayer game and that it trumps rust, dayz etc but it doesn't at all it's worse. All I've been saying is that some people have been bitching saying this is fallout 4 with coop stop moaning, this isn't its not half as good. It was basic fun with friends but it us not the fleshed out rpg of fo4 with friends again that would be amazing this is okay at best with friends. It's that simple all I was saying is people can't say this is fo4 with coop it's worse and I wasn't saying its an amazing and the best survival game that you think I'm saying 
---
Sorry bud, no sympathy from me. You cheated, you knew you were cheating (if you didn't then that's ignorance on your part), and you knew the possible repercussions (again, if you didn't you were being ignorant). So, you made your bed and now you have to lie in it. Ignorance of the law (EULA) is not an excuse. You were exploiting a glitch and you had to know it. 
---
Guess what, I wanted a TSE handmade rifle too. I knew that the duping glitches existed and could have exploited it to get what I wanted. I didn't and eventually traded up to the point I could get one (probably duped and had it been deleted from my inventory last week I would have accepted it). I made a decision to go through the avenues that didn't involve exploiting the system to make things easier on me, just like &gt;99% of the other players of this game.
---
The community has largely made clear they want dupers and exploiters gone. And Bethesda is making that happen, albeit not without making some waves. I have my issues with this game and some of the decisions being made, this is not one of them.
---
There is a present exploit that has given players an unfair advantage and needs to be punished for its abuse. Posting nuke codes like this are not as intended by Bethesda. This type of practice should be reported to Bethesda immediately as an exploit to the system. Bypassing the need to collect Nuke Codes all together or accessing them via a decryption website is a full on exploit. Anyone who has launched a nuke without collected all of the nuke codes for that silo should be examined and banned until they can fix the nuke code system from being using incorrectly.
---
yeah, just make Wooby wear all the outfits.
---
Oh wait. 
---
No, you got kicked out of chuckecheese for reaching into a stuffed animal claw game to take a toy. 
---
The dingy bra and undies make me so mad
---
They need to make money somehow, and selling cosmetics is the best without ruining the  game.  
---
You know you can do daily/weekly challenges and get atoms (a lot of atoms), and buy anything you want from atom shop, right?
---
So they are a trader, you are going to have to show me some actual proof they cheated, I'm not going to dig through their post history myself. Especially if your best proof is that they spend a lot of time trading. 
---
Also aren't you the guy that claimed it was fine for BSG to ban people that didn't break any of their rules and played like they would in any other online game?
---
As someone who works and has disposable income, I don't mind spending money on things I enjoy.  If me spending money on mtx helps get me things added I don't mind. 
---
Hell I get paid to do my job, I think they should too.  (I know an argument can be made on whether they are doing their jobs lol,  but I'm not getting into that) 
---
Ice cream spot close to Charleston 
---
Thanks guys!! Love ya ;)

That would be fixed with a probability equation based on the slide's value, with an RNG component tied to the multiplier. That would actually be the most efferent as well, since instead of calling the RNG function 100 times, you call it once and apply the findings to the equation.
---
Just anything but *another* shade of yellow would be nice. Blue would work. Or green. Heck, Red-enemy, Green-ally, and yellow-neutral is a logical pattern. Symbols of some kind would be way better and help folks who actually do have colorblindness though.
---
Sounds like you shouldn't have cheated.
---
Who are those ?  Praise Atom!
---
Indicating it was a false Caution. Yoi cannot FT is enemies are near, which usually gives you a Caution, but innthis case it was falsely showing Caution, so I could.
---
Thank you, I'll take a look. 
---
Oh so we are now applying real life situations to an online game! Good to know! 
---
Keep being an angry little loser about your banned account. Bye bye, good riddance!
---
It does 
---
You'd think if they were going to remove the Flare Gun, they'd do a quick pass of anything else that seems questionable.  Basic due diligence.
---
Guy I work with is from there. From talking to him it sounds like his family farm is pretty much where vault 76 is located on the map
---
As an Unyielding/Bloodied melee build I have a feeling that this missed damage will be negligible until it's fixed honestly. I have a  Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet that with max adrenaline running I've seen hit for 2.4k (no chems). I'll have to see how it is when I get home. (Pretty sure I was living RadWorms last night)
---
I will defend atoms because of this. The second it becomes pay to win I'm out. 
---
K I generally log off around 730 est because I get up around 2am m-f. No worries if you don't connect today. I'll hold on to it for you. my gt is phishntrips.
---
Doesn’t matter had sex.  
---
&gt;1. Some eventually admit to actually duping or playing with people who have
---
This is so true for the every single of these posts. It's like "nooo, I haven't ever done anything" and then after a few comments "well, maybe once, twice you know, just for fun".
---
Build more into the workshop, it increases the cost of contesting it.
---
Conflicts with what others have reported, they were able to log in and drop some items, then got the bans (where able to save the items in question up  to \~1600 lbs).  This is why the bans where over several days from what they said.  (My accounts are fine so wasn't sure how accurate this is)
---
Nothing to be careful at all. Beth and Todd have already said we are supposed to be teaming up to solve the nuke codes. " Players work together to solve puzzles that grant them access to nuclear codes. They then launch the nukes to destroy giant "Scorch Beasts" and seal their fissures. "
---
Duty Now...
---
Stay away from cheaters.  If you pick up their stuff, *you* know you're going to dump it, but no one else does.  It's tough to tell from logs if you're trashing their gear, or just acting as a middle-man to get the gear to someone else.
---
I pick up stuff dumped at train stations/vendors fairly frequently, and I'm (now) a bit careful to look at what I'm grabbing.  2000 rounds of 5mm ammo?  No problem.  40 stims?  Yes please.  175 copies of 15 different 3-star legendary TSEs?  Yeah...back away slowly and don't leave any fingerprints.
---
Will there ever be ultracite headlamp and jetpack mods?
---
My game seems to do this already, whenever it wants to. Even gives me the weight bonus from my deep pockets mods occasionally while in my power armor. It's real hit and miss when it wants to do it. Just buggy af.
---
Not enough to deter griefers, trust me.
---
And that camo paint for the hunting rifle is unfair 
---
they immediately regain health, because they either use a super stimpak or nuka cola that does health regen before engagement.
---
In regards to not taking damage, it's either sentinel assassin or caviliar (Counter with crit) / dodgy, replacing dmg with AP (Counter with high rate of fire), or high super high dmg resistance (counter with antiarmor) or unyielding which also means they are bloodied (Counter with crit or gamma gun/radium rifle) Their very low health should make it ez to one shot them with a crit.
---
I think the main problem is this game is build on a single player engine that can't actually detect a lot of things most online game systems can so BSG is just shooting in the dark.
---
As for your idea with the lawyer, it wouldn't matter people in here would just claim you must of done something previously before then to get banned.
---
Look at how they are treating that guy with 900+ hours played just because the numbers are screwed up with his ammo. He claims he only had 36k ammo max, yet everyone here is claiming "he had over half a million ammo" even when the email doesn't even say that either.
---
I mean the guy wrote a guide on how to farm efficiently so it is pretty obvious that he knows how to play the game in a way to get lots of mats. So combine the fact he can farm well with the issue of BSG only being able to see when items are added to your inventory and can't tell if it is the same item when you drop it and pick it back up makes it very VERY easy for something like this to cause false bans.
---
Even BSG knows this and that is why they in the emails even say they are only temporary. So combine that with the sheer amount of screw ups that have happened in the past with this game. It doesn't seem that far fetched for them to screw up and ban innocent people.
---
Hey Jullz,
---
Honestly, I have no desire to engage in pvp even with the build you mentioned. I just want to be able to play at my own pace in peace and cooperatively at times. I'm just going to wait until they make such a change and if not it will remain uninstalled. I got my money's worth already. 
---
You're mistaken. Perhaps they used bad methodology for their testing. The square footage alone in my base is double what I had three builds ago and even then it was sparsely decorated. 
---
Yeah... sorry... a typical Scorchbeast isn't actually considered "Legendary". 
---
If you steal a snickers in germany, you will get in trouble. Even if its a snickers. Breaking the law is breaking the law. And in this case u broke the agreements you made, when u purchased the game. They have all the reasons to ban you. 
---
It’s the same posts over and over again, so weird:
---
“ I cheated and was banned, it’s not fair - F Bethesda!”
---
Lmfao, well thanks for the laugh
---
If you spawn the button without stop you will notice that before you were able to click 3 times now 2 barely noticeable but I guess it helps because now it won’t lag ( I usually cook over 40 pieces of everything each time I visit a cooking station )
---
Hard for endgame. Crit based + bloody, but still one of the weakest builds overall.
---
People like him is dime a dozen. All over the subreddit. Like holy hell, we've read 100000 carbon copies of your essay, give it a rest already. Plus he claimed that "lots of innocent players were banned" (I was skimming and that stopped me), which is BS. I would say around 95% deserved it, with 5% caught in the web by accident. Maybe even up to 99%/1%.
---
Yeah before the patch  (this morning for an hour and a half) I was server hopping to farm stimpacks. After the patch,  it's completely empty. Every time.  Server hopping doesn't replenish it.  Not sure what's going on. 
---
He got the email this morning and hasn't logged in since a month and a half.
---
Maybe they had some time before it was their turn for the checkup?
---
I could be wrong either way, maybe he played once but doesn't remember, he is a no life after all.
---
It’s very poor and turns what should be a positive change into a negative for them unfortunately. 
---
my weapons dropped severly in damage. feelsbadman lol
---
Did you server hop? 
---
&gt; Oh so we are now applying real life situations to an online game! Good to know! 
---
Uh... both things are real life. Is the money in your bank account not real because you use online banking?
---
&gt; Keep being an angry little loser about your banned account. Bye bye, good riddance!
---
Not banned, but thanks for playing. Also for saying something reportable. Bye bye, good riddance!
---
They banned them, gave them accounts back and told them they'd be fine if they cleaned up their act, then banned them again anyway
---
To be specific, it was 140K ultracite ammo on one account, 225K ultracite ammo and 280K normal ammo on a second account. So 365K ultracite ammo and 280K normal ammo altogether. His theory that swapping ammo back and forth made it count multiple times is clearly false as the primary account wasn't flagged for normal ammo and was flagged for less ultracite ammo than the mule account was. If swapping items back and forth made it count multiple times, the numbers would be similar for both accounts.
---
I vote for LightSpeed brand briefs
---
&gt;osting here wont' actually do anything to help you. Contact Bethesda support. The CMs here - if I understand the company structure at all - have no actual ability to help you, and can just point you in the right direction to submit a ticket.  
---
&gt;People have no reason to believe you, and there is simply no way to prove your innocence to Reddit. Frankly, most people never will believe you. If you post, accept that and don't get all surprised-pikachu on us when people don't believe you.

Queue he FO76 kazoo memes!

For the most part, no one takes my camps and I'm fine. It's the fact that it's possible and has happened a couple times to me. I would prefer pacifist mode or another setting allow me to forfeit my workshop without defense if someone goes to claim it, and prevent flagging me for PVP. Honestly I'd be happy to check that box. If someone feels so compelled to actually go so far as to take my workshop rather than hop servers and get an unclaimed one, they can have it. I have zero desire or interest in PVP, so much so that the experience of having been griefed with this method has left me to uninstalled until fixed. 
---
Never stated that but thanks for putting words in my mouth.
---
Friend has some items, both friends get together and dupe, voila both friends have the armor. It’s rocket science for you to understand I know, but try your best.
---
I'm holding off myself until more content and balance patches roll in, but my point is that much of the announced content schedule won't even drop within the first month.
---
Going with the obvious Destiny analogy, that game has changed significantly since it launched, both in terms of content as well as quality of life and feature improvements. It sure isn't perfect, but it's an entirely different experience than it initially was. The main difference being that those changes were introduced with paid DLC and expansions, where Anthem is a one time purchase.
---
If BioWare sticks to their stated seasonal rollouts it should offer continuing entertainment for quite some time. It's totally your prerogative if you decide to buy it (for a second time) later down the road if you get the desire to try the new stuff out at that point, but I think a lot of prospective Anthem players are looking a bit more long term than just 30 days worth of gaming.
---
/u/Valseek 
---
&gt;**Apparel:** Underarmor no longer remains visible while wearing the Silver Shroud costume. 
---
Can we have a similar fix for the Hunter's Long Coat at well? Underarmor glitches through.
---
Because the card explicitly calls out melee weapons?
---
These type of posts have become a parody.
---
If you have a Bloodied meat hook you can do 3k+ damage with one handed n unarmed perks 
---
Bethesda's official response sometime back was start a new character to get them.
---
Yeah happens to me a lot at whitespring golf club. Even the normal bodies of ghouls disappear. Bethesda pls fix this
---
The game is fucking broken and is dying slowly
---
All good. Fo76 is a beautiful game even without the pvp element. I could see ur point.
---
I never bought anything because I didnt want anything that was duped I might jump back on this weekend and see if I can get back into it
---
Cue Supermutant voice: 'Run! Run Away!'
---
He can just buy a used controller from gamestop and they will give him a new copy free with it.
---
Vault 96 opens, releasing living NPCs who encounter the hellscape *we* helped create by participating in an Appalachian Arms Race. You have to convince them you're not evil and then help them get situated in the new world, all while protecting their new settlements from Scorchbeast attacks.
---
So you consider a game to be real life. Ha. Good to know. I also took a look at your post history and uhh.. yeah.. not creepy at all. So, I'm sorry (not sorry actually) to say that your "opinion" is no longer valid to me..
---
Cry harder.
---
When they get dirty in the back you flip em around and it's like a whole new pair
---
/r/shittylifeprotips
---
And? You broke the ToS and were punished accordingly. Personally, I find it incredibly entertaining that people who were banned actually wrote an essay to get unbanned, and the people who are still banned after writing said essay are pissed off haha. You have no one except for yourself to blame for this. It isn't Bethesda's fault you broke the rules, and they have no obligation to unban you after writing your essay. I hope you stay banned :)
---
Honestly, if you set up turrets outside to farm the golf club whenever a new person showed up, that bag of legendaries belonged to whomever found them.
---
dont forget inside out, then flip them again
---
You also need to be ridiculously low on health to output that type of damage.  While I do believe ranged weapons need a buff, it takes a lot of investing to get where you can put out 2k worth of damage.
---
I hated the mechanic in Survival mode on FO4, so I never played survival mode. I hate it just as much in 76 but it's unavoidable so I deal with it. I would be so much happier without it.
---
Garrahan Estate, top floor there's a liquor cabinet containing wine, beer, and every type of hard alcohol
---
Ok thank you so much 
---
No, just lost of cheaters whining when they get caught or the uber-build gets nerfed.
---
&gt; I also took a look at your post history and uhh.. yeah.. not creepy at all.
---
I have no idea what you mean. Please, continue.
---
Who's Beth? She sounds hot. 
---
Usually when this happens to me, the corpse teleports where it originally spawned. In the future, if you know the spawn location, you can check there. I can't guarantee you'll find it though, this has only happened to me a few times.
---
I figured as much but I enjoy using them more than the other guns. I also enjoy shotguns but it feels like they are made of paper and I get annoyed at constant repair needed.
---
What happened to it?
---
Nah those 2k dmg bloodied builds need to be nerfed too.
---
Dear Bethesda, you put soap in the game. Nuff said. 😋
---
That doesn't even make sense, low level low effort trolling, shame.
---
Banning cheaters like this is how they fix the game. Current economy is all out of whack from dupers.
---
I'm just going off of the 45 ammo. It is not common enough to have looted that many rounds in 30 days. He has no reason to craft it at all, since he's a shotgun build, in fact, i'd think that he would have been flagged for shotgun shells, but he was not, lol.
---
Ammo has value to other players. I seen people selling ammo all the time in the market place. 2000 45 ammo, going price 9 days ago was 2000 rounds for 750 caps.
---
&gt;At the end of the day I got banned from a game I hadn't launched in weeks and I don't really care
---
"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes"
---
definitely. they hide behind the "gap" rationalization when, in truth, there's no gap.
---
ghouls and melee offenders in general bum rush everyone. in fact, as a heavy gunner, I need to keep a shotgun on me as well for when I'm swarmed. and ranged mobs will get pot shots off both melee AND ranged.
---
ranged maybe less so, but it doesn't justify melee dealing 5 times more damage than any given gun. the gap is a lie.
---
Happens on xbox also so I went out and got a 4tb external hd and problems solved. Lol 
---
It flatly doesn't work at all anymore.  Besides the negative effects.  Those still work.
---
I honestly don't understand why people like you, who can't accept that he just cheated, exist. Why do you go through so much effort to be wrong? It makes no sense. Is it a compulsion that you HAVE to show that some liar on the internet could be right?
---
He's just a fucking cheater and liar on the internet. Stop believing everything you read online, please.
---
Aww too bad but there is still hope. 
---
Guess you guys were simply lucky and maybe one of your routers reset itself or sommin? When me and my friends force to have empty maps in GTA Online all sorts of weird things happen. Random accidents with exploding cars on the highways or such. 
---
SBQ seems to be the one thing F76 has to offer in regards of end game content am I right? 
---
If that were true, his mule wouldn't have more ammo than his main, the numbers would be similar. His main was flagged for less ultracite ammo and wasn't flagged at all for normal ammo.
---
Fun times.
---
not really. at that point you're outputting 5, 10K damage, not 2.
---
Awesome man, hope he enjoyed it! 
---
Right, not your average melee player, though. To do this high dmg you have to min/max your whole build, find all of the right mutations, find a full set of unyielding armor, find a bloodied weapon, etc. it’s not exactly like picking up the next hatchet you come across and suddenly being able to one hit the SBQ. Also, the trade off is having to play at around 20% health, you can probably take out a guy at 20% health before he can get within reach most, if not all of the time.
---
i was expecting the post to be 100 at minimum, seeing anything for free came as a shock. i got it instantly
---
Yeah, fun indeed.  A comedy of errors.
---
*ding*
---
Ya haha, no blue screens either! 
---
You need to do more damage when you have to run up to a fat man face to face. I can see why it’s annoying but, using unyielding to always be a hit away from death, did roughly 900 damage. It still took two hits to kill a glowing one. They have roughly 1000 health. Weapons in this game aren’t balanced in any way shape or form. Maybe one gun works with one build but only a different gun works with a different build. Either way I just wish they’d rebalance EVERYTHING 
---
wait..have they done something to the adrenalin perk?
---
Yep, same here.
---
Others have not needed it on occasion but I've always needed it. The password note also goes "poof" when used so it's not me dropping it or storing it.
---
Just another bugged quest since 'beta'.
---
Each stack gets a ref id, the quantity is tracked by a count. Add to the stack, count goes up, take away from the stack, count goes down. Combine stacks and the one being added to remains while the one being added disappears.
---
1809 finds a way to screw everyone, even if they aren't running it!
---
Sorry to hear, I hope you can get this figured out.
---
Bye 
---
Nobody can have any reason to hate Bethesda with everything these updates have been giving us. They’re listening and they’re providing. I’m glad I stuck around and have given 76 a chance.
---
Imagine getting angry because you broke a very stern rule of the game and you got banned. SMH.
---
Disagree if you want them buffs you looks like a Lego man.. you made you're bed... Now lie in it.
---
Non PA main
---
Luckily our characters know this skill already... probably from the days the laundry rooms lost power in the vault due to mole rats chewing the lines
---
I think it’s more of the final straw that broke the camels back 
---
I had no issue until they made all plans available.  Hoarding a dozen or so of each stable Flux and nuke zone materials for crafting uses up a stupid amount of weight.  
---
I do the same.
---
@falloutsearch on Twitter. They also run a website similar to ESO fashion. Maybe a YouTube too
---
Yes. There is no rule book. If you do anything bethesda considers improper, you will be banned. That is any activity deemed abusive in any way. Not just some narrow specific rule set easily circumvented. Just because you do not believe it, does not make it true. Any activity involving a mule of any kind is outside given activity. Any exp exploit, taking advantage of the game in any way not intended by the developers.  You dont have some god given right to do anything you have not been told was wrong. Ignorance is no excuse. 
---
I’ve heard, some people recommending the next division that’s coming out. Will take a look 
---
I don't really care what people here think or say and wouldn't even bother posting it here honestly. However if Bethesda were to ban my account for violating terms of service when I didn't violate terms of service and their support team didn't help, having a lawyer on retainer would make it a no brainer to see what their legal team thinks.
---
There is an event at the lighthouse just to the right of vault 76. It's called path to enlightenment. Once you complete it, a friendly lvl 1 wise mothman spawns at the base of the lighthouse.
---
I never specced into much other than gauntlet weapons and a full suit of unyielding bringing me up to 45 strength only deals 1k on a Large Deathclaws Gauntlet. Max strength, iron fist, and twisted muscles as well as talons
---
Not for low levels. I moved into an area when I was level 27 that regularly spawns yao guai in threes - usually two in between level 46 and 66 and the third around level 78 or honey beasts ranging 16-36. First thing I do when I load in is grab my hunting rifle and (assuming I can make it to my stairs) sprint up to my sniper's nest. Sweep the treeline spamming VATS until I lock onto something with a crown and pop off a few rounds. Then I scramble down to the turret floor and make sure to tag each yao guai at least once (all three will attack at once) and wait for things to quiet down. Then I repair my poor water pump and collect a ton of yao guai meat and springs or honey and treasure maps, as well as a bunch of scrappable armor and weapons in the level 50 range. Went from level 27 to 38 in about 4 days of this plus screw farming. I've got multiples of all the treasure maps and I'm selling bulk springs at vendors.
---
Melee needs a nerf.
---
Regular guns and energy weapons need a buff.
---
Why would melee folks complain about TSE? Why would I specifically are about how YOU play the game. Unless it's PVP. The only people I saw that had issues were people being griefed.
---
I'd check a couple of things... software and hardware.
---
Check GPU temps. A GPU getting hot, will cause gradual loss of system performance. That loss returns when the card is, cooled off, or the game is restarted. However, if the GPU was getting hot, the issue would return quicker and quicker with every subsequent restart of the game. 
---
You'd mentioned a BIOS update you performed, it is possible that could have affected some settings with the GPU on a hardware level, but not likely since all drivers have been installed after the fact and no issue was reported.
---
I loathe Microsofts updates to Windows 10 because it seems that with every update, they break something. However, you stated you formatted and reinstalled an earlier version so the October update shouldnt be affecting you. I have learned thought, NOT to let Windows install your Graphics Drivers automatically. Install the NVidia G-Force Experience program and use it to keep your drivers up to date.
---
It's your archive list for your mods. Needs to be updated.
---
Right, this issue doesn't apply to people who bulk and sell, at least not if they are doing things in a logical order. I replied to someone who made it sound like there were people out there just bulking everything.  
---
And the way it was before, where bulked items couldn't be used to craft was also fine. If you are going to need something and not sell it, then don't bulk it.  But whatever.
---
Give it 1 year to be actually playable :(
---
Has the bug where all my friends are disappearing at alarming rates been worked on yet? But for real though, really sad to see still nothing new, guess I'll be back in another month, hope something actually happens so my friends will want to play again and I'm not bored AND alone. I'll be on Metro Exodus until then.
---
Sigh.  6 hours at emmetts disposal here i come.
---
Great job looking out for the little guy. Stupid question time, how does one "stack a critical "?
---
I wonder if something wonky happened with how they fixed rad worms. Almost seems like the downside of the rad worms bug, pre-patch, but permanent. 
---
Also seems to have the explosive damage bug a bit too, I mean since they nerfed the legendary effect it doesn't fully heal the enemy but it seems to like hurt enemy heal it a bit then eventually next shot will kill it.
---
Are you talking about the sneak attack multiplier?
---
This depends on the company.  I once worked a "save our sales" retention department outsourced to a third party call center for quest.  We actually had zero ability to help them.  All we were there for was to read scripts and attempt to delay the customer from canceling until they got sick of it and hang up.  In the event we changed their mind from canceling we were also supposed to try to up sell them.  Brilliant.
---
We were divided up into small groups each with a leader who was paid ever so slightly more than us and gave even fewer fucks.  They were the "supervisor", but had no extra power to help the customer either.
---
If we could not convince the customer to keep their service or hang up, then we were supposed to warm transfer them to quest proper who could actually provide deals and options.  But they were degenerate narcissistic f* bags who were paid significantly more but always tried to weasel out of the call.
---
Usually I just opened the customer onto the line, said the person could help them and dumped the call.
---
CD reps are psychologically screwed up people.  I don't trust them, ever.  And I know they are almost certainly dicking with me got fun for any slight issue. 
---
Seems that the removed the positive effect leaving the negative one
---
I love apex 
---
Do you have to "recover" from the broken Adrenal Reaction effect, of can you just take another serum to get it working?
---
It has no effect?
---
*confused groan*
---
you got pictures of that? because something is definitely wrong. you should be hitting close to 5k.
---
you got adrenal? bloodied deathclaw gauntlet?
---
The real end game is to locate the Grimoire to unlock all of the spells. 😉
---
That or $35 and starting over.
---
Adrenal but not a Bloodied deathclaw. Anti armor
---
Yet he didn't do any experience exploit. BSG said they banned him for having too many items. NOWHERE in any online game should you expect to be banned for having too many items.
---
Once again having alt accounts isn't against any rules, isn't immoral, and isn't an exploit. So you are trying to compare apples to oranges.
---
I got all achievements except for level 100 one... on a fresh non beta character.  Beth response... level another character....  I got better shit to do with my time than replay through the bugs again.
---
🦀 CHEATER IS GONE 🦀
---
That does not sound so bad. I do not know why they simply just had new recipes for ammo at five times the material cost for five times the result.
---
Less button presses equals more server stability, right?
---
Yeah it’s not good
---
Since today. I wish they added a Mothman combat armor skin too, but I snapped that Mothman Statue up immediately. *That* is going straight in my base.
---
Can you provide any evidence to support your claim?
---
Cool. Thanks man. Hopefully they are spawning in world again.
---
So you do 99% of the damage... I do 1% of the damage and I get flagged!  Brilliant!    Like you said, you can almost obliterate a base so it's being held together by a wet toothpick, lure a ghoul there, it destroys the base easily and you just stand there pointing at the ghoul and say "He did it."
---
Commando perks, and im telling you.. you will have to use Vats.  1. You'll save ammo that is rare  2. You cant hit shit with smg hip firing. 3 smg 's are really niche, becouse everything that smg does theres always handmade rifle that has more ammo in mag, more damage, range, supressor, easy to make ammo. In currently trying out antiarmor 25% firerate smg, the damage is still low but not the worst, big problem is 10 mm ammo.. 
---
Sad thing? I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.
---
It’s bigger than 1 person tbh and I just found it annoying that people were claiming there’s no way he could craft that amount of ammo in 30 days, I clearly explained that you can and that I do on a regular basis. Can you explain to me how he’s a liar please I’m waiting..? 
---
also questioning the existence of people who have differing opinions than you won’t get you very far, we’re all in this life together so I’d appreciate it if you kept your tone civil ty.
---
However, ones who acquired over 1million of one or more rare in-game items is permanently banned, decision is final and can't appeal
---
The irony of people in the comments posting they left this game for Apex due to lack of content is confusing. I game with literally ONE game mode. 
---
My bad. Thought it said just repair further down the patch notes
---
All of this is true, but it's also true that we have a ton of unscrupulous players willing to pay real money to magically gear many of us will never find in hundreds of hours.
---
I totally agree melee does need more damage, as they are getting up close and personal, but the amount they are outputting right now is IMHO way out of wack, but honestly thank you for just being willing to engage in this discussion in a respectful and civil manner, it's really great to get the other side of the story, which I as a strictly ranged player wouldn't otherwise get!
---
They have been MIA since patch 5 afaik 
---
Funny way to spell *hour*...
---
Grahm must be one of your happiest customers.
---
would still be better if it had them.. also the jetpack
---
It's not about the "rules" of what the perks say. It's about lowering the already small amount of useful weapon options. It's much more important to me (and fun for that matter) to actually have a useful heavy weapon than them cherrpicking and shoehorning whatever balance issues they think are important. They talk about balance but all I see them doing is giving us fewer and fewer options and making us spend more and more time grinding.
---
This is the quality content I come here for. good job sir. 
---
A good place to experiment with this bug is Fort Defiance, every single time i go there about a third of the ghouls disappear after i kill them and they teleport to their "spawn location" in sleeping position, but unlootable. Only in that area have i had this bug happen to me, and every time without fail.
---
I never saw a post specifically from melee players who where upset about TSE, it was do to the the rampant duping and griefing going on with TSE weapons.
---
Yup, give me a sec to upload to imgur. I tried including it with my post but the sub doesn't accept image posts
---
Honestly, when I first found out about nukes I assumed you had to actually *have* all the pieces of the code to be able to put them in. Turns out they're just clues and, as you said, if you go online you can just grab them and launch a nuke with only a fairly easy to acquire keycard.
---
Nah rapid hits get the marsupial jumpers I've tried it before.
---
please no drumpf supporter memes here.
---
The biggest issue here is that ALL melee isn’t doing that. I’ve never hit any numbers close to that in my entire playthrough. Legendaries and mutations and perks all have a way of getting way out of hand
---
This is entirely my point. 👏🏻👏🏻
---
The legendary PA pieces sucked anyway
---
Excavator PA is ugly. 
---
...come stop by my shop, The Powerhouse! I’ll get you set up with some fantastic T51b! 
---
not necessarily. with full unyielding, a bloodied weapon, adrenal (pre-bug), twisted muscles and talons you can hit for roughly 5k per regular swing.
---
and setinel/cavalier ensures you won't die.
---
Start with 200% condition level 50 BOS Heavy Combat Armor.
---
Then perk yourself up and replace with legendary versions.  
---
Honestly too little too late 
---
Renaming is coming according to the pinned post at the official forum... only viewable by the player but I'll take it. For weapons too. You'll be able to change it from the examine screen
---
True it may not be, but then again this is BSG we are talking about. The same people that advertised a canvas bag to go with the PA edition of the game and instead sent out garbage bags. Then told the customers "tough luck were not changing it" when emailed about it, until they were forced to by the bad publicity. This very well could be the exact same situation. 
---
I have a t51 helmet and left arm plan I would sell. 750 each
---
And Mantaman Suit. Happens with a number of atom shop outfits, in general. Looks like the people making the atom shop stuff are doing so on nude models.
---
Gross
---
is this pre-patch? because the latest one broke adrenal. and the one before that kinda broke adrenal with rad worms.
---
1k is way too low.
---
No, rifles just do it better, base game design.
---
It needs buffing, like a lot of builds, considering it’s been 3 months and they haven’t fixed energy weapons, don’t hold your breath.
---
That was probably a bit presumptuous?
---
Happy to help!
---
Its near the top of the world, little south of it near a river. 
---
Yes you got angry so you made some shit up in order to defend a position you had no reason to defend in the first place.
---
Just don't post next time. You only add to the problem with your gullibility.
---
Assume everything you read online is a lie.
---
Last time I played was before the patch before this patch
---
If that was how it worked, his mule and main would have been hit for similar amounts of ammo. Instead his main was hit for 80K less ultracite ammo and wasn't hit at all for normal ammo.
---
I use chems, nerd rage, emergency protocols, and adrenal reaction with a bloodied sledge and go to 20% health and do only 1700, I dont know how 5k is possible
---
Can you not trade with people? Or is that not allowed in the game.
---
omfg
---
Yeah I mean that's the heart of the matter for me IMO, the people who called TSE OP but then refuse to acknowledge that armor piercing, bloodied and adrenal reactions make melee absolutely broken 
---
Yup, that's why you hardly see anyone using it. No jetpack. Jetpack is half the reason to wear Power Armor.
---
I thought armor could only have one legendary modifier? I could find a right leg (as an example) with both unyielding modifiers and cavalier?
---
I can’t get my two handed weapons up that high, damn.
---
Fire axe or Wood axe? I haven’t been able to find FIRE axe plans anywhere. Vendors don’t sell them.
---
Would you do 1250 for both?
---
I guess we'll have to just disagree then.  My level 15 has an identical base to my level 109, right up to the limit in each case - built last week on both chars.
---
Doing something as simple as redecorating a room could free up enough space to double the size of a house depending on the overall complexity of each item removed/changed.
---
Here's the thing: this image doesn't indicate whether the account in question held all the ammo at one time or not.
---
&gt;We have determined that this account **has acquired** over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items **within 30 days of game play**. 
---
&gt;&gt;This account was **found exploiting the following items** on your primary account: 140,960 Ultracite Ammo [and another 225,111 Ultracite ammo on a secondary account, described with the same ambiguous **found exploting** language]
---
The player in question denies ever having had 100k+ of any ammo type on any account at one time, and speculated they're tracking *any* kind of creation/picking up/acquisition of Ultracite Ammo across all characters on an account. I keep about 20k .50 cal Ultracite ammo on my one and only account at any given time, and have probably crafted/burned another 150k of the stuff since the beta. Every hardened/glowing/high rad fluids I pick up gets stored, and when I want to craft 10k+ ultracite ammo, I just slap on green thumb and run around the bog, server hopping as needed, until I've collected all the violet flux I can find. Then it's super duper time at the chem bench for stable flux, usually 40-60 but some times as many as 150 stable flux at one go, and then a lucky hole run with excavator armor for over 1000 lead scraps in a few minutes. Gunpowder is everywhere, just like cloth. Acid gets to be a limiting reagent really fast with lucky hole plus gunpowder, though, and steel is also an issue with 30-40 steel per batch (I make both .50 cal and 5mm, can't remember which is which steel amount right now).
---
Either way, with ammo smith and superduper, that's roughly 10k to 23k of ultracite ammo in just one ammo crafting session. Yes, the masses/fluids for all that flux were gathered over a much longer period, mainly from WS farming, but that's not the point. The point is you can craft a fuckton of ultracite ammo really fast if that's what you want to do. I've played since beta but didn't start crafting ultracite .50 until I finally got a prime .50 receiver plan...maybe 2-3 weeks ago. It was shortly before the TSE nerf. All my ultracite ammo has been crafted in that relatively short period of time.
---
 BGS's posted Message Log doesn't clearly contradict that scenario, or say the account held 640k ammo of different types all at once. It just says "has acquired over 100k within 30 days of gameplay." We have no idea what BGS means by "acquired" here, but it could very well be something consistent with legitimate gameplay.
---
Stealth nerf fuck in the ass just like every patch includes. Working as intended I’m sure
---
you need unyielding to up your strength as much as possible. it's not as effective in PA.
---
Its near the top of the world, little south of it near a river. Nothing special there but water.
---
Possible but the teams who would do stuff like swag with a package deal and the devs who write code and algorithms to detect exploiters are going to be completely different teams and people. 
---
Same, before the new adrenal reaction bug.  In all Unyielding armor with bloodied power fist, I was at max hitting for 2k.
---
As others are saying, most OP melee builds rely on bloodied or unyielding, meaning gripes about those builds are really about bloodied or unyielding.  I run all Vanguard armor pieces for sweet sweet DR, and my pure melee build with a 3* legendary grognak's tops out at like 250 damage.  And if you're a ranged or sneak build and let a guy with nothing but an axe get close enough to you to use it, you have bigger problems than a melee nerf can or should fix.
---
I hear that
---
Hey man this game is fine. Chill
---
oh damn that's smart, think I need a set if I start playing this game consistently again.
---
Custom fan curve? 
---
I have a gtx 1080 founder edition and it will thermal throttle after a while on default settings (50% max fan speed), but 70-80% it is almost not an issue.
---
You can set the fan speed or a custom fan curve with msi afterburner.
---
Quick grab the **POWER** **ARMOR**
---
I hate them and their sonic crap so much.  Even worse is the stupid little scorched pissants that show up and get it the way, distracting from the important part: taking the stupid bat down.  I'm only level 40 and a relatively new player, and do I regret how much of my ammo that bitch ate?  No.  I got my fucking revenge, and that's what matters to me.  Fuck those fucking things.
---
So if all of this is because of a bug why are people yelling nerf?
---
There were other retailers pulling the copies from stores a few weeks ago, and it ended up being nothing.
---
sounds like you are projecting your hatred of melee builds onto melee players, afaik not one person insisted on a TSE nerf, they got nerfed because of the amount of duped TSEs in the wild, it was the wrong move but that's why they got nerfed, not because a bunch of melee players insisted on it...
---
I took a run around looking at the vendors and did not see them today after patch 6.  
---
Pretty close to where mine is, never had an issue around there.
---
Sorry you're having problems
---
u/valseek You guys broke Adrenal Reaction. :( It now says "HP -12" but not "Weapon damage increases as HP lowers" and my weapons no longer do increased damage. This is in Xbox 1
---
I don't think I would worry about .308 x 2000.  I regularly trade ammo in the 2k to 4k range and haven't had an issue.
---
There are some people out there who do bulk everything and i am one of them. Makes stash management much easier in my opinion. I wish i could bulk more if i'm being honest (gold, silver, crystal, antiseptic to name a few). But then we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
Doesn’t seem like we’re playing the same game
---
Exactly. 
---
Honestly why are u here?
---
Heh? Screenshot please?
---
Keycards don’t, right?   Just the code pieces?
---
Bethesda is behind the curve, in trying to correct the duping issue now. Hopefully it helps with the balance somewhat.
---
I have a lvl 20? (I think) one on ps4, its yours tonight if your still looking for one.
---
So I bothered to read the tos. Macros are explicitly banned. He admits using a macro. Case closed.
---
But they would be the same dev's who ended up sending out an old patch as a new one, tied movement speed to the client, has the sweet spot in locks on the client side, and numerous other amateur level coding mistakes. So it wouldn't be a surprise for them to screw up on this as well. 
---
come on dude that's insane.
---
Cool, I wasn't aware of that. Just figured I'd let people know what's up.
---
I work for Meijer so it's being pulled from about 240+ stores
---
I mean it was a good attempt...
---
I’m just still salty in spent $60 dollars on this 
---
Yeah my point is though, they all complained about how OP TSE was (and yeah, it was op) but then they refuse to acknowledge that bloodied/Unyielding + Armor Piercing + Adrenal Reaction is also horribly broken
---
No doubt but once you eliminate the casual duper problem it becomes much easier to track down the Russians.
---
Offshore gambling sites have been doing this stuff for 20 years. The casual user isn't capable of spoofing everything and even if they can all it takes is to log in one time without spoofing your MAC or mother board serial number and you are busted.
---
Did you read what I said? I appreciate that apex has very limited bugs and runs extremely smoothly. I also posted that the major factor in which I quit is the new bugs with this patch that really messed up the endgame 
---
True. But at least a 15 dollar buy in let's you experience the game to see if you're even remotely interested. Plus playing a multiplayer game at launch is always a significantly better social experience than later on when the player base inevitably drops 
---
So now if someone doesn't know how a specific mechanic or modifier works on the items they have then they are likely cheating, hm?  Because every mechanic in this game works flawlessly as expected, right?
---
legendaries have 3 mods now (unlike in Fo4), the prefix, a major mod and a minor mod.
---
unyielding is a prefix, it can drop with sentinel or cavalier, which are minor mods (I think?)
---
point is, yes, you can have unyielding with sentinel OR cavalier
---
Err, original cost was 30+ springs per leg without Power Smith. I remember that clearly because it was an absolute pain at the time. Maybe they already changed it in a previous patch and no-one noticed.
---
I live in Kanawha County, home of 76's Nuka plant.
---
They got the "vibe" of WV down pretty well, I'd say.  The topography is pretty good.  So is the sound - like the wind chimes and certain birds that sound like home to me but didn't exist in the other Fallouts.
---
The locations are pretty much just landmarks + similar stuff.  But everything is way condensed and squished together.  For example in real life it would take you about an hour and a half to drive from the Charleston Capitol Building to Summersville (with no traffic), but in the game you can walk there in a couple of minutes.  All of the towns in between are just not in the game.
---
In the game, Flatwoods is almost directly under the Gorge Bridge.  In real life, Flatwoods is far away from the Gorge Bridge and another much cooler town called Fayetteville is sorta where Flatwoods is in the game.  Why didn't they just use Fayetteville?  I guess the answer is that Fayetteville doesn't have a cool monster.
---
I also had a good laugh when so many players complained about not having any flat land to build on.  WELCOME TO WV.  We've been dealing with that forever.  If anything, the terrain in the game isn't mountainous *enough*.
---
While it wasn't just melee players, there were a LOT of people begging for it to be nerfed, (which it did need to be)
---
So is duping but clearly your account has been marked with the Duping Error hun.
---
Idk, probably because they want to complain.
---
Link to where he admits to macroing.
---
Do all of those overlap the Prime Fissure enough to make her spawn?
---
Also... I have not been able to be close enough to the Prime Fissure when she spawns.  Does she actually crawl out of it all dramatic like?
---
Are you willing to use VATS and run zero pistol perks above 50?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W-8I--0wz8)
---
a max level 10mm/pipe pistol is approximately the same damage. You'll eventually branch into rifles, specifically the lever action.
---
before Sneak broke you could actually use revolvers at SBQ and stay in caution most of the time. 
---
What did I make up? Did you even bother to read my comments? Please give specific examples or I can’t be bothered to argue with you ty
---
What else is meant to go before `sResourceArchive2List= SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2` please?
---
Crafting 4 memes in a day? Likely story
---
So basically a game of Jenga. :thinking: 
---
Rapid hits lol. I’ve been in this situation myself and always killed the heavy gunner before he even took 5% if my health.
---
He has to free aim hit me while I continually jump in the air and vats headshot him, 1-2 headshots and you’re dead meanwhile it will take you 30 or more hits on me before I die.
---
You’re still at a giant disadvantage pvp’ing in power armor, don’t fool yourself.
---
He posted the email and stated he has never had more then 36k of an ammo and believes that they have been adding up counts based on him picking the ammo up and dropping it while moving it between his characters.
---
I am not on PC so I have no second account, this has caused me to drop 10s of thousands of ammo because the weight was prohibitive even with max rank bandolier.  5k shotgun rounds still weighs in at 30 or so pounds.
---
Then again this is reddit where the witch hunting mobs reside, so continue to believe Bethesda pulled off the bans with no screw ups despite their inability to implement even small bug fixes without inducing 3 more bugs.
---
For the record, most of the people crying innocent are most likely guilty, but when you have played games as long as I have (30 years) you find you are able to sort out those innocent vs those guilty.  I dont think he duplicated anything, maybe abused some farming methods but then again having someone logout and back in at whitesprings is abusing farming methods so that issue is debatable.
---
I am sorry not sorry that you have poor impulse control and a lack of resilience to peer pressure. You messed up and now Papa batgesda is bring down some punishment. Get over yourself.
---
&gt;no new meaningful content in sight.
---
Might want to read the god damn inside the vault from last week.
---
Yeah I don’t know what the duck you’re playing. I’ve had the game a week and I’m annoyed with myself I let people like you convince me not to play it. The game is awesome. You’re just complaining to complain. Know how many times I’ve been disconnected? Twice. Know how many game breaking glitches I’ve encountered? Zero. Maybe your expectations are just too high, eh?
---
They expect to make back whatever caps they spend by being annoying piece of shit and killing you a lot then leaving before their bounty can matter.
---
Then they will have one of their friends kill them and get back some of the caps by trading 1 item with the for the value.
---
My base has never been attacked so I don't know. Do you get a notice when it's under attack? If so that's the players fault for letting it go on so long. If you don't get a message then ignore my post I am ignorant.
---
Yeah. We won’t see a fix for weeks. 
---
No idea what you're trying to say. If however you're implying that it's okay for innocent people to get banned so a handful more cheaters get banned as well you're some kinda crazy.
---
found the salty greifer
---
Vanguards and Bolstering legendary effect on Heavy BOS Combat Armor, plus with the perks: Barbarian, Evasive, Bodyguards, and maybe junk sheild. And also the mutations: Grounded. These will get you to a very high dr
---
Yeah, but the inherent 100 lbs extra carry weight, before adding calibrated shocks or the +2 Strength torso mod is pretty sweet too. 
---
&gt; Fallout has always been Hoarder Simulator
---
At least in previous iterations we could turn the hoarded goods into something productive, like filling a lake with empty soda bottles.
---
 She does! It's very similar to the end of a certain questline...
---
Dude you're defending a guy with hundreds of thousands of ULTRACITE ammo. Just stop dude. Ask yourself what you're doing and why.
---
I won't reply to you again.
---
Well, they falsely advertised their collector's edition to me and then leaked my personal info, on top of shipping a broken and empty game while trying to charge $18 for a blue paint job.
---
So.....
---
Mostly I just want to re-create what I did in Fallout 4. It was really fun using Kellog's Pistol but it appears that may not be possible with current balance from comments I see.
---
I don't what to say man, you apparently check every box but your damage output is really, really low?
---
check cheeseburger cake on youtube if you don't believe me, he hits for 15k (sneak) with a halfassed build.
---
My hardwood floors, pipboy skin, succulents, and beer signs give me an unfair advantage.
---
?I duped and didn't get away with it!? Fuck you Bethesda" basic shit now lol
---
Indeed, It’s not an easy gig. 
---
Good moment to stop and say thank you to you guys for doing it. 
---
Thank you :)
---
That would be an awesome drop. I have something to farm for now. Thanks for the info, I had no idea.
---
I've used all that, and have never been able to hit for more than 2500.  I've been running a bloodied build since the Dec.4 update.
---
Right he doesn't mean keycards because I have 12 lol
---
Outfits weigh 0.1lbs, they're not the reason you have no room.
---
Link's Awakening on OG Game Boy kind of did this - if you managed to steal an item from the shop in the main town, the next time you went to the shop you'd be killed by the shop owner and for the rest of the game, your name in all dialogue would be replaced with "THIEF".
---
No, the other way around. I said that I’d rather let cheaters roam free than ban innocents
---
I had issues with my keypad doors also, just ended up deleting them until Bethesda fixes it... Fingers crossed
---
Used to be a tryhard CSGO player. The amount of "I was vac banned for nothing" posts daily were staggering. No different here. You cheated, you got caught, youre banned. 
---
This happens frequently, but on occasion I have found the body a long way off in the same general direction as the enemy was travelling.
---
Even more frequent is the issue of legendary enemies not having any legendary Drop, a few days ago while Stealth Sniping in WS, 7 of 9 Legendary Ghouls killed, all dropped only 1 Bobby Pin &amp; 1 Wonderglue, I server hopped and got much better results on the next server.
---
I didn’t imply anything, I bluntly stated it. I’m sure you asked for one of the things above. You got what you asked for, regardless of whether you like the implementation of it or not. It’s not a single player Fallout, it’s a Fallout Survival game. All survival games have PvP. Most of them aren’t balanced terribly well either, Ark, Rust, No Man’s Sky, etc. These are the games you should compare 76 too, and it’s better than them in my opinion. Your mad you didn’t get a co-op Fallout game, but you were told what this game was from the announcement. Continuing to be salty about it just makes you look crazy. Go play a single player Fallout or Borderlands if you don’t like this game.  
---
Did you read what I said? I was clearly referring to the comments in this thread 
---
You’re a classy person.
---
I wish I could be like you, but I can’t help but think they’re just sadistic sociopaths with no empathy. 
---
No empathy means no hope. No hope means waste of time.
---
I thought only if they had to unlock the lock? I just left it unlocked.
---
&gt; problem with automation and mining jobs vanishing is frightening accurate if overblown with scifi robots
---
Yesss, and I think they should've probably made that into more of a theme than they did.  WV is in some ways the canary in the coal mine of what happens when a company town gets automated and the workers have nowhere to go.  The rest of the US needs to look at us and our struggles and think about what is going to happen with the continued rise of AI/automation.
---
I think I got them by scraping combat armor. Might be worth giving that a shot.
---
Iron clad perk as well, but is 5 endurance perk points for 50 DR
---
Only behemoths I've seen we're in downtown Charleston. I was level 15 and doing a supply drop mission. When I showed up at the drop there were 3 lvl 50's camped out on it. Used a stealth boy to run up and grab the loot and run away. Got away with it but boy was I sweating.
---
They're both pretty obscene.  Melee can be pretty potent even without investment, and with proper investment, it's ridiculously powerful.  The only way melee and unarmed could be even more powerful is if the furious modifier had no hard cap on damage like in Fallout 4, and then people with mechanical melee weapons would be dealing obscene amounts of damage very quickly.
---
Believe me, I'm sure if melee gets nerfed, you will see twice as many complaints on forums as when the ranged legendary modifiers got nerfed.
---
Dolly Sods?
---
your life must really suck
---
Yep, I forgot about ironclad 
---
So when can we expect a fixe for this Bethesda? Should not be to hard to atleast write an answer ? Or am i wrong? 
---
no, sorry i feel the price is fair as i rarely see these plans drop
---
That was pretty cool, even when I knew it was coming.
---
lol yup totally believe you.
---
If my son ignored my warning not to take duped items, I'd explain to him that he has learned an important lesson: listen to Dad.
---
the Lil B "meme" was long before "Drumpf" 
---
not everything has to be politics desu 
---
*sigh* agreed.
---
Tried to block those out of my memory but admittedly they have indeed made some pretty amateur blunders.
---
But the things I buy from the Atomic shop are usually clean. So...clean underwear atomic shop item?
---
&gt; No, it was the amount on his actual characters at the time of the ban. The email even pointed that out. 
---
The BGS statement in the linked image does not say that. You're assuming that's what it means, but we don't know what BGS actually means by "has acquired X over 30 days of game play."
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDiHxJL-e7I
---
this guy is a good reference. but his build isn't that good, you can improve the damage with booze, minmaxed gear (+str), etc.
---
Yes please my psn is jimmytheowl
---
Right? Like workshops needed to be any more useless and annoying.
---
We need our damn PvE servers already.
---
Vats crits, pistols get the most use out of vats
---
Not digging for it. Had it setup for crafting bullets. You find it, I dont need to keep proving myself, you offer zero proof
---
Ill be on in an hour ish
---
Stringy meat. Salty meat. Dry meat. Chewy meat. 
---
The pro is running virtual machines. It takes work to not spoof the data. Built in to the image. 
---
Oh. That's almost comical. Technically, they kept their promise to reinstate the accounts, lol!
---
fair enough, can i come to you? are you online?
---
At this point I’m betting that person is you, considering how terrible your reading comprehension and word choice are, I would not at all be surprised that you would misconstrue “While standing and not moving” as obviously crouching is not standing, LOL.
---
Lol I’ve got at least 80k ultracite ammo atm does that make me a duper because I know how to farm? Guess you’ve never interacted with traders in this game, anyways I hope you find peace man because seems like you’re upset at the world or something. I diligently went through how easy it is to farm these items if you play 6+ hours a day like me, the OP plays 10+ hours a day. Just because you might not have the time to do so and can’t comprehend simple role playing aspects makes your argument, or lack thereof, mute. Have a good day and Please stop with the personal attacks it makes you look intellectually weak.
---
Well, you can still eat it...
---
Seriously. Just burned through 2000+, and now I have to go remake my whole base since it was at max budget.
---
Link?
---
BSG employees elaborated here saying it was allowed. BSG employees&gt;TOS
---
I got banned from the bedroom. my wife found me jerking it off to asian teens
---
Great, are you done yet little bitch? You obviously care enough to reply... just act the grown ass man you claim to be and keep your big mouth shut. 
---
i purchased a couple of fallout 4's songs on iTunes lolol
---
Not as bad as yours considering you waste time pondering the quality of life of a random stranger posting about the likelihood progression of this game based on our first 3 months of updates.
---
Yer all a buncha hoors!
---
Not digging for it, You find it, I don't need to keep proving myself, you offer zero proof yourself.
---
I don't understand why yall aren't churning the things out like candy. You should be throwing them at us by the bushel. They're one of the few things people really want.
---
I JUET GOT ONE!!!!!  Thank you for your offer tho 
---
I gave you the first few...
---
I've noticed him throwing a pity party in quite a few posts since the patch
---
If you don’t want to wait for Bethesda to fix it, just go on the trading forums (r/market76). There’s heaps of traders who will craft serums for you for free or just for the mats. 
---
That’s a good point. I wish I knew for sure what the actual fuck the numbers really meant. So much of this game, mechanics included, has been guess work.
---
Yeah, uh guns can also only target one person at a time and sustain fire on one target, a single 2k melee swing will one-shot most enemies
---
The above solution is confirmed to work :)
---
Sweet, glad to hear, now to find the flaming long bar mod!
---
I am not really close to this but from what I can tell the ban is also not permanent. The 900h guy's email from Bethesda states they will re-enable his account as soon as they fix the exploits he used. So it really doesn't sound that bad to me. If you duped and got caught, they will re-enable your account at a future date.
---
Doesn't sound like a bad trade off, you did a risk / reward roll and got caught and then punishment isn't even permanent.
---
Did you put 900 hours into making them..?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Haha
---
No you didn't. I asked for a link to where he said he was macroing.
---
Not to mention Macroing has nothing to do with this ban anyways, as the email clearly states he was banned for having too many items. NOT macroing.
---
This, automatic weapons too. Auto receivers seem to reduce AP cost on most guns. Twelve unmissable critical heads is pretty good damage.
---
So he has the image back up is this post just to hate on him now or?
---
No rip. Just reapply mutation (yes, hassle) and reequip the weapon. 
---
How about a new Mutation that does what the Rad Worms did regarding positives and re-engineering the negatives?
---
I miss my wormy little friends.
---
Do yourself a favor and unsub. This sub is clearly upsetting you. If you don't like the game anymore, don't subject yourself to the news about it.
---
I do have to say I'm impressed with how well all the instruments sync up with one another when multiple people are using them.
---
The numbers people show off are cheesed with chems, bobbleheads (sometimes stacking inappropriately), and temp effects, as well as every possible perk and having under 20% health.
---
You forgot Nerd Rage
---
I guess we will. I mean we have my first hand experience, versus your anecdotal retelling of "a couple people" who "went through the effort of doing complete scrap and rebuilds" unless we are to believe that your level 15 and level 109 have item for item identical maxed out builds. 
---
We'll never know..
---
Which helmet?
---
&gt; Ultracite are very rare outside of nuke zones (and remains rare inside of one), 
---
No, it's not. The stuff is everywhere in ore form around the fissures and in the glassed cavern, and you get a bunch of it from scrapping SB wings/bones. I keep 500 of it stashed and throw away/sell the rest; even with holding 20k ultracite .50 cal at once and topping that up every few days of play, ultracite is the least of my worries for ammo crafting.
---
My boss says he can't remember it ever happening for any game.
---
It would be nice.  Sadly, not everyone can play with a group or rely on randoms to use some of those perks effectively.  I'm also pretty sure they patched the no rads taken exploit.
---
Exactly you’ve only been playing a fucking week, I have 900 hours in this game, my opinion obviously holds much more weight.
---
You shouldn’t even been giving out your opinion of the game until you’ve played it enough time to experience everything, you sound like crappy critics that write a game review after 10-20 hours of gameplay.
---
PogU
---
This is freakin awesome! Thank you for this! I was thinking of heading to West Virginia for this exact reason. I’ve done the same thing with new Vegas and fallout 4 and this was next on my list :)
---
Yeah my jimmies remain unrustled due to knowing that this is exactly what they are doing. Bethesda thought they’d be able to get by without moderator or GM tools but are quickly realizing that it just won’t work
---
I litterally just deposited the junk I was carrying... and stash was full again.. -crys in a corner-
---
You're a weird dude.
---
I stand corrected
---
BTW: ryzen 2600 here and using a 1440p 144hz freesync monitor with the gtx1080 is awesomeness.
---
It's not permanent.  Not this time.  Their methods to detect this kind of stuff is only going to get better though, so I assume bad actors are either going to straighten up and get their shit together or leave the game all together.  If not, the next wave might be permanent.
---
We're looking into this, though after some initial investigation, if you had this mutation prior to today's patch, it's not applying its positive effects correctly. If you acquire the mutation after today's patch, it should work as intended. 
---
S-S-S-SUUUUPERRRRR MARSUUUUUPIAL!
---
:D 
---
Protip: Team with fellow mutants, and then have everyone on team engage Stranger Together perk, and SHARE the perk. You'll be soaring again in no-time.
---
Agreed when I have 10 stimpacks that on me weigh 1 lbs but in storage are a few lbs. 
---
Yep you’ve got 800lb now to play with 👍
---
I know certain workbenches (the "dirty" chemistry station and the 
---
 weapons station) the item is larger than they appear, i tried getting both to fit neatly in a large tent and they don't quite fit... most of the time they won't place at all, sometimes, they turn green, but then still claim to be overlapping. Sometimes they will place but appear on top of the tent. I just want it inside and not in the middle!
---
My bad bro 
---
I'll just respond with the exact same thing you told me when I asked you first for a link where he said he was macroing.

Oh I know, I was asking if it had been suggested. :) Thanks though
---
Are you capable of rational debate, or do you just want to keep attacking me and making assumptions?  I made this post to help the ill-informed, and so far I have just had pretentious redditors criticizing my word choices.  Wait NVM, standard reddit discussion carry-on...
---
Yes. You either go into a Power Armour and only get the benefits of the Power Armour or you stay out of it and get the benefits of your armour pieces.

There’s also a decent playlist on Spotify I enjoy listening to, it’s missing a few tracks but still holds up. On that note, the original soundtrack by Inon Zur is something special

Not really. Just tired of the tantrums.

Cheater.

yea, im on now. Gt: AvG Zero

It basically did say that by banning him - Which basically states that is not consistent with legitimate play.  What is damming is the fact of other lies he told too. He came here claiming he got banned during the ban wave for duping and that it was not a legit ban but come to find out He got banned before the whole duping ban wave even happened and then came here trying to get people on his side basically. Inconsistency like that don't point out to a truthful person. I have also seen people say he admitted to duping but that he deleted that thread. I can't confirm that though. 
---
It's been stolen and that's what it means now, gotta keep up.  people that post it know what they are doing (generally)
---
Because we're foolishly clinging to the idea we should be able to sell off the excess instead of drop it on the ground. x.x Thats what gets me at least.
---
I wonder if Bethesda is planning to take the game F2P after all. I can’t think of any other reasonable explanation.
---
Did I have Radworms before the patch? I get if often because I usually run into hoards of ghouls but impossible to say whether I had it when I last logged out.
---
Do I have other mutations? I do, 7 others but they all show the correct stats and I can tell they are working correctly.
---
I’ve played for a couple of hours tonight and definitely something has considerably reduced the damage buff to all my weapons that I used to experience from the Adrenal Reaction mutation. I tested removing my rads completely and then going back to about 30% health. Looking at my rifle and pistol damage did not change at all. Both far lower than before the patch. I have a legendary hardened explosive pistol that now does just 40 damage and a similar sniper that has lost so much. Rad levels are not giving me any buff anymore. 
---
But in short, the Adrenal Reaction mutation now gives no positive effect,only the reduction in HP. 
---
Yes, please! I have 3 travel agents! What's the point of that?! 
---
That's possibly from a long time ago.  I remember on release that the requirements were pretty crazy and annoying to farm for.  The numbers I posted are from screenshots from a couple weeks back that I made so I could start farming mats for armor with a new character.    
---
That said, it's 28 springs total for both level 45 legs if you aren't using the Power Smith perk, so maybe that's what you're thinking about in terms of around 30.  
---
Either way, the point is that there is no change of materials requirement from a couple weeks ago despite the notes saying there should be, so I'm waiting to see if there's any official word on it.  
---
If we count the fake beta (they made virtually no changes when the actual game released), 4 months.
---
I don't want to complain, rather I would like to have a constructive discussion on the current meta and compare it to a past one
---
Haha what a nice picture that made in my head.
---
I don’t disagree, but you present these two things as mutually exclusive.  Other companies find a way to both improve the game AND maintain a stable economy.  
---
No friend.  Bethesda has dropped the ball. And there is no happy ending in sight.  They have become increasingly aloof toward an already dwindling player base, at the exact moment merchants are marking their game down to five dollars, just to clear it off their shelves.
---
I got the pics. I’m at 543 with 40 strength. I’m kinda surprised actually. Now I just have to figure it out. They’ll probably be hyperlinked in an edit on this post
---
Player I minimizer now on sale in the atom shop!
---
It might do you well to look up the ten commandments of rational debate, as you violated quite a few.
---
Wait, so keycards remain usable even after the codes expire? I guess I misremembered.
---
I just looked and I have almost 27,000 various rounds.
---
Incorrect, I follow all the rules in the TOS.
---
Nah, that requires some Int investment.
---
And that's to far in between.  Too many people only want to complain.

But you can get another 1-level card like travelling agent, which makes no sense
---
One thing in high numbers of items, thanks to weight perks and being a loot goblin I occasionally realize I’m carrying around too much useless ammo and dump it or give it away.
---
Finding 100,000 nuka colas? Probably duped. Finding 2,000 10mm ammo? Someone didn’t pay enough attention while looting and culling their inventory
---
If they have the data its prohibitive at this point in this one paticular case to withhold it, his case has a substantial amount of visibility, whether it's a lie based on a great story he created or truth based on him trading ammo with himself, clarifying how much ammo he currently has would help them from hemmoraging players with already disrupted faith in Bethesda.
---
As for using macros or abusing server lag, similar stories could be said about relogging to farm a nuked white springs or cap stashes.  There are so many exploitable things in this game that are found acceptable, I think duping was the line in the sand and it should be.   I think overclicking an item is abusing an oversight but IMHO not in and of itself a bannable offense.  
---
I know that everytime I relog while wearing my excavator it loads me with an extra 100 carry capacity,  I log out in my armor consistently therefore knowingly abusing an exploit.   Should I be banned for it, some people probably think yes, then again why should I take my power armor off everytime I log out.
---
Every exploitable feature of the game is there as a result of a bug that should have been fixed, Bethesda screwed that up and I believe as such should voice what they are going to ban people for and then ban those people (they have done so with duped items for example).  Smaller exploits should simply be fixed instead of resulting in a ban on someones account (such as the infinite carry glitch).
---
I'm a legal setting based on past precedents they should not ban individuals who used small less damaging exploits and should ban people who continue to abuse something that Bethesda has stated will result in a ban of their account (duping large numbers of items).
---
My only defense for this Individual is based on that past precedent and in the hope that this individual and a select few others were wrongfully targeted in the ban.  Hopefully Bethesda at least looks into the issue enough to determine how justified their actions were, but at this point I doubt they will investigate it any further.
---
ill meet you at vault 76
---
I liked the game. I put up and tolerated the nonsense that is still going on and would like to play again, but not at the state it's in now
---
 All they give a shit about is money from the atom store. They have QoL fixes that are left from FO4
---
Glad I could help, even inadvertently!

Have you ever used a third party site to facilitate a trade? Cheater.
---
How/when was/have I thrown a tantrum? I was just letting people know a major retailer is pulling the game. 
---
You're just some weird downvote bitch who comments dumb shit that adds nothing to anything. 
---
On this occasion, I hadn't been there for a few days.  
---
Ah gotcha thanks
---
Yip. Unfortunutely, they are ussing weight to limit the non-stackables. It's not exactly efficient. 
---
Frankly they should just make junk weightless in Stash and give a cap... say.. 999 of each. It'd solve alot. &gt;.&gt; 
---
No, it’s their way of saying they made a mistake and telling you how to work around it sooner rather than later.
---
Get off the soap box. We need the soap. 
---
I found a two star two shot exploding assault rifle literally my first session after the TSE nerf.
---
I see what you mean, but some of those legendaries I got outside of the golf course. For example, I got an AAE gat gun 3* from uranium fever, which was sadly lost in the bag. But I do agree with you, and as you can see in my post, I dont want I back badly, I just want it to be used
---
Not only were games and hardware more expensive, but I don’t think they were as readily available as they are now.
---
My 80’s game collection peaked at three titles.  If I wanted to play more I would trade with the other kids in the area.
---
Amen
---
The Kinetic Dynamo pairs very well with the dodgy perk and if you pair it with the AP regen leg mods your AP bar never really empties
---
Not today, I hadn't been there for a few days now.   I guess they ended that little trick 
---
&gt; Not true. Also just imagine you play with 1 friend and you help each other out to transfer ammo to a mule. Both of you need to own only 50k ammo. For a second you'll carry his 50k and he carries yours. Both would get flagged for 100k.
---
&gt; Or imagine you just buy 5-10k ammo from a few other players. If you bought to much over 30 days you'll get flagged &amp; suspended
---
In my case I'm thinking of how my wife and I play: she's heavy weapons, and I play ranged sniper and lug around her spare ammo and supplies. It's not unusual for me to transfer 5k 5mm ammo to her in one go if we're going through areas with really heavy combat (thanks Bandolier). Keep in mind I have an 8-5 job and we can only play so much. If I was playing all day I'm sure I would have transferred well over 100k of 5mm ammo to her in 30 days.
---
No idea on the Ultracite ammo though. I honestly never use it.
---
You might want to look at those commandments yourself, I’m sure somewhere in there they include that there has to be something to debate for there to be a rational debate. There is nothing to debate, you have bad word choice and grammar that prevents your message from being conveyed, there is nothing to debate about that.
---
Always good to know the unpaid labor from fans playing this flimsy beta is appreciated.
---
Slow down, cowboy.
---
You are a bit butthurt, why don't you go play outside and get some fresh air? You'll feel better, I promise.
---
Or as an added bonus. Allow us to attach weight reduction Perks to our stash. Say a maximum of 3 point slots or something. You can either have the card attached to your Player Inventory or your Stash. The Perk cards need more durability
---
I accidentally scrapped my Atom Shop bought cowboy hat and had to go with the free top hat action :) If we buy an item in the atomic shop and accidentally scrap it make an option to re-buy it instead of (owned) that's another thread I guess..
---
I just want a Red Deadpool Skin for my Excavator. :D
---
My first guy was a pistol build because I figured the pipe bolt action would have a .50cal receiver like in FO4 and you could make that a pistol. But I was wrong.  Vats and all the pistol dmg cards are your only option. Before the tse nerf I had a tse western revolver doing 1300 and black powder pistol 2300 SMG but now they're not as strong. Concentrated fire to vats headshots with crit/sneak perks was the only way to use em.
---
Nope, I don't trade.

for comparison, mine is:

I'm actually working on an SMG build right now but it's more of a hybrid build since you can't really make a true dedicated SMG build since the only perk cards that matter to an SMG build all Ranks of the Commando perk + Tank Killer + (Optional) Ground Pounder. Everything else can be put into anything you want but if you want to maximize DPS invest in Tenderizer + Bloody Mess. Here's my build if you're curious:

---
That may not be the case if you also assume that moving items into and out of stashes adds to the tally. In that case I would expect no relation between the numbers for the two accounts since the mule could have moved things back and forth between character and stash multiple times for whatever reason. Consider that when you pull a legendary item out of your stash, it causes the same popup in the middle of the screen showing you the item that you see when you first loot it from a body. The game doesn't appear to understand that you already "own" that item even though it came from your stash.
---
There really isn't any convincing evidence either way so I have no idea if that could be what's happening, but it seems plausible. I still wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't be surprised if there actually was a flaw in the way commodities like ammo are tracked either.
---
I mean, I'm...with you, until the end. Your "admission" makes you part of the problem.   
---
I earnestly believe that the only reason the lot of you who knowingly purchased duped goods didn't loose them is it's a sad fucking massive chunk of the player base.   
---
You \_all\_ deserve consequences for your actions.   
---
You supported that economy, you supported the assholes who did this, you provided them with the validation and the rewards to keep making the game more shitty for the lot of us.   
---
You made yourself more powerful illicitly. Without demand, the supply would not have been produced. 
---
it was a joke bro, chill
---
I've learned long enough not to rely on Bethesda to fix the problems they themselves created.
---
We where refering to the ultracite armor.. but yeah. Jetpack for all power armors. Including raider. Could be made out of junk.
---
That seems complicated. I'd obviously take it... but there's gotta be something simplier.
---
Personally, I'm in favor of just making broken down junk weightless once stashed. Treat it like a currency once you deposit it.  
---
That should solve most of our issues.
---
The codes are no longer useable
---
You can but flux sells for a fair amount of caps 100 to 200 a pop even assuming he only bought half it'd still be 4x the cap limit at it's cheapest
---
Here are just some quickly, I will try to find more but they are rather old and hard to find as they are from pre-patch 5

Rock solid????? Have you found a mythical private server? Nothing has changed and all they keep doing with their updates is causing more issues. Take for instance today the update is out and now they have broken adrenal reaction. Anyone that says there aren’t any issues isn’t playing or smoking a glass pipe?
---
Well.......... bye.

I get that, just want to make clear that isn't the intention of this post :)

Hi,
---
Definitely not overheating.  I monitor temps and GPU settles in at around 70 celcius.
---
I actually a couple of weeks ago installed a thermal pad mod that EVGA sent to customers of their 1080 cards so it is defo not thermal throttling.  Thanks for the reply though.
---
If by various you mean all ammo, that's really not much. But this is how much is acquired over a 30 day period. 100k of any is kind of insane, 100k ultracite... math has shown it's possible, but I am not willing to buy that people are spending like 6 hours a day just toward efforts of creating ammo.  I mean why?  Regular ammo isn't that much worse, you only need it for maybe the SBQ, and you don't really need it for that. Might make it a little faster, but you'd have to be sort of deranged to be willing to invest that much time just to take down an SBQ with a crappy loot table over and over.
---
Agree
---
It definitely exists but there’s no proof. Even if it doesn’t exist in Fallout 76 by some miracle it definitely exists somewhere in the world
---
both of those are post nerf, not requesting the nerf...
---
Wasn’t asking u nerd 
---
Same issue here.   My one character never has the password from the very beginning.   The other character I spend time on was fine until a month ago and then he needed the password again.   Haven't bothered with this quest since.
---
If you're on ps4 I think I still have mine you can have
---
Good way to alert teammates and other players to your location so you can group up/fight/call for aid. But it's kinda pointless since you can just fast travel to teammates and see others on the map at all times (Wanted status aside).
---
I already noticed some of the changes after playing a bit this morning.  Thank you for more stash limits and less work needed for power armor.  I even saw my first mothman.  The event is cute.  
---
Absolutely. Dear Bethesda when you have many players on one server people crave IDENTITY. Right now a selfie in the game could be anyone, but if you let people choose their color scheme and skins, the combinations of armor and weapons will be unique and people will buy it. Currently we all look like mass produced robots. 
---
I keep crashing while in load screen....xbox one x on standard lan hard wired to the xbox...
---
I feel sorry for some kid out there that doesnt know what duping is, stumbles upon the motherload in a suit case and gets banned.
---
Thanks for the info!  Hey Bethesda... if you would add the perk loadout manager to the game I wouldn't have to do this.
---
Oh, that makes sense. I thought I got a few as drops for some reason.
---
Your inability to get to your claimed point from the actual text of the BGS message really says all that needs to be said. 
---
I have no idea if the guy was duping or not, but BGS hasn't told us one way or the other how much of anything he had on an account at once.
---
It's all good!
---
I have no mouth and I must scream. 
---
Adios! 
---
Yup me too lol, logging in for the first time in a while when I get home. Never duped so hopefully im good.
---
That sounds awesome. Like clusterfuck piled on clusterfuck!
---
I'm looking so forward to this increase.
---
However, I also know deep in my heart that it's going to go the same way as the 'A person will never need a HDD bigger than this 160 MB one'.
---
Any tips on avoiding Scorchbeasts during that trip? 
---
Yes, I literally said I was finding some examples quickly for you, these are calling for further nerfs, It will take me a while to find the original posts as they are old, but many will attest that it was the general sentiment on reddit for a while.
---
**Bethesda needs to learn what BALANCE means before they make more changes.**
---
Triple nuke nerfing TSE into the ground just changed the meta to Bloody / Instigating / Anti-Armor guns.   Also ranged mains swapped to Melee builds.
---
How bout we quit calling for more NERFs until they learn how to do small buffs and small nerfs to make ALL builds viable?
---
Or you can keep blindly yelling for "nerf this, nerf that, oh you missed a nerf over there!" until no builds are viable.
---
They need to do small nerfs and small buffs over time, just like League of Legends does it.  At no point did I have to "completely abandon" a character because they got a nerf, or switch mains because of a buff was "too OP".
---
GPU temps settle at around 70 degree celcius so it's defo not that.
---
It is a perplexing one this.  Really seriously pissing me off! 
---
Thanks for your answers.  I will keep on trying to find the solution.  Maybe I format again and start from scratch.  Meh.
---
I have not played other games for so long now too that it won't be as easy for me to load up another game and see whether it does it in that game. 
---
Mehhhh :P

If you don't like the content of the forum, don't post here?

"If you don't like it leave" mentality goes both ways. 
---
That Will surely net you a hefty package off good stuff :D
---
You dont like the duping, cool. But it's a game and theres glitches in almost every game. If you are using one of those duped items then by the same logic you also should get f'd. But to say banned? That's too far for me. Remove the items (which Bethesda Finally attempted to do after months) but a whole ban? Or even delete that character. But not a whole ban
---
He bullshitting just wants attention....why he deleted his post like a coward 
---
that's why I said his build was halfassed. you can get comparable, not as good but still good enough, numbers, solo. he's not using party boy/girl for one, and I don't think any of his gear has +str.
---
it \*might\* be worth to invest in SiN regardless, since adrenal is such a common mutation and you can just invite randoms for the queen.
---
but speaking of the queen, yes, they indeed have patched the diluted rad-x thing. shame but it doesn't quite work in nuke zones anymore. everywhere else though, it's a beast.
---
Players will always follow the Meta.
---
Yep, the hardware was incredibly expensive when taking inflation into account :
---

---
Atari 2600 was around $800 in todays dollars.  
---
A dunce cap would be awesome hahaha!
---
I legit checked the atom shop and still missed it. 
---
Hahaha great point 
---
Have to respectfully disagree....   
---
Before the "Black Tuesday" weight cap patch I would do a good 6 - 9 hour WhiteSprings farming cycle (nuked) and walk away with a combined 20,000 pounds of "loot" on my 3 accounts...    
---
Usually 250 - 400 hardened masses, etc...    
---
Plus a good number of high quality Legendaries to trade...  
---
So I do that 3 times in WhiteSprings and I'm close to the number of mats for Fluxes, and can easily trade for the steel/lead/acid...   etc needed...  
---
On a good day, I can get 200 to 400 pure violet fluxes by server hopping SBQ Nukes and doing about a 20'ish minute cycle on 2 accounts getting between 100 and 140 raw violets per character... do that a few days in a row and you've got all the Violet flux you need.  
---
Really the ultracite ammo represents about a full weeks (off work) work, assuming you trade for some of the needed comps, and is easy to have stored up over 3 months of casual stockpiling
---
So true lol
---
They made money by selling this DLC for a AAA title price. 
---
They should do both. Release some skins for ingame rewards and other skins for scummy atomic shop items.
---
That's a really interesting idea that would certainly add another layer of depth I suppose. You'd start seeing Plague Walker meta builds, haha. 
---
On top of that, if they added it to the game directly then we would probably be able to use hotkeys to switch between them instead of having to open up perk view each time.
---
More likely custom ink load order with new texture files, I suspect, but haven't yet proved. 
---
My points are based off both the BGS email and what the OP had stated not only in the thread he deleted but another thread that he kept editing. It's not just off the email telling him why he was banned. 
---
my theory is he is trying to use a TSE single action weapon(because of the post) and because of the poor accuracy of those weapons and the ungodly amount of sound they make when the bullets hit, he is being swarmed or taken out of stealth because his gun might as well be a rocket launcher. Thus He is losing his sneak attack. He needs an  better rifle. NOT to shit on your OP but, tse weapons for a sneak build is like trying to use a hammer to spread butter onto bread. Sure it will work... but, it's stupid and not going to work very well.
---
its your custom ini file. Many people have posted fix, can't link them for you at the moment but shouldnt be hard to find.
---
Oof, if vats is essential I guess I'll pass. I don't mind vats but it's still wonky in whether or not it hits.
---
Just one quick question, have you ever seen a scorched run backwards as quickly as you run forwards while shooting at you until he finally has to reload or it’s pathing hits a wall? Melee rushes because it’s the only way it can deal damage but not all gun slinging enemies will stand still for you to run up to them. I’ve literally been killed by a scorched wielding a pumped running as fast backwards as I do forwards. I couldn’t get close enough to hit him
---
Wood was just an example. The enemy stars are meaningless at this time. Why even have them if they are unrelated to the legendary item?  I honestly believe it’s because they are too lazy to add the extra lines of code to parse the loot table by enemy rating. It’s easier if they just all feed from one table. 
---
Key-cards are separate from the codes and don't expire.
---
But there's the problem.  You don't need crazy damage outputs anywhere else but for the queen.  At least in my case.  I don't care for pvp
---
okay...  
---
Ultracite needs buffs too.  
---
Not to speak for anyone else, but I'm a \_fallout\_ fan. I've been playing these game since before their current developer got their filthy mits on the franchise.   
---
I enjoy the elder scrolls games, but it came the other way around. I enjoyed fallout LONG before I was cornered into playing bethesda titles in order to play fallout games. 
---
Up to 120 if you get lucky and hit all of the spots.
---
No I have 27k I’ve made in the past two days including 4K ultracite .50. That’s not counting the thousands I’ve given away or muled. It’s completely plausible if that dudes playing 65 hours a week like he claims. I don’t pick flowers all that often so I’m not sure how much flux you would need for that much.
---
I can’t speak to his derangement but I certainly wouldn’t go after her that often. :)
---
Cya! 
---
I have indeed, in fact while I was using my all rise backup and I simply used VATs to get close to them 
---
Man, over 150 visits, and no mod.  I'm so pissed off.  I saw it once ONCE! Super early on for me and I was like 150 caps short...went out searching for supermutants to farm caps from, got the 150 and....yep. Got kicked off the Mother effing server.  I get making it rare, but this is ridiculous.  
---
Bye 👋 
---
I really can't wait to see a pink bunny power armor paint for $20 that I am absolutely not going to buy because it's ridiculous.
---
If he mandatory sentence on murder was 25 years and the law states so, are you gonna be butthurt when you're sentenced to 25 years? Don't dupe, don't get banned. Easy as that.
---
mobs have been dropping their equipped weapons lately. like, they're just lying on the floor and you can even pick them up. I don't know if the weapon is actually removed from their dead inventory when that happens, though.
---
but that could be the case. you'd never find a gamma gun in the middle of all that tall grass during a nuke.
---
Well at least you will probably die before reproducing and further the decline of humanity.   You should also never stick paper clips in outlets.  Or put your head in the oven while the gas is on.  
---
Not gonna lie. If they added heart boxers to the Atom Shop as under-armor, I'd totally buy it.
---
I get it. 
---
Those cynical drip-feed “jokes” are not jokes. 
---
They’re a form of bullying. 
---
If you drip exactly such mild cynical “joke” remarks on your domestic partner each day, your partner will have legal grounds for domestic abuse. So it with a kid around and you have a second victim too. Don’t read into that as “you’re a nut job who glasses their family members”, thats not the point and most definitely not aimed at you, I’m just making a point that this form of subtle stinging is not benign, and that really cuts the people it hits, and this is studied to death and well based. 
---
When you post it here, 
---
1. You’re hitting people who work in Bethesda, not “some corporation”. People who worked hard for a long time so you can have something. 
---
2. You’re also hitting others here. It’s very unpleasant. Me in this case.

Please, just don’t. 
---
I almost had this but ran out of time earlier trying ini combos. Thanks! 
---
Two Shits got nerfed, that's why.
---
True, but they were the first to go in my stashpurges as they were easily replacable and my legendaries not.
---
And actually, at one point i just got rid of them all in one go as chosing which one to keep was getting to timeconsuming.
---
I think you have to buy the plan or get it from events. I got mine from a treasure map.
---
Shutting down pointless negativity is a worthwhile use of time.  
---
Again, this doesn't really add anything to anything. You're just some dude who most people on this sub probably straight up hate.
---
You're gonna reply with some kinda-sorta not really clever reply to make yourself feel better, but not so deep down you know it's true. And you could fix that and improve yourself, but that takes effort. And effort just isn't your thing.
---
Beth?
---
It just works.™
---
Speed Demon was working for me. I just got off 5 minutes ago.
---
Seems pretty legit but you make more an hour than most occupations that require 8 years of school.
---
Because my original post I had a typo. 
---
Hell if they do that and i wasnt suspended right now i would want one anyway lol
---
Jeez guys, it was a joke; I found the word "investigation" to be humorous in this context. 
---
It's what I'm guessing. 
---
Yep, thanks 👍
---
Use VATS til your critical meter is full, then when you go for the next enemy (in Theo case, the griefer), hit Y before pulling the trigger. The critical meter is only visible while in VATS. I could be wrong, I’m not the greatest at this game. 
---
Looks like SuperDuper isn’t working after latest patch. I just did an sbq battle then started collecting flash fern. With the amount (142) I should be able to produce 14 stable flux. Back to my camp as soon as I crafted the first one, the ‘super duper’ sound came up so I knew it was working. But that was it. After the first one, nothing more. I continued to craft the next 13 in a row, nada, no super duper. I now have total 15 in my junk. Please Bethesda if you are reading this please take a look at Super Duper functionality. 
---
Me too. Missed opportunity for V-Day.
---
They were supposed to fix one problem with the weapon swap which was, admittedly, needed. However, it looks like they broke something else in the process.
---
As for respawn, it might be that there was another player in the proximity. Can you replicate it?
---
What's the problem you've had with them?
---
Where did you hear this? Because without a source this sounds like complete, unadulterated, speculative (or perhaps misdirecting) bull shit. Do you really think Bethesda can't take a player name and peak into his/her inventories? That they're trying to count the number of items in THEIR databases by...examining old "user X put 36k ammo in stash" logs or something?
---
I think it's a cheap way to increase the game's longevity. lowering the already absurdly low odds of rolling a god 3\* is a great way to keep people playing.
---
Something strange happened after the patch, went into the near the Charleston firehouse and there were 4 behemoths inside with one3 star legendary which were stuck in place. I was able to kill all 4 but is this intended?
---
Perhaps we were fighting the same Scorchbeast Queen. There was a couple of scorched with Tesla guns. I thought it was another player not setting pacifist mode prior to the fight, but when I turned around it was a scorched. I killed it, and another one "picked" it up. Then someone else killed that one with a super sledge. Later I saw another one with a Tesla gun.  
---
The battle went on way too long, and she went out of bounds and left us all standing there for a few minutes while the counter went down. We killed her, and I mentioned on another post that I was down to All Rise and my fists. All my other weapons were broken.
---
The point of this post was not to blindly yell "Nerf Melee" rather to have a discussion comparing this meta to a previous one
---
&gt; No, it was the amount on his actual characters at the time of the ban. The email even pointed that out.
---
This point is utter bullshit, which is what I noted. I don't care about the rest of your points.
---
So you’re telling me I have to get rid of my Adrenal Reaction, run the chance of getting rid of my other mutations, and then reacquire Adrenal Reaction to possibly get it back?
---
Anybody know what the actual buff amount was /is?  I have adrenal now but with a bunch of other mutations so not looking to clear them all. I don’t run a specific build to use it, it’s just one I got during farming. I have Class Freak 3 so it’s only -12 HP but what is the amount of buff I’m missing now?
---
Unfortunately it did not. Removed the mod (which is the only one I had anyway), removed the tag in my custom.ini, and did a scan/repair after update, still getting LOOKUP FAILED for Top of the World.
---
Same..man...it's starting to feel like we've got some secret police to worry about 🤣 r/Bethesdaiswatching
---
:/
---
They are not unrelated. There was a guy who had put together many hundreds of legendary lootings into statistics and it clearly showed that you have a much higher chance of getting a 2 or 3 star items from a 2 or 3 star enemy. Still not a great chance, but still a better one. It was a few days ago, but if you search the reddit your should be able to find the statistics on it.
---
It was fun while it lasted, but I can't say I'm too bothered by it.
---
you obviously did not read what he is claiming. he claimed to have crafted all that ultracite.
---
I would love these :)
---
I had a level 200 something completely waste me while wearing a goddam clown costume. I didn’t even accept pvp and it took 1-2 shots. I thought that wasn’t even possible, since I didn’t retaliate. 
---
You can get the plans from treasure maps, you would be better off buying those and digging them up.
---
I'm saying vats crit to get the most. My pistol guy just had all pistol perk cards maxed for dmg, bloody mess and adrenal reaction mutation. And I never used vats
---
For that price you better suicide bomb with a Fatman every encounter 
---
Ha... I love it. Stretchy Pants.
---
I like the idea. I have the same issue. When I look in the stash, I have to take them all out to figure which one is the one I want. That is a great suggestion.
---
You are 100% right on. My latest character is 2 handed melee for this very reason. You can shoot me 5 times with a shotgun and then I one-hit you. Totally unrealistic. 
---
Why does a .308 round do 200 damage out of a rifle and 20 damage out of a light machine gun? That's just bullshit. This game is clearly made by Skyrim people who are salty as fuck that a full auto rifle should shred you in seconds. 
---
Somebody has to care about that guy down by the bridge tho
---
Outfit gloves are still broken 😕
---
even though that's a troubleshooter it's still a pretty low output. I'm guessing it's 1k with adrenal?
---
if you ever figure out why let us know. could be a bug, too.
---
Yeah plague walker builds could be viable. 
---
Man, no offense because you're being empathetic to the devs but this excuse is getting so tiring. They already made money off a $60 price tag. I get server costs are a thing but at what point are $18 dollar skins in a $60 game justifiable? If they release expansion packs or DLC I am willing to bet anything that they will charge for it.
---
Battlefield has had dedicated servers for all platforms for a very longass time. No MTX until just recently. Guild Wars 1 was an MMORPG that had intensive server upkeep and their MTX never bothered me as much as Fo76's, so much that I don't even remember what they were.
---
GGG, the devs for path of exile have stated that even if they went out of business, server expenses could be covered out of the CEO's pocket long after the company dissolves. 
---
I honestly think Beth is just adding MTX out of pure greed and nickle and diming players at any opportunity just because they can and some dumb people are willing to put up with it. Look at the CC in Skyrim and Fo4.... both single player games. Ugh.
---
And there was people who actually got banned
---
**But, but, but, that's how Bethesda makes changes!!!!**
---
Step 1 - Watch reddit for something that mildly annoys people.
---
Step 2 - Overreact and change something VERY significantly, don't bother thinking about the implications of it.  Add in a few un-called for nerfs of things people like a lot.
---
Step 3 - Implement patch, people are pissed.
---
Step 4 - Act confused at all the hate, return to Step 1.
---
You want them to change their game development meta?  How dare you sir!  How Dare You!!!!
---
Had this happen to me once. Stopped playing for two weeks. 
---
I’m not really sure. Also that IS with Adrenal. There has to be something in the cards. Either way I do t really need more power than that. It swings good and hits well
---
Will there be an update in the future addressing the enemies lack of reaction to being attacked or shot? Its hard to know if you hit them with a mele weapon when they dont stagger but just continue walking, this issue is especially apparent with the scorched who are unphased by all attacks.
---
You reserve it for here, bitching and moaning about peoples legitimate complaints. 
---
*get your quality psychological therapy with our expert - our Meijer employee!*
---
This is comedy gold.
---
I have never made ultracite rounds as of yet but I can say if I didn’t work and ran around with in game friends downing the queen.I can easily earn over 90 ultracite a day. Easily,  so if what you say is right I could very easily make let’s see let’s just say 50 a day 50x72=3600x30=108000 well that’s easy to get banned for playing legit....
---
I believe it bugs out with other speed bonuses. I have a faster reload shotgun and it constantly breaks. my movement speed too when emergency protocols is active.
---
Thought the statue was at least 1400 like the red rocket. prices are finally fair
---
Or driving them away. Unfortunately I believe it’s a double edged sword. The absolute grind to farm enough to get something “exciting” may be too much for a casual player. 
---
Maybe that could be fixed by removing all objects’ health bars from everyone else’s vision except for the object’s owners. Adding guesswork to trollery might dissuade a few folks from that sort of thing.
---
Nice. What speed is your ram? Sounds like you have nicer system then I do, but I had some weird issues with ram auto timings on a b350 mobo. I had to manually set the xmp timings (primary and secondary) to get it to work properly.
---
Yup, exactly what I feel right now. 
---
I first updated it thinking that would work. Then tried completely removing. 
---
Heck you mean man, 60 caps an hour x 24 = 1440. Do the vendor runs each day and you get 1400 caps. So 3 hours of this guy is like 15% of the caps you get in a day just from vendors.
---
Well shut my mouth then. TIL, cheers
---
Why you ungrateful little.........
---
Yep, you're right!  lol
---
I thought they said that they fixed legendaries not dropping the correct star item.  Guess not!
---
That’s fair.  
---
The way I look at the whole Bethesda thing is similar to how I see any long running series.
---
As an example I am a fan of the old Leisure Suit Larry games, but after Sierra went under the quality of the newer games went downhill.
---
I am still a fan of the series, and try each new release, but I don’t get worked up when they don’t live up to previous releases.
---
You just proved my point.
---
Gosh, banned cheater turns out to be a liar too.
---
&gt;Well there's this weird backlash that post history is somehow private information and going through it is somehow an invasion of privacy.   
---
&gt;I assume this comes mostly from people with posts they don't want to be judged by. 
---
It's publically available. You didn't need to hack anyone or pay money to get to it or use the Wayback Machine thing to travel back into the past to find it. It's just there if you look for it.
---
I might personally think it's a bit sad, especially if you're so desperate to win an argument that you go back many years or take something out of context. Aside from that though, if there's record of it that's publically available, it's fair game.
---
So it exists! Huzzah! I've been banking treasure map. I'll try that
---
I am the statistical outlier then, as I get either nothing or one star drops from three star legendary enemies. I I would say 3 stars from 3 stars for me is less than 10 percent. 
---
Well not really. At Verizon so much of what agents could do was blocked by managers who said those things were only reserved for escalations. 
---
True. But you can toss him a few caps for a handjob. 
---
Have you tried a hard restart of the xbox? Turn off the console with the main power button and hold it in for 10 seconds. Then start it again.
---
Oh come on pls...
---
Plastic isn't that hard to find.
---
I just used an Adrenal Reaction serum to attempt to re-acquire the mutation. The serum did not work. It gave me the temporary effect of suppressing the negative effects of the mutation, but it did not apply the mutation at all. This is still very much broken.
---
72k 5mm is a lot but certaintly craftable/lootable.  I had 30k at one time with very little effort. 
---
What point? That you are butthurt enough to insult people on the Internet?
---
Just grow up.
---
Yeah I was shocked 
---
ALL of your friends have been banned?? Either this is a joke or you roll with the most infamous dupers in all of Fo76
---
I'm pretty sure the servers are capped much lower than 100 people. 
---
And I feel sorry for the Bridge guy. Never before have I felt such soft hands.. uh, where was I? Thinking of starting a cap funder for #HandjobBridgeGuy.
---
I have yet to see anyone get a full out ban with this newest wave of salty ness. I have seen plenty of people say they have gotten the email stating that their account is suspended until farther notice. 
---
Your going to compare a murder entrance to a video game? Imma need you to take 20% off there bud. I get your point, dont dupe, it breaks the game. I fully understand that. But it's a game. Discipline the man or ppl. But to ban them? That's extreme. How about I'll comply with the TOS when you comply with making a working game for the full price I paid for it, and not have that game be discounted a month after release for 60% less than what I paid because it was made poorly. If I'm paying for something and agree to comply with it, I better get a working game. Not some duck taped together copy n paste engine from your last game. 
---
Actually it is working if you use the no HUD version it seems but since that version is older you'll have to resave your loadouts again.
---
If you are a stealth shooter who often goes untouched, then you can get by with about 200 DR or less.  To get higher DR, it is easier to just get into a PA rather than spending all those perk points like Barbarian and Evasive.  Not being able to use fist weapons and crafting stations are really the only two negatives of PAs.  Maybe in PvP, you want to have high DR in or out of PA.  But human players have low hit points anyway and could always die in just a few shots -- as opposed to tough A.I. opponents with 3000 to 30000 hit points.
---
If I remember correctly the keypad worked, but the switch on the other side did not which trapped me a few times.
---
Cuz ive been a bad boy, Bethesda ssssspank meeeee!  I dont deserveth theee🙃☹
---
I just used an Adrenal Reaction serum in attempt to re-acquire the mutation. The serum did not work. It gave me the temporary effect of suppressing the negative effects of the mutation, but it did not apply the mutation at all. This is still very much broken.

the word you are looking for is hijacked. my apologies for being Canadian and not caring about your politics or its "stolen memes," but the internet is as much for me as it is you. if this triggers you that much maybe you should report it so my post gets deleted.  
---
Maybe it's meant to be that we have to lose the mutation completely, and then gain it again. Which would be a huge pain in the ass, as well as losing all other mutations .  Anyone wanna be a test subject? Haha 
---
Meh
---
That is one of the items I struggle with too. It would be nice to see how much it weighs with and without the perks along with a total weight for example:
---
10 Fragmentation Grenades **(0.50/0.05)(5.0/0.5)**  
---
As soon as your base is shot you get a miscellaneous bullet saying “Your camp is under attack”. I’ve never went back to camp and discovered it’s the odd mole rat or scorched. It’s always been a player.
---
&gt;Don’t read into that as “you’re a nut job who glasses their family members”, thats not the point and most definitely not aimed at you,
---
I will, and it should, because
---
&gt;this form of subtle stinging is not benign, and that really cuts the people it hits
---
is exactly what I was trying to achieve.
---
I'll not silence myself nor pretend they're anywhere near anything resembling competent just to spare someone's feelings. they're being paid to do a job and this hardly qualifies. whatever happened to responsibility? in other industries, heads would be rolling at this point.
---
facts are facts.
---
correct! Once the vats meter is full, the critical stays until u use it.
---
Loading screen and loot tables 
---
I also want to say that responder vendors might have it? 
---
If you're on PC, I can make it for you.
---
No. Do not do this. Do not listen to this man. This is a horrible idea.   
---
Why? Because I like having rank 5 weapon artisan...and rank 2 for a little better weapon durability. I like being able to toss different cards on depending on my build, and having the ability to have multiple stacks of partially leveled cards is \_essential\_ for this.   
---
Getting them for "free" is absolutely fantastic, because, and this is critical, at this point, I have \_at least\_ partial builds of every perk card I currently want to run. Which means giving me new random cards would be completely useless. The chance of a dupe of a card that I want to be able to run two ways is a \_major\_ bonus to this system. 
---
I'll try to remember to snag it next time.

Subscribe!

Dude, paragraphs.
---
Upvoting your comment on that comment on that piece.
---
Yes, but they have shown in the past to "read the gist" of something and blindly over-react....lol
---
Their track record on nerfing one meta (TSE) and nerfing other really useful things (White Knight) is not very good.
---
They need to take a page from League Of Legends balancing before they even think about more nerfs and buffs.
---
&gt; It's basically the same as fallout 3, new Vegas, and 4 
---
what fucking reality do you live in?  other than aesthetic, what way is it *anything* like those games?
---
as to your question, it affects the overall economy in the game, before the ban/dupe wipe the world was flooded with illegitimate goods negating the need for grinding/farming
---
https://imgur.com/a/HDZytso
---
because crafting 300 boards and causing character rollbacks was causing servers to act super shitty. also thier mules with 1000000k items was also lagging servers. 
---
hey, I'm on your side. this isn't a Korean mmo or a mobile gacha. I have logged hundreds of yours and my biggest pet peeve is the astronomically low odds of rolling good stuff.
---
Someone double nuked on a server I was on today and it caused us to fail :(
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Then you fail to have reading ability. As in my comments, I stated that I could even be wrong about it being the total amount on his persons at one time but that all the other inconsistencies to his story show he was not unfairly banned even if I was wrong about his account having that much ammo at one time.
---
 " I could be wrong but i am pretty sure it was for total amount as the email says you were found exploiting 140k on your main account and also found to be exploiting the secondary account and lists the rest of the ammo and ultracite he had. It also states he will be unbanned after future patches fixes the issues. I take that the issues are duping and things of that nature and once they figure a way to balance all that he will be reinstated. "
---
I was also exited seeing its been a while since i played, logged on, then ran through whitesprings for test, best encounters were 3 x 3star ghouls that dropped armor legendaries, expected all 3 star but guess again. 
---
I agree with your post. I get its wrong. But at the same time they've made these cool items more accessible to more people to use. Instead of 1 guy having a nice car n everyone being jealous over it, not everyone has access to get that nice car. Especially since if you kill a legendary enemy, that enemy can drop a 1 in 342000 different variant possibilities of legendary items.. so the odds of getting that badass two shot explosive whatever are quite slim. Thank gawd for the dupers making some fun items easier to aquire.. 
---
I don´t remember where I raid it, but it was an official bethesda post, they said they plan on having a renaming system where only you can see the changed names.
---
Some of us call when the issue is actually worth calling, in which the rep will need to be told the issue, which takes 60 seconds, then put you on hold for 10 minutes to google the answer or ask the supervisor what to do.  Better to skip the echo.
---
Research [suggests](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/02/27/283348422/that-s-unfair-you-say-this-monkey-can-relate) that primates have an innate sense of outrage at perceived unfairness.
---
People can be having a great time in Fallout 76, but if they think that someone else is having an even better go of it for some unfair reason, there's gonna be outrage.  We're just apes with nukes.
---
(Plus, there was much speculation and assertion that dupers were what was causing server instability, and people were out for blood after their umpteenth disconnect.)
---
I'm a BETA/day one player who must have ammased hundreds of hours into this game. Prior to duplication I hit level 200 and had completed near abouts all the content the game had to offer (Queens, Whitesprings etc.) When the first duplication glitched surfaced naturally I was curious and ill be honest I did duplicate items. At the time the only thing that really interested me was engaging in trades on the Discords, seeing that the game didn't really have much else to offer. Before TSE weapons ciculated, between me and a friend we had legitimately found 4 TSE weapons at Whitesprings, one in which was the original TSE combat shotgun which at this point has likely been duplicated thousands of times. I don't really have any excuses for participating in it hence why im now suspended, but when there was literally nothing new to do in the game I guess curiosity got the better of me. My point is I had over 200 levels of legitimate play up until the duping thing went mainstream. I enjoy playing the game and look forward to new content. Whilst I don't believe this has been handled the right way lessons will be learnt and I certainly won't be engaging in any exploits discovered in the future. 
---
Forgive my typos lol
---
adrenal is broken currently. you have nerd rage and bloody mess? they wouldn't account for all the missing damage, but still.
---
&gt;If we buy another adrenal serum and apply it on top of it will it fix it?  I don't want to try to remove it at random. (It would be nice to have a way to selectively remove mutations if you're ever making changes to them.) A hotfix would be preferred.
---
Lol what kind of soy boy are you that you came into someone else's argument to play school teacher? Go suck a dick elsewhere.
---
I half agree with you. I also dont give a shit if someone has a billion caps or bullets or the best gear in the game. It doesnt effect my game play what so ever. 
---
However there are people who it does effect. People who build up to trade and roleplay as traders can have their market completely screwed. They grind for gear and to make recipes and such to sell, then someone just dupes a million guns and wipes out honest players work. Which really has to suck. 
---
And if you play to pvp I can see that someone easily obtaining by the best armor and weapons with virtually no work is at a much better advantage than someone who has to grind for that stuff. 
---
On point two I really dont care much for any in game economy. We have a cap limit so it's already restricted as is. But the last point I can see really pissing that player base off. Which is why there should be clean pvp servers only (which I think they are doing)
---
And third I do believe that some people have said that characters having thousands and thousands of gear and stuff was effecting the server stability, which sucks for everyone. 
---
Other than that I agree with you. I dont care what people do as long as it doesnt effect how I play. 
---
I just bought so many mutations, fuck me.
---
I actually love fallout 4. It's not my favorite fallout game, for story, or as a role playing game, but it's a deeply enjoyable title I've put more than a thousand hours into.   
---
It's not the fallout experience of my childhood, and there are paths that they are taking the franchise down I dislike deeply, stripping down choices and depth in the RPG elements of what, at it's core, should always be an RPG franchise is a choice I won't ever "forgive" bethesda for.   
---
But what they made, warts and all, was worth playing, was worth playing a lot, in my eyes.   
---
Fallout 76 actually has the \_potential\_ to be nearly as good, in the same sense. It's not an RPG. At all. In any sense of the word worth mentioning.   
---
But it's a fun open world psudo survival world set in a fallout universe with breathtaking set design. I can spend many, many hours in this world enjoying it...Until I try to play any of the actual game mechanics. Then I run up against bug after bug after bug after bug. Crash after crash, poor decision after poor decision.   
---
It's frustrating. I know bethesda can do better, because they \_Have\_. 
---
I can confirm the replies you got so far are correct.  I’m doing as much of that as I can afford perk card wise with 200 condition marine armor and I’m at 475/405/100.  Also I only have 2 Vanguard pieces so far so eventually it should get better.  
---
Note that if you can’t find Vanguards or Bolstering right away you can also use Mutants.  It gives a straight +10 DR and ER I believe.  
---
Seriously. I just finished trading on discord finally getting some bloodied weapons and then they break it. I dont even have enough caps to rebuy my mutations. That's like 15k. I just spent it all. What the fuck. I'm not grinding another 4 days just to fix their fuckup

No doubt people are falsely suspended I did because I'm an idiot and accepted a trade for shit loads of nuka cola. And others with picking up players junk when there are stacks of bulked junk to throw away or not realizing the outcome of what they are doing.
---
Boom. Thanks for confirming 
---
Yep I noticed old one had 
---
sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX_Textures.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2
---
Not identical, but this is very similar to my first nuke of whitesprings experience. I explore- usually to the detriment of my level progress. I was around 14 when I came across the golf course and was exploring very carefully when a nuke was announced.  
---
I was toasted by the blast. Never thought to check the map to see where it would hit, just ran around in a panic at the announcement.  
---
Respawn nearby, go back over, and it is pure unadulterated chaos. Big clouds of orange and battles everywhere. I can't enter though, no protection. Someone drops a haz suit and a stack of grenades and gestures me over. tells me put it on and just spam grenades in to the crowds from the pool wall.  
---
So I do. Went from 14 to 27 that day and had an absolute blast. Got a ton of useless loot to scrap, and some legendaries that I had no idea what to do with. I shed a tear when I think of the two shot combat rifle I sold. I figured it was common enough to wait till I was closer to 50 and get another. Never seen another.
---
Is that what they said they are going to create?  I wonder how many servers they are running for this game and what the capacity is.
---
How about some (very rare) legendary mods, that work like the sacrificial blade mod and add an extra star to stuff. Maybe make them bind on pickup to keep them from being duped and sold on ebay.
---
Fair enough.  I did knowingly purchase one, and the other was given to me, but you are right, it supported an economy of duping.
---
What about the folks that purchased one and DIDN'T know that the weapon they purchased was duped?  I may be in the minority due to the amount of time I've spent in trade discords (it's a lot), but I'm sure some people got them just the same without knowing they were.
---
I would argue that the only difference is I knew, others didn't.  Also, I didn't pretend I didn't know.
---
Like I said, if I could turn back time, I wouldn't have bought them, but that probably sounds like a hollow apology no matter how you slice it.
---
He died I found his body somewhere don’t remember where but he’s there responder gear and everything 
---
I would rather see a Grafton monster week
---
&gt; Did you have Rad Worms prior to today's patch?
---
Is there ever a moment when any player does not have rad worms?
---
There wasn't  any other player I could see on the map,  they just kept respawning. When they came back for the third time I gave up. I'll see if it does again tomorrow.
---
I'm from WV too and I had never heard of a snallygaster, either. But, growing up, the Grafton monster was always called the Braxton County Monster. I've heard it both ways.
---
16 times the detail 
---
What an attention whore
---
Servers were buckling under the weight of their inventory. They caused the in game economy between players to go nuts. They also had an extremely unfair advantage in PvP when you could stack Bobbleheads.
---
do you have a picture of the adrenal effect? missing the bonus damage part?
---
because I was about to get some serums and would be reasonably pissed if it didn't work.
---
All those chains and spiky bits of metal would have a destructive unbalancing effect, as well as putting more strain on the drive motor. In the case of that particular mod, I can see how it would lower durability.
---
Liked and Like are not the same things! You have legit reasons to not like the game, but don't let it be a source of stress for yourself. Go play a game you still like. :) Maybe come back in 6months and see if f76 has it's shit figured out.
---
Then they could shoot your walls I guess
---
Oh ya? We should just give up the official sub to you fucking cheaters?
---
Get the fuck on, go find the next game to ruin.
---
/woooosh
---
My only sympathies towards dupers is in regards to the statistics of getting good items from enemies. When you kill some 3star enemy, theres 342,000 possibilities for what it drops. (The number is actually slightly higher) so the odds of you getting that one BA item your hunting are crap. Thank gawd for the dupers making all those nice fun items more accessible to get. In my 2 characters I've never gotten a 3star tse weapon. Never. I've got shit two shots, but no God roll items. Not yet at least. Thank you to those who made my in game time a little more fun
---
You could purchase the serum or for 24k caps buy the recipe.
---
Game developers *with subscriptions* include endgame content to keep people subscribed. FO76 is using an in-game store, which doesn't care what level you are or how long you have played.
---
It was a total of 645.654k bullets in 1 month with I think 333.071 being ultracite combined for both accounts. Even if there is a legit way to do that 645.654 is a very very odd number to come out with. 
---
Wonder why it is advertised, but not made like this...🤔
---
That's cool! Do they call it White Sulphuric Springs or White Sulphur Springs in the book? The latter is actually correct in real life. 
---
Can we get a C.A.M.P budget increase? Plus turrent budget reduction. I want to build big to show the wasteland, yeah i live here.
---
Here what iam not understanding bethesda went thru and removed all duped items so if after that ppl should be able to go on reddit, discord  and any socail site and  buy as much as they want with the caps they have if ammo is considered rare then they should of removed that as well this seems to me its punishing traders more then duppers who lost their stuff
---
It is really sad. I thought the same thing when I saw the patch notes. Some people are unpleasant and attack other player's C.A.M.P. locations. This gives them more impetus to do so. 
---
Perhaps it is to get people herded in the direction of the PVP Wilderness Survival version that they are going to release. Most folks I know could care less about the PVP. Let's call it "In game marketing".
---
How about make this game fun? And less lifeless 
---
Sulphur in the book. Then talked about the Greenbrier. 
---
I've heard they buffed her a couple weeks ago, I'm not aware of a buff from the last patch, it wasn't in the patch notes.
---
Oh, no question there. It's a good option for people are on the fence, may want to just play the main campaign and some multiplayer with friends for a few weeks or had signed up for other reasons entirely and just wanted to check the game out.
---
I just think it's worth considering that the game is intended to be a sort of ongoing slow burn and might actually be a good fit for a casual or weekend gamer. Those people would be best advised to purchase it outright and enjoy it bit by bit without being held to a time limitation.
---
Either way, it's a good option to have at all in the first place and one of the things that Origin actually does right.
---
Why don't people just play with one character at a time?  Bethesda don't have to use their servers to store data for people who want to sell shit on ebay, as a lot of people are doing.  If they get caught - tough titties.
---
you're right. Stop playing this game now. Uninstall it. 
---
Then you also wont have to waste time posting in these reddits. 
---
You can buy most mutations for less than 500 caps.
---
I mean I only feel bad for the innocent player that fucked with the duped junk in player bags without noticing. I deserve mine because I traded and as a return got loads of nuka cola from a dude but I at least know what i did to get suspended. The idiots are people like "I would never dupe and i know dupers who are online now bla bla bla".
---
Its all about balance. Either you nerf full auto or make it super rare. Otherwise no other build is worth playing.
---
Another option is nukacrypt Web site, handy if you want to do the annoying way and gather decode as well.
---
That is not in 900 hours though if I am reading it right. It's supposedly in just 1 months time. 900 hours is his total played if I am correct. Not to mention the other 300+k of ammo he was also crafting at the same time. 
---
Meaning the fact that it happened? Or I’m lying? I have no reason to lie, I was trying to put into context the man’s question. I can see by the downvotes that people must think I’m lying. I mean, I’m not asking for anything so what’s the point in lying? Lolz.
---
I don't get the enjoyment of trying to force PvP. There is hunter hunted radio for those that want to enjoy PvP so why force it? Is it cause no one is interested in PvP. Trying to constantly force PvP on those who aren't interested seems a bit psychopathic to me.
---
 While  PvP is allowed in this game, it is not even close to a true PvP game. They badly messed up trying to create a game which is supposed to be about rebuilding and cooperating but also has PvP and destruction. They are coming out with PvP only survival mode. I am going to bet that very few will be on them after the initial few weeks of curiosity has passed. Atom shop stuff for the CAMP is what will fund the game 6-8 months from now and guess who pays for that, players who don't PvP
---
well, there goes that thought... and unless you know someone who makes them all, it's not exactly cheap to reacquire the serum. 
---
We're talking about the guy under the Charleston rail bridge correct? Grafton something? Nice work.
---
Actually,  "can't" is correct.  It is impossible to prove a negative.  There will always be the possibility of 'what if?'.  
---
At best he can explain or disprove specifics, but there will never be a way to prove you didn't do something.
---
Beth E. Sda. She's like the main developer.
---
Through all of this I keep thinking of World of Warcraft when it launched.  
---
Talk about crashes and bugs.  Even when you reached end game almost a year later (first rag kill) the tier gear wasn’t even finished.  For those few who had some it looked like they were wearing safety cones.
---
Before WoW blizzard had a very successful product rollout track record, but WoW had them trying something new for them.
---
Like you said there is a lot of potential in 76 and with some patience we might get to see some of those warts taken care of, and who knows maybe another 10 or more years of game play.
---
Sadly I don't. Once I drank the serum it disappeared.
---
Grow the fuck up
---
Yeah the crafting would be fine if they were normal bullets but any amount of ultracite ammo past like 3k imo are bullshit.
---
You never stop gaining new cards on level-up, only more SPECIAL points. If you don't have enough Luck to budget for Starched Genes, you can choose between picking a new card or moving a SPECIAL point, so just move a SPECIAL point to Luck if you need to. 
---
Touché. He deserves a ban if all that was on his character, or even if that much went through his inventory in 30 days.

I thought that the armour you're wearing gets unequiped while in PA?

I do it for the screws. I have an entire area dedicated to free access of tables and storage near Pleasant Valley Station. I'm friendly, but I also know that there's some value in restricting the extractor.

Even if u got a gun from someone that was dupped or bought something that was dupped u realize they will ban u

played a ton of dark souls series (way more hours than in the fallout series) and never even knew that was an issue,  ive known duping and cheating was an issue in 76 since beta though.  i also never traded with other players in dark souls, i dont know if theres even much of a souls economy.
---
Could have been server lag or bad luck, I just cooked 200 glowing meat steaks and ended up with a bit over 500 
---
Alright. Thank you
---
Re-acquire it? Are you kidding? I have like 13 mutations, if I'm lucky Adrenal is the first that gets removed when I run through a decon arch but there's still the issue of getting it again. It's random unless you plop down 4000 caps, in case you didn't know.
---
And no, we should not rely on trading to get stuff back just because Bethesda screwed something up.
---
wait, you're saying the mutation didn't even register? like, you drank the serum, the positive/suppression effects registered, but you weren't given the adrenal mutation itself?
---
did you get rid of it first? before drinking the serum?
---
the process of duping included crashing the server. You need no other reason to despise these scum.
---
Probably a Monty Python in-joke.   
---
"You tit, it's just a bunny!"

Well said

&gt;You run a wire to the switchbox looking thingy on the back to make the keypad work. Then run a wire with a switch on it (or pressure plate,) to the door (I target the door's keypad) to make the door openable from the inside using the switch and/or pressure plate. It's not obvious at all but that makes the door two-way.
---
I got a drill today after the patch. I thought I must have picked it up (not likely), but this makes more sense. I actually think I got it as a quest item reward.

&gt;Valseek [Bethesda - Community Manager[]
---
&gt;Update on this following some initial investigation:
---
&gt;If you had acquired this mutation prior to today's patch, it will not apply its positive effects correctly. If you re-acquire the mutation now that the patch is out, it should work as intended.
---
&gt;Also, for those with Bloodied weapons that aren't applying their bonuses correctly, this should be corrected after you unequip/re-equip that weapon.
---
Dont know how anyone could be excited with such underwhelming patch.  Pretty much nothing new, very small adjustments that should be in game since release. Anyways its nice to ser people that get easily excited like this, you should try ET for Atari, kinda same quality as Fallout 76.
---
I'll give that a shot later on when I get home from work - thanks!
---
I bought a few. I couldn't really tell either tbh
---
Just to add some further information:
---
When the frame rate starts dropping, it does it at 9 second intervals.  I time it with the stopwatch on my phone at the start of each dip and its near as damn it 9 seconds on the dot each time.
---
I have recorded the FPS counter of my monitor and RivaTuner's FPS counter and you can see how it drops the frames at regular 9 second intervals.  Also notice how I am not moving so there is nothing to redraw so to speak.
---
http://streamable.com/wnh1r
---
It also seems that if I ALT-TAB out of the game and then go back into the game, it stops doing it periodically and then starts again.
---
Very strange
---
Maybe it was better that way for me so that I don’t feel any loss. 
---
Naming the frame they sit on would be nice. For ease I swap entire setups. If both are in the box- do I want *power armor frame* or *power armor frame*?
---

I'm a melee character with a Gatling backup weapon for SB's that won't land..   
---
So only use 5mm, and give .556 to my second account to use, so have Gobs and gobs of other ammo stockpiled.
---
Even with using .556 on a mule, and 5mm myself, I give away thousands of rounds every couple days (gave over 3,000 rounds combined of the two) to random people as I play.  
---
I think you forgot to account for the fact that Gunpowder is crafted in batches of 15, which with Super Duper gives you 19.5 on average over a large number of crafts.

Suggestion: Find a group willing to do "Mayor for a Day" at Watoga and get yourself an All Rise, then try out (arguably) the best casual Melee weapon in the game. I was all about rifles then got All Rise now I'm Mixed Melee/Heavy Guns and can contribute on Scorchbeast Queen runs.

The fact that the SBQ now gives off radiation  has made low health bloodied builds useless

I thought that was supposed to be on this update..?
---
Damn, I don't even have a set of armor because PA became so necessary, but you're right, 200 lbs will take me well below encumbered level outside of PA.  I need to go get me some shiny new armor!

Have you checked your video settings in the game? What about the settings in the NVIDIA GeForce Experience app? I've found that to sometimes try to override stuff.
---
Math is off completely on the fluxes, but otherwise fairly sound

And failing that, if I was trapped in a world without clean underwear I might burn a few ballistic fiber just to craft *clean* bulletproof undies.

Maybe that’s your problem. You play too much and you’re bored. Move on mate. I have well over 20 hours. I’m level 31. It’s not like I’m *brand new* I don’t see what that has to do wit anything anyways. Is the game *magically* going to become broken when I play over a certain amount of time? No. Why? Because that doesn’t make sense, much like your argument. Again, *your* problem is that you’re a loser and have pumped 900 hours into this game in such a short amount of time and you’ve become bored with it. Bro... my Skyrim characters don’t even have 900 hours and I’ve been playing that game since it came out. Put the controller down and step outside. Breath in some fresh air and calm down. Gooose Fabra or however it goes. You fucking nut case lol.
---
I meant to say quests. That's really meta. 
---
Wow that’s way more than the 30% chance it supposed to do 👍🏻
---
It was a fun meta game in my defense. Not against the rules either.
---
Alot of people are freaking out though because they think Its a ban when really I just account suspension.
---
Yeah. Not arguing. I don’t expect a god tier weapon every drop, but once in a blue moon would be nice. 
---
I was having issues since patch 4 with dpad left (xbox).
---
If I had a fist weapon equipped before I got in, it would obviously unequip it. However, switching between two different weapons while in PA would not remember the previous choice, it would swap back to one weapon, but trying two swap back again would tell me " you cant equip this in power armor", even though I just had it equipped.
---
Is Wheeling actually in the game or is that just a travel point you added? I haven't spent much time in the northern part of the map, but I've never seen anything really to do with Wheeling.
---
I'll honestly be pretty disappointed if they don't add Wheeling Downs and some of the old musical venues from there. Back in the old days, Wheeling was basically the last stop before Nashville when it came to country music. I mean, the Victoria theater complete with Elvis impersonation variety shows? The casino and dog track? They basically could make a little mini-New Vegas area right there in the North of state.
---
Those are two awesome games tho. 
---
Really have to plan ahead to use conduits at this point. I’ve settled for less than clean a few times now due to me not planning ahead for this glitch. The ceiling conduit wants to snap into the ceiling instead of the actual conduit as well. 
---
I was strolling in the Cranberry Bog before the servers went offline and was unpleasantly surprised when they came back. got swarmed by ghouls, a wendigo, scorched and a SB.
---
normally this wouldn't be a problem but they ripped me to shreds. went to check the problem and there it was, my damage was cut by almost half.
---
If a person plays longer, they will be more likely to spend atoms on newer atomic shop items.
---
Sure, a bigger effect is to capture the most number of players since more numbers will mean more people spending atoms.
---
But, again, the longer each player plays, the more likely the person is to spend atoms, on average, as new content comes out. 
---
Have you “examined” the item, “X” on the keyboard.  This is where they said the functionality would be.
---
are you on PC?
---
That guy is incorrect. If you interact with it It will make some noise and visual effects and briefly disappear.
---
You need to remove the mutation before you can apply the serum. Reading comprehension please. 
---
I like the idea, but the reason they limit it is to reduce server load tracking the database.  
---
They need a better way. I do not know what that might be. I had considered auto-bulking. Thus when you go past a certain number of an item, you get a bulk item instead. No need to track 1000 steel, just track 20 bulk steel 50 counts. Use one, still only 19+49 items instead of 999 to track.  
---
scaled across all accounts, this could cut the database significantly, allowing for larger storage.
---
haha who said that, I care about everyone i love you dont be mean to me ill just recluse hahaha :).
---
Take care man just a bit of fun dont be too serious :).
---
And put it on correctly.
---
most likely you owned a workshop or one of your teammates engaged
---
I believe each adds a new objective on the map to go mine.
---
I accidentally shot a guy trying to clear a room of ghouls and he killed me in one hit. He was level 35 I was 30. He one shorted me with a Chinese sword and I had full health. The guys health bar was *just barely* below half. 
---
That is not okay
---
Where every item has weight, and you need to eat and drink to survive?
---
PC Alt User here. I have 2 account and 2 PC's so I open one instance on each PC. But playing Windowed on a single PC is possible with severe performance penalties so second window must have graphics set WAY down.
---
I kind of thought so but thought i had a bad perk build.  
---
Heres  what iam not understanding bethesda went thru and removed all duped items so after that ppl should be able to go on reddit, discord  and any socail site and  buy as much as they want with the caps they have if ammo is considered rare then they should of removed that as well this seems to me its punishing traders more then duppers who lost their stuff the dupers that lost stacks on stacks of stuff still playing but a trader gets punished for a wieght limit when some stuff is crazy heavy  doesnt seem fair 
---
If I could I would but I'm on PS4
---
People keep debating me over it, but luck appears to effect it to a degree.  
---
Check this post out [Does higher luck increase the chance of the Super Duper perk triggering?]
---
(https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arzqlo/does_higher_luck_increase_the_chance_of_the_super/), outlined the data.
---
I think you’re better off scrapping for it. Combat rifles are common and plans are not really set in stone right now.
---
There are some undocumented mutations that have adverse effects on your urinary tract. I've already said too much. The less you know, the better.
---
There are no subscription fees and the DLC's are free. They have to pay for the servers and the content somehow, knucklehead.
---
No just read all the notes.
---
Nothing's mentioned regarding that.
---
He ment the PVP heavy game mode
---
A lot of us wants PVP. There's always "Hello Kitty Mode" (aka Adventure mode) for the crybabies like you that can't handle it.
---
I craft serums for donations.  I won’t be on until Thursday but if you can wait I’ll help you get all the mutations you need (on PC)
---
Well, one of the methods to dupe after a certain patch required to crash the server, after all.
---
Also, millions and millions of crafting materials on a server *does* have an impact.
---
No joke I would actually blow a few Atoms on this if it were offered in the shop.
---
Not 500 Atoms though. For one thing, I'm a fan of the Marine Wetsuit, and wearing underwear and a wetsuit is a mistake you only make **once**.
---
I'd like to know where you saw that not that i don't believe you lol, but I wanna make sure it's at least being worked on.
---
&gt; It's random unless you plop down 4000 caps
---
Mutation serums are commonly sold for 500 caps.
---
When parents put low effort into raising a child that is what you get unfortunately, a low effort troll
---
Makes me wonder if I'm next on the Banhammer List for my prodigious use of Alts and trading caps/chems/ammo. I'm nowhere near 900+ hours though.
---
I think you should make ammo way more heavy so the max you could carry reasonably would be about 500 rounds of 5.56 or 250 rounds of .308, which is more like real life carry, and then make the damage much more realistic.
---
If a sword was worth anything against a machine gun, the army would still issue swords... just sayin

I don't mind playing a melee, it's fine really, but guns are laughably weak.

Especially at the price.

Yeah my bad 
---
" there will never be a way to prove you didn't do something" Not true. There is always the possibility especially in this day and age with all kinds of recording devices and such. It saved my bacon not that long ago. I got banned on a game but ran across footage I forgot I was recording at the time. Proved That I did not do what I was said to have done and got reinstated. A troll actually changed his steam in-game name to my exact name in the same game I was in and started following me spamming his mic team killing teammates abusing role votes and kick votes and I got banned with only at the time my word it was not me doing it but I found my recording. It showed the troll doing all the things I got accused of and there was no doubt I did not do anything I got banned for. 
---
The 5mm ammo number doesn’t seem that high. I have lots of k’s most from supermutant elites. The rest of the numbers look suspicious. 
---
Your arguing exploitive intent (which can't be proven) with exploitive behavior.  Switching between the two during the arguement is causing confusion.  Clarification FTW.
---
Thank you! Hopefully someone who needs them can find them. :)
---
I’d pay for that.
---
Ah. So that was it- the workshop. I don’t even know what gun he had but even in power armor I didn’t even have time to find him before he took me down. And the jumped around in his creepy clown costume. I’m still learning how the game works. 
---
It seems to be pretty random for me.  I did notice this though. 
---
If I complete it say... yesterday, then today I don't seem to need it. However, if I get dumped from the server after the quest starts, or after I pick up one of the tapes and get dumped, then I will need it the following time.
---
 **Weapons:** The M79 Grenade  Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as heavy  weapons, and correctly benefit from all heavy weapons perks except Heavy  Gunner, as they benefit from Demolitions Expert instead. 
---
So... what exactly effects it then? hadn't they already benefited from demolitions expert?  You're calling them heavy weapons, but what perks do we have except heavy gunner? bear arms? whoop de-do. Very confused.
---
If I didn't make it clear in the description, the reason for posting is so other people can see it who are in different time zones as the previous post will be in amongst an awful lot of others-therefore hard to find
---
You have carnivore. That and herbivore have known bugs associated with them preventing you from gaining further mutations. One of these should be the final mutation one gets to complete their set for proper, bug-free experience.
---
Fuck is your issue, lmao? You came at me with the dickhead shit first. I’m sure you have better things to do so shoo
---
They are arguing exploitive intent.  Intent is something you can't prove so its an easy rally for people to use in an argument.
---
Exploitive behavior is provable (such as 100,000 nuka cola).
---
They really do need a better way to track items on stash, I'm not a programmer but I know other games can manage large stacks of items without issue so I'm sure there is a better way.  
---
im playing on PS4 and im not affected by this, just tested.  so its likely an isolated incident 
---
When they be grindin' up against you in the club
---
Can we please have the ability to name our "power armor chassis" it's so annoying having to go through my 6 sets to find the right one 
---
how the game works seems to change every month
---
You guys fixed the One Of Us bug! I thought my issue was rare and wouldn't be addressed. I'm so happy! 
---
Did you transfer the same ammo back/forth to the mule several times? I wonder if they're counting total acquired instead of current inventory.
---
I have seen them at the R&amp;G station down below Site Charlie.
---
the only thing that comes to mind is that tesla shotgun is still a rifle. so it still uses rifle perks even with the shotgun attachment.
---
Maybe you and your son can learn a valuable lesson from this.  
---
Don't cheat.
---
Reacquiring adrenal reaction is *not* a solution. It's not just a matter of obtaining another serum--in order to *use* the serum, we have to remove the original mutation, and there's no way to do that without risking all of our other mutations. 
---
Please reassure us that there's another fix planned for the immediate future. Asking us to put up with potentially having to reacquire multiple mutations because your patch introduced yet another bug is unacceptable.
---
I'm not sure I follow what your saying here.  But the dupe snap didn't remove ALL duped items, it removed all but a single copy.  I suppose this was their compromise to allow people who purchased or found a weapon of the targeted de-dupe to keep their toy.  This was also balanced out by the fact that the majority of the weapons were TSE (Two Shot Explosive) and received a nerf the week prior.
---
The effect on the market was two fold.  TSE was no longer the strongest weapon, and therefore no longer meta and prices for TSE plummeted.  Now that the market is leveling out (due to the stock on TSE being drastically reduced) and prices are coming back up to bring it inline with what it should have been all along.
---
Not sure I'm explaining it the best, but I took a stab at it.
---
i made a post similar to this one this morning.  now i wont be taking any workshops until survival mode beta is released.
---
Don’t know if there was a ‘silent upgrade’ of creatures’ AI and rewards, but it appears that the SBQ is harder to fight now. In the past it would stay still on the ground for quite a while and that was the best opportunity to chip her health away. Just did one fight and a crowd of 15 failed miserably. The queen barely landed and when she did, she moved around aggressively and attacked then took off again. There was hardly a moment when you can just walk over and pound her with your axe and hammers like in the past. 
---
And after the battle was over I stayed around the fissure sites to collect some flux, a level 80 scorchbeast came to attack me. I killed it with my Gatling and when I went to collect the loot I was expecting another piece of leather armor. Nope it was actually two prime schematics, one for Gatling the other for handmade. This has never happened to me in the past. It was always armor and occasionally a weapon but no prime plan drops from ordinary SB whether it’s 50 or 80. If this is part of the latest update, a job well done! 👍🏻👍🏻
---
What a crybaby. 
---
Looking to the Future, eh? Nice, let's look to the bright future of Fallout 76. I can see it coming:)
---
Yes, but the people who play longer are also more likely to have acquired those atoms through gameplay rather than paying cash, as a new player would have to in order to get them quickly.
---
Hi, kmixups, do you still play? 
---
I want to buy this dress... 
---
Actually most players claim them for the resources and don't really want PvP because of it.
---
adrenal being broken is a huge deal, man. I can't even play the game.
---
 Huh? Its a Lamp Stand for my house. ;)
---
This will just encourage people to have Mule Characters... if they do this, the transfer stash should have a 50-100lbs limit. So you can transfer a weapon or a bunch of ammo, but not a ton of stuff too easily.
---
Yeah I don’t see another post from ya buddy...damn coward 
---
You act as if end game players and newer players is a choice that Bethesda has to make. It is not.
---
Looking at you heart of the swamp. I can cleave off 10% of its hp then it magically gains 9% back
---
PS4 Pro,
---
Manta Man outfit has the same problem that patch 1.10 fixed for the Silver Shroud's, underarmor is visible while wearing the outfit. I can see my operative underarmor sticking out.
---
That is correct. It didn't register at all. I did not get rid of it first, just re-applied it with a serum.
---
Super Mutants be like "Huh , what is it ? What is that smell"
---
yeah but still unless they put lootboxes or p2w items i am ok with the shop.   
---
And as long as i remember, Fo76 was advertised as a pay once thing (no paying expansions/DLC).
---
Yeah, I've had this happen many times. Not sure what causes it.
---
Thanks to the mothman season, I fought my first ever mothman but thanks to this bug, the corpse just disappeared and I got nothing from it.
---

---
Had this same exact bug a while ago. It didn’t come back and it’s been two weeks, but it was awful. The turret targeted me but was unable to damage me. This was after an animal had attacked me, and I may have used an explosive weapon that may have confused the target and replaced me with it. This is just my theory as to why this happened, but it began to target my items too. If only it was given a bounty...
---
I'm a misanthrope so I can't identify. I play mostly to blow stuff up.
---
it never gets old- at least for me. always looking for new, more efficient ways to kill stuff.
---
What makes you think it is only shills who know the glories of wooden armor?
---
Waaah waaaaah I cheated and got caught. Oh no. Better go to Reddit and cry like a little baby. I'll get some sympathy this way! Waaaah waaaah.
---
They cheated, they got caught, now they're making up stories to try to get the community on their side. That's exactly what is happening. See it all the time with the first major ban wave for new online games.
---
I've gotta disagree there, sir. How many people (who just dealt with the issues) have quit playing for 100% lack of content. Does Bethesda not believe in multi-tasking?! One team on fixing stuff, one team on adding stuff!
---
Creating a bank character is exploitive intent and exploitive behavior there is nothing to prove and I'm not switching during the argument, wtf are you on about?
---
First time i can play this game on ultra without lagging. Good job Bethesda!
---
You should add the ability to have perk build presets that are easily swappable to the quality of life list. Swapping out individual cards every time I want to repair, loot build or join a team is getting to be a real pain.
---
This made my day. Thank you, thank you, thank you!
---
I read somewhere right after the game came back online that *super* stimbacks were broken. nothing about regular ones, though.
---
Exactly you’re level 31, that’s nothing, you’ve barely even started the game. And yes you’ll be playing the game like I was yesterday and then the next day you’ll login and a third of your damage will be gone due to a bug(adrenal reaction not working).
---
As far as comparing my social life to some kid on reddit, I’m good, don’t want to embarrass you kiddo. I’m in college though, last semester and all the classes I have left are a breeze, I put in a majority of my time over winter break. And considering I’m a computer science major with a concentration in game design, I think playing video games isn’t exactly a complete waste of my time as it will be netting me 100k+ a year soon.
---
video was awful, dude hasnt played the game but had to drag out the video for 10minute to get that extra revenue from youtube.  worst type of content uploader
---
Well if it was nice, it wouldn't become shit, it would just not become rare. It doesnt underperform when theres more of them lol. Theres tons of pipe guns and they suck if theres 1 or 1000. Tse weapons before nerf were OP, still OP if theres 1 or 1000. Just not rare
---
I have 1 with quad ammo capacity and i made it automatic. Great for mobs, especially SBQ mobs to make sure you tag as much as possible. Does great with scorched and ghouls, not so much with super mutants.
---
Again that’s with 5 nukes a day on the queen, if you nuke whitesprings you can gather at least 2x that amount of flux.. Again people need to think about the role playing mechanics of this game a little better imo.. we were supposed to rebuild Appalachia and some people took that to heart and wanted to have a profession.. some people are traders, crafters, raiders, farmers, paladins.
---
Iam wondering why ppl getting banned or suspended for hitting basicly a trade weight when they supposely removed duped stuff from game all that they wanted too   but ppl being banned for to much ammo nuka grape etc if they didnt remove it with other items how could you get banned for having rare items 2 days latter it doesnt make sense if you fixed it to help economy  then ppl should be able to buy and trade regardless of wieght
---
No, but they have to prioritize which content to focus on. They're focusing on content to attract new people and give people a chance to enjoy the game for ~60 hours rather than focusing on content that is only relevant to people who have played for hundreds. 
---
It's always a balancing act for any online game but ones with subscription models at least have an incentive to put in effort on end game content. I'm not saying they shouldn't make end game content. I'm just trying to explain why it's not high up on their priorities.
---
So you knowingly took loot that was obviously duped and got banned.. and now on Reddit bitching about it. Makes me smile. Enjoy the ban, hope you learned your lesson. 
---
*Logs on FO76 because I'm not a moron, sighs contentedly as I play*
---
&gt;Manually decrypting the codes can't be done by laymen.
---
You can do it with a pencil and paper...
---
Thanks a lot, but i can't stay away from my +200 carry weight :P
---
&gt; For one, there seems to be a huge discrepancy between whether these reported ammo numbers are how much was held at any given time, versus 'acquired' in a given time period, which could be cumulative if there was any muling involved.
---
&gt; The muling aspect is also important here, because it is entirely possible that all of this crafted ultracite was the guy's total collection throughout his entire playtime, which while an insane amount, is still feasible over several hundred hours if it is your primary focus. If all of that was slowly transferred to a mule while it stacked up and was then transferred multiple times back and forth in bulk over a shorter time period, it could easily trigger such a flag.
---
This is where my concern lies as well. First off, it's pretty clear from the phrasing of the emails that the bans were not issued for **holding** that many items at once, simply for acquiring that many over a 30 day period. Now that is actually *smart* on Bethesda's part, since very few dupers are going to actually carry 100k+ units of anything at once, not when the weight exploits have been done away with.
---
The part that concerns me is how they track "acquisition". We already know that weapons are not granted unique IDs that they can track, so it's almost certain that ammo won't have unique IDs either. If that's true, then theoretically the same stack of ammo could cross your inventory a few times and there'd be no easy way to tell that it was the same ammo or different ammo. There's probably a way to logically figure that out, but has Bethesda done that? Does their detection account for complications like transferring between mules or containers? Are they only counting specific kinds of item transfers and pickups? Are they only counting crafting output?
---
We don't know. That's the answer to all of those questions. The only thing we can say is that depending on the answers to some of those questions, high volume players could be falsely identified as having acquired duplicate items. Not a guarantee, but not unlikely either.
---
Also....
---
&gt; As for the rest of the ammo, given my slow play style I still regularly gave away or dropped thousands or rounds of multiple ammo types simply because I always loot EVERYTHING. The conventional ammo amounts seem perfectly reasonable to me for someone who just hoards everything they can.
---
Can confirm. I've dumped probably 10k Fusion Cells total in various locations, and I both don't play that often *and* don't try to pick up Fusion Cells (since I have no use for them). Specific, rare ammo types are a different matter of course -- I think I've found maybe 200 Flamer Fuel total, ever -- but I could see a die-hard player with a touch of OCD accumulating 100k 5mm rounds they have no use for in the span of a month.
---
With 900 hours you can probably get an ungodly amount of work done. With a lack of plentiful endgame all you can really do is grind for SBQ, kill SBQ repeat. Maybe Whitesprings but not everyone likes to do it. I can see it being legit but it’s a stretch.
---
survival mode beta releases sometime in march, thats about all know
---
I did some calculation, so this guys been crafting 5 memes in 1 day, thats 1 meme ever 400 hours or 3 memes every 28.3 minutes  
---
Assuming the MS paint load times of 5.4 seconds and the average upload speed of who fucking knows.  
---
He would have to watch 15 "you laugh you lose meme compilations" to be dank enough to create this number of memes in a given time.  
---
[Possibility Graph](http://e.lvme.me/7ecb4qp.jpg)
---
R, R. Take it all before you count what's in it. Other people might get it otherwise!
---
Nothing wrong with blowing stuff up lol
---
Yes I know.  This is why I haven't played since last patch.  My sneaky sniper got wrecked by this problem.
---
This ban has nothing to do with the duped items that were removed.  It's more like a secondary followup where they started looking thought the database transaction history to see who has been moving abnormally large amounts of select items.
---
Right lol
---
* bloodied damage output nerfed a bit
---
* super stimpacks not really working the way the should
---
* no one praising the 200 lb stash increase (because they like to complain instead)
---
Can you please hotfix adrenal reaction like right now? It’s really messing up my bloodied build. 
---
Two guys (lvl 220 and 48) tried to take Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm from me. The lvl 220 guy kept killing me (lvl 148 at time) with a TSE gun. I killed the lvl 48 guy a couple of times. After about 15 minutes of back and forth (I was out of caps), the lvl 220 guy gives me a heart emote and a thumbs up. Then they moved on Wanted. I couldn't reclaim the workshop, but I wasn't going to give them the satisfaction. I would have contested it until I was punching them. 
---
**This just makes it easier for the attacker, not the defender.** 
---
Fireproof perk reduces explosive and energy damage combined. It's ~~a fantastic~~ an awful perk. Terrible! Sure doesn't need nerfing.
---
I once ran across a duper transferring items. Of course, I killed him. In a container nearby was 5k+ Dog Food, 10k+ Nuka Cola, etc etc. Know what I did? Left it. Know why? Because I actually have a brain and I know what gets people banned and I have some fucking common sense. LOL!
---
Except if you read it you would know I didn't get banned.
---
You don't have this game so you don't understand. You don't craft in THAT high a volume. 
---
For example, I can whip up like 140 shotgun shells before Im totally out of materials for it. Then I can make, like, 300 or so other bullets. That's with the materials gathered over a few days. 
---
If someone is making 100,000 of the rarest ammo in the game... then something is up 
---
I myself tend to be pretty anti social, but fallout let's me also avoid people, but still be in the world and mess around in a fallout themed playground with my wife. 
---
Amazing. Time to move perks around now 😃
---
Its pretty cool to have a game that allows so many different ways for people to play it. 
---
That sucks. [According to this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asat8r/fallout_76_patch_notes_february_19_2019/egu11bn?utm_source=reddit-android) you can get it to work if you get the mutation post patch. Dont know if using a serum with you already having the mutation will work or not...
---
There wasn't
---
Wasn't referring to you, idiot. Referring to 90% of the Redditors in this sub. And the fact that you're defending them makes you very suspect indeed.
---
Supply and demand. You think when 25% of fo76 needs between 1-9 new mutations the price is going to stay at 500? Even so, I already paid 15k caps for the ones I have a long time ago. Why should I have to do it again?
---
Gotta get those sweet crybaby $$$
---
I don’t think it’s a few hundred people getting bored of fallout man... there is a general need for new content 
---
it was still in the previous server that u were in
---
IDK if this has already been reported but, today i tried to fight the scorched queen and her health got stuck and never went down.
---
Mkay, well you can check my comment history and see that as recent as last night I was trading on r/Market76
---
Cheers neighbor! I agree - of all the places I've camped the Mire is the nicest, and honestly, the quietest.
---
What if they never fix it? That's how I read it anyway. 
---
Rule #1: Never talk about the Reddit Xbox club. 
---
Funny, the gun nerfs just keep on coming. The awesome Armored Gatling got nerfed because they desyncronized the Martial Artist perk for faster firing speed. It's like they don't want anyone to use a gun unless they're running around at 20% health
---
I was reading this and thinking, "damn, that's not me, I don't use mo-- wait I wanted text chat in game. Crap."
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Just had that issue- had to quit and log back in- worked after that
---
Are US based players allowed to trade there? 😉
---
Anything that gives stagger chance will break the sentinel armor perk. Enforcer in the agility tree is good as well.
---
Of course! Everyone is welcomed 
---
Is it good yet?
---
Depending on how many mutations you have I’d suggest buying from a crafter, they usually go for 250 a piece which is pretty cheap
---
some guy said it doesn't. I'm about to bite the bullet and start over. better than waiting for a fix, I guess...
---
my build quite literally does not function without it. fuck.
---
I e joy his vids, it pisses me off this game was discounted in the US and given away basically in other countries when I paid full price. Its insulting. Love fallout greatly, this one needs work massively tho. Just disappointing 
---
&gt;I approached a relay tower killed 4 super mutants and before I walked to the tower they responded, took about 20 seconds.
---
This happens if you kill them initially from outside the “area”.  I do it all the time at the relay tower just west of flat wood.  Kill the enemy’s with a hunting rifle, then walk closer and everything respawns cause I just entered the area.  
---
They've already issued at least one apology after a review initated via telephone. It's great that they admitted their error, but that's proof that they fucked up with their scripted ban.
---
Did you drop it or place it? If you dropped it your out of luck. If you placed it and it didn’t return to your inventory I would submit a ticket.
---
Well he can go no life and cheat in another game.
---
boi bye
---
yes, agreed 100%, but does it actually work?
---
Dudes! Bethesda! I wanted to thank you a lot! Thanks to how horrible you people handled f76, I now get to buy an Xbox one x for next to nothing! Who usually it’s close between 5-6k but the f76 version is on sale for 2k now! In usd that’s around 150! So thanks! 
---
Ok I see the server issues. I don't care too much about the pvp 
---
Melee will almost always win anyways 
---
I really only use edible buffs so idc too much about the bobbleheads considering I can stack deathclaw steak and glowing steak and have a big melee buff anyways
---
so you can buy it for 2000 caps in the atom shop, duh
---
Cool.  Sometimes I’m up really early US time and it will be nice to see an active trading sub when I get up.  
---
229 hours :P More than I expected, tbh.
---
Depends.  .50 is 180 rounds base with weaponsmith.  Throw in Super Duper and you are in the same ballpark as 5mm, so you won't be able to use this for a detractor.
---
I mean, I'd be down for a sub for just Xbox. It would just be another marketplace though, and people already post the same thing in both the major trade subreddits.
---
Source? Did they realize what in their script screwed up? There one thing over and over I noticed was that the people that seemed less likely to be cheating, were also the people that played more than your average player.
---
Here's an easier solution: put the fucking vendors on a global reset timer like The Division, Destiny, and pretty much every other god damned online game created in the last 5 years. If you know everything resets at 12am EST there's no more guessing and no need to change the maps.
---
That makes sense. I never even bothered looking up how to dupe something because I never desired it. Thanks!
---
Melee is good for raw damage but if you us Assassin’s fear and Blocker Perk card at rank 3 you get a massive damage reduction to melee before it ever gets applied to your DR.
---
Well hopefully people will be on. It's in its early days still, so please don't expect vast amounts of people but in time hopefully there will be
---
It depends a lot on your build in my opinion. I’m not all that knowledgable in builds, having only done one build which is (level 77)stealth sniping, and with a team of 3 of myself, I could maybe beat the SBQ. I have a level 270 friend who can solo the SBQ. He uses power armor and heavy weapons. Other people often join in, and my first fight with the SBQ with others was actually in the level 20’s. With good teammates, you could definitely do it. 
---
it's kinda cozy, isn't it? I get the same feeling at times. that I can identify with.
---
we broke it all down briefly on the top comments. Check it out.
---
Let me guess, you got banned? 
---
Oh, holy shit, that looks painful.
---
I am savoring this metaphor. It paints such a delightful picture of what went on with this game.
---
Pre patch 5 I saw deep pocket leather torso and limbs at grafton city once each out of 26 server hops.
---
Im on xbox and learned both of them. Id mod them for you, but I Havent installed the patch yet.
---
I would be so fucking happy if I could get Legendary Scout. It's my favourite set, and I keep a fully kitted one. I hope one day we get to play with legendary modifiers and apply them to our own gear.
---
Silent nerf bloody? nice one beth..
---
Oh you’re a college kid. That explains the entitlement issues. And btw “college kid” that’s cute. I’m 21, I’m a home owner (owner no loan. *own*) I own my vehicle. I have a child on the way and I live with my wife. Congrats on being in college working for a degree that is most likely already over saturated. *weird flex but okay* Havw fun being unemployed. I spent $24,000 in trade school, finished when I was 20 and am now an airplane mechanic. How’s your homework going? Fucking loser lol. Imagine if past generations still lived with their parents well into their 20’s to do 4 more years of high school. 
---
Colleges are an outdated teaching method. You fell for a scam, enjoy the debt as well as no job. 
---
Now, back to fallout since you decided to brag about being a whiny college kid, level 31 is far from “just starting out” Sorry that not all of us have part time jobs and can sit and play video games for 900 hours in 4 or 5 months. Again, that’s your problem. You play too much. You’ve become bored with it. You’re other problem, which you brought to light on your own is that you’re a whiny entitled college kid who brags about falling for a scam. Congrats guy.
---
Completely understand.  Just subbed.  Good luck man. 
---
Why do I wanna celebrate shop stuff &gt;:c
---
I got Ultacite armor plans... they forgot to remove them from the loot list apparently since you get the entire set at the BoS base after the last patch.
---
Ooh for sure. My full rifleman, tank killer and armor mag hunting rifle doesn't one shot ghouls even if it's a head shot, but my fire ax does with ABSOLUTELY no perks. Now granted it's a legendary with some awesome mods and I'm lucky to have gotten it but it makes all of my other weapons worthless, only my TSE Handmade made me feel like I was actually a lvl 125 with some time invested
---
He actually bought it at full price and started playing b/c of all the content he's made bashing it.
---
Still finding those missing texture patches on rocks, btw....
---
The question is whether his character actually holds that amount of ammunition, i.e. 140k rounds.  Or if the counter that Bethesda uses only tracks ammo 'acquired', i.e. picked up/traded, not taking into account OUTGOING ammo other than through a gun.
---
Only Bethesda can clear it up by showing the actual ammo counts from his inventory.  Their email isn't clear enough to stipulate his character currently has 140k ultracite ammo on their person/stash.
---
His claim that he has never held over 36k ammo of any type is quite specific and he is not disputing having a LOT of ammo, just not having the total count as per their numbers. 
---
36k vs 140k... that is the question and again, only Bethesda can show the real numbers of stacked ammo.
---
This is my big question. 
---
I’m perfectly willing to spend some caps to correct my character, but damn I just wanna know if it even works first. 
---
Pain train does 0 damage effectively.  This is a bad idea. 
---
Thanks a lot I really appreciate it :)
---
Source? Personal knowledge. :) They didn't explain the reason for the error--just apologized and reinstated access.
---
lol so true indeed!
---
Bloodied high rad melee? Thats what I am, probably would be so much better with a (working) adrenal reaction
---
I'd like to know this too actually. I'll give it a try and update to see if it worked
---
I use Barbarian , iron clad, evasive on my melee build. Along with the scaly skin mutation. 
---
After that its all about the armor dr. 
---
BoS heavy combat is the best but gl finding plans. For now i use polymer. Then of course add in dr for the legendary perks.
---
aww man I am just about to hit 49, I can almost taste 50. I can't wait to do some cool shit like that. I'm on ps4 too if you want to slay shit some time. 
---
Lets say poof all dupe items removed what they considered rare so  900 hour guy buys and trades for all that ammo why should he be banned bethesda said they removing stacks of rare stuff only effects 1 % if they didnt take stacks of ammo and 900 hour guy buys it why should he be punished when they didnt target it then only when he bought it was it a target 
---
i've been dealing with this for weeks.  ill check it out.  thanks.
---
It's also populated with Bethesda zealots. So many are screaming "but they're lieing, they're evil dupers, fuck them bethesda doesn't make mistakes.
---
Seriously, I've never seen a sub so bloody divided and indecisive. Half loath the game, half dry hump the box, and most in between flip flop back and forth between the two every update. And the amount of sheer disrespect each side shows the other is a disgrace.
---
So here's an idea, as insane as it may sound. Show each other some respect. Have balanced discussions. And most importantly, stop lunging at each others  jugulars every time they think something different to you. You're all so damn sure that everyone on the other side is a filthy lieing scumbag or blinded moron. 
---
I agree, I stopped preordering and buying games on release ever since no mans sky. It's the worst feeling ever to spend 60$ and not get your return.
---
It’s like a party in my mouth but everybody’s throwing up!
---
I can make the serum on PS4.  Won't be online for another hour though.
---
Doubtful they did, a company wouldn't do that without a press release anyway. And if it was it was some customer service rep who thinks their job is to take the heat. Good luck getting anyone higher up then that on the phone anyway lol
---
This! 
---
Hahahaha, we had that one stickied thread up for months that it amassed over 12k posts and they kept it up instead of updating. Lazy and not helpful at all.
---
And now they add this? And have it stickied too? 
---
Makes no sense what they deem important and not important. 
---
I want to know what the heck the point of "extra damage to workshop items" perk was for if it wasn't to destroy barricaded workshops?  Seems pretty simple to me.  The in-game mechanic was there.  
---
An exclusion zone around the workshop workbench would have been fine too.  They could have made it so that each teammate had to challenge the workshop in order for the team to be part of the PvP instead of allowing 1 team mate to initiate it and the other 3 teammates to camp-kill the workshop holder.  
---
They could have made it so that trying to take a workshop brings up a vote that the team must agree to.  When the vote passes, the team challenging is forceabley transported to the workshop being challenged.  (That last one isn't ideal by any means, but it does prevent the situation where someone challenges a workshop and the team insta-kills the holder.
---
Besides, as a pacifist player, I want the option to just give-up the workshop to the challenger.  Let me choose whether or not the workshop is worth defending.  
---
Heck, make the workbench "movable" so that people can put it in unsuspecting locations (at ground level only, no jumping allowed while moving JUST the main workshop workbench.  Make the challenger look around for the damn thing first.   Make it so that when moving it, the workbench doesn't actually move until it is successfully placed in a different location.  That way it must exist in a valid location at all times.
---
Basically they took the worst way they could come up with to try and fix the perceived problem instead of looking at the game as a whole....again.
---
You liked the shaky screen spam? It was annoying not challenging lol.
---
This bug has been happening to me for well over a month.
---
lol i will let you know. im looking for a good serum crafter, a buddy of mine actually would do it for 200 per serum, but he is at work and I am very anxious to fix this is my build highly depends on it.
---
increased stash is nice, but I really need increased Camp budget :(
---
Probably more than your average player because they were playing it like a job and making money off of dupes
---
Ha, I know they know about it, saw bethesda reply to one of those posts like 2 months ago.
---
If it wasnt for this new broken texture, I would still believe its an easter egg related to the terminal entry about it all being a simulation
---
Hey buddy, what's your price for the serums
---
They apologized on an individual basis after reviewing the data and restored access to one account.
---
I don't have the data to read all the comments - hut has Bethesda acknowledged the stealth glitch  from last month yet?
---
My experience on PS4 was actually pretty positive from the beta onwards, with the first few updates creating crashes that I didn't have from the beta until that point. By 30 days after full release I had no more than a crash every few days, an update or two after that not a single crash in a week and only one server crash.
---
That compared to my experience with anthem for example.. that game was as broken for me as PC players described fallout was for them.
---
That's the point, I've talked to plenty of people on console on Reddit and in game that never had more than the occasional crash, while PC players complained from day one and only more recent seemed more or less fine.
---
I don't know about the latest update because I have no interest until New content comes out- I'm simply telling people who are on the fence that with new content coming soon, now may be there time to try for themselves rather than having others define what time game is to them.
---
So far nothing new , some bugs got squashed and as for some mutations being broken ( I never had them so I can’t report )
---
That is my favorite too. I would love to use it with the BoS fatigue underarmor. I have a complete set with ultra-light mods on it. It looks nice.
---
Without legendary effects, it under powered compared to Combat Armor.
---
Source or no?
---
No.   Usually though.
---
This is satire, for those that don't get it. GG OP!
---
You can craft atom shop apparel purchases at you armor workbench at any time.
---
Players were burying workshops with camp items causing other player to damage the camp items or pick locks to get past an actually accessing the workshop.
---
This cause players to flag for bounties.
---
They corrected the issue.
---
Oh that's cool I didn't even know that! See this is why I still really like this game. There's tons of builds with tons of different benefits!
---
Knowingly? Lol dude I didn't even know tse was a thing till January.  Ddnt know bout the xp glitches.  Literally just started reddit this last month so I have had exposure to most the game. I play with my brother and I grabbed items from a baggy. No need for you to be a prick. Unless you do in fact have some suppressed need to be a prick in order to get off on your self righteousness. I was there getting 1 shot with my 1 star meathook fighting for ammunition shop. Ppl would jump high as hell and shoot the ground I had no idea wtf o thought they legit cheated. Fast forward months later, I get reddit and read read read and I see now it was tse, and marsupial. Saw ppl a lvl 200 n shit I was lvl 34. Played beta thru release. Was baffled for months. You can expect everyone just knows shit. I had the items for less than 30 seconds cuz I couldn't move at all. 
---
Thank you for finally giving me a reason to use the stealth boy I've been carrying around this whole time.
---
some good stuff, but man am I itching for a Camp budget increase. 
---
Agreed. That spam was terrible I’d be happy as hell if it would just not spam and land a bit more but beyond that it was alright. That sounds as if they nerfed it to much....ughhh
---
 It never bothered me much. Did nothing to my present char but he is almost immune to the explosives. I'd just shoot into the middle of it and get lots of hits. ;)
---
 Not being able to see the trash was a bit fucked but that's not my point. They have seriously nerfed her! 
---
Yeah the amount he had seemed like way to much but I had 400+ hours and only used 1 prime weapon 
---
With 800 pounds of stash size, you probably don’t need that extra carry weight anymore. Trust me, I have a ridiculous amount of junk and about 40 power armor chassis in my stash, it’s completely possible to find something with a little more style now!
---
&gt;the \~\~main\~\~ only developer.
---
I've been considering doing something similar, but killing the thing they are aiming at before they get a shot off instead...   (jk, but might be fun to do on April 1st while wearing a clown costume.)
---
 This is in no way satire. My game is hunting the fuckers and they have fucked it up a lot.
---
...make a poll? What?
---
Took about 25 seconds to get a downvote. Hello, reddit!
---
Great list.
---
One bug my team has seen repeatedly is team mates becoming randomly invisible to each other. This usually occures after a loading screen (entering an area or fast travelling). It's not consistent as to which team mate is invisible to which as some may be invisible to one team mate but in full view of the other two. Or they may be invisible to all three which gets very confusing It requires an exit to menu to fix it which is very annoying.
---
This is on PC.
---
Is this on the radar?
---
I hear ya. I initially started fo76 with the intention of being the Power Armor Farmer for my team and for a little while had as many as 14 separate suits in all different types and states of completion. Was such a hassle to set that many suits just to find which one needed the two or three pieces I had just picked up. Thankfully we are all above 50 now and are all decked out to the nines with our suits but I still carry three of my own for the same reasons. Being able to name each suit would have probably saved me about 30-40 hours of dropping-equipping-picking up suits to keep my team kept up on their armor. 
---
Most likely do it free if you have mats, if I have to front the mats what ever the going rate.  Thinks its 200 caps.
---
Thats good question,i got another account with nothing and it is so boring start again from zero,in banned account im lvl 120 i have farmed gear,traded weapons or gifts from other players but i dont have 100k of any item,i dont have 10k of any item. I played 3 hrs of a day and now is waste a time for me i have normal life with family and Fallout games is relax for me. At sunday morning i picked up paper bag with 100 flux maybe thats the problem. Im so sad and i dont have hope now 
---
You managed to prove someone else commited an act and you were mistakenly blamed for.  You did not prove that you did not also make that other account.  See what I mean?  There is always a 'what if' when it comes to proving a negative.  Having an alibi isn't proving a negative by the way.
---
these are some good suggestions, i appreciate u detailing them in hopes someone at BGS sees this.  its awful when someone iniates taking ur workshop and there team kills u, and they dont fully take the workshop so they can do it repeatedly.  If u could relinquish control of the workshop without server hopping that would fix this issue at least. 
---
You wrote a rage filled essay but all I read was "blah blah I'm a cheater and I got caught and now I'm crying blah blah"
---
I didn't run across a duper bud. And instantly rectified my actions. You wish t live in a full conformist world with no road to redemption? You are fucking insane and clearly very troubled inside. God bless your soul.

If you can get past the fucking blur.
---
 WTF There are two categories. Assholes who cheat, and the rest of us that don't. 
---
Could you guys remove the fanfare for serendipity as well. It fucks with a team since it shows up on everyone’s screen and it’s really annoying.
---
All I see is "mom didn't hug me enough and I still have no partner in life so I'll act out in public"
---
&gt; Did he seriously post that email himself? Why?
---
Read his post: the email says his main account "acquired" 140k ultracite ammo "within 30 days of gameplay." They don't say the account actually had that much in inventory at any point, and the player's post essentially said 'I've never held anywhere near that much ultracite ammo, but what I have done is move legit ammo from one account's characters to another account's characters, and back.' 
---
He seems to think BGS was basically tracking any time ultracite ammo was added to an account within a 30-day window. So under his theory, he crafts 20k ultracite on his main, but it's for a weapon he doesn't use and he transfers it to his secondary account for storage, that's 20k "acquired" by each account. Transfer it back to the main? Another 20k "acquired" by the main account. Etc. 
---
I have no idea if the OP in that thread is full of shit or not, but "acquired X within 30 days of game play" and "found to have exploited the following items" stuff in BGS's email is almost deliberately unclear. OP's theory that they have no way of telling whether I crafted 100k ultracite ammo or crafted 10k ultracite ammo then dropped and picked it back up 9 times...does fit with the vague wording of BGS's email.
---
Also, where are you people getting the idea that crafting masses of ultracite ammo is hard? I've crafted over 100k rounds of ultracite .50 in about 3 weeks, since I got a prime receiver blueprint for my bloodied explosive .50 cal. The very first day I crafted up 18k+ just from the stable violet I had on hand, and banged out another 6k or so the next day before running out of hardened mass. Farmed a few WS nukes exclusively for masses/high rad fluids, then hit the bog for violet flux with green thumb. Have just been pumping the stuff out tens of thousands of rounds per session ever since. Have 20k or so in inventory now, and usually burn 2-5k per night of gaming depending on how many SBQ kills I join. 
---
So I'm insane because I'm not stupid enough to pick up crap, and I'm not banned, and never will be. 
---
🤣😂🤣 cry harder loser. 
---
fair enough, when u online. message me 
---
Only if flap limbs makes me fly and dysentery means I can find my way back to where I started just by following the trail.
---
I know that feel. Both my ranged and melee characters are neutered atm. 
---
Sorry mate, I'm just not able to follow your logic.
---
I do on occassion find toxicity and baseless griefing for no other reason than to cause the other person mental anguish quite fun. It's got a lot to do with my horrible alcoholic mother and her death and a whole host of other issues.
---
On the flipside of that, if I find new players and they seem like they need help, I will help them as much as they want and give them my last stim pack if need be.
---
But when someone completely locks down a nuclear plant, I am 100% going to find a way in (They always miss something) and going to claim it, then scrap all their stuff.
---
Picking on noobs = no fun, Picking on people who can come destroy you as well = fun.
---
It adds an element of danger to the game, I like having the feeling of  there might be someone just watching me build my generators, lying in wait to strike. It adds an element to Fallout we've never had, unscripted human enemies. I honestly was hoping for more of an ark/rust level of needing to protect yourself, it adds urgency, builds unbreakable bonds among new players, creates oppurtunities for the ultimate betrayal, the more sandbox we have available the close we get to an actual "you shape the world game".
---
I still leave lots of gear at overseers, but if someone sits onfusion cores all day, I'm destroying everything in there.
---
They decided to further themselves at the expense of the community. The reason is irrelevant, let them rot in their banned exile imo. 
---
Hopefully they stay banned so they'll think twice if a similar situation presents itself in a future game they play.
---
You are insane for believing in no road to redemption. You are too stupid to understand what I said. 
---
I used an adrenal reaction serum, was told that I had gained the mutation (I did not remove any/it beforehand, only disabled starched genes) and while the serum was actively suppressing negative effects there was no positive effect.
---
What's odd is that I didn't remove Adrenal Reaction first. I already had the mutation and by drinking the serum it actually removed the mutation entirely...
---
I can try to remove all of my mutations and re-apply them in order to test this in a bit.
---
Before the patch, I managed to stealth kill a scorch beast in less than two minutes with a combat knife lol 
---
Aww, you're resorting to personal attacks now. Guess I win. 
---
Bye bye, hopefully your next ban is permanent. 
---
This [forum post](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323720/atomic-shop-update-legend-of-the-mothman-feb-19-2019) has a gif of it in action
---
This... It's a simple thing for Bethesda to clear up.
---
His claim of never having over 36k ammo seems to elude to the fact that their query/tracking only tracks INBOUND items, not OUTBOUND - probably assumes that outbound ammo is USED, not traded repeatedly.
---
I'm staying neutral till I see evidence from Bethesda showing he is either lying, or showing his claim is legit... wait and see... or maybe never...
---
Thanks.  I'd like to "nope" right out of the workshop ownership if someone else wants it.  They can have it.  Every time I've tried to take the ONE workshop I actually want, the game crashes.
---
Giving ranged a damage boost in perception like melee should balance it where the damage is at now is where it should be for PvE but for pvp it should be lowered.
---
That sounds fun. I found an Instigating Limb Damage Mole Miner Gauntlet about a week ago and have been ripping things apart with it.
---
and probably won't ever get to see a god roll. definitely not a full, matching sentinel set. if that's OK with you, great.
---
but I'm not OK with it. not one bit.
---
There are a lot more shades to the world than just black and white, my friend.
---
Not being snarky, just pointing out that most people don't realize the differece between intent and behavior.  Clarification as to what your basing your argument around would help to inform said people.  
---
As to the switching between your arguments basis on the two, I mistakenly seen anothers post and thought it was yours.  Apologies.
---
Whilst I share my butthurt emotions, you continue to cry out for attention that you were never given. I'm all ears for ya little troubled buddy. 
---
To add to that, they shouldn't make generators so gratifying to one shot with a pump for a spectacular explosion.
---
yea this change was just dumb, if it was specific to the new pvp only servers then fine. most people who take a workshop do it for recipes(rewards) or a free fast travel if they are gonna be on that server for a while. id say less then 10% of people who play the game use workshops for the actual resources, it is just faster to go loot locations for stuff you need.
---
I'm not the one going full blown psycho mode because someone called me out. 
---
Just saying. 
---
get an upvote. you deserve it for saying how it is.
---
I'm sure you do, as you clearly hate people you dnt know as a standard. 
---
They're still incredibly power, just not as much.
---
Wish you a good life bud.
---
Nope its a bug with adrenal mutation
---
Adrenal Reaction is busted.
---
No-one has anywhere near that much ultracite ammo without: duping, trading with dupers, or picking up duped items.  
---
Why would he trade the whole stack back and forth a bunch of times?  He wouldn't.  Excess ammo would go to the mule and stay there until a reasonable amount is needed on his main.
---
What this guy said is the way to fix it.  If you’re on PS4, I can jump in and do it for you (no charge for CAMP building, I love doing it) if you can’t figure it out yourself.
---
Yes, you are bud. 
---
Hopping servers is perfectly viable solution and takes about 20 seconds
---
  Atom store plants and the store fireplace come to mind.
---
May love find it's way back into your heart. Have a good one. 
---
Nope. Also I checked out your comment history. This isn't the only post you're going full psycho mode either. 
---
Lesson learned. Use some common sense. Goodbye, your opinion is invalid. 
---
Heres a post with all the [info](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/323720/atomic-shop-update-legend-of-the-mothman-feb-19-2019)
---
Never encountered this before
---
That was probably the Blade of Bastet 
---
It has a good amount of armor piercing and very solid damage output
---
half the ranged weapons reside in the strength tree. that would only work if strength boosted shotguns and heavy weapons.
---
You might be schizophrenic if you are this paranoid about conspiracies.
---
 what iam trying to say if you take the duped stuff your after out shouldnt matter after that whats being traded since you removed the items rest should be able to be bought and amased as much as you can hold without being banned 
---
I assumed 900hrs since launch which is approximately 90 days ago.  That's like 9+hrs per day to play.
---
I think it was proven elsewhere the guy was doing something sleazy so, let's give a virtual fist bump and move on.  ✊
---
No, but if you kill a guy who carries 5000 ressources (and I did this 2 times last week) you can either throw it away or make plastic your top priority because you'll need it in masses.
---
Full blown phsyco? I dont think that word means the same to you and I. 
---
 Excavator Power Armor will always be the Yellow short bus armor to me, no matter what color you make it. More so because of all the people that die holding on to 300lbs worth of crap when using it.
---
Lol 
---
not sure if im doing anything wrong but that link only goes so far for me then i get a blank page :/ wanted to report some asshole who 1 shot me then, when i went back to get my loot, 1 shot me again 
---
Because we aren't socialists. 
---
I came across a player's junk pile that had 75000 wood.  I mean, sure, one could argue that he spent months grinding for wood that early on, was a time traveler, or something.  But one could also argue that dupers have no reason NOT TO dupe everything, including wood or - gasp - ammo.
---
Link to source?
---
&gt; You had over 360,000 of RARE ammo, and hundreds of thousands of other types over two accounts.
---
You're not reading the email, you're assuming you know what "acquired X within 30 days of game play" means. You don't, because BGS hasn't fucking told us what it means yet. They really should, either to prove /uGlorf12 is full of shit, or to admit they're really just tracking anytime an account picks up something, even if it was just the same ammo they dropped.
---
That's why I asked. Basic conversion.
---
Ok, I think I get what your saying.  But they are looking at transaction history from before the dupe removal and before the carry limit as well.
---
So salty, almost more than me about this suspension. (Not ban) 
---
That's exactly what they want!
---
Yeah your right I just didn’t specify that I’m just saying that’s what will even it out melee should be a bit stronger then ranged due to the fact that your risking getting up close as opposed to shooting at a distance but right now the gap is to big so this should give ranged the damage they need to compete with melee. No need to nerf anything.
---
I bought like 14 serums and they all work fine, just make sure you don’t have starched genes equipped and make sure you use carnivore / herbivore last or you won’t be able to acquire any mutations through serums
---
Looking to the future. Optimism is free. It sits well with me.
---
Ok that's a relief, thanks. Grinding at leveling for a bloody build so I was a bit concerned. 
---
The Mothman is always watching
---
Todd Howard said we are supposed to work together to get the codes. How is that an exploit?
---
He was probably using shotgun shells as fast as he was making them.  We don't know if the database is scraped live or does it in hourly intervals or what.
---
What about the people who aren’t traders but use the “plans” player icon like me?
---
Oof. I was wondering why I was hurting so bad today. Really hoping for a hotfix on this one. I have quite a few mutations... trying to get rid of a particular one so I can then get it again would really suck. 😭
---
They could have left it at the original 400, and told us to "deal with it"...but they didn't, I'm happier with the slow increases instead of risking more server instabilities. 
---
Least it didnt give u a wanted level
---
Logical increments is super helpful. I have IT experience and I still use it when building a rig.
---
As far as putting it together goes: it's nearly impossible to put something in the wrong spot with PC's anymore.
---
People *really* want to believe that. It's understandable since so much else improves as you level and it's something people *want* to be true, but the evidence just doesn't support it.
---
Sounds good man, will let you know if i need any.
---
At least you still killed him before the robots did. 👍👍
---
I am! Thanks for taking notice. I know it's strange that being honest and thoughtful where and when its appropriate doesn't equate into being a party pooper or someone who can't fun. So weird...
---
Two Shit should always be explosive.
---
The scoreched say not us not us when they’re looking for you. If you’re stealth build they will literally walk on top of you saying this 
---
Haven't been on yet, but that makes me a bit excited...😊
---
But after removal of items that shouldnt matter after reading all these post sure they got dupers but in that mix they caught ppl who build trade shops and enjoy trading and being social 
---
the comment about flat land to build on made me laugh.  been doing that myself!  ha ha!
---
No weapon mods onto power armour like a gun on the shoulder or something 
---
I've never brought one under half since they never land for me, so this is good news.

What section are the billboards in? I cant find them

Did the Kill a large creature challenge work? On PC here and have killed several on the large creatures on the list without it triggering. 
---
Good luck my friend, I hope you get this sorted out. 
---
The post that I read started like that but ended up suggesting just removing/regarding rads, not the mutation (which does not work). I have not read anyone reporting that what you have said had worked.
---
If someone wants to test it with a alternate toon I have a of spare adrenal reaction serum to donate (PC)
---
This has been an issue. Nothing new here. And I believe Bethesdas fix is to unequip all armor parts from the chassis and then log out and log back in. Reequip. You should take a look into their fix if the problem persists
---
People out here spreading misinformation on both sides. Thats what makes everything so confusing. You are no better than them
---
Is there an official Bethesda position on increasing the CAMP budget? Is it a possibility? If not, is it possible to reduce the amount of budget space taken up by things like turrets and the fertilizer pen?
---
getting on now. GT Harry Wagstaff
---
I know, I was a bit of a cunt. They may be pretty bad at this, but I don’t think it makes sense to think that they would purposely remove a feature and not say anything. As well as think they would cover it up. Unfortunately I think all their mistakes are just incompetence. 
---
I don't think he's mad, he just heavily invested in the topic and regularly defends duping scenarios.  He described personally going through 120000 steel a few months ago as a reason why people carrying 60000 was normal, and using a mule account that weighs 12000 pounds to help with his massive loot cache.
---
He takes any thread mentioning duping - even ones Bethesda singles out with personal attention - as a personal accusation against him.
---
Actually, the whole point of my statement went over your head. Also, it was about your statement " there will never be a way to prove you didn't do something" which is untrue. He could have been recording the entire time he was playing thus proving he was not duping. Also, we all know he has two accounts that is not a point of contention. The point of contention was duping or not duping. Which he was banned for having to much of items on both his accounts that Bethesda says is impossible to have in just 1 month. 
---
Wow, it's almost like people need to be reminded that this is, in fact, the truth.
---
What do you mean, killing a 3 star legendary 14 levels above you shouldn't result in a fucking paintbrush?
---
Yea idk, this guys just on one. Let the wingnut say his piece I guess.
---
And just like high school assignments - I'll be the guy browsing on his phone while the other student does all the work. Just make sure we get an A, nerd.
---
That’s exactly how i read it too. This is a perfect way to keep the undesirables out with no explanation hardly. Unfortunately good people get wrapped up in it to
---
&gt; dude, you had over 300k in just ultracite combined on your two accounts for just 1 month
---
That is not what BGS's email says, though. It says "acquired", and we haven't heard a response from BGS to the question of whether that counts trading 20k of ammo from a main to a mule and back again, or dropping and picking up ammo. If it does, you can "acquire" 140k of ammo in a month really fucking fast without ever actually having 140k of the ammo. Crafting 20k ultracite isn't difficult, I did it with the day I got a prime receiver for my .50 cal and have done that much or more several days since.
---
We damn well better get the skins we've already bought available for excavator.
---
It wasn't an issue on consoles, but PC players were getting shafted hard. It really fucked up the game. On console you could help people by dropping purple moss clumps or whatever the host needed but didn't have, but PC it was almost always a waste cause host wouldn't pick it up. I even got banished from some worlds for dropping things.
---
 Not sure if it works in pvp but I think he means you hit them once you have pain trained them into moving

&gt; If a sword was worth anything against a machine gun, the army would still issue swords... just sayin

"The army" issues semi-automatic rifles because too many bullets were wasted with fully-automatic. Interpret that however you will.

PSA: hit Triangle on PS4 lol
---
&gt;How does Bethesda expect people to buy these overpriced cosmetics if you can’t see what the X-01 Mothman PA set and headlamp look like.
---
If you could see them you might not buy them. 
---
They'll nerf everything so that it's as fragile as energy weapons are. 
---
And your character's uncontrolled diabetes will progress leading you to require even more water.
---
While Bethesda has a terrible track record. I highly doubt they would state that their accounts would be reinstated when the exploit was fixed, if they had no intention of fixing it. 
---
On the other hand they could have stated that to shadow ban people, and make it look like it was just a suspension. 
---
In any case, the way it reads is that it is a suspension until the exploit is fixed. Not a ban. No matter how you read it, it is a suspension. 
---
I just gave my lvl 15 alt a adrenal reaction serum. He is getting the positive effects. Going to wipe all mutations off my main and re apply. Thanks Bethesda.
---
I thought my birthday was in 3 days!? Just reading the part about scorchbeast sonic waves getting a 10 second cooldown made me legit think that was a birthday present just for me! Scorchbeasts were the only reason I stopped playing as much as I was the first few months just because every time one (7/10 times really but basically all of them) aggro’d on me it would just spam a never ending barrage of sonic waves power armor or not just death awaited. But this is a birthday present I am most satisfied with.
---
I have a two shot explosive shotgun that I swapped out for an anti armor explosive one, guess what? I don't really use it *at all*. I also have a handmade, a combat rifle, a minigun, another handmade, and probably 2 other guns.. almost none of which I ever use.
---
I've got two pieces of armor that reduces the weight of weapons, 1 for junk, 1 ammo, 1 reduces the weight of aid. I run bandolier 2 always, pack rat sometimes, the perks that reduce food with and aid weight. I weigh about 213-215 and have a max without power armor of 355, just 5 pounds less than in power armor with calibrated shocks.
---
All that said, I can pick up 140lbs of shit anytime I go anywhere doing anything.. why the fuck do I need to care about anything related to weight? And almost anything I pick up weighs less, so I can pick up even more of it than you can if you could pick up the same weight.

It's not a "nerf" if it was clearly not intended to work that way.

The pipboy glitch is still there for me on xbox. Anyone else? 
---
Loaded in, flipped it open and everything locked up. I could access the map and quit which I couldnt do before but I was locked in place. 
---
Cool, is that bug only on pc? Im on xbox so that fix isnt going to work
---
Supply drops now belong to those who request them. Others can only loot them (whats left in them anyway) after the owner unlocks them.
---
It’s dumb, but that’s how it is.
---
Why use that one? There are many free icons to choose from. The Raiders icon should be people looking to pvp. There is a legit system to tell people what you are doing in the game we just have to designate a few and use them regularly. Others will catch on. 
---
Well, whoopee shit.
---
If that time is from launch which is 90 days he got banned for having all that ammo in a 30 day time period as stated from Bethesda so I don't see how that is possible without duping.
---
The roads in the game are in much better condition than most of the roads in WVa. Also, the games version of Beckley has a lot more to do and see than the one irl.
---
You can find them in the nuke zones only
---
Yea im pretty happy I stepped away from sneak in this game early on. 
---
New this patch, or has it been that way for a while? 
---
you played this trash that many hours lmao
---
All good. I not overly impressed with balancing so far so I do admit I may of jumped the gun. Hopefully they get the bug stuff worked out and we can see some new content soon. 
---
I know you got 4 down votes but I liked your input! Thanks bud!
---
The plants you need to make it are rare, so youll need greenthumb if you do it that way. The recipes should be unlocked in your chemistry bench. Youll need other parts you get from dead enemies in nuke zones to make it stable. So your also working against time as unstable flux spoils. So the flowers you pick you have to convert or itll spoil. Killing the queen also gives flux as a reward but its random and not too much. Try checking vendors and if youre desperate steal it from a dead guys bag.

---
hEY op, STILL PLAYING FO? lulul blind fanboys are teh worst
---
People aren't grinding to be as powerful as possible because it makes for stagnant gameplay that's similar to one shotting dragons out of the sky. Anyone can go online and copy some soulless bullshit character build, no one is impressed by your superior legendaries you fucking sperg
---
Yeah. From the reports I've seen. You should be safe.
---
Ill find out if the application ever finishes updating...
---
Can we also see what our Power Armor Chassis currently contains? I'm having to cycle through PA's to see which one I want 
---
The Good With Salt perk works with Raw Flux, and it's terrific
---
Someone here on this post just confirmed it
---
Yes from the reports I've see. You should be safe.
---
I had not seen that post about the perma ban. I stand by my statement that most of these posts are about an account suspension not a ban. There is a difference. Because is you read the letter it states accounts will be reinstated after exploit was fixed. I did not in fact spread misinformation. 
---
If I had it my way I would not even see any of these posts, by people that thrive on spreading misinformation. The ones that do it intentionally to poke the bear. 
---
Definitely the through-wall conduit, as others have stated, it’s enough to make you not want to use this important item. But the “it moved upstairs” happens on other things too. I had a long battle with a resort planter that kept “going upstairs” until I finally removed the upstairs so I could put it on the floor properly. All of this over a potted plant.
---
You're a fuckin idiot if you think I cheat.  Period.  
---
  In games you either cheat or you don't. Its very black and white indeed!
---
Yeah, the whole fix one thing and break another is getting old. Makes you worry for the future of the game.
---
I've had it happen at least three times, despite knowing picking locks in a workshop will get you wanted, simply because I didn't know where the workshop boundaries ended.
---
Worst one was Red Rocket Megastop. There's a computer there with a QUEST, but it's still inside the workshop boundaries. I went there to pick up the quest, saw a locked box near the computer, picked it, got wanted. 
---
Lol Most don't get far in life cruising on other people's work but amazingly some mange to keep doing it for a very long time. I haven't solved a nuke code yet but I did gather all the codes for one silo only to find that getting the decryption key phrase from the bunker is an arduous process
---
thanks, should I remove all? Or try to get lucky with the roulette and work from there?
---
I've seen three God Rolls. One, a level 50 Troubleshooter's Super Sledge with 40% faster swing and 90% reduced weight. It's my go to weapon for silos, and it makes them trivial. 
---
One, a level 50 Anti Armor DCG with 40% faster swing and 90% reduced weight. This is my PVP weapon, I do 1200 dmg minimum with it. 
---
One, a level 50 Bloodied Gauss Rifle with faster reload speed and +250 dmg resist while ADS. This one was unfortunately lost because I was dumb and dropped it on the ground for my friend and it fell thru the floor or whatever crap does when they disappear.
---
All looted by me. Never duped. 
---
And at least 3 pieces of my Unyielding AP Refresh Heavy Combat set is legit, either looted by me or traded to me by friends that do not dupe. Unfortunately, I DO have that Unyielding AP Refresh right leg that was duped into oblivion but until I get a replacement for it I will use it. 
---
So, your comment is invalid. Stop being a spoiled brat that expects everything handed to you on a silver platter. 
---
Naw they only ban legit players 
---
Not sure if it’s a life but it was a job.
---
Duping and selling items on eBay and Craigslist he was making money hand over fist destabilizing the platform, ruining everyone’s gaming experience all the while talking crap about bethesda 
---
I get if you’re unhappy and angry about the game play,  but if you’re intentionally breaking stuff by duping AND COMPLAINING 
---
You got no excuse. 
---
I see now, thanks!
---
Oh shit the fuck yo with this kind of stupid ducking posts.
---
Have you ever considered your just fucking stupid? 
---
No I’m not mad, or a fanboy of any of the stuff you’re going to suggest.
---
Post like this are just useless and are looking for attention 
---
Most spread it out of ignorance like you did. You changed your post after i gave proof that people did
---
Actually... that makes a lot of sense. 
---
Add me in! And my Bloodied build is suffering for it. :(
---
I'm glad you read the input n liked it at least.  I find theres a few people who dont like the easy access to not rightfully earned or acquired items. Purists almost. But this reddit page is outweighed by more ppl looking to acquire those duped items and get their hands on em. It may be an opinion not shared with all.
---
My point, overall, is that There is no actual reason to change this.  It is only an issue if you are afraid of having a bounty...  I took the Workshop.  I built Defenses.   I built Collectors.  I built a Room around the Workbench.  You are trying to steal said Workshop from me.  Why should I make it easy on you?
---
If you are afraid of having a Bounty, and thus of PVP, why are you contesting a Workshop, thus triggering PVP?  
---
really?  so the grafton monster has some background?  i may have to research that more.
---
In theory, it's not the damage that matters but the stagger to counter the benefit from sentinel pieces to give you an opening to do the damage.
---
The 100% chance to stagger for 1 perk point vs the 12% chance per bullet for 3 perk points. 
---
The downside to Pain Train is the fact you have to charge them.
---
Admittedly, I'm unsure if it's viable.
---
Melee doesn’t give you multi-K damage without having to run extremely low HP, high rad, multi kill, aid taking combination like TSE did.  
---
Don’t make it sound like melee is just so OP, it absolutely has trade offs.  A melee needs to be up close and personal too, if you can’t hang with a melee that close then don’t let them cover the ground to get to you.  
---
My sledge does ~330 damage without adrenaline and everything else maxed mutations and perks wise and barely takes a millimeter off the SBQ health with each hit with a limited swing speed even when maxed with legendary effect and Ninja perk; even then I have to chain kills to get it to 800 damage with adrenaline to make it more noticeable.  I don’t like the low HP build as it’s too impractical to enjoy or play to get to 1k damage territory.  Too easy to die and reset everything even if you try luck and AP tank perks.
---
You’re not too smart it seems 
---
I'm only getting negative effect from adrenal reaction.
---
u are garbage
---
omg!  that is funny.  roads are really that bad huh?
---
 Yeah, if I can get at her, she dies quick. ;)
---
This really needs a quick fix, this week.   Players that have bought numerous mutations don't want to hear "just reaquire it" as they will lose too many other paid for mutations in the process.  Bethesda needs to fix this, and quickly.    If Bethesda can search all characters for materials or items that meet certain criteria, then Bethesda can search all characters that have the Adrenal Reaction mutation and fix it for them, too.
---
Shame you got caught?
---
It's just Bethesda white knights left, eager to suck Todd Howard off now, breaking their arms jerking themselves off while virtue signalling their position on duping. So, yes it has gone to shit.
---
I had purple snkoe coming out my hot rodder X-01 it looked sick
---
I can make about 6 serums right now, I have the plans and enough flux for that amount. I'm on PC and will sell them for 300 caps. Any takers, get at me!
---
Same hahaha
---
They didnt even say they’d fix it just that removing and reaquiring does actually work. Annoying for us with 10 mutations yea.
---
Thanks -- I didn't realise you could get both traits on a piece.
---
I bought a house two years ago.  I can't tell you how many houses around here have foundation issues because they're on sloped lots, but I can tell you it's nearly all of them.
---
You clearly have no sense of humor.
---
Your such a rebel.
---
There are other prime fissure sites all over this place keeps getting farmed
