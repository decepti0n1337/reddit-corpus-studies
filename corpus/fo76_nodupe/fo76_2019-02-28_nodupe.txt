I always prefer trading in caps. As you mentioned, it is the most safest way to trade.
---

---
But, most desirable items only go for trades unfortunately, and on this note. I literally buy items, just so I could trade them as an alternative to caps when they refuse cap deals on an item I want.
---
Hopefully, the new vendor system will be very useful for caps trading in the upcoming update. 
---
---
---
I have a CAMP near Whitesprings and recently added an artillery piece for one purpose.
---
Check your in game settings. I been talking to myself lmao. Set your audio to Auto and P2T on
---
Yeah, I always try, even if it says 0.
---
The Big Boy üòÉ
---
I agree 100%  apple ][ GS.  Killed that game.
---
The orders were placed by most people before that video came out. That video is actually the video that made everyone realize they had been tricked and flipped out.
---
The thing is, most players that are highly involved with trades easily hit the cap limit of 25k. This makes caps an unreliable source while trading.
---
So I couldn't really do this, as I am sitting at 22k at the moment. I could only take upto 3k more.
---
Are you on PC? I‚Äôd join that if possible. 
---
Dressed in golf gear, you will notice them if they're not in a mob of 10 standard ghouls 
---
Not sure if it's any help, but I found two in seemingly RNG locations: One in a supply crate, and another inside of that shack directly across from the track side of the Charleston station, where most of the time I've found a flare gun.
---
I have a trap base made out of foundations there. It has ome turret shooting into the clubhouse meant trigger people like you. Really is funny how many get stuck and inevitability BBQ'd to death. 
---
The point being they should still understand how to operate an online game from the experience from ESO. 
---
Wish i could, but then this post would be removed by the moderators cuz of the witch hunting rule.
---
At least there is a karma system that could somewhat be effective.
---
I wonder if I can post a meetup.com event...that meets on fo76
---
I'm still not sure how you can be tricked if it was never advertised as a glass bottle. Not once. Not anywhere. 
---
Mine likes to crash at the Nuka Cola plant. After I pick up the power core in the cage room. As soon as I leave the room and look at the work bench it goes black screen hard locked.

Only break 3 things doing it? So a good patch from them...
---
Please no. Fix what is broken first
---
I dont think so actually. There was a post a few days ago about this scorched beasts and queen are considered animals in the games code. That's why animal friend effects them. The legendary effect hunted is what deals more damaged to it. The Zealot effect only effects humanoid scorched.
---
That's an interesting one. I must actually try that. 
---
Being a single dad that works a lot (not to get too personal) I‚Äôm quite casual with my gaming lol. I‚Äôm in no danger of running into the ‚Äúend‚Äù playing 1-2 hours a week.

Appreciate what you‚Äôre saying though, used to have tons of game time, and yeah having nothing left to do in a game you enjoyed playing blows. 
---
Yeah starched genes is the most important one. I always try and hook people up with their first mutations, and I tell them to stash the serum if they don't have starched genes unlocked yet.

Bump upvoting

Having been in the audit industry for a decade I have to say that I have a bro-crush on you for this post.

You can glitch turrets inside the unbreakable foundations.

Clear photoshop there friends. Killing a SBQ these days is just too rare for me to trust his ;) 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nice shot
---
Id love to see more heavy weapons. Like a one shot cannon similar in functionality but like a tank gun that will rip your arms off if below a certain strength or without power armor.
---
Giving credit to the master!
---
Some people have no interest in PvP. Just because you do, doesn't mean everyone else should follow suit. There are many other aspects of the game I do enjoy, just because griefed annoy me, fallout isn't the game for me? Interesting logic there pal. 
---
I hope you feel the same when it‚Äôs you
---
Gotcha that makes sense, maybe I'll look for hunters legendary over zealot
---
God I‚Äôd love a plain assault rifle and a desert eagle
---
Yea, im a heavy build and it sucks with all these nerfs. 
---
Yep i know that pain, same deal with the poseidon energy plant, spend ages fixing everything, crash before finishing and get nothing
---
Can confirm, still occurs with v1.6.0
---
I'm also still rather confident that this is a **Ryzen-specific** issue, seeing as all the posters who have listed their system specs have been Ryzen owners. 
---
I've even updated my BIOS, now running AGESA PinnaclePI v1.0.0.6.   
---
But again I repeat that this originally wasn't a thing when I started playing FO76, being introduced sometime later in a patch. (I also blame this for my performance not being what it was when originally released).
---
OMG i finally got it to stop crashing, then i had to put up with all the DMV robots BS and running back and forth. Frustrated doesnt do my emotions justice.
---
at LVL 177 I have yet to find a chainsaw. You make me so jealous with this video. Well done!
---
It would be great if nukes later turned to traveling rad storms.
---
At lvl 32, relatively new to FO76.  Was searching for more info on the death tambo...saw your post, didnt look at the date, just commented to share what I learned this weekend.  .... 
---
okay i found a solution 
---

---
This seems to have fixed it for me, or at least as soon as i did this i made it through and got past the quest. i have a multi core ryzen 2700x, and the fallout engine is deffo potato so this makes sense
---
Nice!
---
Agree! Going from FO4 where you can craft anything to FO76 where you can‚Äôt craft anything until you have plans sucks. I would love to be able to see all mods. 
---
That is a nice screenshot.
---
PSA - everyone already knows this and do it regardless just to screw with you.  Destroying their base does nothing to them really.
---
Use the indestructable foundations and glitch the turrets inside the foundations so they can't even damage it. LOL
---
I think you struggle with the idea that folks can be assholes but NPCs can‚Äôt. 
---
Or you‚Äôre purposely being a jerk to legitimize what you‚Äôre already doing
---
But you can keep telling yourself that it‚Äôs ok just remember that when it‚Äôs you
---
I find this hilarious and completely approve.
---
1. There's no way to know what somebody has until you initiate a trade.
---
2. It's rarely just scrap that somebody wants, it's usually medicine, weapons or ammo
---
3. "Wrong people"? How do you recommend I find the right people? Message randos without any warning?
---
This I would pay cash for. 
---
Ok....done. The weapon should appear back in your inventory next time you login. Just do a hard reset and you should be all set. You‚Äôre welcome :)
---
Costumes - golf outfits , straight jackets etc 
---
I really hope they fix it. I want to be able to run around using it on/off for at very least an hour or two before I have to repair. I have a two godroll 3* ive been saving till they fix it (TSE with 90% reduced weight) and (BE with 50 SMG resist) 
---
You must be fun at parties lolz
---
Pretty presumptuous of you to assume that everyone not talking to you DOESN'T have a mic.
---
Based on the Latin translation of irae, I would say most people have a very good reason NOT to talk to you. 
---
Yes it was prior to december it was advertised to match the nuka colas they sold at target which were glass bottles.
---
Well played man. People that treat people like that annoy the hell out of me. Got a good laugh out of it, thanks. I would also report him to the market reddit or whatever site you met him on.Some lesser experienced person might fall for his lies, always makes me sad reading or hearing about some of that stuff.
---
 I started a new character and several people would attack me cause i was a lvl 7 in the bog. Just minding my business.  Id lure whatever i could to them even got some to attack a guys camp. The best part of that was he was calling me stupid for going over there. It wasnt so dumb when i ran to his camp with 4 mirelurk kings following me. Was almost as funny as the time i got an assaultron to go after a guy just a few levels higher than me who was desperate to try and kill me. 
---
Fair enough. Loved your story :)
---
It has happened to me, and this is how I rationalised it. 
---
Never let them get close enough to power attack, and make sure you have a perk card with stagger. These turds can definitely be put down, you just have to be properly equipped to do it. 
---
 I had a similar thing happen recently where a guy was one hitting all the ghoulsat the golf club and got pissed when me and a buddy tried to tag his kills. He killed my buddy, I switched to my shotgun, capped his leg and then one more shot to the face, he was dead, and  i  walked away with roughly 20 bulk plastic and some lead. I did leave some spoiled meat in his bag along  with the rest of his trash junk  before hopping servers.
---
A "recipe book" in your pip boy or the menu would be great. Trying to complete my crafting character was/is a royal pain without. Whenever I am working the save at least 5 pages have to be open in my browser with info. Wis it was view able in game.
---
Right. I absolutely hate Fallout 4s and 76s Assault Rifle, its extremely ugly to me. Lol. The Handmade is pretty good but I would still prefer the true Chinese Assault Rifle over it any day.
---
High hopes for a TSE and BE there. Explosive eats your weapons.
---
Purified water. If you got the time to capture a workshop (Like Poseidon) and spam medium water purifiers, you‚Äôll start making tons of caps. Plus, it is also is a decent healing item. 
---
Thanks for taking your time to make this.
---
Like I only saw the terminal picture at first and like I seriously read all of it like looking for the letter between j and l and like was thinking omg if I dont find a k then this guy got me good, but like I got myself good cause like I didnt even see the other half of the photo till i found the k. But like seriously good find. Kay I'm outties.
---
I like it. I like it a lot. 
---
It would be cool if there was like a guaranteed 3 star or something to really bring people in. Of course, 3 stars need to have better drops first. 
---
Gulpers. Those things have fkd me up more than the ants.
---
They are great. Particularly if you get the horde event. 
---
It seems bugged because if you leave the leader alone, it will constantly spawn in new adds. 
---
So yeah I don't think they are too strong. Just strong. A large group will make you play like supposed, work them slowly. One or two can be taken out fairly fast.
---
Oh that‚Äôs way easier to craft than the marine tactical helmet. Will check if I got the plans on my next session. Thanks for that. 
---
Game crashed, gimme a sec
---
Some just have no class. Good on you for the olive branch. Sucks he couldn't appreciate it.
---
I was shocked at how much they nerfed a 10mm. That gun used to be my main weapon for most of the game in FO3/FNV. How a pipe revolver is better then a 10mm...I will never know.
---
I totally deserved it, and I knew better. I was a little salty that I lost all the lead I just bulked, but I won that idiot award. 
---
One of my characters has a camp back there so i can farm the gulf course without having one of those bases pop up. Do note my camp does NOT have much of anything but a few walls, a bed, stash box and armor or weapons bench for anyone's use. Yet i still have other players destroy the little i do have in it. I would understand if i had turrents on it, fine, but i dont so why destroy it? Its there to keep the camps with turrents from bothering anyone trying to farm the place so why?  
---
While they're at it. I'd like if they buffed nuka quantum grenades. Both visually and damage wise (on the nuke damage factor, of which nqg do 0 of) they're inferior to a nuka grenade.
---
Molerat because you know they will always spawn when you don't want them too, will waste your time trying to find and kill them, and wreck any chances of taking a workshop when they refuse to surface from under the ground. 
---
After reloggin for about 5 times the quest popped back on again, whew...
---
He could turn around, unbutton a flap and let the butt pop out like on a union suit. 
---
Long bow bar mod and the flamer mod repaired to 200 percent I can mow g to an level 68 ghouls and whatnot with ease with the chainsaw. I'm level 101 and it's my favorite weapon. I do have adrenal reaction so the lower my health the higher weapon damage. I've had my chainsaw up to like 77 damage. 
---
That's the rare banjchairo. Nice find!
---
I had a guy once try and lock pick my front door, before I can say, "Hey,  my torrents will mess you up my dude." he unlocked my door and the turrets messed him up.
---
I have a Calibrated Shocks Excavator... and I love mining in it...  being able to carry over 400 units (500+ with login bug) is awesome.
---
Hey Bethesda, I've got over 3k Atoms waiting for some paint... Either expand the existing ones to the Excavator, or create new ones... either way you get my Atoms. :P
---
Word. Sent a friend request. On whenever
---
I farm that guy, he has 15-20 caps, and valuable weapons and armor.  Quick 100 caps for vendor.   The two times he spawned 3* I got a thorough bashing.  
---
I love how quickly he escalated from asshole to victim in a matter of seconds. And then to dead meat.
---
To add insult to injury now his story is public domain. This story is awesome lol
---
Seriously everytime I do nuked whitesprings with a group of 3 other people I see those drop. They are always doggy bagged and left to the nether. So yeah,  do nuked whitesprings clubhouse with friends.
---
Workshops :(
---
You do realize some people actually enjoy roleplaying right? That includes roleplaying as raiders. It is literally built into the game.
---
Just switch servers in that case, some people are just mean.
---
Just say no to loot boxes, kids.  
---
I think a LOT of the serious players are feeling this way right now. Same boat. I have several 5 star perks that are useless now and am trying to build up for my new profile but its painful. I agree with your post 100%, man we need to be able to redistribute our points and break down multi star cards. 
---
K well thx idk if they took 2 shots but thx for the helpfull advice
---
He had it coming lol. This story is my way of giving him the negative karma he deserves.
---
I know he will see this, because I see him on this reddit. I have hopes that he will say something here. It would be hilarious.
---
I was talking more ar-15 or hk-16 but the Chinese assault rifle would be good too
---
Actively looking for pvp and actively looking for people that you can terrorise in any possible way without them complying is something else. I don't get why lately people claim to be "raiders" but if you want to have fun with pvp do workshop or hunter radio.
---
I know workshop pvp is not where we want it to be atm but that doesn't mean you are allowed to chase people down till they leave the server. Danger while roaming is a aspect of survival games yes. In 76 this danger mainly consists of pve stuff. It's just the type of game it is. Running around blowing up camps without any reason doesn't make you a "raider".  
---
 I have taken to shooting him on sight. ;)
---
There is nothing about the candidate‚Äôs knowledge of the game. I guess it‚Äôs assumed.
---
I know the feeling, been there a time or two myself.
---
I used to see him every other time I logged in. But I haven't seen him in weeks now. 
---
think graham sells it.
---
Thank you very much for the reply, I do appreciate the time you took, it did cement for me the proper way to conduct business here. 
---
Boy liar
---
That receiver was there from the start. You even get a 10mm one from a quest.
---
Restricting the build area there kinda removes the idea of open world base building.
---
I can see how its annoying. Ive personally done it myself but have moved my base now.. Afterall you can No longer get xp from the turret kills while being far away, so its not really worth it anymore.
---
I dont think there should be a building restriction there, maybe a turret restriction, but not a general base restriction. 
---
PLEASE A MOD TO AIM
---
like the circle or dot sight the combat shotgun has
---
I say combat shotgun, because the pump action is simply not able to provide an aimed shot target...
---
I discover a game named elder scroll online :
---
Aren't you guys ashamed of the results of the work you provided on fallout 76 ?
---
I havent even seen a rad storm yet, granted I don't play every day, but I've played a decent amount.
---
I've experienced it.
---
With a lough from rose
---
So far I've seen that your characters will be interchangeable between the two modes of play.
---
I think that was the original plan, but idk at the moment 
---
Plasma weapons are half ballistic so you'd see more damage...on 50% of your total bullets.
---
They still work you just have to teleport to the vault before you server hop than travel back after relogging.
---
And I want a princess castle!! 
---
Chain axe. WH40k style
---
This is possible. It‚Äôs not like asking for a large addition to the map...
---
I've hot mic "omfg shut the fuck up" and blasted his ass for longer than I care to admit üòÜ
---
Yes and they always have. You can see the armor come off layer by layer as you add ranks of Incisor or AA weapons.
---
\&gt;While wearing an Hazmat Suit.  
---
You're not worthy of Him. Die.
---
It would be neat if the storm moved over the map like a real storm (and could also be seen on the map so you know where it is)
---
It'll probably still be there.
---
I use the Executioner's Ultracite daily. Anything under level 40 or so it will shred and the ammo is ludicrously cheap/easy to find. It also weighs about a third of a similar quality ballistic rifle.
---
Honestly I'd be happy with it if AA just did it's fucking job.
---
Can I have a sling on my pole hook?
---
Dude... no. I am no animator nor someone who makes games but I can tell you that this kind of thing still takes tremendous effort. 
---
Yeah on PC. The runs will probably start around 11pm CST/UTC-6 and run for as long as we have people that want to do it. IGN: jchamlin. Discord J.C.#0507. Not sure what day we will actually spin this up, but I will put up a Reddit post and announce it to give everyone enough notice.
---
As a fellow suspendee isn't making a new account itself against TOS?
---
Agree or disagree.  Like or dislike.  You are free to do either, but no one, NO ONE deserves death threats.  See you in the wasteland!
---
 
---
I wish you the best and hope you find, obtain, and keep happiness in your life through any avenue you seek. The fact that you came back to play shows your undying love for the game, which speaks to the awesomeness of the game. 
---
Awesome turnout. That's like 25% of people still playing this turd.
---
My buddy considers this a killable offense. We'll wreck your place and then you as you try to farm. I'm ambivalent about it but he's like got a serious issue and I'm along for the ride.
---
I know that, but it‚Äôs possible. I‚Äôm not asking for it right now, but as a consideration. 
---
Guns are all well and good, but us melee folks want in on it too. More mod options would be nice. There's a bunch that I'm surprised we don't have already...
---
- Super Sledge variants of the sledgehammer mods, bladed, spiked, electrified, etc.
---
- Power Fist variants that have existed before
---
- Fire/Wood Axe mods for electrified, sharp, piercing, flaming maybe?
---
- Bumper. Sword.
---
Nice! That‚Äôs a little late for me being CST myself and working at 7am. But I‚Äôll see what I can do as it sounds fun and the plans would be great. 
---
Guess I know where I'm headed next
---
I've noticed bodies drop below the surface of the map or into accessible structures or through the top layer of the ground, I'm guessing to surfaces below that were covered with more textures during the world build. They seem to loose clipping when killed and fall into oblivion.
---
I think the bounty system is just bad, especially with workshops, if i guy in no power armor can stand getting hit by 8 turrets and one shotsyou with a shotgun farming 98 caps per kill, then follows you to another workshop to just to  do the same thing, it's just a bad system and it's probably going to stay like that. 
---
Not only do you lose the caps from the workshop you lose the caps from being killed by another player who has no intrest in the workshop and  100% of the time stronger than you and just trolling for caps. 
---
It sucks that people have been harassing you. I wish you all the best in not being harassed.
---
It also sucks you got banned. If it were me, I would've jumped ship permanently as it would just leave a bad taste in my mouth. I'm glad to see you can still enjoy the game.
---
I hope you get better quickly.
---
Is there any discussion on Power armor fist weapons/weapon mods going on? :X 
---
Uhhhhhh no please don't. There's enough players using only fat men to pvp as is.
---
Bad idea...i say a mini nuke!
---
You're sick!

 *Dodgson*, *Dodgson*, *we*'ve *got Dodgson here*!

The vendor just east of Top of the world has all the plans. Raider vendor. The one who is on a closed floor only accessable from the floor above.
---
Some days we could probably start earlier. I'll collect interest levels and times and figure out when it will work the best for most people. Stay tuned. Add me in game and in Discord and I'll keep you updated.
---
How did he not see you sorry ? I've tried hiding from menacing  players but they seem to see me easy no matter where I hide . Did you use a stealth boy ? 
---
Let me guess. Guy running around in a hazmat suit swinging a deathclaw gauntlet?  Seems to be the norm for this behavior. 
---
Ive never played Destiny, but have you seen the roadmap plan for 76? 
---
Brrrrrrrrrrrt
---
I like reading the terms and conditions on the prize certificates. It always gives me a chuckle.
---
no offense but when they cant fix things like adrenal reaction mutation, what they ruined in a last patch why did u think they will add anything new to this game... escpecialy when this will not incrase the profit? u can except new atom shop item but nothing else.
---
Because I am the scorpion 
---
Sounds like you need to watch the Japanese anime "The Rising of the Shield Hero", you might find something meaningful there, just like I did.
---
What's wrong?
---
I was thinking they should Buff the Mothman Flatwoods Grafton etc to make them more like a Raid encounter, something that if you weren't prepared for you might have to run away from! FEAR THE MOTHMAN!
---
I think that‚Äôs all power armor plans but I‚Äôll check. 
---
Permadeath and full loot pvp? Yes please. G
---
Haha, great robot chicken reference 
---
the main problem is: u can doit and its nice. but they get a shitload junk from ghouls and this is why is no cost for them to repair, but u will be wanted with 800-1000cp bounty...
---
Will do. Thanks!!
---
Melee Finisher animations from fallout 4. 
---
Nice idea, reminds me of FO4, you could use reverse steal to drop live grenades into people's inventory and watch them go boom! 
---
This. Requires 1 plastic, 1 glass, and 3 rubber to make. Make a bunch, go around and sell them. 
---
Adam? or ATOM?
---
Sometimes I accentually drop my weapons (actually ended up loosing my mutant Fatman). Now I usually check my inventory before leaving a server. I have found bags where I was just looking through my inventory and saw one of my weapons on the ground.
---
Awesome ty
---
If it's a legendary, I try to search it before it falls. Sometimes it works, other times not.
---
Ah cool glad to hear it
---
It couldn‚Äôt see much at the time, but they looked naked with a sledge. 
---
Gutsy is one of the few things I can't run at like a madman. Something the game needs in my opinion. Yes the lttle audio compared to the big damage might surprise you at first. However shooting the thruster will destroy him pretty easy. Yes this isn't the easiest shot. Vats can help an you should try it if you haven't.
---
He hits hard but I feel that combined with the "skillshot" it takes makes it a satisfying high risk high reward going for that precise shot.
---
Can you craft me a helmet please? :X
---
Lolz 
---
Just yours. 
---
well, the biggest problem for me is that if I relog, my artillery won't work anymore.
---
Yes please.
---
Haha that‚Äôs kinda my point.  What are we random redditors supposed to do to fix this problem for you?  Try texting Bethesda- sounds like that‚Äôs your best option :)
---
Boi bye. 
---
yep
---
I didn't know that there were plan only mods. That's very confusing since it's completely left out of the in game explanations. 
---
Couldn't be naked in a nuke zone, especially not while running bloodied. Too many rads. Must have been glitched.  They'd either be in PA or a hazmat suit. 
---
The goal is to get you to fight back and then cap you, sometimes don't with stronger teammates in the immediate vicinity who can drop you from a distance or wreck you up close because you didn't realize they were hostile too. 
---
No i didnt drop it i would check every time im about to get off and i spent 1000 atomic points and caps on it
---
Because salt adds flavor.
---
I done did
---
a damage of the mininuke is about double of the damage of regular grenade... but 1 nuke is around 5kg... fatman just a junk.

It's a raider based trap, so I'd guess the ski lodge where they have a vendor. Sunny top? Not at home can't check right n oh w

Have you heard the good word of our Lord and Savior Adam?
---
I had this happen too.
---
Seems like they despawn a lot more easily in this current patch (I skipped patch 5).
---
I even had one despawn practically in front of me, I think because I killed the enemy in between me and the bag, instinctively looted him, and the bag was gone, the marker still floating in the void that was my paper bag.
---
What system?
---
This post made by *PING* gang.
---
Yeah. I usually don‚Äôt engage. Oh well. A good reminder to stash more often. 
---
No, trust me! I just want you in my camp so we can trade, im not trying to grief you. Trust me. 
---
I just want to suppress my auto plasma pistol...
---
I have noticed that this sub has become a salt mine at times. Though there are the few good posts. Just not very often. 
---
if you know the system and you know what you are missing, it's just a matter of scrapping enough items and eventually you will get it.  
---
So no, seeing it would not only at least let me know it's even a possibility, but if it's like the fo4 system you can actually see the effect and description so you can decide if scrapping another 500 10mm pistols or whatever makes sense for the missing mod.
---
I added you to friends and was playing but the toddler started up and had to jump off
---
There is another variable. I am not sure what it is but I know there is one because I don't see the generation rate on mine.
---
I have 4 Industrial purifiers. At 60/hour I should fill up all 4 (5 each) in 20 minutes. Most of the time it takes well over an hour to fill them.
---
 We need Radaway and Healing Syringer ammunition.  Just take their mutations away, if the don't have Starched Genes slotted. ;)
---
Bethesda.. just let the guy keep playing your shit game already.. I mean, come on.
---
Arn't workshops PVP zones?
---
I had something like that happen last week as well. It would be cool to get something from Bethesda telling us if this is working as intended more or less so we can plan for it. I would take much more care if I know it could all be gone forever. Seems inconsistent tho or maybe it just doesn‚Äôt happen enough. (The scenario I mean)

---
thanks for catching that. When I typed this up I would just copy and paste the previous header, so i'll need to figure out which vendor that was supposed to be
---
That's the joke, he is an idiot.
---
Well my character is an explosive build and with a two shot it's pretty quick and easy.
---
Just wanted to say much respect my man.  As someone whose had to deal with some depression in the past I can appreciate looking for some escape in a game. 
---
And I totally agree, of all the games I have played, I feel like FO76 has the most potential of any of them to be something I still want to play a year from now.  I was down on the game at launch, but it feels a lot better now than it did then.  
---
Keep pushing forward, see you in Appalachia!
---
Agreed with the lab door part, no way to avoid danger unless you kill fast. For stealth melee, I usually move away from the enemies I killed as soon as possible because the alerted enemies will likely move to where the kill happened. Don't kill those enemies walking towards the corpse (it will most likely expose you), aim for the further ones then comeback for them later.
---
Awesomeness
---
Saw my first yesterday.  Everything goes a really ominous green with cool cloud effects to match.
---
Bowie knife one hit before it finishes its spiel, loot junk and no Prize Cert to drop.
---
No, i have been using chameleon since fo76 released. I found my first piece from a grafton tar thingy beast when I was lvl 10.
---
I mastered the arts of chameleon sniping. First off, chameleon throws you off the radar when you crouch. Plus crouching puts you off the map. 
---
So, as I took distance from him, I kept running straight ahead. The whole point of running was to throw him off. There was a little cliff, i went around it and crouched. This created a small blind spot for him, and he trying to chase me down thought I was still running ahead. 
---
This dude was no sweat, as I can pull off 1v4s easily. This guy was no match for me. Hence, I took my time to drop him his beer bottle while he was seeking revenge.
---
Haven't had any issues with them. Just wish we could stack the columns
---
Funny the first 100 times
---
Very frustrating, indeed.....
---
Hahahaha that would be savage.
---
Imagine " The true wastelander mode" Fucking brilliant!
---
Don‚Äôt forget the Holorifle, part level action rifle part...holorifle
---
One dev accidentally adds too 0's to the exclusion zone and you now can't build anywhere on the map anymore?
---
Bethesda reads this thread. Those posts and up votes are meant to get their attention.
---
Hope you get better soon :)
---
 I¬¥m new to the game  (got the game yesterday) lvl 5 atm, so those tips and tricks will come in handy 
---
Basics to perk cards is simple. Just concentrate on the cards that directly impact your primary weapon and whether or not VATS is important to you. 
---
Melee is all about Strength. That‚Äôs my primary build. Shotgun builds use the shotgun perks, obv, but it also depends if you‚Äôre using explosives or not. Also, solo or team?
---
I change my specs several times each play session. Usually because of weight but also because of where I am on the map. But I‚Äôm still a total n00b, even though I‚Äôm Level 140. In FO4, I was strictly range. In 76, I‚Äôm 95% melee, 3% Explosive, and 2% range. 
---
No there‚Äôs no way around it. No need to be at whitesprings at level 13 either, go back to the forest. 
---
Where abouts are the shotgun perks. I'm on my new character and dont wanna switch just to look at my perks. Is it perception?
---
I like the idea of the aggrieved party being able to add to the bounty of the wanted player, from their caps of course. Similar to offering a bounty in the old west.  
---
When the wanted player is dispatched, his wanted level (minus any added on caps from the aggrieved parties) comes out of his caps and all of the added on Caps are divvied up between the successful bounty hunter and his team, if he has one. 
---
 LOL. I run with a pistol for the 20% Speed, and the Western Revolver seldom misses, and I don't use VATS. ;)
---
Wow I guess this guy really likrs fisting!
---
This
---
I‚Äôll bring down every piece of wall/floor/crafting etc...all of it.  Don‚Äôt go soft on em with just generators/guns.  Worth the 300c bounty 
---
What is the color of night?
---
Also please don't make launching nukes the one and only way to spawn raids.  
---
It's kind of tiresome.
---
this is why most of the time I'm afraid to interact with anyone in game. I want to be nice and help out new players but I also don't want to get my ass kicked. 
---
Yes, Perception. 
---
And Strength for some reason 
---
Happens All the time
---
You have to claim workshops and defend them to unlock camp plans that‚Äôs how I got mine but they take up a lot of budget to put down and make sure you have home defense 2 or 3 because it‚Äôs required to place the trap
---
Like a real food vendor?  
---
For the asshats legitimizing their behavior by branding it RP.
---
in an unstable and undeveloped country, mob mentality rules.
---
The games current ingame justice system suck and I want folks to know there are consequences 
---
For your actions, real or virtual 
---
Not really when you consider all the ‚Äúnew‚Äù assets have very limited and/or broken mods. The stuff they ported from FO4 they just tweaked a bit. New shit (50cal, blackpowder, 10mm SMG, single-action revolver, even tweaked stuff like Ultracite laser) have very basic mods. The 10mm SMG has the most of the bunch, actually! 
---
But there are better ways to get Bethesda‚Äôs attention then 20 posts saying the same thing. Just a shame to see someone‚Äôs hard work to help people out get buried because people are unhappy with a game. 
---
No problem, thanks for compiling all that. One of them is the ski lodge, not sure which one you went to first. My guess is the one with the raider PA is the lodge
---
Schorchbeast a patch or two back.  Perception high enough to see you Stealthed III, in a bunker, halfway across the map.  Constant staggering breath weapon.  Sucks down all your ammo and breaks all your weapons to kill.  Loot: 3 pieces of common junk and a barbed cane plan.
---
You can also get the plan from fort defiant in the workshop on the 4th floor or at camp venture just sitting on the shelves I‚Äôve found a few copies at both location. Also at camp venture I‚Äôve found marine ultra light plans as well and robot shadowed plans
---
100%.  Every stick.
---
This is solid advice.
---
I've seen it in PvP too. Far too fast and too much healing to be stimpak spamming. 
---
 Sure its fun. Don't listen to the fuddy duddies. What can happen? ;)
---
 I was there at quite low levels in a Hazmat suit and as I was helpless, trolled Ghouls onto security. Great fun and profitable too. ;)
---
Pleasant valley ski resort. Thank you prima games.
---
The t60 Power armor paint? On what shelf? I thought you couldn‚Äôt get it other than doing  the quest  forbidden knowledge.???
---
Ah, i was emphasizing on Charisma for a while, but realized I was still limited by the vendor limits. Thanks for that advice!
---
Good to know that. I thought you had to do data turn ins to get it.
---
I miss Fisto from NV...
---
Hypothetical - I grief a player, get a bounty for say 50 caps, the player then offers a 500 cap bounty on top of this.
---
I let my friend kill me and we split the additional 500 cap bounty two ways.
---
Love the idea of an additional bounty, but with the current system it wouldn't work.
---
Thank you for sharing this! I saved that vendor map for future reference. Found myself sometimes spending time and caps just to realize Id visited the same vendor faction
---
PA is almost meaningless against melee. Incisor offers 75% amor ignorance, and that's on top of whatever benefit the weapon's mods grant.  It's possible to have nearly all of your DR ignored by a non-legendary melee weapon. If it's AA and they have rank 3 Incisor, your PA  means squat.
---
What about Top of the World? I‚Äôm just doing the main quest and it led me there
---
20 post's saying the same thing means there is a problem. If nobody says anything it won't get fixed. The more posts on an issue the chance of it being addressed is better.
---
Nope look around in every building in camp venture and you can find the marine ultra light limb leg and chest plan. T-60 BOS paint isn‚Äôt a exclusive event reward it‚Äôs just random drops. I‚Äôve spent hours in fort defiant so I promise you that the paint plan spawns there next time I find one I‚Äôll screenshot and post so you know. I usually find the paint plan on the console between the two power armor stations
---
Nope. I am fairly certain that SS Bottling never made Nuka bottles for target. 
---
Nor was Nuka Dark ever advertised as a companion product to the target bottles. 
---
Those would simply be assumptions by consumers. 
---
So once again, unless you can source something, Nuka Dark was never advertised as having a custom Nuka shaped glass bottle. 
---
I think they should make everyone start new characters and have no legendaries in the the game. Then it‚Äôs a level playing field 
---
Do some side quests first I don‚Äôt recommend til at least level 20. 
---
Voice chat exist. Great way too find out if they have anything, or if they have to go find a stash box to pull it out.
---
Id avoid trading with lower lvls they still valid crap, find a highish lvl 90+ they almost always have excess they'd be willing to part with for the right price. Once you do find someone who's a decent "vendor" send em a friend request. Pal around with them for a while, meet who they play with and network a little. Once you have a nice network set up you can find almost anything your looking for.
---
Could also make use of the many fallout trading subreddits. I've made some lasting connections thru those
---
Here‚Äôs the God‚Äôs honest truth: Whitesprings levels to the players, BUT the #1 way to piss off a lobby is to make Whitesprings convert to low levels. When I show up there (I‚Äôm Level 140) and I see level 9-22 ghouls, I get immediately annoyed and server hop. 
---
The reason you‚Äôre seeing high leveled enemies is because players of those levels where there before you were. And the game hasn‚Äôt fully adjusted to the difference. 
---
The absolute WORST thing a lower level player can do is build their CAMP on Whitesprings golf course, near the clubhouse. Bonus points for complete DB‚Äôness is adding turrets that shoot through clubhouse windows. 
---
I don‚Äôt pvp not grief UNLESS turrets are shooting into clubhouse. I will destroy those turrets every time I see them. 
---
Awesome thanks! Any idea where some possible locations for those items might be?
---
I wish. I‚Äôm console peasant race. (Xbox one x)
---
Maybe a guides section. Like r/fo76/guides would be a good idea.
---
Enforcer is under agility too.  Very helpful for getting scorch beasts to land.
---
Thanks! I was mostly just trying to do the main quest line which led me near there, so I thought I would explore and then I just got wrecked. 
---
Yes, you it even warns you that you are opting into pvp when you take one
---
I never thought about that! Swear ive been sitting on enough cloth material to make a sweater for every mob and player on the server. Never figured out a good use for it, so thanks!
---
If you'd watched the video, you'd understand. The Feb. 19th update made it so people can take over workshops from stealth, without any effort at all. Making it as such only encourages griefing, and discourages new players from using the workshops at all. What would be the point, if any higher level player can come along and take it over without any effort or consequence whatsoever? PVP shouldn't be forced on people who don't want it. Many gamers prefer cooperative play over PVP, and we shouldn't have suffer assholes who can't take no for an answer. There's enough of that in RL, yeah?
---
Watch the vid for a more thorough explantion. Skooled Zone makes excellent informative and helpful videos, and I am not affiliated, paid, or otherwise benefiting from sharing his vids. I just like to share good things, see? :-) 
---
It's kinda like doors with broken glass. You want good glass go to the Atom store.
---
Dang, I didn‚Äôt realize it was like that! I‚Äôll have to do some more random exploring and try and level up other ways, mostly just wanted to get through the main storyline before exploring to see if it was any good
---
I guess I don‚Äôt share that mentality. It just seems like their own forum would be a better place. 
---
 Really, so I have been doing it wrong? I am 72 years old so I may not understand, but I have fun there with my low levels.. 
---
Ugh, everything is counterable, even annoying ass stealthboys. (ive been hearing theres actually a perma stealth boy glitch).
---
Did you sell the combat rifle?
---
I believe ya! Thanks again for the heads up.
---
Theres another one too.  If you get a machete and add the cultist (I think?) Mod to it, it gains a star as well.  I have a 4 star Furious Machete thanks to this!
---
Not a problem always glad to help
---
Funny story: Despite Being Level 140, I haven‚Äôt come anywhere close to completing main story line. Haven‚Äôt joined Enclave or discovered about 1/3 of map. 
---
In FO4, I didn‚Äôt attempt to find Shaun until level 100+ after I was Overboss of Nuka World. Lol. 
---
To each is own. Have fun. 
---
Good point. The only downside is bulking items often requires plastic/acid too? Which is relatively rare to some degree.
---
Wish there was a way to scrap ammo though. Ive mountains of it I cant move and dont use....
---
Destiny
---
That would be a good idea. I just hate seeing good posts get buried by the saltiness of players complaining about stuff. Acting like this sub represents the whole player base and what they want. And don‚Äôt take that the wrong way. There are good ideas and such on this sub. 
---
Best to stick to the Forest until Level ~20 or so. Any major locale that attracts regular visits from high level characters (esp Whitespring) is gonna get you wreckity-wreckity-wrecked until you're able to roll with the big boys. 
---
That being said if you keep your head about you, you should be able to visit the hotel and shops if you gingerly walk over there from the train station and let the security team take out any less than savory characters. But I'd avoid the clubhouse and the grounds proper until you're able to handle a horde of level 62 charred ghouls and maybe a rogue Wendigo chewing on your ankles. 
---
I‚Äôm fine with this for Atom store.
---
Ahhhh good point
---
Oh, that's a great idea. I love the way things change during a rad storm.
---
Sounds like perfect bait, lol. 
---
i was at whitespring at level 7 putting in that work
---
I don‚Äôt know about game code, but I did ingame comparison testing with a Zealots hunting rifle vs a normal hunting rifle (identical mods) against a scorchbeast, the Zealots was clearly doing more damage. I‚Äôve no reason to believe the queen is different from the normals in this respect. 
---
I‚Äôd suspected it for a while (I Primed a Zealots 50cal a while back and it fucking *melts* SB) but I hadn‚Äôt done solid comparison testing ingame until I found the hunting rifle. 
---
Using an Executioner's fat man on the scorched Queen, with full explosive perk and stabilized, and having first hit her with a syringer dart to lower her damage resistance ... I put over 50 nukes into her and barely made a scratch. Base damage was over 750 and she was below 40% health so it should have been over a thousand damage per shot.
---
So as it stands right now? Totally not worth carrying the weapon and ammo.
---
OK.. They banned your main and your alt for duping.. Why for the love of all that is holy would you come on here and publicly announce you got another account . Damn. 
---
I hope everything in your real life works out for you,  and I don't think it's right for people to threaten you..  But honestly the more elaborate this story becomes the more it seems like a fabrication to garner sympathy. I feel like with all the press this has gotten Bethesda has certainly looked into your case with a microscope and have not found any reason to unban you. 
---
Sometimes you learn by hardcore full blown immersion. 
---
Wait until there‚Äôs a blast zone, then get to it as fast as you can and join Scorched Earth event. Nothing like trying to kill a Scorchbeast Queen with a machete, pipe pistol, and vault 76 jumpsuit. Good luck. You‚Äôll need it. But you‚Äôll have a ball. :-)
---
I can‚Äôt say hunters doesn‚Äôt work on them, I haven‚Äôt tested that, but Zealots definitely works on SB, and presumably the queen as well. 
---
I got to like level 40 on PS4 before from just wandering around, so once I got it on Xbox I figured I would see how the story plays. I‚Äôm enjoying the game so far but it can be ruthless at times. Maybe I‚Äôll take a break and level up a bit.!
---
Lost legendary stuff this way.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I seem to see your comments all the time since browsing here... extremely active community manager I love it XD
---
Good advice. I hadn‚Äôt considered the level ranges of each area since I was just going along with the quest lines!
---
Totally random, but isnt graham technically the only non-robot, non hostile, npc left alive?
---
which melee weapon do u plan on using..because u can max 1 or 2-handed or both at same time
---
The queen is probably one of the few enemies I‚Äôd say bringing an Executioner‚Äôs secondary weapon may be worth it on. Get her down to 50% with a Zealot‚Äôs, switch to an Executioner‚Äôs for the last third of the fight 
---
Any idea where I can get some deep pockets combat armor chest piece plane and trapper arms? 
---
Haha that would be funny as hell!
---
Thanks thats some real useful advice. I never really participated in events, not sure why, but will definately give it a shot tonight!
---
I got deep pocketed chest piece mod from Census Violence.
---
You can buy them from the Enclave vendor, including the mk 3 version that lasts 3 times longer. Save your caps, though. Mk3 costs like 175 if you have maxed charisma/hard bargain
---
Going to try out Uranium fever tonight! Always felt like it was a higher level event though?
---
One run of the golf course gets me more than enough junk to fully repair my camp/turrets.
---
My gf tried to snipe a mothman only for it to disappear then reappear directly in front of her. She screamed and dropped the headset and walked away from the PC rofl
---
There's artillery in this game?
---
yeah and the crossbow in the game is just horrible..cmon beth..i know u want to distinctly differentiate between the 2 games but i could only imagine how sick it would be if we had a bow
---
Oh really? Ok thanks! But dang your right that‚Äôs expensive.. and my only character I‚Äôm gonna max charisma on is still only level 8. Guess I‚Äôll have to try and find where they spawn more often 
---
It‚Äôs ballistic damage, ammo is considered energy, and the gun is considered energy both in crafting and by the Grounded mutation.
---
It‚Äôs wonky. 
---
Yao Guai still is the one that makes me die the hardest. Mole miners when they stop shooting and start punching are second worse. But the wendigo by far is the one who got me the most jump scarces so far. Though I've gotten quite the expect wendigo hunter.
---
Exploding pants!
---
That legendary vendor is coming out soon. I've a feeling that improving a certain legendary weapon the way you want will at least be to some degree easier that way. Finger's crossed.   
---
New weapons coming is inevitable, though you can always count on some one else finding something that you want at the least. Trade's always an option.  
---
Hop servers 
---
Yeah give me things from 9 years ago because obviously moving forward or being progressive is way to much to ask for.
---
That's my fault. I had multiple tabs open and didn't realize I wasn't in the bazaar.
---
As a dad I'll tell you, take a glance at a few of the missions to make sure they fit your schedule.  There's a BoS quest and IIRC a Responders quest that you have to run the whole thing or start over, and they are long ones.  Tough to fit in an hour or so on a weeknight, etc.
---
&gt; I bought a new account on Monday. I'm writing up new character tips and trick as I go. I'm currently level 56.
---
level 56 in two days? impressive
---
I always figured this was already in the works. Much like Rockstars Social Club/iFruit app for GTA.  
---
In FO4, the Pip-Boy app was pretty cool. It could be much more involved in FO76, but I‚Äôm sure they already have their hands full with this game. 
---
On a side note, I got tired of Fallout Shelter after about 7 minutes and deleted it from my iPhone. 
---
I fall into the ‚Äúfool me twice‚Äù with assaultron head category. 
---
Dang it I wanted to see but it was removed 
---
Sure, this isn't a hard issue to grasp. The issue is you don't want any consequences when you die. 
---
I haven‚Äôt tested the armor, and it‚Äôs not easy to test weapons on the queen due to her vast health pool, but I have tested Zealot weapons against regular scorchbeast, They definitely work against the beasts, not just Scorched other creatures. 
---
One and 2 handed I switch between em
---
Is this a bad idea
---
Hey i do this to run my shop and i dont think its inherently bad its just a really good farming strat that you should do as well. I know this is an unpopular oppinion but if you go to whitesprings often enough this can not only save a lot of caps but also helps the fallout economy in general by supplying more legendaries. Also, people that have their bases there generally have it for a while then move due to the atrocious amount of budget the turrets use up. While i do think it can be an annoyance it is a good strat that maybe you should try. Dont want to start an online arguement but i think this is just as valid a base location as any and it doesnt prevent people from doing quests either. But thats just what i think. Please respond and let me know how you feel about what i said, thanksüëä!
---
*than
---
r/anthem is going to shit everyday. r/fo76 was insufferable for most of the time , now that patch 6 and roadmap been released the sub has been pretty good. But r/anthem is nowhere near the shit quality that is r/destiny and r/wow
---
I didn't want to go there... but I'm down. &gt;:)
---
See if Eve knows.
---
I love those missile turrets, wish I could have 10 :) But they too expensive. Normally I will keep 1 heavy for a warning system. Someone mentioned a spotlight is a good warning system and using a fraction of a turret budget, maybe that's better to have than an actual turrets. My 1 heavy does deal with most smaller enemies. If I had extra room, I would prefer a missile turret, love the sound of those going off non stop.
---
Do you know what glitches and exploits even are? 
---
Doing UNINTENDED stuff in game. That‚Äôs what differentiates from *cheating*, which is using 3rd party tools to change what you can do in game. 
---
You mean to tell me that they intended you to to be able to use a fire pit to place foundations in the sky?
---
Just to be clear, I don‚Äôt think they plan to ban anyone for it, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they patched it. 
---
But it‚Äôs absolutely a glitch/exploit. 
---
It's babysitting wasting money on reddit when you could just go to official forums. Got to give 76 a 10/10 since you love LARPing a beta tester so much, why would they release a more stable product.
---
I like it, it's like a toned down version of a nuke zone
---
Hell yeah let's do it. Always wanted to dual wield a couple of fat man's.
---
Jokes aside. Double swords or knifes would make sense 
---
Anti-Material Rifle üòç
---
ok so theres 3 perk cards each..so 18 points total..but additional melee cards too
---
Get used to using vats if you aren't already, even in melee a vats crit will ignore the damage reduction on their legendary armor. In PvP the answer isn't always hitting harder as op said players are squishy af, it's more about play styles and counters imo than just stacking damage like you do for SBQ
---
The same goes with turrets anywhere though, right? So wouldnt you have to avoid other popular base locations like near the whitesprings bunker and around the scorchbeast queen spawn? Sounds kind of silly to blame a base mechanic for you not getting as much loot.
---
I'd like to remind you that 76 is a game and not the actual wasteland.  In an actual wasteland, there's real stakes when two armed men agree to a trade of goods.  I don't think it's like the movies where someone's going to try scamming someone else, because both parties know they'll wind up dead, or even worse wounded and meet a much more horrible end due to pain, infection and eventual sepsis.
---
Not everyone can though
---
I just want my plasma flamethrower to heal my teammates while friendly fire perk is equipped :(
---
Also Plasma Rifle Sniper Suppressor.  If the Gauss Rifle can be suppressed I don't see why the Plasma Rifle can't be?  Unless it lacks the mod spot similarly to how a lever action can't receive a magazine mod so no Armor Piercing magazine.
---
Just thought of something, I kind of was doing this anyhow. Build a camp settlement/house whatever that is somewhat complex. Take a blueprint, can be a empty house, place as many of these down after you done your setup and use of all remaining budget. If someone takes it from you, a) they won't have budget left and will have dismantle a budget of extra houses which takes time b) they going to have to pay extra caps, the more. you have at a workshop built, the more it costs to take over. I like point a) I am going to slap down 4 houses so they waste time dismantling it ..
---
I feel like there's already plenty of games you could play that offer that system.
---
Swampy areas, the mire
---
Yeah it would help a lot.
---
But maybe make it so it's useful on alts and not so on mules, like increase size per level or something like that.
---
Is there no resolve to this?, i also hace this problem 2700x and a 1070. ... wtfff
---
So a supped up...  Uh...  Broadsider I think it's called?  That adds limb damage when fired (like how assaultron head adds rad damage when fired)?
---
I learned about not getting into someone's white van at age 4-5.  All you have to do is apply that lesson and skepticism when anything seems too good to be true, and you'll be ok throughout your life.
---
If only the Fallout universe had some sort of enemey type that could wear power armor amd have it make sense. We could call them Raiders or something
---
I play on PC, sorry.
---
Yea sorta. But broadsider is trash sadly.
---
\^this
---
I saw that! Didn't realize it was you. Pretty impressive. I like when people are able to build the camp around the land in unique ways. I also like how you left parts of it open. I do the same with mine.
---
Little moon fish I would love to join! 
---
I like this idea! Would be sweet if BD created a daily or quest (similar to nukes) that would generate a wicked radioactive storm that spawned the glowing ones. A radioactive farming storm! Heck yea! 
---
Nice one @gegroff
---
That's a good in depth article, covers the major points, and while you admit your excitement for the game, and that you are playing it....it does not read like a fanboy article....minus the part about telling us to give Todd Howard a break :) (That said, I agree with you...we take video game development for granted)  
---
The only other thought I had was.....is this an update to a previously written review?  Or is it a new review of the current state of the game?  If this is an update to a previous article maybe link back to the old one so the reader can follow your "journey" writing about the game....but that is me being nitpicky.  Good job!
---
I just want my weapons to not break as fast Damn lol. As a level 36, my super sledge breaks really rapidly.
---
Ive always found a few near top of the world.
---
This videos premise is so stupid. He defeats his own argument/premise in the first minute. 
---
1)I was going to make a video showing how you can use unintended tactics to make the workbenches inaccessible so nobody can contest it
---
2)bethesda made it so you can contest it without touching the workbenches so nobody can cheese defend their workshop
---
Hiding the workbench is a dumb tactic to avoid defending your workshop which is why they implemented this. When you go to take a workshop it warns you that you are opting into pvp
---
I want a stimpack shooting syringer to heal my teammates with.
---
3 technically. Im australian, im a day ahead of america
---
How many hours have you played? I'm almost 300 hours, and have yet to get an explosive weapon. Three two-shot weapons, but no explosives.
---
If you dont want to risk pvp then dont take workshops. They're optional and if you really want you can go to a new server and take it again
---
You can play 76 BF4 style. Or like Dead By Daylight. Any game mode really; don't over simplify it.
---
In game chat won't help you all but need forums / streams.
---
I have a trapper arms I can get you on ps4 if you want.  Otherwise it spawns in a tent with a random encounter.
---
Ahaha active and being obsessive over all things Fallout helps! Thanks :)
---
I love this, Great Idea!
---
where did u farm xp
---
Where was this?
---
Yes I do sorry for the late reply 
---
 You carry the fate of us all, little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done. 
---
Take off your weapon and re-equipt it. Should fix it. 
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily players doing the damage; quite possible it‚Äôs enemies.

I recently picked up a Gamma Guns that does extra damage to ghouls, might be the ultimate weapon for this.
---
Dolly Sods gets them a bit.
---
Which platform?
---
And people defending him saying how easy it is to make all that ammo and earn it from trades. I've suggested they start a new account and stream all of their game play to show you could easily get that amount that fast. They seem to get pretty indignant saying they don't have to prove anything.
---
Ill be on in about an hour if you still need some help. Psn: MadDogTannen711
---
The mistress of mysteries is pretty fun if you haven‚Äôt already done it. It‚Äôll net you some decent loot and experience and it overlaps the raiders a bit too. Plus the weapons you get can be re-crafted at higher levels, so they don‚Äôt get outdated. 
---
I totally agree. One thing I love with gun games is, you know, guns. My BIGGEST criticism is in FO4 they made the crafting system, but used it as an excuse to cut guns. Want a 10mm submachine gun? Why? You have the auto 10mm pistol! Want a plasma rifle? Just add a barrel to the plasma/pistol (even though this meant there‚Äôs literally 1 plasma weapon and 2 laser weapons). The problem is Bethesda thinks ‚Äúwell 10mm, close range auto weapon is already fulfilled. No need for that!‚Äù But they should learn from FPS‚Äôs like Battlefield. Just because the slot is filled doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt add more than one weapon to fit that slot. The more the merrier I say. Variety adds to play style, role play, builds, and choice. 
---
Granted they did a slightly better job with FO76 there are still weak points.  I‚Äôm looking at you 3 shotguns with an obvious winner of those 3. I‚Äôm looking at you only 1 viable semi-auto pistol, and you .308 shooting heavy gun that you hold like a auto rifle but isn‚Äôt and consumes so much ammo vs DMG that you can waste days of ammo farming in mere seconds. 
---
Also before implementing new weapons, fix the legendary RNG. I like the new vendor coming, but maybe have better drops come slightly more often as opposed to once a month? 
---
It could definitely be a bug, or some clipping issue, but I have found that for me, oftentimes, when I think a body just up and disappeared on me, what happened is that the body turned into a meat like at its location upon death, not where the body ragdolled to.  Happened today with the Grafton monster and yesterday with the scorchbeast queen, and both times I ran around where it looked like they actually died and there was a little meat pile. It may not work for you, but something to try just in case :)
---
Make sure you block and report him so he will never see your camp location again. I run into too many twits with death claws trying to kill me for no reason, last time I just ran in circles until he got bored and moved on. Or you can build a bunker out of concrete foundations and he won't be able to do any damage to it :)
---
Might have to delete and reinstall the game.
---
I don't understand why Bethesda is taking an all or nothing approach here.  If you cause damage once to an object you get a pass...more than once it isn't an accident.  I hope we see this patched.
---
People who doesn't support this has access to 2 account and taking full advantage of it 
---
That's a great idea.  Maybe Mr 900 will do the honors to vindicate himself and prove us skeptics wrong.  
---
What mutations are you managing with class freak? 
---
Clowns that's why
---
Ok, then as a Welshman, I look forward to fucking (up) this Super Sheep...
---
Oh my God people whine about this so much. 
---
Haven‚Äôt done those missions but I‚Äôll join as soon as I can get the tv free. Maybe half hour. Psn sneazel 
---
Just make a note in the invite
---
That's what Dayz is. 
---
Has the frequency of rad storms dropped severely or is it just me? I remember they used to happen now and again when I first started playing, but I have only been in one for the past 6-7 weeks and I play almost daily.
---
Sorry, didn't mean to hijack your post. I agree that more rad storms that spawned glowing  would be a welcome addition.
---
It really seems to defeat the point of that mode entirely if you can move characters back and forth. At best it should be a one time move either way. 
---
I've camped at the complete south end of the golf course and still had people completely trash my camp. 
---
It could of been intended, who are you to say it wasn't, there isn't help guide and a guideline of any sort to say what should or what you can or cannot do. How about that guy who builds circular buildings in camps, it wasn't intended but he figured out a way to make a round building, so is this a exploit as well, give me a break .. even though I agree, you don't know if it was intended or not, it's that simple. Besides it was allowed in FO4, so why not here. Only reason for it was a decision so people don't get trapped in camps, else we would totally be allowed to build like FO4.
---
game has its issues, but it didn't faze me.  i still enjoyed it.  their dropping new content so thats a good thing.
---
Wow we got a hard ass here. 
---
Same reason on GTA a level 50 will attack me and my 350 account. They are either stupid or over confident.  Either way I get in my MOC cab and just rag doll them for a half hour.
---
Almost every vendor seems to have 1-3 blood packs. If you have chemist and super duper you can create anywhere from 4-8 diluted stims per blood pack.
---
Also, take random workshops and complete the first defense event. You'll typically get 2-4 regular stimpacks as a reward, which is another 8-16 (or more) diluted stims.
---
Boredom probably. Nothing new to do late game
---
hahaha, Ya, I hear what you are saying. I tried but couldn't figure out how to make buffout syringer ammo (like what fo4 has), so I did the next best thing that I could think of.    --I can't wait for the future patches/DLCs 
---
Errant shot or glitch. Just log off and back on. Perfect after that.
---
The mothman when its AI is working correctly
---
Great! I'll start working on something. Send me your gamer tag shoo I can keep you updated!
---
Yeah but then it costs you ammo
---
Same, I tried restarting a new character but I've invested so much time I really don't want too plus Im trying to respec to a Charisma build so I need levels on things to even tame them. - Is level 118. Really wish we could just buy a respec chem or something
---
Marine armor is a jack of all trades set. Heavy Combat armor is equal to it but the stats are split differently
---
Basically heavy combat and marine have the same stats but marine splits it between physical, energy and radiation. While combat armor splits it between just physical an energy.
---
The Gauss Sight is inaccurate while charged up, the reticule dips down a little bit away from its actual aim, didn't know the iron sight had a similar issue with being accurate.
---
Better than gold, that stuff is nearly worthless in comparison 
---
PC
---
That's crazy.  Clowns would never do that.  Everyone should feel safe enough to carry around their junk with clowns.  Let's explore the sewers north of watoga.
---
More invention guns like the railway rifle? Sounds good to me!
---
Ah, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve had corn and razorgrain in my stash forever. I never put it together that I had planted way too much and ended up scrapping a bunch of it. Then I wondered why the new razorgrain I put in there went bad. Good info. 
---
This is so great. This is what this is platform should be for. Nice work!
---
I did not say the "purge" took it all away ..I said these obviously survived it ? I understand that they are still out there HENCE why I said what I said .. My bad, I must have missed the part where it said stay exactly on topic. And for your high and mighty info, People are still Killing people outside of work shop ownership ... And I just wanted to point out the ludicrousness of a lvl 55 killing a lvl 155 .. I know its gonna happen, I'm and saying in IMO it should not be that easy .. and will continue to call it out as ridiculous. .. But hey you know it all, And Know it all well enough to come at me as if I don't ..soo all that and a bag of chips and you got what ? a bag of chips ? Kudos to you
---
Pics plz
---
Now I can‚Äôt wait to get my smell-o-vision!
---
Guaranteed spawn at Tanagra Town
---
Good way to kill an area's frame rate from all the smoke effects so not sure this'll be a thing.
---
Drives me crazy you can‚Äôt seem to get deep pocket metal anymore. Even been buying up treasure maps just to try. 
---
When i get home
---
No bipod.
---
Exactly

Bird bones, carnivore, chameleon, electrically charged, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon
---
None of my friends play so I'd love a way to swap stuff between alts. 
---
Racetacocat or something like that? He's a shit head with another friend of his that goes around griefing players. Encountered them before. Can't remember what's his friends name though. 
---
I like the idea. Are you using an elevated ramp leading to a concrete pit? You could bait it with a paper bag with 1 fertilizer. Maybe a decoy power armor frame. Maybe you can tame a pet and trap him in a concrete bunker nearby, just in case there are no molerats around.
---
I was just there and got a mega sloth
---
Melee Launcher of Puncturing Power Fists.  Tomahawk Homing Launcher.  Fire Axe Catapult Launcher aka "Here's Johnny!".
---
I'd fear you.
---
They both spawn, at least almost always. I‚Äôve never been there and not seen both
---
I wouldn't mind a few new pistols, for sure.  As far as I can tell, the only two options for a guerrilla build are the 10mm auto and auto pipe pistols.  The Mauser type Chinese pistol would be a nice addition, as there are real life full auto variants with a 20r mag capacity.  Perhaps the "grease gun" type smg could also fit into this category.
---
The .45acp colt service pistol would be a welcome addition for Gunslinger builds.  10mm pistols are crazy weak and revolvers are pretty slow and middling on damage.  You'd think they'd at least rival the DPS of a semi-auto assault or combat rifle.  The 5.56 pistol "that gun" would be really, really great to see.  I feel like it's universally beloved.
---
I feel like the "lever action rifle" in game is basically the same as the "brush gun" from NV.  The other options are just less powerful variants.  I think it would just water down the loot pool.  Between the hunting rifle, lever action, gauss, handmade and combat rifles, I feel like there's a good selection that exists.  I wouldn't want to further water down the loot pool with less powerful variants of existing options.  I wouldn't mind a return of the laser musket, so long as the damage was somewhere in line with the gauss.
---
The Bozar would be a great addition to the heavy guns list.
---
I feel like the list of shotguns is relatively fine, but I would like to see the pipe shotgun (Fo4 creation club) reintroduced.  Yes, it's functionally identical to the double barrel, but it could possibly be tweaked to have mods for a revolving 6 shot receiver, or triple/quad barrel option.  Plus, it looks really, really "wasteland".
---
Again, I'd be down with new weapons that serve a purpose and would be desirable as options within the existing in-game weapons.  What I don't want is for the legendary loot pool to be watered down even further with a slew of under-performing, not really needed weapons that exist simply for the sake of variety.
---
I decoy it with the only entry door leading to a floor wich i then remove as they drop into the prison c.a.m.p
---
Yes, currently looking at spending 12 "levels" to do the following:
---
Reduce each Rifleman perk from 3 to 2 (aka buy them up to rank 2) = 6 levels  
---
Move 3 points from Perception to Luck = 3 levels  
---
Buy 3 ranks of Bloody Mess = 3 levels
---
They were not based on characters, but accounts. There was asymmetry between the the accounts numbers but that's perfectly explainable by moving more between chars on one account, than between two chars on different accounts.
---
The only reason I don't take workshops is because I play pve mainly and stay in pacifist and made the mistake of not switching out of it while I owned a workshop but I don't fault the person who killed me like everyone says you are literally opting into pvp when you take a workshop. People need to stop calling it griefing just cause they take your workshop. 
---
Would name my Plasma Thrower "Ghoul's Hell'.  My Suppressed Gauss "Zeus' Thunder" and my lever action "Cowpoke Shooter".
---
But I can't.  And I wish I could every time I go into a Modify/Repair screen.
---
Alright I‚Äôll have to check again, thanks. Doing the 160 atom challenge
---
Do you use vats?
---
Its players. Ive got the base under attack and once i check the map, sure enough someone with a bounty at my base. Ive even sat there while they destroyed it trying to get me to pvp. 
---
I get the attacks at the vendor fairly frequently at both Watoga vendors. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a new thing though, maybe a slight uptick a patch or two ago when they made the disconnect occurrences a little better.
---
I‚Äôm in the habit now of just sitting at a nearby bench when I notice someone approaching, and resuming when they finish.
---
If you want to try to loot that body, pop a stealth boy and make a beeline. Had it happen once also and had to do that to get my junk back
---
It‚Äôs definitely like scaring the witch in Left 4 Dead- except, I think, with no warning.
---
I was exploring today and saw a level 6 scorched in a garage, and was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go take him out.‚Äù Then I heard the scream and was like ‚Äúaww fuck‚Äù
---
Don't the size of camps shrink the taller that they get? So if you could build higher they could be closer together? I haven't tested this out though...
---
And lastly, metal armor is almost or exactly 100% ballistic defense. Being that energy weapons suck... Metal might be the best in most situations.
---
The limitation adds nothing to the game
---
Even of you hit a car with 1 bullet, and it later explodes (whether someone or something else made it explode), you will get attacked by the robots if one got damaged by the car
---
I've always felt that post apocalyptic combat lends to bows. Ammo isn't being made (or at least not in large quantities) but arrows can be hand crafted pretty easily. You can make them out of light weight metal too and they're silent. Just so many pros of a bow
---
Ammo
---
It's the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Somebody may try to take your shit, guyz. 
---
Yeah, that's the name!  After several attempts at trading with the vendor at Watoga and him attacking, I finally made the mistake of retaliating.  He then started yelling obscenities through his mic and followed me around killing me until I finally left the server.  I just don't understand why these assholes want to drive people away from the game.
---
Do NOT do that. You will buff the queen ridiculously and quite possibly make her impossible to kill thus pissing off the person who launched the nuke and the other actually capable high level players there 
---
DING DING DING, You are semi-correct
---
He‚Äôs right. I was being tongue in cheek. ;)
---
Can‚Äôt find it as it got lost in the bushes.  
---
There‚Äôs only one banjo. How is he supposed to duel?
---
I never understood why 4 and 76 just have your weapons disappear from your hands. Both 3 and new vegas had you put the gun on your back. It‚Äôs stupid that the newer games in a better version of the engine don‚Äôt have this
---
Yeah they are just immature shit heads. I'd just keep pacifist on. It's not worth fighting them unless you know you are up for it.
---
Psst if you are a rifle or sniper build, vats random mobs till your crit meter fills up. It ignores ass sent so whatever armor they are wearing is useless. I run a bloodied explosive build. Satisfying to see griefers die in one shot with their top tier gear. 
---
Sanguine, my brother
---
I'd like a scythe. 
---
I've been on both sides of that game, just not with that character. Some do a good job. High level bounty, 3 guys laying in wait in stealthboys/chameleon. Others are idiots and just walk around together making it obvious it's a trap. 
---
Best tactic is to not go alone, bank a crit, pop the wanted guy from a distance, from stealth, after scoping out the area for others.  Save the crit for whoever opens fire afterwards. 
---
Not with my heavy build
---
What if you want to use deep pocketed for both limbs? That would confuse things the most to me
---
YES!!! I don't know how many times I've had to drop "useful" scrap to pick up weapons I already maxed mods for.
---
Why was there so system like this from the get go?
---
Way 2 difficult in my opinion based on how the game works
---
If you're not using chems you could probably do without class freak during queen fights, allowing you to have one gun army and gun smith
---
Nah, just push the boundary where you can build a camp further back. It would be easier (and less likely to accidentally break something else) than seeing up zones where you can build your camp, but can't build certain camp objects. Would it really be so terrible to have to build your camp 50 ft further away?
---
They've already said that they will be adding a legendary character option, where you reset your character. Nobody knows how it will work yet though
---
Also bulk junk to sell, (do you really need 600 loose gears?), you‚Äôll make 1400 caps easily and clear up some valuable stash space.
---
On the contrary, don‚Äôt block him. I remember reading that [XB1] If you block someone- when you leave the server to join a new one it will put you back into the same server. [Dont know about other systems or a patch]
---
Will do!
---
I‚Äôll send an invite! Thanks
---
I appreciate the advise, but don't really understand what "vats random mobs till your crit meter fills up".  I'm level 98 but haven't messed with VATS at all, so I'll look into it.
---
What is wrong with you? 
---
Also why would a prize bot be carrying around grenades?
---
It has always been this way in Fallout games.  Expect the vendor to rob you like a pawn shop.
---

---
Now introducing the Paddle Ball Type 2.
---
Yea going back looking at it that would work, just got it in my head that I needed class freak to make sure I wasnt losing so much special stats
---
If you complete Rose's questline you get them as a potential reward. Not sure if it's guaranteed but I've gotten it every time I've done it.
---
Def not garunteed cuz I completed it
---
My best advice would be hide your camp very well.
---
I‚Äôve only had my camp destroyed once or twice in many many hours.
---
Secondly, perma sneak. When you sneak you don‚Äôt show up on the map. If you see somebody doesn‚Äôt move on the map for an extended period of time that‚Äôs probably their camp.
---
If you aren't using vats the only big down side you're going to notice most likely is reduced carry weight, which shouldn't be a big deal with the queen 
---
Lolw00t. Want some tea bro?
---
Two Paddle Balls in each hand!
---
Dont know location name but its inbetween welch and that big excavator. Its inside one the buildings in the trainyard.
---
As long as they just weren‚Äôt trying to attract your attention to a bag they‚Äôd dropped for you, it occurs to me now that‚Äôs what I do and I may have inadvertently offered people. Would also explain why people rarely look in the bag lol.
---
Basically when you use vats and land a successful hit, a crit meter fills up. When it fills up you can use space bar to activate it and the next shot you fire will be have a 100% chance to hit even if it says 7% and be a critical. It also negates all armor buffs like assassins sentinel.
---
Before I claim bounties, I try to find scorched or any random mobs and just vats hit them to fill up the meter. Fast travel to bounty, sneak, use vats from a distance, activate crit and fire. My BE lever does 1058 at 10% health so with the crit it does 2100. Not much can survive that unless they were fighting someone else and autostim kicks in. 
---
Ah.  Confirms my bias. There‚Äôs jerks on All the platforms but it seems like there are more on pc
---
You also get them from treasure maps in either the forest or toxic valley. I think it may be toxic valley, with savage divide being T-51 etc. 
---
This vendor has the Raider PA plans, but I've never seen plans for regular armor there.
---
I think someone needs to visit the area to get the event started. If nobody on the server does, than it won't just pop up as an event. 
---
I would like for the D pad to be customizable in general.  I keep accidentally using stim packs when I'm trying to switch weapons
---
Hey the SB's already do pee flybys, so why not.
---
Unless you're referring to fast travel costs, you aren't actually spending caps. You don't pay unless you actually move your CAMP, if it comes up red, then you don't pay anything.
---
Keep in mind unlike the stealth you get from armor, the PA version slowly drains AP but it's really slow. Also if you're a sniper or use sneak it's just as good as the armor version. I like using it :). Also you could consider trying multiple different torso's instead of overwriting them. Could store one to.
---
Again same for pc pissing me off,  ruining my shop....  
---
if you want to be in the habit of moving your camp around a lot, you are going to need to make it pretty small at its base. You do you, but moving it around a lot can get very expensive.
---
Yep that's definitely it, just updated it. thanks :)
---
Do you have a pink uniform?
---
Grafton Monster creeps me out from a ‚Äúeeeew‚Äù sort of way, not really a huge deal in combat, just a general uncomfortable feeling from the bodily shape...
---
This is the workshop to defend to level up quickly. Earned half a rank's worth of XP fighting four waves of cave crickets, including a two-star and a three-star legendary. (Naturally, as usual, no good loot drops.) 
---
Another strange note. In addition to not listing all the resources, the game didn't tell me what enemy was coming, which it normally does when you're about to defend a workshop. Not sure if these are oversights or if they designed Dolly Sods this way for those who like surprises.
---
OR MAYBE HE SHOULD JUST LOSE WEIGHT
---
Before 76, super mutants were meant to be immune to all disease. It‚Äôs one of the reasons the Master thought they were the superior race. 
---
As anyone could have guessed, the mobile gaming company that made 76 (Lol, true fact) doesn‚Äôt know Fallout lore. 
---
And best comment award goes to u/WhoptimusPrime
---
Everywhere. I've written a ton of notes while playing. The biggest few notes are farming for exp bursts. I'd spend a couple hours farming MIRV grenades for not great exp, more junk farming than exp. Then those grenades let me do full clears of max level whitesprings for big exp gains. 
---
Without grenades it's stupid slow to level up from farming mobs. 
---
Also do every event possible. 
---
I've seen several of them at Welch
---
Did they fix the dev cells with the codes in them?
---
I feel like a wikia page would be a better place to store all these spreadsheets and useful information players have compiled. Posts get cycled out of the front page after enough time.
---
What the two above said. Marine armour is also hideous, as a side note. 
---
There are pros and cons, it's nice being able to change on the fly, while on the other hand micromanaging perks sucks a lot of fun out of the game.
---
What are you reporting them for? Playing the game the way Bethesda planned?
---
I am actually working on something that may achieve something similar. I just have to get the details sorted before I take it public. 
---
I whole-heartedly agree- When a Fatman hit does less damage than some nut-job swinging a meat hook (I don't care HOW strong you are), it just doesn't seem right.
---
How? If you get a new account and don't do anything bad with it, how is it against TOS?
---
They'd probably get eaten alive.
---
I‚Äôve got all the BoS plans on pc, if you‚Äôd like me to mod the armour for you?
---
The only spare plan I have is *I think* the legs. I definitely have one BoS plan, and I‚Äôll check when I‚Äôm on tomorrow. 
---
If it turns out you want either, send me a message and I‚Äôll send you my username :) 
---
Yes‚Äôm. But just the one. You interested in me gettin ya one?
---
How much does that run
---
Good that you had your guard up. 
---
Ahh!  That's good stuff!  Thanks for explaining that to me.  
---
One last question..  What is a BE lever?  A variant of the lever rifle?
---
Same thing happened to me during a huge mob fight in a nuke zone. Also always on pacifist and had no idea how I‚Äôd been drawn into it.
---
Pretty sure that only applies to PA?
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PC and it'd be an honor to share the the world with you briefly.
---
They will, everything in F4 creation club that was "limited" got released again cant imagine they wont do it with 76. Especially when theres money to be made. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if that were the case blackbird would of been out already.
---
IDK, I feel like most of the outrage has to do with Bethesda's lack of connection with their audience.
---
Let the people speak and hate will subside.
---
This. I rarely need to hunt for specific things to sell. Chems, bulk junk, random legendaries.
---
I‚Äôll check that out. 
---
I'd like to keep an archive of more than just the final codes. I'd like to include all the pieces as well as the keywords. If anyone can assist with providing information about the pieces and keywords from previous weeks (maybe screenshots or videos or old Reddit posts), or if anyone is interested in assisting going forward, please let me know!
---
Yup. Bloodied explosive lever action rifle.
---
No problem! Happy hunting. 
---
On my main at level 450+ I have adrenaline at every single rank. Demo expert at both ranks 4 and rank 5. This is literally the sole benefit of high level characters. You get to trial/error more. Prestige leveling and the ability to break down cards is gonna happen at some point.
---
AD VICTORIAM!
---
Creation club stuff took over 6 months to reappear in some cases. Im saying it will come back not be a permanent item in the store. Its only been 2 months.
---
My bad, I only read the title sorry. I was talking about the power armour plans. 
---
I‚Äôll remove my comment now. Sorry again dude. 
---
Goes to show: if you smell a little bullshit, there‚Äôs probably a lot of bullshit 
---
My second account on my other PC logged in at the same time things nothing of your  opinions.
---
\-Cheers!
---
Well I just want Bethesda‚Äôs confirmation on this.
---
There's a reason people aren't complaining about duped ultracite lasers.   They weren't even worth duping.
---
A group of kids go to the fair. Everyone is allowed to leave with one show bag. Most of the kids buy their one bag and leave. Jimmy the thinker buys three bags and puts two into the one. Jimmy still leaves technically with one bag. The teacher inspects Jimmys show bag and sees he has 3 times as much as what was allowed. Jimmy has his bags confiscated.
---
No one cares about Jimmys story. Jimmy knew the rules. 
---
Sent over a PM. Thanks!
---
What about us who have already several levels of same card?
---
Right now you got reason to continue to level and tinker with your build.
---
I have to admit, this would level the playing field a little between 2nd-account Alt users and non 2nd-account Alt users, thus making the game a LITTLE less "pay to win".
---
So I'd be all for this if implemented, and I'm a second account Alt user.
---
On that topic, is there any interest in a "Care and Feeding of 2nd Account Alts" thread? where I can go over some of the pros and cons and in game behavior of 2nd Account Alts?
---
I just built my camp on water with a single path to a locked door, I only have one direction to defend rather than 4 so 2 heavy turrets and a missile turret actually feels like overkill.
---
This fixed it for me! no lie, thank you so much! I just got the game and it was unplayable at 30 FPS, now not going below 70FPS on Very High.
---
  
---
Cheers mate!
---
So that's the strange thing, I've had them break in the past, but they don't now.  Not sure why they don't but they just don't.  I wonder if it's because it knows I'm doing Berserker (no armor)?
---
Bad idea.
---
Today I was server hoping looking for calibrated shocks. A stealth boy for X01 came up. But I was like 100 short on caps and I had already exhausted most of my vendors for the day, aside from Harper's Ferry. Hopped over there, game froze and died. Haven't seen another stealth boy since. 
---
No. That is a horrible idea. r/playadifferentgame
---
You forgot the MEC Gauss Rifle from Fallout Tactics B)
---
Did it fly or instant explode?  I wonder if the nuke hit the other nuke and exploded in the chamber or something?  You could shoot them down in past games after all.
---
I wish it was in the works, it could help fix a few common complaints such as perk layouts. But yea I would assume they are tied up with server stability maintenance/bug fixes as well as prep for the new dlcs. Also I wasnt a big fan of the fallout shelter game either, not a big mobile gamer.
---
Conan exiles
---
I have this issue as well and have not found a solution yet sadly..
---
Probably were in party chat and couldnt hear game chat
---
I think I've run into that player too.  I had the audacity of walking up to the Watoga vendor while he sprinted in from outside to try to beat me.
---
It's amazing how long it takes to complete your business when someone is punching you :P
---
When I was done, he just kept attacking.  I walked over to a chair, sat down, and just did nothing.  He finally went to do his trading.
---
Maybe he should have been above 20% health.  Sneak and maxed rifle perks with a 2-shot sniper can do amazing damage.
---
OK, so I logged out a fraction of a second later just to be safe, but it was still a victory :P
---
He thinks you  caused that by not gitting gud or having a bad build or something
---
Your statement sounds very raider like to me.
---
Guilty of all charges. üòã
---
Same here.
---
Used a Lvl 45 minigun on a level 31 alpha death claw who had half health. Used all 100 rounds and didn‚Äôt kill him.
---
I started playing mid December and I've only seen 2 that I can remember. 
---
Not really an excuse any more as area chat notifications pop up on the screen to tell you someone is trying to talk to you. 
---
I have launched 5 nukes and done maybe 30 and only one time we failed within time, killed her about 2 minutes after and another time she flew away, think ods quite good for players to join, if heard low level players will join and hide for the reward and that will buff the queen, btw i have 8 keycards im going to farm the queen this weekend on pc.
---
Worst trading experience, but an amazing story to read!!!
---
I HAVE tried one at a SBQ, and I distinctly heard her laugh when it hit. Least it seems to thin her summoned hordes of ground critters.
---
I'm a clown in-game and I resent that remark.
---
Me neither. Back in the day I used to play Angry Birds when iPhone first came out, but that was robs ago. 
---
That Nukes and Dragons perk builder is fantastic. Bethesda should buy that from them and release that in their app. :)
---
If I wreck your house, I will gladly accept the blame, maybe even gloat. Only houses I've wrecked was a trap house and a few who were kept trying to start shit with my team and didn't learn their lesson. 
---
Just started my 7th character so... 
---
Yep and at level 160 I have used very little of level ups in vain. I was roughly level 90 when I choose my last 8 special points,  that was when respec had already came out. I wanted to plan my character well as you only have finite amount of things. 
---
Maybe around at level 200 I should have most cards for all the different reasonable configs I could have with my special set, while still being next to impossible to do major changes to specials.
---
Thanks for the advice! I think I'm just doing it to late in the day, with few people on. I play on console so sadly I can't be a part of the PC community.
---
I‚Äôll send you a message next time I‚Äôm on, thanks man 
---
If I recall correctly they said that fo76 was initially created to be an online addition to fo4 but was to large and complex to be included so they separated it and created the fo76 we know today. Since fo4 had the app I'm sure its plausible but I'd imagine it would be quite the challenge to say the least. 
---
I hope you ruined his whole day!  I'm just going to assume that it did so that I can be a little bit happier. :)
---
May thy Mothman have mercy on your soul.
---
Jokes aside yeah, sucks, but the lack of wanted status would give a dead giveaway for any guild of absence of it quite honestly.
---
Building a large platform near the queen will let your whole team stand up there and she will land up there on the platform too, I've done this with normal floors and foundations. It's a good way to get a bit closer to the queen as she's hovering above and floors are indestructible. 
---
What platform u play on
---
Glowing fungi have an antibiotic effect to counteract the weakening of your immune system from the rad removal process. Diluting the radaway reduces this effect and makes you more susceptible to disease. 
---
I'm full of bullshit but it sounded good didn't it?  
---
Yes though 
---
the brotherhood did not use a nuke as Roger ordered them not to. they set charges in the glassed cavern to disturb the hive and bring the queen out of hiding. in the days following the scorch beasts disappeared but came back greater numbers.
---
Experience it everyday at Ft defiance sucks
---
Lol
---
Ok. So isn't just me then. I always thought the rad storms were cool and they reminded me of Fallout 4. I wonder why we haven't seen them as often.
---
You'd think so. Guess not. Not to mention the other guy popping wanted on the map over and over. Came back like 3 or 4 times. Must have had a serious grudge against the owners (or was dumb enough to think it was my house). 
---
Ive been shooting their turrets but the downfall is finding someone to kill me to remove my bouties o well fuck them it's worth the bounty
---
Xbox. Will be lagging out of fresh nuke zones all week so if your interested and yours works, feel free to join for the rewards that my game will likely never survive to see. 
---
Nah, I just think I shouldn't become wanted for killing a thieving sack of shit. 
---
Nukes and dragons? Is that one of the mods that some people use with 76 on pc? I heard one of them lost its usability with the recent patch due to inability to access and modify files.
---
Bug patch:  Generators and decon arches no longer jump to the top floor when placing on a foundation. 
---
Patch induced bug:  can no longer be placed on upper floors. 
---
Seems about right. 
---
This. I'm really disappointed in the difficulty of the game.  I'm not even high level (62) and there are very few things that feel threatening. Running into a pack of legendary yua gaia is the only thing in my last ten levels that really had me running scared.
---
I did my first silo today and again . . . Disappointed. There was one stealth assaultron that was a PITA but other than that just tedious. 
---
I'm running stealth/vats/crit rifle build, play almost exclusively solo and don't participate in the player market so my gear is far from optimal. With those conditions the game should feel difficult but it just doesn't.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well, does 6:00 Pacific standard time work? My gamer tag is SoloTYLEMaKER
---
Except you have 3 minutes to sort out your inventory before the fight starts if you weren't the one to initiate the nuke.
---
Ooooo!  I want some Buzz Bites!  
---
It‚Äôs not a mod. It‚Äôs a website that has an intuitive perk builder for FO76 that has been around since pre-beta. 
---

They also link to this Market from their main page.

Tonight I‚Äôve given up. But tomorrow, roughly 4pm est so I believe 1 ish around you? I‚Äôll private message you if you really are interested before we launch with my gamer tag so you can join. Won‚Äôt be queen just yet, but later in week 
---
Gotchu fam, my gamertag is SoloTYLEMaKER. No need for caps, just some of the crafting materials. 7;00 pacific standard time good? Saturday
---
What level are u..a couple of weeks ain't that bad I realized I made bad perk choices in the mid-40s
---
They may  be brave, but I don't think they're into self-flagellation 
---
I never keep mine out. Stashed in storage. Drop it if I ever need it (I'm Bloodied now so basically never unless a friend needs it) then store it once I'm done. 
---
They're the motherlode of griefer bait. 
---
It's broken by master craftman standards 
---
the Brotherhood of steel because i'm loyal to this faction across the entire fallout franchise.
---
Yep north of Harpers..there's so many 
---
I've got the chameleon set and am working on an unyielding one too. I would love, love, love it if they enabled 3* wood sets 
---
How about drops that don't suck.  I don't need a vampire rolling pin or a explosive weed whacker.
---
Heh, I‚Äôve been on the same character since the launch date.
---
lol, it sounds like a good idea to me- it's precisely of the same flavour of past fallout games.  And it's lore friendly since it's just like a raider to rig up a contest to hand out death and chaos.  
---
Great idea. But am I one of the few who plays one character?
---
If I haven't gotten it taken care of by then I will def hit u up
---
Yes.
---
Surely you have a billion other things in your game they need fixing before eating time on this?
---
The point is to prep for long battles where you won't have time time repair in between
---
No prob. 
---
Obviously they did plan it. Wrecking ball is a perk devoted specifically to this very behavior. 
---
You have to float it on another object.  The vault boy or vault girl statues work well. Just place shower on very front of pedestal on any floor. 
---
Its the main reason i craft orbital strike grenades. marsupial hop to the roof of the club house, map out what I am targeting and then let 7 to 10 orbital strikes fly. A level 34 just today came up to me all mad that I destroyed his turret camp and started hitting me with some melee weapon. I didnt have any junk and just called a strike down onto both of us. 
---
Their self-flagellatizing themselves if they don't listen to the community.
---
It seems like u have to start a new file? No? Just like in fo4
---
Personally, I just wandered around till I found the Deathclaw, made note of where it was, did my thing to kill it, went back to where I first saw it... then I started moving a few steps and pausing.  I'd get a % reading in the upper left corner for the tracker, and when it was about 97%, I saw a nest on the ground after looking around a little.  Yes, there are some glowing mushrooms there, but if you look for the nest, it shouldn't matter if it's day or night.
---
Yes. Let's take one of the most OP weapon classes in the game (melee) and let players wield two of them at the same time. 
---
For pistols, which for the most part are pathetically weak, I could see it.  Balancing it with an accuracy and reload speed debuff would be appropriate as well since both would be negatively affected. 
---
It'd be cool if they also made an automated weather alert station that you can tune into! You can check in every now and to decide if you want to go storm-chasin' or stay clear of the zone indicated. Maybe a radioactive icon that would pop up on the map like how the event ones do would help too. 
---
I think it should be easier to make ammo, more ammo or less junk cost either if fine but both are preferable. I know that there are perks that can help but they take up a slot and a choice for a better perk.
---
Just a friendly reminder to finally get around to paying your bill.
---
Here's my Power-armor build.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f393aa6&amp;d=s41ss2se2sn1sm1st1pe2er2ei2eu0ep1cs0c70ih2ii0ir2id2a72a81ar2aj1la2l32&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
Am I doing something wrong with my build here?
---
Enforcer shot gun his legs than smash his head in with all rise. I had my camp there for a few weeks and would farm him.
---
I was gonna ask what platform this is on, but given your comments, I'm assuming it's not xbox lol. I'm on Xbox as well (GT: nnaatteedd) and would love to participate in something like this. And I'm sure my 76 friends (around 8 or so) would be interested in this as well.
---
I also like this glitch. If you leave the zone and go back in it triggered it into the normal rads for me. The next time I will never leave. I also found white springs with some irradiated flux but the area was not radiated. No one had launched and not every plant was the flux equivalent, just most of them. 
---
&gt;Losing strength makes logical sense in certain situations because the armor is mechanical and only as strong as it is. You are piloting it, and thus have its physical stat.
---
No, that's not how it works, mechanically or lore-wise. According to the Lore, West-Tek built the suits as a means to allow the wielder to carry and use heavy weapoons. This means that the frames are set-up to hold x amount of weight, (The armor + the Weapon's weight.) with minimal reduction in the range of movement. 
---
Engineering-wise, the suits are a force-amplifier, not a vehicle with a universal strength stat in it's own right; the Strength is dedicated to weight carried and moving the heavy gun they are designed to carry. The frames have no features that would limit the strength amplification of +10, it's a flat +10, has throughout the Bethesda-obsidian games added the effectiveness of +10 strength in carry-weight.
---
If a .50-cal pipe-piston can tear through my power-armor and kill me exiting watoga station from the rooftops, when I fully specced for power-armor use, there is a fucking problem here! 
---
Especially Lore-wise where the Armor plates are designed to protect against bullets (the Chinese didn't have lasers outside of those they recovered from the USA.
---
The farming 25 cores an hour requires you can get the place to farm, and then not have said asshole with a .50cal pipe-rifle snipe you while you wait.
---
Then we take Frank Horrigan. 
---
I have 20 strength with power-armor when I have 15 strength unarmored, and a strength 1 have 11 in power-armor. 
---
Maybe one solution, give the scorched a spore attack where they cough up a cloud of spores.in your face, and for added fun, have scorched seek out any conventional monsters in the area to infect and turn into scorched variants with said spore attack. Make it spread.
---
Wouldn't it be interesting if scorched could progressively infect all monsters in a region and then the next, or even infect the entire map if left unchecked? There could be regional plague events.

Awesome! I'll add you. My gt is frostysundew70.
---
Oh ok, I remember hearing about perk builder websites prior to beta but for some reason I didn't attempt to use them. Probably would've prevented alot of headaches in my current level. It wouldn't be a bad idea to include it, but I'd be happy with quick access to swap cards or perk card loadouts. I'm sure they have some decent things in the works but I'd love to see what they could do with an app and this game, 
---
I will start playing again as soon as I see this in the patch notes.
---
Also thanks for the link, that will definitely come in handy lol
---
This too. It sucks that armor is rare.
---
Totally agree, would be huge QoL update for crafting. I posted this same suggestion a few weeks back, too. 
---
It's easy to shoot 2 bullets at a random tomato plant when shooting dogs near a camp.
---
It should be a reasonable threshold, 10% health of a single camp item?
---
I hate that thing. He hangs out by the fountain the cures all diseases. 
---
But they have been.  But since they aren't getting everyone's pet request fulfilled right away, the players still verbally berate them.  
---
Death claw as well
---
Apparently the Gatling Plasma will no longer drop explosive so mine is now very rare!  Did you guys kill the queen?
---
No problem. Glad to help. 
---
I have plain white for sale 
---
I was like you, at lvl 75 I wanted to change my build. I redone the build I wanted then added how many levels I'd need to complete it, I needed approx 39 more levels pushing me to 114. Remember the higher you go the more Xp is needed to level. Or make a new character and in 59 levels I'd complete the build. What I did was make a new character, I'm so glad I did for my build changed an extra 3 times. Now I'm sitting at level 112, with my build complete. There are other builds I want to try, and I'm looking at my lvl 41 alt that's going to get it. Time is one thing in this game that you real need, everything else comes to you eventually. Three characters, 410 hours played, more builds to do at my pace, await content as I build my alts. Hope that one day my account has 2-3 shared stash space so my characters can give items to each other without asking someone else.
---
Where do you find the artie plans? I heard Watoga, so I went there and got my ass kicked
---
&gt;I injured myself by working too hard, for too long, without proper rest. I still don't know my actual diagnosis. I had an MRI this week and learn the results soon. Similarly I got banned from 76 for playing too much, for too long. I have no idea when/if I'll get my accounts back. It's a real punch in the gut to be forced out of doing the things you enjoy because you put in too much effort.
---
Everything is bad in excess. As clich√© as it sounds, you gotta find balance dude. You've swung from one end to the other, and things are not going to get better this way. You're not dumb so you probably already know that, but sometimes it helps to see it in writing. Re: exercise with the scapula injury - stationary bike, leg ab/adduction, hell just go outside and walk around. 
---
how is it possible? it's easy.. first you have to be in a bad accident, you then have to have both knees replaced, 3 titanium cages, 9 screws and a pin put in.. Sooo while you cannot sleep from the pain, you either stay awake watching cable tv or you keep your mind moving and use a game as a social outlet. 9 hours a day? that is a joke right? 
---
For months I've been collecting weightless wood pieces thru farming and by shopping the markets (ps4).  I've certainly seen the scarcity you've noted in weightless wood right legs specifically. 
---
Keep it up. We appreciate your work 
---
Also support this. I finally got hunting rifle suppressor after 50 (yes, I counted) scraps of nothing. I was thinking it was glitched. 
---
Scorched speak, some wear clothes, they take cover during combat, and they snipe; so, perhaps they begin as intelligent and degenerate as they get closer to seizing. 
---
Great read thank you!
---
ALWAYS wanted this for fallout. 
---
&gt;hey respawn after about 30 mins or so, and if you hit a 3* the first time round in an area, it's VERY likely (certain? Not sure) that you will get a 3* on subsequent runs. So make a route, make it last 30 mins, and hope for the golden map. I do this all the time starting with one place. If it's a 3*, I continue, if not, I server hop.
---
I don't think so. I've been killing lots of bots in Watoga. Just killing, not farming. As long as I stay in area or very close to it, like the power transform yard is too far, and as new players come to the area to reset all, what was legendary, will respawn as legendary. But what was 3 star legendary, usually spawns as 1 star legendary. So the legendary property will stick to them, but not being 3 star. I do still often try to stick to the area any time I see a rare 3 star, but they don't seem to respawn as such. 3 stars seem more likely to spawn elsewhere. I suspect 3 random stars are more linked to how many players are in area. While Watoga is fairly well visited, people don't hang around there. They come and go. 
---
At Harpers ferry, another place I like to hang out, I've seen a little bit of possibility of 3 star legendaries respawning as such. I don't know why Watoga bots would be different.
---
I didn't block, not will I. This person was just playing in a manner that is not compatible with my play-style. It was frustrating, but karma will find them, and placing items at their own CAMP will always be difficult and needing support!
---
Not yet sorry üòû
---
üòÇ i like it
---
Mine is zachnchez! I‚Äôll be on Friday.
---
The Missile Silo Status Holotape?
---
When I look at it, it says "Launch Prep Required / 0 hr.0 min." for all 3 Silos.
---
No tactical flashlight. 
---
They allow inspecting when trading with vendors. But they replaced R3 with ‚Äúshow offers‚Äù and basically removed the inspect feature. They def need to fix it when player trading. Or we are all just gonna have to wait for player vending machines and force trades thru them to prevent being scammed. 
---
I want others to visit my CAMP and utilise it when needed, just as I seek the sanctuary of other CAMPs when I'm exploring. I've got a thumbs-up Vault Girl statue out the front indicating I'm friendly - I think that's a fairly universal signal.
---
This person was clearly jealous of the amazing location and care that I had put into my build.
---
I want my mole-miner gauntlets to be usable in power-armor! I rolled a RNG Mole-Miner Gauntlet with Bloodied, +1 strength, and +Reflects 75% damage on blocking.
---
I'm unarmed-specced, but I can't use it and power-armor. :-(
---
I still got em.  Hit me up on the PS4 if you want them tomorrow.  
---
95% of questions gonna be cheaters spamming I'm wrongfully banned blahblah didn't do anything blah

Took me a month to realize this too

Just direct message me the name lol
---
That's the worst part about this game, give me a PvE server. I just spent 300 god damn years locked away with all of you lunatics, I just want to get away from you all for now and be one with the environment that I live in. If I want to PvP I would of killed you all back in Vault 76, but I didn't so leave me alone!
---
Where do I find paddle balls I‚Äôve never seen one
---
Doubt it, but i didnt check this week.
---
Now I‚Äôm impressed. 
---
Can't say I disagree.
---
Enter in from the east across from the train station. The main structure is closest to the outer perimeter there with no external buildings between the 2. Circle the outer wall via the north, if you go around the south there is a scorch beast spawn. Stick close to the wall of you want to avoid super mutants and let the Whitesprings guards handle any enemies at the gate, charred ghouls and even deathclaws can spawn there. Once in the wall go around the main building to the north staying close avoiding the ghouls spawning in the outer buildings. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty proud of it myself, the part you can‚Äôt see is it goes all the way around 
---
Nice story :) 
---
Just wondering what kind of weapon did you use to murder all these clowns? I'm assuming AAE rifle / shotgun?
---
Google the posts he got negative karma on and then give him his -1 there.
---
I don't understand the issue with this? I haven't played 76 since week one, so I'm a little out of date. What are you triggered about, and why is it a big deal?
---
...and everyone clapped.
---
I completely agree. This player systematically walked around my CAMP hitting items several times, then moved onto the next item. They had chameleon armour so I kept hearing them beep in and out of vision, but I stood in front of them a number of times, expressed my dissatisfaction, and they retorted with the confused emote before going back to whacking away. This is a huge difference from stray bullets while defending someone else's CAMP from the perils of the wasteland.
---
I hope Bethesda addresses this, but I will understand if they do not. It is a gameplay mechanic, and people are entitled to play as they choose.
---
East of top of the world train station, there are 2 that spawn in a small water camp down the hill.
---
Some people have no honor and simply enjoy being heathens.
---
Why thank you 
---
Thats the size i wish we had to work with 
---
I love this story. 
---
Just one weapon for the whole fight.
---
Bloodied vat crit damage 50% hunting rifle.
---
I have tank killer, better critical, bloody mess, maxed rifle perks, eagle eye, and adrenal reaction. I run with 20% health and depend on a chameleon armor as my only form of defence. 
---
Well, if you like shelves... 
---
What the hell is tesla armor and where do I find it
---
Its a cool look
---
This shelf base looks hilarious
---
If you align it  just right you can sometimes fit pictures to the shelves and stack other furniture to it
---
NPCs could be desperate survivors, irradiated, diseased, starving, dying, crippled with injury, or even crying, hopeless  and begging for death. There is no reason they can't enhance the environmental storytelling by invoking empathy.
---
Some people would just kill and loot them, some might offer aid, supplies, or assistance, and a world of random side quests could open up any time you run across such a wandering survivor.
---
Unfortunately, other players can't fill void because dying has little penalty and we have plenty of resources. NPC's could paint an even bleaker picture if we can see them in terms of the aftermath of nuclear war.
---
Honestly the cheerful event announcers are what really kill the apocalypse vibe.
---
Awesome
---
Ugh that sucks.
---
Honestly, I just want that ‚ÄúLegendary Player‚Äù thing to come sooner so I can restart my character and do a better build, I HATE melee. I know it‚Äôs a good build but to me it isn‚Äôt my cup of tea
---
Lol the fight had me shakey at the end. I was so hyped that I pulled it off lol.
---
It would be nice to win a real lottery and get a random legendary :D
---
Holy crap, and to think I was planning on trading some of my legendaries today. I didn't even know you couldn't even see what effects are on the legendaries people want to trade with you on the trade menu XD. No wonder people prefer just pure caps at times. Reminds me of people trying to scam trade you items in TF2, using tags to change the items name or description to something false. 
---
Really hope they fix this system. I absolutely love trading and being a merchant in these kinds of games. Its just a shame there's so many ways to scam people in this game.
---
I noticed it with Butcher's Bounty right away and figured out it worked for the other "search" perks too. 
---
It was really hype in its moment.
---
Definetly worth the write up.
---
What else you got I have 1500 rounds of it... I'll trade for 5.56 5mm .45 dm me 
---
Vid or it didn't happen.
---
A little east/northeast of the fairgrounds, if I remember correctly. There‚Äôs a junk pile there, so you can use the interactive map and search only for junk to find it easier. 
---
Ooooooh.
---
One important thing drop a nuke in the way that only edge of radiation zone will reach fissure prime it will allow players to engage without pa (vats and melee players are losing a lot of DMG if they need to enter pa)
---
That was beautiful
---
I can do it now. Categoricshoe47 
---
It‚Äôs just a trailer with some safes and supermutants right?
---
Agree, This is actually a new issue. They thought they fixed the accidental bounty on CAMP / workshop but Bethesda just created another problem with it. This story is the perfect example to abuse the accidental bounty patch. I hope the devs read this reddit post.
---
Ps4? I'd love to team up and take on the Queen.
---
Yeah I actually just found it, thanks for the help though... btw I just opened 15 safes and got absolutely nothing so this local is not worth the hours I spent looking for it 
---
I totally agree - we've spent 25 years in the vault working together, planning to rebuild a society and plant the seeds of humanity back into a desolate wasteland. If I didn't kill them in the 25 years underground, why would I want to kill them when I'm suddenly released into freedom. I understand if resources were scarce, or there was a faction war that had developed inside the vault, but I don't feel that is the case based on the opening sequence when leaving the vault.
---
Work together to defeat the common enemy, share resources to survive, realise that alone we cannot defeat some of the larger beasts, but as a community we can overcome them.
---
I understand the apocalypse makes people change, but we were the best and brightest, chosen by Vault-Tec, and we had 25 years to get used to the idea after the bombs fell. If people were going to change to become undesirable, murderous sociopaths, it wouldn't just be happening after Reclaimation Day.
---
Heavy metal is the best üëç
---
I agree on following you're journey, for in 12 months time once the road map is complete, one could re visit this review and see how much of an impact it's made to the game. The downside to reviewers giving a review is that, they rarely update their original review, give praise when a game has given something positive to the game. Most reviewers will focus on the negative aspect and build on that.
---
I mean, yeah, logic and all, but this is a game where radiation turns creatures into ghouls and giant monstrosities. Where the pre-war government created super mutants and deathclaws. Where you can loot a couple factories or offices and scrap the junk inside to build a military-grade power armor. Where a glowing ant can drop you a rifle that shoots two exploding bullets at a time, with only one barrel and using one bullet. I don't think realism is a priority over gameplay mechanics here
---
I prefer funk and country folk
---
Ok my GT is brad9284 I'll join you in a sec
---
I think like 30ish? i didn't play every day.
---
Yeah, they still make me jump if I run into one unexpectedly. Their hissing and grunting are also something to be feared.
---
+karma
---
Nah,  if they had the armor helm in game it looks like baby PA. Which is kinda cool.  But good luck getting a complete set of anything with the legendary perks you want. 
---
BoS heavy combat armor is the best. 
---
Im not really good with the videos bits. I try to record with playstation, but I could never capture the right moments. I'm sorry, unfortunately, I can not provide a video, because I went for a smoke break after the tense of that struggle, and when I came back. I did record session and I got the last 10 minutes of the main menu screen.

I will have to settle with this write up for now, and I could probably begin to stream. That would probably be a better way to capture these sweaty moments.
---
You mean that game where everybody always kills everybody because they're afraid that everybody is going to kill them first if they don't?
---
Certainly that wouldn't happen with FO76 if we had permadeath/full-loot FFA pvp.
---
those things make it so easy to slip into a locked camp tho
---
Yup
---
Boo.  I love going solo against a team.  Record it for posterity next time.
---
I think we should also be able to drop arty danger close
---
Thought I would cheese a Wendigo from atop a lookout tower thinking he couldn't get up. Lost sight of him and headed for the stairs. I look down and I see the creepy bastard running on all fours two sets of stair below me. He cleared that in like a second and mauled my ass to death. I nearly shit myself.
---
I wouldn't worry about it.
---
‚ÄúBFG‚Äù is my favorite one so far
---
Yeah...
---
It requires players to plan their characters accordingly.
---
Can't they just leave the server as soon as they cant get out?
---
Actually I don't. But disconnecting and shutting down the launcher the restarting always seems to work, after repeatedly getting the someone in your space message.  
---
Tesla coils mod on power armor chest. I randomly found it on vender bot. Idr where. 
---
We need more rad storms in general and weather conditions! Dust/ash storms, irradiated rain, etc! Cant come up with too many off the top of my head, but the enviornment should play a bit more of a factor when exploring Appalachia!
---
As an alcoholic, this was my reaction, as well. I'm very familiar with the fact that alcohol is *not* hydrating.
---
Ok thx
---
Does anyone have all the Silo Code Pieces, including Alpha? Can you post them? Here are the ones I've collected so far, and if I understand it correctly, here's today's reveal of the first keyword letters: [https://imgur.com/a/9pp1STK](https://imgur.com/a/9pp1STK)
---
Any help would be awesome, thanks!
---
Also, I'm trying to create an archive of all detailed info (code pieces and keywords) from previous weeks. If anyone has any info saved, it would be great to have!
---
Thats the goal. They cant grief. And if they comeback, at least people will have been warned
---
Quick question, do i have to blur out their names or its ok if it is on a video.
---
Like is it a violation on reddit?
---
And if i had to blur out their names. Do you know of any video editor that can do that?
---
Ouch
---
Ah ok. Cool
---
I mean they cant grief anymore if they dont have friend on the server and if they come back at least people will know what to expect.
---
Perks don't matter. Special matters and getting that right does take some thinking. 
---
 You will end up with all the perks and can swap them to your hearts content.
---
True
---
Someone he knows may have been on the server.  They may know you too. Just out of curiosity, who was it?
---
And some of those guys have great PvP builds. I've done a 4v4 where I'd occasionally find myself in a 1v2 or even a 1v3 situation. It can get dicey if you're not careful, but if you're good enough, PvP with determined adversaries who think they have the upper hand can be quite enriching.  
---
If you're outside, and can't find the body... look up to the sky. Fought a bloated glowing one at the Sons of Dane Compound the other day. After it died, it immediately disappeared. Turns out the body was floating in the sky. Was able to get some pretty cool photos since it looked like it was going in for a tomahawk slam dunk in the air.
---
I‚Äôve never built this kind of CAMP because farming is dull. But now I‚Äôve changed my mind.  I will build it to lure vigilantes and get their bounties.
---
It kinda sucks, but it's a pretty funny story. Coming across an occasional douchebag helps me appreciate the cool people... which, fortunately, are the vast majority (on PC format at least).
---
How do i post pic? Sorry im new
---
Thanks I'll try that, hopefully I can make it look better 
---
If you are going strength/ anything stick with melee.  Now of you are looking to do a medic build,  try to find something fast that will keep the halls coming to your team mates. Honestly just go with the best melee weapon you find. 
---
It works very well and the "Steam" provides a bit of cover.
---
PA or regular?  
---
Perks:  
---
- Action Boy (increase AP refresh).  
---
- Dodgy (use AP to avoid damage).  
---
- Blocker (45% melee resistance).  
---
- Fireproof (45% explosive resistance for TSE).  
---
If bloodied:
---
- Serendipity (45% chance avoid damage).   
---
- Nerd Rage (+DR, +20% damage, + AP refresh).  
---
- Emergency Protocols (PA torso mod, -50% dam).  
---
This guy has a damn good PVP build.  Better than mine.  He kicked my ass on first encounter. The second encounter, I just let him have to shop because I was about to get off anyway.   It's not a big deal. It's just really weird to run into the same guy two days in a row.
---
I know posting their names is a violation, but gameplay should be fair.  Then again I have no idea and just post videos anyway, so go for it.
---
Thank you for your help man!
---
You can build up power armor that runs off of nuclear fuel cells out of springs and rocks, but you can‚Äôt figure out how to weld a Power Fist to the knuckles of your armor. Or even a freaking pair of Wolverine claws from the Molemen or Deathclaw gauntlets. 
---
Smart thinking Bethesda. 
---
Lol this may sound strange.
---
I raided that workshop twice and it had the same owner on both different occasions.
---
If it was me, i am sorry, and it isn't personal at all. I just look for pvp with workshops.
---
I've seen some good ones. Fwiw I sometimes PvP with a commie whacker if I think I can get away with it. If I think my opponent is a serious PvPer then its BE handmade or the Mr Handy's Bloody Buzz Blade of Death.  
---
I was 209 hours before i new y button searched containers. I played almost all fallouts yet i still dont know how to play
---
I'm glad to hear you're back to playing the game you want to :)  The circumstances are unjust, but you being back to playing it is what matters :)   
---
If only bethesda put in half the amount of effort in this game that you did, it would MAYBE survive but given how they are giving copies of this game with console bundles already containing the game, its just-----i dont see it happening.
---
I need my service rifle, assault/marksman carbine and r91 assault rifle
---
Hey nap20000! Did you find a buyer for that revolver?
---
Press Print Screen in the game. They are saved as "ScreenShot&lt;#&gt;.png" in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76"
---
You can upload the pics to Imgur.com and share the link
---
Lol, left the wounded as bait. Went all Full Metal Jacket on them.
---
Not yet. I'm working tonight and was planning on posting it up shortly before I got off in the morning. Know someone who's interested?
---
I build a full luck full charisma til 50 then realized I couldn‚Äôt kill anyway. Redid my entire spec with each level up. 117 now and have my special points how I want and every card in the game basically. You don‚Äôt have to be a ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù specced character at 50. 
---
Mount Blair Trainyard
---
Best sniper tactics. Team players always try to pull heroic moments lol.
---
I was super excited when I first saw a radstorm, as I remembered how terrifyingly beautiful the first one I saw in FO4 was. Imagine my disappointment when not only was it over in what felt like only seconds, but it wasn't even the tiniest bit dangerous.
---
It doesn't help how rare they are either. Nearly 200 hours, and I've seen... 3 üôÑ
---
I got raided by this guy twice, but two different places. Yesterday it was the landfill.   Again, the PVP isn't a big deal. It's part of it, I get it.  I've just never ran into the same random stranger twice in two days on different servers before. 
---
I could go for unbroken windows on the barn plan, too. 
---
I‚Äôd be down
---
This man speaks truth.
---
Or a "mailing" system. There's an awful lot of empty mailboxes in Grafton...
---
&gt; losing my girlfriend, and I've likely lost a chance at the career/job I wanted.
---
Normal, if you spend 15 hours/day playing a game, being a 30 yo adult! 
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I freaking love my power armor.
---
But I am glad that that it is, at least a little bit, a choice with some tradeoffs.  I like going without PA so I can be quick, sneaky, craft stuff, or just be quiet for a change.  Being able to swap in and out too quickly makes it a less meaningful choice to get out of the armor for a while.
---
Workshops usually attract pvp. If I want a decent pvp, i usually capture one and wait for an invader or invade.
---
This applies to most pvp players as well.
---
What is Mr Prize bot? I've been playing since beta. Is this a luck thing or a random encounter. 
---
This was so much fun!! Thanks for making the highlight reel and thanks to the HOA for hosting üíôüíõ hope we can all do something like this again soon!! 
---
I will let one of my buddies know about it. He is a vats pistol build. That revolver must be gold to him.
---
This applies to so, so many more aspects of the game than just CAMP budget.
---
How much more ammo capacity? How much armor penetration? What's the reload speed? 
---
How can we make intelligent decisions involving trade-offs without being *informed*?
---
There also needs to be a confirm trade option. I came across a random person today that wanted to trade items. I said lets set both items for 2k so at least neither of us get screwed. He said he only had 200 caps so I think, crap he really is trying to screw me. But I wanted that 4 star Machete. So I risked it. And it worked out great! But that is not how it always works out.
---
I was expecting someone with such a build would pay handsomely for it considering just how much a 50% extra crit damage would do on top of a bloodied build. 
---
I'd gladly pay caps for the stealth boys :) 25 per ?
---
Did it all night to me around white springs. 2 deathclaws and nothing to show for it. 
---
Keto ftw!
---
Im sure he would.
---
As another dude tells me. Its all about what u need. The price never matters once u find it lol.
---
If there‚Äôs a viable Gunslinger PA build I‚Äôd play with that over a cookie cutter melee build.
---
I second this
---
No prob. Anything else lemme know
---
Basically random encounter, a Mr Handy will show up announcing you've won a prize. I've had it happen 3-4 times and the prize is always pretty mundane... think I got a gold fork last time haha.
---
I appreciate that you're putting a positive spin on it. My experience has been that when I see one of these bases, the owner doesn't like it when I also get involved in the ghoul fight and often tries to start trouble with me.
---
Lots of New Vegas (lol). But I do love the weapons from that game. I can say that textures for a Chinese Assault Rifle have been found in the game.
---
Im not a melee player, but i'd support a SLIGHT one-handed nerf if we could dual wield. I think that could be forgiven.
---
There was a time bloodied weapons were trash to me.  Now I've spent a fortune acquiring them. I spent 10k on a bloodied buzz blade (if you've seen what they can do you'd understand). Traded for a BE lever, despite the fact that in December I GAVE ONE AWAY to a friend who wanted an exploding rifle. 
---
Oh i see, well thats just a dick move.
---
Building stuff is pretty much my favorite thing to do in 76. Fallout 4 as well, really. My brother talked me into doing some videos. 
---
Fallout 4 when I first encountered Swan or whatever that giant things name was.
---
My controller at the time was on the fritz and it‚Äôd periodically send a single saying I pressed the trigger button. So I accidentally shit the floating swan and I saw this giant ass super mutant pop up. I ran into a nearby bus and spent 30 minutes with my low level guns grinding away at its health bar.
---
Bro just hop servers. These encounters are few and far between. 
---
We absolutely need this.
---
Yeah i knew for screen shot. Its for reddit i mean. Im on ps4 so il just take a pic of it
---
So much funs looting legendaries melees weapons when you use a rifles build.
---
r/woosh
---
Sorry about that. I dont do that.
---
Go just north of your boy Phoenix. The little crick that borders the north side of watoga. Ran into someone with an interesting camp set up. It was floating foundations one had to jump from using sprint and marsupial. When I got to the top the dude closed app trying to kill me with the fall dmg. Didn't work. But hella creative. Anyhow you can camp here. Cheers! 
---
It says it gives extra damage to workshop objects. Now semantics be damned, but I believe the intent behind this is for contesting workshops, not destroying, or near destroying, a players camp.
---
I don't think with this perk, the devs planned for players to be assholes like this, they planned for players to fight over workshops. You know the places where PvP is actually encouraged and emphasized.
---
What do you get from almost destroying another players camp like this? Repeatedly so. Nothing but a laugh, and that laugh is a real fucking dick move.
---
Known bug, announced to be fixed next patch
---
FYI - found a great copper ore place today. It's just a bit N, NNE of Solomon's Pond. There are 9 harvestable copper ore veins in close proximity (6 in one spot, 3 in the other) as well as a harvestable spot there - I nabbed 105 pieces of ore in that one area in my excavator suit. By chance, there is also 3 aluminum veins there pretty close by...although there are aluminum veins all over these hills between this spot and Whitesprings train station. There are 3 more copper veins behind the tower there at the station. Hope this helps.
---
 Up by the Monorail to the south there are a series of ponds that make great CAMPs. My guy who seriously farmed the area lived there for quite a while. Its 4 caps to the Station.
---
Perhaps one of the AP refresh torso mods paired with vats perks, AP refresh perk, and high damage pistols like the revolvers?   You could build crits pretty quick and they have fairly low AP cost iirc. 
---
Wish I knew how to send a pm, I may be down
---
Are you on PC using mods? This bug usually happens because strings files get screwed up, but I'm not sure what could be causing it in this case
---
Diluted radaway is homeopathic. The more you dilute it, the stronger it gets.
---
Fort defiance. Have to have the brotherhood questline complete and it's in the generals quarters on fourth floor. Or on xbox and friend me I give em out. I think everyone should have explodies

This one

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/ao9ud0/cerberus_decided_to_pay_a_visit_or_fluffy/
---
True true. Lol.
---
Pvp is feature of game , plays game , surprised people pvp. 
---
That sounds annoying but not unexpected.  Seems like a good spot and time to attack someone if you were so inclined to do so. 
---
I don't see the point in what the griefer did to you. Many wreck bases to get wanted to play the bait.  I don't understand what this guy was doing other than being a dick. Did he kite some enemies to you to finish the job?
---
Yes and it is amazing. Little slow to fire but worth the wait. 
---
Do leader of the pack every time it pops up. Good xp for your level and you might even get some useful gear.
---
Understood. I feel the same is why I give out stuff. To maybe get people to pay it forward
---
You don‚Äôt have to touch workshops. You choose to engage in pvp on your own. I personally don‚Äôt touch workshops and never engage in pvp nor respond to it. If someone attacks me I ignore them. If someone attacks my camp I server hop. Shit ain‚Äôt rocket science. 
---
I use my power armor when I need to be a tank. Yesterday I was playing and I was teamed with a random. We came across a group of 10+ mirelurks crossing some train tracks. My companion emoted the thumbs down and crouched behind a rock. I put on my power armor, thumbs up‚Äôd, pulled out my super sledge and charged. The praise the lord and pass the ammunition song was playing. It was a glorious moment. 
---
However, my main build is a sneaky sniper. My main goal at most locations is to try and find the high ground and snipe down. 
---
Wow I'm so sorry to hear that. Hope that you're recovering well. Good thing we live in a day and age where we have lots of forms of entertainment and can connect with others online. Wishing you the best.
---
Deathclaw gauntlet goes well with the cult outfit, decent damage too
---
I have had them do this as well. It's really frustrating. One thing I found (and this doesn't work all the time) is that I think they fall one layer below where you can see them (clipped into the ether?) and a well-placed grenade will blow them back into reality (just watch where it lands...) and you can get your loot then. Otherwise, I'd wait for it to turn into a meat pile because those usually will show up at some point. If you turned them to ash or goo, well... You're probably SOL...
---
Some of us help you by defending your workshop. Stop engaging in pvp if you don‚Äôt want to play that part of the game. Nobody is forcing you to capture workshops and when you do, you are choosing to be a target of potential pvp action. 
---
only if he ticks like the suicide super mutants
---
Your posted results seem to miss vanguard and unyielding? Didn't notice if any others were missing. From your table you seem to have them. Your armor totals seem to be about 54%.  Not sure the two missing would explain it all.
---
Actually I think it takes up like half a turret. Range is weird though. It doesn‚Äôt reach as far as you would think but you can‚Äôt do it any closer than 50 foundations. Hard to aim as well. Good for show and bragging rights.
---
I like it because it makes it look like a structure that was there before the war. That you just moved your shit into and made your home.
---
Heyy that's a good idea and it does look good in the outfit thanks
---
No prob
---
You don‚Äôt have to prove anything to anyone. If you game with a large enough group of people and were the main storage unit for your whole squad, it‚Äôs not impossible to obtain what you had. Welcome back and I hope you have fun still running through with a new character. 
---
with a single hamer is pretty easy too..
---
I reaquired all my mutations just to fix the adrenal mutation and it work....until I signed into a different server and the same issue of it not functioning appeared again.
---
Sentinel is of course much rarer as it's 3 star.
---
That video was very cool.
---
Unless you're working on the picklock challenge 
---
I third this. Mostly because I have one and nothing else for cool guns.
---
that's only two stars then.   
---
Assassins powered and what else?  
---
Serendipity is the shit. 
---
I can count over 20 times that perk has saved my life.
---
Make the robot patrols attack player buildings because it doesn't meet White Springs strict home owners association requirements.
---
Great suggestion!
---
Thanks for the replies. I've had my camp in the forest since I started the game. Just decided I want to move since I'm usually in the cranberry bog and savage divide area alot. And don't want to keep paying 30+ caps to fast travel all the time
---
I just recently saw two of them fighting each other. I thought it was odd because the sounds seemed distinct so not to err about it being wendigo versus something else. And why would they fight each other? Once I saw them both while trying to avoid their attention, it was plain wendigo and scorched wendigo. Scorched was quite superior.
---
I think they are quite weak. They look super deadly because they can run/leap to you so fast, but their attacks lack damage and they don't stagger you much.
---
I have all the mod plans. I want to be able to make the underarmor itself. 
---
There is so much more to do. Follow the quests, stay on the left left/middle of the map for a bit. This isn't a spring, it's a marathon. I'm in the 80's (I'm a casual player, I don't have a set "type" so I know I'm lacking in some armor/weapons/perks areas) and I still retreat to where I get assistance from the robots from time to time. 
---
Learn the perks and use them to your advantage, unlike me who waited until ~70 to really start paying attention to the cards. You've got a long way to go before you solo Whitesprings BEFORE some one nukes the area. It gets much much worse after someone drops a nuke...
---
DIS-A-POINTED!
---
The steps they are taking have proven appropriate (not saying the situation was/is ok). This would be overkill and would hurt the relationship, not help it.
---
This "update" from you comes to us less than 24 hours after YoungYea made his video about your situation, at this time, at around 300k+ views. What's with the sob story personal info? To gather sympathy for your cause? It's not needed. You are probably the most infamous banned player from any online video game in recent memory. 
---
Anyone who cares already knows the story. Including Bethesda. Given the popularity of your story I have no doubt Bethesda took a good look at your situation. By this point the fact you are still banned let's me know that you probably deserved the punishment. 
---
Please stop giving the lvl 40s ideas. hah!
---
It most certainly is. I've stripped off all my armor and had guys hit me as hard as they could to clear a bounty. They're always are shocked when their best attack does absolutely nothing. 
---
I sell Halloween skull costumes. They sell for 61 each for me so 3 per vendor plus some water. Each takes 2 cloth and 5 plastic and weigh 0.1 lbs. 21 or so per day to max each vendor. If you farm plastic regularly it‚Äôs not hard to keep up with. I haven‚Äôt found the civil war top hat plan yet otherwise I‚Äôd swap to that to save plastic for other stuff. 
---
All I see is 21k caps...f that!
---
Seriously, it's always the low levels who do this lame turret base nonsense. Pretty much anybody over lvl 80 in decent power armor can solo all the ghouls in whitesprings unless they've spent all their perk points on quality of life cards.
---
My young friends, make a high damage build and have some fun.
---
Using too much ammo? Go melee!
---
I have definitely not seen the scariest out there as I just bought the game a couple of days ago. But just as I got out of the vault, like 5 minutes later I was walking around in the forest just slapping my face on my controller trying out the buttons and completing the tutorial stuff when I hit the VATS button and it auto-locked onto this weird hulking grey mass that walked out from behind a tree. Lo and behold I looked up and saw the name "Mothman". 
---
The spooky thing for me, aside from seeing this so quickly after leaving the vault, was that it was facing away from me. It turned around slowly and I saw the glowing red eyes and then it disappeared in front of me.
---
Annnd I have yet to see it again, so now I'm worried this thing is just gonna be lurking about.
---
Yet melee damage is based off strength. I would like to see special stats modify damage. Like how energy weapons used to be tweaked by intelligence. 
---
Yup, I use it for my absolute last defensive measure. 
---
If a player and I ever get into it and we‚Äôre both super low, I‚Äôll win everytime with Serendipity.  
---
[in Chinese accent] I would also like to know/s
---
I haven't seen this on PC, but What I have seen is killing an enemy and while in the "death animation" it instantly turns into a meat pile. 
---
You mean our "friend" "NU***_T*****ER"? He had laser cannons or something blasting through the windows about an hour ago. I considered destroying them, but I didn't want to become wanted, so I changed servers... What a dick. 
---
North of Morgantown airport.
---
All that shelf space, not a thing to put on em. Lol nice work, now you just need to make a 3 dimensional maze/obstacle course
---
What is this, Apex Legends?
---
Sounds like a player‚Äôs camp
---
Because technically alcohol dehydrates you more than it hydrates you lol 
---
That‚Äôs why you feel like utter shit in the A.M. cuz you‚Äôre dehydrated from pissing all night long. 
---
Rank 3 Dodgy, paired with the regular damage reduction perks and Emergency Protocols is awesome too, though high ROF attacks drain your AP. 
---
Sorry for the bad quality images. I suck at editing videos, and that was my best attempt to blur out names lol
---
If you do this the loot has a chance of not loading in the legendary loot. It loads regular loot first then sees it needs to add a legendary item. I've come back after a minute and found legendaries in otherwise empty ghouls 
---
I actually pointed out this problem before the patch hit after they announced it in their Inside the Vault.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqlfkr/fallout_76_inside_the_vault_february_14_2019/egirehc
---
Yup, I knew this was gonna happen with that fix. I have been waiting for it. It took longer than I thought it would. PvE and PvP pure split are what's gonna have to happen to fix it. If you are pacifist then your camp is pacifist too. Then remove slap damage. 
---
Checkout https://nukacrypt.com/solved . It has the solved codes for this week.
---
Nope. It‚Äôs annoying af cuz I run a stealth atk perk for some extra dmg when I sneak up. 
---
Shit ain‚Äôt workin 
---
Not the HOA! 
---
The most recent one I destroyed was a Level 31. I actually felt a little bad. He didn‚Äôt retaliate. Didn‚Äôt attempt to PvP me. Just stood there waving as I blew up his turrets. I got a 60 Cap bounty on my head. Another mid/high level player watched me shouting his turrets and didn‚Äôt attempt to collect my bounty. He Thumb Up‚Äôd in agreement. 
---
After it was over, I found a friend online that wasn‚Äôt on my team and asked him to execute me. He did and bounty was claimed. No harm. No foul. 
---
Pretty sure he's aware of NukaCrypt and knows they don't have Bravo or Charlie solved yet. 
---
u/Ladydevann please ask about this?
---
Yip i also have it
---
They should. I drop them when I find them because who needs a 6lb single shot that may or may not hit its target? (Me no shoot gud)
---
I have 2 extra if you still need one. I usually buy extras when I see them in case I find a better gauntlet than what I have and need to add the 3rd claw mod. 
---
flat areas w/ water. But whatever. I started using the single foundation w/ stairs style build, so I just look for water and can build anywhere. 
---
Even 1 code is enough. You can server hop if the current server Alpha silo was just used.
---
But you can only launch once, then you're in cooldown unless you're teamed with others who can launch for you. 
---
Lol, I had a flashback of gears of war 2 multiplayer, where dive rolling is the only way to get from point A to point B
---
That's a shame. Oh well. Thought they felt awfully weak when I used them tonight.
---
Was it like this? I thought the silo is in cooldown and it wasnt tied to your character.
---
Literally unplayable /s
---
The Bethesda announcement implies a respec of some type when turning legendary. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
I understand that.  Just really weird that it happened with the same guy two days in a row.  
---
when u play apex and switch to fallout 76
---
I support this 110%. Hell, I'd pay Atoms for a faction flag set.
---
There's multiple cool downs. There's the rebuild, specific to that silo on that server. It's 3 hours. There's also an individual cooldown between players, though I haven't sussed out how exactly it is calculated, only that the game has told me "recent user launch detected cools down period active" and given me the amount of time before I can launch again. 
---
I haven't played since the last patch but there was a glitch where all of the NPC's at Whitespring were low level and  the regular ghouls were replaced with the Golfer Ghouls in the golf Club House.  It was easy to get that award then.  Just continue to farm Whitespring.
---
You should have been there live! :)
---
You only say that because you won 1000 Caps! ;)
---
It really was great, you guys were a killer crowd and I'm still laughing about some of it. The Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association is planning our next show, and it's going to make this one seem like playing bridge with your Grandma. 
---
You should add some rule, or like a stickied post showing people what google is. 95% of people seem to be unaware of this magical website and the power it possesses.
---
If being assh#le edgelord means being right, then yes I am that.
---
That's different 
---
That‚Äôs also a good suggestion, or at the least increase the relevant benefits non combat related special states 
---
I have re-read the email he was sent, at no point do they say he had that much ammo, merely he acquired that much ammo.
---
Which means making 20k of ammo makes it 20k. Transferring it to an alt, makes it +20k on that account, transfer it back to original account and to a different character for storage, makes it 40k of ammo on account 1.
---
Want to use it on original character? transfer to alt accout makes alt account have 40k of ammo acquired, transfer it to original accounts first character makes account 1's total be 60k of ammo. 
---
Decide you aren't using that ammo and want the space, transfer to account 2 makes account 2 have 60k of ammo, and moving it back to account 1 makes account 1 have 80k of acquired ammo. All with just a single stack of 20k ammo. Combined between both the accounts that is 140k of acquired ammo in total all from moving 20k back and forth.
---
If one character keeps making ammo and moving which character it is stored on due to space limits in the stash makes it very quick and easy to acquire that much ammo in total over a 30 day period. There are what, 5 character slots? 600 weight on each, and assuming he keeps ammo with the gun that uses it, and moves them around accordingly the 'total' can be reached pretty quick
---
Heck with a friend, I could trade that much back and forward between us within an hour given a decent starting stack. after all it take less than a minute to do a trade, and you can move the entire stack at one go, just set price to 0 per bullet, and you are done.
---
People keep confusing the word 'acquired over 30 days' with 'currently has in account'.
---
To be fair, I did too, until i saw a youtube video and re-read the email that was on the screen.
---
I want to see some more wastelandy build options. It's the nuclear apocalypse and there are hostile mutants around every corner. I don't want to build a barn.
---
I can relate. I felt like a royal tool when I noticed, haha
---
How much does perforating mag add in the way of armor penetrating? Would it be worth me putting it on my anti armor combat rifle, I do have max tank killer too.
---
That stuff doesn't qualify you to be a guard either.
---
I know. It‚Äôs not a huge thing, but it is odd that they‚Äôve removed it. I would like to see it come back eventually in this game. Especially so you know what weapon other players have equipped before you try to engage them.
---
Pop it on a carpet- the small welcome mat works fine. Then just move the carpet around where you want the shower, the shower will move with it.
---
You can find a key at the Wilson Brothers Auto Repairs

Grognaks axe.
---
I'm guessing they are saving these for when they introduce some form of faction vs faction PvP. 
---
I am pretty sure the main reason no one wants them has a lot to do with hardly anyone wanting the PvP lol
---
40% according to another redditors damage testing
---
I dunno I think it's kinda funny that my 10mm is as big as my leg.
---
For me can Betheada acknowledge that the .308 used in an LMG is not the same .308 used in the hunting rifle. I love the look and sound of the LMG, but dann that .308 is expensive.
---
Same for that the .50 round in the MG is not the same as used in the sniper rifle.
---
The .45 in the lever action would not be the same in the handgun.
---
Since the handmade rifle resembles an AK could is use 7.62 instead of 5.56.
---
Ammo could use an overhaul period. Ammo crafting would be nice too (make hollowpoints, exploding, AP, high velocity, etc)
---
Gimme that *PING*, B!
---
I need that *PING*!
---
Mass hysteria 
---
When I run across those asshats I just thumbs down and keep walking.
---
And here I was thinking of dark souls 
---
Well, by physics are cruel, I meant simply that it's difficult as fuck. From watching a few streamers (EJ_SA specifically), it seems if you're competent? The physics are great haha.
---
That's a good idea too! 
---
This is what I have said since day 1. I want faction build packs. Flags, barricades, decorative items. 
---
I just want to wear BoS combat armour, with my T-60 with Paladin paint, in my BoS fortress. 
---
40%! I'll be over 100% anti armor then! Idk if I should bother with it then
---
More enemies and more difficult enemies? Sign me up. 
---
I know Nuclear Winter is suppose to be hardcore but i need it now. 
---
Honest question, if Bethesda is thoroughly going through his case why dont they reactivate his account on their side and take screen shots of his inventory to put this to bed once and for all? 
---
Like banning a player that loyal looks really bad for bethesda so i bet they really want to prove he was lying about not having more than 100,000 items at once, and they can very easily by just logging into his account, right? Why havent they done this? 
---
You could put a swift magazine that does 30% plus reload speed
---
Maybe, but it was a nice area. Nice small body of water, rocks surrounding the water, possibly near the lighthouse. Its been driving me bonkers for a while. 
---
Thanks for adding me in-game. Looking forward to seeing you online. :D
---
Definitely not working as intended. Ever since the last patch those things have been tearing me up and just glad im not the only feeling the same.
---
Yeah, I guessed it was more like salvaged door parts from somewhere else being repurposed
---
My damage resist is only 300 unyielding bloodied melee builds and I don‚Äôt die too easily. Gotta get used to taking out specific enemies as you work the mob and try not to miss any swings.  I also use the lifesaver perk card
---
Scariest would probably be the Feral Ghoul Roamers. They have like spikes for arms, leap at you like a crazy possessed zombie and stagger my sentinal build and make me cry radiation. 
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that, I have it on already because of the extra ammo and reload speed. Wow, so I ignore 100% of enemy armor nice!
---
Instead of locking the door I just replace the door with a wall. No door to pick the lock on. Just a wall which only the owner can remove. But I leave mine open for visitors. The only thing they are bad about is leaving the door open. Of course that could be the mole rats doing that.
---
I always killed that dude. Fuck him.
---
no, you have the Homemade with drum to fill that role.
---
They need to fix weapons first. The way new weapons are introduced and how they're modded are both hilariously broken.
---
I miss the personal vaults from F3/NV. Wondering if they will ever have them in F76.
---
so the homemade should use .308 then?
---
This is a pretty good idea, maybe have a perk card that allows storm to show up on map. 
---
I don't see a whole lot of hate here or on Anthem subreddit. Most people quit without a word. Some rant and rage for a while and then quit. For a game they paid up to $60 for or more. I unistalled the other day after an infinite load screen. I just had enough of it. I watch some streams, peoples game freezing, crashing, people losing their best armor piece randomly disappearing, and I don't get it why they put up with it. I did for a while and I loved the game, and would play if I could, but I just can't handle those kind of interruptions and bugs. I won't be buying Anthem in the foreseeable future. Will be playing Division 2 open beta this weekend. Looking forward to it. Hope it doesn't frustrate and disappoint me like Fallout 76 has.
---
Yup, figured it out at like 50 hours
---
I feel bad after my lead ore runs. I often smelt 400 ore with my 3* super duper perk. I am surprised that I haven't crashed a server yet. Sorry y'all. 
---
This man gets it. 
---
Psn? 
---
Pc
---
As other response stated: Bethesda will release limited time atom shop items again because it will bring in revenue. 
---
I played since beta and still playing nearly everyday. If you are a real fallout fan and you can tolerate some bugs and glitches you will enjoy it. Also goodluck! 
---
Pretty much. A 7.62√ó39 for the homemade and a 7.62√ó51 link for the LMG would be great. 
---
I need to buy a few, psn YOCupcakeKilla 
---
A strong enemy poses a challenge?! Game is broken guys it's obviously a bug
---
I would like to at least see a return of the PPK (Redeemer? Defiler? I always forget the name) from Fallout 4, since they already have it made and everything. Even better if they made it .38 calibre.
---
It's weird that we have 3 revolvers, 3 shotguns, 3 pipe weapons, 4 black powder weapons, 2 grenade launchers and 1 pistol.
---
The more, the merrier. It would make the buying of mods a much bigger deal since we would find less of each weapon to scrap.
---
I take them often and have a couple hundred hours in. I have only had one contested. It was the munitions factory. No one is PvPing for them because they are pretty much worthless in their current state.
---
I tried on a small rug and it wouldn't work, maybe I need to get the welcome mats and try that. 
---
Gotcha just went to store real quick , got list of serums needed.  ? So I can pull out stash 
---
Wait what????  Oh, fuck your gotta be kidding me.  I gotta check this.
---
People complains to be camp griefed but they continue to camp in popular area like Whitespring. I have 930 hours for now and my camp was destroyed only once... When I was based near silo alpha.
---
Move on to better hidden location. This is a survivalist game after all, don't you forget? 
---
Hope you get your back fixed. Been dealing with that for several years now myself.

I think the previous Fallouts were auto. Anyways. I was around 150 hours when I found out 
---
Few flaws with your reasoning though... 
---
1. Pretty sure Bethesda hasn't said specifically how the sweep works. So you're just reading a generalized statement like the rest of us then viewing it a certain way.
---
2. Why the heck would anyone be moving 20k of one type of ammo around that much. It makes no sense. Even if you were shuffling for swaps, why 20k over and over? 
---
3. If that's what the dude was doing why didn't he say that directly earlier? I don't recall him saying "I moved 20k ammo repeatedly, maybe that's why" in response to the ban. I recall him saying he just didn't remember ever having a lot of ammo. 
---
4. Assuming all these things somehow didn't matter, you've still completely ignored the 200k+ ammo that was cited on his second account. So you're saying he shuffled around 20k ultracite ammo over and over and for some reason was also shuffling around another 200k ammo for his \*alt\* account? Picking it up and just dropping it on the ground for fun? lol.
---
It's a pretty big stretch dude. I don't exactly disbelieve the OP, but I don't believe him at his word either, and I don't see a point in imagining up scenarios like this to try to explain his possible actions. In the end this is really between him and Bethesda if there's no actual hard evidence to be offered. 
---
Is anyone selling serums on PC???
---
I know this is an old post but I just googled info on pruned receiver and this came up. So my question is, if I have the option on the mid menu to build the prime receiver on my lever action then that means I got the plans somehow and can build it? Given the correct flux etc. 
---
The movement for the ghouls in the more recent games is absolute nightmare fuel. I hate it. Stop lurching towards me! go away!

To the best of my knowledge they stack multiplicatively, not additively.

Is the Vault what pc'ers call their mother's basement?
---
How were you able to vats crit the sniper? Are you telling me he wasn‚Äôt sneaking?
---
Pro-tip: Don't waste your budget with useless turrets. 
---
I hardly ever take them. I'm 400 hours in. I don't want to PvP. The people that contest the workshop aren't looking for the workshop, they're looking for PvP. 
---
Yeah need the small rectangular carpet.
---
Publicly revealing they treated his case as special looks bad for others who were banned. Publicly revealing that they need to prove every ban case is genuine looks bad on them in general.
---
There's no reason for them to do anything but ignore this until it goes away. Which is exactly what most studios would do... 
---
Nope, I was afraid of that too, but he was trying to move in quickly. He most likely didn't expect my exact position, but he tried to get his own advantage point. Had he came in crouching, then I wouldn't be able to crit him and most likely, he would have had me.
---
Sorry, was a long loading screen.
---
Right? I started with 3, but I don't remember having to hit Y
---
*Right?!*
---
You were banned cause you used an exploit that got people banned. Stop trying to get sympathy by sharing shit about your life, dude. It sucks, but you have to take responsibility for your own actions. Do better.
---
It is on the dpad wheel, it's called favorite and it is assignable. 
---
As a Heavy Gunner, can I say no to this motion. I like having different weapons for different ammo. .308, .50, 5mm. 
---
Besides the MG42 is not a commando weapon. This weapon needs support (bipod) but in the fallout universe these are supported with Power Armour.
---
I've been hoping for the Rainbow Axe from Wasteland. 
---
I said screw it for sleep and he/she leveled me up 4 more! You make this game fun max
---
You put items, like weapons and chems and and even pa, in the favorite wheel and it is fully customizable
---
You can absolutely do this but this easy solution doesn't involve whining so I'm not sure op is up to it
---
What about scout armor? 
---
Fool me once, shame on you.
---
Yeah that makes a lot of sense, I guess it would set a bad precedent. thanks
---
Is that the orbital strike?
---
Can I get a Gourmand flag?  I find it humorous to eat other players during PvP. Even share cannibal so my teammates can do so as well. 
---
The only thing is - isn't this a dev room item? I had it, scrapped so I have the plans but have been scared to spam it to sell. 
---
While wearing a hazmat suit? This is some serious heresy.
---
Yep. In WW2 when their real life counterpart was originally deployed by the nazis, it was, like most machine guns, crew served with the weapon, mount, and ammo spread between a few soldiers or used in defensive positions where it's bulk and the weight of its ammo were not an issue.

karma is a concept that doesn't apply moving forwards, it only applies to the past you bring with you. that is to say, karma is all the shitty stuff you've done \*in past lives.\* this means that being born when and where and how one is, that is one's karma. doing shitty stuff in this life will degrade your next life (according to those that actually ascribe to religions that have this worldview, of course) but will have no impact on their current stage of life.
---
if you want an appropriate religious message to attach to your destiny-of-vengeance, the rule of three will do you fine.
---
On in 15 I‚Äôll add 
---
https://i.imgur.com/sDK4Inv.png
---
1) "We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred thousand) of one or more rare in-game items within 30 days of game play." Is the words they used. So, yeah we do know how they got the number it is written in the words 'has acquired'
---
2) The 20k was an example for math reasons. to show how numbers can add up quickly without confusing people. But thanks for proving that people are too easily confused to have any examples at all.
---
It could have been he had multiple characters, one that had all the crafting perks unlocked and in use that he used to *make* the ammo and a different character that had all the weapon perks for fighting mobs and using the ammo.
---
For all i know he had a third character with SBQ fighting weapons that needed the ammo at other times. Why multiple characters with different perks when you can just swap them around? because you have limited perk unlocks per level, or maybe for roleplaying reasons. (you know, the thing people do in a *roleplaying game*, having different characters with different builds playing... differently...)
---
3) ... because I used 20k as an... example maybe?? And he did admit to moving stuff via a mule character, which I will note I did not find forbidden in the ToS for FO76... 
---
In fact, in his [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/) he has made an edit stating he thinks he was banned for *exactly* what I have just said, and that he moved stuff between characters while deciding what gun to use on which character.
---
Why would someone with 2 accounts have multiple characters for storage? I don't know, maybe it has something to do with a low *STORAGE LIMIT* and possibly having to shuffle stuff between alt characters to keep it organised how they like it. 
---
Obviously you don't play like that, doesn't mean no-one does.
---
4) why would second account have a larger number? wow, someone who admitted that he had lots of friends would of course never ever hold anything for a friend. nor, god forbid, store anything temporarily while they swapped characters or were needing a mule back to town.
---
Also, I never said *he* dropped and picked it up for fun, I said *I* could do it and technically *acquire* that much. (presuming I could make ultracite ammo, which doesn't appear in my tinker bench craft ammo area...)
---
And I would be *thrilled* for Bethesda to sort it out, but considering it took them 10 days to even look at my canvas bag application and then they claimed I would have my 500atoms within 'a couple of days,' and it took them just shy of 2 months to actually add a second reply to the ticket saying the atoms have been added to the account (and a further week for them to actually appear in game) the fact they are ignoring the problem as he claims, is a very real possibility to me.
---
I tried getting automod to do it. The titles are too varied to accurately catch them. 
---
I just remove them manually now. 
---
I tried the regular small rectangle and the welcome mat small rectangle, might be doing something wrong. 
---
I'm not feeling particularly sympathetic tbh. Maybe you can find a more productive way to use your time. You're pretty divisive. I hope things get better for you, but I'm also frustrated in how this whole thing has played out
---
Be very careful with that bug. I had something similar happen and I scrapped the duplicate power armor pieces. When I did that I picked up my power armor and left the bugged duplicate chassis sitting. When I put down my good chassis, it was now empty. Fortunately I only scrapped a few pieces of raider power armor though.
---
Model as well, they are left overs from fallout 4
---
If not can someone tell me how I can..?
---
My spot, is overlooking whitespring got just enough space for 5 med purifiers or 3 large ones, encloseable, and never have i had to move because it was occupied has a tent couple scorched bodies right next to a little pond. Great over look to lob artillery on whitespring! 
---
The pond guy can spawn legendary? Damn, I need to server hop more.
---
"Fallout4/76's" obsession with weapon modding is perfectly fine. Before we get new weapons, how about additional mods for the existing ones that **don't** have them? The LMG and single-action revolver are in sad places right now, and they don't need to be!
---
I always carry around some salt for such situations!
---
I have a friend that has some sort of sixth sense for finding paper bags. When we're playing he'll say he found a bag with something awesome and it's usually wtf how do you keep seeing those. He always tries to make sure no one is around though. He doesn't like taking other players junk, just has amazing paper bag radar haha. Picked up another player's junk one time and he chased them down to give it to them 
---
Im talking about shitty performance for anything thats of any meaningful scale. Or the physics lag with docking ports or the broken landing legs or work on features requested by the community. Instead they release DLC.

Looks like Nukacrypt just put it up, so hopefully you didn't give up yet: 46949774

CPU: Intel Core i5-6600K 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen 3 1300X 3.5 GHz or equivalent.

OS: Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required)

THIS. I hate that people get their panties in a knot when you kill them and try and take a PUBLIC workshop. Gets me every time.
---
Not seeing any particular reason why you wouldn't be able to, unless your box is already having issues.  Just make sure to install the launcher on your larger drive, not your SSD.  My video card doesn't meet the minimum requirements, but I can run the game just fine.  I just don't run the display at the max settings.
---
Here you go: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/258/](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/258/)

Fuck that. Nerfing bravos was ok, but you leave those murder-bots alone.
---
In any Fallout? The Abominations from F3‚Äôs Mothership Zeta dlc. Grey Alien/Human hybrid, truly the stuff of nightmares 
---
This all sounds familiar. The neg karma, the odd trading tactics, the PS4...too familiar. 
---
I say no to this. The weapon is based off the MG42. Its a heavy weapon. Its on the lighter end of heavy weapons but its still a heavy weapon. 
---
Thank you so much. I almost did
---
You know how they got to *colonel*? They killed their way up to it.
---
Your interpretation (and it IS an interpretation) of the meaning of 'acquire' is still as unproven as I said it was 20m ago. Acquire could easily mean he did actually have 140k *total* ultracite saved up on one character that he had *acquired* over 30 days. It's not possible for you to make a definitive 'this is what it means' call here because it's a wording that swings both ways and you're not the one who wrote it...
---
Your responses all add up to a lot of possibilities and rare occurrences. Maybe he farmed a crapload of rare ammo... then swapped it back and forth a lot in huge quantities... possibly because of alt specs and crafting... and carried a huge amount for his friends for whatever reason... 
---
Or, maybe he just duped. There's no evidence to support all these speculations, and I tend to prefer Occam's Razor in a 'he said, she said' scenario. 
---
I won't commit to branding the guy over it and I certainly don't support anyone crap talking him. But I also think anyone readily believing him is either nursing a grudge against Bethesda or naive. 
---
OP, what you are suggesting just doesn't work. The workshops give tons of resources, acutally balanced so multiple players could reasonably share them. and are intentionally supposed to be PVP zones. There are few areas in the game where this is the case, and specifically it makes the most sense here since the workshops are designed to be created to both get loot and defend from intruders (including other players).  
---
There are points throughout the world where your camp can actually gather the same resources (with the exception of special ones), obviously its generally just one node though, so the argument you can't get some of these resources with ought them doesn't hold water.  
---
If you take a public workshop, someone else no-longer can take it. With-ought pvp, are you just suggesting it should be first come first serve? They fundamentally are not designed with that in mind. While I might concede that the current method does need a bit of tweaking, its still relativity fair. The attacker can stealth and maybe get a cheap shot off, but that advantage is lost when you re-spawn and get back into the zone.  
---
If you don't like PvP, don't take public workshops. They aren't your personal bases, so take your own advice and pull your head out of your ass.
---
If it turns out they were wrong, hopefully they have the moral fibre to fess up and lift the ban. That's about all we can hope for. :/
---
Visual cues? Mk 1 eyeball, you commie bastard! Audio cues? Listen for derisive references to yourself, you commie bastard!
---
Yes most of the game breaking glitches have been fixed. The only issue I have now is disconnects and that relates to my crappy internet company.
---
And no word of a lie I know this for a fact as my router lights show if I‚Äôm connected to the net or not.
---
There is one other glitch that I have noticed but it only effects other team players and how they see you. 
---
If you spawn into an environment at the same time as someone else you can have issues. 
---
But not game breaking. The latest patches have fixed things dramatically. 
---
Yeah, means sentry boys need a massive fucking buff.
---
D2 lol
---
Nah I played DayZ. Legs broke but we dont know where the shooter is? Guess youre bleeding out my dude. We will meet you on the coast. 
---
There's a sewer under the road north of watoga that you can build in.  It's kinda glitchy, so everything floats down there.
---
ITT: *carebears...carebears, everywhere*
---
Don‚Äôt go in too heavy handed, I like to build a little sniper tower there minus the turrets.
---
The better solution would be to populate and make other areas worth farming rather than nerf this one.
---
Watch some streams, and see how long before they encounter some bug, freezes, crashes, infinite load screen when fast travelling or zoning in/outside of a building, disconnections, black screen hud from fast travelling, their best items vanishing, etc. If you can "tolerate" some bugs as some people put it, then fine, but many people can only tolerate that for so long. And if you don't think this stuff is game breaking, then I don't know what to tell you, except, go pick up just about any other AAA game, that doesn't have any of these kind of issues, and then say this is acceptable. But sure if you can get it for like 75% off or something, why not.
---
Yes. 
---
It‚Äôs over. 
---
You will be banned 
---
In that case I have a potato gun for you
---
You are correct sir, they had a pump action in the days of cowboys. I recently did a little research on my sons behalf while he was playing some mode in fortnite. But personally I think the original set up you said ( single action, double barrel, lever action) would seem like the most iconic. 
---
Not trying to nitpick but AKs are classically chambered in 7.62x39, a Russian caliber, .308 is the same thing as 7.62x51, a nato round, much more powerful, also used for deer hunting.  But hear you the caliber swapping in this game between guns doesn't make much sense.
---
I'm guessing the .45 is supposed to be .45acp since the lever gun shoots it, as well as the revolver, it's like the old cowboy combo, but it is strange to have the combat rifle shooting the same pistol caliber.  Some ARs are chambered in .45 acp but it's a gimmick used by women and kid shooters, not any military.
---
And then the machine guns in .308/.50 (.50 bmg presumably?) doing way less dammage then their bolt-gun counterparts in the same caliber?!  Since they fire the same round, you'd think they'd keep the same dammage but then have the trade-off be that the recoil is much higher and the accuracy way less.  
---
Everything? Literally every tab is empty?
---
Unlikely to get banned if you did it once without intending. 
---
Don't try to do it again and submit a bug report and you'll be fine. 
---
Thx for great and fast service :)
---
From any quest in the Divide. Problem is there aren‚Äôt many. I got a plan from One Silent Night, but ive run 20+ since and not gotten another yet 
---
I think of Cartman yelling, "maaaahm poooop!"
---
Well, the Handmade reminds me of the Swedish AK-5 I used in the army, and that one did use 5.56, so I have always been fine with this.
---
I am guessing the Handmade is based on the  **Type 56-4** Chinese rifle, which uses 5.56 in real life. A bit odd of course since most of the Type 56 rifle variants uses 7.62, but still correct.
---
There is absolutely no way I'd be spending money on another account if what you said happened really happened.
---
Truth is... the game was rigged from the start.
---
I will nuke you
---
God damn it, I meant the perk that gives you more ammo
---
I know, I didn't know for the longest time either
---
I am new to FO76 (level 12) and i have no idea about half the things you mentioned, but heck that sounds awesome!
---
Hi! Replying to this a little late because it took me a while to find it. Just wanted to note that I find it interesting these items are in a dog house near an area wild mongrels spawn. 
---
People have been straight up disgusting to those who were banned, it's not only sad, it's enough for most of them to never want to pick the game back up. It's like they want the servers be lonely so they can fulfill their dead world fantasy more I guess.
---
It's a damn shame how you were treated, and the silence of Bethesda on the matter, while not unexpected, is frankly unacceptable. A year ago Bethesda was seemingly loved, but this is gonna tarnish their name for a long time company, especially if they continue course like this.
---
Game is basically being given away at this point. It's insanely cheap for a 3 month old title. 
---
Lol u will get there.

Hi - "Medicine Stick", Please! (Brush Gun / .45-70)
---
Yeah, I've got the one for pharmacy stuff, and I didn't realize it for the longest time. Total face-palm moment when I figured it out. LOL
---
I'm sure they'll add it. I'm sure it will have all of 3 rounds over the extended mag.
---
It is, at least on Xbox it is: open wheel, select section, RB to change / select what to put on that section.
---
Wow, it's like reading a novel, like Dark Tower  or something.  A fallout fan-fiction novel. 
---
Especially if it's a player and they walk up to you and execute you while it's doing that
---
I have my C.A.M.P placed on a range near it with no defenses. I‚Äôve made the purpose of my base to be for other players to resupply. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen a base be a problem here. 
---
PLASMA CASTER
---
I really just wanted to highlight that, its my favourite gun out of all Fallouts.
---
Thanks for listing Fo1 and 2 weapons, theres so much I miss in that list. I'll re-install in a heartbeat if we got any and all of those.
---
Xbone sells for 200 :0
---
This. And the way the pointed at you and screamed then charged. Gives me shivers just thinking about it.
---
I think we're onto something
---
I will sometimes take a workshop and only defended it from npc attacks just for the plans they can give.  I don't try to protect them more than simply the resources that are available from the workshop and if someone takes it from me so be it.  I dont carry any junk other than what I pick up playing during the time I own the shop though.  I don't load up on guns to make room in my stash because I don't usually get attacked and dont worry about it.  Hope this answers some questions.
---
Ok i need a full tour now. 
---
While I focused on getting x01 armor, I can tell you I focus on resource building and not getting squashed like a cockroach. I am not a strong player at my level 45, but I feel more squishy than someone who attributed perk cards better or invested in farming a better weapon. It's just how I play and how I like to play. 
---
Now if we did a tour of CAMP, I feel like I win, hands down. üòÅ
---
Just make anything marked as a favorite, un-droppable  /  un-scrappable.
---
I've scrapped weapons / armor / clothing I did not intend to . . .
---
How do you know things like this? 
---
Definitely helps, but it sure sounds like you're at least thinking about the risk of having too much junk on you while you take a workshop. Also makes sense if your exposure to PvP is that limited, just using excavator does make sense.  
---
I've gotten around 200 pounds of high quality junk at once from people who are in workshops using excavator, and it just baffles me every time.  A little bit of random scrap I get not worrying about, but like 50 aluminium scrap, 20 ballistic fiber, 200ish lead, plus a bunch of other assorted junk just seems to me like that kind of load you should not be carrying if someone could kill you and take it. 
---
I think Bethesda will have an easier time clipping PA into already existing ghoul skins or adding additional textures to the Scorched model and buffing the stats. 
---
Cap collector, scrounger, pharma farma, and butchers bounty all use that mechanic.
---
I mean, that's totally cool. Don't get me wrong, I don't look down on players who can't/don't get themselves to be less squishy, more that I'm surprised players don't do risk assessment when looking at taking workshops. 
---
I'd love to see paper bags get a flag over them, like map icons on turrets and the like. Let me know who they belong to. I want to know who to thank when I find a bag of spare plans and food, or who to apologize to if I accidently grab someone';s junk that died.   
---
Wow, that is a lot of money for a mid range gaming PC. You could have built one yourself that has a RTX 2080, Ryzen 7, and NVME RAID for that price.
---
* Capture workshop
---
* Flag for PvP
---
* Wow why are these cowards PvPing me?
---
I feel like the way workshops were used and battled for changed recently, I think people were used to playing without any contenders. It's an attitude change, but I've noticed the difference on PS4. I think people also fill their stash with shit thinking they can place it in their camp or trade it later. 
---
Im glad you enjoyed it. Fallout generates loads of content to write about it and I love to write.
---
Good material to work with.
---
So wait, you're claiming that shelves aren't using your budget? Because they absolutely DO use budget. Either you're bugged or you're yanking chains (and evidently it's working).
---
What you posted in that pic is entirely doable with a normal camp budget. I count maybe 200 shelves there and we can actually get over 300 of those low cost items. 
---
Do you have suggestion on a PC 
---
I‚Äôve been thinking of upgrading 
---
haha, great story! We should hang out again soon, I want to see what else you've discovered on your travels :)
---
I'm at level 80 and burned about 16 cards initially on weight reduction and making food/drink more beneficial and the rest went into a rifleman build .  Now even level 65-68 enemies take about 7-8 shots with the handmade all decked out to take out and I'm constantly scrapping for ammo and I'm really wishing I would have taken my build on a different direction now.  
---
I bought the a 2nd copy for my son but he doesn't play and we have a 2nd Xbox so am thinking about storing all my piles of ammo, chems and legendaries on his account character and can ditch all my weight  reduction cards in favor of ones that produce more dammage but still debating continuing with this character or taking it in the shorts and starting over.
---
What is your price range? What do you have now?
---
My first encounter with the reavers in Fallout 3 was freaky and very challenging. For FO76, probably the Yao Guis (bears) because their melee attack spamming can drag you down with having much opportunity to defend yourself. If I catch them off guard I can OHOK them but if they spot me I'll be in for a good fight.
---
Radium &amp; Combat rifles don't have drums either and it makes me very sad.
---
Uhh not sure really haven‚Äôt thought much about it
---
I only thought about upgrading like a week ago
---
&gt; And why would they fight each other?
---
Competition for food, I guess! The wendigo is a supernatural creature created through cannibalism, not a species per se. I'd tend to think that having started off as such profoundly antisocial people to begin with, they probably don't get any less-selfish in their transformed state! 
---
Just another day in the wasteland lol.
---
What PC do you have now? For $1500 you could buy a 2080 Ti, but if you have an 8 year old Celeron then that would be a bad upgrade path. 
---
One of the things I love about wendigos, from a game design standpoint, is that horrible, distinctive raspy breathing they do, which you can hear from some distance away. You'll be scouting out an area, hearing that horrible heavy breathing and know that there's one waiting, crouching, *SOMEWHERE* but not knowing where until it jumps you! 
---
I‚Äôve just been thinking about buying a pre-built one 
---
Any suggestions there..?
---
I can see that. Before people would barricade the workshop so no-one could physically contest it, now that it can be done anywhere there isn't a method to stop people from initiating the pvp in the first place (not that there should be).   
---
Maybe I'm just a paranoid guy, but ever since launch I habitually store all my junk so that I can't have it looted from me if I die.   
---
As for using their stash for saving things, I totally get that, but if you're using excavator to basically increase the amount of stuff you can horde, wouldn't it make more sense to carry things that you don't drop on death? Like the weapons and armor you're saving to sell? Maybe I'm out to lunch, but it sure seems like the safer course of action.
---
Instead of monitoring workshop integrity , would it be possible for the developers to measure damage output of the player and flag it at a certain value? If they assailant continuously provides a high value regardless of individual item health, can that be flagged as a "wanted" action? 
---
For me, I only acquire workshops that have materials I desperately need and then I will go and scavenge for that material, too. Always have a back up plan.
---
Personally I feel lie favouriting something should make it unsellable and undroppable like a quest item feel like thats the safer way to go. But something like this does need to be implemented
---
The fact that you immediately go into a sob story about how much your life sucks tells me that you're full of shit and not innocent.
---
I saw a news article about this the other day, and wondered how tf someone could've played 900 hours of a three month old game. Perhaps you should have a good think about how much of your time you're wasting on doing something that doesn't help improve your life. 
---
You deserved to be banned for sure. Maybe use this chance to do something productive with yourself instead of grumbling about it like a child.
---
&gt;Always have a back up plan
---
Amen. Its the post-apocalypse, if you don't have a backup plan, you're going to end up dead sooner rather than later.
---
I think it has.  I have been farming for weeks, with no luck. I do all of the horde events and the uranium fever, to no avail.
---
Or you know just shoot them with their tiny health bar lol

---
But here are prebuilt ones like you asked for and tested by Linus 
---
[https://youtu.be/VRFEr3rAizY](https://youtu.be/VRFEr3rAizY)
---
Thanks
---
Why not? If you are 'farming' Excavator is a sensible choice given that you get 4x the return from ore nodes.
---
You can take over a workshop that produces acid then go out 'n about in the wild and as long as you know where clusters of nodes spawn you can often outperform the yield of the workshop collectors for some materials.
---
Moreover PvE Excavator does just fine and PvP thanks to the... proliferation of certain weapons and armour that should have been exceedingly rare yet everyone and their cat seems to have any power armour performs pretty poorly.
---
There is also the fact that you have set out to roleplay in a certain way and you are projecting your mindset onto others.
---
You will always have an advantage on PvP because that is what you like to do and what you have geared and 'carded' yourself to do. Your setup, playstyle and mindset is likely to make a very poor 'farmer' unless you are a part time farmer part time raider in which case you will be fairly inefficient in both scenarios.
---
So, those players, by 'sucking' at PvP they are actually enabling your 'lifestyle'.
---
I do however agree that people at large have not yet internalised the manipulative nature of the core premise of the game. When Bethesda said 'the players will be the game's NPCs' that is what they meant.
---
When someone focuses on gathering resources and general PvE they are just enabling the roleplaying of people like yourself that specialise on ambushing those players and taking their resources whenever and wherever they see fit.
---
This happens whether they want it or not. The game was set this way and with every patch and every nerf they have furthered this objective.
---
The issue here is the potential imbalance that not internalising that premise brings: the game doesn't care that you want to focus on PvE and not touch PvP, it will still set you up so you can serve as entertainment for those who embrace PvP.
---
Personally I think this is an excellent scenario for Raiders. Raiders are opportunists, bottom feeders, carrion-eaters. They live for the here and now and the world's carcass is there laid bare in front of them for their pleasure and entertainment.
---
No it's an artillery piece that you can place at a camp. It produces the artillery signal grenades and functions similar to the artillery from Fallout 4 but without an NPC having to be assigned to it.
---
So I use a Tesla rifle with charged barrel. Since patch number 5, the bug has happened to me at least once a day. Between patch 4 and 5 I could not see the bug.
---
You're expecting some common people to use common sense lol 
---
Yes, my opinion as a person who invested in a rifleman build and currently level 80, my handmade and hunting rifle are weak-sauce and level 65 scorched still take about 6-7 (non-sneak attack) shots to take down. Super mutants are worse. I spend most my time collecting scrap to turn into ammo.  Even with the ammosmith and super duper maxed out, I'm constantly out of ammo because it takes so many shots to take enemies out.  
---
I can see why everyone just switched to melee which is pretty lame in my book.  Melee's benefit should be that it saves on ammo.  And yes heavy weapons are very weak, considering the weight of the items.  Buff buff and more buff; even buff the ammo crafting.
---
Now I‚Äôm just imagining a shivering waffle sausage 
---
And I get them from a dude who givee them away just asks for flux every once and a while :O
---
Thanks, I will
---
Even with ammosmith x2 and super duper x3, I'm constantly out of ammo because rifles don't do enough dammage on the equivalent enemy's level.
---
A lot of people never learn that workshops have anything to do with PvP. The ones that do very often have no idea that if someone starts taking your workshop it flags them for full damage. This one right here is why a lot of people thought bobblehead stacking lead to one shot kills even with slap damage, because if they don't engage you they don't think you can hurt them. Might just be pissed they're uninterested in PvP just wanting resources and if you'd have kept the claim going they wouldn't have stopped you. Just because someone's level is high doesn't mean they have any idea how anything really works. I rarely ever take workshops because I think PvP in this game is awful. When I do, I do it after 2 am est and make sure the server isn't too busy. 
---
Try arch on a rug on another rug. I watched a guy on YouTube stick water purifiers in foundations that way.
---
I think yes it is. I have had a lot of fun even with game breaking bugs like being stuck in the power armor frame. 
---
Good fun, especially with friends. I have joined an online group and it's probably the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game. 
---
Guve me my Buzz Bites god f@#$% dammit!!!
---
Just saw the proof screenshot picture. I noticed something weird, the lv 293 rewarded you with +293 caps, the lv 103 with bounty 5 caps only rewarded you with 5 caps? I thought you'd get 103 (level) + 5 (bounty) = 108 caps total. Same goes with the last dude Lv 118 with a bounty of 10 caps only rewarded you with 10 caps?
---
It feels like the bounty is some kind of protection for pvping or did I just miss something from the screenshot?
---
I've had this happen to me, lots.
---
I usually stumble upon the corpses in their spawn locations though, so I figure it's just a server issue.
---
Do you mean Polowski's Preservation Chambers?
---
So somewhere in the swamps would be good. There is a giant waterfall location, can be a bit difficult to build on, but very beautiful. Also there are platforms around trees that you can build a treehouse around
---
Unfortunately the only datamined stairs have been metal, but they looked cleaner/better structured
---
acquire(Receive), verb accept, achieve, adipisci, adopt, be given, come into possession of, derive, gain, glean, obtain, reap, take in, win.
---
The word they used has very specific meaning (which is to get something) and it doesn't mean holding or stored.
---
But, hey. Whatever man. You believe whatever you want. You want to believe acquired means 'saved' go for it.
---
No, teamed players usually stack up caps on player, so they don't lose caps when they die.
---
They put it usually on the strongest player, knowing they are least likely to die.
---

That's pretty much how you deal with a Mercy in Overwatch as well. You don't focus her down as she'll be too hard to hit, you just nuke a squishie target next to her and wait for her to try and rez, then plunk her in the head. PLUNK. 
---
Looking for Chameleon, marsupial, grounded , adrenal reaction 
---
I have seen this happen from time to time for me, mostly when the server I am on is being abit laggy.
---
Many times I have noticed that the body that disappears, gets its current location reset to its spawn in location, so look around, if you know where the mobs normaly spawn, look in that location for a corpse/blood lump.
---
I see this mostly in whitespring where I lure the ghouls to me, kill them and then walk inside, only to find some bodies that are fully lootable for me with all the loot, in the spots where I know the ghouls are spawning.
---
Level 20ish assaultron kicked my level 50 butt because I got trapped against a wall and couldn't turn around, and couldn't switch fast enough to a different weapon because I'm on PS4 and changing to another favorite weapon is a painful left-arrow followed by selecting the weapon... ah crap, went too far. try again. shit, try.. .why won't this ... dammit now I'm dead.   
---
Then I respawned, selected my shotgun, ran over and blew the assaultron's legs off. And left him there as a lesson.   
---
   
---
lol I never said it means 'saved', that's all you. I specifically pointed out that in context it doesn't have one definitive meaning. My point was that you're resting your case on several suppositions and I stand by it.
---
As for bounties, you only get their bounty plus caps for level, if they shoot back at you.
---
None of them had a chance to hit me though.
---
&gt;It has always been this way in Fallout games.  Expect the vendor to rob you like ~~a pawn shop~~ Gamestop.
---

PSN? 
---
I've only had one server drop in three days, which is dope.
---
Only other bug I've encountered is opening your pipboy before the world fully loads; doing this locks you in a blank screen and you need to restart to escape it. 
---
Other than that it's perfectly fine. Shit all to do after capping your level, though
---
can confirm.
---
The heaviest freezes occurs at Charleston and at the golf place in the tocix valley.

The interesting thing is: freezes only occur when the moster is not spawned by an event

Hey Rambo. I loved the story. No need for a video for proof. The story in itself is amusing whether true or not. But the video would add to the entertainment. 
---
Yah me too 
---
why don't you store them in your stash?
---
Im in excavator pa carrying junk, golf clothes, corn and razograin from billings homestead so i can sell to vendors for caps everyday. This is my end game. Nothing else is going on atm.
---
I hop servers to keep people from stealing my junk.
---
You can get into a locked camp w/o picking the lock if they have a workbench/couch/chair near one of theirs windows. When you click to interact it ports you to the front and into the structure.
---
Last time I dropped an orbital strike on a camp behind the club. Got a 30 caps bounty but totally worth it.
---
Most people that play this game don't want PvP plain and simple. Lots of people that take shops often think they are ready for PvP only to find that most armor and weapons are pretty underwhelming. Lots don't understand that you should dump the stuff you have collected before. PvP is pretty poorly explained and most first time players aren't ready for it. The system as is has lots of flaws but can be pretty fun if willing party engage. The are a lot of things that  need to be fixed with the PvP system though. 
---
They're literally not though, pvp is already barely a thing. If you punish people for it there's even less incentive to engage in it. 
---
I got to git gud with the video stuff. I like writing about my sweaty encounters in the wasteland, but it would definitely be better with the proper media to back it up.
---
I'd prefer to get some fixes instead of focussing on new content.
---
I did not list all variations, only the top ones. The full list can be found in the [tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wuz0Hej1N5UOeXGvXKiq6h9N-utjWjhiFdqXLvfDwu8/edit#gid=1204454237).
---
Happens at Hemlock Holes as well, when you kill the Grafton monster.  He dissapeares, except then he respawns a 2nd time and then you have to kill him again.  Same thing with the 2 snallygasters that spawn there, one dissapeares and respawns. I farm this spot for the sweet sweet acid waste and I end up having to kill them twice to get the loot.  Been happening for the past 4 days.
---
And unsellable. :-\

I just read your other story about the -karma guy. Hilarious. Keep it up mate.

These people are called A**holes! They don't want to do the work themselves so they f*ck with the hard working hoarders of post apocalyptic West Virginia....

They are there, but rare as they require 2-3* drops. With the chances so far, 1:5 - ranged, 1:9 - 2+*, 1:7 - explosive, you have **~1:315** chance to find one. I found 1 explosive in this 413 drops.
---
I have the same issue on a decent rig - and I've tried everything, including setting it on the lowest settings. It still has plenty of load stutters and the occasional freeze.
---
For me, that's not playable. Which is sad, because I actually really like the game.  
---
I don't remember these issues being this bad at launch, either.
---
If you think about it culturally, they evolved glorifying a soda pop company perhaps the alcohol per volume is lower in the FO verse

That would be handy to be able to see if they are coming back. I know when I die I head straight for my stuff.

But Beth needs to do more stability improvements in nuke zones first. Seems like the servers already can't handle all that's happening, adding flags to the bags would probably crash us faster üòì

Hmmm...
---
Definitely at launch. I hadn't played since launch month until about a week ago or so. It was running so smooth. 60fps? Went to the Mothman Museum area and even had some decent battles but I didn't really notice any performance issues from that short session.
---
If I remember to tomorrow and you're still wondering, I could load it up and check out some bigger areas and stuff?
---
I'm on 1X btw.
---
I think OP is saying that he likes to PVE and so do a lot of others. There are games that for free for all, trust no-one, kill or be killed like Rust or Ark. I just don't think Fallout is that for most people.
---
I'd love some actual numbers on this though.
---
Personally I PvE but would like to opt in at times for something specifically like Hunter/ Hunted. This problem with workshops is you defend against NPC and Players, so it's a weird mix of both playstyles.
---
The preservation chambers that exist in Fo76
---
&gt; You're virtually guaranteed to level up at least once if you clear out west tek.
---
lmao, on what planet?  
---
I just leveled from 171 to 172 and kept track of what it took:  
---
3 complete clears of West Tek  
---
1 complete clear of The General's Steakhouse  
---
2 Technical Data turn-ins
---
2 Scorchbeast kills  
---
This was without xp boosters, but all the xp boosters in the game aren't going to get you a level-up from a single west tek clear.  
---
So you want us to be banned from the game for killing you and taking your stuff in a pvp area? 
---
Light machine guns aren't assault rifles in any way shape or form. Squad automatic weapons is what the Light Machine Gun would fall under as it was meant to be operated by multiple people. The fire rate and ammo consumption are the main reasons it is not a single person weapon like most assault and combat rifles in this game.
---
Replace your camp, putting down the "recent" blueprint will restore all items to full(free) iirc.

Well I see your point, but I play a stealth build and prefer wood drops over any other drop actually because of the stealth benefits of the shroud mod.  I would rather them remain as a spot.

trading or dropping/picking up items does not result in suspension
---
It occurs to me that one way of doing that would be to add some of the Unarmed weapons as mods for PA arms. Want to use that power fist in power armour? Gotta build it onto the armour, or no go. 
---
I'm sure that would have some issues too, of course. 
---
Hahahaha thank you for taking your time writing this down. Sounds like a awesome PVP moment :-)
---
Upvote deserved!
---
Why would a player take the time to travel to the far north just to kill me from behind, steal my junk and then disappear of the server if it's not a thing?
---
I didn't buy this game for it's PvP functionality, it shouldn't be a thing.
---
Haha true, refreshing point of view. I was so deep just thinking engine mechanics where wendigos would be in same group.
---
I had a legendary super mutant disappear as I was fighting them outside a building. Once I was done there ‚Äúmeat piles‚Äù or whatever had spawned inside.

Might not apply to every time a body disappears but I would look around in case it was only moved.

Ptsd from gaming? If server hopping gives you PTSD then you should really reassess your life.

I had two, one for random ppl and one hidden for me in case a trolly molly came to break it. After 1 finally did I started to stash it too, until one day I got disconnected and it vanished. I was beyond mad and stopped playing for a bit because this was on top of running into a bug where I couldn't even place foundation without it giving me an error saying it didnt exist. 
---
TLDR - Be careful with stored items, the bugs in the game are just as much griefers. 
---
Great story üëç. Where can i find those builds ( and others) you mentioned?
---
Yep, having trouble comprehending the written word as well as making friends?
---
There is absolutely no requirement to murder someone from behind like a fucking coward.
---
The game already has plenty of weapons. They just need balancing so people aren't literally all using the same 2-3
---
I did exactly the same, it was so creepy how it crawled out. I felt so grossed out. 
---
If you want to check it, that would be cool. I'm quite sensitive to those things, and maybe it's not something everyone would notice. I'm talking about small "pauses" and hitches when moving around - especially near towns. The freezes happen infrequently (maybe once every 20-30 minutes).  
---
I have access to both consoles, so if there's one version that doesn't suffer these issues - I might test it out.

That's annoying. I was wondering about that myself. I'm doing an unarmed build and picked up a level 50 anti-armor power fist. I was planning on spending my next few perks on "incisor" with a happy fantasy of getting 100% armor penetration with both. Even so, 75% ain't bad.

Can see there are varying opinions on this one. Will share the thread with the team in any event so they're aware!

What about the house and the barriers and whats inside the house and all the shelves

He always comes up to me at the best/worst times. I'll be fighting 18 super mutants with my buzz blade and hes like... 
---
*Bass boosted* CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
---
The player vendor machines are announced and will be coming eventually.     I assume those will show all values on the items.
---
Not 100% 'as intended'.
---
I think the spirit if them is you are fighting for control of resources. I guarantee you that people taking workshops don't care about owning them and are just looking for a cheap kill so they are using mechanics to trigger a one sided fight.
---
As a defender turrets are useless against players, so it would be good that building up walls and setting traps in doorways etc can be a fun way to create a more interesting encounter at the very least because they would have to fight through those to get to the workshop.
---
Welcome to Appalachia Friend. Most players are friendly, so if you see someone coming towards you they‚Äôre most likely trying to give you something they don‚Äôt need.

weapon: Bloodied vat crit damage 50% hunting rifle.

I have tank killer, better critical, bloody mess, maxed rifle perks, eagle eye, and adrenal reaction. Also scaly skin, marsupial, healing factor and speed demon.
---
I run with 20% health and depend on a chameleon armor as my only form of defence. 
---
I just crouch and snipe.
---
As for the other builds, i know how to counter them, but i do not have much knowledge as how to set them up.
---
It's like living in a cheese grater
---
Those assholes are the human raiders... Form a posse and hunt them down
---
Would be cool to have doors made out of car doors!  Or fridge doors!
---
Power armor super mutants!!! Smart super mutants! I want to fight Frank Horrigan again!
---
What you fail to understand is this simple truth, Zenimax the parent company is unwilling to put the ‚Äúservice‚Äù in their ‚Äúgame as a service‚Äù.
---
Service has costs, corporations are trying to drive profits, increasing costs do not help profits.
---
Getting upset at Bethesda devs or the few community reps will have ZERO effect. Whether you are innocent or guilty has no relevance.
---
If we make up an imaginary figure, say 500 players banned for any reason, it is simply easier to suspend them all and try to work it out through code fixes, than it would be to hear out each persons story on a case by case basis.
---
Letting people have ‚Äútheir day in court‚Äù simply costs time and effort.  You could have spent ‚Ç¨1000 over the course of the game, but not everyone does.  And the cost in Human Resources outweighs the profits they could make keeping YOU around.
---
I am not saying you did anything wrong, as again the simple truth is Zenimax is unwilling to put the ‚ÄúService‚Äù in their ‚Äúgame as a service‚Äù model.  Maximize profits, minimize costs.  Unfortunately for you, you were rolled into the ‚Äúcosts‚Äù
---
If you are willing to accept this truth, by all means, continue to enjoy Zenimax, Bethesda, EA and Activision games, but don't expect them to change their methods.  
---
Maybe focus your spending your money on games where the customer comes first.
---
Only a matter of time ;)
---
I know that similar suggestions have been made and shared with the dev team in the past (i.e. to lock favourite weapons) so I'll do the same with this one too! Thank you mate :)
---
TBH one of the discord groups I'm in where we regularly play together in groups base out of Whitesprings as its central but on the south lawns where nothing spawns. Every time we log into a server (a few times a night as we farm the queen a lot so switch when servers start to get really unstable) we check for camps close using guns like that and defang them. No warnings as the owners know exactly how inconsiderate it is and choose to do it anyway. Its doubly bad because the vast majority currently are totally un-populated just afk farming loot - last nights owner was in Harpers Springs so never noticed us killing their guns and generators.
---
The first time I encountered one was during the power up event in of the NPP. I was playing with a friend of mine who encountered one before. He goes down the. stairs to the control room in front of me, scream out and comes back running up the stairs hiding behind my char so I had to deal with it. They are quite scary. Personally though I find Yao Guais worse to deal with. Fast as hell and those attacks can easily overwhelm you and keep you stunned.
---
I'm counting about 60 shelves in the photo. You can get over 400 low cost items in a single build, so everything visible in this photo can be placed within the normal budget. 
---
But that's irrelevant because the fact is that shelves do use budget, I've used them before and I already logged earlier to confirm. So either the OP is bugged or messing around as I said. :-p
---
I'll join you newt341 is my ign
---
ATLAS right?
---
This is definetly not true, a friend tested it with a second account and only 12k ammo. It took 4 days but his lv2 character got banned too.
---
Performance help? Have you tried the little blue pills?
---
I look at it this way those people are acting like raiders would if there were NPC‚Äôs as there are none people are filling the niche as well it is easier to kill some1 and take their junk than it is to travel around picking it up if you don‚Äôt want to pvp don‚Äôt take a workshop or get in the habit as soon as you take put down a stash box and dump all your junk straight away so the most they do is get some caps 
---
dunno who downvoted but you're right. I'm not even mad it's just sad to see what happens to my favorite game
---
I dont do it since i dont care about pvp and i always have 750lbs of junkbin my stash . But is it not kind of part of the game? 
---
++good.
---
Thank you very much.  Everyone kept sending replies with exotic solutions and talking about "push to talk".  You answered the logical question "push what".  Your solution was correct, concise and greatly appreciated.
---
Sure
---
Future patch. They didn't say the next one. Glad they are aware of it though. 
---
Yes and no... It's kind of functional but all the fun guns have been nerfed to where it's pointless to use them.  
---
The game still feels unfinished. No real "meat" to it other than to mindlessly grind. The free doc coming soon isn't really a selling point.
---
Yao Guai still mangle me, One of my fave FO76 moments has been my friend and i running for our lives after thinking we could take three on at once 
---
And I think with most enemies that's true; super mutants are almost never seen fighting among themselves (aside from Graham, obviously), and mirelurks are always on the same team. But while wendigos seem to have some sort of symbiotic relationship with ghouls, I can easily see the designers coding them to be hostile to anything else, including other wendigos, for this very reason. 
---
Camden park it's with the tokens from the daily events there. 
---
Seconded. KSP is an absolut gem of a game. Frogs in space...
---
I wasn't that serious about it :D but in fact I avoided to enter the bunker after I got all recipes
---
What a legend!
---
Actually you get loot but not xp which is why people afk farm with them.
---
Sadly wasn‚Äôt the correct key :(
---
I dont use power armor outside of nuke zones i have more carry weight and can specialize more passive perks to help combat my negative side effects from all my mutations xD
---
I understand your doubt but the screenshot I posted is his ban notice.
---
I don‚Äôt think it necessarily has been nerfed they are supposed to be pretty hard to get the dupers just made it seem like their were a lot of them 
---
Many thanks! I‚Äôm always looking for new outfits üòÅ
---
That would actually be kinda fun if NPC raiders would pick up your junk and leave the servers. lol
---
I also one shot a lev 108 ish in excavator with my lev 35 furious the dragon with explosive bullets
---
Im lev 112 :D i wouldnt mind helping you through missions
---
I fought through many events and high star legendaries for worthless things like.. 2 star armor with crappy perk.. Or 2 star pipe guns that weren't worth the effort and ammo I put into it
---
We occasionally have one near but thats more for when someones weapons all break. That or post fight repairing while you wait 10-15 minutes for the corpses to all cough up loot. ;)
---
Oh I feel you on that. I have friends who don't even notice the different of 30fps and 60fps. I hate when it's not smooth and all that.
---
Sure thing, I can check tomorrow. :)
---
The best idea would probably be to just add both options to make everyone happy. We already can have pristine linoleum floors, so unbroken windows shouldn't be much different.
---
Joking about PTSD isn't funny. There are a lot of issues with gaming and lots of problems with Bethesda but it's something you should jokingly compare.
---
Dear Lord.. I did not know that. Couldn't be worse than finding out the secret use for the cheap ads flare gun I've been scrapping since day one. 
---
And the link I provided is Bethesda staff confirming that the account that dropped/picked up bulk of items multiple times did not get banned.
---
Imagine visiting an office, hacking into a terminal, and asking the prize bot to deliver an item from your inventory to a random player! You could either send it off with a mini nuke to kill some poor soul just having a nice day or ask it to drop stims, caps, 3* handmade, etc! It‚Äôd be cool to have it work like those (next-to-useless) supply drop request holotapes! 
---
&gt;I dont do it since i dont care about pvp
---
Which is my opinion.
---
&gt;But is it not kind of part of the game?
---
Yes, but players who immediately server hop aren't playing the game in it's intended format.
---
Fuck yeah, this is what I‚Äôm talking about. Thanks for taking the tome to make this post. I made one similar and a ton of folks didn‚Äôt like it. Check out my previous post on Raiding and Grieifng. 
---
Why didn't you use the stash box in red rocket?
---
I can just see the way this would get abused - lots of gun towers and one set of crafting etc which everyone shared.
---
Well, I kind of like having the "cleaner" building sets, but I would also like a building set that looks similar to the "shack" set from Fallout 4. It would have to fit the same sizes as the sets we already have, of course. That way you could choose if you want to build something clean-looking, something completely scrappy, or even make it look like you found a pre-war structure and built a lean-to from found materials. 
---
Variety is good, you know. 
---
I had this happen to me today to a bloated glowing ghoul. As it was falling I saw its loot table and it had a troubleshooters board on it. No great loss. But when I was searching the houses nearby I found the corpse in a standing default position and low and behold I got my board! 
---
I kept it for the comedic reference of hitting computers with wood when they break
---
well ok you're right. I'm sorry if it offended you
---
Maybe they could fix Scorched never dropping the weapon they're actually holding first..?
---
Shouldn't switching to passive keep them from killing you? Or does that only keep you from harming them
---
You know, suicide by explosives is a thing right? Even if it is accidental.
---
I'd just dump my junk, pull out a few frags and... BOOM!
---
Good idea, but the stash box means they don't have to lose anything to escape.
---
I think the use of griefers is too liberal. Not every pvp encounter is a griefer. Not every person who utilizes pvp or camp destruction is a griefer. Griefers are a step above imo. The problem is that turds justify their loss by saying, "he's a griefer,"
---
Charlestin? You mean Palestine? I don't think they have vendor bot there.
---
I think I found a lead...

We need to find something called qmaster 
---
This sounds interesting. 
---
You can try spinning yourself, instead of rotating it?
---
Usually works for me.
---
Cool, thanks! :)
---
Wait till those damned modders and hackers start roleplaying as invisible teleporting unkillable raider-god 
---
Yep you need somebody to hold the general location or it might disappear.
---
Wait....is this inspired by the Dark Phoenix poster?
---
Lol sounds like the real world hahaha 
---
You mean this?
---
&gt;Our records indicate that your wife's account is open, but yours has been suspended for numerous duped items, including more than 170K molded plastic pieces.¬†     
---
      
---
Well seens there was another reason for his ban. But that doesn't imply dropping and recollecting ammo is fine. I know for sure it's not since the friends account did nothing but drop and recollect ammo.      
---
     
---
However if your confident that you won't get banned - why not test it yourself? You wouldn't get banned right?
---
All of these would be excellent changes. 
---
4k
---
TLDR:
---
We need to be able to send a 'white glove face-slap' emote to players on the map
---
Yeah like the guy that censored posts because people were leaving. Great guy. 
---
Its true, Raiders will destroy your shit and kill you till you leave if they feel like it, but not griefers
---
Raiding and griefing are very different. Ambushing someone to get junk or loot is a valid tactic. Destroying things to be an asshole isn't raiding. Raiding implies some sort of gains through implicit means or force. Griefing or harrassing people that won't do something is very different but sadly is often an issue of the recipients response. People seem to be to hesitant to leave servers.
---
But that's not the point of this game. Nuke your neighbor, pvp, workshop battles. 
---
Probably if they have an AA weapon?
---
Pretty sure Assassin/Sentinel is a flat "Special" Damage Reduction, and AA only works against "Normal" DR.
---
I can't actually test this, as my only assassins are lvl5 wood pieces... :(
---
TSE Combat shotgun / handmade ? show me . Ill add your iGN / id .

---
It's not an AK-47, its a Type 56-4.
---
My point is, there's no position for it in heavy weapon category. You won't find any reason to use it unless you have tons of .308, which is far expensive than .50cal and 5mm.
---
It's can be a tactical advantage to suppress your enemy. C'mon, man
---
Think it's more logical to assume that your friend cheated without you knowing
---
And about that testing out myself, I don't have that many to begin with. I ain't no hoarder. I got like 40 balistic fibers of 5 bulk plastic or something. It would take me hours if not days to acquire over 100k of something. 200k ultracite ammo? pfft
---
This game is capped at 30fps on all consoles.
---
In response to the OP. From my experience on PS4 Pro, performance has significantly improved since BETA. Only the odd small hitch when loading a new cell, similar to all creation engine titles. Also a few drops in massive firefights.
---
Someone recently told me about the straight jackets, but before that I used pharma farma and I would sell my excess drugs (like 50 rad away a a time). When I'm not using pharma farma, I sell bulk junk.
---
Please don't nerf him. We need more challenging enemies like Col Gutsy. 
---
Figured so. Looked reallyyyyy nice though when I went back, wasn't sure if I was just crazy or if there was an optimization option.
---
Of course this could be true... but his main was banned before and he made a **new** account with only 1 lv2 character which only intend was to see if it would get banned for dropping ammo. And he did got banned, see screenshot.
---
I‚Äôm on XB1 using a wired connection. After patch 5, it went to THREE load screens. First one is normal. Gear spins at slow but consistent pace. Second is black screen with vault tec logo in bottom right corner. This one lasts about 30 seconds to a minute. Then third is like first but the gear in the corner is spinning a lot faster. This screen usually only lasts about 25-45 seconds. Then my character appears. My camp, however, takes about 30 seconds to fully render (assuming I‚Äôm spawning at my camp). 
---
One MAJOR glitch that I simply do not understand is when I attempt to fast travel from Watoga Shopping Plaza to Harper‚Äôs Ferry. During the first load screen, a loud click will happen and a few seconds later, the entire Xbox restarts. Not only does the game crash, but the entire console crashes. When I restart the game, my character spawns at Harper‚Äôs Ferry. 
---
To avoid this, I choose to fast travel to the Red Rocket that is adjacent to Harper‚Äôs Ferry and just walk there. Only when I attempt to fast travel to that one location does this happen. And even though I consider myself a bit of a computer geek, I simply don‚Äôt understand what causes such an extreme reaction. Only thing I can come up with is a problem with the graphical coding combined with character spawn, but that‚Äôs a stretch at best. 
---
Brilliant, thank you very much!
---
&gt; Moreover PvE Excavator does just fine and PvP thanks to the... proliferation of certain weapons and armour that should have been exceedingly rare yet everyone and their cat seems to have any power armour performs pretty poorly. 
---
Even when people use illegitimate, OP weapons, the armors I mentioned like X-01 and Ultracite give you at least some time to react, where you just can't get that with excavator. I'm sure there are weapons that even 1 shot X-01, but I sure don't have them so I can't attest to that.
---
&gt; There is also the fact that you have set out to roleplay in a certain way and you are projecting your mindset onto others. 
---
I mean, You lose your junk when you die, carrying a ton of junk doesn't make sense if someone can kill you. I'm not saying excavator can't be used, I'm saying if your putting yourself in danger, and don't have the best protection, why would you be surprised if you lose the junk you had on you? I don't expect people to play the game the same way I do, I do however expect that they use risk reward when looking at doing something. It has nothing to do with role-playing, and everything to do with protecting the things you have.
---
&gt; You will always have an advantage on PvP because that is what you like to do and what you have geared and 'carded' yourself to do. Your setup, playstyle and mindset is likely to make a very poor 'farmer' unless you are a part time farmer part time raider in which case you will be fairly inefficient in both scenarios. 
---
I mean, for the record the build I use is a stealth sniper build, no vats, and a bit of Int for weapon-smith and ammo/frame weight reduction. I made this build because in general, I have the most fun and it makes my favorite guns work very well. When you say "Farmer" what do you mean by that? And i definitely am not entirely set up for PvP, since Vats would be ideal for crits and extra damage. Personally I like the idea of making a character and then just seeing how they preform in other situations. I'm also lvl 150 so I've got pretty much the best build I can have for not vats stealth rifles. 
---
&gt; So, those players, by 'sucking' at PvP they are actually enabling your 'lifestyle'. 
---
Never said those players "suck" at pvp, I just don't understand why you would put yourself in a PvP situation and be surprised when it goes south if you're not prepared.  
---
&gt; When someone focuses on gathering resources and general PvE they are just enabling the roleplaying of people like yourself that specialise on ambushing those players and taking their resources whenever and wherever they see fit. 
---
See, but they can only be ambushed in Public workshops (for the most part). You can have an entirely PvE experience for the most part if you just don't take them. I'm not complaining that people take a ton of junk on thier person, sit around a public workshop, and get sniped from a half a click away, I'm confused why they don't take the literally 1 step to avoid losing ANYTHING OF VALUE by putting all that junk in thier stash. If you're using Excavator, you surely can just carry some guns rather than all your valuable junk that drops when you die. Even just so that if you die in PvE content and D/C before you can get your loot, you're not losing more than what you had just picked up. Or, at the very least, don't be upset if you chose to carry your valuables and lost them through a game mechanic that's pretty clear on how it works.  
---
I think maybe I wasn't articulate enough in my post, I'm not really upset with these players for doing something that greatly benefits me, I'm just more confused as to why they would allow it to happen since there are several ways to mitigate the risks.
---
It's not. You just have the problem of the "boy who cried griefer." I think as people get more comfortable with the game, pvp is increasing. I'm seeing groups forming and they'll get bigger. But there's still a large group who get slapped in game an cry over it. 
---
Like others in this thread, I'd rather have a suppressor and a reflex sight before a drum mag. Wouldn't mind a drum mag as well, but priorities... 
---
And, since we're talking about gear mods, I would *really* like to see the system of "scrap stuff to learn random mods" reworked, very thoroughly. I'm fine with a system where we have to chase mods to unlock them, but "random chance on scrap" is not a *fun* system to play with. 
---
I'd rather have a system where we learn to build the mods if we find a mod *or* the plan for one and build it, or if we find a piece of gear with the mod on and detatch it. That sort of thing would make more sense, and we would still depend on actually finding the mods in the first place.  It would however give us a greater sense of control over which mods we unlock. 
---
If they old an AMA it would just be invaded by F76 haters parroting eachother. Most valid post would just drown in the garbage.
---
I'm not offended or upset about what you said. PTSD is rough shit and dealing with dumb shit in video games isn't something that should be compared to people dying or almost dying in real life. While I've spent many, many hours dealing with ridiculous shit in gaming and can sympathize with that, it isn't anywhere near the same as almost dying or watching someone you care about die.
---
That‚Äôs literally what a griefer is tho 
---
It could work.
---
BoS vs Enclave (Military, Troops Vs Officers)
---
Responders vs Raiders (Civilian, Good vs Bad)
---
But the dmg per round is still much better.
---
Where do I can't my vote?
---
I dont know this poster
---
Yeah but theres no anger, its the point
---
GW2 had better bosses imo. 
---
Dropping it like that makes a lot of sense.  
---
Curious though....I'm new to playing as melee and am always in pa. What (and how) dmg am I losing out on by being in pa???
---
About that not having to own them at once thing... that's just an assumption from your side. Check the link I provided. A guy drops and picks up bulks of items using his wife's account and Bethesda confirms that they did not ban the account
---
Not on 76, what law?
---
I agree but how often do you read that someone or some action was 'cancer' ? I lost my best friend to skin cancer but I'm used to it often...
---
Suppression implies something to be gained though. That is mainly a squad tactic to be used with multiple people achieving a goal. Destroying someone's base after they give up just makes you an asshole.
---
That was a fun spot to find. The outfit you can find at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary. I found it on a table in the "washer room".
---
Hunt them down.... I had this happen to me once. Dude with bounty. I kill. Leave his junk. Go into map Wait for him to return. He hits me from behind takes my shit and jumps servers. Well it took a day or two. But my favorite loading screen is me standing in what's left of his mansion that is still smoldering from my artillery Strike. While he is in background crying on the mic. Vengeance with a side of salty tears. Food for the soul.
---
The last sentence is prestine
---
Isn‚Äôt the stash box per user? If you put stuff inside only you can access.
---
I think you mean a bear box or trash bin?
---
It's no assumption because he got a record of 200k+ ultracite ammo while only having 12k+. Also I think I might got banned for ammo while having not more than 30k of any ammo at once. However I won't get an answer anyway &amp; can't login to proof it...
---
Yea but if that was me irl I wouldn't just keep the broken glass like that! Id smash it all out and just board it up or something. 
---
&gt;  Lots don't understand that you should dump the stuff you have collected before 
---
That's I think the big one for me that I've been struggling to understand. Maybe I just understood because I love this game and read everything I could about it since launch. Honestly, if people do ONLY THIS, it really makes using excavator much more reasonable , as well as making losing a pvp interaction not impact you very much.   
---
If you don't want to PvP, but it is sometimes unavoidable, why not mitigate the risk you're taking? You've basically said it comes down to people being uninformed, which totally makes sense. 
---
Note custom flags too, like emblems for factions
---
They could at least make unlocking all the mods for the different weapons and armor a challenge for atoms.  That way there's some reward for it and you could check the challenge tab and see for example your hunting rifle is at 20/21 mods unlocked. 
---
Can you get the ultra cite pa plans without doing sbq?
---
We'd have to agree to disagree, there. After all, some Raider gangs are only in it to ruin other's lives or have a good time. The Pack is in it for the thrill of the hunt, the Disciples are in it to kill as many people as possible, the Fiends are just drug addicts acting on impulse. These groups gain things, suee, but their motives are certainly not just to further their wealth.
---
That's why I'm choosing to side with Bethesda. Banned users got nothing to prove their innocence but Bethesda is ready to bash your skull with actual numbers if you start funking around. Maybe that's why banned users choose to post here instead of Bethesda community. They better take advantage of their anonymity
---
Yeap, totally agree. I can sell the Holloween outfit for like 60 a pop with 4 charisma and a grape mentat. Craft them with the SD perk and they work like a dream to clear our the vendors' stashes every single day.
---
So would you carry a bunch of junk for sale, and hang out in a public workshop where you could get shot? That's my question I guess. Not that the Excavator is useless, but that if you're in a situation where another player could ghost you, wouldn't you opt to either deposit your junk or wear something that can actually provide enough DR to save you from being 1 shot?
---
In the mire south of harpers ferry where the river ends. 3-4 ticks. 
---
Exactly. The servers could handle a lot Mid January, hardly any issues but now it's right back to how it was a month or so after the release. ( Talking when fighting the Scorch Beast Queen in a nuke zone ). 
---
Daisycutter mission? Where do you get that? 
---
There is a straightforward solution, make drop types location specific in each region so you can get your preferred items and keep farming for better effects. Borderlands was better in this regard: you could farm a specific enemy known to drop a specific legendary (with a low chance). In Fo76 you have to farm everything to get something you want out of a pool of hundreds and thousands of possibilities.
---
The alternate solution is the upcoming player vending so we can pool all our drops and buy what we need. 
---
The third, is a legendary independent vendor at a fixed location, that you can have your items sold for you without exposing your camp and you could set up a notification in case a desired item shows up with them.
---
Yes you need to do the bos steel quest defiance has fallen at he end of the quest you get the ultracite armor and the plans all in one . You will need to fight a scorch beast at the end of the quest though but it‚Äôs not a queen . 
---
Mods will be limited to private servers (apparently?) and I'm sure hackers will be dealt with swiftly. But... I do see your point. If I justify _some_ bad behavior, I inadvertently justify _all_ bad behavior.
---
You should give West-Tek a couple runs.  
---
The first time I ever discovered the location, I ran into a bunch of legendary mutants inside and out.  
---
My awe brought friends, and with friends came more legendary mutants.  
---
It was a good day for everyone.
---
I love it. Although, I would be Free States!
---
I believe unprovoked PVP through the use of exploits and vastly overpowered weapons to kill a player over and over again or destroying a person's CAMP while they're not there is certainly a griefer. True, not all PVPers are griefers, but then again, I never insinuated as such in the first place. Or I didn't mean to, and apologize if it seemed as such, I'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to typing stuff lmao
---
I also don't generally use PA, however I'm not surprised if I get 1-2 shot by literally any rifle that exists. High risk, high reward.
---
That would be great. I'll have quick look today when I log in if not I'll message you. Thanks :)
---
You can't use bonuses from legendary armour pieces and under armour, as well you can't use fist weapons like death claw gantlet or power fist. For bloodied build with unyielding legendary set it can be lost of 23 strength... And that's a lot of dmg for melee build.
---
I am sorry to hear that truly. I've lost some people very dear to me because of cancer as well. Set a different tone when you can. We often get so rapped up in online shit that we forget to have fun and enjoy the good times. 
---
While I'm fine with the Atom store for the most part, things like Faction flags are the sort of stuff I would vastly prefer as unlocks for ingame accomplishments. Complete a certain step of the Responders quest line to get their flag, for example. 
---
The could put the clean versions of the flags in the Atom store, though. 
---
By modders, I mean something like GTAO modders. About those hackers getting banned, I think they will just get a new game and keep coming back. Game's pretty cheap now
---
I find pleasure in writing about the cool stuff stuff happens on fo76.
---
Can we safely expect this within the next 14 years or is that unrealistically soon?
---
I'm probably going to be downvoted for defending Griefers, or maybe for insulting Griefers or for... Something. But I like providing possible alternative points of view.
---
Explosive is a relatively rare effect as it requires a 2-3\* drop. My current estimate is 1:315 chance for an explosive legendary weapon. Shotguns (double barrel, pump action, combat) have a chance of 1:10 when chosen from the ranged pool. The total estimated chance is thus **1:3150**. 
---
I found 1 explosive PA shotgun in my 600 hours of play but I don't have the exact number of legendaries I killed in total. It was fantastic before Patch 5, now I only use it to destroy the mainframe cores in nuke silos due to the splash damage it does.
---
You should come to me. I wanna see if you got what it takes to be in a bloodied team with a melee and rifle build. We are bounty hunters that look for trouble and seek out people that have grieved others. Let me know
---
Charlie has been done now as well. Just pending confirmation. 75268430.
---
Hm, good point. A Responders flag plan could be found at Morgantown Airport. A Brotherhood of Steel one at Fort Defiance. Raider symbol at Top of the World, Cutthroats at their ski chalet, Gourmands at their resort and Diehards at theirs. Free States flag at Harper's Ferry (maybe in their armory?), maybe a Cult of the Mothman flag in their church, and then a few misc flags for any groups I've forgotten. Clean ones in Atomic Shop.
---
It's a good idea.
---
It's a noble death.
---
If your budget is maxed, you can place any item regardless of if it takes up budget space or not. ie, can't place wore if budget is 100% full.
---
Are you sure your budget isn't maxed already?
---
Hm. I see your point. I'm sure somebody smarter than me will think of something, though. I hope.
---
Yeah the actions are a thing but you're applying how you feel about it and calling it griefing. All the player did was work within the gameplay systems. The server hop is annoying but all you lose is junk.
---
And as for you not buying it for its pvp, thats great but alot of people may have. And raiding fits the multilayer sandbox and the vision of the wasteland. Death costs you fuck all but yeah let's report people because you got upset. Good work. 
---
Here's my suggestion.  People will no doubt want it both ways. There are a few options for dealing with this. 
---
1. Nothing. Least favorable.
---
2. Patch the glass. Will appease some, may annoy others.
---
3. Add an alternate,  pristine version and have both.
---
4. Separate the wall from the glass, so they're individual entities,  like we have with doors. This would open the door for more customization, like colored glass we could just snap in place and swap out.
---
5. Go above and beyond,  add a pristine version of every broken and damaged workshop item.
---
Glad I'm not the only one......
---
A lot of items and switches can be operated with them, just like Fallout 4. 
---
What's your IGN?
---
Ok if you think Bethesda never made errors and the screenshot I posted must be fake, then why don't you test it yourself?     
---
       
---
Moreover how would you react if you got banned for playing too much?    
---
But yeah Bethesda must be totally right about all those bans simce they don't give a reason for the very most users and ignore tickets. This is no assumption but a fact. And I'm far from being the only one who got banned and doesnt even know why....
---
they are smart enough to secure their loot though, have to acknowledge it
---
Ha, yeah.  By that time I'd retreated, then decided to take a pic.
---
Had two 3* legendary robots do that back to back in Watoga. Bodies disappeard, explosions a few seconds later were still there. Nearly died each time trying to find the body which just wasn't there... 
---
In my experience that term ends after you reach your 20‚Äôs. Only kids use it thankfully. 
---
Sorry about your ban. I hope you are putting just as much effort in reaching support. Sounds like you haven‚Äôt had much luck but they are the only ones that could really help you if you were wrongfully banned. I‚Äôm not gonna hate on you, but playing 10+ hours a day is a lot!! I guess if you played it like it was your day job you could potentially get enough items to flag the ban algorithm. 
---
I'm sorry for your losses :/ And yes you might be right, it's not easy when you got banned &amp; don't know why.     
---
btw I removed the section in my post      
---
have a nice day
---
How about if your melee attack rate wouldn't increase? Each attack would still incur the same lag as it does now. The benefits would then be 1) better durability without swapping between weapons by having two of the same weapon, OR 2) option to have two different weapons (like a combat knife and a shishkebab, or a pistol, or two same weapons with different legendary bonuses).
---
Would that be OP? Again, this would reasonably be only for one-handed weapons, which I don't recall are OP now anyway?
---
&gt;It would be nice if we had a way to designate items as locked (not for sale), that would not even display in the trade menu.
---
I think they are not visible in the trading menu if they have an Atomshop paint job. At least to the vendors I can not sell such weapons
---
You posted to this sub, so you're now subject to a ban.

Lol ok 
---
You guys tried turning off vsync right?
---
You could take away from what you said that all people who PvP are griefers, but I also figured you were just trying to make an apples to apples comparison with people who grief and raiders,  not all people who pvp in general.   
---
I totally agree with you BTW. Personally, I do PvP people in workshops, but I also try to talk to the person afterword, and if they aren't total jerks, I give them back their workshop and anything I took. I do however happily take everything from players who start being inflammatory instead of having a reasonable conversation. Destroying people's camps though...Thats some real Raider shit that I'm not into lol.  
---
I might be a Raider, but some of us used to be human, at least a little bit :P.

conan exiles soon, soon ark taktiks, rust and dayz otw hhhhh
---
Melee in general outclass the other types with regards to both DPS and damage per hit. Keeping the hit speed the same could be a workable balance.  One handed might not have the power of a DCG or a sledge, but it's still much higher per hit than most ranged weapons and has 0 resource cost per hit, not including repair costs (since ranged has similar repair costs) 
---
I don't use melee, as my whole build and playstyle requires full stealth and tactically setting myself up to advantage points. I'm pvp hungry, but I do not like to grief or harrass. I just find the action with bounties or in workshops.
---
I don't fear numbers, or any build for that matter. Everything has a counter, and most players think they are immune to those counters. 
---
I only fear from berry mentats, as it can easily water down my strongest line of defense. 
---
I dont mind chilling with you guys, esp. If there is any action. Esp. Griefer hunting. 
---
Pm if you guys down for some action. 
---
I do believe that your perspective on this subject, dear OP, is a Falloutish one, and I cringe heavily whenever I hear 'I want this postapo survival game to be joyful, friendly, without any aggresion, and where everybody stick to the rules'. Tbh I doubt intellectual capabilities of the people who complain they are getting griefed in an online Fallout game, because it strikes me as absolute lack of both imagination and balls when you want to play a game set in the deadliest of settings and then you want it not to be deadly.
---
I started the game as an antigriefer, having lots of fun from defending people. Then I seen thousands of dimwits here for which any PvP equals griefing, and it has complicated the game for me by a lot. I wanted to align myself with nice and friendly people, but I want to align myself with anti-stupid even more, so now I am a raider.
---
If I ever get banned, I might want to test it out for sure. But I don't see no point in putting myself into days of torture just to prove your point 
---
How fortunate you are that He showed himself to you so early, a personal welcome to the wasteland... :) 
---
Would it not have been quicker for the griefers that were down to respawn and kill you instead of waiting to get ressed? It's one of my pet peeves in 76.
---
You mean half-length, right?
---
'Cause there's already half-height walls.
---
But, yeah. Totally agree.
---
This might be true :)      
---
And yes I'm always addicted to Fallout games, I work from home in part time and took 3 weeks off for release. I do totally understand thst this seems excessive but yeah..  it's fallout :D      
---
I made 3 tickets yet but I read that new tickets might reset priority for older tickets, so I just wait.
---
Just drop and recollect ultracite ammo til you reach 100k+. You could do that within minutes. But I advise to make a new account first so your main doesn't get banned.
---
This game would have more of a wheel rivalry system.   Starting with allies on either side with enemies opposite.   
---
I‚Äôve never understood why people don‚Äôt give out names of people like this. Why protect a cunt?
---
I know how to stack the mods, if I have the artisan then there is the pipe gun perk that slow degradation then the other gun perk that slows it as well but both eat up 7 perk points in intelligence and I still need some to slow power armor fusion core consumption. So I can't run the horrible nerfed demo perk in Intelligence anymore so the weapons are weaker. So its weaker or they break even faster then anything. I got 7 in Luck to keep my mutations and I got to have some in strength for the perks to make everything weigh less. Its absurd its now basically keep things from breaking and over weighting yourself Sim 2019
---
60 hours? Perception level- 1
---
For me it's only way way to improve pvp mechanic in adventure mode - remove it completely, leave it on PvP servers.
---
I might not hold up other players camps, but frankly, its a totally valid tactic. Yes, its not very nice, but if we're comparing raiders to griefers, yes they are exactly the same.   
---
If you played Fallout 4, or hell just defend a workshop, you'd notice the AI hates you, but they hate your doors SO MUCH MORE. NPCs will destroy your base until its the foundations, they just suck lemons at it so it takes forever, where as a player in that role can make really swift work of your place.  
---
The Irony of the whole thing is frankly, its a pride problem. If your base gets destroyed, you can move your camp 1 inch in any direction and all your things will be repaired for free when they are stored. It can be annoying if for instance your camp doesn't really blueprint properly, but at the end of the day you still only lose some time, nothing more. I find more often than not, when I've seen this happen or read about it, the "victim" tends to be reluctant to either server hop or move their camp to repair it, and would rather just get very angry and complain. Swallow your pride, server hop, and move your camp 1 inch to the left.   
---
Also if you think for a second that Rose, the Raider faction leader, wouldn't tell us to burn down random peoples stuff for fun you didn't pay very much attention to her character during the story.
---
Use your support ticket number to spam bethesda with instead if you want. It can help expedite your issue and it won‚Äôt reset your ticket. Any rep that you can get to listen to you, give them that number and tell them you have been waiting.
---
I would have had to change my spot if they did. 
---
Yes, if the lvl293 didn't cry for help, one of the other two would have easily caught me and 1 shotted me.
---
Then again, I could have killed them myself, but I needed them to stay alive as bait. That was the whole plan.
---
Ah, I'm glad I'm not as dumb as I thought I was!
---
I can certainly agree with a lot of what you said. It seems silly that in a game with so much freedom, players would try to force others to play a certain way. I wouldn't go so far as to call them stupid, but I definitely wouldn't say you're wrong to do so.
---
The humans in Fallout are as diverse as the critters. Good people defend others, bad people attack others. Some griefers are genuinely bad people in real life, some are just trying to role play. I think it's good to have diversity. It makes stumbling upon another player more exciting!
---
and follows you if you try to make a run for it.
---
Pretty sure there are no Mod Menues for Fallout 76 like there are for GTA5. Also those guys are currently having thier pants sued off, so its not as likely to happen for a game like FO76 IMO.
---
I don't got no ultracite ammo. i don't do SBQ runs so I don't got no prime receivers
---
Added 
---
**Carryweight**. +200 with calibrated shocks and an additional +100 with the login glitch. It allows me to spec for higher damage output while having multiple/redundant weapons. I barely carry junk for too long, but I have loads of ammo, Fusion Cores and health items to be ready for an SBQ/Nuke zone. None of those drop as loot in case I'm killed. Repaired to 200%, Fireproof and it gives a decent protection/survivability in PvE, however, I don't PvP and have no reason to. I don't capture workshops for the keep, only for the challenges and I hop pretty much immediately.
---
Thanks for your advises :) I wrote to those on reddit too but no response at all. Would like to call too but I couldnt find a german support hotline :/
---
Cool. At school right now, gonna be home in about 5 hours from now. Ill message you and see if youre available
---
No one knows :)
---
Put what console you play on mate 
---
Haha, a Raider with some standards. You'd totally fit in with the Diehards. Shame the Scorched wiped them all out, huh.
---
Oh well, continue your Raiding, Wastelander! It's players like you who help keep this game interesting
---
I know I‚Äôm late to this party, but I just wanted to throw in my total agreement that base building should not be permitted in the immediate vicinity around WS golf clubhouse.
---
It is already frustrating when you spawn in and see that the place has been leveled down and thusly filled with ghouls levels 9-22, but adding insult to injury is when turrets are placed outside the windows and the ghouls are often killed by the turrets removing any challenge or gameplay. Considering that no XP is earned by the CAMP owner for turret kills plus the fact that no loot spawns from said kills results in a simple and pointless waste of time. 
---
I have no problem with low level players. I was there not more than a month ago, but camping at WS and turret killing the ghouls is simply bad on all levels. 
---
I am currently Level 140 I believe and have never openly engaged in PvP or earned a wanted level/bounty until this started occurring. Now when I see turrets shooting through the WS windows, I immediately take out the lever action and take them out. Most recently, it resulted in a 60 Cap bounty. I asked an online friend to kill me afterwards to claim the bounty. 
---
The base owner was a LvL 31 who stayed at his base and did not engage. I felt a little bad as I did not message him to tell him why I destroyed his turrets. I may inform them in the future or at least direct them to this discussion. 
---
This can all be solved by simply expanding the ‚Äúno build‚Äù zone an additional hundred feet or so away from the clubhouse. Then they can still have their camp and defend it, and the leveled ghouls can be taken out by the players as they should be. 
---
How much free RAM do you have? What type of SSD do you have, SATA or NvMe/M.2?
---
For me, 16 GB (12GB free) and SATA SSD (520MB/s) stutters due to audio loading hiccups. 32 GB (26 GB free) and M.2 (3500MB/s) plays smooth.
---
If you really want you could do it with junk or halloween candy too. Yes halloween candy is considered 'rare' too which is hilarious considering you get a few thousands with each run. Just 1 or 2 rounds &amp; them dropping &amp; picking it up til you reach 100k+.
---
Adding your platform is helpful. The initial rush on the game has subsided, finding low level players on random servers can be difficult.
---
Thank you for the reply! I have controler already (2 + Xbox gamepad) so if i buy it is in Allkey website per example that is costing 10 euros
---
Heckler and Koch had a run of MP5 chambered in 10mm, and there are already drum mags for that. The problem is there is no market for it. Why buy 10mm when .45 is more plentiful and cheaper at that? Similarly, why would you make gear for a 10mm smg no one is going to buy? You would probably get a burst of sales at release that would trickle down to nothing; not become very wealthy.

Why do I want to do these 'tests' again? I already know with my experience that no exploit means no bans. I don't have any reason to prove something. If anyone's got to do some proving, that should be you
---
I have absolutely nothing against people who say 'I play casually as I don't have infinite time, I'd prefer to play it coop, I hope PvP people will migrate to survival servers'. I value those people. Those who I am calling stupid are different, more like 'fuck dem toxic kids, gtfo from my game, all PvPrs have no life and compensate that in game'. Towards the latter, I present 'well, dear dumbfuck, its my game now *shoots em*'
---
I'm terrible at this game, so I was so happy to finally kill a Deathclaw earlier, only for the ash pile to... Vanish
---
Sad
---
Goooodddddd.......
---
The moderators will take down the post. Its a rule for the reddit page. The witch hunting rule.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. Look at Rose - she's a raider. Raiders are psychotic drug abusers who torture people for fun. In previous Fallouts we only experience Raider depredation second hand - we see it happening to other people. Bethesda has figured out a way for us to experience raiders firsthand. And hey if you don't like it switch servers, spend a few hours reaccumulating junk to repair your crap, and that's it.
---
People don't even have to roleplay as raiders. Just be their natural jerky selves.
---
I don't know if this will help you but was working in my case: go to settings and choose full screen, exit game, go to Nvidia settings for fallout make sure gsync is enabled and vsync disabled.
---
Huh. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me either. I guess it protects people from liars and from being attacked without getting to share their side of the story but in this case it‚Äôs pretty obvious they were at fault. Think if a person has video proof it should even be encouraged.
---
Yes sorry. Half length. I misspeak!
---
Yes, I use GSync - so I always play without VSync. Yes, I've disabled Ipresentinterval and a bunch of other stuff.
---
It's not a matter of synching frames - it's a loading/streaming issue that's quite severe.
---
Those are raiders and Bethesda want more raiders in game look at workshop changes its all to help raiders.
---
Hah, go get 'em!
---
I definitely agree that some people are _too_ harsh on Griefers. It's just a game, after all, and most PVPers are genuinely not that bad.
---
Okay i will try that
---
Npc raiders will just cause your junk to disappear, then you will kill them as any regular mobs, you will feel better but no functional difference.
---
I already posted the ban notice of my friends test and you're still doubting it. What kind of proof do you expect?       
---
If you're so confident that Bathesdas auto ban scripts are working fine, give it a try.
---
I want a new energy weapon called "Long Pew". I still remember the disappointment (and embarassment) when I found that the existing "Long Pew" plan is for some kind of religious bench.
---
Instagating + 40% power attack is what I am using
---
My build is about 94% melee, 3% Explosive and 3% ranged. My primary weapon of choice is All Rise (reward for completing Mayor for a Day in Watoga). I believe base damage is 240 or 260 but I‚Äôve gotten it to 540 with all slugger perks and Adrenaline maxed plus Bloody Mess. Adding in power attack, it can 2 hit kill almost anything (sbq obvious exception as well as higher level Legendaries like glowing Deathclaws). 
---
When I was low level, I used Grognak‚Äôs Axe, and still keep a 3*** one as a backup in case my All Rise breaks. Not a fan of one handed melee weapons but I know some players are hardcore fans of it and can achieve insane damage with the Deathclaw gauntlet or Power Fist, but it‚Äôs just not my thing. I‚Äôm also in PA the vast majority of the time. 
---
What do the Raiders in Fallout 4 do when they come across a settlement of yours? They attack it and try to destroy all the stuff you've built.
---
I think I've been attacked once in 300 levels on my Excavator wearing main. It's basically been a single player game for me so there's no way I'm sacrificing all the bonus carry weight for protection I never need.
---
While replying to some of these posts I realized a really good point to be made. For players that like to role play, like myself, I often wonder what the faction leader (if any) that I've allied with would say about what I'm doing.  So when it comes to raiders, ask yourself "Would Rose be okay with me doing this?" and frankly, from what I got from her character, she literally would delight in you doing pretty much anything people would consider "Griefing". I'm not saying it makes doing things like using Homophobic or Rasict terms, or anything against TOS okay, those things are all what I would consider real "Griefing". However when it comes to killing other players, taking their stuff, burning down their homes\\workshops, I think it heavily implies these things would be totally fine if you decided to be part of the Appalachian Raiders.   
---
Also as a Tangent, The lore is pretty clear that raider gangs tend to thrive when people aren't banding together. The more people who band together for safety, the harder it is for the raiders to survive. Raiders tend to be small gangs, or solo thugs, where as factions tend to span up-to hundreds of people. The problem is, gameplay wise, its hard to realistically use safety in numbers since its hard to have any real faction outside of a small squad. A function of that is im sure it can feel like the game is slanted toward helping raiders, when really, the raiders are just in the time period where they don't have much for opposing forces.   
---
The biggest kick in the teeth for me is Bethesda basically left making the factions up to us, and the largest, most effective one is the Raiders, because they don't need the large groups to thrive. If anything, its more disappointing after being frustrated by dying to raiders, people elect to complain rather than *actually banding together.* &gt;!This is literally the one thing the overseer tells us we need to do when she finally understands what all went down in Appalachia with all the factions. Band together and not go every man for themselves.!&lt;
---
The high level charred ghouls... Quick, massive radiation damage, instant rad worms. Really annoying when part of a horde..
---
I think so far the best legendary wep I have is the dragon. And I've killed countless 2-3 star legendary mobs to get that. =(
---
What test? An email from bethesda tells me that someone's got banned for hoarding ammo and that's it.
---
Yes, this exactly.
---
Videos do get around this rule easy though, as long as the context doesn't target said player.
---
It's their rules, we just got to comply lol.
---
See, this I totally understand. You're not only minimizing the amount of loot you drop if you die, you're also aware you're not set for PvP and so you don't put yourself in a situation you might not be able to deal with it. 
---
You can repair all by looking at your camp machine thing.. but I also heard if you move your camp it auto repairs everything for free. Just the caps it costs to move it slightly..
---
Wooden stairs would be nice.  
---
I'd kill for a space-saving spiral staircase.
---
To answer the Question, Fire axe is the highest Base Damage Normal 2-handed weapon.  
---
Power fists and death claw gauntlets are unarmed not 1 handed.  Swords, daggers hatches etc are 1 handed. 
---
Sigh... well give it a try :) Honestly no idea what you expect. I see no point in streaming for days just to wait for ban because otherwise some might say 'but you could have logged in &amp; duped after picking up the ammo you dropped'
---
Yes, there‚Äôs like 300 in total, I was trying to see if they took up space, there‚Äôs more behind the wall and an entire base behind the wall  
---
And not just the valuable stuff either, literally the doors I've built they destroy out of spite. They just suck at it compared to a player with wreaking ball and a two shot mini nuke launcher.
---
Only real fallout fans play 76. 
---
Sometimes my competitive nature gets the best of me and I engage someone back in PvP, usually I store my junk but at this point in my play-through I don‚Äôt have need for any junk really. Still feels bad when I get killed and someone takes it even if it‚Äôs stuff I don‚Äôt need. 
---
At the same time, while considering myself a raider, I never followed somebody who I fought after they tried to move away, I often stop to talk afterwards, I have dozens of people on my friendlist that our first interaction was one killing the other, not really finding it cool to nuke camps (I once wanted a bounty, I found a camp, and I was bombing one particular wall of it, then repairing it myself, so I could get to 100 bounty without trolling anyone, lol).
---
But I'd love this game to have some 'semi protected' zones, where all shits go loose if somebody attacks you, so that the game had actual features to protect people from the raiders. I'd also love a 'dont go there' zone where the law is that you die because everybody dies there.
---
This reminds me a bit of the gravity-defying spoon in Oblivion. Granted, that wasn't an MMO.
---
???
---
Buy me a new game and I might consider :) Again, there's no reason for me to do these tests since I am not banned
---
There is a theory that "obtaining" means picking up so I want to test if picking up items is all it would take to hit the 100k limit to get banned 
---
That's not how armor piercing works. It doesn't stack, each source of AA reduces the remaining armor by the % listed, so if you have an AA weapon that's 50%, then if you have a perforating mag, that's 40% of the remaining 50%, which is effectively just 20% of the total.
---
Well, you still have to factor in the range requirement. With melee weapons you both need to get to the enemy and withstand their melee attacks. Sure, at optimal conditions melee clearly outperforms ranged. If it didn't why would anyone go melee when you could achieve the same effect remotely? You can't just look at DPS numbers and resource cost to get find the objectively better choice.
---
Not saying melee isn't currently ridiculously OP with all the different STR + condition based boosting currently, but they're a different animal altogether. Setting SPECIAL hard max to 20 or so would probably help. But I don't think that's a reason to be against dual wielding, melee just generally needs some balancing.
---
I too would like to see this seeing as Bethesda are ignoring tickets from people claiming this 
---
&gt; Even so, 75% ain't bad.
---
Lol. With Melee damage and the way armor works 75% armor pen is effectively 100% armor pen.
---
Use playstv? It automatically records games and deletes old vids you don't use. You can directly upload to your account and share vids. Cut and trim the parts you want. Alt + f2 to highlight scenes etc
---
Great story. One thing that kept making me cringe though, it's lure.
---
We don't grief all the time unless we are bored or fucked up lmao. We spar with each other for fun to see if or how we can be or get better. I am a level 200 and I wouldn't greif unless I was a low player with no caps and the equipment to. I am a stealth melee build. And the other rifle guy on the team usually stays back but he's good. Lol a hard fight for a stealth melee build. He found some bloodied railway rifle and he can't stop using it. I use a 3* mastered bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. Have all sneak perks and all unarmed perks but also use bolstering and unyeilding armour. 
---
Again you're doubting proof &amp; didn't even explain what kind of proof you want. However it seems there is no point to continue this discussion if you think Bethesda never made errors. Have a nice day.
---
Still this? The guy got banned. Many of his actions were borderline, not just ammo count. Bullet count is just the only proof we were given. If they just used bullet count as a reason to review his account, saw the rest of his activity (which we were not given) and made the decision, then all these arguments are pointless.
---
Indeed. I go solo, but that's more out of a lack of communication. I don't have a mic, so Discord or Xbox chat is my only option to speak, but I'm too shy to actually extend a hand and try to band together with my fellow survivors. I feel this would be easier with dedicated factions, similar to Rockstars Crews (I don't even play GTA or RDR2, but I know roughly how they work). I dunno.
---
I'm glad to see such a detailed response to my post, and I definitely like your logic with "how would [faction leader] react?", it's a good way to think!
---
Just don't cheat and don't get banned. I really don't understand all the fuss
---
[My CAMP](https://i.imgur.com/7QIDXVD.jpg)
---
I just thought I'd show off my CAMP's location, showing it's not at Whitesprings (it's southeast, probably a kilometre away). I'm off the beaten path, up on the side of a cliff overlooking the breathtaking views of stunning Appalachia.

Friendly vault-dwellers are welcome - as you can see, I'm not sitting at the door of Whitesprings mowing down the ghoul hordes as they spawn, I'm not overly saying "look at me, come and grief me" with turret-filled rooftops or locked doors. I'm just trying to live the post-apocalyptic American dream. My doors are open, my crop garden plentiful, and the views alone are worth the climb.
---
what if someone finds a very good legendary? 
---
what if someone high level gives you it? 
---
there are more then enough people who dont use sniper rifles in which this weapon gives you an opportunity to dump your 308 rounds into an enemy. 
---
the light machine gun also has a ton more fire rate then the 50cal. 
---
the light machine gun is fun to use. 
---
just because something is impractical to use doesn't warrent it to be never used. i use fatmans all the time but do you need fatmans?... no. 
---
Cool story dude :) I bought FO76 a while ago but didn‚Äôt play because of all the negativity. Now I started to give it another go and I must say I really enjoy it this time. World feels more alive if you follow the story and read/listen notes and holo‚Äôs. Didn‚Äôt try pvp yet, seems kinda fishy.
---
How much time do you have to respond to your attacking player before entering ‚Äòpvp mode‚Äô?
---
I myself was banned for picking up a brown bag left by another player. Hardly fair i didn't know it contained 100k in duped items but fuck me I'm a cheater right 
---
Want this too. Dropped a few good weapons by mistake, only once found the bag.. 
---
You realize the road map they gave us right? Small QoL changes may take some time considering the amount of work they need to do... or do you want the road map dates pushed back? 
---
Don't think that counts as a proof man
---
That's a great idea. I'm not sure how hard it would be to implement, but I completely agree that this would assist in fixing the problem.
---
Well either a cheater, or one of those guys that picks up someone else's bag, just as bad.
---
You are either a blind person or a cheater. How do you not notice 100k items?
---
&gt; Even when people use illegitimate, OP weapons, the armors I mentioned like X-01 and Ultracite give you at least some time to react, where you just can't get that with excavator
---
In my excavator I have 305hp and 335dr.  I dont bother defending public workshops from other players because I've died in a single shot to an explosive weapon literally everytime the attacker is above level 20.  I cant remember off the top of my head what my damage resistance is in my x-01 but the idea that moderately more changes anything is laughable.
---
In the excavator I can tank everything the game throws at me from a PvE standpoint; the biggest problem with the PvP is the prevalence of crazy OP weapons 
---
I feel your disappointment, not just with what happened with your issue, but the industry ad a whole.
---
Why we as gamers tolerate this kind of thing is insane, yet we do.  I hope you find another game worthy of your time and money, then post here, I‚Äôm looking too.
---
üòÇ was someone helping me through the game when I just started. Not my fault he put in 100k and I did take all without thinking. Their count doesn't care if you kept the items or not. (I deleted the character holding the items when o found out they were duped)
---
Thanks for pointing that out. Will fix it!
---
Would you accept buying a mystery box of Amazon and being arrested for handling stolen goods that were in the box even though you had no knowledge of what was inside before it was too late ?
---
Oh thanks but allready got the marsupial but thanks enyway 
---
I'd like countries flags to put on my camp 
---
Done, thanks again lol. So crappy to have a mistake like that on the first line.
---
You can't even pick up 100k items by a mistake even if you wanted to. Most you can pick up at a time is limited to 30k 
---
I dont pick up strangers packages.
---
Will add you on Xbox 
---
Attacking to gain ground is a totally valid tactic but it's not something that is implemented on a faction level yet. I would love to see faction fights on servers; where people battle for ground and resources. I could care less if someone attacks my camp to try and bait pvp, it's pretty common to see someone well over level 100. I totally understand the cap game even if it irritates me quite often. I'm near level 200 and people will attack me in hopes that I will donate a good amount of caps being sucked into their trap. Raiding and griefing are different. Raiding implies something to be gained. Plenty of battles are fought with the hope of inciting retaliation. Griefing is just about upsetting people when you realize you can't win. I completely agree plenty of people just want to play the victim in this game. The end goal of Rose was to unlock the stash. She was happy to play the puppet master but in the end that was the reward. 
---
&gt; I feel this would be easier with dedicated factions, similar to Rockstars Crews (I don't even play GTA or RDR2, but I know roughly how they work). I dunno. 
---
I personally would love this, even just something where you can join one of the 5 or so in game factions, and put out a distress call to anyone else who's in your faction for help, like with an event/map marker. Not only would it give players some backup if someone comes to bother them, but also gives more opportunities for counter-play in general. I think a lot of people would be more than happy to come put a raider down in order to protect an innocent player, if given the opportunity. 
---
Those half height walls are too tall, we need quarter walls so I can actually see over them without jumping, because maruspial makes me jump up like 30ft, and bird bones combined with Strange in Numbers makes me take like 15 seconds to fall and I'm not taking a perk card off just to see over my walls.
---
Granted. 
---
Good luck :)
---
I thought they patched it months ago? Really, it's still there? I've been looting grenades from mutants like crazy. I'm still using demo express and found my second piece of armour with a 20% weapon weight reduction. I guess on the plus side the phantom grenades I do have only weigh 0.03 each. 
---
Turret farms are why I've kept my flammer, need to run through and tag everything before the mincing machine at the back door gets to work.
---
As long as you want. I think it's actually 15 minutes.
---
Then again, 15 minutes is pretty long in such a case.
---
As for the game itself. It is definetly getting better, and if you ignore the negative media on fo76, you will find that the game is actually pretty fun in its own way.
---
What are the stats of your armor? It‚Äôs only chameleon? Or there is Assassin and/or Sentinel too?
---
Alt+f2, is this on ps4? Or pc, or do I upload from ps and edit on pc?
---
Everyone in Shawshank is innocent, didn't you know ?
---
Yes. I've seen people with a tamed snallygaster in their camp. 
---
What are you looking for in exchange? :) 
---
I'd say the mole miners, none of the actual enemies scare me but that noise they make terrified me when I was new to the game, now it just means I'm doing Uranium Fever.
---
Scariest creature over all in Fallout are those dead dolphin things, I'm terrified of aquatic life so even just seeing their corpses unsettles me, which is why I always make them go 'pop'.
---
I wouldn't call that griefing.
---
Oh ok that‚Äôs quite some time and makes it interesting. 
---
And yes it does! But there‚Äôs always gonna be negativity. I kinda understand dem fallout fan boys get mad, but then again it‚Äôs a different game. It‚Äôs almost like comparing Skyrim to Elder Scrolls Online, which is a whole different experience.
---
I did install a reshade because I almost got sick playing vanilla.
---
I do not know if it has already been fixed, but there is a way to repair (almost) everything for free.
---
In the construction mode, you can simply use the "replace by" function to replace the damaged parts with an appropriate piece of wall (wall without window -&gt; wall with window). The new piece is 100% intact. Now you can replace the intact piece with the original, which is now 100% intact again
---
The other issues are the perks. Max ranged armor piercing via perk is 45%. Melee is 75%. Melee also has the advantage in PvE of having blocked (which is somewhat of a balanced in PvP, though if BGS would tell us how all the damage/DR/perks/effects calculated out to HP damage this would be far more objective). 
---
Unfortunately for the raiders/griefers it's just a game and with one push on the button bye, bye griefers no fun for you today.
---
Notice I said it's someone helping me through the game and i did not keep these items as they over encumbered me. This happened multiple times. My point is this is meant to hit dupers but it hit everyone that ever picked up a brown bag that contained illicit goods. If there was going to be an issue they shouldn't have allowed us to pick up the bags of people we kill. All those duper hunters that destroyed duped items also banned btw 
---
/u/Ladydevann please. Number occupied / number max.
---
You can just keep picking cards until you have one of each rank. The game will let you keep picking the same card until you have enough for  1 rank of each rank. The system is deliberately designed this way and ability to break down cards would undermine this mechanic. 
---
Not me lol. I picked up millions and I'm still alive. Difference is, I don't keep those items. I dump them right away
---
Nothing too scary lol. I use two bolstering combot armors pieces, a weightless right leg with junk reduction by 20%, cloaking left arm with harder to detect and weapons weigh less by 20%, the bolstering combot chest plate has AP refresh, and the right leg has it as well.
---
My chameleon right arm has caviler lol, but that without the full set is pointless.
---
From my experience, you can have one of each rank for any given card. I've done this with several cards so far. 
---
More than happy to help.
---
I put the items on a fresh character then deleted the character. Apparently that was the wrong call üò£
---
&gt;I guarantee you that people taking workshops don't care about owning them and are just looking for a cheap kill
---
Indeed they want to instigate PVP this is 100% as intended, resources are easily available elsewhere (ballistic fibre excepted, my pet peeve), exceptions would be the Fusion core generator and ammo factory I think, I just don't need workshops for resources, I really don't have stash space to store everything I can loot while just playing the game and I sell and dump into baggies regularly.
---
I don't enjoy PVP so just ignore workshops as something I'm just interested in, tried and died a few time, also claimed them too and you don't always get contested, depends on who's on your server.
---
In fallout 76 it's a big part of the game if you didn't notice 
---
I think that'd be great. It'd really allow players to feel some sense of progression, and encourage more interactions without forcing anyone to do anything.
---
Played in Beta, still only learned this like 2-3 months after the initial release of the game.  I'd say at about the 200+ hour mark is when I learned that.
---
Cheering for you in your endeavor, but pointing out someone‚Äôs hypocrisy or incompetence rarely has the desired effect when the guilty party is the one with the power.
---
I believe corporations are incapable of saying sorry when they make a mistake, it opens them up to possible legal obligations.
---
How do you manage? A R4 must be ranked to 5, it won't let you rank a lower version on XBox?
---
Team vs Team = pvp
---
1v1, 1v2 = pvp
---
4v1 = griefing
---
Plus, they were killing others before I got there and probably continued as I left. 
---
Uh... Care to elaborate?
---
Ah shit you play on ps4. I was talking about pc
---
Damn, if you were on PS4 I'd set you up with good armor, weapons and offer to quest and farm with you, I play at around that time sometimes and I've noticed it gets kinda empty after midnight West Coast time, which is probably why you aren't meeting people.
---
Same as here
---
Modders will fix that
---
Oh wait...
---
Thank you for that idea. I haven't fixed it yet, I was in the process of building when the person attacked, and so I've been finishing making things the way I like and feeling more like  home. I will do that replace trick to fix the structures, and I will try storing and rebuilding my crafting facilities and furniture to restore their health.
---
The playstation has the share factory, built in software, kind of nice, but so limited and its hard to edit with a controller, nit impossible, but hard.
---
Sure... here, have a squirt gun.

---
Suggest you find a Fallout 76 server on Discord to find someone playing around the time you are. Or possibly try server hopping until you see people at your level. Also don't rule out playing the game with someone of a higher level. Hope you find teammates! Good Luck!
---
It's still rude
---
Yeah I‚Äôve gotten a few from there. Looks nice. 
---
Not at all. As part of PvP it's the risk you take 
---
I jumped out of the server, but I don't believe there were enemies nearby. I think he was doing it for his own personal satisfaction.
---
I came on today to make the same thread, I've made/scrapped over 200 sets of combat armour arms and still don't have deep pockets available, I've even learned mods for the armour legs while scrapping armour arms!  
---
I get the game needs grind to prolong things but fuuuuuuu..........
---
You play your way, I'll play mine. Mine does not get me banned, or piss off friends.
---
Right? Whats the point of living inside if you can't keep the outside out. It's raining outside, good thing I have this broken window to keep me wet.
---
Can confirm. I got one after turning in technical data. Beats leveling up an alt and doing those quests all over again
---
ugh.. have my upvote sir :) but what if Banthesdan ran Shawshank?
---
Considering that Fallout 76 is about Fallout and the wasteland. There should be more weather patterns everywhere in the map. More rain in different parts and radiation storms here and there and it would also make a few cards based on the weather to be more useful. The weather should be more frequent.
---
Plz Beth, send half stairs too. Not only with foundation. I have a terrace.
---
&gt; The end goal of Rose was to unlock the stash. She was happy to play the puppet master but in the end that was the reward. 
---
In game, because there is no faction system, yes Rose just helps you unlock the stash. However I brought up Rose because I think her values are a good example of what makes a raider. Part of it is just Anarchy, doing whatever you want, whenever you want, to whomever you want. There isn't a real IG way of joining the Raiders, but thats consistent with all the factions. your character might have done the quest just for the stash, but another might have done it because they want to be a raider, and also have to deal with the whole "End of the world" thing.  
---
&gt; Raiding and griefing are different. Raiding implies something to be gained.  
---
I don't really agree with this. If you're talking about the technical definition of the word, yes that's true, but in this context Raider refers to a group of people rather than an action someone is taking. 
---
Yes, there are raider gangs in the history of fallout who were basically pseudo military outfits (like the Gunners or Khans) but Raiders have also been known to torture and destroy for no reason at all. Lots of raider plot lines from FO4 detail this, raiders just being shitty because they felt like it. A ton of random Dialog where the raiders talk about killing or torturing people just for fun. Not to mention, holding someone's Camp hostage is pretty much exactly what all raiders do in FO4, since they shake them down for resources, threatening to destroy the settlement/ kill the settlers if they don't get their way. Or for an In game Example, In Fallout 4 Raiders attack your settlements, and if you go there but don't help, they will destroy everything the possibly can, while killing every non essential NPC.
---
 I don't think its a massive jump to assume sometimes raiders destroy things just for fun, especially since its been detailed in a lot of places. Seems very much in line with what they do both through game systems and Lore.
---
Today I got a thunder storm and rad storm. Haven‚Äôt seen those in a long time. 
---
Yep, I was hoping they'd fix that by now... but frankly it doesn't matter anymore. My houses went from fortress mode to local pub pretty quick. This isn't the survival game I was expecting at first, but I'm okay with that.
---
I have been camping for months directly on a railway bridge that crosses a road south of Morgantown. My camp has never been attacked by other players and it is a well-frequented place as it lies on the route of a quest.
---
I think it always depends on what you build and where. Some do not like the stilt houses.
---
I do not even have a single gun in defense and only occasionally do I need to repair parts damaged by scorched or super mutants
---
I don‚Äôt think the nukes were ever that bad in West Virginia to warrant radstorms. But it would be a cool addition to put radstorms for a few hours in a nuke zone after the nuke finishes.
---
I know right. I have made a Fallout 76 Faction based on The United States Arm Forces and its really fun since we are all wearing The Army Fatigue.
---
Well, weather is frequent, in fact, it's constant. Pleasant weather is still weather, after all. But thanks for clarifying.
---
I agree with you. The game feels a lot nicer than any other game (It may have harder foes, but it's a nicer environment, at least in The Forest and the Savage Divide), it's only been 25 years since the apocalypse. I want more rads, dammit!
---
Totally.
---
I disagree. Team ganking isn't griefing, especially if they were switching up their targets and not harassing one person.
---
FUCK charred ghouls. Theyre by far the fastest ghoul because apparently Usain Bolt mutated into clone babies and those clone babies grew into charred ghouls. Who the hell thought it'd be reasonable to have an enemy move THAT fast?
---
Yeah. It would be nice to see weather patterns taking place everywhere in Fallout 76. It would make things more interesting.
---
Hacked by raiders. Sounds exactly like the kind of shit that produced Rose. I wouldn't want this in game, but it sure would be funny and fairly lore friendly.
---
It would be nice for more different weathers and also more weather storms and radiation storms.
---
What is with the downvotes? What did I do wrong? Dang.
---
It would be more interesting with more weather.
---
Opinions, we are all entitled to them. Your right. Im right, we all right lol.
---
One time it gave me something I wanted. I don't remember what anymore, I just remember actually liking whatever it was.
---
Had one guy start saying a shit ton of transphobic stuff when my gf corrected him on my pronouns, prior to that he was totally nice but once he spewed that I just logged off, I was done for the night.  Some other asshole who was clearly still a kid said a shit ton of sexual and sexist stuff to my gf at one point, even saying he would rape her, fortunately I was streaming and had the video evidence to report him.  Wish I had it for the first guy as well. 
---
Most of the players I've talked to have been very nice but a few don't deserve to have the capability to talk.
---
but what's your sbq build
---
because instigating is useless for that
---
I've been on that situation... My respects for you sir! üòäüëçüèª
---
So you benefited multiple times from trading with a duper, seems like you should have been banned? So why are you complaining? Because you "didn't know" they were dupped?, because you only drove the get away car?
---
Here I go!!
---
&gt;The problem seems to be people investing large amounts of time and materials into building workshops creating fancy and I agree often admirable constructions *but workshops are transient* either disconnection or a player contesting the shop and can take it all away, boom all gone.
---
If I ever want to build something worthy of my fully modded Fallout 4 times :) I will build up my C.A.M.P and at least have something that persists from server to server and is relatively easy to repair when destroyed by other players of SpamBeast flying mobs ;)
---
Man this guy named Jullz wolf is an awesome guy, I would definitely give him a gold if I had one, he definitely deserve one, if only there was someone with an available gold at hand:(
---
Rad storms are my absolute favorite. Loved them in fallout 4 and I even got a mod to make it more intense. 
---
Not done SBQ yet as I keep crashing out \[PS4\]....Im level 103 and just CBA with her until I run out of other things to do and servers get more stable.
---
I am actually a Sniper build to be honest, and just use the instagating + 40% when things get close such as at WhiteSprings Nuke etc.
---
It's been a very long time since any of my camps has killed something, but I don't recall being able to loot anything if I didn't tag it. 
---
Click on my name, and when my icon shows up, press start chat
---
It is very interesting to see that happen. Especially how they made it seem a bit creepy.
---
Panties ? Are they available in the Atom shop? I want *bloodied instigating Vault Tec panties* to wear under my raider armor!
---
Make sure you log off and on again to check that it's still there before you do anything. 
---
scrapping plants (even if they are broken) brings the same ammount of ressources which you need to craft them
---
Be nice for everyone to ditch the pipe weapon perk now that it's useless.
---
People should be allowed to build at whitesprings, but the staff should automatically go hostile towards such structures and their owners. Because of this, the camp defenses should take constant damage as if being sabotaged by the whitesprings care takers.
---
&gt;They aren't your personal bases
---
\^\^This\^\^
---
Some people have to deal with their personal problems online sadly. Glad to see things have been mostly positive for you. If you see me on, (newt341) give me a wave. I am happy to trade stuff and further the positive player experience. I've usually got several plans and a lot of armor mods I am happy to share.
---
Yes. The mod I had in fallout 4 made this certain rad storm (forget what it was called) but it would make it super dark and the sky would become a blood red and the only way you could see things was if they were illuminated by the blood red sky. It made it really scary and definitely post apocalyptic feeling. 
---
Steel is more useful than that damn prize certificate too.
---
&gt; but the idea that moderately more changes anything is laughable. 
---
Damage resistance in fallout is difficult to explain in brief, I suggest you educate yourself on how it works. That "Small difference" is actually massive when talking about burst damage. It bothers me you're so quick to dismiss the validity of stacking DR when you don't understand how it works.   
---
&gt; In the excavator I can tank everything the game throws at me from a PvE standpoint; the biggest problem with the PvP is the prevalence of crazy OP weapons 
---
Personally, I've only ever come across one weapon that killed me in under 5 seconds if I was in my X-01. Again, I can use my Two Shot, Explosive Gauss Rifle, fully carded out, and still have to get at least 2-5 sneak attack head-shots (depending if they have even more DR from perks) in order to kill a target, while someone in excavator I can just body shot them with a half charged shot and it does the job. I want to also point out, without Sneak attack or head shots, we're talking at least 5 fully charged shots from the same weapon, and that if they don't happen to heal at all, Unless again, they are using the garbage Excavator, Then its like 2-3.   
---
Are some weapons Imbalanced? sure. I do however think the fact you've chosen to not try and defend yourself properly based on no actual information about how DR works kind of proves my point. You deserve to be one shot if you're wearing excavator in a PvP Zone, frankly I honestly think a single, non legendary Hunting rifle could one shot you if you're in excavator if they're properly carded. A sneak attack headshot critical does something like 50x damage if you take the right chems. It's not the weapons, its the people using them, and your inability to use the tools at your disposal to mitigate that. 
---
Excavator is for farming, not fighting.
---
Sure thing, I'm on PS4 and go by the same name as I do here, and can totally relate to the plans issue, currently got like 17 lbs worth because I hold onto them for others.  The other day I had like 22 lbs worth on my character, had to clear out some junk and store them.
---
That sounds very cool and also scary.
---
Give me 4 hours til I‚Äôm home and I‚Äôll have one fresh tour for you 
---
[i asked this not to long ago and someone sent me this. the map half way down is so useful](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/) 
---
&gt;one that has graffiti or some other way to tell it has grenades on it and the normal one
---
Bloody brilliant idea, would be a way to introduce a little raider goodness into this human devoid game.
---
Oh for myself and other what does the flare gun do? 
---
Your comment here is worth more than gold buddy!
---
For which wepons? 
---
So many brilliant ideas in this thread, I wonder if Bethesda see these kind of things.
---
They need to fix energy weapons first lol
---
Or they just give us a mod type to allow Unarmed Melee weapons to be used with that arm.
---
Hell, a nod that allowed you to hook your energy weapons into your power-armor, and using your cores to amplify heavy energy and plasma weapons would also be cool!
---
Make the Plasma Cannon awesome!
---
All I'm saying is if it is they cannot advertise it as a game function when in reality you can be banned for doing so
---
Sure, finding the plans in relevant world locations works fine too. 
---
By the way, I'm still a bit annoyed that I didn't get the Nuka Cola backlit posters for exploring the Nuka Cola plant, or the Red Rocket posters for taking over the Red Rocket Mega Stop :-P 
---
[r/iamverysmart](https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart)
---
Even by your logic and reasoning, if this player's character is to die (which is perfectly reasonable to assume will happen in a survival video game), bad things may happen in future lives of his character, which may or may not be influenced by the actions he has taken in his current life. This, therefore, nullifies your need to try and relate a throw-away joke made by me to a deeper philosophical concept.
---
This is a video game post, not a study of philosophy and religion.
---
That's so much :)
---
The dreaded Toxic Valley radscorpion, scary and lethal when you stumble upon a pack of 3, even one of them can finish you off pretty quick with their poisonous stinger if you are unlucky. The bane of my low level responder paramedic's existence since I moved to Clarksburg.
---
Anglers come to a close second, but at least these don't burrow.
---
If you look down the barrel of a loaded gun and pull the trigger, you get what you have coming. Dont play dumb because you didnt check that it was loaded.
---
I'm probably oversimplifying here, but I imagine it to go something like this
---
Destroy weapon&gt;is item favorite? If yes STOP, pop error. If no continue
---
Would it be much more difficult than that?
---
Griefing is any action that has no objective benefit and the only possible outcome is to make someone else frustrated/angry/upset.
---
You're right that raiders do what they do because they would rather steal the fruits of someone else's labor than put in their own work.  I'm not sure raiders were as murder/destruction obsessed as you and the self-described "raiders" in fo76 think they are.  In fallout 4 wouldnt Abernathy farm be a smoldering wreck and a bunch of corpses if raiders just murdered and leveled everything they came across?
---
I get that extortion is a major aspect of being a raider and it's basically impossible when your target can server hop or block you.  Similarly stealing is a major aspect of being a raider that is impossible with the way player stashes work.  Neutering your ability roleplay as a raider doesn't mean you can rebrand griefing as "raider role-play" though.
---
Trust me, these are the crappiest kind of engagements, because these type of players depend on numbers to win against a single player in pvp.
---
Although, a player well prepared  can barrage through them. 
---
I server hopped cuz the seeking revenge will be throwing them all over the place, making it kind of impossible to hold ground.
---
I work 4 on 4 off graveyards. So on my off nights that's exactly when I'm online. Work tomorrow and sat night this week. so ill be on 9am-11ish the next couple days.

I'm a big of usung the small picket fence/walls under defense, there are even half-length ones for those pesky 1/4 floors
---
Protip: move your camp (even just a foot) and rebuild from stored. Only costs a few dozen caps (depending on level)  vs all that junk.
---
Looks similar to modern Chinese architecture
---
I'm using them as well but they don't look as good on the interior, for my balcony sure but to block of my staircase I'd like some quarter height walls.
---
But in general...higher level = more hours of play = probable high weapons/armor = harder to kill
---
Platform* we don't discriminate here ... ^^unless ^^you ^^play ^^on ^^console.
---
If I remember right thistle is in the toxic waistes and fever blossom is by the grave stones in point Pleasant
---
I feel you there, mostly going for loft type builds with small living rooms and a 2nd floor with this type of balcony. Also we need atomic shop variants of the 1/4 and 1/2 floors .
---
Oh ok thanks, i heard that the only remaining tse weapons were the ones existing before the patch that nerfed them, but im glad to see that i can still find one. Btw good work doing all this, it seems to have taken some time. 
---
I have a level 320 that feeds level 120's equipment. My level 120's are hard to kill. My level 320 is fragile. Character level means nothing and is a poor assumption to think it does

Probably only 1
---
I love the idea, although originally I misunderstood the title and thought you wanted a slingshot weapon, which I also love the idea of.  
---
WAY up north In the toxic valley iirc.
---
Google it bro, I found both several weeks ago this way
---
What system? It PS4 how much?
---
That's a great story, and well written, I was with you all the way. My heart was in my mouth!
---
I've yet to run across a griefer. Seems there are more helpful players than ones who want to be raiders. 
---
"He looked into his cupped hands for any F*$is he had but, alas, he found he had none left to give"  great story sir!
---
Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Meh...this is going to be a pointless argument.....but my stance is that a higher level player is a higher risk; they probably have lots of 3\* equipment which they have had to the time to achieve without trading. A lower level 65 player who has not that many hours could only get the higher level kit from trades which has been a bit of an issue with the scared loss of items etc.
---
So yes, in theory a level 65 could be more powerful than a 300. The chances are much in the favour of the 300 being more powerful than the 65.
---
No more comments from me....\*walks out\*
---
It's kind of what I figured but it was hoping maybe someone would be like oh no no no you can trade in for a bunch. Oh well time to start a new character
---
Lol! Glad you enjoyed it
---
Hasn't been broken for me.
---
This would be great. There used to be a glitch where, when dropping lots of quantities of junk, it would drop a seemingly random other inventory item. Notes, Aid, Legendary items, anything non-essential. Lost quite a few good items before I realised I had to check every single bag, every time. This solution would solve that if it's still an issue
---
Plans don't drop just junk
---
The only problem with shelves is that they serve no purpose. 
---
*NYC
---
This was more true early into launch. Now that plenty of the player base has started alternate characters and 5 are allowed per account, it's meaningless. 
---
The chances of a level 300 being more powerful than a 65 are murky at best. As a level 120 PvP character, I love to hunt down level 200+ characters because that's 200+ caps I get every time I kill them. If I see a level 200+ at a workshop he owns, I'm traveling to it and killing him for his caps.
---
Missed a trick by not saying ‚ÄòAppalacation inside!‚Äô
---
I love.seeing posts like this! Normally when I see a group of high levels, I nope the fuck outta there
---
I‚Äôve often thought it could use purpose or utility style paints, like firefighter paint, snow plow paint, ambulance, etc. 
---
I‚Äôve played on PS4 since day 1 and haven‚Äôt grouped with anyone. Enable ESO style text chat please. 
---
There might be a option later on for this, when I explored a observatory the history of it was they could change the weather severely (top of the world has a terminal about a snow blizzard in August and this observatory has the similar story) but sadly majority the terminals were offline and unable to be used. These seem to be a future plan where we can change the weather in game.
---
How about nuclear fallout that looks like snow but gives you rads if you‚Äôre outdoors.  Not constantly being bombarded but random ticks of the meter every now and then as you move around in the ‚Äúsnow‚Äù.  That would be appealing.
---
You don't look down the barrel of a gun at all where I come from ü§î
---
I think there should be a final confirmation box after the players have selected what they want to buy and both players have to agree for it to be finalised.
---
Thanks Major Tom, I was familiar with that one from normal CAMP intrusions by scorched, zombles, robots and Shrek-impersonators üòã May all your journeys in Appalachia be safe ones.
---
That would be cool
---
This. I‚Äôm still casually working towards getting the trophy to kill 20 players. Every time I kill someone with a bounty, their mic gets frantically turned on and they yell obscenities at me. 
---
I even stand by their bag so they can find it easier on their way back. The intense whine and rage makes me want to grief though. Hell, look at all the novellas people post about griefers. It‚Äôs not that bad. Lighten up. 
---
the enemy Mothman on a pole...
---
Climax change? Never heard of it. I'm sure snow would be nice.
---
Right, brown paper bags = gun. 20k in bag=loaded gun. Picking up said bag=pulling trigger.
---
I KOS that stupid bot. He never gets a word out most times.
---
I recently encountered the same issue, and dicked around in my setting trying different sound quality and such and I couldnt resolve the issue. Logged on later and it was still happening but when I changed the setting to only play audio through the headset (this was after i had turned off my xbox) the issue magicly was gone. I suppose i got lucky? I guess give that a try. Hope this helped.
---
Are players able to change the weather or new weathers being added?
---
It‚Äôs one of the selections for the beds you have to change the variation 
---
Keeps you from harming someone accidentally. Prevents you from imitating PVP mode. They can still slap you
---
Only play audio through the headset? Is that only for party chat?
---
How is cap loss in PvP determined?
---
Either you can give a 4 sentence rundown of how dr works or you cant.  If you cant dont be condescending to other people who cant.  Thank you for confirming that the only people who actively engage in PvP use this duped OP gear though.
---
The point I was making with "moderately more damage resistance" is switching armor just means they have to shoot me twice instead of once and Im still going to die in under 5 seconds; the weapons are so OP it doesn't really matter.  It's cute you ignore the "I can tank everything in PvE" part tho; apparently I have *no actual information* but manage to build a character that tanks three scorchbeasts at once.  Doesn't indicate anything about how OP the duped weapons are nope, nothing at all, apparebtly any build is viable against the scorchbeast queen, smfh.
---
I'm not making an opinion. I'm making a logical argument based on the definitions of words.
---
&gt; Destroy weapon&gt;is item favorite? If yes STOP, pop error. If no continue
---
So what you have actually done here is a small algorithm sequence. 
---
&gt; Would it be much more difficult than that?
---
However, this absolutely doesn't reflect if it's easy or hard to write the proper code in the game to implement this algorithm. You don't know what the code looks like behind this small algorithm, what side-effects implementing this code could have. Please, stop thinking it's easy, you just don't know what the real code behind this looks like, you cannot make any judgment like *would it be to hard to implement this?*.
---
That's definitely true! The playerbase, for the most part, is made out of a lot of great, helpful people.
---
I've done something similar with my camp (no glitches or bugs here)
---
Shut up. 
---
I did...
---
I'm not a PVP fan but I'd like to offer my Medic's Weapons and Empath mutation to help keep said posse alive in.  Can't stand Raiders in other Fallout games, can't stand them in 76.
---
Couldn't agree more.Dunno why you're gettin downvoted tho.
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure... reading the project managers terminal it says they were able to create any type of weather they wanted too. But there are plenty of terminals that control the ‚Äòweather machine‚Äô but all are offline or just show blank screens
---
Read the headline: no I won‚Äôt. 
---
I did and wanted to play with my friends. The loading-screen-disappear-bug made us quit. 
---
This game is utter shit and it‚Äôs ridiculously buggy, ugly af and a general disgrace to Bethesda and the fallout series. 
---
Hire this guy he knows
---
I think images here work if you upload them to imgur or another side and link them in your posts
---
Doing the exact same thing. Works alright. I'd just like to be able to launch the two sessions with different .inis (so I could set the 2nd one to low res and have it in a small windows on 2nd monitor).
---
Done :)
---
I‚Äôd like to apply but I have no mod experience and my job requires my full attention so I‚Äôd only be able to do it 5-6am and 4-11 pm est. oh well maybe they will lower their standards in a couple years lol. 
---
I'd like it too - if someone is on a PC I'll gladly buy it (for caps).
---
Just keep scrapping those pipe weapons. 
---
Yes, I‚Äôd really love to have half-length walls. It‚Äôd be great if we can get some round corner or triangular pieces, and having some other structures we could build in FO4 would be really awesome! (Like the balcony piece with cloth hanging on it =p)
---
a char of mine, lv55, has a complete build, specific for pvp, and it has way more better equipments than most my chars over 100, the power of caps, level means nothing after a certain treshold, such treshold is defined by the player's luck on cards during card packs gachapon and his plans to get or no a specific build.
---
Played over 300 hrs and not one TSE weapon dropped from legendaries... had to buy one...
---
What he said ^
---
My experience has been that when this appears to happen it's been because the body very quickly converted to a meat-pile. I haven't actually witnessed any bodies/piles falling through the world or outright disappearing. So long as I am patient and thorough I have (nearly) always been able to retrieve my loot (either from a ghoul or even the SBQ). I've noticed that frequently everyone else has already moved on at that point, incorrectly assuming the worst.
---
Is there a place to bring them other than venture?
---
Are you two on PC by chance?
---
Welcome to fallout 76. I never played any other fallout now I'm hooked.  I love playing with my friends and making new one. 
---
I'm doing the same thing (running the game twice on one PC / two different accounts).  
---
I5-8400, GTX 1060.  
---
With one client running I can usually cap FPS for my monitor (144). With two clients FPS is hovering at 100ish.
---
You can earn it from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
Wow so edgy!!!!!! 
---
Well, that sucks. I guess I see what I can do..
---
Lore-wise it doesn't make sense to have any paints/skin for EPA other than with excavator company logos. But I see many people running with EPA and want them customed...
---
Ok, let's talk logic.
---
1- 4 players v 1 player
---
2- They stacked all the caps on one player, so if a player actually won. He gets the caps for one.
---
3- By your definition, I was the only one there. So. No, other players were targeted.
---
4- They are using the bounty bait to suprise their opponent. 
---
5- The guy chanting on the microphone was harrassing me.
---
6- They are occupying a common farming spot for exp and loot.
---
7. They tried to ruin my gaming session with loads of disadvantages that doesn't merit for pvp.
---
Now, none of these facts allows for fair grounds for an equal pvp. If they didn't use the bounty bait, I would have called it the most cheapest type of pvp, but cmon. They could have all ganked without a trap. 
---
Then again, if this isn't griefing. I'm not sure what it looks like.
---
Camp destroying isnt the only description there is for griefing.
---
I see. Who knows really.
---
Must be a bored kid at the bus stop. Their mommy and daddy probably won't get them the game so they're salty lol. 
---
Well if it's anything like ESO your out of luck.
---
Final sale option seems best,that allows both players clicking to agree for said items to switch sides 
---
What, no love for Spacebar?

---
Make the 10mm great again!
---
Yeah I just didn‚Äôt know if there was more than one place to bring them. 
---
What I'd really like are a few other options to build on as components or just a few legendaries. Even minor effects, not the major maybe dropping as modules only (no plans).
---
It‚Äôs true, they take a 50 percent pvp reduction for 3 hours when they die with no caps but they do it this way as to not loose their caps when they die.
---
I am i am..even though my stash is 800/800 with junks i am ALWAYS short of screws and adhesives. SCREW AND ADHESIVES!! WTF IS IT WITH SCREWS AND ADHESIVES???
---
The atom shop beds show up even if you don't own them, so you must be looking in the wrong spot. It's a separate column from the regular in-game beds
---
Just remove PvP from adventure mode period!
---
That's stupid. Why can't I remove my XBOX account from my bethesda profile ? It's doesn't make any sense
---
Or OP just had a run through Whitesprings. I was legit just thinking how amazing this game would be if it just a tad tighter. Tired of hitting ghouls with health bars that are apparently already dead
---
How this this even getting upvotes? It's not even remotely a rifle. What commando in their right mind would use a light machine gun as a run and gun assault weapon? Doesn't fit the fantasy of a commando.
---
Level + Bounty (if applicable).
---
Massive but empty and devoid of human life? I passed by a ghost city in China once. Spooky to see a giant city with zero lights on in the evening.

Painting set  in the Atom shop would be nice,but I doubt it will happen. Bethesda likes just selling us Sh*t PA Skins like "toys" and "Mothman"
---
Just yesterday I was griefed twice in an hour. My CAMP is at the pond with Mirelurks near the very southernmost parts of Witesprings. I have one single missile turret to help out with the mirelurks, but it can be turned off with a switch nearby. My build is made to look like a brick mansion with several rooms in two levels.
---
First was when I was out adventuring when I noted under the quests a line saying my CAMP was under attack. I looked at the map and saw someone with an over 3000 caps bounty. Being encumbered I server hopped as I couldn't fast travel and then walked back to see what damage had been done. It was strange. My generator in a locked room was destroyed. I had to remove walls to repair it. There was a little damage to almost all items making me think that there had been a scorchbeast attack, but also some direct attack by that player.
---
My build is much too big to make a blueprint of and not even three is enough. I really don't want to move it to repair it so apart from "Repair all" I started storing and replacing the most important walls and items, like the more than half damaged rad shower, also located in that locked room. That's when another player showed up. I saw him running around a corner and followed as I like having visitors. He ran up the stairs and inside. I was following when I saw him draw claws. \*Backing away I looked at the map and saw he had a low wanted value. This time I just quit with alt-F4. I didn't want to rebuild a lot of stuff again.
---
I think it's a pity people have to destroy what others create. I don't find it funny. It's not roleplaying as a raider as you gain nothing from doing it. I don't see the point other than being a dick to others.
---
btw. i do all what say in: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/42807/kw/\~any\~](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42807/kw/~any~)
---
Misspoke. 
---
Twice now 
---
Usually I'm not a grammar nazi but jesus your name is terrible. 
---
I think what they're describing might look different from what you're doing, unless I'm really misunderstanding one of you. You just drop a bag and crouch over it a few times right? Not over the face of the dead player you just killed?
---
Any resolution to your case since then?
---
Correct, but that applies to a very limited set of items, and only for others who do not have the Atom Shop Item as well.
---
You just need to be outgoing and ask. I am not a very social person really and dont mind playing alone but I understand what you are feeling. I would have liked to have made more friends in game than I have even today. I did make some and I very rarely see any of them. I am on almost every night if you ever need help just ping me, I am also on PC and dont mind helping you at all. One great part of this game has been some super people that also helped me along the way!
---
They said they couldn't, although I know some users have been untied. That's why I want to talk to someone from Bethesda support here on Reddit.
---
Odd I just went though there without a problem the other day.
---
An Enclave member talking about the Master Race? Not a huge surprise there. 
---
Lmao, that is so accurate.
---
Server lag. It is why you get shot behind cover in your fps of choice 
---
They didn't remove everyone's inventory from what I gathered during the dupe storm, but it's not currently available on console. Bethesda would not make anything "PC-Exclusive" so this must mean that there are some copies left over. Some dupers claim they can still dupe so that is possible. I wouldn't touch it right now, OP. It will probably be released in one of the new updates announced
---
We used to be able to lock weapons didn't we?! Why not now?
---
With bounty, you just lose the bounty. So if you outlevel someone you're fighting, the easy way to stay at net profit is find something to get you wanted for 10 caps and ensure you're wanted before every engagement/re-engagement.
---
You have to go to...FAHHH HABAHHH
---
No, it's more than that. What about floating ghouls and meat piles? I'm just saying don't ignore issues just because you're tired of hearing about them
---
Bethesda have said they have some in the works right now.
---
I believe this is a visual bug only and you dont have to worry about being banned. When you log out and back in it will be gone so dont delete anything or you might lose it all!!!
---
**"their best items vanishing"**
---
This is not getting anywhere near the attention it deserves. I may have had yet another friend quit just last night after experience this with his primary weapon. Hopefully, he will walk it off and enjoy the new explosive rifle I found for him just last night (yay for me for finding my first explosive!).
---
"*Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know which mother @#%@#$ you gonna get.*" 
---
Exceptional.
---
As someone who gets griefed too frequently, this post was cathartic to read. Great job, OP! On a side-note, I really wish player damage didn't damage armor/PA, whenever I get one-shotted by some bloodied build, it totally destroys my Excavator PA.
---
I understand accedentally scrapping or selling... But, how do you accedentally drop something?
---
Bethesda have said they have some paint jobs being made for the excavator. Can't find source but it was a comment by a community manager on this sub.
---
I would like one in blue to reflect the fast travel TARDIS that it effectively is.
---
Got one last night turning in TD, then accidentally scraped it less then 3 minutes later. :-(
---
They can make one hell of a wall (or hedge maze) appearantly!
---
Odd never had this problem. 
---
I think you need both solutions I provided. The second one is probably more important of a fix, but if you close one door scammers will choose the next best
---
Do not worry. I already updated the post and it shows the Item Reward of the forbidden knowledge I was talking about.
---
Highly, highly doubt that considering most of their comments are on Dankmemes and Animemes. 
---
If you favorite it then you won't be able to scrape it. I am sorry to hear though. *Hugs you*
---
I'm at around 600 hours, level 145, and I've done nothing to level up quicker, but instead opt to target legendary enemies, sometimes ignoring others completely.
---
Based on my daily average, I would estimate that I have looted over 4000 Legendary enemies.
---
You forgot the DKS-501, the Sniper Rifle from previous games that for some reason was replaced by the Hunting Rifle (?) in Fallout 4.
---
Why is it harder to find a target with lots of workshops?
---
I find 50 cal is better
---
And short range sights like a dot or circle. PLEASE!!!!
---
I would pay money to get the service rifle and battle rifle in the game I love those guns. There was a mod for fallout 4 that added the service rifle to the game and it was extremely well done and looked great totally blanking on the name unfortunately. Just hire that person to make some weapons lol. 
---
And they were roommates 
---
They've stated already that they're looking into adding this. 
---
&gt; That sounds like a great gameplay experience for everyone involved.
---
Lol. 
---
Being baited into an incredibly unfair and almost unwinnable situation so that you can have caps and your junk stolen off you. Great experience right there.

Flashbacking to CL4P-TP in Borderlands:TPS - If you hear Pop goes the weasel playing, just run.

Dude, excellent.  You thought your way through this tactically, and griefed the griefers.
---
Well done.
---
Agreed. Upvoted. Weather seems to be nice and sunny 95% of the time, foggy 3%, rain / radstorm 2%. It doesn't feel very immersive or dynamic the way it currently is. Maybe have some bonus loot/ enemies in rad storms and they only cover a portion of the map so you and your buddies have incentive to travel to it and brave the storm .
---
It‚Äôs so realistic 
---
Also brick walls have frames but no glass?
---
I haven‚Äôt been playing long enough for these mutator legendary builds X3
---
Bethesda should add a trading box in the trading UI. Trading box acts like a 3rd party to make both side feel safe about the trading.
---
1. Buyer request items in seller's inventory to see which one interests the buyer.
---
2. Seller can mark items with "Not For Sale"
---
3. If the seller agreed, he can put the requested item in the trading box.
---
4. Seller decides if they want caps or items or both (multiple items) for the payment. Seller can request the items in buyer's inventory.
---
5. Buyer puts the requested item in the trading box.
---
6. Buyer and seller need to click agree to finalize the trading.
---
PS : I don't like the idea of listing your item for 0 caps. Whoever gets the 0 caps item first, they can just abort the trading and then leave lol.
---
almost like it was... designed that way... 
---
Didn't realize that about favorites. I'll have to do that. There's probably zero chance customer service would restore them, right? 
---
50 caps. What color hat do you want?
---
You might want to check out the Atlas project terminals, you'd be intrested. Though the final terminal is locked and seems like nobody on the internet has found the key/code.
---
What we're describing is essentially Fallout 1+2's trading system but with multiplayer. And I agree, I don't like trading stuff for 0 caps
---
Agreed
---
I just keep combining cards until I have one of each rank. When you get an r5, you can then combine 4 more to r4, 3 more to r3, two more to r2 with one left for an r1. 
---
If you already have an r5, you cannot get a duplicate, so you don't have to worry about having duplicate max ranked cards. When you rank up a card, you do not have to rank up your highest ranked card, you can select a lower level card individually to upgrade as well.

Think he was referring to people who intentionally drop the plans for others to find.

I have been smoten for my blasphemy by RNGesus, just killed a 3 star horde target that was lvl 60, and the body despawned after I died while looting it. The meat pile is gone, thinking that it must have dropped to the floor under it, but that's inaccessible by design. Hope they make the game tighter still, but I'll follow the hivemind
---
I agree... People bandwagon on hating this for some reason... It doesn't affect server stability.
---
&gt;  draws the mobs away from the person trying to clear the club house. 
---
Um... What do you think the person with the base is trying to do? He's just there to do the exact same thing. People just mad they can't have all the gouls to themselves because someone decided to make their base their and sacrifice a cool base for one that's practical.
---
&gt; I will break your base every time 
---
So, it's okay for you to grief someone if you don't like how they're getting xp and loot? This is so hypocritical...
---
Did you end up ever seeing the suit?
---
I find it funny that with any bug report or issue there's the "don't ban me" tag because it's an actually serious issue. You might be banned for finding,and then bringing to the devs attention, a bug.
---
Like others have said, most online games with a trading option, have the trade window that people put what they want in there, and both have to confirm at the end. If I want to give you a trappers chest piece for an Anti armor gun, that's it. Confirm, done. If You want to sell me a TSE shotgun +400 caps for my sentinels unyielding, then that's how it goes... both confirm, and done. There's no way for someone to get ANYTHING unless both parties confirm that is the trade, and set it in stone. Also, let us sell ammo in bulk, not at a per bullet price.
---
 "holding someone's Camp hostage is pretty much exactly what all raiders do in FO4, since they shake them down for resources". Fallout 4 raider factions sought to control resources. Chems, resources and violence. Very rare that raiders ever attacked something that would earn them something.

Sometimes the items jump and bounce when selecting what you are selling at a vendor,  i think this happens when dropping stuff also.   
---
Your name is hilarious!

AC:Kyoto confirmed
---
Are your guns being repaired with Weapon Artisan 3?  I only run Gunsmith 1 and my gatlings last a long long time.  IMO its not worth it to run Gunsmith vs. other things more useful for the fight itself (I have First Aid 3 for eg).
---
I absolutely agree.  It‚Äôs purely strategic but it‚Äôs totally a grief move to team up and lure you in. 
---
If something this simple is made difficult due to the core strcuture of the game, there‚Äôs a MUCH bigger issue here.
---
You're right. I didn't think about this. But I'm never dropping stuff in the heat of the moment. I usually wait till I'm done doing whatever it is, then drop stuff when I'm at camp or something. If it happens I usually notice.
---
The German client say "..." at bravo and Charlie. Forgot to mention that.
---
Nope, not a dev room item. The Marine Tactical helmet may be but he regular Marine Helmet isn't and the plans are found in several places.  Its the one that looks like a bug.  The plans can be found at the Watuga BOS vendor and at Harpers Ferry however it's random.  I believe they could also be part of loot drops for BOS events but not 100% sure.
---
To help understand the high numbers, consider my 4 hours of play time yesterday;
---
* 1 hour of Trading with Players &amp; Vendors
---
* 1 hour shifting items to other characters (I have 7 &amp; I run 2 Xboxes)
---
* 1 hour of general maintenance (Repairing, Modding, Crafting)
---
* 1 hour of Hunting/Killing which yielded the following legendary items:
---
   * 26 Armor Pieces, (3 were 2\*, all others were 1\*)
---
      * 22 were sold to vendors, or placed in World containers
---
   * 17 Weapons, (3 were 2\*, all others were 1\*)
---
      * 15 were sold to vendors, or placed in World containers

I would classify the session as a slow one, since every server I was on (4 of them) had a turret CAMP at the Golf Club.

Go into social menu, "join" one of the people you recently interacted with... you don't have to be friends with them
---
There could also be a level 50 character walking around with top tier guns and armor. They could easily go into the fallout Reddit/Discord/Facebook markets, and buy a full top tier loadout if they are at the 25K CAPS limit, especially if they have stuff for trade. Freaking nurses uniforms can trade for a ridiculous weapon. I see what you are saying though, I am less likely to engage in a higher level character, just from the stigma of every other online game. 
---
Lmaooooo thx!!!!
---
You can straight from the vault to Sam's bunker and join the enclave as it is now. I doubt they would put a minimum level on it. Maybe more of a "you about to get rekt" message.
---
Do items still fall through the floor when dropping?  It happened to me a long time ago so now i still drop one thing, look at the bag then put the rest i want to drop/ give in the bag.
---
Because everyone speaks English as first language, right? 
---
ooh decals
---
that'd be awesome
---
I find them all the time in the Enclave, and sometimes in army forts
---
If the owner of the camp is in the area I will kindly explain to them how annoying this is and please remove your turrets or else. Most of the time they server hop I really do enjoy destroying there base in front of them. Getting my wanted status finding a low level player and asking them to please kill me because I did a public service at White Spring golf course. ( It is funny how reluctant some players are to kill a level 100+ player I have to beg sometimes.)
---
You can still scrap favorites, and what is gone is gone.
---
Latest leaks shows it almost releasing F2P can't wait for it! I hope the ones that bought them selfs in pre-alpha enjoyed it!
---
I‚Äôve actually just magically lost my hat üòÇ
---
All white everything please :) 
---
you can only build atom shop items in your own camp and community workshops not your friends camp
---
yeah time to stop leveling up my main toon
---
it's fine I've been wanting to start over anyways
---
Confirmed. I‚Äôve only done taming one time, and it was a L14 Snally. He made it to camp but was killed by another player about 2 hours later. I redistributed my Charisma points and that was the end of my taming experiment. 
---
"All you need is to add a flag saying don't let people build camps next to my favorite farming location unless they're in a team with four other players and wearing power armor for melee builds."
---
The level 50 wanted dude brought a tingle to my stomache. More than all of the other 3 all together.
---
A PvE only server is what a lot of people want, myself included.  I would like to see someone do a poll if they have not already, to see if this is a minority or majority view.  I also understand that the people on this sub are not a true cross-section of the playerbase.
---
166
---
So did Bethesda or someone say that somewhere?
---
Plus. Make me a list of all the functional  differences between an AK-47 and Type 56-4 and you‚Äôll see that a type 56-4 is a Chinese reverse engineered al-47.   Some gun, same mags, same drums being used.  So point still stands. 
---
Also majority of ppl don‚Äôt know what type 56-4 is.  So why use it in the example..
---
That's pretty awesome!
---
I assume you mean CAMPS near the golf clubhouse. I like being able to CAMP on the golf course. In my opinion its one of the nicer looking areas the game.
---
That was the only I wanted to say when it all went down hahahahaaha
---
I use mine to control my power door.  I connected it so its outside my building and put a lock on it. From what I can gather its basically a control point for switches you place in your electrical grid.  Most likely that will change as the game progresses but for now that the only use I can find for it. 
---
Upvoted. The trading window definitely needs refining. Inspection of items effects, trading item for item securely and even saved prices that can be set anytime.
---
I've never seen that many players in one spot. Must have been half the server there. First time I've felt like I was in classic Fallout
---
Yes...but you made the point for him. You have a lvl 320 feeding a lvl 120 equipment. In general a higher level player will be better equipped than a lower.
---
to be honest, I can deal with all the glitches.
---
the PVP element is about to ruin the game for me.
---
I just bought an Xbox one after 7-8 year hiatus from gaming. (kids)
---
Im so disappointed in the new xbox and this effing game its taking a lot of effort to not drag it all outside, dump a magazine in it then load it with tannerite and give it a viking funeral. 
---
I am so sick of fighting off asshats. having to watch the map and fast travel back to camp any time someone is near it to make sure im not getting trashed. and christ is I cant keep exploring the map with out some Dbag jumping out the bushes and blasting the crap out of me.
---
No.
---
Agree on all account, including the ammo. The ammo problem is going to be an issue when it comes to player vending for sure. If you think someone's going to buy 5 mm for a cap per round, you're wrong.
---
Same thing happened to me after about the 2 weeks after release.
---
My favorite location is south of Silo Site Alpha, a stream ends at a small pond. I think it makes a great build location. If you like I can send you a picture of my camp.
---
This.  Also don't aim at his head, aim below that for his thrusters otherwise you're just wasting ammo.  
---
I'm not saying his assumption is wrong, but there's no way to tell if a level 120 is getting funneled equipment or if they're playing with their own drops. Level does not indicate time spent playing the game, so it means nothing
---
&gt;An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
You will reset your character to level 1 and become Legendary. It does not matter if you reset your level 51 or level 333. You will only reach that "legendary status". Keep in mind that the level restrictions for weapons might apply. So you might not be able to use your high-end gear - except there is a powerful/legendary ability to get rid of level restrictions.
---
I also don't think that you will be able to reset your character a second time when reaching level 50 at legendary. This would inflict a lot balancing issues when 5\* legendary player are fighting against "normal" players.
---
Also the text is about becoming Legendary with additional benefits and not gaining prestige levels (like in Battlefield) for additional cosmetics/challenges.
---
How had no one made a "build the wall" joke??
---
Controls switches, speaker sound pitch, light box colors and power counter value. Pretty useless at the moment but could be a great camp item with some work. Personally I want to lock holotapes, especially the games, into them and have them run like iPods and arcade machines :)
---
I can image it. The Radiation storm flows through the sky and the air has a sticky irritated feel throughout the atmosphere. A figure stood on the road with another figure that was smaller than the first figure.
---
‚ÄúI am thirsty...‚Äù The young girl mumble to the bigger figure that wore rusty combat armor full set that seem to see better days and army uniform and combat helmet. ‚ÄúJust hold on. There's a responder posted area ahead of us and we will get there soon. Here take a Radaway and Rad-X.‚Äù The girls blue eyes that seem to shine through the foggy green air was mysterious as the soldier looked down at her meanwhile handing her the items. She took them into her hands and heard a twig snap nearby. The soldier hid the young girl behind his back and aim his combat rifle at the direction of the sound and kneel down in aim position. ‚ÄúIt seems that we are not alone. Let's get out of here as quickly as possible... It seems we are not alone but stick very close and grab hold onto my leg strap.‚Äù The little girl was frightened by low growls that were coming from some bushes and her small hand shaky held onto his combat armor strap but soon she accidentally dropped the small bottle of Rad-X which provoked a few mutant hounds. ‚ÄúArgh! Hold on to me!‚Äù The soldier held up the girl on his shoulder and begin to run down the road while using his other hand to fire his combat rifle at the hounds that was howling loudly and begin to charge at them at full speed. The Soldier took one hound down that went through its head and continue to fire the best he can while the radiation storm thunder loudly above the skies which startles the young girl. ‚ÄúHey! Focus! I need you to pull that fragmentation grenade and pull the pin and throw it at those hounds as hard as you can throw it!!‚Äù The young girl stared at the hounds rushing at them. Their sharp jaws snapping towards them and barking unnaturally with their infected and swollen red eyes angrily and viciously looking directly into her eyes. The young girl started to tear up. ‚ÄúI-I'm scared!‚Äù The soldier growls under his breath and shot another round at the hounds and the soldier soon felt his legs burning slowly and reaching his limit. ‚ÄúFocus already! Just do as I told you! Or we both end up hound food!‚Äù 
---
The young girl opens her eyes again and took the grenade from his porch and tried pulling the pin as hard as she can with her cheeks puffing up and flushing through her pale skin face. The pin soon came off and the girl almost dropped it before the soldier saw a couple of responders on standby and took noticed of the soldier and a young girl but soon they rose their rifles after noticing what was chasing them on the round. The girl was surprised how heavy it was considering she had to hold it in both her small hands and soon she threw the fragmentation grenade as hard as she can towards the hounds. The mutant hounds stopped suddenly when they noticed an object flying towards them and one of them violently gulp it before its eyes widen at the feeling of something hot heating up in its stomach and soon a loud explosion was heard. The soldier soon panted after entering the gates that the responders were a station at and came to aid the grown man and the young girl that was with him. ‚ÄúYou did good kid...‚Äù The soldier said with a small smile as the young girl wipe her own tears and smiled back at him before he brushes her hair. ‚ÄúHehe! Hey, stop that!‚Äù The soldier laughed at this before looking up at the sky clearing and revealing the hot sun shining down on them. ‚ÄúAbout time...‚Äù The soldier mumble under his breath and soon realize that the young girl was hugging him and he such to himself before returning the hug. ‚ÄúIts going to be alright.‚Äù The End.
---
I'm so tired of that annoying bot he's down before he can make a drop.
---
You just need something that causes staggering
---
Because a type 56-4 is a chinese made knock off of a kaleshnikov that was originally manufactured in the fifties, still in use today, and is chambered in 5.56x45mm.
---
And there isnt much of a difference, aside from the fact that the 56-4, being a rechambered 56-1 which itself is a copy of the AK-s has a hammer retarder so the firing pin cant strike the primer of the round till the cartridge is gully seated in the chamber. I might be wrong on this next point, but I believe the 56-1 had a milled receiver vice the stamped one AK-47s had. That and, being of chinese make and chambered for the same round as the game one, it makes the most logical sense that if the one in the game is "taken" from real life it would be this one.
---
It isnt my problem that a majority of people are unaware of a certain type of gun. Id be unaware of it too if I hadnt worked with firearms for the last few years lol
---
You shelve not pass
---
To build on this; I'd like to see the return of stuff like the Tesla variants. But with both the effects and visual changes accompanying it.
---
First time I built the telsa bracers on a suit of PA I was so disappointed. 
---
Or really the fact that none of the mods add visual flair to a suit of PA. It's disappointing.
---
First rule of fight club: we don‚Äôt talk about fight club.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen quite a bit since last weeks patch hit.
---
This is SPECTACULAR.
---
Caught myself on this, being chinese had nothing tondo with it; except that the Norinco company primarily manufactures the 56-4 for export!
---
And I'm definitely that guy who would prefer a solitary game. My handle is "fineuntilucamealong". I see the ownership of a resource site in the game as signing up for a Preston Garvey your. You have to go defend your settlement over and over.
---
That‚Äôs what I think may be happening... the meat piles are dropping at the enemies actual spawn point and not where they died.
---
so it takes 15min in real life it takes 3 days :P
---
I will always do this if I drop trade but I always just use the trade menu unless I'm giving you a lot of stuff all at once. 
---
I've been trying to get rid of my 10.1K rounds of 5mm forever haha. I've seen people selling it at about 5 or 6 bullets per cap. It turns into this whole "hey, I'll sell you 2k bullets at 1 cap per, and then you have to trust me that I'll give you the rest for 0 CAPS". 
---
The other issue is people doing modification services on guns and armor. I've never done it, but I see people advertise that they will put , for example, a Dense mod on your combat chest. So you're saying that I hand over my valuable chest piece, and hope you give it back? It would be cool if they made some sort of "middle man" vending machine, or let you put your stuff + CAPS into a crafting table to be modified by someone else. Don't let anyone but the owner be able to take it back out when it's done. 
---
This strangely reminds me more of sZone than The Glow. Either way it's cheeki breeki
---
Really?
---
&gt; IT WAS A TRAP!!! LOL...
---
Abusing the game mechanics
---
&gt; "Run Forest! Run!"
---
Trolling
---
Abusing the game mechanics so you don't know that people are working together is the DEFINITION of griefing... it is "grief" because you see a wanted person and think you can kill them because there's others around him but they are actually working together to GRIEF you. It isn't a team gank, it is a trap, an abuse, a use of outside-the-game social skills to get friends together to gang up on a single person who may not have the time or desire. And then they come after him with slaps.
---
    Griefer. A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game in unintended ways.
---
Was it intended that 4 people can work together and one can pretend to be wanted, surrounded by 3 people who SHOULD kill him but don't so they can bait others into getting killed? Definitely not.
---
This is griefing plain and simple. 4 on 1 is not a grief, what's grief is abusing the game mechanics in unintended ways so you do not see the 4 players working together to kill you from the start. Not only is there obvious trolling, there's deception.
---
Griefing doesn't mean "killing the guy over and over" it's a mindset, to cause pain and suffering to players who don't want that. It COULD have been you, or someone else who wasn't an expert.
---
[Scrap All Junk] exceptions _literally_ work by adding the "NoAutoScrapJunk" keyword to the items you want to not be autoscrapped. Trouble is, that keyword applies not only to autoscrapping in the UI but also to identifying items which can be used to collect components while crafting. So if "NoAutoScrapJunk" is added to Bulk items, their components won't be directly usable in crafting.  Fixing this requires creating two separate autoscrap functions and probably a second keyword to distinguish between "don't autoscrap in UI" and "don't autoscrap when crafting", but since there's only a single autoscrap function at present.
---
What bothers me more is the "BlockSuperDuperPerk" keyword on Bulk items because I'm pretty sure that wasn't there in earlier versions...
---
Now fill them with bobbleheads
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt understand why everything else has its stats listed but not the magazines. It does not seem like it would be hard for them to add, as it is only a few lines of text (but what do I know?). I guess it could be an oversight or a glitch. Sometimes you get a clue as to what they do from the headlines on their cover, but that is too ambiguous. It‚Äôs getting to where I know what some of them do and where they spawn, but they still need to add the descriptions.
---
No BSG said in the ads at first " add nuka dark to your nuka collection" which clearly is insinuating that they were attempting to make it sound identical to the nuke cola bottles already sold at target from the fo4 launch. They were made by Jones soda company and used glass bottles. 
---
hes right, tho.  the anti pvp faction of this sub throw around the word 'karma' every day and clearly have no idea what it actually means
---
I listen to Appalachia radio all the time, and that never happened to me (PS4).
---
On a related note, I'd really like to get more music, or our own playlists if copyright issues are the problem for BGS.
---
With the mutation, you also become visible as you fire/reload. 
---
My own person view is the legendary effect should have an advantage over "just" a mutation. Legendary implies something that is, well, legendary. A mutation is someone anyone can get by standing in the river for a few minutes. 
---
I think that last one is asking for more than bethesda should fix. The current issues should have been available in the base game by default. If players want to do things like offer their services, that's on players to figure out.
---
And I say that as the power armor crafter of my team. 
---
Wait what do you mean by legendary players? And is this something Bethesda has confirmed?
---
I just built my CAMP up near the Slocum's Joe west of the Overseer's CAMP, so if you're on PS4 come say hi
---
yes, and i'd like to see a list of items that any given mod applies to...I buy mods only to find they dont work with my gear.  This is not a lot to ask, and minimal impact on servers.
---
And also the ability to split perk card stacks... example... I have quite a few static perk cards that are stacked to max out the perk... I also have animated versions of those cards that are not leveled yet because I can‚Äôt bring myself to ‚Äúwaste‚Äù a levelup on a card I already have just to level my animated card.
---
It would be nice if we could break up the leveled perk cards so we can redistribute them to any animated cards we own or just to lower the stack perk value for reworking our perks.
---
I am sure that you are unable to scrape favorites. It doesn't show for me whenever I scrap clothing's unless it is not favorite.
---
I also have the radio on all the time, have been playing since November, and last night was the first time.
---
Since we're on related notes, I'd also like some more music, or at least a DJ! A robot DJ would totally fit, and would add some personality to the station. Fallout 3 had Three Dog and Agatha, New Vegas had Mr. New Vegas, 4 had Travis. I know there's a mod that adds this, which is awesome, but how about something official?
---
So. Making this comment I only read the first paragraph because you stated the fact that the type 56-4 variant is 5.56x45
---
Well in fallout, you use 7.62 ammo. So therefore it cannot be a 56-4 
---
And honestly milled versus stamped? Come on man. That‚Äôs not a very functional difference. That really only matters in the longevity of the gun. 
---
I need your proof on where Bethesda saying it is a 56-4.  If you want to back track and say it is a 56-1 then that‚Äôs fine
---
But my point on the discussion about drums stands, but I guess you weren‚Äôt trying to be apart of that discussion anyways 
---
Yea, I understand they absolutely **need** to fix the basic mechanics first and foremost. In one of their "inside the vault" series, Bethesda said that they want players to continue to mod other players stuff, but I'm wondering if they have something planned to safely do it? 
---
hell my pvp pistol build maxed out at level 55, every level after that is just a pvp disadvantage.  the higher lvl u are, the more caps u lose
---
I see. I check it out one day. But thank you for letting me know.
---
Just wait for the summer update.
---
&gt;**New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige  system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting  their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
So will get your re-roll for free when becoming legendary - in some sense. In addition you will get some more powerful abilities.
---
Indeed. I've experienced both. Some seemingly 'reset' to their spawn location and some drop nearby but usually not where the corpse fell on my screen. This began occurring for me (or I started noticing it) after the most recent patch.
---
Yes, but by having the mutation you limit your remaining armor choice to Weightless only or be fully naked; therefore, the mutation should be better than the Chameleon armor IMO
---
That's interesting. But this method is probably easier and faster. And how many did you get?
---
hated that quest, but quite realistic.
---
Are you sure it isn't Military Fatigues?
---
I don‚Äôt see the issue here.  If you don‚Äôt like where someone‚Äôs CAMP is located, destroy it.  That‚Äôs part of the game!  To restrict some players because it would otherwise inconvenience you isn‚Äôt right, either.  Keep in mind Whitesprings isn‚Äôt solely meant for nuking.
---
I hate team greifers, thank you for wrecking their shit. 
---
What ammo are you using for your handmade? Lol The one in 76 uses 5.56.
---
And you're gonna ignore the hammer retarder to cherry pick on the milled vice stamped? I dunno man, not having an early discharge and having my hand blown off seems a pretty big difference lol.
---
And i mean, I figured the drum discussion was over. H&amp;K have the MP5/10; and already you can buy drum mags for the standard versions. It wouldnt be a hard leap to be able to make a 10mm mag version, since a 10mm round is basically a crappier .45.
---
Check nuke silo status via holotape you've been given. And you don't need the codes from officers, you'll need 8-digit codes from website that publish them every week for everyone...
---
My PvP is usually me going around bounty hunting.  I see a wanted person on the map and it's like "Oh a piece of candy!"  I go collect the bounty and to me if you have a bounty and your bag drops its free for the taking.  I see the points you make in this post and they are very valid.  I wouldn't consider myself a raider or griefer, more like a wasteland avenger.  You get a bounty I'm coming to collect it and whatever you drop.  Save your sob story, beg all you want, justice is blind and deaf yet hits like a ton of bricks with my axe!  
---
Ok that may have a been a bit over the top but you get my point...
---
I have a decent imagination, but it's still difficult to pretend you don't want a jetpack.
---
* Screeches in service rifle * honestly I would love to see a m16 type weapon added to the game 
---
Would be interesting to see how many people downloaded / bought the upgraded settlement attacks mod for FO4. Think this is just affecting a subset of players, who like the base building aspect.
---
Have you lost a paper bag lately into the ground?  I one time this happened i was giving someone some bulk screws, but i was the one that got screwed as they fell into the ground by the gulf course shop
---
Whitesprings isn‚Äôt intended solely for higher levels.
---
&gt;  And you don't need the codes from officers, you'll need 8-digit codes from website that publish them every week for everyone...
---
Well, you could do the code breaking yourself with the codes from the Officers.
---
Oh it was my pleasure to put a dent into their day.
---
Frustrating when Whitesprings has been levelled down?  Whitesprings quests begin around level 15.
---
I don't understand the "trap". Don't you have to shoot the other players before they'll do full damage? Couldn't you just walk away if they attacked assuming you didn't freak out and shoot them back? 
---
of course you can, but is it worth the time? ;)
---
same deal for Can Do and the one that lets you "search" medical boxes
---
I, too, didn't realize this for a long time and effectively was using one of these prrks to no benefit. I only learned it when it was mentioned in a Juicehead video.
---
Unless you can find a good 3star super sledge, id say all rise is good
---
Might be, I'm not sure the status of NukaCrypt today, but earlier this week it had been a bit slow, with the owner saying a few of the usual breakers not playing anymore?  Something along those lines.  For a while at least, Silo A was the only code available, and it was because someone brute forced it with a couple code pieces and luck on the code word choices.
---
Negative 
---
Sunny skies is weather.
---
Yeah, at some point you‚Äôre just PvP bait. 
---
I definitely agree that something different needs to happen so these sorts of bases don‚Äôt pop up anymore but I hope they don‚Äôt remove the ability to build in that area entirely. I move my tent there throughout my travels as it‚Äôs a nice little vacation spot from time to time. 
---
people who provoke pvp aren't automatically griefers.....maybe I'm naive, but them baiting you into pvp and you going after a bounty via pvp seem like the same thing to me.....
---
Now that it is completed I think it was pretty funny.  While completing it though I was ready to toss my controller across the room!
---
I met two of my best friends in fo76 at flatwoods. Its a more peaceful place where high levels will tend to be more helpful.
---
rare on either camdon park or whelch station think i got em from both but camdon seems to carry it more often for me.
---
Too much sunny skies.
---
Got some from Grafton station 2 days ago. Plan: Lever Gun.
---
oh, didn't knew about the problems that week - last time I was launching a nuke, 8-digit codes for all silos were decrypted and available.
---
It's Plan: Lever Gun.  It's sold in a few places... I cannot remember though.  Grafton Station or City vendor maybe?
---
Raiders would be a good added faction to the game
---
Anything that can cloak looking at you motherfucking Chameleon deathclaw 
---
I tried to, but they started chasing and shooting me.
---
Once I gained ground on them. I went back for blood.
---
So you're saying that a group of people who will have one person constantly poke and annoy you for lengthy periods of time to provoke a response are the exact same as people who go after other people who have bounties on their heads.
---
I will play w/ you on PC. PM me for our discord. IGN: OceanSlim

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Almost certain it's in watoga
---
Really it would be nice if they made the range cover the map. Otherwise it's like having a gun that only works sometimes. The artillery isn't so powerful that it's worth moving your camp repeatedly to cover whatever area you're working in at the time. There are a lot of people who are using the camp as a semi permanent settlement instead of it's intended high mobility role anyway, so it would be nice if they could change artillery to reflect that a lot of people aren't using the camp like they expected.
---
Ya.  The NukaCrypt site is a community (or, in the case now, apparently a smaller number of people) effort, and if people aren't actively decoding they won't have much there.
---
You can use the solver to help you decipher the codes you find though.
---
But, I am not sure what makes the Bunker boards update.  I've only looked at them a few times.
---
grafton vendors - 100% spawn as for yesterday. 
---
Excellent story, thanks so much for sharing it!!
---
Maybe he picked the lock first?
---
I need sights more than anything. The iron sights are probably the worst in the game.
---
Ahh, I remember my days of wanted baiting. My team and I were far more clever with it though. You might say we were master baiters, lol. It wasn't always this way though. When we first tried it, it actually started at the monorail station. I'd  amass a huge bounty, hide up top and watch people run around down below trying to figure out where I was. This worked for a time, but eventually people got clever. Problem was, so did we...
---
At one point I had accidentally gained a 10 cap bounty. Shot at a ghoul that was attacking a settlement that was mostly foundation. Shotgun hits it and boom, bounty. So I ran to my buds base, just a simple thing, and somebody came to collect. They picked his lock, became wanted and we found ourselves a few caps richer.
---
We tried different designs for baiting bases, but there was one that stood above the rest. I wont go into too many details, but what it involved was a locked door, an unlocked door, another locked door, a trap door, a 2 story fall, a mess of punji boards and a couple rocket turrets.
---
Basically, intruder picks lock and becomes wanted, walks through unlocked door up to another locked door. There is a wall with a window to the right where the initially wanted player stands. He signals a player a floor below to edit the floor out from under the intruder. Intruder falls into enclosed space full of punji boards and a couple rocket turrets. Ahh those were the good ol days.
---
Yes!
---
**Also, we need better legendary non-PA equipment.**
---
I've tried everything in non-PA and it just wont cut it in every situation.  I wont soak up a dozen perk slots for non-PA gear to be "better." It makes no sense that wearing armor pieces under PA doesn't stack. 
---
BGS please allow this.
---
Glad you enjoyed it.
---
That sounds awesome! Do you remember what it was called?
---
I used a lot of healing salve in the Forest my first 15 levels or so, same as the stim and easy to farm/craft
---
The automatic pipe rifle is pitiful though, the biggest magazine can only hold 18 rounds while the handmade can hold 85. If I'm using ain inferior weapon at least give me a way to waste more ammo!
---
Got mine from Grafton station
---
&gt; Yes, but by having the mutation you limit your remaining armor choice to Weightless only or be fully naked; 
---
Yea, but that's the negative of the mutation, since it doesn't have any innate negatives (and it's the only mutation without a negative, I believe). 
---
In the 50-60 or so hours i've put in the game, i've only seen two radstorms. Kinda sad, really. 
---
If they were more frequent and spawned in more glowing enemies, that'd be cool.
---
Just tried this and it seems to have worked. I will give it more of a go this weekend. 
---
Charleston has always been a problem for me along with Grafton when the Monster is on parade.
---
I suggested this yesterday and Lady Devann posted about it being a good idea so maybe it will get mentioned to the devs.   https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avgvg6/suggestion_about_magazines/
---
Hmm i've been trying with my Adrenaline Cards I have a 5 and a 2 but would prefer 4 and two and when I tried to leave the second card at 4 and start a new one to 2 it wouldn't let me.
---
No, Camp Venture is the only place to turn in Technical Data. 
---
I still think the original idea was a battle to claim resources, not realising that in practice like you say most (my peeve is screws) of the resources are so abundant anyway.
---
Just not sure why they would make available a full suite of building options into workshops if all they wanted them to be was a ffa no bounty PvP flag.
---
You can 'layer' the walls so that both sides of a brick wall are the white or the brick. I found it easiest to do with the door frame piece, then store/scrap option and replace it with a full wall. My cabin is divided in two with a brick wall, and white on both sides.
---
Make sure no furniture is hard up against the wall while you're trying to place it, as that can cause problems.
---
It would be easier if there were more options, but this might help in the short term! Good luck.
---
Exactly i use to have a really cool base in the savage divide right at twin lakes and now i have this shitty looking one but it really helps for getting legendaries, junk, and xp,
---
That‚Äôs not true at all, you can still scrap favorites. 
---
They aren't raiders, maybe scavengers at best. The game mechanics at present don't allow raiding. So far the so called raiders I have seen are nothing more than hosers who don't want to wait in a line at a merchant and vandals who want to smash a camp. I'm sure they'd love to be raiders but they are just sad little pathetic wannabe griefers.
---
Well hoarding loads of caps on a bounty signals pvp, which isn't like this sleazy group I came across.
---
Then again, I like the creativity that you and your friends use. I would definetly enjoy running into such an encounter. Win or lose, seems like it would be interesting.
---
Dude, you've never played a PVP game before have you? it's like that in every PVP game where some people's only objective is to kill you. Try Miscreated, try rust, it's all pubg with bases. If someone can kill you in a video game, they will try.
---
No, you can‚Äôt scrap Legendaries. Any non legendary you have favorited will scrap, so be careful. 
---
I did it fine on a round rug.  You might need a non-flat section of ground to place it.
---
Second rule of fight club: YOU DON‚ÄôT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB!
---
I always go for this kind of build. I use mainly heavy weapons and i live in power armor. I maxed in strength and intelligence. I chose these because there are good heavy weapons perks in strength like heavy gunner and bear arms. And intelligence is good for all the power armor perks like stabilised and power user. For weapon choice i mainly use 50cal mg and gatling gun. And super sledge backup melee. For a juggernaut build, i have found these most effective. Hope this helps.
---
I don't even play the game but that was a great story... thanks
---
Your favorites may be legendary items, which do not show when you're in the scrap items interface.
---
I shot a scorched in Flatwoods yesterday in that building near the agriculture center.  He fell over the balcony and vanished on the way down.  Poof!
---
A secret door about halfway up allowed a player to collect dropped loot.
---
It was a powered door with a four digit code I haven‚Äôt told anyone. Sorry for the confusion. That‚Äôs also why I couldn‚Äôt get in without power.
---
You're not the only one that want's no PvP mode, believe me. I'm 173 and never engaged in any PvP fights except of few times when friend or someone asked me to remove wanted status. Let those who want do mayhem in PvP mode and other allow to have "Leave-me-alone" mode....
---
I got mine at Grafton station.
---
And the fact that it throws feces at you
---
This might be old news but I just saw it at Watoga for 1701 caps lol 
---
Really needs to fire in parallel with other guns, have drastically larger aoe (was maybe 2m when I tried), and do improved damage.  Did a 4 gun battery and it couldn't do more then badly wound a handful of level 30 mole miners over the ~2 min salvo.
---
PVP is more like a duelist unless you are using an exploit.   
---
The others aren't raiders, maybe scavengers at best. The game mechanics at  present don't allow raiding. So far the so called raiders I have seen  are nothing more than hosers who don't want to wait in a line at a  merchant and vandals who want to smash a camp. I'm sure they'd love to  be raiders but they are just sad little pathetic wannabe griefers. 
---
I should have clarified. I meant when you walk in or walk around and all ghouls are Level 9-22 and no glowing ones instead of level 62 with glowing and legendaries. 
---
It‚Äôs not the new players fault but it is a little frustrating to run in and only see low level enemies. 
---
I have a quad combat shotgun and 'Enforcer' equipped, so I can cripple the bitch in no time at all! üòÄüî´
---
Are you scrapping all your junk before putting it in your stash? Cuz I too am hoarder but damn dude, it's kinda crazy to have a 800/800 at level 12.
---
lol i feel like im reading the hunger games üòÇ gg!
---
No clue. I was on a tour bus traveling two between two not-dead cities and we saw the ghost city from the highway. The tour guide didn't say anything. ^(Probably because you can't speak ill of China without being punished or "disappearing".)
---
Hmm, now I have to check when I get home.. It's easy for me to get confused, because I have about 250 different apparel in my stash lol. I could be completely wrong!
---
Exactly, and as such, it cant be reduced by the Class Freak card...so it needs a little buff tomake it worth having. Not much of a buff, but allowing a few seconds crouched movement before needing to 'rest' should be enough.
---
Else, it is a pointless mutation and it will be more beneficial to have one piece of chameleon armor and the rest of your armor being other 3\*.
---
The ability just to 'stand' is not worth it; standing removes your sneak damage buff.
---
Yeah.  I noticed that we had a fully packed backpack on the bed in our apartments but we wander into the wasteland and leave it sitting there.  "Best and brightest" my butt.  :)  Welcome to the wastelands!
---
Yep
---
I mean the queen is easy asf :/
---
If you want to take something somebody else has in game then you are playing as some sort of raider (and I agree obviously not a griefer) but to say building up a defence is an unintended tactic doesn't make sense either. What did they think players were going to do with those walls? 
---
Raider like actions gain you a bounty in any other situation but this, doesn't seem consistent.
---
For the love of god yes... 
---
I may have gotten confused with the name.. I might only have clean military ones
---
If we build the border wall with shelves, we wont have to worry ever going over budget. No more government shutdowns
---
Probably the skeletons they place so that when you bump them they start to articulate a certain way very slowly. Not all of them do that but every once in a while you find one and you sit there wondering if you're crazy or if that thing just did that on purpose.
---
1 - but they didn't chase you down and force you to go after the bounty
---
2 - they set a trap/ambush...seems like a legit tactic to me to entice somebody into pvp..albeit a once sided confrontation
---
3 - you fell into their ambush...
---
4 - again, seems like a legit tactic to bait a target
---
5 - i agree, that guy is probably a dick
---
6 - they tactfully chose a good spot to set their trap
---
7 - they went into a planned fight giving themself the advantage..seems like a good plan
---
pvp is like a street fight...is it supposed to be fair, or is the point to win (within the boundries of the game, not nonsense like stacked bobblehead exploits)
---
This (again, in my opinion) is PVP...griefing seems more like pvp is FORCED upon players, repeatedly and unescapably
---
Camp destroying is dick also...
---
on top of all this...good job taking them out though
---
I'd file this under "be careful what you wish for". I see rain, clouds, and sun glare through the mist often often enough. I enjoy the weather, but I really don't need to see it all the time. Maybe a few more radstorms would be interesting, but not too many more. 
---
Dangerous weather that forced players to hide in buildings until it passed would be realistic, but really boring. 
---
Fallout players mad at dupers......
---
Anthem players mad they don't have dupers......
---
Lol. Fair enough. I just feel like I'd want the other stuff more.
---
This was a cool story! Dumb question though: where can i learn more about the builds you referenced (bloodied sniper).  I didn't see a reference to build guide in the sidebar so apologies if it's there.
---
I have no interest in those games. I'm here to play Fallout. I've played some Conan Exiles. It's quite enjoyable, and I never have to see another player because it has the option to play it solo.
---
That's just paranoia. I have not heard of a single person reporting a bug who ended up being banned, not even the people who accidentally clipped into the vaults.
---
&gt; Lore-wise it doesn't make sense
---
There are paint cans all over the wasteland. No lore reason why it couldn't be painted a different color, lol
---
What about an in between, where things aren't pristine, but have unbroken windows, like the brick set?
---
It‚Äôs the nature of the type of game. People get to the end game and that‚Äôs one of the big things to do. Unfortunately that means sometimes a player is going to want to purposely get a bounty for the fun of it. 
---
Yeah Bethesda get you're shit straight. I accidentally lost my responder fire helmet and now been running around with shit kids one. I want my negative 2 perception back.
---
Was it ever not useless?
---
hear! hear!
---
One thing I want is a trap door. 
---
Most players will not have the patience to level into the hundreds just to have more flexibility with their perks. The whole point of the perk system in Fallout 76 is that it is more flexible, otherwise we may as well have the old system back. 
---
You've pretty much done everything in the game by level 50 besides collecting each minute Ultracite and X-01 power armor mod that drops/sells using RNG. Most players are not going to keep playing for hours upon hours just to get enough duplicates to allow different play styles.
---
Scrap all junk -&gt;store all junks
---
nice post, OP. Glad to see some of this excessively friendly player base is coming around to the idea that negative player interactions can be a fun and immersive.
---
I'm unusual as a F76 player in that I don't believe "griefing" is a real thing. I cringed so hard when Todd brought up the slap system and minimal consequences of camp destruction. Every single fallout title had serious character and plot options that were evil, antisocial, selfish, or shortsighted, often with huge rewards. Simply put, IT'S NOT A FALLOUT GAME IF YOU CAN'T BE AN ASSHOLE.
---
My philosophy on multiplayer games is as follows:
---
If another player is doing something that you do not like, there should be a natural counter to it in your "bag of tricks." If there isn't, that's a design failure. It's not the fault of the hostile player. He is trying to goof off and have fun, same as you are. of COURSE it's frustrating to die for someone else's amusement, but the game should have natural paths for channeling that frustration into purpose (defenses, loadouts, tactics, pre-emptive strike, whatever). This is a survival game, survival involves fear of death. Players should be a major component in that fear.
---
I'd say F76 is trying, but not there yet, in terms of balancing this concept into a game that's fun for both "raiders" and "townspeople." The separate PVP server is a good start, in my opinion, but PVP combat still needs a lot of work.
---
Damn the force of your logic is too mighty.
---
Well, makes sense I guess. 
---
Thanks for the guide!!
---
It just goes to show you don‚Äôt need to be a lvl 300 to dominate in the game.  In fact, as a 117 I‚Äôm less concerned about the single 250 player then I am 2-3 players say in the 60-80 range because it‚Äôs tough to defeat multiples no matter what your level or build is.  I once defended myself against a couple of 100s and felt good about it but this is a different type of accomplishment. Well done! 
---
&gt; That's why I want to talk to someone from Bethesda support here on Reddit.
---
....think about this one.
---
I wasn't talking about someone paint his PA in the garage with paints available everywhere but about paintjobs, i.e. faction-based.
---
This sounds amazing. Makes me want to play Fallout 4 again.
---
Great idea but as toxic as some of this community is it would never work.  
---
Too bad I don't PvP......I'd love to shoot one if these turds with my execu Gamma gun.
---
I love this idea ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüëç
---
They did say we would be able to do this before the game even released, was super sadface to see the terrible distance we were restricted to 
---
Very good idea, but my house is at full budget and I'm sorry to say this would be too expensive to do for me. I think I have to start a new character...
---
Yeah the 2 are definitely different.  
---
Cavalier should be something useless in your case
---
both are looking to pvp....the bounty hunter just seems more "righteous" in their intent because good/bad, but in the end you are still looking to kill another player for some sort of gain. The people poking you in an attempt to provoke pvp can go 2 ways though...they can either get you to bite once and go about their business...or they can camp you and follow you around the map until you server jump (these guys are dicks)
---
Lol...no...
---
It looks like you already have some suggestions. Another option is the Discord linked off the /r/fo76FilthyCasuals subreddit. Good luck. 
---
The only decent interior looking walls they give us (other than half white walls in the brick set) are the red ones. They remind me of when on those home remodeling tv shows they paint a wall some odd bright color that doesn't match the rest of the building. They call them accent walls.
---
Yeah.  In fact, in a SBQ battle last night, I was taking a *lot* more Rads than I usually do.  Not sure what was up with that.  At first I thought I had a disease (I didn't) or had stepped into the nuke zone itself (I hadn't).  Re-stocking RadAway became yesterday's mission as a result.
---
True to an extent, but it still shows the climate that some people worried enough of that happening and I just think that that's not great for the community. Having even a thought that u could be banned
---
I think this is a good idea, with so many people ‚Äúrole playing‚Äù as raiders their camps could actually reflect that instead of looking like a miniature version of Whitesprings. My recent neighbors house looked so elegant and proper it was a shock when their values didn‚Äôt reflect that.
---
Probably easier to gather players when your camp is right outside Whitespring. 
---
Whoever made the decision to not have a test server for this title should do QA for a year straight. Your fanbase fixed all your other games, why not let them take a crack at this one?
---
Yep. 1 piece doesn't do much alone
---
All robots can be made trivial with enforcer (they also self destruct of can't fight back):
---
  Gutsy, aim low and it's takes about one shot per weapon arm to completely disarm.  
---
  Assaultron, one leg hot will put her on the ground.  Pop her in the head once death starts charging and it disables it for good.  At that point we just ignore them and they tend to not respawn.
---
  Sentry bot, disable a couple legs, then shoot each arm to make him destruct.
---
Any large critter except gulped is 1-2 shots per leg to turn nasty fights into seal clubbing.  Darn handy at SBQ nuke sites.
---
Nope cheaters stay banned lol
---
Cool.  Like I said, if that's how he is, that's how he is.
---
I'd be curious to know if his damage does scale with player level too, like some have speculated.
---
Rocky VII: We got fucking bombed
---
That would be cool. I can't remember if it was a mod or if it was built in but in Fallout 4 if your fridge loses power the ice cold drinks would go back to regular drinks after 3 hours.
---
Levels don't matter when you have the right perks for ur build.
---
I could be lvl 70 with all the same perks and gear and pull off the same results.
---
Levels become a punishment as you progress into pvp. More caps on loss lol.
---
You're right, I totally thought it did, that is really dumb. Another over-value of melee vs ranged, so dumb. This game really bends over backwards to make melee not only viable in a world with guns and mini-nukes but even superior.
---
There is a reason modern militaries don't carry battle axes and hedge clippers for weapons. To work in the game, they should be high-risk high-reward like shotguns usually are in most games. The time-to-kill for ranged weapons is pretty bad in this game.
---
Most of the time that I've been attacked by a player while owning a workshop, the attacker wanted the caps and junk for the kill or the "fun" of fighting; not the workshop. The rewards of owning a workshop just aren't that great. 
---
I'm not sure why we need junk insurance. Just keep all of your junk in your stash, especially if you own a workshop. 
---
I hear you, but I think the biggest problem with the game is making it clearer to non-PVP players how the PVP system works. As long as you know the rules, it isn't that hard to avoid PVP. 
---
on that note,  i sure as F hope i never run against you in pvp, you'd likely wreck me lol... 
---
out of curiosity, can i ask what your perk/build on top of your bloodied rifle is? I'm not a bloodied build, but am curious how your points are spread
---
There's already *is* a woobie in the game.
---
Happens to me with my quad crossbow. I head shot a super mutant 3x real fast and his health goes to a sliver and next thing you know he's full health again and my stealth is blown.
---
no thanks
---
Bounty hunters initiate PvP against people who have either killed others directly or harassed others by breaking parts of a base. Both players are looking for PvP. 
---
A group of people having one person poke you to bait you while the others wait nearby to nuke you when you engage him are *actively* looking for PvP and will try to provoke literally anyone, even non-PvP players.
---
Be honest...you didnt just take something from another player...The ban is for have excessive legendary equipment/items. 
---
Grafton station has them.
---
New Weapons? Sure... but First lets fix some of the Crap Weapons that shoudln't be Crap to where they are viable. And I would also recommend that the effectiveness of different damage types against types of enemies be increased a little more to make it harder to be effective if your just going to use one weapon to keep it challenging.  
---
And please fix the Legendary Gear...  Way too many Crap drops that are completely unusable for the level they are, either drop fewer but make them something viable, or better yet keep the crap drops but allow people to scrap them and collect points for whatever the perk on the weapon was and allow users to collect 5 or 10 or a number of points for that attribute and be able to craft it onto a piece of armor or weapon, similar to what Diablo used to do with Gems.  The current gear legendary slots could be used with the same rules but allow folks to build the gear they want if they put enough effort into it... Throw a few new weapons into the mix over time to give people new options to play with to keep it interesting in the long term.
---
I would add that I made a few alterations to my setup last night and it's a bit better now against multiple Gutsys.  Insisting that I not be teamed up so I could have Lone Wanderer, Field Surgeon and Born Survivor did help.  Born Survivor resets more quickly than Auto-Stim armor does, so that allowed me to replace that piece with something stronger.
---
I do question if maybe there's a specific armor mod that helps against them, like Dense does against Scorchbeasts.
---
When you kill it it should explode in confetti. 
---
Haha that is true; they tried to Anor Londo you ü§£
---
Your reaction is actually the reaction we got most of the time. People loved the creativity we put forth, and the PVP was always exciting and forthright. We played on PS4 but we haven't played for a long while.
---
Our strongest player, a natural Lvl 400 something melee build (played nonstop since the beta) grew tired of never getting loot from the queen. Once she landed he'd have her dead in about 4-6 hits, but he rarely got loot from her. Another player left cause he only played games with that guy.
---
I left cause the XP nerfs ruined my end game. If I'd already done all the other stuff. Launched the nukes, killed the queen. At that point I became the type who likes to test builds, but I really hate grinding.
---
I still get on from time to time just to test if the patches will encourage me to play more, and to check out my party base.
---
i am honest really! i took boguth off some weapons and got 250‚Äò000 halloween candy i couldn‚Äòt use because of the weight limit so dropped them. i got banned for having those candy doesn‚Äòt matter how i got them thats what i got said in the e mail
---
Im not sure, i think my glitch was differs from yours, all i know is it fixed it self after the xbox had been shut off for a while, sorry i cant help anymore, good luck
---
HP gains cap at level 50.
---
Endurance USED TO give bonuses to health on level up in older games, not sure on 76.
---
You can keep getting perk cards past level 50, so that's the main advantage.
---
As for the Prestige feature, nobody really knows yet.
---
I'm surprised that there aren't raiders waiting at train stations to ambush players on their way to deposit junk that they've spent an hour collecting. I hadn't taken the workshop yet, otherwise I would've had what I wanted, since as soon as you take it you unlock a bunch of plans.
---
Its unlikely. The vending machine will probably be an extension of your stash with items that you have marked for sale, similar to when you mark it as a favorite item. The difference is that you can leave the vending machine open and operational at your camp while you wander the wilderness. 
---
Really just to perfect youre build
---
I get to the end of the game and start a new character, personally.
---
You died?
---
Never had floating ghouls and meat piles. They have always been on the ground.
---
Because Workshops supersede Pacifist mode.
---
I will give u my build
---
Perks that matter for the builds dps:
---
Perception: Maxed rifleman perks + maxed tank killer
---
Agility: Covert operative maxed, sneak lv1, escape artist lv1
---
Luck: starched genes maxed, class freak maxed, better criticals maxed, bloody mess maxed.
---
Endurance: maxed iron clad, maxed fireproof
---
The rest of the perks are your choice. I got the weight reduction effects on strength and sometines run demolition maxed when I use explosive weapons.
---
Mutations: speed demon, marsupial, healing factor, adrenal, eagle eye, scaly skin
---
For armor, I mainly depend on a chameleon armor piece.
---
Weapons: bloodied hunting rifle/lever action/gauss can all 1 shot. Criticals help get passed damage reduction like sent. Assassin.
---
Oh i keep my health at 30%.
---
From what was said, I think your right.
---
You mark items in your stash for sale, and set a price.
---
Beyond that, I don't know.
---
Yes, the real answer would be *balancing*. But real balancing is very difficult. On the other side nerfing things is very easy. Take the TSE. Instead of adjusting other weapons to compete with TSE, they simply nerved both things (TS and E) individually. It takes less time, less effort and the outcome somehow justifies their action. 
---
When balancing any aspect of the game (like weapon damage) you have to take much more things into account. At first you have to localize the root of the problem. Is the base damage too low? Should the fire rate be increased? What perks are affecting this weapon? What armour or resistances absorb damage? What about reload speed and clip size for sustained DPS?
---
Afterwards you can adjust one thing and test it. If it is a minor change for one weapon the outcome is rather easy to detect. If the change influences other weapons (like changing perk modifiers) or enemies (adjusting resistances) you would have to test all other weapons and enemies affected by it too. And keep in mind that every weapon can have legendary effects, so much more testing would be required.
---
For multiplayer games you also want to have a decent distribution of different builds. Imagine a game with only melee characters, because it is the 'best' build. All other (developed and implemented) playstyles would vanish, because they are not competitive (in an always-PVP game). So you nerf the best build to force players to move to (or at least try) other things. Buffing other builds will rarely shift players, because who likes to read (and understand) \[cryptic\] patch notes?!
---
The gamma gun radiation doesnt pierce through armor. For the limb one, I dunno 
---
There are a lot of places that person could be, and they aren't as likely to care if you go after their workshop. A person that has only one workshop, and is actively using it, is most likely going to show up to defend it if they aren't already there.
---
yeah okay thats the point i did not cheat.. but i‚Äòm not saying i didn‚Äòt knew what i was doing
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like Bethesda had enough time to work on the game, or they just really didn‚Äôt think things through.
---
Your E-pein continues to grow and you can't flaunt/intimidate others Whit smaller E-peins.
---
Sweet, thanks i have a lot of that already so just need to make some adjustments
---
Exactly!!! Like I want more stuff in the c.a.m.p because I like to role play but I just need more to make me in the mood because my camp is like baring and boring and I just want more passion in my camp but I do not have the tools to do so you know
---
i think the perk cards say something like, "...when you use 'search'"
---
Fallout Canada
---
You can mix it up with other walls too.
---
I like using Wooden Shutters and Barn Windows: Red interior and shutters.
---
What about mods?
---
Just give us more window options in general. Nice, unbroken windows. Shutters. Etc. 
---
yes sorry, should have updated the list, my bad
---
There are such things as no lifers or people with disabilities or people who don‚Äôt work. There are much more people that have 10 hours in a day to game than you would realize. Insomniacs, dedicated gamers, etc.
---
I reposted this from another person who asked,
---
If it allowed you to move, but drained AP to do so, would that be a good solution?
---
He claimed he was on disability due to an accident or something. So its quite possible
---
By this logic they should only be naked melee attackers.  Armoring the host increases their survivability the same as weapons do.   In fact, that they use weapons implies multiple goals and strategies are in effect here to begin with.  
---
\-15 Karma doesn't mean 15 trades were bad, it means *more than 15* were bad to drag him to 0 and then under that. 
---
Terrible people do terrible things.
---
Really worth it. The one shot becomes an addiction that you must feed at the price of unfortunate souls.
---
They are killing you because there are practically no risks for them you can counter at that level. You are likely worth for the junk as many fresh players are not experienced enough to stash their junk that early.
---
When the levels are reversed, such as I, with lvl 250+, have been challenged by lvl 60-100 players wielding knifes to explosive shotguns. Why? Because they are confident their build can kill me in PvP and get 250+ caps after my level while at best, I may get 60-100 caps and no junk.
---
Store your junk and ignore them, also ignore workshops and play pacifist.
---
Thats actually not a bad idea. Give the players a server of their own so they can mod it. Then take the good mods (with permission) and put them in the main game. It would be like having free workers. 
---
Thanks for the Confirmation!... and Dang :-( ... that has been my go to Crowd Pleaser for quite a while.  Out of curiosity did you try changing your build on the Tesla? and if it was legendary what perks did it have?
---
The one I've been using is a LVL 50 Quad Capacity with no other perks, and I modded it with an Automatic Barrel and Reflex Sight.  
---
I fully support destroying a CAMP you don‚Äôt like.  But to restrict the placement of camps in a specific area because it inconveniences you is ridiculous.
---
very funny.
---
\+ Order of Mysteries PA paint :)
---
**FOR THE EMPEROR!!!**
---
Ouch. Im pretty sure he has a crack on his head and he always bold.
---
Natural dick head confirmed lol
---
Normally it's the antagonistic posts that don't add anything that go deep negative karma in this sub.
---
Sorry, I didn't realize  you would see more by using the Inspect option. It lists the following:
---
\-8% damage from Players
---
Increases Action Point refresh Speed
---
Ammo Weight reduced by 20%
---
It's pointless unless you're looking to make things more difficult for yourself, I guess.  That would be consistent with mutations like Empath.
---
Like you say though, I don't see the point of the Chameleon mutation otherwise.  It is inferior, in every way, to the armor prefix when it should be at least equivalent.  I'm a bit sympathetic to anyone who takes it, thinking "Oh, cool, now I can just go invisible without spending an armor slot on it."
---
same... Im here to play fallout, not PVP. 
---
I gave up on gaming several years back mainly cause of kids, but it was easy to walk away getting fed up with PVP asshats.
---
I bought an Xbox one mostly cause I love fallout. now I want to smash it. not to sound like a grumpy old man, but a lot of the new games are online and lacking any interesting plot. I cant even find a decent game to play co-op with my wife.

I don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúraider‚Äù behavior is a bad thing in a post apocalyptic survival setting. Allowing players the choice to band together for good or evil is a great idea as far as realism is concerned. I can see the value of having a karma system or faction badge to help distinguish hostile players from friendlies especially when you‚Äôre a low level player. I just would like some kind of bounty system that stays with you think karma n faction. You do ‚Äúbad‚Äù things (level a camp, kill 20 players, steal every workshop, etc) you get negative karma. Max your karma bar you get level 1 raider or enclave Max level 10. Do ‚Äúgood‚Äù deeds (revive random players, help defend workshops, possibly supply low level players, etc) you gain positive karma. (Note: it shouldn‚Äôt be too easy like RDR2 where you can just release fish or just say howdy a thousand times). The bounty should last for like an hour at 25 caps. Anyone who kills that player during the hour gets 25 caps from the player with the bounty. Anyone who losses to the bounty player losses 25 caps. The more ‚Äúbad‚Äù the player with the bounty does the higher the caps increase n the longer the bounty stays. What the wasteland needs is an infamous Raider Bosses who stands out against all comers. The boss doesn‚Äôt hide faceless amongst their minions, they proudly stand up against the world n say here I am take your best shot, punk! 
---
TL:DR 
---
Karma n factions would be helpful to identify raiders. Bounties should last a set amount of time n should pay out multiple times over the set amount of time. 
---
If your in the silo it's instant kill when it launches. 
---
The guy was off work from a broken shoulder blade. It usually takes something pretty serious to break a shoulder blade, like a car crash. It sounds like there wasn't much else he could do all day other than play games or watch TV. I am also guessing he probably had a pretty hard time sleeping. 
---
I used to have my camp there and it got caught in a couple of nuke zones so I had to shift it.
---
The Warehouse set is pretty good for partitions too.
---
Wait, what's up with the Nurses uniforms? I have almost all of them right now, can I retire then? 
---
One step further ... it'd be nifty if the legendary vendor allowed you to turn in \* to get various legendary mods that you can apply to existing items in general. 
---
And then drop legendary PA and other direct mods in some loot. Instead of random legendary weapons, I'd love to see less frequent but legendary mods so you can build your perfect armor / weapons. 
---
No they don't. Limbs are legs and arms. 
---
If you got the black diamond already the rest ain't worth it. and if you didn't start it at level 50 ya lost homie.
---
yeah, i guess having every level of every perk would allow you to swap out every possible build...
---
Yes for real!!!
---
Welch is it tis
---
I did that too, only because I wanted a better build and it would have been more work to respec by levelling. End game pvp is a part of the game. I feel there is enough in there to discourage extreme cases of grief but there will always be a few people. Other similar games like rust are a million times worse.
---
Some half/quarter floors to match the dark wood laminate ones would be great, too.
---
"Thinking 900 hours of the 900 hours played guy."
---
\*Green Bastard Parts Unknown\* intensifies. 
---
Don‚Äôt take my word for it because I have no idea how reliable it is, but somebody in a discord server I‚Äôm in datamined some things and said that he found a bunch of new shop items, including wallpapers. 
---
For sure. I got him to half Health with a .50 cal ball shot from sneak, but couldn‚Äôt reload in time. So I switched to the mini gun for my first time ever using one
---
Yess for real we need factions and clans!!!
---
Surely you have had something like this though? This isn't supposed to happen: http://imgur.com/a/zqxpCZL
---
This so much. I hate using the picket fence indoors, it only works with the wood set in most cases imo.
---
I guess I will go and see myself.
---
You will need to buy larger pants from the Atom store to accommodate your huge ever growing e-peen, your carry weight will suffer from it dragging you down.
---
At least I managed to find a shotgun that can blow away ghouls and robots in one shot.
---
That is the one I am talking about.
---
If you've got the connect for 25k top tier loadouts, please, let me know. 
---
Just play and wait for the summer update:
---
&gt;**New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Then you will get your free reset and also some special abilities. In the meantime you can experiment, try out other things and get towards your final build.
---
I think all of us, as a general rule, hate radscorpions of any type. They are just awful.
---
I know that.
---
how is a PA melee tank not the meta?  I never said you couldn't play a different build, but no other build is as effective as a PA melee tank, period.  the balance in this game is broken on so many levels, rifles don't even get a weight reduction perk
---
Are you om PC? I'm interested in the twisted muscles one. 
---
There is that upcoming "Nuclear Winter" mode we don't know much about.  Probably drastic to assume it makes the world snowy, but you never know.
---
Praise Mothman!!!
---
 Math never lies, the math reveals the lie. 
---
I sometimes get that too... especially playing in 3rd person.  My impression is that with ranged weapons they have a radius distance set for where you can do bash damage, inside it = Bash Only, Outside it = Ranged Only which makes sense.  I haven't verified this, but it's likely what is happening, It might also be interesting to see if using a pistol and hip firing would allow you to use it at melee distance since in the real world that is a possibility.
---
Yes. Looking forward to more information.
---
I'd much rather have a GOD DAMN FRONT SIGHT. 
---
It's The Army Fatigue.
---
That actually would be really cool.  You could have Radstorms radiate outward from wherever the nuke landed.
---
At the end of the day people drop bags for players all the time. Saying to me if you drop or pick up a brown bag you are a cheater is a dangerous can of worms to open 
---
The truth is, the game was rigged from the sta-
---
Hey where'd my teammates go?
---
I saw a newbie with a witch hat, they didn't understand trade or see my brown bag,, they Fast travelled to their base across the map so i followed them and put mic on to explain i was trying to give them a free Witch Costume to go with the hat and that the Witch Costume is a rare find :) 
---
Best fast travel path for the least amount of caps is vault 76 to Morgantown station, Sutton station, whitespring, whitespring bunker, watoga station, watoga vendor, then harpers ferry. Could be cheaper depending on where your camp is 
---
Friend and I are lower level and we had a bitch of a fight killing a mothman. He disappeared immediately upon dying. No loot. All that wasted ammo and those wasted stimpacks...
---
Who said that?
---
If you say so.
---
I'll never understand why people spend so much of their time worrying about how others spend their time.
---
So I have a cliff-side base near Top of the World, and the only real *threat* is when my crops get harassed by the daily mole rat, and that's about it. 
---
Having said that, there are super mutants who gather at the top edge of the cliff and try to shoot down at my base. They can't hit it because of the angle, but they are really annoying because they lock down my fast travel.
---
In order to get at them I have to run this really far looping route up to the cliff-top and kill them. 
---
I have noticed that I can chuck a grenade up there, so I figured if I had some artie I would just use that.
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4, so I'll have to earn it the old fashioned way.
---
Sorry for your buddy, if it makes him feel any better, I dumped 1000s of 5.56 into the queen. Not 5-6 hits and I get pure trash. Not kidding, I pulled a 1* yesterday. Felt so bad repairing my guns and crafting ammo for a 1* legendary, which I could have got from a ghoul at white spring with 1 bullet lol
---
The update is gonna be lit buddy! Check the road map if you haven't seen it yet.
---
Judging from the distance to the train station, you might be able to pull Mole Miners from Blackwater Mine and box them in the ring :D
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a mod for FO4. It was called like ‚Äúpowered fridge‚Äù or something like that. 
---
Raiders don't wait at train stations (that's boring), but they will show up pretty quick if a wanted player appears to be alone at a station. I've been the student and teacher in that lesson. 
---
Well, it's much easier to use mods in GTA Online due to the fact that it's a P2P game, Fallout 76 has dedicated servers though, so it will be much harder to do that. 
---
We were all spoiled my the variety of awesome stuff in Fallout 4, all the amazing texture mods. Fallout 76 C.A.M.P items are very much Whitespring style, we need some grunge and bloody stuff. I keep my base simple so as not to jar too much with the post apocalypse world.
---
This is awesome! I'm one of the devs that did this for the tourism office. We got a copy of the game map to do this with before it went public. Bethesda also sent a vault boy costume to use at last years Bridge Day.  
---
It felt really cool to work with Bethesda by proxy.
---
What's a no lifer?
---
Fuck the half-walls, I want my doors to stop floating away from brick walls. 
---
You mean the Stairway to Heaven? 
---
Interesting... So this apparently isn't just limited to a specific rifle. I'm currently running a primarily Automatic Rifle build and using both a TS Handmade, a TSE Handmade and a Quad Capacity Automatic Rifle  without any issues with them or glitching. 
---
That is his literally arguement of innocence, that he played SOOOOO much that he reached levels of items not deemed achieveable in the timeframe. I am not sure I personally believe him but I have seen math that suggests it is possible.  
---
Lol nuke zone bareknuckle boxing would be üíØ
---
I just tamed a Snallygaster today and I can confirm you only need a rank 3 Animal Friend to tame one. 
---
Pretty much. Go over and check the Market. Certain color uniforms can range anywhere from 2k to 15k or 20k each
---
Great story!
---
I am curious about some of the terms you use.. bloodied build, sentinel build, etc.
---
Is there a good guide somewhere that breaks down the main popular builds?
---
I would love to hear about your specific build.. sounds intriguing.
---
I am a sniper build as well.. But I have not found VATS worthwhile (have 3 points in it)... I have a nice \*\*\* level 40 pipe rifle that does double damage on full health enemies, and a lever rifle that ignores 50% of armor? I believe...
---
My armor is a mix of \*\*\* that is a hodgepodge of benefits.. I prefer not to wear power armor but weight is always an issue forcing me to put it on.
---
I always store my junk because the game has very limited carry weight. I needed the plans which can only be unlocked by taking a workshop. I do play in pacifist. I'm not a fresh player. This is my 6th character. I'm fed up of people ruining my fun.
---
Can we also have the wall used in the garage door not only look like it a part of the warehouse set?
---
Man I love that all these suggestions are shared with the devs.
---
Props to u/LoneVaultWanderer for sharing these at least!
---
How many **MONTHS** are we from release and this simple QOL feature still isn't in game? What are they doing over there at Bethesda Austin?
---
I hadn't taken the workshop yet. I needed to take it to get the plans unlocked, after that I had no further interest in it.
---
Well back in FO4 looked like the intercept base used a gigantic railgun.
---
The Way of the wolf build lol
---
Most Raiders end up with a bullet in their head, though.
---
The fundamental flaw to equating griefers to Raiders is that griefers have no interest in a fight they might lose.  They'll jump servers, find someone to remove their bounty, etc.  It's essentially a Raider in Fallout 4 that could teleport out of the game rather than give you the reward for killing them.
---
Now, if you behave like a Raider *and* you are willing to die when it's your time, that's fine by me.  But I think that personality type is rare, because the people who get off on destroying the work of others *really hate it* when they get destroyed themselves.
---
He said he was out of commission due to an injury.  If I didn't have to work and didn't have family/household responsibilities, like if  my crypto just  went to the moon overnight and I could hire a cleaning lady, I would litterally play all day.  I already play about 3 hrs a night on average 4 nights a week an I'm a 40 your old parent of 3 who runs my own contractor business.  I find time for my Fallout!
---
I wonder if the guy was crafting ammo to sell for a side business for an additional source of income.  The use of a mule character doesn't imply any wrong-doing but makes you wonder if Bethesda saw something that we don't, like any duping going on.
---
Yeah, see that guy was asking you a question (is there any other place to turn in Technical data?) And you didn't answer the question he asked, I'm pretty sure you just misunderstood him. So I answered his question. 
---
There definitely needs to be an item trading interface but listing the items for zero caps and hoping you don't get ripped off isn't the only way. Just agree to list both items for a higher amount of caps than it's actually worth. Assuming both players go through with the trade it's a net zero effect on your caps but if one player doesn't complete their part at least you've made a few thousand caps.
---
Again, I know it's not perfect but it's better than what people are apparently doing right now.
---
xxxcloroxxx :) you missed an 'x' of the end of your name.
---
Yeah and if they gave the guy a script for something good, I could see minutes turning to hours in fallout land.
---
Which makes you wonder why the "Repair All" function exists at all, because it is fundamentally misleading.
---
That‚Äôs a work around and doesn‚Äôt really fix the problem that I have things I wouldn‚Äôt trade for caps at all
---
Ps4
---
&gt;People keep making comments and posts about how they got into a fight with a level 250+ character like it's a gauge of their character's power.
---
Because those people are inexperienced, their perception of how the game works is incorrect. Unfortunately they are quite vocal and don't like being shown how they're wrong. 
---
I dunno, plenty of experienced people say the same kinda stuff. 
---
I‚Äôve run into a few griefers. They are usually little feral children who weren‚Äôt socialized properly by their lazy parents. Thankfully I‚Äôm so well hidden now that I haven‚Äôt had anyone find my camp in 2 months. 
---
Ahaha "No Chems, No Weapons, No Crying." I love this and I wish I was there to join in!
---
You hit the nail on the head with this one, OP. I try to make this point myself, but it‚Äôs always met with ‚ÄúbUt aLL THe RaIDerS In thIs aRE deAd AnD tHe onES IN The otHEr gAmEs dIdNt chOoSe to bE RaIDerS‚Äù, which really erks me. If you‚Äôre looking at it from the viewpoint that Fallout and all of the NPCs are real then, yes, they did choose to be raiders. Sucks that your house got broke, but I vividly remember defending Goodsprings and Starlight Drive-In in the past. 
---
I've scrapped things I favorites many times. I often have nonlegendary versions of the Syringer or a pistol or a shovel favorited, and then done a speed scrap and lost one or two of those items, especially the shovel. 
---
This is such a fun idea!
---
It really does beg the question: How does player trading work in the minds of the Bethesda devs? On paper, in theory, at Bethesda, how do they see player trading being carried out?
---
I would love to have an answer to this. I would love to know if they truly believe trading as it is now is fine and it's us the players who have the wrong idea.
---
OR if the devs know it's problematic but chose to allow the game to ship in this state because there were more important things to deal with. If this is the case then it would be a nice PR gesture for a statement to be made acknowledging that player trading is currently unfinished and incomplete and that it **will** be overhauled and improved at some point in the future. 
---
I spent two days walking around with a 100+ cap bounty last week. A few people tried me, but for the most part I walked around in utter peace. It's actually pretty hilarious how reluctant most players are to go for a bounty. I eventually had one of my friends clear it.
---
People think you're bounty baiting, and in my case... I am. Though I don't often go out looking to get a big bounty, if I get one you better believe I'm in full assassin sentinel gear jacked up on chems... but every once in a while I run into a bigger fish.
---
I put over 100 hours into it and have only seen one rad storm and maybe 3 or 4 thunderstorms in total. I kind of miss the panic I would get early on in FO4 where I was rushing to get indoors.
---
According to the web, one would need to reach \~lvl 543 to max out all perks.
---
Is this beneficial? possibly. I believe the perks system along with mutations is fairly complex, and playing around with every possible build could give high lvl. players a significant advantage.
---
I mentioned that on our stream last week, I noticed it about a week into playing for the first time.
---
I agree with you mate,  people grossly misuse the term ' griefer ' on here. 4vs1 isn't griefing. 4 ppl killing you over and over,  harassing your game play non stop , repeatedly destroying your camp , or using exploits to kill or gain unfair advantage are griefers . 
---
I think the word had been co opted by the more sensitive players to mean any time anyone engages in unwanted pvp to be 'griefing' 
---
The spotlight is buggy nevertheless. I don't think it's your terminal. Not a well-known big since some people don't use it.
---
Some magazines tell the bonus near the stats of the item( weight, price)
---
this is a game as a service, it's not like they haven't been adding CAMP item weekly
---
oh crap the institute just moved into appalachia...
---
I didn't think about that. You're right.
---
The player vending update might add a player hub , we don‚Äôt know yet tho.
---
It seems entirely half baked to say the least. I can't imagine they were just being naive assuming players would trade honestly and that reddit/discord forums were going to be the only avenue to get player trading done
---
You're fighting the good fight. I like to give anyone who is wanted around the clubhouse the benefit of the doubt and make it a point not to loot them after putting them out of their misery.
---
Rust has also had a bit more time to sort itself out. It is hard to say what fallout 76 if given the same time .I doubt rust has been updated constantly for the past 5 but defiantly longer than 3 months.
---
Looking at fallouts road map, it could very well be a completely different game by the time the Wastelanders DLC hits.
---
This is one of those things I can see myself trying to explain to the wife *blank stare 
---
Shut up!
---
You posted pretty much the same thing 4hrs ago

---
The 10mm smg doesn't have sights? I've been wasting my time scrapping other smgs hoping to get a sight mod? Really?
---
That's a smart move - enable Quest Item tag. Already built into the system, just needs a UI button and a second tag for "Game-enabled" vs "Player-enabled".
---
Nailed it. You are the sheriff here. Like a scholar!
---
Yeah I know they have I‚Äôm just wanted to know if there going to be adding more but like Iam meaning plan not the atomic shop and wishing not to spend 20 to get that you know so more plans pls
---
yeah ive noticed it do that when scrapping weapons, i have to be very sure to slow down or else i might scrap my handmade...
---
&gt; Nowadays, the Queen fight always seems so helpless 
---
it's because no one uses chems or endangerol
---
Can we get a picture? 
---
Yes. They should rotate the radio music every time they change the time shop.
---
i agree, i really enjoy it when it gets foggy, rainy, rad storms
---
adds to the immersion and gloom of the apocoalypse
---
Used be be nukes going off regularly, something is dying.
---
This is quite an elegant solution. Hilarious and elegant, quite fitting of the fallout world.
---
God this would be amazing!! 
---
I think the biggest problem is that each and every single player can, and sometimes does, have a different definition for: raiding, pvp, and griefing.
---
Some people think that any and all non-consensual pvp is griefing. Bethesda says(and personally I agree) that pvp is a core feature of the game and so not all pvp is griefing.
---
So yeah the question is where is the line between intended pvp activities(even if they are unwanted by some players) and griefing. 
---
YES!!!!! i was just thinking this, it really makes the CAMP look crappy with the broken windows
---
maybe just make another version with no broken windows, so the people who DO like the broken windows can still have that option
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good idea 
---
Changes do need to be made; not being able to trade or gift just caps is absurd.  In the meantime I‚Äôve done all my trading in r/market76, and haven‚Äôt had any issues with grift.  
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky.
---
This Glitch still exists, I dropped some junk for a friend yesterday, and several treasure maps dropped as well.
---
He asked me why I was giving away my maps, and I was like "What Maps"!
---
Dude, great story. Felt like I was there.  I had a similar situation, but I fast traveled the fuk outta there.  One high level wanted "leader" of griefers standing on a rooftop at the golf resort with his goons surrounding him taunting me and firing shots at me laughing and shit.  I dipped.  What's up with these dudes?  I'm only lvl 39.  What joy do you get out of this?  These are the types of dudes that will form up in real life if there was an apocalypse.  Fuk em all!
---
Also praise Mothman
---
Wendigos are terrifying, but as someone who has a irrational fear of crabs, lobsters, scorpions, hermit crabs, and generally anything with "pinchers" and claws- some of the more the classic enemies get me.
---
Can you image walking along minding your own business when a freaking LIFE SIZED SCORPION comes charging at you?? Can you imagine getting stabbed with that stinger?? Or swimming in a lake and feeling the water moving under you to realize a super sized crab is under neath you?? Not just the size but that fact that they are instantly aggressive too. I lived in Texas for a year and the fear of finding a scorpion in your bed sheets or shoes was sooo real but you also know they're more afraid of you than you are of them- not in Fallout universe though. They're out for BLOOD.
---
You guys are silly
---
No one is "griefing" in this post...
---
I tell my wife I like pvp.
---
She asks me what is pvp.
---
I tell her players killing other players.
---
She then pauses, and firmly asks me: Are you sure you don't need therapy?
---
Rip gaming industry...
---
More than likely, given that there is an internal discussion about it, it was an oversight and players are taking advantage.
---
We should unban all those mules since all they did was pick up 10 million pounds of tses. I mean, they didn't dupe and those tses are totally legit
---
especially given that it doesn't actually... you know... repair all. More like "replace" all. I still have to repair damaged(but not destroyed) walls, turrets, etc manually.
---
AND ALSO CAN YOU IMAGINE SEEING A MOSQUITO THAT BIG IN REAL LIFE.
---
That's what gets me to most is I just imagine seeing these enemies in real life. 
---
the game can barely handle a pack of glowing ghouls and 5 players in the same cell, and you want more frequent rad storms? lol 
---
Yeah I do too, they are amazing
---
Cats become lions when grouped up.
---
Deep down inside, they still are kittens lol.
---
I thought I was being smart and ran into a building once to hide from a Wendigo, turned around and closed the door behind me while I looked for healing items.
---
The bastard opened the door. I screamed ahaha
---
What about the other player‚Äôs fun?
---
I'll give you 25k caps and a troubleshooter sentinel wooden leg for that there potato gun.
---
That's some wasteland justice right there. Excellent tale. 
---
I got suckered into one of these once. Soon as the wanted player started spraying me with automatic explosive rounds I figured something was up. Next thing I knew I had another player cutting me down with just a couple swings with a deathclaw gauntlet. Bailed out after that. 
---
&gt; vastly overpowered weapons to kill a player over and over again
---
You call that griefing, but look at it from the attackers perspective: Easy caps. If I can kill you continously, easily, with little risk to myself, I'm getting a steady stream of caps off you.
---
My intent isn't to frustrate you, or make you quit, it's an incredible source of caps that doesn't involve me server hopping, being over-encumbered by bulked junk, or fast traveling all over the place.
---
It seems the overseer‚Äôs camp functions as a makeshift hub at times.  Passing on known plans and lower level gear to to the newer peeps.
---
Oooo what about the Centaur if we're talking FO3? The first time I saw there was truly a "What the actual FFffff" moment
---
For real! I think they just don't care. Fuck me though because they already have my money.
---
And the little pitter patter of the footsteps.  
---
WHERE ARE YOU. I HEAR YOU. \*panic\*
---
Great story! But those dudes weren‚Äôt griefers. They set a trap and tried to kill you, part of the game. 
---
one of the many times this topic came up I suggested flatwoods because it can't be nuked by trolls. 
---
others suggested whitesprings because the golf course is wide and flat..er, and it is also where you go for nukes and such so more people will be passing through more often. and the resort has many crafting tables and stash boxes and vendors (even if they share the same cap pool)
---
But in the end, we cant really clump together because the camp limits are to large. 
---
Glory to the Empire

I know it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre asking for but just as a PSA in case you or others do not know. After you pick the magazine up you can inspect it and it will tell you what buff it will grant.

Griefing/raiding is just a part of the game. Thats what fallout is about, play the game like u want.  Do you wanna be nice then be nice, do you wanna be a dick and be hated. Then be a dick
---
I wanted to bail to, ain't no one got time for that...

But then that dude said run forest run... I was like dude... I'm going to make this guy meet buhbuh in heaven!
---
It's a bug from fallout 4. They work till you walk away and come back. Then you have to go to build mode and move them an inch to get then to work again
---
Can you put things on the shelves to spell words?
---
Debatable, but yeah. Its all pvp in the end.
---
Working as intended.
---
It‚Äôs what happens when pve people get forced into pvp. They don‚Äôt understand the technicalities ü§ó
---
I really appreciate all the feedback in here guys! I don't have any immediate answers for the concerns you raised, but I will pass along all these different ideas in here to the Dev's. Reminder too we have player vending coming, I just can't give many details on that until we're a bit closer to its launch.
---
Np. Honestly screws are in a bunch of things. Make sure you have toggled on the search function for anything you are low on. In the crafting menu once you are looking at making something and you're out of a part, there should be a button to press to toggle on search for that part.
---
I've suggested the same, many times, Vendor trading in previous FO versions had this.
---
I doubt we'll get weapons that weren't in 4, but I'd love to see the deliverer model 10mm pistol added 
---
LOL so childish .. as usual nothing of value added. Enjoy that bag of chips 
---
Why are we still talking about this?
---
Bethesda, I guess what they're saying is we want variety options on the builds.  I personally prefer a clean, new look on anything I build, and stay away from the warehouse build because I hate the broken look. I only use the brick set and the metal building set because you can construct something that looks it has good upkeep.  I also want my clean cooking stove, for the love of god.
---
Oh, I figured it would just stack so no matter what the enemy will always have some armor left. Ok thanks
---
I commented below but just in case you don‚Äôt see that. If you inspect the magazine after you pick it up it will tell you what buff it gives. Usually below the name at the top of the screen but always somewhere on the inspect screen.
---
&gt; One thing I found (and this doesn't work all the time) is that I think they fall one layer below where you can see them (clipped into the ether?) and a well-placed grenade will blow them back into reality 
---
Yeah, like I'm going to be tossing grenades around at whitesprings while surrounded by sentrybots.
---
Yeah, from the Holotapes it sounds like they were experimenting on weather control.  I anticipate a weather control quest in the future.

---
There was a mod for PC that locked weapon, out few days after the first release, it's not maintained anymore, but this was litterally working by adding \*3 lines\* of action script code in the UI file.
---
\*3 lines\*.
---
Just sayin'
---
That's all absolutely well and true.  Enforcer is a beastly perk.
---
But with Mr. Gutsy, you're going to end up chugging Stimpacks, no matter how cleanly or efficiently you try to play it.  Most robots, as you point out, have a procedure.  While Colonel Gutsy has one too, it's of little comfort when he takes out a decent chunk of HP just looking at him.
---
Also, of all the robots, he's by far the worst when he goes into self-destruct mode because he'll just glide wherever he wants.  Hopefully you crippled the thruster, or else he's going to follow you halfway around the silo. üòÇ
---
Ran the "gauntlet" at ws this morning a non nuked area ...all glowing ghouls most legendary! After 1 pass ( clearing the club, running up along all the housing area and back down again to the club.) So many legendary items 50% crap legendary but still alot of good items too. I had to drop 2 cryolators and a LMG overweight. Hopefully its still like this tonight!
---
Shame I was hoping to use it to manage camp security like turrets 
---
Lol get over it 
---
The last few times her loot has been awful. The last one I did, I received a standard metal armor leg. To me, that is ridiculous for beating the game end boss 
---
Plenty of "experienced" people seem to think that passive mode works both ways as well. Personally I'd argue that people who are this wrong about game mechanics are not experienced regardless of how many hours they have logged.
---
IMO, I would feel things were a bit misprioritized if player vending was instituted before player trading was really even fixed. I'm excited for player vending, but I feel like this issue has been left hanging for far too long
---
Worked for me.and my friend. After the suppression stage wears off it will show only the negative in effects on pip boy but weapon damage will show that its working. I know 4 or 5 people who have fixed it this way. 
---
Its working for me...I acquired it after the latest patch.
---
If the owner of the camp is there and actively using it, I don't mind as much (though I still think it's annoying). The bigger issue for me is when the player is half way across the map while their camp is left alone interrupting my and others' whitespring runs.
---
If someone wants to server hop whitesprings with their camp, okay fine. If they want to store their turrets while they head out over the map to do other things, okay fine. But if they leave that shit there for hours, nah I'm gonna level it.
---
All the Fallout music is on Spotify BTW.
---
When I was running toward my friend, I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, and got jumpscared by a moth man.
---
They aren't everywhere, and like I said... You can always wait for a meat pile.
---
This.
---
I lost my wedding ring. Feels bad, man.
---
2 things: No video? Ugh. Also, you did an edit for upvote count? Lamest thing I'll see today and I just woke up.
---
Yes, it's working.  The display is incorrect but the weapon effects are active.
---
I cleared all my mutations twice and reaquired and it still bugged out twice. I would wait for fix.
---
If I remember right, the corresponding building components in Fallout 4 even came in both forms.
---
u shut ur mouth 
---
I like feedback! Positive or negative. All good to me. 
---
gaining 100,000 of a rare item got you suspended. there is no evidence that the "I dropped it and picked it up over and over again" is anymore valid than "your account got flagged and bethesda checked the inventory"
---
I will point you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as7w92/i_got_banned_info_threadmegathread/)
---
Every time I see that f&amp;\*ker I shoot him.  and say Congratulations!  
---
Ah... but would the ‚Äútwo shot‚Äù fire one and a quarter teddy‚Äôs lol, would be cool though and I‚Äôd love to see the junk jet return, even if we couldn‚Äôt load our own junk and we just collected junk jet ammo from ammo containers and had an animation when firing of random varied junk flying from it in the direction of the enemy 
---
I'm planning a Turret Camp Destruction Session for Friday Night on Xbox, Myself and hopefully several Friends will be server hopping to destroy as many as we can
---
maybe you took rad-x accidentally suppressing AR 
---
XBone as well and I investigate Whitesprings everytime I log in to check the clubhouse for these offenders, need a partner let me know.
---
maybe they held it back to have a weapon to add in later?
---
I dont know the lore (if any) of the junk jet so maybe it wasn't invented until long after the bombs dropped and it would exist yet?
---
Maybe they just forgot about it?
---
I can acquire around 2k rounds of .556 in a single 20 minute lead/steel/gunpowder run. It's completely irrelevant on my unarmed character.
---
Don't worry, those are all build sets he is talking about, or rather the effects you get from vatipus weapons and armor. I don't pay attention to any of that at level 109 and i still enjoy the game without being a major nerd lol
---
Yeah I figured as much. Thanks
---
Honestly most lvl50-75 characters are pvp characters that are min/max'd. They can be scary. 
---
Anyone over lvl100 usually has all their weight perks and things for pve. So they are not too scary. 
---
To point 1 -
---
As one Redditor once put it, Ultracite and X-01 are like the Ferraris of Power Armor.  The Excavator is like a pick-up truck.  It's built to take a beating.  It has ridiculous durability.  You seldom have to repair it.
---
Looks like a raider settlement that's obsessed with shelves lol.
---
The Shelf Junkies
---
That does make sense when you put it like that period thank you so good sir! The balancing as is in the game does probly still need some fixing so adding something like this would undo a lot of hard work I am sure
---
I'm going to buy another copy when it's like $20 to do the same...
---
Players can have a max of 320 hit points IIRC. You don't need to optimize for damage for PvP, you just need enough damage
---
S yeah same here. I definitely messed up early on but didn't realize it till it was far too late and I really just wanted to keep playing but now I'm almost too high and I kind of just wanna maybe use that character for some of the daily and weekly challenges and spend the rest of my time in another one
---
I second this üëç
---
I suppose workshops were just a copy paste of the *camp workshop system* and they left it up to the players to use this or not.
---
Can' fathom why anyone would use there own resources on a transient workshop once they have used up all the supplied mats in the claimed workshop. Oh well  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
What u want for that minigun?
---
Gamestop is just a pawnshop for video games.
---
I have heard that it still bugs out with Strange in Numbers, is that the case?
---
Same with this one.
---
Trust me. I'm a doctor. 
---
The higher your level, the bigger a train of lower level players following behind you at Whitespring will be.
---
Yeah.  It's a real insult-to-injury kind of thing when the whole thing can be replaced just for the cost of moving your CAMP over to the right for 20 Caps. ü§î
---
1k for explosive minigun and 500 for two shot minigun is ok?
---
Yeah, West-Tek is okay. In my experience, whitespring is better. West-Tek is still on my legendary *and gunpowder* route.
---
All my armour has a weight reduction effect makes things easier 
---
Honestly I don't know. That card has always been a problem. Refuse to play on team with anyone that uses it. It has messed with mutations for a long time so maybe. 
---
I have found that with 2 levels of chem weight reduction and 2 levels in food/water weight reduction, I can survive decently. Most other points are into rifle damage, armour penetration, sneak, and critical improvement. I only miss out on maybe 5-10% of damage or whatever so I can have those weight reduction perks. I am happy with the balance. For me it‚Äôs all part of the survival part of the game. It‚Äôs about learning to deal with what you have and optimizing it the best you can. I can‚Äôt imagine the tediousness of having to move stuff around to a mule character all the time. Sure, storing some more legendaries would be nice, but really how many are you gonna get that you actually want to use? And soon we will have something to do with the rest other than sell.
---
Iirc it was done by a maintenance worker at ArcJet before the bombs fell. 
---
Physics are expensive.
---
Seen them spawn outside of whitesprings boundary to the east, on the road running north south there is a group of destroyed cars that spawn random level ghouls. One of which I've seen in a good outfit.
---
Oh i see the problem here... you're using the term griefing wrong! Griefing is exploiting game mechanics in unintended ways to cause grief to other players. The things you described are all intended. Griefing in this game would be trapping someone in your camp. Or standing in a door way in their power armor so they can't walk past and have to fast travel out. The things you described coupled with Bethesda's intention that players be the npcs suggests that everything is as it should be.
---
Spoken like a true griefer, lol.
---
320 hp is no where close to the maximum. you can have easily 500+. 
---
Personally, I think they should increase the building exclusion zone around the building as other's have suggested. But, this post was never meant to be a call for restrictions. It just kind of developed into that.
---
The griefer ? You‚Äôre asking a griefers victim where‚Äôs the fun for the griefer? Lolz
---
Game runs like ass, and you want to add more stress to it with weather effects? 
---
What did u use to get those purifiers inside? Some of the rugs?
---
I still really think that the 2nd floor of the "Top of the World" building would be perfect.. There's a restaurant, shops, crafting tables, little kiosks, a stage, and it's huge/pointlessly sitting empty! I wish they did more with that building, since it has a lot of potential, and in the middle of everything
---
And I would like to see what a plan is going to look like before I buy it from the vendor. The option of examining it should provide that info. I shouldn't have to GIS it.
---
Also, I want to know what a mod is going to do before I buy it. The descriptions aren't always informative enough.
---
What??? *At most*, you have completed the main quest by level 50 and maybe a few side quests...
---
If you really think there's nothing to do to level up and fix mistakes you made in levelling perks, you haven't searched nearly enough.
---
Man there are people out there who will put the time in I had a job where my supervisor would literally use his vacation specific to game releases so he could spend two weeks playing whatever game it was coming I remember he did it for a WoW expansion even these people do exist 
---
Oh look another gold! Time.to edit that in too!
---
I agree. in Fallout 4, I downloaded a mod who add Radstorm and "normal" storm. We need more climatic event to feel the "survival" aspect of the game !
---
how much do you want for the ts combant shotgun?
---
LOL so they can nerf camp budgets to where you can only have 1 tato plant?
---
Not sure how this is a serious problem. Surely there are more important issues. I'm hard pressed to think of a less serious problem. 
---
i agree, not having to play the inventory management minigame makes the game 100% more fun.
---
I say whitesprings. It has vendors and a room in the shopping hall with like 5 of each bench in it and 2 or 3 stash boxes. All in the same room.
---
Or Top of the world would be great too. 
---
Flatwoods is good for the reasons you say too. 
---
We need a poll
---
Round rugs.  Same with the water pump, the radiation shower (over wood) and the pressure plate (over wood).  The corn, tatos, razorgrain a blackberry bushes are on round rugs while the mutfruit and carrots are on planters.
---
&gt; However, this absolutely doesn't reflect if it's easy or hard to write the proper code in the game to implement this algorithm. 
---
However, it turns out that it is. The PC mod was simple. Literally 3 lines of code. Worked perfectly until Bethesda broke it.
---
Yeah. Let's hear more about this. I just give these bitches away to keep aparrel weight down.
---
I've heard of this. I've only ever seen one base there. I would have more leniency here as it is a low level area and the player's may simply not know about this. Although if they are there I would inform them. Incidentally, I haven't seen the Vendor in almost a month. Any idea where to find him? Still there? I've server hoped it a few times trying to get him to spawn, but every time I spawn the area it's something else. Need a few of his outfits.
---
That's completely different. Stop jerking Bethesda off.
---
Not trying to be a dick about it, but I don't think you're using "speculate" correctly.
---
I sold a bunch of legendaries I did not want, and one that I did. I did not realize it until the next day.
---
but, this isn't an MMO
---
400 caps is ok?
---
It'd be awesome if u/valseek  , u/LoneVaultWanderer , or u/Ladydevann could provide some insight on when we can or may expect a fix on this mutation. Kind of a bummer when you have 9+ mut's and don't want to risk/pay for reacquiring all of them again. Please? And Thank you in advance ; ) .
---
Unless it's a bug pack (ie that robco event) I haven't had issue with them in a while.  It takes time for them to rotate guns so I tend to get tagged a few times.  I'll do the thruster on occasion, personally I like bunching bots together to share the boom, protectrons are great for this too.  It's one reason I stay hostile for watoga, just amuses me see how many I can get to cook off in a herd.  ; )
---
Thanks,  got to test it üëç
---
How did you get .3 caps
---
No, you are not a dick at all. On the contrary, I appreciate it. I will look at it now. 
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
sure! should I sign on now or will you be on later?
---
Yeah, I made this mistake as well. I saw him just sitting on one of the cliffs in the savage divide and I was looking out over another cliff side probably 100-150 yards away. I charged up a gauss shot and got him with a sneak attack and suddenly he was hover-flying directly at my face. Fuck those things.
---
Anyone thinking griefing in Fallout 76 is bad should play Red Dead Online for an hour.  That game has some of the worst griefers I've ever seen.
---
Yeah... I still cannot put my finger on where the issue lies - other than having a 'proximity radius' condition that seems present - but it is a tricky one...
---
Either way thanks for the reply :) 
---
Mhh with the junk ammo in containers I think is a good idea. Will spawn at ever shoot random junk. That's nice.
---
Two shot with a quarter bear lol
---
Like the normal effect. Shoots 2 bears and the second one only does 25%dmg :) 
---
No problem. I've logged in and out many times over the last 5 or 6 days. Still working. 
---
I play on PS4, stopped briefly and picked it back up with a new character. I still get random flashes where the terrain glitches out and I got disconnected after leveling up. other than that just basic lag and glitches. Until new content arrives you gotta make your own fun.
---
i am on now IGN: Katerina\_Petrov
---
Yeah, there's alot of helpful things the game doesn't really tell you.
---
I only just recently learned that the fountain in the Whitesprings heals the user of diseases. So many wasted disease cures!
---
AIIIEOOOOOOOH MAAAAAAH SOOUU-OOUUL... To the company store...
---
*du du du du dududu du*
---
System?
---
I changed it to observing. Seems like a better fit!
---
xTimmyTurmoilx I'll be on later today.
---
We all saw it, we just didn't think it was a good idea.
---
That's it! So I was wondering why it isn't in game ü§î also think about it could be an future content item
---
Oops lol Xbox 
---
Yeah the doors are pretty much backwards. When using the keypad, make sure you are attaching it to the main power point on the door (there are two connection points). One is just for the keypad attached to the door the other is for an external keypad or switch. One connection point is in the top middle of the wall/doorframe, the other is off to the side.
---
Only workaround for a new code is to store the wall or keypad switch, then put it back out and hope for a "better" code. Hope this helped
---
Stumbled across this scary fellow last night. Then the server crashed and I lost the 3* wood armor I had just got.
---
My game loads just fine, normally takes 1-2 mins
---
Amen to that
---
Preach it brother
---
We both hated that quest and would rank it in the top five quests.
---
I can only imagine what they are thinking when I exit my power armor and get on my knees and ask them to be my Negan. Plus I usually hook them up with stimpacks and other chems along with my bounty. ( I have an addiction to collecting junk and I don't want to lose it for a bounty)
---
So you average over 11 hours of fo76 everyday?  They didn't ban you they gave you your freedom back. You need help. 
---
You may wanna build some stuff with all that junk.
---
Crafting gives XP. Breaking down crafted weapons has a chance to teach a mod for that weapon. 
---
Oh, what column is it in?
---
The issue is the frequency of the *offence* at this specific location. Although, I do attack the Queen camp as well. However, I don't see it there nearly as frequently. And, honestly, now that tagging a base accidentally doesn't make you aggro to the turrets I really don't even care. The Whitespring bunker isn't a legendary farming spot as far as I can tell, at least not a common one. Anyway, I think it is completely fair to blame the camp mechanic for me not getting as much loot. Especially in a spot that is a common farming location for loot.
---
There is a mod on the nexus that protects your items. Jt is literally only 3 lines... It really is as easy as he stated.
---
:)
---
the problem would be the workshops, how would you remove it from another player? 
---
IMO it would be acceptable and satisfy ops complaint if there were "rules" enforced by the robots like "Whitesprings prohibits the use of ballistic emplacements, violators subject to termination" 
---
Tell me more.
---
I have rank 3 Animal Friend, and it does well for Pacifying things. But how do I make them come back to the camp? They always just stand around after being pacified. 
---
Third Rule of Fight Club:  No Name calling guys, let's not be like those other clubs.
---
Even with 500, that damage is pretty easy to achieve without min-maxing. I run a full health melee build and only spec to have 350 damage and that's quite enough to kill most. My survivability takes priority over my damage
---
I don't agree that you can't have any weight reduction perks. The weight reduction perks just need to make sense. If you're running dodgy or you're a cavalier and rely on nuka cherries/honey to maintain AP, then it makes sense to have thru hiker. If you're not running adamantium skeleton but need to carry more stims to negate limb damage, then it makes sense to have traveling pharm.
---
he is bored .. theres nothing to do in the game right now
---
I'm on most afternoons (after 3pm CST)  look me up.  Game tag same as it is here.
---
\+karma
---
It's in the same column as beds but a different box, sorry. Should be right under it? There would be an atom emblem and the other beds are selectable too. They'll have a locked symbol next to them
---
Mine too, I have 2 cards to slated reduce weight of armor
---
Nah, now the map builds on you
---
They won't know unless you tell them, and wrecking their base normally gets them to shoe up and chat. 
---
Still spawns there. 
---
I have my personal area locked, and a "rest station" always open to passing travellers. There's a bed, decon shower, stash box, and power armor station there.
---
That BOS recon rifle is really odd. Why does it have a ton of durability at levels 1 and 5 for crafting, but the bar drastically shrinks to like a quarter of an inch long at level 10, and then steadily grows again towards the level 1 durability bar (but never gets to the same size), as you increase the level, up to 50? It's so strange to me, can someone give an explanation? 
---
Yeah like a couple of days ago it was super fast too.
---
Periodically, sometimes it loads in 2 minutes, sometimes 5, sometime long enough to make me question if I'm on an infinite load screen.
---
I think it's their servers personally.
---
Because NPCs can't open locked doors. My Camp has two rolling shutters that I open when I'm online and has free water, bed, shelter and amenities for any Dweller to use. I have 1 locked door and if the shutters are down, it's the only way in to the Camp. It's always locked and closed so if you can't get in through the shutters, I'm probably asleep or laying low. Just have to make due with the train station over the road for protection
---
no . its not what Bethesda invision
---
Gives solid advice, gets downvoted anyway...
---
Sometimes yes. After a few minutes I hard quit and just come back in. 
---
Yeah that would make sense, hopefully bethesda informs us, I don't want to brag, but I have good internet and a good PC, and I cleaned out my drive, so I was really confused.
---
Yes, that breathing is so creepy. A couple days ago I was just about to finish my play session but decided to check out the emergency services building in Watoga. I walked off the elevator, immediately heard that noise and just backed right back up into the elevator and hit the button. Called it a day.
---
Thank you for answering so thoroughly.
---
Friendly PvE style challenges for ownership - did you read my workshop proposal?  Something like Monster Mash, they can build similar type challenges that doesn't require PvP to challenge for workshops.
---
Lol, that's pretty funny. I actually have a Negan bat on melee character (I'm sure a lot of players do). When I take player's loot I leave 1 item in the bag and drop a stimpak just to add a little insult to injury. Kinda my calling card lol
---
Ah dam I work night shift so I'm usually sleeping during that time. Thank though!
---
We're all from the same vault, we should be allies to each other.  Besides, the human race has dwindled enough, we need every survivor to thrive to rebuild America!  
---
How so? Those mules never duped. They just picked up dem brown bags full of tses
---
Roger that, I was just weighing in on possibilities, since I have had similar experience in the past.  I haven't done a nuke zone this week though, but plan on launching a couple tonite if possible.  I'll keep an eye on my condition and see if I notice anything.  I run radicool in the nuke zones anyway and check it with glowing blood packs, reduce with diluted radaway Rad-ex nerfs my mutation.
---
Why don‚Äôt you put your base there if you go that often?
---
Lol 8,300k in caps I could of posted it better 
---
If they don‚Äôt leave you alone, they can still slowly bring down your health. 4 of them might do it more quickly. 
---
This makes me sad, I will probably stick to shotguns then.  If I come back, waiting for them to finish patching the game and get some endgame content.  I was farming for the x01 suit pieces and then I can finish the nuke quests but I kinda lost interest.
---
Another silver... means another edit... oh well!
---
I'm on PC, and it's better but still not great.  There's a *lot* of lag in SBQ fights, and I still get the occasional random disconnect.  It's less frequent than it was, though.
---
Edit:‚Äù I genuinely want to know why‚Äù sorry didn‚Äôt look at the first part.
---
Nope. I've been attacked every time. A few pathing problems were they take a less them optimal path towards me. Used the terrain to my advantage to delay and slow down guys. But never stood still and let me just slaughter them.
---
I think I just realized, when I was was trying to build it last night, I was in a friend's camp. That must have been it.
---
Some dude had his political choice for president labeled on his home and some random asked me who I voted for. Uneasy to get I to this in the post apocalyptic setting I said I'm just here to play bro. He got frustrated and said fuck it I'm gonna go fuck up this dudes maga house. I've never seen so many go raider so fast it was beautiful. I did join lol. I felt bad after we demolished his house and he tried to come and defend it and got laid to waste as he yelled profanities and gender specific slurs. 
---
I always remember that things in games first before the actual good things you know. DMV quest is up there in my all time hated quests.
---
I cut the vid too quick but he was still moving around after and while I was hitting him before I sneak critted
---
All these replies show that my comment got under your skin. Another feel good moment.
---
While I do like the idea of the range covering the whole map (like vertibots, right?), I disagree that CAMPs are intended to have a high mobility role.
---
I think they are intended to be used however the player wants. Just because someone wants to pick one spot and build a whole estate there doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre doing it ‚Äúwrong,‚Äù and that people who just plop down workbenches in a field are doing it ‚Äúright.‚Äù
---
I get so much legendary armor every time I farm whitesprings I just drop it
---
You realize you‚Äôre bitching about an element that is DIRECTLY tied to PvP‚Ä¶ Workshops. Stop taking them if you‚Äôre not prepared to defend them. How hard is this?!
---
Killed me when I realized Pharma Farma was using up space for so long. Thought it was passive as well. Some of these mechanics need better wording.
---
1 - I like my base where it is... off the beaten path.
---
2 - I don't need turrets to clear it. 
---
3 - I know how frustrating it is to other players.
---
4 - I spend a significant amount of time other places too. The whitespring is just one location out of many that I farm.
---
5 - I don't want to constantly keep it up and running because it's frequently being attacked.
---
If that ever happens, you can take(transfer) each individual piece off the frame, and put them in your inventory. Then you pick up the empty frame again to claim it, put it down, transfer the pieces back to it, and let it automatically go into your inventory again.
---
Just wanted to rub it in your face for being a sour sally lol
---
Seems you are more upset than I am.
---
Ps4 add me for legendary buy sell and trade. the15thboss
---
Yes, the prospector will be nice and it the reason I'm storing up legendaries right now. My point is being a rifleman build vs melee is asking for punishment due to rifleman doing less dammage for an equivalent built PLUS having the burdensome chore of constantly having to make scrap runs for ammo crafting ALSO having to burn perk cards to reduce ammo weight.  My opinion is that rifleman is underpowered (vs melee) unless you max rank every rifleman card, bloody mess, tank killer, sneak and sandman and then there isn't much room for weight reduction cards after all that.  My opinion is a 20% buff would make rifleman more of a valid build.  
---
I'm not sure what you are rubbing in my face. Edits for upvotes are embarrassing lame. You can get a million of them for all I care, but to edit about it. That's weird.
---
I can‚Äôt just initiate PvP with you at a Train Station unless you hit me back. What does a Train Station have to do with any of this? 
---
Meatball mans.
---
Many factions in FO76 are post-war: Responders, Fire Breathers, BoS, Raiders, Free States,... 
---
So why wouldn't they acquire a set of (E)PA and slap their logo on it? Why would they design their own uniforms but leave the paintjob of (E)PA completely untouched?
---
I'm aware that the Excavator was a prototype developed by Garrahan Mining and thus not widely available... but all we have to do is access a computer terminal, learn the plans and build it from scratch. Other factions could've done the same....
---
‚ÄúWhat was the point?  Why get in my way?‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs part of the point of the game.  Not all player interactions need be positive.  It adds to the suspense of the game.
---
That's what they all say.
---
I take a chill outlook at the game, kinda like Bob Ross. One step at a time.
---
*Oh, you contracted glowing pustules? At least I get to go on a quest looking for a Cure disease. Ooh a a Furious Board, don't mind if I do.*
---
Shhhhhhhhhh. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^you ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^can ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^jump ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^through ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^those.
---
Some griefers scout the camp before they start trashing it (yes, I've seen people do this first-hand), so the lock buys me a bit of time to fight back or log-off, depending what I'm in the mood for.   
---
I have a stash, unlocked water, and crafting benches outside the locked area as well, so you really aren't missing anything past the lock. 
---
If you‚Äôre there to play fallout with no one around, play FO4. You‚Äôre playing an online Fallout with PvP built into it as a main feature. Stop bitching about a feature as if it‚Äôs an unwanted bug. 
---
I agree this is something I want to see with the armor variation because I‚Äôm transitioning to a stealth build and it‚Äôs hard sneaking behind a super mutant while in plain sight
---
I dont even own rad-x only dilluted so no.
---
I'm just glad I could bring some good content to the community. I'm sorry it didn't sooth to your preference. 
---
In your Pip boy when your'e on the Junk tab you can hit RB (XBox) and it will come up with a components breakdown. You can scroll down and tag ones you want to stand out. Once you do that if you hover over a piece of junk in the world that will breakdown into that component it will have a magnifying glass symbol next to it.
---
The first time me and a friend came across a snallygaster, our instinctive reaction was to immediately run away lol
---
I put mine in the suitcases at the station it's always crappy 1 star stuff from whitesprings anyways 
---
And even if you already bought 18 serums and tried to fix it yourself it doesnt freaking work. Please fix.
---
I have cap collector maxed out (3 stars). You'll have to search the cap box to get the extra caps (triangle on PS4) and sometimes the option to search isn't there. If that happens, walk about 20-30 feet away then come back and it will reset so you can search. Its a bug they know about.
---
Because I own the place and I can.  That's the only reason I need. 
---
I would like to see every song from every previous title all in FO76. There are some that were in FO4 that seem to be missing that I really liked. 
---
I don‚Äôt even install doors!  Everyone welcome.
---
Why just A hub, why not various ones?
---
Vault 76 (New Player Hub ((for players to help new players fresh out of the vault))), Flatwoods (Beginners/Tutorial Hub ((Complete with brahmin and a vendor and fertile event to help players understand *how* to play better))), Top of the World second floor (Quest/Event Hub), Whitesprings Resort second floor (Trading Hub), Watoga Station (EndGame Hub ((organized sbq/events and legendaries raids))).
---
Or basically designated types of hubs for various things so new players have one, casual players have one, and advanced players have one, plus one for organizing trading and one for organizing quests and events.  If we gonna hub lets hub right.
---
I like these posts that remind the player base that Fallout is a post apocalyptic game where bad things are supposed people. Remember slavery in New Vegas? You could become a slave hunter. Fallout is about letting you make the decisions‚Äîincluding to be a bad guy. 
---
However, if you take this one step further and what you've defined as "griefers" are the Raiders from Fallout lore, then as a Raider one should realize that they are not going to be popular. 80% of the community is going to complain about you and try to get the game changed so you can't bother them. It's our community's equivalent of organizing, forming a Diamond City, and taking the fight back to the Raiders.   
---
Just as the player Raider has figured out that it's fun and easy to kill people and take their stuff rather than farming it yourself, the player townies have figured out it's easier to complain on this forum than it is to organize in game and fight back. 
---
I agree completely that player Raiders are an important part of the game and it's why Bethesda built PvP, workshop battles, and CAMP destruction into the game. But if you're going to play as a Raider, you're going to have to accept the fact that you and your opinions aren't going to be popular. That's Raider life. 
---
After a Vault party, the Overseer woke up in bed with and married to you.  She wasn‚Äôt really obligated to leave the vault early...she just wanted to get as far away from you as possible.
---
That's the bug, hitting Attach Mod makes the sound, but doesn't move forward.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can show you how it works...
---
Xbox?
---
I do the same thing with another Xbox as well, but where does the $30 part come in?  The game on the second console is free if you set it to be your home xbox.  
---
Yes, that really sucks. Then not only are you out the previously working mutation, you're also out quite a few caps on top of it. That's why I've pretty much resigned myself to stay pat, and not make a bad situation worse. 
---
I approve this message 
---
You are right about melee being better. Some choices like rifles not having weight reduction and strength being the only stat tied to damage are strange choices I agree. I agree that I hope some more balance is brought forth in the future. But the fact that some melee guy is doing more damage than me isn‚Äôt going to bother me that much to cause me to ruin the fun of my own gameplay and carry around a mule just so I can have a little more damage. With my build that I gave you, I can target the head for a multiplier, sneak multiplier, and with high luck I very frequently have a crit shot. The game is so easy with my build, and I have my weight reduction. Like I said, pvp is so minor, and so what if some melee guy can swing for a lot of damage. All my factors I listed cause me to dish out big damage too. 
---
I‚Äôm a Raider! I love FO76! I get to take workshops like crazy. After being a Raider for a month or two, I‚Äôve noticed people seem to like it. I get into long drawn-out fights with people. They keep hitting ‚ÄòSeek Revenge‚Äô so it shows me they keep wanting to fight. If they just fast travel away and don‚Äôt engage, I‚Äôll leave them alone. 
---
Why do you not co-op FO76 with your wife? It's perfect for co-op.
---
Were you friends with everyone in high school?
---
I wish I could up vote that more.  Almost spit my coffee out laughing.
---
So he was still twitching while dead?
---
Moving around and howling
---
I was done pretty much all the quests by level 50. I am obviously still playing, but I wouldn't consider myself an average player, I've been a big fan of the Fallout universe since Bethesda first got the rights. But the game needs to appeal to more than just superfans
---
And entitled to spoil others entertainment pleasure because of ... ?
---
I don't even install walls
---
If all you've done is quests by level 50, you still have a good amount of stuff to do.
---
So far I‚Äôve only seen 2 rad storms since I started playing. I‚Äôve played ever since the beta.
---
I'm gonna apply!
---
Just another day in FO76.
---
Hope so
---
He's not duping he's dividing üòÇ
---
Making the most popular nuke target a trading hub is probably a bad idea...
---
Your kidding yourself if you think raiding or as this sub calls it "gRiEfInG" isnt lucrative...
---
Caps from kills. Hundreds of pounds of bulk junk from about 5% of kills. 
---
Ive killed players holding enough junk to sell out every vendor twice. 2500 caps... 
---
Ive killed groups of players who keep seeking revenge and losing 3000+ caps...
---
The idea that we just want to make people miserable is short sighted and lame. Ive had my base smashed 10 times in a week. Ive ran into players who wreck me. Over and over. Ive been on both sides of this argument and the difference is: i dont get upset when im losing. Its a game kids. Settle down.
---
Some of like to PvP. Believe it or not. I have no interest in making players "feel bad". If your upset about a game, take a step back and realize your priorities are all fucked up. 
---
Pvp, wanted or unwanted is a game mechanic. If you dont want to engage.. The burden is on you to server hop. Bethesda gave carebears 4 layers of protection against Pvp: SLAP, SERVER HOP, BLOCK and BOUNTY. 
---
it is extremely arrogant of the community to assume you can play in an open world pvp enabled game and demand to opt out. How am i supposed to know whose opting out? The way i play wad advertised from the initial press release... Pvp was an advertised aspect. If you want to pretend its a single player game, once again the burden is on you to server hop the moment someone is near you.
---
Griefing isnt even a thing in this game. Theres just a group of ignorant people in denial about the game they are playing.  Believe it or not, some of us like having raiders around. 
---
The level you get all the perks depends upon how lucky you are with the bonus packs every five levels, and whether you just want the max of every card, or a set of level 1, 2, 3... of each card. 
---
yeah, b/c most ppl assume at high levels, you have great gear.
---
....which means that  Bethesda envisioned a game that long-time fans of the Fallout series wouldn't find fun.   
---
Yes its alot better but still have ways to go. Its a singleplayer game code being converted to multiplayer some things may take time to smooth out.
---
Yep never happened to me.  Have had them twitch as their rag doll bodies moved around a bit due to geometry.  But that happens in a lot of games.
---
They slowly start to walk to your camp after a bit if nothing interferes.  But most times they get killed. Unfortunately 
---
dmv?
---
anyway, try wiping your inis
---
If I had it my way I'd make everyone I trade with meet me in the lobby of the enclave bunker. Also they'd release a sitting animation in the atomic store that had me drinking Brandy. 
---
Side note: I actually can't watch your video from work because of our server, but youtube has a blurring tool in their upload.  Might be what you are looking for.   This story was hysterical.  I hope those guys had the Top Gun training talk after. "Where did who go?"  
---
[LINK FOR BLUUUURRRRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V4dlR2m5QQ)
---
Maybe he has the physical disc
---
I know you can stack brick walls to brick walls with the white facing out, but idk how to get white to white with the brick facing out
---
I was really expecting to see legendary PA pieces as quest rewards. Similar to the one in FO4 where you craft a chest piece iirc.
---
I feel like even if PA legendaries had their effects halved, people would still lose their minds over it sadly.
---
Hopefully this will happen. The fact that a survival mode is even coming out suggests that there was a huge backlash over the current state of PVP.  Hopefully they are listening. 
---
The current state of PVP is hated by both people who love PVP and long- time fans of Fallout who hate PVP.  They tried to be all things to all people and became nothing to no one.  They would have to be really dense not to see this (which is a very real possibility). 
---
Hopefully they will straighten this mess out. 
---
I didn‚Äôt think it was nearly as bad as everyone else. Though I believe I had part of what I needed before starting it. It was just running around the building shooting muties. 
---
yap
---
So very true. I have a 160ish run and gun build from pre-nerf, and now he's weak as water. I need probably 30 levels to set him straight. He'll never get any better if we don't get a point reset option. 
---
8,300k, so 830,000? That's a whole lot of caps, even with alt characters. Or do you mean 8.3k? Man, you are having a rough time with this. Lol
---
he is using a game mechanic to entertain him self. its not odd game design.
---
Can you list some things? Maybe I've overlooked some stuff. (asking honestly)
---
-Build a CAMP with everything I need
---
-control a workshop
---
-launch a nuke
---
-kill nuked enemies and collect nuked plants for advanced mods
---
-mod up my power armor and weapons
---
-kill the SBQ
---
-server hop endlessly for rare X-01 mods at the Whitespring Bunker, the most fun of all
---
What makes it so fun for you? As I said, I enjoyed it. Bethesda didn‚Äôt handle anything professionally and changed as a company drastically. Im asking that question honestly though; what do you enjoy about the game right now? And can I also ask which of the other games that I listed have you played?
---
Well then my game is broken cuz it isn't an option to favorite , I'm on xbox btw , 
---
?
---
I cap workshops at level 28 in raider power armor with a bladed rocket bat. Auto stim and some fury and ill fight honorably for my resources. Level scaling means i take out ill equipped level 50+'s all day. I got excavator in my previous 2 characters but found that i never replaced it, which made the pa experience really boring, so i decided to not even bother with it on this one. There's so many chances to stash your junk its kinda silly to do anything with workshops all junked up. Stash box is first thing i build when i cap shops. Often 2 or 3. Plop em down right next to the extractors so i don't get caught running from one end of gorge junkyard to the other with that precious handful of screws and gears. 
---
Move your camp.
---
Seriously, like pay caps to move it.
---
Fairly sure it auto-repairs your stuff.
---
Everyone is always at whitesprings. Just use the lobby near the shops in there. Alos inside is safe from nukes but getting in there during a nuke is another story if you dont have PA or a hazmat (But at this point who doesnt)
---
You didn‚Äôt have to keep reading if it upset you. I just needed to say it and see if I was the only one. I‚Äôm sick of reading pure hate of the game based on ignorance and inexperience. I played the game a lot
---
U kno what I will bid 9.0 caps..how's that 
---
Considering there are people who want to keep the broken look I'd be fine with using atoms to get a non-broken variant for building sets. Seems like the kind of thing the atom shop was meant for, not just racecar beds and new outfits.
---
Can be right and an asshole. No need to pick one or the other. 
---
I sure am. 8.3k this is proof doing this at red lights is a horrible idea.  How many characters would you need for 830,000 caps. Hopefully you are getting a good laugh today. 
---
Sure I can put useful things and also  dirty water and a one time use magazine on the wheel but PA i cant
---
I just want the glowing piss bottles from Far Harbor...
---
For reasons...
---
[](/starlightisee)
---
 But the in game tool tips explain this. Like literally right in the middle of the screen in a big black box with yellow lettering that you have to either accept or cancel. 
---
Hhhhmmmm well I see great Mothman I will search!!! Praise Mothman 
---
That last sentence makes my mind wander in the best way, I‚Äôll give you that much lol
---
Good for you. It's still a time sink. 
---
At least I'm making a great 1st impression on here. Not my original plan 
---
Maybe if it was a player hub, people wouldn't nuke it as much. Also, inside the resort is the exact same nuke or no nuke. So I'm not sure it's really a big concern... You wanna go to the hub but it's nuked? Pop a rad x and walk to the door. That's not really an issue.
---
We have all been there. Sorry I'm not on ps or I would help you. Have you checked r/fobazaar?
---
Level 5 minigun being stuck to you your entire playthrough 
---
It's my house you do not belong in my house just like in real life my house is my privacy. 
---
I'm not stepping into the ring with anyone named *Feral hands*.
---
No but, I will now ty
---
This whole game is a time sink.
---
Yeah lol but I saw one on market76 going for 2k earlier so I suggest you post on there. You will probably have better luck.
---
Workshops should remain PVP. The only place where you can actually kill someone. Outside of that, hell nope
---
That's why I stopped playing 
---
arent there more than enough workshops out there? why do you have to ruin it for low level players? just go find a workshop that is open
---
unless you just want to kill the player and dont care about the workshop
---
I don't like locked doors because I want to see what other people have built and how they've decorated the place. It's neat to see other CAMPs and it's nice when they're unlocked an open for viewing. But I also don't think they're wrong to lock everything away if they want to.
---
For self preservation &amp; realism lol, let‚Äôs face it if it really was the apocalypse you wouldn‚Äôt leave your door unlocked in case someone murdered you in your sleep and if your crafting, cooking sleeping etc why take the risk of someone starting something while your indisposed on a workbench. I have a question though.... if you log out when a stranger is using your camp workbench do you get an infinite loading screen till they finish what they are doing or does your camp disappear from under them, always been curious 
---
i foudn a  good time to take workshops is very late at night or early in the morning, not too many people on then
---
Thank you for kind words
---
.....That's Rambo!
---
You keep thinking you're John Rambo!
---
If u need caps, do a whitsprings run and sell that crap..bam 150 caps or more.
---
A ghooul
---
Couldnt they just take revenge and all spawn right back?
---
I'm hoping player vending is just like a storage box that anyone can access from their own camp; put your items in there, set a price and go.
---
Fair enough. The last sentence does make my mind wander, I‚Äôll give you that
---
as of today, no, it does not exist.
---
There's some sort of respec, it is not a total respec, you just move one special point to another one, if possible, this occurs everytime you level up, starting by level 51, you are granted a choice between this "movement" or unlock a perk card of your choice
---
That's fine. Thank you.
---
Easy, I‚Äôm on xbox. I‚Äôm walking around with a nice AA rifle. I suddenly get swarmed by a hoard of something. So, it‚Äôs close combat, not ranged. The rifle isn‚Äôt powerful enough for close combat. 
---
So, while getting the absolute shit kicked out of me, I open the menu as quick as possible and try switch to a weapon that I don‚Äôt have on my weapon wheel. While scrolling through the list, I accidentally scroll by something and slightly tap the drop button without  knowing. I select the weapon I wanted and kill everything. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt notice my own bag as I‚Äôve been moving around a lot. Say goodbye to that new AA. This is worse in tall grass. Which was where I was. 
---
Interesting to see they're outright adding new locations instead of just reusing old ones 
---
You‚Äôre doing the lords work! 
---
Yeah, I found out today that you can scrap your favorites which shouldn't be a thing. But be careful and take your time.
---
I‚Äôm glad to see that we‚Äôll get a quest with the update along with the new CAMP crafting!
---
I killed an innocent level 10 that didn't even fight back. He had 30 ballistic fiber
---
Now THAT would be a positive change.   
---
If you're bringing in a PVP mode, then turn it off in adventure mode. 
---
PM me and let‚Äôs get you deputized!
---
Don't even joke about huntin' no man.
---
If you weren't nice they'd just call you a griefer and complain on reddit lol.
---
It would be nice if the developers took notice of this post and make the weather more frequent.
---
It's funny because you go directly to the bugs (which is hilarious because I remember a time when games had no patches and had way less bugs than some games nowadays) when I didn't even use the bugs to factor the worth of the 70$ you could pay to get this game. The only thing I used is other examples provided by other companies or even Bethesda themselves. I paid that price for Skyrim, it still has way more content than Fallout 76 and looks just as good.
---
Bought my 10 year old nephew a copy and played with him 1 day. It was too much for him and he never played again.
---
Well before the last update I leveled up an alt to 15 to get the handmade plans. I asked my nephew to log in but the little turd was too busy playing Roblox to help me out. Good thing I made him right his password down because I spent $40 for that.......so guess who has a mule account?..... LOL
---
Turn workshops into the [T.O.W.N.S.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/akhvde/teamwork_oriented_wasteland_neighborhood_system/) idea. Use your contesting idea for whoever will become plant manager(powerplants), CEO(munitions factory) Mayor(bog town), etc. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a rad storm since the beta, I thought they got cut
---
It would be awesome if the system was like in FO4 where you could shoot an enemy's fusion core and they get out of the PA, then you can claim it
---
30! Lucky you 
---
Sometimes you need to take a workshop for special plans or for experience.  What's lame is when people use challenging a workshop to initiate PvP, even if they have no need of the workshop.  Survival mode will hopefully give PVPers what they're after.
---
Which are you talking about? I sent a link.
---
This is the post apocalyptic version of stories like Big Iron. A stranger rolls up in town and fucks over the local gang.
---
Yeah.
---
I know this effects bloodied melee builds too but damn does it feel like rifle builds have been under relentless assault and they weren‚Äôt even that great to begin with.  Which is why people go bloodied in the first place 
---
Don't ask me that I am not a developer lol.
---
Some mods can't be learned from scrapping. Mostly high-end mods, like Deep Pocketed, Ultra-Light, BOS Material, etc.
---
You have to find/buy those.
---
Weather effects are already in the game but more frequent weather is possible and it would make the game more fun.
---
I've been trying for the buttress mod on the chest for marine armor for a solid month now.   Two hundred plus pieces easily and it has not hit yet.   I do batches of about 20 at a time and am lucky to get one mod.    
---
Long story made short, its not just you.
---
It's nice to have the option. Why remove variety from the gamemode?
---
Agreed. I started out wanting to go rifles. . . But it was less than optimal, so I tried something different.
---
Ya when he is there I sneak attack them to help. He is back now just have had the flu
---
That's Fallout!
---
Maybe people were silent and polite. 
---
Sorry. Looks like you put a lot of thought into it, though. 
---
Yeah, I know. It's pretty sad but more weather patterns would be nice.
---
Legendary scrapping isn‚Äôt coming till May 23rd I thought ?
---
green and yellow, I want John Deer tracktor armor.
---
i was talking about a min/max'd pvp character for the sole purpose of pvp. where every point of weight and each and every cola/stim is accounted for. then you re-up once your low at a stash box. 
---
I sell mine to the vendors. You might hold on to your 2 and 3 stars until the next patch. 
---
They are supposed to add a legendary vendor that takes them. 
---
They are still awhile. It's rare though. That's why there have to be more weather patterns and it should be frequent. I doubt it would cause the game to crash or be laggy.
---
Taking workshops from other players is an easy way of earning caps. It's part of the game afterall.
---
Not to mention that many who contest workshops don't really want the workshop at all. Just a means to repeatedly kill unsuspecting workshop owners.This really needs a revamp, those who claim workshops should be forced to own them if they kill the previous owner. 
---
See most people can do that, but what if someone has their camp built somewhere and the game doesn't let them place it down again..cause you know..bethesda
---
Well that's just your opinion.
---
I'm sure ghouls are very happy with the way they live their lives....... until I show up at their club house with my Mr. Handy Buzzsaw.
---
Why don't you just play Fallout 4 if playing with other players triggers you so much? I bought the game to play PVE and PVP together.
---
Hello! I checked again it really is march 12 :p
---
Bethesda, 
---
Serious question. Can you please ignore all posts related to PvP from this aweful anti-PvP forum. 
---
Ps please dont remove pvp from adventure. Most of us like it. 
---
Hmm.. not sure why they chose to share those drinks. They sound useless. I hope there are better options to make crafting drinks worthwhile.
---
Um there's a three star?? All i have are 1 stars??? How do i get them lol
---
I guess just the ability to amass more perk cards so you can switch builds on the fly.  I really wish the guns/armor kept leveling up to 100 as after level 50, the enemies continue to scale with you but your gear doesn't.
---
Wow.  I am clearly doing my rifle/PA build All Wrong.  I gotta start a "pimp my spec" thread at some point to get pointers.
---
Grind events, claim all the workshops and keep doing "defend" and "retake". Racks up the xp and plans / weapons / gear too. It's win / win and something to do in between WhiteSprings runs and maybe a nuke launch if you stay on the server long enough. I've gotten to level 222 and hardly ever rely in WhiteSprings for xp...too crowded for me.
---
Nice to know someone, somewhere, is paying attention. 
---
It works fine for me. It doesnt show up on the pipboy, but when I get low health my chainsaw goes from like 15 or qhatever to 100something damage.
---
If you need adrenal reactions made, Ill do it for you free if you got the flux.
---
Great Idea, and I saw several other good suggestions in this thread regarding Storm movement &amp; tracking.
---
Things like this could help make the west side of the map, a good place for higher level players to visit again.
---
You can try west tek and huntersville...they have supermutants and give good xp....west tek also has legendaries
---
That‚Äôs pretty much it. Do events whenever they are available. Your friend has probably just played more than you. There is no real super quick shortcut anymore. In the first month of the game it was dishing out exp like crazy.
---
I would love to get some zealot armor full set for 75% damage reduction but I'm not sure how to bring it into a blast zone without instantly melting.
---
I play with a controller on PC. I've never done this in 150 hrs...
---
Yes it should run it. 
---
Should you pay that much for thaf PC? No. I bought a laptop with better specs for that price.
---
The hardware looks ok for most part, but the graphics card is lacking, get the 1060 6gb atleast.
---
What's to stop people from making an account to dupe, so their main account can "innocently find" a bag with thousands of items.
---
Seems to me that accounts like this are being frozen, not banned, until fixes are complete. 
---
They are rare. I just do the vendor run when selling legendary and bulk. 
---
7 vendors at 200 caps each, daily. 
---
Maybe they could could make PVP in adventure mode and make it entirely faction based. If you aren't aligned with a faction, then you are neutral and therefore can't be harmed nor can your base,
---
Then make faction alignment a requirement for owning workshops.  Make it so you can't take a workshop unless you are aligned with a faction.    If you take a workshop, anyone else aligned with your faction can freely take whatever it produces.  To really make this work, the workshop output needs to be at least doubled. 
---
Anyone who is not aligned with your faction and takes from a workshop becomes a target.
---
Taking from a workshop while  not being  aligned with a faction instantly aligns you with raiders. 
---
Something like that.
---
So they‚Äôre kinda just like temp Chems / Mutations? I dunno, I‚Äôll reserve judgement until we get them, just nice to have new stuff to do.
---
Sorry, I didn't realize the PC tag.  XB1 user here.
---
So what i need to store are 3 stars right? Thanks ! I can now see this in a different way i wont horde legendaries anymore because they are just 1 star thanks! 
---
Pretty sure their road map has may 23
---
yeah, that too....whats with level 90s I gotta fight with lvl 50 gear?
---
I know its pretty easy to kill them, but i dont get why benefits stop at 50?
---
did they think nobody would go beyond 50?
---

---
We'll make our own hub, with blackjack...and hookers. 
---
Uh hahaha let me read the whole thing this time
---
That's why I have no windows by such items. I don't lock players out but could if needed. There has not been a problem with the open door policy.
---
I give plans away all the time.  Not all of them are building plans.   But some of them are.  I don‚Äôt think that I have anything on me at the moment as I just did a drop for a couple of random players that I ran into.  
---
If you want to start farming building plans, do the powering up events and claim the workshops at the Nuclear power plants.   That‚Äôs where I find the most building plans.  
---
Also, claim other workshops and defend at least once.  You‚Äôll sometimes get decent plans there as well.  
---
No one would ever take workshops rendering them useless. Pvp is apart of the game and isn't going away just because Survival is coming 
---
Yeah, for butchers bounty on PC a third option shows up when you're inspecting the body that says "[Space] to Search." If I press the Space Bar, sometimes I get extra meat (good because I have the Carnivore Mutation). I figured it would do that for the rest of those types as well.
---
The third rule of fight club is have fun and try your best. 
---
Oh yeah it is.... damn guess i just have to sell these :(
---
I‚Äôve also had players who blocked me for contesting their workshop that don‚Äôt seem to understand they‚Äôre intended to be fought over for. 
---
I do that but looking for extra and trading
---
Exactly (thus the 'food' bit with the above. I frequntly toss canned food and water at new characters.)
---
Fourth rule:  if this is your first time at bare knuckle, you have to fight.
---
going for 1,2,3 of each card for max options on builds.
---
But remember that radstorms in 4 were solely created by the Glowing Sea, including ones on The Island and in Nuka World. Sure, that‚Äôs physically in the game but it‚Äôs clear that radstorms are generated by highly radioactive areas and can travel long distances 
---
Yea I‚Äôd start the stock piling in May lol it‚Äôs not hard to get unwanted legendaries 
---
&gt;  What's lame is when people use challenging a workshop to initiate PvP
---
Some guy took the power plant from me last night. The power plant produces fusion cores.  This guy was pretty clearly a melee character who did not use power armor. 
---
He had no need for it at all. He was just being a dick.
---
So you have to go back to VTU every day for a CHANCE to learn ONE recipe?
---
Yikes.
---
Are you out of materials?  If not, do you have all those materials either in your stash or in your inventory?
---
I either sell 1* to vendors or give them to other players for free. I‚Äôm more inclined to hold on to crummy 2* and 3* because it appears that greater stars yield greater benefits for the upcoming legendary vendor, though they do quickly fill up my inventory. 
---
Okay thank for the info üëçüòÅ
---
[Just for you](https://imgur.com/1OSaIBg)
---
It may seem to be a simple feature for a player, but as I said, you don't know how this is handled by the source-code. Something that seems to be simple for the player is not necessary something that is simple to implement, in terms of development (and this applies not only for games, but for everything in general).
---
"No chems, no weapons, no crying."  
---
Sounds like a reference to World of Warcraft when you had to duel 5 death knights.
---
Yeah xD and ill also just stockpile 3 stars  not 1 stars i just learned that there are 3 stars legendary lol
---
Fourth rule is that if anyone gets hurt we‚Äôll immediately stop 
---
This.  When you apply a real life perspective to this game, everything becomes sad and terrifying.  I hate ticks IRL, in the game they're nothing but free resources....however, the idea of agressive ticks the size of a medium dog is enough to make me think I'd eat a 10mm my first week in the wasteland.   
---
He's just an aggressive troll, everyone. Move along. Similar comments from /u/EricJrSrIV include:
---
&gt; Don‚Äôt take the workshop if you don‚Äôt want to defend it. Jesus fuck. 
---
level 32, first play through.  I picked up both the death tambo and mole miner claw last weekend.  Googled for more info.  Your post came up.  Didnt look at the date, just replied with what I learned about it after I picked it up..
---
Tried messaging you last night, must have missed ya.  Wanting to see about picking up the chameleon mutation, if possible.  Thanks!
---
I am lvl 109 with full rifleman cards and no issues with ammo management.  I rarely make 5.56 and use my two shot hand made all the time.
---
If you are in the trailer there should be a skeleton with a lootable tinfoil hat on its head.
---
now what do you think the graffiti is? lol
---
Lol you give such a fuck its sad. Reddit police ffs. I dont care man, sorry you like seeing the same post everyday
---
I'm one of those " middle of the line" guys. 
---
chems are already temp
---
That's why I have a public area - with workstations, beds, musical instruments, stash boxes, and a private area with a bed, workstations, resource extractor, crops, decontamination shower, etc.
---
Yeah ! I just learned there's a 2* and 3* versions xD i can now sell or gives these babies with less heartache 
---
Finally, someone playing the game as intended...
---
And stabilized?
---
As you can see by your pip-boy, the session always starts as October 23, the longer you stay on the same server, the more days pass, but if you get disconnected or you server hop, the date will revert back to October 23.
---
I love me some shenanigans 
---
I know that and I agree, but what are the things that look like hats or spaceships?
---
After completing *every quest*? Collect all unique weapons, collect all unique armor, complete Order of Mysteries if you haven't, find all keys/holotapes/etc., find/buy all plans/recipes you need, get all mutations you want, discover all locations, complete all Challenges.
---
Mirelurk Queen.  Those don't play.  I'll take wendigo, yao guai, scorchbeasts, any of those, but I will route around an MQ (unless I'm carrying my \*3 anti-mirelurk crippling combat rifle, at which point it's on).
---
Started pistals and explosives then explosives and heavy now pure heavy guns.
---
Alright, thanks
---
I thought they were ufos
---
TSE *and* fire? Oh Lordy. 
---
Store all that junk and walk into the cranberry bog. You'll die a lot but the high level enemies give good XP. 
---
Savage divide is similar but the enemy levels vary quite a bit more. 
---
I find the issue more with Armor especially when you are in power armor as there is no way to know what armor you are wearing and what you are not when you are trying to scrap stuff because they become "unequipped" when in the power armor 
---
My toon most impacted by the gun nerf is 160ish. It'll take a lot to rework him and I don't feel like running around for 30 levels all squishy and anemic. So I have a melee main now, but still pine for my old beta toon. I see the number in the lower right corner of my screen going up all the time and don't need paint for my power armor.
---
I think you learn the plans for the crafting station and the Nukashine recipe. Then the rest are just out in the world
---
Okay, so one light, three lights?
---
I think this is why the incendiary legendary is only one one weapon in the game. But yeah this is going to be fun. Though as a rifle build think it is better on my instigating. 
---
I had 2 rad storms since beta launch. Both lasted less than a minute. I absolutely understand you.
---
I second this. OP makes it sound like not being a good person is something that Bethesda wants in the game. I understand wanting to role play that but do it on a pvp server. Also, griefing people who are on passive is nothing more making other people feel worse for your own amusement. You can try to mask it as role playing but if they're on passive you clearly don't care. Griefing is nothing short of bullying.
---
Let's talk about a starting price on that furious lever. Would you take 300 caps?
---
Just make it like actually living in West Virginia...all 4 seasons within a week's time!
---
Its cool to be able to brew your own stuff but the perks don't seem to be worth it.
---
Technically weather is constant, even when  no ‚Äúweather‚Äù it‚Äôs still weather
---
It's a mix of this and the bodies instantly turning to meat/metal piles and snapping back certain locations.  The locations are sometimes the spawn point, but other times they are the point the enemy defaults to after spawning(like the wendigo in "One Violent Night" and how it will always go back to the center of the room near the stage, if you die or move out of it's range).
---
At least in the case of the meat/metal piles snapping back to locations other than where they were killed, you can still loot them(assuming you don't get the loot bug that causes them to have no visible inventory, despite having weight), it just takes some searching.  When they drop below the surface you are just screwed.
---
I‚Äôve thought about switching to melee. I have enough points saved up where I could rebuild myself but as soon as I do that they‚Äôll just nerf them. People are already butt hurt about getting one shotted by melee builds. 
---
I dont like having to 5 shot anything...so in a horde your screwed w/o melee or high damage gear/specs.
---
I'm not a wanderer...want to find mean stuff and kill it.
---
West Tek and huntersville are your best options.
---
DMV in the state I'm in has the forms are online and part of the verification process is automated, so you just need to show up and have proof of identity. It actually took me less time to get a Real ID license (Had a ten year license prior) then it did to complete the quest in game.
---
I feel that an atom based respec would be a good idea and bring more currency to the atom shop.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the price point should be, though the equivalent of $5 to $10 in atoms seems fair for special point reset.
---
I had a server shut down mid-quest. It broke in weird ways when I came back.
---
U always gain cards tho 
---
Add me, same psn as reddit name. And I mean exact the same name. You can take a look on mine and I give you those you don't have for 10caps each. Sounds that good for you? :) 
---
1000% agree about more frequent weather.  Last night it rained and I stopped to appreciate how cool it was and how long it seemed since last time it rained in WV, at least for me :)
---
Love the Rad Storms, I remember how creepy it was the first time i saw one in FO4.
---
It's not it's in Welch and grafton I think
---
It's beautiful &lt;3
---
It's a MMO-lite 
---
Same. I absolutely loathe the bloodied meta
---
Do workshops. Free camp plans x2. 1 to take over and 1 to defend.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean
---
quest items don't have weight so it would kinda need to be a new system
---
&gt; I love me some shenanigans
---
As long as they'e cheeky and fun shenanigans and not cruel and tragic shenanigans
---
UHNV in Fallout NV was my favorite. It could be moved to any location.
---
should it not have a 40s/50s aesthetic?
---
I got "true storms" mod in FO4, even enables an option to spawn ghouls in a rad storm. Very cool!
---
I have a plan that involves a large number of Orbital Strike beacons, &amp; Nuke Mines.
---
The other key thing is to have no caps on you, so they can't collect a bounty, the point is to discourage them, and collecting a large bounty wouldn't help with that.
---
Plague Walker also has no innate negatives, besides the disease negatives.
---
if Ark and Rust aren't MMOs this isn't an MMO
---
You sure no one already came through there and picked it so you can't extract?
---
Know exactly what you're saying. I'd say at the moment I'm spec'd into Heavy Guns (namely explosive gatling gun), and explosives. Wanted to tack some bloodied stuff onto that, but alas they went and broke adrenal a week after I picked it up lol. So for the time being I'm just banking points until I see what all shakes out.
---
I had no interest in the brewing stuff before reading today's update. 
---
Now I do. A little something to break up the less enjoyable grinds is always welcome. And I actually like the idea that you only get one or two recipes a day, even if it means having to do a repeatable fetch quest or whatever. It seems very Fallout in the best sense of the word.
---
I only wonder how I'm going to make space for the equipment. There goes whatever was left of my CAMP budget.
---
I actually been using it so I can get a wire though for my Garage Door. (Since I want to only open it from the inside.)
---
Wrong. PvP min/max unfortunately requires no weight perks, no ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù perks. All combat perks required for max effectiveness in PvP
---
Yup, they are backwards.  The keypad should be on the outside wall and the power connection inside. That would give the resident the ability to keypad in, then use either a keypad pole, terminal, or pressure pad to get out. Right now because the keypad is inside I use the small lettering to put the key-code above my keypad. That works fine since its inside my building but if the wall are "corrected" then that may not be a secure option.  Not that I worry about folks getting into my camp, all they have to do is jump on my roof and use the stairs (LOL). I honestly could care less about folks getting into my camp, I just like the doors but the locks do keep animals out.  Now if we could get a cool "woosh" sounds when they operate so it's like the doors on the Enterprise, that would be cool.
---
or just get rid of slap damage and make pacifist truly pacifist, where you deal and take no damage
---
Chameleon comes in handy if you play sneaky sniper with no armor.  I use a bolstering lever action (or whichever it is where you get more damage with less DR) and just run with no armor at all.  It jacks my damage up by 50% I think (I didn‚Äôt do the exact math) and I still get the benefit of the invisibility I would otherwise have had to use armor for.  But that‚Äôs a pretty limited scenario; if I ever get a better legendary for main weapon I probably will stop using it and switch back to my legendary marine armor with chameleon on it.
---
I don't see how a meta exists in a fallout game. Yes it's mulitplayer and has PvP, why a person chooses to waste 9 or even 3 points on extra damage when you could choose some actual game changing perks instead
---
To point 4. You actually get XP, plans and other stuff when you take a workshop. There are also PVE defend the workshop waves that give more stuff when you complete them. PvP is the last thing on my mind if I take an unowned workshop. If someone wants to contest my workshop, I'd gladly hand it over because usually I'm elsewhere in the world doing other stuff after the initial claim.
---
well your wording implies chems aren't temp
---
So much this, that lovely fresh looking red paint offset buy broken teeth looking windows. Specially when the plain wood walls have windows in better condition.
---
I have several Vendor Characters with Camps near the Overseer's CAMP.
---
The Location works well as anyone can FT to V76, then get there for 2 caps.
---
Erm, how?.....
---
It's clearly possible, and yes i know its in game, increasing the frequency and or intensity isn't going to do the engine any favors in terms of performance for anyone. Priorities guy, priorities. More rain &lt; Stable game.
---
Sounds like a difference of opinion. Technically, class freak is a convenience perk since you can just chug serums to make sure the negative side effects are always suppressed. Depending on your build, some weight reduction perks may be required. Depending on your build, you might even have perk points to waste on whatever you feel like. This gets even more complicated when you talk about team PvP vs solo.
---
That‚Äôs very true ;-;
---
That‚Äôs my thought too
---
Most people just want to play and have fun, and not be dicks to each other. Since i started to max out my inventory i started to drop stimpacks and water for lower levels i run across. I help them and they help me clearing space. Personally PVP should be optional. I think Destiny 2 hit a very nice stride in how it handles, PVE, PVP and open world I wish FO76 was more like that. 
---
I get having a few perks for doing damage, but devoting almost all your perks just so you can kill someone more efficiently. 
---
Finalllllly able to brew stuff! Can live out by dream of being a free state moonshiner! Gonna make an lucky alcoholic shotgun build now
---
I don‚Äôt even see the point of knowing another player‚Äôs level at this point, besides the weapons and armor they may have equipped. Which is still somewhat meaningless. ie, a lvl 250 may only have a short hunting rifle with them. i just dont see what level # displaying actually achieves.
---
listen to the ingame music. The composer it pretty dope.
---
LOL well you sure got a goldüòÇüòÇ
---
This quest had a ton of bugs that I thought they fixed some of. You may need to put it in your STASH and then pick it back up. I will tell you from experience, do the entire thing from start to finish without stopping or the bugs just pile up and you can end up having to do it 4 times.
---
My previous reply stands relevant. If things like these are difficult to make at this point, the original code, the core of it is horribly written. 
---
I doubt this is something difficult though. And to take a step further back, there are loooooaaads of really minor things that could use some tweaking. Some things as small as literally changing a value here and there. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe they are completely incompetent, I really do just believe user requests are their lowest priority, looking back at all previous patches. (Refer to the threads posted by the dataminers, NOT the bethesda official change logs since they ‚Äòhide‚Äô a massive amount of changes)
---
Decontamination shower, fusion generator, and water purifiers are what I target first if I‚Äôm a wrecking homes.  However, if I don't see em, I typically don't knock down walls just to see if you have 'em.
---
It‚Äôs a senseless petty crime, but base destruction should never have been a thing.  But because Bethesda seems to want it, I‚Äôll oblige.
---
LMAO!!!!
---
That‚Äôs a misconception...   the stash box in your building is just like stash boxes at the train stations, the only goods you see are the ones owned by the player opening the stash box.
---
In other words, if I walked into your camp and opened the stash box that you built, I would only see the items that I put into my stash box.   
---
I don‚Äôt see your items and I can‚Äôt steal them.   The worst that I could do is destroy your base, but a locked door isn‚Äôt going to stop that.  
---
Short of lots of spawning enemies nearby that can open unlocked doors and wreck the base, there is no need to lock it.  I leave mine wide open.   
---
I was deep in the mire the other day and came across a player‚Äôs camp.  I thought ‚Äú great, now I can scrap and fix a few things‚Äù....  nope, locked up tighter than a drum...   I was sorely tempted to break in, but the bounty hassle just wasn‚Äôt worth it.  
---
If they ever fix the bounty system where you can pay it off, you better either leave your camp unlocked or have a guest area for scrapping, because it would be worth it for me just to break in....  especially if you have a camp that‚Äôs in the middle of the wilderness...
---
This will be great as long as they get rid of all the buggyness surrounding Daily Quests.
---
I had an old trading base design that's a bit finky to get right, but otherwise it's easy to customize and the people who came across it loved it. The general idea is fit as much as you can into a metal perimeter wall, while keeping a path big enough for a caravan to get through to the 2 exit towers, each with a garage door. When I was done I managed to fit in living quarters, a bar, a guard post\*outside of the two in the towers\*, electrical room, a outhouse, a farm, and a store. The problem is getting the perimeter walls to work right, but you can throw in a guard post to even out any large gaps. Give it a shot, they are pretty neat.
---
I‚Äôll do it for you.
---
Most guns, honestly. I went for a demo man build so I don't have other weapon proficiencies. That should mean that 4-5 hits becomes 7-8 hits or something like that, but instead it means '20-30 becomes 50-70' :(
---
My explosives do an okay job, but they are costly and have recently gotten nerfed pretty hard, not to mention two of the top tier grenades are bugged into uselessness.
---
\*shudders\* ugh... might as well just play minecraft with more junk and nukes. I think Bethesda did themselves, and most PVE players, a disservice by selling this game as PVE if you want but also PVP. Identity crisis.
---
Not true. You can't have a fully optimized build until you play with the cards. And some cards aren't released until the later levels. After that you might need to fine tune the SPECIAL and redistribute if it wasn't preplanned. Post lvl 50 is still developing character
---
Which you can still do in survival mode?  Why not let us who want to play coop PvE only have our own game mode too?
---
loved it!!!!!
---
I'd like it too but adding music involves licensing fees.  Spotify or streaming internet radio is the way to go.  I listen to UK 40s Radio Station and some others that play music from the same eras as the in-game songs.
---
Personally, as someone who uses a Sniper without VATS, if your aim is steady enough, which is easily achieavable with Sniper and Stabilized arm mods, it's way more accurate at taking out enemies than using VATS which still has a 5% at best chance to miss and is AP dependent; the only benefit of using VATS, are Crits which are guaranteed hits for more damage than you can get without VATS.
---
No, you learn those as part of the quest.
---
They specifically said the recipes are from one of the Dailies.
---
We need more Free State stuff in general.
---
Heavy gun builds should be the most OP if you ask me. Where‚Äôs the reward for blowing through so much dam ammo?! Heavy guns should be the front man of their team shredding everything in sight with the cost of having to replace ammo. Not to mention they are...you know...heavy frickin guns.
---
Hi,  can someone please copy paste the beth.net article for those of us at work who cant access that site?
---
please and thank you!
---
I finally broke down and bought it, and since then, in the last 5 turn ins of Data for ammo, Ive gotten 2 Initiate Paint Plans.
---
I‚Äôm tired of having guests over to see my kitchen shelf empty like some plebeian.
---
But seriously, I‚Äôd love to see them make like the Sims 4 and add a ‚Äúclutter‚Äù category.
---
They pretty much have one... it's called Whitespring Resort. It has all the tables, a stash box, and vendors. It has a zone you enter where you can be safe from enemies and nukes. All it doesn't have is a structured format and actual player vending (which I think it will have in the near-ish future). It's also where most people congregate on the map, due to the golf clubhouse and it's fairly easy loot and lvl'ing.
---
It doesn't have to be tied to PvP.  If you want to PvP, go play survival mode.  I'm just asking for a game mode for coop PvE players to enjoy the game in peace.
---
Wasn't it paint brushes? Or did both float?
---
&gt; just like temp Chems / Mutations?
---
Understandable how they got that initial impression with the way this line was worded.
---
Because those 9 points on rifleman are game changing
---
Perfect time to make bar CAMPs too!
---
That logic applies for people on their first character. You don't know what you're doing, so you d have to play around with a lot. But for an alt it means nothing. There's no telling if another character is playing an alt or their first character, so it really means nothing
---
Took me 2 days because crashes
---
Welcome back! Stability has improved from the ban hammers. Have you seen the new [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps)? Lots of stuff coming this year. I would help you out but I'm on PC. Stay safe!
---
Believe that is correct 
---
Honestly being able to manage my inventory and weight efficiently without needing a lot of reduction perks means I can take every damage perk possible. 
---
I would be the guy locked in the fridge at the beginning. Only I would lock myself in. 
---
It blows my mind that none of the higher tier walls (brick, warehouse, metal) do not have windows with shudders you can open and close. Maybe it's just me but 'secure' isn't allowing people to stare right into your base. Give us secure windows and not permanently open peepholes in our metal walls!
---
Oh hellllllz yeah I'm getting the gang SUPER DUPER wasted!
---
They really didn't know their audience very well - its clearly not working out for either side, the PvP players nor the PvE players are truly happy.  The current system only caters for the true griefers.
---
Cool.
---
I was excited for it before today. Now it just seems like something I'll never really bother using.
---
Ah well. 
---
Alcohol does hydrate, but it is also a diuretic which makes you expel fluids. There are many instances of people surviving without water and with only alcohol for quite a while because water was not available or unclean.
---
Will these new drinks work with Quack Surgeon?
---
Lol what a joke, this should have been included in the release. Just shows how incompetent this development team is, it takes them 4 months to release this garbage. I can almost guarantee that 99% of the people still playing this game will run this quest line once and never use anything from it again. IF it even works to begin with.
---
It's showing that it's still unsolved. Sorry.
---
exactly
---
That would be a nice way to finish the nuke off. Instead of just fading to clear, a radstorm washes it all away.
---
Amen brother! I'm down to 6,000 ultracite 5mm rounds, and I feel like I have to go into "conservation" mode lol. It's ridiculous. It's nothing to blow through 3k + rounds in a nuke zone. And that's after they slowed down the fire rate on the GG by not allowing the martial artist perk card to boost the crank speed. I was really spitting some lead then.
---
I didnt even realise there was weather conditions except rad storms 
---
what [Felicrux](https://www.reddit.com/user/Felicrux) said
---
It sounded like you meant "temporary versions of chems". You don't really need to specify "temp checks" since all chems are temporary, I guess. Not a big deal,though 
---
The camp disappears out from under them if you log off and they are in the base.  I‚Äôm not sure what happens if they are crafting at the time. 
---
Why is it such a big deal? People have found a way to level up, using the game the way it was made. This isn't a bug, it's just a way someone is playing the game that you don't like. That seems like something that people should tolerate, or at least ignore. 
---
What a mad lad!
---
Waaay cheaper and plentiful ammo and the damage difference is only 2points
---
Why is this downvoted. For anyone that's not soloing the game at a low level this shit will most likely be useless. 
---
Such a horrible opponent. They need to nerf it again.
---
Ok, point taken :-)
---
 Bullshit! You have been watching idiot youtubers.
---
 I have Morrowind on 2 OSs and 2 engines. its the best Elder Scrolls game so far. I have Skyrim and Oblivion.
---
 Yesterday I was doing an Enclave event. I don't usually do quests or events but I'm setting up my Perks at level 66 on this char. I have another 90 levels on 2 others. So I'm actually leveling, something I do rarely. So I'm doing one in Watoga, tag the dishes mainly, and a Scorchbeast shows up. I hunt them and finished my thing I was doing while shooting at her when I could. She fucks off east and I go in the Station to drop a little weight and take off after her. Another guy about level 48 is after her too but I can run so smoke past him. We get her to land and I kill her with my Shiskabab, he pours fire into her too. The second in the day for me. Go back to the Station and he's quite excited but no ears on. Turn on your fucking mikes everyone, so I can talk to you and you can hear an old man muttering as he kills stuff. Anyhoo we emote a bit and I take out most of my known plans and drop em'. He likes that and drops some acid I think. I grab it. And go do a Protect the Robots another Enclave event. I am at this point in my X0-1 with my Serrated Combat knife. Hulking monster with a tiny knife. Its ridiculously OP and I take out the several waves very quickly and my friend shows up just in time to complete. I get a level and more acid from him. He must n=be farming it.
---
 That was fun. I have these things happen all the time. I actually made a friend the other day and played the game as intended for a couple of hours. Otherwise I have soloed the game from cowering in a hols when her majesty shows up to actively hunting her. She runs a lot now. ;)
---
Thats a pretty neat idea, I would imagine the impact alone from a bomb that size being slammed into whatever would be ridiculous lmao
---
Oh. I guess I missed that
---
Overseers camp is a logical choice as it‚Äôs close enough to vault 76 so anyone can get there free from anywhere on the map.
---
Also building there means not needing a few crafting stations as they are in the overseers camp. 
---
Also since you cannot build close to another camp, the road in front of the overseers camp has many spots for would be traders.
---
And each time you smoke you have a slight chance of getting Cancer! It‚Äôs completely incurable and a countdown timer starts. It‚Äôs quite a long counter but still it‚Äôs always there, reminding you that one day you‚Äôll die. Maybe a years time in game, then Bethesda deletes your character.
---
This, I rarely listen to the radio anymore.
---
Yeah that sound fair I‚Äôll hit you up thanks man 
---
It would be cool if they added additional songs when they add new content.  Even it it was like 3-4 with each DLC.  Seems like there would be new music each calendar quarter or so.
---
However, someone hit the nail on the head earlier about licensing costs for adding music, it could be prohibitive.
---
I would rather see the investment in content and stability.  I'm sick of spending lots of time and ammo killing high level enemies for them to vanish once they hit the ground and I dont get to loot them. :(
---
1 alien and 3 aliens or lights or windows.
---
hard to know what the crazy guy was thinking/saw
---
Or turns PVP'ers into griefers. I feel the darkness pulling me in more every day.
---
West-tek is good but hard. Just go to whitespring. It's easy.
---
This is how we‚Äôve playing lately, the adventure just never stops
---
I wiped my mutations and took them again and it works perfectly, it even shows the positive effect which i believe most people are missing
---
There's a few builds I wanna try out. Currently I am a little bit of a meta player, because I have an Unyielding and Bloodied build, though things are still not optimal as I don't have Sentinel gear. This doesn't much matter to me because I'm not a min-maxer.
---
I have a swing-speed Vamp knife I wanna pair up with Vanguard gear to try out, and I'm gonna have to track down a solid Furious Minigun for a heavy weapons build I have. Before all of this I had an explosive shotgun build, it was pretty fun too
---
Overall I would say most builds are comparable to each other. I say this because after a certain point the damage dealt just becomes a dick measuring contest. What do actual points matter if you're one-hitting enemies anyway?
---
Keep all the batons you can find is my advice. They are light  and usually have interesting perks.
---
Yes, and it was a 3 star one that dropped a Vampiric Explosive 10mm submachine gun(great legendary effects on a garbage weapon).  Between the stagger and Rad damage it was a pain, but Colonel Gutsy is still far worse.
---
So all you do is Pacify? What‚Äôs Wasteland Whisperer for?
---
By the way, after I pacified a deathclaw it turned evil again while I was posing for pictures with it 
---
I tolerate it by destroying it. Just playing the game the way I want. What's the big deal?
---
I said something like this a discord group back in beta. There should be two hubs. One for social and for pvp. 
---
The social one could have high level sentrybots and other things to auto fire at anyone trying to fight and keep mobs from disturbing the players. 
---
The pvp one could have a laser grid to block players from leaving once they have entered combat with another. 
---
The zones could easily be moved around day to day or even week to week. 
---
The scripts and code are there in game. BGS doesn‚Äôt want to or feel to need to but a player made one would be nice. Having to resort to using reddit or other means to seek buyers and sellers it‚Äôs a little dry. 
---
have some guy buying all 3 stars legendary for 650 caps so not going lower than that sorry,i still have it but not low then 650
---
I've tried putting it in my STASH and removing it.  I'm not sure what you mean by "start to finish" since as far as I know, accessing the DMV terminal and trying to get the government ID *is* the start.  Is there a different start?
---
1. Don't carry tons of junk around on you. 
---
2. Check the 76 market. There are guys you can pay 500 caps to and they will either kill other players for you 3 times or provide body guard work for an hour or so.
---
3.work on ranking up and make your character tanky. That way you don't have to give up your hoard cards.
---
Correct. No sights or muzzles. 
---
I really hope that these are only a small, SMALL, **SMALL** sample of what we can brew. 
---
Raiders gonna raid.
---
Being that they gave a look into the distillery this week, why don't you wait a few weeks.
---
Got jumped by 6 of them last night with my buddy....FML. He had to kill a bunch of critters and one was on the list. He's only a lvl 10 (I'm at 70) so I'm playing bodyguard and we come across two lvl 20s and a 32 that beat the tar out of him but we kill them off. time to med and food up so we're both looking at our pip boys when WHAM, lvl 68 legendary and his two lvl 45 buddies. Effed us both up to death, re-spawn and go finish them off and get our junk bags back.
---
I'm Canadian but I am told its a good representation of real life with the DMV. ;)
---
Wouldn't you have to play for like 10 1/2 hours every day since the games release, I think its around 106 days ago, to reach 1100 hours in game. Jesus dude, either you didn't sleep for a couple days or you need some sunlight.
---
This is awesome. Wonder how a boxing ring would look with 4 half steel pillars connected with the wires of three stacked horizontal conduits.
---
See what I mean?
---
My money on Mr. Feral Hands
---
rain happens to me everyday Maybe you just don't notice?
---
Let‚Äôs repair a railroad to Vegas before Mr. House wakes up and starts that whole event in motion. 
---
Nukacrypt.com,  look at the bottom of the page for this weeks codes. Or follow the instructions on the page and decrypt it yourself.  It‚Äôs a chore, but worth doing at least once.
---
There are so many ways to play this game... there are exceptions for everything
---
plenty of "experienced players" dont want to truly do PvP - yet end up getting stuck in one of these encounters once in while anyways.....  
---
plenty of "experienced players " play much like in Fallout 3/4/NV  - whats PvP?? 
---
Plenty of "experienced players"  just arent that great at FPS  (me in particular)  and enjoy the easy nature of the FPS experience  that is fun, vs the FPS experience that can be / can get frustrating,  in others like Battlefield, etc....
---
There‚Äôs a great More where that came from Radio Mod for FO76. It adds at least 40 tracks, though it does have an annoying robot narrator
---
So you are admitting that nobody really wants PvP, and all the enthusiasts want is really to harass people who don't want it.
---
Trade the cap amount in bullets than give the remainder for free. I do this on an almost daily basis. 
---
Patrolman Sunglasses. ;)
---
about to add you mate.  Also I am micless :( 
---
If you're on PS4 I'll blindly run at your enemies attempting to kill them and if I succeed you can pay me caps for my ruthless assassination of your foes.
---
Maybe the Nuclear Winter in the upcoming season will have this?
---
I don‚Äôt think so either 
---
Someone datamined his name....its Xur
---
Same here.  Just started back on Monday,  I was sick of server crashes,  not once since.  
---
I, personally, am one of the Glass Cannon, Two-handed melee, Power Armor wielders. At level 54 now, when at or below 20% health, I'm regularly swinging with 1,000+ damage, and I haven't even maxed out the slugger perks, or found a Bloodied Legendary yet. For me, it's just damn fun being able to one-shot most enemies. I haven't actually tried any PvP. I would like to, but don't want to be a jerk by inflicting it on people who aren't interested in it.
---
I don't feel like everyone should have to play this way of course, and in fact, one of my favorite 76 random stranger encounters was when I ran into a crafter character, very much not built around dealing damage. We ended up teaming up and going into a nuke zone, where I effectively played bodyguard while he scavenged for materials, and at the end he thanked me by modding one of my power armor pieces. 
---
In my opinion, the game works best when people specialize, being tanks, healers, crafters, what have you, and we group up to make up for one another's short comings.
---
 I do Enclave events as they are about 1/4 level and take little time. With my new focus on daggers I spend no ammo either. ;)
---
There are spoilers at this link but has some bug fix comments in it also:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43635/~/recruitment-blues-quest---fallout-76
---
Once you start the quest by accessing the terminal, do not stop mid-quest - this is where additional bugs can happen (and make you start over). You need to get to the point where you are done with the DMV section and get the ‚Äúcheckpointed‚Äù message to show on-screen.
---
The electric chairs are a good start, but we need more creepy stuff for sure. Some of the raider camps have great stuff, like the cages and heads on stakes. Now, maybe it's a little morbid, but not everyone wants their camp to look like Disney or Las Vegas.
---
sigh...blocked at work.
---
Thank you. Hahahaha.
---
I‚Äôd also like to see some custom things built off of excavator and/or raider. 
---
Making it an option is not removing it. take away slap damage and camp damage when in pacifist mode. Done, problem solved. PvP still exists, and if you don't want it, you are immune to it. 
---
To minimize the griefing, make the toggle have a timer. Once you go P, it won't disable for a half hour after you toggle it off. This works very well in other MMO to keep people from switching to harass then going immune again.
---
I did this quest ages ago and remember thinking they really captured the essence of the DMV.
---
For instance, did you know that when you fonto get your Real ID, you can't use the mailer Sthey mailed to you as a reminder to get your ID upgraded and/or renewed as proof of address?
---
They mailed you something specifically dealing with Real ID and you have to bring in mail sent by someone else. Classic bureocracy. 
---
I have a question. If a level 100 and only have 50 caps what happens if I get killed in pvp? I haven't pt that much time into the game so I'm only at lvl 30 right now. 
---
I never said that. That's some serious reaching but if you made a PVE Mode where the only way to engage PVP is through workshops then most players would avoid then so as not to have to PVP. There are a lot of people who enjoy legit, organic PVP. Myself included but finding people who are willing to do that and arent using exploits to make themselves is hard to find. 
---
That sounds pretty interesting. That would be cool to have snow or Radiation Snow. Haha.
---
It's up now
---
I actually like the dynamic here. If the game allows them to do that, I think they should be allowed to, but there is a risk. The risk of you, and myself, destroying their base on sight. I think the current risk/reward is worth it.
---
This is precisely why I have none at my base.  Useless. 
---
After fixing a decon shower for the 5th time you start locking your doors.
---
The cancer cells were duping. It was for the greater good. 
---
If the sky is clear all the time and there is no different weather then they should make it more Frequent with different weathers.
---
Because tolerating means leaving it alone. His way of playing the game doesn't affect you, but you destroying his camp certainly affects him. Kinda seems like a dick move to me, but you're gonna do what you're gonna do I guess. 
---
No
---
That would be interesting.
---
Last night I was trolling a group in a nuke zone white springs. 
---
They like shadowed me and kept taking all the kills, so I got in the way of their bullets and proceeded to kill them repeatedly over the space of an hour till they left the server.
---
Made over 1000 caps. Lol
---
**INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì WILD APPALACHIA PREVIEW: BREWING AND DISTILLING**
---
Welcome back to Inside the Vault! Last week, we revealed our 2019 Roadmap, which included a high-level look at new quests, events, game modes, features, and more coming to Fallout 76 this year. In case you haven‚Äôt had a chance to see the roadmap just yet, you can head here to check it out.
---
As we start moving down the road toward our next patch, we‚Äôre ready to share more details on what‚Äôs coming in Wild Appalachia this March‚Äîstarting with a crash course on the all-new Brewing and Distilling crafting system! Grab a glass and start reading below...
---
**NEW QUEST: WASTED ON NUKASHINE**
---
Your path to becoming the Wasteland‚Äôs premiere bartender will begin near Vault-Tec University. There you will relive the glory days of VTU‚Äôs finest and discover the mischief they got up to outside of the classroom. Your continued studies will lead you to a notorious speakeasy, introduce you to Biv‚ÄîAppalachia‚Äôs tipsiest robot, and teach you to craft the illicit Nukashine using the all-new Brewing Station.
---
**NEW CRAFTING SYSTEM: BREWING AND DISTILLING**
---
The Brewing Station is a workbench that you‚Äôll learn to construct during the ‚ÄòWasted on Nukashine‚Äô quest. This crafting station can be placed in your C.A.M.P. and is used to create a variety of adult beverages, including beers, cocktails, wines, and spirits. Be mindful of the refreshments you toss back: while each will impart you with a temporary buff, they also each bring a drawback and, just like real life, will result in a mild hangover.
---
Some drinks, such as wines and spirits, require additional fermentation time before they‚Äôre ready to be served at your next shindig, and their effects will become even more potent the longer you allow them to ferment. During ‚ÄòWasted on Nukashine‚Äô, you‚Äôll also learn to craft the Fermenter. Build one of these in your C.A.M.P. and place drinks within to reduce the wait time needed to try your latest creations.
---
Here‚Äôs a flight of drink selections to give you just a taste of what you‚Äôll be able to brew up with this new crafting system (there are many more to discover!):
---
**WINES AND SPIRITS**
---
Wines and Spirits require some fermentation time to take advantage of their full effects as a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù beverage. Let them age long enough, and they will change from ‚Äúfresh‚Äù to ‚Äúvintage‚Äù, and gain additional, more powerful effects. Here‚Äôs a look at a blazing spirit known as Firecracker Whiskey:
---
* Fresh Effect: Your melee attacks will result in self-immolation, damaging both you and your attackers.
---
* Vintage Effect: In addition to its fresh effects, Firecracker Whiskey will set enemies on fire from your ballistic and melee attacks.
---
**BEERS**
---
Beers require fermentation, but they are best served fresh and do not have a vintage state. Become the ultimate predator with an ice-cold glass of Hoppy Hunter:
---
* Fresh Effects: Increased scope stability and damage versus animals, but reduced VATS accuracy.
---
**MIXED DRINKS**
---
Mixed drinks do not require fermentation and their effects do not change. Gulp down a Tick Blood Tequila Sunrise to sate your appetite:
---
* Effects: Your successful melee attacks have a chance to inflict you with a disease but may also refill your hunger meter.
---
Those of you looking to add these and other drinks to your mixology repertoire can quench your continuing thirst for knowledge by regularly returning to Biv. Each day you speak with Biv, you‚Äôll receive one of two new repeatable daily quests at random. The first will teach you new Brewing and Distilling recipes every time you complete it, and the second will put your taste buds to the test as you experiment with the dubious effects of various drinks. Get ready for a long night.
---
We hope you‚Äôve enjoyed taking a sip of the Brewing and Distilling system this week. Looking ahead, we‚Äôre planning to serve up even more options in future updates that will help you add a little more ‚Äúpunch‚Äù to every party you throw. Keep an eye out for more details over the coming weeks.
---
Oh, and before you go, do be sure to consume Nukashine responsibly‚Äîit may make you feel like taking on the world, but you just never know where those Nuka-fueled adventures may lead.
---
No need to apologize :) 
---
Sure thing. Go ahead and explain the method I use to play co-op mode in FO4 with my family. I somehow missed it when I played it before.
---
I have noticed a few rain storms and afterward its mostly clear sky all the time.
---
First one's a little tough, as my stash is already full, but I understand the weight and concision of this advice.
---
Second is an interesting proposition, albeit not quite what I was expecting. It's a good reactionary measure, but not a solution to the problem.
---
I'm currently level 71 with a focus on STR, INT, and LCK, toting lvl 45 Excavator Armor. Not the best defense, but I'm not sure even an ironclad build could be protected from the shear devastating force of these attacks.
---
I'm most interested to know if this is a common problem, and that there's any advice to be given suggests that it's common enough, which is tragic.
---
So much for unprovoked PVP protection
---
I appreciate the advice. If it happens again, maybe a bodyguard is in order, even if it shouldn't be
---
Same. Although the roadmap has me excited overall, the brewing for mild, temporary buffs does not interest me.
---
Next person that says shenanigans is get pistol whipped. 
---
Once you've used a game genie to get all of the best weapons and armor in the game there isn't anything left to do other than attack people who aren't using a game genie.
---
There is. But it's a rare chance for the weather to change.
---
I have to wonder if the Nuclear update will have that.
---
No you didn't , and lets see you bring better ideas to the table ..
---
Please tell me we are going to be able to make nuka colas now. I've had a horde of sugar, honey, and nuclear material since I first came across the nuka plant.
---
 I delight in selling them to vendors. I sold All Rise to the Watoga Station bot for 19 caps. ;)
---
Hahaha! It would be nice to have more variety of storms in Fallout 76 but this time being wide spread.
---
At this point you're just telling people that their preferred play style is bad and yours is good. 
---
Some people enjoy maximizing their damage output. Collecting gear and tweaking specs to get a little extra damage out of their build is how they enjoy the game. You may not find the same enjoyment in this aspect of play, but it doesn't make them stupid or wrong.
---
Just remember you can't have pacify mode on if you want to destroy turrets, not sure this was the issue. You have to turn pacify mode off.
---
Me motherfucker, I‚Äôm a server sheriff. I‚Äôll take any bounty, I‚Äôll spend 50 caps to get 10. If you‚Äôre on Xbox DM me I‚Äôll add you and just message if there‚Äôs bounty‚Äôs needed collecting :3
---
Geez... How negative.  This is not constructive.  I'm sure the dev team is working frantically at improving the experience for everyone.  And you can't have it both ways, if they added/rushed this feature at launch, there would have been a risk of even more bugs at launch. 
---
That's my worry, they seem (from what info we have),  that these are for lower level ppl, which is cool, just hope theres stuff useful for end game players too. 
---
PC I'm afraid, but I appreciate the offer
---
Do you happen to know if this happens frequently? How are players able to kill other players without prompt or consequence?
---
But his way of playing does affect me. I've explained why a couple of times. He puts his base there, it annoys me and potentially robs me of loot. Therefore, I destroy it. Currently there is no official rule preventing the base from being placed there. That's fine with me, but I am well within my right to destroy that base if I want to, and when my loot is in danger I want to and will destroy said base.
---
It's possible to stabilize the game with a few kinds of weather taking place in different parts of the map and it doesn't take forever to load weather either. The weather is more like a KB rather than an MB if you know what I mean.
---
I'm not sure. I'm trying to criticize constructively, but so many people can't handle that I guess. I like this game.. that's why I'm here.
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Compare the general content you're seeing in 76 to your average MMO or MMO-lite.
---
Then do the same with ark and rust. See a difference? 
---
All I see is a picture of you getting quest rewards, I apologize. 
---
Haha. Thank you.
---
If you have to seek them out to initiate the situation it isn't griefing. Griefing is someone relentlessly pursuing you and not letting you play or enjoy the game. Like locking someone up in jail in Ark and feeding them narcotics for 4 days so they can't play at all. Or spawn ganking someone in WoW over and over until they log off. 
---
Engaging in legitimate gameplay certainly is not griefing regardless of the odds against you or how much of a jerk the enemy is. Just because you're at a disadvantage does not make it griefing. The whole story sounds like it was awesome so I don't see where the grief even comes into question. 
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know this. Thank you. 
---
AFAIK from playing FO4 last night, we have broken/pristine warehouse glass ceilings but not the walls. Bummed me out making my greenhouse last night in Sanctuary.
---
Get Spotify premium, search for a Fallout playlist, generate a radio station from said playlist, enjoy more Fallout music than Bethesda could ever license.
---
I went to the real dmv recently, felt like I was doing the quest all over again.
---
DayZ has, if nothing else, given me a much more cynical view of post-apocalypse survival.
---
xD maybe a little bit? But mostly it was so fun to hang with all y‚Äôall!! Yay, I‚Äôll keep my eye out (: can‚Äôt wait!
---
Maybe..
---
Hahaha, I deeply enjoy the enthusiasm, but alas, I am on PC.
---
Also, there is no Bounty. These players players simply execute without prompt or consequence, and I don't fully understand how this is possible.
---
Best guess is that even with the damage reduction, they're dealing enough damage to kill, and because they do it in one shot, never accrue a bounty, which is deeply unsettling
---
Make an alt character and dump a bunch of stuff in a container and have a friend chill there for you until you pick it back up. Basically an extra 800 lbs of stash for you.
---
No need to be upset, your idea was bad and people were being polite by not saying anything. I don't need to bring any ideas to the table, that wasn't the intent of your post. Just chalk this up as a loss and move on.
---
Contesting workshops is not griefing. It's one of the few parts of the game specifically designed around PvP. If you take a workshop you're opening yourself up to possibly being killed. It is what it is. If you don't like it, don't take workshops.
---
Click on the photo and get a closer view of the rewards and you'll see that I just got The Clean Army Fatigue on top.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs ridiculous. And half the time not even killing her after they nerfed TSEs into oblivion. Imagine if the duper‚Äôs Haden‚Äôs been around. She‚Äôd be unbeatable. Bunch of people down there wasting hundreds of thousands of rounds shooting her with stalkers and mutant slayer weapons because the RNG drops are so horrible lol. I have a ton of fun with the game and I try not to give bathesda too much crap because it‚Äôs their first online game and it really is a lot of fun but man do they still have a lot of work ahead of them.
---
I, too, want more songs. This is a track list for a Fallout tabletop RPG campaign I was writing for my local group a while back that was set in the Rockies and had a strong anti-war bent:
---

If you have a digital copy, you can share they copy for free on XB1 and PS4. Even a 2nd copy of Xbox Live is included for free if the xboxes are in the same house. I play on 2 xboxes myself and have 10 characters, so many useful things I can do with multiple characters.
---
Truer words were never spoken
---
Any thoughts on how they're able to get away with it without prompt or consequence (no Bounty before or after?)
---
I think it's more like trying to convince your friends to buy a bad videogame 
---
I keep all 2**+ ones and either sell/trade then here or let them get dusty. I drop my 1* ones in the river my my camp or if I‚Äôm at Whitesprings, I‚Äôll drop them in the cash register at one of the lower lobby shops, which is really the functional equivalent of dropping them in the river if no one notices.  Not hoarding anything for DLC. Storage space is a hot commodity. 
---
I think they should add this as a mod to the broadsider. 
---
Then play a different game because the current game doesn‚Äôt satisfy your needs. 
---
From what I have tested the main advantage of the chameleon armor set is in PvP.  Not sure if you are a sniper build, but while crouched and cloaked from view, firing your weapon does not bring you out of stealth.
---
The mutation seems to work well in PvE along with sneak and escape artist.
---
Definitely get the mutation, as it has no real down side, and if your chameleon armor breaks, you still have some camouflage ability with the mutation alone.  But I too gave up using the weightless armor set.
---
What kind of turrets were they?
---
Also, a lot of times, the regular machine gun turrets work pretty well to defend against PVE hoards. Some people may not be concerned about using them for PvP.
---
I've read that when you place the door, if you place it *between* 2 foundations, you can place the door in either orientation (though it's finicky even then).
---
don't forget to put a pressure plate on the other side so you can use the door both ways!
---
Yup. Those are posts of mine. They are saying the same thing. You don‚Äôt get to call people who play a game within the rules of the game a troll. You guys are sad. 
---
The main post said nothing about what you mentioned. With that said, having an actual pacifist mode with no slap and camp damage would be nice. That'd add to the game, unlike OP's suggestion.
---
Well when I was a low player I‚Äôd lock all my stuff and the last time I had my stuff locked I had 2 issues with people threatening to destroy my stuff just purely because I wouldn‚Äôt let him in. And then the other time a guy (level 4) started hitting me because of the lock and once I opens my door he had his level 95 friend to come over and go into my house and start destroying stuff so yeah. And if you‚Äôre dying like that and you run by a camp that‚Äôs locked it‚Äôs not that persons problem you are dying. So destroying peoples hard work over your own issues is pathetic. It‚Äôs not my job to help out others. And I sure won‚Äôt if that‚Äôs the kind of mentality someone has. 
---
Like you read my mind. Was thinking about this just this morning. That and a way to quickly toggle it on and off. Going into the menus is just not conducive to surviving an encounter where the other person is actively out to get you. 
---
Ah yes, we've done this a few times already (although he normally just holds onto it encumbered).
---
Problem is that these attacks happen within mere second and it's near-impossible to predict where from.
---
Even if I had my buddy with me, as has happened before, they just kill us both before we're even aware or capable of responding (not that we can, none of the players in the exchange have any bounty)
---
Exactly. But no, everyone has a problem with it. People just want to bitch. 
---
" No one could have believed that in the last years of the nineteenth century Human affairs were being watched by minds immeasurably superior from the depths of the ground where we have studied you like creatures under a microscope, slowly but surely we will draw our plans for a better Mankind " #%(#'?'#%%..... [ Data Corrupt ] ...
---
I was just about to ask the same question. Did you find any more?
---
I‚Äôm hoarding it all on my mules. I have one filled up completely, but I still have more farming to do.
---
but ok if you can offer 300 caps now it is yours
---
As someone who likes to play as a stand alone player, I feel like there should be better options for stand alone play, hence multiple armaments. Thought reddit might help, forgot it's full of children sorry. Go have a juice box and a nap and come back when you're nicer lol
---
Real good that even bad UI that the community manager notices the first week doesn't get fixed 
---
Yeah, it was solved at like 4 AM this morning, I didnt have a chance to update it till I woke up lmao.
---
I'd say on Xbox that Mixer si a decent service and when you get good moments like this then you can capture them from your stream. Only downside it doesn't seem to record other peoples voices in the world from what I can tell, it will do it for xbox chat but not in game mic.
---
It is assumed, yes.
---
I see many people complain about the caps, ammo, and medical perks not working and then find out they are doing it wrong.
---
It is not clear how it works. A new dialogue appears on the loot box, but it is very easy to overlook.
---
Alter the game to my liking! Screw everyone else, I'm the vocal reddit minority!!
---
Physical unfortunately 
---
Please, I would love if the team could fix the gatling gun‚Äôs sight ): it is just so cool and for it not to be of any use is just so disheartening to me
---
You can't fast travel in a nuke zone... And no, player hub won't stop legendary ghoul farming.
---
The map is so freaking huge. Plenty of spots to chose from.
---
GOD I hope so!
---
The Nuka-brewing in Nuka-World was so good!
---
I hope they add Brewing Stations around the map. Especially one at the Soda Fountain in the Whitesprings if we do get Nuka-drinks!
---
It‚Äôs not unsuspecting when you get a notification. Y‚Äôall are crazy. If I claim a workshop, it‚Äôs my business what I do with it. Take it back from me. I die a lot too when I go after workshops. 
---
Nice. New quest line. New dailies. New CAMP stuff. INCENDIARY BULLETS ON ALL GUNS. :0 And it's all a free update.
---
Well done Bethesda. Hate on this post is proof of how hard people want to shit on this game.
---
If they announced it then they already have a general concept of how it‚Äôs going to work. 
---
I‚Äôm curious what that concept is and if there are certain things they haven‚Äôt considered. 
---
Especially since they don‚Äôt seem to think things through (for a lack of better words) when implementing new things. 
---
Now this is something I'd love, I remember playing a lot of Quake3 maps designed to give the impression of being shrunk. Imagine if the Enclave needed you to infiltrate a base as a micro power armour agent, that'd be freaking cool.
---
If I own the workshop, I get to do what I want with it. Take it back if you want it back. 
---
I was thinking this earlier, couldn't even remember the last lock up or crash I had. Then I logged in on my ps4 and had an immediate blue screen haha sods law! 
---
 So yeah aside from the I tempted fate with. The game has been running great for me recently.
---
The military ID cannot be obtained before the quest recruitment blues for the Brotherhood of Steel.  So if you just run to camp McClintock straight out of vault 76 and do basic training, no point in going to the DMV.
---
Likewise, if you just wanted to start launching nukes as fast as possible and went straight for the enclave, they send you to Camp McClintock to do basic training, but again you can do nothing until Recruitment Blues .
---
As I stated, wait a week or two for the ITVs
---
I am 135 and have never been attacked by a player before. I see these stories and can‚Äôt help wonder if not being attacker is normal or not.
---
I only listen to the composers music..ocassinally I like the classic station..nothing else..but I can't stand the music on the title screen or any of the music played inside the resort..I mute my tv
---
I would also like to know this. 
---
I was recently gifted a lvl 28 missile turret. It always takes out the lower level super mutants before they get to my camp. My (also gifted) heavy machine gun turret takes out stuff as well. And my regular turret sitting on a foundation block does pretty well with taking out mole rats. The regular turrets also had no problem with robots or scorched. For me, their efficacy had depended on where my camp was located an the types of enemies. Those blood bugs or whatever always took out my turrets. I had to move my camp.
---
yeah, man, it seems like you saw somebody who did something a little cheesy and because he took something that you wanted (in this case, exp at the whitespring), that means that he's affecting you. That's not how it works in games or in life man. If someone has a better resume than me, I'm not gonna burn his house down because I didn't get the job. This dude just wanted to get some easy kills, and you destroyed his base? Disagree with him all you want, but the moment you destroyed somebody's property, you violated his rights in a way that he had NEVER done to you. Just seems kinda petty, and mean, and now you're getting patted on the back? Idk, I don't buy it. Just my point of view. 
---
Well, there's always build utility. For people that use Plague Walker, a drink that gives you a disease OR fills hunger is a win-win.
---
Man, if you were on PC I‚Äôd make a T-51 jet pack and shocks just for that sack hood 
---
Its funny you say this, I love the radio feature in game but I agree, after 125 hours now I cant bring myself to listen anymore. Also when I am battling the scorch beasts "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition" is just not an inspiring enough song for me. I would rather hear some dio "last in line" or Ozzy while I am smashing things and blowing stuff up. I always thought it would be cool to load my own sound track or playlist into game. 
---
Yeah I'm way too nice if someone waved at me I will give them a marine wetsuit lol
---
I love this so much, its so true
---
Spotify has a fallout 76 Playlist with almost 200 songs but most arnt great but there's a few worth listening to. Add em to private Playlist and boom new radio
---
Players also defend trade scamming as "that's what a Raider would do" and "the game allows it, so it must have been intended"
---
Shit players gonna be shit players. Just block them and move on with life.
---
I like where they‚Äôre taking the brewing system. I may just have to open up a few B.A.R.S. now
---
Beverage &amp; Alcohol Refreshment Stations
---
If they come out with a variety of beverages with unique effects this could be really good.  I hope they have boozes that pair well with different legendary weapons and armor as well as different mutations. The firecracker whisky for instance would seem to pair well with vampire weapons. 
---
Fifth Rule of Fight Club, if this is your fist night you have to bring cake for all 
---
I found 1 northwest of the farm.
---
It‚Äôs PART OF THE GAME. They built it that way. Don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game. You guys are ridiculous. It‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic game. Seriously, engage in a normal conversation, what do you actually expect from an online game within a post-apocalyptic world filled with enemies. Why even have weapons or other enemies? 
---
Thank you sir. Now I just have to find the flux!
---
Aww well if any new players need help with raiders reading this the offer is good to anyone.
---
The best advice I could give is to make a smaller base and get them to attack you inside your base so they‚Äôre forced a bounty for causing damage to your building. And small bases are cheaper to fix.
---
Also always store your junk in your stash any chance you get after bulking them. Take Junk &gt; Everything else in your stash. You‚Äôll be going through many weapons and armor leveling from 1 - 50.
---
Haven‚Äôt played much after killing the queen for the 100th time and doing all the quests but I‚Äôm always down to help and collect bountys. I still never get over walking up to a lvl 200+ as a lvl 80 and one shotting them that never gets old xD
---
Also get Adamantium Skeleton 3 star ASAP. It‚Äôs completely broken early and late game. You no longer take ANY limb damage which is also nice for saving stims early game too
---
Done and done!
---
The easiest way to do this is find somewhere with a container. Preferably one that has a 1/0 ratio because you can put infinite stuff in it. Build your camp near that container so your buddy can take it all and dump it in his personal stash if someone comes up on him before you return. Having cloaking armor or stealth boys help as well.
---
I'd love a matching railing to the steps to put up instead of the wood defense one 
---
Oh there are plenty of azzhats in the game too...Dont fool yourself....I do appreciate our nice players though, thank you! I try to be kind, until it is time to not be kind any longer...
---
Already made space for the new brewery workbench, can't wait!
---
Did I just read that the quests are repeatable?!?!?! 
---
Events, like all the other posts say, will push up the x. Seeing as you like whitesprings you could head over to Blackwater mine and clear out the mole miners for exp and loot
---
B-but I want them to remove PVP cause someone killed me and I lost 32 caps!! It's not my fault I engaged in PVP!
---
Played many many hours of the game.  Pretty sure I've spent most of it in Flatwoods.  Ideal spot.
---
&gt; I'm not sure why we need junk insurance. Just keep all of your junk in your stash, especially if you own a workshop.
---
Seriously. The very first thing I do after claiming a workshop is plop down a stash box and drop my junk. Then I throw down a chemistry bench (lowest resource cost) so that as I play through the defense mission I can scrap and drop along the way. 
---
Want to sneak in and kill me with your chameleon sniper character? Oh well, you might get 135 caps off me, but at least you're not getting my junk.
---
Turrets are only good to take out enemies.  And they are even poor at that job.   I‚Äôve seen enemies crawling all over a new turret and it not even firing.   
---
If you set up a kill zone using blocked doors or build a concrete kill corridor, then they function better.   But yes, they need to be spread out a bit, with differing heights and overlapping fire and be protected from behind.  
---
For defending PVP we need to be able to build one or two shot explosive heavy turrets.  I‚Äôve run across this variant in Harper Ferry outside the big building (church?) once I got over level 60 or so.  
---
Maybe add the plans in a DLC...
---
I think there was a change recently where if you pick up someone‚Äôs bag of junk and they are not in your group it flags you for PVP and enables damage from you even if your pacifist is enabled.  So, you would really need to pay attention. 
---
Honestly the fix would be for the game to make your crosshairs RED when you will damage your target regardless of your pacifist setting.
---
I too would like top know the flare guns secret
---
lmao, Suprise muddaf!@ka!
---
But that's boring... Who can kill the most bots in a set amount of time...
---
Actually, you can have 56 perks active. So rejoice! 
---
Strange, don't think I've seen anyone ever asking for this.
---
I'm on xb1 also n always trying to find people to farm sbq. Because all my friends quit the game long ago
---
Will blocking them prevent them from killing me?
---
Oh they updated it ? 
---
Tick Blood Tequila Sunrise to sate your appetite:
---
Effects: Your successful melee attacks have a chance to inflict you with a disease but may also refill your hunger meter.
---
I don't see myself making this one. Food is not rare. Why would I risk a chance of getting a disease everytime I hit somthing. The con really outweighs the pro on this one I think.
---
No, but tried to kill, rob or otherwise assault exactly zero of them.
---
I‚Äôd love to see an idea for ‚Äúdecks‚Äù. Pre-select cards for specific roles. And have the option to change whole decks when not in combat. Have a build that‚Äôs for crafting. Boom switch, how about hacking or lock picking? 
---
Add a internal timer to slow down the swap times and golden. 
---
It fooking is.  Right down to the packs of feral ghouls wandering in to ruin everything.  That place is a real life raid spot, and your only weapon is patience.
---
Another thing PvE players often don't understand is that fighting for workshops is an intended feature, not griefing.
---
They can last a long time, but using VATS uses up a shit ton of their energy
---
A simple fix is making a fast travel point inside the resort... The map is huge but no other place has that many workbenches and stashs all in one room.
---
I did some trading last night for the first time and was worried the entire time. He was a level 147 and I was 80+. I offered my stuff up first accepting the fact I may lose out but in the end it all worked out great and actually stayed in a team for a while. Very nice fella. Hope to play again 
---
Some time ago I played with two friends and we killed a legendary enemy, who dropped a lvl10 explosive revolver for me. My two friends  got some legendary armor instead and both were really interested in the revolver, once I told them what I had gotten. I was playing melee back then. So the revolver was no interest to me. The problem was, that both of them wanted it, so I moved my camp, built a small arena in it and told them, that they have to fight for it. They fought 3 rounds with their fists and one of them won 3:0. I had a lot of fun watching them fight in my arena. 
---
No it's always been 56. You start with 7 SPECIAL stats then get to choose 49 SPECIAL stats from level 2 to 50.
---
Haven‚Äôt though of that it would be good 
---
Good for rp purposes. Not so great for legit playing purposes. Can't tell me everyone won't be building bars in their camps on Tuesday though lol.
---
Or I can just discuss what I‚Äôd like to see in the vending system compared to what others would like to see compared to how Bethesda currently sees it all playing out and enjoy a guild discussion or a slew of good suggestions 
---
They just need to make the fast travel point inside the resort and allow you to use it regardless of a nuke. And make it free, the same as vault 76.
---
I like top of the world too.
---
&gt;shows no interest in fixing it.
---
Jesus Christ. It's been one fucking week. They're not paying to rush a hotfix through console cert just to fix a single fucking mutation so you impatient fuckers don't have to suffer through a whole two weeks of sheer agony the likes of which no one on earth has ever felt before. 
---
Not only is this a great idea but it should make the bots hostile to the owner.
---
I get your point, but with how incredibly powerful crit attacks are in PvP, you don't PvP strictly like a traditional FPS. It's a built in aim bot and it's the only way to actually deal damage to some builds
---
Yea. They also thought tse where broken. All you had to do was build anti explosives and get that mutation that lowers ballistic damage and they effectively counter it.now melee builds rain supreme again lol
---
The wendigo was terrible, and hard to kill for me. (I was lower level over it.)
---
My worst one was the Mystical Flatwoods Monster because it didn't give up. I ran across literally half the map before a level 70 killed it for me. It was horrible running, stopping and seeing it just pop in behind me. 
---
Bogo ammo sells are amazing.  You sell 5000 5mm ammo for buy one get one, sell 2500 for 1 cap each then the other 2500 for 0 caps each.  People be happy with that lol
---
Was it diseased by any chance?
---
That modifier is confirmed to cover up stars + legendary nams.
---
Some people absolutely cannot handle criticism here, regardless as to whether it's constructive or not. Wish they would head over to filthycasuals cause it's ok to play a game and at the same time acknowledge that things could and should be better.
---
I have a similar opinion regarding weightless armor and weapons with 90% reduced weight 
---
Right, what I meant was more that it would be great to be able to choose perks until level 75 after what you hit the limit or to be able to equip 75 perks in total before you need to switch 
---
The level 100 loses 50 caps, the person that killed him gets 50, and the level 100 gets a damage debuff to other players that lasts for hours. Some builds this debuff means nothing so they purposely play without caps all the time.
---
When you claim a workshop, you get a warning that PVP may occur if other players want to take it over... Don't claim workshops if you're not ready to deal with potential PVP.
---
I think they are grayed out to let you know that they can‚Äôt be active in the area you are in. I‚Äôm working in Watoga and every time I enter ash heap I get notifications for the games down in Camden park. But only in that area. 
---
Could be wrong but that‚Äôs what I noticed. 
---
Two friends and I bought the game to play together, and they haven‚Äôt played it since about a week after launch. No matter what I can‚Äôt get them to play with me as they just continue to see how bad the game is and think that there is nothing to do.
---
Pretty sure I got mine in Lewisburg
---
Just curious - why 65 in particular, and not 50? Isn‚Äôt that when the SPECIAL stats are maxed?
---
I have no idea what you're on about now. Have a good one.
---
It sounds like you WILL learn one recipe to me, not a chance. 
---
Still not awesome, but at least the RNG isn't so strong as you fear, unless I'm reading it wrong.
---
Seems like you‚Äôd enjoy orbital strike beacons üòè
---
76*
---
Oh ok, I was not fully caffeinated ..lol
---
"High level" enemies are really not a big issue. My level 35 melee alt easily handled a level 91 deathclaw ambush with bog-standard raider PA and a one star war drum.
---
Yes
---
Yesssss.  Feel the hate flow through you.....
---
Need adrenal reaction mutation. It goes in and out due to the last patch but when it decides to work it will benefit you greatly.
---
You‚Äôve both missed the point, yes that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done, but why have the extra risk when a system can be in place to not have to drop anything 
---
I find there's only a few legendaries that are worth keeping, I sell the rest.
---
Will there be a bug patch that comes along with this as well? I'm assuming so, but just curious.
---
But I agree. I would love for an update at some point. Even an extra 10 would be amazing. But I think the new Legendary system will happen first, we'll have to wait and see what that is all about. 
---
Just watched a YouTube video of a guy who did this! Funny video actually 
---
It would help. I‚Äôm spec‚Äôd as a marksman with a lever action. So having to drop quick hands every time I want to use super duper when crafting is a handicap. But I can see why BGS would make the system they have in place. Mostly to ramp up the challenge of always be ready for a fight. 
---
S... secret use? 
---
5 characters, 5 thematic builds. All of them are a mix of form and function. I‚Äôm somewhat of a bottom-feeding optimizer ... I don‚Äôt want to gimp, but will do some things within reason. Generally speaking on PA users I will try to have some in Thru Hiker / Traveling Pharmacy as I can‚Äôt reduce those weight w/ armor (and calibrated kinda works like pockets). 
---
Some general things I do ...
---
I may have a few points extra in INT (say I do 7 or 8 for Gunsmith and 2 more somewhere else) and depending on how I feel or that build, swap those between Power User, First Aid, Hacking Perks, Demo Expert, whatever
---
I often have Glow Sighted spec‚Äôd and ranked up, but in general place don‚Äôt run with it always. Fire in the Hole, Green Thumb, Lock Pick Perks are all great for general bumming around.
---
Blocker is sometimes essentially, but most of the times not. I‚Äôll use a weight reduction Perk instead for general play, maybe only put on blocker for a hard event / quest. Thru Hiker similar.
---
I tend to keep a few points I can swap around in AGI. Maybe the sneak ones, maybe Born Survivor. Depends. 
---
Often I spec for Tenderizer in CHA, but as with Glow Sighted most days I just ruin w/o it and instead have Hard Bargain and/or the Fast Travel reduction live.
---
It does mean you may have better perks maxed out though. It took me 60 levels to figure out what direction I wanted to go in perks. It‚Äôs like going to college. You pick a major and spend your first half going for that major then all of a sudden you pick up a 3* super weapon or pick up some super useful armor. Now you wanna alter your path and major in something different which may or may not set you back. 
---
Yup, Nuka World was great and I'm hoping that is a part of this update. But I feel like they might try to pull an outright Nuka World styled Nuka themed update. 
---
Which while great, is going to not be any time soon according to the roadmap. :/
---
If you also have mods that consume AP, like kinetic over drive servos and the melee power attack one it can greatly increase your fusion core drain in constant combat.
---
Right missed an easy one 
---
This seems like a lot of work for a problem that shouldn't exist. Is there any explanation as to how these players are able to execute other without prompt or consequence? Has this been the case for a long time? Is Bethesda aware of this?
---
Adamantium Skeleton, however, is something I'll be sure to take a look at :D
---
They also have to be random spawns. Correct?
---
Yeah and if they give us 75, im sure someone will bitch and ask for 100....
---
No... Nobody read it so i will keep trying and shove your advice in the bin.. Bye bye.
---
Heard about that, it‚Äôs like a prestige thing like in call of duty ? 
---
Ohhhh I do haha
---
It‚Äôs always a trap when there is a wanted with high levels and no one is taking the bounty. I am going to build my second char on your build. You have a screenshot of your perk layout?
---
Even if it is a minor buff, as a melee player I like the idea of the Firecracker drinks.   My camp is near a bunch of Firecracker bushes and I‚Äôve always thought that you should be able to craft ammo or something other than just juice from them.   
---
I‚Äôve also have a sneaking suspicion that legendary explosive weapons came from a special process that involves Firecracker plants.....
---
Mothman! So hot right now.
---
it happens either way, they come in waves
---
üòÇ 
---
Stealth Sniper Pack Rat Medic build with Support perks, I simply call it a Combat Medic class designed to operate with full health.  The idea is I chameleon vats snipe and if my teammates go down I run out to revive, then stimpack heal while retreating which heals them too enough to get back into a decent spot.  Or if we're close quarters I pull out the plasma thrower.
---
Combat Medic.  Who can carry 260 weight and repair everything to 200%, unencumber team mates, heal them, spare junk, and kill the deathclaw bugging their camp~
---
I'm not sure purpose is the right word but here's what can be done with them (not my video).
---
https://youtu.be/srDzrxj_SOc
---
They're basically a pointless time sink.
---
A lot of the comments I'm receiving seem pretty relaxed about this whole phenomenon. Has this lawless unprovoked genocide been going on for a long time? Is Bethesda aware of this?
---
agreed, i think they are more for enemy pvE mobs as opposed to pvP players
---
I did find the higher powered machine gun turrents actually do good damage on a  level 50 scorchbeast
---
This man is asking the real questions.
---
They haven't said much about it yet. " An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities."
---
It‚Äôs a huge part of some people‚Äôs build which is why some people are upset. It‚Äôs been over a week actually and to my knowledge they haven‚Äôt even commented on it although I may be wrong. 
---
Also (and I know this is a hard concept for some folks to grasp) it‚Äôs entirely possible to make a point without sounding like a gigantic douche canoe. 
---
They won't see your dot, and as far as I can tell, you don't end up on a server with them in the future, either.
---
Gives me faith that they will fill up all the boarded up or unused buildings. Biggest complaint was that you went from Fallout 4 which was just so dense, to 76 which has over half the buildings blocked off.
---
awesome! thank you so much! it is appreciated
---
So if you are already level 100 can you prestige twice ? 
---
Yes, more stable, but less players and less nuke events. I used to log on daily and see Whitesprings or SBQ nuked. Now it's only a few times a week.
---
So....   Groundhog Day all over again...   .grin.
---
How could anyone possibly know the answer to this.
---
no, 76 is not an MMO, even lite
---
Keep acting like a child, that will persuade people to listen to you. Hopefully you grow up some day soon.
---
There is a reset available on the horizon. Not sure what other benefits it provides
---
and after reading that post from BS... i never would ask for THAT... its maybe a "funny" thing but not a dlc worth thing -,-
---
Would be good for those with the plague walker mutation and a melee build. Assuming you can stack diseases using this you could hit things for some massive debuffs. ***Assuming***.
---
We had some laughs, didn't we? :)
---
I think they should just make quality of life perks passive at this point. It gets rather tedious having to reequip every perk Everytime you craft, harvest, repair etc etc.
---
I would just settle for load outs at this time to, I feel like you can't fully utilize your characters abilities and gear right and it can also be immersion breaking and potentially deadly having to switch perks on the fly from personal experience
---
I‚Äôd love to see a way to program turrets. Think like in fallout 4 with Barney have his turrets for the Mirelurks. 
---
Add a control box and wire it to a terminal that you can add crafted target cards to amp up turrets. Camping in a Mirelurk nest?, program turrets to deal more damage to them and either ignore others or deal less to them. 
---
Lucky Hole Mine and Big Bend Tunnel are good places, I‚Äôve found. They have a bunch of different things to kill for experience (mole miners, scorched, etc). Get some pretty cool gear too 
---
Knew if I scrolled to the bottom I would find someone trying to stir the pot. If you hate the game so much go elsewhere little troll. We shall not feed you here.
---
I loved it.  Laughed my ass off the entire way through.
---
Also helped that I knew what to do and where to go, cause I was present while one of my buddies did the same quest the day before and lamented every step of it.
---
i think they CANT fix it, the only thing that it would fix is to take the mutation off (high risk for others) and get a new version off it -,- BUGTHESDA
---
The dedication this map must have taken...
---
Bravo.
---
I mean 50 cal machine gun.
---
ive done it once just to make sure i can, incase nukacrypt ever abandons us.
---
Maybe we need to create a legion or organization:  Grief Police 
---
I get it that PvP is a thing but multiple griefs that gang up on others is just a dick move.  Kind of like the toolboxes that set up a turret farm behind WS golf club 
---
Thank you! This is spectacular advice, as the vast majority of my encounters are peaceful, and it's only been in the last few days that this has happened.
---
Is it considered unethical to post IGNs so that other players may block them as well?
---
Early game, the first time I saw a snallygaster, I was like WHAT. THE. FUCK. is that?!?  On open mic.  Only to watch a lvl 14 cave its head in with a regular sledge. Despite being  squishy, it still scared me.  The all-over eyes moving, even after death doesn't help.
---
I don't fear them in game anymore, but the memory of that first encounter lasts.  It's stuff like that that I play video games for in the first place.
---
I want my jukebox to play more than one classical song
---
The next update listed using junk as decor in our camps.
---
I have 15 in perception with all crit perks always in.my 10 strength is all weight reduction or carry weight cards. All my armor has weight reduction or unyielding on it. I think I can carry 600lbs before I get over encumbered. The armor is what you need to help you out a bit more. 
---
When in reality a lvl 50 can theoretically have the same exact quality gear as a lvl 1000...
---
"Each day you speak with Biv, you‚Äôll receive one of two new repeatable daily quests at random. *The first will teach you new Brewing and Distilling recipes every time you complete it*, and the second will put your taste buds to the test as you experiment with the dubious effects of various drinks."
---
Only the first gives recipes. The second just sounds like you try drinks for their effects, possibly given by biv.
---
This is why you need impartial trade facilitators. I'm not on much but if i am i'm happy to play middle man for tips. PC, IGN same as reddit. 
---
That is what we are hoping/assuming. 
---
I think it should depend on how long you have been in the event. I do agree that it sucks when someone kills the legendary before I get a chance to hit it.  It's the reason I don't do Uranium Fever if others are doing it too.
---
Hopefully they give some more camp budget for this.
---
Not necessarily bad, more like a serious take on goat simulator
---
Shenanigans at a hootenanny you say?
---
All levels past 50 don't matter for those who know what they are doing. If you are 50 or above, you get my full attention, no kid gloves.
---
For tamable pets, you'll have to find them on a "random event spawn point", any animals not spawned from those points are not tamable as far as I know. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/RcbEx5w.jpg) I marked down some spawn points which I usually find pets at (might be a bit off, since I marked them from my memory, so hope the descriptions could help =p). There're more of these kinda spots, you could find more posts about those searching this subreddit.
---
"Pacify" and "tame" are two different options - to get a pet, you'll need the "tame" option; "pacify" only calms the animal for a while before it returns to hostile again. Once you hit the tame button, the pet will start heading to your camp immediately ([here](https://youtu.be/LhjiP2HUtPQ)'s a video of my Snallygaster tame today, you can see there's a "tame" option). Another indicator for a successful tame is that your name will appear beside the pet's name (like how players' names appear beside their turrets).
---
Yes this is the stuff brother!!!
---
Short-term benefit for the long-term possibility of becoming a scorched. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on that üò∑
---
How exactly do your bullets become inflamed when you drink Firecracker Whiskey? 
---
What if rad storms could make enemies stronger? Or maybe there could be a boss that ONLY comes out during rad storms who has awesome loot drops.
---
No I'm just assuming you're on Xbox. Lot of griefing over there. To be honest once PvP servers roll out this will become a rarity. 
---
This post right here is why we should be able to name weapons.
---
Imagine a legendary Gatling laser with the name ‚ÄúGuiding Light‚Äù 
---
Beautiful. 
---
I just started using the Xbox elite controller. It has paddles on the bottom that replicate the top buttons. They are extremely sensitive. 
---
I feel like the guns are either way to under powered without the perks, or Op with the perks, its hard to find a middle ground
---
on my first character, i devoted it to rifles (non-automatic) getting all the damage perks i could , that character is at about lvl 40 now, and is very UNDER powered
---
i made a 2nd melee focused (1 handed) character, he just got to level 40, and is very very very OVER powered
---
going back to my rifle focused character is tough now because it takes about 50 bullets with my handmade to kill a lvl 62 glowing ghoul, but my melee character can 1 hit kill them sneaking
---
so, something is off
---
&gt;That‚Äôs a misconception...   the stash box in your building is just like stash boxes at the train stations, the only goods you see are the ones owned by the player opening the stash box.
---
No, I don't have a misconception.  I never said you could steal from my stash box. I know you can't.  My point is that the stash box is in my camp and I don't want you coming into it. 
---
Because I don't. 
---
That's the only reason I need. 
---
I personally think max builds need to be nerfed for the sake of pvp the same way duped tse guns got nerfed.  If you can one shot players then pvp is broken, and honestly you shouldn't be able to one hit the stronger enemies like Mirelurk queens, Deathclaws, Behemoths, and Scorchbeasts.  It's just not...  Balanced, to say the least, when a person can 1 hit their way through 20 ghouls in 30 seconds, that's insane, to 1 hit through 3 deathclaws or scorched beasts is just ludicrous.  And 1 hitting players shouldn't be a thing, period.
---
This min/max stuff killed the spirit of the game while dupers shit all over its corpse.
---
what are you even talking about? I'm pointing out this guy who just comment on everyone's post telling them to shut up and bullying them. 
---
Its hardly worth server hopping.  Ive been there for months and only caught him twice as legendary. 
---
how about an AP regen but when it runs out you lose 15-25% health? lol
---
same here, only played the mod not stand alone, but it got grim.
---
There is an upcoming questline that involves discovering a new cryptid. It seems like it's supposed to be a mystery that requires you to traverse multiple possible locations on the map. Could be part of this...
---
If they introduce the new trade system it would fix the ammo issue entirely. 
---
PVP is designed around people being able to bully each other and ruin the play experience of another person in the name of "fun"
---
My first nuke. Farmed the codes. Did the cypher. The cypher legitimately had 3 possible options. And inputed into nukacrypt to confirm. Rolled the dice and my code was wrong. Turned out my code was the wrong one. I picked a bad silo for that launch cause the other two only had one possible option. And I chose to not use that again after that.
---
Ah, I suppose I should have specified I'm on PC.
---
If those PVP servers came out yesterday, it would not have been soon enough...
---
I‚Äôm level 90 and have had that problem the entire time. Add me GT BLUBLZRedeux. I always accept invites. 
---
smoking should give you lung disease and rob your health 5% at each drag... 
---
Other than unlocking more cards to diversify your build there really is't a benefit. Hell, I'm at level 130 and I have like 9 levels worth of unclaimed cards because I'm entirely sure what to spend them on at this point. I've already got enough cards to go full shotgun, full 2H melee, or a combination of the 2, and I've unlocked all the QoL perks like Fix It Good and Power Patcher, so I'm at a loss.
---
I consider myself a raider with a heart of gold. I enjoy helping out lower level players. Just yesterday I had an excess of stimpaks, radaway, purified water, and a few other things. I searched the map for a lower level player. I finally settled on a level 20 something, I checked out his base. It seemed rather meager and not something someone on an alternate character. I proceeded to dump over 150 aid at his feet and slunk back into the darkness of the map. Later I racked up a 300+ cap bounty destroying a higher leveled players camp that was interfering in my game play. He tried to stop me, but I killed him several times and took his bag'o junk. Good times.
---
I think the negative should be a loss of AP regen as it would damage your cardio, pro could be chem duration by 10% for an hour?
---
Forest Horde events reward 250xp for each hop (usually 4, I think)...and that is without xp bonuses. So if you see them up, I highly recommend grabbing them for the xp even if you don't finish all the hops.
---
Well, im almost sure that it's related to the upcoming DLC, since it has an entry at an Investigators Cabin.
---
Just progression of 50s era.  Air to Air nukes were looked at back then for dealing with bomber swarms.  Highly recommend hitting the nuke museum out in Las Vegas if you visit the area.
---
I liked the smoking mod in FO4. It give you +5 Rads and lowered your Charisma by 1. There was also a chance of addiction and the addiction incurred minor penalties. I used to leave my Character smoking if I (irl) went for a smoke. It was used as an optional method of saving the Game in Survival Mode too
---
Sorry, meant to reply to OP.
---
I think the frequency of radstorms are good already; West Virginia wasn‚Äôt nuked directly, so it makes sense for them to be rare.
---
It doesn't matter how important it was to some people's builds, it is NOT a literally game breaking bug. The ONLY time they have rushed a hotfix for the game was when they compromised the stability of the build by overwriting a chunk of it with outdated code. That's what a fucking priority looks like, not a single mutation not working. Developers have to pay tens of thousands of dollars per console for certification with each patch, thats why shit gets bundled together every few weeks instead of throwing hotfixes out every time someone finds a bug. 
---
Well, that killed the hype for me. Not interested at all in what we can brew if that is all .
---
Fist night?! That escalated quickly! 
---
Ugh... I hope not.
---
Exactly. I know what mean.  I see a nuke at whitesprings. If I‚Äôm not around the corner. I just keep walking. Not gonna make it to the golf club and everything will be dead making my trip for naught. Maybe the game should auto team people that aren‚Äôt teamed in events or nuke sites. 
---
It‚Äôs just a preview, so I‚Äôd assume there‚Äôs mire to it. Not sure though.
---
There is a mod, on pc at least, that highlights bags. Not sure if it is available on ps4, not a console player so I have no idea what is available.
---
Heck yeah this will fit perfectly with my lakeside music amphitheater I have set up at my camp. 
---
A little music a little drink and a lot of good times!
---
Stability is far better than it was and there's new content in 12 days.
---
Some other changes were implemented but i don't really remember them
---
Servers are a lot more stable, less lag and there coming out with free DLC on March 12
---
I think this same group bested me. I fell for their trap and was pissed. I‚Äôm so glad to know that karma works. Great story. Great tactics. I‚Äôm impressed. 
---
The queen got me really good last night at the farm way south in the cranberry bog. The scream and the way she jumped out of the water; I had seen it before, but it's different when she jumps out right in front of you, as opposed to down in a quarry somewhere.
---
Okay, just checking...   sometimes people can get confused on how things work.  
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs your base, do what you want...
---
Just know that if they ever lets us pay off bounties, I‚Äôll be picking your locked door, using your work benches, and leaving burning paper bags of fertilizer on your clean floor....  .grin.
---
I found a dirty trick, or maybe its not a trick idk involving seek revenge.  The other night I got into it with a bloody build deathclaw gauntlet clown.  We would take turns killing each other and the last time I killed him I was done and needed to repair before logging but he hit seek revenge just as I fast traveled to my base while in sneaky sneak mode.  I can;t see him on the map I'm assuming he can't see me either so I repair and my friends are being harassed by him and I can see him on the map, odd, so I come back to help and he is still hostile to me which was weird so VATS melee one hittaquita!  Down he goes, seeks revenge again so I fast travel away someplace close by go into sneak mode.  He's not on the map again.  A minute goes by and there he is clear as day on the map so i fast travel close to him.  He's running around harassing some lowbies, again he is showing hostile, so again VATS melee and he goes down again.  He server jumps.  Not sure if it's some exploit with seek revenge, I can't explain it as I dropped group before fighting him the last few times.  Or maybe I'm just dumb and didn't realize that seeking revenge still leaves you hostile no matter how long you wait.  It was fun and I made back a little more money than I has before we started fighting.  Was kinda fun.
---
Some of them are incredibly rare and people will trade high tier gear for them
---
Same here, once to learn, all the rest I just looked up.  There are multiple websites that publish the codes, sometimes as early as Tues. morning.
---
So there's an insane asylum with the words 'Nothing Is Real' scrawled on a wall.
---
A high ranking government official who claimed reality was a simulation and we're all trapped in it Matrix style, (possibly an easter egg reference to Anchorage dlc).
---
And now the in game date is forever permanently stuck at Reclamation Day.
---
So like, when do we get dlc to escape this shitty matrix and break out free into the Real Fallout 76 game that isn't this empty simulation of a Real Fallout game?
---
Turrets are just nuisance, but not dangerous at all. Doesn't matter how many turrets you encounter. The balance of the game has not been considered at all so Bethesda doesn't care about turret defense either. Half of the time turrets aren't even shooting enemies, sometimes they just shoot each others etc. and sometimes they just get destroyed by themselves without anyone shooting them. Welcome to FailOut76.
---
Stability is a biggie.  Glad to hear everyone can, you know, actually play the game now.
---
It just works.
---
Yes there were changes and improvements. Can‚Äôt list them all. Just google fallout 76 patch notes from the time you left. And see what‚Äôs up. But yes the game is in a better state and getting better. 
---
Stop carrying all that junk on you?
---
Yes, I had budget remaining. And as I said I have used shelving in the past and it \*does\* take up budget... 
---
If any decor in the game didn't use budget, people would have noticed and posted about it by now. 
---
Some people won‚Äôt sell their top tier stuff for caps. Trades only. I‚Äôm the same way. Caps have no value
---
Me too. I hope I'm REALLY wrong.
---
Or that we have the option to also buy recipes directly.
---
Why do you need to run the pipe gun perk too? Max weapon artisan + max CND degrade perk for weapons is a 400% increase in CND.
---
Look into the bash stocks, they greatly increase your condition at a small loss to accuracy.
---
You can run demo+ rank 1 in each CND degrade perk, and with weapon artisan maxed your looking at a 260% condition.
---
Even with only rank 2 weapon artisan, and rank 3 CND rate decrease I can easily get 1-2 hrs of use out of a weapon, melee last a little longer than guns, but the only weapons that are unuseable due to CND are energy weapons.
---
Just remember fo76 rewards a more balanced character, than a character who focuses on maxing damage.
---
I just received a response from Bethesda Support, from an ACTUAL PERSON!!! The information provided wasn't entirely helpful but here is what they said
---
" 
---
Greetings,
---
I'm Brian with Bethesda Customer Support.
---
Thank you for bring your issue to our attention. I've passed on what information you have provided to our developers to review the game's code to locate a cause behind your quest issue. Should an issue be located a future update to the game will be released which corrects the issue.
---
In the mean time the best thing I can recommend is to keep an eye on the official forums for more information about future updates and what it addresses as that information is provided.
---
Thank you for your patience and understanding while we investigate this matter.
---
Warm regards,
---
Brian

No, for full customizable you need to be able to bind whatever keys you want to any item, ability, or aid. What we have is a sometimes responsive sometimes awkward action bar which suffers from arbitrary restrictions, doubling up of actions, and severely lacks intuitiveness that it would need to be the solution for live combat access to our supplies, weapons, defenses, and perks/skills. 
---
Xbox cannot bind anything. The wheel is there just as a second inventory ui. 
---
This is usually the first feature of a big game
---
That modders like to re build for responsiveness and customizability for players at the meta / endgame category. 
---
#3 is key 
---
March 12th you say.  I will definitely be revisiting Appalachia when it drops.
---
Or they meant add it to your liquor collection. Or add it to your video game shwag collection. 
---
I want pvp and I want it better integrated into the game as it is now. I don't want to play a pvp server only, I can go play a fps that is balanced for it if that was what I wanted.
---
Did Swingin on a Star ever get restored in the game?
---
This. It hasn‚Äôt happened often but when it happens it happens for the combat, not for the resources. Just the other day I grabbed the abandoned bog town workshop for a daily challenge and two guys showed up (too late) to try and cash in on the defense mission. One was wanted, one not. The wanted guy wasn‚Äôt trying to be sneaky, he just asked if the defense was over, if I had any maps for sale, and then went on his way. 
---
The other guy was using a chameleon/ low-health build. Despite his invisibility I walked straight up to his rooftop perch and made it very apparent I knew he was there. We chatted just long enough for me to decide he was friendly and as I turned my back to go about my business he killed me. He didn‚Äôt take my junk, and he only teased taking the workshop as a way to work the system in his favor to engage in free PvP without being wanted.
---
My man
---
If you are interested, I took your data and reformatted it to make it easier to drill down to where you can find it.
---
 Also theres a 2nd spreadsheet of a study I conducted before patch 5. where I did a bunch of server hopping at the better vendors. I focused on armor/armor mods/PA mod plans, but I threw some Rarer weapons in there at the bottom. (it doesnt paint a good picture of the current inventory selection).
---
(Best viewed on a pc)
---
[Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
I didnt include whitesprings vendors, since their inventory hasnt changed any, and they sell a lot of (camp) plans that no other vendor sells.
---
I took out the pricing, but thats something that could be added to the end of the row.
---
Lastly, it does make it a little more tedious to add data since you have to jump around to each category, if youre going down the vendors alphabetical list. I double checked several of the vendors and they all had the same stuff for me, with the exception of a few armor pieces I added (heavy /sturdy combat)
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a strictly fallout issue cause it does that for all things on my Xbox. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I just plug the headset in and mute it whenever I hop on xbox
---
Making it a chem would be good. Take puff, kill a bear. Then deal with the negs later as you search for more packs. Or bum off your friends. Each pack has random amounts to smoke. 
---
No please.
---
I had an absolute blast with those whatever hundred hours I played so that‚Äôs very good to hear.
---
THIS!!!
---
I wish we knew where this content would've fallen if initial reaction to the game was positive. Would this have come out later on, been less comprehensive, etc;
---
Oh I don't actually care about the meta, just having fun, so I don't really pay attention on that scale.
---
Probably not at first, then they'll work to well, then when they try to fix it a third time, it'll break something else.
---
I have a dream where we Dwellers could build shops in small plots next to each other. A square of land or so 3x6? Like little attached shanty shops that we could build and sell from.
---
Not really defending it, just the reality. Kinda different with trade cheating though because you can't kill the cheating player and get your stuff back, they should have a better method to trade items in this game rather than depending on another player's honesty. Would it be difficult to implement "trade x item for y item" instead of caps? I don't know,  I'm not a programmer at all.
---
I may have bought it for a backup sledge. Have been surprised when an All Rise pops up in vendor loot
---
I feel ya. I stoped mainly because I let my Xbox live run out.  But now that all my friends are playing br‚Äôs im back.  
---
Do you have speed demon?
---
Maybe the workshop budget is maxed?
---
The problem i see with this is people accidentally selling 5000 rounds for 1 cap total instead of selling 5000 rounds for 1 cap each
---
I don‚Äôt get it. Tbh. It was never really explained how. Or at least I missed that class. 
---
Ok, I‚Äôll take 3.  I‚Äôll be on tonight around 11est
---
...hmm... ...you have a point, lol!  I need a new thumb drive, maybe I should go find one that includes fo76.  Except that I remember Bethesda ToS and I just can't hit "I Agree" after reading that crap.
---
Love the Forrest Gump reference.
---
I think it's capped at -100, unless they changed it
---
I was not aware of the cost. Thank you for enlightening me. 
---
3, 2, 1 to the Polygon article about Bethesda promoting alcoholism.
---
Settle down, Leon. 
---
They say that it is in the post.
---
No it was not maxed
---
My issue was I bout 10000 rounds for 1000, and the whole time I had some ass hat trying to pick a fight, but really how many times do shady people say they‚Äôll ‚Äúdrop‚Äù the rest and fuck off, a system like the aforementioned would negate any issues and keep trading/selling risk free
---
Thank you.
---
Genuine curiousity question: did they sound older or younger? My hope is that if they're young they might learn and change their ways eventually for the better. :)
---
Back story of fisto's creator spotted
---
That might have been it
---
I hearby dub thee Atomic Avenger. Go forth and cleanse the Wasteland of foul trap laying griefers, may the Lord bless you, make your aim true and your ammunition plentiful. 
---
I run a crap non-VATS non-bloodied rifle build because I enjoy aiming and hate dying. My friend runs a bloodied 2H PA build because he likes to one-shot level 46 Assaultrons.
---
Unless you like gatling lasers, the terrible balance is not a huge problem now because the game's straightforward even with a weak build, and min-max is mostly overkill. The problem is that if Bethesda adds an endgame with actual challenge, everyone will be forced to switch to one of the few playstyles/builds that can compete.
---
I got one yesterday and it's not bad looking... plus it's an outfit not and underarmor ;)
---
There was a guy on Xbox putting mines inside people‚Äôs houses. On repeat. Best.explosion.ever!
---
Excellent Idea! Well Done!!!
---
Pc is a different animal. Even your guys market prices for caps and trades is almost 2x more than consoles. It's wild. I would say try and find a good time to dump tons of stuff on an alt at once. Once the end of March hits the griefing should go down and the ones who still grief will be easier to kill because they probably got their shit wrecked in survival. Another great idea I forgot to mention is get a gamma gun. No matter how op their armor is it won't stop radiation as much as ballistic or energy damage.
---
Perhaps the guy sells fusion cores to other players?
---
...Nah.  I'd rather Enclave Power Armor or a clean Surgical Mask.  Besides, I haven't really seen any sexed up outfits, even the red dress is tame and there's no naughty nightwear even anymore, or any nightwear.  Closest to sexed up is the nuka girl outfit and even then you got a gnarly scar across your back.
---
No real good hairstyles even in the atom shop.
---
I don't deny this would be a welcome additional content, but do think if we're going to start dressing our characters like the 2050's equivalent of a slut then we need to offer similar clothing options for men, ESPECIALLY considering male characters can cross dress in female clothing...
---
The things you see in the wasteland...
---
I have no problem throwing the Stars and Stripes on my wall and all, but having the good old Maple Leaf would be great.
---
I had all materials needed on me.
---
There is a guy like this on PC as well. Always check that karma, and be skeptical of a person with low karma sending a dm. I've been lucky enough to have not been burned, mostly because if a deal seems suspect I pass it up... or ask if they would be willing to get a middleman.
---
I just set up a new build on nukesdragon's character builder. According to it I'd have to get to level 57 in order to build it. In addition to that, most builds still take a small tweak here or there, so probably some minor respec and maybe a few new cards (or downgrades of others) which adds another handful of levels. Choosing 65 is arbitrary, but it's def not 50. After 50 all cards are revealed, but some of those final cards have 3 levels.
---
Which ones, more specifically? Because if that includes the green one, I really can retire. 
---
I think it's explained in the Enclave and the quests leading up to it.  Lots of terminal info on it, plus I believe the research facility under Mama Dolce's.
---
I read up the details on how to do it outside of the game though.  Was easier than hunting down all the info in game.
---
I was probably that far in when I realized that's how it worked for the med finder one, don't know how I never noticed the extra menu.
---
Just a question are you for hire? üòÇ 
---
I too fucking hate those people! 
---
If your on the ps4 dm me!
---
hmmm, an alternative universe where tobacco use has no negative affects...  Yes, I'm on board with that idea. the FO76 world could use cigarettes as a tradeable commodity like what happens in today's prisons.
---
Oooh okay thanks! That explains it üôÇ
---
YES THAT QUEST WAS RIGHT ON POINT I ENJOYED THE STRESS REALLY JUST BECAUSE OF HOW FUNNY IT WAS
---
The only things I could think of would be if you accidentally got a bounty either by shooting a player or player building without noticing. Then being executed not noticing having a bounty. Also if you choose to ‚ÄúSeek Revenge‚Äù before respawning they can still attack you without you having a bounty.
---
Also the only way to get rid of a bounty is to be killed by another player. So if you had one and logged off after a while and logged back in you‚Äôd still have it.
---
This game is also very buggy there may be exploits still out there that Bugthesda is unaware of. If you think someone is exploiting don‚Äôt hesitate to report it!
---
You should it‚Äôs probably my favorite non offensive perk, and it has been since fallout 3 lol
---
Yeah in one day I gave away 3 Plasma Grenades, and in another, I sold 2 Stealth Boys and one 75% Fusion Core to a level 23 for 33 caps.
---
i had to read this like 8 times to finnaly figure it out.  hopefully it helps (its only an example though) https://nukacrypt.com/how
---
Also the return of the Hunters Hood!
---
Ey what's that place we eat at?
---
Shenanigans??
---
-glares-
---
if you blue screen you get to do it all over it took me 5 tries lol
---
TBF, the flame proof didn't apply to explosives until a week or so before they nerfed it. As a melee build I can tell you it doesn't reign supreme for PvP. If you have a PvP team though, if you don't have a melee build in the team you're kind've screwed. 
---
Hahaha unfortunately I'm on Xbox, otherwise I'd love to help!
---
If anyone on Xbox would like to hire me to wreck any camp you see behind the golf club, I'm down üòÇ
---
Thanks for the help
---
It looks kinda like a protectron hiding behind a wall.  But then the other one has 3 eye-lights.  I dunno.  x9.
---
Grafton Train Station seems to always have it
---
All the time you'd see it in comments regarding WV lore, moonshinin' and evadin' Revenuers was a big deal in its history, as big as mining
---
I constant farm the Top of the World area, with the Raider power armor in the fighting circle, for armor plans.  The work benches at the end of the street has three plans that spawn.   
---
I‚Äôll have to go bs I and check out the bunker. I was led to believe that we the players would have to solve the code ourselves and not via the game. MODUS tells you that it can help find the pieces but the player will have to solve the cyphers. 
---
Oddly enough I could see it being a summer event. 
---
Good thing this isn't DLC then
---
Eek barba durkle... that's just building with extra shelves.
---
I still think it might have been a case of having some but not all of the materials in your stash (like it tried to take from you stash first and failed).  If it happens again, stash your stuff and try again
---
What are you, a Communist?  There's only the Good Ole US of A.
---
I forgot there was a radio!
---
I'm not calling you a troll because you are playing within the rules of the game. I'm calling you a troll because you are going around cussing people out 10 year old who is angry at the world
---
Fuck me. Also what do you play on? I'm on ps4.
---
You'd think they could TELL US THAT
---
**BEFORE WE BURN THROUGH 200 POUNDS OF MATERIALS CRAFTING STUFF TO SCRAP**
---
Or something, somewhere like, 'but certain mods must have their plans bought and cannot be learned from scraping', something, wtf.
---
I‚Äôll check what I have left. I dropped a ton last night. (No one was buying...). 
---
Please*
---
Honestly though. locking my door isn't just to keep people out. Hostile NPCs (ferals, mole rats etc) will wreck anything inside the place if they can get in.
---
Griefing and attempts to kill players and take their stuff happens all the time, however if they actually kill your character without you fighting back at all they should get a 50 cap bounty. 
---
 Every murder I've committed on this game like that has given me a 50 cap bounty. 
---
 If you fought back at all or if someone in your team fights back it flags the whole team hostile and fair game for killing.  Also, if you're in a workshop that someone walks into and contests you are flagged hostile and receive full damage, I think even if you run away from the contested workshop itself.  This all being said, it's not beyond the pale for this game to glitch  and not apply the correct bounty to things. Stranger things have happened.  
---
It would also be nice if they added the armor tiers for Power Armor like they had in FO4 into the game.  PA should have significant damage resistances over worn armor, but it doesn't.  A T-60F suit or X-01 Mk VI armor upgrades would change that.  
---
 Its there all the time. There are quite a few people like me. ;)
---
It still breaks quickly, running pipe gun perk slows down the wear 50% the other gun perk slows down 50%, The cost of trying to farm legendary armor and repairing the gun so quickly is getting old. I repair it max cnd every time but they have it set to break so quickly it doesn't seem to matter. 
---
Nerf the TSE fine but they went to far with the damage nerf and the CND nerf. Enemies are such bullet sponges now unless you have a halfway decent melee then you can just run around 1 hitting everything.
---
This was never a thing. It never had proofs. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a legacy item now! Got an explosive cryolator myself that I love.
---
We did kill her. I had team up with some hard hitting bloodied melee guys and we had at least half the server there. She was definitely more tanky but we got her.
---
Dropped me a shitty 2** metal chest though lol can‚Äôt win em all 
---
Yeah, I eventually unlocked all the Marine Buttressed mods but the last one took about 200 scraps. Rubber isn't the easiest farm either. After a while you start to doubt the lists.
---
Today I learned 
---
I really don't know. I don't play dress up. I throw male characters into the mistress of mysteries dress because it's the only outfit that has a buff associated with it.
---
So if I have only vodka with me and I‚Äôm stuck on an island I can drink the vodka and then drink my piss ?
---
Just short of 4 months. And yet you guys want everything NOW. I would rather have new content then little quality of life additions that don‚Äôt really affect me. I will say a perk load out system would be cool but it is the only QoL thing I really want. 
---
I guess it could be. I never felt plague walker was a good trade-off though.
---
Were your six other camps turret / missile bases outside the back of the Whitesprings golf shop?  
---
Stabilized is a scrap mod for all armor types. Strengthened is always a plan mod. BioCommMesh is usually a scrap mod, although not for Marine armor. Probably a typo.
---
I bought a TSE pump shotgun at the White Springs Train station a few weeks ago for 200 caps. I think the guy that was there with me accidentally sold it because as soon as I bought it he tried to kill me. Thanks to whoever that was 
---
Jolly cooperation...dark souls 76 confirmed!
---
I mean, we have to solve them ourselves, the game doesn't do it for you, but I think all the quest info and terminal entries up to those points help you learn how to decipher them.
---
Yeah.. It is 
---
I usually just drop mine off at train stations near vault 76
---
The Enclave does need some love.
---
Reading is hard.
---
I don't really play at the moment, but for the 5-10 queen fights I did not long after game launch, it was definitely glorious and a boost to morale to watch a few people bringing out the big guns and listening to those weapons whir and unleash hell.
---
And then I would disconnect with the queen at 10%.
---
Don't forget your mandatory 15 pieces of flare
---
Np. Bastards got me like that before. Took me 30 minutes to figure it out. 
---
Charleston Fire Dept has a vendor 
---
Platform and level would be VERY useful
---
I just usually prefer to go for perks that have an active change on gameplay as apposed to passive. In games with skill morphs I was the guy who went for the cooler looking but less damaging ones
---
Are they that rare? I‚Äôve had two! 
---
Dunno if you still visit here, /u/mhunterchump, but did you get a solution to this? I have the same problem.
---
How long do serums last 
---
Yeah, we thought this might have been the case, but on the first occaision, I didn't own any workshops, and these players were the first my buddy and I had met. There's no way we could have accidentally struck someone or scored a bounty.
---
It may be worth noting that all three offending players had a variation of the same weapon: a Laser-Firing Explosive Shotgun, and all had very little health by design (likely a bloodied build).
---
Is it possible the explosive damage was sufficient to kill us in one shot even with the unengagement-protection?
---
Also, is there any explanation for having been killed in my Camp, and when respawned, had all my own turrets fire back on me, and not the assailant?
---
I'm on PS4 and I can't play longer than 20 minutes without getting disconnected now. It's worse that it's ever been for me. I had to stop playing. It's not fun anymore. 
---
Perfect time to allow us to show our camp to the public on the map! My place is built for so many people but is so empty :0
---
Hi , I‚Äôm on Ps4 . Level 28 and sometimes I‚Äôm in need for a little help. Me and my college from work are playing in team , but sometimes we need some  extra backup. It‚Äôs Nice to meet some new players. . We are from Belgium , so maybe we will never meet
---
I would love them to separate hacking, lockpicking, and the armour and weapon, perks into a different system, it seems useless and a waste of points to invest on them. 
---
It would be so much better and fun if my crafting stations level up instead, and for unlocking and hacking maybe they could let you pipboy level up.
---
I would love it if they had something like a storyline that involved the factions of Appalachia trying to establish control.
---
Like players rebuild the various factions (with NPCs being added in) and two main forces emerge.
---
The Enclave wants to pacify the region and rebuild America, supplying Responders with critical medical supplies, tech and information/skills. So in an area, you would see Responders handling day to day affairs, giving out Enclave marked supplies. There may be heavily armed, Enclave Power Armor troops guarding towns, patrolling roads and setting up check points directing people to Responder hubs. 
---
You may ask "why is arguably the most evil faction in Fallout working with one of the most good?" Well, because it is more interesting that way. You can tell interesting stories, like Responders being uncomfortable with the extremes the Enclave is willing to go to. Or the Enclave relying on the Responders to handle civilians and day to day living. The Enclave cant rebuild America if there is no one left, and the Responders make a great spokesman for joining the United States of Appalachia. 
---
On the opposite side, you would have the Free States "in charge" of their territory, violently opposed to the Enclave (as they represent the very reason they broke off from America in the first place). They want to leave the past behind, and rather than rebuild America, instead make it so towns and cities are self reliant and independent, while fostering trade and positive relations between them. The Brotherhood of Steel, equally disgusted with the Enclave and Old World support the Free States as well, but in a more distant sense. They will come when needed, and sometimes offer support for big threats, but generally encourage the independence and self-reliance the Free States embody.
---
In the middle, you have the Raiders. They work with anyone, turn on anyone, and cant be trusted for anything. They might break down into two general groups, Outlaws and Psychopaths. The Outlaws arent necessarily insane or evil, they just dont want to work with anyone else and dont have a problem taking what they want/need. The Psychopaths are traditional raiders: violent chemfiends who murder and kill indiscriminately. 
---
Players could then go all in on a side, and follow their missions and stories, or go more outlaw/mercenary/traveler and work with everyone, but not get as deep into their respective plots.
---
In the end, you have the Enclave using the Responders to rebuild America and bring prosperity through dubious methods to the Wastes, and the Free States working with the Brotherhood to tear down the last vestiges of the Old World and encourage a sort of independent frontier mentality. 
---
Plus the added benefit of them all having a similar Bloodied Build, which keeps them at a fraction of their health, a Gamma gun is a great idea! I'll keep that one in mind :D
---
Boy we are asking a lot from a game that can‚Äôt even run properly. 
---
They could fix the amalgam of bugs, glitches and *in their own words about their own glitches that blatantly affect a huge number of players whom can't stand it*, exploits, before adding new content to produce more "exploits" and bugs and glitches.
---
What is this, 7 Days to Die?  Why is that asking so much?
---
first of all, MMO lite isn't an official term anywhere, there are a few boards that mention that term, and almost always in reference to Destiny like games, so no, 76 is not an MMO
---
That kind of how I see it, it's either players who want to kill the queen more efficiently or players who like to show off how op they are by putting down noobs who accidently agree to pvp
---
Jesus. You have better weapons than me and I‚Äôm a level 90
---
Pretty excited for full pvp mode and starting over with a new character on March 26th. Also pretty keen to find out what the Nuclear Winter mode is. Hopefully a hardcore survival experience.
---
It means you're more likely to know what you're doing, but there's probably people out there running their 5th character that's level 60 that knows all the ins and outs of the game's mechanics and will absolutely wreck you. 
---
There's also some people that are level ~280 that don't know their ass from their elbow. 
---
I‚Äôm angry at the fact that people are upset about a direct feature of the game. It‚Äôs nonsensical. And the circlejerk of people who don‚Äôt realize what game they bought is frustrating. It‚Äôs like being mad at a football game because there is tackling. 
---
Sure it is, but i mean this games launch, in case anyone failed to notice, has been a monumental disaster. I think weather can be sidelined for idk, stability? Hacks/glitches/exploits being fixed? Ya know? 
---
I‚Äôm down, got tons of 50 cal ultracite ammo, y‚Äôall launched yet?
---
I believe there‚Äôs certain legal red tape around promoting smoking if advertisements, games,etc that isn‚Äôt present for the alcohol and chems in the game.
---
Everyone here seems to not understand the workshop update to claim anywhere. When you claim the owner becomes hostile to you and your whole team regardless of where they are on the map. You had workshops and the dude killing you had a friend at the workshop initiating a claim to flag you red and murder you with no bounty. 
---
Workshops are the PvP of this game. If you don‚Äôt want to PvP, don‚Äôt take a workshop. 
---
If you take a workshop, watch your back.
---
*You‚Äôve contracted Sludge Lung*
---
Uses disease cure- no effect. Uses addictol.
---
Up on dpad, use stick to rapidly select item such as pa. It takes literally less than a second
---
Nice lol
---
A bug i noticed, at least for me, is when you trade with a person and accidentally set a wrong amount for a quantity of said item, you cant re adjust the amount for the item because if you do it glitches out and can no longer trade that amount anymore. Like you try to sell 40 out of 60 stimpacks and set it at 15 caps each but meant to hit 10 or 0, you cant re adjust it to 0. If you do, the 40 stims are invisible to you but not the buyer. 
---
Ah. The game just words it really weirdly. I‚Äôll go press buttons and see what I dig up. 
---
then that‚Äôs end user error. oh well.
---
being able to sell a quantity with a net price should be just ad easy to implement as unit price was.
---
Well, no trading here, just the ever looking curiosity as to how it is players can execute player without prompt or consequence.
---
(That is, no one has any bounty before the shot is fired, only one shot is necessary to kill, and no Bounty is assigned once that player is murdered)
---
I also don't know yet as to why my own turrets fired against me after I was killed in my camp.
---
Is this something a lot of people do? I'll check them out, thanks 
---
751 caps
---
I know that in the past, you could supposedly stack bobbleheads up and do so much damage that it would kill players outright with slap damage.  I thought it was fixed but I'm not certain.  I don't know about your own turrets turning on you,  maybe some error that made it think you were wanted/hostile? Like maybe tagging you as the hostile one instead of those that killed you? Not sure,  I'll go back to it possibly being a glitch,  of which there are many. 
---
Here's a close paren for the title, my bad. 
---
#)
---
looks like someone missed being able to make a snowman.
---
I'd rather have the ability to scrap ammo so I can fabricate what I need.
---
Server crashed - going to do it again 
---
It's actually an even more dickish move.  By taking it down to a sliver of health, ANY other player who accidentally damages it (and thus destroys a part) becomes wanted, and they can go after them for the bounty.  It's basically just another way for a griefer to force someone into PvP so they can one-shot and teabag them for their own amusement.
---
Thanks!
---
His health is high for his damage. He‚Äôs strong. I believe that everything else should be buffed up to his level in regards to damage, and most everything scaled drastically down in health, if they‚Äôre too stubborn to buff guns.
---
Dude, are up you blind?
---
Amen
---
Awesome, thanks
---
Glad I found this out before I spent the caps on the plans.
---
You die, you forfeit your junk. Sorry you're so salty. There are so few consequences in this game, and you want to remove them
---
Some perks, like the crafting / repairing ones, should be "passive" perks IMO. You pick them and they're always active. Swapping cards out is indeed annoying, and I think that allowing us to create decks is only a bandage at best.
---
Haha you just edited it. It's alright, I have the screenshot üòÇ
---
Finally a mechanic that lets us embrace our inner redneck by consuming beer that gives us increased damage to animals!  Ah memories of hunting with crazy Uncle Jim....
---
Wtf did you just say?? ü§î
---
Understanding more so.
---
I would have to double check but I think there is a lvl 3 safe in summersville dam. in the dirty acrossed the water from the boat with the grenade trap in it.
---
I can see why legendary enclave stuff wouldn‚Äôt be available as loot. They didn‚Äôt live long enough to have their stuff taken out of the bunker.  And I‚Äôve gotten several 3* wood armours before as well as pipe revolvers. I sold one in Watoga just the other day. 
---
But as others have said there is already an easy way to do this
---
And when you get home 
---
Yep, except all the situations where dpad has been given double functionality and the ones where it thinks it's trying to access those other functionalities, so nothing is actually happening as I sit there tapping the direction wondering if im headed into a crash or if I can open and close pip , re aim, and have it work. 
---
We've now tested the game extensively.  Hundred days. We love it and want to make these improvements and finishing touches for responsive customized playability. We are the modding community. 
---
This message was brought to you by marsupials herd. 
---
A lot of 'I quit' posts are nothing more than dramatic pedestal humping. So when they start to spam up the forum-- especially during cranky times when outsiders come and upvote negativity-- I totally agree with the move to push them where they belong... send directly to Bethesda and not aired as dirty laundry.
---
 That was completely justified and not unusual for a games forum.
---
Valid statement, and irrevocably accepted.
---
However, does not answer the question of how it is these players can execute another player with no Bounty, unprompt, instantaneously, and without consequence (they do not accrue any bounty).
---
Any thoughts?
---
Fuck, you're sad. 
---
I hope Reddit Gold and Reddit Silver Tequila are two of the varieties available.
---
And Overseer stashes.
---
You need a few levels to optimize your perk cards.  Unless you got *extremely* lucky while leveling.
---
This game sucks threads? I didnt know 76 had a mouth to suck with.
---
You can't nerf min/max, my dude. You can nerf gear. You can nerf perks. You can rebalance combat systems. But there will *always* be people who will tweak the available options to maximize damage output. And they will *always* do more damage in PVE or PVP than a player who prioritizes QOL perks over 100% damage. That is just how games work.
---
Comparing the process of optimizing a build , which is about finding the best way to align legal game mechanics, and duping is just silly. It sounds like you just don't ever want anyone to be significantly more powerful than you, no matter how much creativity and effort they devote to the game. And that's not how games work most of the time.
---
And you're down right rude
---
Yes. See my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/avtz11/fallout_76_was_marketed_heavily_around_group_play/) for further details, but basically, if you don't allow people in the vicinity to loot things, you are forcing either very inefficient, illogical play styles, or the players playing efficiently and logically are seen as jerks for one shotting the legendary mobs and depriving others of loot.
---
Lol, this was almost exactly what happened to me within the first hour or two of playing. Just got a hunting rifle, and was poking around the forest around dusk. Saw this "Mothman" enemy name flash on my HUD, so I did a quick VATS check and found him. One shot made him turn into smoke, and I was bummed for a second, then *BAM!* Freaky red eyes of enlightenment in font of me.
---
About deafened my buddy on Discord with my girly shriek.
---
oh wow i was running out of pre-war money thanks 
---
i kid! i kid!
---
It is not a follow up article but i was planning on doing a year 1 review in November.
---
They are not really, you are too drunk to know otherwise.
---
Whatever you say, Mr. Petty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Omg I would freak as of this morning I‚Äôm at 512 and counting lol!!
---
I would pay money to see this script played out in the big screen.
---
Oh hey that‚Äôs me! Feral Hands!
---
Legendary Pipe Revolvers and 3* wood Armors don't exist.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for one since beta for my Texas Chainsaw thing. I know they can spawn outside at Pleasant Valley station or at a raider vendor, but I‚Äôve never seen one for myself. 
---
I think that depends. I've reset the price on things before and had no issues. I've also had other issues that don't make sense, like inventory lagging on transfer so neither player has possession for 5 min or so
---
i usually drop my (read) plans in the cash register next to vendors in train stations. My extra ammo goes in the blue suitcase, and I've notices I'm not the only one that does it. 
---
Chally would apply, but Chally has no experience moderating reddit specifically. Only a few years moderating for a writers' website a while back. 
---
Instead, Chally will bring current moderators refreshing purified water and funnel cakes. 
---
I know this has been discussed a million times now but how is this even still a thing? This should be in their top 5 list to fix soonest in my opinion. How the hell can you spend all that time to get nothing or crap? 
---
Yes! The two new daily quests you can get by returning to Biv after you finish the Wasted on Nukashine quest are repeatable.
---
Square up and get ready to catch my Feral HandsTM
---
They've done that. Do you have something specific you're waiting for them to fix? So that once they fix that you can end your crybaby, woe is me, victim party. Or do just want to whine about general "bugs" so you can justify complaining forever?
---
Nothing you just said has anything to do with this new content.
---
Just read. I‚Äôm just talking for events in general. While yes I would like to loot the legendary that someone took down around the corner that they couldn‚Äôt wait for me to hit.  But events are more priority. 
---
Technically, the brick (and wood) sets don't have glass at all...
---
I can make you Marine Armor with Deep Pockets. PSN: Xavier5249 . 
---
Don't need caps, just the materials to make them. I should be able to make them for you anytime after 4pm Pacific time.
---
Regardless of what I think, people can play how they want. I personally don't see the point of making crazy damage Min max build.
---
system?
---
Big Iron in the flesh.
---
Honest question: is there a reason for this? I have never noticed level 3 safes dropping better gear all the time compared to the others...
---
Yeah, that's the quirk to it.  Even if I did attempt to solve it myself, I'd still verify it at Nuka Crypt because the word itself has multiple solutions, and the consequence of having to do the whole thing over again, including shooting down another Cargo-Bot, is pretty harsh.
---
My buddy and I were scratching our head over this one, as we had only just logged on ten minutes before the first incident occurred, which isn't a lot of time to drum up any trouble. They were the first player we had encountered to boot, and we only knew they were there after they pulled us both in a single shot each.
---
We're both on pacifist mode, and pretty vigilant to notice the Red Wanted Cap if we've got one, so it's near impossible that we were offenders.
---
And yet, before we were even notified we were fired upon, we were dead, and that player never accrued any bounty, as we were hopeless to fight back when we tracked him down (not that we would have won)
---
Today's incident was the same individual 10 minutes apart, one of which in my own camp, where my turrets would fire upon me after I respawned, not the offending player. So many unanswered questions...
---
But yes, blocking has proven to be excellent advice, and I will continue to do so :D
---
i suppose ‚Äútrust‚Äù makes for an interesting game element but some people just want to get down to business in regards to economics. it would be mindlessly simple to add an option after quantity selection, a simple dialogue offering unit price option and bulk price option. one screen, a couple additional button presses. no having to be behind locked doors or drop. dropped items can vanish into the ground/floor. 
---
the other way IS easy and is also easy to be taken advantage of. the suggested idea here helps mitigate abuse. the best part- ppl could still drop if they prefer! everyone wins.
---
I‚Äôm just tryin to find out if this was supposed to happen, I was so excited for the loot and...nothing. :(
---
Interestingly there is a quick exit command but I really want to rebind it (holding Interact / A by default)
---
A properly customizable action bar would have this ability to be assigned how you want, and let that key be your quick power armor place shortcut when you're not in it. 
---
I use it to jump out of the armor, re enabling hazmat protection, whilst leveling in mutated builds under level 31, if a radiation hazard crops up. 
---
It may. I dont have an issue with it on singular items but i do on things with a stack. Like weapons and armor is fine but things like chems, water, or stuff that stacks i usually have an issue with it.only way ive been able to fix it is to relog. 
---
Harper's ferry and Watoga always have it 
---
Haha, I‚Äôm frustrated that the game still regular crashes! It‚Äôs annoying as hell.
---
Is the rug thing intentional or will it be "fixed" at some point?
---
There's a lot of broken English posts and comments that are usually made only to complain about the game. Apparently FO76 is really popular in South Asian countries like India
---
Dang well I wish you all the luck :/ 
---
I definitely sold a 3* wood chest and 1* pipe revolver. Chest was bolstering +1 per and ammo weights 20% less. And pipe was instigating. Maybe a bug but I definitely did sell them to Phoenix 
---
I wish lvl 3 safes had a chance for legendary drops.  
---
Would make it much more rewarding go into card loadout and switch thr necessary perks in. 
---
most of my issues get fixed by exiting the trade menu and re-opening it
---
Hey that‚Äôs me! and no please don‚Äôt i‚Äôm terrible at hand to hand combat
---
I'm just getting to Lvl 110 as we speak 
---
I just look them up. But I'm that weird guy who uses Google instead of encyclopedias too.
---
The value of gamma guns is starting to be less of a secret. Most don't have rad away on their wheel so they are essentially done for after a couple of shots.
---
It's west virginia not philadelphia, little less sun little more rad storm!
---
Such is the plague of F76, it would seem.
---
I appreciate all your help and advice. Here's hoping a patch is on the way :D
---
There needs to be an emote for spiking an empty beer bottle.
---
Am out atm - will help out next time! 
---
omg hes adorable! its like a lawn ornament
---
NAFC (Not A Clue)
---
It's definitely not intentional, but will they fix it...?  Who knows.
---
Are we talking in game or irl?
---
In fallout 4 there was a bar in Good Neighbor called ‚ÄúThe Third Rail‚Äù could work for this game considering all the train stations. 
---
I wish there was 3* Wood 
---
In Game
---
Square dancing to a fiddle is encouraged
---
 Mine runs great. I dunno. ;)
---
That could work, I'll keep that in mind
---
&gt; if that is all .
---
It's not
---
&gt;Here‚Äôs a flight of drink selections to give you just a taste of what you‚Äôll be able to brew up with this new crafting system (there are many more to discover!):
---
I have a friend who classes Skyrim and Fallout 4 as some of his favourite games of all time. He was on holiday during the Fallout 76 beta so he never got chance to play it. When the game released, he did the logical thing and looked up some gameplay/reviews. Of course what he found was the endless stream of YouTube videos trashing the game and saying how bad it is. He now refuses to even buy the game (despite it being as low as ¬£13 in the UK!), as he states ‚Äúhe‚Äôs never seen a game get such bad reviews in a long time‚Äù. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I know he‚Äôd enjoy it if he just gave it a chance. 
---
Well what the hell.... 
---
It has horns or antennae, and there are drawings on the side that look like people, possibly children, stood next to the same creature
---
Not when they literally said "add it to your NUKA COLA collection" When the only nuka cola they had put out prior to that was in a glass bottle.
---
It honestly feels like Lv. 2 safes contain better stuff than Lv. 3 safes.
---
Yep! Patch 7, which is planned to include everything mentioned in today's article, will also contain another large wave of bug fixes. More on that next week!
---
Actually, that was my character.  It was a glitch like the wendigo legs that used to happen.
---
I had 5 other friends all start playing. First one tried it and had fun and then others joined. We play regularly. If I hadn‚Äôt been there to walk them through the first 15 levels and give guidance, I don‚Äôt know if they would have gotten to all the fun stuff. This game has no training wheels. 
---
Also if you just type 'moonshine' into the search bar you'll find a lot of posts about it lol. Just because it's not the kinda content you want added doesn't mean people haven't asked about it. Do you want a direct link or nah?
---
You could probably change it around or however you like. Definitely my favorite bar in fallout 4. 
---
Incendiary on all guns save energy weapons. :(
---
How did you not get an 100 cap bounty for punching people?
---
There's a huge trading subreddit, almost every single imaginable item has been found and traded in this group, no one has ever seen a legendary pipe revolver or 3* wood armor, they simply don't exist in the game files. Are you thinking of the pipe bolt action?
---
Very interesting. This little piece of information changes everything, and I'm thrilled you brought it forward.
---
It doesn't quite resolve the first instance where this had happened (no owned workshops at the time), but definitely puts out the fire on the second instance (except for the part where my own turrets fired back on me, but baby steps are important steps).
---
Thank you very much :D
---
The leaking nuke. The broken water chip. The irradiated mineshaft.  Just a few to mind. 
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they accidentally switched the loot tables, like they did woth Robobrains. 
---
IMHO, @ L32 and usually overencumbered, my PA seems to eat cores ... a lot faster than any other iteration of FO I've played.
---
I'll eventually get the perk that lowers power consumption, but until then, I'll use PA sparingly.
---
I have loads of spare plans that I would give, but after the top conversation I‚Äôm not sure I want to part with them
---
Or have it play your own MP3s... kind of like the old Xbox that would allow you to rip a CD and play it in various games (Burnout for example).
---
Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of Our lives
---
I would of bought that pipe revolver from you for 10k if you were on PC
---
I think there needs to be more balance to the system, but I agree, grinders are raiders. If I have devoted a sizeable chunk of my base to middle launchers, that should actually protect it. There is little in the way of negatives to being a raider right now, if this was real life there would be a lot of negatives so the choice is actually more difficult.  This is why communities and factions are important. They could seek out raiders, help each other and build better town defenses which would make the game more interesting. 
---
You sure it's not your system?
---
Apparently.
---
As a wasteland freshman, any unheard tip is valuable. Thank you for bringing it forward :D
---
Thanks for the suggestions!
---
There's a secondary use, same with the binoculars.
---
Nope. The chest came off a 3* Watoga protectron and the pipe revolver off the the deathclaw north at the power station of the city. I remember the chest because the bot blow up and killed in the second I downed it. 
---
Makes you wonder just how well squared off it'd be if enough shenanigans are taking place.
---
I personally never encountered this on Xbox but if it happens again make sure to report them. Bugthesda has been actively tracking all reports and banning those using exploits and mods.
---
Even running a high damage/vats crit/sneak attack build myself I still hardly do any damage to passive players. Assuming it wasn‚Äôt a bounty or accidentally seeking revenge I‚Äôd say it could very well been an exploiter or modder seeing that it was on PC.
---
Raider‚Äôs Nukehole (or Waterhole, guess it depends on how fallouty you want it)
---
well there is the fan theory that the zeta started the war so maybe it was a cult from when they came to examine the result of the war (regardless of if they started it?
---
Which is a rarity in this game 
---
Didn‚Äôt think anything of it. So use to selling or trading the pipe weapons to level 10‚Äôs. If I knew that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúingame‚Äù I would have kept it.  
---
Fraud. 
---
Absolutely want this!!!
---
I‚Äôll have a few in a little they‚Äôll roll off my head. 
---
Which I avoided like the plague
---
Yep, been listening to the score instead of the radio for weeks now, way better. Although i do love me some SHENANDOAAAAAH
---
You could make it actually cooperative instead: If you assisted in the last defense then you're a joint owner. You get a share of the extractors and can fast travel there. Forest workshops would naturally be oversubscribed and have lower rewards, so it should balance out.
---
But salty troll blood can be used to brew the almighty Neckbeard Brew.  Increased stamina for nocturnal keyboard warriors.  Louder voice amplification so your mom can hear you from anywhere in the house as you scream for more hot pockets from the basement.  Side effects include hyper sensitivity to sunlight, and severe allergic reactions from job applications.
---
Yea I‚Äôve always been curious about running a melee / endo build with minimal points towards specs that provide damage resistant perks. It would be spooky to see a 500+ hp guy in full assasins and a super sledge charging at you lol 
---
That will be a good read, but I also think updating as each DLC comes out, or just reviewing each dlc, would also be a good read.  The last article showed you know what you're talking about.
---
The poor horse‚Ä¶ Dead and still being beaten üò™
---
Strength build but not for melee. Big guns and explosives, baby!
---
Max strength for a rank each of heavy gunner. Bandolier for ammo. Ordinance express so I can carry enough missile, and grenades to outfit a small army. Carry like 8 heavy guns at a time for fun because they all weigh like 1-3 lbs. 
---
And max rank basher to go along with my favorite weapon that I have. Anti armor minigun with 40% bash damage. 
---
I used to use regular melee but one day I realized god gave me a minigun to blend up supermutants into smoothies and never looked back.
---
I also like to run around chucking MIRV grenades, launching cannonballs, and blasting mini nukes. It‚Äôs damn good fun. Even if it‚Äôs not 100% optimized at all times, it lets me play the way I want
---
Although I've taken a break for other games, I do love this game, but there are still aspects to be fixed :) in all due time.  Good story tho! 
---
It runs fine for me. Sounds like a problem on your end. 
---
It‚Äôs never really a waste of time. Killing players nets you Junk, and caps, and that reduces the tedium of collecting junk and caps. I‚Äôve reached the point where I can entirely rely on other players for these two things. All I have to do is walk to Whitesprings and blow up a turret camp, and bait people into attacking me. 
---
I'm currently trying a pistol bats build and while I can wipe out people quickly, because Im fully species in that, finding stims and ammo is a nightmare.
---
That's the thing, I don't see Bethesda giving us a hardcore raid style endgame. The vaults look interesting but I doubt it will require insane builds to run. 
---
Fallout 76: The Comment. 
---
Yeah, that‚Äôll get them off their asses &gt;_&gt;
---
I loved the fallout 4 mod that had the guardians of the galaxy soundtrack as a radio station. Im sure it got removed because of licensing issues, but its still loaded on my game. 
---
Pina colada on repeat, jet packing all over boston lol
---
The Way of the Wolf
---
if your going to ask for 25 more why not 26 more?
---
More like should be more Freak-Wet, amiright?
---
Yeah, i'm not impressed either. I am one of the suckers that paid 60 bucks for this game and expected a bit more content. And not so sure about the amount of work, a couple of moders could have done this like they did in Fallout 4. Whatever...
---
Just add me, and if u have garbage that needs dumping. I am ready. :)
---
So where is the cheapest place I can get this game on PC?
---
"Create instanced content designed for groups that is not possible to complete solo"
---
 Yeah my chars soloed a lot of ESOs group content. Bring it!
---
That happened to me with camp venture and fort Defiance. I just went back s few days later and got the tape. Problem solved. 
---
I cannot wait until mod support is availible for F076 so we can add more music! 
---
I've never turned it on.
---
Scrapper‚Äôs
---
The Junk Yard
---
Gutsy‚Äôs Grill
---
The Cricket Cave
---
Flatwoods Tap
---
Paddy‚Äôs Pub
---
The Bluescreen Bar
---
Watoga Watering Hole
---
Excavators‚Äô Enclave
---
Deathclaw Diner
---
The Loot Table
---
Spinning Arrow Alehouse 
---
Three separate players with very similar weapons and suspiciously low health definitely seems to be a trend.
---
If blocking isn't enough, I'll be sure to make a statement.
---
In the meantime, I'll bring drumming up research on this phenomenon to back my claim.
---
As such, I appreciate all the help and advice :D
---
And that patch that fixes some things will break others lol. It's getting better on average though.  I'll be playing until The Last of Us 2 comes out
---
please! of pvp is being dedicated to a different mode (catering to a very specific player base)  please cater to the rest of us that I think mostly don't want pvp. 
---
Do you have twisted muscles?
---
Those all seem like debuffs to me not buffs
---
Please leave the broken options! It‚Äôs definitely an option people want, we just want both!
---
I wanted to bounce, but when the wanted dude said run forest run. I was like... F it! I'm going all in.
---
Very good point. I‚Äôm still on my first character so I can definitely agree with that
---
I might do that depending on the amount of content, it's a bit harder to do when they aren't released in DLC packs like the Single Player Fallouts.
---
Yeah the only time I crash or freeze is when their are 20+ things trying to bend me over or when I‚Äôm pressing way too many buttons and whatnot. 
---
I'd agree with that completely if some of them weren't actually valid points and discussion.
---
When that stuff starts being censored, that isn't good. That's why mods unpinned their post about censoring it right after. 
---
Np. I'm level 180 and I'm still finding things I never knew existed. 
---
I‚Äôm not a fan of RPG PvP but I‚Äôm down for some Hardcore Survival 
---
Old unfortunately. Lol 
---
Why that? I‚Äôve got Xbox One and my connection is fine.
---
Excuse me
---
I have enjoyed this game more since this patch came out than any other time. The scope on my sniper rifle sticks but other than that it's been relatively bug free.
---
Ain't that the truth. I hope to be playing for a very long time, but Bethesda, you really gotta get your act together.
---
If it were up to me, I'd do away with legendary weapons altogether. Every single time there's a game-breaking exploit, legendary weapons are either the cause or the product (or both)
---
Fair enough.
---
Idk. Seems valueless content to me. I mean, has anyone given a sh#t about alcohol inside the game so far? And now suddenly everyone is hyped for getting ability to craft them. And nuka colas are basically stimpacks. 
---
Putting points to additional HP is kind've a waste. Damage mitigation is always better than adding flat increases to DR or HP. Things like adamantium skeleton, flame proof, dodgy, and serendipity are pretty key in PvP. Lifegiver, iron clad, and others like it... not so much. There's a reason most people PvP out of power armor.
---
Don‚Äôt think so, i‚Äôve got a Xbox One . So?
---
The first time I fought a wendigo was at night, raining, in a town full of weak ghouls in my 20s. I was just sneak attacking ghouls only to hear a scream and see the thing running towards me at ridiculous speed. I ran scared shitless constantly turning back to shoot it in the face so it wouldn't catch up and lost all of my stimpaks by the time it was done. Now at lv 80, wendigos are pretty much nothing to me, but no creature has ever managed to elicit that much worry and fright in me in any game before now or since then.
---
Thanks :)
---
Shhhh. Just let them bend you. 
---
A testament to vast world of discovery ahead of me, if the greifers don't kill me first :D
---
My thought as well.  About time for a freah character.  I already know where my camp will be even.  
---
Right on that nice little lake outside the Charleston Train Station..... :P
---
This is meant for fun, not min-maxing. Though i'm sure some folks will come up with clever builds around certain drinks.
---
You have to remember it was human once so it does have the ability o open doors.
---
Bethesda already promoted alcoholism, now they're just promoting home brewing.
---
If your on pc. Make sure you have fallout 76 given priority in your cpu use and always check for RAM/memory leaks. And for console. Just check for systems health for long term damage to the hdd or OS issues. 
---
There are perks that make drunkards unkillable, so they‚Äôre probably happy
---
One shot sword and stealth build. Coming out of thin aor with chameleon armor and then slicing enemies up with the blade of bastet is timeless.
---
But will we be getting a host of new bar-related camp items to accommodate for the surge of alcoholics Appalachia is expecting?
---
How can I bet expected to relax and wet my whistle if there is no deluxe bar with taps I can place inside my favorite lounging area?
---
Brewing and distilling!.... something I will never use... but great for anyone that wants it.
---
I figured Fo4 powered speaker music was a thing lol
---
There‚Äôs a ton of new possibilities with the instruments in 76. Seems like most of the ‚Äújams‚Äù are in the Key of D (the speaker pitches D, F, A and C are in tune (D Minor Triad with the 7th). 
---
Bethesda said powered speakers ‚Äúdistract‚Äù enemies. (More like they draw them in). I set up the 4 speakers and soon after Glowing Mole Rats appeared, which was great, cause I needed food) 
---
It‚Äôd be cool (for me, as a musician) if Bethesda set up specific levers based on the output of the speakers. Different enemy types could show up depending on the type of Chord played (minor chord signals a random chance to spawn mole rats and similar enemies) (Major Chord or something even more complicated in major could chance summon a more.. ‚Äúelegant‚Äù enemy) 
---
Hidden possibilities/Easter eggs like this... are all the more possible given the online nature of the game. 
---
I doubt it, unless it's a completely new object. Because otherwise you're basically brewing caps.
---
The spawning in adds is not a bug.  Alpha enemies (which the leader of a horde event will be) will continue to spawn in more enemies (up to a certain limit, I believe) as long as it is left alive.  There's even one of the loading 'hints' that states this.  Kill the alpha to stop them from summoning more enemies.
---
Have you seen the pictures for what would have been centaurs in FO4? Now that was nightmare fuel.
---
Every piece of hardware can still run down. Having an Xbox, PS4, or PC doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôll just last forever. Or, your internet could be shite. 
---
My mutations seem to be randon, sometimes they work sometimes they just stop, worst is Healing Factor that mostly does nothing then will just kick in then stop again.
---
Only things that try are Yao Guai, Mirelurk queens, radscorpions, liberators and gusties. And try they do. 
---
Ah okay. I‚Äôll probs go back next time I‚Äôm on, shouldn‚Äôt have left it literally weeks haha but at least I‚Äôve levelled up a fair bit in that time.
---
For some reason I can now see jangles the monkey riding liberators....
---
Lol. Let us craft camp robots to defend camps. And yes that can be added. 
---
Thomas the Liberator
---
Good luck. It happens. Sometimes. 
---
I avoid Yao Guai unless I can cripple them via explosives. They don't scare me, but they are one of the few things that can still tear me apart with ease even in PA. Be careful if you are trying to Enclave Blast events since occasionally you will get Yao Guai for the enemy.
---
The northern part of Toxic Valley (the mountainous edge of the map) has a strong ‚Äúwinter‚Äù vibe. I didn‚Äôt notice until I Camped way up north. 
---
If only Toxic Valley had more than one song... the ambient score is a slight turn off for me. It‚Äôs pretty damn depressing. 
---
If it was almost like strange hole in the graphics with trippy lighting along the edges thats actually an easter egg, one of a few.
---
Supposedly theres some text that suggests your character is in a simulation and is still in their vault and occasionally theres a few hints, writing on the walls or some flavour text and even a few holes in the map throughout the game.
---
The joke being that fallout 76 is a game (simulation basically) of the post apocalypse. So you are playing through a game about the apocalypse just the same as your character is.
---
Woo! Thanks!
---
Oh, never mind then. Only let the lizard bois do that. 
---
oh, he looks evil.  Let's kill it!!
---
There were some in the x-mas rounds on the atomahop. 
---
I don't think that's really a bad idea considering how rare a radiation storm is it would be interesting if a new enemy spawns only in a radiation storm including with some grunts with her and if the player takes her and her minions down then they will earn a guaranteed legendary weapon or armor piece.
---
The Vault.
---
Yeah I thought about this when I was attempting a savage horde event. Assume for a minute the event doesnt bug out. And there are a couple people with you (maybe not as a team). You all start at the event marker, where It gives you 4-5 areas to search. You all split up and search one area.
---
One person gets lucky and finds the boss, will he wait for everyone else to get to him, or is he gonna just kill the boss and finish the event?
---
This event and others end up becoming a race to get to the loot, which kind of sucks.
---
I did it exactly once just to say I've done it. I got lucky by trying a caesar cypher and it working.  
---
That being the case, unless I missed some big clues, I don't know how the average player would ever figure it out without outside help. I never found any references to what type of cypher it is within the game, so unless you have enough cryptography knowledge to even know what a caesar cypher is, it seems like it would take forever to figure it out.  
---
But again, I dunno, maybe there are more helpful instructions in the game that I missed.  
---
This. I have had to move camps and no matter where I tried to put it I couldn't because it was supposedly floating. Freaking crap
---
In a weird way I would almost be happy if they were that big simply because it means a much easier target. I loath those bastards in game and in real life.
---
lol üòÇ
---
nothing that is wow'ing me but at least its something.
---
I think we are going to see seasons in this game but the company has a manual switch to change it. I have a couple winter coats in my stash just in case.
---
I think there's a possibility of an army fatigue plan to craft one which would be applied as an Under Armour and not outfit. Like some under armor uniforms that are like the outfits but they are craftable.
---
Exactly where my camp is, and I have already done a little addition to the rest of the area I had to use. My post this weekend will have pics!
---
I just tore mine down and moved south, but I‚Äôm sure the Bar and the name I picked will make a revival. 
---
‚ÄúThe Whinging Atom‚Äù
---
For all the complainers our there... meet Alcohol. It just works. 
---
Right? I think it's because we usually just poke our heads in and grab whatever looks good; pressing the button to grab items is so natural that we don't need to look at the prompts
---
Yes, it specifically makes using PA and a stealthy build difficult which makes sense. 
---
I loved the rad storms in 4. Really adds to immersion. Aren't there perk cards that only effect you during weather too? Useless cards atm lol
---
There were problems but eventually, the game will get better. I am sure it will turn out fine.
---
Since im not from america it would kind of nice üëç
---
The Muddy Rudder 
---
Thank for letting me know.
---
Enemies are not bullet sponges, there is this thing called DAMAGE RESISTANCE or DR, as mobs get higher level they get increased DR. Just like as we get higher lvl and better armor our DR/ER goes up too, strange how that works eh?
---
This is why you do piles of damage on the lvl 28 supermutant and barely scratch the HP bar on a lvl 68 super mutant. The lvl 68 has much higher DR than the lvl 28, so a large chunk of your damage is ignored because of the armor value on the mob. The reason melee does so much damage is because of Incissor which....greatly reduces enemy DR. High base damage works good on ghouls/scorched who have lower than usual DR, if you want to hurt super mutants, SB/SBQ, mirelurks more, spec into anti armor, it will help waaaay more than higher base damage.
---
They didnt nerf condition or damage outside of the two shot and explosive nerfs, and the new recalculated adrenal mutation, so dont spread/start rumors.
---
And I still dont know what your talking about with condition, if you decrease some stats and increase the base condition on it, you will be able to play for 3-4 hrs with seldom more than 2 repairs, I do it daily... and all I do is farm events and legendaries, so ya.
---
Which is a good thing. Ya know. Dog eat dog world. But not when legendary loot is the backbone of build and trades. I‚Äôm not gonna run into a nuke zone for chance to get something and walk out with nothing only to tp to another event for the same possibility. 
---
That's more like it. Lol.
---
Yes totally , i miss making robots, they were my provisioners in 4 so i'd se them on their travels when i was on my travels  :)
---
What weapons if you recall? I‚Äôm pretty much a glass cannon too but I still don‚Äôt understand even when you‚Äôre maxed out on damage.
---
Even still they must be pretty bad if they‚Äôre trying that hard to avoid a bounty, they must be trash at pvp
---
Yeah no problem just talking makes me want to get back on :3
---
Eh?
---
Praise the Atom!
---
Where were you in Texas that you lived in fear of scorpions? I don't think they are running around that much, but then again I have mostly been in Houston all of my life.
---
Fuck off, then
---
Just break one item for a 10 cap bounty so you dont lose 200
---
Maybe we will get the option in the coming dlc to make bots for selling and whatnot. 
---
The more immersive it is the more possibility of role-playing.
---
yeah id be willing to bet the winter DLC will have this....missed opportunity if it does not.
---
Ah yes, I said this very thing in another "fix the trade" post earlier today. Would be nice if it worked
---
That is also one problem I wanted to point out as well when I posted this Reddit. The more frequent weather the more useful for those Parks can be too.
---
Wendigos are tough at lower levels if you have little to no ability to cripple. They were the first boss type of enemy I ran into.
---
Also those wendigos were fighting because one was scorched.
---
If you are going to attempt to get your barbs in, at least attempt to be comprehensible.  
---
Already ahead of ya, check out Fallout 76, Fight Club 76 on Facebook. We host events every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday on PS4. We stream events as well so if you wanted to see what we've done and aren't on PS4. 
---
It was 1995. I think of this movie every time I see the pic for Marsupial. lol
---
**the cow level is a lie**
---
That's odd. I'm on PS4 and the game is running a lot smoother.
---
Saw on r/ThomastheDankengine and instantly thaught of Fallout :)
---
It freezes now and then, the best thing u can do is..
---
 The moment it freezes, dont push any buttons, theres a chance it will stop freezing after a few seconds.  If you start hitting buttons out of frustration the game will be stuck. 
---
You *actually* have Paladin paint? I‚Äôd like to see this miracle, my dude. I‚Äôve been trying like hell and the only thing I get from Forbidden Knowledge is purified water and 40mm grenade rounds, every damn time. 
---
This is why I LOVE this game. Flaws aside, it's epic. 
---
You'd go through the ropes though. 
---
Level 90 and I got my first rad storm today.
---
I'm also curious about this.  What is the benefit of, let's say, farming these safes?  I'll all for it as something to do for a change of pace but really only if there is more point than just finding some random junk.
---
Snallygasters look horrifying, but also go down pretty easily. Its almost disappointing. I kind of wish they could fly like some variants do in stories.
---
How was it? :)
---
Man, people like those assholes deserve to get their asses handed to them, especially by underestimating ONE person. And teaming up on said person. I normally don't read really long posts. But this was extremely entertaining. You go man. Keep on wrecking assholes. 
---
Haha that could be freaky as a random event :)
---
Brewing one whole cap at a time. You're right, whatever shall we do?
---
I mean don't get me wrong I get the concern. But it's really an eye-roller kind of deal.
---
Both players I managed to get a good look at appear to be using Laser-Firing Shotguns, very likely Explosive, and most definitely Bloodied (they both maintained very low health). I've heard tell that this is the latest and greatest build strategy.
---
Rumors have it that the explosive damage (w/ Demolitionist) paired with Bloodied is enough to kill a player even with the pre-PVP damage reduction, but of course, there's no confirmation of this to tell, as nobody seems to be talking about it at length (as far as my research has taken me).
---
It makes sense though, as it happens fast enough that the server only thinks that the one shot they took was accidental, and so never assigns any bounty to them.
---
If you're a PC player and decide to hop on, we can be ruthlessly murdered together :D
---
You lick 'em
---
Kinky.
---
Most people I have met are super nice. 
---
Some reeeeallly wanna PvP, and they're kinda funny, as they chase you down the street lobbing endless grenades at you, fruitlessly.
---
But most? Most wave, ask me to follow 'em so they can show off their camp, then give me free stuff for honouring their request. 
---
I personally like assisting players from afar... sniping enemies for them as they fight, and then vanishing.
---
All in all, this game has been one of the nicest multiplayer experiences I have ever had.
---
I am a solo player but yeah I found them and water and other essentials when I was a low level
---
Oh i gotta remember that XD
---
Are the waitresses at Deathclaw Diner in fact deathclaws? 
---
Could be both but from their track record I'd bet on them needing better optimizations.
---
Once your opponent punches you back, it's open PvP and no bounties. 
---
As a team player, I have learned that your teammates are just as much bait for your enemy as they are for you. So in a pitch fight, I throw a grenade at downed friends near corners. Chances are the killer is right there waiting for someone to res them
---
I'm all for new guns / melee weapons.  But buff the weapons first.  I would be underwhelmed to get a new gun then shelve it because of damage.  It's why I have a daisy cutter stored currently.
---
I'm going to need you to stow that common sense, no room for here it. 
---
Honestly though I don't see what is big deal, if they're making a mode that caters to the PVP portion, why not make the other one PVE? There is literally NO other real reason to play survival besides being able to openly fight other players. 
---
Not sure how co- owned workshops would go, but I think at the VERY LEAST workshop PVP should only take place in the Workshop itself. Just been annoyed recently knowing how easy it is to take advantage of people, and the current PVP status is a complete joke. 
---
Also am I the only person who hates that you can contest a workshop from anywhere in the buildable area now? Like... Why even have the little red table then? I mean locking doors and building defenses, that was kind of the point right? Although I guess it does make for some funny moments in my head. Guy just shouting at someone from outside the ammo factory like " HEY I WANT THIS PLACE. I KNOW I'M LOCKED OUT AND CANT GET IN BUT UH.. YEAH ITS MINE NOW. " 
---
H-how is your stash at 800? I'm like level 100, maybe 101, and I'm only at like 650 on stash size. Depending on what you play on, I could possibly give you adhesive. As for screws, I can't do. I have maybe 60. 
---
Idm people building camps around Whitesprings but not directly behind the golfclub. When i see a camp located there i turn into a raider and trash it completely. 
---
Because gamers are assholes and they like to argue. 
---
YOUR ROLLIIIIIINNNNN RIIIIIVVVEEEEERRRR
---
Had a few friends playing the beta with me but I was the only one to actually preordered, none of them ended up buying it. I just started playing again after some of the fixes and have been able to talk two of them into buying it, just gotta stay persistent!! Lol 
---
The whole time I was remembering the scene from dusk til dawn and watching him place down every known mine in game. 
---
Check your router settings.

Best reply I've seen
---
Count me in. I even will wear a raiders PA for the show. 
---
Where my two shot exploding Rolling Pins at?
---
When doing a "radio on to radio off" comparison, based on hours played... over the hours spent in FO3, NV, FO4, all related content (and trust me, that is NOT an hour total I am proud of)‚Ä¶
---
my "radio on" time is, effectively, zero. I turn it on when there's a nearby radio signal alert. That's it.
---
Hell, I played FO3 and NV with the ambient music turned off entirely. 
---
So what your saying is it's anything but the game. What an asshole you are. So many people have preformance issues with this game, literally hundreds of posts since release. But everyone else is lying i guess and all the videos on youtube that show the problems in the game are fake. 
---
What make your opinion on the game any more valid than someone elses?
---
Legendary creatures with stars next to their name. Farm high level areas white spring resort has a good selection of legendaries 
---
Is there any update to when they will start to unban players? Will it be when the update come out?
---
Nope, my internet is fine. I have the normal Xbox One (no S or X), could that be the problem?
---
It‚Äôs a Hooters but even more depressing.
---
I‚Äôd invest in the terminal plan if you‚Äôre interested in the aesthetics of CAMP. Setting up a bunch of cycling lights throughout your CAMP, then going through a phase of randomizing each color/intensity - it can be very inspiring if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing. 
---
Nope, I still have the same problem. No fix I could find yet. Frustrating.
---
Thanks for that I always wondered
---
In fallout 3
---
It's a good point.  The inability to place a CAMP down again is really mysterious when your foundation is flat.
---
Appreciate that. While I have your ear, could we also possibly get the issue with Adrenal Reaction fixed. Since last patch it has no positive effects anymore. Just the negative. I‚Äôve heard you can remove and reapply, but apparently once you leave the server it resets back to it‚Äôs broken state.  Also, when you have multiple mutations, you have to lose them all if you even attempt to try and fix. Given the cost of obtaining them. It‚Äôs not really a solution. Thanks for the help. 
---
The Brotherhood of Beer
---
Any update on when players are being unbanned? Will it be when the new update comes out?
---
Some of them can contain weapon plans you can't get from Vendors other than Grahm.
---
Going to put one in my next workshop. If they beat me in the ring, they can keep it
---
Right, Rad-X isn't a good option for me either. :)
---
As long as they‚Äôre deathclaws I‚Äôll stop by. 
---
Do you have crimson and violet and yellowcake. I need like 15 of each and I‚Äôll pay 30-40caps per flux
---
Yup, i see it as almost inevitable that we will get the abilty to build robots sooner or later because the gameplay of scavenging parts and paints and the Atom Shop for more luxurious paints and parts, it's a win win for Bethesda and Players. 
---
It's always crashing esp today 
---
I would. 
---
No. Fallout 76.
---
My network is open and has no issues. I port foward all xbox live gates.
---
I‚Äôve got a flechette Zealot‚Äôs harpoon gun which is slow, but I feel like rapid firing guns just miss most of the time anyway.  Then when she lands, Zealot‚Äôs pole hook, glowing meat steak and fury chems. 
---
Bouncer is a diseased Mega Sloth named Sid.
---
Okay. I will try that. Should there be anything else? 
---
Yeah, that could be right there. I haven‚Äôt had an Xbox for a few years now so I haven‚Äôt kept up with the specs, but I believe the latest version of it runs the game the best. 
---
Plus with Appalachia‚Äôs lore makes 100% sense. 
---
keypad is also worthless, because anyone can just flip the switch directly under the number-pad and bypass the keypad...
---
Any guarantee that they won't be affected by all the glitches that prevent other Daily quests from being repeated?
---
he does not find his hats 
---
I have plenty of friends, i kill people like you with them :)
---
Bethesda: same question only remove the last three words.
---
Wish they'd spend more time fixing the 'exploits' and bugs and glitches they know all about since before launch before adding more stuff to bring in more bugs, glitches, and "exploits" (read: Intentional dupe glitches like camp stored dupe glitch that they left in for players to be bothered with only to say they're abusing the bug when they're really actually just trying to play a damn game).
---
Pisses me off as well. I play PC and I have been spending time helping low levels work through White Springs so they can farm XPs and grab some goodies. Same drill the other night - camp with turrets behind the club. Sucks 'cause the lvl 22 I was helping got no xps in the process.
---
On PC it''s like 30-50% better. Still get a lot of  "unresponsive server" issues, but I get kicked way less now. 
---
I know I have violet, think crimson. No yellowcake 
---
Idk man it sounds like you and Mr. Messenger should maybe consider couples counseling.
---
I didn't know you could craft nuka cola period (just the grenades)
---
He totally looks like the liberator hehe
---
Oh well, they still bought it.
---
Nah, just add a Bottle Cap as a required ingredient.
---
Everyone around me hates this game for no reason, but i really do enjoy it. I fucking hate they declare their "unpopular opinion".
---
Jangles' Moon Room
---
Luck and intelligence determine the durability and quality of what gets dropped. Meaning if you have 6luck and like 8+ intelligence you should get some decent gear 
---
I have the normal XBox One and I don't have the issue you seem to be trying to describe.
---
but it‚Äôs very spooky 
---
I want to live there but the fast travel costs are just too much. 
---
Just make it cost a cap to make. You get the cap back when you drink it.
---
Need violet and fluesent add me kravmadizzle 
---
Or, or, just hear me out here, I might be right, and it could very well be a hardware issue. It‚Äôs **totally** crazy that things don‚Äôt last forever, right? Like how OP told me that he‚Äôs playing this game on the first version of the Xbox One, and that *might* very well be the source of this problem? 
---
I fully understand that just because I can run the game at max settings and play perfectly fine doesn‚Äôt mean that others can too. What I‚Äôm *trying* to do is some troubleshooting for the OP, which is exactly what Bethesda would do if he emailed them and got a reply two months from now. 
---
I've read reports claiming intelligence increases the chance of learning mods from scrapping. My own experience seems to support this. I'm currently working on learning mods for the Radium Rifle; previously, I would frequently go through a batch of around 10 without learning any mods, but after I started equipping armor and underarmor which boost intelligence, and also eating a Berry Mentats before scrapping, I've been learning one to two mods per batch.
---
Also refer to [Every Weapon Mod's Learn Chance](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/) ("EDIT 2" provides a link to a non-user-friendly image of a list of all mods which can be learned from scrapping) and [FO76 Plans and Recipes Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=1273174772) to see if the mod you want is learned from scrapping or from a plan.
---
It‚Äôs an ai pathing bug. It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù path it needs to follow for its quest to end.  
---
By ASAP do you mean at their earliest convenience cause as far as ASAP goes they CAN fix it RIGHT NOW, they choose to stick to a schedule instead though.
---
Shotguns are trash, I hate how everyone just copies each other when I see the potential for much better builds.
---
It‚Äôs probably going to be nerfed anyways since everyone‚Äôs complaining about that build. I‚Äôm surprised that bloodied can be stacked that high but I doubt doubt at all it will be fixed.
---
I‚Äôve always gone rifles, haven‚Äôt encountered a player I couldn‚Äôt kill yet. It‚Äôs so funny watching them try to rush me with a TSE shotty when I can get several shots on them before being in range. Not that I even need that many shots.
---
If I were to have a second choice I‚Äôd go energy weapons because they already do so much damage without perks and very deadly even if they have high damage resist.
---
Hahaha I do mess with PC but it might be a while till I decide to buy it again, hopefully once more fixes and content roll out
---
Too much humidity 
---
Pay no attention. What he's suggesting is your xbox is old and thats why you have problems. If that was the case you would have problems with every game, not just this one. Many of the people left in this sub refuse to believe others have problems in game. Probably gonna be more comments like his
---
There are a few things you can try to help the game run better, like clearing cash. I suggest you try and google it or use search bar here.
---
Hope the game runs better for you in the future and happy gaming
---
Okay
---
After the bombs fell the climate went warmer,  that explains, the dry river beds or dried up lakes and also no snow.  
---
That‚Äôs what I am trying to figure out. If we can home brew soon, I want to make vats full of nuka grape 
---
On one of the fallout 76 trading threads.
---
Ok I‚Äôll take what you got no worries 
---
How can you make a gun that shoots exploding laser beams?
---
In December I could play for 8 hours on the same server. I don't know why I'm experiencing so much trouble with it now. It's depressing. I want to play it but it just frustrates me too much at the moment. 
---
thanks, i will clear my cache.
---
Nope but in the mean time you can try crafting a real Nuka-Cola~
---

---
Check vendors. Players will often sell better or legendary gear from time to time. Events can give you some as well
---
I wonder how games like GTA V and the phantom pain got around this?
---
Laser weapons are not ballistic weapons
---
I sell the one stars 
---
Agree. Changing cards for routine tasks to maximize benefit  is very time consuming and the card system isn't easy to quickly navigate. I like the idea of being able to save  memorized card configurations for specific tasks you can name. For instance you could have 'crafting' card preset that would instantly load your ammo and armor crafting repair cards. Etc. 
---
Has this been verified?  I see conflicting opinions. 
---
Don't sign out or crash during it. There are no checkpoints.
---
Yea issue being who knows what bugs making that system would create 
---
Just finished work on the Country Road Bar &amp; Grill the other day. 
---
It runs fine for me. Sounds like a problem on your end...
---
Yeah ok dude
---
Hey, glad I could help.
---
What materials does it need and do you think you will be on around 11 pm thats usually the time i hop on 
---
I believe the objects in the camp may prevent it from being placed down, which is why people attach stairs to a single foundation and float the camp in the air, because most of the time you‚Äôll be able to replace it even though it looks stupid 
---
Welp, he's doomed to a life of sadness then 
---
:(
---
don't see how that's relevant, i thought we were both just ackowledging things in the game that don't make physical sense? Gatling lasers used to shoot explosive projectiles before they removed them.
---
I have had great luck with lv 3 safes. I found tons of heavy weapon and armor plans but maybe that's just me.
---
I thought EVERYONE knew that the only way to properly drink Firecracker Whiskey is by pouring it into your full clip and drinking it from there.  
---
(this is because, for some unknown reason, it dissolves glass and plastic so normal glasses/cups won't work.)
---
This is useful, thank you very much!
---
It says the quest starts at VTU. I dont think that BIV will live there because of the BOS daily. More than likely you‚Äôll find a note from a college student that leads you to BIV in another location
---
Works fine for me but they don't target rats or crabs. I set up that stairs thing on a single concrete block, 4 heavy lasers and 1 camera. Sometimes they have such long range they're firing at something a mile away.
---
Don't bother with noob unpowered turrets.
---
It lags pretty badly at times, and at other times its  really good.
---
I tried using real time priority on the cpu just for the fun of it. It ran really smooth for about an hour but then the whole system crashed. 
---
It shows up once in awhile. There are images buried in here of others who have encountered the Dead deathclaw vendor. 
---
It works for me, the old and new version have different codes in game. New one is busted with strange in numbers though
---
lol, broken legs never stopped most people in dayz anyway. 
---
Holy.Shit.Lmao. I needed that laugh. Thx.
---
Don't be too sensitive about it. Downvotes don't necessarily mean the person is downvoting cause \*criticism bad\* lol, it could just mean they don't agree with your point. Your response and Samah's response make it seem like people aren't allowed to simply disagree.  
---
For example, I don't think the drinks sound useless. They just sound like lighter, unusual effects. Someone might actually enjoy boozing up with a chance to catch diseases because alcohol \*has\* historically led to some nasty STDs... :-p
---
Gotta remember that the game has plenty of casuals who aren't accessing everything according to its power modifier!
---
This. Perhaps I have abnormally good luck with lv 3 safes.
---
Believe what you want but I‚Äôm lvl 132 and have played a decent amount. You can look it up on YouTube as to how to farm legendary creatures. Whitespring resort is a good place to go and it has good xp gain
---
Seriously.
---
To be honest, I'm not interested in brewing these fancy drinks much. I just want to brew some Pickaxe Pilsner or New Red River Ale and be able to distill some good old fashioned bourbon! 
---
I'm very jealous. Never got a plan to date from a lvl 3 safe. 
---
One of my favorite quests cause it was hilarious 
---
I thought you were legitimately wondering if/how  the Firecracker Whiskey would affect laser weapons
---
&gt; while each will impart you with a temporary buff, they also each bring a drawback and, just like real life, will result in a mild hangover.
---
does this mean junkies could be viable now? if you can have different withdrawals from different alcohols .... or will it just be one "alcohol" withdrawal still?
---
dayz showed me exactly how humans are going to act in a post apocalypse survival to be honest. 
---
This. 
---
Lmao!
---
I never encountered a deathclaw vendor. Lol. Is there something like a stingwing or radroach vendor aswell? 
---
Man I havent been on this subreddit since they went back to an old patch when applying the new update and I was considering installing the game again. After reading this, especially since this is the quest I'm on, I think I'm good.
---
Moo? Moo. Moo! Moomoo moo. Moo.
---
Mine seems to be speed demon. When it does work it only works like a minute then stops. Except the negative effect. That works just fine. Im constantly thirsty and hungry.
---
When they nerf the legendary ghouls at whitesprings it will be. with as much farming as is going on there you have to be a fucking idiot if you dont think beth is gonna nerf that place. 
---
oh, no we just seem to have misunderstood eachother then, I thought you were implying it didnt make sense in an unrealistic way
---
"firecracker whiskey" gosh I wonder if there's some real-world-equivalent whiskey.
---
I know for a fact I've self-immolated at least a few evening due to such a drink lol
---
i agree, i really hope that they add more songs to the radio
---
last night on two occasions I had dudes trolling me. Its getting to the point  where I rapidly power off the console in mid combat. I am sick of spending a day grinding to get materials for ammo, food, etc. and waste it on those asshats. I have looked at blocking players, but it states only for this session. 
---
pacifist mode, is that a PC option?
---
I‚Äôm 303 and neither have seemed to affect my drops. I have 11 in luck and 9 in intelligence. I still get  majority of one star junk. 
---
I could use 5 Stable Violet Flux...say 100 caps each or whatever you think is a fair price?
---
I'm also on PS4, same account name as here, but more evenings after 7 or 8 central as I work during the day. We can set up something.
---
I have two videos of 'sweet spots' that cause EVERYTHING except the ground to unrender leaving you standing in a barren poorly textured world without structures, flora, anything but a ground.
---
One of them I found because a cooking station floor pot variant literally made me see it happen.  That one was in the grafton area of the toxic valley in a destroyed building on the western outskirts of the city.  You'll face north out of a destroyed windowish/wall portion of the destroyed building when exiting the camp.
---
Then there's that BoS camp just southeast of Dabney Homestead where you turn in technical data, one corner of a room on ground level will unrender the entire area.
---
Ok well that‚Äôs all I do and scorched queen events and I get decent gear all the time
---
Why would you want to?
---
Holy Jesus. What is that? What the fuck is that!?
---
I loved that movie ;)
---
All I can tell you is that the a lot of the game freezing issues I have seen are console based. I maybe freeze/disconnect on pc once every 15-20 hours of play. So either Bethesda sucks at setting up console based servers or there are inherent console based issues of connectivity at the level of the individual console. I would try hardwiring your Xbox to the router and see how stable the game is then.
---
Omg this is awesome hahaha too bad I'm on XBOX
---
I've been planning my meat and booze bar for a while - Meat &amp; Greet!
---
Might going play soon
---
I thought it would have been another cooking station that does close to nothing like cooking food does(close to nothing), but this looks interesting and might give me a reason to use it.
---
The creativity of people never ceases to amaze me I love it
---
Like the guy in Watoga obsessed with garbage cans but instead with shelves
---
Not that the current selection is bad.  I just miss some of them.  Uranium Fever also was a good one.  Beach Boys was a surprise for this game though, didn't expect that.
---
Four walmart warehouse loaders had a bad dayz. 
---
Not all workshops produce the same materials. Some things can only be found in one particular place.
---
I see Excavator PA as the collective ‚ÄúUniform‚Äù for the mid-game grind. I‚Äôm doing daily vendor runs, and Im collecting as much Junk as I can to sell. Workshops can yield a bunch of food (like glowing meat steak) which I also sell. 
---
When I see someone else wearing the E PA I know they are going through the grind like me. Maybe one day I‚Äôll retire (once I have all the plans/things I want to buy) but something tells me any retirement will be short lived. 
---
Also, I have another PA set I occasionally use. It‚Äôs a little stronger than my E PA, but E PA as is does me right. I‚Äôm level 86 and took out a lvl  m80 scorchbeast today that surprise attacked my CAMP. I‚Äôve only killed maybe a few now, all lvl 50. I was surprised at how well I did. 
---
Haven‚Äôt had much luck trying or enjoying PVP. I‚Äôve been one-shot murdered just minutes after setting up a full workshop. I like the Gamble of claiming workshops, but I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding why one shot murder is a thing. Seems pretty harsh. I feel there should always be somewhat of chance to fight back. 
---
It‚Äôs always you creepers with the Scream-esque hoodies on. You people worry me, honestly lol
---
And, as once again OP told me, considering that he‚Äôs playing on the oldest Xbox One, the problem is on his end. 
---
On the other side of the coin for something you said, along the lines of ‚Äúpeople have said in the past the game has performance issues but they must be lying‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that the game is always at fault. IMHO, it sounds like you‚Äôre trying to start something here just for the sake of starting something. 
---
#ThingsMySisterAndSBQHaveInCommon
---
Would make for a good full fo76 release where you escape the simulation in your vault and exit out into the Real Appalachia Wasteland.
---
I had this happen to me in beta. The deathclaw was selling human bones. And attacked when I didn‚Äôt buy. Not sure if joke or real.  But yeah. Same area. Mine was just outside of Lewisburg 
---
So you want to force PvP on people who do not want it. For reasons.
---
It's just the stigma.  In GTA Online, you stop getting anything important past level 120 I think.  But there are connotations with being higher level than somebody who is only like level 60
---
It's also important to remember that while level 50 is the max, a higher level character means that they have access to all, or the majority of important perks in the game, which means they're more likely to have refined what they want to use.  
---
It doesn't mean they're definitely more dangerous, but compare a level 78 to a fresh level 50.  Both are players who don't have a second character, but the level 78 has had 28 additional levels to decide and refine his SPECIAL and perk card distribution, while the level 50 may have made some mistakes and isn't that optimized. Maybe he made a mistake or two, or chose perk cards and SPECIAL points that aren't so useful anymore.
---
For me when the game crashed in this quest it broke the quest and Bethesda support told me they couldn't do anything about it so I literally can't progress in the quest. I haven't played the game since but Im going to assume it's still broke.
---
yeah not complaining about the current selection other than the limited amount. fallout 4 songs were great, couldn‚Äôt help singing along every time that certain songs came on, good times 
---
Reddit is the hub. Twitch is the hub. MMO's don't need an in game hub anymore. How come you're not interested in 12v12, or anything other than boring trading?
---
Yes. You got it.
---
The only thing I notice and it‚Äôs probably not a statement of fact, but I get into these long stretches of the same designation or item. Last night was five troubleshooter items in one Whitespring cycle. 
---
usually on after 2:00 p.m Saturdays and all day Sundays, be happy to give you some help.  Gamertag is same, but use and "e" instead of "a"
---
I'm fairly new to the game, but doesn't holding a workshop make you open to PvP by anyone? Do they even get a bounty in that situation?
---
When ghoul J23 or whatever popped in I about pissed myself laughing.
---
Still check out the Facebook page and a stream. Maybe it'll inspire you to make an Xbox one!
---
~~Powder~~ Beer Keg
---
Also protectrons are working for the scorched! 
---
There a TON of music in public domain from the 40s and early 50s about nuclear energy, uranium, etc. they should add a few more songs from this time frame. I enjoy the static sound from old recordings, and since a lot of them are public domain there‚Äôs no royalty fee for Bethesda.
---
I know it‚Äôs been said before but I wish there was a multitude of robot radio jockeys to announce events from all over Appalachia. I want one station but maybe each area could have a different robot announcer. Protection for the forest, assaultron for the mire, sentrybot for the cranberry bog, robobrain for savage divide, etc.
---
does anything besides rad-x suppress mutations?
---
Are glitches surrounding daily's going to be fixed? Outside of three or four certain daily's, I never have any of them trigger for me.
---
I have an awesome garage and workshop out there. i love it! 
---
If only pre-war money was useful, like it was in fallout 4 lol
---
First off, he said he never took the settlement, so that means the guy had no interest in anything besides killing some Level 9. 
---
Secondly, the PVP system as a whole is a complete joke. I like the slap damage idea and being able to fight back, not overly fond of the revenge system but whatever. But player A contests your workshop, and his teammate had traveled to you and starts to kill you the moment the other guy contests it? That shouldn't be a thing. 
---
If you're in the buildable area, then yes by all means it's a fight to the death for ownership. If I'm down trading at white springs do not let some teammate kill me cause someone is contesting the Ammo factory or whatever. That's griefing. If it's working as intended then you do not have to go OUT of your way to kill me. If you're paying caps to travel somewhere JUST to kill someone ( wanted players aside ) then that's griefing. Again, buildable area in a workshop then yes. 
---
If YoU dOnT WanNa PvP thEn DoNt taKe a WorKsHoP. I hate that ideology. How shortsighted. So what options do lower level toons have? Those newer players who don't have larger portions of the map exposed? "Well they just tough it out like me an pappy!" 
---
I did it just fine! 
---
Ooh great, all of our problems are solved. I mean as long as one or at least a good handful of people have done it, then everyone can! I mean that logic ALWAYS checks out right? 
---
When it released, I was the first amongst my friends to get it. I recommended they didn't. Now that the game is in a more...Tolerable..state, I cant convince them to get it and play with me. oh well.
---
Well I recommend checking the locations listed. You may find something you find useful. Im going to add a edit to give a general idea of what I have found so far.
---
You can smoke in rdr , you can smoke in MGS ...
---
Fallout is an adult game and should be the same..
---
I get why they avoid it but find it Hypocritical and backwards when Alcohol isn't frowned upon like smoking is by society in general, yet it kills people just like smoking kills people.
---
I like the mod that allowed me to smoke Joints crafted from Bloodleaf.
---
Fair 'nuf, but there's a lot of cards like ammosmith, super duper, contractor, starched genes, fix it good, or weaponsmith that I'll never use at lower than max level once I have them and others like team maneuvers or ghoulish that I enjoy having multiple options for. 
---
The ambiance is what I've been listening to. To me it sounds like a empty wasteland which in this case works great.
---
Hello InterplanetarySound, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Now you are questioning realism?
---
Snallygasters always catch me off guard.
---
IDK but Giant Rad Scorpions make me cringe
---
But nothing makes me scream harder than the Deathclaw GANGS in New Vegas. I would always try to run away
---
*Hes like a smaller, more lethal me packed into a small vicious can.* 
---
*Hes like... a mini me.*
---
I also think it has to do with the order things were placed in (the same way that walls are sometimes reversed based on whether or not you built the floor first).
---
PSA:  Always check ALL the stars. I have purchased some God Tier stuff at vendors. I am assuming people are not checking all the effects. 
---
Just wondering how it works.
---
Agreed.  I was a little sad that right behind you baby was on the announcement trailer but not in the final game.  I didn't think they would get the wanderer either.  But here's holding out hope for more.  Especially when they put the radio back in.  I destroyed my jukebox because I couldn't deal with it anymore.
---
I wish ..but I make sure I buy one once a day for both of my characters 
---
It's a location thing I noticed. Like camden, to see the daily you can jump to lewis station and it will come up if available. Or can jump strait to it, but that costs if you're wrong.
---
I know that. But I wouldn't call it a God.
---
He's the "Pint-Sized-Slasher"
---
The vendor at watoga station has advanced power connectors for 190ish caps
---
yes please. Why would you not, other than "cause I wanna"?
---
If I ever find a good route for collecting nuka colas, cherries, and quantums, I'll totally open up a Nuka Girl Bar.
---
Otherwise I'll stick to my Insane Pharmaceuticals selling chems, booze, aid, junk, and legendary weapons/apparel.
---
I just moved there. I'm next the the Southern Belle Motel. I moved in one of the power towers.  Everything is pretty self contained so it's nice. Just getting some tweaks done and some more plans to finish it off. 
---
My fave 2 made it in. Uranium Fever and Pistol Packing Mama. Although atom bomb baby would be good to hear in 76
---
Bethesda: ok community, we hear you, you want NPCs. &lt;adds Preston Garvey&gt;
---
The downvote button isn't for disagreement.
---
They also built the game with duping exploits present.  Does that mean they intended them to be there, and that no-one should complain about them?
---
Sorry, your logic is faulty.  While I don't support completely eliminating PvP, I don't believe they EVER intended it to be something that was able to be forced onto players who didn't want to participate in it, nor did they expect it would be so exploitable for griefing.
---
The solution (as far as workshops go) is pretty simple.  If the workshop is held by someone in Pacifist mode, any challenge AUTOMATICALLY succeeds (or maybe it should PROMPT the current owner and ask if they want to accept the challenge), the challenger gets the workshop, no PVP occurs.  And someone in Pacifist mode CANNOT challenge ownership of a workshop....they can only claim un-owned workshops.
---
Simply assuming that the way it is currently working is what Bethesda intended, or wanted, and that they don't consider players feedback, is hubris.  If that were the case, they wouldn't be implementing a Survival mode for PvPers only that is separate from the rest.
---
I have found swing speed reduced weight melees, vanguard sentinel and cavalier armor, and multiple explosive weapons 
---
I have 8+ Luck and 8+ Intelligence. 
---
are we the same person ? i was so excited when i heard right behind you baby on that trailer but so disappointed when it wasn‚Äôt included in the radio. also about the jukebox, why would a jukebox have classical music ? i wouldn‚Äôt be so bothered if it had the appalachian radio playing but classical music made me keep it turned off  
---
I‚Äôd be totally fine with the jukebox if it wasn‚Äôt stuck on classical. In 4 I‚Äôd have one set up and then just use the rug glitch to stuff 2-3 Diamond City radios in it. 
---
What do you mean?
---
Are you on PC ? Strange in numbers seems fine for me though :) thanks 
---
Okay.
---
I strongly disagree, but in the end I guess it's up to each of us to decide how to use it. 
---
I‚Äôm just surprised it‚Äôs taken me this long to see a post talking about it
---
thank you! very helpful
---
This point has been brought up, and was revelatory to me. It went a long way to explain what had happened the second time around, but not the first (as I hadn't any workshops at the time)
---
The research continues :D
---
Maybe they patch it?
---
And again you speculate that the problem is on his end with very little information. And again i refer back to your original comment. Saying the game runs fine for you so it must be a problem with his console is shitty
---
I can barely do anything against those bats.
---
lol we should team up.  I know all the pocket mods but still need bos for legs :)  
---
For real I didnt expect it at all, honestly I expected gta online level toxicity.
---
DAMN it looks SO cool when a full power-armor dude is standing up against the queen holding one and firing a whole barrage of lasers from toe to head of the beast, it really is quite impressive, especially if it happens to be untracite so you get the green lasers.
---
To bad after that the gun immediately breaks, and it didn't do enough damage to count so you still don't get any loot!
---
It drives me crazy when people let other people do their thinking for them
---
I guess I can try the whitesprings.
---
I just wish anyone knew how they were supposed to work.  I've gone back again and again to places where daily quests are and I never get them again after I've done them, except for the pumpkin house.  
---
I never get any daily quests walking around anymore - sometimes when I log in I will have one of the ones that is under miscellaneous before it moves into daily - but if I don't that's it - no daily quests that day no matter what I do. 
---
True.  I used grounded so I wasn't thinking about energy weapons lol.  But that's probably the most exciting part for me is theorycrafting how new effects could work into builds.  Like using the tick blood tequila with plague walker to progressively ramp up damage passive damage and possibly not need to carry food.  Plus this whole content drop might make the "Junkie" Legendary effect much more viable.  
---
Technically having a camp on the east side of the map is the cheaper option re ft. Since you can ft for free to vault 76 on the west side of the map and your camp on the east the average ft cost to any point on the map would be lower. At least it seems that way to me...
---
I do not have a lot of caps and any rare stuff though.
---
Adrenal got recalculated on when and how the damage boost is applied, Ive seen a couple posts the last few days outlining how it works now.
---
If you did the remove + reapply and the serum you used was created before the last patch it wont work. The serum needs to havr been created after the last patch for the new effects to work.
---
If you have negative HP doesnt that mean your dead?!
---
Haha I always screw myself over helping randoms, giving them my last few stims or radaway etc.
---
That seems useful. 
---
Haha exactly it's hard to be naughty in a nice world smh
---
Hear hear! Mire Living is the best! Couldn't agree more.
---
I don't think they should have been censored, exactly. Maybe just create a single thread for 'on the way out feedback'. 
---
I've seen way too many of these posts over my years of MMO gaming to think very highly of their content or purpose, haha.
---
Team up with someone if you are low level. Get a Tesla and tag the ghouls and let the high level kill them. You will get loot and xp 
---
Second rule of fight club: There are no rules.
---
Imo it‚Äôs the most beautiful AND dreary biome. The fog/rain/mist can be relentless... but when the sky opens up.. I remember why it‚Äôs worth it 
---
Yeah uranium fever and butcher Pete part 2 would be Great songs to add.
---
Nice! Fight club. Wheres is it? I'm game.
---
Yeah, no. Your logic is faulty. They built PvP into the game and into certain interactions within the game. Bringing up exploits is nonsense. You‚Äôre just complaining about the game itself. I said this somewhere else, what you are doing is essentially like playing a football game and complaining that there‚Äôs tackling in it. 
---
Atom Bomb baby made the cut for 76, I've noticed I rarely hear it though.  Uranium is in here, but I don't think uranium fever or uranium rock made it in 76 ( I wish they did ).  Still some good ones here.  I would have rioted if atom bomb baby didn't make it.
---
If it was an option. However, I've been one-shotted in pacifist mode, so apparently I can't opt out. I've been kicked from workshops many times, simply because I'm attacked by trolls with up to 5 times my level. I pay caps, take workshops, and play horde mode, so I can collect some miniscule resource and some Purified water. I have no desire to kill any of the few wasteland human survivors, or any of the pacifist creatures like possums and chickens. If we can have a whole mode catering to those people who feel the need to wail on one another, why can't the rest of us play in peace cooperatively?
---
&gt; &lt;adds Preston Garvey&gt;
---
&lt;also makes all workshops into settlements&gt;
---
Thanks for telling me.
---
LOL at least I'm not the only one
---
Great find!
---
Hello VincentDanger, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Says xb1 and I wouldnt sell a non max lvl without showing it 
---
Here‚Äôs hoping they add more in dlc 
---
Except that the third rail is the electrically charged rail used to power subway cars, something normal railroads do not have.
---
No i was allways outside of whitespring, so not not get griefed. But still did not matter. I even had a live streamer come into my base and he destroyed my radiation decontamination arch. 
---
I built my prison now at whitespring but with no turrets. In order to lure more griefers.
---
I should add I didn‚Äôt receive the actual event reward until about 10 minutes after she died. 
---
That‚Äôs awesome, i hope if there ends up being servers for playing with mods, there‚Äôs one where we call be that size! Especially if we can fight a SBQ like it.
---
The Raiders Rum.
---
The Responders of Vodka.
---
The Enclave of Whisky.
---
The Free States of Moonshine.
---
Watogian Wine.
---
Grahms Bourbon (like burden?).
---
Vault-Tecs Brandy (we can dream).
---
That was fun~
---
You mean Preston‚Äôs great great grandsomething 
---
Does it bring you joy?
---
Someone will know what this means... my wife does... I haven't seen it.
---
Hmmm, I've not heard atom bomb baby at all, but I'm sure I've heard uranium Fever. Unless that was just me singing it while doing the event..... 
---
all good points as well as good points in the comments.  
---
I find it odd that fo4's buy/sell with NPC's was way better.  it basically allows you to throw items into a "shopping cart" with 2 sides, the player and the merchant.  The player can opt to pay for merchant items with caps or other items.  with a confirmation at the end  
---
Somehow that vastly superior system was replaced with a much simpler and inferior caps or gtfo mechanic.  
---
Why the giant leap backwards from fo4?
---
I'd rather have Preston than Cait. Preston has a purpose and a goal. Cait's just a stereotypical fighting Irish junkie. 
---

I think everyone hates the jukebox in 76.  It plays that same damn song when I go to my camp too. Made me insane.
---
Still can be a cool name. Plus you wouldn‚Äôt have to actually call it that. Come up with your own by using it as inspiration. 
---
Yeah, but the motivation to contest a workshop is supposed to be a fight over resources. Not literally just trying to make it so the other person is having a bad time. 
---
If you don't even want the workshop, don't go try to kill the people taking it for no reason.
---
I didn't do a very deep search, but I see keys on G2A for $47.33 if you want to get it for download. Of course, you have to be wary with that site sometimes, so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Target has it at $39.99
---
Leaning on Appalachia‚Äôs lore Id love to hear a robot dj 
---
Fair enough. I didn't see the xb1 bit, it's kinda hard to see 
---
But your reward comes as a direct result of someone else's suffering. 
---
In my personal business, I try to con and worm my way out of paying my workers. Just look at it from my perspective, it's just the most efficient way for me to make money. 
---
Srry
---
No a stash box let player acces the inventory of only theyre own player. So they pick up theyre stuff, drop it and i pick it up. If they kill themselves, they still spawn insode the base and are still trapped
---
Now we can do flaming shoryuken with a Power Fist
---
Dw it's my bad. Good luck with the sale
---
You can't do anything to increase the limit, that's up to Bethesda. Some tips for helping manage it is to make sure you scrap everything. Base components are far lighter than the item they came from. Also don't worry too much about storing weapons and armour unless it's super rare. 
---
Break down all junk. Don't hang on to crappy legendaries. Bulk at the Tinker's table and sell excess. Don't bother hanging on to armor unless you're going to use it. Especially if it's low level. You'll start getting better drops as you progress. Pick up perk cards for junk and chems they can really help manage weight. Learn to carry only what you need.
---
Now you had a buddy the first time-were you grouped up?  If *he* had a workshop claimed then everyone in the group would be PvP enabled (even if pacifist mode is on- which is kind of bad IMO)
---
I think I found one....so far so good.
---
Install Steelseries Engine, install the Arctis7 addon.
---
Add the FO76.exe to the games list, and choose the headset for it.
---
Plus out the wireless dongle (i.e. disconnect the headset), plug it back in again.
---
Been working nicely for me for the last half hour or so!
---
Makes sense to live in the mire and have free travel points on opposite sides of the map.
---
K
---
Nope, I mean a rewrite of lore where Preston is cloned and every time he dies a new clone is activated. Preston to appear in every current and future fallout title....forever. just because Bethesda knows how much the fans loved good ol' P.G.
---
If you cannot get a Tesla, use Molotov cocktails or a flamer
---
I'll take one when you're on later. GT is ActualGarbage68
---
Wish they'd give us a second Camp to build our shops with.
---
Thnx ‚úå
---
I guess we can't turn that record over, Butcher Pete's saga was cut short.
---
Thank You! I just took a shower and started all over again with serums.. my melee build is fixed now! 
---
Dam dupers ruining fun mechanics like not waiting in line, they should just delete the extra terminals at this point.
---
If people disagree, they should reply, as you have, and say why. Unless the original comment isn't productive, that's what the downvote button is for.
---
Sounds like a cool mechanic.  
---
Also kind of funny they are intentionally spoon feeding players a daily quest to learn all the recipes.  Gotta keep those players logging in, lol  
---
but hey maybe this will be fun and if the effects are decent it might be a worthwhile grind to partake in.
---
You've more than likely been one-shotted before the TSE nerf. Also, when you claim a workshop, a warning pops up that PVP may occur.
---
If anything you can trade them for better gear
---
I too would like to know 
---
That's the best song though! I love walking around the miner strike areas while singing that song because of the relevance to their struggles. Tbh though the score is pretty baller, listen to it.
---
Bulk your scrap. Pick up only what need.  Make a shopping list before you venture out. Keep only 4-6 specialists weapons and armour. Food and chems are varied. Sell what you don‚Äôt need to that day. 
---
But I can‚Äôt see the beautiful stars at night... and the days just seem way too green....
---
And I swear to myself I saw a pack of Wendigos the other day.
---
Lol yes it would, IF was all my HP and not the 12 points adrenal reaction is taking. So if we need to apply a newly created adrenal reaction why wouldn‚Äôt Bethesda TELL us this so we could fix it ??? 
---
There's quite a few in the pleasant hills cemetery. I usually like to go there and open them. Have found some pretty good stuff there.
---
Masochist...
---
Pacifist mode is in the game settings. 
---
Blocking players is pointless because then you can't see them on the map and if they have a friend who you didn't block they can still find you. It just puts you at an even bigger disadvantage.
---
I'm level 170 and I've never been griefed...... sadly griefers even with all of the gear they bought online still are afraid to pick on someone their own size.
---
Hmm, I already have the Engine. Not sure what the Arctis7 addon is but i'll check. I would assume I have the add on already since it's what I use to add other games. I never tried to unplug and plug it back again.
---
I'll try it tonight and let you know. THANKS!
---
Its because of the perk benefits for having low health make the damage ridiculous. Bloodied weapons do the damage that TSE used to, in the 600+ depending on the weapons.  Unyielding, bolstering for armor.  Serendipity for perks.  Andrenal reaction for mutations (when it worked).  Perks and build help make the low health easily mitigated. 
---
Hello mhunterchump, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Don‚Äôt delude yourself. There definitely are a lot of reasons people hate this game. I‚Äôm glad you enjoy it though.
---
That‚Äôs real pvp. Bethesda take notes. 
---
Seriously. Remember all the PvP in the settlements in Fallout 4? What were they thinking? and because it's Reddit... /s
---
Absolutely this! I‚Äôd give anything for personalised perk load-outs I could save. Even just 3, (home, explorer, and power armour), would be sufficient.
---
Bob Ross would've faired well in Appalachia, plenty of happy little trees for him to paint
---
Meh, that would take half the fun out of it, in my opinion as well as a good chunk of the trading. I can see where you're coming from though.  It would be neat if the survival mode has only regular weapons, but that will not be the case most likely. 
---
I was expecting the servers to have at least thirty people all the time. I imagine Bethesda did too. I've never seen more than a dozen to fifteen people. Like someone said earlier, I hope they just decrease the player cap to 20/25 and up the camp budgets by at least 50%
---
üòÜ Hahahah, yes üòÖ
---
Was this change mentioned in the patch notes ? If it was I missed it and so did everyone else ! 
---
Yup. Agreed. That all we need just 3 
---
Even a TSE wouldn‚Äôt one shot someone in pacifist mode. They were cheaters who were stacking bobble heads
---
I suggest reading this. Particularly the "in regard to voting" subsection under "Please don't". https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette
---
so you have 2 options then:
---
1) be a griefer and ruin that persons workshop
---
or
---
2) server hop and get the same workshop unclaimed
---
so its really up to you, you have to ask yourself, "Do i want to be a dick, or not a dick?"
---
THAT is the question
---
I have no complains. 
---
It‚Äôs the exact opposite of my main strength and intelligence build but my second char is going with your build 100%. I love that in 76 you can enjoy a true power armor play based on strength but your mix of strategy and stealth sniper to the extreme is absolutely necessary for dealing with PvP
---
Ive found bunker 07, anybody any idea how i open this one or has anybody even found this one? Just left of vault76...
---
Don't hoard, scrap/drop/give/sell everything you don't need.
---
For your inventory (what you have on yourself), there are perks that will reduce the weight of everything (\*) (chem, food, weapon, armor, ammo), use them.
---
(\*) except riffles.
---
I'd like it if my guy could have a smoke while I'm outside having one. Though it may give away his location I crouch in chameleon armor. On the other hand it'd be funny to see a floating cigarette
---
Forever if you have starched genes on and class freak almost fully gets rid of the negative
---
Scrap and bulk. If you read the in-game weights, you'll think bulking doesn't help for much other than lead and aluminium, but it actually does help for most types of junk. The next question you might ask is where to get enough plastic to bulk all that junk, but I think you'll find those answers in other posts if you look. 
---
Make sure you always have stash room for junk since that's the only inventory you can lose to PVP. 
---
To bulk your scrap you need to find a tinker workshop. Have lots of plastic to do this. Under the bulk option you can condense scrap down a little bit more.
---
One could say fighting the queen is similar - which groups can kill her under 30 minutes.  Or so many other PvE aspects of the game.  PvE type objectives will always be boring for those that want PvP, but that's what survival mode is for - the PvP players.
---
If only the combat was good this would be really cool.
---
Yeah, it's a weird bit of software design, but basically in the Enginee, it'll list your headset, but there's a blue bar with tiiiiny writing that says "You need to install moar software" - click that.
---
Oddly, the option to add the Arctis 7 headset is there for all games even without this addon. Logic, nope!
---
Lmk if it works, though - interested to see how it goes :)
---
You killed the ghouls at the clubhouse before I could, your reward comes as a direct result of my suffering.
---
You nuked an area my camp was in, your reward comes as a direct result of my suffering. 
---
it goes on and on.
---
He‚Äôs nothing the real boss is in the back RaGeCantalope 
---
Uranium is confusing because there's 3 songs in Fallout ( that I'm aware of ) with Uranium in the title.  ABB rarely plays, but when it does, I'm ready to take on the wasteland.
---
thanks a lot for the fast answer, yeah I'm only keeping 3/4 weapons and a set of armor, I scrap everything else, only keeping attires and cosmetic stuff, I'll just try to avoid keeping useless stuff then :(
---
Ugh god. I see so many posts about how being an ass is meant to be a part of the game. Have we, as a society, seriously become so dumb that we think ruining someone else's experience is " a part of it". 
---
Also don't try and compare raiders to FO4 ones, your actions in that game didn't affect real people. 
---
If you go out of your way to kill, harass or annoy another player then that's griefing, plain and simple. Fighting in a workshop? Totally as intended. Contesting a workshop so you can lock someone in PVP with you with no intention of claiming the workshop? Griefing. 
---
Hunting a wanted player? Works as intended.
---
Destroying or attacking a random players camp for any reason other than they have a bounty? Griefing. 
---
Can we just stop defending assholes? 
---
Yeah I know what you mean. They do reset daily, sometimes twice a day. Camden is one that if you don't do it when it pops up and logout, you lost the fuzzy tokens for that day. Least that's what I've experienced.
---
The vendor caps seem to reset before 24 hours. I know you can hit far away locations to check the ones you want though in your hop, helps to save a few caps.
---
Hehe, I just got a friend to play fo76 :D
---
I'm not really interested in the Tesla.
---
Green one goes for 5-10k Caps.
---
It sells surprisingly well to vendors, if you don't junk it :)
---
I suppose.
---
xD
---
I was think 4k with prime reciever and 3k without
---
Also wood and steel are very easy to over do. 300 ea h is ok. 
---
Thanks.
---
That's a big leap in logic. I'd assume reset would mean lvl 1
---
What awful counter points. I mean that TOTALLY justifies murdering another player over and over. 
---
thanks for your answer, what does the tinker's table do ? also yes I try to carry only essential stuff but even then I'm still at 80/170 I don't know what is taking so much weight I only have 3/4 weapons, my armor and some aids 
---
Youre not a ~~cop~~ dev are you? Its nerftrapment if you dont :P
---
But hopefully you get to keep your perk points and each lvl after you can reallocate or choose a new card
---
That's what I'm saying though.  They don't reset.  Ever.  I assumed it was an overarching bug - but perhaps it's only a glitch that I'm experiencing and I'll have to put in a ticket.
---
The timing is irrelevant. the current game rules are irrelevant, other than context. Your specific question was why remove it. I answered why I'd like it removed. I am aware of the rules of the game, I don't like them. I tolerate them, and generally don't complain about them unless questioned. Dude has a good idea. You asked a question. Pretty straightforward. 
---
Did you talk to him again? At some point he will explode.
---
Wasn't your imagination....
---
Bloodied weapons and builds are better for the SBQ because she's the biggest bullet sponge in the game. Players regularly drop &gt;2,000 rounds (or far more) into her, and the SBQ isn't really that threatening. The biggest risks of fighting her are that too many low level players will show up, or she'll bug out (error). You're often just racing to do enough damage before the event timer runs out. 
---
I came across a dead deathclaw marked ‚Äúvendor‚Äù in the Mire as well. On the main road by a deathclaw nest
---
In fallout 4, yeah. On 76? No it doesnt. It says 0 value for me. The only use for me is cloth, which I have a couple hundred of, so I don't need it. How does it have value for you? I have 9 Charisma, with all 3 ranks to hard bargain, and I've even tried, to no avail, using grape mentats to up the value. Nothing. Still 0 for me.
---
Found it‚Äôs been a massive improvement, there‚Äôs a little way to go yet, but I have a renewed faith they‚Äôll make it something quite special.
---
I would love to just see a nomad community enter WV and set up a town, then raiders follow them. 
---
Obviously the game can handle NPCs, and while the idea of no NPCs is ‚Äúcool‚Äù (I don‚Äôt like it at all personally, but it was a bold idea to have the environment and players fill that role) it‚Äôs not really what anyone wants.
---
Someome didnt "makes friends" with the deathclaw...
---
I did the same thing with pharma farma lol
---
Oh, I'm sorry, maybe I AM mixing it up with FO4. Apologies, I'll remove the comment!
---
There‚Äôs a radio?
---
Yeah it's kind of anti-horde. I had a hard time adapting from the hording in previous fallouts too. They do have cap sinks now though, lot of plans to spend on.
---
Unfortunately that link doesn't matter. Voting works just like every other system of its kind and in most cases people are clicking with the mentality of 'like/dislike', not 'relevant to the discussion/not relevant'.
---
I'll also point out that half of those rules are completely ignored by most users, and some of them are plain silly. There's a reason that link is described as 'an informal expression of the values of many redditors', and not 'things you must do on reddit'. ;-)
---
Im missing songs from new vegas. That was my favorite soundtrack

‚ÄúA delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.‚Äù - Shigeru Miyamoto
---
First impressions matter the most. Whether we like it or not. Sure, the game has improved a lot ever since release. However, even if the game manages to pull a 180 like No Man Sky, it still won‚Äôt change the perception that game is a dumpster fire. The player base will continue to grow, but will never be what it would‚Äôve been had the game released finished and packed with a variety of quality content. In the end, this is no one‚Äôs fault, except Bethesda.
---
Ideally people should try to counterpoint or dialogue, I agree. It just doesn't work that way in practice. 
---
A good way to tell if it's worth keeping an items is to check the wiki. If it has a set spawn there isn't much point wasting space unless you want it. 
---
GTA online soured me on the game entirely. 
---
This big beautiful world, full of so much to do... and all the unimaginative little shits can think of, is to grief other people.
---
It depends on the game.  And that's what has me baffled.  You probably see this literally every day on /r/factorio and /r/KerbalSpaceProgram but on /r/fo76, I find it surprising.
---
1 cap Bob. 
---
I've only googled codes after all that work why get it wrong
---
HIIIIIII OOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Niet lol
---
Trading is and alway will be a hard subject to balance. And being that the game has a player driven economy is good and bad. You have people trading to help people and people trading to make money. Why a 2-3* chest or weapon is worth 20k is beyond me. But you seem to have more than enough caps and gear and can very quickly get more of each.   Why not trade stuff you lower value? If nothing else form a trader guild and focus on trsfing one type of item to reduce your trades but still keep something. 
---
Ya it made me like the whole game less even though single player is grand, red dead 2 online is even more disgusting (microtransaction wise)
---
Nope. If it‚Äôs ever added I would hope they mention it in the patch notes
---
That works for your first death, but if you have a running skirmish where both sides die a few times over the course of 20 min, it's kinda a pain to run out of the area, break something, then run back. Plus with how people just memorize spawns, you won't always have that luxery
---
Hello Drushka34, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
I feel ya. After playing Dead Money for NV the theme of letting go stuck with me so I do my best to only carry what‚Äôs needed. And give up what‚Äôs not. 
---
I spent 2 hours looking for rad away once with a sliver of health left. It was a grand old time
---
You want an objective debate? I'm your man you can even voice it at me. You lose the debate if you downvote or get emotional.
---
The reason Bethesda SHOULD NOT reply to you is because it's a toxic question. You're a bad person for asking them to redesign the game from the ground up and you have no idea how much time or effort that would be. What you're asking for is for you to make a screaming rage post 1 week after you get your wish saying this game mode is broken and demanding they fire their employees...again.
---
#1 No game has ever removed PVP functions and never will. Dark Souls without invasions? It gets asked for but you don't deserve co-op without PVP.
---
#2 It's possible to never PVP. Crouch everywhere, be careful, switch servers if you get attacked. In Dark Souls you can over level and avoid the meta. Hiding is exciting and fun like in Dead By Daylight.
---
#3 You hate excitement - the AI is dumb. Basic. Analogue. It's no real challenge - you just jump on a rock to avoid deathclaws. We don't even have raids PVP is the only exciting thing that ever happens in 76. It's like you hate the idea of your heart ever beating faster.
---
#4 Role play is supposed to take you out of your comfort zone. It's a post apoc world not Minecraft or Stardew Valley and being attacked by raiders is a feature that you knowingly and willingly chose to enter into when you bought this game. You're attacking the theme here.
---
#5 Being social is the reason you're playing an MMO (Minorly MP Online) and the natural end game is to organize 25 players. If you play solo no one really cares about you - why should they? You're irrelevant by choice.
---
#6 If you organized a pacifist clan you could dominate any PVPer but the fact is you hate team work you want to be anti-social. In an MMO. Which is ironic. No one has to care about anti-social tendencies we know you just come to reddit to farm outrage. HOW DARE THEY NOT OVERHAUL THE GAME SYSTEM TO CATER TO YOU!
---
#7 People are better than NPCs. They can do all the same things but not as boring. We can play 76 like DbD or Dark Souls because novelty = fun. 
---
#8 Mindlessly grinding towards a nominal end game with no meaningful adversary is a bad video game. If i played anti-social i'd hate 76 too. Remind me - what was the hardest boss for you? 
---
#9 Realism should mean friendly fire everywhere not magical apocalypse wizards teleporting around with inviolable storage and power armor with the user base constantly complaining their magic isn't magical enough.
---
#10 Perhaps the best reason - most PVPers will simply leave when survival mode arrives. The real choice you want to make is to NOT have Survival or Nuclear Winter because the Dev's are too busy pandering to the lowest common denominator when Minecraft already exists.
---
#11 You want a reply from Bethesda but you're on reddit. Reddit is for fun and debates but you're probably too emotional by now, so see you guys next week when you post the same exact thing to belligerently farm outrage? 
---
You truly hate objectivity don't you. Another player challenged you to step up into the natural end game and play it up to its potential - so no doubt you're offended. Why can't Beth phrase it politely to shield your emotions from any confrontation and not some mean nasty redditor! Who even debates, it's 2019!
---
That was my thought, like maybe they created a cool down time or something. 
---
75 is just too many right now. You should have to make decisions on perk load outs. There should not be a load out that is best that everyone uses. Is many more perks were added to the game then maybe the 50 card cap could be increased, but right now it is good.
---
the end of the world D: i miss this 
---
If someone is killing me over and over do you know how I solve it? I change servers. or I respawn at vault 76, but most importantly and this here is the real secret: It's just a game, I don't take a pvp interaction as a personal insult, I move on with my life because it's just a game and doesn't matter. And if you really want to never see this person again, you can also block them.
---
It's that simple. We all have the tools to deal with it, but some people are resolute to complain instead of using what Bethesda has built into the game precisely for this purpose.
---
I don't disagree with you, but there's absolutely no reason to think a level 250 is just hands down more powerful than a level 65. There's nothing ever to indicate that without additional information.
---
I was late to my first fight club so I missed the beginning of the rules, but OMG FIGHT CLUB IS AWESOME!
---
Play it how you want to play it. 
---
If it helps at all, I love ESO (countless hours, countless builds), and yet I am also really enjoying this game.
---
Xbox one , how do you get that brotherhood logo on your post?
---
Yes gambling is a big no no. Even simulated is bad. Worst is it does go on in discord‚Äôs and other places. 
---
He's a straight shooter with upper management written all over him!
---
If you want to fix it organize a PVP event then they won't be griefing. If reddit is boring of course we'll grief.
---
You just have to figure out what you need most at this time and go from there...I'll keep an inventory of 200 of my most used junk items and only 100 of stuff I barely use but keep around just in case...find out what weapons are valuable and worth keeping and get rid of garbage...same with armor...800 is plenty as long as you don't hoard
---
Looks like a Hollow
---
if they don't, I'm uninstalling the game!
---
I'm looking forward to a round of shots before queen fights. Seems fitting.
---
If you don't agree with it, it doesn't matter, right? Using the voting button for a popularity contest discourages people from speaking their mind and contributes to the echo chamber culture that exists on the internet today. We get better through debate and controversy, not an endless circle jerk.
---
Only ones I do (rarely) are end game to get the whitesprings and bos suits, and camden. Those you have to server hop like the meditation one. It's not a daily though like camden, you can do them over and over.
---
Which ones are you talking about?
---
I do my best to let everyone get a hit on Legendaries but SBQ fights are crazy. I'm just trying not to die so I can hit the SBQ when she lands. Also a lot of players if given the choice of taking damage and maybe possibly die. Or wipe out all the enemies easily and with no real risk to yourself would take the latter
---
Fair enough.  But I know I got picked on for sure in high school. Could care less what happens to those people, and in a video game wasteland- I‚Äôm sure not trying to hold everyones hand.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone will come up with a decent idea to do it. 
---
Is there a difference between level 3 safes and level 3 locks on other container types in regards to loot?  There's a level 3 tool chest I believe in the Steakhouse that I've found CAMP plans in.  There's also a level 2 in an adjoining room I've found CAMP plans in.
---
No worries, just keep the positivity flowing in 76!
---
Nice list. 
---
We have 56 now (since you start at 1). Having 20 more cards would make my rifle build more like my friend's rifle build, so I have to say I like it better now. The limitations make our choices mater. He has more stealth. I have more crit. With 20 more points we would probably build towards each other. 
---
Even with 20 more cards, I would still be switching out picklock when I wasn't using it. I would love the ability to save card configurations, but I really don't need more active cards. 
---
To be honest I was thinking about where certain decent items are.  I have no idea how I want to play it yet, which I guess is kind of refreshing for a game.  Having just finished Metro Exodus, F76 should tickle a different nerve.
---
ill need to verify this independently..... for science.
---
will need those digits.
---
As a friend, I wouldn't try to get any of my friends to spend money on this game. I spent 40 bucks and I enjoyed my roughly 100 hours getting to level 90 or so, but with the current state of affairs I don't see much longevity in this game, despite bethesda's claims for it post launch.
---
If a level 50 did it I would assume they would go to level 1. But if a Level 75 did it they should go to level 25, if it works that way.
---
Fair. Most people are slinging TSE now so confirming hits is neigh but possible. 
---
Look up what the viable builds are after most recent patches.  
---
I had an unarmed/no power armour character that needed to move to a different weapon class.  I had to do this as you'll need power armour for end game, so either plan for PA or get ready to do the slow migration of points post level 50.  
---
I swapped from unarmed to rifleman, as I had some perception points/cards already.  I got to play for about a week before they gutted the rifleman build.  So I would be going with shotguns/melee if I were you.  Maybe heavy weapons if that's your bag.     
---
As far as junk collecting, look at your end game plans and start hoarding junk for that.   I had a shit ton of cloth/leather/adhesive at the start, but those were for basic armours, not the end game sets.  
---
Try to get all the quests done without being carried, I had a portion of the end game speed run by my buddies, so I never really got the feeling of achieving the final few quests.  
---
Lastly, try and find value in reimagining your camp.  I'm not a minecraft guy, so I didnt love it, but that seems to be where all my buddies are spending a lot of time.   
---
Lastly, don't buy atoms, you'll get all you need from completing challenges in game, and some of the skins are cool.
---
They could even make them earned so every 5 levels you could take a pack of perks or a new loadout deck.  Same as they did for respec. 
---
That's actually a goddamn good playlist :)
---
I am shamelessly stealing it :P
---
I can't disagree with that!
---
The first thing I can relate too is the ‚Äúbad rap‚Äù kind of making my purchase hesitant as well, regardless I found this game to be amazing! I should also mention it was my first fallout game I tried! 
---
As for tips, I suggest going to nuke and dragons to check out the perk cards and figure out which ones to take, go grab a pen and paper and then write down the perks you think look cool or irresistible! 
---
People will tell you melee builds are the best, and honestly I agree, however I am playing the way I want to, but by doing that I may have screwed myself over for end game pvp.
---
If you find perk cards you like look up builds revolving around them or make your own, 50+ you can swap a stat around or grab a perk card so basically you can fine tune a build or save up points to move onto the next op build!
---
Last thing I want to say is, don‚Äôt rush and enjoy the game, there aren‚Äôt npcs but the holo tapes help you get into the lore and what happened before you shown up! 
---
I hope this helps man! I highly recommend looking at nukes and dragons fast! Make a build you wanna play, then use the level up feature to get an idea of what perks you should grab when!
---
Take your time, do the quests, and try to enjoy the details.  I missed a lot plowing through and had to go back through to really appreciate the little stories.
---
Also stay to the northwest and west part of the map to start with.

There's a huge difference between holding a person's hand and actively out there trying to murder them.  Never know when you might want another gun on your side in a fight, why try to add to the number of guns pointed at you?
---
lol. This game, like all games in the past decade, is insanely hand holdy. No training wheels? Are you blind and deaf?
---
Well luckily if something worked for you then it's going to work for everyone always. That's how solutions work! Just because people have the option to ignore or leave, doesn't make shitty behavior any more acceptable. And it is just a game, I get that. But we're also talking about you, or whoever, essentially hunting down someone either in passive mode or just not trying to participate in PVP and killing them anyway. There's no excuse for that, you're just an asshole.
---
Nope. That's a result of latent memory.
---
As per the game' s statements. 
---
How many hours approximately is the main game?  Forget end game stuff, just doing the main story line?
---
AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGH!!!!! Lmfao I feel like a total moron !! I could have had these plans by just searching omg!!!!!! That guy in YouTube needs to die!!!! As of this morning it‚Äôs at 513 tries !!!! And all I had to do is check shelves ???WTF!!!  My hats off to you my friend for educating a blind  man!!!

Follow the game for most part up till you reach Morgantown and it‚Äôll open up. Your most used weapons will be pipe and hunting weapons which for the early game will give you enough mods to make a good gun. And mostly just have fun. Make two characters. One to mess around and learn and to really play and perfect. 
---
Sure, I always enjoy looking at other people's camps.

Most likely get a Parody version of Thomas called ‚ÄúTommy the Miltiary train‚Äù or something. (Reason why I went with tommy was because they would call Americans toms in WWII)
---
After being on this subreddit i've seen horrible, petty and toxic ideas where Bethesda replies uselessly too often but the games are too impatient. Here is a list of the pettiest:
---
Bethesda needs to hire new people.
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Anyone feel like FO/76 would have been considerably better as co-op only and not PVP?
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can‚Äôt kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I‚Äôm quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Please let screws be one of the materials gained from scrapping weapons, like in FO4.
---
Free Fast Travel between stations?
---
All Bulked Items Should ‚ÄúWeigh‚Äù Less than the Sum of Their Components. 
---
Travel Agent perk-lvl2 move your camp for free or at a reduced price. Lvl3 fast travel while over encumbered(free or pay caps)
---
Instead of expanding the storage limit, how about craftable Stash boxes with weight reducing properties? 
---
Give. Me. A. Fridge. 
---
For the love of god make VATS stop targeting friendlies if i'm in passive mode. 
---
The studio's enthusiasm needs to match the player community or we won't have the stamina to last until changes are made
---
Bethesda please give us the ability to either sell or scrap ammunition 
---
My one wish from Bethesda is more stash space
---
Now that all the duped items are gone, can we get an increase on vendor cap limits?
---
Let technical data stack, and give us a bigger reward for more data.
---
Let us keep learned plans across our different characters
---
New stashbox to trade between your other characters
---
Thanks, I'm on the PC though but cheers anyway!
---
Sounds cool, simioar to what I was thinking as well.
---
+karma months of frustration and anguish all for not.............
---
Absolutely agreed! Have a Gold on me!
---
I could see that being an issue down the line. 1-30-50 for decks and your good. Level 1 for combat.  30 for crafting. And 50 for non combat. 
---
Once you leave the vault, all bets are off.  People‚Äôs motivation can be all sorts of twisted by the Wastelands.
---
I avoid Rad-x and radaway and just use decon arches when I've sucked up too many rads, I never keep them on me as I kept using them by mistake. Nuke Zones when there is one seems fine in PA no need to use them.
---
ive never actually traded anything that high, that 103k has come from trades as little as 500caps to 3k per item  
---
just been doing it for ages 
---
Relax and enjoy, it's a marathon not a sprint. 
---
And/or cola nut?
---
If I could brew nuka cola......I like that idea.
---
Weather guns exist in game files, and maybe we'll see them in game one day
---
All of the ones you get under the Daily Quests column on the quest page.  I was able to the Red Rocket one three twice and the Queen of the Hunt twice before they stopped working-  I was also getting the one in Grafton where you have to get rid of toxic barrels every day when I logged in when I lived in the toxic valley - but now I get no Daily Quests.  
---
Sometimes when I log in I'll get the misc. objective to visit the pumpkin house - but I don't like that quest so I usually ignore it.
---
I spend a lot of time wandering around and I would think that would trigger events nearby - or even talking to the npcs give the quests but that doesn't work either.
---
I've been several over-leveled in a game where levels didn't matter whatsoever - while it doesn't correlate to power at a certain point, experience and hours spent increase probability of better playing/gear. I hear you on this. Not always true, but a large possibility!
---
If people are bullying each other, then doesn't that mean they both want to do it, by definition?
---
Those who don't want to take part shouldn't have to, I agree.
---
But those who do want to, should be able to.
---
You're looking at roughly 80 or so hours to do the main quests and side quests, especially going solo. 
---
Must be pretty stressful working for Bethesda unless they all stay in each others company outside work too.
---
The hazmat suit spawns down to level 1 so there isnt really an excuse, 
---
Fair. I limit myself to 1 big buy and sell a month or week depending on what I got on hand. 
---
Normally will sell an item for 500 at best unless they really really want it. 
---
Sent it again  lol , sorry new to the Reddit protocol!lol!
---
If you want to try let me know, always happy to help out a lower level.
---
Yeah until they do more in regards to music I'm jamming to Run the Jewels on spotify. Goes good with pvp üòà
---
Hell yeah, I just moved to northern Arizona, haven't been to vegas yet, but now i have to lol
---
Exactly, I really hope I get into it.  I have to say, I really enjoyed F4, that's one of my favourite games ever and yet that got a bad rap for its story, which I thought was good!  I mean, nothings perfect.  I realise F76 reviews are far worse than F4, but even so.  
---
Sometimes, I wish social media didn't exist, that way nobody would feel "guilty" or, be vilified for enjoying something that we're not supposed to!
---
Well, Legendaries have been around for long time. Getting rid of them now would, as you suggest, suck the fun out of it for many players. Legebdary-free play would be a niche feature for a select few, of which I count myself among. There are other games for that, I find we play Fallout for it's other charms, as combat has always been something of a trainwreck
---
Well... my suggestion is... go find it for yourself. Honestly. Explore, find recipes and plans, find items of clothing, find holotapes and listen to the little stories and vignettes.
---
Seems to me that asking people to tell you where to find stuff is just going to shorten the game's shelf life, isn't it?
---
The ratty radstag 
---
Totally.  Your completely right.  Post Edited haha.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs awesome, i hope if there ends up being servers for playing with mods, there‚Äôs one where we can all be that size! Especially if we can fight a SBQ like it.
---
That brings to mind the image of the SBQ being dragged down and torn apart by a horde of tiny little men in power armor.
---
It's a fun image.
---
Pleg?
---
The small text looks weird now... 
---
No the change wasn‚Äôt mentioned. Someone data mined that they have nerfed the mutation so that you need much lower health for it to activate. If I can find the post I‚Äôll link it.  It is disappointing that there hasn‚Äôt been a fix yet.  
---
Me and friend can take her down every time. I use a aa gatling but the ts gatling works too. He uses a bloodied 50 cal. We both run tenderizer and stablized until she's almost dead and jump out of pa (stabilized only works with pa). Adrenaline and one gun army, + strength perks for heavy guns. Have to bring 2 guns because otherwise you have to repair at the barn. Endangerol syringer every 2 minutes. Most of the people down there aren't doing anything to her without aa.
---
Ah, an interesting loophole. Alas, he's confessed he doesn't understand how workshops work, despite his playtime.
---
That's and he and I had logged in at roughly the same time, which wouldn't have given him an opportunity to stake a claim.
---
It may just be an Appalachian oddity. Like Mothman, or the Flatwoods Monster. May Atom spare us all
---
I‚Äôm excited about this brewing. My character is a rugged mountain man and brewing moonshine in my cabin will certainly help with this image.
---
No. You think the grind is meh no. It‚Äôll be non stop nuking the queen and result in really bad instability 
---
It pairs really well with the Adrenal Reaction mutation, which is basically the same effect, but in a mutation. So you get to double dip on having low HP. Going to sub 10% is risky, but as long as you have a friend to revive you, it's fine, and with the revenant perk, you can even get a temporary additional 50% damage bonus for 2 minutes after reviving.
---
this is fan fn tastic!
---
bad bot.

Because if you slap somebody with your left hand, it doesn't make your right hand innocent.

I think it is random, it can be any if the lockers. In my case it was a the 5 section locker under the B marked doorway
---
I thought it went without saying that they‚Äôd implement the suggestion in such a way that does cause the game to stop.
---
Server hopping is not a game mechanic though. Contesting workshops is.
---
Contesting workshops is not griefing. All of you whiny crybabies need to get this through your heads.
---
Stop working*
---
Yeah, that's 4 AM for me or I'd roll a new toon with ya.
---
And disappointing Bethesda didn‚Äôt tell anyone !! It‚Äôs really sad how they are treating their players :( 
---
Here's another take on that subject from a couple days ago as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aup3vq/skyrim_had_dragon_souls_reenable_scorchbeast/
---
Further info in this post including a response from a CM. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asde5w/patch_broke_adrenal_reactionbloodied_weapons/
---
Alright man, you seem cool.
---
Bloodied pairs well with high rads, which is good with radicool perk (+5 str). That alone gives you a melee boost.
---
With low health, theres no reason to not dilute all the stimpaks you can, otherwise youd just be wasting regular stims.
---
Throw on a few pieces of unyielding, and youll have your strength up to 30. I think my carry weight is ~370, not counting weight reductions.
---
I could stand to add some more END, im pretty fragile (it seems even more so since patch 4).
---
If I get swarmed by the wrong mob, im pretty much dead.... Or one col. Gusty, lol.
---
PA makes survival easier, but I dont do as much damage.
---
I‚Äôll take anything for loadouts to be honest.  Anything that lets me spend more time actually playing the game and less messing with my cards/inventory.
---
Right on the money.
---
My stash is 100% scrap and bulk materials. Not by choice. I do sell them but I simply don‚Äôt have room for anything else. My camp is permanent so I don‚Äôt build and I‚Äôm melee so I don‚Äôt have to repair that often. My camp includes junk extractor so I accumulate it, which is great for daily vendor sales. You can get 1400 caps a day simply by selling to bot vendors. I try to do that daily. Constantly selling weapons and scrap to keep my caps at limit. Then picking and choosing exactly which weapons and armor I want to keep for me and treat the rest as inventory. 
---
Don‚Äôt hold onto Weapons that are more than 10 levels away from where you are. If getting into vendor market, know that 1* Weapons and Armor are virtually worthless, with few exceptions. I dump all mine in river or random containers in wasteland. 
---
You‚Äôll get used to what is heavy and what isn‚Äôt. Try not to depend on perk cards that reduce weight. Those points are best used for other things. 
---
Just don‚Äôt hoard. And if you succeed at this, teach me how. 
---
Good luck. 
---
There is nothing more enjoyable than stumbling upon a players beautiful, well built camp and exploring it. After taking it all in, demolishing it to the ground is so rewarding. Laughing as the player returns to their base only to find toothpicks left bring lots of joy. Why would they want to take away this simple pleasure from adventure mode? 
---
Hmmmm.... funnel cakes....
---
I think it would be too much. Maybe add a npc bot that rewards you for killing her. Or even the Overseer over PA system. 
---
I was thinking the same thing until last night. I owned two farms and a power plant. Went back to by CAMP and the whole server disconnected.
---
Loaded back in and had no control over any farms or power plants
---
Would mind that system either, tbh something the positively reinforces player progression in a somewhat predictable and meaningful manner.
---
I wasn't excited, then I was when I read it and though "Hey now I can kind of open up a bar in my settlement" then I thought "There's only 20 players per map and no one will know where my camp location is so there's no point"
---
Welcome to The Thorn!
---
Eh, in principle I agree with your last point about debate. But I don't see the agree/disagree use of voting as simply a popularity contest or circle jerk, I see it as an efficiency and clarity measure. Let me explain.
---
You will fairly often see comments with dozens or hundreds of votes. If all of those votes were people voicing specific opinions and counterpoints you would end up with an absolute mess. There would be so much repetition, branching, and argument... the discussion would become convoluted and likely off rails in no time. 
---
However, I think being able to vote in agreement or disagreement with specific points gives an indication of the general response to the particular ideas being laid out by the most passionate/informed/invested commentators. It's equivalent to going to a debate where you can either force everyone to speak, or have those who most want to speak guide the discussion and have the 'audience' respond to each contribution with applause or boos.
---
That, to me, is a more appropriate system when you have debate and discussion involving potentially hundreds or thousands of people. And it's also a matter of convenience on the internet because many people don't have the time to engage in drawn-out back-and-forth exchanges with various other posters. 
---
Clearly I'm not one of those people, haha. 
---
Amen.
---
I've always felt that White Springs, and the train station in watoga were both player hubs.
---
White Springs for obvious reasons: The  massive crafting area, vendors, and enclave bunker.
---
Watoga train station because it's the goto spot after doing a queen fight.
---
Turrets are useless against 90% of the pve enemies.  Anything with a gun generally just snipes then out of the turrets range. Mole rats always pop up behind them or inside your base. The only enemies I have seen them work well against are dogs and ghouls and even then sometimes they just refuse to fire and if your in a higher level area they are useless for the amount of budget they take up. 
---
Maybe it was brushes? Or both. Don't remember.
---
It'd also be nice if doors actually attached to the frames of doorways in brick walls.
---
ah, and now the "dick" personality reveals itself.  
---
Pretty much on point
---
OMG - thank you so much - never had an award before!
---
I went into my profile and added a flair. Bunch to choose from. 
---
As for the paint, are you turning in 1 or 2? I got mine from 2
---
Is this bait? Because as much as I trust randoms due to my nature I am skeptical that you might just 1 shot me.
---
poor chap
---
Use your perk cards. Literally can walk up to enemies and they won‚Äôt know you are there. Beautiful. 
---
I'm not an expert, but shadowed works only in shadowed places. Didn't work great for me.
---
Muffled might be nice with escape artist, haven't tested.
---
UL is out just because I fell in love with sleek. You sneak as fast as you walk. Awesomesauce.
---
My main concern is the later portion of the post in regards to positively reinforcing meaningful and predictable player progression for killing the end game boss. The souls is just an illustration of that implementation. For all I care it could be some form of currency that in combination with a time machine the player uses to travel back in trade with all the dead NPCs for legendaries.
---
no pics?
---
Or even the bots from nuka world that sever. 
---
Craft Brews are the future. 
---
Sometimes he gets stuck. I've done the quest successfully four or five times, and I've gotten him stuck on a rock twice. It just depends on where he spawns and where he is trying to go.
---
Definitely not.  I am not a high level (90's) and to be honest I get killed more than I like to admit. I have been hit by baiters before and it ticks me off.  I am on twitch tv  (TwistedMamaLlama) and you can check my vids...I am not in it to hurt other players. 
---
Sounds like this Mire man is running out of fresh meat, so he needs new neighbors :/
---
u/hopstar doing good work on Reddit. Bless Him.  :D 
---
Yeah, I talked to him several times. He just says ‚ÄúHello there!‚Äù And nothing else happens.
---
The problem goes back to duped gear.
---
Duping caused everyone to max out on caps and now nobody wants caps and won't even trade for any weapon if it isn't bloodied/explosive and if armor isn't unyielding/assassin's with sentinel/cavalier you don't have anything worth trading for.
---
r/deconshowerthoughts
---
On the Anthem Reddit they were trash taking this game because it had better ratings and complaining that Anthem was getting picked on by the reviewers. And they also complain about the game getting a bad rap lol.
---
maybe it is something to do with the power station? I think there is one a bit to the north, but I could be remembering wrongly.
---
I‚Äôve done 1,2,3  19,30 at a time doesn‚Äôt matter and apparently the plans have been laying around venture and defiance and I‚Äôve been ignoring them thinking it was the same plan over and over  !!! F my life 513 times I took the big L for nothing!! I was given plans the night before for free but it‚Äôs the principle of earning it that drives me mad!!!
---
He spawned south of Point Pleasant and had nothing blocking his way. Oh well.
---
there‚Äôs a power station up north, yeah. i‚Äôm gonna go check it out after i craft more ammo. i‚Äôve never heard it up until now which is weird lol
---
One of the best tips is to collect literally every weapon you find ( off an enemy / in containers etc) just to scrap later , this is because scrapping a weapon not only gives you a few materials but also unlocks a random modification to that weapon , this is something I didn‚Äôt realise until I was like level 30.
---
&gt;second tip 
---
Don‚Äôt spend all your resources modifying an early game weapon , for example a level 5 pump action , this is because you‚Äôll find much better high level weapons the more you play and if you‚Äôve committed yourself to a fairly poor weapon early game you‚Äôre much more inclined to purposely not use or disregard other better weapons simply because they would weigh you down or smtn üê∏ 
---
Agreed. I always check red toolboxes for plans. I've gotten many CAMP plans in them. I picked up the lightboxes plan today out of an unlocked flat red box.
---
&gt; Well luckily if something worked for you then it's going to work for everyone always. That's how solutions work!
---
Yep. I am absolutely confident 100% of players can respawn at vault 76 instead of the nearest POI to their death, I'm similarly confident they can quite to main menu and rejoin to a new server. No doubt whatsoever on this.
---
The only assholes here are people who look at the game and cry "no no no! the devs did it wrong! pvp is for toxic people!" The devs knew what they were doing when they made pvp a core feature, are you saying they're incompetent?
---
Its a minor and known glitch. Theres a random event where a vendor/wandering merchant appears (it spawns in dead) surrounded by various dead enemies.
---
Well the vendor either wasnt coded in with the right skin and appears as a deathclaw or it could be a throwback easter egg to Fallout 4‚Äôs talking deathclaw merchant. 
---
Either way it spawns in dead as a random encounter just like the fallen satellites and such that appear in the wilds.
---
Hahaha! Fantastic! We ended up going and getting revenge on him (I was at my base just around the corner), he definitely tickles... But I absolutely love that the game can be so immersive that you jump out of your seat =P
---
I‚Äôd go with a repeat quest that gives you medals you can turn in. The whole story is for to kill her. Reward us for doing just that. Not with just random loot. 
---
Make so we get one medal every 12 hours. And can still kill her for loot. At the end of the week when nuke codes reset we can turn in for something. 
---
I would come back if it in fact became great again. Not until and I consider that a waste of purchasing the Tricentenial Edition. But hey, at least I game Bethesda my initial support. Mayne they should earn it next time.
---
The blast zone
---
Unfortunately, your idea is a bit too much easy mode, to me.
---
5 Queen kills for a full set of 3* armor, and I choose the perks? I could do that on a Saturday morning before lunch (and I don't get up early on Saturday).
---
What would be the point for me to play after lunch? I have nothing to aim for.
---
I don't want easier 3* loot.
---
What I want is the perk cards to be expanded to balance things out (Hi, can I haz lighter rifles please?), legendary affixes to be rebalanced (I mean, Junkie's? really?), and a greater range of viable builds.
---
On the back of this, I would like some more challenging quests which maybe guarantee me a 3* (or more than one), which I can farm, at the cost of time and ammo, to GRADUALLY build towards an interesting build. I'd also like to be surprised by items, and maybe change my build ideas if I hit a golden item.
---
I'm an old grumpy gamer, but an experience I had way back in the mists of time convinced me that the grind is what keeps us playing. Specifically it was Diablo 2, the realms. I really *really* wanted some runewords, and this was pre the patch that upped the drop rate. I bought the runes I wanted for $10 or so from an online store, and know what? Wrecked the game for me. I made my shiny words, logged out, and didn't play again for about 8 years.
---
There's a balance. FO76 isn't there yet with it, but it has potential. To put it on tap like you suggest would not encourage more play, it would encourage less players, and I don't want that.
---
Not sure why you guys keep thinking 50 is the top notch for everything... there are builds that revolve around gear starting as low as lvl 35/45.
---
I think a lot of people, including ‚Äúpapers‚Äù (this games pvp is shit as we all know) put to much into level of gear also. 
---
Stats can get too far, at higher levels they take you into stupid numbers but, a lvl 35 with handed down god roll gear will mess any level up. To give you an example, the difference between a lvl 35 pump shotgun and a lvl 45 shotgun(max level for a pump) is 10 damage. 
---
So my point is, don‚Äôt think so far up in levels, you can be super over powered and tanky at Lower lvls too.
---
That does sound interesting.
---
Queen of the hunt I know works. A jump to harpers ferry gets that one. Yeah maybe something with the quests you have active. I finished them all as reference.
---
The armor makes a sound when you go invisible the mutation does not. 
---
You're a trip.
---
Sound like metal falling or creaking. Or yeah the power station 
---
thats a lot of prints
---
Tell me about!! I'm absolutely loving it and trying to get my friends to get it on Xbox to play with  me, even told them it's only like ¬£13 on cd keys but none of them are really even considering it, mainly due to all the bad press around it 
---
Thanks, but i'm on the PC.  Yeah the cards/perks are the one thing I think I needed help with.
---
Considering how vague the description is and that so many people didn't know this bethesda needs to make it clearer in game. 
---
I think it's really important that someone from Bethesda see this post. I - and many of my friends that I okay with to include my wife, my son, my best friend, and a couple of coworkers - all hate the PvP aspect. We all want a PvE-only option. We're not Rust or Fortnite players that came to FO76 for a new map on which to run around shooting each other. We're RPG players that wanted to share the game experience with friends. 
---
I think it's important that Bethesda hears this message repeatedly. 
---
nothing from the power station when i checked it out. it‚Äôs too well timed to be metal creaking i think
---
Oh yeah I forgot Shrouded (on wood armor) which I am using now to good effect.  Had wendigos sniffing at me and still not finding me.  Just wondering if I should change to ultralight marine armor or some other set up.  I am hearing weight plays a part (wood is very light).
---
The numbers don‚Äôt necessarily have to equal out to 5 queen kills, if you or a person implementing the suggestion wanted to make it really hard perhaps make it 100 queen kills to achieve the same result. 
---
I do like your quest idea though.
---
Rofl =P I still find the Wendigo slightly worse though... Maybe it is because I knew what to expect with the Mothman, as it was the GF who tested those waters and alerted me to their shenanigans... but the Wendigo had a similar outcome. I saw it off in the distance, I shot it, and it came at me so damn fast I shit myself.
---
I also LOVE the train tunnel (can't remember the name). It was the first time I experienced the Scorched being "frozen". You expect them to just be the ash statues, then when you get close BAM they come at you. It was very sneaky and one of the most memorably experiences I've had playing the game so far! =)
---
It could just be raider deco. 
---
Oh yes, have agility 15 and sneak perk maxed.  Just wondering if there is a point at which I could trade my wood armor for something with more dr and still be just as stealthy.
---
i hear that sound at times and also that weird hollow drum sound [in the distance].
---
these have to be some kind of audible ‚Äúindicators‚Äù.
---
I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been wrecked by anyone under level 50 before. The problem with your theory is most of the good gear is found by people that are above level 50, so the gear scales to 45-50. To find the really good gear you usually need to trade. So it‚Äôs kinda important to get to 50 minimum. Gear is usually the limiting factor in builds
---
On the positive , you‚Äôll be a player that will be very set for the legendary vendor coming in May.
---
Or as others suggested, materials dropped from queen kills could be used to exchange for valuable items such as a decent quantity of flux.
---
Yeah having an option for "total price" instead only "price per" would be very nice. 
---
yeah! i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre some kind of indicators, i wonder for what..
---
Are you talking to a ghost? You‚Äôre not replying to anyone and not notifying them that you replied to them.
---
Yep, more stablefor me too!
---
it's a new game **mode** though. So not a one time event.
---
So I have 2 points then, to clarify:
---
1 - 100 kills isn't hard. It's not. A person with a lot of time to play and a high boredom threshold can already do 20 queens per day if they join some of the Discord Queen-Killing groups out there. They'd be maxed in under a week. Similar issue if you put it at 1000. Which leads me to point....
---
2 - If you make a single event like this the guaranteed treadmill to success, you effectively delete every other activity in the game. I mean, why WOULD I hop about the map looking for interesting areas and mobs if I could go to just ONE place and get everything I want?
---
Sorry man, I am not knocking your creativity at all - I love that you have the passion to think about how to make things better. I just think this is not quite the right angle. My opinion only, of course!! :)
---
Isn‚Äôt that the sound of a robot being spawned at Watoga or any of the Modus sites?
---
I thought I was the only one that heard that. I made my whole stop and listen one night. It drives me nuts! 
---
so betheda is teaching us to be drunks. yay
---
this.
---
*if the character you are roleplaying is a dick out to ruin people's time, you might just be a dick out to ruin people's time.*
---
shadowed is kind of boring once u hit lvl 50.
---
i had all my armor all shadowed with max Agility and max Sneak and enemies would rarely notice me... even in lit areas. i dumped all the shadowed attribs and i even have sneak down to lvl 2 and that still works very well without suppressing PvE engagement.
---
does anyone know how Shadowed affects PVP, though? to me, it seems like everyone can see each other on hud pretty easily.
---
I see "many more" but does anyone have a close-to-reality actual number of new recipes that will be added? I'd settle for a "more than" number or "around" if it's available.
---
Pretty much same here, but reversed. My fright warned wifey about Mothman, and her squeal of terror in the Wendigo cage warned me about it (not sure what she expected with the cave‚Äôs name, but oh well).
---
i-is that a thing? i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was, but i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve found either of those yet. i‚Äôll have to investigate
---
I removed all mutations, reapplied all with serums except Adrenal, waited an hour then took Adrenal. I have had no issues except for the one time I died and my dps went from 300+ per shot to 88. I logged out and back on and it fixed itself. I haven't died again since then so I don't know if the same debuff will happen.
---
My grandmother would be so proud of you.
---
very true lol, just clear out all my stock
---
Uh yes, or have you not played the game? I mean it's absolutely riddled with bugs. Just out of curiosity now like.. have you been playing since it came out or are you just starting? I'm going to guess you've seen literally NO bug reports or anything? 
---
SBQ flies off of map? No prob
---
Power armor used to glitch hardcore? Gotcha 
---
Benefiting from another players suffering? Works as intended. 
---
Also I don't think you understand my point, if you're fighting over a workshop then that's how it works. If you're going out of your way to kill a stranger simply for the experience, you're an ass. Hunting a bounty? Yeah that makes sense, or if they fight back then sure thing. Chasing someone in passive mode shooting them until they die for scrap? Nah that's being an ass. Why do people not seem to understand that at it's core it's supposed to be a fallout game. Like sure, it has new features with other players, but regardless of what the devs have said it seems most people want a genuine fallout experience. That doesn't involve being hunted down by a stranger online over and over.
---
I did it once to see of I could.
---
After that I ignore the officers. Really should do it again to try and add some extra challenge back into the game.
---
i think the drum sound may mean camp or workshop nearby. my camp is close to a workshop and nearly every time i go back to camp i hear that weird percussive sound. there is also usually a camp a little ways from me too. 
---
My educated guess. Either the 4th. When the Free VTU letterman from the atom will become unfree or the much more widely expected March 12th, the beginning of wild appalachia
---
&gt;smoking
---
&gt;ap regen
---
I dunno about you guys, but when I was smoking I did my three mile /slower/, not faster lol.
---
Maybe something like less sway while sighted for a short time.
---
That being said, I wish we could do the smoking anim too.
---
Well, thanks for acting as sounding board.  I guess I will have to contact Bethesda for a fix.
---
Now that idea I am good with :)
---
Good, good, let the hatred flow through you Anakin
---
I'd kill for a respec or for the passive perk cards to be permanent. Or for that matter the FO4 perk system, I really enjoyed how that was set up.
---
You have 21,000 caps? The most I've ever had at one time was 1,600.
---
Crackdown 3
---
It's dangerous to go alone. It's dangerous to go in groups. It's just dangerous out there....
---
I run a stealth build myself and pre-patch before sneak was broken shadowed and muffled is the way to go if you want pure stealth. Can walk right up to anything and it wont notice until its dead.
---
Go sleek if you want to crouch walk everywhere.
---
Chameleon armor while not stacking in the invisibility aspect does stack in stealth bonus. So 5 pieces of chameleon armor is pretty much the same as a maxed sneak perk card.
---
Shadowed is great for indoors or the mire area.
---
Ultra light doesnt really affect stealth so its more of a convenience thing and is ultimately up to you.
---
Muffled is nice if you pvp alot or wear noisy armors which is perfect for a predator style pvp player.
---
Sleek as far as i can tell makes you crouch walk almost as fast as a standing walk and doesnt seem to affect detection much while crouched.
---
+1
---
So how about the mountain of bugs that make this game borderline unplayable? All my energy guns are still borked, heavy weapons are almost useless, and various mutations no longer work. 
---
Maybe make the base game stable before adding more content that will inevitably be riddles with yet more bugs. 
---
I wanna do something involving Atom. So like, Atom's Apple or Atom's Spittoon, something like that.  
---
Hahaha I hated it too, but I couldn't help but giggle at some of the shit from it. The robot's voice in particular... exactly how I picture the DMV to be lol
---
It sounded more like the alarm machinery makes when turned on?
---
No worries. I suppose I have a different outlook, I don‚Äôt enjoy constant repetition and monotony so with regards to point one and two I presume people like me wouldn‚Äôt do those for hours on end. The alternative would being doing different things within the game that are dynamic because seems like a better use of time and more enjoyable. Although, I appreciate your input and perspective.
---
That‚Äôs what I started yesterday !

Sounds like you need to run a yard sale.    
---
"Going out of Business so everything must go to make room! No offer will be refused!"
---
that‚Äôs what i was kind of thinking, it was very alarm-like. maybe like someone above mentioned, it could be robots being spawned or created
---
I actually run a full heavy combat armor set at all times  with stealth build and rarely get seen. If weight does play into it, its not by much. Basically made a stealth tank with a set of vanguards heavy 
---
Sounds like the power station, odd to hear it that far away from it though.
---
The end game challenge spike is a bit ridiculous in regard to the nukes or your first queen fight say around lvl 50-75  were others were at a similar level and not decked out head to toe in the best weapons and gear. 
---
hi I've been trying for long time to get the marsupial and the mutation that boosts movement speed  PSN id FritoZ
---
I'll be on tonight after 7 pm central time and all weekend probably
---
Wrong. The materials used to make The nuka colas would sell for more than 1 cap a piece. Unless your concern is that after expending the cap limit on every vendor people could "abuse" this to get more caps. Which that can easily be countered by saying, cap smashes exist, nuka colas are easy enough to find, there are countless ways to make caps than just brewing up nuka colas. Still a concern? Ok brewing nuka colas uses 1 cap pet bottle. Easiest solution. 
---
Falloutdew Valley
---
Yeah brewing is nice - BUT I WANT THAT RED VELVET WALLPAPER FOR MY HOUSE!
---
Come on Bethesda!
---
I laughed the whole time. That was a very well done quest. It was very original for a game quest, and it was so dead on in it's effort to make fun of the DMV. That was great.
---
I got mine in Grafton, but not at the train station - there's a vendor bot named Greg in the town itself and he had them.
---
It's fine the way it is, just set aside about 30 minutes to hunt and collect food and wood. 
---
Maybe something that performs much like diablo 2 trading..?
---
Different sounds to my ears
---
maybe you were in ear shot after someone powered up its power plant? I dont know how often monongah gets booted up.
---
Just another station that plays "player music" as in the music on my xbox. Or stream from a service. 
---
I don't care what anyone says...I LOVE this game. For every a-hole out there, there is someone way more creative that does stuff like this and keeps it entertaining. Thank you.
---
which power station, monogah?
---
Also if you ever need food, the racetrack up near vault 76 has a good chance of either spawning molerats or mongrel dogs with about 10 a wave. 
---
Excavator Bright Head lamp is all I need.  I don't need anything except this.  That, and this ashtray.  That is all I need.
---
I totally vouch for this 
---
I server hop a lot at spawn locations of power armor because there‚Äôs always a fusion generator around with a fusion core or two
---
Take a workshop that offer them. Kill sentry bots, whitesprings ones work 
---
Having caps be an actual item might solve this. If caps are weightless, you can store them in your stash so you don't have to have 25k caps on your person at all times. 
---
I -am- was always out of fusion cores and never have enough plastic for shells. 
---
Edit: What am I saying? I haven‚Äôt booted up the game in a good two months. 
---
strange- i haven‚Äôt dabbled much with the power stations, it‚Äôs weird hearing this so late in game/my playthrough. 
---
 I just dont use power armor unless I feel like I'm gonna do something tough normally I just wear regular armor
---
Is this why I never seem to find extra stimpaks? I haven't been using my perk correctly? Ffs
---
It's called Depth of field. Can't google it for you right now but if you google Fo76 Depth of field disable you'll find it.
---
The radio stations on the pip-boy. You can find radios out and about and turn them on though.
---
Lol ye. Its easy.
---
Just vendor item normally and sell legendaries to other players.
---
You know never what items may be very expensive just sitting in yiur stash box
---
&gt;Ultra light doesnt really affect stealth so its more of a convenience thing and is ultimately up to you.
---
Not necessarily true, according to the in-game guide. Armor weight is one of the few things that directly affect sneaking.
---
Settings: Depth of Field. Turn it off. 
---
"I'll fuckin' crank ya one!!"
---
Oh. I‚Äôve literally just been listening to music and the like on my phone while I‚Äôm rooting around for bits in bins.
---
Wish i saw this before my recent post.  If using the mining helmet with excavator helmet in inventory, is the +100 perk kept?  If I remember, I will update this when I confirm next play.
---
The mole men for me are the scariest because of the back story. Trapped in those suits....slowly going mad. \*shiver\*
---
I mean, I get where you come from there, but at least cait didn't have a settlement for you to help every 2 seconds. And he overall dialogue to me was a lot less annoying, in general
---
There are 2 farming routes I like to do.
---
The first is over in the cranberry bog, where I basically start at Harper‚Äôs Ferry, then Camp Venture .. then I hit every fire base around to Watoga and sell. I kill and loot mobs at each. You get a chance for a few plans, mods, ballistic fiber, etc.
---
The second is in the Ash Heap - I start at Big Bend West then Rollins Work Camp, Red Rocket, the trainyard, up to the mine, across to Belching Betty, Air Purifier and the bar basement there. End up at Charleston FD and sell. Sometimes I do it in reverse to use the stash box at the station near Big Bend West.
---
I do a combination of walking between these and fast traveling (if possible).
---
I think something Fallout 76 has done very well is handling the classic Fallout humor. I felt that Fallout 4 didnt have many funny moments but Fallout 76 really does. The highlight to me are the hilarious terminals in Watoga showing all the previous mayors. 
---
To be honest, in single-player Fallout games, I've always felt a little frustrated that everyone is focused on their own self interests. It kind of holds them back. Take Fallout 4 for example, can you imagine the the super nation that would emerge if all the factions could work together?
---
I see Fallout 76 as that opportunity. And really, it's also kind of the message of the game. Yeah, I could shoot you, but scorched beasts are annoying enough already. And the great strength of man is to pool our abilities until we conquer anything in our path.
---
I don't mean this as a criticism of PvP or those who enjoy it. Only that this is the reason I'm drawn to cooperation and those who share that feeling.
---
It's not hard to get basic food (Mole Rat Chunks and Mutt Chops) - but the complicated food isn't worth it now, IMHO.  Do you use the harder recipes?
---
I‚Äôm looking for 10 violet flux. How much would that run?
---
What is this the, thing we don't talk about?
---
Monongah is the closest to your point on the map, and I hear that exact sound every time I fire up Poseidon.
---
Nuts to that. You all left and ditched me before i woke up. I get the picture...üòâ
---
&gt;I personally like assisting players from afar... sniping enemies for them as they fight, and then vanishing.

not 60 hours... but a solid 30, for sure.
---
I do everything, sbq fights, solo nuke silos, farming all of it.

I never change my setup, for pve, I stay at 40% as super dps isn't required. I keep dirty water with me just incase i need to get more dps.

This I did not know. Sonofa‚Ä¶. all that meat. 
---
Nah they arent worth my time. I just stick up on some stuff that'll fill my food bar and equip some perks that make food weigh less and be more beneficial. 
---
Well i was hoping with the Update i could make my own Nuka Cola, save me having to go for a run, waiting for a respawn and then doing it again, if we could make it then i could spend more time making caps
---
He probably shouldn't have bought all of the best weapons and armor in the game.
---
It's always the impatient ones who race to the end of the game who are the first ones to start crying about the game being boring.
---
Must be a 513 thing, I don't steal other people's shit either. 
---
ill take that as an answer. thank you kind spirit for answering my annoyances lol
---
Weight definitely plays a part. Check out the in-game guide ("help" in the menu) about sneaking.
---
I'm rocking legendary Weightless Marine Armor w/ Ultra-light, which makes the armor literally weightless. I can sneak into a group of 5 enemies in broad daylight and stealth kill all without breaking "caution".
---
Fist night happens after, we don't talk about it
---
I don't know for sure, since stealth actually has a pretty complex formula affected by numerous factors. But I do know that weight is one of the factors that is affected by stealth, so in an ideal scenario, the lighter your armor is, the less it affects your visibility most likely in the case of ultra-light and lighter builds.  
---
However, with escape artist, one of the benefits of this perk is that running no longer negatively affects stealth, which means you gain no penalty from moving around at full speed in sneaking mode, which also probably means whatever benefit of muffled offered is probably no longer useful, since you're already as quiet as you'll be with that perk regardless of the weight of your armor.
---
Shadowed on the other hand might further increase your stealth capabilities in dark environments because it's affecting something that isn't already nullified by your perk.  You gain a small boost to stealth in dark areas when using it.
---
Sleek will allow you to move significantly faster while sneaking, which means you can get around faster while sneaking and constantly avoid enemies getting closer to you.  It has excellent synergy with escape artist, because your running speed while sneaking doesn't make you more visible.
---
Overall, I'd argue you actually don't **need** any of them, but I'd definitely consider sleek since moving around faster is always nice.  And the reason I say that is because with all the sneaking perks and 10 agility, even without legendary armor, you're perfectly capable of sneaking and being invisible to the majority of enemies in the game.  
---
I've thought about modifying my armor to see if shadowed, or muffled makes any difference, but something tells me it wouldn't really be that noticeable.
---
There are very few enemies that come to mind that can actually detect me, and the ones that do are either scripted to detect you, or they are fast enough to get close enough to see through your stealth.  I think it's possible to go overkill with stealth, so you certainly don't need 15 agility for example to be stealthy, unless you're deliberately try to max out AP or something.
---
The first time I ran into a Rad Storm in Fallout 4 scared the shit out of me. I had no idea what was going on.
---
To me the entire point of explosive weapons was for the area of effect or splash damage that they do to groups of enemies.
---
Now why a primus super mutant with a missile launcher can take out a quarter of my health but mine does 1/8th of his is beyond fucking stupid.  There's a clear Balance issue going on.
---
As far as Normal missile launchers go, they are vastly underpowered and shouldn't require a level 5 perk equivalent to gunsmith if doing explosive weapons makes you overencumbered so easily, not only do you move slowly while aiming, if you don't point blank hit enemies the damage is negligible.  The splash damage is inconsequential.  And at 20 weight with just the launcher, and 2 per missile, you can't actually play with that weapon in a useful way, if you try it breaks on you fairly fast.
---
Some solutions, everything but exploding legendary weapons, frag grenades/mines, and plasma grenades/mines need to be firstly buffed, secondly weight reduced on the ammo of not the weapon itself, thirdly, explosive splash distance increased.  If you shoot a grenade from a grenade launcher, it better firstly explode for serious damage on point blank enemies and hit surrounding enemies for a decent fraction of the amount of damage it deals.  The range needs to expand beyond 5-10 meters, this incentivizes explosive weapons to be used at a distance, and properly hit groups.
---
If the ammo is going to be so damn heavy then I'm assuming its packing a serious payload.  When that shit goes off it better actually do decent damage otherwise it's junk and a junk jet would be preferable.
---
What's it matter though, they're not going to do anything but break stuff more as they add stuff instead of fixing stuff.
---
Whatever floats your boat.
---
When I first started the game I'd server hop over and over until I'd find a full suit of power armor, and I'd stack up so many fusion cores that way. Or if anything I'd definitely dedicate a game session to just farming fusion cores off of the power plants. I know it takes a long time but they're definitely worth it, they make a lot in a small amount of time. 
---
Also don't forget, T-60 armor is the cheapest to repair in terms of materials in case you use power armor often
---
I assume it's a copy right issue. 
---
Usually people leave in the register in the main shop
---
The statement above is one I can get behind!
---
servers will probably go off around 9am to patch like every other time. no telling how long it will take though.
---
Then I trust that you could use the search bar yourself to check if you really wanted to, ha
---
To be fair, a higher level means generally longer game time.
---
This is time they can spend fine tuning their character, getting mutations they want all the perks they need, legendaries they want and making adjustments to SPECIAL to iron out weaknesses in their build.
---
For example, I‚Äôm level 50 something and because of my weird dedication to a cowboy/ fudd build and extremely casual playstyle my character is actually pretty weak (I‚Äôm used to Bethesda single player games where you can do whatever and come out a god) 
---
Maybe a battle royale? 
---
If you read the OP Off Topic: wasn‚Äôt to take a workshop It was to screw with the user

there's actually a lot of settings you can change with a custom INI file.  The blur was one of the things I hated that caused me to look for solution, and so far I'm happy with the experiments I've done to fix it.

I didn't go all the way down the list, I'd suggest starting with some of it and seeing what happens, and adding more once until you're comfortable with the look.

Actually u can see all three perks if they are certain legendary mods are specific. For example U can see two shot  in the name. Then u can  seevthe secobdary mod in the guns description.  then in the stats if u see 1 perception. The last legebdary perk is plus one perception. Only seen this a while ago. But yes it's terrible and needs to be changed around to ve more user friendly.
---
I lost my mind when J47 showed up
---
Either the lease ran out or BGS couldn‚Äôt secure the rights. Or the publishers pulled out when the game started in bad shape. 
---
This please! I just want to ask what their intentions were on some of the mechanics of the game. 
---
Its not a bug with the game it is a bug with mods.
---
Agreed just say you‚Äôre RP asshats. 
---
Stop calling it something else
---
Not true, dude stole my junk after I one shot myself recently. I actually suggested flagging for pvp as a change if you take someone's junk, as well as making it more obvious that the junk was from a player's death, and everyone basically told me "You died, you deserve to lose your stuff, you should not have any recourse, suck it up you baby, you're bad and you should feel bad". It was so much hate you'd think I just said Fallout 76 is the worst game ever or something.

Even cheaters who were stacking bobble heads (when that was still a thing) can't one shot someone in pacifist mode. See video.

I'm 100% with you there. There's so many areas where improvement could be made, within the framework the game already has. Events - there should be more of them, and maybe a hard mode you can choose! Internal areas (like West-Tek for example) - make them proper dungeons. I should not be able to clear the place in 5 minutes, then server hop to do it again. Scale the number of legendary enemies with the number of players, maybe. Put a timer on it even!
---
More random encounters - ambushes! Let me fight for my survival, not choose the most convenient or profitable places. Make it WORTH the fight :)
---
I sense we share a passion for this game! I love it and only want it to be the best it can be. I'm nearly glad we don't agree - the more viewpoints and ideas the better :)

u/Jullz-Wolf Ever use a lever-action rifle? I play on PC at least, but it's the most accurate rifle I've come across. Sought revenge on a bloodied build attacking me in the 'trenches' outside of Watoga and one-shot him immediately.

---
Oh right it's a patch day, so they will do it during normal maintenance window. Hmm. On the one hand, I hate taking time off if I can't actually play that day, but on the other hand, with this being full pvp, I assume it's going to be VERY cutthroat, so getting ahead of the pack is going to be important.
---
If you ever just wanna drop junk in a place where most likely someone will see it without just dropping it, the blue suitcase in Watoga Station and at Whitespring Station are my main deposit boxes for my excess stuff.

Tell me more about the hookers.
---
So bringing up exploits is "nonsense"?  So you are saying there are no exploits related to PvP?
---
And no, what YOU are doing is essentially like playing a football game where some of the players are tackling people in the stands or sidelines and being surprised that they are being complained about since "it's a football game, the players are expected to tackle people!"
---
Drives me nuts to see this as i drop 5 to 10 cores a week. They need to work out a better way to trade 
---
Lol, I get it. I personally didn't mind the settlement missions constantly being thrown at me. It gave me something to do. I just really couldn't stand Cait's accent. Harvey was the man trying to make it happen for the people of the commonwealth. Cait was just some annoying tag along junkie. I can't even remember her companion quest (if she had one).

If like to be able to have lots of paint jobs and put them on ANY of my PA sets. Like the BOS paint job - why only T-60 when the reward for the quest line is Ultracite??

some of the mods people install into the game is currently messing with atom shop items. you need to modify some file to get mods to work again. I dont use any so I didnt mark down what modification you need to do.

I have no idea how people DON'T have like 200 cores sitting around. Take all 3 power plants. you get 3 fully charged cores every 15 minutes from each. Even when I was using gatling laser full time I was swimming in them.

well they already said you can use your current character (and even freely move between server types) so there won't be much "getting ahead". so you could always take wensday off instead.

There are... _places_ that spawn a significant number of cores within a reasonable amount of acreage that you can walk in a matter of minutes and pull down 5-6 cores (and maybe some low level legendaries from the locals). I've shared mine before, but I'm getting loathe to since I think players should really figure it out for themselves.
---
That being said the 'easiest' way to pull down a number of full charged cores in a couple of hours without a lot of work is to take over a power plant workshop with a fusion core generator like Poseidon, Monongha or Thunder Valley. Sure you gotta baby sit it and you might run into an asshat level 200 that steals your cores or brains you with a sledgehammer (or as is likely, both) but that's the price you pay for a reliable steady income of fully charged fusion cores.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I have over 600 levels across multiple characters. I also have a level 23 character. It's probably not a safe assumption that lower level = lower experience. My character has also had all the mutations I plan him to end with since level 2. The only thing he needs is the next 34 levels so he can get his cards set and is able to use his equipment
---
There is going to be a big bug fix that comes out with this, too, fyi.
---
Thank you!
---
This. Maybe every 1-2 weeks I take the workshop at the power plant for a few hours. I have over 30 in my stash at the moment.
---
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but these seem kinda lame. I think I'm truly craving more meaningful content like me guns, new gun mods, new plans, new meaningful quests, new enemies, new factions (LIVING NPCs). More legendary statuses for weapons and armor. More armor types. More outfits, more perk cards, etc. Actual meaningful content.
---
These brews just seem kind of gimmicky and pointless. See: A waste of time that devs could have been spending on giving us more of the above I mentioned
---
Exactly.
---
Yeah, but in a search zone the size of a car.
---
Does anyone know if these skins will release soon?
---
Definitely on board for more event and variants in events rather than just re-skins of kill this fetch this 
---
Thank you very much kind sir.
---
Why not...76?

Spam bot pls report and get this trash off reddit

You don't have to try to convince people to play good games.

NPC experiment could be Faction based locations not present on vanilla world. Once you gain access to a faction, there's a fast travel point that takes you to an instanced faction hub with appropriate NPCs. That way they don't interfere with the vanilla world if that's a problem, but also provides a real hub for factions. 
---
They already have nerfed about four times now.   The place is nothing like it was around release. 
---
Too green? Then.. add some red! 
---
They backtracked on that didn't they?
---
I guess that deserved down votes?
---
what ive noticed, people with higher levels get better stuff, I have 2 high 90 charaters and I dont find very good legendaries even with 15+ luck I find crap. I followed a level 201 around killing scortched beasts and every time I got a plan for an ultrcite weapon mod, which I dont ever find by myself. the other day I heard another level 200 scream like a girl when he found a serum note from the scrotched queen, which once again I ususally find a buch of garbage
---
Possibly, I suspect it is more about how Anthem is two different games combined into one and players of one type tend to not like the other very much but you are forced to do both.
---
Wow, I didn't even realize there weren't expert and master levels for Iron Fist. How did they miss those.
---
It‚Äôs my favorite biome! 
---
Pretty often you will find just junk in these level 3 safes but it is a good way to farm higher level armors and weapons for breaking down to learn mod plans, finding plans for weapons and armor, as well as treasure maps which can lead to a larger variety of loot. While I think it is worth it to open level 3 safes I don't know if I would push for "farming" for these specifically since they have such a long loot cool down timer. I tend to just hit the same safes that are on my daily routes and eventually accrue the loot over time.

Fight Club cake is not a lie.

I haven't seen any data mined pictures yet. The Bethesda rep on here did say they are working on skins for the suit now.

I agree it would be cool if there was a option to weave the factions in fallout 5 together and I think the experiences without pvp are much better but me and my friend were just bored lol and it sounded fun as I'm level 76 and havent properly faught anyone yetüòÖ
---
not that I have seen, but I am not a big pvper so I might have just missed it.
---
Very surprising. I started a new PVP specific character to get ready for survival mode. Half the time I can't run into someone around my level (12) without a level 50+ holding their hand. Really kinda kills the player to player interactions with people under 50 whom are close in level. 
---
I just wish they‚Äôd change some perks to ‚Äúpassives‚Äù
---
Like is it really necessary for me to swap some perks out to pick a lock, then swap them back as soon as I am done? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm personally weaker or anything since the perks I swapped out usually aren‚Äôt damage perks anyway. 
---
You are very welcome, now if I can figure out if the drum thump I hear all the time is weapons fire in the distance I'll have one less annoyance myself!
---
When I am in Watoga, I do put stuff in there but that is usually on my morning run lol. In the afternoon I go hunting for cores and stuff for other folks so I can share. I try to stick close to home by myself. Not good at shooting and melee is subpar. When the hubby is on I don't mind exploring. Lol. But, will definitely keep all the suggestions in mind. Now of anyone can figure out why I cannot hold more than 225 in my beautiful Nuka Cola armor I would be stoked. I am having to wear nasty excavator armor [I think that's which one it is...the ugly yellow boxy one] to just be able to have extra carry weight.
---
Indeed. The one and only, finest fighting establishment in all of Appalachia! Now also showcasing team weapon battles in our larger new arena, glad you've heard of us!

If you're on ps4 and would like to schedule to have a team in our battles message the Fallout 76, Fight Club 76 page.

Whats your PSN?

It's probably coming from Mononagh Power Substation MZ-01, which is just to the North-North-West of Sunnytop station. Pretty much all of the substations seem to make that sound regularly.

I don't know how anyone runs with a gatling laser (or plasma for that matter) for five minutes let alone full time. They take forever to spin up, barely do any damage when they do spin up and they break before you even burn your way through a whole core.
---
Oh god, I can already see Caravan being played by everybody and understood by none.

I try to keep all three powerplants running during all of my playtime. This leaves me with 90+ cores at all times. Another great benefit is having free fast travel locations.

There is, it‚Äôs called fireball

I played at launch but haven't played in probably about a month since no substantial changes have been made. I'm well aware what a trainwreck 76 is.
---
&gt;If you're going out of your way to kill a stranger simply for the experience, you're an ass.
---
Your opinion. My opinion is people who think like you are the asses. Neither of our opinions matter though because the developers make the rules, and guess what those rules are? Open pvp. We have a developer **on video** talking about how PvP is a core feature of the game and that players change block and change servers if they're being harassed by someone. We have a developer on video saying that he understand some players might not like pvp interactions, but he hopes that being exposed to new experiences(pvp) will help them discover something they might enjoy, a method of gameplay they had never considered before.

Obviously, "C.A.M.P. vending machines" make Vault 76 is player hub. Cause it's safe nuke zone and free travel point. Every piece of ground around will be littered with tasteless structures.

Maybe that's what becoming a "legendary" character means.

So looking forward to this quest line coming

Currently only 2 on weapon artisan. But at 100% it breaks really fast so at 200% it would last twice as long but still seems to break pretty fast 
---
Yes, but class freak is not a convenience perk, its for builds that use mutations. Weight reduction perks are not required for any build, unless of course it is a mule/trading build.

You‚Äôre able to make bulk junk (if you have the plastic) and make ammunition there. Bulking junk is great for selling, as that‚Äôs the only way to sell some things (such as wood or bones) to vendors.

Not to mention that I hadta pay 5k in caps for my TSE Handmade a week or so post nerf. I got lucky with the 10mm SMG. My Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet &amp; Grognaks Axe are both 1* so they're not gifts from the RNG Gods or anything like that.

Not our fault you couldn't hold your liquor!  We were always telling you to know when stop!  You're lucky we dragged you to your bed and didn't leave you face down on the floor.

I make a run through watoga and there are 3 very conveniently placed PA spawns i always hit up. Nice little power core supplement if you visit watoga often, without really going out of your way.
---
There's one right in the middle of the city by the downed virtibird, one at the top of the emergency services building (chance of multi stared legendary enemie at the top level). And one at the top of an adjacent building next to another downed vertibird (building next to the civic center).

I like your idea. as it stands I am currently carrying around canned dog food, pork &amp; beans, cajin rice &amp; beans, ect because other foods tend to spoil before I need it.

They need to hammer this saying into the Bethesda higher ups.....
---
Today one of my friends (he hasnever played a fallout game before) argued with me because i was playing fo76. His reason to hate the game is "no npcs".
---
Game has issues but its nowhere close to unplayable. And they think its unplayable because of bugs and shit which makes me go mad.
---
I played the beta and the game long before I watched the reviews or saw what other people thought about the game.  I don't disagree *at all* with the poor critical reception, most of the reviewers make excellent points.  Of all the reviews I watched (after I had played it) not once did they mention a negative issue that my buddies and I hadn't *already* dealt with first hand, to the extreme detriment of our play experience.
---
It's fine that you're enjoying the game, but the game has a laundry list of legitimate problems and issues.  I think the game would have done much better if it had been non-open world co-op, as most of the game's problems stem from how the game interacts with the servers and the inability to quick load when your save temporarily or permanently breaks.
---
Thank you, that does make sense, and yes I want the 15 agility for the AP.  I always seem to run out just as I need some.
---
I would love to be able to max out shotgunner and slugger. Id be super happy with 75!

You're absolutely correct!

I was actually trying to start a faction on Xbox based on this. Nice find. 
---
This, like many things, is a technical problem.  The server starts to wig out when you concentrate too many players in one location.  The game wouldn't function well from a technical standpoint, even if it would be nice to have from a design standpoint.
---
I'll upvote for visibility

There are what that makes who what?

False, unequivocally false. Restate your comment with something actually true.

Maybe just limit them or increase the budget.

I personally use shotgun turrets do to the lag.
---
Why do you think, the only way for item/item trade is to price the item with 0caps? Makes no sense to me. In all my item trades, the items get a near market price. Just talk in advance with the other guy. I just write them, let's price the items with x caps. They answer, yes. So in the worst case (wich never happened to me), u earn caps. That's it.

take over a workshop that produces them or at least travel to them- 9/10 other players leave the generator unlocked.

Well at least it would probably be a bit better than the AMA that THQ Nordic decided to have on 8chan the other day, lmao.

we might beable to. depends on how the whole "decorate with items in your stash" thing works in april.

There are perks in the game that take advantage of alcohol in the game, this update will be useful to them.

I would take 10 frag grenades instead 10 missiles
---
Ha!!! That's fabulous!
---
I mean a level 250 **absolutely** has more refined gear than a 65, unless the 65 was a reroll/alt.  They also likely have a full perk card set.  I didn't have my full set of perk cards by 65 but this was largely because the game kept deleting my cards.  So a level 250 likely has a better legendary weapon, which can make a drastic difference in power, unfortunately.
---
I love everything about both of your comments
---
Really?  Where do you go after flatwoods?
---
While leveling, they're one of the best weapons. They absolutely shred high HP, low armor targets. The problem is how they scale so poorly with high DR targets, and of course, they do break fairly quickly compared to just about anything else. With Gunsmith rank 5 and double durability repair, they do last a more reasonable amount of time, but I used to go through 3-4 fighting SBQ. If AA worked for energy weapons (it currently doesn't, which IMO is complete horseshit), they would be reasonable. IMO they should absolutely have some energy resist penetration on them to make up for the low per shot damage. Fact is, if all weapons had equal DPS, the best one for sustained Damage would be the highest damage, slowest firing. That's really unfortunate imo. The Fallout 4 / 76 DR scaling is really bad in that it so heavily favors high damage per shot weapons and leaves fast firing, fun weapons in the dust.
---
I just make a mental note of where power armor or fusion cores spawn in the areas I frequent and swing by those spots every now and again. Every other week I might take a power plant workshop and power it up. I keep full charge 2 (strength) active most of the time because sprinting in power armor uses up the charge really fast.   
---
When I was really in a pinch at lower levels (25-40), I used to do the Ash Heap run that /u/voodoogroves laid out. You don't have to do that run many times to build up a nice little reserve. The only flaw of that run is when the Scorchbeasts won't leave you alone. 
---
Yes they do!
---
You can't tell if players are running mains or alts. That's the whole story. 
---
I agree, this seems like strange timing on the release of this content to me. I love FO76, I'm probably close to 300 hours in, but I want meaningful content, not gimmicky brews. How about some new weapons, armor, mods, outfits, perk cards, quests, etc?
---
You‚Äôre not very good at comparisons. You‚Äôre just being absurd. You live a very sheltered life. Stick to single player games.

1.The "Caution" or "Danger" continue even when there are no enemies around. I can walk halfway across the map or fast travel and I'm still in the those modes.
---
2.Is there a reason gouls run 10 times faster than any player? I didn't know the Flash and an unending amount of his clones were turned into ghouls in the Fallout universe. 
---
3.Enemies seem to know where I am after shooting one despite the fact that I have maximized every stealth option, armor and weapon. The radius for these enemies to know exactly where you're at seems to be about an in-game 1/4 mile. 
---
4.I'll mention again that my secondary equipped weapon continuously becomes unequipped when fighting enemies. Example would be that I have a lever action equipped and a shotgun in my secondary slot. I can check it any number of times before going into a known area of enemies and as soon as I get into a combat situations with more than a handful of enemies, hitting left brings up my fists instead of the shotgun that's supposed to be there. I can't count how many times it's happened and it's been happening since your last update. 
---
5. I would also request you put the damage back up just little on the explosive and two shot weapons. Right now they're no better than the "Powerful" guns in Fallout 4. 
---
Some items I have I wouldn't sell for 25k caps. Maybe this should just get fixed
---
That‚Äôs a lot of resources for the game remember.  10 pounds is really not that give a deal.  And tbh at this point in the game. No one really cares what power armour you have or are making. They‚Äôve seen it I‚Äôve seen it everyone‚Äôs seen it. If anything allow to see what‚Äôs on the frame when we inspect it. 
---
Amen to that.

Take too out sorry my phone super small so when I try to erase something and don‚Äôt get it all it does shit like this lol üòÇüëå

Id like to see maybe any rpg at level 15 missile launcher at 20 javelin or tow type at 50. Some variety would level out and make the lackluster damage of missile launchers more palatable.
---
If you can fit it in to your build check out Power User as a perk. I don‚Äôt use PA all the time so when Im running around in it I put this on. 
---
Also keep in mind VATS seems to cause an extreme drain on cores. I‚Äôd go through 3-4 an hour when doing optimizing for my vats build and doing a nuke zone. Outside of vats I go through 1 ever hour or two
---
What a terrifying vault and mission that was.
---
Can we look into patching the glitch for Energy Cell. Weapons on the PS4? I've lost over 1,400 cell rounds due to a glitch. Every time I fire any cell weapon, it depletes my ammo to zero. It's happened on 2 occasions already. 
---
Hmmm sounds like you were following 4 people an got in there way, stealing their kills.
---
The turrets in Line in the Sand always glitch for me, with rockets frozen in mid air when firing at the SB, I agree that they are a graphical nightmare. They could be tamed down but changing to 50 cal seems reasonable.
---
Of course, an item trade window is what we need. But till then price items with 0 caps with strangers, is weird to me.
---
Oh yeah - the creepy dude.
---
In fact, forget the hub.
---
You think that's bad, I have Friends telling me Fortnite is better then 76 
---
When you can have 70% disease resist from Well Fed and Hydrated, 50% from Antibiotics and another 20% from Vegetable Medley soup, you probably can't get a disease. Add the Disease Resist perk and you can probably pop radaways and still not catch anything.
---
They were like that in 4 if I remember. The radius is basically set to a "1" when it should be a "10" or even "100."
---
Lemme tell you though, if you hit something, it's pretty much insta-death.
---
Try it out on a sleeping Ghoul, frozen Scorched, or Mega Sloth. Basically something that doesn't move.
---
Regular Nuka-Grenades, on the other hand, are NEARLY as devastating, but with a much larger radius and much easier to acquire materials.

It's honestly just bad design.  People clamor for perk deck but don't realize they have no way to limit you from changing them on the fly in combat at any moment via a single click.  They almost needed to separate perk cards between convenience cards and combat cards and give us a separate pool for each, but there's not much perk card diversity within the game, due to an extreme number of repeat cards (3 cards per weapon type, multiple cards that do essentially the same thing such as weight reduction cards, i.e. there's a reduction per weapon type, meds, etc, just bloats the pool without really adding anything to game-play) + cards that are either bad or broken or highly situation (looking at you green thumb/lockpicking/crafting cards).  
---
I mean the problem is they switched to a moddable perk system but kept the design from a locked-choices system.  Stuff like crafting perks/green thumb/lockpicking would be meaningful choices if you were a permanent choice.  A mid-way point would be a semi-permanent system such as you can lock-in your cards at Vault-76 and have to return to swap them out.  This means you don't get screwed over by a completely permanent character in an ever-changing live world, but at the same time the game isn't about constantly juggling your cards when you run into the specific situation.  The problem with the mid-way system is it only accounts for the non-crafting swaps, so it would just make crafting more tedious.  I honestly think though, with how badly they wanted us to craft and how vital a part of the experience it is, many of those cards should just be default or not exist at all.  It almost seemed like Bethesda got mad at us for not 'making the right choice' of speccing 3-5 int on every character.  If there's something that *every character* is supposed to have it should be default otherwise what's the point.

My original pipe revolver was rifle based. Hardened receiver and had mods to make it good at range and hip fire. With a short scope. Made work of everything until I got a level 25 Lever. Don‚Äôt remember the ammo type.

Currently uninstalled, when I played I kept a quad pipe rifle for the explict purpose of getting rid of all my .38 rounds. It was the only pipe weapon I used.

Right down to the hordes of ghouls walking in aimlessly out of nowhere.
---
Yeah we'll see. I'm definitely excited for survival, the legendary vendor, shear terror!, and ever upwards! Wish they would've started with more of a bang though.
---
I mean sure but a 250 *for sure* has had the time.  A 65 may or may not be an alt, there's still a little bit of information there.
---
If you can craft all the mutation serums, you can effectively keep all the negative side effects suppressed by drinking a serum once every hour. It is a convenience perk. It's just a HUGE convenience. Those 2 freed up points in luck could be a huge advantage. Likewise, healing salves have a greater tactical advantage over stimpacks, but they heal less so you have to carry much more of them. I'm not saying weight reduction perks/class freak is for all builds, but there is an argument to be made for some builds. The goal is to find a way to make a build that requires as little weight reduction as possible, but depending on the situation it can be necessary to have some weight reduction.
---
But I get the impression you just want to be right. 
---
That's exactly what I think as well. 
---
I have all three maxed and tried the tier 1 perks for 30% and I noticed I was much weaker than having all 4 maxed. 
---
Your name made them run away... I would :)
---
No it's a decorative piece from the atom shop
---
Yeah they probably can only change *future* Adrenal reactions and can't do anything to the ones people already have.  They could still have a better ad-hoc fix for this by giving us an adrenal reaction-removal serum but generally speaking they don't seem willing to broadcast/admit that they've made a mistake and keep it hush-hush as possible.
---
Thank you guys very much!
---
The Mire is where my camp is and usually use a crossbow most of the time at present.
---
My mutations will subtract/add an additional time seemingly randomly when zoning in and out of indoor chunks.  At first I thought it was just a display bug but no it actually adds or removes the stats.  I had thought this would have been fixed by now.
---
Yes, B would be a more efficient use of three agility. You'd add those three 10%s together for 30% total vs 20% for one rank three card. You just add those together and apply the bonus to your base damage. Bloody mess is the only weird one where the bonus comes at the end after all other bonuses are calculated.
---
I found a red one(wandering around the marsh picking flowers), picked it up and then it disappeared from my inventory during fast travel(which does seem convenient)... or I am rapidly going insane

no problem.

Speaking of a bang, friendly PSA reminder that energy/laser guns still do not work properly. They are severely underpowered and break wayyyyyy to quickly for the amount of damage they deal.

That's not really relevant. Workshops are PvP zones. If you don't want PvP, don't take workshops. This is not complicated.
---
I think bad weather (rain, radstorms) should cover a larger area and last longer.
---
Though 50 will likely not have optimized perks since some perks only unlock at specific levels. I mean how many of the level 1-10 perks are considered optimal for play.
---
I‚Äôm strongly against having legendary pipe rifles, and most definitely against 3 star wood armor.
---
Why I‚Äôm against Wood armor: It‚Äôs kinda a bad drop in the first place, but having 3 stars on it pollutes the opportunity to find better Legendary 3 star gear, such as a Bloodied Explosive Faster Fire rate minigun.
---
Why I‚Äôm against pipe revolvers: Although any weapon can be powerful in rare cases, it‚Äôs not enough to deserve legendary drops. Vynilic Puma made a video on this weapon in Fallout 4, and it hasn‚Äôt changed, it‚Äôs still a boatload of ass, and it will purely pollute the legendary drop system.
---
They could improve the RNG system a little bit, but until then, there doesn‚Äôt need to be more garbage.

The hype is about having something to do.  At this point a quest that ends with usable toilet paper for portapotties or toilets that flush when connected to a water purifier would get me excited for a few days before the novelty wore off.  And then more content will come.  The pace of new content will likely always be an issue for folks with a lot of time to play.  I feel like a ran out of stuff to do a couple weeks ago, others did much sooner.  
---
You're gonna get these feral hands.
---
There really isn't much information to be pulled from it. I've killed level 60's that have gotten pissed and brought back their mains that are twice my level, who I also killed. Level isn't telling you anything, we just want to think that it does
---
I'm guessing that's why he says 65. Probably minimum level to get some meta build without relying on RNG from card packs.
---
Might be bugged. The base one says 12/hr. But I get 2 from each. Capping me out maybe 6 a day. If I play from 12-12
---
Wendigo, Scorch Beasts and Deathclaws are my all time favorites.
---
Wendigo are the stuff of nightmares... love it!!
---
Perhaps a better question is how many people solved the code WITHOUT a website tool BEFORE Modus put up the complete key word? It's challenging but not insurmountable to solve at the end of the week, but it's nigh impossible without any part of the initial keyword. 
---
So I am going to be super hopeful, but the summer DLC is called nuclear winter. 
---
Maybe some snow will come in through that DLC!
---
It could be a hidden bunker revealed, air tight and scorched free
---
the people who bought it during the sale would get angry. They bought an item that was a limited run so they could have a cool unique skin, but if it was brought back it wouldn't be as unique. Prime example say you buy one of a 200 limited run replica t-60 statue based on in game suits, youd be ecstatic that you have one of only 200 world wide. But now they decided to mass produce said statue again to gain more profit, your one of 200 doesnt matter because it's no longer special it's just another mass produced item. Yes still cool but not rare anymore. Now I'd assume the downvotes are the people that disagree with your opinion of returning sale items.
---
Yes they should be instanced for all event players, regardless if they just showed up halfway through or how much damage they did (or didn‚Äôt) do.
---
It‚Äôs not taking anything away from me. I play solo usually, so I‚Äôm used to putting in all the work anyway. It might incentivize more players to show up to events to loot. Then maybe more trading or teaming up would happen too 
---
Didn't read, your behavior was too hypocritical long before the giant toxic wall of stupid shit that no one is going to read because you sound like a dumb ass seeking attention.  Even a tl;dr can't save that giant obnoxious post you made.  Just delete it, do us all a favor.
---
I had no marker at all, so perhaps it bugged...? Had to look up online where to go.
---
Adjust picture settings on your TV to taste. I pretty much do it endlessly. Also consider adjusting DOF in your in game settings. I preferred no DOF effect at first but I‚Äôve since grown to like it. Whatever gets me most immersed. Even if there‚Äôs aliasing or whatever. If it works it works.  
---
It depends on you. It is a good game at the current price. There will be a lot more content added in the future. 
---
That's about what my base ones are producing. The two industrial ones I have say 60/hr - which they DEFINITELY are not producing even 3-4 an hour. My small purifiers are producing more than the industrial ones
---
Don't waste your money on it you can buy games that are worth your money
---
In Fallout 76 you only take 3+ I think Rads for a few seconds each.
---
The only thing missing is having two robots at the windows while a dozen other robots are hanging out behind them doing nothing useful.
---
I did 2 this weekend and got crappy mid level 2 stars both times. Also we were barely able to get her. Both times we had about a minute left.
---
1) Its fun. I like exploring.
---
2) Its fun. I like all the little stories you can find.
---
3) Its fun. I like how all the big stories that giude the stories tend to flow together.
---
4) Its fun. Some of the quests were amusing to do (making friends with a deathclaw or the dmv come to mind for short one or chains like the mistressof mysteries)
---
5) Its fun. Its just fun to play.
---
bonus 6) Its fun. Interacting with people, be it being cornered and killed or saved at the last second or just finding someones camp as you run around.
---
That is true.
---
Kill &gt;preston Garvey 
---
They only go up to a certain number ex. 2 out of a small then it maxxes out. But, if you were to stay in your camp, grab the water, you'll notice it comes back within 10 min, that would give you 2 more thus giving 12 in an hour. I know, its a pain in the ass
---
Wait until new content to decide, the game is sparce on content. We've only just gotten our first content announcement, and it will be spread out over 100 days. In fourteen of those days, we will be getting a new type of crafting and a quest line to go with it. I believe there will be an update with added content every month or so
---
So, I see that was your bed I left the hot dogs on

Exactly. They should just be removed from the game. It's stupid to even have a missile turret. Just make it a massive cannon emplacement that fires bullets lol .....
---
Agree. The scorched earth is what 30mins? If you show up at the last 5-ish. Then you get what you see.  But those that are they there working should get the bulk. 
---
Isn't that what Whitespring gets unfortunately used for?
---
Lol you exaggerated big time. If by full top tier loadout for 25k caps you mean 1 item, then you‚Äôre correct. 
---
You‚Äôd be lucky to get one top tier piece for 25k caps alone, but likely they will not trade the item for caps.
---
More bs being perpetuated by ppl that like to look like they know wtf their talking about. Reddit user‚Äôs niche I suppose.
---
Robots do count well Mr Farmlands do at least. Just killed one and got a ping. Brahmin count as well. Killed 5-6 super mutants but nothing registered. Took out a mole rat, Feral dog, scorched, ghou, bot and brahmin. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs unit based. 12 units an hr. 6 units a bottle?
---
I agree. Hypekiller, especially when laser/energy weapons are still broken. What seems a bit more important, honestly? Fixing the balance of the game, or introducing hokey brews? Guess the latter for the devs for some reason.
---
How does one use a junk extractor? Does there have to be an existing junk pile on the ground beforehand? 
---
My honest opinion, if youre below the age of 14, dont get it. No one wants to play an online game like this with a kid. Not trying to be rude, kids just get treated terribly bad in online games
---
I like that it can be played solo or in a team. I like that it is fairly balanced and not gear centric. There is a lot of exploration to do
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been to a handful of failed events. Maybe it‚Äôs just not best to nuke there until the fix it. This was my first time actually nuking there too because I know how buggy she is and just wanted to try it out.
---
Do you happen to play on PC with mods installed?

Yes. It‚Äôs a type of resource node. You may have seen them in the junkyards.

r/unexpectedPortal
---
Nah, I'll take your stuff then kill you.
---
In my experience as melee it's far better to base your damage around power attacks/sprinting power attacks (due to faster animation) &amp; mutations than via crits/sneak (melee can't HS, or at least unarmed can't).  Sneak isn't realistic and power attacks are superior to crits plus you need stats elsewhere.  I also think STR stacking via alcohol/buffs is huge.  Unarmed is, imo, superior damage to melee via higher base damage (with unarmed's insane total dmg % this is important) but much harder to get a quality weapon for (can only really use deathclaw or power fist as you need the higher base damage).  You do lose a ton of survivability but stimpacks are endless and killing enemies in 1-2 hits kinda nullifies what enemies do.
---
That being said, mutations are insanely buggy so I have to wonder if it was really that effective or if I was getting bugged additional bonuses from my mutations.  For example my grounded mutation is so bugged out I'm usually immune to energy damage, this one is easier to see.  This may or may not also be related to being an older beta character, I'm not sure.  I don't have specific numbers for you but my pipboy numbers were really buggy and would vary for seemingly no reason which is partly why I think my mutations were super bugged out.
---
Your so creative 
---
Well the Christmas paint and the hot rod were out for a plenty amount of time. Black bird barely had a chance of being bought. It was out for only one day and most people were forced to buy it.
---
It‚Äôs a money/reward thing. People know they can get more for the loot at whitesprings than sbq and her adds. 
---
I love the game. If you are a Fallout fan and like games like Rust and Ark also, it‚Äôs right up your alley. 
---
Hp is irrelevant and you‚Äôre clearly a PvP noob. I run around wrecking people all day with a whopping 54hp. Your 350 dmg gun won‚Äôt even scratch me my dude. 
---
I‚Äôm not even going to bother explaining why hp is irrelevant because you‚Äôve clearly never heard of armor with damage mitigation or perks with damage mitigation.
---
Yes, three would suffice for 90+% of what I do.
---
Yup have to wait till fully destroyed before fixing
---
Will float this idea with the team! :D 
---
I never get any loot when we kill it so I just stopped. And ever since I got Ace Combat 7 I haven‚Äôt played the game. But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôll be an update to bring me back since the game is noice. 
---
Yup. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. 
---
Doesn't moving your camp repair all? Sure it costs caps but it's easy
---
[deleted]
---
i've done it 3 times today, and all launched by random people.
---
yes, you actually do have to wait until it is destroyed to repair. you could always scrap and rebuild each element but that‚Äôs tedious and waste of resources.
---
Too likely for something to go wrong in the Event, like the SBQ becomes invincible or just flies away, and too unrewarding for the effort. You could battle her for 20 minutes, or find a 3 Star Charred Ghoul at Whitesprings. Both have equal chances for legendary loot.
---
Unless you want Serum recipes/Ultracite mods/Prime Receivers. In which case it's still easier to just buy those from other people.
---
The Violet Flux you get from around the Prime Site is more valuable than most of what you'll get from her.
---
I just opened up my Country Road Bar &amp; Grill in preparation for the addition of distilling and player vending. 
---
I don't *want* to think that but I'd also argue most players are bad, so if it's a 65 or 250, if they're bad it doesn't matter.  Build and setup also has more of an impact than gear, plus there's people that just buy gear.   The game is also very one-shot centric and could probably go either way, unless people have % reduction perks but as I said, most people build their characters poorly and skip on power in favor of convenience. 
---
My point is there's a lot of factors, at best level as a slight indication of time, which is time they could have potentially refined their gear, approach, or otherwise.  They could still just be bad though.
---
Also I think the biggest pvp benefit is u can't be vats in chameleon standing up. Which u can't otherwise without a stealthboi. That's actually really beneficial. But again I haven't tested this but in theory that's how it should work.
---
While true i run heavy combat armor at all times with my stealth build and never noticed much of a difference while sneaking with lighter armors. While im sure it does affect stealth its not enough to be all that noticeable or (at least for me anyway) to sacrifice the other options for light armor.  
---
Maybe it was destroyed and you just need to repair it
---
check your refresh rate settings on the xbox maybe? mind defaults to 24hz or something lousy like that.

In Fallout 4 I have a bar in Sanctuary Hill called the Thirsty Brahmin.

For PC users, really take a look at

Perk Loadout Manager
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124/
---
It literally lets you create decks on https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
and then plug them into 8 quick slots.
---
I use this for "Explorer", "Hack/Pick" and "Town/Camp".  Eventually, If it ever becomes worthwhile crafting guns in the future (hint... something on par with legendaries...) then I'll create additional Crafting setups...
---
Brilliant Mod.
---
For those not on PC... keep pushing Bethesda. :)

Also I think the biggest pvp benefitof the chameleon mutation is u can't be vats in chameleon standing up. Which u can't do  otherwise without a stealthboi. That's actually really beneficial. But again I haven't tested this myself  but in theory that's how it should work.
---
I say this a lot but this is probably a server problem, like many things.
---
Gotcha, I will keep a lookout for them now! I thought they were only in the claimable workshop areas... Thanks for the reply.
---
I think any AMA with a BGS rep would be an invitation to massive trolling and would have to heavily moderated, and thee answers you get would be similar to what the community reps are able to provide now. Maybe 5 years from now, if FO76 takes off, you might see a video about the growing pains of the launch and early years from someone who is free to speak of what was going on behind the scenes within Bethesda and I would very much like to see that.
---
Red_EyedWolf400
---
Ya sorta just slide off or clip through it. Same for Vertibots. Can climb all over em at workshops. But I've they begin to lift off it boots\drops you off.
---
Canned rad roach, yum! What could be better? 
---
It‚Äôs very wonky, all my dailies actually all reset last night oddly enough, loaded into my game I was in the ash heap and queen of the hunt randomly started 
---
I haven't  seen any yet
---
&gt;Each day you speak with Biv, you‚Äôll receive one of two new repeatable daily quests at random. The first will teach you new Brewing and Distilling recipes every time you complete it, and the second will put your taste buds to the test as you experiment with the dubious effects of various drinks.
---
More of this please!!!   Maybe add some rewards like this to current repeatable quests and give me a purpose in life!
---
Like add halloween related rewards to the pumpkin daily, etc.
---
Look man out of the last 5 times I fought SBQ 4 times the thing went sideways.
---
Not once but twice me and a group of ~10 high level peeps took her on only to have her not register hardly any damage for the full 20 minutes and then deal with getting our asses handed to us by horde after horde after horde of high level ankle biters. That's a ton of broken guns, and wasted ammo for nothing.
---
Then a third time the server crashed in the middle of the fight.
---
Then a fourth time the fight seemed to go well and end well but the quest didn't reward any loot and her carcass after about 5-10 minutes of infinity spin was empty to boot.
---
Then on the fifth time when the fight went well as it usually does she dropped no good loot at all, or at least the didn't justify all the wasted ammo, broken guns and depleted stimpaks. 
---
I'm sorry but until the SBQ fight gets "fixed" I can't really blame the high level folks for not wanting to show up.
---
Yes yes indeed, time to Party Boy it up!
---
Didn't you listen to the Overseer?  You have to band together if you're to save the world!  The problem that caused the Scorched to 'win' was because there were disparate factions that couldn't/wouldn't work together.
---
There‚Äôs cigars and cigarettes in Red Dead, so probably not. 
---
I'd like to see a radiation-based molotov cocktail be something that I can brew for those anti-legendary, anti-PvP encounters.
---
Look at the guy. Already has the dukes up and he's not even in the ring!
---
Over your dead body.
---
An addiction that isn't cured by Disease Cures too. Takes 4x as long as you smoked previously for it to go away.
---
Did you... follow the questline? And what‚Äôs the ‚Äúfilled‚Äù you speak of? The completely optional Atom Shop that doesn‚Äôt let you level up faster or anything doesn‚Äôt seem full to me 
---
No, it should have negative side effects.  But I'm ok with it being an option.  Now if someone smokes at my CAMP, I'm killing them though.
---
You should have to hit it for loot to show up. Never really counted the hits.  But it should be at least once.   Ut I‚Äôd hit twice for good measure 
---
What about those annoying turret camps in Whitesprings? We're going to just allow them to exist with no challenge?
---
I am solidly in PvE camp but I see the benefit of PvP remaining as it is in the base Adventure game.
---
Get in there Trevor with your fuckin alien body
---
It doesn't matter. I one shot them all the time and still get legendary drops. 
---
was your stash an atom shop version? 3rd party mods are causing atom shop items to appear invisible.
---
In the last update, Atom shop items get messed up if you are using Mods on the PC.  Is your Stash one of the Atom Shop variants?  Pretty sure all the Pip Boy alternate colors are from Atom Shop.
---
Causes CAMP items to disappear and color paints to load up as some weird pink/red texture.
---
Can fix with the info in this topic:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascxic/atomic_shop_items_invisible_again/
---
I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve gone screeching into the resort because of this hahaha
---
Where?!
---
As long as they add a way to duel im okay with them taking it out.
---
What I'd like to see: One mode, PVP turned off, but with specific areas (imagine like the Wilderness in Runescape) where PVP is enabled. There would have to be some good stuff there. I think that'd be awesome. It wouldn't split the player base, and it would solve this issue we're dealing with where PVP is in a weird half on/half off position. 
---
I looked the whole fort defiance, no key
---
That's not what I'm asking.
---
I can one shot them as well, but being the nice guy I am, I let others have an opportunity.
---
After I hit it once before regen, do I have to shoot it again after regen for loot.
---
Do you have any numbers you can give me for power attacks and sprinting attacks? My 2.3 second estimation for super sledges involves the start up, the active frames, and the recovery. I imagine power attacks have way longer start up frames while sprinting has less.
---
Also, if you know the damage bonus for sprinting and power attacks, I can try to factor that into my calculations.
---
But... But.. It is broken and I want to fix it  
---
\*\*Spits dummy out, sits down on the floor with his arms and legs crossed and sulks...\*\*  
---
Hmphf!
---
I‚Äôm so happy to see them stick with the game. I can see this becoming something great ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
What platform?
---
Well, I browsed the market sites every day  and the prices have been going up recently.   Aae guns used to sell for 10k or less, and were traded for apparel or other guns. The market changes daily, especially when the next best thing comes out. A couple  weeks or so ago, people were selling full unyielding sentinel combat sets for 25k or less, or taking trades for other weapons or gear.. again, the market changes. Plus, top tier to one person, could mean jack shit to another. You can easily buy or trade for top tier gear at or below level 50 to wreck a higher level player. All it takes is some smarts
---
The one company engine that's capable of ridding people of their $200
---
It's not your mods exactly, it's the ini edits you make to allow mods. If you didn't delete the ini files when you reinstalled you'll have the same issue.
---
Just update the ini file.
---
To be clear, are you saying that "yes" I need to shoot it once after regen for loot?
---
Personally, I'd also require an "empty nuka-cola bottle" as an ingredient.  And fix it to where drinking one left you with a cap and an empty bottle.
---
Want to craft a bunch at once?  Better have a load of empty nuka-cola bottles.  Would actually give some purpose for collecting them out in the world.....there are much better sources for scrap glass shards, and this would give these particular bottles a purpose.  Just have to be careful not to scrap them accidentally (much like beer bottles for molotovs).
---
If I remember rightly the purifiers are pretty much just shared storage, they do not create water independently.
---
whether or not they are shared storage acrossed all types or each type is its own shared storage I dont remember if anyone ever figured that out.
---
For things the structure will allow you to take out and put back in, select the object, store it (make sure not to accidentally scrap it), then put it back. It's health should be restored if you do this before it actually needs to be repaired.
---
So, your water pump should be easy to do. I have some walls where it's difficult to do because of other things connect to them. 
---
In general. 
---
I wait for a full bealth regen just as a precation. I'm not sure if it effects drops. I have noticed legendary items seem to spawn on corpses about 1/2 second maybe less after a kill. If you loot the body too soon no legendary will spawn. I suspect this may be the RNG doing its thing.
---
I've also seen my legendary loot spawn on bodies next to the legendary enemy. Which is odd to say the least. I definitely want to hear the general consensus on how legendary loot works.
---
Lol so definitely maybe.... got it
---
new songs probably means new licenses, which probably means more $$ to the devs.
---
XB1
---
If you hit it, you can loot it. Always put a couple into the mob though just to make sure. The mob mutating doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with hitting it to claim loot off it. 
---
I have been staying in my camp and emptying them constantly to see if that was the case, but it definitely isn't :\\
---
Thanks, will give this a try :)
---
I deleted the entire FO76 directory and reinstalled clean.  Still no Atom store skins.
---
i got the same prob after gifting it to my xbox friend, we got to around level 20 near the end of rose's quest.
---
Damn this would have been so fun on ps4 RIP
---
Yeah I just mean like when they can you know 
---
Camps at that location screw up the random vendor spawn.
---
YES!  It needs a second sort key, it should sort by whatever you selected, and then another thing, normally alphabetically, that way the items don‚Äôt jump around each time they are re-listed 
---
it's bugged you just end up burning through all your stimpacks since it doesn't consider rad damage
---
In all the times had to fight to secure hits on legendary never have I lost loot for only hitting it once is what I‚Äôm saying. 
---
Yah, I just hit my
---
80 hour mark. 
---
Still have plenty of left to do 
---
Also applies to high-level (complex recipes) food and drink in general. Joseph Anderson's video review of the game specifically called Bethesda out for this weird design decision. Sad to see that Bethesda didn't pay attention for this DLC.
---
"There's a big difference between mostly broken and all broken. Mostly broken is slightly unbroken.  With all broken, well, with all broken there's usually only one thing you can do."
---
"What's that?"
---
"Go through its' bag and look for loose junk."
---
That is the same sound that the food packager makes at the workshop near Flatwoods it usually indicates something nearby is powered and working.
---
Seems I misunderstood your question. Any hit even before regen tags the enemy and you get the spoils.
---
I still use a non legendary pipe revolver at lvl 80 hardened reciver then the best recoil options for grip and barrel glow sight and suppressor 
---
Looks a little on jet.  But good. 
---
Aw, I was super excited, hoping it was going to be on PC. Hope it all works out for you!
---
You have camp budget left?
---
Must have built an outhouse, with no light and only one water pump.
---
Pete and Repeat are on a boat Pete fell off who's left?
---
I remembered reading something similar to this, but after watching them for a solid 12 hours over the last few days I'm not sure they do - one small purifier will have 2 bottles, another will 1 have simultaneously. Same with the normal and industrial ones, they'll have different quantities of water in them
---
Oh shit then i really dont know :/
---
Awesome, thanks for the definitive answer
---
Repeat
---
Obviously the market has completely changed in the past month as a lot of the duper accounts were banned/suspended, or wiped.
---
Top tier gear in PvP is either sentinel assassin or cavalier assassin armor. And no one is selling a full set of it for 25k, you‚Äôd be lucky to get one piece of it for 25k. 
---
You guys are making it out to sound so easy, it‚Äôs not.
---
Haha nice. I built a lit up basketball court once. Looked pretty sweet
---
Thats the point, if you could can them so they dont spoil, then it might be worth the extra effort once in a while to go ingrediants to complete the more complicated recipies. This would also lend to better player vending
---
It kinda sucks that you have to use it if you want to use fancier foods, but using the Good with salt perk helps, even if you only use a couple levels of it.

After playing Fallout 4 side by side with the wife since it's release, the ability to play co-op is the main reason we enjoy this.  
---
2. We don't actually play the storyline so we still have plenty of things to do after 600 hrs each. 
---
3. The only limit is our imagination. Or you could read that as griefers have none.  
---
4. I love the absurdity of the current player-run market. I'm waiting for the next "bubble" to burst &amp; see what everyone in the market starts pushing.  I think most valuations of in-game items is ridiculous &amp; bloated.

5. Making new friends while laughing about the unexpected side effects of this unusual social experiment brought to us by Vault-Tec, er, I mean,  Bethesda.

---
Cool, ill try this tonight and let you know. Thanks 
---
I‚Äôll be honest I played about 60 hours on release and came to the conclusion that it was a boring and broken game. Put about 10 more hours in just last week and while most issues are fixed, it‚Äôs still a VERY boring game. And I would consider myself a diehard Fallout fans.
---
I will say that Bethesda‚Äôs plans have me excited, especially Wastelanders. 
---
It makes zero difference whether you hit it before, after, or during the mutation phase. It doesn't matter if you one-shot it. Drop rates are the same.
---
Clearly you got them from duper‚Äôs or something else because you don‚Äôt seem to know much about the game, not as much as someone who would‚Äôve grinded for the gear.
---
Probably not this one. Junk decorating update we should get a larger budget. I don't think crafting benches are even .5% of your budget.

I hate it when companies come up with cool things that I haven't thought about.

Possible to tweak you build around to a pistol based vats build, with high luck can get some good crits
---
I‚Äôll play around with my settings, thanks!
---
Indeed
---
Min-Maxing is fun.
---
For some reason, sometimes my Xbox will display in HDR, and sometimes it won't. Brand new box and brank new TV. No clue why it does it
---
And, there are the ad hominems.
---
Sorry, when people can abuse the functionality of workshops or camps to force people into PvP, that's an exploit.  There wouldn't even be a pacifist setting if Bethesda thought everyone should be PvP.  So your analogy fails right off the bat.
---
But you seem to think that just because PvP exists, nobody should be exempt from it.  False dichotomy.  As illustrated by the existence of the pacifist setting, and the Survival Mode system they are working to put in place, Bethesda demonstrates clearly that they do NOT agree with your position.
---
But what should happen with Workshops?  There are some very good reasons to keep PvP for them.  But there are some reasons to allow pacifists to take them without forcing them to be in PvP......namely the crafting plans claiming and defending them PvE provides.  By allowing the contesting of a workshop controlled by a pacifist-set player to simply be 'given up' without PvP flagging occuring allows pacifists to still take un-owned workshops, gain their benefits, without forcing them to participate in PvP.
---
Such a solution ALSO allows people who WANT that workshop to claim it and gain the benefits, if they are willing to risk PvP.  They won't know offhand that the other player is set as a pacifist.
---
This would remove the risk of griefing, while still allowing people to engage in PvP over workshops if they DESIRE to.
---
Yet you seem to think they should be FORCED into PvP.
---
To paraphrase your own response:
---
"You're not very good at logic.  You're just being absurd.  You live a very sheltered life.  Stick to online deathmatch games."
---
I love everything about these suggestions. My favorite part of 76 is just running around gathering public workshops and setting them up as free and open rest stops for all (crafting benches, stash box, unlocked resource extractors, water gen).
---
I'd love to be able to do this without worry that I'll be targeted for this. Your PvE-friendly workshop contention idea is ‚ú®üíØ
---
C?
---
And the one on roof of Watoga High School. I stop by during my vendor run. 
---
For you. The rest of us have other things to enjoy.
---
Are you talking about plans? All the vendors have them now. 
---
Ok. I enjoy those things too. :)
---
Easy.  Make the defense events wipe ownership of ignored.  Plenty of churn would naturally occurring between not wanting to be bothered and log outs.
---
/r/woosh
---
What platform are you on? What level are you? What are you looking for in terms of a build?
---
Agree. She is broke and not worth the ammo and chems. 
---
\*jhonny guitar enters room\*
---
Hahahaha sweet!!
---
Agree and support. Make Fallout RPG Again.
---
We did kill her a few times in a row the other night no real problems but waiting around for 15 minutes for loot to drop and the quest to complete sucked. Plus the loot did suck. 
---
*Laughs in Super Duper*
---
There ought to be a subreddit called r/fo76Revenge just for stories like this, lol!
---
Great revenge! 
---
Awesome once again Jug.
---
Well Bugthesda already broke/nerfed  Adrenal Reaction sooooo....I would say Yes! Lol
---
I believe it was in the category of where the concrete vault boy statue is in floor decor. 
---
I love this game, I just have a point to make that's relevant to the allegorical meaning of your post.
---
there's a game  (i think it is about doing a prison breakout) that has co op and allows your team mate to install the game and play it because you bought the game. also there is the game where bomb disarming gameplay is based on solving instructions your team mate provides like a tech support phone call.
---
these are game mechanics that have actually advanced the concept of multiplayer.
---
76 has not drawn from
---
* classic games enjoyed online and via creators
---
   *  such as team fortress for quake - that was played with the gamespy server browser and on custom mod maps and servers
---
   * such as unreal tournament which was designed with the idea of having the source open and have its longevity defined by creators making new modes and game rules and gameplay for the community
---
* modern games about primarily some combo between creating / co op / pvp 
---
   * minecraft
---
   * roblox 
---
   * left 4 dead (interesting PVP where players could choose to be the heros or bosses)
---
   * mario maker (where the creator competes with the player in a core way)
---
the modern games feature layers of interaction that are innovative, the classic ones founded the concept for gameplay to be in a progression feedback loop as players construct the next adventure / challenge.
---
I really love the game's identity, coming from a heritage of all the types of games i hold most dear, from treasure and secret finding, to building a playstyle and arsenal /appearance and base in roleplaying mindset, to wandering a massive vivid world for the zen factor, all delivered in the subject of war, contemplation of death, the danger of violence and radiation .... it just simply arrived with so much unfinished in the 5th identity piece - layered interaction between environment, enemies, other players who create, other players who grief/compete, and ones who cooperate.
---
Essentially, it does not have any cohesive multiplayer mechanic to allow the depth that the classics or modern examples of great multiplayer have done. It joins this pack clearly showing the intention of greatness, but I strongly feel it is going to fall to the modding/creator community to bring it up to that level. If the game remains closed as it is now it may still eventually achieve an engaging multiplayer identity, but it is guaranteed to be if it becomes interface moddable and also playable on custom built content and servers.
---
Do you not use windows? I do and it asked me where to install it. It even remembered where and asked me (when I installed them) if that was where I wanted to put fallout 1 and 2 as well.
---
I did have WoW installed to my ssd (which is also where my OS is) and when it patched and took up to much space it caused issues, so I just moved it easy enough.
---
In short read the prompts when installing software. dont just blindly click ok/accept/yes.
---
That sucks. I'm a casual gamer and a coward. I run from everything. This was suppose to be my moment to shine. I will be sure to take more care to aim them in the future. Thanks for the explanation. 
---
Feral ghouls really hate my Tatos. 
---
You know you can buy or find mods right? Or pay a player to mod a weapon for you? 
---
nope it did not ask me and i use windows 10
---
Just any weapons that do a lot of damage and I am level 52 and PS4.
---
Holy novel. You‚Äôre putting a lot of statements into my mouth that I never said. Honestly, maybe this game isn‚Äôt for you if you have to shoehorn in a bunch of workarounds. Human contact is scary. Some people can‚Äôt handle it in their games. It‚Äôs okay, man. You‚Äôre nearing some r/iamverysmart levels. 
---
Taking a workshop will get you a camp plan, and then 5 mins later defending a workshop will get you another camp plan. pretty easy way of getting them. 
---
The video was awesome! Good job!
---
I would love to have the nuka factory become a workshop!! Let you craft any kind you want!!
---
No saying companies don‚Äôt have ways of working around it, though it‚Äôs the same reason why at least American TV has advertisements for alcohol and pharmaceuticals but not cigarettes.
---
In terms of the interactions you just suggested, the game already has an NPCs. All of the droid vendors say random things when you interact with them. Rose has quests that are linear and dialog that go with them. NPC isn't about human vs droid. That's a story distinction.
---
What people really mean when they say the game should have NPCs, is that those characters can have conversations with quests and a tree of conversational questions/answers choices where the NPC reacts and changes their behavior based on the progression of their storyline and your choices in that storyline.
---
A character that just says random things, has no impact on the story and never changes their behavior based on your actions isn't the type of NPC that people are asking for, that's just scenery.
---
It got those reviews because the game ISNT enjoyable though. Not for most people. The last few of you still here are the exceptions to the rule, which is fine, enjoy whatever you like. I loved BDO for the many months I played it, but I'd never in a million years call it a good game.
---
Of course, I was just looking for a friendly tussle
---
Same. Last one I did, besides the 10 minutes it took for event rewards to show up and the non-legendary metal leg were the deal breaker for me. 2500 5mm rounds lighter and wiser now. Until she is fixed, I‚Äôll nuke Whitespring 
---
I wanted plans for Ultracite calibrated shocks. She's the only place to get them as far as I know. But after killing and looting her at least 20 times (lost count after) all I had was 20 plans for explosive vents and several broken heavy weapons after it was over.  Oh, and a life saving wooden leg. 
---
I got fed up. How could I not be?  
---
Simply put, the Scorched earth event is seriously broken.  I mean, it's the toughest event in the toughest part of the map, but gives the same rewards you'd find at White Springs or Uranium fever. 
---
That's a very serious problem that Bethesda claimed they were addressing in the last patch.
---
Based on comments I've read here, they didn't. 
---
Dlc sorry. 
---
Until a level 100+ comes around and decides to take it :) 
---
Thank you for gold!
---
We don‚Äôt need stable servers. We don‚Äôt need more than 30 fps. We don‚Äôt need more end game content. What we need is a brewing station... Seriously Bethesda? 
---
That is one of those perks that I might use occasionally if it ever came out of a pack but don't want to buy
---
Completely True
---
They can take it all they want you'll still get the plans. 
---
You use the term griefing far too loosely. Looser still than myself, even (and I am very flippant about how I use that word!). It doesn't matter that your actions in a single player game didn't affect real people. An online game will naturally be different, won't it?
---
PvP for the sake of PvP isn't automatically griefing.
---
I won't stop defending 'assholes' because I'm tired of the mob mentality within this community. You can disagree with me, but I'm not gonna hide my opinion.
---
HALLOWEEN SALE?!!??!? [NANI](https://youtu.be/SiQNven4lvc?t=21)
---
my guess is they dont know how to make this
---
however we the modders would be able to hash this out and probably even still include cool opt in competitive / combat situations
---
Yup.  It's been giving me the blue screen of death lately.  Only when Bethesda launcher is open.
---
I did it too! Unstoppables Stash box for 700!! NNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Confirmation box please!!
---
I just watched this vid, i laughed a bit too loud and my co-workers gave me a funny look
---
I have never seen a radstorm in 200 hours
---
Warning other players may initiate PvP blah blah blah vague and a lot of people are idiots
---
Scorched, bots, muties, mongrels, and mole rats tend to attack my camp. They go for my crops that are closest to their regular spawn point, so I only put turrets on one side of my roof. Sometimes, I get a stray inside of my building, attacking walls to get out. Had one stuck in between a wall and a workbench. 
---
With blanket nerfs eventually everything will be down at a level playing field and they will have to start again.
---
Hence the :p.... Will switch it to a /s
---
Well unlike the TSE glory days, Bloodied actually requires some effort and speccing to maintain, and for full potential you have to be pretty damn close to dead.  
---
So it'll probably get nerfed.
---
I don't think so, they got a massive backlash from the TSE erf and many left the game, I think its ok where its at now, everyone seems to have adjusted.
---
It seems to be something for small organized groups now. With randoms i just leave if she doesn't reach regen point in 10 minutes.
---
Caps aren‚Äôt easy when you‚Äôre a low level. 
---
There are dozens of weapons and hundreds of mods for said weapons. Finding or buying them simply isn't reliable usually. Unless you're looking for ivory grips, that is. Paying players to mod your weapons is quite cool, but it doesn't solve anything. The players you're paying still had to deal with the senseless scrapping and grinding (people literally mass craft guns just to scrap them for mods that aren't even in those weapons). It's an objectively boring and mindless mechanic. 
---
I saw some youtuber do this. Some ass was harassing him amd his buddy, so he built a ring and had a boxing match to settle things. It was entertaining. 
---
Thank you very much, and don't let this video scare anyone away in game. I'm mostly harmless.
---
You missed the prompt.
---
sorry it happened to you too.... but man even that box would be better than a poodle dress....
---
i agree some sort of confirmation box would really help....
---
I kinda so bummed i think i need to take a break from the game...
---
i have over 12000 pounds and i can't get rid of it without dropping some things also i like all the stuff that i have
---
Yup, doesn't work.  You just fall through.
---
I guess you're right. U can always check the luggage at train stations that's where I tend to dump my stuff.
---
Haha yeah I think I got off lightly! 
---
THIS! This happened to me last week. My heart dropped to my stomach. I had to walk away and tell myself it was okay and all that hard work I did was easy and could be done again. 
---
It would just be Country Roads over and over again. 
---
Me too! I drop some good stuff too. Like BoS paint job for the T60 
---
seems like i am not the only one
---
yeah im feeling pretty ill right about now...
---
im sorry it happened to you too..
---
I would be interested in marsupial, bird bones, healing factor, speed demon, twisted muscles, grounded and scaly skin. 
---
I have 14 mutations, but it‚Äôs just become a mess. Getting them by chance is hopeless. 
---
Bloodied has a pretty damn huge trade off for the damage.
---
There nothing more depressing then getting killed by a swarm of level 10 liberators right after you mowed through a bunch of high level super mutants.
---
Class freak is up to 3 points not 2.  Also, no one can keep up making serums all the time.  Even buying them would end up being hard.  Min/maxing that way makes no sense.
---
Other theories have speculated, but I'm excited to see it fill up with some more Raider activity. Possibly in a future expansion?
---
To be fair, has there even been any new content updates so far? I'm pretty sure there's only been a ton of bug fixes and a few gameplay adjustments unless I'm mistaken.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to you as well my friend :,(
---
By this standard Berserker should be way more OP than Bloodied.
---
Confirmed, PVPers are legitimately sad boys, unable to mentally progress past teenagerhood and deludedly revenging themselves on high school bullies by hassling complete and utter strangers into their adulthood. Good to know! 
---
They will need protecting from all the camp visitors which I think will be impossible, I can't even protect my tatos let alone a load of friendly critters.
---
Makes sense, the bombs didn‚Äôt hit WV
---
lol
---
Ground Zero Bar and Pub
---
I agree.  If you are running around naked you should be able to oneshot everything.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of. I keep scrapping found crossbows just in case, but so far nothing after maybe a dozen scraps
---
On PC, I can't remember the last "disconnected from server" message I've seen. 
---
I still get occasional rubberbanding, and I feel like the damage rubberingbanding (which I believe was server load related) is worse than previous patch, but still pretty infrequent, realistically.
---
especially when they‚Äôre not even character-specific, would make sense if we could see them on the main menu
---
Because cloud.
---
That happened to me. It was wrecked. I could see it in workshop mode as yellow. I just needed to repair it. 
---
Fire Cracker Whiskey: "Fresh Effect:¬†Your melee attacks will result in self-immolation, damaging both you and your attackers." So, whats the bonus?
---
It suuuuure would!
---
Awesome!
---
Absolutely loved watching this video - 10/10 for use of Wilhelm. Another great building guide, thanks!
---
This is why you see do many of those floaty base things. Keep in mind I have zero crops. It's always just structural damage. This is why I keep my rad shower in storage and only install to use it. It's annoying at best. 
---
I don't want human raiders in Appalachia. Some NPCs would be nice.
---
If neither of those things are possible, though, then I think non-raider humans should band together into factions/guilds/teams to create communities that defend each other and enforce a code of law within their territory. That would make human raiders interesting instead of just freaking annoying. They are often organized into small posses. Non-griefers should organize themselves, too. The game should add mechanics that make it easier to "circle the wagons," such as team CAMPs or permanent settlements.
---
Ticks hate my Mothman billboard.
---
I am 14, but I've been told (by several people, including a multitide of adults) that I look, act, and speak like an adult. I'm sure I'll do fine.
---
I am trying very hard not to giggle uncontrollably at your misfortune....
---
I'd like to see a picture of it on the wheel since it's not an option for me , I call BS or my game is broken
---
Also all this is with a close to max str build and with sneak attacks. With unyielding gear your agility is high enough that you can sneak attack literally anything any time. Go on sneak buzz blade the queen in the face and thank me later.
---
One hit them with a knife, melee is best for these, radrats and molerats also insects are vulnerable to melee weapons.
---
I was just discussing this.
---
I'm going to continue to relate this concept with WoW, since it seems logical and easy to understand. I think that instead of TRUE factions like the Horde and Alliance, this game should instead give us choices more akin to the Scryers and Aldor.
---
Quest lines to further flesh out each faction so that we can make a decision that suits our personal beliefs, and special quests and safe zones depending on which faction you chose. Likewise the rewards could vary slightly, eg nice power armor mods for Brotherhood of Steel faction and Energy weapon mods for Enclave. Upon choosing a faction, you gain access to these factions various hubs, while the opposing faction hubs will attack on sight.
---
Besides this though, players will still be vault 76 members. We wont be blocked from interacting with one another or blocked from attacking same faction members.
---
Lots of interesting potential though, as "raiding" opposing faction hubs could be implemented, even to the point of having special bases that you can overthrow in the name of your respective faction... creating a tug-of-war style event in game.
---
Just my 2cents =)
---
Have to admit the one time I can recall seeing one was in the outskirts of Austin when visiting my cousins as a kid. There was a small one in the bathtub. No idea how it got there.
---
I doubt super mutants are going to be very intimidated by a poodle skirt...
---
I'd be there with my toothpick sized Furious Combat Knife jabbing the SBQ in the eye. Jabby, jabby, jab, jab.
---
Sorry, but I just started a new character and moved on. I had a lvl 162 with a lot of weapons and armor I traded for here on Reddit and nothing on it close to what they claim but oh well. I'm willing to bet those accounts are burned and gone. 
---
It‚Äôs no huge deal for me. Just less adhesive. I may add some cheap structures for them to shoot at. 
---
Once, they did take down the building wall facing them. I had a nice breeze for a bit. 
---
Wow.  Someone takes time to explain their position in more than one paragraph and you call it a novel.  Honestly, if your attention-span is so short, maybe you should stick to tic-tac-toe.  And I'm sorry you find human contact to be scary....I find it quite pleasant, most of the time.  But evidently, you just want to go around and hit people for no reason other than that you can.  Too bad that doesn't work so well in real life.
---
And your jab with the  r/iamverysmart reference?  Doesn't bother me.  Just another attempt to avoid the valid points and just try to attack the messenger, rather than the message.
---
I‚Äôd so something with a robot dj fitting with Appalachia‚Äôs lore. At random a player is chosen to come to the studio and they receive a rare bobblehead or snow globe(nod to NV) or even a golden holotape. They get to pick one song to play next and can solo loot the studio. 
---
I‚Äôve been doing it with empath for a while and don‚Äôt have problems sustaining it. Buying them isn‚Äôt too hard either since you‚Äôre looking at 50-100 caps per craft. Pick enough fights down at fissure site prime and you‚Äôll make enough flux to not have to buy
---
That's fantastic. Lmao
---
Aye!!! I guess these people never learned about common courtesy huh!?
---
He was also related to Daniel Boone! another famous Virginian sharpshooter. If you do get a faction together, y'all should only use sniper muskets with bayonets, maybe swords. That's be amazing!
---
The way I feel content will be released is similar akin to gta online, disappointing start, then it got really fun. Also in gta the dlc further time in game. My Hope's for the dlc are high, but I really enjoy the game rn
---
Use [More Where That Came From](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/126).
---
3 to 0? Just going to best out of 3 and ignore a clear win after 2?
---
On 8chan
---
The game already has plenty of NPCs, and adding human NPCs would go against the game's story. And, since this is an online role playing game, people _will_ be Raiders. People will be cultists. People will be Responders and Brotherhood Knights and Enclave Soldiers. Whether you want it or not.
---
I agree that player guilds or something along those lines would be very good for the game, however.
---
Why did you use a blizzard image?
---
You're reaction made me laugh too.
---
On XBOX.  I get this occasionally, then I hard reset my xbox and it seems to reduce it.
---
Same as trying to convince myself to get back into the game üòÇ
---
True I thought about that after I posted lol but still it would be cool to incorporate a living thing into or camps. Maybe somthing a little less of a chore than gardening somehow? Like a hamster or something we could lock indoors and isnt a huge target for mobs? Idk. I have the carnivore mutation so veggies are almost useless to me except for when I need adhesive. Id much rather have my friendly turrets defending a rabbit hutch or a Brahmin pen. I'm sure there's a way they could balance it out.
---
What happened? It says the comment is deleted!
---
That‚Äôs what happens in the ash heap
---
They don't have any experience with ESO though, because they didn't make it. Totally different company with totally different developers. Besides, the team that made the multiplayer integration of Fallout 76 were the Battlecry team, who weren't former Bethesda devs - considering that Battlecry Studios' only game got cancelled before release, the studio hardly had a good track record!
---
This is great, wished you got more karma for this. If I wasn't a cheap person this would be my 1st gold to give away.
---
Watched it with FO76 and now watching it happen again with Anthem.
---
The kicked the game out unfinished to beat another games release date in a state they are not even prepared to support while also pulling devs and leaving a skeletal suport team to fix everything and somehow generate more content.
---
Oh but the cash shop works just fine.
---
Survival PVP Moonshiners options. Can see people running to bust up stills an people running shine to sell. Could be an interesting twist. Select your role as the LAW or Booze Runner!
---
I think these work like bobbleheads and magazines. They don't spawn at a 100% spawn rate. Just a chance that they could appear.
---
Scared the crap out of me 
---
They could also add Jazz music from the 50's and before
---
Queen City courtesy 
---
Glad to see this. I think the gatling laser is one of the game's more underrated weapons. I don't even have a legendary one yet, but my tactical beta wave gatling (with a heavy weapon perk build) just melts all the annoying high-level enemies: SB, anglers, gulpers, etc. Hoping to give it the true test against the SBQ soon. 
---
I've started dropping off any low level gear I find that is 1 or 2 star in the overseer's camp... especially when nobody is around... hopefully only taken by low level people that need the stuff.
---
It's my pay-it-forward for other people being nice to me when I was new.
---
To add to already great suggestions: Don't get too attached to weapons and armor you find. Even though the STASH weight limit is now twice what it was at release, you can really weigh yourself down by storing things "for later". A chest plate that grants -15% damage from Ghouls pales in comparison to one that simply has better base stats. Sell those overly specific Legendaries. 
---
I kept hearing a crunching/gnawing sound and when I finally figured out where it was coming from, I found a stupid rabid mole rat munching on my concrete barrier! Got the thing down to 1/4 health, too. That molerat must've had some strong teeth! 
---
I'm a Bethesda game fan. There's no denying the technical nightmare this game is. The complete degradation of RPG mechanics in favor of tedious "survival" mechanics and the complete lack of mods don't help matters. There's a reason this game failed.
---
I'll always resent the fact that you couldn't partake in the fights at the combat zone in Fallout 4.
---
It's a common occurrence in the ash heap. It's a side effect of the underground coal mine fires, actually happens irl in the area. 
---
Nice one Jug, that was great ..
---
A permissive based dueling option.
---
"Hey, you wanna duel?"  "No, thanks"  "Aww, drat"
---
"Hey, you wanna duel?"  "Yeah, sure"  "FIGHT!"
---
I also somewhat wish the day-cycles were a bit longer.
---
When in battle at dusk, it shouldn't be daylight when you're finished.
---
Haha you are stupid
---
Click on your camp thing and it should give you a message that you can repair everything. Itks just a guess, but maybe you don't have the option if you don't have the right materials to accomplish the repairs. 
---
I also think a Talk Radio would be good, a character like Dale Gribble (from KOTH ) doing conspiracys and wasteland news , or Karl Pilkington.
---
Have you recently dug up over 15 treasure maps very fast
---
Oh no! I'm at work now I'll have to send it to you later.
---
Hi friend, I've just come across this (I know it's old). If you're still having the issue have you checked for viruses? It honestly sounds like your pc is mining crypto or something.
---
Yep. 
---
The amount of stims and ammo I must've missed out on is infuriating
---
Sorry. I missed that the stuff wasn't fully broken yet. 
---
Agreed. 
---
It says "search" a container. I understand the quotes are there, but I assumed that was just for emphasis. I had no idea there was an extra search option
---
I might drop by and get my ass kicked in the ring, it sounds fun
---
Always happens when load bearing event shows up. 
---
But I don't want someone who has 5000 5mm rounds to just shoot me over an over, being annoying, but if after a period of repeated action, they take damage against themselves (why you hitting yourself mode), then I'll be ok with it. Just seems it would be best to do away with slap damage and only have PVP in Workshops and Watago High School.
---
Glad to know I'm not alone! 
---
Any possibility you could bring up a possible text adjustment to the team? Just something to explain it to the less observant, like me? 
---
You seem fun. 
---
Energy weapons need a huge durability buff, and a moderate damage buff for lasers.
---
I can't get ANY of my friends to even try it.  Their scoffing ridiculing really pisses me off. It would be so much more fun if I had folks to co-op with :/
---
Possibly your camp has been duped many times over (not your fault). I didn't pay attention to my camp for about a month and realized I had 150 water purifiers. With only 10% budget used. I have placed 3 purifiers.
---
Completely Agree!
---
What if they did new artists who wanted to get heard and they only did for 30 periods?  Could maybe get artists to pay them?
---
I'd be nice if it was the same as in Borderlands 2. No slap damage, both players need to hit eachother once to initiate PVP.
---
Non I mean the ones that they actually removed. Like the one outside Whitespring by the table with the three caps on it as well as others.
---
RIP tatos
---
Meh. Some people are mean. 
---
I know of an 8 year old who is doing fine. And just ran across an 11 year old about a week ago. 
---
Lots of older players are really nice and helpful with kids. If he runs across bullies, he just needs to know to log off. 
---
That was the plan. The senior officers use two shot quad X black powder line of weapons. With revolutionary swords. With pirate tricorne hats. 
---
That's exactly why people would be mad, limited run time and some had to pay real money. the time frame is what makes it more valuable and rare for the people that own it. If they bring it back now it wont be as valuable because more people will have the chance to get it therefore it loses its rarity. 
---
Just got it and I really enjoy it. Reminds me of any other fallout game that i have played.
---
We've have some paints for the Excavator coming :)
---
Wut?
---
If this is a for real issue it should be addressed, like, freaking fast. I always keep my ultracite cores in my stash and haven't done enough queen fights lately to notice if they are disappearing before they should. 
---
That really sucks.

Pop up trading between players can be done, just have to hang out in areas like White Springs. Other than that we need to wait for Vendor selling at our Camps. What if we had a Wednesday Wares Day as a go to day for trading. Simply walk up to people an say what's for Sale. How about first Wednesdays of the Month?
---
I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why. 
---
It can be bad PR, sure. That absolutely might be why they don‚Äôt include it. People can say it encourages kids to smoke.
---
But I‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs not a legal issue.
---
Brilliant, just, brilliant.
---
How exactly does a stimpack instantly repair your broken legs after you jump from an 80 ft building?
---
Paper bags for everyone 
---
I get your question now. No you only need to tag once, if it regenerates you are still good for the drop. 
---
I've spent a good bit of time in white springs nuke zones. When i come across legendaries, no matter the stars i tag once so as many other players as possible have a chance to tag as well. Always get the loot. 
---
Finally I can make my own whiskey for my grape mentats
---
I think this is a better idea than the refrigerator request.  Especially adding the requirement for getting jars etc.  I always skip collecting jars.
---
I think this is a brilliant idea. If the upcoming Survival mode is any good it would be awesome if they did away with PvP and all the slap damage bs. However, I think workshops should definitely remain as a PvP zone. Workshops with only PvE would become way too easy to hold and pretty overpowered.
---
We did too!! We were all, "oh my God it's J47!! 27 years late!"
---
i've told so many people that i wish i could recommend them the game. i basically say "if it can survive another month or two, give it a shot."
---
Great. Thanks for the follow up!
---
Had that the other day with a wolf. They must have the same dentist
---
I would like to see more of this üëç
---
You only press X once to open the window then use left or right on d pad to scroll the preview pictures.
---
NEVER press X twice you'll just buy the item.
---
A sprinting attack is just a power attack with a shorter animation, normal power attacks have an almost prohibitively long animation.  I believe it's a 1.5 multiplier but one of the legendary mods increase this but I'm not sure if it works properly because I never found one (a number of legendary mods either don't work or don't work as you'd think).  Pretty sure it's 1.5 for both.  This means AP is somewhat important but you don't necessarily need an insane amount.
---
I don't  know, is your character male? If you sit down &amp; do some basic instinct action at them they might become intimidated.
---
Honestly I don't love this game. I have plenty of rants about it. Ill give you 5 things I liked about Fallout 76, but bear in mind that there tons of stuff I didnt like at all.
---
1. Its within Fallout universe. If you're familiar with it, you'll feel at home in Fallout 76. They managed to sucessfully preserve the Fallout universe atmosphere.
---
3. The map. Its probably the best Fallout map so far. Big, varied, built to be discovered progressively and with increased danger. The variety of landscapes, atmospheres and enemies.
---
4. The free roaming/exploration. Although I believe exploration is not well rewarded, the feeling of preparing and planning your exploration and them hitting the road and finding new places really brings the game to life. 
---
5. One of the best Fallout quests ever, Mistress of Mysteries is very worth playing.
---
The main story is ok, but lacks depth. The Scorched treat is never truly felt by the player. In fact the Scorched quickly become one of the weakest foes in the game. 
---
Some holotapes found tell touching stories, which add a lot of depth to the game.
---
Basically stuff from fallout 4 then. üëçüèº I‚Äôve been in for a couple of hours. Slowly wandered around and getting used to the place. Just one question.. if I store all my junk, is it automatically available when I go to craft at a later point?
---
Genius!
---
Thank your Burt Reynold üòéüòÅ
---
good advice, however, i guess i learned the hard way
---
I don‚Äôt know where to look anymore
---
Marine is the best all regards.  It combat can give it a run for its caps. I went with regeneration for armour effect.  It there plenty of others. Chameleon is good and the mod that makes you harder to detect in dark is really good. Plus the perks to go with the play style. 
---
heheheh too bad there are no razors in the FALLOUT world so a 70's bush would obscure the meaty bits, a '76 bush to be precise
---
No. That would mess up the bloodied gun builds, which are not as out of balance as bloodied melee. If they want to target the low health melee build specifically, they will nerf unyielding armor. 
---
First comment 
---
I have a bloodied melee build and while I don't have exact numbers I've played with all the weapons and types. My anecdotal evidence is that for unarmed the DPS contenders are the obvious death claw and power fist. I suspect the power fist wins out since the damage between the two is pretty similar but the power fist has an armor pen mod. I haven't played with the meat hook much but since it benefits from one handed and unarmed perks it might be worth looking at.
---
 In two handed the super sledge is a red herring, nice sheet damage but it loses a ton of DPS as it pulls you out of stealth so you only get your sneak multplier once. The regular sledge is possible because it doesn't do this but the real DPS golden child of two handed is the bloodied over-repaired buzz blade. It has to be north of 150% condition as you'll start to notice the damage fall off after that but damn this thing is nice if it's in top shape. Definitely some of the best DPS in the game and it's just fun as hell to use. 
---
One handed only really has one weapon worth looking at and it's the combat knife. It's got a few points better damage than the other knives but the important part is the stealth blade mod. 50% stronger sneak attacks on swing speed this good is just the best. I would guess this is the best DPS in the game but it's hard to tell between the combat knife and the buzz blade.
---
Finally, the chunks are nice on the unarmed weapons, but really if you've never taken a combat knife or a buzz blade to a queen fight you're missing out. That said the quality of life is higher on unarmed as you can slot blocker and mitigate queen wing attacks.
---
Second comment
---
I have seen this too! And it is hilarious!!!! If you don‚Äôt know what we are talking about, please try it for yourself. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. 
---
Yeah, she had one lol. It was to bring her to a vault to clean her addictions
---
Sure I guess. But doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose? I have to fill my with food to gain disease resistance and take radaway to so I can drink somthing to lessen my hunger. 
---
Isn't just easier to eat the food and call it a day? 
---
I still might make it, depending on the cap value and the experience it gives for crafting but I won't be consuming it. 
---
I‚Äôm looking for 10,000-25,000 rounds
---
I really don‚Äôt have much ammo myself 
---
I feel ya. Happened to me at least 8+ times. Before release and launch week. If anything the server should check before loading you in.  
---
how DARE they give us additional content! /s
---
The wastland isn't the thing you have to be worried about its being banned and all the bugs the game still has. It funny it still has tons of bugs but they are already talking about dlc? Why dont they fix the content they have before creating more problems with dlc.
---
I genuinely don't understand how anyone is ever short of cores, they're everywhere. And i say this as someone who carries 4 laser gats.. 
---
Yeah if I was sure I couldn't be killed more than once like that and only at the workshop I might take them more often. 
---
More intrested in ammo than caps
---
It's like skyrim/oblivion/morrowind... But with guns!
---
Customizations on EVERY weapon
---
It's a way prettier landscape than FO3
---
Other players in game(MMO) and.....
---
HEAD SHOTS! 
---
I sent you a message when you have a moment to check. 
---
They could use the same thing they just implemented for CAMPs. 
---
I have not
---
Why ain‚Äôt I on the carport roof
---
Now I want a poodle skirt but I'm saving up for the four horses of the apocalypse paints that are rumored to be coming
---
That didn't seem to be the case.  I've had that issue happen before, several patches ago, but I don't think it's happening now.
---
If they get to be the announcer, get ready for Chuck Norris jokes like Barrens chat. 
---
I think they do add songs. I could be wrong, but I remember the 'Old Man Mose is Dead' song first coming on after an upgrade.
---
You might be onto something. maybe the just hate noise. 
---
Yes but why? Because there are fewer and fewer players online. 
---
If that's not good
---
If you wanna go the extra mile, and aren't saving plastic for anything, bulk your lead and aluminum scraps at a tinker bench as well.  It shaves off either a half-pound or full pound each time, depending on which one you do.
---
That place is cool but there are always scorched around the place
---
The weird thing is that this character wasn't even over fifty so I dunno why they spawned there, in the forest nonetheless.
---
Lol I‚Äôm on top of the clifff right beside that bridge, and I spawn at the bottom and have to climb up.
---
Ain't that a kick in the head.
---
I think I need a t-shirt that says "Ghouls Hate my Tatos" 
---
I love that in 2019 people are still mercilessly downvoted for pointing out that search engines exist. ikr, breaking news huh guys?
---
You could still run a berserker rifle build and it would be the same as bloodied.
---
With a customary "your ass is about to get fried, would you like to continue loading" type message
---
The ini files are in your Documents folder, not the FO76 directory. Someone else linked a thread with the fix in the comments here. Follow the instructions in that thread.
---
Playing since beta its urks me that we still have these issues 
---
It was at 600/600 and when it increased to 800 i went into higher level hoarding mode . There is so much things to loot on this game and getting my puny brain around the fact that i do not need everything is a challenge. So if you ever walk into a room devoid of loot..... there i am
---
Just turn sideways and roll lol
---
That's a 3‚òÜ perk card? At work and don't remember 
---
Just issue a ticket. I‚Äôve seen a lot of people get their atoms refunded when this happened.
---
Like the dlc that's coming out next month  or u mean a different kind of brewing
---
What system I got a Vail I can give on PS4
---
I'm similar to this but with long scope
---
Looking through the game files, there doesn't appear to be any.
---
It's just a low investment stealth weapon that scales with rifle perks. I used it until I unlocked the plans for the BoS recon rifle.
---
Workshops my dude
---
Probably not a lot of complaints for it to be fixed. 
---
Alright thanks so much ‚ù§Ô∏è just wish I get could have fixed this without the hassle.  I really wanna love 
---
 this game but Bethesda is making it hard 
---
I‚Äôd rather be stupid and learn from it than be an intentional prick to people. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Duel Power Fist. Do I have to say more?? BETHESDA PLEASE!
---
Replied! Thank you!
---
I think that all the locations are still there, it's just random which places get a stash. I noticed several spots like you mention that I thought had cap stashes gone but on subsequent play throughs actually spawned a cap container.
---
And Bethesda could get people that don‚Äôt like what‚Äôs in the shop to use Atoms
---
I'd say flip the concept of workshops around and make them coop hubs a player can own one of.
---
Basically while it's capped have escalating horde attacks that scale with each defense event (say 10 min frequency).  Once the event isn't completed it in time then they loose control and zone gets cleared.  This would help immensely with giving us coop activities to do on the map as well.  We darn sure need something that isn't trivial post 50 since most events are trivial.
---
It was awful. Two thumbs up.
---
The day I noticed this I was with two separate groups of friends.  When one of us died, were would say things like, ‚Äú go ahead and take the junk, I don't need it‚Äù.  But to our dismay, when one of our friends on the other team did this, suddenly they were flagged as being in PvP with our group.
---
At first we all checked our pacifist settings and all verified we were set up to do no damage to other players.  But again as soon as one of us on the opposite team picked up the other teams junk we were unknowingly flagged for PvP, AND it was as if pacifist was automatically disabled.
---
We only discovered this because while fighting ghouls we would pick off ghouls from our friends on the other team, but they would be taking splash damage from mutations or even from explosives.  Careless shots and friendly fire also resulted in needless deaths.
---
So, working as intended? Bug? I honestly don't know.  Now we avoid doing things in two separate groups.
---
Maybe it's because you're level 135. Start a new character and find out.
---
So play something else.
---
One day I was near the top of the world level 25ish, just cleaned the area with much pain, someone hi level show up and the ghouls literally spawned on top of me level 40ish in massive number and murder me....
---
Yes please. 
---
When I spawn on the bottom of the ledge I fast travel again to the camp and I have a good chance that I'm on top, but it is a waste
---
They have done something shitty to the armor mod plans since this known plans patch.
---
I did a server hop study at certain vendors looking for armor plans before patch 5.
---
I modified a spreadsheet another redditor made of the current plans available, and there are 5 common armor plans now (deep pocketed marine limbs is one of them).
---
Ive been hopping around, and adding to the list as I find new ones (its mostly been camp plans or heavy/sturdy combat). But so far I havent seen any new armor plans.
---
[This is the spreadsheet I made](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
Its better to view on a computer. There are two sheets one pre patch, one post patch
---
Keep communicating like this. At this point I don‚Äôt even care if y‚Äôall are writing fanfics to get us excited just keep communicating ! Steps in the right direction for sure 
---
If only you could get his wonderful battle coat in 76 as a piece of apparel. I loved his coat
---
Directly East of Vault 76 there is a shrine with bundled twigs. It is littered with skeletons. There were at least 4 Skulls there when I was there just now
---
Thank god, was expecting something like a preston broadcast every freaking time a gnat farts around someone's camp or workshop.
---
It's the elongated skeleton with translucent skin!  
---
Then they could use armor under that same premise otherwise the ‚Äúhive mind‚Äù would make discard the weapon.  Certainly some people contracted the disease while wearing armor and would wear it out of habit including BOS.  
---
Oh yeah, the mouth expansion is coming in one of the upcoming updates. I mean, probably not the next, or the one after, but at some point. They've thought about it. Probably.
---
Because you know that's where the other players will look for stuff to buy
---
There isn‚Äôt anything to do though, I reinstalled the game in anticipation for the new updates and really the only things I‚Äôve found to do is make my usual grinding rounds for caps and supplies. None of the quests are particularly interesting and there isn‚Äôt enough people on servers for me to bother making some sort of store front. 
---
From Vault 76? I'm down, but he better be good. This is literally supposed to be the "best and brightest" and if they decided to allow a radio DJ, he better be Three Dog. Or better.
---
It's the Fallout universe. We don't can things to make them last longer, we irradiate them to kill all the nasties that spoil the food.
---
New CAMP object with an input and an output, takes 1 power to run. Input requires nuclear material and a food or drink item that has a spoilage bar. Output is an "Irradiated" food or drink item that has 10 more rads than before and no spoilage bar.
---
:c That sounds absolutely awful. I kinda hate how the game works with (re)spawning enemies, seems less optimized for the player and just for the sake of keeping the place full of mobs.
---
Oh hey you're level 13? Let's give you a fuck ton of over level 50 mobs to swarm you because there's a level 249 halfway across the Ash Heap from your location.
---
That so freakin funny, my kids absolutely love it. 
---
Is it still there? Kids and I want to come have a look 
---
Were you referring to the monongah mine or the Garrahan Mining Headquarters?
---
Yes I guess I am, this is my first time on reddit, I‚Äôm dumb üíñ thanks for letting me know !!! 
---
I think the road between 76 and the Overseer's camp would be the perfect place for all the traders to setup.    
---
Everyone can get there for free and everyone knows the path. 
---
That's just M.O.T.H.E.R gathering up minerals for all her good little vault babies
---
Yeah fast travel mat got removed from camp and became workshop only.  Made my initial base BP workshop only as mat prevents deployment at a camp.
---
Stardew Valley up in this bish
---
It is easy and can be done again... For money!
---
/s but only a little
---
But you are in fallout and it does feel like fallout
---
If your only doing solo PvE, I recommend all weightless armor and the chameleon mutation, BUT keep one redundant Chameleon Armor piece in case you want to fire while stealthed.   While only in weightless armor run stealth, and use escape artist.  You can basically walk past mobs you don't want to fight.
---
This will not help at all in PvP. Not at all.
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/sS8YbjrTzu4KI/giphy.mp4
---
I agree.  Make you lose some ap or slow you down. Hell even make you Hallucinate.  Then again it‚Äôs only 25 years after the bombs   Maybe the meds are bad yet to cause affects. 
---
Am I imagining it, but didn't you used your be able to ride one in F4? From the Brotherhood ship to over to A base? 
---
The exact same thing happened to me. I'd gladly play with you if you are interested. Let me know and I'll PM you my PSN name. 
---
 I am mostly a Dog food consumer, but early on I kept taking the place you can make rad free food and made a ton of Salisbury steak I also eat.   Would be nice if we could build one of those machines in camp, but have to put food in to get the preserved food out.
---
Separate PvE/PvP servers at launch would have fixed so many problems, it's mind boggling that they still haven't made this fix.  I guess some of this comes down to PvPer vs Ganker.  As someone who likes PvP, I want to fight people who *want* to fight back.  It's equally annoying that I have to 'probe the waters' to see if someone is interested in a fight or not and then most of them get annoyed.
---
I don't think this game will ever be in a playable state until private servers come out and the community can fix the game for them.
---
Yes I they must. I have a decent in storage but fear to use due to breaking even st 200%
---
That's right, ok. Shoot, even more of a reason to like Garvey more haha. 
---
How?
---
I read up on it and it seems to be because of the drugs being super strong, not because of age. 
---
Yes I believe it is 3.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Damn that sucks, wish I'd have known, thanks
---
This kind if thing is great and its good to see the communtiy stepoing up with community events. If this is on pc I am willing to be third party bet holder if timings of the players allow it. Same name on Pc as here if the OP is interested.
---
I think they at least serve as a visual deterent. If I see a base or workshop that has no turrets, the first thing I think is "that poor guy."
---
I agree with the PVE/PVP split. I just came across a griefer that somehow was able to instantly regen health, even while I unloaded an entire 35rd magazine of TSE into his characters face. I'm a highly pacifistic player and would rather explore and kill mobs instead of dealing player characters that are much much higher level than me (I'm lvl 87).
---
Well yes but endurance has most of the damage mitigation perks. But I‚Äôd personally rather run full assasins + nerd rage + whatever perks and as much hp as possible if I wanna be tanks. 
---
They aren't considered griefers because they way a fair pvp fight... 
---
I like this!
---
‚ÄòI‚Äôve got something a bit different for you‚Äô
---
A couple questions:
---
1. Will we be able to make the current in-game alcohol? Like, can we make wine out of mutfruit and bourbon or whiskey from corn? Or find recipes for the different beers we already have? Or can we only make new derivatives using the current drinks as ingredients?
---
2. Is Biv just drinking buddy from FO4? If so, please tell me he comes included with all the jokes.
---
Sixth rule of fight club: there is noooooo rulenumebrsix. 
---
Would be nice to spawn inside my house. #itjustworks
---
Same i have a great laser rifle but its for emergencies only. Otherwise i have to go looking for crystal to repair it.
---
Yes, that character is 100% built for PVP. It just sucks when I'm fighting over a workshop and, let's say, have died and am sneaking my way back towards the workshop. Hiding up in some cliffs or something, and then as soon as I get in range the hostile player can see me on the radar regardless of crouching, standing, invis or anything. It's really only 100% effective against unskilled PVP'ers.
---
Yeh I've almost done it good luck re gaining your atoms friend 
---
Stick two players in there in PA. Fallout rockem sockem robots. 
---
oh wow! ok thanks for the advice, i will do it tonight
---
thanks!
---
Only hiring mods because they have experience being mods is ridiculous though. ü§£ Where would someone start then? A dn Neopets fan forum? Hire people who actually give a shit about this community, not ex-mods of failed subs and forums who are just looking to flex that 'e-peen' and reinforce their god complexes. 
---
I for one wouldn‚Äôt mind a Deathclaw x Scorchbeast fanfic where their child is born to be a demon creature and eater of worlds.
---
Level 1 turrets. But still, like 20 of them. One dude with a sword shouldn't be able to blast through 20 of any kind of turret. 
---
I asked this in the other thread, but how is the builder 'no clipping' around the 7:00 mark?
---
Yeah, personally I like cait more myself, but it's all personal preference
---
I carry around a set of reflect 50% block damage knuckles for bloody melee builds.  A guy was crying that he does 1400 damage and I should be dead.  I let him know he did 700 to himself.
---
Hmm how much 50 cal ammo for all of them ?
---
Absolutely. Best of luck.
---
This is better than the lvl 101 who decided to steal the junkyard from me (lvl 12) then proceeded to kill me with a TSE shotty.  Real tough guy. Seriously made me hate the game for a couple hours. 
---
Honestly why steal the workshop I intentionally left all extractors unlocked. Just take the crap inside I don't mind. Nope needs to take it over and then when called out says he didn't know I was lvl 12 after he kills me a second time.
---
Guess he felt bad after I called him out and proceeded to follow me to flatwoods and drop some stuff. Shot at me with the TSE to get my attention.. can't make this shit up. He motioned towards the bag I looked at it and the contents inside. Took nothing stared and him as a final F You and left. I don't need his sorry ass apology or his shit.
---
I know long rant but shit had me pissed.
---
Big sad
---
Honestly I don't see the difference in someone RP'ing a raider and griefing.  It's been pretty much the definition of raiders in fallout.
---
&gt; Either you can give a 4 sentence rundown of how dr works or you cant. If you cant dont be condescending to other people who cant. Thank you for confirming that the only people who actively engage in PvP use this duped OP gear though. 
---
First, I farmed my Gauss rifle legitimately, so that's a no-go on that. Complain about op and duped weapons all you want, that doesn't mean the person who has something good is immidieatly a duper. Also something being "OP" is not only subjective, its usually a crutch people like you use when they lose so they can feel as though they aren't just bad at the game.  
---
 Second, here's the wiki link, Its literally too complicated to explain in 4 sentences, and since you STILL wont look it up yourself I think you just want to stay ignorant.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
Its for fallout 4 because we haven't been able to get the exact numbers in 76, however it seems as though its exactly the same.
---
&gt;  It's cute you ignore the "I can tank everything in PvE" part tho; apparently I have *no actual information* but manage to build a character that tanks three scorchbeasts at once.  
---
Because its pretty easy to tank 3 scorch-beasts at once. Its not impressive, the fact you think it is shows that you're out of your depth playing an RPG.
---
Will have to check my charisma when I get on. I recently moved some points around it it may only be 8 now
---
&gt;  There's so many chances to stash your junk its kinda silly to do anything with workshops all junked up. Stash box is first thing i build when i cap shops. Often 2 or 3. Plop em down right next to the extractors so i don't get caught running from one end of gorge junkyard to the other with that precious handful of screws and gears. 
---
This is what my whole point is, if you KNOW you might die, why carry all your junk? happy to see even some new players aren't as stupid as some of the vets.
---
Most people leave things in that store and it has everything players need so its an unofficial lobby. That store has something you can use instead of just a vendor so it seems more appealing. Though i check all the vendors as ive found really good items at the other ones even though i too run to his store immediately.
---
I think it's a pretty popular sentiment that we should at least get the same kind of turrets that are in PVE, like the ones at Harpers Ferry or inside the Nuke Bunkers. Not only that, but I'd like to see programable turrets that allow you to choose creatures only, players only, all targets, fire on sight and things like that.
---
As long as they don‚Äôt go 200 years into the future and bring out that Diamond City radio guy, I‚Äôm fine with it. Or the kid that replaced him peddling his water (yeah, I killed the DJ, sue me). 
---
I‚Äôm a Vegas person, so I say bring back Wayne Newton from FONV. 
---
Canned versions could have slightly reduced effects as well.  Obviously the canned version shouldn't be just as good as fresh.  But agree that for some of the harder to make recipes it would be worth it if you could make batches and can/preserve.
---
I'm sorry, I moved camp when I went to whitespring for more light.  But I'm delighted to know that you and your kids loved it.  I'll likely be revisiting builds like this, and would be happy to have you in the future.
---
I'll go ahead and point out that it is in fact DLC, just not paid DLC. It is downloadable content and it is being released as an addition to an existing game.
---
Are you selecting perception and then choosing a strength card. It chooses what special you selected before you chose the card.
---
Oof
---
I'd just be happy if I could dilute them down to normal stimpacks. I almost never need a super and am quite capable of double tapping the button if I do. 
---
Imma try summoning u/Ladydevann
---
Yes! I'd like to see them integrate some features like they have/had in ARK, as far as turrets. They give you the option to set them to things like fire on anything that's in range, fire on creatures only, fire on players only, fire a warning shot etc... -- if they really want turrets to be relevant for any reason they need a massive damage/resist buff and some features like that. otherwise, they are basically noisy decorations.
---
So you can choose a special and then a perk card, they don't have to be in the same pool. If you go to perk cards through Endurance and then go to a strength perk card you will get +1 Endurance and the perk card from strength.  I made that mistake too.
---
I used to always make a tent with a tinkers bench, cooking station, box and bed etc. for passers by. Stopped after realising it was probably pissing off the people who just wanted to pay 25 caps for a shot at some plans.
---
So much for rebuilding the wasteland I guess!
---
Speak for yourself. 3/4 of the time it's raining or rad storm on my base when I spawn in the game. 
---
Hah, no way! I saw this place before, you were right near my old camp. If you noticed someone sneaking in the hills, watching you through the trees but not coming closer, that was totally me.
---
1.5X, great I can work that in for one of the calculations. I guess I can grab another super sledge and time the power attack.
---
Could you tell me what you use and how much damage is displayed in the pipboy?
---
This sentiment that people can't take a workshop if you have it because they could technically go somewhere else is asinine. Server hopping IS NOT a game mechanic. But do you know what is a game mechanic? the fact workshops give resources scaled so a team of 4 could reasonably share them. If you want them to yourself, that's fine, but the whole "If you attack my workshop you're a griefer" thing is just pathetic. Its not griefing, you just can't handle PvP in a game that intrinsically has pvp.  
---
Seriously, why does engaging in something that the game allows you to do, has frankly been upgraded and made easier though patches, make you a griefer? I don't get this whole playing the victim thing kids like you love to do, but its not only sad, its just factually incorrect.

Ii built my camp to be visible out the back door of the Lewisberg train station.  I like to invite people to use my camp and offer them food and beverages when they visit.
---
Could be any high level that passed by the area that triggered them. It's a crappy system that punishes new players.
---
Feral Hands hahaha get that man in the ring!
---
&gt;Also those wendigos were fighting because one was scorched.
---
Yes, that's what I said, or meant if it were unclear.
---
Thanks for replying guys, about time fallout needs some transportation..üòë
---
Yeah the food/meats in this game is too tedious to be fun. I used to collect meat but honestly with how much I even play nowadays, it's not worth the effort/time because it just isn't fun and it'll expire too quickly. I stick with nonspoilable foods like canned dog food or Halloween candy mostly. 
---
High power security system. One really good mirv grenade and you don‚Äôt anything. 
---
&gt; You lose the debate if you downvote or get emotional.
---
By your rules, you lose. Your entire argument is peppered with emotion, appeals to emotion, shaming, exclamation points, etc.

This has got to be a glitch. There's no reason enemies that high should spawn in the forest. Ever. For any reason. I was passing by Lakeside Cabins one night and the whole place was overrun with high 60's feral ghouls. The previous owner was long gone off the server. I dispatched all of them to prevent them taking down a poor newb but it left me shaking my head. I would've pooped myself had I come across that scene just out of the vault. 
---
Come to think of it, I don't think even a nuke dropped in the forest spawns enemies that high. I think 50's is the highest I've ever seen.
---
It would probably be like the WoW BFA AMA where they hand-picked questions and then talked about a related topic instead of answering the question directly.  The answer to a number of questions are things like 'cost &amp; potential earnings' which are things gamers don't want to hear.  Not to mention developers seem unwilling to admit fault but to be fair I suspect a lot of the time it's not necessarily the developers alone and something more like corporate forcing them to quickly restructure the game before launch to include a cash shop or whatever.  Also something gamers don't want to hear about.  I.e. A number of changes made in BFA were specifically related to time-gating the player base to force them to stay subbed, so naturally those are questions they've been told by corporate not to answer.

Its your subconscious wanting him to actually have something.
---
Seriously, what is the deal with his inventory? He should have the most weapon/armor plans out of anyone, instead He has like 5 types of junk. Whoopdie f?!*ing doo
---
I see. Curious about the buzzblade, in Vats, does it hit multiple times if you hold the button down or does it swing the weapon once?
---
You seem to be able to speak English, why are you limiting yourself to just people fluent  Spanish?
---
You can change your special points around at level 50+ so don‚Äôt worry too much unless your missing perks that you need now and not later. 
---
I have a pole that connects my generators to the rest of my house and the goddamn ghouls hate it and kill it.
---
Dunno where it's ¬£13 but it's ¬£15 at cex. 
---
I'll probably be needing ballistic fiber, plastic, rubbery, steel and adhesive. And yeah, I'm still on around that time.
---
If youre on now I can do it for you

I had a camp just next to the exit from the Blackwater mine, the one under the power pylon by Whitesprings station, and the number of times I spawned inside rocks beside the exit  was amusing. Annoying too, because I always had to drop down to the railway  lines and climb up to my camp
---
Just so you guys know, Bethesda net is working and sim settlements conquerer is lit. 
---
This is gonna have (potentially) awesome uses for all the alcohol perks now 
---
I had one setup, 
---
Was looking for fighters. 
---
Was going to pay mini 100 caps to show, 300 caps to win. 
---
Good for low level players trying to make it!! 
---
I used a lv. 50 deathclaw gauntlet and my pipboy damage is really inaccurate due to the mutation bugs, it jumps around all over the place when I load in and out of zones because mutations will load multliple times sometimes or snap shot and start stacking with each other, I'm not exactly sure how it's bugging out I just know whenever I look in the pipboy I see a different number.  May or may not be related to having been a beta character.  I mostly wanted to give you an additional perspective on building melee chars around power attacks.
---
The problem of course is that the entire card system is stupid, and every suggestion other than ‚Äúrip it out and replace it with a normal perk/skill/attribute system‚Äù is basically a bandaid. 
---
Having said that - perk load out decks exist as a mod. Get it on the nexus!
---
Because frankly at this point, its starting to get pathetic how adverse people like you are to PvP at all. I  will never understand how people can play this victim card  so hard that the insist all player interaction be sterilized.   
---
Its a post-Apocalypse, some people will murder you, break your stuff, and take the rest.  Workshops aren't your personal camp. It's a multiplayer game, you don't get the right to decide all player interaction will never effect you, its just not designed that way.  
---
Go play Fallout 4 and let the rest of us actually enjoy the wasteland. 
---
Nice build! I would have upvoted 10 more times on imgur if I could have - so many jerks over there. There's no way that build should have downvotes. 
---
Nice work!
---
They could do like they did with Nuka World and just have some random asshole with a guitar comment on events and sometimes tell a story or sing his own song. When i got Nuka World i forgot all about Diamond City radio.
---
No, this was actually content that was supposed to be in release, but was held off as it wasn't ready. Like the Frontier Scouts. DLC is content that while developed during base game development was intended to be included in release. Do you want a link that explains the difference between content in an update and DLC?
---
There are also a large number of people who would hate this change. The game isn't designed for you to shut out player interaction. 
---
Not all of them, use Weapon Artisan for the double condition than make sure you use Gunsmith for the slower break rate and have Luck of the Draw to randomly repair your weapon. Testa Rifle doesn't break quick, Gamma guns don't, Gatling Lasers are okay. 
---
I was hoping they would add it in the atomic shop or as a rare drop completing BOS events
---
They jealous.
---
Definitely not getting into The Good Place. 
---
Unforeseen outcomes screwing over the best of intentions. 
---
If we were still gonna get private servers, we could eventually have a ‚Äúperk/skill/ability score‚Äù system and get rid of cards entirely. 
---
Don‚Äôt hold your breath though. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt like the character advancement from fallout 1,2,3 and NV. 
---
Did someone say Meat farm? ***The boys are back in town!***
---
That‚Äôs because cards are stupid for this kind of game. 
---
So True!
---
If you have a bit of awareness, each core can be recharged from empty to over 100% by crafting the empty ones into ultracite fusion cores.  They work fine in PA.  I've gotten them as low as 0/100 for reuse, like one step away from depletion.   Only catch is it takes violet flux...
---
You rock!!!
---
Mistress quest line is fantastic! I miss the NPCs helping to tell the story, but of all the quests they did this one right via holotape. Definitely one of the best in fallout for feeling and rewards that keep on giving. 
---
Now that another one...PLASTICS! No matter how many stuffs i scrap..when i make to bulk, plastics are always in short supply. I am beginning to think plastics, screws and adhesives are cousins
---
I think you're talking about when I'm hanging on the edge of the cliff with a conduit in hand?  If so I'm just standing there you can stick to the sides of foundations.
---
I wish that I could spawn in Nuke Zones I really enjoy picking the flowers.
---
Well whats youre problem if this is one of the few. Also I don‚Äôt need the turrets to clear it but its helpful to get xp and loot even while im just fixing weapons or armor
---
Also its not hard to keep up it almost never gets destroyed
---
I picked up a level 45 laser rifle and put some mods on it to try it, I can't craft them. I have level 5 gs and lotd rank 1 but still broke from full repair in less than 200 rounds
---
No longer works for smelting or ammo, I just get the exact amount made and the Perk never procs. Broken as of last patch at least for me.
---
"I visited West Virginia and all I got was this lousy shirt and my tatos smashed"
---
I really just want to bring some attention to this issue. I feel like everybody is always complaining about ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù type issues and they‚Äôre not paying attention to some of the issues that can significantly affect the actual gameplay. If I‚Äôm fighting a queen, I shouldn‚Äôt have to watch my fusion core gauge to make sure that I manually swap it out before my power armor consumes all of my laser‚Äôs ammo. 
---
 Wheres my Ultracite PA paints..... or skins.... or entire new over grown look......... or ghillie suit PA....... or big fuzzy teddybear.................. 
---
I‚Äôve wondered why can‚Äôt we build a fridge or one of those milk dispenser things in our camp, provide power to it then be able to refrigerate the food to extend the life of it. 
---
I bought 2 games for friends hoping to journey into Appalachia together. Alas, no those two are too busy with Netherwingüò≠
---
No worries, I‚Äôll keep an eye out. 
---
There are no groups like that I'm aware of. I have met up randomly with some Spanish speakers in game (I'm Mexican-American myself) and we occasionally play together on PS4. It would be pretty interesting to have a Spanish speaking group though.
---
I liked my old base too but I personally like practicality over it being nice to look at(might change it later though)
---
Wow.
---
THIS 1000%. 
---
Definably nerfed, we were getting to much value from a perk so it has been adjusted. Tested this enough for it to be reproducible.
---
I think these stories are a better parallel to how low optimization of characters can lead to more vulnerable builds. 
---
We need to grind and farm more so we play more.
---
So you destroy them out of petty
---
What is the secondary use? I've been scrapping away as well. 
---
Mole Miner.
---
Also, used, blackened and beat up.
---
In the end, if it‚Äôs that big of a deal you should just switch servers if you ask me
---
I have experenced the same things with hostile enemies when i shoot the it heals them
---
Ah is chameleon a perk then ! 
---
Omg that‚Äôs awesome
---
Mhm.
---
BRING BACK THE BLACKBIRD PAINTJOB!!!
---
I think it has vastly improved and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been due to the thinning of the duper herd stashes.  The servers aren‚Äôt being overwhelmed by some players with insane quantities on them, and that‚Äôs reflected in less and less server disconnects for the rest of us. 
---
Once more content rolls out, I think the game will be on much more solid footing.
---
The resources for the game to remember is a non-issue. The CAMP system pulls from your Stash and inventory as you build, they could easily include an option to place PA chassis under the build mode and they count towards your budget if you so choose to use them in that fashion. 
---
Second, no, players won't "care" so to speak, but they'll still grief. They'll destroy just to be assholes - everybody has seen that too. 
---
Your idea of being able to inspect what's on the frame would be cool. 
---
"In the realm of Appalachia rode a stranger one fine day..."
---
That would suck.
---
What does that mean?
---
Yep. Thank you.
---
Yeah, I tried to get friends onto the game at launch and during beta, now they just laugh at me for trying to convince them :(
---
Sure no problem!
---
It would be severely abused by people who think that everybody who they can't kill is a cheater.
---
On the other hand, if it would allow to somehow flag the people who harras others, and then it would join those people up to different servers based on that flag, that could be nice.
---
Could we also have a Claw Machine filled with legendary weapons?
---
Gottcha
---
That gets rid of the stress
---
The weather, at least when  I log in, is always rain or rad storm. I have to leave my base area (which is near Bolton greens) to get clear weather usually. 
---
I dont want it to change more. Just give a fair variety. 
---
Sweet. Thanks.
---
Sorry man, I've long since completed the quest.
---
There was a YouTube  video with the guy who made it
---
Good to know! The phantom items certainly do exist when looting so I figured it was a real possibility. I read too many scaremongering stories here. 
---
I've never had the opportunity to drop all my gear to check if my weight is neutral. Too much stuff and it seems risky for the payoff (useless knowledge).
---
I cant wait to see the host of bugs these new stat effects will introduce  as they conflict with mutations, chems, etc.
---
