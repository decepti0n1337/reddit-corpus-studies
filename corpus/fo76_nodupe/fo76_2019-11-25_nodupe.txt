Difficult to do that with SBs. I killed a legendary SB by the pervayer's shop today, and it disappeared. No idea where the hell it spawned from because they fly everywhere.

---
I got my second passive win last night when the game spawned me inside the terrain and that spot just happened to stay in the safe zone the entire match.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Yeah he has 2 stairs one on top of  the other. The first one is also not in line with the block but just touches its edge with the middle of the stairs. He must have started with one high and than changed it to create the upper deck.
---
We tried to remove everything around the stairs and the immobile foundations with no results.  Even created a second access to the upper deck, to make the game think those stairs are now useless.
---
it's also a day 1 camp so i think some of it ,might have been built following old building rules that don't apply anymore.
---
In any case the situation is so desperate that he already decided to move and change place,so a solution would just be a useful info for the future.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
i know how to launch nuke, but i can use your help.. i did a solo nuke run today but at the last stage 2 randoms launched it 
---
be prepared for it tho, you gonna need a lot of supplies
---
I usually will go to Vault 76 wait until about midnight then travel over to Crevasse Dam and head towards Dyer and most times see the blooms glowing.
---
What specially should I buy? Stimpaks obvi? I run auto shotgun with enforcer (still ranking.)
---
I‚Äôll try to grind a bit early
---
Dumb thic sir.

&gt; random ghouls ...CAN ride the elevator.

and the Wendigo!

Tweaked Auto and Powerful Auto have always looked like that for me.

Fallout 76 is made of a lot of loyal members. Most people were super outraged by everything that's happened in the past year, and stopped playing. So the remaining players are loyal, and more likely to buy into this sorta stuff, even if only for a month. And a lot of the people who are super casual and play occasionally often times dont even have shops set up, so they're hard to find. And online less on top of that. And people who play a ton who you'll probably come by are a lot more likely to buy into this stuff too.
---
Anyways, you're correct. I certainly see at LEAST that many. But there are a lot of variables.
---
You saw camps with more than one scrap box?
---
I roleplay as a deadbeat that drinks too much and can't ever get financially ahead. Just like real life
---
bro it is literally connect the dots
---
Sweet okay mate will do now !!
---
If you pretend its an unfinished and aimless but lengthy DLC for Fallout 4 that has its own overpriced creation club to make up for the nothing else to do after finishing the roughly 10-20 hours it takes to hit max level and run out of quests, sure it's definitely worth $10.
---
I dont really rp, and my group isnt super heavy into it either. But I am a part of BoS 76. We have a chain of command, and you do technically need to follow orders given to higher ups, and address everyone appropriately. Tho it's a lot more like a bunch of us players kinda hanging out. Even so, it's a good time. We've got military camps all over. And we've even got players on all platforms and something crazy like over 200 members. So I guess I don't have any stories in particular, but we've done training and stuff. Especially with initiates. And we've gone through and conquered like all workshops and stuff, all in brotherhood outfits and whatnot.
---
Fun stuff. If anyone ever wants to join us, shoot me a dm!
---
A lot of the players just go about &amp; do their own thing. So although there was a lot of outrage on here, Reddit is only a small part of the player base &amp; on xbox over half of the camps that I have visited are fallout 1st subscribers. It's more popular than you probably think.
---
Could also be a region thing I'm Asia pacific
---
I would be curious to hear from the experts too - I use an automatic version in mobs for things like Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, and Whitesprings, to tag as many as I can so I can loot/farm legendaries.
---
I‚Äôm not a bloodied build, but that seems like sound theory anyway. :)
---
No. I've found six scrap-boxes open to all visitors, and one in locked room.
---
Is possible to make multiple scrap-boxes in the camp??
---
Ah, I see it, cheers mate! That is confusing.
---
Is it a subreddit?
---
Thanks Bobby!
---
Were you wearing a hat? She HATES hats.
---
I feel like I've walked into a fissure that's been hit by a nuke, it's 'sealed'.  Does Fissure Prime not do that.
---
Any automatic mod removes that block on the handmade,no matter what skin or not you use.
---
If you switch back to semi auto,the reciever will be full.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a problem too.  I try to have a weaker weapon on all my characters for events like this one.
---
I have both, placed in a walled-in single room inside my camp.   The collectron does not need to actually walk around to function, and the annoying voice is muffled in there....   plus it saves judgment and possible looting because of being a first subscriber
---
I have the same, auto renew was supposed to charge but no charges happened, still use 1st benefits as usual. No atoms received yet either
---
I was thinking automatic but I like my lever action so I looked it up and people said the rifleman perks work no matter if it‚Äôs auto or charging, I don‚Äôt believe them that just doesn‚Äôt seem possible to me, what do you think?
---
Send a message. I ask people if I can add them for shops. Most of the time it's all good. I usually only add random friends if they ask first.
---
Hm, I haven't come across a chef yet, but that's a fun idea. Given how many people seemed to get the refrigerators, I'd expect to see this more often. Camp could be a restaurant... display cases with cooking utensils &amp; plates.  
---
You might also check [https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FO76roleplay/) &amp; [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) if you haven't already...
---
You're the one that said that out of 7 camps that there was **at least** 1 visible scrap box.
---
I don't hate 94 raids, I just ignore them since I play solo and my main character's weapon is a not even legendary set of knuckles and she doesn't wear power armor. I went in once for one of the daily/weekly challenges and fighting two Mirelurk Queens in heavily irradiated water went exactly as expected for her.
---
I‚Äôve got a weak weapon to tag with on all my characters and normally it is an explosive .38 pipe weapon.
---
Theres only 2 mods and 1 of them u get from scrapping which is the heavy barrel. Don't think vendors sell heavy barrel
---
How much vintage nukashine is on your menu?  
---
I just recently built my camp at one of the locations where people can wake up from a passed out drunk nukashine haze in a bar... hoping that it'll still work &amp; they won't spawn elsewhere instead.
---
Only really 2 mods: heavy barrel which is learned by scrapping and prime receiver which comes from SBQ drops.
---
Quad fire rate automatic. Medium to short range.
---
Awesome, thanks guys.
---
Also very interested to see what platform your on. 
---
Just to let you know, I have started a new NW group r/FO76_NuclearWinter , I would like to see more posts like this make there way there. 
---
Not at all saying this is what your doing BUT there is a big increase of this ‚Äúhacking‚Äù wave going around and yes I have seen confirmed hacking on PC which I believe to be real, i.e AimBotting. But also think it‚Äôs almost a copycat game of chinese whispers happening because everyone is extra paranoid since the recent increase in hacking being brought to, maybe the correct word is more public attention, basically creating a load of people that maybe need a little more time adjusting to the game, rather than assuming that other good players are hackers. Players have had some hours stack up in NW. Your going to come up against those god like players where you‚Äôll be downed and dead before you even know what‚Äôs happening, i get it to me, not fun but just part in this PvP BR mode. 
---
I am not condoning hacking nor am I saying I don‚Äôt think Beth has a problem on there hands at the moment with it, just that yes, it‚Äôs an issue that they are definitely aware of and by Q1 I reckon we will be seeing an improvement of these horrible long term bugs as they will be desperately trying to stable it as soon as possible to keep its remaining player base and hopefully attract new players and OG release players back in game for Wastelanders DLC
---
This is just my opinion. Feel the need to state i‚Äôm a PS4 player but not on some cult stuff.
---
hasnt there been one wandering around site alpha for a few months now?
---
It‚Äôs called fallout76settlements
---
Happy Cake Day üç∞
---
But is it affected by non automatic riflemen perks???????(  sorry this is my main question)
---
Caps? That's optimistic. I'd assume IRL US dollars, myself.
---
Just beer. My camp is falling apart faster than I can repair it. My crops are dead.  My pet Brahmin is malnourished.
---
From what I‚Äôve been told it governed by what the barrel does. Rifleman for semi. Commando for auto and shotgunner for shotguns. 
---
I‚Äôve only dabbled in using them but it seems like the range is a little misleading as I‚Äôve been unable to reach the range it states. Maybe that range is the arc bouncing range. 
---
If your hurting For fusion cells I‚Äôd stick with semi or charged barreled. And auto if your not. As for a companion weapon. The .45/.38 combat rifle for mid to long range is always a good pick up. And a 10mm pistol as a back can‚Äôt hurt.
---
I rp as a caveman.  I live in a cave, only use bone hammers and spears and react to strangers with extreme suspicion.  I like killing animals and don't understand any technology.   Life is pretty hard but it's nice when people want to take photos with me
---
I‚Äôd hope to see lots of old British talk, like cheerio and shit because culture stagnated after WW2. Cricket bats instead of baseball bats. Instead of vaults, underground bunkers and shit, old phone boxes, hell even police boxes since the 50s are the stagnation point.
---
Lol. Hmm, ü§îI think I had heard her old man was killed by a man in a Stetson.
---
Looks better ..lol
---
You don't "buy" the game, you just give Bethesda all of your bank account and credit card info, as well as your social security number, name of your first pet, and mother's maiden name :P
---
She basically can‚Äôt hit me due to my perks and stats but her radiation damage is the real killer
---
ESOs community said the same thing then in became mega populare xD.
---
Simply uninstall the game and purchase Outerworlds.
---
I'm trying to complete my dream on this game: a good [two handed build.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1c7885&amp;d=ss2se2c72cu2eu0er2i44ir2a04lu2l71e52p10sf2ej4au2s42sm1sn0&amp;w=pa0p80p90ii0iq2cr0e12e41if2i30ij0ia0&amp;m=c298h3i6&amp;nw=&amp;n=Two%20handed%20melee%20no%20pa) But I fucking can't with this! My STR would be effectively maxed at approx. 6!
---
Same. When I came back, the vending machines changed everything for me.
---
To be fair, you actually need to have a player base before it can turn toxic.
---
You must don the unyielding sentinel I‚Äôve heard so much about
---
Notes on Tesla‚Äôs:
---
1. Some mods are unattainable (lobbing) and can only be acquired by Murg or random drop.  If you get a lobbing variant legendary, it‚Äôs VALUABLE!
---
2. The sound bug is a thing.  This is easily fixed by swapping weapons and back.  (If anyone complains)
---
3. The shotgun variant works with rifleman perks.
---
4. The legacy explosive variants do not arch.  They treat the rounds as a ballistic visually and mechanically.  (I don‚Äôt recommend them)
---
5. Aiming at the ground is effective vs. players.  
---
6. Batteries included reduces your ammo weight for this gun.  
---
Hope these tidbits help.  I use a Automatic Vampiric Tesla often,  but not as a primary weapon.  It‚Äôs great for tagging and as long as your shooting, your nearly invincible.  Staggers or reloading are the only worries with an automatic vampiric variety.
---
Everyone raid the dev room. They can't ban us all
---
When they drop on me, there is nothing to loot. Happened twice already üò•
---
Most things come back. But a few still haven't.
---
I've found the heavy barrel at vendors a few times, but like they said, you're better off scrapping.
---
Rule one of the wasteland. Cardio. 
---
Really no. Just enjoy the game.
---
The closest I've gotten is making my main an Enclave Officer: he avoids mutations, is always in X-01 armor, Scout armor, or the Officer's outfit, only uses plasma or gauss weapons, and is stupidly patriotic.
---
Based on the curators radiation comments and saying the remains seem only 20 years old I figured they died in the Great War not the Civil War. 
---
Like they are unearthing the bodies of park employees who died when the bombs fell.
---
Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated! The more I learn about wood armor the more I appreciate the variety of nuance in the game. There are so many niche opportunities to mix things up that it keeps the game fun.
---
I'm on PS4. Usually on later in the evening after the kids are in bed, like 10 pm ET. Generally have to play with the mic muted due to young sleeping people, but it is what it is.
---
[removed]
---
It would be interesting to see how they pull that off. Pretty much the entire lore is based on a war between China and the US, and afaik vault-tec is American based. 
---
But still, a Chinese perspective would be interesting.
---
Still waiting for that mosaic floor to return. Dang it i regret not purchasing that so much... with that being said, maybe some items won‚Äôt return or taking much longer to do so and other things return just a few weeks after they vanished from the atom store (even for a discount, like the bungalow). Waiting for over half a year now for that floor...
---
I think theres 8 code pieces per silo.
---
Use Nukacrypt for the codes.  (Decoding the piece is a PITA)
---
Take some circuitry and steel with you.  Troubleshooters weapon will be quite beneficial...
---
Ha ha!  Otis.
---
Strange , I have swapped at least 4 of my toons over a half hour and it all remained there.
---
I still haven't gone down the power armor path yet. I always have some around for dealing with nuke zones or trucking heavy loads, but have not intentionally built around it yet. Emphasis on yet ;-)
---
Maybe it's visual, level up strength to 2 and see if it says 2. ü§î
---
Dude no worries, take your time, enjoy the ride. You and I are on the same boat.
---
I've been playing just as long and am level 128. Not much of a difference if you ask me. I've run into people who are over 900, to that I just scratch my head
---
That's a lot of junk in that post apocalyptic trunk you got there.
---
Vault-Tec University Jumpsuit UA is in the game.
---
How do you get them I‚Äôm 109 and don‚Äôt know how to get them
---
He was ??? now he's a super mutant who regularly escapes from the penitentiary and tries to hole up in the generator house at Grafton damn.
---
I had this happen but the reverse where my stat was enough but I couldn‚Äôt equip the cards to add up to the total special value.  I don‚Äôt know when this started happening but later it fixed itself when I leveled up like another 20 or so levels.  But it absolutely did prevent me from equipping perk cards when I had the total special number avail me to support them so it ended up with equipped perk cards not adding up to total but the special not saying any unused slots either.   This was on xbox
---
Im in the exact same boat actaully. Lol. On late after the kids and old lady pass out. Sadly im on xbox, otherwise id give you my bolstering sentinel wood set. Im just 2 pieces away from finishing a bolstering sentinel thorn armor set. Im pretty excited. Lol.
---
I hear you about the subtle nuances in the game. I think thats one of my favorite parts about this game. I really enjoy diving into different builds and figuring out what works and what doesnt. What compliments certian builds and such. Im not saying im the first, but i was on the frontier of the junkies builds as well. Thats kind of where i started really digging into different builds. The game is very complex, you just have to dig below the surface.
---
The Hunters Hood is in the game available for trade (albeit not in a ToS friendly way) as well as the Fasnacht Skull Mask (and Sun, Old Man Winter, etc)
---
This is for PC at least, duping for the win!
---
Oh and the laser musket also
---
Its fine as long as it protecc that which it makes look thicc.
---
Yup you can find them available if you look hard enough, pretty easy
---
Then grind badges for the high capacity mod and that sweet 100 bonus weight.
---
Run a second char with the quest at the end where you need to collect them but don‚Äôt craft the radshield.  Use that char to farm them and mule them over, not great but way better than trying to find them on your primary with the quest already completed.
---
It is, you have to look at it in your inv. then theres a button for pc, dont remember what it is, but you can rename them
---
it is in game, iirc you need tk be in the "view item" menu to rename
---
Yes it is possible.  And you definitely should if you have multiple sets.  Inspect the chasis to rename.
---
Also if you are doing Encrypted please stick with it til the very end. I used a recall card today just to have a lvl 271 conduit all 3 (good on you we tried our best to wipe it out quick) quit the event when he died 2 minutes in causing all the other high levels to leave as well leaving me and 3 others to try and conduit and do damage causing in a failure.
---
TBH if I rolled something like that it would be going right back into the scrip machine üíÅ
---
Well. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Well I said cut or not added *Yet* Also the dev room has a whole bunch of items, im counting legit ways to get it, also the Faschnacht mask names are the unused names, like Napoleon was called Soldier.
---
I found jumping off a cabin roof by leaping into the air gave me just the right amount of height to go into revival state without actually dying
---
Yes, you can in some cases. Aktos Pharma mod can be applied to any backpack. Other mods, probably not.
---
What are they used for?
---
Because...reasons.
---
I agree with you, I will not accept random friend requests but I would like to be able to bookmark and be able to find certain player vendors again when they are on line, that would be a huge plus....
---
I had mine hidden in a locked room for a while, like you said,  to avoid the possible (unnecessary) confrontation.  But then I decided that most of the people complaining  occasionally buy atoms in the store, so it really isn't any different.  Actually 1st is a better deal than buying atoms. I think the heat is starting to die down anyway.
---
The worst part is when one person does it the whole lobby starts fighting and racing just to try get the kill before someone 1 shots it so they actually get a drop which just makes it even worse.
---
Yep happens all the time
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good shout! Hopefully I‚Äôll someone will help a brother out soon haha
---
Allow us to set our own auto scrap list
---
No \[chuckles\], not at all \[bursts into laughter\]. You do got them THUNDER THIGHS goin on though.
---
Looks you just added to strength but picked cards from other special stats to get
---
I was recently in the Uranium fever event with another 200+ player and a lvl 34. The other 200+ player was one shooting the legendaries until I got on my mic and said ‚Äúthat was a real dick move....‚Äù he came back and said ‚Äúisnt the point to kill them?‚Äù And I responded ‚Äúyes, but let everyone else get a chance to hit them as well so they get loot as well, do I really need to tell you this at level 200+??‚Äù He apologized and stopped after that, are there really players like this that just have no clue still?
---
Only on PC or console too? Asking you or anyone who sees this
---
It's not exactly like Bethesda meant for PC players to get them, they exploited their way in to the dev room to get it
---
It's a very rare drop from the SBQ's corpse.
---
Last 4 or 5 times now at the SBQ event some ass hat wore their set and I crashed out of the event. We are going to have to start self policing the event and tell others to take that crap off... I own a set but wont wear it in events like this for this very reason....
---
is that the one that is called just ‚Äúcalibrated shocks‚Äù or is that excavator. someone might be able to confirm just not near my PS4 to check
---
[deleted]
---
Do gourmands count?? A cannibalistic RP group that will eat you in very creative ways.
---
Why would you launch it any other way? Just curious, don't get mad
---
You should be able to rename on all platforms
---
Ive been playing since beta and I‚Äôm only 192 on my main and 84 on my alt. I dont know how I see these people in the 300 and 400‚Äôs? Do they play all day long and do nothing else including not work?
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs a plan, might be more in the atomic shop(?) . I‚Äôm currently taking a break from the game and don‚Äôt quite remember
---
A type of syringer.
---
Ty for the info
---
Thats what a buddy just told me. Was hoping to avoid that
---
Not sure
---
I roleplayed the hobo for a while. Now I am roleplaying a hunter. Live in a cabin in the woods. 
---
I had fun playing a travelling merchant, might do it again. Like Grahm. Pastor Vestments and black hat, backpack and a minimalistic camp with a tent and fire.
---
1600 Fiber optics and in another suitcase I found 12 or 14 3 star legendaries. I am assuming someone was trying to transfer and crashed and couldn‚Äôt get back to that server. I waited there for a while and no one came back so I claimed it all.....
---
I used that method to transfer a 3* JE handmade and 15k+ Ultracite 5.56 rounds last night. The entire time I was loading in I was SWEATING like a hooker that missed her period! It was there though but your right we need a safer way. Never again will I be using that method unless it‚Äôs items of little or no value at all. Thanks for sharing, May I add I wish there was a way to transfer caps between characters as well but I honestly have no idea on how that would work or don‚Äôt have any ideas :(
---
I hate you because you are right.
---
If you're focused on PvE, Quad might not be the best choice. Quad Teslas are the go-to meta gun for PvP. For PvE you may consider Vampire's, Anti-armor, Bloodied, or Junkies depending on your build.
---
Yeah, not all Ultracite mod plans have the same drop rate. You gotte be very lucky or buy it from someone else.
---
Thanks for the answer. I had no idea.
---
try all the different vendors at whitespring. or the enclave bunker to maybe. remember to our hard bargain on to save some caps. sorry i can‚Äôt be more help dude
---
trade me a few?
---
No problem. There's plenty I still don't know. üòÅ
---
Ah man, I struggled a ton with that place! Did for a long long time. Can absolutely help! Gt?
---
No no, let him keep the doors open or on a 0 lock pick skill. I'll gladly keep capturing him for that sweet 150 cap completion.
---
There is a behemoth that spawns in the middle of a pond I used to place my C.A.M.P. by. Even after the last update, every time I kill it, the corpse disappears and spawns back in where it originally starts in the middle of the pond. At that point it's un-lootable. I have to spam the button grabbing whatever I can before the body vanishes.
---
I use a bloodied Tesla with charging barrel
---
Bruh, im happy for you. Its a big ass difference in performance. You will notice the difference immediately. Its definitely worth the upgrade in my experience. 
---
Also, One thing to keep in mind, buying a new CPU means a new motherboard too, so when you switch motherboards, your gonna need that windows OS license key handy or you gonna have to buy a new windows. I found that out the hard way.
---
putlotioninbskt
---
I don‚Äôt understand how this image shows that your strength should be 1 ?
---
In my personal experience I personally would play Fallout 4 over 76 but I'm doing my best to enjoy fallout 76 as best as I can.
---
Ride on man! Be on in a minute or 2
---
Launcher can get in a bugged state where game will have "Unexpected Error".  Can restart PC to try to fix, or just launch fallout by hand.
---
Second reason is to run multiple instances on one PC.
---
Eta: Sorry this was meant as a reply to Cody's question.  Not the OP.
---
You can't buy it from vendors. Ultracite mods only drop from the SBQ.
---
As much as I hate it when other players one shot everything, it really lies at the feet of Bethesda for not having XP and loot shareable across the board for events
---
I wanted to do a thing like this but I recently found out that all my pictures taken before the last patch were gone. I miss them :(
---
ahhhh makes sense. thanks üí™üèº
---
Except if anyone remembers in the beginning this was not a problem. You used to be able to be safe on the third and fourth floors. The ghouls couldn't get to you. I dont recall which update broke it though.
---
I don‚Äôt personally own any
---
First off thats not a ghoul thats a scribe, second thats what happens when you fail no nut november.
---
NO. If you are thinking about failing no nut november, don't. I believe in you. You must stand strong and push through. Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge, think about how embarassing it will be when you tell your friends that you failed NNN. You must stay strong, I believe in you. Now, good luck on your mission, soldier. ^(I am a bot, and this action was preformed automatically.)
---
The unlabeled one is for excavator
---
I mean technically if you‚Äôre getting it from someone else via trading it is a legit method. They may have exploited to get it, but you got it a legitimate way via trade
---
Are you wearing any armor with strength attributes or eating/drinking anything with perks?
---
This. Maybe it being black makes the whole thing look different.
---
Choosing  SPECIAL Stat to increase is a separate step from selecting a perk card.  The two phases are not related.
---
Your pic gives no indication of your level, so not clear what we are supposed to see.
---
Calabrates shocks, targeting hud, emergency protocols are all rare drops from the Queen. I believe kinetic servos is also rare but am not sure
---
I think because says 4 strength but only one card slot.
---
He's so quick to. By the time I capture him then go to camp I look on the map, BOOM he's out again.
---
Awesome! I‚Äôm helping my husband with dinner so I‚Äôm on and off while I wait! I appreciate your reply!
---
Wait until you encounter the immortal bloatfly.
---
post a video or let's meet up. I'll just build a Tesla and we can try it out. hell I'll give you components and you can build it yourself. Afterwards I'll give you a lesson on how sneak doesn't matter . I'll even give you 1k in caps. 500 up front. Walk the talk or sit down. I'm done talking but I bet your not. My IGN: Pathosa_Augusta . I'm game anytime! I challenge your word against mine, and am offering you a chance to teach me a lesson!  I won't use a Tesla or a handmade and I'm not a sneak build. Let's go keyboard gangster.. this is an official call out. Winner gets to post a video. Come let me embarrass you.
---
i‚Äôm not sure I understand how you think the system works or how your special cards are spited.
---
Based on what i see you‚Äôve gone up 3 levels and put points into STR but picked cards from other stats (or got from a pack).
---
Your stats aren‚Äôt based on the cards you pick, you‚Äôre stats are the limit to how many cards you can slot.
---
Work + Fallout
---
There was an XP glitch that some people took advantage of early on. Also XP has been harder to get in general now than it was before.
---
Btw, there is a world spawn for the 50 cal just south of hemlock holes in the back of a truck. Good one to get and scrap for heavy barrel.
---
Too bad we're on different platforms, sounds like we would have gotten along just fine. I appreciate the offer on the armor, I've been pleasantly surprised by the generosity of the community here and try to pay it forward where I can as well.
---
I'm presently coming from a Junkies build that was kicked off when I found myself sitting on some nice weapons that were worth building a character around. My Bloodied builds were similarly spawned by weapon finds and I now have a melee and stealth commando toon that are outrageously over powered in PVE. So when I turned up some nice Berserkers gear I knew it was time to go down the rabbit hole once again.
---
You have been away a long time brother!

TSE was nerfed months ago, and isn't really a good option for most weapons anymore. 
---
And yes SBs no longer spam their sonic attack. 
---
Which platform are you on?
---
Good to know others feel the same. I'm really hoping we get faction wars or something PvP focused ASAP with wastelanders or the new year... *Le-sigh*
---
Maybe you can answer this. If a crown is over their level number, is that a legendary, or does it only count if there is stars? I got a legendary armor piece off a ghoul with a crown but no stars, so kinda curious.
---
Truth. My camp goes through stages once I find a nice locale.  I like the old transformation photos but I end up scrapping the old ones because of the space. XD I've got steadily 43 pictures I keep deleting and adding to.
---
There should be an antidote that you can use to cure specific mutations, but it would have to be expensive.
---
That's what serums are for.
---
I've heard about that myself. I never got around to it personally, at least I don't remember. A friend of mine always drags me into his server and goes wild west on the golf resort farming the XP from countless ferals
---
For real. I can one hit most things on my melee build, but switch to guns when there is others. Had a guy one shot everything today during the uranium event. Pretty annoying.
---
Yes tse has been nerfed.
---
TS now gives a 25% dmg increas
---
Ex now gives a 20% increase (also demo expert caps at 60% instead off 100%)
---
Sb no longer spam attacks, but they did just add legendary sb I to the game, making those ones much harder
---
New meta is bloodied, seconded by Junkies
---
Sometimes it's not even your own scorchbeast, it's a scorchbeast someone else dropped and you just happened to be in the area, at least that's what happened to me when I've got an empty scorchbeast with no loot drop on me.
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
Each part of "lights" take 1% of your budged. dosnt matter if it is an campfire, an oillamb or only one letter of the Neonletters.so stay in darkness but in an huge camp ;)
---
To me it just looks like he chose to level up strength, but then tabbed over the perks and picked a perk from a different special category.  Maybe OP doesn‚Äôt realize it is possible to do that? The perk card you pick does not override the special you selected to level up in the first part of the level up screen.
---
awesome thanks üí™üèº
---
Grade-A Urban Thunder Buns Baby!
---
I know a bunch of people that haven't gotten the atomic points yet. I have a friend that both her and her husband have 1st subscriptions and paid on the same day with the same card. Husband received the atomic points but wife didn't. Makes zero sense.
---
I have an anti-armor automatic which my commando uses to tag and kill. They are fun.
---
If it goes auto it becomes commando. I tested it.
---
I know! I was trying to read the terminal and they killed me before I could get out of it to fight them! It is absolutely ridiculous
---
I got all mods by scrapping. They are few, however.
---
I just saw a riflegaming vid on them in a new leak
---
This should be commonplace I do this with my main(lvl82) and I got a lever action that does molemen in in two shot on the uranium fever event. I'll put a shot in every dude if theres someone else there. It irks me that low levels feel the need to rush in and kill whatever because that's the 'get it while you can't mentality. Even if it's a one star low level legendary I'd still like my chances bro as well as all involved. And newbies... newer than I wont develop a sense of kill or be killed during events.
---
I always just assumed that they were once BoS members so they‚Äôll have access already
---
Also the only way to get the Steam overlay is to launch outside of BGS Launcher. I do it for the fps counter.
---
TSE was nerfed in Jan or Feb.. Almost a year ago..you sure you didn't quit because they got nerfed lol...you wouldn't be the only salty that quit because of the nerf lol alot of people did
---
Further proof ghouls are just figments of our imagination caused by prolonged radiation exposure.
---
you can launch it from the fallout76.exe if you have modified your .ini for your specific rig.
---
They really killed the explosive perk. Bloodied, junkies or furious automatic weapons are the money now as is vats. If you have any old explosive energy weapons though they're worth alot.
---
I use the nvidia one but not everyone has that so thnx for the tip brother.
---
PC player here and I am a factionless chef! I operate thee Scorchbistro' outta a shop on the lower half of the whitesprings golf course.  After a few Queen runs, I hang at my CAMP and peddle my beast meats. We have fresh Nuka Dark available along with every alcohol in the Wastes. In the mornings most days, I have opossum bacon, rad toad eggs, and deathclaw steak. People have been cool about it but there's been several occasions where they suck too, ya just gotta put yourself out there. 
---
So yeah, I'd REALLLLLLLLLY like a refrigerated vending unit. Maybe make us spend plastic to wrap the food ? Make the Eat o tronics actually hold my meals, have the new thanksgiving table display centerpieces and dishes with places for silverware? (I collect silverware) Loath the fridge. Total waste of atom.
---
No, I left due to combo of work and lack of time to grind for caps at the time.
---
Is it safe to predict that preorders will be low, or do whales return to the sane feeding grounds each season?
---
yut there it is.
---
It's basically a cosmetic. Helmets don't do anything. I don't see why we don't already have it, honestly.
---
Over 200 Neon signs &amp; letters plans and other one plan duplicated in 100+ copies. It was about year ago while ppl were duping actively. ;)
---
Or when they died and flop around and fall back into the fissure.
---
That's just the baby backpack the real one can hold 90pounds with mod
---
Well when I stopped playing energy weapons were uhh...  crap.  I was a melee build.  But was in the hunt for TSE for the pop side.  As everyone had them.
---
What does the pip boy say?
---
It gets really boring.after you have done everything that you want.making camps in different places.selling stuff.which i always helped lower lvl players.but after that high wears off.the game is fkn boring as hell.
---
Maybe when they bring in the wastelander npc's and raiders,it hopefully will give us some interesting stories and quests.but for now its a snoozefest of wandering around doing nothing.
---
Nope. We're all fellow vault dwellers. We should be helping each other out. Not like the player that came to my camp and punched me until I agreed to PvP. When I did, he two shot me. He was 40 levels below me. This game makes no sense, PvP is useless, and it makes no sense lore-wise. Sorry, went on a tangent there. But no, I don't lock anything.
---
Can confirm you can add mods to the Small Backpack like Arktos Pharma paint and High Capacity, am wearing it currently
---
ewwww
---
You're right! It's more of a meme now. It's all a matter of consumers expectations vs reality. The fallout 76 we want and dream of is a very challenging game to make,let's be honest. The 76 we have is really not that bad, especially if you compare it to other MMO launches and pay models. It's the die hard fallout fans wanting the best of both worlds.....from a game that was in dev for 3 years...... Made by Bethesda....who in their right mind expected a smooth launch and bug free game?
---
I just did it today.. I was worried at first, but honestly Ive probably played way too much these past 2 weeks.. Sufficient supplu of stimpacks.. A power armor set (I grinded workshops to make my Ultracite set.. Server hop around and try to find enough armor spawns to make a set of t51 or t60).. The mirelurk kings in there are harder than the actual wendigo.. Its still a fun quest, enjoy and good luck!
---
And you are one of them.
---
If you're using an explosive weapon, sometimes they get hit by those and become hostile. That happens to me all the time at Whitesprings.
---
"Ranger Armor Set and Icon/Emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st membership is active, but once they have been claimed they will continue to be yours after the membership expires. "  
---
Taken straight from the webpage. So yeah, you'd get to keep it.
---
They buffed energy weapons and they dont break after 5 shots. They also removed explosive energy weapons from dropping so theyre in demand. Heavy gunner builds are a big thing now too.
---
Sorry, but thank u for the info, very cool
---
but my underground raves
---
You are absolutely awesome! Thank you so much for your help! I apologize for my drunken chatter!
---
ya im on PC, maybe that's why
---
You're quite alright man üòÇ and anytime. I'm around a lot, so lemme know if you'd ever like help on anything else!
---
thank imma go try it tonight
---
Find legendary armor pieces with carry weight perks and use your perks to improve your combat (except thru hiker, that one is essential). It will make your life soo much easier. You want at least one point on each of the three perks for the weapon type you use (though 9 points is recommended), you want three points in bloody mess for a basic damage boost, if you're in PA you want stabilized and some others. You should be able to one shot everything in the Burrows if you're over level 50, otherwise you'll be swarmed and will die repeatedly, even then you still will probably die a few times. Thankfully, it starts you at the beginning and you can run through it pretty quick once you get the hang of the layout.
---
This has been a bug since last year. Just don‚Äôt get out and you get extra carry weight
---
nah just use the body like a puppet
---
The success of a product depends on a lot of things.
---
For example Fortnite's battle royal came out when the battle royal was growing in popularity and was in a more functional state than the competition as well as had better, more targeted marketing for kids. The Switch was in a situation were people had to buy it because Nintendo games started going releasing on that platform. It also had good marketing targeting families and avoiding the violence in marketing you'd normally see for video games
---
Marketing plays a insane of control over a products success. Fallout 76's marketing was  confusing, the game is literally Fallout but online. However people even today think it's a mmo, rust clone, crafting game like Minecraft and event a full on massive battle royal (before NW came out), I remember one person telling me that they don't think 76 will do well because a map the size of a normal Fallout game with only 26 people wouldn't work well. However Fallout 76 is just a online action RPG and not a Rust clone, Minecraft clone or even a MMO.
---
Also what people do to support or damage a product can be as big as marketing. Again Fallout 76 had a large group of people wanting Bethesda to die before the game was officially announced, these influencers created the situation were 76 wouldn't do well regardless of if the game was good or not. Then look at a game like Call of Duty, yes there's hate, but there's more fans wanting the game to do well and those who don't aren't vocal nor do they tend to call for extreme action. There's hype around every DLC and release. So much in fact that fans will defend loot box's and micro transactions. Same for Fortnite, Battlefield and even GTA.
---
TLDR - Marketing and influencers.
---
As long as you have faster swing speed and can one-shot the enemies, melee works fine in the burrows. Like others have mentioned, stealth is crucial and then use vats and jump a lot when you're swarmed.
---
everyone survived and this is all just a fever dream
---
if only we could grab things like in fo4 i would have tried this lmao
---
also a pile of corpes in front of my camp with the sign keep out would be fun xd
---
Shit how didn't I think of that!? ***wAKe uP rIcK!!!***

yeah I miss dumping that first body over the bridge in 4 over and over. good times
---
gotcha, yea its been doing that shit a long time lol. yea, fir awhile i don't until i need to make or repair something.
---
Take your time, follow the main quest, don't go to the mire or bog until you're higher level. You'll hit a point around level 30 when your quests will start taking you into the hard areas and you'll die a lot. Use this time to level up your character in the easier areas. Don't bother trying to maximize your weapons and armor until you hit level 50 because you'll have to reroll it anyway.
---
we used to have a vent day.  Tuesday I think it was.
---
I‚Äôm probably not gonna pre order. Didn‚Äôt pre order FO4 but I got it at launch, while I pre ordered FO76 and am enjoying it. The only thing I‚Äôm not enjoying are the random bugs that fuck up my game and the fact that the game is currently worth a pack of atoms almost everywhere
---
I am only level 180 because back in the day we were all farming nuked whitespring.  Farm that for a week and I was lvl 160...
---
nyuknuyknyuk
---
but for real I think it's because we are the highest DPS at the moment.  hence bigger threat, pulling agro like a tank would in other games.  being cocky ain't so bad though carry on.
---
I just died at the SQB due to a total lockup because of this armor. I haven't seen this kind of screen sliding since the days when berry mentats and recon helms affected full parties.   
---
Of all the bugs we've experienced over the past year this is not one I have wanted to deal with again.
---
oh I'm bloodied.  might be that.
---
They have been in the files for months, no one knows what they do yet
---
I must be the most unlucky vault dweller out there. I have 3 chars with about 500 levels between them and I have never encountered a legendary scorched. I do have really bad luck though.
---
Lol. Highest dps? I guess maybe my TSE Gatling gun qualifies. :)
---
dude do your ears having a hard time with all the procks?  I can never hear anything on my left
---
The basic plans are common, but some of the ones like Calibrated Shocks is valuable.
---
Ghoulified one? Haven‚Äôt been to Alpha in a while. Got caught up with a fresh character üòï
---
This has been a request since almost day 1 lol.
---
Well, a shared stash account wide anyway.
---
I have weapons on one character I want to transfer across to a new character(s) when the time comes but as it is now there is significant risk involved.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs to discourage making the game too easy for new characters...but that shouldn‚Äôt matter tbh, there is no competition between players at early levels (or even later levels mostly).
---
For now I guess I just sit on my god roll bloody ultracite Gatling laser, bloody explosive shotgun (not god tier anymore but still good), etc.
---
That's odd, I renewed my monthly yesterday and my new atoms for this month were there this morning.  My 1st hadn't  lapsed.
---
yeah buddy
---
Upvote. Yes please
---
oh yeah very true.
---
Bloodied PA melee. I‚Äôve tested this thinking I was crazy and kept spinning her in a circle. 
---
I still think it has something to do with proxy then damage.
---
you sound like you'd fit 8n nice with us over at fo76filthycasuals
---
I've been selling the armor plans for 99 caps and the mods for 199, slow, but they do move.
---
For the 40,000th time, yes. Read the FAQ for fucks sake.
---
Except for that one damn corpse that you just couldn‚Äôt move
---
not me sry. hope it gets fixed for you.
---
I've seem them sell occasionally, but I sell them cheap. They don't sell fast enough for me to keep, so sometimes I just give them away.
---
you just brought up my first timesink.  I hated that damn thing

GOD DAMN THE THICCEST MF IVE EVER SEEN ON MOMS

WOW really fella, get angry much over stupid shit, how about next time u get angry over a post u just leave the post tough guy
---
I'm curious to your issues with the Nintendo Switch. Outside its issues with friend codes that Nintendo can't seem to let go of it's an amazing system and your honestly the first person I've seen that seems to have some big issues with it.
---
Not really, if it came from the dev room originally it is not legit.
---
so what I've been doing since I was like level thirty is spawing into the pleasant valley ski resort then I kill everything and pick up all their guns, grenades, and armour they drop. Once everything is cleared out I sell it to the raider vendour bot either in the station or in the actual ski resort. Rinse and repeat until the vendour runs out of caps. It usually takes me around 4-5 runs if I get super mutants a few times. I also have the perk card that gives me higher selling prices.
---
I farm water... Yep.. Scrap everything else.. About to start selling bulk scrap and legendarys in my personal vendor. Otherwise, 1,400 caps a day purely from water.. Dont have a water farm, get the perk to x2 harvest flora and then head over to Billings farm or whatever its called
---
Visit other people‚Äôs camps. Buy low, sell high.  That‚Äôs pretty much it. I make 10-50K caps per day doing it.
---
he's mad because he's a raider. BoS gang.
---
Careful: Murgle is a Flerkin....
---
So, are you level one or level six? 
---
You don't always get a perk card in the slot you leveled up. It's possible to level up a stat and back out and choose a different perk card of another stat. 
---
This must be the case because you don't get 6 perk cards at level one, and you can't use Concentrated Fire until level 2, and Slugger until level 6. It's not a game bug, it's user error.
---
I bought all the PA pieces at level 30 a week ago for 100 caps each.. Grinded past 50 during the double exp.. So.. I bought them and was grateful.
---
He is level six. That's how many special stats he has. Plus, you can't equip Slugger until level 6.
---
I'm a melee build so I sell all the ammo I pick up. I make a decent amount on shot gun, .44, and 5.56 especially. Also bulk adhesive and bulk acid
---
It's already in the game.
---
Lol so funny, i get it im sure its been asked but i have yet to see it even in my search, never bothered looking on bethesda, thought it would be easier just to ask, guess some people dont like that. Either way i get a kick out of keyboard tough guys..
---
Nice
---
Imagine the smell.
---
Those all sound amazing. I'm pretty sure my mix of photos is 55% mobs in weird or glitchy poses, 43% landscape, and 2% selfies xD I haven't actually taken too many of me posing with creatures (besides the wise mothman). I'd love if we were able to put photos in our camps somehow, even if it was just 5-10.
---
Incase it wasnt clear.. I meant the plans for the PA pieces.. Still have to grind ultracite scrap from junk extractors and scrap scavengers.
---
You're actually able to sell .44 rounds?! I've sold more flamer fuel than I've sold .44 haha
---
Lmaooo yeah, and sometimes it moves. It happens with ghouls and snalleygasters the most

If you‚Äôve been having fun, you‚Äôre doing it right!
---
I have three characters, main at 100 something and two in the 80s.   Here‚Äôs some tips:
---
Take unowned workshops.  If you don‚Äôt PVP, don‚Äôt stick around for the defend.  Go back later during the Retake, it‚Äôs not visible on the map.
---
Do Feed the People, every time it‚Äôs up.  It rewards 5 canned meat stew you can use for food, and gives 5% bonus XP while it‚Äôs active (an hour per, IIRC). 
---
Group up, especially if a friend has the perk card shared that gives bonus XP.   
---
Join enclave if you haven‚Äôt already.  Once you reach General, you can see the Enclave events.
---
Do every event you feel comfortable doing.  Stash your junk before the harder ones, so death doesn‚Äôt matter.  
---
As others have said, go where the super mutants are plentiful.  Lots of XP, caps, and weapons to scrap (and gunpowder!).
---
Good luck!
---
It was my perception that the laser grid changes color because you are alive when you approach, and since feral ghouls appear undead they may not trigger the detection mechanism.
---
Oh. Are you talking about the standard power armor frame?
---
If thats the case then yeah they are definitely based on the same frame. If thats not what youre talking about, then i guess we can agree to disagree.
---
I honestly can't keep them in stock lol I sell a lot of 10mm too.
---
I'm now on 4 SBQs with nothing to show for it in a row. The last 2 I know I did enough damage, but no loot for me!
---
They at least have scorched hordes. I am not 100% positive outside of that but i know they do in hordes.
---
20 plasma cores after I just got a three star plasma gatling cannon.
---
Looks fine to me! üòâ
---
Well, it's not a Wendistop. So.
---
I believe in "[Wastelad](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelad)", their version of Liberty Prime in the game was [Comrade Chrome](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Comrade_Chrome).
---
Well yeah, I use a vamp/ffr 10mm SMG so I'm always buying up people's stock of 10mm. I don't think I've ever encountered a pistol build in the wild though, let alone a revolver build. Nice though üëç

Taggardy's Thunder Thighs?
---
I found out recently that you don't even need to fast travel in some cases :D Just walk several yards away from the corpse and it might follow you. Happened to me when I got ambushed by 3 sierra bravos at my camp. Killed one of them (legendary) from far away and it fell down at a rather long distance from me. So I went to loot another one that was close to me and that legendary fell from the sky to my feet couple seconds after.
---
You look great! As far as I'm concerned that is the Enclave's, and by extension America's, ass.
---
I'm sorry but I don't seem to understand. This almost sounds like a pyramid scheme haha.
---
In your example, all the participants have to collect something, and then they have to turn in this something to the collectors. What do the collectors then do with these items? Do they keep them? Do they give them back? Do they hand it over to you?
---
And then you're saying that all of the collectors also have to contribute to the prize?
---
What's your role in this?
---
I'm on PC. 
---
I consider myself to be pretty good, so it takes someone who is either really good or cheating to kill me a lot of the time. Sometimes I'm undergeared or just unlucky, that will happen. But I can immediately tell the difference between a cheater and someone who is just good. 
---
Also, I've been in a discord channel for a while with a lot of the players who play NW on PC. Over the past couple weeks I've heard through the grapevine that a number of the people in the channel have started cheating, to the point where about 1/5th of the people in that discord channel are confirmed cheaters who play pretty much every day. The problem is getting out of control on PC.
---
I actually used pistols and revolvers on my OG character from beta hahaha but I always keep getting drawn back to melee
---
Well I collect the prizes the items they collect will later on be used as prizes
---
Thank you I realize I should say that in the OP
---
I would honestly love to set up a ham radio with mic in my guy's camp. Even if it would just have radio static constantly. Actually even better, make a radio channel and just have static. Stalk the listeners and increase the static whenever you get close like with Silent Hill.
---
The notches on my pistol say otherwise
---
*Very* lucky, as I discovered last night when I had cause to look for this plan.  I've fought the SBQ more times than I can count.  Hundreds.  And apparently, I've never had this plan drop.
---
Looks like spam from an account with 1 post
---
I played a pistol build when survival first came out, and started a new character. It was amazing up til about lvl. 30, then I just couldn't keep up with enemies. Ended up turning that toon into a heavy guns/PA build lol
---
Big Brain thoughts: Can't have a toxic community when most of the people in game are dead by radiation.
---
This nonsense COULD be happening because it's a weekend (Banks do funny shit on weekends). I bought my one month subscription on the 23rd of October, and it "Expired" yesterday, Saturday November 23rd, according to my account management page, despite having been set to auto-renew. On top of that bull, I can't purchase another month manually. The website just loops endlessly to the previous page when I select the "Purchase Again" button. 
---
Meanwhile, I am STILL able to use my private world, my fancy stash box, and place my survival tent. Even though Bethesda's own website says my membership is expired. Wtf!?!?
---
If this shit isn't fixed and my Atoms don't arrive tomorrow, then I can't purchase the things from the Atomic shop that I want which are going to Vault on Tuesday when the Atomic Shop updates. Not without buying Atoms directly with my card anyway, which I will NOT do. Part of the reason I even bought this damn subscription was so I wouldn't have to effing DO that.
---
I submitted a ticket, but honestly if this ends up being a huge pain in the ass every month, I'm going to cancel.
---
Uranium Fever, sell all weapons. A violent night, sell all chems. Campfire tales, sell acid on your vending machines. Use two types of ammo, sell the rest cheap.
---
I dealt with the same agent a few months ago. They need to update their call scripts, procedures, and upskill their staff. 
---
It's ridiculous that this is what is required to get atoms credited, but they seem to want to make it as hard as possible for customers to get credited atoms through customer support.
---
I'd take a screenshot of your receipt, blacking out everything identifying except your email address. Hopefully that makes a difference. If it doesn't, I recommend mentioning the consumer affairs department in your local area, and saying you will make a complaint if it isn't resolved. That seems to trigger your case being moved to the team with more ability to fix things as complaints credited the atoms to my PC and PS4 accounts apologising for the confusion
---
I roleplay as a Texas Ranger named Michael Atom from Houston that came up north because he heard of an unnuked area up north, as of right now he is still looking for other people, he keeps finding vault dwellers but that is about it.
---
Hello, somewhat related question. Are blueprints reliable to place down camps if I move then move back to the same spot? I have an extractor in the camp if it helps.
---
I want to build another camp but don't want to lose my current masterpiece if I don't like/finish the new one.
---
I agree. I think I only sold 44 ammo once. 308 is my best seller.
---
I'm trying to think of a rhyme for public relations fake
---
I've gotten quite a bit selling off Super Mutant weapons. Can get around 50\~ caps per Sharpshooter's Assault Rifle iirc.
---
Kinda gave up on that though as I'm constantly bumping up against the 30k. Now I just fill in the gaps selling chems I pick up during play. Does well enough I suppose, I'm rapidly running out of plans to buy at the Vendors.
---
Whichever route you take try and bump up your CHR special stat, will give you better buying/selling power at the NPC vendors. Low HP + Unyielding armor is probably the most powerful method. Casual under armour with the higher tier linings will give a decent boost. Chems work as well.
---
Thanks. Tried there and same, can't craft
---
If you're on ps4 I can put them on for you. PSN is dtb7591. Just need the fluxes
---
Yeah, pretty frustrating.  I logged in just to kick around a bit while watching a ballgame (that is pretty uneventful) and happened into a world where Whitesprings had been nuked and only about a half dozen players in the nuke zone.  I figured I could get some of the materials to stabilize flux and just heading to the golf club and ‚ÄúServer not responding‚Äù popped up and I got booted.  If they put half the energy into stabilizing the game, especially during events, as they do trying to add stuff to sell.......well, enough said.
---
Actually if you have a friend who can open it and your in a suit of power armor have you friend open the elevator door and back up to the entrance with the power armor on. Exit the power armor once against the grid and the animation will phase you through. Common trick with fallout games.

It is endgame viable if you focus on luck, crits, headshots and a good legendary 44 plus a good silenced legendary 10mm. Really kills everything except bosses. 
---
My gunslinger uses a limb damage instigating western revolver to cripple all limbs. Whatever the enemy, once it's crippled, the rest is just dirty work.
---
Hate that guy. I had to put a suit of pa down in every room so he wouldn't be able to get in or shoot me through some angles.

I had the same thing happen last night while transferring 10k of Ultracite .308 ammo. After hundreds of successful transfers, it seemed very odd to me that this ammo wasn't showing up in the container when I immdediately came back for it. I knew that I was on the same server because the dead molerat that I had killed with my previous alt was still laying nearby. So on a hunch I added a piece of spoiled meat to the empty container and instantly my 10k .308 reappeared. For some strange reason, the container needed to be interacted with in order for my ammo to reappear. Try something like that if ever the container that you transferred to appears to be empty.

Take some grenades with you and throw them at the column near the waterfall. He'll pop up.
---
Without player vending this game would be dead.
---
Diminishing returns: it applies only to the 50 you didn't cover with the perk/prefix. 
---
However, once your build is finished and you are level 50, you are stronger by focusing on your damage output. 
---
If you cripple or oneshoot things, they can't hurt you.
---
GOSH DANG IT, i was thinking this earlier and could've gotten karma from ir lol
---
What's odd is I have the yearly subscription, according to the FAQ the Atoms aka points should be added every month on the day you paid.
---
In Elder Scrolls Online Bethesda has the ability for players to send mail to each other. I think it is a 90 day time limit to get them out of your mail before the attached items are lost. You can even send each other gold.
---
Bitch it‚Äôs Christmas
---
Have them put in a ticket with your proof of purchase. Guy I run with did that and got his Atoms for his monthly subscription.
---
Did that, he didn't spawn. I ended up dying to a mirelurk King, and somehow he spawned after
---
The SNF game is more horrifying than the fo76 instability. I'm a Packers fan
---
I'm kind of confused did you make copy of the game or what I don't understand
---
In theory they should be stored on your local hard drive and you should be able to transfer them using a USB stick.  At least, this is how it works on the PS4.
---
No idea in your case. I know of other people that are not going to renew. If it's not worked out quickly for me, I won't renew until I know the service works as expected.
---
I‚Äôve modified my ini and still launch through the Bethesda launcher.
---
Dont dupe maybe?
---
My gut feeling is that this support is being farmed out to some call center that can be anywhere. They need to consider a new approach to the ticketing system IMHO.
---
U still cheated, so how about take this as a lesson to never cheat again, and just accept the fact that your actions have consequences
---
I like your style
---
To be honest this is one of the reasons why I dropped the game. It's baffling that a game like this has 0 ways to text chat with friends or nearby people, yet much faster paced games like Warframe have it standard with multiple tabs. This is literally earliest MUD tier stuff.
---
I agree  #FixThePenitentiary
---
I know, right.  Who would have ever though SF would be running neck and neck with the Pat‚Äôs.  It‚Äôs only half time though.  Aaron Rodgers pulls off some of the most amazing things though, I think he doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough credit for some reason.  Keep up the positive mojo, they can still do it.
---
Another friend of mine submitted a ticket and they told her she'd have her atomic points by the 26th...
---
... just because you admit to shoplifting doesn't mean you're allowed back in the store, even if you've purchased there before?
---
Just because you admitted to cheating this game, why would they unban you?
---
No they are not reliable. They are limited in size and placing them can be a night mare.
---
He duplicated ingame items
---
Oh ok that's better than making copys of the game
---
When the canvas bag "materials are too expensive" thing happened BGS said it was an outsourced company who wrote that response. So it would not surprise me either. Potentially they've kept their escalation calls in-house
---
My dude that's literally the worst thing you could do. It's not "whining about being too slow", it's "I didn't even see it before it died"
---
That reminds me, I need to get rid of empath. Its making me die by a fart in the wind as a bloodied stealth build. That 25% extra damage hurts.
---
In Skyrim, someone keeps coming into abandoned tombs and replacing and lighting the candles.
---
In Little Lamplight you have to go through LL because the radiation is too strong - but as soon as you get through your enemies have already been there.

And what's the deal with airline food?

This is from GILMAN LUMBER MILL ICON
---
West of icon near half buried rusted jeep.
---
North of icon a lake with a bloodleaf, snaptail, and firecap.
---
East and a little south of icon another lake witha pier and beehives.
---
Finally South East of icon the farm fields between it and Wixon Homestead.
---
All four spots spawn one type randomly: Foxes, Squirrels, Cats, Opossums, Radstags, Chickens, and Frogs.
---
Edit: Use VATS because they can sometimes be hard to see especially the west one.
---
I can't possibly imagine why you'd still be banned got breaking the rules. It's a real head scratcher tbh, I'll go meditate on it and get back to you
---
This is literally the definition of a toxic community and not something you should be proud of.
---
I‚Äôm aware and I couldn‚Äôt care less. When I was a lower level I was all about being fair and taking the game in. Now I‚Äôm almost 220 with nothing to do and I used to exclusively live in survival. So now I have my fun by being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù at events, running around with a bounty and baiting people, and contesting workshops. It‚Äôs fun, and people like you make it even more entertaining because you cry to Reddit for upvotes
---
Watoga Civic Center.
---
You earned this. You cheated. Learn from it, and stop looking for pity from people who play fair.
---
0, you can take out a max of 1400 caps per day.  Even if you sell things to them, they won't let you get more than that.
---
Ultracite is for the Ultracite power armor set.
---
Thanks but I just tested it, refer to Edit 2
---
Who's mad dog. I thought Graham was the only super mutant trader.
---
Also can I have some more lore how some super mutants are intelligent and show empathy while other ones seem to be as intelligent as feral ghouls. Does the amount of FEV come into play there? And behemoths are super mutants that have been alive for a very long time right? Then how is there a super mutant behemoth in fallout 76 if not all the super mutants in fallout 4 became behemoths. Game takes place 200 some years after the wars correct? And 76 takes place 25 years after the wars. So 25 years is enough for a super mutant to become a behemoth, but I highly doubt that it only takes 25 years so it must also depend on how much FEV it was exposed to right? I do understand that FEV is a pre war thing to create more powerful humans, but didn't this project take place only a few years before the fallout? Also weren't the female humans turned super mutant typically more aggressive then the male humans turned super mutan and females were more likely to survive? I felt like I read that somewhere.
---
Create a new beth account and buy the game again. Sorry not sorry
---
Mine just renewed for the second month, got no atoms
---
50AE is almost plausible in the pistol or SMG, but the Survivalist makes more sense as the IRL Beowulf conversion. I don't think there's much potential for consistency between all three though.
---
NV had the most realistic firearms of the series, but it did so while still trying to work within the original lore, which had been horribly unrealistic (like the 14mm and 10mm pistols, and the Bozar).
---
I just wish we could get realistic damage from the .50 rifle receivers and machine gun today. I prefer realism to "balance" there.
---
None! No mods, nor INI tweaks whatsoever. I'm trying the non-translucent PipBoy now. But I remember now why I didn't like it--I'm using a chameleon armor piece, and it's harder to read while cloaked.
---
I don't think this is a glitch, I think you're just not understanding the way leveling up works. 
---
When you start, each SPECIAL is 1, and when you level up you can raise a SPECIAL with the game defaulting to Strength since it's first in the list. You then pick a perk, which can be under any SPECIAL tree. 
---
Looks like you've kept the points in Strength, but picked perks in different SPECIALs.
---
It was in the whitesprings armory...
---
Instigating levers are mighty powerful. Mix in sneak and some rifle perks and you can one shot nearly everything
---
Since I left the shelter it was clear to me that I would be a Vaultec fan, my clothes and my CAMP is fully equipped with all the comforts of a Vault, from Vaultec purifier, to lights, sofa, bed, etc., Vaultec will always be there for anyone  I seek refuge.  Many players have visited my CAMP and have used the photo mode, apart from personal messages congratulating my CAMP.
---
Not enough interest in people buying them.
---
I thought it was someones little small cwmp build
---
Can‚Äôt wait
---
I have a Berserkers Automatic which isn't bad but main problem is small magazine.  Is there a magazine mod for more than 15 rounds?
---
No reason to say "sorry" chum. I had to check it myself to be sure, so we're both that much further ahead.
---
Cheers!
---
Ceilings do look kind of dumpy, I agree, new ones would be appreciated. I'm hoping they re-release some of the floors I missed out on, the carpets and mosaic tiles. 
---
Wall "patterns" other than wallpapers would be welcome too, maybe painted walls, clean and vintage, do a couple colors. Brick interior or cinder block would be nice as well, so would themed colored sets- Nuka Cola (red white), Slocum Joe's (brown pink), Arktos Pharma (grey green?), Vault Tec (blue yellow)
---
good woork, and a nice write up,  some more levels and you will be eating  Scorchbeast steak and lung's every day :)
---
Probably they are keeping Tier 3 in house. Hopefully, we can get some answers and get better support moving forward. BGS needs to fix the issues before Wasterlanders.
---
Vampires .50 cal ffr chews through them.
---
One of my friends and I ran it on my private server and ended up walking away with 14 legendaries.
---
It's part of the top of the world questline
---
I've wondered this myself, what ever stopped them from releasing it? In the last datamine it showed a picture of a colored set of marine armor, and it had the helmet included that was colored, but lots of stuff had been data mined that wasnt implemented so take it with a grain of salt.
---
I gave up on the Mysterious Stranger perk in FO 76 because he only fires one shot and his .44 doesn't do much damage against enemies above Lvl 25.  It was always one of my favorite perks in other FO games.
---
That's good news. Later than I wanted especially for some of the sales in AS lol
---
Nice dude!
---
Yes, that's the Guy I was running with, had the issue. He had to put in a ticket, with proof of purchase and got his Atoms sooner than I expected.
---
I've done that slow walk a few times, clutching close my hoarded precious...tin cans. Filthy wastlander-ses.
---
Now eat it with a sweetroll and get the diabetes mutation. 
---
+5 percent damage to melee but receive more limb damage.
---
We have a society!
---
Not sure on the why you didn't get your atoms, but reading the tone of your responses, you went insta a-hole on a guy probably making crap wages doing a crap call center job.  How well do you think Jarod is going to go out of his way to help you get a resolution quickly?
---
Nice attention to detail. Its little things like that that make the map good.
---
hell yea! lol
---
If you go on top of westek there is a fixed spawn on a plate. No machine, nil luck involved.
---
damn that sucks lol. thought those were rareüòì
---
I'm probably not going to be back at my PC until 7PM ET tomorrow. Do you know when the freebie ends/ how many hours are shown left in the Atomic Store? I know they used to end at 8PM ET, but in the update (https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/01kmDuEu7AM5whFYG65K3p/atomic-shop-update-15-items-and-sales-november-19) it mentioned the sales lasting until 12PM ET.
---
Just use private servers I transfer stuff to all my toonz by putting items into the lunchbox by overseers and relog on another character and taking it
---
Steam makes many stats public, it would be nothing but bad pr to see this game with like 250 concurrent players.
---
He is setup to be a vendor. He even has a vendor chest with things to sell in it. Nothing great, just the typical food and chems. However, he has never been "activated" despite his dialog suggesting you can trade with him.
---
That can only work if the weapon is afflicted with an effect that the effect is, return to player (assigned number to player) after so much time no matter who's inventory it's in and it cannot be scrapped and clearly marked as rented property(meaning even if you do some sort of trick to sell it, it'll always return home). Throw it under a hidden quest for both the rentor and rentee. If in the event the rentee char is deleted, it will stay in the inventory of the rentor for the time allotted and automatically placed in another character in the rentees account. If the rentee deleted all characters or is banned, the item is consficated from the game world after the allotted time. If the character of the rentor is banned or deleted, the item will automatically be placed back in the rentees acct. 
---
And that's a lot of work and for what?
---
Great thanks!
---
Too bad that isn't bethesda austin, you know, the devs that have never made an online game before and got this game dumped on them at the 11th hour
---
I never used the stuff, just offloaded it to another character. I came back a month later and I was banned, I just wanna play the game again.
---
for fun! im willing to put it in the hands of bethezra
---
Recently an atom shop paint was added for Marine armor (datamined, not released yet). In the preview image, it shows the Marine helmet painted. This might indicate that they will be added in the game soon, but I bet it will be overlooked like it has up to this point. The wood helmet is also shown in a picture of a paint, and that is also Dev room only. 
---
I think one issue is that they might not be aware that it is not in game normally. In fact, I have seen a few post of people who asked community support if it was an illegal item, and CS responded that it is obtainable in game, which it is not.
---
Never used any of it, I just want to play the game again.
---
There is a range limit. Were you far from your camp?
---
Not at all. That's why I'm so confused it's not saying out of range or reloading or anything it's just always  "not available "
---
Yeah I have this issue a lot.
---
Perfectly preserved pie - on top of the westek building
---
Black cowboy hat
---
Salior hat
---
Firemen hat red
---
Dang you know I saw a huge list of stuff in someones vendor and I forgot the lot of what they had but it was crazy over priced.  I always look things up before I would buy in case i can find it in game.
---

---
Rich Boy would like to know your location.
---
üëç
---
Have you tried not breaking the ToS?
---
At this point I expect it 6-8 months after it gets announced at a minimum. Since Fallout 1st was very ESO-esque, hopefully this feature also makes it in.
---
Its more like if you went to ger out you car and had a stroke as you stepoed out
---
Yeah it was the only content after maxing out my vendor caps and stash each day; luckily now the only thing I have to worry about is expensive food rotting in a fridge before I can sell it.
---
Interesting points. No I expect the fact, I let other BGS sources know of my and other players not getting Atoms more exposure to get the issue resolved moving forward. No doubt the ticket will have to be escalated to get my Atoms back if at all. 
---
If I was being what you said I would have done a far more clear and direct job of it.
---
Lots of people think they are rare. The drops from the machine are tied to your luck stat. Have a high luck build and boost it with food/chems/gear and they drop pretty easy. Was the same in other fallout games too. 
---
Still fun that one dropped for you!
---
It's not fun. I have a few types of weapons where I switch between a Bloodied and Vampire variant depending on the situation. I never equip the correct one from my wheel and almost always get myself killed lol
---
Some, but not all.  
---
Liberty Prime will change everything, for example, as will the Pale Rider or any of the Four Horseman series.  
---
But the Prototype Ultracite or Northern Lights T-51? Those'll only work on their correspondent suits.  
---
It usually specify in the description on the Shop whether it'll only work with a specific suit, suits, or any suit at all.
---
I sell the black cowboy hat for 5 caps.  It may still be overpriced, but it saves a walk the the corner.
---
Thanks for the clarification!
---
There is 100% spawn atop wes tek.
---
Wrapped Cap, Wool Fisherman‚Äôs Hat
---
You're quite welcome.
---
Oh im saying someone had it in theirs for 250 caps.  Lol. 5 is fine.
---
ahh gotcha. yea my luck is 4 so you can guess how happy i was!
---
Clean space helmet  200-2500  
---
Red Dress  see this for 1k a lot   
---
Engineer outfit varies but normally way overpriced  
---
BoS lab coat 1k  often but have seen it down in the 20s  
---
Combat helms seen them for 500 each (I am guilty of selling them for 100 caps myself but I learned it)
---
Assuming they're same as the Brahmin in my camp, if you can get them into sufficiently deep water they'll just drown.
---
You monster! üò±
---
How did you learn the combat helmet plans?
---
Are you on ps4?my Psn is moneytrees-_-og
---
If so you Are gonna regret this lmao.
---
My account was "suspended" and still is however it was not do to the items but I literally broke my account and they have never restored it. I built a 92 foundation 6 story maze filled with 10s of thousands of lights statutes turrets and the likes, I took advantage of the blueprint dupe that gave you extra build limit in your camp.
---
So yeah it was a dupe and yeah I deserved it but nothing stops you from creating a second account on Xbox and an extra Beth account. Not sure about PS4 or PC but it should be the same if you have a physical copy.
---
LOL I didnt check the level first, only level 16. Wont last long when I move my base
---
Idk about clothing items, but I wouldn't let my troubleshooters pipe pistol w/ bash damage go for less than 30k.
---
You get a free set from completing the brotherhood questline and if you're xbox, I can provide modding services for said armor.
---
Scrap it, scrap it scrap it some more on one character it took 1 time on others it took more than 10. Thus I sell them for 100 so it is worth my time.
---
The fact that you don't think someone is capable of tanking a tesla already tells me you are gonna get farmed.and sneak does matter In any fight that doesn't involve teslas.
---
A group of us on PS4 have a pretty big Role play story line going in involving a Responder based faction and a Raider based faction, both of which stay pretty close to what those factions are meant to be.  We're always looking for like minded people to get involved! If you'd like to you can view some of the previous RP events, Faction lore and character backgrounds on the "The Vultures - Fallout 76 Raider Gang"  Facebook page.
---
No water at this camp not to mention, You cannot control them at all. Cant say, call them to you into deep water‚òπÔ∏è
---
Hey I love the 120 caps I‚Äôm pulling in each time.  Don‚Äôt mess up this racket!
---
Been awhile
---
You'll have a hard time staying alive in a silo at that level, but add me if you like, I've got a couple of keycards already and can try my best to help. GT is same as my username.
---
Cant believe the responses here. The pie is a notoriously difficult to get for most of us. I've been hitting that machine for like 5 years and have only ever gotten one. It made my heart jump when I saw it grab hold. 
---
Grats dude
---
For the second part, only mutants there who are immune to rads sooo...yeah
---
Rad emitter might do it. 
---
Could make a friend (or just any random visitor really) hostile and have them kill it too.
---
The camo underarmor is called "Brotherhood Fatigues". It's a static spawn, along with a scribe hat, in a tent at Mt Thunder power plant.
---
thank you very much. same here! In my head I was WHHAAAAAAYTTYTT! üòÇüòÇ Pretty darn cool to finally get a pie. Was never good at those claw games as a kid üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
A max of 1400. Caps are added back to bot vendors at 1/4 the purchase price, up to the 1400 cap limit the vendors have collectively. 
---
If you buy that item with them at 0 it will bump them back to their max pool of 1400. If they're already there, you don't get squat.
---
The limit resets daily, but you're free to bump them back to max as much as you want. There's no way to game the system by continually trading as each time you buy something, 3/4 of the caps are removing from the economy permanently.
---
LOL did you mean Zehuatanejo?
---
I never noticed them riding the elevator til a few months ago. One of the few truly scary things in the game besides mirelurk kings late at night, flatwoods monsters, and freezes with an audio bug.
---
There's the answer I was after, thank you.
---
AWESOME thank you!
---
I stack stairs a lot, you need to build another set of stairs leading down to a new foundation to "ground" the first set of stairs.
---
If you're on PC you can add me and I'll be happy to try and sort it out ingame!
---
He must have been Bloodied himself if you killed him, because of that fucking STUPID damage filter Bethesda put in to "stop" one-shot kills. All it did was make implausible things like getting hit in the face with 5k damage + a crit from a nuclear artillery shell not do more than a third of a health bar's damage, make hard-hitting but slow weapons useless for PvP, and force everyone to run automatics or explosive shotguns to be competitive (Which still kill you so fast it is pretty much the same as a one-shot, so the change didn't do jack but ruin weapon usage diversity.).
---
I had herd many things.. only at night, just pick them till it happens etc.. 
---
I can however confirm my method worked for me, just hopefully I can help some other people! :)
---
If i buy a recal keycard when the vendor is a 0 it doesnt fill it it. Those are 2k
---
System defences are only programmed to recognize heat signatures
---
Gee I've never run into these kind of assholes in almost 1000hours. Worse I deal with is people not waving back. I have been killed once by a player who snuck up on me in a workshop. Lost some wood lol
---
Edit: thanks for the heads up as well.
---
My mate had the same problem where I could use mine.
---
He had his state id in his pocket
---
A trap is fine. They only work once per person, someone has to be dumb enough to fall for it, and it takes a lot of time, resources, etc...to make a trap. Being able to just gank someone in their own house who didn't go somewhere risky or fall for a trap is a different thing entirely. It's not intended by the devs. Traps ARE intended. They gave us traps to build and use. This method is an exploit, not something working as intended.
---
Love the idea of using the pip boy for lfg function and chatting.
---
Nothing because Caps really have a unlimited earning potential it's only capped now because Bethesda hasn't increased the amount
---
Basically it would turn into inflation but then bartering would become the primary trade mechanic as it already is
---
To be introduced in the new 200$ yearly subscription.
---
That could be great explanation for that. Grids could be set only to humans because they didn't expect any creature before the war
---
Nice one
---
Ima say 5k and 10 for outfit.
---
Sry mate XD
---
Busy tomorrow but after that I'd be willing to help for free some time. Honestly though it may be harder than your are thinking to get us in the same match on opposing teams even if we hit join at the same time there are multiple matches going at the same time . Reply to me on discord at xiovi#1540
---
Jarrod is an absolute idiot. Every time I've contacted Bethesda for support I get this idiot. To call that guy a pain in the a$$ is a massive understatement. If I had a customer support rep working for me like that I wouldn't blink once firing them. He gives the same canned response no matter what the issue is &amp; I've had to literally raise hell with him to get things escallacted to where if I'm lucky someone will address them &amp; fix it. You ALWAYS have to supply a book full of proof of purchase BS to get anything resolved at all. Worst of it is Bethesda knows this shit doesn't work properly &amp; they still make you jump though hoops. I'll be canceling when my year is up (Xbox). Their games just aren't worth the trouble.
---
No way to recover I dont think. They are tied in with the "reserved space" which is 2gb
---
Happy, merry, joyous *fasnaught* everybody.
---
1). You don't lose caps and can't seek revenge. You do still drop your loot bag though. 
---
2). It's not new. Been around for months. The lingering AoE rad damage affects everyone in the AoE, including whoever threw it.
---
3). Suggesting people be banned for it, when ACTUAL cheaters aren't being banned is ridiculous.
---
Ouch. Sorry that happened :(
---
Nope it‚Äôs common
---
Exactly same problem here.  180 odd days and still not working.
---
No.
---
These people are no less cheaters than those who used the artillery box or any of the other 'no external tools required' methods to dupe.
---
They are exploiting a game mechanic that is not working as intended for their own gain.
---
I don't really understand why you draw that line; I guess if I enjoyed PvP I might be able to see the line you see however as the very few PvP encounters I have had were imposed on me - and no, I am not talking about 'I took a workshop and bad man killed me' - therefore I really don't see such line.
---
Wow. Really outing yourself there. The arty box dupe has been patched for nearly a year.
---
You sure you want to trust a random with that?
---
Not anymore, one of my friends are helping me right now.
---
I switched instigating to 2 shot, overall it does more damage but I am less likely to one shot enemies. I could almost reach 1 k damage with instigating, but 2 shot is like stuck at 700 max.
---
Guess that really takes the cake
---
I built a Church of Atom and was a preacher for a while, bathing followers in Atoms glory.
---
I was a Responder doctor for a while, in blue scrubs and a surgical mask and set up a field hospital in tents and gave away stimpacks and radaway. 
---
I set up a soup kitchen for a bit near Vault 76 and gave away food in a vendor for free. 
---
My favorite setup was the Carn-evil death maze, I sat out front in amusement worker clothes, charged 100 caps to play, to run a multi-room death maze with door lock puzzles, spike strips, rad emm, flamethrower, tesla, false floors, and if you made it to the end there was a 3* in a vending machine for free.
---
I have all deep pocketed marine armor, about 350++. but I literally found only 2 pieces that are slightly better. let alone any good legendary armor. that's why I got in Xo-o1 :( I rarely find any legendaries and they are pure crap.
---
what's AA?
---
also, I only carry like 5-10 on me xD not all 90
---
I mean i kinda just see nocturnals as side guns, its not really something to base a build around even though their are a couple lf perks for it.
---
loooooooovvvveee it!!!
---
I can‚Äôt feel my face after I‚Äôm with you, but I like it.
---
If your on PS4 I'll put a heavy barrel on it for you free of charge. My PSN is HillbillyDLUX08, I'll be on in about 8 hours.
---
Profligates like you belong on a cross
---
Sorry, PC...
---
Everyone speaks like a mr handy
---
Do you know how many ragequits you just prevented?
---
At least a couple.
---
meds, ammo, fusion cores 
---
i got shotgun shells for you, got over 1K and i dont really use them
---
power armour is gonna be needed due to radiation and shitload of robots
---
&gt; only a cool 2000 atoms from the atomic shop.
---
Well, that would give me something to buy with the 11,380 atoms I've got for free,
---
Why do people think 2,000 atoms is a lot?  There are a minimum of 9,210 atoms available for free *before* you do the daily/weekly challenges.
---
That would be both good and bad.  Sometimes I want a new server.  I‚Äôve noticed that legendaries fail to populate on private worlds on rare occasion.  I wouldn‚Äôt want to be stuck with it all day.
---
You could be promoted when logging in if you wanna stay in your old lobby or start a new one. Kinda like how having 2 camps in the same spot works.
---
Or 90 with hi cap mod.
---
&gt; The fast travel to vendors means a level 5 player can travel to Watoga safely,
---
I always go to Watoga via Big Bend tunnel for my first visit.
---
Get marsupial and grenade. Join Uranium fever and A Violent Night. Tag stuff and let others kill.
---
crap it all to hell.  
---
well fuck... good to know.
---
I really liked it too but it's a total chaos there, it's so cramped up, narrow loopy ways, weirdly shaped, and a no clear path to sweep thru, and TON of tanky ghouls. A really bad place for gun fight.. I downloaded a map someone made so I'll go and try it again.
---
But then I'd be giving up Moo-lissa Mc-Cow-rthy, and that's a tough choice to make
---
If it's the dog body you're talking about, you can hack it to pieces and then you can pick the pieces up, or put a mine under it and shoot it. It has always annoyed me to the point that getting rid of it has become a ritual
---
Somebody tell me how and who keeps making impostor sheepsquatches and letting those escape? I believe this is the hardest public event, like people keep on dying if people refuse to work altogether.
---
Level 3 Class Freak reduces that to +6% damage.
---
Just turn your back and pop out of your power armor. Get in once, you're a member for lyfe.
---
Great idea. They'll add it as the big incentive for next month's F1st subscription
---
No friend required. At least when I did it.
---
PS4 has the 50 limit.  The joke is that when you delete old photos it doesn't delete them from the PS4 photo album.  I now have about 15G of photos filling my disk that I don't get to see in game.
---
It's been duped lately very heavily, same as BE15r GPlasma and other stuff.
---
Duping never stopped
---
Ghouls and Wendigos: 
---
&gt; That terminal won't stop me because I can't  &gt; read!
---
Yes the BE15 Gatling Plasma is everywhere too.
---
The mods for power armor have this pattern:  
---
Model | Mod  
---
If the model is missing, it's for the Excavator PA, if the model is present, then it is for the model written on the plan. It doesn't matter wehere you obtain them.
---
Shielding you from rads.  It's a much better version of Rad-X.
---
I was wondering where the hell those ghouls come up 4th floor. Typical Bethesda game...
---
I do miss the Fatman bowling ball launcher. It would also give people reasons to use a Fatman again, slap the Queen with those balls.
---
Bethesda dont want people to use mules
---
Really? It's still possible? This explains some really good trades I made lately.
---
Server hop and farm Whitespring golf club, that‚Äôs where i leveled up my mules, about 10 levels per day (after work til bedtime). Good ol ghouls don‚Äôt drop much legendary now but the xp is still good.
---
I feel stupid for not having ever tried this.
---
I might convince myself to reinstall just to see if it works...
---
Yes a youtuber said it‚Äôs still being done but diapers won‚Äôt tell him how.
---
Fireman Helmet for 5k all day. Available at Whitesprings for like under 30 caps with hard bargain.
---
Are you talking about pc, consol, Or both?
---
nice catch. how do you know which tower had mother raising children tho?
---
That's the only reason one of my characters is a 200, cause for the first 100 levels I had zero idea what I was doing, and I needed a respec bad. High levels don't always mean god tier murder machine.
---
doesn‚Äôt it have 10dr?
---
That was my 1st thought as well :D
---
I don‚Äôt recall what the YouTube vid said, is there a method difference between platforms?
---
yes. you need one of those butt pieces I guess. for protection.
---
scorch beasts attract waves of scorched that give like 125 each and easily go down with a single bullet to the head, i get a couple levels per hour that way
---
Ive never duped on fallout so idk. I know on ps4 you can dupe by reloading old hard saves if you have cloud sync turned off. But thats only on some games.
---
 how about next time u use search option - it's been answered hundred times already...
---
A family is more important my good man
---
You got your priorities right
---
I would actually ask for craft able ham radio. you can press talk button and anyone who's tuned in would hear you. you can play music from your PC if you set your mic
---
or Easter egg hunt with distress signals.
---
It's smaller backpack you can apply mods (confirmed) but it has smaller capacity. Good for beginning, before you'll do Pioneer scouts quests and get full version.
---
1 kill ghouls, 2 loot chems, 3 sell chems.
---
1 kill mole miners, 2 loot glowing meat, 3 cook glowing meat, 4 sell glowing meat steaks.
---
That, plus loads of duping and also legit trading of the armors.
---
as long as you enjoy it mate. you might like taking things slow, which I tend to do time to time. sometimes I  just hang out at my base, farm, cook, run short supply runs, cook again, edit some structure. I feel like I recover from the main struggle by doing so. and I get to manage my inventory, decide what to bulk, sell, craft. plan perk cards, plan next Target so I fast travel less etc.
---
It's Watoga Civic Center.
---
There is a note written by mother and a nearby grave with letter-blocks on top that says MY ANGEL.
---
also, I craft gun powder 5xp, and diluted stimpaks, radaways and radx. i thinn it's 12 xp each time.
---
This, 
---
Basic plans are 
---
1. Common as mentioned as drops from the SBQ
---
2. Available for Free after completing the BoS Quest line.
---
The mod plans? They can be rare, depending. Internal Database? Not Rare, Jet Pack? Not that Rare. Calibrated Shocks? Rare, Emergency Protocols? V Rare
---
120
---
I go from sub 300 to 350 when I swap between basic and High Cap
---
Yeah man no problem at all üôÇüëçüèª
---
Np! I do it every so often when I get a new weapon and want to test it just make sure all my stuff adds up properly.
---
High level vault raids, and the nuclear winter battle Royale
---
because elevetor system and quest stage design have been change completely to suitable with multiplayer game unlike fo4.
---
so basically it technical difficulty.
---
I make my daily limit by selling purified water. For my vendor Fixers, ammo, and Radshield are my biggest sellers. People seem to love Radshield and I got a bunch of it lol.
---
These posts seem less a 'what had been added to the game' and more a 'is it worth playing what has been added,
---
&gt;I let that one protectron live as a thanks for helping me.
---
Every day is a gift from now on, son.
---
So you can get it.
---
talking about pc.
---
I went to white spring by the road the first time and countered the scorchbeast that always spawns there. And promptly died. So I concluded that white spring was a higher level area. When I made it in, it felt good.
---
Who's the immortal bloatfly?
---
I'm not sure, if it's 100% guaranteed to get on the same instance. I wouldn't do that, except is some people are in there an I'm sure it stays online.
---
Sniff it and get *really* high.
---
It works I've done with with my junkies handmade sentinel assassin pieces all kinds of rare shit lol
---
The apocalypse has been good to you.
---
There‚Äôs a list of games that can use xcloud go to the official website
---
While I don't condone such behaviour (I like my PvP fair), it *is* an irradiated, post-apocalyptic wasteland, almost as promised... If anything, encounters like this spice it up a bit. Dying to a mischievous griefer certainly beats doing queen for the n-th time, remembrance-wise.
---
I shake my money maker
---
I still think mines exploding on non-hostile targets is an oversight, but if that's what you're into...lol
---
I got 3 primed weapons on the favorite bar, 2 of them are identical, except the third effect, but never get removed from the quickbar.
---
Nice idea! Thanks for a suggestion, gonna try it asap -))
---
Bethesda was an amazing company who gave us a really enjoyable games so what happens..!?why did they change
---
I think the patch 15 notes stated it had been fixed
---
You could be "bikers" and wear the greaser gear. Ive always wanted to follow the freeway from grafton all the way around to Watoga. Just stick to the highway and see what pops up also to follow the railroad but i never get around to it.
---
That's been my experience as well. But I haven't play in a month or 2. Seeing all these post, I really hope the community isn't changing, 76 hase one of the nicest in game community of any game I've played.
---
Just be careful mang, I almost never freeze, but I did earlier today. That restart and launcher issue I had afterward put me in a new instance. I've also just been disconnected and could not log back on until I did a scan and repair... No idea what happened there. But it's a good idea to use a friend also for redundancy until they get us some viable item transfer options...
---
No, it wasn't fixed but will be in the near future (probably in the next patch).
---
ahh okay, it was the coming bug fixes then. I knew I read about it somewhere.
---
Yes, many people, including me, moaned that they didn't fixed that so we get information in the latest Inside the Vault that couple of most irritating bugs will be fix soon.
---
Sometimes in the Asylum (or anywhere really) there are glitched bugs that won't die. And they just keep following you around and regaining health no matter how many bullets you put in their bug brain. I had a vampiric bloodbug follow me into the elevator and ride to the top floor with me. Let me tell you, immortal bloodbugs don't make for the best company.
---
Don't forget about black powder, I know it's slow, but it hits like a freight train. I have a bloodied explosive black powder that the first shot from sneak will hit 5.5k damage.
---
Take my angry upvote
---
I has this problem as well when i primed my handmade. I have 2 melee and 2 guns on my wheel and all of them have a skin beside the powerfist. When i primed the handmade it was impossible to fast switch to it. It fixed itself in some days,but i think i tried some method like removing skin,putting it in the stash,restarting the game.
---
If its trash dont play it, move on to something else? 
---
Personally I enjoy it. I play because I love the FO franchise and dont mind dealing with the bugs. I can finally experience FO with friends who all are huge fans of the series. I cant think of another game where you can do all of the things you can in this. Wonder, loot, cook, craft, build, solve, pvp, BR, etc and all with friends. 
---
Honestly, it's sad to see so many bashing posts in a community that's supposed to be *for* a game. If it's that terrible why are you still here a year later? I'm not trying to say you dont get an opinion because that is your right but it would be nice to see more positivity and acknowledgment on what this game has overcome and what it does right, along with what it does that very few if any games do. 
---
I sincerely hope the magic formula is reached for you and you get the game you thought it was or desire, be it here or somewhere else. Best wishes.
---
I've been finding legendary humanoid scorched in Harper's Ferry slightly more frequently than months ago. Also I've been now encountering them as part of the entourage of Scorchbeasts. For example, at non-nuked Prime or at the Pumpkin house. Something might have changed because between June and October this year, HF scorched had 0.7% spawn rate and 0% for the SB-entourage.
---
For mole miners, Lode Baring sometimes spawns a legendary Mole Miner, maybe 1 in 5 event.
---
Both cases, multi-star and have proper legendary loot.
---
It looks like one of the reactors to me, similar to the stacks at Monogah, with some makeshift Fallout-style modifications.
---
And i was told i live under a rock when it's a month that ,on ps4,aae rw gat plasma sprouted like it's spring. Duping is currently possible.
---
The data miners checked - the terminal entry in the Whitespring Bunker was hidden from view until the Burrows went live, so that's a clear connection. The Sonic Generator wasn't as clearly connected.
---
I payed for the game, I'm gonna play it. But this whole subscription business, I've already payed for the game, I shouldn't have to pay more.
---
Great advice for lover levels, I'm high level so this doesn't concern me. I accidentally did it when I was exploring Appalachia so when I got that quest, I could immediately get in
---
Well obviously. Since The game is made for people with IQ dmaller than their shoe size
---
There are a fair making of notes and such to find also.
---

_Low hp stealth hybrid build works great in my playstyle. I recommend hybrid long as you use only offensive perks when adventuring around.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04_HandMadeGun
---
Try this one, it seems to be more correct.
---
Also, VATS AP cost modifiers seem to be additive, not multiplicative.
---
An ordinary (non-25 LVAC) Handmade can go as low as 6.4 AP cost per shot.
---
Out of interest was this in a public server?
---
I don't think we need to wait for Wastelanders.
---
Wonder if this is a guaranteed fix for OPs issue, or a coincidence and a different issue
---
You are giving good advises, but you shouldn't incourage people to report players for throwing mines, it's not a bannable offense and hardly an exploit.  
---
Bethesda doesn't even ban blatant cheaters in NW or dupers, you should report this kind of players.
---
An Atom store purchase unlocks rare items in game for a limited time only because we're worth it ü§£
---
I won't lie I sold the nuka quantum paint plan for 5000 caps before.
---
FYI- there is no ‚Äúbeating‚Äù this game. The story isn‚Äôt over.
---
So any progress then?
---
I don't get it,  I posted something like this a long time ago about the mailbox and I got like barely any views I like never get many views on my post yet when someone else post something the same or a like they get like over 100 views
---
Communist detected on American soil, lethal force engaged.
---
This is capitalist marketing trick at it's finest, your anticommunist ammunition will be confiscated and sold to appropriate users
---
That would be great.
---
Also I think a fixed spawn at Appalachian antiques
---
Yea it took me until this game to get my own slice. I tried every machine I came across in Fallout 4 in multiple playthroughs and never got it.
---
Black character over here but I'm always wearing a mask, lol
---
Why is it not a great idea?
---
Ahh i see, i misunderstood the question.
---
Let me get this straight, you can't even play this game without casually incurring in some kind of bug or "exploit".  
---
You scrapped something in your Camp and now for a bug you have doubled the junk? EXPLOIT! BANNED!  
---
If it was an exploit that required a series of procedures and steps, I could understand..  
---
But you really think that Bethesda would ban someone for throwing a mine??  
---
With all the real cheating in this game, how many players do you think that Bethesda banned in this whole year? And for what?  
---
They don't have the tools to know if someone is going around throwing mines, and even if they did, why should they ban them?
---
It's absurd, the only thing that they can do is to fix this "exploit".
---
I have most mods unlocked like the popular ones , what mods do you want?
---
Its too late for that. They already made it one of the prime selling points. If they started handing it out for free others that bought it and dont feel the same as you would cause an uproar about how bethesda cheated them yadayda some BS. I love the idea, but i feel like its too late to for it to be realistic.
---
It's a random Spawn at the antiques shop.
---
Can get the BoS Lab Coat there too.
---
Yes
---
ye i was thinking around that price range.250-300 max.And i need it for my gunslinger.Plus i'm still looking for proper gear...i'm only lvl 55 and my armors are lvl 35 2star legendary(some of them) and my weapons are basically crap...
---
I do. Some people came in front and took pictures of my character. Asians seem to be quite rare in Appalachia
---
I'm asian...
---
... I mean, the closer the character creator let me be...
---
Sorry I meant in relation specifically to the commenters experience not yours
---
Speed demon is a must IMO
---
If you knew your subscription end date, why did you try and gain access to the FO1st server?
---
The defence events become somewhat onerous, although the fast travel is all free, can be quite lucrative if you enjoy running about a bit, keep crouching as you will likely gain attention from PVP players.
---
You are intentionally muddying the waters. Repeatedly doing something you know you aren't supposed to be doing on purpose, for a reason, is different than accidentally encountering a game bug.
---
The legal system recognizes this ethical dilemma and has dealt with it long ago. That's why there is a very different set of rules for say, negligence resulting in death, accidental death, and homicide. They all result in the same end (a dead person), but are treated very differently because of intent and willfullness vs. accident or coincidence.
---
And yes, they DO have a detection tool to tell if someone is doing this: multiple reports from different, unrelated users, with screenshots of the person who is doing it, being reported over and over. It becomes pretty obvious after 30 reports about the same person, captured in images again and again, that they are doing what people are saying they are. And even IF, for the sake of argument, it can't be proven who is doing this, all the devs need to do is recognize it is a problem because of all the complaints, and patch it so mines don't detonate on proximity to non-hostile players.
---
Stop with the logical fallacies and false information, please.
---
People hating on Bethesda because they released a full priced alfa =/= toxic players. While those two sets of people certainly overlap to an extent, they're not equivalent.
---
You can use it, but you can't put any more in the scrapbox.
---
Ok,  thanks
---
My friend had this problem over the weekend with his prime 50 cal. I thought he was crazy lol
---
Curiousity mainly. Normally if your not on the membership the private world segment has a lock icon on it. Mine did not so I said to myself "huh... Surely that's a UI glitch/bug right?" Clicked it and it brought me in so I leaved straight away and confirmed that yup. My sub had ended but my access to private world's is still a thing.
---
Sells subscriptions for real money that includes special unique items...
---
Later, gives special unique items to everyone for free...
---
Great hilarity ensues.
---
This reminds me about my first encouter with sb. Running for my life from group of scorched and sb bombing on the sky. Lvl 26.
---
So... Where in the game is stated that mines shouldn't do radiation damage to any nearby players?  
---
Maybe it's intended and it's not an exploit, it's just your assumption?  
---
I don't really think that it's intended, but if you want to talk about "logic" in this bug ridden game, and ignore how Bethesda used bans in this whole year...
---
It will get added, I'm sure, but only for Fallout 1st members, probably.
---
An even better way is to stop playing broken games. So few problems that way
---
&gt; I have over 1000 flux stored on my main character. That is also a small part of the junk i have stored. Therw is like 4000 acid, 20k steel, the list goes on. 
---
And people say FO1st is NOT P2W üòÜ
---
Sounds like the ammo scrap box you get from the vault raids.
---
Ahh thank you i had no idea the name or how to get thank you very much.
---
It doesn't matter how much attention you pay it gets scrapped during crafting and doesn't tell you it's being scrapped. Also quite often it will scrap them before using bulk acid I  have stored in my stash.
---
They could sell *Bug Squashing Kits* in the Atom store.
---
1. Take all of my Stimpaks, Radaway &amp; Rad-X and dilute them. (While Chemist perk is equipped)
---
2. Go to Vault-Tec High School and the nearby house with all the cat bowls and pick up every single piece of junk that I find. 
---
3. Bulk all the junk that I found
---
4. Sell all of the diluted chems + bulked junk + any excess purified water that I have and continue the cycle the next day.
---
Ive been searching for that perk forever and I just DO NOT see it in the perk menu. Do you know if Bethesda removed it?
---
Sometimes you gotta risk it for the buiscut
---
Well, seeing as you're the one who started talking to me, not the other way around, you seem just like an idiot and a dick head in general.
---
True, I think people that do this are petty, and extremely bored. But still, it's only some junk. And if you play smart, you don't have that many junk in your inventory anyway. If someone walks around with 50 flux in their inventory, they bought it on themselves.
---
They were using a CE script on their burner accounts to turn turrets into containers that do not save your character when you deposit or take items from them. It has been fixed last patch though.
---
You could drop them on the floor when crafting so that doesn't happen..... down voted for what?
---
All I see on here is people complaining never trying to offer help down vote down vote down vote.... lol whatever it's a game pay attention to what's important to you it's really that simple.
---
I wouldn't say P2W exactly, more, P2Haveacomfortableexperiencewithoutthestressofinventorymanagement
---
You are really going to go far enough to make the absurd assertion that maybe Bethesda INTENDED you to be able to get around the PvP restrictions and kill non-hostile players in non-PvP game modes and areas? Then go on in the VERY NEXT SENTENCE to say you DON'T think they intended it? 
---
........
---
ok.
---
Then use the SAME logical fallacy "Bethesda doesn't fix "A", so who cares if they don't fix "B"?" for the third damn time in 3 posts....
---
There is no hope for you. I can get you a GREAT deal on the Eifel Tower though, if you are interested!
---
Issues that arose with the scrapbox weren't centered around intentional wrongdoing or against people whose subscriptions ended. The people that had problems had activfe subscriptions.
---
There are people who cancelled and refunded their subscription, so you aren't on the cusp of a new frontier or experience either. If there were major issues losing a 1st subscription brought, you would have heard about them.
---
This explains so much! Especially the molerat that entered the back door to the Enclave bunker...
---
But does it really matter in the end? It's extremely rare to even see someone do this. And even if it happens, you just don't attack them, and everything is fine. You don't even lose caps, just store your junk as often as you can, which you should be doing anyway.
---
I agree with you completely! End game besides the unbalanced mess that is pvp is non existent. Hopefully Bethesda wouldn't be too lazy about it when wastelanders comes out
---
With grape mentats, alcohol, the hard bargin perk at 3.. you should be able to sell them to robot venders for 500. That's why people will buy them for any amount less.. they go make money off you trying to give someone a deal. 500 isn't too much. It's just right.
---
change da world my final message, goodbye
---
......how is being able to store steel pay to win? 
---
You people just love coming in here to bitch over nothing
---
I mean, there's so many people that will tell me that 76 is an MMO (it's not). But, if it is an MMO, most MMOs have a subscription fee. You buy the game, but in order to play, you pay an additional subscription fee. I'm not defending 1st in the slightest, it's a dumpster fire of a feature, but if this is an MMO, what's wrong with a subscription? And it's a subscription you don't need to play the game anyway. So, should 76 have a mandatory subscription like other MMOs?
---
I only think that it's something not intended, but not a big deal.  
---
Of course Bethesda will fix it, and they will take a lot of time to do that, but they will never ban someone for throwing a mine.
---
I'm saying this because Bethesda knows that they can't just ban people for every little offense, so they only ban players that really mess with the game, and still they are having an hard time to find them and prove what they are doing...  
---
A ban to people who are throwing nuke mines to afk players? It's not gonna happen, do you want to bet?
---
Weird. Sorry man, I got no answers then.
---
Love your idea of writing down directions like a real road trip! This unique stuff is my kinda gameplay üëåüëå I love following the roads and rivers.
---
Purple and white ski outfit.. you can find plans to CRAFT these. bathrobe. batting helmet. 
---
Not many people seem to realize what the Whitespring robots have for sale.
---
Thanks for the confirmation. I was just concerned in case some bug happens was all, as i have a lot to lose.
---
I‚Äôve transferred dozens of items like that and it seems to work every time. Also farming nukezone by rejoining always puts me in the same server.
---
It's called bulk ammo scrap
---
My second character is a grizzled black lady.
---
If you‚Äôre in a workshop area, you become vulnerable to PvP.
---
Most of the time no, sure it doesn't matter much. But there are a few reasons it should be patched anyway.
---
First, more and more people are going to see and copy it. It will get more common the longer it goes on and isn't patched.
---
Second, new players who don't know how to deal with this will be driven away from the game. I haven't played Nuclear Winter in weeks, even though I want to, because of the absolutely rampant cheaters. Let's not let it get any worse than it already is, and at LEAST complain about it. Bethesda might not do anything, but if you don't complain....
---
And once in a while, some poor bastard is going to forget to store his junk, or lose a bunch of flux or bulk shit they took out to trade or sell at a shop (They can mine you while you are in a shop vendor menu or trading with another player.).
---
Finally, why NOT fix it? Set mines to only detonate on hostile targets. Bam. Done. No reason not to.
---
I don't see it happening.They originally said they were gonna do it,but as things are,i don't see it happening any time soon
---
I don't know if the Xbox can do it but with PS4 you can connect 2 systems with an ethernet cable and transfer all the data to the new system. That would copy all of your pics as well as profiles and games
---
I thought about 100 times was a lot lol. All prime receivers unlocked about 6 months ago, so many ultracite parts and mod plans could outfit an army but no shocks. 
---
Probably lots of suprised lower levels that haven't done the quests yet that find those plans in paper bags, suitcases and cigarette machines!
---
Same here RDR2/BattleField1/BF5 (played the Demo for Pacific Campaign ran smoothly)/Far Cry 5 (the newest games I have) run fairly well
---
So this seems like a Bethesda problem issue as I have neither issues with the same games as yourself 
---
**EXCEPT for Fallout 76**
---
which has kept me apprehensive of buying it even if it's on sale for 20$...Because if those same FPS issues come along again, then Bethesda's customer support hasn't been the best to rectify any issues...
---
I "almost" think if this Fallout 1st thing really goes sour, they may make the game free to play and bank on micro transactions by the few whales?
---
I just don't want to end up with an unplayable game...
---
Fell for the same set up. Never again. Stopped visiting player vending machines not outside.
---
I have three so far, and a display case dedicated to them.
---
If they took out the tent and replaced it with a mailbox, I‚Äôd count it as a win.
---
See this is why I play early in the morning/late at night...like...no one is online.
---
Put 5 bullshit items on my favorites wheel? No thanks, I'm actually using that. Also, you don't seem to understand that Stings and Things is a daily repeatable quest.
---
Glitched bloatfly. He cannot die.
---
That works too. Even better, one might say. :)
---
If you play on PC, I‚Äôd be happy to hold on to them so you can swap.  I have plenty of positive karma on the market trade sub, and would be happy to do it through there so as to assure you I won‚Äôt run off with your gear.
---
Yeah I noticed the batteries right off...theory for that is that Bethesda copy and pasted the basic watchtower (which had a battery at the bottom) and just added new things to make them different.
---
Oh the doors are not solid objects?
---
Made mine Filipino like me. Used the coffee time I believe.
---
I wish they'd make it so applying a wallpaper doesn't store everything on the walls. It's kinda annoying.
---
I have a African American female character. I just wish the natural afro was much bigger...I want a HUGE afro because I based my character off of Cleopatra Jones and she has a large afro.
---
They said only cosmetics would be paid for. I don't play any subscription based mmo's or games for that matter, and wouldn't have gotten 76 if they said it would be subscription based. I know you can still play the game without 1st sub, but next mods are going to be locked behind 1st sub.
---
just as a little sidenote you can repair all of your turrets at once if you go to the workbench 
---
if you look at the workbench there is an option to "repair all"
---
also congatulations these scorchedbeasts are a real pain in the early levels üëçüèº
---
1. Buy/find the Civil War Top Hat plan.

2. Farm cloth and leather.
---
3. Craft a shit ton of top hats.
---
4. Slap on the trading perk.
---
5. Sell for 12 caps per hat.
---
6. Profit??
---
Oh I agree. They said cosmetics only in the shop, then quickly went back on that promise. And mods exclusive to 1st subscribers, that's a whole other can of worms. Bethesda games need mods to be good. Umm, the game should just launch in a completed state. Not let the modders make it a good game. The fuck?
---
If you don't mind I'll come find you tonight thanks! üòÇ
---
You get what you pay for
---
I would think you just payed for like so long and will only be taken away after however long you paid for. The cancel was jsut so they won't charge you again.
---
&gt;apparently you can no longer build here
---
Wouldn't you get a "CAMP could not be placed" error when you log in then?
---
You clearly miss the point, pity!
---
O.o asian here
---
I'm hoping some one will make a mod that lets you host a game on your computer, like a 1st sup but a 3de party mod. Then you can play with friends and mod the game to your harts content.
---
Bethesda is very well known for being late like half the time. You paid this company money and are shocked that they're late?
---
Not making excuses for Bethesda. I agree it's unacceptable but why would you expect anything less?
---
What point am I missing?
---
It's not exactly p2w but 1st members definitely get an advantage
---
Random junk legendaries (this was before the vendor). I'd hoard them because I knew the vendor was coming.
---
Made a "Chinese" melee character, she had a lot of scars because Chinese ladies, I assume, are not treated well in Fallout Appalachia. She is long gone, but now I have the darkest skinned, smallest, skinniest, green haired sneak riflewoman I could make, NW special.
---
XD
---
have to agree even aiming is bugged...
---
It's a rare-ish item but it only functions as junk ultimately
---
Oh yeah its a 100 now at first it was 40,000 not good a math, they do say stupid people get angered very easily,  go figure, me not good with numbers, ur so funny, i got it from now on i will just run all my posts by u, maybe next time just skip it, just a thought
---
i change the appearance of my charakter every moth or two.  
---
mostly recreating real life people, actors, characters from movies or games.  
---
So I've been Asian and black as well in the past.  
---
But u r right, most ppl i see are white and some of it got not even crazy with the editor.
---
Or take things out. Not to be confused with using it, all your scrap is usable. You just cant take it out from what ive heard.
---
Maybe if you'll read post more carefully you'll see that you talk about two different posts from 2 different people. Looks like you have problems with getting angered very easily as auto moderator removed your first post for swearing ;)
---
I think bethesda should fix this.  If you dont want to pvp and are in pacifist mode, then you shouldn't get killed by other players.  Just respect each others  choices if they  want to pvp or not.  But using these 'backdoors' to  harm  non pvp players is an exploit for me.
---
Id buy a few
---
Not approved! You tear that down right now!
---
I love doing this. I like to see how many in game days it takes strictly following the roads and camping over night to gather supplies wherever I camp. I do the same in all open world games and I'm happy to see someone else does too!
---
Never got a notification about it? Yeah thought u were the other person my bad, im not angry, why do u people feel the need to comment like that? Why not just skip? Do u police this sub? I never find posts that make me mad and feel i have to set someone straight kinda a dick move right, maybe next time just not comment and move to the next post but hey thanks for setting me straight tho really good job
---
It's in perception. Like the 2nd one you can get
---
Wow
---
I wanted to save your time ;) I'm pretty sure it'll be faster to search for already answered question (you can do it even in google, not necessarily in reddit) than starting new topic and wait for someone to answer the same question again and again...
---
I think you're right, perhaps the free states ones is what I'm remembering seeing out there - woopsies :)
---
That joke is insanely stale. 
---
I constantly try to explain to my kids that repeating the same joke over and over and over makes it less funny every time. 
---
I guess grown adults have severe trouble with that concept as well
---
No u were being a dick like the other person, re read ur comment, it doesn't start out nice, there is no nice in the middle and u wrap it up like a dick. So no not trying to save me time, not trying to be nice just being a dick. Anywho maybe i can help u out since i actually am a nice guy to nice people, when u see posts that have been answered already maybe 100 times maybe 40,000 time just swipe up and keep on scrolling my friend save ur self some time, how many minutes have u wasted with these comments? But again thanks for ur concern
---
Well emotional connectios do outweigh practical needs, I ne of my girl toons lives her Murgle house, even though she has to live in the Ash Heap, yuck
---
And I disagree with this. You are not a ‚Äúguild master‚Äù you are staying ‚ÄúI want another character but I don‚Äôt want to put in the work or caps to get a brick building plan‚Äù. Next would you like to have all your characters bases being allowed in the same world so you can build on them simultaneously on the same street? Come on man.
---
Phew! Thanks for the info. You can understand my paranoia though, right?
---
Been getting this first time with purveyor. Close and back in it goes away, never seen anywhere else.
---
If I have not found it or seen it after 1300 hours and ten characters, then, it's rare to me. People constantly want to buy my explorer and scavenger outfits. Would never pay 3000, but I can afford to spend 250 caps. Time and fast travelling plus ammo used to get there are a factor to consider.
---
Some people have mentioned that they can still use their Tent and go into Private Servers after cancelling the sub.
---
And AAffr gatling plasma...
---
Ironic if the radroach nearby survives the ghouls it can too go up elevator. Miss Outer Worlds where animals can't open doors.
---
It is so weird. One of my characters got two on the same gaming session. One in Flatwoods, one in Top of the World. Maybe forty minutes between those two slices. 
---
Nothing beats baked bloatflies, though.
---
Something is broke with it. I didn't cancel but had the same thing, access but they didn't charge me. Had to go on microsoft website cancel then resub manually to get my atoms. Honestly we probably should have expected it to not work right.
---
But getting wanted and hoping you will attack them is the best way to open up for griefers.
---
I play an elderly Black former Hornright engineer... 
---
Needs power armor to get around, so folks are surprised when an old Black guy pops out...
---
r/dadjokes
---
Not equivalent. And you need to know WHAT is being done, how, and report it before it can be patched in a game.
---
Yeah, it'd be easier than the current solution which is to build two radios side by side with the two different channels. Although that's just one extra click I guess.
---
Already in the game files as a utility item since early this year but remember this is Bethesda and they struggle with anything that saves across unless its atomic shop related hence why legenedary vault dwellers still not available.
---
Oh I misread. I thought he many same month
---
Thanks for the PSA. 
---
I'm actually quite glad it's a service and not a subscription b/c it allows me to re-up when/if I want to instead of auto-magically happening. This way I can get a 1 month sub, scrap like crazy, and then take a few months away until my scrap depletes to the point where I might want to do it again.
---
I once had the same problem. Stayed there for ten minutes (afk, chameleon) and it appeared.
---
And if you have Xbox and you cancel within 30 days you can get a full refund, but keep your stuff AND your privileges until the first of the next month!
---
Even though it is a PS4 issue, if you let the "service" expire briefly, will it effect gameplay, such as removing the contents from your infinite stashbox?
---
I mean, I guess that works
---
Damn you truely suck üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You are a saint. I dont know how I've never found that... but it's a lot more useful and user friendly than the wiki. I had heard also it was multiplicative but it's nice to see a hard number instead of trying to do the math myself lol. 
---
Do you know if the -25% AP cost legendary effect works the same as the mods?
---
They could do like a fight club arena style thing? You go in and start at rank 1 and each enemy you beat gets more challenging and has different buffs/debuffs builds and perks. Make it versatile so people can't powerhouse all the ranks day 1 and sit crying it wasn't a challenge. They could add achievements, gear, etc for rewards. You bring in you current inventory so not like nw where they strip you. Could be labelled 100+ and they could make the enemies way op. A real challenge, perhaps every now and again an enemy or 'challenger' is only available for a few days you beat him and he drops his named weapon or armor.
---
Just removing the negative would be a godsend. Or even creating a perk that boosts daytime damage to negate the dsytime nerf.
---
i have strangler heart pa and a b/25/15 fixer why do these fucks never challenge me
---
Ive seen 1 person try this with me, we ended up disarming and stealing 3 of his mines, then he killed himself, then we did it back to him with his own mines and got him again, he looked like a compmete twit at the end of it
---
Mine automatically renewed, i done it through the PS Store last month if that helps.
---
I'd say the opposite, a lot of levels before 50 don't count for much.  Since most good cards are level locked you end up having to take some trash perks early on that will need to be replaced.  For me it was around 65  by the time I had a solid build.
---
That's how powerful auto receiver look like. And no, it's not bugged, some real life AKs actually do look like that. I don't see the point of removing dust cover but yeah... Russians
---
Hope so, or could be seen as a super racist username haha üòÖ
---
Yes, it's an exit from Glassed Caverns, you can use it after finishing last quest for BoS.
---
Yea it is part of a mission.
---
Isn't that the exit from the glass caverns?
---
It has been there.  If you go all the way through the Glass Caverns, there is an elevator that will bring you up to that shack.....sadly one way.
---
Because you are wearing the most rad-resistant armor in the game. Nuke mines will do jack shit rad damage to you.
---
But I would still be cautious fighting griefers around your house. Their objective is to piss you off by stealing your stuff and breaking your CAMP. I have had people come at me again and again and killed them every time, but still had to log out because they were targeting my fusion generator/decon shower and other expensive stuff I had built. Their objective isn't so much to outright "win" sometimes as much as steal from you and make you have to do expensive repairs.
---
Given the choice I'd prefer unlimited scrap over a tent
---
Definitely epic. Makes me want to make another character to have the thrill of hunting again. As it is SB's rarely make it past my Bloodied fixer's first clip even when legendary.
---
It's the reason i missed the daily like 5 times yesterday!Honestly it's getting kinda annoying
---
What?
---
&gt; Because you are wearing the most rad-resistant armor in the game. Nuke mines will do jack shit rad damage to you.
---
i have the hellfire prototype paint applied to it so its undercover hehe
---
&gt;Their objective is to piss you off by stealing your stuff
---
i always deposit everything in my stash box
---
Yo you don't know what coal
---
Dust is
---
Mate Im ee
---
I love your books and "research" updates!
---
Because radroach can kill lvl 62 ghoul. I watched their Fight and it was awensome, I have event screen shots
---
Im pretty sure ghouls are still alive just heavily mutated from radiation exposure. I want to say three dog in fo3 has a quote about it
---
Well, you are doing it right, then. Just look out for the dudes that run in a pack and hit your expensive CAMP stuff with the Wrecking Ball card as soon as you go hostile to them. They can smash your entire CAMP in seconds before you can take them all out, and don't mind dying to do it.
---
Bloodied and in power armor? Yea I'd have no problem attacking you stronger armor or not. Your bloodied weapon does at much damage as a bench crafted fixer in PvP.
---
Is this the atomic shop thing? You can't trade cosmetics, you gotta spend atoms on skins yourself
---
I actually had to turn off auto renew through my services to make sure I didn‚Äôt get it again until I was ready
---
I didn't check ingame but i got an email confirming that i unsubscribed and another email when the subscription expired. If you didnt get these messages it could mean that sth went wrong in your case
---
25% faster fire rate tho :p
---
and you are gonna die from the acid damage if you try killing me
---
so please do try
---
I had to go into my service list and turn off auto-renew for the 1-month subscription, I didn't want to take the chance.
---
Running an endgame gunslinger build with a BE SA -- oneshots everything but bigger critters, priming it would help alot but the ammo is a hassle
---
I like that term, surprise murder XD
---
thanks :)
---
Only a corpse
---
Even before survival mode shut down, try hards have been jumping players at their workshops as it is one of the few legit ways to pvp nowadays.¬†
---
Don't be surprised if they don't run it after you leave. They're there just for the grieving.¬†
---
Don't even tty to argue with them. Even though they are often many times the level of the owner they feel they have the right to do so. They say it's game mechanics (which frankly it is ) and/or they're playing as raiders
---
I'd like to see where Bethesda incidents for you to not take AoE radiation damage unless you're the one who caused it. Until then it's not an exploit. AoE damage affects every player in every other instance.
---
Lol
---
Once you get the right perks and weapons you'll kill them in seconds
---
I have an unarmed Kung Lao character (black hat, pastor vestments) and a black grenadier.
---
I dont know how everyone doesnt know this..they used the ole dupe trick to have a bunch of nuke mines..you got lucky its just happened recently to you...just gotta be aware of surroundings...it makes a tick sound when you take radiation..im bloodied and always get away ...idk..maybe im lucky..or cheetah fast lol
---
Found the plans as world spawn
---
I killed someone with an explosive .50 cal (way faster than the fixer) and strangler PA. I killed them approximately 25 times for the two times they killed me.
---
From my understanding about what stats are out there, the controversy has actually caused growth, because it's being seen in the main stream crowds where they don't know what's going on. Internet outrage doesn't reflect real life.
---
It‚Äôs entirely possible the game just bugged out
---
video proof or get out that and they probably were trash at pvp
---
That's a wendino from me....
---
I'm a first member and I didn't get anything.  Get over itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Get over losing my junk? After paying for a year. Whatever dude.
---
Lmao how is that name racist ü§°
---
I do, I have both!
---
Oh sorry,  sorta skimmed it, I was reading multiple posts and got them mixed up. You have every right to be mad about losing your stuff
---
was jus about to say, now overprice it and watch it sit lol
---
I see you didn't bother to read all of my post, including the parts where I give you the damn dictionary definition of what an exploit is, why this IS one, and are too dumb to figure out that just stopping mines from detonating on proximity to non-hostile targets would be an easy fix for this instead of messing with complicated friendly-fire rad damage.
---
And you spouted off like an idiot anyway...
---
You put your foot in your mouth often?
---
Congrats on this Glorious achievement. I was telling my buddy it was hard to get them and when he clicks it FIRST TIME, FIRST TRY. GETS THE DAM PIE ü§£ü§£
---
Thanks for telling me about this! I have a bunch of Nuka Grenades I‚Äôve been waiting to use :)
---
hold up now that's a great idea to test! I loved berserker builds but it's hard to play it as it stands now. I will look into this!
---
My character used to be black. He went through a transitional period and now looks more like me.
---
Fuck is coal dust?
---
Radio needs an overhaul in general. 20 new songs for each station would be nice. And a better shuffling algorithm. I don‚Äôt want to hear Ring of Fire bad cover twice in 15 minutes.
---
That, and the gorram instagram smiley.
---
That instigating lever action with all 9 rifleman perks, tank killer and covert operative, stealth headshots is guaranteed 1 shot üòâ
---
Yes, as said above, that is the exit for the Glassed Cavern. Thorough confirmation!
---
Cranberries will give a boost.  Cranberry cobbler is good but cranberry relish is better.  Well rested and well tuned with well fed are boosts too.  Finding areas is easy xp, and fighting higher level enemies is a plus too.
---
Murgle is in great danger. She‚Äôll die brutally if the jetpacks don‚Äôt get fixed next month. #fixjetpacks #savemurgle
---
Ran into Vengey twice yesterday. His spawn rate must‚Äôve been up!
---
Sell extra chems, meds. You can clear vendor caps in a split second by selling them serums, if you have the ability and means to craft those.
---
Only coal dust I know of is the coal dust skin for Excavator PA....which doesn't help clarify this post at all  haha
---
Can u even get inside a silo?  There's a quest to that.
---
If you‚Äôre a 1st subscriber, you should scrap all of the weapons from Uranium Fever with ‚ÄúScrapper‚Äù perk card and store all the steal in your luxury scrapbox. If you‚Äôre not a 1ster, I agree that selling all the weapons is best choice.
---
And......then the game crashes....
---
Well, if they'd let me end him, then he wouldn't get out a second time.
---
Second, have you noticed that Grahm only takes breaks for meat week?  Otherwise he's walking around the wastelands with Chally, all the time.  You can't keep a good supermutant down, and as it appears, you can't keep a bad one down either.
---
That is kind of my thought. Honestly barter as the primary trade makes sense in a post Apocalypse world.
---
I'm pretty sure you can also get more prefixes!  I've seen both glowing and scorched Yao Guai ghouls.  Haven't seen a diseased yao guai ghoul yet but have seen a diseased scorched one.  There's a large area where yao guai are a common spawn to the east-northeast of Pricket's Fort.
---
Not defending Bethesda, but it does make sense... I mean, if you are going to paint a real wall, you remove all the hardware and store it, paint the wall, and reinstall the hardware. 
---
But yeah... having to follow the real-world process inside a video game doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense.
---
Yeah.  Someone wanted to know if I could apply the shocks to their Power Armor and I was like, oh, of course, I must know that.  I pretty much drop the Ultracite plans out of habit because I have no use for them.
---
And turns out, I didn't know it.
---
The character editor is one of my favorites in a long time, like since Saints Row and Soul Caliber. There is really a lot you can do with it.
---
It's worse than that. I can go up and sneak around, but the moment I stand up to use a crafting bench, half the zone comes charging in the door. I've had a dozen ghouls show up to watch me paint my power armor.
---
I‚Äôve made it to 30k caps 100 times now. Every single time has been from player vending. Selling weapons and armors for 2k-10k caps.  That‚Äôs where the money is. But since fallout 1st release. Player base has gone away a little in public matches so I don‚Äôt get as much business. But I also have stopped playing some because of the business loss.  Maybe it‚Äôs bette now.
---
How do you do a stealth gunslinger?
---
Do you rely a lot more on armor bonuses for your stealth? 
---
Seems like there would be just too many required perks all jammed into Agility.
---
I'd love to see some popcorn ceilings or maybe that fancy swirly/circular stuff, or heck, even just some white paint. My current workaround was to build my house two stories high and do a nice vaulted ceiling. The wooden beam thing they roof pieces have looks more natural this way, and since my place is actually only one floor (because I HATE the way the "stairs" look) this works out well
---
Yes.  As other people have said, be fully aware that any time you're within the workshop zone, you're open to PVP.  That being said, claiming workshops can be a great way of amassing XP, plans, and supplies (via rewards) in your lower levels.  If you claim enough of them, you'll eventually start getting almost back to back "defend events".  Rather than defending against the waves, I always let them overtake the workshop and would go back for the "reclaim" event instead.  With reclaim events, all the enemies are usually centralized in one location so you don't have to run all around large workshop areas trying to track them down.
---
Also, be aware that there is a fast travel mat under the misc structures tab in your workshop build menu.  You can put down one per workshop and if you are thoughtful about where you place it you can travel into your workshop in strategically advantageous positions.
---
AA is Anti Armor
---
(I'm also surprised, never seen anyone complaining).
---
First, the joy-cons are a joke. They're built to break. I've bought one for my son, and, in 2-3 months of use, one analog is already pointing up as default, for some reason.
---
The entire hardware itself looks like it's waiting to break in pieces.
---
I have other points, but those are major for me.
---
Seen a ton of prefixes...just haven‚Äôt seen the ghoul til recently. Still wondering how we got diseased robots for a while...do they have a virus? ü§£ü§£
---
It got shit because they advertised it as being so difficult you would need 2+ level 50+ characters to complete it but it turned out you can soli it around level 30-35 if you optimized your perk choices along the way
---
That's one of things that I would like to point: the game should be labeled as beta. Fortnite was in beta for a gooood time (or still in beta, not sure).
---
Nothing.
---
Go play, learn, have fun exploring.
---
It‚Äôs one of the most frustrating bugs in the game imo. I haven‚Äôt counted attempts before, but it would be a lot of attempts. I have tried all the suggested ‚Äúfixes‚Äù I‚Äôve seen here and none of them work reliably. 
---
Also, I started playing in May and I don‚Äôt remember this ever happening to me back then. It feels like it‚Äôs getting worse every week.
---
Clearly they weren't practicing safe data sharing procedures.
---
My teammate is of asian heritage and so's his character. Most people are covered up or wearing head gear so pretty hard to tell. That said i see plenty of black folks around in the game, in fact the other week i had a particularly memorable encounter with a Lion-O and female black Panthro at the overseers camp, looked like new characters getting leveled.
---
Thundercats FTW!
---
This was as a Hobbit hole, and that meant comfort.
---
Pretty cool. I am also from a shire.
---
:)
---
&gt;ound every DLC and release. So much in fact that fans will defend loot box's and micro transactions. Same for Fortnite, Battlefield an
---
Wish your text was the post instead of mine. Nailed some good points.
---
Probably windows based.
---
This bug came along with patch 11 or 12 when they put the stupid timer in. Idk why they have such a hard on for timers.
---
The game has a lot more than 250 concurrent players.
---
Well, it *is* West Virginia.  =)
---
But yeah - I've seen the occasional black/brown character. Not sure I've ever seen an Asian, though.
---
I did see someone that looked almost exactly like my character the other day, though, which tells me I was probably not liberal enough with my slider adjustments.
---
Think you get the record for that amount. Had it happen occasionally and normally if I‚Äôm tapping the buttons fast. But yeah it‚Äôs so annoying, especially when you hear a Scorchbeast coming and need to exit fast.
---
Display cases, bobble head stands magazine racks but these storage take up camp budget.
---
Atom shop fridge, atom shop collectron that gathers scrap, wallpapers for walls. 
---
And a second minicamp/unlimited scrap storage but it's only for subscribers.
---
Also the new vault raids. (I left around the same time just been snooping the Reddit last few days)
---
There is a lot of posts on the Beth website and none if them tldr important and new features.
---
dont worry about gear, until you hit 50 your just gonna keep outleveling the weapons you pick up.  as long as your running your weapon perks for your weapon choice your solid
---
No I‚Äôve been trying to grind the main quest for that
---
Mine automatically renewed.
---
That's pretty cool actually!
---
I wish the display stands didn't take up so much budget :(
---
Deleted about 12 neon lights and still couldn't fill a single bobble display.
---
Don't have proof. If you don't want to believe me I'm ok with that. And yea, I think a bloodied PA build is always gonna be trash at PvP.
---
I‚Äôve tried pressing them slower. Even gave it 10 seconds. Still denied
---
Rarer than a flatwoods monster from my experience!
---
Oh shit it isn‚Äôt I thought launching the nuke and liking the queen was it
---
Accept help from strangers, but don't depend on it. Try not to finish the last quest in a faction set until level 50 so you can get a few legendaries at max lvl, don't take a workshop if you can't feasibly defend it, because there are assholes that watch for low levels taking them and will show up with the intent of mopping Appalachia with your blood, save EVERY SINGLE legendary item you get, that way you can trade for scrip later. Don't buy ANY legendaries from the purveyor until Level 50. Absolutely do not go into the missle silos unless you're level 50+ with a group of at least 3 other people who are at least level 50+. Take some time every session to play nuclear winter. You get some cool workshop items, outfits and skins for ranking up in it. Save your caps for plans. Literally nothing else is worth buying. You may try to justify a purchase, don't. Only plans. You'll thank me later. Don't fast travel as much as possible, if you have certain areas that you frequent, make sure you and your group place your camps near those areas so you can fast travel for free.
---
Can you not select the race at the start? I can't remember.
---
That‚Äôs what I say in my head it is but you‚Äôre right it just randomly happens.
---
Server hop till you find em. That's all that works really.
---
+50% without any immediate negatives is already good enough by itself. The "negative" is you can only sometimes use it. Both effects are fine, it's just something to keep as a secondary weapon/armor set. We could use an alternative effect for daytime as well, but the numbers are fine as they are. Also isn't day and night literally 50/50 in this game?
---
Yeah I always make my first character try to look like me.
---
When picking perk cards, it‚Äôs much smarter to lay out your build before you start just picking random cards. Use a website like nukesdragons or another to mess around with what type of character you want to be. Most people think they can be a two handed melee and also a stealth rifleman but it‚Äôs basically impossible. Just stick to one type of gun and perfect the build to get max dps
---
Wish someone told me this before I started
---
I think a lot of it has to do with where you are and your stealth status.  If you can't FT, you need to move away from your current spot a bit.  I've noticed this bug appears a lot less when both of my characters went to something more stealth-oriented, where I could reliably get into Hidden/Caution or hide in plain sight.
---
Course, there are players for whom the stealth system is just completely broken and are in danger despite there being nothing around.
---
That'd be interesting. A server for people who are well geared. I like the named weapon idea it'd be nice for trophies and what not
---
It‚Äôs not an exploit and you‚Äôre warned about PvP before claiming a workshop
---
glad noone told me this.
---
So starting a brand new game, and first thing he should do is look up a build online and be forced into a specific direction, great.
---
go play, make mistakes, learn from those mistakes, if you're thinking there's a guide to how you should play, then this is clearly not the game for you OP.
---
Only thing you want to think about ahead of time is your playstyle - and thus, your SPECIAL build.
---
If you're a veteran of Fallout games, you probably have a playstyle you prefer; most of them translate reasonably well in FO76, but some (notably pistol-based builds) are just not very good here. There are also entirely new builds here (like Bloodied builds) that you wouldn't see in previous games. Rifle-based builds and melee-based builds are very good, and are the two most common "meta" playstyles you'll find here.
---
The CAMP system is the house building from FO76, but limited and a little more janky than previous. That you can learn on your own; it's easy enough to break it down and rebuild again, so little lost there.
---
Nuclear Winter (the FO76 battle royale) is fun, and you can unlock some cosmetics for adventure mode if you're feeling brave. Reports of hackers on PC are a bit overblown.

If you have specific questions, ask and we'll do our best to answer. The in-game community is easily the best I've ever seen in an online game, and all you have to do is step out of the vault in your new vault suit, and people will probably hand you free stuff. (There's also a non-zero chance you'll run into a griefer, but that just keeps things exciting.)
---
Controls temporarily disabled
---
Use a melee weapon on weaker, low level mobs to save ammo. It‚Äôs very hard to keep that in supply early in the game.
---
Well... considering that the BoS doesn't even exist in this area at this time... it couldn't possibly be real BoS, and likely is just some cosplay morons in the WV wasteland who didn't know how to code anything. Probably why they're all dead; they coded where only humans could get in with a code, but ghouls had free roam access.
---
Engineers - 8/10, Would likely recommend.
---
Programmers - 0/10, Would never recommend.
---
Now sell it for 25k caps
---
The XP from glowing ones used to be waaay nicer. People would nuke and farm whitesprings all day long back in the early days. There were times I would level like 10 times in an hour.
---
I dont believe so, but why use something that can be used half of the time instead of all of the time, like AA, Bloody, or junkies (I know the last 2 have downsides, but bloody has some counter effects)
---
Free face paint called that?
---
Don‚Äôt even joke like that. Once that pops up, the server never recovers
---
If i see the message, i crouch and it always recognizes an enemy within range. If I attempt to defend myself or use a weapon, it denies but if I just wait it out it will always fast travel me when the countdown ends.
---
What alway got me was my bulk scrap. It pains me to think of how much plastic I have wasted because of this.
---
I don‚Äôt get why this is downvoted? You‚Äôre not saying FO76 is a terrible game or anything.
---
I forgot that Grenadier existed, thank you for the tip!
---
Thank you! üòä
---
Ahh yes I remember those days. It's true tho I remember the first time I did a double XP weekend there after a nuke launch, sweet lord my level was going up faster than my rads
---
You could have just said people are using AOE radiation effects to initiate PVP. Everyone be aware and be careful and then saved your detailed step by step on how they do it for your report to Bethesda.
---
Thank you! I'm glad you like it. The budget is 100% full üòÉüòÖ
---
Seen you in nw =\]
---
Nope.
---
Grizzled? Haha!
---
I was just saying this the other day. popcorn ceiling, smooth....anything!!!
---
I have had this happening since the last patch. It‚Äôs so frustrating
---
Congratulations plz don't be one of the ppl who sell this for a ton it's not that rare just eat it
---
Yeah. She's an older lady with scars and shit. A raider. Wish I could give her an eyepatch.
---
Ok yea the joycons are kinda a joke. I forget about that cause I've been lucky enough to have it not happen to me. I basically only use my pro controller.
---
Where can i find it?
---
As I said, it doesn't require you to claim a workshop. You just need to be in the area when someone else does.
---
I've seen a few of the vids on the Tube. Some ofbwhich didn't involve the mat but rather a deathclaw or a cliffside. LoL. Absolutely asholish moves, however ingenious they may have been. As for the ideas mentioned earlier... I love the idea of the firefly lights! Or the fireplace that sits flush... So many greats there! These are the rrasons I love starting these discussions!
---
They should have had the eypatch on the atom store when the pirate outfit was dropping at Halloween!
---
I didn't know about it. And I've never anyone try it with me. The worst I've had is some do try to initiate PvP with me by hitting me &amp; stuff in my camp with a sledgehammer while his buddy tried to hide in the bushes and power armor pretend like they weren't affiliated. I had pacifist on so he couldn't do any real damage, I just saluted him and went back to what I was doing and eventually he got bored and went away.  I've only been playing since the free weekend a few months back though. If the rad trick happens to me now though I'm going to blame this guy for telling the world how to do it. Lol.
---
12 NukaColas!  Vintage Nukashine world tour coming up!
---
Only thing to add to this is, is be careful with Workshops and unsolicited friend requests
---
OP reminds me of some Users I used to have to deal with as an IT guy.  They would talk to me the he did and then not understand why I was terse with them afterwords.
---
Some people just don't realize they're being rude I guess.
---
My mule is a copy of Sam L. Jackson from Black Snake Moan.
---
Bloodied are so easy to mess with, even a spike trap kills them.
---
Yes this is how it is designed to function
---
If you get the count down timer, are you engaging an enemy at all?
---
They don't have a BoS ID but they do have Fallout 1st!
---
I can still while hidden and the timer will appear and disappear at any moment in the countdown. Working theory is its enemies moving to and away from you
---
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, eh?  It's one of the few broken things about the game that's actually beneficial.
---
The Ghouls were BOS, they have access already.
---
It was already patched is call'd Fallout 1st... ^.^
---
From what i understand, Sneak is capped to max. 50 by aglility !? So more then 10 Agility wont make sneak better by it s stat?
---
How you get that much agility? That +3 to Agility? Is it only on BoS Armor pieces? Not the +3 if health is low.
---
Thanks for a Reply.
---
I shoot an explosive gun toward the top of the waterfall and run around out of stealth. Usually works.
---
It was already patched is call'd Fallout 1st... .^
---
Don't be in a hurry to do the main quest once it takes you past the Morgantown airport. It's very easy to get in over your head very quickly that way. Stay in the forest for at least your first 10 levels
---
12, shortly after they've change the way fast travel works and problems begin. I know they want good (allow FT even when enemies are near), but since then it's very irritating to FT. And what's worse, occasionally I finish in completely different location, few days ago like almost-half-a-map-different...
---
Excellent idea! I‚Äôve done this myself a few times.  There is something a bit more painful though...
---
Torture runs. For example, Mayor for a Day as close to level one as possible. Did it for a friend, and walked all the way there to get the patched suit. They wanted Pickman, in three hours they had it.
---
;) Aren‚Äôt we responsible for those we tame ?
---
"Is it Bethesda being generous ?"
---
You must be new here.
---
It‚Äôs a curve not a flat 50% buff at night right? I remember captainnoob said it only peaks at 50% at midnight, then goes downhill. It‚Äôs really a poor balancing, why can AA be full time 1.3x buff with zero limit while Nocturnal has to be punished during the day. They should either give it a flat 1.5x buff from sunset to sunrise, or make the peak at midnight 2x instead of 1.5. And remove the punishment during the day, it‚Äôs just stupid.
---
Depends on the player. Not everybody has 5 different characters with all the best guns lol.
---
Have had maybe 20 different handmades myself with combos of AA, ffr, explosive furious but always go back to the 2* FE found on a ghoul 6 months ago. With stinging mag, tank killer and other perks it kills anything in seconds üòÇ
---
But are you getting hit at all by enemies? I‚Äôve never had a timer stop randomly for no reason so I‚Äôm trying to better understand.
---
Yeah and that‚Äôs how it should be. Imagine if you went to claim a workshop and I just stood there making it so the timer didn‚Äôt move and you couldn‚Äôt do shit?
---
It‚Äôs there to prevent BS like that, and I very, very, very rarely see someone in a workshop area just chilling without actually capturing it
---
That's the point, i'm not new and to be honest i'm afraid to play because they might ban me or something.
---
No. You can‚Äôt be hidden and getting hit at the same time
---
this is exactly what i love to do, especially on a Saturday morning!
---
i make some coffee (irl lolol), smoke a little cannabis, check my gear, turn on the Appalachia radio and just go. no plan, no plotting... if an area nearby on the map has no marked location then I make my way there. 
---
i like finding places, say, with a chair or a bed... good chance to reheat my coffee... take a few hits...
---
many unmarked locations tell stories when you take the time to observe all the items and skeletons in the area. it‚Äôs really remarkable how much is actually in the game world.
---
funny thing is by doing this i end up with all kinds of loot and then incorporate these locations into my farming rounds. very therapeutic.
---
Welp I cant say I‚Äôve expected this coming from bathesda
---
PvP is awful anyway and now that there's enough high levels the kind-heartedness of the community is starting to be overshadowed by this other class of asshole that uses only the best (or most faceroll) PvP builds and does shit like this.
---
This is why we needed private servers, and needed them to be *free*. This kind of player is becoming very common. Holding a workshop nowadays is an invitation to some dick server hopping actively looking for someone making this mistake so they can steamroll you out, for one example.
---
Survival servers went downhill because world PvP in this game is just a bunch of kangaroos with insane guns (or just basic tesla rifles) shredding each other apart with no goal. Nuclear winter seemed okay but then it filled up with hackers. It's a sign that maybe objective-based PvP events would be better. CTF, objective to hold all workshops in an area, "nuclear football" reverse CTF, respawn tickets given by holding control points, "mutant slayer" much like Halo's "juggernaut" gametype. Could have it all be wargames overseen by MODUS and you get to unlock drops or support powers via Kovac-Muldoon...anything but senseless world PvP to get these dickbags out of the faces of regular players. Of course, the poor balance of PvP might make it all a moot point but still.
---
Faction-based PvP would be nice, but it still wouldn't prevent the faceroll nature of PvP in this game. There is such a thing as too much meta, the specificness and number of builds good for PvP's wonky breakneck combat is evident of too much meta being involved in a build, especially when you consider it against the pace of PvE combat.
---
Go up to an Asian and say ‚Äúyo rice box‚Äù I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre getting a nice reply. You can read anything and make it what ever you want, and my comment how I meant it was meant as a joke
---
If you are hidden there shouldn‚Äôt be a timer though, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused by what you are describing.
---
It's a sensitive lot that lives here.
---
This good info.  I was amazed at the story a place can tell when you thoroughly loot areas. The type of junk relating to specific activities and the mix of junk you find gives you a feel of the daily activities of those present and past in each location.
---
Half this games mechanics are broken. It‚Äôs a hard time making sense of half the shit in this game. The game does what it wants when it wants to
---
Thats what I'm saying, other perks have 0 downsides with great bonuses, while nocturnal works only at certain times and gets worse while it isnt working. I want to be "the dark knight", not the "only good when its dark knight"
---
Similar thing happened to me. One of my friends told me it was hard to get and I got it first try on my first time, she was really mad üòÇ
---
Maybe if you‚Äôre fragile something as small as ‚Äúrice box‚Äù would offend you. You‚Äôre really grasping for straws with that one lol
---
I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôve never experienced that. Can you post a video? Maybe this is something the community can help you with.
---
I see you woke up on the cunt side of the bed this morning. I'm asking you to provide proof that this isn't an intended mechanic. You don't have any. You just don't like it so you think it shouldn't exist.
---
So that is what a power armor horde looks like
---
Yeah I have seen him twice in two weeks. He nearly gave me a heart attack this morning :D
---
You wanna experience this? Leave as much shit alive in the Mainframe Core room of a silo or just bypass it entirely through the forklift glitch. Launch the nuke. You‚Äôll be hidden with a room full of bad guys downstairs. You also won‚Äôt be able to fast travel out because it will keep cancelling it on you until you head back down past the missile
---
I guess. I would say for the average players, taking two people in would probably be the ideal. Most people aren‚Äôt soloing at that low level. I know I wouldn‚Äôt be, especially during a first play through.
---
Christ! How many times do these things have to be said?
---
What are you doing with all that stuff anyway?
---
You‚Äôre like midknight lol üòÇ. Nocturnal is the only perk that‚Äôs relevant to time and lighting, and they managed to make it useless. Really poor design.
---
Yep. This has been happening ever since they got rid of Survival. All the griefers came over and are now doing this while I craft lol.
---
This is why lately I mostly play on private servers.  No assholes that way.
---
I just want to see a video.
---
I'm level 100 and something. I never launched a nuke. At level 30 -40 I was on a team with a guy that ran off and launched a nuke, then I got the guest finished notification. And now I cant do the quest. I'll be happy to launch the nuke with you. I'm on PC.
---
My friends always get mad when I get a pie, which happens often for me üòÇ not counting the ones from West Tek I must've gotten over 50 of them. Most of them within a few tries but sometimes I'd sit there for 10+ mins just to get a pie üòÇ
---
So you really want me to go install one and set it up, record myself going through all of this shit and hoping the game breaks just the right way so you can be satisfied? Give me about 30-45 minutes to try and recreate it
---
I‚Äôm not Asian, nor am I fragile. The comment wasn‚Äôt meant for you, so just scroll on by peckerwood
---
If it was like the shadowed armor effect, it would be more useful lol
---
You‚Äôre acting pretty fragile bro but whatever you say lmao
---
Just make sure to pull out üòÇ
---
Lol are they explosive?
---
Needs a perk that jives with it called "shrouded in shadows" or something. 4 ranks, 25% more shrouded making rank 4 completely shroud you in shadows and be in night time mode at all times.
---

Infinite party!
---
Hahaha okay kiddo
---
This doesn‚Äôt even touch on the amount of stuff with a CUT_ prefix. 
---
There‚Äôs some really cool things unused for sure.
---
I do this on main and 3 mules 
---
- 10 minutes ... 5600 caps
---
Yea lots of missed opportunities in this game. Seems like the devs themselves are obsessed with certain effects so they want to see everyone walk around with the same build (BE aimbot commando etc)
---
OPen your Pip boy, go to the apparel tab.
---
scroll to the PA you want to rename, then select Inspect.
---
THe inspect screen should have a rename option.
---
IIRC, you can rename weapons the same way.
---
There's no reason it couldn't be.
---
Ammo, ammo, and more ammo 
---
If you price .45 or .556 for 1 cap each you will sell as much as you can produce.  Heck, I bought 3K off a vendor today because the person was charging 1 cap per bullet
---
Totally not complaining about it. It was just an interesting observation I made. I‚Äôm with you. If she wants to pick on me, so be it. Whatever keeps her on the ground... :)
---
I am not asking the question "wHaT hApPeNs To My StUfF iN dA bOx" i am questioning Beth's reliability on making a mechanic work. How can i not be paranoid, when they are constantly fucking up? Even worse, people are not getting their stuff back, including full sets of strangler PA etc.
---
Also- it is ao i do not have to farm junk for the next like 3 months. Making use of the all you can eat storage before it disappeared. Why not? Abundance of caps, may as well spend on junk and horde away for a rainy day, with it not making a mark in my stash box?
---
I'm guilty of doing that lol, but a heavy PA bloodied build
---
You will actually do a lot of the scout stuff in the course of roaming around.
---
I am trying to help you... relax. Sometimes taking a minute to problem solve can be productive. You didn‚Äôt say you were on PC. If you were on console, recording is built in.
---
Nope.  Not at all.
---
Your ass makes your ass look big, though.   That's for sure.
---
Butt, hey:   As long as you don't have to make two trips to haul ass, it's all good.
---
The point here is doing this does literally nothing to help me or anyone else. It‚Äôs already confirmed this is an issue and the majority of players can‚Äôt find a viable solution except to keep trying and move away from the area. If you can‚Äôt understand how it doesn‚Äôt work by me telling you, how are you going to understand by seeing a video of the exact thing I just described to you? The point is it doesn‚Äôt help anything. I just really don‚Äôt have anything better to do
---
Yea everyone i run into is wielding an explosive handmade, i have those too but it‚Äôs just booooooring to see them everywhere, now I‚Äôm playing with pipe revolvers and flamers üòÇ
---
Not the guy who posted this, but I think the best thing to do is let people know what they're in for so they don't hit 70 and have to spend 20+ levels respeccing like many of my friends have.
---
Then he can choose whether to do his own thing or not.
---
Lol, I just cant bring myself to use anything else, my base in in between 3 unmarked fissures, so I need to delete scorched beasts as fast as possible
---
Two stations will not solve the whole problem (
---
I want Rose raiders radio.
---
i recommend you follow the main quest in order. so many people wanted to skip to the enclave so they can launch nukes, but they missed out on a lot of interesting lore doing so.
---
that said, you don't HAVE to do the main quest in order. do what you want, whatever seems fun to you. explore, do events and side quests, grind xp when you can, build a camp, craft food, sell your unneeded stuff in a vendor, become a raider and contest owned workshops, do whatever you want.
---
That would be awesome if you could do that right now I‚Äôm in school and I won‚Äôt be able to play Tomorrow either I know this is not helping to reach my goal
---
I have heard people talking about clicking the map and having it exit without doing anything. This is the fast travel bug most people talk about. I‚Äôve experienced this several times. I‚Äôve never seen someone say they get a timer and it exists randomly, which is why I wanted to see a video to see if something else was going on that maybe you aren‚Äôt aware of.
---
And after all that, I kill them by standing on a bed in a corner just out of their reach and face blast them with my shotgun
---
I ran into a pair of assholes who turned 2 events into PVP. Made sure i 1 shotted the legendaries when i could, though they probably didn't care, but if they are to grief, no soup for you!. That's not why we go to events.
---
And you are a dumbass who can't fucking READ. The "proof" is in an edit at the bottom of the damn original post. So I shouldn't have to reply to idiotic comments like this. Hence, why I am tired of talking to someone so incredibly dense they want to insist an obvious exploit is somehow "intended" just to be an obtuse dickhead. Excuse me for telling someone who is so stupidly argumentative that they are more interested in finding a tiny fault that doesn't actually matter in the big picture to turn into a time-wasting argument than solving a problem that they are being a moron.
---
"Maybe we should have been a little nicer to those Germans during WW2!" &lt;- This is what you sound like.
---
Yup. I first reported it back in February. I offered crash dumps, but CS...well, you saw the cap.
---
Sometimes you can get "items" that aren't really items.   Put it up for sale in your vending machine for 25k caps and see if some nut decides he has to have it.   (I'm not sure that Neurotoxic Dust is one of these glitched statuses become item, but for example, I have a "cap" as in bottle cap in my Miscellaneous.   Sometimes you can pickup something that isn't normally a lasting item in the game.
---
My friend has 15 luck on his character and had gotten several pies. I may have called him a whore a few times over it. I have only gotten one.

it was supposed to be exclusive to some atom shop bundle, but was accidentally given to people for free in the camp build menu. if you already built one or stashed it, it's still yours, but if you scrapped it and didn't buy the bundle it's gone forever.
---
.....yeah but what happens to my stuff? I'm really worried now üòÇ

Many heavy guns can shoot them out of the sky fast, I used gatling or 50 cal or mini when I camped in the borg, SBs were never a problem. LMG can wipe them out super fast too.
---
No they spawn, It‚Äôs not a guarantee they will be there, just random chance
---
I‚Äôve got the video showing you can still be forced to wait while in hidden. I‚Äôll get it uploaded after I finish the silo. No need to waste a good nuke run. And the circumstances pertaining deal with enemie proximity. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre hidden. If it‚Äôs within a radius you‚Äôre forced to wait
---
I have a BE LMG and a BFFR gatling gun, both prime. They erase them fast, the gatling can hit for 900 a shot... so its pretty damn good
---
We have a bug in the system for this one! We'll let you know when we have more information on timing.
---
Radscorpion stinger staff as well. 
---
I would love to see different variations of a broken nuka bottle as well - different colors. I'd pay atoms for that skin tbh
---
Nop. Just different present faces that you can mold and can change skin tone on any of them
---
When I'm doing this with my bloodied melee build I've found that if you position yourself just right on the jukebox you can use it as a shield (at a cost of having to repair it several times, but the ghouls drop enough loot to offset that). Since I one shot by nature I tell anyone coming in, "We're playing hockey. The jukebox is the goal. I'm the goalie. If a ghoul reaches the box I kill it.  Please get your shots in before then. If you don't let the legendaries reach me, I have a bloodied heavy gun that I can kill race you with, and I'll probably win - so let's cooperate and everyone wins."
---
Ahhh.... Thanks

Also brain bombs.

 &gt; We have a bug in the system for this one! We'll let you know when we have more information on timing.
---
I can confirm, have found many magazines and bobble heads on private worlds.
---
Oh ok when i got the game it was available in my menu.  I didnt scrap it though but good to know!  Many thanks.
---
You were hidden when you started to fast travel?
---
I‚Äôve been standing behind enemies and still hidden, click fast travel and away I go.
---
Good numbers! 
---
So using the same site numbers the SBQ has a melee attack of 220 so any armor beyond 440 begins to have diminishing returns in mitigation though 4x attack value could get the damage down to .3.
---
By that logic 2x the top NPC damage would be more than adequate for most people but if you wanted to try for 4x you could get to the top practical breakpoint.
---
Yep, I have the video to prove it, and the current working theory is that when the enemies leave the proximity radius it cancels the fast travel timer
---
yeah bethesda can't exactly erase it from people who built one, but they did lock building new ones behind the atom purchase. so, just never delete/scrap yours and you're fine.
---
Nowhere in your tirade of edits does it say "this is in an exploit because..." You can spam the definition of exploit but there's no proof this isn't an intended mechanic. I hope you get blown up by 1000 nuke mines every time you log on you giant donkey dick.
---
Thanks for confirmation that this is in fact a known exploit and not intended by the devs!
---
I really miss this feeling. Now I just typically run from SB because they aren't worth the ammo to kill. :/ I haven't played in a couple of weeks so maybe that isn't the case anymore. 
---
As for OP, and I do mean this sincerely, I hope you get to enjoy that awesome feeling while it lasts. Sounds like an epic battle though!
---
Well the tents we knew would work
---
The server lags on updating the bar.
---
Yea Gatling is my long time favorite, for pretty much everything. In golf club I just run into it and wake everyone up then stand in the doorway let my gat mow them down, then loot the ghoul piles, it makes everything so efficient. Ammo is very easy to come by too.
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is sarcasm/humor?
---
Yeah, I crafted over 13k ultracite 5mm and have 17k normal in my stash, ammo is abundant for how good it is

Good point. Possible solution: The game should't make me a competitor when I just stand there in the first place. Your claiming process should just ignore my presence when I don't actively choose to interrupt it by claiming the workshop myself.

Anchor Farm I think is the name?  Just north of Vault 76, sometimes sitting on the sandbags on the patio roof.
---
Got my first 2 days ago i think. And thats fallout 4 and 76 together.
---
You're acting like a total fucking dickhead. I seriously hope that every time you log on for the rest of time you're griefed with nuke mines until you give up logging on for the rest of your life.
---
Weird. Ok. Look forward to seeing video.
---
I'd argue, but the infinite stash box is kinda a fix.
---
Same here. Then again when it did work it was next to useless.
---
Take you time.  Follow the overseers quest line.  it will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
explore, learn the lore.  resist the urge to fast travel - you find a lot more locations walking around.
---
Unlike previous FOs, you are limited in the amount of stuff you can store and carry. 
---
Map is divided into several areas - each has its own difficulty.
---
Stay in the forest/green area, west side) until L15 or 20, then go to the Toxic Valley (north by the alligator).
---
At 30, head to the ash heap (south)
---
40ish, center of the map (divide).  50+, the bog and mire (east side)
---
I have the same weapon, was thinking of priming also
---
I usually have to do it 3 times, sometimes 5. My worst problem right now. üôÅ
---
And when some one goes afk on a vending machine or on mumbles? You get like 10 rads a second from the nuke mine... just walk away
---
Considering private servers are closed servers and not private, you probably just had bad luck and end up in a server where somebody already took them.
---
You want the Nuclear Winter rewards?
---
Play Nuclear Winter.

Wow thanks, I‚Äôll give it a try üëçüèª

User does get rads. Your wrong

Harper's ferry, the house with several display cases

I sell them constantly for 100 caps. And I've sometimes offered them for free to whoever launched the nuke.

There's a youtube video of a route to run to hit all the spawn points for them. Just do a quick search. It helped immensely for me. (From memory) Harper's ferry, train car west of watoga, the station west from the train car, and general's steak house can spawn them in.
---
Anything workshop related is pvp, how is this so hard to learn.
---
This comment just got better and better!
---
Good to know!  I love it.  One of my mates deleted his when he remade his camp and was asking about it.  He will be bumbed out for sure.
---
The people selling them at that price are not interested in nukes.
---
I got lucky once and found 10 for 25 caps each.
---
I was in the asylum the other day and had to logout because even with moving around and changing floors I couldn't get it to work.
---
OP, note that I already PSA'd this exploit a month ago:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
***PSA: Watch out for a-hole exploiters using Plague Walker + Nuka Mines to kill you &amp; steal your junk while vending!***

I highly suggest 'appearing offline' if playing on console such as Xbox so griefers cannot follow you around on servers. I also suggest frequent server hops including jumping to your own server if you're a Fallout 1st member to split up your routines and questing on both public and private. That is, don't linger on the same server too long to prevent getting targeted. Also, consider disguising the fact that you're a Fallout 1st member if you feel like you're being targeted. This means not using the "1st" player icon and having your scrap box out in plain sight. Make freqent drops into your scrap box so you're not carrying a ton of junk around. Lastly, never take an unsolicited invite from a random player. This is a sad prevention measure but it's certainly one to exercise until this type of griefing can be squashed out. 
---
Edit to add: Fallout 1st members especially those rocking the "1st" player icon with pride: Be sure to be on alert while shopping at vendors with bases and vending machines positioned over a hanging cliff or bases with long drops from high elevation. Particularly any bases up high with the owners hanging out. If the griefing owners don't already have the traps built into the base to grief you with a fall to your death, they will remove the floor from underneath your feet while you're shopping so you do tumble. I had this happen to me a few times but NBD b/c I wasn't carrying any junk. Be aware!
---
I understand that they may have added it to avoid people running away from a fight their about to lose but I've had it happen to me even when im not in combat it is pretty stupid
---
Honestly if someone is selling them for that much odds are they have never launched a nuke or are too new to understand that nuke cards really aren't worth anything.
---
I know I've found marine armor, pretty sure the limbs in the two plan spawn locations in Harper's Ferry. Fast travel, left down the stairs toward the building, through the hole in the wall. One in the display right in front of you. Then go out the door in front of you, go right, then into the red train car. Hop back into the building, up the stairs then onto a plank path to the next floor, halfway up, drop off and there will be a small square display case with another plan.
---
I'd like to see a few more roof options entirely, but speaking of ceilings/floors i really wish the half or quarter sized floors would take the flooring upgrades.
---
This'll be a problem for ceilings too if you use floor pieces for your second floor, anything that's not the base square isn't going to be able to have a flooring/wallpaper type texture put on it the way they're currently doing it.
---
I don‚Äôt mind launching at all. I try and show all how to run silos so I can take of loose ends but I do need cards every so often. 300+ caps. Come on.
---
Oh? I hope so. Need to try today. :)
---
No never
---
I got mine from the top of the world next to all the armour benches are the spawn points just keep sever hopping if it's other plans there but don't pick them up or it will be 20 hours before they spawn again
---
I even heard sometimes the bottlecaps sound and yet no fast travel.
---
14
---
Im sure it will be fixed right after the stranglers acid effect.
---
That‚Äôs what I am talking about!  I give armor and weapons away all the time so mankind can get stronger.
---
It is nice for resource gathering and workshops, as well as a safer way to do solo transfers between characters.  Not sure that alone is worth the cost, the other benefits are nice though.  I still play 90% of the time on adventure mode, even as a solo player I find the private world too empty and lonely.
---
Omg so I'm NOT crazy in trying to use every machine like in FO4!
---

---
Our current scheduled times for trains are longer than usual. Thank you for choosing Watoga rail services.
---
We have a winner!
---
Depends on how you value your money. I play 50/50 public/private. If I'm wanting to do events that need people or looking for vending, obviously public. The significantly less laggy experience on private is amazing, but truly makes me upset with Bethesda that they cannot provide that experience for everyone on a public server.
---
Yeah, well it‚Äôs only a single downvote at least, plus I‚Äôve only seen about 3 in my time so you‚Äôre very correct on the rare part lol
---
Only you can really decide that.
---
I play solo 99% of the time, but player vendors, player nukes, and help when doing the SBQ is too valuable to just play completly alone on private servers.
---
My anti-SB weapon is a executioner gauss rifle with +50% crit shot + crit meter fills faster
---
combination of the 2 critical effects is amazing, it takes 3 shots to fill the crit meter, and with 13 agility I can shoot 6 consecutive shots in vats. This means if I already have the crit meter filled, I can hit 2 crit shots in a single vats use, dealing tons of damage to a scorchbeast or anything that is at some distance
---
People are downvoting this, but at this rate, i wouldnt put it past Bethesda
---
Mine went missing too
---
I say it‚Äôs worth it. The extra atoms each month and the unlimited scrap box are nice. 
---
Only time I go to public worlds is when my characters are full of caps and I need to spend them at other players vendor shops. 
---
I have a few people I team up with to do SBQ and other events in private.
---
lol
---
Seems like it would be a good idea to take on the SBQ.
---
You don‚Äôt buy anything from player vendors?
---
I can confirm this works with ghouls at the Whitespring.
---
Thanks for that. :) It went missing in action after I put it in my stash, very weird
---
I‚Äôve got a classical radio on my shop which I turn on when I‚Äôm modding for folks, but I turned the pip boy Appalachia radio station on yesterday (while I was farming mirrors‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask) for the first time...apparently since NW hit and was like: ‚ÄúIs that Johnny Cash?...eww that‚Äôs not Johnny Cash.‚Äù  
---
If they‚Äôd saved the money it cost to have a beach boys Song‚Äîthat absolutely is fantastic, but still completely out of place in the Fallout universe‚Äînot to mention ‚Äúmeh‚Äù versions of John Denver and The Mr. Cash, perhaps the could have afforded more of a selection.
---
As for the classical, they made some good additions, and and more than a few horrible subtractions, but nothing I‚Äôm running to iTunes to add to my playlist.
---
Okay rude but thanks
---
You really don't want an instigating gatling. The damage you get for double on the first shot really isn't worth it.
---
I don't launch often enough to need to farm them, just letting you know how to get a bunch easily.
---
Ahh fellow shire folk. I wont ask where you are from but you can see how something like this, if converted into an irl house, would defo fit round the area.
---
I did this once... in Fallout 4
---
Is there any way to check these? A thread or in a website or something like that?
---
How high of damage output are you able to get currently?
---
It must be said that these are not private servers. They are private instances. Anyone on your friends list can join them, making them less than private, and unlike an actual private server, that would allow you to do modding, or to only whitelist anyone you are alright with joining, these are super limited. The worth comes from if you feel this is in any way worth your money, and if it will do anything more for you than just playing solo on the normal game.
---
I was kinda joking. I get bored if I'm alone. I've made several pretty good friends from this game. I don't use the private servers much.
---
It might not have been the same thing I was referring to, but just keep your eye out for something odd... like a mobs "attack" or "status" being on the corpse as an item.  Those kind of rare oddities some people will pay a lot of caps for or they'll trade stuff for them.   I had a number of those oddities from early in the game when some glitched mobs would die with weird things on them.  I ended up scrapping them and much later on finding out that some nuts out there will pay through for the nose for the odd trash items that aren't really supposed to be there.
---
Yeah it fits perfectly but i didnt buy fallout 76 to play BR and it doesnt make sense to wind them together but it is how it is.
---
Can't run a productive shop without customers...For which you need a public server. You know, filled with the general public. The people who buy your stuff??? You might be able to hide from all the unpleasant people, but say good by to your business if you care about that at all...
---
As some people already said, there's only a chance magazines/bobbleheads will spawn in potential places. I had near-supernaturally bad luck on that end when I started; RNG has just been giving you some bad rolls.
---
I was too busy collecting Ranger Hats. I now have a lot of Ranger Hats. Some might say, too many...
---
I came across a vendor where the player had ~10 for sale at $250 each.  I figured he's probably duped them.
---
Selling them in the vendor kindof defeats the purpose tho?  Isn't the point of getting the pie actually GETTING the pie from the machine, not just buying it from somebody else?
---
Where can you find the Green Hood?
---
I have a older African American character myself, doing what he can to build a mercantile to help other passing travelers, which paralleled him working the family business of the Super Duper Mart back in Lexington, where he was born and raised. He talks to himself out loud sometimes, but that's mostly because he's a lonely type of fellow, who sadly lost his wife and son back when the bombs fell.  
---
I've been plotting the idea of a Chinese Remnant character lately, although I don't think I have much of a backstory on him just yet. I do know I'm waiting for the Atom Shop to release a few things first...
---
Cool. I do farm them when I have time but I launch like a mad man. Most nights we do 10 or so and weekends are insane. So much easier to buy from PV.
---
How come you prefer junkies? Bloodied is much more powerful and also benefits from adrenal reaction and nerd rage.
---
If you've got enough people, you can get quite a few pretty quickly. I usually get by on the few I stumble across.
---
the nuka PA,and the entrance to vault 79,as well as many terminal entries related to the lore of FO76
---
For PvE, bloodied melee (specifically meat hooks because they benefit from the gladiator and iron fist perks as well as twisted muscles and talons mutations) can output just INSANE damage once you stack all the various food booze and chem buffs.
---
For pvp, stealth commando has ruled the roost for a long time. Ffr handmades and Teslas, stealth boys. 
---
Personally, heavy weapons have always been the fallout experience so I use those a lot. Even run power armor a good bit.
---
Question. do you have multiple hardrives?
---
 I have found that most launcher based downloaders suffer from the same issue. If you want to install a 70gb game to your D: drive which has 500GB free space, but your C: Drive only has 30gb of room, the game will refuse to install until the C: drive has enough room for the download even if it is not the file location you are using. If that is the case free up some room and try again!
---
If not sorry :(
---
I agree with this, just stick to Bloodied, picking one up should be relatively cheap until you add FFR or explosive on to it.
---
I have a BE and a BFFR handmade and they shred everything.
---
All Fallout games have some kind of cut guns, armor, and quests. Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4 all had unfinished  stuff in them because the developers thought they weren't important. Also these could be added later, the Exotic Weapons perk card had a bow on them so they are probably releasing is later.
---
My prose must need some polish because I meant the exact opposite.
---
Fallout flavoured BR is the game mode that no one wanted - and as usual Yahtzee eerily predicted six months prior to release - and to add insult to injury those who get to play the game mode that no one wanted think that playing it is not its own reward and they need a recompense for their efforts.
---
Because logic has forsaken this land.
---
J works with adrenal reaction and need rage as well. I don't like running around with 7 hp, is all.
---
Which plan?
---
People kill themselves all the time doing this. You should stop acting like you know more than the people who do that stuff. Come on, man. Take a seat.
---
yeah and there's really no special attribute about it. i mean, i've also seen people selling technical documents junk &amp; the "you've been insulted" papers for 10k, probably preying on people who don't know what they are or their purpose but to each their own on the easy come up/duping people who don't know any better
---
It probably depends on where you are at.  I have a CAMP by white springs train station, and I see people griefing regularly.  I've since put most everything except my merchants underground.  If I hear the bass play, I have a few moments to see if it's somebody I should trust or not.  I also have it down 4 layers, which avoids any nuke damage.
---
I wish we had a gamer karma site where you could post ID's for players who have griefed, or also been cool.  I know Xbox has it builtin, but I'm PS4.
---
Thank you! Does the meat hook benefit these perk intentionally? Or was it one of those silly oversights? The stealth commando seems like a good way to play. What kind of perks and gear would i be looking for? Should i be walking around bloody as well?
---
Imho, people who pay heavily for junk, wont read this.  I dont know much about costume prices, but I do know to check the market prices before I blow 20k on pie.
---
I sell mine for 250 each and had someone clean me out of the 20 I had last weekend.
---
I always thought I was at the border of being too much but it paid off this time.
---
There's a huge map to explore with a ton of lore. I've played solo since the Beta and I'm still finding new stuff. I enjoy the building a lot. There's less variety in the things you can make (no Junk Walls for example), but now you can build in almost any location, (aside from any place that's a fast travel point) and incorporate existing structures into your bases. I loved Fallout 4 and get a lot of fun out of 76.
---
You could do the Hangover tour, which would include ditching all OP gear getting wasted on nukashine then waking up defenseless and forced to travel back to camp by foot.
---
Because workshops are not called "PVP Arenas." they have multiple purposes.  The problem is immature children (even at mind) think they are ONLY for PvP, and justify any PvP with a blathering "You agreed to it by taking the workshop!!!"
---
Thanks so much for the offer!  Fortunately I just found it in someone's vendor, so now I'm happy :)
---
Man. Today's been pretty Not Great, but something about the pleasant domesticity of this comment really made me feel warm. Happy thoughts.
---
But I tested this myself. You can throw a nuke mine at someone, and sprint away before getting hit by the explosion or the rads at all....
---
Plasma grenade plan
---
That quest line takes a number of steps to get and is pretty obscure unless you know where to look, so with that you're likely dealing with players that don't know about it or don't want to be bothered.
---
Ah I did not realize that was what dropped.
---
It is passive
---
You can use all the crafting stations, except the brewing one, and you can use the stash box.   The water purifiers and junk extractors are mine.  I use the stuff that I get from them.   Nothing worse than planning on going to craft a bunch of chems and sell them for caps to find that all the purified water is taken already.   There is a water pump with a handle.  If you're thirsty, I suggest you use it.  There is a pond about 30 seconds away from my camp.   You can use that too if you don't mind Mirelurk flavored water.
---
You can make some caps buying the lemonade plans and selling them at a higher price than you pay for them. It's one of the more common random encounters.
---
They are all former BoS members though. They have been there long before you
---
I am a junkies explosive heavy gunner and have a Junkies Explosive version of every ballistic gun, a junkies FFR version of every energy gun, and a Junkies version of every "explosive" gun (grenade launcher, etc) and will echo without a doubt the best of the bunch is my Junkies Explosive .50 cal. but will disagree as the runner up is the gatling gun. It does more than my sneak commando with a handmade per shot, and is by far the most ammo efficient gun in the game. 5mm bullets are created en mass and you burn through them slowly with powerful hits. Actually these guns are second only to the AAE gatling plasma, but that's a different story! Junkies Heavy Gunner makes my sneak full health commando feel hilariously weak.
---
No such thing.
---
will do appreciate the insight :)
---
I'd put a lot of points into strength. Melee is very powerful and you'll be able to carry more. I maxed out on strength early on and never regretted it.
---
Nuclear Winter is fun tho. Im no pvp ace but I have a good time with it. The double XP weekends are crucial to piling up the overseer ranks, I went from 46-60 during the last one and didn't even play Sunday and Monday morning.
---
blocker has nothing to do with blocking ...oddly enough
---
I actually still haven't received anything even tho i lost everything and wrote a ticket, am i the only one ??
---
yes , there is still tapes and notes to be found as f0 3/4 , but generally dont lead any where.
---
some clever, some not so much. Biggest disappointment, for me, there is no story line, no interactions and no choises to make, apart from a few quests , its all events. something more akin to 'selltlement under attack...' but, thats the restrictions of an online game.Whats player no 100 going to do , if you've already blown up the institute.
---
(I'm 850 hrs in, by the way). like fo4. on survival, you must eat and drink,and a good idea to sleep.
---
Private servers are not re-used.  #fakenews from the haters 8D

Hello! We're investigating bugs affecting Fast Travel right now. One of them, which can prevent you from Fast Traveling to your CAMP (or other players' CAMPS) is planned to be fixed with the upcoming Wastelanders update. There are a couple others fixes being looked into as well, but I don't have additional details to share on those right now. Will let you know as soon as I hear an update.
---
They were previous employees.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be at 7 hp, you can stick to 19%. You‚Äôll get all the bonuses and won‚Äôt be wet cardboard. But I suppose I can see how more health would be nice.
---
As far as rewards go, I'm pretty pleased with some of them. The outcast PA paint rules and some of the weapons skins are dope too. Worth playing the mode imo. It's more fun to me than grinding atoms challenges in adventure for similar rewards.
---
Try using Rad-X if you have mutations, i find the road trips more immersive if you do it with suppressed mutations

Only tried with one armor piece - the dr did climb during night time but did not go below base value during daytime, unlike nocturnal weapons.
---
I prefer FFR on 50cal actually. Explosive Gat plasma is powerful, no doubt, but just not my cup of tea.
---
It's called Green Thumb.
---
Did you download the Bethesda launcher?
---
There's a ton of holotapes.  Lots of lore.  Some secrets/easter eggs that are still up for discussion in the community (the mysterious faces at Watoga and elsewhere, for example).
---
Co-op isn't necessary for *most* of the content, but there are some things that will be very challenging without help and at least one minor thing that is literally impossible without someone else.
---
A couple of caveats about the Lore &amp; Explore here:  Some of the lore feels unfinished.  There's a "let them figure it out for themselves" approach that the game takes, which is fine.  A lot of people have come away feeling like there's NO story, but that's just because they didn't actually read terminals or listen to holotapes.  However, sometimes I get the sense that there's nothing to figure out, because it's incomplete (like the thread here the other day about the mystery to solve).  And also if you look at the locations where Events are triggered, the lore tends to be very scant there.  It's like Bethesda decided a location would either have lore/goodies or an Event, but rarely both.
---
But overall, if you liked the other games you may like this one.  The co-op/online thing is not as intrusive as you may fear.  Most people either ignore you or are cool.
---
They just need to bring survival servers back so the PvP dickheads that refuse to run NW because ThEy DoN't HaVe ThEiR BuIlDs can go back to farming each other.
---
Im PS4 too. I'm not saying there arent assholes, just I didnt realise it had become this big of a thing. I remember the early days when everyone was kind lol
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patches
---
As much as there are comments in this post.
---
You don't even need to stack the food buffs. With the proper mutations and a bloodied meathook/monster, I'm easily hitting for 2K every regular hit, which is more than enough to take down everything the game throws at you, sans Scorchbeast Queen.
---
We're looking into a couple of bugs affecting Fast Travel for a future update. I've encountered the one with the countdown timer mentioned by OP and agree it's definitely frustrating! I've passed reports of this to the dev team, and as soon as I hear an update I will let you know.

I roleplay, bit technically any player playing a character is playing a PC (player character)
---
Just a tiny nitpick.
---
As far as interaction goes it is hard to even get people to use their mic let alone RP with you.
---
7 was a random number, 19% hp is still out of my comfort zone, and is pain in the ass to maintain if you get over-radded or whatever. Again - these bonuses give me next to nothing in the bottom line. Would I spend one-two less bullets to kill something - maybe. Do I care - not in the slightest.
---
Man I am amazed that an Enclave officer in this game avoids mutations but almost everyone running around claiming to be BoS is mutated to all hell and gone.
---
Kudos to you! I am also mutation free, no sense in preserving all that human technology if we don't remain human.
---
Here‚Äôs your video. I hit the trifecta on the second video. Fast travel was unresponsive, I was hidden, and it auto canceled my fast travel all in one video. [Video](https://youtu.be/VCRbmJHZ0qU)
---
The map is 4 times the size of fallout 4s with lots of of places to explore. There's probably more notes and holotapes then all of the other games combined due to the absence of human NPCs. The combat is the same as 4 and you can play the entire game on your own except for maybe the final boss. It uses the same building mechanics as 4 except you can build anywhere around the map instead of just workshops.
---
I can almost see us hiding in the uncanny caverns, blind eyes, whispering unholy lines from a burnt comic.
---
Rude. I was told this was the nicest community.
---
Looks great!
---
Don't bother saving weapons/armor that are 5+ levels above you, because you'll probably find something better by the time you level up. Sell them or scrip them instead.
---
Mutations are fun, but don't bother getting any until you have 2 levels of Starched Genes in Luck. I bought Marsupial at like level 30, then accidentally took a Radaway and lost it--bummer!
---
Sleep. Eat cranberry foods. Go to areas with a lot of high level enemies and kill stuff. Rinse, repeat.
---
Some of my favorite XP grinds are One Violent Night, AWOL Armaments, Line in the Sand, Bots on Parade (in the mire or bog),  and Monster Mash. I've also found its fun capturing workshops and doing the defend event building ridiculous monuments, then leaving. Just empty your pockets before you do it in case you come upon a PvPer.

Send in another ticket. Keep replying to their responses until they add the item to your inventory. This may take a while, but hopefully they are able to resolve your issue.

I enjoy taking treks along the railroads on the map. 
---
Probably one of the funnier encounters I had in doing this, on the southern part of the map heading towards the R&amp;G Station, I came upon a group of Super Mutants- nothing out of the ordinary. I started to engage, and then they started running away basically. I was briefly confused before realizing I just got smacked the eff up and lost a bunch of health. There was a Deathclaw behind me.
---
/awkward
---
I got my first several in Fallout 4 and didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing. Since I‚Äôve learned about it being rare I‚Äôve never gotten another.
---
It is absolutely worth it. I am 1100 hours in and I am still finding new things. This game is insanely good if this is your preferred playstyle
---
I have rank 5 demo expert and grenadier perks. The goal was to use tons of grenades and explosions and stuff but I find the explosive damage on heavy weapons vs lesser damage weapons is worth it. For example I'll do 8 explosive damage with a handmade and around 70 per shot on the heavy gunner. I know explosive is retro now but I like it in this case
---
PLANS: Chemistry workbench, Tinker's workbench, Single action revolver ivory grip, Mr. Handy buzz blade, Mole Miner gauntlet...
---
These are all worthless. Don't even pick them up.
---
Wait, to block the doorway? That‚Äôs brilliant!
---
This is GREAT. I‚Äôm on my 5th character and finally exploring heavy weapons so timing is perfect! Thanks for sharing your experiences!

If you are on PC I believe I have an extra B gatling gun for cheap
---
You seem really butthurt about people liking a mode that you don't like.
---
The people playing NW along with me, seem to discredit your opinions.
---
Use a headset. The game is vastly more fun when you can talk to team members and random strangers. Seriously, they're $30. Just go buy one.

They were merely asking a simple question. No need to be a snooty little fuck. If you don't appreciate it, downvote the post and move on.

I play a black Brotherhood Special ops person.

He survived the vault and the bomb drop in vault 76. he was born from veronica from fallout NV.... before she died she told him to make the most of his new life.... 
---
And now he is here in fallout76
---
I was merely answering their question.  No need to come at me like this.  If you don't appreciate my post, downvote it and move on.
---
Actually I do this because I use a 50. Cal which eats steel
---
There is a static spawn on top of west tek that is rarely taken he probably goes up there.
---
It's honestly great for any build.
---
I've found both magazines and bobbleheads in my private world.
---
The NW rewards are tied directly to NW progress. They are unlocks in the Atom shop, so they are account wide rewards, and are available for all characters.
---
I am not a BR player, but enjoy the heck out of NW. My suggestion would be to make a NW specific character, so you won't be trying to shoehorn NW perks into your Adv builds. You do earn Adv XP, and caps from NW play, so it's a fairly decent way to farm extra caps for your main characters. I've made 50k+ caps on my NW character, that I transfer to my Adv toons.
---
It's probably a lot to do with how the only people playing rn are the ones VERY invested in the game, so they probably see anything negative as bad, even if it's as simple as telling people they don't have to play the game when theres really nothing to do.
---
No there is lore in the game but it is bastardised and ruined the game is just a theme park version of a fallout game as things like the brotherhood, super mutants and deathclaws have been thrown in with no consideration of the existing lore
---
This is like the 3rd posting on this.

I have an auto quad Tesla rifle with VATS and even without FFR it‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous weapon.   I run an auto rifle build so it‚Äôs a good niche weapon for me- not unlike the railway or combat rifle. 
---
My ‚Äúgo to‚Äù weapons are still my several auto legendary handmades, but I do enjoy mixing things up at times.
---
U kidding me 25k?
---
What I have learned is that if you get this once, move over a few steps until you are standing on a difference surface.  This seems to work every time for me.  PC 
---
You dont have to change areas or go too far at all, just stand on something else.
---
Uh, its more like you arent a solid object while an animation is playing on you.
---
Bloodied is unmatched damage, and also the low health buffs like adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage perk are substantial. Nothing else comes close. It can get kind of tiresome managing a low health build, especially against ghoul hordes. So it kind of depends what you want from the game. 
---
As for the meat hook being a bug or a feature, I have no idea. 
---
Are you familiar with Nukes and dragons? It has a character builder that is invaluable, give it a Google if you haven't.
---
Just avoid lights, crops, turrets, cows, walls and roofs and you're grand
---
Marine Tactical Helmet is much better for this method! You get around 29c per helmet. 1 Glass, 1 Plastic &amp; 3 Rubber.
---
As said, Harpers Ferry display cases, but there's also a reliable spawn in the red rail car just west of Watoga on the tracks. It's worth always checking there too, because it reliably spawn marine underarmor/armor plans. It spawns inside the railcar, on top of a wooden crate next to the skeleton, but it's wonky. Always check the top of the crate, even if nothing is visible, it sometimes spawns vertically, and it can be hard to see.
---
Private worlds, are **exactly** the same as public, just with less people. The same respawn timers, the same spawn chances, the only difference, is you don't have to worry about some rando getting there before you.
---
25% off at the purveyor I think
---
Everyone should carry an underpowered tagging weapon. 10mm pistols are great for this.
---
The exploration side of it is probably my favourite facet of the game overall.  
---
Everyone's dead and you're basically left finding out why. Not simply the bombs, but what came after. "The end of the world" is hardly an ending, really, so you're finding survivor stories, cults, pre-war records of shady dealings and questionable actions.  
---
It's a necropsy in text.  
---
And that's without getting into Bethesda's strong suit of environmental storytelling. Finding blocks to denote where children were, bones half buried, or even the sickly and irradiated in places they likely never should've been; it's pretty intriguing.  
---
Honestly, it's very much like an old PC adventure game in a lot of ways.
---
Damn you got me beat, 7. New game idea, you have to drink every time you get FT denied
---
I haven't logged on in almost 9 months but going to tonight to try this out.  I was melee based but was transitioning to heavy weapons when I quit.
---
So, lately in the past few months, selling acid for me has been a boon. I feel like I've sold enough acid to make the 60's and 70's blush. And I keep raising my price just to see where the line is drawn. Gradual process but people seem to jump on that pretty quick. 
---
I'm pretty OCD when it comes to looting so I am always having a ton of resources to sell. So, maybe that in itself, loot like there's no tomorrow.
---
Glad you liked it, enjoy)

What's the number for PETA? Asking for a friend, that needs to make a call.
---
Yes, pretty sure it is. I do recall reading that a purveyor sale was happening and these dates do ring a bell.
---
I have an instigating explosive gatling gun and it can 1shot pretty much anything in the game short of bosses, if I get a headshot. That and when a crowd of ghouls come running I can spray the ground and cripple their legs so it is great for crowd control too. It is my most used gun, which is a shame because I hate how it looks.
---
You put all nine gunslinger points, plus three points in sneak and three in covert ops or White Knight. Shadowed ultralight combat or leather armor and you are practically invisible whatever the light. 
---
Unique chest armor "Stand Fast" makes a noticeable difference. Enemies bump into you.
---
Of course, some people wear unyielding for those extra 15 agility points. Unnecessary, but cool.
---
I have a BFFR gatling that can 5 shot lvl 50 scorched beasts, I'd say theyre pretty good
---
Eleven.  That's after three failed attempts, trying to find a mob anywhere with berry mentats and running around like a dipshit, then trying again.

---
Especially nice at SQB fights with all those damn ground critters in the tall grass Nippin at you
---
That is flexible medieval in my opinion. My medieval character was far more strict.
---
There are multiple queen killing groups
---
What did you do to make it more strict?
---
Some people don't like low health builds. It took me awhile to join the darkside, it is a pretty big commitment compared to many other playstyles.
---
well there's a link from the launcher, or you can goto the offical fallout.com
---
Yep, I rocked a primed Z2525 for SQB fights for a while, great weapon situationally.
---
Hm, I do pvp with heavies and still don't use Lock'n'Load - doesn't work on Harpoons and is not really needed for most heavies sans LMGs, due to those humungous magazines. Also by not using PA + Stabilized you're robbing yourself of 30% extra damage and much, much tighter accuracy...  
---
But since this game allows for so many fun ways to shoot stuff, I'd just say go for whatever works best for you.
---
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don't teach a man how to fish and you feed yourself.
---
He's a grown man. Fishing isn't that hard.
---
Thats doeamt sound half bad.
---
loads of lore from holotapes, notes, and terminals. anyone who says this game has no story either never actually played it, or is one of those "shoot, loot, move on to next quest marker" types. while it is true most stories end in the writer's eventual death, given 76 starts off empty, that doesn't mean the stories themselves aren't interesting.
---
if you do get the game, look into the "mistress of mystery" questline. that's a real good time.
---
I agree she shouldnt reset upon death if a solo player is trying to kill her.....but may i ask why you're trying to kill her with a switchblade? (Not trying to be a dick just genuinely curious)
---
Somewhere with firecaps too would be ideal. We'll get a whole Fallout set in our neck of the woods one day, I'm hopeful.
---
Metal Helmet exists and has a set spawn point north of Vault 76
---
Combat Helmet has a set spawn point in various locations and is not rare at all
---
Enclave Mask is ***NOT*** a Legacy item nor is it becoming one. It drops rarely from Enclave Events and you still get one at the end of their introductory quest. 
---
Robot Helmets and the Marine Tactical Helmet can be crafted
---
The only armor sets that don't have headgear but have headgear are Wood Armor (Wood Mask) and Trapper Armor (Lobster Trap Helmet).
---
Nice, but you are messing up the vendor bot spawn...
---
Bragging rights and because it‚Äôs fun as hell. I‚Äôve done it before in a team being the only player to hit her. I can dial up to almost 1,300 damage per swing with a BSS Switchblade I use. More if I truly went crazy with a food chem build. Or even if I took out blocker and barbarian and added max level gladiator cards
---
7.
---
Have had the same thing happen. She won't land, and if I die her health regenerates. I am going to try a cryolator when she lands to see if she will stay on the ground
---
I think it only works as long as you keep firing it. Which would suck. Then again veto grenades exist too
---
I hope this changes in the future, It's most painful thing in the world when you just want to solo her and suddenly you die randomly and she regains all her Hp.
---
Lol a little but Butthesda have said it somewhere that these items won't go so I'd be surprised if it disappeared üòÇ
---
yea this is my first out of all the fallout games ive played. I out mine on dislplay as well!
---
It doesn‚Äôt, at least not for me. I‚Äôve soloed the queen quite a few times since the private servers came out and I‚Äôve died a few times during the fights from bugs. Every time her health was the same. Sounds like a new bug maybe.
---
This. The tent is convenient, but workbenches are common enough that it's not necessary, plus it won't scrap armor and weapons which limits its usefulness. The scrapbox is literally a game changer and should be available to everyone.
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you! I found it :)
---
There's no 'undead' in Fallout. Ghouls are highly-irradiated living humans.
---
wow really?! dang!! awesome. I always have fresh grilled radstag lol. carry weight!
---
Strangler heart PA going missing (after months of grind), junk going missing from premium unlimited stash box, people's characters getting deleted after V94 raids, private servers being pillaged and not being private... these are all things that were not meant to happen also haha!
---
It was in the update notes. They did that to keep people from jumping through the door. What ever that means. ü§î
---
It‚Äôs been this way since beta and it exists across all legendaries. If you die in an area and no other players are near enough to the area of effect then all enemies will regen to full health. It‚Äôs an attempt to keep low level players in lower leveled areas
---
Yes. It's more prevalent after the latest update. Before,  she didn't regenerate and would land once in a while. Now she flies around endlessly and if you die,  her health rests.
---
Yeh that's what i'll do... do you get the packages on every character that lost stuff or only your active one ?
---
Is there any link with the brotherhood at thunder mountain power plant? That's on the on the shore of the reservoir feeding this isn't it? Enemies are always getting stuck under the map there, maybe they're getting stuck in some type of undiscovered tunnels or chamber under there.
---
I have 6 atm in display cases with my holotape games :D
---
I haven‚Äôt heard anything but it would make sense for it to change from ‚Äúother players‚Äù to ‚Äúhumans‚Äù since we have weapons that hurt all other creature types specifically...for the most part anyway
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Ah, haven't really been looking through the patchnotes lately. Also haven't checked if any of the other vaults have this either.
---
I wouldn't mind it so much,  but the 25 minutes of waiting for her to land is getting old. Something broke in the last update,  because she would at least occasionally land and say hello. Now it's just sit and watch her fly in circles.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured as well- but just because it makes sense doesn‚Äôt mean Bethesda is going to do it.
---
Don‚Äôt forget when she lands then IMMEDIATELY takes back off. Must‚Äôve left the stove on
---
&gt;Seems like more magazines drop when there are more people in a server.
---
This is absolutely the case. Every time someone enters an area, the game rolls for a chance to spawn certain nearby world items, some as low as 10%. So, the more people who enter the area without picking things up, the more likely you are to find them. Magazines have a 20% spawn chance.  Here's a list I compiled with more chances for various items: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dphwyz/datamined_list_of_world_items_with_limited_spawn
---
End game.  I am right there with you. It's about all there is left to do.
---
DAMN..first try?! I can't tell you hoe many times ai've tried for this pre-war delicacy. Just glad I was able to get atleast one. Hopofully another. Now i kind of want the new thanksgiving display hutch cuz it would look awesome. not sure yet though
---
If I start a third character, I plan on having him be a black male.
---
Guys got the short end of the stick with hairstyles though.  I really want him to have dreadlocks like Richard Sherman, but the only vaguely long-haired option doesn't look right.  There isn't even an option similar to Ulysses in New Vegas.
---
I'm going put on display with a note beside it lol.
---
I would love to be able to use chains. Like, a chain. Double Dragon style.
---
The little tick filled shack near Harper's ferry, ontop of the tv. Had the arms and legs spawn there yesterday while farming ticks, didn't grab either sorry.
---
You talking about that one crackpot on Facebook claiming it‚Äôs getting a buff to 30%? 
---
If so he has no idea what he‚Äôs talking about lol.
---
Besides that, assassins isn‚Äôt damage to ‚Äúhumans‚Äù but specifically to ‚Äúother players‚Äù suggesting it will be incompatible with human NPCs.
---
With that said, assassins really could use a major buff, it should be the main PvP meta prefix, it literally makes the most sense for it to be this way and would allow a lot more flexibility for individual builds, it already is the meta for armor as is and also it would also make sense for the effect to work against human NPCs and I personally would be all for it.
---
But remember just cause one guy has his theories doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs credible, if we get something from the data miners suggesting this, then I‚Äôd take it more seriously.
---
Yeah. That's fun too. Or gets fixated on Deezer in the nuke and never leaves the rads. I hate that lemonade vendor.
---
I put it on display with a note that says "pie from machine" lol.
---
All they say is...
---
"Vault 51:¬†Players can no longer jump into the Vault 51 door in Adventure Mode."

I tried to find a video, but I still don't know what was happening üòÇ

---
Some of us know about this trick but don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt want to sit around in the same building for 24 minutes. For me, and I assume many others, farming isn‚Äôt fun. Sure, you get more stuff, but I don‚Äôt care about more stuff if I‚Äôm not having fun. 
---
Some of us prefer the serendipity of stumbling across cool stuff than using loopholes.
---
yea. i definitely like the bug. ive never found anything from googling it so i figured id post to see if anyone else has had the bug.
---
Try clearing out the dust and/or debris in your Pip-Boy, it‚Äôs probably interfering with the targeting system like always. Keeping your Pip-Boy clean is a must have, I even found a tooth in my holotape player once.
---
hahaha awesome!!
---
Marine also doesn‚Äôt have its gas mask looking one it only has the stealth one
---
My ffr blodied gatling gun is super underated. There is nothing in the game short of SBQ that takes more than 3 bullets. With how cheap 5mm is, this is unbeatable to me.
---
I might try the lock and load thing out, I've one rank of it as I use bear arms thanks to lugging around 5 heavy guns. I think dropping bandolier would be much more manageable as I only carry about 25k rounds at a time.
---
I actually found a Mutants Expoosive 50 cal with faster reload the other week at a vendor (3000 or 5000 caps, one or the other) and the reload with speed demon is very noticeable compared to my Vampire 50 cal.
---
i put mine on display as well!
---
By definition it is
---
me too lol!
---
I think there is a bit of tension from people tired of posts constantly asking versions of "Hey, is this super big piece of sh*t, dumpster fire of a greedy awful game that you are an idiot for enjoying finally fixed to MY specific requirements?" (Not saying this exact post is that, but there are a lot posts with that) We get it, some people aren't happy, flame posting every few minutes isn't going to help
---
Same here ...
---
You are correct sir! Shall the pie be with you!!
---
very nice!
---
I can agree with this.  Her health should be a constant for the duration of the event, not arbitrarily reset because no one is participating.
---
lol display is more like it!
---
Kinda like the real west virginia tbh
---
Guess I'll be the dissenting voice on this one.
---
You die, your health regenerates.   Seems only fair that the Queen gets to regenerate too.  
---
Impostor Sheep should get the same treatment.  Seems silly people go and 'solo' it by dieing 20 times.
---
The entitlement in this post is ridiculous. It's standard practice to ask for proof of purchase, especially when it's regarding something of $100 value. Instead of being civil and letting the guy do his job you start raging and posting to social media. Is your name Karen by chance?
---
I see nothing that discredits my opinion. The fact that you enjoy vanilla ice cream doesn't change the fact that vanilla ice cream added to beef stroganoff is a poor choice.
---
No one asked for or wanted a BR mode. The fact that some people may have warmed up to it does not invalidate the previous statement.
---
Nor it makes it less ill fitting for a franchise that made its name - and its player base - with RPGs.
---
I am sure as I originally said that if CoD gets a tack-on RTS game mode some people may enjoy it, it may even sway some RTS fans to play it, but that doesn't mean that for the vast majority of CoD players will be something that they neither wanted nor they asked for.
---
Yea that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm referring to as the Assault Helmet, you can only craft the wetsuit helmet
---
Right because 35,000 health being whittled away is the same as 200 health getting whacked away
---
I didn't actually understand this until about a week ago, 800 hours in, always saw blocker and said, "Meh, I'm not melee" and moved on without reading it. It really is great for any build
---
I'm glad you asked. Now it'll have to be part of my berserker build.
---
Been trying ever since lol
---
Shall the pie be with you!!!
---
Yup, it's good for rifleman too who never use melee. Stacks great with Dodgy as well.
---
I WANT PIE!!
---
I don't have your kind of persistence. Cheers.
---
I dunno, I've always had this happen on PS4.  Here's a video of me [getting ganked by a 4th floor boss glowing one a year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tTbspStKVg).  Uploaded it 12/4/18, but pretty sure I filmed it the first week of release.
---
 I log out and relog and I remember doing a fix that was either fast traveling somewhere close or to my camp

All of the guards are attending the Grafton Day parade, again!
---
They really need to add a global text chat and global vendor browser/search. Then if someone finds something at your vendor they can request a temp join on your server to shop, maybe optimally forcing they leave after leaving the camp boundaries. They need something better than simply making everyone choose between vending or using the private mode.
---
It's being downvoted because the poster is misunderstanding what's happening. Nobody feels 'forced' to play a video game, that's silly. There is only the DESIRE to play a game more, to find new ways of having fun with it, and that's what Shia is talking about. Making the most of what is a pretty large game map.
---
Vendor bots desperately need that crystal in exchange for caps.
---
Too true, by the by, everything has stuck around after subscription is cancelled so broad as it's long, for once they were true to their word.
---
Caps are never an issue
---
Thank you for the continued reports on the Strangler Heart issue. I know this is one that many of you are eager to have fixed right away. Unfortunately, this is not a simple or fast fix, but we are looking into ways we can address it as soon as we can. However that may not be until our Wastelanders update or an update following that one. Once I hear an update on the status of this bug I'll be sure to let you know.
---

---
 &gt; Thank you for the continued reports on the Strangler Heart issue. I know this is one that many of you are eager to have fixed right away. Unfortunatel...
---
Gotcha
---
I would love it if some how mounts could be added. Such as maybe. Motorcycle, or something like a Gulper, deathclaw, etc. Each of course having its own perks, like they fight or shooting from the saddle. I would love to explore more if it wasnt for how slow it is to get around.
---
Nah, the cryo effect lasts for a while, if you nail her with it pretty good. Switch it to the long range barrel, you can even nail her in the sky, starting the process before she lands. Just keep an eye, she will visually "thaw out", just swap back to cryo and pepper her again.
---
Exactly why I decided to see if anyone could lend any credibility to this claim. Sounds like it‚Äôs pure conjecture. 
---
I think everyone agrees that Bethesda should do something about the effect, but that doesn‚Äôt mean Bethesda will do anything at all.
---
Wrong on both counts. I'm not VERY invested in the game, just started playing semi-regularly again after months of absence. And I don't see anything negative as bad, I'm fine with criticism and have criticized this game a lot. 
---
I downvoted the person you're talking about because their comment is misleading. Nobody feels 'forced' to play a video game, it's possible to be bored with a game and still think there are a lot of ways to have fun with it if you can figure them out. I've been bored with highly praised games in the past so being FO76 has nothing to do with it.
---
More emphasis on what crystal is good for.  ;)
---
I've been to WV, Only there for 2 days though so didn't really notice a lack of black people!
---
Is there an achievement or buff that comes with eating it?
---
I agree with you. Sometimes the community in game is too nice. Running away from danger or having to repair your camp is nice for a change.
---
M. Night Shamalan level developer twist: NPCs have been made to interact with us like we interact with others. Raiders will be raided, griefers will be griefed, and helpful players will be helped. What a twist! Oh, wait, that's just called Karma. Well, just be nice to people.
---
I don't doubt what you're describing is happening to people, but I have never once experienced this bug and I've played for a good 25 hours in the last week.
---
Also considering I keep seeing this brought up and it never really gets more than a few dozen upvotes... I'm going to make a leap here and suggest that it's not as widespread a problem as you think it is. xD
---
My worst was 27 times. I shut the game off. It seems to be average of 4-5 times for me now. Used to be only 1-2 times.
---
Bird bones serum only thing I use crystal for.

I sell meat. Toss on the butchers bounty perk, take a run thru the Mire and Toxic Valley, and you should end up with 1400 caps worth of steaks to sell in no time. Glowing meat steaks sell for an absurd amount, and if you toss on Super Duper while you cook the raw meats you'll pad your totals. I used to take runs at West Tek and other SM homesteads and sell their weapons, but they're just so heavy...I didn't like having to crawl to the train station to sell them off. I already run with Thru Hiker rank 3 anyway, so I find that being my own little wasteland chef is more convenient. Bonus, you get exp for cooking your meats!
---
Man you guys are friggin useless
---
This HOA you're talking about... is it an RP group of players or something? xD
---
If u are using the chameleon mutation it is why I used to get spotted instantly got rid of it an I'm good if u use the chameleon mutation with anything other than weightless it will over ride the chameleon on a armor piece and you will be spotted
---
Like I said, don't doubt the existence of it, game has plenty of bugs. Just doesn't seem like a hot ticket issue right now. 
---
Is it platform specific maybe? I'm on PC.
---
6. Unless you count the 2 missfires that happened. By that, I mean I travelled from Jacks pumpkin house to Watoga, or tried to at a cost of 36 caps I think it was. Something like that. I get sent to Point Pleasant. Wtf?! So, I try again. 40 some caps this time. Sends me to friggin white springs then the game crashes. When I log back in guess where I'm at... Yep. Jacks friggin pumpkin house and down right at 100 caps.
---
Considering that the devs are already aware and working on it according to the Bethesda response, and the amount of player responses, I think it‚Äôs more we‚Äôll known than you‚Äôre aware
---
I have one of these, too, and love it. Big hits to anything. And some people criticize the accuracy, but I think it's easy to get headshots at quite a long distance once you learn to line up the aiming dot and the sight ring. Single shot kills are normal.
---
Go to another vending machine. If a go-to response to waiting is to be violent to someone else, that‚Äôs kinda sad.
---
Thank you, though you had interesting things to say too
---
*laughs in unable to fast travel*
---
I encountered one of those jackasses last night. I was in my CAMP repairing armor, ready to head out and some idiot comes up my stairs, tossing nuke mines at me. I get hit with a burst of radiation, but my decon shower was right next to me and i hop in. No harm, right? He tried again but forgot one important thing: my camp is a treehouse and is about 5 stories up, with no fast travel locations near it. I logged off as he was trying to mess with me. I wish I saw him fall to his death, but all I saw was his bag of loot when I rejoined the server seconds later.
---
I look forward to rolling around in my flux later, making adhesive angels... only then to realise i cannot decant the junk back in my mega box!
---
Being well known doesn't mean being a widespread problem. xD
---
This thread you made is like the third one I've seen in the last week, yet none of the ones I've seen have passed 100 upvotes. You imply that everyone has experienced this bug, and my point is, that's clearly not the case. If it was there would be daily threads getting 1k+ upvotes.
---
I hope they fix it either way of course.
---
Yeah, nothing like trying to make it to an event, only to have it complete before you can travel, or not enough time to start project paradise. If this happens after I‚Äôve done all my preparation for the fight, switching around perks one at a time, then I very well might not make it there.
---
Can buy plans for them in the Enclave bunker, pretty steep price tag iirc but generally worth it
---
In the armory in front of where he x-01 power armor sets are? Cause if so, they aren‚Äôt in the vendors for me
---
I got my pie too!!
---
Just because it isn‚Äôt a very hard to get around issue doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt widespread xD
---
I didn‚Äôt make a post about it for the last month but I‚Äôve experienced it daily. The fact I didn‚Äôt have to describe it shows people are immediately aware of what I‚Äôm referring to. People know it exists. It‚Äôs annoying, but most people would never bother to make an issue over it since it only lasts about 15 seconds usually
---
United 76 military
---
So Wastelanders may still be plagued with major bugs until a patch after that?
---
The feeling when ypu realized that the machine actually picked up the pie was awesome. 
---
We should measure experience and awesomeness with the number of pies players get from machines.
---
Less actually
---
Its actually a random event spawn. You find a raider with it. (At least that‚Äôs where I got mine!)
---
It depends on your playing style. Going for full damage? Then spend your weapon perks on the two handed melee cards. Also get the melee card that increases melee swinging speed.
---
Another good one is the melee card that ignores enemy armor.
---
For one handed melee like knives and 
---
 other one handed melee weapons, swap out the double handed perks with single handed ones.
---
There also a perk that weakens enemies upon hitting them, don't recall the name but it shows a picture of a mutant with a noodly arm or leg I think.
---
Sorry can't look at the perk card names at the moment but i hope these suggestions help!
---
I use a cryolator and aside from it's ammo I only ever use crystal to craft film, novelty receivers (Scorched Killer's Receivers use crystal) and occasionally other mods for weapons. You can gather raw crystal in Tanagra Town and through the Lucky Hole Mine of you need to restock
---
The armory or production. may have to jump servers a few times.

Personally, I find myself using the public worlds more than private and I am mostly a solo player. I'd recommend trying it for a month to see if you like it. In my opinion, unless you have friends that play and want to do things like the vault raids, Scorched Earth and Encryptid without all the lag and randos that you get on a public server, it's not worth the money. If it was $7-9 a month and if the servers were persistent, it would totally be worth it, but at $14 a month for a temporary world where you can't even guarantee that it's safe to transfer items between characters, it's hard to justify, especially since they have seemingly decided to stop giving free stuff to subscribers after only two weeks.
---
Yours is a comment, not a post tho
---
I can see that the replies to this post have been a little... unhelpful. xD
---
In short, very little *content* has been added in the last 3 months (fall season). The biggest things were both timed events that are now gone, including a 'Clean Up Appalachia' event to murder scorched, and a Halloween event at Whitesprings that included defacing property with graffiti and being a general nuisance to the beepbort security guards.
---
There have been a few middling type updates as well-- primarily bug fixes and little QOL tweaks-- but nothing that's likely to change your experience if you last played at the end of summer. 
---
Beyond that, a few things had been planned for release about now, primarily the major Wastelanders update, but it was pushed back until Q1 2020. Reports suggest that Bethesda is expanding its scope (which some see as a reboot attempt for the game's reputation), and we've also heard that they're taking more time to polish it. 
---
So we're basically in a lull for now. There's been talk of a legendary vendor sale coming soon (probably a Black Friday thing), and there should be a Christmas event in December as well as more bug fixes they're trying to release ASAP.
---
K, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to hop servers if I‚Äôm solo on a private server right? But I‚Äôll check
---
Energy weapon repair? Really isn't anything.  I see your crystal and raise you coal
---
The Gatling Gun shouldn't be written off - It's actually VERY accurate, even at long distances. And once you get used to that slow, regular fire rate, it becomes pretty effective. When I got an AAE Gatling, it became my main 'on the go' weapon.
---
Also, keep in mind that with the weird way armor works in the game, bigger hits are much more likely to punch through. So the .50, LMG, and Gat are generally a lot more effective than guns that fire faster but do less damage per bullet.
---
I think like 200 something, can't remember off the top of my head...maybe 230.  I have all three rifleman perks and level 5 demolition perk.
---
The vendor bot doesn‚Äôt spawn here when people place a camp.
---
I thought you could also get the mod (not plans maybe?) for it in the production wing. Don't have them myself, so take that with a grain of salt.
---
?
---
So this leads you to suggest that every player in the game has experienced this bug? xD
---
I dunno man, seems like you're reaching. But again, I hope they fix it soon.
---
I also have level 5 Adrenalin and level 3 bloody mess
---
Assassins is the most useless prefix in this whole game, followed by stalkers and nocturnal. There‚Äôs lots  of balancing need to be done to make the game more diverse and playable. Most of what they have done so far is simply nerfing the useful ones, which is just plain lazy and ineffective, most players want BE aimbot commando as their build because everything else is weak by comparison. I predict they won‚Äôt buff other things but will nerf bloodied and the handmade and call it a day. ‚ÄòGreat news we have fixed a bug that gives bloodied and the handmade excessive power, now it‚Äôs been fixed in order to balance better with other weapons, see you in the wasteland‚Äô
---
After trying 3 times or so I try to fast travel to another location close it and it always worked for me on first attempt. Weird.
---
This is my melee build right now, it can be improved here and there but this should give you a good idea:

I feel yer pain.. been there.
---
If yer on pc i might be able to donate a couple of things
---
Thank you for the reply, friend.
---
I was told that the three raids cycle on tuesdays, is that right? I‚Äôve only just started doing them properly.
---
You‚Äôre in Japan I assume üëçüèª
---
I have found more mags on private than public. Thinking of creating a comic book collector akin to the Mechanist soon.
---
it's Monday friend
---
I'm currently running a variant of the bloody unyeilding build. I averave abeut 1k to 1500 per hit on SBQ. I 1 hit most legendaries but I'm still a little squishy. Got the right perks, just need stronger armor. LoL and a better bloody gauntlet or hook. You gotta run at low health, nut once the perks are set, your pretty much unstoppable in pve.
---
indeed!!
---
I actually set up a "trap" base on my alt. I only used nailboards, though. Nothing that actually hurts. But, my trap base is also a dimly lit, 3 story winding path to my vendors with skulls, scarecrows and bone chimes everywhere, along with smoke from the smoke machine. The front door is a keypad door, with the number right there on the pad. I had a guy nope out after opening the door being greeted by a case of skulls, black smoke blowing in their face with a strobe light going off above their head.
---
But hey, you wanna play my game and I'm selling serums for 200 caps and Fixer plan for 12k.
---
Does not address how Heavy Weapons are used in support builds - you should clarify that things for DPS Heavy builds
---
No worries. I think some folks are reluctant to engage the question because there was of course disappointment around Wastelander's delay. This fall season has been very weak in terms of game development, but we hope that will change in the new year!
---
Ill get a list of my perks and stuff together in a bit. See wjat i can do to help ya out.
---
I find myself doing a lot more situational stuff ever since I picked up a 3\* ghoul slayer fixer.  Works great for the  sons of Dane event.  It's not explosive so I don'e blow myself up when they get in.  I just got a hunters fixer and a trouble shooter fixer so I will be hunting Robots and animals for a while.
---
üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs 2 am Tuesday here.
---
T51B with emergency protocols, kinetic servos and VATs overlay is what I primarily use.
---
I have a junkies heavy gun build. Lock and load, batteries included and bear arms are wasted perks to me. I am trying to maximize damage and full health and don't need to carry around 100k ammo or 60 plasma cores. 
---
Stabilized and One Gun Army are musts.
---
Nope Australia.
---
I sell them regularly at 200 caps. 
---
Last week someone dropped 3 nukes on the queen, so after the last one, I found him at his camp and gifted a couple cards.
---
I used to sell them for 100 caps when the convoy spawned at my camp constantly.
---
Coal...i needed 1 once for a fancy skin for a knife.
---
I think so. I log on in adventure, check player vendors, then move to my private instance.
---
Grab the ammo factory, do the defend. Head down to West-Tek and start clearing. Uranium Fever pops? Cool, travel over and get some items. Head back to West-Tek. Go up to ammo factory and grab ammo/defend. Go chase the random super mutant away from my CAMP. Run a silo and nuke whitesprings. Jump back to adventure before leaving the session to check player vendors again.
---
The only times I feel the need to be on adventure are player vendors (it's cool to see other CAMPS but I'm not really in the market for anything expensive) or maybe SBQ fight. Is it worth $13 a month? When you add in the other things you get, I'd say yes. For now. Once I get tired of doing the same thing over and over? Probably not.
---
Facts, its not suppose to be a player lol
---
Clearly stated, that it's from a solo pve perspective.
---
I understand that, but not by the the gm Beth uses
---
Exploration is the main reason I play these sorts of games, so I might try something like this.  I've done loads of poking around in WV so far, but something a bit more themed could be fun.  Maybe a Spring Break trip from the Uni over to the touristy stuff off to the west.
---
I want to see more of **everything** that is structural. I know that may be unhelpful, but I want more wallpapers, ceilings, floors, more shape variants, some glass stuff, different textures and texture overlays (like cracks or smudges or blood smears). I just... I want more lol.
---
In terms of priorities I can see where you're coming from, they really haven't added anything for ceilings so far. I'd be happy to see a couple  of new options, though people pay so little attention to it that I'm not sure it would be a good atom shop item (since it probably wouldn't sell nearly as much as walls or floors).
---
sup time traveler
---
So about another 10 hours then?
---
I'm thinking more like 24
---
All of my characters vary in race and look. Current character is an elderly black merchant running a hardware store. Next character will be a drunk white swordsman farmer. Deciding ethnicity for my mechanist comic book collector may be hispanic looking.
---
Thanks.. I‚Äôll sign up for a month and see how it goes
---
Good data, this is exactly what I've been curious about, thank you. I was at a spot I knew was a magazine spawn, checked and was not there. Unrelated, I was swapping characters went by same location same server and heard my boop boop go off, checked, sure enough it was there. I thought it was just being buggy, this makes much more sense though.
---
I found the video for you in case you needed it. If you want to Run this together Im on PS4 and we can server hop and help each other out....
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idni7KTzrGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idni7KTzrGs)
---
The mod is usually in the deepest part, and still requires hopping if I'm not mistaken.
---
Production, if it's the first one you come across when entering through service entrance, should have them.
---
Been ages since I looked though. Pretty sure 6 months ago or so they put them in full time cause people were tired of hopping for mods (I was certainly one, got a buncha jetpack but one shocks mod after tons of hopping).
---
Damn ok thanks.
---
Sorry, missed that! Deleting my unhelpful comment, thank you for your reply!
---
you're welcome. sry it's not sooner
---
oh ok it‚Äôs already Tuesday in Australia haha
---
There is a sword in the game that does more daga to humans
---
After reading this, I think it's time I shed my power armor in my heavy weapons build... the only thing I use it for is stabilized and emergency protocols and miss out on all the insane stat boosts from my full unyielding armor set.
---
I have thought that could be a fun build, a golf bag full of guns for every foe.  Do to light weight I was considering a pistol build for it.
---
Keep us posted, you‚Äôll probably get the patch first
---
RNGzus giveth, RNGzus taketh away. Some days I'm on fire and get 5 bobbles and 5 magazines in a couple hours, Other days I get 1 in 8 hours. Luck of the draw
---
Messing with the vendor bot spaqn = not approved.
---
The beauty is that even if you cancel after a month, you have:
---
* The ranger outfit
---
* The emotes
---
* The scrapbox and whatever you've stashed in it over that month (you can't put more in but you can still take out)
---
* The atoms (or whatever you've purchased with them)
---
Some have reported that the tent is still usable as well.
---
I do, i have a black guy, a black girl, a japanese guy, an irish girl, an hispanic girl, a blonde southern girl and my main who looks like me, wich is a white dude even tough im hispanic xD
---
Last couple times I went through Lucky Hole, I came out with about 275 crystal ore, (on top of the 400 lead).
---
if you don't need a huge amount, check any place that has a bar for Crystal Decanters.  There's usually a couple in the yellow building next to the bridge in Helvetia
---
Sir this is a Denny‚Äôs
---
I don‚Äôt think its Tuesday
---
You can craft around 160+ rounds of ultracite .308, that is much better value compared to the standard .308 ammo. In fact i only use ultracite rounds, and cores because the amount you can craft is really worth it.
---
I found UGL damage pretty dissapointing, even with fixed armor penetration. Both gatling energy weapons are weaker than the ballistic counterparts. A minigun does around 40% more damage on SBQ, compared to the UGL (53 vs 38 headshot damage both are B25/primed/same firerate), .50cal around 35% stronger than gatling plasma. (130 vs 94 headshot damage, both are B25/primed same firerate).
---
I wish it would have been available from the start.  I have no issue with the public server option however when you are playing privately it really does feel alone.  The lack of NPC's, for now, make the world feel extremely empty.  As if you were the only one that survived the vault and you are truly trying to make this world your own.  I think if you go into it with that mind set it can really change the experience.  It feels more like a traditional Fall Out game.
---
Anyway just my 2 cents on it.
---
I wish someone would have told me this when I started. I wasted literally 100+ levels of mess on my first character not knowing what I was doing, I'm level 225 now and just finally to where I want to be because I never planned it out. My alt, however, is level 60 and almost exactly what I want because I planned it out. Saves a boat load of time of you do it right.
---
Solo player new alt... Sounds like me. It's more than worth it to me. I still go to adventure as I like the human element (good ones) but getting a new alt leveled is easier on a Private server.
---
For me it's perfect balance. Well worth it.
---
Ha i never knew there‚Äôs such a thing called Crystal Decanter, thanks I‚Äôll look for it!üëçüèª
---
Sell items with my vending machine at prices close to what I could get with vendoe bot using hard bargain 3. People are so shocked to see a camp with low prices they buy away. I also cap the vendor with bulk junk and weapons off enemies and crops from my farm.
---
I also act as another vendor for players. They need caps, I buy their stuff at below vendor bot prices, and resell it to vendor bots or other players. Small margin but I am helping the economy giving caps to poor players and usually selling out my inventory to rich players.
---
I have seen people buy all my stimpacks at 7 caps just to sell them at their machine for 20-30. I do not care, helps my cap flow and they can sit on them until they find a buyer. My prices move so I generate constant cap flow.
---
People hate selling to me because I offer sub-cap prices on stuff. Even worthless stuff they stop collecting, but a few get surprised that i will drop them a few hundred caps they need for spare garbage they were going to drop anyway. 
---
Stuff like lead and acid i am buying at 2 and flipping at 3.
---
That is very kind of you, but not necessary. :)
---
Sorry bud you missed the opportunity to play decent games by wasting your time with this shit game for about a year. Must be nice being a sucker, bust out that wallet for Todd now.
---
I have another weird fast travel related issue along with this, some times whenever I fast travel it takes me to Camden Park. So, trying to fast travel over and over and then when it finally goes, it takes me to the complete opposite side of the world.
---
One of the serums requires it as well.
---
10k cryo cells?  That may last you a full queen fight!
---
I keep dog food to eat
---
Agree, especially the Gatling Gun benefit from the high overall damage, even if the fire rate is slow.
---
I did the quest ages ago like the first day it released.
---
Havent seen it anywhere on the perk menu :(
---
NP.  Whats your platform?
---
You don't have to be a dismissive dick towards the people who're suppressing, cryolating, tenderizing the queen, dealing with mobs, and revving downed players - I'm not going to hand you a calling card telling you when I show up, I'm just going to take a one-to-one minutes off of the fight, reduce your ammo consumption, freeze the target in place and draw aggro using Suppressor's melee weapons so she says still, and still occasionally carry the fight when the DPS players aren't hitting their numbers. I don't see much point in pure DPS builds when I can solo the queen using a support build with no damage enhancing perks, but I try to keep that to myself so that I don't insult people who've spent their time since BETA working on their build. Good for you for figuring out the Deeps on heavy weapons, though
---
It's otherwise you really hate meltdown or love washout. Who knows, maybe both.
---
Hmm, well if I find pipfall again I will try it.
---
Again, *in your opinion*. You're saying that no one asked for vanilla, which is also wrong. You may not agree with them, and they may not be a majority, but people have been asking for more in-depth PvP since the beginning.
---
If no one wanted, or asked for, a BR mode, people wouldn't be playing it. You (thankfully) aren't behind the development of this game, so please stop pretending that your egotism speaks for everyone.
---
I make only cryo cells with it. I bought 10 k shards from a dude and been crafting batches of 30k cryo cells when i want to make some caps on reddit. Few people use the cryolator so few people sell large quantities.
---
Wow it took you 2 days to come up with that super shitty r/gaming level of response? Go beat your dick to Geraldo.
---
Then when it works sends you somewhere you didn't choose
---
How they could be BoS members, when everyone died during scorched plague?
---
Yup.  I think there's another in either the CEO offices at Hornwright HQ, or on a side table in one of the big "conference rooms."  There's also a few  floating around WS.
---
You mean the immortal glowing bloodbug
---
PS4
---
For me it was fun for the first week,  and then I realized that the game is boring right now,  especially when there is no one around. Doing events like Uranium Fever alone is great,  but that's about the only real positive. The only other draw is the stash box, but neither are worth 12.95 a month. If the price was half that,  I would be renewing. For now,  I will be canceling the subscription. And yes,  I know if you buy a year,  it's cheaper. Glad I did a trial. A year would have killed me.
---
It happens most often to me a few minutes after joining a server. But there are moments where I can't go anywhere except my camp or the countdown will make it down to 2 seconds and just disappear.
---
Like others, I typically play solo and that's the core of the fallout universe.  The nuke zones, player vending and help with larger/multiplayer quests and events are key to adventure mode.
---
That said, playing on a private server is so much more like past fallout entries.  I don't have friends to play with so I'm all alone in there and it feels lonely.  More so than FO 4 sometimes since I've become used to all the other players.  It's quite eerie to play the private world these days and it adds something back into the game that feels like its been missing.  And the chance to run fun events solo and not have to deal with assholes one-shotting everything is great.  Also, transferring items between characters is a lot less risky so far it seems like this.
---
Its been nice to be able to pop back and forth depending on what I'm doing that day.  I will say that the STASH box/CAMP tent are game-changers and for that alone I will continue with the subscription.
---
Hasn't that bug existed since launch?
---
I just did their introductory quest a week ago with an alt and I didn't get a mask. Was this recently changed? I was sure I got one with my main months ago from that quest
---
My character sells close to what i get from the vendor bot. So it just saves me a trip to the bots. The advantage of low prices is constant cap flow and helping players play more instead of grind.
---
No, I am saying that vanilla ice cream, tasty as it may be and enjoy it as you may, is a poor choice of condiment for a beef stroganoff. I have no idea where you got the rest from.
---
If no one wanted, or asked for, a BR mode, but it was thrust upon us anyway and gated guaranteed cosmetics - where in adventure mode is 1000s of hours of grinding for a 0.03% chance to drop - behind playing it to boot people indeed would play it, of course they would.
---
What proportion of the player base actually plays it, and from those who actually play it for fun and who hide in the bushes as another form of joyless grind to unlock the cosmetics that however is anyone's guess because BGS is not releasing any figures.
---
However when I read about long waits, vacated matches and empty lobbies I don't get the impression that is as popular as you make it to be.
---
Make a compelling argument towards why a game mode that is so far removed from this franchise that may as well be its own separate game licensed to a third party company should appeal to a fan of the franchise that bought the game based on the Fallout appeal and I might change my mind.
---
Telling me why I am wrong for liking my Fallout to be a Fallout game because you and a bunch of friends enjoy BR a compelling argument makes it not.
---
As someone that runs bloodied, the damage is amazing but the upkeep is a pain.
---
Hitting that 19% (around 50hp for me) is best for damage, but leaves you pretty vulnerable. Even low level enemies can manage to chew that up if you're not careful. And that's ignore the hassle that is radiation.
---
There's tons of things out there trying to irradiate you - food, water, leaky barrels, nuclear fallout, glowing ones, the water right outside the Uranium Fever event zone...
---
And with every dose of radiation your max health pool shrinks. At times I've been wandering the wasteland with 7 max hp. At level 95.
---
Then there's the matter of clearing the excess radiation. Rad-away and diluted Rad-away have that nasty 2 hour disease resist penalty. Rad arches are nice (if you can find one) but over-correct - so you need to re-irradiate yourself back down.
---
And then there's the fact that if you die, the game will spawn you in with less rads. So you've lost nerd rage and some of your damage bonus. And if you're in a silo run you may not have an easy way to get that back safely.
---
It's amazing damage potential, but it's high maintenance.
---
There are no good shotgun builds... Unless you like to unload a drum into super mutants, scorched and even squirrels and laugh as they lay there all crippled at 80% health
---
Anyone can suppress. There's just no point to it.  
---
Anyone can cryolate. Not that it's even needed.  
---
Anyone can tenderize. Seriously, every motherfucker ever is running tenderizer.  
---
Anyone can deal with mobs. And everyone does, because xp.  
---
Anyone can rez downed players. Stimpaks aren't a luxury.
---
**That** was me being a dismissive dick.
---
Production Terminal, Enclave bunker.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not running into any of these bugs I see on reddit about 76
---
If you take the sunshine workshop and farm it, you can make a bunch of different pre-war foods and sell them like a convenience store. They're nice because they don't spoil.
---
From what I understand, there‚Äôs a chance of magazines and Bobbleheads spawning every time a play passes through the area. So, if several people pass through an area, but nobody tries to find the magazine, you‚Äôll be more likely to find one when you go searching for it. Then, if you‚Äôre the only person on the server, you‚Äôre the only one triggering the chance of an item to spawn. I still prefer to hunt for Bobbleheads and magazines on public servers because I personally haven‚Äôt had much luck on private servers.
---
The Fallout76 gaming community is indeed among the nicest you'll ever meet.  People in world are more likely to give you a gift than they are to shoot at you.  This subreddit, though, can be a bit contentious at times.
---
Not sure if this is a shitpost or someone's first experience submitting a support ticket anywhere.
---
Happens from time to time.  Console or PC?  Seems I only see it with PC.
---
"you guys are fast travelling?"
---
I have NEVER fast travelled because I am weighed down by too much crap. I am level 77
---
Tbh, I‚Äôve had better drops from the purveyor than from legendary enemies. 
---
 Whitesprings, Westek, Harper‚Äôs Ferry &amp; the burrows are usually pretty good for scrip runs. 
---
 As far as events, AWOL armaments, uranium fever, Encryptid, SBQ &amp; free range are the better events I‚Äôve found.
---
Around launch, yeah.
---
Same. Everybody I know who has done that event over and over (myself included) never got a mask. If it used to exist and no longer does in game that makes it legacy.
---
I have a quad explosive harpoon I got at West Tek that is a monster ( use 2 demolition cards) Range is amazing and taking out two mutants with one shot is impressive. VATs is nearly worthless with this weapon misses are more frequent than hits.
---
In Harper's ferry, in the house with the display cases
---
Fort Defiance also has a bunch of canned dog food and military ammo bags which you could probably move in a vendor if prices right.
---
Every time I've sent in a report, I've gotten the same copy paste bullshit reply from them. The Bethesda customer support clearly doesn't give a shit. You literally have to call them out, and publicly shame them to get anything done now.
---
It‚Äôs currently part of the ‚Äúglitched rewards‚Äù that drops all the jumpsuits for certain events. You will also get the masks. Just saw a post yesterday that someone got it after an event in the forest. On that post another said it happened to them in the savage divide.
---
At our level, use some of your extra pucks to get the magazine and bobble finder, try them on loot runs. For me it is the only way to finish those pesky magazine collection challenges.
---
Console, and yeah I see what you mean with pc getting the worse side of things (no offence to pc players)
---
oh I dunno....maybe because NW was supposed to be a limited time thing but was so popular that they kept it running might be an indication that it is MUCH more popular and maybe rando gatekeeper neckbeards on youtube might JUST be full of hot air and intentionally obtuse. Key advice on how to NOT sound like one of those guys, Don't yuck someone elses yum. Be happy for them.
---
only thing id really suggest is to throw 3 points onto enforcer for cripple, i primarily run rifle for my damage, but that sweet, sweet cripple is way to good to pass up
---
I ran into a Mole Miner yesterday, he just kept his guard up, I couldn't hurt him in melee, he just stood there blocking the entire time, so I shot him with my handmade.
---
so the journey is not for you, you just want the endgame, being all-powerfull, nor learning for yourself, but given all the info from others.
---
I dont understand that mentality, but to each his own i guess.
---
Buying from somebody or from exchanging scrip. There's are a sale tomorrow until next week. Save up 1k then spend it
---
Interesting note about the Gatling gun is you can speed it's fire rate quite considerably by tapping the trigger at the correct timing.
---
Agree for most weapons, you didn't mention explosive flamer, the bloodied explosive dupe  can be quite fun.
---
I have been experimenting with unyielding recently using VATS and it seems like some guns have interesting interactions, particularly the legacy plasma gattler which turns one bullet into numerous  projectiles which all gain pinpoint headshot accuracy when using VATS. I also note most heavy guns seem to have higher accuracy and range than commando weapons. This is with only 23 agi though. I haven't tested enough but with 30+ ago and some VATS legendary mods (particularly reduced cost) it seems like you might be able to make it quite viable.
---
I‚Äôve done this before buddy, and I still haven‚Äôt received an email from them, and yes I opted for the email option, not the text since I‚Äôm in Europe
---
I have a limb damage, vats crit build that can 2 shot mutants. If you want I can send you the build when I get home. I've been using it since 25 and it's a blast.
---
By PVP I meant a fair fight. Yes, there are 2 players involved and it's versus so you can call it PVP, I call it shooting fish in a barrel and that's the opposite of fair and the opposite of a fight and it shouldn't be anyone's standard, apparently it is though.
---
Certitude of 3* and at least ranged weapon category, and then 25%off.
---
Technically ultracite is the best because of the strangler heart power armor, they share the same look and mods
---
You're not forced to keep to private servers, I like private for transferring items between characters and the illusion of playing solo. Sometimes friends come by but usually it's just me all night. I prefer solo play so I use private a lot, but some days I like to go public to buy and sell, launch a nuke so that all the ghouls at whitespring won't be dead when I get there etc...
---
lol: no now you're just whining that you can't appreciate other playstyles than the one you can understand. Anyone can do those things in a fight, but you don't seem like the type of player to dedicate their time to helping others and it sounds like you're making excuses without specifics (also: can you point out a level 35 player who runs with Tenderizor? Or does Every Motherfucker not actually include every player :-P)
---
That's the way it's supposed to work.  But my experiences seem to indicate that magazines, bobbleheads, and plans spawn less frequently on the private world.  I only recently found the plans for robot legs; up until then I was *always* checking Harper's Ferry for the plans.  During all that time I never had a single plan spawn in the first floor display case on a private server, whereas on public servers there was something there about 1 in every six or seven tries.  That, of course, is just the most prominent example that I've noticed.
---
I completely forgot about flamer, just don't ever see it being used, heh. I haven't tried gat plasma with vats ever I think - interesting find.
---
I've had it countdown to 6 seconds and just go away... 12 is my record for ft attempts. Try just clicking on location and hitting enter for the confirmation. Seems to work fine
---
11 and a rage quit
---
I have an AAFFR .50 cal that's fun and decent on SBQ but I can't resist one shotting Supermutants and Glowing Ones with my Instigating 33 % hit chance 25% less cost double barrel shotgun. It doesn't sound that impressive at first glance but it is a beast.
---
Yeah. I had a zealots ultracite primed gatling laser for a little while and they all stack
---
Worthless piece of shit.
---
Yup
---
I got one the very first time I tried it. Never got another one.
---
Yeah, I've heard that was the one exception. Need to start grinding some Vault 94 missions.
---
That‚Äôs only for the Enclave Scout Armor Mask, I know what post you‚Äôre referring to
---
I assumed it was a natural drop from completing that Enclave quest to become General. I guess it's not, then. Regardless, it still drops from Enclave Events and Savage Divide events. Therefore, not a Legacy item.
---
Once I used fast travel and everytime I tried, I lost HP. After 6 attempt I died lol
---
Hey look, buddy, I'm an Heavy weapons guy. That means I solve problems. Not problems like 'what is beauty?', because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve¬†practical¬†problems. For instance, how am I gonna stop some big mean mother hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous new behind? The answer: use a gun. And if that don't work? Use more gun. Like this heavy-caliber little old number designed by me... built by me, and you best hope... not pointed at you.
---
It depends on whether you are looking for DR, ER and which mods you have available. Generally, T-51, X-01 and Ultracite are all very good and it's really down to preference (though some are better at certain stats than others). If you do enough SBQ runs, you'll get the Ultracite plans. X-01 plans have to be purchased at the enclave bunker and T-51 plans are not that uncommon.
---
I craft Civil War dresses and sell them to NPC vendors.
---
Don't test it just report or the ban hammer wil come down
---
I'm sorry to see their customer service hasn't changed over in over a year I really would like to know who's running the shitshow at the bethesda anymore customer service is like the basic thing
---
Alienhead huh
---
I still have not renewed. I opened a ticket last night. They just replied with a copy paste of the FO 1st article.
---
it really depends on what you want out of your power armor. 51 is the best for ballistic and energy resistance, but X-01 has the best rad resistance. ultracite is roughly the middle ground of the two.
---
I suggest trying it out with rail gun and crossbow as well.. anything where you and others can loot the ammo back off the body ..could be something to it.
---
I don't get where there is griefing in this scenario..
---
What‚Äôs your preferred method for generating 50 cal ammo? I don‚Äôt see it often ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù.
---
Yeah naked brown skin to hide in nuclear winter is best
---
You are inferring that the game mode was able to keep its popularity, which is a stretch to say the least unless you have evidence to back that up.
---
Moreover asking me to be happy for other people is easy, I'm glad that are people that enjoy the game mode, that does not mean that from the perspective of a player who has no interest whatsoever on the aforementioned mode seeing resources diverted to it that adventure mode could most definitely use, that is a more difficult proposition.
---
To put it as you do NW is yucking in my yum. The fact that the developer had to resort to a subscription model to keep furnishing my yum tell me the NW is doing very little for my yum if anything at all.
---
I always use cigarette machines because they have unlimited storage space
---
I havent experienced it yet. On xb1.
---
Wait, one of you guys actually plays this game!?
---
That's new.
---
He attacked you, you attacked him back. That's not griefing, that's consensual PvP.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what's going on with that. I need to check and see if my membership was renewed. Some people said to cancel it and buy it again but if you're still getting all the benefits then I guess technically you're getting a few free days of fallout 1st haha
---
That's pretty crafty actually! I don't do nuclear winter so that must be where all the black people are! Haha.
---
I see so many downvoted helpful comments, now I remember why I stopped coming here smh :(
---
I collect vampire weapons. My .50 seems like it's bugged. The health Regen is super weak compared to my mg42 or plasma/laser gats. Vampire's handmade is 2ndry stimpack machine   for my rifle build. 
---
I still use the .50 regularly as it's cheap to run and durability is decent and is an accurate quick response weapon.
---
Still leads to my point that it is now rare when months ago it could be purchased from a vendor at ease.
---
Got mine exactly on the 23rd, when i first bought my sub. Also PS4.
---
you start this calling them a griefer but don't say what they did. how were they a griefer? was it because they attacked you? the obvious solution is turn on pacifist. i fail to see how this is the game's fault.
---
Never said I was all powerful or that I wanted to be. But putting 15 points in ST early on (when I only play with rifles) and spending 5 cards a piece on both gunsmith and demo, THEN moving special points around and realizing I had upgraded them to 5 and cant use them if I'm lower special. So then I buy ANOTHER 3 each. 
---
What I described happened with a lot more perks than I just described as well. I bought stuff I didn't need or couldnt use with my build because I didn't know better. 
---
So yes, I like the journey, but the journey sucks ass when you realize you are a level 140 getting way outpreformed by level 50s. Then you have to spend another 80 levels fixing it. I'd call that wasted time.
---
nice! i put m8ne on display! dang dupers lol
---
How am i going to report something without really knowing how it is done exactly and the circumstances in which is needed for it to happen? I would only potentially end up wasting Bethesda's time if they have no clue how it works in order to fix it.
---
I know those guys who got banned for testing stuff but they were also using 3rd party softwares. This one is 100% in game ...also im not really sure if 1 single report would make it any difference so in that case if other people also experienced that they might also be able to report this same bug which will raise the chances of Bethesda looking into it and fixing it
---
Old news. Those are from launch. Another ‚Äúcontroversy‚Äù
---
dont worry, Beth is on top of this...not.
---
This has been going on since launch, and it's probably not gonna get any better any time soon.
---
Just got 2 in consecutive days at Camden Park. 
---
Congrats on your first pie, don't eat it all at once!!
---
I have advice- get rid of them. 
---
I had arguably the best shotty in the game for my first 100 levels and then the TSE nerf came and I changed my build to auto rifles and haven‚Äôt looked back. 
---
I miss my AAE combat shotgun.  Killing mobs was fun.
---
3 max for me. Happened almost once every logon. XBONE 1X. Load up and launch times are insanely long now also, and alot of times it force closes. 1000 hours played. Level 234. Shelved the game till wastelanders. Went back to FO4 survival when the private sessions (not private servers btw) launched. Much happier for now. May not come back.
---
Oh a private conversation displayed for all to see, that's a new one
---
people have told me since i posted theres a guarenteed spawn on top of the west tek building so theyre actually not that valuable lol.
---
What happened? I‚Äôm not clicking the think as I‚Äôm not on WiFi.
---
Well, darn.  These were the first I had seen.  At \~$76/bottle, it was a rather pricey rum.
---
Are you trying to project something here? I said, that I don't see a point in support builds in the current content - that's all. You can play whatever you like - why should it bother with appreciating it or not? 
---
&gt; can you point out a level 35 player who runs with Tenderizor? 
---
Level 35 is useless on SBQ anyway, why would I account for it?
---
Recurring billing is on and it says the next charge will be applied on 11/23 and I have not been charged yet. I haven't logged in today, but yesterday I had all my benefits still active.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Google is your friend - there are dumped CSVs if you want to peek through.
---
this was released months ago. it's just a bottle of rum in a cheap plastic shell. from what i heard it tasted meh, and it was a big "false advertising" deal since many assumed the glass bottle was going to be the "rocket shape" but instead it's a plastic shell with a normal bottle inside.
---
i wouldn't be surprised if the Silver Screen Bottling (the manufacturer) unloaded their remaining stock to retail stores just to get rid of it.
---
They banned for this before (to my knowlege), just warning you my man. It's up to you but it seems risky to me to test it.
---
im going to keep it preserved in my display case lol
---
I hardly run into anyone who isnt nice. Just tonight I chased down a low level and gave them a ton of plans. Probably someones alt but still I try to keep the positive vibes!
---
Yep, I‚Äôm honestly stunned since it‚Äôs dragged onto nearly 2 hours now, and I‚Äôm in Europe and it‚Äôs currently 7 pm, and to my understanding it‚Äôs still working time over in America no? This is ridiculous at this point, thanks for your sorry too lol, I might go insane haha
---
That‚Äôs the controversy. Cheap rum with plastic sleeve over the actual bottle. It‚Äôs just a licensing deal, personally don‚Äôt see the problem. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it.
---
Exactly, it is very hard to grief in this game nowadays and has been for a minute
---
Iv'e seen hundreds of players trying to sell the Fasnacht Man Mask (the one that spawns regularly at Freddy's and Ft Defiance) for hundreds or thousands of caps. I can only assume they're hoping to trick a noob who thinks it was one of the actual event masks.
---
On a semi-related note, why the fuck are people paying thousands of caps for the asylum stuff? I can count on one hand the number of people I've seen actually wearing the outfits and hats, so is it just some stupid obsession with collecting everything, even if said thing is ugly as fuck and will just sit in your stash?
---
Yeah people were mad that it didn't add 5 rads and increase their str or something like that
---
Eventually they will get to you but it will take time all I can advise is be persistent
---
I would just reporr it and move on.
---
Let bethesda research it and make any or no adjustment after testing themselves. Avoid the drama and follow tos and all is good.
---
Also have others report if they have seen similar, more reports will prob get a quicker look than a lone one.
---
I just buy it from players at 0.3 a round. Caps are easy enough to make.
---
I agree, but I don‚Äôt think that is too relevant to this post.
---
WTH I‚Äôm still overencumbered!
---
Love seeing how much Bethesda cares, sorry to hear you‚Äôve never gotten a professional response
---
I have this exact same feeling.  It applies to Skyrim too.  It's especially noticeable because, for whatever reason, I chose to play 76 in third-person mode, and now that I'm used to that, trying to go back and play third-person in the others is really janky.  In 4, the camera just claustrophobic feeling.  In Skyrim, your character snaps around whenever you change direction.
---
I also think 4's UI is just hideous in comparison to the smaller fonts and amber-colored HUD in 76.
---
Lol how is it griefing if you killed him or her and they sought revenge and killed you?   Sounds like a pretty normal PvP encounter.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll try just that my man
---
That‚Äôs not even that high a cost for some rums.
---
Edit:  plastic rocket-shaped sleeve over the actual bottle?  bah humbug!
---
I had scrapped mine a long time ago because I knew I could just go buy another one. I'm still depressed about it, I've been hitting those quests constantly trying to get a replacement Forest Scout Mask, but no luck.
---
Hmm i heard "half caff" once, wtf is that
---
What? You haven't made any arguments beyond the "I don't like NW, so no one likes NW". I have no reason to provide anything, as you're the one stating unfounded absolutes. As I said before, you're not the one deciding what is, or isn't a Fallout game. It seems to me that a game produced by Bethesda, with the title "Fallout", is a more credible source, than some opinionated random person in a sub-reddit, as to what "is" Fallout.
---
You, and your ego must be a hoot at parties.
---
Ive heard its a hell of a grind, but somehow i only server hopped three times and ended up with all of them, including the wetsuit
---
4 definitely feels... slower now. it's weird how before 76 launched, i was concerned how VATS not pausing/slowing down would work, and now i get thrown off when it does slow down.
---
Open map, select location, see cost, click to accept, hear caps noise, no load screen. 
---
Repeat steps 2-5 at least 3 times, close map 
---
Repeat...... 4 times I think? Finally accepts travel and starts loading, load finished, render stats popping in, crash. 
---
I took a break to calm down after that lol. Watched some Netflix
---
By god I want a safer way to give my rifle girl  a rifle I found on my heavy gunner. Oh lord, hell must have froze over.
---
Wineries have licensed Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead bottles, so it‚Äôs certainly not unheard of.
---
After I repaired my flat tire, I went around thumping robots to death with my tire iron
---
Rifleman perks effect to crossbow
---
Sorry--- pulled the link as I thought I had found something new.  Didn't want to re-hash old stuff.  :)  I'd gladly pay top dollar for high-end spirits, but the whole thing just looked like a "rush to market to get $$".
---
My bad!
---
Okay what am I looking at? I mean I watched the video, what ‚Äúcheating‚Äù was going on?
---
I'd agree on the UI being hideous in comparison. I just never realized how much smoother they made things until I started trying to play 4 again (I missed my airship brothers). If I was a modder, I'd be getting busy trying to port a bunch of the stuff that they polished up for 76 into 4, if at all possible.
---
add One Violent Night to that list of events.
---
Update the original asking for an update.
---
i didnt know you could keep trying it. usually after 2 or 3 times i realize the bug is happening and i just run a fair bit and then "usually" it works. not 100% but it works often
---
The closest I've gotten can be summed up as follows: "Sorry about your issue, but we can't help."
---
Tenderizer is bugged btw.
---
guy shoots up into the air, people die...
---
I just downloaded mods that made it more like 76
---
Damn! Thats impressive honestly...in endgame as well just hit lvl 200 actually. Maybe I should try something crazy like this lol
---
Yes cheating is rampant there.  They will (at least occasionally) ban people temporarily if enough supporting evidence is given to them.
---
The problem is that BGS support sucks in just about every way imaginable, and can't be bothered to look at most evidence.  Also, they seem to not be willing to outright ban people over this stuff except when they get bored.
---
76 has no decent cheat detection built in, so the only real hope of getting people caught is external evidence, which they won't (or don't have time to) look at.  It seems like they can detect a specific cheat program, but not more than that, and anything more sophisticated flies under their radar.
---
To your point, no, there's no point in playing NW right now.  Don't expect that to change any time soon.
---
I did
---
This isn't griefing you should look up the definition of the word...why so many people use this word and have no clue what it means
---
LOL, yeah, blockers can be a pain, but they normally can't block more than a few hits before I break their guard and then they die next hit.
---
I'd say get an explosive. Demolition perk in intelligence and fireproof in endurance.
---
So i did i broke the TOS by unintentionally experiencing a bug ? üòÇ I wonder how many times the TOS is violated daily by pretty much everyone
---
And how others would report this if they just like me before probably had no idea wtf just happened when someone took all their loot and they were able to see it? Im sure the guy who filter these bug reports wouldn't even consider looking into a report like "someone took my loot but im not sure how".. as they probably receive hundreds of all kinds of false (intentionally or not), incomplete, non-bugs, poorly writen/explained, bug reports daily too
---
See, I've tried to find a good selection of them but I haven't really found enough that really fits it. Don't get me wrong, it'll get better as more modders snag ideas and whatnot of things to freshen up 4 with, but until that hits full swing its just kind of frustrating being only halfway there as it were.
---
If you are you to as you put it 'discredit my opinion' you have to provide a compelling argument.
---
Unless you are inferring that because you are right and I am wrong it is beneath you to do so. Which would tell whose ego is currently filling this thread.
---
What is public domain and not just 'something I say' is that all the Fallout games that took the franchise to where it was prior to FO76 were RPGs; where it could be argued that FO76 was not marketed as such is fair to say that it was never marketed as a PvP centric game either.
---
point taken.  
---
I'm relatively happy with my perk loadout, so I hadn't thought about doing that - even though a couple of the possum badges have "acquire X magazine"
---
  Annoyance there is finding the mags the second time (since I already had most of them before getting all of the possum challenges/quests.)
---
Hmm... since the challenge says " I have to "acquire" ...
---
 Any idea if pulling them from my collection, dropping, then picking them up again counts?
---
Never gotten a single one, but I always try whenever I see a vending machine.
---
Why would I if it's already placed down ? Your more then welcome to goto that location and try! It's not that you cant build here, its that you cannot build inside the tree. It's the waterfall location by abbies bunker! If you can build a treehouse like I did,then all the power to you, but I'm telling you now you just cant haha. Before a stealth patch, you were able to build through the branches ect with no problem. Now you cant even touch the tree with the upper floors as they wont place! And it's not just this one. It's all trees, you can still place some small items just not platforms ect. Should of been more clear, it's the building in the tree part that cannot be done,not that you cant build at this location because you totally can, just not in the tree!
---
I don't think there is a scrapping mod. That's the one I miss the most. Portable scrap bench is about the closest you get but it feels too cheaty for me.
---
Likewise! I had traded a rare outfit for one yesterday just to Alleviate me from the repetitive grind of enclave events
---
You know those times when your character acts like they are taking damage, despite not actually losing health? I've had that cancel my timer multiple times.
---
State of the fallout 76 community right now:
---
Being downvoted for asking help to report a POTENTIAL bug üòÇ this got to be a fucking joke
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you have to update your camp by either logging out and back in, or storing it and putting it back down
---
Craft it. With Ammosmith, you'll produce 180 rounds per craft. Add Super Duper. Throw on Scrapper and clear West Tek for steel. Lucky Hole Mine for Lead. I built my camp on an Acid node. Take that acid and do Collision Course for Cloth to make Gunpowder.
---
The crazy accounts you can craft of .50 and 5mm are a big selling point for Heavy Guns imo.
---
But with those buffs you can easily hit over 20-30k Dmg even higher on the scorchbeast queen.
---
Thx!
---
Thanks i will try that before moving because i like where im at i just desperately need to free up some budget.
---
Not projecting, just reacting: you're being dismissive of other players, you keep flaunting that you can't figure out other builds, and are failing to account for people who might need help. You keep making excuses to avoid addressing points brought up, and you're adamant about downplaying other people's playstyles without taking the time to understand them.  Your comment about the lvl 35 says a lot about you: they're not there to be useful to you, they're there to have a good time and you're not showing that you're capable of considering or understanding the perspective of others. I'm sorry for that
---
You should account for the lvl 35 because skilled players can afford to. If it's too much to account for others then please feel free to stick to the front lines and keep looking down on playstyles that you can't get anything out of
---
What system are you on? I don‚Äôt see people nuking as much and I don‚Äôt think I could take on the queen alone. I‚Äôd love to join and happy to provide keycards, that‚Äôs something I can do!
---
I put in a new ticket that had a few (3) concerns about 4 days ago, losing scrap was one of them. From what I've gathered in their responses back and forth, different departments(?) or people handle different aspects of the game, the first guy I talked to helped me with initial ticket helped me fix issue 1, and then sent me to an "specialist" who fixed issue 2, and then it had been referred to an "advanced" department who is working on scrap issue. I think they have to do each account individually, and that "advanced" department seems overwhelmed right now with requests. They are working to solve issues, some issues are just a bit tougher than others. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
It happens and it sucks, one time i spend 30 something caps to fast travel to a camp to check out the vending machines and as soon as i paid and that caps sound came on my game crashed üòÇüò≠ talk about pay to crash üòÇ
---
That's interesting - i was looking to go back to F4 over the xmas as i was half way through a new run through \[with the Heather companion from the start\] when F76 came out i just left it.  
---
Sounds like it'll be an interesting revival given the comments.  
---
Perhaps these upgrades and whatnot would have gotten more attention on release if they weren't overshadowed by all the other issues
---
yea me toom And i'll keep trying for another 10 years for another üòÇ
---
Yeah, but they aren't necessary at all, unless you just want to SBQ farm. Everything else in the game will die in 1 to 2 normal swings though if you want to save food and time cooking/gathering.
---
Hell, even with SBQ killing, doing 2K per swing you notice the chunks falling off (once it's landed lol). But yeah, if you want to instakill EVERYTHING, stack all those buffs lol
---
Half decaf in a cup, other half regular coffee. Leaves you (ideally) with half (the) caff(iene), hence, half caff.
---
I tried going back to 4, but I miss my marsupial jump so much. I may need to live in a jetpack power armor now.
---
Combat Helmets aren't rare at all, and scrapping them can teach you the plan. One of my accounts learned it the first time I scrapped one.
---
It's very strange and hard to pin down what the cause might be. Other players report their fast switching works fine. I don't think I'm going crazy but...
---
Assasin seapons should ignore damage cap. Whoala best pvp legendary
---
Yep I dropped the ball on that one, that is correct. That's probably the only easy one to acquire/ is in the game. Removing the portion I considered it rare in the original post.
---
I went back and started a new game with 4 this weekend.  With all the new CC content I wanted to start fresh as it had been so long sense I played I had really no idea what I was doing with my older games.  Anyway the first thing I noticed was how slow things were.  The load screens, even bringing up the pip boy.  I completely forgot that I could just bring that bad boy up and it basically pauses everything.  I had just gotten so used to 76.
---
I also had some massive glitches.  I just couldn't get past the first major dialogue tree with Preston.  It would just freeze up and he would just stare at me, never giving me the key.  I had to start all over.
---
What I did miss was the story and the dialogue.  I started all over so I was doing things I haven't done in years.  I think this is the biggest thing I miss from 4 that 76 just lacks.  Running into NPC's and going through the dialogue trees.  Anyway, they both bring things to the table.  I think the game play is amazing in 76 but 4 will always have that one up on it I think.
---
Yes your not the only one it takes toke my caps TO
---
PS4. I‚Äôm the goofy bastard in a bunny head and bath robe. Queens aren‚Äôt bad. The only real challenge is when there are a lot of under 50 levels down there with you. The more people the harder she is. I only do public servers. To much fun to keep to yourself plus all others can gain from it.
---
Crafting ultracite gatling lasers/laser rifles to scrap for mods? But crystal is probably not going to be the limiting factor there, the ultracite gatling laser material requirements are nasty
---
IDK.  hard to tell since my damage numbers vary per critter - If it works, 5% is 5%.  If not, it's not that much, and I don't have another 1pt card I want to put there.  
---
Much less noticeable than when I swapped bloodytmess3 for starched genes and class freak.  But ... I'd rather have to take an extra swing to kill an enemy than risk losing a mutation.
---
This is the bug that proves the developers do not play the game.
---
Great post, but one question: As a heavy gun elite, what‚Äôs your opinion on melee?
---
Think what the beth response was that finding a exploit and reporting it is perfectly fine.
---
Repeatedly "testing" for purely "research" purposes is a no go. Especially if you are using stuff that breaks tos and even further if you only had intent to report bit never did.
---
Also it already seems like you figured out the how, harpoon guns potentially open up loot inventory to all, allowing theft of your specific loot rewards for kill. Just report what you explained in topic and all is well.
---
 Unless you are just trying to karma farm from 76 haters by bringing up subject that was definativly cleared up by bethesda in that post the other week. Sounds like your frustration is legit is though so hope it gets better for you fellow wastelander.
---
No, saying that intentionally trying to recreate exploits is breaking TOS. Game breaks on its own and you experience it? All good. You purposefully glitch the game? That's on you, just don't get caught doing it, or you could be potentially banned.
---
Yes, though you'll only get the other plan though the pioneer scout stuff.
---
Still hadn‚Äôt got mine yesterday but I‚Äôll try this thanks üôè
---
I feel the same way but one big thing I took for granted in 76 that 4 doesnt have is the ability to pick up power armor (thank god there is a mod for it)
---
Awesome! I‚Äôm run in a jumbled mess of robot armour and a flamer/gauntlet combo. I‚Äôm on PSN at Wasteland_Rox. If you add me I‚Äôll throw some nuke cards your way and get in on that nuke action ;)
---
Awesome, I‚Äôve been around WS forever yet never noticed those. The ghouls are too attractive üòÇ
---
This bothers you in a nuclear wasteland?
---
more than 10, I had to move outside to do fast travel.
---
Make guns ultracite you make more ammo per craft
---
Yu sound like a really good player.  Thanks for your comments.  The saying I would quit was a little bit sarcastic.....
---
Its easy to test yourself to comfirm. Use a low damage weapon and hit an enemy multiple times. Save for yellow head shots your damage numbers should increase after the first hit if its working. They do not.
---
Leather TS and a zealot set n u be golden. I will look u up.
---
Bugs get misused when they are spread through the community. Developers are the only ones that can fix that issue, don't tell some kid on Reddit who is going to try to help you glitch the game, tell the developers who can potentially fix the game. Submit a ticket, not a post.
---
^this in way less words than i wrote.
---
Marsupial really changed my playstyle that I couldn't play without it but if you download the cheat terminal mod theres a player alterations section and you can change jump height (3x is about the same as Marsupial) but I know some folks dont want to cheat in their playthroughs just thought I'd let you know
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pharma_Farma
---
And you'll be swimming in meds-chems-stims
---
Also I have three different builds that use the bloodied hooks I have ranging from 6 strength to 15 so I get how all of that plays out and I agree, there is such thing as overkill.  I enjoy overkill but I still do get killed when I go head up sometimes.  There are a lot of variables...usually when a mireluk king surprises me....I hate those guys.
---
Fair point i can actually see what you talking about now. But i just did this thread so what would you suggest? Just delete it and report straight to bethesda?
---
Damn that ass ;)
---
Wow you‚Äôre the Leader of the legendary hunters‚Äô Pack üëçüèª
---
He'll ya you're totally right, I really just do that when we're farming queens!  Lol it's tough tho running in a squad and sharing legendaries hahaha I gotta carry a decent wrap that won't one tap it so they can get xp or loot. Shit even without the buffs I can run attack 1tap lvl 80 scorchbeasts coming out of the fissures lol sooooo damn op
---
My record is 15 but I can make it indefinite.... I end up getting pissed and running to an alternate location or keep moving my character then clicking my fast travel location til it works.
---
True. Why I keep on pacifist 24/7. I'm not going to accidentally tag someone at a queen fight and give them means to take the flux I just got.
---
üòÇlol that‚Äôs a funny picture
---
Yep, and they stream on Twitch! üòä
---
I moved after filming üòÇ

Radaway recipe can be found our bought. On PS4 I am reducing my vending machine price to 9 caps each.
---
If you know about enclave vendors you can find it there.
---
Shia , someone likes us....maybe now folks will stop shooting at us when we want to borrow crops and purified water !!
---
It never spawned for me in that spot regardless of a camp being there or not. Had better luck at Lady Jane's and just outside Flatwoods.
---
No point in deleting, ppl may see this and have had same experience and decide to report. Happy travels pacifying appalachia.
---
okay I'm adding bikers /greasers to mine and shias lust ( switch blades and baseball bats also gotta drink alcohol )
---
Also, most of the Events, especially in the Forest and Toxic Valley, seem to have a chance of rewarding RadAway and Stimpacks.
---
You shouldn't have to make it.
---
woah that sounds rough
---
Stalkers isn‚Äôt a great first effect, look for a bloodied or TSE or at least AA otherwise you end up using lots of ammo. They nerfed shotguns beyond recognition, it‚Äôs like a melee weapon with pyro effects now. Very idiotic move but we already know what Bethesda is capable of.
---
"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."
---
Thanks! 
---
Which begs the question why you still follow a sub that you dont actually play??
---
You're reading too far into this. You gave an unfounded opinion, incorrectly, as a statement of fact. I merely pointed out, that it was, and is, not a factual statement.
---
You may want to revisit some of the pre-launch media regarding PvP, however. Player vs player interactions have always been marketed as part of the game, and Nuclear Winter is a continuation of that, regardless of your opinions on the matter.
---
I had this happen to me yesterday. "The owner is now hostile" I don't know who the owner is supposed to be because the cargo bot dgaf and I'm not hostile towards myself so I don't know who the owner is supposed to be. I didn't get a bounty for it so no big deal.
---
I noticed that bug i got so confused when i saw it
---
okay a nukashine run sounds intresting , tossing it in mine and shias list .
---
Sorta. Walking there wasn‚Äôt so bad, it was that top part that was the issue. 
---
I tried cheesing it out by hiding behind the elevator, but the Scorchbeast it summons kept attacking me, which really isn‚Äôt good for a level four. And the gutsies could nearly one shot me. 
---
But, I did it. Friend was happy, so it‚Äôs a win in my book. Might try the Burrows some time...
---
For me the only thing I cant the hang of again is accessing the map.
---
Uh, what? I do...
---
good point !!
---
OMG, this is the exact same for me, i wonder if their is a mod that makes it lie fo76.
---
Yeah definitely. The gameplay as a whole, even with its bugs, has a much smoother and even feel in 76 than in 4. The story and dialogue in 4 was good though, especially in Far Harbor. And I have been having so many issues with quest starters for the companions in 4, especially with Danse. Scribe Haylen keeps getting downed and then she won't get back up, and....Yeah. Its a mess. But I do agree both bring a lot to the table.
---
Oh cool, I should check that out. Building is my primary interest in the game. :3
---
It's partly because 4 lacks the natural immediacy of 76.  Because 76 is constantly moving - there's no way to pause the game or slow time - you get into this addictive loop of having to make spur-of-the-moment decisions in combat.
---
Some people say that VATS is ruined in 76, but what I've found once I moved to a gunner character is that it incorporated itself rather seamlessly into the flow of things, rather than being the "Hold on, let me think" button.  Much closer, I feel, to what VATS would represent to an actual Vault Dweller.
---
Radaways are early game problems. I don't even run Pharma anymore, and I end up with 70-100 in my inventory easily, just from events. Collecting mats to craft them would probably take more time than earning them.
---
No OGA? That one is pretty essential IMO.
---
You can pretty much hold the SBQ and any other tanky enemies in place by yourself.
---
Also, running more in agility combined with unyielding armor and no power armor will actually let you get your sneak high enough that you can sneak kill everything but the queen even with a loud heavy gun. Covert Operative is insanely powerful with an LMG. Even with the queen you can stay in caution with her if you stay on top of the adds and keep a few hundred feet distance and use escape artist to pop back into caution. Hitting for 250% damage overcomes the range drop off by a wide margin.
---
I don't think I've had this on PS4. I get the 15 second timer occasionally, but it's always worked for me.
---
From past tickets and a current ticket, they normally respond within 24 hours to the initial ticket, actual fixes can take up to 72 hours, sometimes more depending on severity of ticket. I've got a current ticket submitted 4 days ago with 3 complaints, one solved at 24 hours, one solved at 48 hours and one that is still on going.
---
Yeah that's something about whenever I try to play 4. I don't like to use cheats, but sometimes its just inevitable. That's something I enjoy with 76 though. I can't just pop up the command console and make things easier for myself.
---
You can get the recipe for stimpaks from the enclave medical vendor, but its kinda spendy. I think they sell the radaway recipe too, but i think i got mine from Feed the People (oddly enough, as well as the recipe for Psycho)
---
Thanks everyone for the information i didn't notice the bug and the nerfs until now lol Have a nice day :]
---
Worst part is when it happens when you're trying to fast travel to an event. And by the time it decides to work, the event is over and you missed out on the rewards and XP and whatnot.
---
Pvp has nothing to do with fair fight. That‚Äôs one of the things about this game, YOUR IN A WASTELAND, shit will be chaotic, other players are their to add to the chaos, and should be embraced. Whiners like you need to go back to fo4 and play in your bubble where it‚Äôs safe.
---
I am planning on making themed shops. My only character so far is a hardware shop specializing in junk components. 
---
Another character will be a farmer selling alcohol and non-perishable food and cooking supplies (salt/pepper/etc). 
---
My third character will be a toy shop with comics, bobbles, energy weapons, and power armor.
---
All my shops also sell basic supplies. And all my prices are insanely cheap. Making a themed shopping experience across multiple characters is part of my meta game, gotta make content for ourselves until wastelanders right!
---
Do your dailies and events.  Keep well rested and eat cranberry cobbler for an xp boost.
---
I'm not your buddy, pal.
---
If you go to Harper's Ferry (I would reccomend bringing a high level friend along and you tag the enemies from behind..) There's usually a lot of Supermutants everywhere that are high levels and grant a lot of XP per rotation. I use it for a quick half level, (Level 123 at the moment) and I also walk put with like 600 steel and a bunch of other junk. That or I just take the weapons I picked up and sell them to the vendor for the daily caps.
---
West tek and white springs golf course.
---
I still appreciate FO4 because of the mods. They really transform that game and for building in particular you can get way more quality of life and way, WAY more assets from FO4 (without buying atoms!)
---
That said, I still prefer 76 for the little reasons you mention. And also because it's has a dedicated community and plenty of life potential. If Bethesda manages to turn the game around and doesn't do something really stupid with mods, this game will basically replace FO4 indefinitely. For me it's just more fun to play an online game with others when it comes to things like building and trade.
---
Oh and actually another big reason I prefer 76... Appalachia is so much bigger and cooler. The Commonwealth was pretty awesome the first few times I played but after being in 76 for awhile, it feels like a grey turd with fewer interesting locations and a lot of places that are very much 'been there done that'.
---
My friend and I have a C.A.M.P. that‚Äôs right in front of there, good to know we weren‚Äôt the ones who broke it.
---
No thanks its fine :)
---
There 'is' a mod that lets you craft a little box that you can use to scrap junk on the fly, but its been starting to crash my game sometimes.
---
He does play, he was expressing surprise that an employee plays.
---
Awesome! I left their details in the comment section of the video if you wanted to check them out! üòä
---
I've managed to get 10 of the perfect preserved pie, not even really trying. I just click on the machine when ever I come across one.
---
Kill stuff near vendors. Walk to vendor and sell. WS train station. Harper's Ferry vendor. Top of the World. All are surrounded by enemies who drop a ton of stuff. Mole miners are a gold mine because they usually drop a gun, a mole miner gauntlet and glowing meat which you can cook and sell for 9-10 caps each.
---
Wear unyielding armor and have low hp when you sell to boost your charisma.
---
Thank you for the information :] i didn't know that
---
Ahh... than my bad and my apologies!!  So use to way to much negativity from people who quit a long time ago.  Never the less I was wrong...
---
Oh yeah. Picking up power armor was definitely something I liked having the option for. But really my biggest thing is still the scrapping. And all the weight reduction perks I suppose.
---
I did the whole you never meet Preston thing.  Got to Nuka World as quickly as I could.  Took over as a raider.  Built up settlements as the overboss without doing any of the story line.  After doing all of that I finally went to go see Preston and, it glitched out.  Says I need to get into the power armor even after I am in it.  Not that it really matters, never planned on doing much with that game but, frustrating.  I really wanted to see that dialogue with Preston.
---
I ended up finding a level three safe in the Penitentiary while digging around for unrelated things, so it's good to know that there is a safe with better chances in the Toxic Valley.
---
What platform? Im on pc iv literally never had an issue fast traveling and this is the first time iv even heard of this bug
---
Cigarettes and beer. Ballistic Bock, Rad Ant Lager and High Voltage Here sell well. I'd save the vendor space and place one or two cigarette machines instead of actually vendoring the cigarettes.
---
As everyone else is saying, "it depends".
---
If you're a "PA all day every day" type, you can argue T-51b, because it has the best ballistic and energy defense of all of the sets. (It also looks the best, IMO, and can rock those rad Nuka paints.)
---
However, if you tend to only use PA in high rad areas like blast zones, then it's actually the worst choice as it has noticeably lower rad resistance and you'll need to lean heavily on Radaway to keep your rads down over time.
---
Personally, as I don't like the look of X-01, I use a T-60 chest and Ultracite arms and legs. Provides a good mix of resistances across the board.
---
As any BR then lol. The bush tactic works wonder on the jungle map in pubg
---
All the time.  My favorite is when you are sent to a totally different location than selected.  Yesterday I got "You cant travel to this location" when trying to travel to someone's vendor camp
---
4-5. So annoying lol
---
The timer came along with the Arcos Pharma event, probably because it was frustrating to not be able to fast travel out since there's pretty much always enemies around. But it sure does seem they can't add any feature without adding a bug.
---
I used to play melee ALOT - my first character was a full on melee. Fav weapon - BSS combat knife. Thing is - I sort of got bored of it, but performance wise melee is still king imho.
---
‚ÄúOnly‚Äù three
---
Yeah I do really enjoy the world in 76. It just feels more alive than the Commonwealth. And I really can't wait to see how things progress. Bethesda has certainly made mistakes with the game, but they are at the very least continuing to keep trying with it. And frankly, having private worlds added in that you can have friends join in on basically brought the game to about what I originally wanted, though I'm still bummed out that the worlds aren't persistent between play sessions. While I do understand why not to an extent (makes how the cell reloads and random spawns work a little more difficult if its persistent), I still wish we could see solid buildups of areas like you get over time in Fallout 4 the longer you play.
---
I've never been able to find more than about 220 lead ore in Lucky Hole, even when I've taken my time and carefully searched. There must be some area that I'm completely missing that has more ore. If you've got any hints or ideas about what I might be doing wrong, they would be greatly appreciated!
---
Honestly not sure why anyone would run a  heavy weapons build without power armor.   I'm talking mainly PVE here, of course not for PVP. But no power armor means no benefit from the stabilized perk which means you aren't getting the most out of heavy weapons.  I also see you don't have one gun army and many of your luck perks are in mutations.  I ditched the mutations because I just don't find them necessary for a power armor heavy weapons build and don't want to have so many points tied up in  luck.  Got a ton of my mutations for my unarmed melee character and find they are way more beneficial for that build.
---
Here's my heavy weapons build.
---

---
I will say tho I mostly run a bloodied commando/melee prioritized around  the commando side, run the unstoppable monster. It's such a nice super strong backup, esp when doing queens and not wanting to switch to the queen char, can do 2-7k Dmg with sneak attack and fury, power attack on queen, that's more than enough Dmg to take her down quickly
---
How does your build look? Do you have bloody mess, all the heavy gunner perks, stabilized, and adrenaline? Do you use power armor for extra armor penetration?
---
The gatling gun is one of the worst heavy guns, it does decent damage per shot but compared to the others the dps is lacking.
---
Get a .50 machine gun, even a non legendary one will do better dps than a gatling gun and it will make it easier till you start finding some decent stuff. Buy 1 star heavies off players if they're cheap.
---
I didn't wait around to see what happened. Server hop is easy and free.
---
There definitely are some modes for helping with the feel, UI mods, scrapping mods, a mod for picking power armor up, so on. But its just a bit less exciting overall. Its a lot of small things that were done with 76 that just end up making 4 feel that much less.
---
Mine in 4 tries
---
Royal Jelly. The good kind that you can actually cook with. It's rare, it doesn't spoil and I bet you could sell it for a good price! One spawns in a basket behind one of the cabins at Middle Mountain Cabins, and one in a bathtub at the very top of Tangara Town.
---
The amount of quality of life changes that came with 76 were amazing I wish they could be implemented into fallout 4 through an update or something
---
Yea I like private servers as well. My friends will be rejoining the game to play with me once Bethesda improves a few things-- notably for me, we really need a hardmode difficulty. This game is stupid easy for the most part when you play with friends.
---
And I also want persistence as you noted, but we'll probably have to pay extra for that. Right now the subscription is more like 'buy some atoms and we'll give you private instance access', whereas a persistent world would probably require more monthly cash without the atoms.
---
Shotgun is only good with enforcer to cripple. The damage is bad with or without perks. Enforcer is good for a lot of laughs.
---
Wishful thinking, but absolutely. It would be incredible if they could port a bunch of those systems over. But I'm sure that would be an absolute nightmare for modders.
---
I built my camp on an acid deposit.  Iron  ore spots in ash heap and lead or in lucky hole mine and I can produce insane amounts of ammo with ammo smith perk and super duper.   My default weapon for heavy weapons build is Gatling gun because good damage and it doesn't plow through ammo so fast.  Anti- armor is my preferred legendary effect, but there's other good ones.  Ammo factory is a joke when it comes to producing heavy weapons ammo. With the added headache of powering the place up and the amount of PVP the place attracts, it's not worth it.   It's not worth it in a private server either.  So damn slow.
---
In order of difficulty, I'd say Grafton Steel, Lewisburg, Big Bend Tunnel, Harper's Ferry, and West-Tek.
---
First one is only valid one. Entrance to 79 was an accident and wasn't meant to be added in hence why it got patched. Terminal entries are to be expected.
---
Yeah I'm not sure which way it would end up going. Frankly, I'm happy with it as it is right now, and once I actually get my friends playing more it'll be even better. But for now its kind of refreshing having the ability to choose if I want to go see what other people are doing or be left alone.
---
I agree. It would be nice to see something different than the same 4 exteriors, same 10 or so roof textures, etc. Even with trying to be unique, most camps look similiar because there isn't enough building options.
---
Yup, even with mods FO4 still isn't as good or polished. The only thing that sucks more is the difficulty curve difference, 76 is stupid easy compared to 4, so whenever I switch over I die, A LOT more.
---
Stop trying to pull nonsense out of your arse. What excuses are you talking about? I'm being as straight as humanly possible with my answers. 
---
Not accounting for level 35 means just that. He won't be contributing to the encounter, so from my perspective it doesn't matter if he's there or not. Will I go out of my way to help him on SBQ? No. Do you want to go out of your way to help him? Knock yourself out, but get off yer high horse and stop pushing your agenda on others.
---
I didnt really notice them either until I started doing "pick up  everything that isn't nailed down and sell it at the vendor" cap runs. :)
---
West Tek, White Spring, and if you are low level enough, Summerville. A buddy of mine had me grinding that all the time when I was first starting to get me leveled up faster.
---
Helloy Mausdr1v3r,
---
we appreciate your money. Now piss off.
---
Yours truly
---
Todd Howard
---
That is something I've noticed as well really. I always felt like I was slow and plodding in Fallout 4, partly because I always ran power armor with a heavy gun to just slowly make my way through areas. But playing 76 with a similar style build, I just tear through places quickly and feel like I make my way around that much faster, even with the map being bigger.
---
To add to the response about the vendor bot not spawning...
---
I build camps in a private world, this was my first build ever in Charleston so I didn't know a vendor bot spawning would be affected, there are other locations where I personally have had better luck.
---
I was even asked if it affected the spawn of the vendor bot during the evaluation, and my response was I don't know, I don't think so?
---
Because I don't like power armor. Pretty sure I said it couple times here and there.
---
I‚Äôm not your pal, friend.
---
It's completely safe to transfer items between characters though
---
I feel the same way. Mutations, weapons degredation, scrapping, and the better lighting.
---
Hmm-had to buy them because I never got one. Must be worth a lot if they‚Äôre that rare.
---
They've actually made looting or sharing loot on monsters better. No longer does everyone have to hit the monster to loot it. Loot will drop for the whole group when whatever dies. But EXP still works the same, where if someone doesn't hit it,they don't get any exp.
---
big bend, whitesprings, and west tek. I mainly use beg bend though.
---
It really would, but I can imagine the process to directly port the systems from 76 into 4 would be a massive headache to accomplish, and could potentially break the game for many people
---
Jesus, I hope yours gets fixed first and not mine, guess I took what I had for granted üòÇ
---
Oh lord yeah. I used to always play Survival on Fallout 4, and I had a lot of really good runs. But then I move back to that now from 76 and I'm dying left and right. Its crazy really. I never realized how much easier 76 was than 4 overall. But then you also look at enemy group sizes. Enemies are usually in smaller amounts in 4, but stronger. Whereas in 76 there's a lot more enemies usually, but they are easier. Except the deathclaws. Deathclaws actually got a bit scary again in 76 compared to 4.
---
&gt;Actually what annoys me is that I enjoyed PvP in this game and it's basically been all but banned from the game because of people who can't keep up crying about it.
---
Actually, I was just pointing out how much of a dick you are for shitting on people who disagree you.
---
Excavator armor doubles ore.  
---
There's also a couple almost completely hidden by foliage passageways.
---
Have you found the kthulu statue and the room with the workbench and ritual bindings?
---
 I don't use VATS and there is no loss to my accuracy that I can detect. You have to use Twisted muscles, its a 25% buff. You have to use Bloody Mess its a 15% buff. There are choices but not those .
---
How did you go about getting in touch with them? I don't use Facebook and their Youtube channel hasn't been updated in a month.
---
I'm basically interested in having an eval for my current camp but I'm also into finding out more about what they do as a group. :)
---
That one is normally due to them logging off and that camp does not exist. It's on the map still for some reason. Guessing the map just hasn't updated yet.
---
12 and a half. The half being my game crashing, and fast traveling me back to the dashboard.
---
I always forget about mutations. Which is funny to say considering I'm constantly running like 4 or 5 of them. But then I hop over to 4 and I'm like, "...Why am I not jumping as hi- oh right, I'm don't have marsupial."
---
I'm not your friend, guy
---
Same, zero. What system is everyone else experiencing the problem on???
---
Indeed, I'm happy with the current situation. Private worlds are fine and TBH, I think player vending has been the biggest boost to camp builders since the game launched. I actually get semi-regular visitors and can easily fast travel to check out other camps as well, while keeping an eye out for good deals on camp plans. :)
---
ron swanson updoot given.
---
Yeah I've been playing through again on Survival and I had to stop myself from hitting up every crafting station I ran across to lighten the load. 
---
There's the little things like not being able to create a weapon from scratch, I completely forgot that that was a 76 improvement. Now I remember why I had to hoard Institute pistols, because you can't just make a laser rifle from scrap. 
---
BUT some things are better, like ALL of your perks being active at once. I think the card system in 76 is actually the best they've ever done as far as gameplay balance but swapping cards all the time is a bitch. I'm probably going to play through 76 again when I'm done with this Survival run.
---
Agreed. A lot of people have still been saying you can get it from vendors. Have never seen it at a vendor nor seen anybody get one from any event.
---
Not true
---
That is something else. The player vending was such a nice addition. Speaking of, I need to sell some of my legendaries so I can try to get a new 3 star .50 cal...
---
Interesting. I'll have to revisit minigun vs UGL testing. 50cal vs gat plasma is not even close though, agreed. Thanks for the tip!
---
I kill people in strangler armor all the time. It lags the server, but it is not tanky my man.
---
My fave for my bloodied heavy build is plain bloodied 50cal and same for a bloodied gatling plasma.
---
I bought my bloodied 50cal for right under 3k, Def worth it
---
They're active on Twitter! And you can watch past streams on Twitch üòä there's Discord too. They have a form that you can submit to request an eval which they linked on their twitter page, but they're on holidays for the moment for Thanksgiving but will be back early December, and at the moment they only eval on PS4 and Xbox!
---
I leave the event and hope he hits me.Then I‚Äôll kill him take his 50c and junk then leave or stick around
---
FYI, Scorch Beasts and the Queen are Animals and vulnerable to Hunter's weapons.
---
Something that they did say was going to be coming that will make it infinitely better is going to be the perk loadouts for 76. I was so excited when they said they were actually going to do that, though I am a bit bummed out that they aren't rolling it out until next year.
---
Oh I know this one! You need a couple for...settlement....recruiting...beacons. 
---
I'll show myself out.
---
It's not why some people go to events.
---
I've not been able to fast travel because I was [Hidden] yet could see an enemy in my sight.
---
I've also been able to fast travel while being attacked.
---
üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
Grafton Dam, Grafton Steel, Eastern Regional Penitentiary up until level 30ish.  Then go to Whitesprings,West Tek, and Harpers Ferry. Definitely do events where you see high level players are attending like Uranium Fever.
---
This. With speed demon, 3* LaL and 15%r mod, my 50 reloads about as fast, as a handgun.
---
Any update on PC stutter/freezing issues?
---
You mind fixing godmode first?
---
A lot of your fallout 1st players are PvP'ers too you know.
---
It doesn't appear to apply to all types of Power Armour.  I built my X01 suit with exactly the same mods as Excavator but was sorely disappointed when no "bonus" kicked in when I logged in wearing my X01 armour.  :(
---
You lost wood eh ? .... 
---
Am im the only one who got the total wrong mental image about floppy wieners here ?
---
SORRY BUT NOT SORRY !
---
Yeah it kinda feels like a more annoying Fallout 4 a lot of the time.
---
Yeah, I think I spent around 30 points doing a near full respec, I had no idea what I was doing, wasn't too familiar with the rpg style stats and perks. Would have been nice to know about builds when I started
---
ah gotcha. interesting. hopefully thats one bug they wont fix üòÇ
---
When i used to play f76 yes, but i stopped 76 and never really stopped fallout 4, there are always mods that make you come back once in a while.
---
Try out things, don't aim for one build just go crazy with it you can gain levels forever so you can worry about builds later, just enjoy yourself. What do you play on?
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I was also being a weird wordophile and thinking it was maybe "half calf" like for those weirdos that put milk and stuff in their coffee XD
---
I realize you don't actually care anymore, but junkies, vampire and certain medics are viable shotties. They compete with pistols for the weakest build, but IMHO pistols win that particular award.
---
Had a friend that was screwing with me wthe other day when I was fast travel bugged. Tried 12 times and nothing so he suggested crouching and uncrouching a few times and firing my rifle a few times. Pretty ridiculous that his random bs to troll me actually worked the bug out.
---
That's cool,  but having used stabilized and how great it works, and having tried running without it, I'd never want to  run a heavy weapons build without it. It's  a monster, and is even better since Bethesda fixed it to where it now works with energy weapons.
---
That is one of the downsides though of a living game vs a singleplayer game with mods. The singleplayer game will always be getting more mods, and the amount of mods means there's so many different ways to play it all the time. A living game like 76 doesn't benefit from that, and while it does get more content over time it isn't anywhere near the pace of a community of modders.
---
Happened to me in less than 2 minutes.  People, listen up, use the buddy system.
---
Fallout New vegas Deathclaws were the prime ones, they actually made you shit your pants running, Fallout 4 and 76 ones are quite nerfed lol
---
You could earn a lot of atoms with a rubber band.
---
We need a daily log on rewards  feature
---
lol, ok then. I'm sorry that you're low enough right now that it seems I'm high. It's ok that you can't afford to help others, it's alright that you can't understand playstyles beyond DPS, it's alright that you can't see the value in others. Good luck spitting bullets
---
1 Month = Doesn't renew, didn't state it would in account settings.
---
1 Year = Will in fact renew, I set auto renewal off for the Year option.
---
While I think ideas like this are fun, people would simply rubber band joysticks and idle all night to rack up atoms. Look how many people idled during NW for the Halloween rewards. I never had a full team of 4 playing at the same time.
---
If you complete all the daily and weekly challenges there are more than enough to own everything released in a year‚Äôs time.
---
If you get into any BOS factions, hit me up yo. lmao
---
Can you tell us in what way it's bugged, I'm curious as I use this on one of my builds
---
I can't figure out if your issue is with reading comprehension or writing ability.
---
Make a high level friend, tag high level mobs with a 38 or 10mm weapon, have him kill them all. Make sure you run Inspiration 3 Star and sleep.
---
I'm not sure about it being a more annoying Fallout 4. I've always felt a lot of the systems in 76 are smoother and more enjoyable than how they were in Fallout 4. Scrapping, power armor, and mutations are probably the biggest ones for me, though even just the appearance of the game benefits as well.
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas both were absolutely terrifying. They rebuffed them a bit in 76 from what they were in 4, but they still aren't quite at that terror level that 3 and NV had.
---
18. This was to just fast travel to my camp after 30 something minutes of play.
---
Sounds like you were griefing him.
---
Got to be honest.  I thought Fallout New Vegas was better than Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.  To me, Fallout 76 feels like the game designers grabbed some scenery from Fallout 4, assembled the map, and then said "F\*\*k the story!  Let 'em make it up themselves.  We've got Atom Shop Tchotchkes to design and merchandise to merchandise."
---
I've seen quite a few people say it's a safe way to do solo transfers.  how?
---
It's ok if you're confused, and I'm sorry to have triggered you. Taking care of others can be very difficult concept, and I'm happy to hear that you can take care of yourself in this game without considering the needs of the other players around you
---
It‚Äôs available on every server, public and private, as long as the user has a subscription to F1st.
---
4 is missing marsupial jumps, the separate map tab, camps, and plans.
---
Those few things alone make 4 almost unplayable to me now. I added a mod that could triple my jump height, but other than that....
---
Believe it or not, you can actually stick a Suppressor on a shotgun and use it as a stealth weapon.  If your stealth is good enough to let you crouch in-plain-sight next to enemies, a shotgun is a viable option.
---
Oh shit, jumped over the candlestick and throw a monkey wrench in the system whoohoo wut
---
You including limited time content in this assumption?
---
It doesn't increase the damage of your strikes after the first. Easy way to test is to use a non legendary gun on the Behemoth by Solomons Pond. After the first shot all your subsequent shot should do more damage. Currently it has no effect.
---

---
As for how to restart it...I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm sorry.
---
I know its semantics but the flux just vanishes the second you die and it transfers to a loot bag.  Been a bug for a while now.
---
While in [CAUTION], Scorched, super mutants, scorchbeasts and sentry bots will all fire at your last known location. Melee attackers run to that spot and then begin searching for you. Some intentionally missed shots can hit you, but this doesn't mean [DANGER].
---
Missing that marsupial for sure.
---
Yeah, when I first got to 50 respec wasn't an option so occasionally I'd head about people who realized they did their spec all wrong. But I'd gone on nukes and dragons and had a rough idea of what I wanted, but I'd have hated not to know about some of the better perks, stats, and the level 50 soft cap. Especially if that person is familiar with fallout 4 and thinks you just keep leveling. Edit: Er just keep gaining stats.
---
Usually this happens if the game thinks you are taking rad or health damage. Eat something that has rads or use radaway to break that, you should be able to travel after.
---
The map really is a big bonus, yeah. And being able to construct guns, armor, and other things on the fly with plans really feels right for the game. I feel I was definitely one of the people who never got really into the settlements in Fallout 4 (I actually use Sim Settlements usually to just have things built for me), but I love being able to use the camp to move around whenever I find a spot I want to base out of for awhile.
---
Supposedly not, I am sure buying them doesn't work .
---
It's a private SESSION
---
you can get the plans for the ultracite power armor from a terminal in fort defiance for free idk why they still drop from her to be honest only the mods for the utracite power armor should drop from her
---
Yup, the mod "conquest" that allows you to creata a settelement anywhere and connect it to your other settlements gives you an infinite playtime.
---
It's like repopulating the commonwealth. (this one https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12511 )
---
It did mention that it did have optional PvP elements, in no way was implicitly or explicitly said that it was PvP centric. Otherwise none of us who started playing the game, of which I am the last survivor, coming from Fallout modding would have touched it with a barge pole regardless of the 'franchise appeal'.
---
I fail to see how a BR mode is a natural progression to what we now call 'adventure mode' which at the time was 'the game' either.
---
Regarding my opinion being unfounded however, I will remit you to the period between launch and the introduction of NW and shortly after. I have, because memory is flawed and often I find myself remembering what I want to remember the way I want to remember it. I could find no evidence of anyone asking for a BR.
---
I could find a few cynical comments along the lines of 'well, if the game fails we can always tack on a BR mode later' but nothing more.
---
Hence repeating that it is 'the mode that no one asked for and no one wanted'.
---
But I digress; I still think, and I think I have substantiated this enough, that this game mode is a complete departure from anything that came before and given that my reasons to play FO76 are the elements it inherited from those who came before it, glad as I am that someone is enjoying it, I won't be able to shed the thought that the resources spent in developing it and trying to maintain its appeal would have been best spent on 'adventure mode' (formerly known as The Actual Game) who has found itself bereft of content and polish for months.
---
Definitely shouldn‚Äôt have bought a paid subscription to a broken game run by a lying company. No one here is going to be able to help you get through to Bethesda.
---
If you have a low tolerance for bugs I would skip it.  If you are more pragmatic $10 is a steal.
---
Happens to me constantly. It frustrates me more than I can explain.
---
You won‚Äôt have to deal with this if you experience the other bug: the ‚Äúghoul welcoming party‚Äù where 4-5 of them spawn just off the lobby when you first enter.  Add to that the fun bug where my Sneak build alerts the whole right (south) wing of the building.  Thankfully I‚Äôm at a level where it‚Äôs not a problem for me anymore. Just a ‚Äúhere we go again‚Äù moment...
---
I found working in enforcer is an important thing. My main is a rifleman build, and this cripples WAY easier in comparison.
---
Ok? Re-read my reply.
---
Dying over and over is not skill.
---
I‚Äôm not your guy, buddy.
---
Wanna see the video where I did it with only one death? Or should I do another solo assaultron runnusing only a Switchblade while on all 3 pylons using only healing salves?
---
Yeah, Fallout 4 really has an excellent baseline for making mods with. I'm hoping that 76, when they do allow mods, lets it be more open with things than just doing a CC route.
---
Nah, if you care that little about it, you learn to avoid it.
---
Thanks! After reading that I think the fact I got the quest was a bug, I‚Äôve definitely done that quest before as I run through west Tec everytime I play. The quest must‚Äôve reappeared in my log due to a bug
---
I got one about 5 nights ago after hitting everyone I see. I then proceeded to build a shrine to it in my camp.
---
Had my best luck at white pines ..only twice at Charleston station
---
Go to biv first thing on your left, if no one else took it.
---
Does it have the +250 Damage Resistance when reloading perk on it?  That perk can nullify the main prefix, in this case, Bloodied.  It's a bug.
---
I‚Äôm not doing anything atm, what is your psn
---
I‚Äôve earned over 15000 atoms in the past year. That‚Äôs pretty good by my book
---
lol true spirit of a wastelander ü§£
---
I know about the Excavator armor and always suit up before hitting the mine, so I must really be missing an important area. I think I've found the statue--is it the face under the mini-waterfall? I don't remember a room with a workbench, though.
---
I don't discriminate. Low levels 9 out of 10 times have bulk screws. LMAO
---
T51 is the best overall work-a-day walking around power armor. It has the best DR and ER protection of any of the readily available  power armors but it only has middling protection from Radiation, which makes it only ok in nuked areas. Use T51 if you want power armor to be your permanent state of being. 
---
However if you only use your power armor in nuked areas your best bet is X01 Enclave armor. It has 50% better Radiation protection than the T51 (it has the highest RR of any power armor) along with nearly identical ER protection but slightly worse DR protection. 
---
Regarding Ultracite: it has nearly identical DR protection to the T51 and much improved Radiation protection (but not as good as the X01) and slightly worse ER protection than either the T51 or the X01. It also has other drawbacks, namely the opportunity cost for repairs is higher due to the somewhat rare ultracite requirement and the mods can only be learned from plans almost exclusively dropped by the scorchbeast queen. The only advantage I can think of for Ultracite over T51 or X01 is the glitch where the jetpack mood can be applied to any part and not just the torso, which is nice,  at least until it gets fixed.
---
Wouldn't increased fire rate be better than two shot? 15% extra fire rate (so basically that much more dps) vs 10% extra with two shot and such. As a heavy guns player myself, I'll also agree that the LMG's only downside is ammo supply. Imagine if you only got .308 by paying 1 cap each at player vendors for it D:
---
The absolute best location for fast leveling is in a specialized gaming chair. They are comfortable and ergonomically sound for long gaming sessions.
---
you‚Äôre welcome, hope your day got better. hope we run into each other sometime in the Wasteland.
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look for it! üëçüèª
---
In the hallway with the code door. With that door on your right, follow the left wall looking for the hanging dead Vines that hide the passage. And Excavator!
---
We do. It‚Äôs called challenges like drink 10 alcoholic beverages for 10 atoms.
---
Were you teamed up with anyone at the time? Their quests will show up on your screen as well, but will disappear when they leave your team.
---
Sweet roll and charisma booze as well.
---
If you can do it without dying. Only video seen is angry turtles. The imposter is easy and the queen can be solo'd full health.
---
I have spent the last week inviting everyone on the server to my team and getting friends to murder them. Why I waited for people to claim workshops ever, I am quickly forgetting. #proud
---
You betcha. Shotguns are still fun to shoot, just not as effective as many others options. I still pull mine out from time to time. Shotgunner share the same perk tree (Strength) as Heavy so it‚Äôs pretty easy to switch between the two.
---
Thats not log on rewards
---
I was not teamed up but I had accepted a couple of friend requests at the time this happened so it might‚Äôve been caused by that
---
I‚Äôm still working on that angle. Issue is the hordes, then the amount of time she stays up. Got her to regen then down to half. Got killed by the poison from the mirelurk king
---
Essentially it is. It takes zero effort.
---
Lol were they really?  That reminds me of a time I was doing a huge build in Minecraft and I needed cobblestone.  I built a cobblestone generator so I could just stand still and mine it.  It got boring really, really quickly, so I crafted a diamond pickaxe and duck taped the trigger down so I could go do laundry.
---
wow I thought I was the only one.
---
Possibly! Nice humble brag on all the friend requests too 
---
*quietly cries alone in the Wasteland*
---
Hi thanks it‚Äôs chrissyfly
---
Finding 10 alcoholic drinks take a little bit of an effort
---
Grounded mutation?
---
Do the scout and biv dailies.  I would get almost an entire level for completing those at under level 20.
---
What is the respawn timer for an area?
---
It's a server, it's just a virtual server. Do you think if you pay for a Minecraft Realm that someone from Mojang goes in the back and loads another hard drive onto the rack?  Do you think they keep your server running when no one is on it?
---
With the removal of Survival, is it now impossible for new comers to get the Unstoppable Monster and other Survival variants?
---
I have no less than 50 beers in my stash/inventory/vendor at any given time. They‚Äôre insanely easy to craft and are perfect for needing a little extra Str/Cha to FT to a vendor.
---
Fun fact: Fallout 4 was going to be the 1st online fallout game,but they changed their decision and made it single player instead.That's why the chat options are that way
---
Fast traveling from anywhere is the one thing I couldn't do without now.
---
That‚Äôs crazy.  I‚Äôve never done a good job of keeping up with the challenges, but for the last few weeks I‚Äôve started catching them up just to have to extra atoms.  I started with about 700, picked up the fridge, the scrap bot, a wallpaper pack, and an individual wallpaper and I now have 2610 atoms to boot after today‚Äôs dailies.
---
It certainly isn‚Äôt hard to get atoms if you‚Äôre willing to make it a point to do all the challenges and work on them for a while.
---
YANG GANG
---
Just food, no aid kits, no radaway, no stimpacks. Soup is ok, the rest isn't. Forget about a shishkebab: if it didn't exist, it does not belong in the build. Think realistically: history book elements. Candles and fire, etc.
---
No idea but my PS4 has never given me, my wife or my several friends any issues.
---
awesome! yea i put a note by my display saying it was from the machine üòÅ
---
Yes the few players not getting their compensation is truly a malicious move by Bethesda and not just because they are likely overwhelmed with tickets and people trying to get free shit
---
I have been grinding away dailies and weeklies recently. I missed out on Christmas bundle last year (was only 100 short when it was taken away!). Don‚Äôt want to let that happen again. Of course I just bought a bunch of thanksgiving stuff so am back down to 1500 haha. Damn pilgrim outfit was too cool to pass up.
---
I agree. God mode is the worst exploit for pvp players.
---
Hey, if they bugged I dunno how anyone can help but I can try if you want
---
I did the same no problem.
---
76 is a trash heap compared to Fallout 4.
---
76 IS fallout 4.just a different landscape.
---
Same junk.same scenery.they were so lazy they did not change anything.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox add my gamertag it‚Äôs s3shb0t I don‚Äôt have mic so I can‚Äôt really talk but I‚Äôm always trying to nuke the queen, do the encryptid event, or just farm the normal events!
---
I earn small amounts of atoms all the time just playing my character. Helps to start new characters too I believe. Drop rate could be better, but it would be nice if the prices on the atomic shop were smaller.
---
Well its just a named bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, you can get unnamed gauntlets from every legendary enemy and the purveyor if you are lucky enough.
---
Can you get them elsewhere?
---
Mine hits for around 80 too iirc. Only mods it has are bloodied and ffr. No grounded either. It's just like the minigun, low damage per shot means it's reduced heavily by armor.
---
It's still not a bad weapon, they specifically buffed this typed of heavies a few patches ago, for this reason (they used to be 30% lower).
---
I seem to have better luck if I click slowly along each step to confirm fast travel. Press button wait press button wait etc.
---
Oh, I know, but it was so much easier with Survival lol. 
---
The other day was thinking about helping a new friend by getting him one, then realized there is no Survival anymore, but nothing on The Google would show if they completely removed the weapons as well from being obtained, or if they provided us with another way to. So it's been something on my mind that this post reminded me about.
---
Fallout First, i guess. although that doesn‚Äôt even work
---
A universal basic income could be especially beneficial in time of disaster, such as in the aftermath of an atomic war.
---
I think we should get atoms per disconect. Now thats incentive to play, which many of us need these days since the game is so empty and boring.
---
Same, I'm honestly really surprised there hasn't been a mod that reimplements 76's crafting improvements into 4.
---
Yesterday. It was: 'drink a nuka cherry'.
---
As the dataminers have said in their AMA and in other threads, the scout armor masks only drop from divide events with something like a 0.01% chance. They do not drop from Enclave events anymore nor from any story missions.
---
Yeah I modded some of the 76 functionality into fallout 4. There's a mod called Salvage Beacons that works like a one way scrap box (but costs each time by using up a craftable becon and borrowing one of your settlers to come get the stuff) and there's a Portable Junk Recycler mod that lets you scrap items to components anywhere on the fly which is similar enough to scrapping at benches.
---
The really difficult thing for me to get use to though is the map being in the pipboy again and fast travel being free. I really want a mod for this for fallout 4. It would take one of the more talented modders though, because it would need to be done via F4SE I think.
---
I do wish they'd have put the sleep mechanic *into* 76 *from* 4, where you have to sleep in a built bed and get well rested every so often or face adrenaline bar penalties.
---
I sort of like the power armor functions from 4 better, but only because it was more lore friendly for me to park them all over in spots where I could grab them to use in each region and then store them back there. I never got into hot rodding power armor in either game, it was always more like a utility thing where I had to face a lot of rads.
---
I never modded in the real time VATS though. I use Bullet Time in 4 so I never use VATS so I didn't need it. I do miss Bullet Time in 76 though, really badly, but it's not possible to mod it in. I wonder if some day the option will come for private servers to enable regular VATS and Jet use by making the server complete solo and syncing the time and timescale between the client and server. Then it would maybe be possible to mod Bullet Time in.
---
Not really. You get a nice amount, but not enough to buy it all.
---
Explosive and anti amour or two shot and anti amour. Also the enforcer perk in agility. 
---
Bloodied if good for everything unless you cant/refuse to play it properly.
---
Two shot explosive is good too I found but it's kinda likely to kill you and the reticle is too big that I'd only use one for VATS.
---
They changed something a few patches back so I can't snap things over existing structures like we used to be able to. Lot of people don't realize just how un-rebuildable their CAMPs are. I wont touch a single thing on my mains CAMP anymore.
---
You could hybrid. The qe harpoon would be good for the adds. Yeah poison is what gets you down there. I have a bloodied alt, it's fun but dying is a thing. You lose a lot of damage going over 20 too. A good stealth set with fixer is the way turtle did it, but that's no melee.
---
I‚Äôll add you! I hope our wholesome exchange gets a billion upvotes. üôå
---
Wow, this is EXACTLY why I started grinding them.  I missed the Christmas trees last year and I just recently rebuilt a nice CAMP with a spot for a tree!
---
yea apparently theres a spawn for one on top of wes tek.
---
Can't expect me to have any form of pity. They brought it on themselves.
---
That's limited to 8 players.
---
I'll be honest, I dislike the map, every previous game had you accessing the map through the pip boy, as well as the removal of the local map in 76, it's not my favorite.
---
only 8 per server and it works great for me
---
Yes. Sadly yes.
---
A couple of my favorite game play mods are VAFS, which is essentially a bullet time that drains based on AP, and something called Souls Mode I think, which gives you toggles for keeping game time running while doing certain things. So if you open your pip-boy, game keeps running so you have to be more alert. Made the game a lot more immersive feeling, and just had a better flow, I feel.
---
didn‚Äôt know that, lol.
---
That is something that I didn't like. I really preferred to have a local map, because sometimes it can be easy to get lost inside of a building. However, being able to fast travel even inside of a building was a somewhat nice tradeoff at least. Though that doesn't help when I'm doing a no-fast travel challenge.
---
Oooooo damn, I never knew that, thank you very much
---
i dont have it, just know there was a lot of buzz around it
---
They were tough choices for me to not use.  I know not using them it makes some things a bit more difficult. 
---
Classfreak3 drops the accuracy hit to what, 12% ?  
---
That's acceptable.  My problem is I only run 3 luck, so I can't bump class freak.  Cant find a category I want to take points from to bump luck, so I compromise. 
---
 To that end, I like the power balance of the build,  even if I can't 1 hit everything, it works for my playstyle (or I've subconciously adapted my playstyle to make it work).
---
2 lol
---
Happened to me to, a few weeks ago. Nothing happened as a consequence, there was no actual bounty on my head. Just one more (inconsequential, thank $deity) bug...
---
Or hear me out here. Use a stimapk that you favorited and then use the normal stim if no favorite is selected. That way I can use my stim diffusers in a pinch.
---
talk talk talk.
---
To be fair, that was my first thought as well, but then I remembered the limit (I read it as '2 teams', for some reason).
---
There is a well rested mechanic in 76, though its not really like the Fallout 4 one. But if you do rest in a bed for a time, you'll get some bonuses for doing so. Same for sitting down and playing instruments.
---
Cool I'm adding you now.
---
I dont have any stim diffusers
---
Ive read that if you team with someone who hasnt completed them, after they finish it, itll complete the quest for both dextrouspick539 on xbox
---
Imo, the bloodied SS +1 Strength for low health builds is def looking into.
---
There's been a lot of mods for a lot of the 76 systems to bring them into 4, but not all of them. And some of the ones that are there are pretty rough. I'm hopeful though, that we'll see more coming over as time goes on.
---
I do recall them saying that it was going to have multiplayer, but I don't think it was going to be online to the scale of what 76 has.
---
I was proposing the effect to work as I said, not being sarcastic at you lol. Maybe I dint word it properly.
---
I can't expect that you're right, but that doesn't mean you need to be a dick.
---
You did exactly what he wanted you to.  Actually wouldnt be surprised if he made sure he had enough junk to make you overweight/sort through it too long.  Hopefully you learned if you're going to dip your toes in the shallow end of the PvP pool don't stick around to loot/gloat.
---
Cumbersome indeed. Also, my thumb go for the favourite wheel and I die before finding that stimpak.
---
no I won't, I know I am correct. Sentinel Assasin does not work under stealth conditions . It only works when you are standing still. Plus you can't tank a quad Tesla. If someone shoots the ground it does not recognize it as energy damage or ballistic. It's just flat damage because of some weird modifier for it being a ricochet. I have nothing to regret. All you have to do is sit there and sneak and I shoot you or I sit there and sneak and you shoot me. Then we do the Tesla and see if you can stand there and tank it. You made those two claims and I called you a liar. So we're going to prove that. If you wanna fight we can do that too but first back up your claim- concrete.
---
Yeah I forgot about all the other flavours that were added from Nuka World.
---
  I haven't needed to go to LH Mine in a while - don't remember if there's a waterfall in the face room.
---
IIRC, there's a workbench, a loot crate, and a chalkboard.  The ritual bindings outfit and mask are in the same room.
---
Well, since 76 was a FO4 port, they might be able to port FO4 into 76 as a "single-player" offline experience? This would make a lot of people happier and might not be too hard to do...
---
My husband did this too the other day lol
---
Yeah that would be cool. Don‚Äôt know how likely though, since they don‚Äôt already exist in game and would require all new animations and hit boxes.
---
We see this a lot, often times it will be the same prefix
---
Ps4? Maybe my camp lol
---
Same. My camp is built in a tree and I moved a floor piece one day only to realize I couldn‚Äôt put it back, and had to rearrange everything based on that. So, now I don‚Äôt move any structures and will probably never get that ‚Äúbuild (76) camps around Appalachia‚Äù challenge
---
Lead I go to lucky hole.  Also super duper perk
---
Nice try EA! Damm,  sorry wrong game
---
Eh, imho the pip boy map was clunky. Being able to simply press a button to hit the map rather than scrolling through your pip boy is a vast improvement imho.
---
I'm actually not sure about that. One of the things that gets brought up in the Making of Fallout 76 documentary that came out last year was that they couldn't make 76 directly in Fallout 4 because of how the engine was centered around having 1 player. So they ended up having to re-write a large chunk of the engine just to allow for multiple players to interact with the world. I'd imagine it may be easier to do now, but I'm not certain it'd be a direct 1 to 1 port.
---
Was a mod for 4 that changed vats to a kinda slow mo, loved it
---
25% fire rate is a secondary effect, while two shot is primary, so you can have both on your gun :)
---
You need all the previous mods before they'll drop
---
Bring the Excavator for bonus lead
---
Acid, can either hop servers and kill Yao Guai/Snallygasters/Grafton Monsters or take Hemlock Holes workshop.
---
Steel/Gunpowder I get tons from Super Mutants. Put on scrapper then scrap their ballistic weapons. They carry okay amounts of gunpowder, may be better to craft it but I never have and I've got a thousand or so GP on me at all times (er, in stash).
---
I think they were only added to the reward pool for uranium fever in patch 13 or 14. Apparently there are tiers of completion which open up different rewards and i bet you need to keep all 3 machines up the whole time to get the tier with the sheilded raider and enclave mask.
---
Happens with SB bodies as well.  One session, I killed 3-4 of them; everywhere I went, it rained SB corpses
---
I've noticed it tends to happen more often if you do not take  everything out of the cargo container.  
---
For fun, take everything, then put some trash item back in it.  
---
The same container will follow you - easily verifiable in that whatever you put in is still there.
---
Server hop usually takes care of it.
---
The other guys in this thread talk about rad resistance in nuke zones and just to clarify it is not only the ambient radiation that's a problem, every creature in a nuke zone hits for radiation damage too.  So while the numbers may not look THAT much different from one PA set to another the small difference in practice adds up very quickly both per second in the zone AND per hit from the creatures in the zone.
---
I've had this issue 14 times. It's really annoying
---
I never really used fast travel much in the first place in Fallout 4 since I usually played in Survival. The biggest thing for me, really, is the scrapping mechanic. Its not hard to play Fallout 4 without 76's scrapping, but its certainly inconvenient.
---
&gt;I'm sorry to have triggered you
---
You're giving yourself too much credit. Try harder.
---
Absolutely. Gets critical when you are trying to escape a bad situation.
---
I camp on a lead extractor (alternatively you want to run through lucky hole mine with excavator armor) for acid i kill bugs and snallygasters. The snallys are at my camp and week 3 on the raid can net you more acid than you need with just 1 run. Other places are tangara town, and the berkly springs workshop. The workshop gets attacked by crickets often, maybe some other ones do too. Kill you gui too. Gunpowder youll get from all the acid mixed with stopping by the airport to grab free cloth by the 100s from collision course boxes. And once you get a nice surpluss of scrap going you can just sit on it and make ammo as you bring in steel to scrap. Thats what i do but i gues you could go farm for steel too if youre desprate for the ammo now.
---
Table in the drinking hall at the one violent night
---
Oh no thats why I lol'd. Glad im not the only immature one here. When my friends and I play NW and ask do u need armor we answer nah I got woodor chick wood for the couple friends who are girls lol
---
They brought that on themselves too.
---
Now you don‚Äôt want everything happening all at once do you? /s
---
loot the medical center/hospital in charleston, or the all the hangars at morgantown airport
---
Or
---
Make a WS cottage run.  A lot of the critters drop radx, radaway, or the diluted versions thereof as loot.
---
What a view!

Someday i hope they implement a duel request. Guy wants to pvp, they send a request like party one. You decline twice then they can not request again for like 20 min. You accept, its 1v1 with no revenge option and starts 30 secs after accept so you can store junk. Duel ends automatically in draw after 1.30 so they cant fast travel away and grief that way.

---
Use that to help you with farming anything.  It's an exhaustive list.
---
No they really didn't
---
I bought some recently and they were never credited to the game still waiting also
---
What would be a good price for that?
---
I have been at it sense the first response and have only seen the torso, which I have. I left that one so I wouldn't have to wait.
---
Im pretty sure the enclave mask comes from enclave missions but i could be wrong
---
I have to keep running around and trying to fast travel. It will eventually work. This or whe you're killed and the only place you can spawn is vault 76.
---
Like 5 I think
---
Keep at it, youll get them!
---
In addition to Lucky Hole for lead, I recommend putting your camp on an acid extractor for a free 10 acid every time you go back to camp. You can make gunpowder with acid and cloth. You can get tons of cloth from killing ghouls and opening safes for pre-war money, so I recommend making gunpowder when you need it rather than hoarding it since it's heavy af. Steel comes from breaking down weapons.
---
There are also guaranteed spawns for super mutants with minguns that you can farm for 5mm. Sometimes they drop 500 rounds which is nice. One easy one is the waste dump right next to the Whitespring. Huntersville is another.
---
I used to sell these for 150 each, due to demand from the scout challenge. I couldn't keep them in stock they sold out so fast.
---
I only just recently realized it when I started trying to play Fallout 4 again. Its incredibly frustrating to me because I really enjoyed 4 originally.
---
Weights filled with lead can be found in the silos, Hornwright estate, Charleston fire department and the Green country lodge. It's also always worth doing events that reward ores, since 1 lead ore can be broken with acid into 5 scrap lead. If you go out collecting ore from spawns / deposites, make sure to wear excavator power armor as it x4 the ore you pick-up.
---
Same here brotha haha! Dont you find it weird that they would even do that though? Like who does that help lol. I was told you couldnt build at my spot anymore, I took out a floor and it wouldn't let me replace it,I now have a carpet covering that hole on my first floor lol. Still happy about how it came out though! Dont think I'll be moving anytime soon
---
Trying to Hijack top comment to say if you run for ~15 seconds in one direction then update the map the fast travel will work
---
Smart man, here. Much better to make than scavenge gunpowder
---
awesome! congrats!!
---
Thanks haha! I love sitting out there looking over the trees, sometimes you can see the nuclear reactors smoking from up there
---
Check his anal cavity for a pass.
---
Releasing a broken game, trying too "fix" it with an overpriced subscription, lying to the community countless times, breaking countless promises ... oh yeah, they did.
---
This is how I finished off my collection, same with bobbleheads.
---
Now I sell them for cheap as others might need em for the bonuses or display items
---
Ok i literally do not give a shit what Beth did, you don't need to be a jackass to the dude who just wants help.
---
No shit? Did they advertise that or did you have to find out from experience?
---
I would never call it 100% safe, but better than on a public server.  You simply put things in a container quickly switch character and rejoin.  You have about 5 minutes from what I understand before to rejoin the exact world you were in. I have done it several times ok, but there is always a risk.
---
There easy to get go to bunker request one shoot down bot loot win
---
Aw that's too bad, I have to assume then that all of their activities are non-PC then. And being a PC player I won't be able to participate. 
---
Ce la vie!
---
Fun?  Like dismembered super mutant body parts and jarred scorched bits fun?
---
I had a Halloween graveyard camp and scattered in my machines amongst my normal wares were super mutant body parts, bones, random animal guts, and jarred scorched limbs.  They didn't sell well but it was a fun month =)
---
PC is coming!!! Hopefully soon too! üòä
---
Idl what it does but there is an intelligence perk that raises the effectivness of stimpacks by 45%
---
Better place for the spawn anyway is near the county track area where that uhh...icecream place is north of vault 76
---
Sent you a DM. I run full Unyielding but I have no idea what you mean. Lol
---
Born survivor auto uses stimpaks
---
You should collect any blood leaf and soot flowers you come across, to make healing salve. Because trust me as a melee/unarmed player myself your always gonna be low on stimpacks.
---
Oooph I bought that helmet from a vendor awhile back, I hope that isn‚Äôt a bad thing X,D
---
In Fallout 5
---
Q1 2020
---
None yet
---
Wastelanders is being released in Q1, 2020
---
Simple. Bloodied if you're a bloodied build, furious if you're not.
---
The more people ask, the further back it‚Äôs pushed
---
Wtf is Q1
---
I really prefer 4, mostly because of the NPC dialogue and that I can pause
---
First 4 months
---
Your one of the lucky ones!! On PlayStation mainly i believe . I didn‚Äôt for a while but then the inevitable happened. Glitches on fast travel, scorchbeasts landing in my camp out of nowhere (dead), random running hits taking a chunk of life off from nothing, and the best, my personal top trump for annoyance is chucking you off the server when not long finishing setting up a farming workshop especially if you constantly have to look for gears and circuitry to set it up in the first place. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I had take a break from it before the game went out the window lol üòÜ
---
First quarter of the year I think
---
In fallout 4 junk actually makes sense, but they've really improved junk as a resource, crafting, moding and even building in 76. I would always get downvoted for saying 76 gameplay was a big improvement over fo4
---
Haven't had that no however today I was fasttravelling to do the scoutevent at camp adams and got dropped in ash heap onto a load bearing or whatever the event was. I giggled and moved on!
---
I was thinking 500 honestly...caps aren't hard to get and most people have a surplus...I've spent more than I should on stuff just to save myself the trouble of farming it. But maybe start lower and keep raising the price until they stop selling?
---
Thank you for this it means a lot!!!!
---
I think it's really telling when we can say that Fallout 76 has things we wish we had in Fallout 4. Gotta appreciate that if anything; there's some solid things going on with this controversial game!
---
I have a hard time playing Fallout 4.  Fallout 76 was my first game....yeah I'm a noob...I loved it so much I picked up Fallout 4 and quickly went back to 76.  The movement mechanics are better in 76.  The vats play in Fallout 4 is.....I can't even....it just isn't my thing.  when I pull the trigger I want it to make a gun sound.  I get the rPG nature of Fallout but it just doesn't work for me.  My brain is looking for that dopamine hit and it doesn't get it.  I literally hate it.  I'm sure I could get used to it over time and it's probably really cool.  So I'm with you on that.  76 has definitely made it hard to play fallout 4.  Plus there's the playing with friends....PVP ( hopefully it expands ) and the amazing legendary system.  I don't mind the no NPC thing, the robots and the terminals are actually really interesting to me.
---
F76 is also much different in terms of its core gameplay loop (with perhaps some elements being similar to Survival mode in FO4).  F76 is much more focused on gathering items and item management than FO4 was, simply because of the limited stash size.  I know people that gave up on F76 because they would spend 50% of their game session just managing inventory, while FO4 was more about just getting out and exploring the open-world.
---
Are you also going to the cultist secret area where the chemistry work bench is?  There's a hand full of veins in there, also spam your loot key when mining and have the harvester perk on, you might get lucky and mine twice in a row on the same vein.  Sometimes you might get 8 ores.
---
Thank you :)
---
For acid you can server hop at Toxic Larry's for the three snallygasters that spawn there - I gathered over 80 acid with four jumps two days ago
---
After reading this post and realising I have never actually checked the container inside the damn machine I got the PIE for the first time ever on the first try!!!
---
If never, do you wonder?
---
And it's all so green
---
Don't lose it
---
I've added you
---
I actually feel like the endgame for Fallout 4 was the Settlements. Once everything was said and done for the storylines, the last thing you really get into a loop for was building up your settlements. Fallout 76 is more about finding all the little nooks and crannies. Hell, I just found a scene with some garden gnomes and plastic flamingos that I had missed every single time I'd been in that area because I wasn't paying attention, and then I finally saw it and just kind laughed at the ridiculousness of it.
---
I use too much ammo in silos to make this beneficial.
---
Fallout 76 definitely made most things better, but God if I don't miss the original Quick Selection.
---
I personally preferred tapping up or whatever direction I needed, then pressing A to finalize my decision. I even preferred 3/NV just having the wheel be attached to your D-pad or whatever it was on PC
---
That is one of the things that keeps me here really. There are solid mechanics here, and they are improving the game over time. Slowly, sure, but it is a slog forward into improvement.
---
To each his own; I turned off 76 in August after playing since launch and have been playing 4 since and I've felt the opposite.
---
&gt;residential sector
---
Do you not know where this is? It's literally across the hall from the entrance. I use at most 4 bullets to gather it and go.
---
And that's perfectly fine. I never really minded not being able to pause in 76, and I do miss the NPC dialogue, but if they can really hit it out of the park with Wastelanders, or at least give us the PTS alongside Wastelanders so we can try getting fixes and bugs figured out faster for 76....Who knows. Its hard to say where the game will be come this time next year.
---
I've started to do many SBQ runs and found tons of players just leaving those plans on the floor of the Watoga station or in the suitcases around there.  I guess carrying .25lbs each plan isn't worth the caps.
---
sure is
---
Well its fine to be new to the Fallout series. It is a bit unfortunate that you couldn't get enjoyment out of 4 due to being so used to 76, though as I stated I understand why. I really enjoyed the stories and exploration aspects of 4, but the rest of the game just bogs it down compared to where we are in 76.
---
Thanks for the fast explanation, This was as ideal of an explanation as we could have gotten, even if many still are frustrated. Keep up the good work, we understand the complications and appreciate the transparency ü§ô
---
Same here honestly too haha. I still get enough Fallout enjoyment where I don't hate the game even when it crashes and runs like poop on my laptop! Things like VATS really had me wondering before playing, but I love the faster pace of it for one. Just one aspect that I can appreciate on its own!
---
Here's to seeing what they do with Wastelanders! They right there will make or break the game for most players, but I'll prolly keep playing a bit regardless haha.
---
First 3 months.
---
The first quarter of the year. First 3 months.
---
Switch to melee for collecting, that‚Äôs what I do at the munitions factory. 
---
I just made 8k 5.56 ammo yesterday, sell half for profit, keep the other for personal use and start building up your stash again. Hunting super mutants also keeps you from having to farm acid.
---
Lol, I only did one silo, and it was a while ago. I guess that's not so bad. It was annoying and I haven't had any desire to back since.
---
It works on public and private.
---
As you said, to each their own. I had put in hundreds of hours into Fallout 4, and I don't know. I just feel more enjoyment out of the time spent roaming in 76 than I do in 4 nowadays. Maybe it has something to do with wanting faster paced gameplay after how much Monster Hunter I've played in the past year or so.
---
None of the silos have workbenches immediately outside of them that I know of, so you'll be over encumbered if you do this. That said, Fallout 1st subscribers can throw down a tent to do this, and do this on a private server to avoid the crowds.
---
Since 1st hit this has become part of my daily routine.
---
I recall Skyrim having this problem for me with dragon corpses. Now on occasion I have a scorchbeast following me around during my travels. Dunno what causes this.
---
Oh yeah, there's still some controls from 4 that I'd take over 76, but as an overall whole I would agree that most things were improved upon with 76. Combat and exploration as a whole really.
---
Not the Military Wing. If you enter via the Service Entrance Head straight, past the Workbenches and Power armor stations. Modus will on your Left. That vendor will sell X-01 Mod Plans including X-01 Military Paint. Most people miss that vendor.
---
Each silo has a train station not too far from them. I just walk to it, and wham
---
Nice, thanks for clarifying. By chance could you link me the AMA? Curious to what else was asked and answered
---
Unless you go up north or down south. Then its white or black. Or red out in the south east.
---
3 months. 12/4 is 3.
---
very nice sir! congrats! a good feeling indeed!
---
of course of course!
---
I always have a 10k stash of 5.56. I have a lead extractor at my camp and do WesTec occasionally and I keep up without farming too much lead
---
Probably a good solid 7-8
---
Yeah, you can get a good 600 in a few minutes with Excavator PA and a short lead vein run east of Perv station. Smelt it up with super duper and you're g2g without having to be a General and shit
---
Huh. Ty!
---
Modern problems require modern solutions. -DC
---
Thank you for the correction
---
I meant the pip boy UI
---
If you use stealth, you won't spend many bullets. Just cross the hall, enter the weight room, grab everything, and leave. If you don't have fallout first, you'll have to walk to the nearby train station to scrap it. In all, it takes about 5-8 minutes each (all of them have a station within walking distance)
---
It's a bit of a hike when encumbered. I'll stick to using a tent.
---
It was part of the announcement, I haven't looked into the specifics, but that one point did stick with me.
---
Mines probably in the 40‚Äôs at most
---
what does "Wtf" mean?
---
I sell toilet paper for fun 10caps, sell a few rolls every week
---
You should not drop your junk when a player kills you.
---
Truthfully? Even if Wastelanders flops at first, I'm going to stick around in my on and off way. I've seen a lot of mistakes get made with 76, but they usually end up fixing them even if it takes awhile. I just hope that the majority of Wastelanders is solid enough that it makes for a promising future. That, and I really, really want to see that legendary player system.
---
This is for people that are already generals, and are familiar with the silo layouts. I've launched 15 nukes since level 27. And I'm only level 65 now.
---
Same here man. In order to scrap all junk you have to drop it and scrap it and I just didn't like that. And it just feels alot different now. I'm used to all these things we have now saddly
---
I have 2 kills. Usually I find somewhere to hide and do something on my tablet until the firestorm gets me the second time the map shrinks. That match I was doing one of the challenges for AI/NPC kills and ran into a 2 person team while I had a 50 cal machine gun.
---
I couldn't agree more, I'm not into dresses.
---
No. They‚Äôve got a separate build of the game being worked on that they‚Äôre going to implement (aka Wastelanders) that has many bug fixes in it. This makes it complex to implement those fixes to the current build as they‚Äôre already packaged and adapted for wastelanders and would need to be squashed from scratch to help us right now and be redundant when wastelanders comes. 
---
TLDR- They‚Äôre working on making big fixes compatible with wastelanders instead of wasting time fixing them now and having them break on the next update.
---
Eh, not really. It's within walking distance. Unless you're lazy like me, and hate it. But still worth it.
---
Its frustrating when you see a well stocked camp you cant visit
---
Someone finally destroyed ZAX.
---
I went back to fo4 and I've got 3 days worth of gameplay and I'm about to start a new character. It took me only a few hours to not even notice. In a lot of ways FO4 actually looks a lot better.
---
My personal "favorites" are the guys who stand in the only doorway to the Puerveyor and just idle there.
---
No way to get in.
---
ESPECIALLY onerous on discount weeks.
---
Oh yeah I'm pretty curious about that Legendary system too actually. I definitely don't think I would ever just stop playing this game if things were bad, but there's so many great other games I wanna try that I'll prolly pull back a bit more anyway. Wastelanders being great will just keep me around more often basically haha. 
---
The plans they have in store though, I'm very interested in what's gonna happen!
---
I honestly like they new system a lot after playing with it for a year. The old way feels so slow and awkward now.
---
You don‚Äôt have to do that really. When you build things, it breaks down whatever you have in the workshop.
---
it's the attention to detail that I appreciate the most.
---
Or server hop a few time just north of avr  medical is a little clothing store that has hat spawns, took me 4 tries to find it there
---
&gt;Is it a banable offense?
---
Well, on the official Bethesda Support website under the "Report Player" directory, under "Sub-Category" when reporting a player, the fourth option down is "I want to report cheating / EXPOLITING."
---
Yes. It is a banable offense.
---
not banable offense . they are using intended game mechanics to kill players.. thats like saying you cant nuke me or elase your goan get banned .. lol pvers need to stop being so salty. not only they are racist they are the most salty people on earth jesus.
---
I can't help but laugh at some of the prices I see from pvs. Friggin 2500 for the skeleton costume. Came across one that had nuke cards for 1500. Another selling tesla and grognaks for 1100... But my absolute favorite... A 1 star... ONE STAR... Nocturnal LEATHER chestpeice with zero upgrades done, mind you.... For a measly 26,000 caps. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
If I'm remembering right, junk takes up more budget than scrap in FO4.
---
When you play older Fallout versions on PC with a bunch of mods, it makes 76 much much worse by comparison. 
---
I mean the 76 ui is still pretty grim compared to fallout 3 with DarNified UI.
---
My eyes adjusted to fast VATs. It's so weird now.
---
The problem was I wanted to know how much scrap I had and of what I had. Idk why I felt the need to do that but I did. Was probably smoking some soot flowers
---
pure conjecture
---
Doing it using the drop and scrap method is how people beat the budget. It gets dangerous. You can make settlements that crash the game if you go too crazy with it.
---
Yeah I noticed it to, the door looks broken.
---
Ur mom
---
Now I know why you didn't want to answer. You just didn't want to say "nothing has been added".
---
Sad, but I understand that.
---
Well, we had an actual Bethesda community manager reply to this topic to say that yes, it is an exploit, and it wasn't intended by the devs. So you're wrong. You'll have to find another way to try and justify your bad behavior.
---
Not really, alcohol is everywhere
---
I had similar issues when New Vegas came out. I litterally cannot play Fallout 3 due to the many changes they made and how similar, yet still clunky and bad 3 feels compared to NV. I love the storyline and world of 3 but those small changes like iron sights and ammo types, among other things, make 3 unplayable as I get frustrated with the lack of functionality.
---
Sure, I was just adding another way, dude. It's easier unless you got a scrap box tent and General status
---
It all depends on the player, their build, and what they have. You may have your way, other player have theirs. I'm just adding another way for people to try.
---
The plan can drop from pretty much any Savage Divide event, not just Uranium Fever.
---
What is "Ur"? You don't even know my mom, silly
---
50 cal- great all around gun, decent range, excellent damage and rof, relatively cheap ammo, only 2 possible mods (hvy barrel, prime receiver), IF you go Bloodied.Gatling is great for lower end mobs, high damage, sips ammo.
---
No one can see your boxes but you either. If you jump up on it it looks to everyone else like you're standing in mid air
---
They changed that, now they only drop from Savage Divide events and you can't buy them from MODUS either.
---
ultracite is GOAT
---
I have a food build, so I don't use lead
---
We all know her. She's a wonderful lady.
---
Run the Vault 94 Raid.  Get Bulk Ammo materials as a reward for finishing each stage.
---
I sell instruments: Steel Guitar, Accordion, Harmonica, and Violin are the only ones I've found so far though.
---
I was playing 4 when my internet was down for a few days and whenever I'd use VATS in it, it almost felt like cheating. I also found myself crouching in bushes whenever I'd have to go away from the game for a moment before remembering I could just pause it.
---
I used to love FO4;  but 76 has really dealt a deathblow to the immersion quality of it for me.
---
I hear more about the raider plans than bos shielded.  Are they harder to find that the bos  versions?
---
One of the most annoying things, one of the many many bugs that makes the game tedious and lame.
---
That's not why I didn't want to answer.
---
The US Enclave we have a pvp group and rp elements.
---
Try an instigating shotgun that's what I used for quite a long time before switching to a commando build. It's a viable build but you need to perk properly and need to be up close. Shot gunners perks, enforcer  scattershot is good as well.
---
I know people will sometimes send game invites to random people on the server they are on to help friends get on. If they accept the invitation it makes them leave the server long enough for people in queue to join.
---
Kinda shitty, but i hear it works.
---
Weights are heavy! Specifically for how much lead you get from them. Making lots of ammo hinges around acid. Everything else (lead,-lucky hole,steal-guns, cloth-prewar money, pillows teddy bears, was rags, cigarettes,oven mitts, ect) is easier to come by in bulk.
---
So sorry i asked a question
---
Do treasure maps - pretty sure it‚Äôs the Savage Divide ones.  Gotten 2 so far both from treasure maps.
---
Watoga doesn't spawn legendary robots anymore.  You will sometimes get a super mutant that is legendary.
---
What's the fascination with Two Shot, It makes the weapon have lower accuracy, the second bullet comes out at like a 45 degree angle. Rather use Furious or even Mutant's lol
---
Well that sucks, how about white spring? Did the legendary spawn rate get nerfed
---
Turn on pacifist mode?
---
I like the two shot
---
oh man, I've been just holding onto treasure maps across all 4 of my characters since BETA, I got something to do tonight!!! woohoo
---
lmao no. and nothing will be fixed . 
---
she did the automated reply taht they are fwording to the devs. the dvs are not goan do anything about it because its working as intended. xD
---
I have one of you're on PC. I don't really use it much. PM me and maybe we can work something out.
---
IMO, Murmurgrr is your best chance. So scrip is your target, Uranium Fever. Watoga is specifically nerfed for legendary spawns. For random farming I suggest giving Charleston capital building a try, all high lvl ghouls now, plus all the usual(whitespring, Wes Tek) Don't forget SBQ for a good chance with the adds!
---
Certainly farming for raw materials is the main way but I buy lots of my supplies from vendor bots. If they have 3 bulk acid buy it,  bulk lead buy it etc. The one thing I never seem to run out of is caps so I buy every scrap of lead, acid, etc I can find. Also perk cards ammo smith 2 and super duper
---
Same thing happened to me... but now I feel better knowing it's not a bug... Well I hope it always did give a plan -.-
---
You're mad someone killed you after you initiated PVP?  You even submitted a ticket? Someone here is a cunt and it isn't the guy that took your shit.
---
I frankly only miss cheating! I hate the whole issue of ammo! I just cheated for ammo in Fallout 4. No cheating in 76!! Well not for me anyway...
---
Oh... Well that's fine, but why?
---
I went simple on FO4. Polished heavy metal armor along with the sword and helmet from creation club.
---
There is a system in place. It's called pacifists mode
---
Hate to be a dick but turn on pacifist mode.....and never take it off. Simple
---
Opposite is true for me. Fallout 4 is so much smoother, so much more responsive, so much.more polished. It's actually a (mostly) finished game. Fallout 76, I feel I should apologize to my console for running the game.
---
There‚Äôs a guide do a search for it - very easy to follow though some mounds are a little harder to spot.  I‚Äôve been buying maps 50 and under when I see them.
---
I just seem to have more success with it, even If it is trash I enjoy using it, plus I feel sorta cool cause I have only ever gotten one two shot weapon before
---
The game does not support any mods for obvious reasons an attempting to use mods most likely will result in an automatic ban, pretty sure the system will see it as a cheat
---
I would love one but I‚Äôm not on pc unfortunately, but thank you for the offer I really appreciate it
---
I play with 5 regularly on xbox (mostly playing on s model), and none of us have this problem.
---
I think it has to do with a West Virginian superstition that a red star on houses or barns would ward off the snallygaster. Very appropriate in this game I would say so myself.
---
This is exactly why I am shocked that Bethesda didn't just go back and release a polished Fallout 3. It would've been released a decade after the initial launch of Fo3 and could've been a massively positive experience for both fallout fans and Bethesda. 
---
We've already seen this happen with Capcom's Resident Evil 2 revitalization. RE2 was so successful that Capcom is working on "modernizing" RE3.
---
IMO Bloodied commando does really well all around. I will have to post my N&amp;D sheet and armor/weapon specs when I get home.
---
The thing about it is you can dial it back for group events when you don't want to do max damage, or you can turn it up to 11 and drop level 80 scorchbeasts in 4 shots (with an automatic rifle). You can also swap out a bunch of "food build" cards for general wandering and still be more powerful than most full health builds.
---
No real downsides other than watch your rads in high rad areas. The rad resist backpack makes that really easy though.
---
She no longer scales to # of people, that's straight old school!
---
76 also has a lot of combat improvements which makes the gameplay more fluid. Fallout 4 feels a tad sluggish by comparison.
---
Not sure what the actual lore is, but my guess it's one of those decorative Americana style tin stars. My house irl has one, just not red
---
Now go back and play 3/NW lol. 
---
I've been playing Skyrim on the Switch so no mods, and the QOL improvements between that generation and 4 are huge, especially with crafting. I mostly ignored it in previous games because of how time consuming it was.
---
What‚Äôs SBQ?
---
good laugh
---
No, you can block someones camp from loading on public servers with it. Good times
---
The Harpoon scales with Lock and Load. Prioritize that over %dmg perks.
---
The Broadsider is technically an explosive weapon, so it scales with Demo Expert. Grenadier and Lock and Load are must haves. Yes, a QFF Broadsider is best without Multishot.
---
You generally can get the lead out of a silo with only firing a couple of bullets or if sneaking, none at all.
---
I feel the same way. I'm so used to 76 building mechanics now, it's hard to build settlements now in 4.
---
If that's a true superstition that is amazing attention to detail
---
Scorchbeast Queen, you gotta nuke fissure site prime in the bottom right of the map to spawn her
---
Yeah, I saw it was wickedychicady or whatever guide, I think. I did some forest ones awhile ago, it was underwhelming stuff
---
.... https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76
---
The hatred of reddit got real. Here's an upvote friend. And which one do you have lol
---
She only drops one legendary and it seems like a lot just to get one legendary

Im farming the lead only. Steel, acid, cloth i got from trades. I also did some trades for violet fluxes to get a pretty large stock. Ammosmith and Duper are essential. In my last crafting session, i used 9000 gunpowder, 7500 lead, 30000 steel, 500 violet and ultracite scrap, and got exactly 211600 rounds of ultracite .50cal ammo.
---
Forest is a waste of time - the good plans come from the other areas.
---
I've only ever gotten TSE pipe weapons and an SMG lol, they're ok I guess. Maybe VATS would make them better, but my shooting is all over the place otherwise. If you're not hitting with both bullets you're doing like 63% damage :(
---
Good old Ivan. Gotta play JA2 again, it's been a while.
---
Only active.
---
Best chance now is hopping around to fissure sites for legendary scorchbeasts, or farming the queen fight.
---
My main point was just agreeing with OP. Without changing anything, the default UI in vanilla 4 is vastly inferior to that in 76
---
Unfortunately you are right, but the ‚Äúarmored‚Äù raider gas mask still works with the Prisoner‚Äôs Collar
---
I just got griefed today like this at the little airport northeast of Charleston, they were roaming in a pack of two or three. They didn't show up on the map and they each tried taking me out, I took two out then the third got me. One of the griefers had two accounts of the same name but at different levels so he followed me onto another server.  
---
I'm tempted to share the fucker's username, provided I can still find it on the social tab.
---
Ooops sorry my mistake. I forgot that the snallygaster myth is not native to West Virginia, but Central Maryland and DC. But the superstition with the star still applies.
---
bring a lot of bullets
---
Me too. Guess it makes their customer satisfaction stats for this month look really good. ‚úåÔ∏è
---
I believe it is a reward for doing the AVS medical center part of the main quest, you get a plan to make it and rad X... Theres glowing fungus everywhere
---
Yoooo, I get hyped af during those scenes
---
It‚Äôs good to do on top of hitting the other gyms in the game (jail, hotel, fire station, VTU).
---
Yeah, I think I read the PA plans are only Savage Divide, Mire and Bog
---
My TSE handmade got thrown in my stash once i found an Instigating +10% damage while aiming handmade.
---
Even my AAE handmade is even better than my TSE.
---
Lol have a vote for midas or eden
---
Yeah I heard you‚Äôre not supposed to use Vats cause of the accuracy nerf
---
Yeah there's no penalty for not doing it though. In 4 it really kicked your ass for either not resting enough or resting too much.
---
strangler heart pa + b/ex gatling laser or plasma can solo sbq
---
Systems, QoL updates, and honestly a ton of assets from 76 I'd love to see ported over to 4. For example, I personally loved building in the settlements in 4, so all of the new CAMP assets I'd love to see ported over (especially since I can't afford to buy every Atom store item). But if Bethesda ported the assets through the Creation Club, they'd be out of my price range. And modders can't port them because of copyright issues.
---
I'm at level 18 on fallout 4.  I still feel a little lost and the combat system makes me feel claustrophobic in comparison.  I am a pretty avid COD player though so that probably explains my discomfort with the VATS in Fallout 4.  76 though is an amazing system for me, especially when I feel like being casual.  I almost think of it like I'm an active participant in an action movie.
---
Keep an eye on the additional mobs, usually get 1 to 3 extra legendaries. While not on topic, the stable flux and repair kits can help out in your overall quest for more 3*!
---
Strangler PA or legacy Gatling plasma will make it an easy solo.  If not it‚Äôs still doable but not ammo efficient.  Use a bloodied swing speed weapon and whack at her would be better than blowing thousands of rounds.
---
Antiarmor sounds good too, I have a mutant slayers explosive, I just don‚Äôt want one that‚Äôs based off of adding damage to a specific type of enemies
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnstar
---
same here they asked me for proof of purchase then no reply
---
Thank you for the advice, I‚Äôll make sure to look out for them
---
Captainnoob on youtube has started a queentested series where he takes on the queen solo. Might be worth watching. 
---
Or angryturtle also has one on youtube, but it's a stealth commando build
---
I was about to post the same, AAE is way better.  That's why I retired my TSE Handmade long ago.
---
Lmao, you would "like" it to be working as intended. Because you are probably one of the assholes doing it. You know damn well that it wasn't "intended" that we be able to kill non-hostile players in their own house with a portable radiation source. 
---
They'll make it so that mines don't detonate on proximity to non-hostiles some patch down the road. Better stroke your griefing jollys good and hard before they take that away from you!
---
If I‚Äôm gonna buy weapons from Murmgh should I buy 2 star or three star guns?
---
I've been experimenting with this. I can typically use most F4 textures because the filepaths are the same for 76. Some mods cause immediate CTDs, so you have a way of knowing what ports easy and what doesn't.. I am not sure exactly what variable causes it.
---
You should be aware that 76 uses a different lighting engine, so certain mods will produce deviant results. One such I used was SavrenX creatures pack. Most creatures used the mod, but the Mutant hounds retained their vanilla head textures and had super dark, bugged body textures - leading to mix matched skin.
---
You should be able to just delete the problem files from the .ba2 with Archive2
---
PS - the lock pick menu replacers work like a dream, requiring only to be packaged in a custom .ba2 file. The one I use got darkened, but I prefer this bug to vanilla.
---
I don't have any non whites in this, but in FO4 where I'm not limited to only 5 characters I have a couple.
---
With enough bullets, but be careful about getting killed, she can sometimes get full health back, if you lose her agro and she goes out of combat.
---
It screws up the accuracy of both shots though.  Long range is crap on a TSE handmade, I land way more shots with my AAE Handmade.
---
Ok ill add you and show you what a real PvP build looks like.handmade or teslas chameleon or no chameleon .
---
If you're on PS4, I have a recipe I'll give you free and 170 RadAways in my vending machine for 5 cps a piece.... I'll be on around 7... DM me if you're interested.
---
try firefox
---
Nope, doesn't work for me. I tried these kind of shenanigans when first discovering this.
---
That is why I carry 250 stimpacks
---
I got them all really cheap from player vendors lol.
---
Sometimes luck is luck
---
Not that I've ever known.
---
If you like action/adventure, 76 does so many things right to keep things moving.
---
I played a low health build in Fo4, and jumped back for a bit back in early September.  The most glaring difference to me between the two games is raw damage output.  76 allows you to synergize more effects that really makes you into a killing machine.  The enemies are also bigger and tougher in 76 too.  I was messing around in the glowing sea and it felt like danger-lite compared to 76.  A pack of 3-4 radscorpions isn‚Äôt much of a big deal, while that would be a hell of a fight in 76.
---
I also like how the 76 perk system forces you to consider your build more.  You can‚Äôt just keep gaining perks until you can do everything.
---
https://mysteriousuniverse.org/2015/06/strange-mysteries-of-the-appalachian-mountains/
---
I think it's just a standard term for "someone was shooting at me" anymore. I mean, I suck at and don't like PvP, but geez.
---
 I hit twice as hard. I can melt the Golf Club with my Combat Knives, the entire horde all at once. ;)
---
Nah it replaces armor and outfits

Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Toxic valley has Raider PA ones if I recall right.  Ash heap has excavator mod plans.  My Raider and T45 is far from complete - T51/T60 was easier.
---
Do not attempt to grind for one specific legendary combo for one specific weapon. You will be disappointed with how long RNGesus can hold out on you. Head over the the market and try to buy one for 10k-15k cap range. Will be easier to get if you have decent tradebait to offer.
---
Most of the masses have moved on from TSE, so you will eventually find someone who wants to sell theirs. Bloodied, junkie or AA explosive all generally do better damage. I ran a TSE handmade for a while, it was fun and did decent damage but the condition reduces like twice as fast. So be prepared to fix it a lot, use weapon artisan for 200% repair and possibly run high level gunsmith perk to keep it running longer.
---
This is poetry.
---
Ugh.  No.
---
I didn't want to answer because I'm tired of seeing the question pop up here multiple times a day.  I wish you motherfuckers would take the time to use the goddamn search bar.
---
I'm the guy who wrote the Returning Wiki for this game because I was tired of seeing people come here multiple times a day asking if the game was worth buying or returning to.  Me.  I wrote that long spiel because I was tired of people coming here and repeating the same fucking question without looking at all of the other threads already here about it.
---
It makes no sense for people to come in and expect the group to explain TO THEM INDIVIDUALLY something that has been explained dozens of times already.  Use the search bar.  
---
A friend and I used to host a forum where we hacked files for one of the old WWE games.  We made a program for it and gave it away free of charge.  People would come in and ask the same thing every day.  How do I do this, how do I do that, I'm having this problem, I'm having that problem.  The first couple of weeks, fine.  But after that, the forum was full of the same fucking thread over and over and over again because people could not be arsed to search for the answer to their questions.  They wanted us to stop what we were doing so we could spoon feed them the information that was already right there in front of them if they'd bother to look at it.
---
We started banning people and locking them out of the software when they asked stuff that was in the FAQ.  Those were the good old days.
---
Camera...
---
Well I can‚Äôt do that, I can try for a different variant but there‚Äôs no way I can make that many caps.
---
ugh,, yes
---
Good tip!!
---
never worried about tagging me, grateful but seems like the message was deleted, whats up?
---
You put a red star over your door so god doesn't kill your first born son.
---
interesting, and thanks for the info!...  
---
Will have to look at both locations to see if they have "exceptions" written in like Uranium Fever, but as a rule they are both coded differently than the other similar NPC's, missing the keywords and other things to allow them by default to become legendary
---
That happens because the bugged spawn point is an "Ambush" type spawn. The creature is bugged just like the naked, headless ghouls at the golf club. They didn't fix the ash/goo pile bug.
---
I want the Meat Cleaver as a one handed melee weapon instead of a throwable.
---
Some things might be improved with 76 but 4 is so smooth. Enter and exit your power armour in each game and tell me which is more fluid and normal. Hell, do _anything_ and it's as smooth as butter on 4. No constant processing delays/lag in everything we've all gotten used to over time, like bringing up the pip-boy, using benches, even _scrolling menus_ after depositing or withdrawing an item aren't incredibly laggy like in 76. You can't say that isn't better. If we're talking pure gameplay/interface I'd take the FO4 junk system over 76 lag any day of the week.
---
Out of curiosity, what QOL changes besides auto scrapping do you think were implemented into 76?
---
I haven‚Äôt played FO4 in a while but I don‚Äôt remember anything as tedious as shifting perk cards or intense inventory management. I‚Äôve been thinking of doing another play through of FO4 before wastelanders comes out.
---
Perv sales are probably the best. Just mow through westek, harpers ferry, WS, anywhere really. Do uranium fever, awol armaments, hell even leader of the pack and get your 150 scrip daily, hang around 900 or so and go crazy on the sales. 
---
Sometimes players even sell shit legendaries for cheap, buy em up, scrip em and roll at the Perv
---
Well you can try doing those legendary runs you mention to start with and then sell all the junk and non legendary weapons to vendors each day. West tek will get you a lot of weapons if you are okay with crawling overencumbered to a train station to sell them. You can make 1,400 caps per day easily. Use Unyielding armor if you have any to increase charisma at low health which will increase selling price, or grape mentats.
---
30 entire minutes!? how on earth did you survive, longest ive gone is 4 at most
---
It's funny that everytime I play another shooter I press the vats button to find enemies from a far. For me giving a sense of where the enemy really is, is more important than the auto aim itself.
---
Ah man I just got up to pee, I'm not sure.  Haven't played in about 45 seconds.  Hopefully someone else can answer.
---
Its easy, i do it all the time
---
It‚Äôs just the rate of only 1400 caps a day, that‚Äôs only 9,800 caps a week and that‚Äôs not even enough for a mutation serum.
---
I get what people are saying but I just wish they would change what the perk card puts first with stimpaks bc with a bloodied build it is a complete waste to use a normal stimpak on myself but the card wants to use those first. I only keep myself at 20% health but normal stimpaks heal me for 75% of my total health. So it basically wastes it
---
How?
---
That‚Äôs strange bc after 76, fallout 4 has gotten better to me
---
Got my first one from watoga the other day.  Pretty neat-o
---
In a lot of ways, this is what Bethesda does with their games.  They refine aspects from previous games that were fun and well liked, while also trying a whole bunch of new crap.  Some of it is indeed crap, which gets junked in future iterations, but some of it is good and they incorporate that as part of the on-going evolution.
---
You could do that in FO4 though? Or are you talking about Survival mode? If you are you might as well be comparing Survival and regular mode then
---
No if you were inside an internal cell (building, etc), you would have to exit the building to fast travel somewhere else.
---
Go for three
---
CAMPS definitely fuck up cell resets. You want to be further away.  This happens to Random Encounter triggers as well. I hear mixed results about this, so I'm thinking it's about having objects placed onto specific spots. The trigger itself gets bulldozed just like the grass/trees do.
---
Got it
---
A few other areas you can try are Huntersville and Generals steakhouse both can be a hit or miss with 1- 2 legendary supermutants, the farm just south of the watoga station with the  mirelurk queen queen 1-2 mirelurk or mire kings can spawn legendary. Also north of west tek the isolated radio array legendary supermutants will spawn inside and on the roof of the main building and in the garage in the back
---
There is a Chinese Stealth Suit mod that can fix this for you in FO4. But other than that, yeah I feel ya. Lol
---
Cool thanks, are you on Xbox? I could use a teammate
---
Order of Mysteries... One of the best quests/stories of all the Fallout games.
---
Try moving camp further away.
---
30 minutes, a month, a year... It's still October 23rd 2102
---
Username checks out
---
I quit playing six years ago should I come back??
---
Which is really odd. Stuff like this triggers conspiracy theories in me
---
But you don't need a mutation serum recipe, you just need a TSE handmade. Don't buy junk you don't need from vendors, set a budget and start saving. Lol. 
---
If you are looking for an easy place to start grinding crap to sell for caps I would go after mole miners at blackwater mine. Fairly easy to kill and half decent weapons to sell. Don't forget to cook their meat to glowing meat steaks for more to sell. It's real close to whitesprings station for quick an easy selling too.
---
What builds do you use to drop the scorched beast queen and perks
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter which way I do it, the point is is that I can only make a max of 1400 caps and maybe some from missions and such
---
Sounds like you wasted your time, brother.
---
Also the penitentiary has 200+ lbs or lead weights
---
Just sell stuff you have lol, you got.flux you dont need? Sell it for 100.to.125 caps a piece, got a weapon that you dont use that is legendary? See how much you could sell it to someone, always hot your 1400 vendor cap
---
Still waiting for it to load my fast travel, think I'll go make a coffee
---
They use the nautical star out here to represent NorCal, It appears to mean a number of things though
---
So should I make like posts or stuff offering flux?
---
"If Bethesda doesn't do something really stupid with mods" like make them cost Atoms, for example? I can honestly see that happening.
---
Huh?? Havent heard anything about it not working
---
And in 8-11 days you should have enough caps to buy the item you want and just need to find someone to do the deal. Nearly non-stop legendary grinding plus scripping all the junk legendaries and spending at purveyor will not get you the exact gun you want faster than that.
---
Auto scrapping like you mentioned, fast travel inside of building interiors, a large number of changes to how the pip boy inventory/status/quest menus are organized, the favorites wheel, having a key too switch between your last two equipped weapons, and a key for stim packs for quick healing. The last few are more specific to console rather than pc but those are ones I can think of off the top of my head
---
On a marketplace fo76 reddit yes, i got a few friends who make lots of caps that way
---
oh man. you quit playing eight yrs before wastelanders?
---
I consider low caps 5k because I'm always on the lookout for that good armor piece or gun someone has for sale, and want to be able to buy it. I rarely buy stuff from vendorbots
---
Furiouse procs per pellet. So with a shout gun you'd pretty close to maxed out after your first shot
---
I can't play call of duty I'm always throwing grenades damn vats got to me
---
They're probably busy closing duplicate tickets.
---
atomic shop added broken images to some of the items
---
Yep delusional
---
How is this an exploit? The nuke mine is working as intended, not to mention that it only works if you stand still. Therefore, anyone who is complaining about this is probably AFKing, which I believe has gotten people 72 hour suspensions. Honestly in Bethesda's eyes, you're in the wrong.
---
did you follow it around release at all??
---
Ha no worries. Just the marine suit. I got it the day this was posted so was excited that maybe I found something special
---
depends mostly. do you want batteries, bullets, or both?
---
Some people, myself included, intentionally do not complete the Brotherhood quest. We would need to obtain the Ultracite plans through other means. The Ultracite plans also weren't always available through the Defiance terminal. They added that in an early update and probably never changed the SBQ drops.
---
215 BEFORE targets resistances are taken into account
---
She did that to me the first time I joined a SBQ fight. That character was melee and as soon as she landed I ran up and hit one of her back legs with a super sledge. She turned to try and hit me, I took another step around her to hit her back leg again. Repeat that for the entire battle while every other player shot at her from a nearby roof.
---
Lady Janet's? Never had any luck there
---
.50 cal is probably the best Heavy Weapon right now. LMG and Gatling Plasma or Laser are also good.
---
The mutations are a dope addition. Plus the weapon/item wheel makes a big difference. But I mostly like the Handmade and random base building locations lol
---
Yeah. Must be real convenient for them though. You have to write the message in notepad, rush through the support process and paste your text in before it refreshes.
---
Vffr flamers are great up close. Ulrtacite gats, and  v ex miniguns are nice as well.
---
Same here. Everyday we have 1 or 0 cap sales. I also keep a level 1 hazmat suit, level 20 BOS sniper, and Fixer in stock for 5 caps. So far only sub 40 players have purchased these 5 cap items.
---
I've not long started a brand new Fallout 4 playtrough with some of the new CC content and am having a blast. I'm going for a 100% game with a playstyle I've never done in any Fallout; a max charisma character. Gonna need all those caps for unique items. While funnily enough I have crashed and frozen more in the last few days than I have in months of 76 I am finding 4 more engaging. I think its the permanence, when I clear a raider camp it's empty for a while. Build something at a settlement and it stays there. Same with perks really. I hate being able to change perks in 76. Doesn't feel like I'm building a character if I can change him whenever. That's not to say there aren't things I miss from 76, things I would gladly pay for too get officially added into Fallout 4. Guess I'll list them bellow.  
---
.Weapon, armor and ammo crafting from scratch. I never understood why this wasn't in the game to start with. Give Tinker Tom a tinkereres workbench Bethesda.   
---
.The ability to collect power armor frames (though I've modded in this exact feature).  
---
.Constructible and playable musical instruments with the well tuned bonus effect. It just adds much needed interaction between your character and the world.  
---
.Similarly resource nodes, ore veins and resource extraction machines. Smelting at chem benches as well.   
---
.Mutations. Enough said there.  
---
.The ability to breakdown anything at any bench. I've found myself trying to do this several times.  
---
.Lets throw in brewing drinks and alcohol, though I guess in 4 I can make coffee and donuts...  
---
.My scrap bot. He'd still be less annoying than Ada and collect more than those useless scavenger stations.   
---
.Finally a range of 76's weapons, I miss my pump action.
---
Not that particular, I‚Äôm currently running a TSE Gatling gun with a AA Gatling plasma/beam splitter.
---
Absolutely! I dont play all that differently than I did in FO4. I don't normally coop or play online either but I've had more good experiences doing so than bad ones! Only got griefed once ever. Met quite a few cool people though
---
Sounds like me when my nipples are all over my nutsack
---
hi
---
Fallout 76 has something that I've been missing from day one in Fallout 4: Do your own blueprints for your buildings to be able to replicate then
---
Thing about the LMG is it eats through bullets insanely fast.
---
You can still kill players in Godmode... I did this over the weekend. He was pretty surprised! We also redecorated his camp and his teammate's camp since they insisted on remaining aggro'd with us. The camps now have a more "open-air" design. It's always nice to get fresh air flowing over those empty floorboards.
---
Just get a AA FFR 50 cal, works great at all ranges.
---
You can still kill them even with Godmode ;)
---
I use a gatling gun, 50 cal, and a gatling plasma mostly. I carry an LMG as well for when something needs to be instantly deleted.
---
It‚Äôs the Same deal as with the display cases
---
Well i run a heavy weapons build the best mob killer is a bloodied explosive plasma gatling. The be lmg is also another. Tbh every heavy gun is brilliant. But a close range heavy weapon you should have your eyes on a bffr for close quarter combat because explosives do splash damage. I'd recommend a bffr/be .50 cal or LMG and work your way from there.
---
Yeah that would go great with the bloody chef outfit and hat.
---
Yeah, tell me about it, I have a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate one...
---
Wow a lot of responses, thanks for the recommendations.
---
im actually thinking of just making a mod to make fallout 4 easier for 76 players to settle in to
---
Beam splitter on the Gatling plasma IMO isn't very good. it takes to long to melt enemies. for that one i personally use the beam focuser, allowing the higher damage per shot. for short range id recommend the flamer.. once you have streamlined fuel farming or fuel making. if you want ease of ammo the Gatling laser is nice, especially with power user (do not use charging barrels, they are bad). .50 cal is a nice all rounder as well as the Gatling gun (50 &gt; Gat. Gun) LMG with the right setup can be fun. but ammo production may be a little hard.
---
Well I personally want PVP to be a fair fight, otherwise there is no challenge and my victory would be worthless. Winning only because my opponent is weaker, unprepared and doesn't even want to fight would make me feel pathetic, not superior.
---
We are in a wasteland, where raiders caused the doom of everyone that survived the bombs including  themselves, we've been neighbors in a vault for 25 years, our mission is to work together and rebuild America. If you prefer to kill your former neighbors you are a deranged maniac and a disappointment to the overseer.
---
Lore aside, we are in an multiplayer online environment where you can DECIDE if you want to enrich the experience of the people you meet or if you want to worsen their experience. You choose the latter for whatever reason.
---
And this is the dev, the game, and the sub that needs a white knight. Just kidding, that perk card is bugged too just like the rest of this game.
---
They are using it to kill non hostile low-health players at workbenches. You can't get away fast enough or even use your hotkeyed rad-away when you are stuck in the bench animation and menus. We already had a Community Manager say that this is an exploit, and that they are looking into it. Ambient radiation hurting everyone IS working as intended. Mines detonating on proximity to non-hostile players, allowing you to harass or kill non-combatants with portable radiation, is not. It has a pretty easy fix, too: set the mines to only detonate on proximity to hostiles.
---
According to the definition of an "exploit", Bethesda's own support website, and confirmation from a community manager, I am correct about this. Don't know how much more solid my argument can be without dragging Pete himself to your doorstep to tell you in person...
---
Which would be hilarious. But I don't feel like going to jail.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how realistic you‚Äôre trying to go with this build, but the Bowie knife wasn‚Äôt around until the 19th century. Also, katanas existed at the time, but they probably didn‚Äôt have flaming gas canisters attached to them so I don‚Äôt know if the shishkebab is fitting for this role play lol. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure about the disease cures either, most medieval medicines were made of various herbs and spices, which is basically what the disease cures in this game are, but it just seems too easy to eliminate diseases with them. I think it would be more realistic to just suffer with dysentery for a while.
---
Regardless of how you end up doing it though it‚Äôs an interesting idea and I might have to try it out myself on PS4.
---
I have one set for a Supernatural display. Along with a beer, salt and shotgun shell. Also put a cultist blade on the wall for The First Blade
---
Something like this happened to me a few weeks ago. A player bought something from my vendor, pretended to drop a gift for me (after they gave me the heart emote), and then threw a nuke mine at me as I was checking what was in the bag. I didn't have much HP (as I was running a bloodied build topped up with rads) so I quit the game (on PC) before it could do too much damage. 
---
Now I know what to expect I'll wear PA or a Hazmat suit depending on what I'm doing! There's no way the rad damage will do much then lol
---
My statement is still facts, the game does not support any mods. That doesn't mean that there's not any but don't be surprised when your account is terminated for messing with files.
---
Yeah I'll probably remove the more modern weapons melee weapons and the shiskebab haha
---
But that's what I was thinking with the disease cure since it's made from plants. 
---
I've gotten to level 20 and it's been a fun journey :)
---
All my alcohol moves like crazy, including all the beers.
---
I also sell a lot of minor foods (ie gum drops).
---
So it's not enough that the account in question showed the purchase? I get the request for identification for said account, but for purchase, when done through BGS site? 
---
Raging? LOL You wish it was Karen so you can write it off as a Rant.  It's about a continued sting of issues that could have been easily avoided.
---
I soloed the queen last night with my lmg. I did notice a small difference, but still managed to solo her in 5 minutes on a private server
---
There is this mod that changes VATS to bullet time, and you can make it insanely overpowered, lasting a long time and slowing time to a halt etc. I used that for a quicksilver build and it was as fun as it sounds.
---
It's some interesting points. I knew posting this would get the response it did. But, it did get my Atoms in a short period. Hopefully, others will met your PC views and standards.
---
There is also a bug that I have been encountering since launch that I call the over encumbered respawn bug.  If your carry weight is above your default carry weight, there is a chance that whenever you respawn, the UI will not get the memo and prompt you to respawn even though you have already been spawned back into the world.  What this means is that you cannot move or do anything other than fast travel.  In addition, you can be attacked by enemies and nearby enemies can stop fast travel.  If you have a backpack, this tends to happen more often as it artificially increases your carry capacity and you are more often over your default.  Sometimes, you can only respawn at Vault 76 or at a friend.  However, the worst scenario is whenever you are over encumbered.  If you are over encumbered before you die or over encumbered after you die due to unyielding armor losing effectiveness, you will likely be unable to respawn at all due to being "over encumbered.". In this situation, the only options are to have someone lure enemies to you and kill you so that you can attempt to respawn again(might work or might bug out again) or just leave the server, giving up on any junk you lost or event you were doing.  I have even had several times where I spawned a Scorchbeast Queen only to have to leave the server because of this bug.  It seems to happen more often if you are trying to respawn near where you died and it often happens when the game auto-respawns you at an event.  I encounter this bug almost everyday as it is very easy to reproduce.  I hope that you can let the dev team know about this game breaking bug.  Thank you.

Wow it looks like you encountered someone abusing the laser tripwire disarm glitch üòÇ
---
No idea here. I had purchased the year subscription. I do know at least one monthly user that had to put in a ticket to get his points.
---
Cool, glad you‚Äôre having fun with it. It does sound like it would be a good time and an interesting way to play. I‚Äôve been looking for an excuse to start a new character so this may be the thing that finally convinces me to do it.
---
lasers are only good with explosive
---
begin your own modded weapons store with scopes, become a weapon dealer better than the USA
---
Happens to me alot on ps4 now. Horrid when you have to fix a gun during Queen and game freezes. No one seems to be talking about this bug though...
---
Quarter 1, it represents the first 3 months of the year, have you seriously never heard of this term before?  It‚Äôs used all the time in finance ‚ÄúSales were down for this quarter‚Äù
---
or...
---
dont die
---
Delusional. That would be incredibly OP
---
Seconded what this guy said, most wars aren't won by giving your opponent a fair fight that's just stupidity. You win consistently by giving yourself every advantage over your opponent. Winning a fair fight doesn't matter the winners write history.
---
I really don‚Äôt like the build menus of fallout 4. 76 is so much easier to find stuff and there is just more stuff in general though I miss all the dlc pieces and stuff
---
Not what I expected, lol. I personally am not a fan of blooded/junkies, simply because I don‚Äôt need the damage or the downsides.
---
sneak/vats with ranged weapons
---
Ok wise guy. You have a Switchblade and some healing salves. Go run all theee pylons and take on the assaultron head on. When you can do it without dying you can act cocky. Because I have done it. I can do many things you‚Äôll never be able to do. So go out there, and kill a Scorchbeast in 5 swings with only a Switchblade
---
Can I just add that the Gatling Gun is extremely accurate when using Stabilized, and the armor penetration from Stabilized is not to be passed up for any weapon. Armor penetration = straight damage vs. a lot of enemies. It becomes very obvious very fast that lots of enemies don't have nearly as much health as they have armor.
---
Super mutants, on the other hand...
---
Now hear me out here, i feel like a plus should always have a minus to go with it.
---
As well as that normal scorchbeasts can spawn as legendaries now, so the ones that spawn in during the event sometimes can potentially drop legendaries
---
maybe he is against nukes
---
Now that‚Äôs funny!
---
Did you have anything in mind
---
Get a cryolator
---
Never tried one, good for up close?
---
Thats with every new game in a franchise young blood. Fallout 4 ruined Fallout 3 for me. Can‚Äôt go back to playing that shit, its so hard. Same with Skyrim, it ruined Oblivion for me.
---
I don't know if I'd call this an exploit or necessarily a bad thing. There are some times that you really need to be able to kill another player, especially since this only works for a player standing still for a long time. One thing I would caution against is making players completely immortal by nerfing everything. While it's great to allow players to choose to decline PvP, that luxury can be abused. Here are 2 examples:
---
A bunch of friends and I found Graham, and one of them had been looking for him for hours. Unfortunately, a little jerk decided he would just hog Graham. With 6 other people waiting for over 15 minutes, it became clear that this guy was just another form of griefer. While everyone else was politely communicating and taking turns, this guy was not. Fortunately, someone managed to escort him to the ground, and everyone happily got to buy from Graham again! If this guy had been allowed to abuse his immortality, hours of hard work would have been lost, and 6 people would have been griefed by an abuse of Pacifist mode. 
---
Another example would be that one of my older, retired friends had a ton of loot on him. Though a little naive, he is a kind soul and didn't deserve any of this. After an event, one of his teammates accidentally shot me. It is common for griefers to attempt to rob people after such events, and as a policy, I fight off the griefers to make them reconsider their life choices. In this case, my Gun Fu was on, and I accidentally wiped out the entire team by firing back at the one guy. I grabbed all of their loot to return it to them, except for the loot of my older friend, which seemed to have vanished. Replaying the video of the event, I saw that another player had swiped it. We attempted to ask for it back, and even offered to pay for it, but the guy just refused and denied that he had it. He sat on his piano at his camp and ignored us. Another friend said he knew how to get it back... And in a tragic twist of fate, the thief was later found dead of radiation poisoning. A paper bag full of the exact loot he denied stealing was found next to his remains. This guy thought he could steal hours of hard work because he thought he couldn't be killed. Again, an abuse of the system.
---
I am a big fan of miniguns for my heavy PA build, the shredder mod works really well for tanking large amounts of stuff up close.   You will hit with both the bullets and the shredder for maximum carnage. 
---
For at range I bounce to my TSE Gat Plas, but most people dont have one of these OP monsters.
---
Some people prefer bullets, some prefer batteries.  I use both. 
---
It comes down to what you have available, and what legendary effects are on your heavies.
---
I run bloodied now, swapping between my TSE Gat Plas and Bloodied Gat Plas or Bloodied Minigun (depending on what I am fighting.  High energy resist i go for the mini.)
---
When I didnt run bloodied, I used the TSE Exclusively, but it tended to kill me up close from splash.  I then built a AAE mini with a shredder, and fell in love with it for up close fighting.   With fireproof the splash from minis is almost non existant, even dumping a whole clip at point blank, you wont take damage.
---
For me it also feels deader, 76 has the most realistic and beautiful forests and biomes, 4 just looks dead. Ik theres mods like borealis that give it variety but 4 always was disappointingly dead even thiugh it's not aupposed to be a desert.
---
Why should we believe anything you say.
---
Tbh i preffer the FO4 favs than the favorite wheel of Fo76, it's always been an pain in the ass trying to select something in the diagonal side
---
Well for starters, i like that the perk being discussed has that drawback. 
---
I would like to see stuff like pack rat come with a negative too. All junk weighs 75% less but your AP drains 5% faster or something. 
---
Or with the rifleman perks, maybe knock the effectiveness of something else down while boosting rifle effectiveness. 
---
Take less rads from food and water, but hunger and dehydration increases by 5%. 
---
Stuff like that. 
---
I know the mutations already do things like that, but i feel like it would put more thought into builds and how effective you are at pvp too. Like no matter how OP you are, you now have a weakness. And it would be in the subtleties of your perk cards.
---
AAE Handmade is an excellent end-game weapon, IMHO. Equipping Gunsmith 5 slows down wear-and-tear. Carry plenty of repair kits, though, for repairs during battle.
---
It is very doable, but you may need to spend some time reallocating perk points to get the build right.
---
There are very specific builds that must be used in full to make this viable.
---
You not only have to have the right perks, but also the right mutations, food, chems, alchohol, bobbleheads active.
---
And bring a lot of bullets.
---
Thanks
---
I was in the same situation as you are, half a year ago. I decided to cooperate with a friend and grind up for that serum-recipe. We eventually got it, and after 2 days i realized that it was going too slow, and i was hauling up dozens of serums while being held back by the 1400 caps limit. Ended up making 3 mules. Was totally worth the 15 mins it took do do each of them. Then i teleported with friend to Westtek or something, and sat stealthily behind to get a couple hits in on the highlevel enemies he took out. Only leveled Charisma and got Hard Bargain up to level 3. Was now selling 1 serum for 470 on each char. A couple hours of grind, but youve got yourself a steady and highly profitable source of income
---
I concur. Got mine from Uranium Fever and didn't know the previous plans
---
Some of the colored asylum uniforms are insanely rare.  The rarest is the red one, which has been determined through dataminining to have a 0.01% spawn chance (1 in 10,000). 
---
Hardcore collectors don't care how ugly things are. They just want the satisfaction of obtaining super-rare stuff.
---
As far as I can recall, that's always been an issue. If my camp budget was maxed out, it wouldn't let me put things in my vending machines. I remember a couple of occasions when I took weapons out of the stash to try them out, then couldn't put the same weapons, unmodified, back into the stash until I demolished a chair.
---
We call it stockholm syndrome.
---
is JFFR flamer good?
---
It would be interesting like that bc it would heavily effect builds and make people put more consideration into which cards players use
---
Value would be $0. They are so common
---
Thats a good idea for sure.  Thank you!
---
Excavator and Lucky Hole mine will get you 1000 lead in about 15 minutes.
---
The only caveat is you need acid to smelt it.  1 acid + 2 lead ore = 5 lead scrap.
---
Honestly, I still think F4‚Äôs Dpad favorites is FAR superior to 76‚Äôs wheel design. The wheel is SUPER janky when using a controller. Also, the emote wheel is badly implemented, especially with nested emotes. If the devs could implement F4‚Äôs favs with the emote wheel trigger working like an assignable aid device that you could put in any slot, that would be a massive upgrade.
---
Honestly it's the other way around for me. I've spent the last few weeks back in Fallout 4, and despite never like the voiced hero/ine and 'tight' narrative, it's been a massive breath of fresh air. I can pause and go for a drink or break off at any point, even mid fight, thanks to pausing. If I want to accomplish something I've done before I can use mods or the console to speed monotonous moments up/avoid busywork. Just walking into Diamond City, or even a tiny farm, and seeing people going about their lives just gives the Commonwealth a sense of life and the actions I take purpose. Settlement building, at least with Sim Settlements (and even without if I wanted to spend 2000 hours handcrafting everything), feels like an actual measure of reclamation is occurring, which is supposed to be 76's tagline. Outfits and armor have generally higher texture and poly models due to the lack of streamlining for online play. 
---
Even the music and atmosphere of the Commonwealth is magical in a way I'd almost forgotten after six months in Appalachia. Travis is a treasure. Boston proper feels like an actual city with it's population perpetually at war. Companions especially are a game changer; for every subjective misstep Bethesda made with Fallout 4 they are one thing done really, really well, even with the slightly odd approval system. Something as simple as bringing the Minutemen back and seeing their influence spread is great. And nothing in 76 tops the Prydwen arriving while Nick says  "Deep into that darkness peering, Long I stood there, wondering, fearing."
---
The only areas I truly feel Fallout 76 wins out are the improved animations, emotes, poses being built into the photomode, the lighting system in certain conditions (because in 'busy' interiors 76 gets ugly fast), being able to make and play alongside friends, the varied biomes, and the LOD/view distance and elevations. And as much as I'm looking forwards to Wastelanders actually arriving, I don't see how they could possibly match *all that*.
---
That said I'm back from my brief break to finish up some loose ends before next year arrives, and I've had fun today. I don't ask for anything more from 76.
---
I know be good to sell to vendors or at our camps
---
Private world sadly. I would love a server though and keep my farms going but oh well.
---
Crafting prime ammo makes way more per lead/steel. Prime your heavy weapons.
---
Private worlds are not what is known as a private server. 
---
The private worlds are the same as adventure mode but only allow 8 players
---
This. It forestalls the angel of death.
---
If you can find the static spawns for canned coffee, that would be pretty dope
---
Yup, I poured water right into his ugly gullet after one too many snide remarks. Melted faster than the Wicked Witch of the West.
---
I will say ‚ÄúPausing‚Äù is renewed for me. I‚Äôll sit there and be on my phone with the game unpaused and it seems natural, pausing and walking away is almost like alien to me
---
Put on PA + Stabilized and you're golden with that TSE Gatling.
---
Honestly I would be fine with just getting weapon and armour durability in fo4 lol
---
That right there?  That's funny.  I don't care who you are.
---
All good points, but I think you'll find both sets suffer the fatal flaw of not being X-01 power armor.
---
So basically everyone is calling it the wrong thing.
---
You aren't reading all of the other comments are you?
