Man me too. I'd start one but this game already kind of feels like a job sometimes.
---
---
---
Can carry 480 with the +60 backpack now
---
Remindme! 4 hours.
---
Can I just buy it and skip the quest then? I don't always do quests 'cos many of them are pretty time consuming.
---
Yes please
---
How many camps have you visited?   
---
Had this happen a few times, but not every time
---
Got a spot there picked out for my next camp
---
Different workshops have different maxes. I don't think caps have that.
---
You‚Äôre a champ THANK YOU
---
I had this issue and opted to find one in world to fix (without weapon artisan), there are a few I found on the wiki and fast travelled until I found one (then did as the OP did).  I found mine at the Temple of the Winding Path (by the archery targets).
---
Bump for later. Thanks!

I will literally look for people on the map and fast travel to wherever they are if the game starts to feel to empty. But I rarely have that problem.
---
Popped in around patch 8, happens when overloaded :(
---
I sang the "Wouldn't it be nice" part of the title in my head.
---
The badges are hell itself
---
Very feasible, reported to Bethesda with the fix months ago,'sure it will happen at some point
---
It's been a coon's age, but I'm pretty sure I found them sitting on a counter in AVR Medical. Seemed to be luck, as I'd cleaned it out a dozen times and never found them before that.
---
I love you.
---
I think they just become wanted and not hostile.
---
Hey you still guys willing to help another guy out? üò¨ need help with this as well.
---
It seems to happen 90% of the time for me
---
The decontamination showers work the same as a Radaway, it can remove mutations. Sadly, I learned that the hard way. Luckily, it was a mutation that I can make myself lol
---
Sure. Can try using the "Whitespring stream" method. I need this one done as well.
---
Are you sure?  
---
It had the keyword to block SuperDuper as of Patch 8.5
---
Where it AVR medical ?
---
No you still need to have quest education enough to be a possum scout
---
I've heard that you can get badges from the campfire event
---
Okay, my apologies üòÇ I assumed you had meant tadpole because I had just replied to someone else wondering about them. Thank you for further confirming what I have come across. Hopefully people believe us :)
---
They have already mentioned they are looking to add a Fridge to the list of utilities for our camps.
---
I‚Äôve done it three times.  You won‚Äôt see the event sign unless someone else started it.  I talked to someone who served hopped like 50 times then finally got it with me.  Go to camp Adams and server hop til it‚Äôs night.  It auto started for me twice.  There is a cool down if someone else completed it though.
---
Thanks
---
I love it too, gave me great ideas for my move into the mire, my only problem now is I know how many floating bases there are and it makes me question why mothman has let us stray this far
---
Thank you for the info üëç
---
Had it spawn once but it bugged out
---
I have tried that and I unlocked it in the atomic shop but in the menu when I try to make it it says unlock in atomic shop.
---
yes, I did this before Patch 9. It's either that or it's a bug but either way, the animation popped up along with the sound fx and I had 2 recall cards
---
You're welcome! I was selling them to the vendors for 500 caps, and had them priced that way for the first couple hours of player vending and didn't get any bites. Lowered it to 300 and sold 15 of them in the next couple hours.
---
At least 10 in total but yes it happens to me quite often. I would also fast travel to another camp and it'll get me stuck in both so I'd have to go to the nearest train station and walk over
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/AVR_Medical_Center
---
How do you trigger the campfire event,
---
What this guy said
---
Medical wing in whitesprings bunker has a vendor that sells plans
---
Ty
---
Im selling stimpaks and ammo, food just is so incredibly easy to obtain I would never pay for it myself. Its probably the only thing in the game that I dont pick up unless I need it right that instant.
---
What‚Äôs your username on PS4? I‚Äôd like to check it out. Mine is dustrho.
---
I'll check when back at my desk, let's see if they removed that
---
No. You are asking too much benefits.
---
I'm in Xbox, just played 6 hours straight, 1 disconnect.

I think there are just way more people on in general. I like it
---
Violet is tops, but cobalt is a close second. There's a bunch of good stuff that needs it, like ultracite .45 ammo, several of the underarmor upgrades, adrenal reaction, etc. I'll happily pay 50 caps each for either flavor.
---
Strangler Blooms are bugged, and only ever spawn during the time someone completes the Radshield quest, they do not spawn at any other point!
---
Lol think you got the wrong word there
---
I will, I need it too Username: Smedleydude
---
If you still need it at that point I should be online in 2 hours. GT LtT4Z
---
seems like it, i was so disappointed when i saw that seeing as there is so many dailys in the game.
---
If I'm around, they get a free heart emote with purchase
---
Believe me I understand it shouldn't be something you should earn in one day but it also shouldn't take possible about one week maybe even two weeks or longer for just one mod
---
Seems like by walking over to it while it‚Äôs nighttime will trigger it.
---
There is a workaround with a glitch!
---
Happening to me as well, so you‚Äôre not alone. I was in game crafting and got stuck on the workbench.
---
For the possum stuff I want I need roughly 32 badges
---
Interesting, I have a feeling it‚Äôs with the vending machines possibly.
---
Still 25k
---
Previously I only really saw people at popular events. Now I have people dropping in regularly. Crazy the difference one patch makes.
---
Remindme! 6 hours.
---
Well, I had one up and there are usually 5-6 up in survival games.
---
Yeah I feel obligated to speak to everyone who comes by. Even if they don't say anything back or buy anything.
---
Up you go

Someone asked me and i jumped off the scout tower so they could revive me. Just took them the courage to ask me a question and was over in less then a minute.
---
Awesome, all done now thanks!
---
By next update, do you mean 5/16 when the Legendary Vendor is released or beyond this date?
---
Thank you! I PM'd you
---
When you beat the game it goes through all the big decisions you made, and all your companions and talks about where they are now, and the state of each faction afterwards.
---
We have added this to our [Known Issues list](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en), but here's some more information:
---
&gt; The Stimpak Diffuser is a Stimpak that restores health to you and your nearby teammates.  The recipe for this item will be available in the next update. We're aware that this creates an issue with completing the Tadpole Challenge referencing the Stimpak Diffuser, however you may still complete other world Challenges to earn badges.
---
I‚Äôm est time zone but will hook up
---
Same here. I was on a few hours ago, just went to log back in and got the same message [3:0:1407374883553289]
---
Thank you! This will be super helpful for me
---
I've read the post like six times and can't figure out which word you mean. I'd have to guess you mean patronize. If I'm right, then:
---
patronize, verb : to frequent (a store, theater, restaurant, or other establishment) as a customer.
---
"restaurants remaining open in the evening were well patronized"
---
If you meant some other word, then I'm an idiot and will delete this comment later :D
---
[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net)\*
---
Its slang it has nothing to do with video games. Its like "lit" or "fam"
---
I usually see other players but they are busy and were usually going the opposite ways. I've been sprinting and usually in the air most of the time :) got places to be!
---
#TOOT TOOT
---
For sure. My camp is close to the scout camp too so I'm getting tons of traffic.
---
I need help as well if you're willing
---
Just let me back in so maybe a hiccup on their side? Or coincidentally we all have shitty internet, like I do.
---
And bounties should be the only one to damage it but it has double SBQ HEALTH
---
Place a second set of stairs and lead them temporarily to the next floor down or to the ground! You can remove these later when you're ready!
---
I did that challenge it definitely did not make me do it 60 times. More like 8 or so
---
Yeah same happened to my girl when she spammed the x button lol
---
The fun of player vending is going to people‚Äôs CAMPs and engaging with their characters. Even if they‚Äôre not home, it‚Äôs still a social/interactive experience that adds a lot of variety to the game. 
---
While what you‚Äôre suggesting would be very efficient, it would remove heart of what makes this update so enjoyable.
---
I have done it a handful of times and so far I have only been getting stimpacks and other stuff like that. Hopefully I will get it soon!
---
Yeah that hahah
---
I'd take that assistance on Xbox, GT is jonathanenglish
---
Wait selling serums to vendors is 500 caps a piece? The crafted ones? They're like dirt cheap to make though...
---
Well I only found at the name when I talked to the user selling the item.  He was cool and told me that he renamed the axe ‚ÄúAxe Body Spray‚Äù.  He didn‚Äôt have it in his inventory and He offered to refund my caps but I told him it was ok and he friended me so he can know what happens ultimately.  
---
Guessing Bethesda won‚Äôt award me the item or the caps, but opening a ticket was worth a shot.  2nd time the new vending has burned me, but I still like it!
---
Anyone selling an axe like that, let me know!
---
Situated on the river by the Nuka Cola plant.
---
Will do. Message you when on. Be a bit, but will hit you up
---
I love fallout 76 it‚Äôs def a grinding game
---
Sure pal. Proooooof?
---
Now I'm curious why you put 'work' in quotation marks.
---
It wasn't no reason. System?
---
Nice, that's a good idea with the recon rifles.  I might borrow that, Comrade!
---
Doing the musician challenge for possom. "Play instrument at Watoga Highschool" doesn't work also played the bass at watoga HS and didn't count for that either. Reloaded 3 times to no avail.
---
Yeah and it sucks. I heard they also might spawn during the ‚ÄúHeart of the Swamp‚Äù event, but no luck so far. I‚Äôve been trying to find some to make RadShields, but alas.
---
I sold a Hunter's Longcoat for 15k. Fifteen freaking thousand. I turned around and bought another for 3k lol.
---
Its somewhere in the mire I think the deer picture on the map it was an unmark location.
---
Same here
---
i purchased the BOS Knight Under Armor plan from one guy for 300, went to another cap and they where selling it for 400. the 3rd. 800.
---
Thank you! I PM'd you my IGN. I'm online now
---
Never seen them there, the only way I've seen is to encourage players to do the rad shield event, put on/share green thumb, and grab them alongside the person who does the quest!
---
Thanks, appreciate it!
---
I'm aware of that and I also feel it should go both ways. Think of it like a store. You have everyone coming in and the registers are at the back but some people either have the impulse to buy more stuff or they just focus on one thing. That's why it would be beneficial for both ways. They do come over and they get a chance to see the wares and see the camp. You won't lose the feeling all the way. Just add something to assist others who don't want to go through the trouble of not finding something that they want.
---
Sometimes the game puts you into servers that are underpopulated, and they never seem to get better. Sometimes I'm on servers that are literally just me. Other times I'm bumping into people in the middle of nowhere.
---
No problem

And its Xbox. She doesn't think its a ban error because its not the same as the one that comes up in google.

Too bad there not smart enough to do it lol. $5 for a pink atom hat gg.

That's good to hear. I don't see it talked about much, but people seem to be quietly aware of it.

I've been swimming back and forth for 20 minutes and the only thing yellow I can see is the cone shaped fungi things I can't collect or interact with, swam as far as crevasse dam and southern belle motel

Get naked and go chase down a scorchbeast with your crossbow out. Its screech blast always destroys my weapons and armor.
---
U found correct plant. There chance to get item u looking for from this yellow plants
---
[removed]
---
Scrap + Chip = Scrip. 
---
it is the exclusive currency of the legendary vendor, who will come out later
---
Gotcha. I immediately assumed survival wasn't for my build instead of looking into ways I could be successful in it. I stil feel that my initial point is valid in that the measures Bethesda has taken to bring more "balance" to the game has been very convoluted and not the most direct or effective route.
---
Oh, OK. Glad you dealt with a stand up trader. I'm guessing the same with the Bethesda outcome, but I'd have opened a ticket, too.
---
Pretty sure this guy is new. Im curious to see if he reacts different if you drop something.
---
Stuck on the same thing. Really enjoyed doing the rest of it but making that a mission when everyone's fucking invincible is a bit ridiculous.
---
Alright if this is what I've been looking for I was living next to it for 2 months, better be the right thing
---
Trying to get this done as well. If still available I would exchange deaths if someone else needs to complete this. Sorry - no mic in game for me !
---
IGN: imfromolney
---
I got it, helping the other guys out now! Thanks!
---
When you're looking on the map what are serums listed under? Misc?
---
Which also means it will probably suck.
---
should be under machined guns
---
I mean, at some point I'll stop shopping and get get back to hunting legendaries, so they won't be the only thing I'm selling. Plus there's my mule who has a crap ton of gear. He's about to get a lot more screen time.
---
But I thought they might be a good craftable item to sell. I've seen em down at queen fights, got a primed version that I think is damn good for not being legendary.
---
Just added you
---
At least on PC, more than one player can access the same terminal. Not sure if there is a cap, but I've seen up to four
---
i just want a fridge mod for PA torso (can even be an extra attachment since jetpack)
---
What big version, tell me more. :drools:
---
Ok. That's gonna make hunter fairly easy then. Thanks.
---
The frog habitat is a different thing, it requires a frog jar and a frog.
---
It's in your camp building menu under floor decorations.
---
Flipping items is becoming big business. I quickly hit my max caps today after starting the day at 4K simply by buying stuff on the cheap and marking it up 200% in my vending machine. And I still think my prices were fair - I just got insanely good deals from people who didn‚Äôt know what they had. That 10% tax that I thought was bull doesn‚Äôt seem to mean anything right now
---
build your camp nearby with a radshower!
---
I lock my water, only since I have to provide water to my family that also plays. I also lock lead cause I really need it. But my front door, is unlocked and provides a near full workshop for people to use.
---
Once I have enough water I will unlock a purifier or two. Though, I need my lead, sorry peoples! :) 
---
P.S. I‚Äôm in between Appalachian Antiques and Fort Defiance, if you need some corn or something, come take some, (PC).
---
OK thanks for the confirmation !
---
I don‚Äôt see any answers.
---
just saw - be right there thanks !
---
Too easy, cheers man!
---
Well fuck...
---
I feel you. This has happened to me 2 or 3 times when I launch solos.
---
Do you know what the location is called on the map?
---
Did your xbox live run out?
---
I have everything but talons if you are still searching
---
you can buy plan from possums vending machine
---
Camp Adams I believe. Just north west of the nuka cola plant.
---
im trying to RP a nice inkeeper thatll even reward you a few caps for a list of sidequests i have (like getting rid of the nearby snallygaster camp and bringing me their hide.)
---

---
Seems like the other two parts of the challenge like that are bugged too.
---
Thank you!
---
Oh yeah its crazy! Been having a great time just loading up my machines and buying 20k items now that I can afford them. Though I feel like its gonna be hard to buy that kind of stuff for caps for much longer.
---
I picked up serums at one camp for 150, another camp had them for 2k, the PvP weapon rewards 100c at one 1k at another
---
Definitely shop around.
---
I have 132 plans, so I sell them pretty cheap as I'm sick of them filling up my stash. Jetpack 500 &amp; any other PA plan 200 &amp; 100 for any other plan, might have to drop the other plans to 75, so far not a lot of takers but also have only been visited by higher level players who probably know most of them.
---
But my best seller is serums
---
It was my 1st ever launch at all thats what makes it even worse for me, luckilly enough i got the quest rewards before hand though
---
Agreed. Enjoy it while you can because it won‚Äôt last long.
---
If I'm not mistaken there should be a friendly Mr. Handy hovering around the reception area that takes you for a tour
---
I dont need food or water anyway!
---
If it's attached to stairs, it cannot be scrapped, for me. This includes the regular metal staircase and the one that acts like it's own floor. I'm talking an upper floor, on it's own, attached to a staircase? It 'can't be moved because another piece would be inaccessible'.
---
I used to be able to scrap the walls around the stairs but I can't even remove those right now.
---
[](/celestia)None of my addictions have gone away since the update hit if that helps.
---
I keep getting this bug and it's driving me nuts. Seems like mine was related to connection issues over wifi. On ethernet now and don't seem to be having the issue anymore.
---
Yup. Spawned last night into a "fence" of double high walls. Luckily I have the jetpack mod on my PA, but otherwise I would have had to fast travel fairly far away and walked there.
---
The Sons of Dane Compound and the Palace of Winding Path both consistently have crossbows that spawn. Repair these two then use one for the 50 kills and repair it for a quick 3.
---
Mine is clipped into the tree I live in. I can see it but can't touch it. 
---
You're gonna have to move your camp and put it back. Rebuild from scratch.
---
I know the pain. It is like when I spawn in to see my camp is obstructed to see some eye sore in the vicinity of where my camp normally is.
---
Wait people still play this?
---
Also, be mindful I had 2 apparel go in that I didn't intend to sell.  Someone bought my wedding ring for one cap.  Someone else had a similar thing happen, things get in your vending machine without you being aware.
---

Exactly

Marsupial has been my friend

yup, got it set up like that with the switch beind my saloon's counter and some conduits running along the ceiling.
---
You should either buy them as mods, or ask some crafter to make them for you. Much cheaper than to buy plans for one or few uses.
---
Or...and hear me out... a Chinese version, a Impirial Prime that roams the map that WE CAN KILL!
---
They are saving our economy from inflation through the use of ‚Äúsinks‚Äù to remove caps.  Most players are ignorant of economics.
---
Shotguns should do considerably more damage than long range, high rate of fire weapons. They now kill more slowly, and have less range.
---
Yes but if you have to have unlocked the original backpack before you can use this one then it's not a big deal
---
make them buy your junk.
---
then launch them out the window.
---
reclaim junk.
---
sell junk again.
---
repeat.
---
Nope.
---
Ouch didn‚Äôt know it was given away for quest. At least I already know it on my main.
---
I'm on now, xb1, shoot me your tag, would love to purchase some
---
It's always been there.
---
You‚Äôll probably reset to another nearly cell.
---
Its still for sale and will still expire. It's intended to make it last longer and that's what it's doing. That isn't exploiting anything.
---
still waiting on the caged armor to come to the atom shop :(
---
got it today too
---
No, it's good. PA is so overall OP.
---
you can get some scrip before she comes to the surface by trading garbage legendary gear to the Legendary exchange machines near most train stations
---
I actually had a fun time figuring them out last night. Google Home was fucking invaluable though lol.
---
Someone learned the wrong lessons about liberty prime
---
I can see where you are coming from with this, but my experience has been that level of owner is irrelevant. I am lvl 125 on my main build and don‚Äôt sell any of my legendary weapons/armor at my machine. Conversely, I ran across a lvl 5 player whose shop was full of max lvl 3* legendary items - they were clearly a mule or alt. So instead of it showing the level of the player running the shop, it would be nice if it could show legendary items for sale. But that may be difficult to implement and I‚Äôve seen enough extra crashes since this update
---
OP, why don't you make a list in your first post with all the info given in this thread?
---
Thank you for this I was selling my legendary gear I didn‚Äôt know you can scrap it
---
My friend is selling serums for 200 a pop, just saw a guy hawking them for 2000. It pays to shop around.
---
I'll have to try that if I manage to find him again
---
Exactly. But if I want my food to last longer for my own sake I could just put it jn the vending machine and set the price to 1K knowing that no one would ever lay that. Bomb, I now have a free fridge that I never had to work for. Exploit.
---
The bunker is at 4500 tho
---
Are they difficult or just time consuming there is a difference
---
i guess i misworded that, i meant tedious.
---
Really? For me, it‚Äôs around 2200.
---
I usually leave stuffed animals in peoples houses with a knife.
---
I‚Äôve been server hopping trying to pick it up and theirs nothing there
---
Still bugged today, on PC.
---
THAT would mess me up. Not gonna lie.
---
how do you get a frog? do you have to have the animal taming perk?
---
Very much appreciated  !
---
Sure, please! Thx for adding.
---
You have any perks that would change it? Or high charisma?
---
I sell my food seriously cheap. Most of my actually valuable items I sell through player markets, not vending machines, so I have the slots. 
---
It‚Äôs just for fun. I have mirelurk, mole rat, and Mongrel spawns all near my base, it takes almost no effort to stay stocked on mutt chops for 10c each, mole rat chunks for 3c each etc. I have a bar and a store. What type of organization would I be running if we didn‚Äôt sell food?
---
Same thing for the imposter salvaged assaultron head. You needed to learn it from the assaultron head plan as well before you could craft it. Js
---
Mine is showing as completed in the menu checklist but I'm still showing 3/4 of the helpfulness quests completed.
---
Now what?
---
i don't think is the best but it's good actually
---
but lately im into these games as service, ESO, F76, No man's sky.... games that i can play some hours, chilling without the need of "i need to end this game bc it's becoming booring". So i'm hooked playing and discovering new things, that's great and keep my interest every week
---
I'm sorry to hear you have them too, but at the same time, I'm glad it's not just me. I wonder if they will be addressed during tomorrow's maintenance.
---
Its over there....
---
Was that guy in the mire? With his vending machine on his roof? If so that was me!
---
yes. Rank 2 reduces cost farther (-50%). and rank 3 allows for free Merchant Camp fast traveling
---
Its over there.....
---
The nerf bat is always swung in an arc
---
Going to hit more than one person with it whatever they do
---
You just got slapped with your armor and your gun, so that hurts
---
I do highly recommend looking into some other means of damage and damage reduction though, it should really help you out
---
You know what, I can see what you mean. The other regions look a bit too bright, or blocky if you get what I mean. Ash heap just looks great altogether

You are the man! Thank you. I didn‚Äôt realize what I was missing!

Having this SAME issue. Now I just have a loop and it‚Äôs pissing me off. BETHESDA PLEASE LET US REMOVE STAIRS OK
---
sent, sorry it took a little while
---
Add me, join me.
---
I don‚Äôt have any special perks and my charisma is 4
---
Or the toxic valley :(
---
I can't imagine selling them that cheap. They require flux to craft, which doesn't exactly come free, and they sell to vendors for up 500 each. Granted I give away a lot too, but that's awfully cheap.
---
If anyone else on PC needs a sacrifice let me know although I wont be on for 30-60 minutes.
---
Oh bless you! As a casual player, I was getting frustrated.
---
Strange
---
where is this intercom...i see the table.
---
I can help I'd you can help me
---
So 5 hours behind me, what's a good time for you?
---
Have you done any dailies since you put it up? I only had Biv until I tried the new ones. I'm guessing you just need to do them again to start tracking it.
---
If you just want to outright buy it, it‚Äôs in my vendor station. Made it cheaper than any others I‚Äôve seen right now
---
Theres also a spawn at palace of the winding path, at the southern end by an archery range. That's where I get mine for all my characters
---
Haha i can see that aspect. Would be kinda fun to RP, I just know that I personally would never buy food because of how easy it is to obtain. Plus I have butchers bounty level 3 for Stimpak crafting so I always have quick access to food.
---
By thing is, it's not INHERANTLY difficult. Each little piece can generally be done, but together it takes time to earn your shit.
---
The only thing annoying me is I started the process with a power armor user, so the backpack is useless.
---
And here's the code pieces that were used to solve: B-1, D-2, G-1, H-8, L-3, N-2, O-6, P-8.
---
Sure, u on now?
---
I did a test to see how far off I was from the old land mark. 3' off the tree, and the old one was right on the tree. Put the camp back down, log in and out a few times everything was good! This is when I got the epic basement. All the walls clipped in to the rocks, so the back wall was natural rock. Look so awesome, but then the next day log it... proof! Waited a week, but not login would give it back.
---
Ok ill check out the price
---
Bloddy 'ell mate! Doing Atoms work friend!!
---
Vendors cap out tho.. can sell unlimited to vendors... you can to players.
---
No problem! We just completed it, but I'll help you out. Let's meet at Pioneer Scout Camp in game
---
If you werent so unoriginal you would've thought to try it the first time.
---
I just don't buy from people's prices who are insane. It takes up a slot, eventually they will realise if they want to move it and free a slot the will lower the price.
---
Yep psn is mistermeatyman.  I'm gonna be at spruce lake
---
vendors cap each day...  sell to vendors for 500... sell to players for less
---
Great concept! Too bad I‚Äôm on PS4 otherwise I‚Äôd definitely consider joining up. Maybe I‚Äôd actually be able to stand a chance in survival
---
I found mine as a new player at the Landview Lighthouse
---
Imagine the reviews for the game if it launched with this. People helping each other discover what mutations are and how legendary effects work and what power armor plans can be found and where rare uniforms are and everything like that with a player vending economy attached.
---
fam is slang?
---
Thanks, haven't started the quest yet. Hell Im even lagging on the Lowe. But this scout thing seems highly more intresting, because it has actual good rewards.
---
Anyone on PS4 holla at me
---
Have not gotten a request
---
Fast traveling to you
---
**OH YEAH!!!**
---
Sorry just saw this but glad you got help!
---
Tbf with the flamer ammo being cheaper a two shot or quad one could be amazing as a healer
---
I sent the request earlier today so when you sent me one it automatically accepted
---
I fell through the map about an hour ago and yeah you die
---
There is a crossbow that spawns at the Temple.  It is almost broken.  Outside pass the bus there is an archery range.  You can repair that fast.
---
That's a whole lot of text to explain that you clearly don't understand.
---
The point was that bases aren't safe. Nobody said that players themselves can still damage bases. As it has been explained to you, players kite monsters that spawn as a result of fast travel to player bases and hide, allowing monsters to damage said bases :)
---
How you keep failing to recognize this fact, I don't know. I'm not the only one who has explained this to you, but you sure keep managing.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised at the amount of people who will buy food that gives buffs if it‚Äôs (extremely) cheaply priced. The most expensive dish I‚Äôve sold is mire-lurk cakes W/ bloodleaf aioli for 12 caps.
---
Exactly it would be different if it bypassed having to do the backpack quest but it doesn't
---
Maybe people are going by what the game marks them as? Like the game wants me to sell stimpacks at 40 caps (or 25 can‚Äôt remember), but I sell them for 8.
---
The only thing the game and I agree on price wise is ballistic fiber. Yes that should cost 12 caps a piece, it‚Äôs one of the hardest materials to find in big chunks.
---
What kind of buffs can you get with food? Anything better than the +3 strength and +3 charisma a beer gives me with party boy?
---
This is a major problem for me, people are constantly buying from my machines because I have great deals. I've been trying all day to SPEND caps.
---
They will use ultracite cores but it doesn't improve anything.
---
So could we have that as something we have to work for.
---
Your point is very valid. All the time people want super ez mode for everyhing. Of course it usually don't happen, but I'd like people to be more realistic.
---
That‚Äôs it I‚Äôm telling on u! &gt;:( u/valseek
---
They really aren‚Äôt that bad, I got my backpack in about four hours on a level 27 toon who had never been to the mire before so I had to run everywhere on foot.
---
It now seems more like a classic Bethesda dungeon. Skyrim exit and everything.
---
thanks! I was thinking of doing it but had good junk on so decided not to.
---
i keep my acid extractor, and water purifiers unlocked and a big neon letter sign that says "Free Stuff"
---
LOL
---
They would certainly be better but I‚Äôm convinced people would still shit on this game. There are still people whenever fallout makes a Facebook or twitter post with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play when you add real NPC‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äúshould have just made fallout 5.‚Äù 
---
But I agree it would have been amazing if it came out like this.
---
Good prices and gratuitous nudity if I happen to be around?
---
Buy low sell high.
---
Plot twist
---
Everyone is a communist. 
---
\#Isaac
---
Yeah especially selling High tier stuff I'm having to make another character or account just to be able to sell this stuff
---
Yes. I will have the Bethesda team get right on that. 
---
A refrigerated Nuka Cola machine for selling food would be awesome. Especially if they brought back ice cold nuka-cola.
---
I spawned into someone locked building, and picked the lock as haven‚Äôt done it before and got a wanted bounty
---
Check the challenges under the world tab, its for badges
---
Flux merchant here, I actually have a pretty easy time acquiring violet from people, crimsons been a B tho (currently not selling btw)
---
I use a two shot, extra limb damage one when I do. It still isn't as effective as stims with Field Surgeon and Team Medic. Instead it's like a potential group heal over time that does a DoT to enemies too. Looking forward to busting it out more now that ammo is easier to farm.
---
Damn I got downvoted for not knowing. The piece is cloaking BOS  combat armor chest piece. Info is being hit in melee generates a stealth field once per 30 seconds. I know it worked because I was in battle with super mutants in third person  and one hit me and I went invisible and he said ‚Äúhey where‚Äôd you go‚Äù and I always wear PO. maybe it was a glitch? I‚Äôm trying to re trigger it again
---
Increased AP, increased AP refresh, Increased Strength, Increased Health, also, these buffs would stack with the beer.
---
A real apocalyptic wasteland wouldn't have mutated monsters and magical weapons/armor that give us superpowers.
---
I just stopped trying at the last 5 towards the bottom challenges. The other ones "build blank at your camp" worked fine.
---
I am old ....51 to be exact. I miss my VCR, ah the good old days......lol
---
I dont know. Most the camps Ive seen all look pretty similar. Seems like all high level players have the standard modernized home with neon lights. Im over here trying to make my C.A.M.P. look like a rundown old church.
---
There you go! :)
---
Thank you for doing business
---
Yeah he definitely fixed it
---
Thinking about it....
---
Carpets can support order carpets. If you remove the bottom one all of the ones ontop get stored...
---
Make a flying camp. Make a big square room but remove all the middle bits and cover the big hole with carpets.
---
Put down a junk vending machine.
---
Get prompt of someone buying junk.
---
Remove carpets.
---
Reclaim junk.
---
I'll help, I need it too, GT aGraciousGod
---
I have a strong feeling that 75 of the people that say the game as boring have only used fast travel.
---
I think there are many like you.  My coworker and I are huge on the exploration aspect so we really like 76.
---
I'm balancing it ok, though unfortunately about an hour ago I lost a full set of plans for Ultracite PA. They went on a spending spree at the same time I was buying stuff and they managed to get some stuff for really cheap.
---
Ugh, R.I.P.
---
https://youtu.be/rEt0sL8FGH8
---
Ok ill send you an invite
---
Making a frog enclosure didn't count for me... :( I got a nice frog in my camp but no challenge trigger!
---
Only way is to hard the vendor nearby
---
To bad i cant afford a legacy explosive one...
---
Shooting healing fireballs would be amazing.
---
Also with stims theres still a chance they get K.Od from bigger attacks. Keeping them at full hp with flames might be nice.
---
finally got some off time at work and took some off time from powerplants as while I moved my shop,learned the new vendor thingie, and rebuilt it etc. 
---
I am right between posiden and the junkyard to the north of it. both are in range of artillary. at level 220 I am high level for the area but i want to play with helicopters and artillery for a bit. so far its quicker just to go shoot things but i notice the helicopters make it easier to find attackers.
---
Gonna add you now, my user is MoppinUpScrubs
---
And they're usually MASSIVE but only contain a bed, a single stash box and crafting benches.
---
Yea I used to camp there too. I set up a mortar and struck the town closest to it multiple times to eliminate the scorched
---
Fyi
---
Just kill it, then take it‚Äôs photo
---
Still counts
---
I believe you can be in your camp, choose move camp, and place it almost right where you did originally.
---
I vaguely remember doing something like that when figuring a build.  That way you don‚Äôt have to actually *move*. But you‚Äôll still have to re-place your camp blueprint down. Or possibly rebuild if the game decides to be picky.
---
It's just a bug. If it happens join another server or try to rejoin that one. Sometimes it does that, you should normally be able to view everything.
---
I don't think the nerf was entirely necessary. There's already plenty of counters to the armor, VATS crits being one of the more powerful ones.  A simpler solution would have been to lower the maximum damage reduction perks could apply to insure that even with the effects active, you couldn't be invincible. 
---
What still needs addressed AFAIK is the OP nature of legacy weapons, which are now being duped within small closed circles because of they're ridiculously OP in PvP, like pre-nerf TSE ridiculous.
---
I don't hoard caps i spend my caps!!!  Which is why i like to "sell" my hard earned items in the game.  However, that isn't the issue here.  Generally when you sell something you don't get a partial payment unless you agree to take less.  That's called trading.  I also won't judge the way anyone chooses to play the game.  If you keep all your characters under 25k that is your prerogative!  Nothing wrong with collecting things and saving your caps to purchase a 20K plus serum or the multiple plans now available to us.  25k is nothing.  We need a banking system.
---
I'm currently launching nukes to farm more flux for more serums. GT is Awdangbro.
---
I don't think there is any chance any of it will save properly in a blueprint. Time for something new, I guess.
---
you do not need to, open your floor as to where you want those stairs, place a new set there, and then remove the old ones. works for me
---
There's all sorts of handy bonuses from the better food. It's not the basic food% that's intresting.
---
Strenght, healing, AP, AP refresh Everything. XP, melee bonus, crit bonus. Normal food bonuses last 30 mins but better 1 hour. I think some last 2 hours? When I play longer my food bonuses don't fit single view on the pip boy.
---
The thing is, right now, you can't have anywhere near all the good ones. They require too much of different plants and meats you can't collect without them going bad. If they would stay good for long while on sale, you could farm them and sell them. And sure people would buy them.
---
Now player vending is in, look for cheap mutation serums 150 to 250 caps or other bargains.
---
Depending on perks either sell in your camp for more or to a robot vendor
---
Or just do 1 run of uranium fever &amp; whitesprings &amp; pick up everything, you'll easily reach your 1400cap limit each day
---
I get what you‚Äôre trying to say. The English language is often annoying in how many words have multiple meanings. Usually you use patronize in the instance you‚Äôre referring to when talking about visiting a place. To patronize a person usually means to talk down to or be condescending towards.
---
You‚Äôre not an idiot for making this statement. Anyone could easily be confused by this. No big deal.
---
Same! I play with my wife - so much fun to play co-op!
---
As there is an actual vendor, and not just another machine to allow you re-roll your legendary gear, then I think it's most likely you will be handing over your scrip to buy a random legendary (similar to Watoga HS) or one similar to what you get in the Survival Mode challenges. Maybe you can choose whether its a weapon or armor and also the number of stars it has. The prices would be different for each choice eg. 5000 scrip for a 3 star weapon, 2000 for a 2 star weapon etc
---
If you could see the actual 3 star weapon the vendor is selling on each server and the vendor's stock was randomised, people would keep server hopping until they found their dream 3 star weapon. Bethesda probably don't want that.
---
Min. 5k
---
Oh thank god you said no homo. How else would we understand that you‚Äôre a robot
---
Other than just adding more missions to keep the game going. It's part of ranking up to a "possum" ranked scout and doing that you can unlock backpacks to carry more weight. I did complete 2 last night but it never updated on my mission status.i wondered if it's broken.
---
I have no choice at this point. It was just a lot of wasted effort. All my gear isn't the kind that was heavily duped and it took a lot of trading to get it all. Just really sucks man.
---
Oh right on. Thank you
---
It would be the tent on your map.
---
OHHHHHHHHHH thank you. Geeze I feel dumb but that's the only thing I didn't check
---
Don't forget the vests. I think they were red vests or something. All I really recall is several of our troop members had them during most meetings and they had these curved badges which fit in this giant design around a center badge.
---
I'll pass then, I buy in bulk only, thanks tho :)
---
I don‚Äôt know if I like it better than fallout 4. 76 has some better things but I loved the story of 4.   I was just like you.  I didn‚Äôt buy 76 until about a month ago because I had heard such awful things but fallout 76 is badass.  I thoroughly enjoy it.  I do wish they had human NPC‚Äôs and maybe real human cities like diamond city where players can go and interact.
---
Oh it ties into backpack weight too? Interesting. I might mess with it some more then, since I have a minor hoarding problem
---
I have weapon artisian and it has been working good so far \*frantically knocks on wood\*
---
I had no idea of the complexities of Appalachian cuisine. Im a simple man who survives on self brewed beer and mutt chops.
---
Im lvl 14 and have no clue what to do
---
I think what your doing with a group to farm for flux is a great idea.  I have been having a very hard time teying to get fluid to stabilize flux to create a jetpack.
---
I'm on Xbox one, can I run with you guys sometime to help out?
---
How many quest's are left for this new quest line? is it just this one?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFrMLRQIT_k
---
Consoles don't have keyboard. PC have mod doing exactly that.
---
Yeah...i think it would be great if they brought tse energy back...they are fun and it would help the market a bit as you can hardly win a bid war as these weapons take the prize 7 out of 10 times...i had 1 drop early on and sold it and wish i still had it now

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I think your right, wasnt thinking lol
---
it works fine.. only if the camp owner is there. then it will allow you to inspect the items in question
---
That's what diluted stims are for, topping people off. 45% heal with First Aid and easy to make up to 8 out of 1 stim with Chemist and Super Duper.
---
Yup.. scroll through till you find the single bulbs that need to connect to power.. 
---
Need a terminal connected to power too.. then you can change them..
---
The person has to be somewhat close to their camp.
---
thanks
---
Travel Agent perk is your friend.  üòâ
---
Normally it's all just one firey, colour, or one radioactive colour, have experienced it all over the map, and also some weird lighting bugs where the ground is just "full right" with no shading!
---
You can scroll with mouse wheel, arrow keys at the same time. Wheel is more precise but wheel+key works to get close faster.
---
I havne't realized Z and C do something too, but that should further compliment the two ways.
---
No, there are many things no one will ever sell for caps because the limit is so low, it isn't worth it. I have things I know are worth more than 25k caps, and the only things I would give up those things for, are other things of similar value.
---
The vendor bot thing is great for players that aren't maxed on caps, players that aren't already successful traders. Until we have anything worth spending caps on, it effectively does nothing for us.
---
If the limit was 100k there might be stuff I would be willing to sell, because then caps might have value enough to get the other things I want. 
---
Just like real money, it's only "value" is based on its ability to represent what you're buying.
---
If players are able to save up hundreds of thousands of caps, they would still need to believe something was valuable enough to spend all that on..
---
The only issue besides this artificial limit on caps, is there being nothing worth spending caps on. If they increase the limit, but also gave players something worth spending larger amounts on, there would be a proper sink to balance things out.
---
Say something in the atom shop cost 1800 atoms, or cost 18k caps- suddenly there's another cost players can spend on, and as long as it's expensive enough, it won't hurt their current atom endeavor.
---
Probably for people in Venture, which was for older members past Eagle looking for more to do. Or OA which you had to get elected into by your troop, a white sash with a red arrow that ran across the opposite shoulder.
---
Props to you man, with all due respect these threads aren't as exciting as the datamines, secret quest discoveries etc but they are waaay more important. Thanks for your work.
---
player proximity?  lame.  yeah.  was able to inspect at some and not others.
---
&gt; nature of legacy weapons,
---
What do you mean by legacy weapons? What is an example of a legacy weapon?
---
I sold about 18k worth, but purchased 28k, now my main character has 300caps. 
---
Have to stop spending, that's a first in this game
---
Player vending is awesome
---
keep the prices low
---
No. Legacy items need to remain legacy. What needs addressed is how OP explosive lasers are when the beam splitter is applied. You don't even really have to aim.  It's like the pre-nerf TSE Shotguns all over again. What's worse is there's a handful of people who have figured out a new dupe method and are making more of them.
---
Funny, I was killing max level enemies with my level 40 quad explosive shotgun tonight, no problem.
---
I am on a cliff for the view so I hope this isnt me... but I have logged off while people where in my house so that it would pooof and they would fall to their death.  Only when they are being annoying tho.
---
Remember kids they wanted us to pay real money for this refigerators :D
---
If you use flat roof panels instead of floors you wont need stairs for the upper lvls.
---
I just finished it and got nothing. No plans, no badges, nada
---
GOOD ADVICE FRIENDS!
---
can other players use the backpack if you craft them one???
---
It's actually how us previous base attackers are attacking bases now with the new patch.
---
Since we can no longer damage bases directly, we now have to do it indirectly. The best part is that the common adventure player is helping us do it. I'll break it down for you all:
---
Every time you fast travel, an enemy mob is spawned. I now take that mob and run to the CAMP that I now see on the minimap thanks to you selling shit. I walk into your CAMP through the unlocked front door (Sometimes wide open since buyers don't bother closing your doors) and hide somewhere high in your camp. The mob I've kited now goes crazy breaking your CAMP while I sit back and watch.
---
Now the best part is that while I'm doing this, any person fast traveling to legitimately buy something from your vending machine is also unwittingly bringing in a couple of aggroed monsters into and around your CAMP. I can do this as many times as I want as long as I have caps to fast travel. You can't stop me from doing it either, because I might have passive mode on :)
---
Thanks Bethesda.
---
Yeah the games dispite being quite demaning, feel a bit too much made for consoles only.
---
Disagree. 
---
When everyone runs around in the same exact gear, it's time for a rebalance.
---
Same logic applies to OP characters in PvP games.
---
Explosive laser is one. There's something weird with how their damage is applied when the beam splitter is attached. I've come across them several times in PvP and they'll pretty much one hit you even at full health. I'm full A/S and have been dropped by them.  With the automatic mod for the laser rifles they can drop dozens of shots on you very quickly that have a high chance to stagger and do immense damage.
---
It's not guaranteed. Keep trying. The event is supposed to drop a pla
---
all of the above, primarily game balance, more better quests and bugs. I liked better from scratch
---
There are a lot of opinions both good and bad, and this question is asked multiple times a day so scroll through and see them. In my opinion yes, it's getting a lot better and it's fun, lot of people would say yes lot would say no.
---
Walk up to it and pick it up.
---
also - anytime a wire fails to conect from point A to point B if you go from point B to point A for some reason it magically connects then.
---
Did u play fo4?
---
Hey how did u guys do it? We‚Äôre havin some issues
---
Yes at same location as you
---
It‚Äôs dumb..made one captured frog...put frog in jar and it still says I need to make a frog habitat
---
Works for me. Just fixed three pieces of armor and two guns to 200%
---
I‚Äôm so sorry I can‚Äôt help with a map picture but there is a spot close to Harpers ferry (IIRC) that has an empty trailer and a raider-like podium.  That may be neat if you manage a build that connects to the trailer.
---
I‚Äôm hoping a more savvy user would know where I‚Äôm talking about and be able to share the spot on the map.
---
Well for the Electrician badge it definitely says "Be a conduit in the Encryptid event (0/60)" so if that really happened for you then I guess either the UI is wrong or the challenge is bugged.
---
Heard my friend gleefully saying he was selling Nukashine, he was selling them for 10 caps a bottle.... I bought him out, far easier than making my own!
---
Exams are at the pioneer camp and you can revive anyone. I recommend reviving someone during the sheepsquach event.
---
That sounds pretty legit actually..
---
"Keep the change ya filthy animal"
---
I know exactly where you‚Äôre talking about actually lol I‚Äôm gonna go check it out!! I just found a treehouse I‚Äôve never seen before lol
---
I landed in some guys floor and got stuck after a FT.  He pulled his floor up to let me out.  We bro fisted and i went ahead and bought some plans from his vendor. Most wholesome experience I've had in a while.  
---
I also found out I listed my extra plans for waaaaay too much.  Ill have to fix that after work.  Anyone got a range on marine wetsuit plans?
---
Crafting items is not affected by "Weapon Artisan" or "Fix it Good". These only apply to repairs. Crafted item condition is based on Intelligence.
---
Hi, exams are in a building to the south of the first quest robot that conscripts you
---
Two terminals, all exams on those
---
I just did this and didn't get any currency
---
Dude there's so much to do. If you like fallout and co-op games buy it.
---
Absolutely. Although I have to admit guilt today for the tadpole quests. I neeeed that backpack now!
---
Well I'm still killing enemies and I'm not saying I should be one shotting everything either. The issues is they've gone a little heavy handed with their "balancing" measures while there's much more overpowered builds that have never been addressed. Why isn't every weapon type or build at least of somewhat equal footing? People can experiment with different playstyles instead of making only a handful of builds viable then. 75% of the weapons and armor in the game almost irrelevant now.
---
You absolute legend
---
I'm only confused because they didn't specify which word they're talking about lol
---
20k+ on PC and possibly some nice weapon/armour trades.
---
Two new dailies
---
One new event
---
Most of the ‚Äòcontent‚Äô is in *World* tab of challenges
---
I have always wondered this. Ash Heap is amazing, Mire is almost as good, Forest is okay, Bog and Valley suck. Savage divide is a mixed bag.
---
Where do you craft a frog jar, I‚Äôve looked everywhere I would think to look
---
3 serums will get you cap limit. I sell them for 250 because I know people will buy them for exactly that. I can't keep them in stock lol.
---
It's part  of the assorted lights set
---
Take a bullet, leave a body.
---
I still need twisted Muscles. How much are you asking?
---
Lies! They're hilarious!
---
Looks like BGS will do a fix tomorrow morning.
---
I think it will level out where the people too proud of their shit realize the prices have to be competitive. Also you shouldn‚Äôt be far from the posted value of an item. If you are way to low it will devalue.
---
The end to her quest was bugged last time I tried months ago. Yeah I know, that‚Äôs why I want to but I don‚Äôt have the time to.
---
Yes I think we all do. Good luck to you.
---
Hey I can help with that. Ign is mpcollins92, I'll be on in about 5 minutes
---
It looks like there isn't any shading in there now though....
---
A locked door is nothing but a challenge to get in without raising a bounty.
---
Do you know if people can see your custom weapon names? Since people can't inspect legendaries unless you are near the camp, I was thinking of renaming my itself to tell all the effects they have
---
I need the same. Add me PSN: LughGraves
---
400 seems fair?
---
PC or console? The game itself isn't the issue. But if your PC isn't up to the requirements there might be toning back in some gameplay elements needed. Consoles aren't trouble free either, but most of the launch issues are a memory now. 
---
You've played FO4, then there shouldn't be too much of a learning curve for FO76's controls, VATS is done differently though. You should be able to find a cheap copy somewhere, but be prepared for a delay in your playing straight away, some of the updates are monster sized. Other than that, I hope you enjoy it.
---
They definitely weren't in Venture, and no, it wasn't a white sash, it was a vest for sur. I think we were Troop 91 in the Chicago area. One thing I do distinctly remember though is the summer after I left, they were at this one farm-like place for an event. While there a patrol group got bored and fired off a model rocket, but the thing is, the parachute didn't deploy. It landed in the nearby cornfield and when they tried to recover it, it started a fire. From what I heard from my buddies who were still in the troop at the time, the Scout Leader said it was single-handedly the largest corn-roast in all of cub scout history. The ironic part is the patrol group's name was "The Pyros". They didn't let those guys live it down.
---
I'm hopeful that the Wastelanders expansion over the summer will inject more story content into the game!
---
I'll take it. You on right now?
---
The new lighting system they use for this game favours dark areas such as interiors, Ash Heap, the Mire.
---
You still can, as an honorary night! If we get enough people I‚Äôll probably get someone to run PS4 and xBox events.
---
It's not OP if everyone is running around in it...it is balanced...the problem is there is no matchmaking in pvp and the new people that don't yet have it are getting murked...they have to bring balance in all areas...honestly if they raised the drop rates for all the rare gear it would fix a lot of things...if everyone has access to the same stuff like in real pvp type games then it's all about skill and not what you have...no reason to complain if you get killed as you are equal to all and therefore can only come to the conclusion that you suck and need to practice...then no need for nerfs...but some one starting out wanting to play pvp with crap Legendaries or even non legendary vs someone with top tier of course they are gonna complain...give everyone a shot at good loot with slightly less grind and matchmaking and balance would be achieved.
---
I love my floating stacked concrete base. Indestructible and cant be wrecked by mobs of any sort. And best part is, i love how i don't have to worry about anything as far as my base is concerned and it is still very aesthetically pleasing in the inside. So go back to playing your game instead of worrying how others play their's. People with floating bases are just as entitled to play their game how they please just like you do.
---
Now we know why we were given access to nukes.
---
The time is nigh brothers and sisters. Those who fly without wings must be cleansed.
---
thank you!
---
At Least you can wear it still in power armor it just won't work
---
id love the ability to build custom mods. maybe make it take an extra 5 wood 1 steel and 1 spring (to build the mod box)
---
I can't even remember the last time I checked my purifiers. I've been using inert flux for thirst for a while.
---
I'm up to 7 milks.. I think it has to do with someone milked them dry. Try again later.
---
I‚Äôd be happy with just free merchant to merchant travel as rank 2 but either works for me.
---
Lol the newspaper was a nice touch.
---
I don‚Äôt know for 100%. But judging by how many people wanted to buy the New Vegas themed weapons I‚Äôd say so. I was gambling on I know that if I was running a shotgun build and someone took the time to mod one out and give it a NV name like Dinner Bell I‚Äôd sure as shit pick it up for 200 caps just to give some props. Apparently I was right!
---
Thank you! I will simply find a lower level player fallow them and when their down jab a stimpack into their arm
---
I'd love to come by and check out what you're selling on Playstation! Let me know if I can add you!
---
Good luck with any of this lol
---
I‚Äôve only been able to milk The Brahmin being herded by a mr. handy (random event). Tried flatwoods Brahmin many times over multiple hops and no luck.
---
Yeah my psn is tigers24742
---
In all seriousness, if having a floating base means you get to enjoy fo76 that much more, have at it. Just making light of how many I've seen visiting vending machines
---
There an event that has a decent chance of rewarding you with a possum badge.
---
which platform are you? I'm on PC and I can give you one for free.
---
Same so far. Maybe it needs multiple jars?
---
I have three - only one is locked. That way those in need can help themselves while there's some saved for me when I return.
---
Blackwater mine has a radshower.
---
Now all you need is Opossum
---
Servers are going down for maintenance tomorrow I hope they're applying a hotfix to correct this issue as nobody's getting it
---
Thanks, I just checked and it's only on my main, high level toon.
---
Another I have under lvl 20 can milk them without problem :/
---
Gram could exist in fallout 4.. but he may have.. grown a lot since then.
---
Me too. It‚Äôs pretty cute sitting next to my fish lamp, but the quest is still active
---
I believe once we complete that mission it will unlock the plans to craft the backpack. Which from what I have seen it is craftable and can be modified with different perks like armor can.
---
for anyone struggling with this like i did... it's litterally on the bridge lol. i'm a moron
---
Where do you make the jar, I think the habitat is in floor decor in build mode, but I can‚Äôt find the jar anywhere
---
Hopefully!
---
You said it. Great way of saying it. I burn out on video games because I become too powerful. Give me iron armor and a steel blade. I need nothing else. Same with fallout. Give me leather, a spear and that is it. Power armor can go to hell. Limitations are key to roleplaying. Makes battle more desperate.
---
Yep...which brings us back to this post :-)
---
Did you do the Scout Challenges?
---
Okay tough guy, cool story
---
Touching the ground?
---
Heard rumours that may be a problem
---
Cannot confirm
---
Great ideas!  Hope they weigh in soon to confirm
---
Getting strong Doug Judy / Pontiac Bandit vibes from this, OP.
---
Calm and collected are not raider attributes...
---
Look under the data tab. The quests are there, click on the ones you want to mark/hide.
---
Hmm idk. Some spots are so shallow I don‚Äôt think I can be swimming the whole time right!?
---
Then why aren‚Äôt prices coming down?
---
My CAMP is right on the water if you'd like to join me.
---
No worries
---
Also a good idea to ask on here, as there another one to ‚ÄúRevive a player in water‚Äù
---
Extremely difficult to just come across this set of circumstances in the wild...
---
I did two birds one, asked around and did revive &amp; revive in water in one hit

Welcome to Fallout 76 :)
---
Y'all are beautiful, you know?
---
I too will die for you, send me the invite
---
How do you move without destroying everything?
---
Wait for the pale rider power armor skin. It's white T-51b.
---
They need to let us build towns or and get established too
---
I absolutely loved FO4 (still do) and have played over 300hrs of 76 since the beta. I think you‚Äôll enjoy it. Give it a shot, pretty cheap now everywhere so what have you got to lose?
---
Nah this is some type of bug they were there the. I got disconnected from server and now the markers won‚Äôt show. Quest is still data tab. I had this happen a while back and came back after a few days. I‚Äôve tried quitting starting again. Very annoying
---
Its a really good game dont get me wrong, im just having a bad experience with it bug wise
---
It was always time to buy fallout 76.
---
Buy low, sell high!
---
What‚Äôs your gt
---
I didn‚Äôt think so
---
Also kept jumping out of the water to bit the buoys myself and had no issues... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You can‚Äôt be running out of time with 5 minutes, surely
---
Same.  No friends :(
---
I have two formulas I use to establish the value of things for sale.
---
The first is an easy one. It's what I use to set prices on most things that aren't legendary weapons and armor and that's 1.5x. Every Plan, aid item, or junk item has a value set by the game. For instance: The recipe for Stimpacks is worth 500 caps. If I sell it for less than that I'm losing money -- especially with the 10% Bethesda Tax.
---
The game (vendors) want you to pay about 2x that for those things. So for that stimpack recipe you should expect to pay about 900-1,000. So I've got to set a price that's less than what you'd pay a vendor but more than what the item is worth so I make a profit. And that price for me is 1.5x. IIOW I sell that 500 cap Recipe for 750: Bethesda takes a 10% cut so I make 675 caps which is a 35% (175 caps) 'profit' over what I like to think as the item's 'wholesale' value.
---
The second formula is a bit more complex and that's the legendary weapons and armor cost. 
---
Now at first I tried to use the various Fallout 76 markets to get an idea of what I should be charging and that's when I realized that their economic sense has a tenuous relationship with reality at best. Yes I'm sure if you've got a half dozen mules maxed out with caps, a 3\* furious explosive shotgun is worth 50,000 caps but back on planet Earth the actual value is... a bit lower.
---
So I thought to myself: What is a legendary item worth? And I decided I'm going to start with 10 times listed value, plus tax. IIOW the formula for a 3\* item is 11.1x base value. For instance a max level 50 3\* Hunters Deathclaw Gauntlet has a base value of 69 caps (so does a non-legendary minimum level Gauntlet. The game only adjusts value for condition and mods, not level or damage or legendary attributes) so I'll sell it for 766 caps. After Bethesda takes their cut I'll get 689 caps which is close enough to 10x for me.
---
However if an item is not max level or if it's only 1 or 2\* I'll revise my value downward using the following 2 modifiers: take the 11.1x price and cut it to 75% for a 2\* and 50% for a 1\*. Then I'll revise it downward again to the % of the max level. So if a 3\* deathclaw gauntlet is worth 766 caps a 2\* level 40 gauntlet will sell for 766 x .75(2\*) x .8 (40/50) = 460 caps. Bethesda takes 46 and I'll make 414 caps. And that feels fair to me.
---
Am I overcharging? Am I undercharging. I have no goddamned idea. Most prices feel right but some are a little high and some are a little low, I feel. Maybe after a while I'll see what the market bears and can come up with a more elegant and complex equation but for now the 11.1x and 1.5x rules of thumb are in play and I haven't exactly had no sales, so we'll see how it goes.
---
Yep... so much hope, fear, and confusion.  Sending out a message in a bottle for a little clarity :-)
---
level 1 junkie's rolling pin
---
Have someone stand in shallow water and either kill themselves or get killed (you can't kill them). They have to be downed and not completely dead, any explosive weapon or grenade should work as long as the final hit isn't too direct. Then you have to walk up and press x to revive with a stimpak when they're kneeling down. I'd get on and help but I can't at the moment, best of luck!
---
now you just gotta farm the new event at camp adam and get all rewards from it then farm it over and over again till you get all the possum badges to buy out the entire possum shop.
---
also congratulations on getting possum those exams are killer
---
do you mean it adds damage or reduces damage? 
---
because when you say +91 damage it sounds like it adds damage.
---
Lol

Oh nice, you used to play The Secret World too? I can understand why you're always theorycrafting new hipster builds in this game now...

By the way... have you played Path of Exile?

Can only try... so here I am :-)

I got my unicorn and it's the FE railway rifle
---
Basic economics. The new dupe process is a royal PITA and requires a mountain of resources. This means only a handful of people are doing, severely limiting the output.  See people in the market buying tens of thousands of cloth scraps at 2-4c each?  Most likely duping.
---
The reason the TSEs bottomed out in price was volume. The old dupe methods were much quicker, required significantly less mats (the arty box one was pretty much free and dead simple), and anyone who had something to dupe could do it. As a result, some people had insane quantities of high value items selling them dirt cheap. I saw a guy with 50k TSE handmades back then. People on eBay with MILLIONS of flux for sale.
---
Eh, same here.  But I tend to go for functionality over form.
---
But I may change that as I'm considering a move to a more traveled location for my shop.  Preferably near a river or lake.
---
Yesssss...  well, furious fast fire, but same feeling
---
We got it to work. Thanks manüëç
---
are you on pc? would love to stop by and browse when i get the chance.

A Gatling plasma 2 shot explosive weightless
---
Except Bethesda cant use digital money to make free content
---
Yup. It lets me start and it counts every time but when I pass number 5 it fails. I even tried in different orders. It‚Äôs frustrating
---
Ha, that‚Äôs a great story! I believe what those red vests actually were is just an optional thing that some people had to display patches on, similar to OP‚Äôs patch board in this post. We had a scoutmaster with a red jacket that was similar. They were popular with some troops around me as well, I remember seeing them at Camp Cornhusker a few times. Vests, jackets, etc that people would display things like traded Council patches, Jamboree patches, Quality Unit patches all in a row, all kinds of stuff.
---
Lol again. This morning driving I pass a house with a nice small wood pile and I did a double take. Thinking I can't just leave it there! It's split and stacked already for me
---
PREACH BROTHER!!!
---
Lmao... at least you would know what the gamble was.  I'd hate to learn I was prepping for the wrong disappointment.
---
May I ask why this would be? Just curious as not to familiar with the railway
---
Yea I had like 4:22 left at number 5! Idk I just wasn‚Äôt sure if anyone else was having issues.
---
Thank you
---
It does have the Opossum answers.
---
I don‚Äôt think you can even start it without one on. Ironically I had to put it on over my marine wetsuit üòÇ
---
The first two events (Mutagen cleanup &amp; Bug Hunt) are Dailies, so I'd expect each of them to award badges.
---
Great explanation, thanks. Hopefully they change that message to be clearer.
---
Yes, there are so many possible ways this pans out!  I wanna know what is coming.  RR Martin of game design over there...
---
I'll have to focus on getting the exams done first I'll try to do easy ones. like the hacking ones
---
I did one world and found only the tadpole count towards the backpack. Same issue here with explored places but it's probably been that way for awhile. They are done- no atoms.
---
Do the main story. Unless you want spoilers then I‚Äôll tell you.
---
My name.  Not on now tho, will be!
---
Haha the newspaper is a good touch.
---
ghoul slayer gamma gun
---
According to 76 the super mutants started in WV so either there was never a starting point or they changed the lore...
---
That or SBQ is probably how I'll eventually get it too. I'm just waiting for one of them to show up while I'm playing.
---
Yeah
---
Lvl 4 player here and that sucks I need to lvl up fast so I can do this lol
---
I mean if it doesn't serve a purpose other than to be an eyesore then i just move on and pay no mind to it. But most often than not having a floating base makes it much easier to relocate in different types of terrain, also having it elevated reduces the chances of random mobs spawn wrecking your camp as they most often spawn on the ground. 
---
I used to have a pretty well built camp only to come home to it and find it wrecked by 1 freakin mole rat. And since you only get notified that your camp is under attack is when a player is attacking it, who knows how long that mole rat have been in there. After elevating the same structure, i  always found those mobs right under my base whether it be mole rats,wolves or schorched.
---
I know level is irrelevant but sometimes you go to a place with lot of weapon, armor, and plans for sale but it seems geared towards newer players or I already have all those plans cause the person is below lvl 50. Well with showing legendary I meant it would say next to the weapon and armor counter we have already that there is legendaries under those or not, it just won't tell us what legendaries they are. I'm wondering if all the players vending is causing all my disconnects, had to restart the game and launcher to fix it.
---
Well, we are the ‚Äúbest and brightest‚Äù.
---
Yeah I did the other 3. But just like everyone else no goo shows up and the scout master doesn't give me the mission.  So it still shows on the mai screen 3/4 completed, but in the pip boy they have all 4 missions checked off
---
Tinkers work bench (maybe chemistry) to make the jar.
---
I built mine floating because it makes moving easier. Less futzing with the terrain slope when I just need to set my camp down in a remote location.
---
Lvl 4 here and I agree let us buy it and make the mods available threw the challenges
---
true the game has random events, and each new patch adds more random events in! One time I found two sheepsquatches in a row &gt;_&gt; &lt;_&lt;
---
My only suggestion would be to try reloading unfortunately. Had an issue with the water park pictures not registering on the same question line, someone here suggested reloading and it worked.
---
Apparently it‚Äôs offline tomorrow for bug fixes again, maybe this is one of the things they will fix.
---
was this through the vendor that it was a visual bug?
---
i have over 15k recipes even after resetting the game i can take them out and drop them and even trade them still.
---
You dont need picture space for the challenges, they still count if your library is maxed out.
---
Buddy...I spent 45 of the most frustrating minutes last night trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, I hope they fix/better explain it too.
---
You walk up to a Frog and there will be a prompt to Capture it.
---
Unfortunately, placing it in your CAMP doesn't seem to trigger the "Craft a Frog Habitat" challenge to clear. üòí

Oops haha I guess I thought you were OP...didn‚Äôt look at the usernames. Sorry.
---
Shoot the wolf with the syringe is broken in chemist possum challenge

Literally my favorite weapon, cripples lims easy, I play as a raider, auto piston mod is mad nuts, and ammo is only steel no lead or bs also furious is ridiculous I drop legendary sheepsquatch to half health with a full mag
---
Looking for someone to revive gt phat dastard, will let you do same
---
Do you get to keep pet frogs in it?
---
That is pretty cool and not something I knew. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Yea this is a good idea. Hopefully they fix the bugs with the other challenges as well.
---
Your frustration has helped others so hopefully net positive.
---
Im all ears
---
Although I am not certain, but if you were able to drop before then perhaps you put a Paint on it?
---
Anything from the ATOMIC shop cant be dropped. You‚Äôll have to remove the paint, then you can drop them.
---
The ones that don‚Äôt require RNG are Archery, code breaker and hunter. 
---
You can craft all the weapons and don‚Äôt require any camera.
---
Code breaker is tough but I can‚Äôt find that camera for crap.
---
I totally understand how you feel! I had this happen to me when I tried to start up the Encryptid event for the first time. Still haven't gotten around to crafting another recall card to try again.
---
The ones scattered about on the houses don't do anything yet. Same as all of the ones in the hotel (except 1).
---
I still have them
---
Yeah, it's great!
---
You‚Äôre about the third post regarding this I‚Äôve see today, so it‚Äôs **not just you**
---
Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt really been following it specifically as I had no issue &lt;.&lt;
---
Best of luck though!
---
Broken on xbox
---
BE laser rifle. Hands down.
---
chemistry bench
---
No there is no paint on it at all - I have three that I just found today and repaired.... nothing else has been done to them
---
I did Treadly's quest and didnt get a badge?
---
It eventually just marked this quest completed for me after restarted the game a few times. I literally did nothing and it just marked it completed.
---
Workshops already have the fast travel spawn point. Same mechanic from FO4. It‚Äôs a simple door mat.
---
canceling the trade from the stash box when someone is buying it will do this. the trader gets to keep both caps and the item.
---
i found this out when i realised one of my items was miss priced. so i kind of jsut opened the stash box while someone was trying to buy it.
---
My team mate did right in front of me, it failed him the first time then passed the second. He just did them in a different order the second time.
---
That's incredibly random...
---
Yeah, I thought the same
---
Then I tried to do the Codebreaker exam
---
And it assumed I have, or could find even rudimentary knowledge of coding :/
---
Spoiler
---
&gt;!I could not!&lt;
---
It triggered again
---
Purely out of curiosity, why?
---
Ill probably give it another go tomorrow, i got a 2nd keycard incase i fucked the 1st one up
---
it‚Äôs a trap!
---
Just accepted sorry it‚Äôs a bit late
---
Thanks, if it helps one person I'll count it as a win. I made a post almost word for word, but it didn't get any traction..lol
---
Lol I don‚Äôt want my camp overrun with jarred frogs ü§£ü§£
---
It‚Äôs a single glass jar with a live frog inside, not an entire aquarium/tank.
---
No worries. Omw

I need to craft an ingredient that requires it for the pioneer scout challenge
---
I'm just commenting to look at this later

Chemistry ..under science project
---
Would be cool. Ginseng would be neat. I just need more space in my camp.
---
You wanna try and join me the scorchedbeast Queen event has started
---
Ahhhhhhh. I know what ur talking about, luckily my friend had the perm active and just shared it w me. Those challenges are a pain in the ass.
---
Doing so now
---
Can you display it like the easter eggs and plushy bunny? Or just another item in your inv?
---
Swimming works
---
Different for everyone. My bloodied explosive LMG melts everything. I only use it for boss characters though. Otherwise it‚Äôs my instigating silenced hand made full stealth. One extreme to another lol
---
See this person camp counselors hate this person
---
the order i did it in (while wearing swimming suit) was wait til the timer actually starts and than go to the red thing to the right than turn left and grab those before heading straight toward the other ones on the other side of the lake.
---
Disagree.
---
Actually, what's going to keep you alive in front of the Scorchbeast Queen is - in addition to all the normal stuff like Serendipity and Dodgy - a couple ranks in Suppressor.  As long as you continue to hit her, Suppressor is going to do the Cav/Sent thing and reduce her damage output.
---
I'm fairly capable, but I couldn't go face-to-face with her.  Always had to waste time maneuvering behind her.  But with Suppressor, it's night-and-day.  I can stand right in front of her and tank whatever she throws at me.
---
Single star hunters tire iron. Got one going for only 25,000 caps if you want it ? üòÇ
---
Dang all I got is 24999 and I don‚Äôt want to take advantage of you
---
I tried that but unfortunately it's still gone as now I only have 5.
---
Itd be sweet if we could get nuked flora too, at least a trade off for a destroyed base lol.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
They should make it count if you auto-revive yourself with whatever that legendary armor effect that gives a 50% chance to revive.
---
unless you don't have friends.
---
There goes the rest of my night
---
Code breakers is a go for me.
---
That's crazy then. Haven't had that happen yet. *Fingers crossed
---
I got it. Just keep checking out items and fast traveling, lol.
---
Can someone tell me what changed?  I tuned out of this game for a long time, but if it is better now I might give it another shot
---
This was my problem. I felt so dumb when I noticed I still had it on. Took it off, bow wore down pretty quick. Then I forgot I took it off, and broke my main weapon in like 20 minutes, and felt even dumber.
---
I even went back and forth from the dock to each mark. So I‚Äôm going to try again tomorrow first thing.
---
Interesting. I'd imagine an explosive instigating hunting rifle modded out to look like the anti materiel rifle and named such would sell for quite a doozy
---
With all the legendary gear I've been hoarding this is the only move
---
Cat and bramhain at flatwoods, you may need to server hop for the cat though.
---
Depends on what you wanna do pvp or pve
---
It‚Äôs on display with croaking sounds and everything!
---
I think closing out the game will make it reappear
---
Lucky. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve broken 1500 caps
---
One day it‚Äôll be ‚ÄúFallout was better when it was full of broken quests and bugs!‚Äù
---
Aw who am I kidding, it‚Äôs Bethesda
---
It‚Äôs a camp item.
---
4 points for Lone Wanderer, 4 points for Travel Agent and Hard Bargain. Those 2 set ups are my only Charisma cards on each of my characters.
---
thank you. I never would have known
---
You are not. It sounds just like em.
---
Thanks, Brahmin must be all milked out for me though.
---
Sweet. I like frogs.. Thanks.
---
I'll do it for you if you do it for me.
---
I'm krorkle on PC.
---
I usually take some if I‚Äôm below 20 purified waters, and usually dump some of I‚Äôm over 50
---
Speaker at too or bottom of hill?
---
I like the challenge. Peoples complaining has removed most of what was left of challenges. If everything is insanely easy to get and the game was just flat out easy, how long are you going to stay interested in the game? They are struggling to keep up with people‚Äôs demands of more content but because players want to beat it in five minutes, they complain. Then you have players like me that ask what the hell bethesda. The burrows was a five minute quest.
---
Yes I‚Äôd like the backpack but I‚Äôm happy that I have something in the game that I want, that doesn‚Äôt take five whole minutes to get. Unpopular opinion of mine I‚Äôm sure but whatever. I didn‚Äôt buy this game to appease others, nor did I buy it expecting handouts.
---
Alright are you on now?
---
SOLD!! ü§£
---
Skyrim into?
---
What about with the men tats buff ?
---
Yep.
---
Fair warning, I don't have a mic.  Is that okay?
---
I‚Äôve got the exact opposite problem, now that there‚Äôs player vending I‚Äôve been putting on every weight saving perk I‚Äôve got so I can go on scavenging runs for materials and chems.
---
Even put the bobble head and magazine finders back on
---
Good question.
---
I find those from time-to-time and I'm not sure what to make of them.  I'm not sure I've ever successfully dodged anything in this game because the timing is so wacky.
---
If you're going for raw damage, bloodied + nerd rage + adrenal reaction + bolstering/unyielding armor makes the whole game trivial
---
Yah just go flatwoods
---
Thanks again for the help!
---
Nothing happens when you complete the exams. Unless it‚Äôs the last thing on that chain to complete of course.
---
Nobody is buying my free watoga flyers either... :(
---
Check your challenges, in then'World' tab there are a bunch of Scout ones. The exams are for those.
---
Haven't gotten badge currency either
---
God bless your soul

Whwre did you do skill 1 and 3 hackinf by chance?

Was just about to add this too. Top tip!

Are you referring to yourself? I can help you if you‚Äôd like. Are you on PS4?
---
Thanks man.
---
xbox sorry.
---
Thanks guys. I'd been trying to get that done for hours üòÅ
---
Well, then It would go around killing all the players who want 25k caps for an alien blaster. Lol
---
Theres a bunch of cats at the blue billboard, just south of the road leading to the top of the world. Just before the supermutant raider camp
---
I think people who liked other Fallouts at all should play and see for themselves.  Ive put much more time into this game than the other fallouts and I dont keep playing a game if Im bored.
---
I just did the event and didn't get any badge for it. I tried different methods so that the list can refresh but it didn't. I dunno about the event ...
---
Yeah for sure! My goal is to keep one of each of the unique New Vegas weapons in stock at all times.
---
Endurance cards in general I would avoid as the survival aspects of the game are pretty easy to get around anyway.  The only good ones IMO from that tree are adamantium skeleton, sun kissed and photosynthetic or radicool (only if you play a bloodied build. If you're playing solo only take lone wanderer but most of the other charisma cards are pretty useful if you play in teams.  The farming cards in the luck tree (Scrounger, Pharma Farmer) are pretty good for getting rarer ammo types and chems lile disease cures.  Early game definitely go for the cards that reduces item weight as carry weight is a big issue.  Putting lots of points into strength will help with this issue as well.
---
Thanks man! It's like the equivalent of a game genie and looking up the codes in the book.
---
Okay so....I was wrong. I had it in third person. I never went invisible. They just say that I guess....I don‚Äôt know

Bethesda taxes 10% of purchases made through player vending for some fucking odd  reason.

Xbox one :(
---
To be fair, I don't have Goat Legs or Aqua Boy either.  If I want to leap from a high ledge, I slip into my Power Armor or fast travel.  I had a piece of armor that offered the Aqua Boy/Girl effect, but like I said, there really aren't many places where it comes in useful, so I sold it.

I gave up on reconciling things like that after some people were having fits over how unrealistic scorchbeasts are. Tiny lizard to Deathclaw is fine, crab to Mirelurk Queen is fine, human to super mutant behemoth is fine, but somehow bat to scorchbeast isn't?
---
Dude I've never hoped i was wrong so much. I appreciate you trying
---
Right.  Game is too easy?  There are countless ways to make it more difficult for yourself.  Make a new rule and follow it.
---
Omg these fucking challenges are a nightmare,it's probably gonna take me weeks of trying , unless I justgive up altogether. It doesn't make it shy better than nothing can be tracked like a proper quest, I just wasted 30 mins trying to find the starting point for one of the athletic challenges.
---
I see what u did there. Upvote
---
F my bro, try searching the monument, winding path and the battle cemetary, all 3 are right near each other.. saves caps
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried that like 6 times, thanks anyway

Well problem with blocking legendary is its only 15% so its way lower then cavalier and sentinel but still.

Skill one at Sunday Brothers Cabin for 1 and Grafton Dam for 3.
---
Happy to help. Thank you as well!
---
Really! That's cool! I will check it out, thanks!
---
i like the challenge too, i mean, i'm a huge dark souls fanatic but surely there should be a ramp-up to difficulty and better rewards right? just because i want something to be easier to obtain doesnt mean they have to compromise the entire thing, difficulty in the right spots can make even the most mundane things interesting.  
---
i just want the baseline backpack to be easier to obtain, that's it. the mods can be as hard as they want it to be if they're worth farming. it's pretty disingenuous to suggest that lowering baseline difficulty for baseline rewards is "appeasing" anybody nor is it automatically trivializing all facets of difficulty.

---
Well i was actually considering using 2 of those points to move to Perception for those 2 finders. Mainly because they said they are planning to add magazine and bobble head racks that actually function. So I wanted to stock up so I can furnish them on day one.
---
Thank you so much
---
 I did the event and got no badge. Maybe my badge list is bugged because at some point it showed 0 despite knowing i have 3 badges already.
---
I tried this because my visitors always spawn under my windmill. I moved my camp module to the opposite end of my camp and they still spawn under my windmill.
---
But mom, I want my points! Im a shooter boy not a punching boy!
---
I wish they would either scale more toward level and difficulty or just make different difficulties. Obviously, harder would be the better reward.
---
I did the same. All the plans and ammo I would have just dropped somewhere that somebody might find them now go in my vending machine for free. I'll assume they aren't being resold as nobody has gone through and taken everything at once. Its all been one plan or one type of ammo with a couple that did both.
---
It‚Äôs a glass jar you can place just like you place the egg, yes

Shut up and I also agree with this guy :) you‚Äôre awesome as this game is awesome

Has anybody actually timed the decay rate of food being sold? I have been selling the same food I use for crit and luck boosting, in my machine, and it seems that food in the vending machine lasts longer then in my pocket. I‚Äôll craft a stack and keep a few and sell the extra and when I come back to get more food it‚Äôs always spoiled more in my pocket then the machine. I‚Äôm not 100% but I‚Äôll test it in a couple hours.

I‚Äôm doing the swimming badge and have to take pictures of the different rides at wavy Willard‚Äôs water park but I‚Äôve tried taking pics of all the rides and nothing works. Anyone else get this one?

Rad showers cure mutations too
---
Awesome. I want one. Can you give or sell it to other players?? I dont see myself devoting the time to earning everything i want because i work too damn much. Id buy it though
---
Yeah I got all of them just take a picture of the ride and not the signs
---
In the middle just after the first break. Trust me they are there. Server hop if need be but their there.

Finished it once, and got no badges as a reward
---
You just have to catch a frog at the whitesprings pool and craft a glass jar, it‚Äôs really easy
---
Raider plans for the actual armor are only implemented into one loot table in the game, for Rose's top of the world quest, meaning you only get one chance to get one plan per character. Meaning you would need at least 9 characters to be able to collect all the plans, but they aren't guaranteed, so raider armor plans are possibly the rarest item in the game
---
Nothing here at all
---
Thank you.
---
I've had that exact problem as well. I was also in watoga when it happened.
---
They often spawn under the bridge at Harper's ferry. Maybe server hop. Also house location next to hunters shack I think also is a hard spawn
---
They added player vending so you can sell your stuff to other players, backpacks, plus a whole new quest line with it, and many other things I can‚Äôt think of at the top of my head
---
Unfortunately I havent had any other dailies come up since I installed mine. Been down to camden so many times hoping to have one spawn
---
FUCK ME THE PROGRESS RESET WHEN I SEVER HOPPED WTF. WHERE STE THESE THINGS?!?!
---
In my opinion you're half right. Less interesting but better rewards lol, although The Fixer from the van lowe quest is pretty good
---
Same, gonna updoot too. Athletics and swimming are killing me.
---
Damn. Only other place I know of that has active spawns for them is a small pool of water in the mire. That‚Äôs either before the ruined church or after it.
---
if we can die in water for swimming badge then i'm in
---
Oh. Well maybe ill try tonight.
---
I just wish we had a fast travel mat
---
Right, whereas I look at this explicit choice and ask myself if it's really *my* choice, or am I just going to a different chapter in someone else's choose-your-own-adventure novel.  I don't think this is an inherently bad thing, but I have a problem when others insist that this is the *only* way RPGs can operate.
---
The Stanley Parable is a parody of this.  You've never out from under the narrator's thumb.  Even when you think you've outsmarted him, he has a whole story ready to go.  It never becomes Stanley's story, or your story.
---
Whereas in a Bethesda game, they are content to just back away and watch what you do.  Yes, the main quest of Skyrim takes you to the College of Winterhold, but the main quest's whole purpose is to introduce you to these things.  It invents some reason for you to visit every town and interact with several of the guilds, even be a moderator (not a decider, unless you want to be) in the Empire-Stormcloak debate, on the way to taking down Alduin, who has little to do with any of this.  And each of these is a springboard for another adventure you can take upon yourself.
---
I quit. I'll try again tomorrow this is a massive waste if my time and frustration
---
That would be most preferable. I‚Äôm jtrag. Where do you suggest we die?
---
You need to decide on a build before anyone can recommend anything, melee, rifleman, heavy gunner ? Personally I would start with strength and go from there. I have high strength, charisma and luck trees, but it depends what you want to focus on ..
---
This should help

I would love Lincoln's Repeater from Fallout 3. That gun is still my favourite weapon in all of the Bethesda made Fallout games.
---
Yes I agree with you both. My main's demesne has a large office like steel monstrosity which awes but is hardly what you call homey. This being fantasy however and me having stuff to do as well as lots of characters to do it with dictates a certain pragmatism.
---
I am however proud of the feat of engineering accomplished in turning a wooden foot bridge over a couple of bog trenches into what looks like the headquarters of a medium-sized company complete with five industrial water purifiers *all indoors*.

Did u rewind the tape?

I guest book would be awesome. Especially if you could hop on and leave a little note for the owner. I'd put mine near the entrance just for the authenticity.

I absolutely love how FO is slowing turning into a small functioning society. In excited to see what else they have in store.
---
I was selling my VTU jacket for like 20 Caps because I had multiple, and someone came along and bought it then resold it for 2,000 caps. I don't know if anybody actually bought it for that much, but I passed by his camp after he stopped by mine and saw it in his wares.
---
Anti material rifle is still my big want for the game, it could match the stats for the gauss and still be classed as a rifle rather than heavy weapon.
---
The service rifle would have to be a skin as the bulk of them are off on west coast. But would be cool if a crate of them got ‚Äúlost‚Äù
---
He wasn‚Äôt there tho
---
Did you build another one? Or it just checked off?
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic, sorry. How about we see if there‚Äôs a deathclaw on deathclawisland?
---
Hell yeah definetly
---
This would be ideal, and hopefully will be coming soon. We know its possible.
---
Nice good idea üòÉ
---
Fuck yeah I loved that thing too
---
at the water park you can jump off a slide into a pool easily .
---
I just checked off.  There is a hot fix tomorrow and I hope this is one of the issues they fix
---
Right at Solly dods, just server hop and go to the building behind where you meet the robot, I got blood bugs, and everything except sting wings ... even ticks near by ..

---
If so I would guess they have to do with the new Pioneer challenge that wants you to do mothman related things.
---
I'm hungry for it. I'll need it.
---
Thanks, this seems to fit exactly what I have experienced
---
\*blink\*
---
\*blink blink\*
---
... So, I'm not *exactly* sure what I read, or even if I fully understood what transpired. lol
---
However, consider my interest fully piqued with regards to the "trap" you mentioned!  
---
Given I don't bother much with traps (or even turrets, for that matter), does anyone know if any **do** function as a "springboard" like OP stated? Cuz this sounds like all sorts of fun to play around with at my camp....  
---
I know there are one or two on the map that let you launch skeletons, but those are static map structures that the map-makers added. Which, I never figured they'd work on a player, given the huge different in weight :P
---
No it's me
---
and they turned into something
---
Personally, I love the game and all of the updates Bethesda has came out with for it so far. But I don't think it will be a hit, unless they just completely reboot the game with no/minimal bugs and change everything. I think it will remain a niche game, but I'm fine with that as long as they keep releasing new stuff for the game. 
---
But that's just my opinion, and I should say I couldn't get into ESO so my opinion could be shit to others lol.

That's fricative. They were saying frictive. You just said fricitive... Also not a word.

They were the metal things with spikes that sit on the floor. When powered and triggered, they catapult you. IDK how to even use them they never work
---
Stay classy reddit.
---
Where are you trying
---
I don't know.  In terms of lighting, I feel the Ash Heap has this Twin Peaks thing going on, especially when you look toward the tree line.  This hazy look gives it this surreal, otherworldly quality.  On the other hand, between marked locations, there's quite a lot of nothing.  And I mean *really* nothing.  Gravel and rocks.
---
Nope....got stuck in the machine.....lol
---
switching those stupid fucking perks in and out is a real dumb system design. it's a pain in the ass to swap out lockpicking/hacking/repair/crafting/ammo

dont even try to mention different builds.

---
rofl, i shall remember that, good one
---
I've considered doing this, but I have a concern. If i get a mutation or two i want to keep, and then i get one i dont want, is there a way to target the specific mutation you want to rid?? I dont want to pop a radaway and end up losing an important mutation and keeping the shitty one.
---
There are 15 at dolly sods, they aways spawn at top of the world too
---
I have a new one too, but I had close to 300 hours and 130-140 levels worth of work put into the first one. And mine isn‚Äôt a perma-ban, I suppose I am ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù, so I was just trying to get a time frame.
---
It didn‚Äôt until they buffed it.  Now it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúHoly Shit‚Äù every time.
---
I go some place to get paid, but redditing isn't exactly why I'm there, so that part isn't working.
---
And I've lost all my loot
---
....... Grrrrr
---
Totally dependent on your playstyle, but a critical riflan build would probably be your best bet. You could focus it either into stealth or vats, or a little bit of both, depending on what you prefer. But it involves mainly high perception, agility, and luck. 
---
Obviously the rifleman perks, tank killer, concentrated fire (perception) better critical, grim reapers Sprint and four leaf clover (luck). Stealth perks are in agility (sneak, mister sandman, covert ops). Also bloody mess, gun Fu, adrenaline are under agility.
---
That's why the lighting is different! I thought it was the sort of error that crops up occasionally in interior cells (though it was a little nicer, I suppose, being purposeful and all.)
---
Nah thats the only thing. You get a random mutation cocktail. No way to target certain mutations.
---
I always check google before i ask here
---
Dupes? The recipes used to drop from the queen and I know ppl who are still buying the recipes from the bunker.
---
Could you not revive me?
---
I just started using it with stabilized and it blows my mind. I made it prime because it was easier to get ammo for it that way.lol
---
Yeah, but if you get a Frog and have a Jar, and build the resulting object in your CAMP (under Floor Decor, IIRC), it doesn't count the objective.
---
That would explain why I‚Äôm not 1-2 shorting everything. Consumables make sense now!
---
no you sank too far haha.  can you not hear me talking?
---
‚ÄúI pwned ur retared-luking base u fuking n00b, lul!!!!1‚Äù
---
Yeah, no thanks. :)
---
‚ÄòI‚Äôll never trust them again. Would you...?‚Äô  üòÑ
---
Nope, not at all. Can‚Äôt believe I missed the water that time. Coming...
---
Yeah, everyone thinks, don‚Äôt do prime but you can make more ammo for way less.
---
I want to buy a Fasnacht Beret. Thanks!
---
To me yes I‚Äôve gotten 300+ hours out of it
---
I'm also curious, given I'm lvl 137 and only know of two that function: One inside the resort on the far back wall, and the one at the "Bunker Back Entrance" fast travel location (which you need to complete a quest for it to show up).
---
All the ones inside that are next to actual wood doors, as well as the ones outside at various resort houses... I've just assumed will be for some future update, since they've always been inaccessible to me.
---
You‚Äôd imagine an option for your camp to show on the map without vending should be relatively simple really. It‚Äôs a good idea bud.
---
Ive borrowed water because people forget to lock the purifiers
---
That‚Äôs great advice
---
Stimpak diffuser isn't in game yet, added next update - a beth employee

thanks for the links!
---
Yup the glut of legendaries saved up will soon be depleted.

Thank you.  I keep like 10 of them on me right now.  It's gotten me out of a few jams.
---
You're stupid and wrong. And you seem like you'd be unbearable to be around.
---
And still going strong?
---
it did it again! haha
---
It wouldn‚Äôt let me ‚Äúcall for help‚Äù either. Any ideas?
---
Yes I seen the reply but the reply was after the video and after I posted that. Apparently that will still be the event you get it from. The guy who said he already got one was a liar he just read it somewhere that someone data-mined it
---
It happens when the game thinks you are over-encumbered.
---
The thing is, as a Bloodied, you're probably running a lot of perks that buff Strength in some way, be it Radicool, Unyielding Armor, Adrenal Reaction etc.  When you die, these are lost in a rather sloppy manner and the game will decide you are over-encumbered, even if you weren't at the point when you died.
---
I'd say now is a good time, especially with player vending. You can get things you need for a lot cheaper than trying to buy from the NPC vendors.
---
I'd hope so, I want people to join my Enclave!
---
Let me know what you find out.
---
Does it cost that much?  I got it for 35 in December.
---
could let these sorched beat you up
---
Interesting...
---
I know someone has or can make twisted muscles. Cmon people
---
Yeah I'm on PSN and it's still $59.99. Really wishing I would've grabbed it last time they had it on sale since you can't get PSN game codes anymore from what I've read
---
Wait I‚Äôm confused. So you‚Äôre fast traveling to peoples vending machines and spawning inside their house but you‚Äôre finding yourself being locked in?
---
It gets kinda boring once you complete all the quests but they keep adding more so
---
I've heard it's a random reward for the Campfire event.  But I didn't get it.
---
And to be honest, that's a pretty long-winded event.  Cool the first time but, yeah.  I don't see myself grinding that one for recipe.
---
omg im so sorry.
---
Maybe add a fridge mod for a vendor....
---
Or maybe down the line add different vendors, like a food vending machine that you could earn through a questline.
---
You run out of things to buy eventually. I don't buy things I will never use just to spend caps, and searching trade sites is not my thing. I get 1400 a day from vendors, plus around another 500 off of bodies, maybe more. Probably 100-200 from events. SBQ gives you 200 caps so that's easy money as well.
---
I started following low level player flashing my gift signs until they stop and look in my doodo bag.
---
It timed out. Did you get it or no? That worked at least. (This is unbelievable!)
---
My main problem is that I have nothing to sell
---
haha i didnt get it.  you need anything for your troubles?
---
üòÄüëçüèª
---
As a socialist this offends me.
---
Try again
---
He may have been at a train station and pulled the item out of his stash?
---
Yet no matter how much you build on PS4, it performs great. We can definitely have bigger build budgets, I think it's safe to say something is wrong with your PC if it can't handle what a PS4 can. I'm pretty sure we get the exact same build budgets after all.
---
I havent had any issues or seen anyone post about it
---
Ready?
---
Yes.
---
What was the big deal of deleting duped items? Dupers deserved to have as much of their cheating erased.
---
Currently my dream weapon(s) would be:  
---
Bloodied Two-Shot Quad &lt;any rifle&gt; (but specifically a Gauss or Lever-action, maybe also Gat Plasma)  
---
Bloodied Armor-Piercing Weightless Power Fist or Super Sledge
---
*^(('dream weapons' implies I)* ***^(don't)*** *^(have these, in case anyone wonders))*
---
I always get a ‚Äúover encumbered‚Äù alert when I leave servers or my health hits a point where my carry weight goes up, even though I am not actually over-encumbered. So your explanation seems to make perfect sense, thank you!
---
Yes, this happens all the time
---
Mine are filled with shame and sweat. Drink up.
---
Ah okay. Well I can't complain about getting a few hundred hours out of it at the very least. Appreciate the info!
---
its not even giving me the option to revive you.  we're doomed
---
They extended it already it used to be 5 minutes. Its also extended if you play a instrument/sit or lie down.
---
Shhh you dont Liberty Prime to hear you.
---
Maybe
---
Starched Genes keeps em
---
LoL. 
---
I'm sure you're winning personality completely convinced them.
---
LoL.
---
Im hoping more floors open up in the whitesprings
---
Joking or not, I actually found one of those a couple months back, but it was lvl 5, and pretty sure Anti-Armor as well. 
---
I made it Aluminum and hucked it into the Overseer's Stash in Flatwoods Church. :)
---
What I hate most is people who sell weapons and armor for like 500 per star, and here I am selling for 200-300 per star
---
Exactly. If the places were cool and fun to explore I wouldn't mind but 9 put of 10 times it's such a bland boring camp. Pointless to lock up in my opinion. Resource extractors, water, sure I get that. But why lock your door when you have nothing inside....
---
nope i can't get the kiddies corner cabin bot to trigger even on the second day here so still screwed on this quest ATM
---
Oof. Yeah guess it wasnt clear it was a joke.
---
I can already hear his captalist stomping! I gotta go!
---
This has been an issue for a while - and I unfortunately can't check if it's fixed atm - but it has been impossible to repair the War Drum up to 200% durability with Weapon Artisan, similar to the issue that Grognak's Axe was having. Unfortunately I'm not sure if it got the same love Groggy did with this patch. Can anyone confirm/deny whether it's still impossible to repair the War Drum to 200% durability?
---
Sorry? 
---
You get it?
---
woohoo  that got me the backpack.  thanks
---
It looks exactly like whats in the atom shop. The Horsemen skin are fixed models, they don't paint the individual different PAs.
---
I don't think it's that bad. It's what I imagine moving up the ranks in a real scout group might be in that it takes a lotta work and you gotta earn it. I'm having a blast.
---
The rule of thumb is that vendors sell their items for 2x the listed value of the item. Doesn't matter if it's stimpacks, plans, ammo or 3\* legendaries. With Hard Bargain 3 that goes down to about 1.87x. Less with grape mentats, etc. I myself for all standard (non legendary) items start at about 1.5x and tweak the price to a good round number from there.
---
This is good praxis
---
Damage increase over 100% is broken/gone
---
Awesome! Thanks! That was one of the most ‚Äúfallout‚Äù things I‚Äôve ever experienced.
---
Are you sure it's not just invisible on Trapper armor?  I'm pretty sure when I equipped it on mine, essentially nothing happened.
---
It definitely shows up for Marine and Combat.  I think the base model is a bit too wide for my tastes (but hey, that's what the Atomic Shop is for - we know there are a *lot* of backpack designs coming down the pipe).
---
No they didn't. They deserved to have account wipes. Leaving them with at least one of each duped item just meant they could still start over and resume duping. 
---
This could have been reserved for obvious dupers, like the ones with tens of thousands of nuka-colas. This alone was a major wrecking ball to the economy as they could buy anything they wanted for caps as they had an unlimited supply.
---
Maybe if they actually finished the game before releasing it, they wouldn't have so many bloody updates!
---
DJ_Dribbles
---
Its still a work in progress.
---
Still workin on it
---
I‚Äôm with you, I never locked anything except my fusion reactor. But people do it because they‚Äôre afraid of people messing with their shit which now is impossible since camps don‚Äôt take any damage. But it‚Äôs funny because earlier today I really needed to use someone‚Äôs camp to craft something and it was literally just a huge metal box that was locked. I thought exactly what you did, he should‚Äôve just left it open. It‚Äôs literally impossible to damage someone‚Äôs camp now
---
I don't disagree. That would've been ideal.
---
No problem dude, enjoy
---
Yeah no problem
---
I‚Äôm sorry, the fascists always have the best uniforms!
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. Seemed to fix itself today though, so maybe just close app and re-log?
---
Yeah, it's probably the same underlying reason.  I can never enter/exit a server without hearing the over-encumbered sound effects either.
---
Maybe allow us to take notes/add entries
---
I‚Äôm not a duper, unless my one time obtainable quest items were duped and deleted between sessions...
---
Okay thanks i havent relogged in yet will try that later today.
---
Yeah precisely.
---
Ah was that what you meant? I apologise for any misunderstanding
---
assheap
---
Yes
---
It's a side quest for Lying Lowe quest line.
---
They do spawn during heart of the swamp. Still a bit rare and difficult, but definitely possible.
---
The next one is called squirrel according to the banner locked in the camp menu
---
Ayyyyyyyy I got the same one but with +1 strength.

I got it after 4 server hops at the water park
---
I can make them I just need Brahmin milk
---
Adding to the discussion regarding camp budget:  I had 27/30 slots filled, and 722/800 on my stash.   I went to add a pistol(which was already in my stash) to the "for sale" list and got the "c.a.m.p budget exceeded" message.   Looked at my bar...yeah, it's full...so I deleted 5 melon plants on suspicion of budget fuckery.  Went back to sell the gun, bam... It works.
---
So, 100% uses budget to sell stuff.     Beats me if I know why though. 
---
Possibly related to the fact that The game remembers which machine is selling what items.  Meaning, if I put a gun in machine X,  then you can't buy it from machine Y which I also own. 
---
I imagine there is a bit of a load put on the servers by that functionality
---
There is a surprising amount in Toxic Valley at the top of the map too
---
I can do that. Ign?
---
Thats awesome! You on Xbox?
---
I wasnt sure if I wanted to keep mine or go with the 40 scrip... Right up until I got the brilliant name idea
---
I've seen quite a few in Toxic Valley
---
I mean, if buying it was an option in the store, wouldn't everybody have relit the P2W torches?
---
Reddit is too calm on that front to be the full pack in the store.
---
I did probably 8 server hops at the water park and the rest at the lighthouse
---
i‚Äôm not a possum yet but if you can describe the task at hand i could help
---
are you just looking for a sign with ‚Äúhorn right industrial‚Äù on it?
---
I don't think you remember how bad ESO's launch was, it was at least on the same level of F76 if not worse
---
There is always bloodbugs, stingrays and bloatflys on free range
---
Which console? Not that it matters, but  if it's friends to play with you might consider these reddit subs as a place to look for some. Not entirely sure where you'd find a full price version these days, as it's usually on sale/ 2nd hand somewhere. Some will argue it was never worth $60, and is now only getting to where it should have been at launch. And others will argue it is worth more due to the work that has been done since launch. Take both camps thoughts, and make your own judgement.
---
Yes!
---
I completely agree, they rock! Thank you all.
---
Agreed.  I normally don't grab ammo I don't use, but I would if I could bulk it and sell it on the cheap for someone else to use.
---
I have a basic rectangle but decorated all over in and around it, does that count?
---
Thats the price i set, more than I get from a vendor and cheaper than they can buy from vendor. Less than 500 is a loss, or a gift.
---
Hey could you lead me to the shooting range?
---
As long as it doesn‚Äôt look completely empty inside, sure
---
Guest books and tip jars have been brought up many times and the idea is always popular.
---
I feel like this game is evolving into it's own genre and it's going to be hard to shake the launch PTSD, but if people give it a chance it will really pick up steam I reckon.
---
could use a revive if you're still around
---
IGN: longlongmaaaan
---
I'm on PS4 but none of my friends seem to want to give it a chance, even at a cheaper price. Thanks for the tip though
---
\*Soviet Anthem stops\*
---
Needs a Genie
---
If on Xbox I'll meet that 500 gt phat dastard
---
Any updates/confirmations to this?
---
I'm not on now. But I need six Brahmin milk I'll make three for both of us
---
Patch 8.5, only my Melee/Unarmed weapons would increase in Damage when repaired beyond 100%. My Gauss or Lever-action wouldn't. 
---
I found that rather odd...
---
However, I only recently started using Melee/Unarmed, and I can't say I've noticed my guns increasing in damage for a long time. This ***does*** make me curious though, because I made a post last month or so, about having sworn that crafting guns resulted in higher damage just like crafted armor will have increased DR. Problem is, that thinking was based off playing with my friend, as she was the weapon-smith between us (I being the armor-smith). After I made an Alt to play solo on, and that char does everything, I never noticed my guns having increased damage...which is why I made said post asking. 
---
So while I recently just chalked it up to being "how things are" in 76 regarding guns, I can't help but question it now that you've mentioned damage. 
---
*(Note: I haven't updated 76 to Patch 9 yet due to monthly bandwidth limits, but that resets in a few hours... so I can't comment on whether anything has changed for me, personally, since 8.5)*
---
I had a magnificent camp equidistant by close to two breach spots and a lode baring....   I moved to site alpha this week though for easy resin and the lake
---
Unequip gunsmith. It degrades pretty quickly without it.
---
im a chef in the game and i do wanna sell the huge variety of meats to my customers, but sadly i would have to do it in person since i have good salt maxed out so they dont expire quickly, all i sell in my vending machine is canned food stuff and non-expired drinks :(
---
Smokeys Steakhouse is all about the MEAT! not canned food items!
---
My Brahmin has quit giving her milk as well.
---
K. Just tell me when your on and I'll bring it
---
Exactly. Instead of everybody being a total stranger and little more than just a blip on my map, now it actually feels like we know each other and came out of the same vault like we were supposed to. If I‚Äôm wandering around and get over-encumbered, I can just look at my map and be like, ‚ÄúOh Bobby‚Äôs camp is nearby! I‚Äôll swing by so I can rest, fix my gear, and see if he has anything good to trade.‚Äù I fucking love it. Such a simple change, but makes the game feel entirely new.
---
Most places you can buy the game physical are selling for far less than digital btw, but you still end up with a digital copy because Beth packaged codes and not discs
---
Teapot Event. All kinds of creatures.
---
I don‚Äôt know why I never got it before. I‚Äôve blown through stimpacks so much. Now, I haven‚Äôt used 1 yet. I never knew what mutations did and I didn‚Äôt like the negatives of them until I was explained the perk cards. I really do appreciate it
---
Same.
---
Thanks.  I might even just leave them at the default price then.  Right now I'm not really selling anything that I don't have too much of.
---
Ok what system are you on
---
Happened yesterday started selling fasnact plans for 250(made like 4000caps in less than an hour).Then saw a guy selling them for like 10-50 depending but resold them all already.
---
Pc
---
Haven't started them yet, don't care about spoilers...
---
What level of BS are we talking here? Gettin around fine as it is, was gonna wait a few days for the storm to die down before starting this whole thing.
---
Exact same thing happened to me tonight. I have like 60 in my stash, and I tried to put them in the vending machine, but it would only put 2 up for sale. When I moved them from my stash to my inventory, it kept increasing the count in the stash. Eventually had like 1500+. But server hopping fixed it, so I'm assuming it wasn't actually duping them, just a display bug.
---
The only one I got was Medic
---
It's not "they're too powerful" it's "We were promised nothing of that sort would be in the shop". 
---
When the VP of the company, who's in charge of PR, who's in charge of what information is released to the company either has no say in what happens, or flat out lies to us, that company _gets no more money_ from me.
---
I never understood that. A locked door did exactly nothing to stop a griefer. They can lockpick the door, destroy the door, or destroy the walls around the door.
---
The only ones I've seen that resemble what you speak of, are the Wood Planks with Nails attached to springs (like at Camden Park under the roller coaster).
---
I've never tried making one at my CAMP, but I would suspect they require a Tripwire (mechanical or laser) to be attached to them. I also suspect a Pressure Plate may also work, but that's electrical so I'm not sure.
---
Two of the steps in the Possum: Mining challenge are "Sign in at Garrahan Mining HQ and Sign in at Hornwright Industrial HQ" now i havent been to the Garrahan HQ yet but ive searched everywhere in Hornwright HQ (at Charlestown). You would think "signing in" is as simple as logging into reception terminal or sign in sheet, but there seems to be nothing avaliable
---
The popular areas are...that heh
---
I dunno, it's a huge map for 24 people. Makes sense one could basically avoid all contact by just avoiding a handful of high traffic areas.
---
Are you serious?! I honestly had no idea and this was my big dilemma. It just feels weird to me to buy an always online game on disc. If it's really a code in the box then I'm getting it tonight! Thank you!
---
Google it
---
https://www.playstation.com/en-nz/get-help/help-library/error-codes/ce-34878-0/
---
Isn‚Äôt that it?
---
Quest disappears after that, complete
---
Then it‚Äôs just summoning the Sheepquatch via the terminal in that hut
---
You have to literally sign in. I haven‚Äôt found it either man. Sorry.
---
Well I should have asked you that first. I'm on Xbox. Sorry I can't help. But good luck on getting some smores.
---
Ahh, thanks very much for that info!
---
you can do it from trainstations or any other stash.
---
The dolly sods daily as part of the pioneer scout quest line.. gotten bloatfly and rad roach so far
---
I'm forever your bitch
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôm just glad you saw it, for some reason my post got downvoted all to hell and I was afraid a legitimate bug would go unseen.
---
Thanks for offering
---
Have fix it good and weapon artisan both maxed.
---
Both working perfectly for me.
---
Xb1 here.
---
So basically I gotta reset my ps4 or reinstall the game. Thanks Todd.
---
I think the player vending and uptick in server crashes are definitely related
---
Thank you for the help!
---
ohhh i see what you mean now. gimme a few minutes i‚Äôll have a look at all the terminals around the HW HQ
---
i like 76 but cmon, new vegas is the gold standard for 3d fallout games
---
I loved Fallout 4 because of the NPC‚Äôs - pairing up with them could be surprisingly entertaining. But the option of coop play, the huge map, and making and exploring CAMPS in Fallout 76 is really fun. In Fallout 4 I loved building settlements, but after having the CAMP experience first, settlement building might not be very interesting.
---
and then after that you get plonked back before you did the final quest. The world doesn't change.
---
Enemies cant go thru locked doors lol that's why people do it for the most part so you can chill in your camp with out having a glowing wolf munching on your ass lol
---
It really depends on your gaming style. If you're like me and like to plan everything out then pick a build and find a build guide. But keep in mind that you can always switch your SPECIALs around after lvl 50 (swap a point instead of picking a new perk) so don't worry about spending a few points wrong.
---
Get all 3 points in Action Boy/Girl since you'll be running everywhere in the beginning.  Build a camp next to water so you'll always have an easy source of it for boiled water. If playing solo get the Lone Wanderer perk. If you're burning through healing items get the Green Thumb perk, get the red plants near the water in Flatwoods and the blue ones growing near there (and everywhere) and make healing salves at a stove/fire.  
---
A high strength and fire axe/sledgehammer build will easily get you through the first 30 levels. Using a gun you may have a bit more of a challenge since ammo will be scarce at first and they don't hit as hard unless you go sneaky sniper. Don't try to be a jack of all trades or you'll have a hard time later, while you don't have to pick something to specialize in immediately (you don't even get access to heavy weapons until 20 or 25) you do want to stick with one type of weapon mostly. 
---
The perk that increases automatic weapon damage only applies to the submachine gun (maybe a couple of others). The automatic receivers you can apply to rifles don't count, they still get buffed by the Rifleman perk.
---
The perks that increase damage or reduce enemy armor are must haves. Everything else is just whatever you want to make things easier or more convenient. 
---
If you have a mic don't be afraid to chat with people you come across or ask for help, most of the population is friendly and helpful. 
---
Are you on PC? If so I have a decent legendary 10mm that's lvl 5 I can give you to get started.
---
What lvl are you?
---
Showing up as craft-able, but will not let me craft. Wondering if I need to unlock backpack 1st. It shows up as owned in the atom shop.
---
I can‚Äôt upvote or like this post enough. It‚Äôs the most powerful day to day build. I have a heavy gunner build mixed in for that bitch queen but otherwise all stealth.
---
Just do what I did ask a friend to build your camp. Then take all the credit üòÅ
---
This is actually the type of build I was looking for! Would vats or sneak give me more damage overall or would it be about equal if I went into either one?
---
Bbq shack near top of the world
---
Got a cute Firefly one. It's so tiny
---
It's not really flipping. This is a new economy trying to reach equilibrium. It's the beauty of non-centralised system. It prevents the "trade baron" fiasco. Because nobody ever has the full picture of how many items are in the market and how they are priced. There will be dirt cheap items that are insanely priced somewhere elses. 
---
Inconvenient compared to centralised auction but much better for the game, imo.
---
Marsupial/ Jetpack ftw
---
Easiest way is go here. And server hop until asshole abrahms shows up.
---
The exact opposite, glad I'm doing it right lol
---
It‚Äôs 17.86 on Amazon right now.
---
You'll find loads of people to play with! I've made a whole new group of friends just walking around Appalachia
---
With the xbox, I had to reset the cache, which for that console involved unplugging the power supply, waiting 20 secs, plugging it back in, and restarting it. Forcing it to clear it's memory files and going from a clean restart. PS4 probably has a similar setup, so give it a shot. I know t gt e xbox us often unstable  after updates.
---
I mean, I won‚Äôt lie when I say my first house was a 2x3 log cabin thing
---
Turn it in for Scrip, but that's just my 2 caps worth.
---
I bought one from the Vendor Bot last week for like 60 caps, but I think mine is only Tier-2. It's also Furious though, so I figured I'd at least try it out. I even electrified it for an additional +17 Energy Damage....
---
Sadly, it sucks, and barely tickled the Sheepsquatch I was using it on. My non-legendary Combat Shotgun does more damage after a 10 round clip with no shotgun-related perks! *(Granted, I had no melee related perks, either, but that just makes it all the more fair of a comparison!)*
---
Hows the vendor experience in survival? planning to get into it soon
---
that's the general argument against world text chat and i agree, but through the terminal it could easily be ignored, and a block function would follow. what i mean is i'd like those new terminals to be used to create a virtual hub, there's so much more than annoying 12yo children that would make it worth it
---
At least you are honest. Take an upvote.
---
1) no, it's the exact same amount for any armor depending on whether it's 1*, 2*, or 3*. There is a different higher amount for all weapons. There is yet another higher amount for power armor pieces, but that was only datamined and is not in the game yet
---
3) Yes, but it's only multiplicative. So after you have incisor, anti-armor takes off 50% of the remaining 25%, so it removes 12.5% (leaving you with a total of 87.5% armor penetration). 
---
7) does not matter, it's all rng. And apparently you can scrap a leather leg for example and still learn mods for the chest and arms as well as legs, not sure if that's confirmed though
---
8) Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it will just give the weapon to whichever character finished the last challenge
---
9) Hunting rifles have a faster bolt cycle between shots I believe. The dragon, black powder, etc will not be affected unless they have the quad prefix, which I don't think they can have anyway
---
10) I think so, yesterday I was getting sales every 5-10 minutes but after I got maxed out from somebody buying my 3* bloodied handmade, I went a good half hour without anybody buying anything.
---
12) I think it stacks, but scorched killer by itself is pretty bad because in most cases the extra damage on top of its lowered base damage barely breaks even
---
14) really depends on the weapon, it seems like the ridiculous cap inflation from duping is finally starting to go down thanks to player vending and nerfs, so maybe 14000 caps will start being valuable soon
---
15) I wouldn't say scrip, they're still good effects. They're just no longer the god-tier broken mess they used to be
---
16) Pretty sure workshops and camps are pretty much identical in terms of what affects them
---
I received a tick one. üòÜ
---
I got the Junkies lead pipe. Don't think I'll be able to top that
---
The quest wouldn't pop for me for about 5 minutes. I just kept spamming interact and it eventually went. 
---
Dunno if I had this quest pop for me before the patch like you though.
---
Yes this is what I thought was a guarantee but I‚Äôve checked 4 different servers.  Which hill exactly?  Like the one right beside it?
---
I would have, except for the fact I came up with a name for it RIGHT before I opened the legendary scraping machine
---
I got either bloodbug or stingwing, can't remember which lol
---
It‚Äôs all good. It was an understandable misunderstanding, but afaik there is still no way for me to get the drug crossbow mod anymore.
---
As soon as you spawn turn left and go up that hill
---
I've seen some in the area outside Grafton, sorry can't remember exactly where but it seemed like a trail heading toward the direction that vault 76 is, maybe not. It was neared a train cart I believe that I saw some.
---
Helvetia near the spawn point?
---
that would be neat as well, i just think that ot's such a waste of a good opportunity, terminals could help make our story even more unique and could function as a virtual hub like the one you can find around the top of the world area. this last patch made me realize how much better this game is with the input of different players, seeing their camps, adapting to a new global economy etc.
---
It worked for me just fine
---
It's a currently-unavailable item that'll be in the Atom Shop. [It looks pretty slick, though.](https://media.trillian.im/media/?m=aW1hZ2UvanBlZyw1MTIsNTEyLHV7uqJctkBhYGeWx4vlSRy5lylpk8EIgg9s7HeavRz4)
---
There's the wavy waves logo on the wall at the back, take a picture of that.
---
No worries! Im actually almost envious that its available to you at that price, cause I bought it on pc about a month before release.
---
Malaclypse333 has solid suggestions. Best rifle you'll have early on is the hunting rifle, you don't really have any other options til 15 or 20. Lever action rifle is the best sniper gun, the handmade is the best semi-auto. They're both pretty rare to find in the field though (and the handmade uses an ammo you don't find much of) so you'll likely be rocking the combat rifle and hunting rifle for awhile.
---
Checked there too.  I think that the Fashnacht thing had them cause it was part of it but now I can‚Äôt find them anywhere there.  Damn squirrel.
---
now with the latest patch. I started to get these everyday. did not have them before (about 70hours on this game)  
---
but i got "Server is shutting down for maintenance like every time i played continuously 5 hours or more.
---
but this is way worse.. like doing quest that reset's or is encountered rarely and gone. indeed really killing the mood. (and for personnel. there are more competitive games to choose from. so you guys can't slack off.) cause I'am pretty hooked for bethesda games. and have really high expectation for TES: 6
---
did you even read the link? i'm sure that part didnt happen to you
---
May atom shine on you
---
I would like to use guns, however would it be viable to do a rifle and melee backup in the beginning until I start finding ammo? Also I am sadly playing on Xbox and not PC but I thank you for the legendary offer!
---
We failed it ... couldn‚Äôt find all the evidence
---
I need that one as well, I‚Äôll help. Where is the best place to do that one at? GT CammedPony
---
How close do I have to be? I see it but it won't show up while on the camera.
---
Sometimes when you double tap ‚ÄúE‚Äù on pc on a map location to fast travel (once to bring up the option, and once to confirm), it will simply close the map instead of actually fast traveling. This also occurs when clicking on a friend and clicking fast travel. A small bug, but mildly annoying nonetheless.
---
I can confirm that he does change dialogue if you drop something. I dropped a few pieces of random junk and he said something along the line of "now scram etc etc". Sorry i cant be more precise as i dont remember exactly what he says. Also, i picked up the loot from the bag again and he said i shouldnt have done that and became hostile.
---
i sat there for 30 min clicking on him today and yesterday as well :(
---
ok so on the fifth floor of the HW HQ, to the right when you‚Äôre coming out of the stair well, there‚Äôs a little pop up sign that says ‚Äúpioneer scouts sign in‚Äù with a paper pinned to the board
---
Same, gt is phat Dastard on for a bit longer tonight
---
Jet*
---
Yes it is worth every penny and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get it on disc very cheap. Don‚Äôt buy from PS store, get one on Amazon or visit your local shop. The whole game will download from net anyway and you‚Äôll have lot of fun times solo or in teams. Also on my old PS4 game run without problems since beta, some PS4pro users were complaining about performance, guess it has to do with better graphics on pro version? But on PS4 it‚Äôs ok, at least for me lol
---
White springs in the stream is best I read since deep enough for water count but not too make you swim
---
Supposedly, I never paid attention myself (which seems absurd), but ranged never benefitted? At least what I've been reading (sooo grain of salt).
---
Main is a stealth rifleman, would've hoped I'd notice increase in damage output via repair.
---
But they managed to get Grognaks Axe finally repairing above 100% (early era bug pretty sure, mentioned specifically in these patch notes) and now none of its working for melee or armor buffing. Just strange. Hope it's a new bug, not one corrected in the background.
---
Yeah, I just started playing last month so
---
ok then that's why it worked just fine for you ...
---
im fine with the floating bases it means i wont get stuck in the foundation when i fast travel to it.
---
Same here.  Quite the money saver.
---
I‚Äôll join your game
---
ill make sure to come on by!
---
yes the campfire tales event can reward badge tokens
---
Yeah, I just wished they made each part of the seconds a separate earnable
---
Real tiny speaker box located at the docks
---
It‚Äôs not a bust. Just fell victim to a time constraint and a bunch of unforgiving head line grabbing  you-tubers that focused on how a map four times as big as fo4 has less lore or they focused on the negative shit. 
---
I just kept playing. It‚Äôs fun. It will be here a while.
---
Idk, New vegas has way more bugs than 76, and it's graphics are ass. The story is decent.
---
Says your offline
---
nice, where did you get that know your plants poster?
---
Ahh cool.  Is it the same event with the s'mores recipe?  Campfire something...
---
WOW.  So update, found one at Service entrance, DIDN‚ÄôT count for the challenge.  Awesome.  I‚Äôm so mad.
---
I think I'm on your server, I'm at the pylon ambush site.
---
Only 400 atoms per part for utility features on the backpack!
---
93 or 94. Somewhere near there
---
Fast travel to vault 76. Crouch in the bushes, move your character 2 inches to the left every 29 minutes......
---
I can't personally help with that but during the Encryptid event lots of folks die all the time and if you stick to the puddle by the house eventually someone will need your help and that should check that box.
---
Thanks! Well have you a cold Sunset Sarsaparilla ready!
---
I know how bad it was, right now it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs cash cow. So do you think they will put in the resources that it would take for this game to reach its potential or do you think it won‚Äôt be worth the investment for a survival MMO?
---
Having more than one camp doesn't have enough benefit when compared to how often another player already has a camp down where yours might be. Imagine how much more problematic it would be if players had 2-3 camps?
---
A secondary camp could be interesting, one that gets placed at an alternate location when your main camp can't be put down.. but without increasing map size, it's already too cramped as it is.
---
Hot fix 11 am
---
It‚Äôs on the dock by the building. Make sure to grab the swimsuit of out the porta potty if you don‚Äôt already have one
---
The cave south of the pumpkin house has some in it. Took a pic of a glowing deathclaw in it last week and it listed fossils as well as the deathclaw.
---
Thank you. This is the kind of opinion I was looking for.
---
I love the Gatling Gun, big damage per shot, plus super cheap ammo.
---
The Gatling Plasma has the highest dps, but the upkeep is way higher.
---
I have a sneak rifleman build but still melee when I'm farming with my team, and I used melee a lot during my lower levels. It's definitely doable.
---
link?
---
Yeah, sadly you can't leave kudos or donate stuff into the mailbox, I really think it's a perfect chance to introduce more camp interactives, well, at least after they added the travel mats back I guess lol
---
I'll help GT aGraciousGod
---
I see, thanks for the input!
---
My gamertag is AkYetiGuy
---
I was a little back from the start of the wave pool looking down into it.
---
Plasma Gatling is the cheapest in terms if ammo economy, and deals high end damage. If not Explosive, get one with faster fire rate. 
---
You can also do a good Gatling Laser, with Power user for 1k shits per core. Faster Fire, and/or vampire!
---
Gatling Gun has cheap ammo, slow DPS but hits hard. LMG has the highest (?) DPS ans great rate of fire, but ammo cost and small clip size limit it.
---
Quad Harpoon Guns are also a favorite for the infinite ammo economy.
---
Minigun, Flamer, and Cry are okay.
---
I see you. Where you want to do this at?
---
Yep, you can find usually find a fire axe in one of the shipping containers on the north side of Morgantown airport which will pretty much one shot early enemies if you find yourself needing to conserve ammo... with the hunting rifle that usually isn't much of an issue though as long as you loot all of the ammo containers. I had a hunting rifle, 10mm backup, then fireaxe or sledgehammer when the enemies swarmed or there was a really tough guy.
---
And no problem! Many of us like to help out when it comes to fresh players. =)
---
Thanks invite sent
---
Thats awesome.
---
A community manager said that they're, "looking into it." 
---
It's unclear whether it was intentional or not.
---
Because typing would be way too simple for your consoles gamers ...
---
Only one camp could be active at once. Like swapping out a perk card. Switch to camp 2 and it loads you into a new server.
---
Its one of my favorites. That and Marsupial are clutch
---
Seems like you even tier listed it, super useful so thanks!
---
Moving the camp module doesnt work for other ppl. Only yourself. Folks always spawn where the canp was original placed which is directly in the middle of your circle.
---
I would even be willing to pay for expansion dlc's. Imagine a tunnel/ship/train that could take you to another section of a new map.
---
New areas to discover, maybe a new species and stuff. I'd pay 30 bucks easy if there was enough content.
---
i need it also 
---
Other people have agreed it worked. Its worked on all of my camps. Im not claiming to be an expert. Just attempting to help. Thanks for the downvote, have a nice night.
---
They've already said they're going to add displays. They're still working on the assignment mechanism in the game.  
---
- At first it was alcohol assigned to the fermented. Only you could interact with it and you could only have one (so only one asset with items assigned to it).   
---
- Now we've got player vending. Items are assigned to one of 4 different machines and players can interact with them, so how we've got 5 assets with assigned items. 
---
- Next they'll try more asset with items assigned, but will have to make sure those displays can't be robbed.
---
I got Bloodbug today from the Dolly Sods mission
---
Works. I got my 8-badge high capacity backpack (120 carry weight, not 100) with only 6 challenge completions. The rest came from this, with some badges to spare.
---
fyi- An automatic tesla rifle is extremely nice for this event, especially if you get the bug wave ending.
---
No confirmation, but have you tried the skeleton in the big Maw?
---
Grafton Dam inside the building in the basement worked for me last night. There a foot or two of water down there should work
---
Weapon Artisan gave so much damage increase to melee weapons, so no wonder.
---
I hardly doubt it was only applied to Mr. Handy Buzz Blade and need confirmation.
---
That‚Äôs the enclaves secret bunker for all the pre war politicians.  To gain access go to the waste disposal site east side of the map in the mire.  You will enter a cave full of deathclaws. Search thier nest for a holotape with a code. Play the code to the voice box and gain entrance to the bunker find a way past the laser wires and find a few clues to open a safe and gain an access card. Use that card on the hand scanner and gain access to the vault door entrance which then starts you on the enclaves main part of the story.
---
Haha sorry man but I must. If you just walk straight in any direction for no more than 10mins you always find some.  In 3h you can walk the whole map so many times, you will have done all challenges.
---
Yep, that it how it works
---
I'm running into this issue too on PC. Were you able to find a fix?
---
Is that a strip club? lol (only kidding)
---
well i see on twitter where they bringing it down for maintenence but that doesn't mean they are fixing our issue but i guess ill keep hope alive
---
Up in the toxic valley there's plenty. Had to jump out of the parade once to go get some. It had been nuked and the squirrels and rabbits wouldn't spawn.
---
I could have used this about an hour ago for the swimming tadpole. Gonna get it for the rest.
---
Well I didnt downvote you but I will now after that comment.
---
Your r definitely not an expert. It doesnt work.
---
Funny how Oxhorn finds lore all the time. üôÑüòâ
---
I‚Äôve never been lucky enough to own a piece of sentinel armor and yet I do fine in the SBQ fight as a bloodied melee. What usually kills me is rads because I‚Äôm not paying close enough attention. No power armor and I‚Äôve got all the defense perks. That sheepsquatch tho...
---
Okay found it, I had to switch servers because of the dumb invisible bug/glitch
---
Haven‚Äôt heard clutch in a LONG TIME lmao. I use those 2 and speed demon, though speed Demon was from a rad storm but I like it for being in a power armor. But I run melee and I‚Äôm looking for twisted muscle now
---
I live under a bridge ;-)
---
That's awesome!
---
Oh no!
---
I literally just said i wasnt an expert. I dont even know why youre salty. Again have a nice night.
---
You can downvote all my comments too. Enjoy yourself.
---
That would be a great idea though! Power up one of the plants and lights turn on in nearby stations, roads are illuminated by street lamps, and ceiling fans start to spin in local homes. That'd be adorable.
---
I've been able to milk the one at my camp, and the ones from the Sheepsquatch event (not until the event is over though). I don't get a success as often as I did pre-patch, but it has worked post-patch. I'm also on pc.
---
Bash enemies it destroys them quick
---
Right, but are their conditions for the reward? Like get 3 levels, it requires different conditions be met (be under a certain level, be naked, etc). Take a picture of 10 other players, I got 4 points taking a picture of one player because they met 4 conditions, etc.
---
Check it again and see if it has different conditions maybe?
---
I have very little defense besides what the armor and my mutations and chems give me...maximum dmg...this nerf screwed glass cannon bloodied players
---
Done
---
Thanks! :)
---
You looking for recipe or serum? I have the serum.
---
Exactly!
---
Even tapping into the power grid with your camp for semi free power.
---
Saving this for later. May atom shine on you
---
sucks that you had to switch servers but i‚Äôm glad you were able to find it!
---
garrahan HQ is in the southeast part of ash heap, near those two weird looking red buildings, just underneath the end of that railroad ^ ^
---
Each vending machine will hold 30 items. So if they have four make sure to check all four
---
I heard its in the game files but no where to be found in the game world. Dont know if Bethesda foregot to add the item to the world or if it just slipped passed QA, Anyhow Bethesda is bringing fallout 76 offline tomorrow so we will see if this gets fixed.
---
I use Speed Demon, Marsupial, Healing Factor, Electrically Charged, Grounded, Scaly Skin and Unstable Isotope.
---
Hoping for hope
---
Still need help?? GT is PoseiDONE Blue
---
My camp is south of Top of the World and squirrels always run through it.  It‚Äôs near the collapsed ski lift camp that normally has scorched or super mutants just down the hill close to the cliff side. Hope that helps.
---
Yes start over it's worth the story and I've heard the black pa clips but haven't seen it in game yet
---
I have like 3-4 awkward foundations slapped together with the essentials on top (crafting stations, cooking, and a chair, 2 turrets). That's it. It's the saddest little thing compared to all these other great ones lol.
---
Might just hold off on bothering until I can get the barn or brick sets :(
---
I'm still just not sure how useful it would be, that's all. Besides, like I suggested, an alternate camp location if your first can't be put down..
---
I'm all for building, I've built a lot and I enjoy it.. but if I had to choose between more new content and this feature, I choose content.. unless you can provide something *useful* about the idea.
---
You can repair the same one three times. Just make sure you don't have Weapon Artisan equipped and it'll be up for repair again after one or two shots. Bashing enemies degrades it faster, too.
---
Thanks!
---
My recent hustle has been selling high-end legendaries for caps and then buying serum recipes to make.
---
Serum!
---
As someone who maintains a couple specific mutations,  I find I still get some weird random ones that I don't  want just from eating stuff.
---
I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôve missed out on quite a lot? I‚Äôve just bought the black rider skin. I think it looks smart.
---
Sadly for high level like me, thats worthless for lacking any damage increasing perk.
---
It's useful as it provides me an opportunity to build and try out new ideas, which, other than creating new toons, which I have, is absent from this game without completely destroying your camp.
---
It's just a display glitch. Had the same happen with technical data.
---
Unless they've changed the spawns, there are typically 1 or 2 that spawn in/around the alley behind the kitchen/cooking area of Flatwoods.
---
Random cocktail like the sasquatch said, but to add to that, herbivore and carnivore are mutually exclusive, so if you wanted one of those, it might be worth it to buy the serum, then go for the others manually.
---
just move your camp, free and cheaper travel
---
New Atom Shop skin, probably for raider armor.
---
Iv been server hopping for over 2 hours. I‚Äôm losing my shit man lol
---
This is what I have done. Got an industrial for me and about 5 or 6 medium ones  for everyone ekse.
---
Maybe stock a single machine with your low level stuff and leave it unpowered.  Then write out using the small letter set: msg user for service.  Or something along those lines if you have budget to spare.
---
THANK YOU!
---
I would say you are not completely correct. Yes there are the lore people. Then there's the rest of us who see a game riddled with bugs that never get fixed, get fixed then reintroduced a patch or two later. This is the worst fallout ever because of these problems. And I am an avid fan who has them all. I only remain praying Bethesda will wake up.
---
I was finally able to start messing with mutations; got marsupial, carnivore, speed demon and adrenal reaction all together for under 2000 caps : ) Y‚Äôall are awesome
---
Yep. Whether raider, X01, T-Series, or school bus, they all look the same.
---
And lets hope that the rumor going around that Bethesda is going to make refrigerators an Atomic Shop exclusive is just that, a rumor and noting else. 
---
Patch 9 was a really huge up for the game and would hate it for Bethesda to pull a dick move like that.
---
Take off Fix It Good before repair, and don't use Gunsmith when firing it. Use bash often.
---
Apparently it's not a 100% reward ... it's a 50/50
---
Me too near harpers ferry. People spawn on top of my place
---
If your using a controller get a rubber band and rubber band your thumb stick so your camera is spinning. Easy afk.
---
You just basically explained how you're able to do exactly what you suggested, without any more effort from Bethesda! **Good job**. Now I know how I can test build other camps before I dedicated to moving!
---
Yeah, it may be useful to you, as in you don't have to log out.. but I don't think it offers enough to the player base that any of us would sacrifice future content, for a suggestion that's marginally beneficial in any way.
---
Beths, since we cannot see much while aiming a gatling and the ammo box acts somewhat like a shield, may as well increase the chance for the ricochet perk to proc. How about it?
---
I had mine at 2000 caps but im thinking about coming down quite a bit.
---
I had banked on the serums was going to be a quick turnaround and spent the 19K caps on the Marsupial recipe for player vending. Huge mistake, While it may take me awhile to make it back up to the 21K I was at Ill eventually get there.
---
Thanks for this I looked right over it.
---
Communism has a 0% success rate, WINNING!
---
Just inside Blackwater mine before the mole men. Either dogs, mole rats or radars spawn. May have to server hop.
---
I randomly had 2. I think I got them from the daily in toxic valley
---
Why didn‚Äôt you fast travel out, instead of picking the lock?
---
This also was how armor got double damage resistance with double durability. I immediately noticed how squishy I was after the update. However it seems fair since ranged weapons never got this benefit.
---
I just paid 150 at someone‚Äôs camp!
---
Happened y-day lol. They were like laying down gliding towards me, i laughed so hard
---
Yeah that doesn't really help tell me what it's supposed to mean though? Sorry, I'm really confused here
---
Doesnt matter. It all breaks down into junk and can be bulked to be sold. Trash to Treasures.
---
Even if I sell at 1 cap, Ill sell it.
---
The component view in the pip-boy sometimes shows 4294967295 as the quantity.  I assume it is an underflow issue with the component quantity values.
---
go to your game challenges it's under the "world" category
---
My turret count is bugged. so I have to work with 5 turrets that I am able to place.
---
Start over for sure. I hope you‚Äôre feeling better!
---
What's the difference between fascism and communism, honestly?
---
The camp was in a pretty remote spot, didn‚Äôt feel like having to make a long run back to it from the closest landmark.
---
Bulk it on how its sold in a store.
---
It's purely a visual bug. The value is simply the absolute maximum value you can have of something. Any time someone posts what the number is, it's always the exact same number.
---
Going on today too.
---
leave your character and wait for it to disconnect, when you get back go to the social tab, recent and click on the first person and click join, if the person is still at the same world you are gonna be back where you were at. it's not perfect but it's better than nothing.
---
I personally use a Minigun for closer range and a .50 Cal for longer range. The Minigun rips through things with no effort up close, especially with the shredder is attached. Both guns a decent in terms of durability. In terms of ammo they're both pretty expensive, however I don't use them as my main.. Most of the time I'm running a rifle build, and only spec into Heavy/PA for certain things.
---
good weapon pre patch but now cant over repair it to get bonus damage so probably scrip.
---
There is a quad?&gt;!!?  
---
I think I need that- what level is it? Mine does over 100 and is only a level 20 so kinda wonder how high a level they go  
---
and have you found any mods for it yet?
---
Anyone know where any lower level yao guai definitely spawn?
---
You sure you haven't been drinking NukaShine?
---
Whoa guys, Jesus riding a velociraptor has something to say.
---
Ran into an injured super mutant today. I wish I had approached him to see if there was any dialogue instead of just shooting him. I didn't get a pic but he was named "injured super mutant" and was limping away from a couple super mutant corpses that looked to have been killed by a sheepsquatch holding his arm.
---
Doesn't work
---
i do! sending a request now
---
Thank you for your confirmation! So it was a change to Weapon Artisan and Fix It Good. I guess Damage increase and DR increase we used to have through using Weapon Artisan and Fix It Good was considerd to be a bug to Bethesda.
---
If there's only 1 tile on the ground, you can blueprint and move your camp just about anywhere.
---
Is the confirmed? From my experience if you don‚Äôt receive a plan you would receive one Possum Badge.
---
I do too. I like seeing how many I can pass without fact checking. Browsing Wikipedia stoned  is turning out not to have been a complete waste of time
---
I've seen plenty of absurdly priced shit at vendors, like 1* stuff for 2500 caps, selling 3* weapons that aren't remotely good for 10K or more. Saw a 3* for 23,700... people are insane.
---
Run commie, run!
---
&gt;He kills communists
---
I'm on board.
---
Thank you. It‚Äôs now more about learning to live with it. Hopefully I can do the Evan quest now? Lol.
---
The giant teapot
---
Sorry, PC
---
Can you do any of the world challenges?
---
Nothing in this game is worth 25k caps. Anyone who is okay with it is being swindled or greedy. Since release ive seen 6 TSE 3* for less than 5k. Also basic economics teaches you the more currency available in physical for the less its value as a currency.
---
It seems Bethesda really, really, really doesn‚Äôt want you to make dinner.
---
It's just an unsigned integer underflow.  Sorry guys.  But a bit of an embarrassment for Bethesda.
---
Happens to me every day when I jump in after first loading the game up. Lasts about 5 minutes on the first load of the day, every day. Since march. 
---
Good times.
---
not at all, in fact I'm honored! :) Thanks for including it (Y)
---
You can do it the 3rd person camera mode and it won't kick you, so you don't even have to risk your character moving around and potentially wandering into something that'll kill you..
---
yes i can do those so i will be able to get 3/4 steps but it just will not trigger the kiddie corner mission
---
whoever is downvoting this maybe read the link first I am not a moron and know how the quest is supposed to work.
---
Vault 51 located in the northern
---
I meant that the possum badge isnt 100% rewarded ... ppl do it 1 time and expect to get it first try lol
---
fuck, you're right, me too. i dont get it, i have two possum badges and i have completed zero challenges? that's the only quest ive dont so far.
---
What‚Äôs grounded, scaly skin and unstable do
---
Damn it. I felt like Lara Croft when I stumbled upon it for the first time the other day.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm a Tomb Failer, instead of Tomb Raider.
---
Worked great thx
---
hah I know the blind faith-feeling. At first it was kind of exciting though! :P A little gambling almost, but then again I really hope they fix it perhaps in the upcoming maintenance today or something even though I haven't seen too many hotfixes going on myself. I'm glad to hear your gamble paid off, I'm also browsing people's shops like crazy these days, so if I see someone practicing for next year's Fasnacht-parade with their tuba I'll be sure to make a purchase :P
---
Glad it helped :)
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware the deleted duped items
---
Yes and it drives me crazy.
---
As a workaround I've been using VATS to autotarget them and then drop out of VATs right before actually pulling the trigger, so that the attack will go through.
---
Thanks, updating it right now
---
A helpful guide:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_mutations
---
I've hopped there a few times and It's only coming up level 0 for me?
---
That‚Äôs what it seems like. Either that or ranged weapons not getting the bonus was the bug and it was easier to disable the feature than to figure out why it wasn‚Äôt applying to all weapons equally.
---
There was a massive wipe a couple months ago where Bethesda went through servers and deleted loads of duped items.
---
 I've hopped there a few times and It's only coming up level 0 for me?
---
Cant find it please b more specific
---
Tbh I have a few in my stash so I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt wipe stashes
---
Sell price would be two caps each. Shoot for more than 2 to profit more.
---
yes it's killing me
---
They went for massive stacks of items. Are you admitting to duping or that you've got items you know were duped?
---
Toll roads are generally better maintained. Just saying...
---
[\[ADDED\] Challenge: Unable to find a Stimpak Diffuser for the Tadpole Medic Challenge](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language=en)
---
* **STATUS**: The Stimpak Diffuser is a Stimpak that restores health to you and your nearby teammates. The recipe for this item will be available in the next update. We're aware that this creates an issue with completing the Tadpole Challenge referencing the Stimpak Diffuser, however you may still complete other world Challenges to earn badges.
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware of the exploit at the time it was done but I was given items from people I know who were
---
More redactions than the Mueller report
---
It's still better then before IMO.
---
Get a gaming keyboard with macro. Program it to auto key press tab key every 10 mins or so and you're set to afk forever until your Internet or Beth's server crashes :)
---
Yeah parts of this are kinda not great. I don't have any friends who play this game and I tried for a while to ask people who came to my store if they'd be interested in helping me complete the revive a friend things, but I just got plain old ignored every single time (or my mic doesn't work, or they have area chat turned off. All three are possible) and that just makes it incredibly difficult to actually find a way to complete this. :/
---
Honestly, if you can remember who you got it from, I'd report them and get rid of the items. You didn't do it, for sure, but my philosophy is by knowingly benefitting from it, you're complicit.
---
Lesson learned.
---
The real answer is nothing in this game is worth caps, not once you've hit that limit and stayed at it. The armor I want has mostly only been available for trades, some was max caps..
---
The bottom line is, unless you've got something special, caps is fine. But caps aren't enough when you've truly got something special.
---
I've got a couple of god roll items that I would never sell for caps. And I know I'm not the only one. 3* tse aren't special. There's plenty that is, that you will never have access to with your mentality.
---
yep. Pretty sure BGS wanted this to be datamined and found.
---
Yeah got killed by this issue, it was pretty annoying.
---
They should've included it in the latest Patch Note. Thanks again for clarifying the change.
---
What platform? I'll pay 2-3 caps apiece
---
Well locking the door forces them to pick it which alerts the owner. At least that‚Äôs how it used to work, not sure now.
---
May have been in my mind, but bashing seemed to damage it faster.
---
I usually empty out anyone I find selling it for 50 or less, stash space be damned.
---
I almost got murdered by some punk ass stingwings in the Forest because of this, so yeah.
---
Finished the tests, not the quests
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for the most part. I‚Äôm almost there.
---
My camp is protected by a behemoth. It's pretty sweet. From whitespring, go southeast. Up the rock wall, up the hill, through the woods, and there's a pond with a bunch of radioactive waste drums. In the middle of the pond there's a behemoth. I call him Dave. He protects my stuff.
---
I still can't get pass the 0/3 world scout challenges .-.
---
No shot, as do I, the Crab Van is my bridge
---
Actually what you described is socialist
---
Which is fine unless I want to set something for 500.
---
You can go both stealth and VATS easily. The person up there seems to know his stuff, but not sure why he thinks it's one or the other. You're getting your stealth from Agility and VATS from Perception and Luck. Plenty of room to do both.
---
This is exactly why I have ten. I don't have to come back to my camp to empty them all the time.
---
Maybe, you need to play till you get the well tuned symbol? No idea, just guessing.
---
So finally managed to get the Dross Toss to spawn - after completing it, it doesnt show in the terminal
---
While the game is fun, I don't see it having a major turnaround until Bethesda makes adjustments to the game's economy.
---
2nd to last word is "experimental"
---
&gt;They would certainly be better but I‚Äôm convinced people would still shit on this game. 
---
I'm someone who just started playing the game yesterday. I stopped playing FO4 because I was disappointed, but otherwise am a fan. 
---
I still would have shit on it. FO76 is not the RPG type game I really like, and want from Fallout. It has lots of flaws. As a 60 dollar purchase, with microtransactions, I feel it's lacking. And it was over hyped prior to launch. 
---
But I'm having fun. My partner and I have played a lot together in the past two days. I'm sure it was worse with bugs and things before, but with lowered expectations, and the knowledge that this isn't a Fallout story RPG like 1, 2 or New Vegas, were enjoying it for what it is, and encouraging friends to play with us.
---
Hell, perhaps something on that new terminal that averages prices across the servers.  
---
Similar to how the auction house in WoW works.
---
Actually, you don't need to break it totally. You can repair it around %90 durability. I just used my crossbow for 50 kills and repaired it when I found any workbench. Also if you want to break it faster, you can use Ballistic Bock.
---
I had the same thought, no luck. Its persisted across servers and game sessions.
---
You mean the Plasma flamer mod?  If so, beware. It's range is stupid short. Like, standing at the kitchen in the golf club not able to kill the ghoul on the other side of the room short. Damage is good up close though.
---
Maybe the community can figure out a way to identify "friendly" camps that aren't actually vendors via the vendor machine. Say, if a camp has exactly 76 pieces of junk for sale then it's signaling to others to come visit, rest, etc but don't expect trade.
---
I dunno, sometimes we have to come up with our own solutions.
---
Oh I know. But what is ballistic bock?
---
Not disagreeing  at all
---
Oh I know. Still taking me forever. But what is ballistic bock?
---
I usually drop a landmine on their front step when I see this. Not enough to do much, but gets the point across, I think.
---
Just FYI, the brick building walls with the large window could be jumped through. Pretty sure this has yet to be patched.
---
I have noticed this three times now. The first time I thought I did something wrong, then thought maybe there‚Äôs a pattern forming. Nice to see some confirmation. I always click to fast travel (didn‚Äôt even know you could use E honestly) so it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter how you do it, just that you do it. 
---
Since they introduced the new mechanic that, if enemies are nearby, it kicks you out of the map with a fast travel countdown, I wonder if this is related to that. 
---
Actually come to think of it I noticed this happening after the countdown once. It got to zero and then didn‚Äôt move me. I assumed I had gotten hit and just didn‚Äôt notice it and couldn‚Äôt see the enemy but thinking back I bet it was this same issue.
---
Only extended mag blocks the site. Not a critical mod imo. I understand your frustration, but drop the mod and you will be better off.
---
I spent about 45 minutes just powering through the exams. Hunting really took me a while.
---
I didn't even realize what it was until I saw this thread. I just took over a power plant to get some fusion cores, and then I suddenly had this new 3* legendary gatling gun O_O
---
So it does work, it looks like.
---
The stimpack diffuser has been confirmed by a community manager that it currently does not exist ingame and is something they're planning on implementing next week.
---
&gt;	forget
---
Nah, I just don‚Äôt care that much. It‚Äôs almost always full when I get back, and when it‚Äôs not I‚Äôm just glad someone got some use out of it.
---
I've started to think that myself. However I have passed seven of them and but I have nowhere to go from there. The upper right corner of my screen shows me what needs to be completed but nothing shows up on my map and no instructions. I guess it'll be awhile before I get that backpack. üò≠
---
Check the world challenges
---
thanks!
---
‚ÄúHe called the shit poop!‚Äù
---
yes, a donation box would be great to encourage cool looking CAMP builds
---
What if this was interactive and the devs would unlock the vault when we find out what all of this message says
---
I think it‚Äôs a component drop off the moth man
---
My camp, constantly ruining my mutfruit.
---
Oh do you use Gunsmith perk? And Ballistic Bock is beer that grants you %15 ballistic damage and %15 more condition loss.
---
yes but you can only get that while at your base, if you‚Äôre out doing stuff and need food what good is it if it‚Äôs away from you
---
Yeah that's weird, with 3 points in hard bargain they're always at 3800 for me
---
I took gunsmith perk off üëçüèª
---
Nothing there. I was wondering if that would be it. I guess the ground swallowed it up.
---
I can confirm the archeology one is completeable. Finished it today.
---
I just found it earlier. It's unmarked on the map, but in the top left somewhere in between WV Lumber and The Crosshair. It's easier to find if you start from VW.
---
I'm buying it!!
---
with pistol handle and full auto guerilla in agility
---
with pistol and single gunslinger in agility 
---
with rifle stock full auto commando in perception 
---
with riflestock single shot rifleman in perception 
---
batteries included will reduce the ammo weight in intelligence

you can build experiment and get a road map here   [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I passed 7 of the computer test but it doesn't look like I have anywhere to go from there. The upper right hand corner of my screen tells me what needs to be done but nothing lights up on the map and there are no instructions. Any suggestions I'd be very thankful for.
---
It is, found one a few days ago. I dont think it auto scraps either.
---
I fucking hate tasks in any game that require stupid this GS like that. Anthem had a task that required reviving 4 people. It was bullshit.
---
This is coming in nuclear winter, as one of the N.W. intro holotapes is found on the corpse of 51's overseer. I do think they wanted us to find this message though.
---
Same.  I'm going to move my camp and redo it.  I just need to find an area near a body of water and enough space for my crops.
---
It must be similar to how Top of the World didn't trigger until I had the sign from the Crag included in it; we just have to find the right angle.
---
I asked it because sometimes it can be missed. So if you are playing at Pc, I can craft you Ballistic Bock.
---
I have found that the easiest way to do it is to get the HP as low as you can and just use the weapon bash on it. Works for the other ones too, like using a black powder weapon on a radstag. No need to craft any ammo.
---
Once you complete the exam and pass it look at your world challenges and page down to the tadpole challenges . Find the badge you want and click on it. It will show you the tasks you have to complete to get the badge.
---
Good question. I seem to be having the same problem.
---
that was it but it was a fairly small area... under trees... wild
---
I have that as well, but wasn't enough for this wall.
---
Nah, PS4. Thank you very much for the offer though!
---
You are forgetting that players like myself who have reached 25k drop our travel agent perk and our buy/sell perks to use up caps so we can sell. Without giving stuff away. Now with player vending we have a new problem.
---
There‚Äôs a chance you can inspect from vendors and vending machine completely random though
---
I had a nice camp by the air purifier east of the Rusty Pick, right until the day a scorchbeast spawned there and obliterated it.
---
I passed 7 of these tests so far is that adequate to page down?
---
ToTW gave it to me from the spawn-in point lol. the bridge is underneath but it isn‚Äôt entirely obvious where is the accepted zone
---
I like to put the small signs of ‚Äúammo, guns, plans, food , chems‚Äù to help people know what‚Äôs in what, I hope they read lol
---
There are only two magazines. It's not like it was something difficult to test. It blocks the very center of the crosshairs.

Response back from Support, quicker than I thought.  Beth says they cannot and will not replace items lost like this.  :(  bummer.  Not even an ATOM consolation prize.
---
Well I think you can complete both objectives at the same time by reviving a person in water
---
I completely forgot that they were a thing but now I remember I had a giant one round the back of the workshop house in sanctuary.
---
Hit start menu then LB for menu . Click challenges . Then click on world challenges . Page down to the bottom of the challenges and you will see tadpole badge challenges . Each one has multiple  tasks you have to complete .
---
I lock two and leave two other open. I'm greedy but like sharing.
---
And where will you keep all this high value stuff? Eventually you'll fill your stash. Then what's the price going to be.
---
I just lost a 50 cal Bloodied by doing pretty much the same thing.. bringing the weapon up and fast traveling.. when I got to my destination I was empty handed.. sort of suxs..
---
Oh okey then, good luck.^^
---
Okay great I'll give it a try. üòÄ
---
ah plasma thrower not just plasma gun. flame thrower is heavy weapons, ...hmm that's a more complicated question than I thought. id say do some science in game with that get 1 perk of each and examine the damage output. it would take at least three levels to get one of each tree but that would be the only way i could figure it out.
---
I put up 4 &amp; as I'm trying to sell a few legendary items I put up a sign to message me if you want to inspect it. If your at your base buyers can inspect the equipment.
---
The location stuff didn't work for me either.  And I think some other people mentioned trouble with it as well. I think it may be bugged.
---
Ps4 unfortunately
---
That was fast. Like pulling a bandaid.
---
Yeah Same for me swimming took way too long
---
Darn, have to swing back for these after the inevitable hot fix
---
It‚Äôs not random.  It seems to be whether the owner is in the CAMP area.
---
Thanks! This helps a lot. Still haven‚Äôt found it tho
---
Bought a T-45 Jet Pack plan from a player vendor for 100 caps, went to my base and sold it in my vending machine for 750. Happened within about 15 minutes.  Gotta love capitalism.
---
I just got mine today. It was surprisingly not really all that hard. Just time consuming. A lot of that stuff you can look at the challenges themselves and pick the easier ones to do. There‚Äôs several steps but I think the knowledge exam is the hardest part.
---
Did this for like 30 minutes called it quits haha
---
If the ratio at which I get armor over weapons follows to the legendary vendor.... I am expecting disappointment.
---
Which skills are you interested in doing? In order to see what has to be done you have to go into the challenges section of the menu and go to World. Then scroll down to see the objectives.
---
Well looks like I'm holding on to my atoms until this drops. :)
---
Athlete , archer and swimmer are not to hard to accomplish. The medic one can‚Äôt be completed currently and the cooking one is tough. You only have to complete 3 if the badges to get your back pack . Then you are ranked up to possum . Once at possum you can get possum badges to get mods for your backpack
---
Good stuff. Thank you for your time
---
I sent you a message
---
And tarberries. Also, great damned reference.
---
Hey, would you happen to be PS4? I need just a few of each flux to craft the decontamination shower in my camp. (Still levelling so I don't get much of the non-flux materials).
---
Before food expired so fast, I exclusively ate Glowing Meat Steak and hot keyed it.
---
Sad days.
---
Pardon the hijack, but how are crossbows in the game as a whole?
---
I dout they read haha. I've got a coded door into my house. I have the code right next to the key pad. But I still see people trying to jet pack to my upper floors to get in. Had to move my vending machines outside just in case
---
I had one at the coffee shack where Murgle is, and moved it to the Mire by Dolly Sods right before this update hit because I wanted to be close to some of the Pioneer Scouts stuff.
---
I had a camp there about 100 lvls ago. With the amount of traffic down there looking for power cores it might make a good store site. Not much competition.
---
Ouch!  Yea.
---
The Plasma Gatling is effected by both of those perks.
---
I did a little digging. They are actually challenges in the menu. They are marked with scout badges instead of atoms as rewards
---
Programming is always an interesting topic. Endless possibilities and different routes you can go to make an imagination into semi reality.
---
In prison. 0, 1 and 3 lvl.
---
Thank you very much.
---
I got a small series of shanties near Atlas. Looks live the real life WV, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Event that happens at night at Camp Adam's, it's a possible reward.
---
Gatling gun sight is visually blocked by large magizine mod.
---
Gatling gun sight is now obviously meant for a different type of firearm and does not work well for the gun it is. It would fit the mini gun better. The gatling gun shots slower well placed shots, but the sight is large and covers a large area, as if to show the area where rounds will land. The sight can hardly be seen through, so you only get a general area instead of precise cross hairs to match the accuracy. Also, when aiming down the sights with headlamp on, the sight lights up and makes viewing beyond it very difficult.
---
Not sure if that second part would be included in bugs, but the first one def is. I've resorted to removing the sights all together now just for ease of use. I'm a long time gatling gun user, and was excited for update, but now I'd rather just have it back the way it was.
---
Ahh. Ok well sucks for me lol
---
thank you
---
iirc the terminal upstairs at Camp McClintock is level 0
---
If you get a good stealth build they are pretty nasty. Just shooting them however sucks balls since there are no perks that increase their dmg
---
Awesome thanks
---
Lol, I haven't played for 3 months. My stash is full of crappy legendaries from the other day, which I'll sell for script. If I come back to the game. My price will likely be, I won't sell until the developers figure out a better system.
---
Basically, my best stuff will sit on my account until something happens to give be a reason to trade.. or play the game. I'm not back yet. We will see.
---
I thought they implemented crossbows into rifleman finally?
---
Idk if it should be a bug. It would make sense for armor and weapons that are over repaired to have increased dfn/dmg since they deal with physical forces, an extra sharp blade dose more dmg extra thick armor protects more. Ranged weapons do not do dmg, instead their bullets do.
---
In your heeee ead, in your he ea ead!

The penitentiary has a shit ton of those weights in the yard
---
Wavy waves is a dried wave pool. When looking at the slide its to the right
---
I know it‚Äôs a day old but could you help me with the Entomologist badge on the new dlc I just need the Mothman wing and I have no idea where to find it.
---
This is correct.
---
Deep Pocketed mod doesn‚Äôt change the appearance.  I have used them for leather and combat armor for 4+ months
---
Are you sure you aren‚Äôt comparing heavy/sturdy/light?
---
combat armor dense torso plan is the rarest
---
Kill. Loot. Return.
---
üëçüèºüëçüèº
---
Is it "prototype variant"? ü§î
---
yea it was mentioned in another thread and bethesda responded saying they forgot to mention it in the patch notes
---
You ain't wrong my man. Just presenting a work around.
---
I haven't gotten it yet either. I've done it a few times now.
---
I actually do the opposite and put a little bit of everything in each. This is beneficial for a lot of reasons. 
---
1. People who only check one will still see a portion of what I have to offer rather than checking one seeing ammo and going on I don‚Äôt want this and moving on. 
---
2. Let‚Äôs multiple people browse what they want all at the same time and kind of rotate around my machines so no one is standing around waiting too long. 
---
3. Each one of mine has serums and those are what I really want to sell. I prove everything slightly high but my serums really cheap. Almost always resulting in a sale
---
4. It keeps people at my camp longer having to check multiple machines with a diverse inventory. This will  attract more people to my camp. Seeing my camp full of players and having a lot of items for sale encourages them to stop by and have a look even if they weren‚Äôt interested in browsing my wares prior
---
5. If a player was interest in junk and I only had one machine labeled junk and it had all my junk they would just buy what they wanted. If I put a little junk in each then they might see something else they want besides junk that they might have not bothered to look at before.  
---
I‚Äôve made close to 25k caps already from serums a few plans and weapons and some crafted items. So as long as this keeps working each machine will have a variety of items.
---
Was that in patch notes !!???
---
yep it looks like it
---
This literally needs to happen, if you think pa is op then you haven‚Äôt been playing long at all. A full set of sentinel easily outclasses pa in every aspect. You can‚Äôt use stealth it‚Äôs in pa either so all you have to do to kill someone in pa is invest in anti armor and sneak damage and you literally rip through it like paper..Plus the fact that it requires fusion cores and the armor penetration just scales the higher your damage resist is just shows that pa isn‚Äôt even close to op. If you really think it‚Äôs that bad just have a couple of set legendary perks that are different than the rest like in fallout 4. Having pa that just helps with AP regen is not op and would definitely be a welcome addition.
---
Sadly I read it on the inter webs, so it may not be true
---
Lucky Hole Mine both at entrance and inside.
---
I found a lvl 400+ with a ton of serums for 200... flipped em and they've been flying off the shelf at 375.
---
The hustle is real.
---
Same here. One foundation is easier to place than six or eight. My brother uses two foundations for his stairs and walls them in so it's not floating.
---
What is a tadpole exam? Haven‚Äôt played in months.
---
I have 1 charisma and I‚Äôve had to use my alt to store caps before.
---
Thx
---
Totally makes sense and agreed. I think I'll make another post for more visibility. If it is unintented, it needs to be fixed.
---
I haven't had a single sentinel or cav piece as a bloodied build and I've been mostly just fine. I never bothered with dodgy. I just use evasive, serendipity, and the other agility perk that gives you damage resistance while sprinting. 
---
I never even thought to use those armors as i always felt it didn't quite fit the build until just recently.
---
Plz someone let me know where the sign in is at garrahan. I‚Äôve literally searched for one hour. Still clueless.
---
Next time the /s is your friend lol
---
Apparently Gulpers can have this in their loot.
---
Or if they have 0.... The machine can still be powered up with nothing it it
---
&gt;t*iai*l*m
---
Animality, Primality?
---
I completed it at deathclaw island. It was an easy spot to do it
---
About 3 spawn on the SW corner of Sutton, in a building w a Jeep out front
---
Archer, Swimmer and Athlete are the easiest three. Try those!
---
On PS4 you can play normal games in the VR helmet... It's not in "VR", but projected on a huge screen, like playing on a giant TV.
---
Next to the front door at Abby's bunker
---
weird thing is that is say it completed under  the order of the tadpole after my game crash, but i still can't complete it.
---
What's your base Charisma? The perk share is based of this integer, however there is a small glitch which allows you to share a perk if you happen to buff your charisma higher than normal if you don't exit the perk select screen. This method allows you to help a teammate use a perk you share temporarily until you exit the menu fully. The game will then unshare the perk after you exit the menu because your base charisma is not 9 for a rank 3 card.
---
Hope this makes sense. I had difficulty understanding this until somebody else explained it to me recently.
---
Besides rad zones and protocols, not really.
---
Just have a friend jump off a bridge into shallow water then switch. I just finished it a few mins ago
---
Cant help but feel that the last 3 is another name for the FEV.
---
 I must clear!
---
It buffs 100 lbs. If you log on a server in your power armor. You keep the 100 until you exit the power armor. Then you get normal carry weight. My excavator does 425 with perks and calibrated shocks 525 with bug.
---
I can help you for that, just bring me some grenades please. IGN:emreyigit93
---
Now the other Vaults need to open and the NPC‚Äôs can all flood in.
---
I cant milk a single brahmin anywhere in the freakin game. Pissing me right off, want my god damn badge
---
You have to be lucky enough to run into a hostile Mothman and kill it. I tried with another redditor on this post by giving him mine and it does not work. Sorry!
---
Which platform are you on?
---
Try chief in the dtore at white springs
---
Had a level 1 mongel destroy my fusion generator bc he was lagged into my foundation and couldnt find him lol
---
They recently stated they intend on locking characters to the playing mode you start them on in the future as to bring balance. They have not been clear about when they will make this update but they said that it will happen.
---
I also thank you, because I just got one that I'm gonna start using and was wondering the same thing.
---
Patch notes give all the details. Not a bug. If you crouch and show detected it'll mean there is an enemy close enough to attack, maybe manoeuvre to a point where detected changes to danger and it might work then.
---
And thank you for that information. Iv been playing since beta alone,just kept to myself and played when I got off work for a few hours. About 100 hrs in lvl 81 and I found out about mutations probably 2 weeks ago from reddit. Don‚Äôt know how the hell I missed that. I know have the appropriate perks I need and the mutations I need. So thank you
---
What area of the map you thinking?  Also, are small purifiers (the ones with their own foundation) an option?
---
I found a couple partially damaged ones at Middle Mountain Cabins
---
also there are frequently honeybeasts or radscorpions there
---
Yeah guest books are a good idea, I've seen several people ask for them.  I'd definitely enjoy leaving a small message.  We could have it as part of those personal terminals.
---
The one thing I notice about people visiting my Camp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWUotVXQAQc
---
I'm a long time user of gatling gun, so I'm def chiming in on this topic.
---
Tbh, I liked it before the fix.
---
The magizine blocking the sight sucks, but not too big an issue, as I prefer the smaller mag anyways. More durability and 500 rounds is overkill anyways. I'm more annoying in the obvious lack of play testing this fix got. This is a stupidly obvious thing that should've been noticed right away had they even checked. It's obvious they didn't check it beyond the reg mag. There are only a handful of mod options for this weapon, it would've taken less than two minutes to try them all and make sure it worked. That obviously didn't happen, but it's kind of what I expect these days. Again, not game breaking, but kinda shitty that it didn't rate a play test.
---
My big issue is that now that the sights work as intended, it's obvious that this sight doesn't fit this kind of weapon. This sight is meant for a gun like the mini gun, where you spray a group of rounds. It's large and isn't too see through, so you can see the general area where most of your rounds will land. Seems good, except the gatling gun doesn't shoot like that. It shoots slower, more precise rounds. The sight is too large, you need to be able to see past it to see where you're aiming.
---
An easy fix would be to either add a second sight option, or adjust the one already in game. It should be a more precise aiming sight.
---
I was so used to how I learned to aim before. You use the shrinking and expanding hip fire cross hairs to pin point where you shoot. I got so good at it that I can almost snipe with it. The gatling gun has some amazing accuracy. If you aim and un aim (for lack of a better discription) several times, the hip fire cross hairs will shrink to a pinpoint and expand back to normal. If you play with this mechanic, you can get very good with the aim. Like I said, you can pretty much snipe with it once you get it down.
---
Using the now working sight as intended, makes aiming painful. It's even worse if you have your flashlight or headlamp on, as the large size of the sight catches the light and it'll glow in your face, making it very difficult to see past to aim.
---
In the end, I just removed the sights all together. I love that it finally got the attention and was fixed. I wouldn't say it broke the gatling gun, but it is now more difficult to use correctly. I hope the type of sight is Cha ged to match the type of weapon it actually is.
---
Found [it](https://i.imgur.com/UmwOwef.png)

Okkkkk tho... seriously... how fkn durable are these damn crossbows lol

They have number pads for entering code numbers, why can‚Äôt they use those?

I think the last one is Morality.

Does anyone yet know if CHR affects the chance at badge rewards through this event?
---
I was hidden.
---
The bathrooms at the back are lit now.
---
You can basically make one using foundations and walls.
---
Lol. That's a first. Never heard that one. I have had a lot of items disappearing in the game but never my camp.
---
Yesterday I dropped one nuke at Whitesprings. After that I was four times disconnected. Yes, indeed. It feels like an online game. 
---
Btw. Nice try Bethesda.
---
I don't see any way that can work out.  It would be like a hungry mouse trying to get the cheese off the mouse trap.
---
Do you know or have the stats for the other mods?
---
Reminds of Der Riese
---
You can find tarberry in the sundew grove (upper left one in cranberry bog) It‚Äôs floating around on the water
---
After you do both dailies it makes you do, you have to earn badges. Earning badges helps finish the quest. You need to do 3 of the ones available. Then get a friend to help wit revive an ally. This completes the quest and gives u the plans to craft up to level 50 backpacks with +60 carry weight. 
---
Now to work on possum challenges. I want the mod for increased carry capacity!
---
Buy my pair of calibrated x-01 legs.
---
I have 6 different mutations. You have to use starched genes perk to keep them,  It also keeps you from getting new ones from anything else other than a serum. I think you are confusing mutations with diseases.
---
Thank you fellow vault dweller!
---
Completely untrue, this based on your own limited view of the market
---
Yes this was already stated on my other post.
---
I used repair kits I got from the queen. You can repair with them without even wearing it down and it counts.
---
With furious, I bet that actually powers up to max super fast. Might actually be worth using
---
Very happy to hear Plans sell like hotcakes... Because good lord, I've been hoarding them for over a month and have about 100 to sell... *(And before you downvote me, do know that I* ***give away*** *lots of plans, too!! I even gave a Gauss plan away to a fellow* /r/fo76 *poster a couple weeks back, even though he was asking if someone could sell him one for 500 caps since he was broke.)*
---
Can't wait till tomorrow when my update will be finished so I can finally setup my shops! *(damn monthly bandwidth limits; resets on the 9th)*
---
The patch notes stated that happens the extra weight one is the only one with no downside
---
Sold all of my sentinel 3 star armors pretty fast.  On a side note, would be nice if we were able to see our sell history on the personal terminal.
---
goosfrabaaaa
---
F
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy high for a serum!  200-500 are what I usually see them selling for
---
+1 üëçüèª maybe my favorite game ever
---
Yeah I robbed myself of the faschnat items.  Sold them cheap when I shouldn't have.
---
The key to creativity is copying everyone elses designs and making something else out of it.
---
I‚Äôve never had a problem inspecting items on Xbox. Spent close to 25k last night buying from player vendors. Not one problem
---
I always fix up turrets and stuff at other players camps. Just seems like the decent thing to do and it doesnt usually involve any rare materials.
---
I run a TSE Prime Gatling so I really like the big magazine on it since it is primarily for the SBQ fights. I like the zoom from actually aiming. I am used to aiming with no sights and like you said, type of sight doesn't match the weapon. I will probably remove the sight as well. Seems pretty lazy to not test something so easy to test.
---
I sell alot of chems. Mostly Bufftats and mentats. I also sell quite a bit of standard boozes. 
---
Junk and ammo(including fusion cores) have been my most consistent seller.
---
Can't stock enough shotgun ammo
---
no. it is automatic.
---
Ugh. I just finished. Which is great, but I wish I would have known that seventeen years ago when I embarked upon this quest. I‚Äôve missed out on so much. Nothing to do but move on now though.
---
I've done it 3 times so far and not a single plan or Possum badge yet.
---
You can leave everything in your stash while you craft, no need to have it on your person
---
Ive had to resort to finding a prefix on a 3 star i like and keeping my fingers crossed ab the rest of the stats. It really sucks bc not many people wanna chance thousands of caps for something that might be what they're looking for lol definitely needs to come with the next update
---
I was getting a [Cake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cno20onK9dY) vibe. The Distance.
---
The armor plating give 91 Damage resistance, or plus 90, but cuts the carry weight down to 30. Worth it for me.
---
Definitely premium junk like ballistic fiber and plastic. Mods sell good, plans and ammo. On the trading forums people won't buy ammo unless you're offering a  2-1 ratio, but in the vending machines people are more than happy with a 1-1 ratio. Hell, I was at max caps when player vending started and I spent half of my caps ammo... It's utterly worth it just to not have to go farming to make more bullets.
---
How much did you sell your berets for?
---
Is the last word Tribalism?
---
The large mag for sbq, very true. I've just been using the small mag on this new character so it feels more fun to reload after mowing down a horde of low lvl scorch. I'm glad to see other gatling users
---
There might be a disco/rave floor somewhere in the game and somehow the texture is showing up here. Light boxes also look a lot like this and are using the same colors.
---
believe me I want to try to remain calm and hope this gets patched ..but it seems only a few people have had this exact issue and I'm worried about it I really don't want my main character to be broken with that much time invested
---
Well shit, no wonder I'm constantly over my weight limit even with all my perk cards.
---
Did they ever?
---
Thanks.
---
Oh and the reloading hand doesn't match when reloading the large mag either.
---
I've been playing since launch and started thinking about making a new character this week.
---
Go for it. Take your time and explore. Now you can get good legendaries at low level from player vendors and kick ass the whole way through.
---
I tried that with both a dead yao guai and a wolf but it didn't work for me :(
---
I scrapped one last night not realizing I could use it lol. Story of my life
---
It was an observation not necessarily a complaint
---
thanks i wasnt lucky there i also have like 500 hours or so but only have the robot legs and cant remember where i got them
---
Oh yeah. That area is my jam.
---
I just tried with a dead yao guai and a dead radroach, both worked :(
---
What do you get for doing the exams?
---
Where do you even craft these..
---
Me too. Replaced my BOS paint job and that's saying something.
---
yes they did.   it was nice.   I miss it.
---
Top job! Thank you!!
---
If what I have isn't worth anything, it simply won't be sold. I don't overestimate anything.. it's either worth something, or not.
---
I think you have to finish the tadpole challenges first. Other than that I have no clue. These things are time consuming
---
\+KARMA
---
I have two industrial water purifiers, I lock one and leave the other one so my customers can enjoy the fresh water :p
---
But so does EVERYONE else, so no one would buy.
---
Yeah, I did it a few times to confirm. It's a bit annoying, but it's better than the had to store your PA in the stash, along with your Unyielding armor, unequip your perks and log out and log back in like that one time. Lol
---
Cool, thanks
---
i agree, i regularly take pics of dead animals/robots and they tally.
---
I like the terminal idea. I hope they do more with it in the future
---
Tadpole vending machine I believe.
---
Could you help me get this as well? Having a hard time finding someone to revive
---
big thanks there im gonna try that out today i actually searched online but never read anything about that spawn
---
The leak of a Mutation, and
---
Forced evolutionary Virus
---
Another thread said it was done on purpose. Same happened to armor. üòü
---
what console
---
It took a full two weeks after this post until I was able to milk my moo moo again :( then I accidentally destroyed my fertilizer and lost her. I don't have the plans as a team mate built her for me. I did manage to milk Graham brahmin
---
that sucks.   It made my mr. handy blade just that much better.
---
U am addicted to the badge challenge. They are so tough and take forever but like you said, they give purpose to exploration and that makes this game perfect for me. 
---
It has also given me a reason to make alcohol. As a commando, I‚Äôve never used it and never had a reason to make it. I had the brewers and whatnot, but why bother? And I usually had enough food without having to mess with my farm, but I had it too for immersion. But now I keep my vending stocked with whiskey! 10c each. Might lower that to 7 if I can get a little more grain and corn planted.
---
Can you say Repair Kits?
---
My 200% fixed buzz blade does a half or even less damage it used to since the patch. I got another confirmation that DR bonus is gone from armors fixed with Fix It Good.
---
try closing and restarting your game
---
Same for my dagger. It's still pretty sweet though. ‚ò∫
---
Go to your world challenges. There are tadpole challenges you need to complete. You will need to do at least three of them.
---
Yeah, good point. They almost had to do it. Damn repair kits...
---
PC
---
have you fast traveled/logged in and out? I hope it's not the case but this could mean it's gone.
---
yep
---
Long time gatling gun user here. Uses same insanely cheap ammo as the mini gun, but it shoots slower. Thus, each shot does way more damage. When spe Ed correctly, a non modded lvl 50 gatling can do over 100 per round. It fires slow enough to land each shot on target. Repair cost is fairly cheap, but does break often if not prepared. I ended up carrying two gatling guns on my main, both with different legendary perks. With the band perk, ammo is weightless. I would often run around with 30k+ rounds. A high damage gatling gun with furious perk with a force to be reckoned with.
---
Add me bro DrSzyslak
---
It‚Äôs too easy to farm. Anything more than 1cap a piece is a waist. Just my opinion.
---
I think I'm going to put on my nicest suit, role play a Jehovah's Witness, and fast travel from camp to camp asking people if they want a copy of The Watchtower.
---
Good to know!
---
Less than 500 isn‚Äôt a loss if you can consistently max out your vendor limit. It‚Äôs only a loss if you sell them to players *instead* of vendor bots. If you‚Äôre doing both, then it‚Äôs all profit. 
---
That being said, even 500 is a pretty good deal for someone who just wants to complete their build.
---
Wow that is pretty savage.
---
That's fair in my opinion. That's a pretty good size of carry weight
---
Well it's a good thing it wasn't a dlc then I guess
---
Well it‚Äôs still in my inventory so it‚Äôs not lost but the problem is it won‚Äôt leave my inventory XP
---
Pull any weight reduction perks or armor off and see if you really have room. I say this because I've run into the same problem and that was the issue.
---
Yeah VATS with mele is super bugged.
---
I think the first redacted word is Overseer.
---
I did the same but you have to start somewhere
---
there's one that spawns on the ledge behind Big Bubba's BBQ shack. look over the edge and you will see a rock sticking up. he perches on there sometimes.
---
From one EagleScout to another, I totally get you on the tedious comment. Nothing like recording your every exercise for months for physical fitness! Or just, you know all the Citizenship badges lol.
---
If you entered in the main entrance, go forward towards the CEO office on main floor, you'll see a reception desk to the right of his door, then youll notice another room to the right which looks kinda like a meeting/discussion room. In the back of that room is the sign in sheet. 
---
You may need to server switch if the board is invisible like what happened to me at Hornwright
---
Are you using the Scattershot perk?

The weight reduction only applies to shotguns in your inventory.
---
"If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of [Behemoths]."
---
&gt; stem pack diffuser 
---
Do we know that for sure? Maybe it‚Äôs a rare plan that hasn‚Äôt been widespread enough for the community to be aware? Genuine discussion, I don‚Äôt know.
---
I understand but that is the price the vendorbots give you
---
Sorry is that an additional 60 on top of the 60 a standard lvl 50 backpack gives? So 120 in total??
---
Yep that was it, turns out the gun is 13.80 and not 1.8
---
Thank you, and I love you.
---
You can now buy all those plans at grafton Station for like 100c each...
---
If you want to really sell it then you should sell it for less than the bots will sell it or else they can just buy it from the bots and then resell their stash.
---
Some people think the mothman challenge rewards the mothman mount. Still needs confirmation
---
It was intentional.
---
Thanks! I'll have to give it a look
---
I suspect it will last until they overhaul the trade system and incorporate and internal trade log of some kind. They can't tell the difference between a duper and a trader without one.
---
It‚Äôs a part of how to get a backpack which will add carry weight and different mods like food refrigeration or more ammo space and other things!
---
What mothman challenge?
---
I think people will rebel and stand outside those shops with protest signs?
---
It‚Äôs a part a quest and how to get a backpack which will add carry weight and different mods like food refrigeration or more ammo space and other things!
---
Then they should've included it in the Patch Note.
---
Ahhh so if I did them all already and haven‚Äôt gotten that far in the quest, I‚Äôll have to do them again?
---
Ver T ibot? or is this something new I'm missing?
---
Normal vertibots can be found either at workstations that have the buildable platform (Poseidon, Ammo Workshop, Grafton) or I often see convoys in watoga or next to top of the world (If you've done enclave and unlocked general status you can track the convoys on your map as well)
---
Make stims, radaway, and disease cures and sell them for super cheap. Stim materials in particular are super easy to farm for, and everyone always needs to heal. 
---
Serums are selling decently well, but I‚Äôve made well over 20k today largely on small stuff that‚Äôs priced well. Although I have been afking a lot and server hopping whenever people stop showing up, so that helps.
---
No, you just need to get them done and do the other parts of the quest and you should be fine, most likely.
---
So serums sell at the bots for 3k+ depending on your build. No way would anyone buy it from me for that. The market for those is around 200 so if I already max out my vendors I sell for 200 and make more than 1400 a day.
---
Thatd be cool if they had it like tracker like with the "craft or scrap _____weapon 76 times"
---
It could be like "sell a stimpack 76 times" or something
---
Congrats on actually grinding enough possum badges to get the mod....
---
The unknown is simply what you don't value. I have something that I know is more valuable than what you can offer for caps.. if you limit yourself that way, you'll simply never know what I have to offer. At this point, the game reinforces this.. you think something will devalue what I have.
---
My answer is you'll just never know. Maybe you just have the wrong values.
---
So you're livin' in a VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER?!?
---
A wide variety would be great for "consume alcohol" challenges. Particularly the rarer ones, like the mixed drinks or new post-apocalyptic brews. Recipes would sell well, too.
---
Same and used tonight
---
I experienced that behaviour a few times yesterday.
---
I was hidden yet it would not let me fast travel.
---
In my case however moving a few metres in either direction seemed to work, I never had to fully exit the game to get it going again.
---
Ah alright. What‚Äôre the ‚Äúscout work challenge‚Äù badges for the order of the tadpole quest. I have no idea how to get past this.
---
I found a guy who had 999 adrenal reactions for 1 cap each but when I tried to buy one it said server error, not sure what happened there
---
Made 8k in 45 minutes just selling plans and serums. Selling serums for 275
---
Oh thank you.
---
Idk it took me all of 2 hours to get my pack. The test aren't that hard. A few of them took me 3 trys. Maybe 20 minutes to pass all of them
---
Thumbing this post right up to the sky
---
I am eternally grateful sir. Look forward to your sales. I was also shocked when people sell Vintage nukashine, now i get to enjoy the "trip" more often now and then deal atleast 1k powr fist damage and then end up somewhere in the map lmao. You can add me if you want a regular customer
---
Good tip
---
Attach a switch that leads to the vending machine 
---
Power source - switch - vending machine
---
You can just flip it on and off as you please, but anyone can just flip your switch then.....
---
Nice story and yet another instance of some very cool social things that happen in this game.
---
Thanks for the info. I removed a couple of mods that I thought I could do without -one was 'save everything'.
---
my bad, I realized part of the code was the first and last letter were always correct. So since Infected starts with I, and I is in the middle of the scrambled word, it doesn't work. The correct version is directed

To clarify, this is on PC

Ok thanks
---
Thank you so much my guy
---
What do you use them for ?
---
Shit I still need to make a friend on xbox and revive someone.
---
60 extra carry weight, but decreases energy and damage resist by 60 as well.
---
Well, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm pretty sure they have infinity stones inside them, we can‚Äôt open them yet though so we‚Äôre not sure. They might have something good inside them.
---
It hits for about 450 a shot at half hp with mutations and chems. I ran a Furious Explosive 50cal with a prime receiver but it was too expensive to keep fed for my liking.
---
It happens :)
---
I have found myself puzzled by similar issues in the past until I have the 'oh wait...' epiphany :P
---
They are end game only because there's nothing else. Look at it as something that was meant to be done along side normal game play. The base pack is level 20, so of you started the process then alot of the stuff should happen naturally. Some of it is out of the way yes. But it's not the end of the world
---
What in the actual fuck
---
Good point
---
Three times so far I‚Äôve logged in and the quest wasn‚Äôt active for me. Twice when trying to join someone for the revive part. I‚Äôve found if the quest isn‚Äôt active then I just log out and back in. Sometimes it works.
---
You mean Big Freds?
---
I believe that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre doing maintenance later. The recent update seem to have made it very unstable.
---
Some of the challenges are glitched. Made the frog habitat and didn't get credit for it
---
i believe both the dailies also have a chance to give you one cause i got one from the bug quest
---
Yes. It‚Äôs annoying.
---
Awesome work
---
I guess its a badge challenge, it may be possum, I'm guessing that's why everyones looking for those mothman wings
---
Pre the most recent patch the game was really quite stable and I'd rarely get disconnected. However after the patch I've had several disconnects.
---
It honestly feels like this update was the social push this community needed. No more fear of losing camp to griefers and all the reasons to interact with strangers.
---
I spawn in a different place than my teammate, he always gets stuck in my camp and I never do. I've moved my little camp thing from one end to the other trying to find a good place. Maybe people aren't aware of where others land?
---
Ah, I see it now, at the very bottom :P
---
Yeah I mean, I get it: increased revenue will lead to further development. But the game already failed to fulfill their quotas, so I doubt that the microtransactions will make a difference.
---
A good way to use the switch idea would have it inside a locked room and the wire going through a window to the machine.
---
A few sential peices that are lvl40 bought for 1k a peice sold for 10k roughly
---
I've got to say, everyone I've run into on the PC has seemed to be well mannered adults.
---
Except for that one dick roleplaying an Enclave member.  That clown can go pound sand.
---
I would love this feature! The only good thing about having the doors stay open is you know someone has been at your camp and what rooms they've looked at.
---
I just sold about 30 extra treasure maps at a whopping price of 25caps per ... I had alot of happy customers needless to say
---
Thank you for sharing!!
---
Get your hustle in quick. I can make all the serums and sell them for 100 caps each. The vendor thing is going to bring the prices of everything down very quickly until it all balances out.
---
I found a bunch of bases that were much better designed
---
my Camp is built for ease of traveling around
---
So they replace the Overseer with some sort of prototype vault tec robot or AI system.
---
Armor bench after finishing tadpole quest
---
They sell this at train station grafton now
---
&gt;If I sell it for less than that I'm losing money 
---
How so? Not ragging on, honest question. Regular Vendor wouldn't give you anywhere near even 250.
---
"Ah shit, here we go again."

How much does purified water sell for? I have almost 300 saved up.

u/defectivej
---
Lol. I thought the same thing. I‚Äôve never been a builder or outfit guy anyway. I spend too much time grinding. I had a level 40 something build my camp for me and it was cool. I just joined his team and he went to work. I‚Äôve only move my camp 1 time in 200 levels and before that guy rebuilt it let me just say it was bare minimal. When I first started camps were being destroyed all the time so I thought why take the time to build anything good. As I leveled up I really just didn‚Äôt care what my camp looked like. I was never there. 
---
But yeah now I feel bad when players come to my vending machine and see my level 200 camp lol.
---
Yes, sadly frequent disconnections is still in. Last night I blew my brain fuse when I start sprinting towards that pretty shop front of another player and.... I see that "Server not responding...." I gave up after it happened THREE times. Gonna give it a go when I get home from work today then try again.
---
Could‚Äôve made it mobile friendly
---
It's a Co op rpg.  Mmos don't have 24 people so that's why you can't call it an mmo
---
Sweeettt
---
&gt; but I‚Äôm convinced people would still shit on this game
---
Rightly so for the buggy shitty mess it was and is
---
If Bethesda hasn't answered how could anyone here possibly know the answer?
---
I bought an ass/cav arm level 50 for 100 caps. People dont know what they have I guess.

I agree 100percent including loving the quizzes.

Who is that and why do ppl on reddit care?
---
Whoever they are they can contact bethesda. 
---
That person probably knows why regardless
---
What is a stimpack diffuser and are you saying that challenge is not doable?
---
Yes.  This, please.
---
I am working on the plans myself. Taking advantage of the market while it lasts lol.
---
I'd take that deal but I'm low on caps right now. Thank you though
---
? If you are referring to the Road Encounter that triggers the quest... just server hop one location. Doesn't take long, I found it in 3 hops when it came out.
---
If you sold or dropped your first camera by mistake... you can find broken Pro Deluxe Cameras in containers all over Appalachia and remake it. I picked up six broken ones in 12 hours of game play today.
---
You're close. It's gonna be a ZAX computer.
---
yeah i've been server hopping pretty much nonstop since the camera was added.
---
I don't personally think a game dev as massive as Bethesda should be applauded for creating a playable game 6 months after launch. From what I hear the experience has gotten much better but there is absolutely no excuse for what was given to paying customers. FO76 at launch until now could have been developed by a no-name dev with no money. Bethesda is a AAA company that has more than enough money and assets to create something playable, or should at least understand that it's unacceptable to do this.
---
Was the A-team at Bethesda busy working on the 9th re-release of Skyrim? I'm legitimately confused as to how the B-team in Austin was expected to handle a game of this scope in the time-frame they were given
---
At least nobody's complaining about it being too easy like they did on the borrows. ü§£
---
Really cause I miss when fallout had more choices to be had to be made and some thinking into what to respond. 
---
Personally I like them cause it mixes things up and lets you do something a little different for a change.
---
There's highways you can build under
---
If you find a stimpack diffuser, let us good people know who have no idea what it is.
---
Taking photos has been fun though!
---
Then you're not server hopping the right location. You Google one spawn point that is confirmed for Him / Her to spawn and server hop only there.
---
the answer is yes, ive given several away.  i would suggest a post offering such an item to whomever  lost theirs for various reasons.
---
BUT not sure if it initiates the quest or if the note does.
---
We‚Äôre you still able to give them to people who haven‚Äôt done the quest? Or was it just to people who have?
---
I want to build close to vault 76 for free travel access
---
You can give broken cameras and they can repair it themselves if they have gotten the quest. Other than that you can give then an extra camera to use.
---
Stupid question but is there any way to get mutations without the negative side effects? I always contemplated getting mutations but the negatives seem to always outweigh the positives
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for awhile and haven‚Äôt seen it pop up. He must of glitched or something thanks for the help.
---
i have only given to others who had scrapped or lost the one they had already gotten from tourist.  so not sure.
---
Yeaaaah, one more disillusion...
---
Fast travel to your camp is already free. You don‚Äôt have to build next to Vault 76 to get free fast travel to your camp.
---
Hmmmm. Wonder if I‚Äôll need to test this. I will just feel bad if it doesn‚Äôt work lol.
---
Apparently neither do the developers
---
Not free for other players wanting to checkout my vending machine
---
Yes I think they're doing server maintenance on the 9th and It'll be down for a bit after 11 a.m. eastern standard time.
---
i would suggest posting in fo76 sub.  many people have argued saying the camera is irreplaceable, and they are unable to continue quest.  even though ive shown proof (my experience) that we can find the right cameras.  :(
---
Haven't found one yet. I'm guessing they aren't added yet but I haven't had to a chance to do the Campfire event yet so I don't know if you get it through that or not.
---
Probably 30-50 caps but idk I don‚Äôt use stealth
---
Oh then that‚Äôs actually pretty smart
---
 Go to Miners monument near uncanny carverns me and friend got it real quick had no luck at wavy waterpark place an jus server hop. Good luck ü§û
---
Yes sir
---
A keypad type of lock is probably the best.
---
30 seconds seems like a bigger problem client sidethan server side.
---
Especially if you had that problem before
---
Seriously. I was looking at the challenges and thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to take me a week to get a backpack because of the Burrows complaints.‚Äù
---
What platform?
---
Hey that's a pretty good idea!
---
Still unsure what to sell them for
---
We can hope. Personally I believe more traditional NPCs will eventually be added and that has been planned from the start. If you watch the original E3 reveal Todd doesn't shut out the idea of NPCs never coming to the game, just that they won't be around initially.
---
Right? It's like Bethesda saw people complaining about it and said "Alright... I got something for you fuckers" üòÇ
---
It seems as though some people aren't having that much difficulty with it. But many of us are and I'm one of them.
---
Or maybe youre just foolish and don't understand the difference between true value and personal value.
---
There are things ide pay 10k for. Thats it. Not a dime more. 2/5of the total possible income of the game. If you think you prove yourself right because this imaginary item might exist well goodluck sheepsquach hunter because you do live with a degree of self defeating fantasy. As a buyer idc what you value something at, you are selling it. It only matters if i think you are a rip off.
---
Edit and save
---
What do u play on?
---
&gt; Community, we need to change our expectations
---
Yes, I think we shouldn't expect a working piece of software for $60 real human dollars.
---
The lack of an Overseer will test the limits of human tribalism.  Directed by a prototype variant of the ZAX experimental supercomputer.
---
How?
---
bingo
---
Wait, people who don't like this game still hang around in this subreddit?
---
You are right. I would still love to have a Text Chat or something ele to communicate with other Players despite the Voice and the (not really accurate) Emotes
---
Wow you tried to lecture me on in game value when you havent played in months.  You dont even know the trade value of items and i made 10k in 2 days in retrades. You have made a fool of yourself. Good day sir. I will be blocking you if you respond and not answering a single message more.
---
Happy hunting fairweather fan
---
Wait is there a daily caps limit for vending?
---
Hes not using logic.
---
For me, it‚Äôs less difficulty and more time consuming? Also I get easily distracted while playing, so remembering what I need to do has been difficult.
---
Fuck those exams though. Christ.
---
Does it? Haven't build mine yet, I'm still trying to figure out where I want to move my camp now to open a Shop. In the moment it's in the middle of nowhere xD
---
Yeah, did that about 50 times, no luck. It's not really fun using the little time I have to play server hopping and hoping for the best just to participate in the new questline.
---
I completed seven of those exams is that enough?
---
take it easy, calm down with the caps lock
---
It‚Äôs very impressive. Now go take hundreds of photos of random animals lol.
---
Guy, I‚Äôve had heavy traffic building right outside of Whitesprings Station. And I mean, heavy traffic (38k in sales since launch, got me my first serum recipe) and I can‚Äôt sell a single Phantom Device for 150caps.
---
Bethesda should do better at communicating either way. Settling this matter once and for all.
---
I‚Äôd rather it load textures/buildings/land in faster than frame rate. Seems the game is back to being slow to load in areas again after this patch.
---
CApS LoCk?
---
Yea or no
---
I did that for other animals but there was no specific info on wolfs and rabbits.
---
Those tests were difficult to say the least. I just can't wait till I'm back online tomorrow and find out what the rest is, LOL
---
Will do. Hopefully it works, since so many of the tadpole challenges require the camera. If people could get it separate from the quest, that‚Äôd be great.
---
Yeah this was happening to me one day
---
Do not I repeat DO NOT calm down
---
Same. I‚Äôm at work right now and counting the hours until I can get back and go take more photos. :D
---
Everyone has had that problem (crashes) before with Fallout 76. I can guarantee the issue isn't my side, or client-side. It's a fresh install, no mods, and verified files. I was mostly curious about the current state of the game given I have no frame of reference for the last few months.
---
I have high hopes for a swift patch on this one.
---
Is kind of a 'biggie' to be 'locked out' of a large portion of unique content.
---
For what is worth my educated guess is that they won't 'sit on it' and leave those affected 'hung to dry'.
---
Full disclosure, I am not affected by the bug but it would just make sense to me to allocate some dev time to getting you guys 'back on your feet'.
---
üòÇ
---
Not, i've tested with fresh power armor, power armors with 200% durability and on all kind of power armor (got them all). Even with the ones at 200% we don't have the amount we should have.   
---
And since it's exactly 60 armor missing, it's obvious that it comes from the chassis.
---
Roll up door + pressure plates.  Solved
---
This is Vault-Tec. They probably all died in some horrible experiment. üëÄ
---
So there's a chance it'll stabilise as it had been working decently? I guess I'll try again after tomorrow's patch. Thanks for the heads up.
---
yea but if you read my post you will see my situation is different closing the game logging out nothing will trigger the kiddies corner cabins bot and also i didn't get the frog jar or frog habitat unlockable because it thinks i had already started the quest
---
Yes &amp; I'm glad he was
---
*** Heavy combat armor bolstering ap refresh with ammo weight reduced  leg- 50caps
---
With any luck it gets better again.
---
Extra carry weight reduces energy and rad resistance
---
The world changes you ape. There is maybe like....one or two major games, and i don't even know them, that exist where there's an AFTER CREDITS gameplay of the new world fater your changes, most games drop your ass back before the final decision. So nice try.
---
LOL thats awesome. SIT ON MY COUCH ! LOOK AT IT IT IS PRISTINE! DRINK THIS GO\*\*\*MNED PURIFIED WATER RIGHT FN NOW. AND YOU DAMN WELL BETTER COMPLIMENT ME ON MY PET BRAHMIN!
---
yes but it seems only a few people have this perticular bug so a fix might not ever happen for it cause they won't even know about it ...and putting in a ticket will do nothing for this
---
You could try the soft serve ice cream place where the responder vendor spawns server hop enough and you will get it but you'll have to unload on it pretty quick before it flys off, ive managed to kill it before he escapes best of luck ü§û
---
Mabey a minor one
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous and it won‚Äôt sell. No reason to be upset or offended about it (at most amused). They‚Äôll either lower their price or let it take up inventory or sell it for scrip. I put a legendary in that I wanted the scrip for but wouldn‚Äôt mind caps if I got enough. It did sell but if it didn‚Äôt I would have gone for the scrip instead. It wasn‚Äôt worth less to me to give up the scrip value.
---
Well done
---
It has +20% damage bonus.. its pretty good weapon
---
Some kind guy made video guides for first challenges.
---
I have 6/8 badges for carry weight mod plan and i was grinding it like crazy for whole fucking day. 9am -&gt; 11pm
---
If the camp owner is in the area a buyer can inspect the merchandise. If they're not around then you can inspect do goods.
---
It would even get so much better if we get personal diaries other dwellers could read. If we could build closer to eachother. If we could leave memos and notes. Leave supply containers on the map... Even more RP stuff
---
it's a rare reward for it
---
such a great post you have made my night.
---
Yeas
---
Spruce knob lake is near the big green tree looking workshop on the map
---
I am going to reply to the Skyrim bit which feels kind of off topic to the original post but I find it interesting. I really enjoy this fallout and I'm glad there are others who do as well. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't enjoy it!
---
Now for the Skyrim thing
---
&gt;Well, how about you choose not to don't do that? That's an option, right?
---
It is frustrating when it appears that people are not examining their own actions when discussing why something had a poor outcome for them.
---
However, I don't think it's fair to expect players to be a curator of their own experience within the context of an immersive open world game. That is literally the job of the game designer. Players shouldn't have to think about how their actions will negatively impact their experience *when it's not an intuitive choice*.
---
For example, I do not believe the player should be expected to think "hmm I shouldn't touch this piece of content because there may be no protections stopping me from experiencing something that I will find weird."
---
It is. It's not griefing and it's virtually impossible to get caught in game with the plausible deniability brought on upon legit buyers unintentionally kiting.
---
We don't have to worry about the in-game community punishing us unless they're willing to burn the innocent with us.
---
Bethesda made our jobs easy and efficient.
---
At 50 caps, even if the other *s were garbage, it would be worth it for the scrip alone
---
I found her last night in Beckley(?) In the Ash Heap. Parking lot outside of the workshop there. Totally random find.
---
This worked first try
---
Yea
---
Yeah it be cool if they added something like ffxiv fate system where it shows timer and a completion percentage.
---
Agree completely. The game seems to be ‚Äòpopulated‚Äô now.
---
I've been looking for a good bolstering piece
---
I love player vending
---
Found one on a glowing gulper down at the flooded train yard last night..
---
Its a shame they havent unbanned me yet or id help
---
Raise your hand if you've had to move your camp due to an unremoveable second floor. This guy has
---
Only to the floating base haters. The real architect's love em.
---
I run a Laser Gatling which has a good chance of turning things into piles of ash. I also have bloody mess which cause things to explode into small pieces. I think sometimes they both proc and the body just disappears. I helped kill a queen the other day and we almost didn't find the goo pile buried in all the other goo pile.
---
Thanks for saving lives.
---
Well that makes sense...lol. so it's a random drop I guess?
---
How in the world do players figure these things out? üòÄ
---
Indeed. Had to redo things many rime over because of the crashes
---
What patch? They didn't mess with auto melee?
---
Probably about as random as everything else haha
---
I ran a test tonight, you're absolutely right about adrenal reactions.  I must not have had Strange in Numbers on when I was calculating it out. Thanks for the correction!
---
Well i was selling/buying normaly for 500 per star on reddit before. But man i saw sole survivor, which is nothing extra for 10k caps.
---
Me too, took a risk with a 300 cap, 2* Zealots railway rifle as owner wasn't around. Turned out to be explosive! Sold one a week ago for ~10k! Keeping this baby for the SBQ
---
Literally have not met one person like this and have played since beta
---
I would spawn into on of mine sometimes and fall thru the floor because the game had not loaded it yet.lol
---
Kinda silly right? Makes it a bit over the top to complete this.
---
Post (or add to a thread if there is already one) in the official Beth forum if you haven't done so yet and ping a CM if you think the matter doesn't have any traction.
---
At least it will get 'seen'.
---
If that doesn't lead anywhere try regular social media (twitter etc).
---
I went to one today in the Ash Heap and it was one of the best I‚Äôve seen!
---
There is this farm where you can read a daughter's diary that says she went to the bank in grafton again but were refused another loan. That everything depends on the crops now but it doesn't look good. That they were going out of business. Near the corpse of mom and dad, you find a holotape dating just before the bombs that they won the lottery... How cruel.
---
Thanks. For whatever reason, there's no info on the wiki or here on Reddit.
---
getting those robot armor plans.... isn't so easy. Got a source?
---
I spent 18k yesterday at people's shops, don't think max caps is going to be as much of an issue anymore
---
man I love you for this!!!!!
---
ty i will try this
---
Honestly after realizing the rewards for the tadpole badges I just stopped and moved on to opossum ones..
---
I just got disconnected 5 times in 1 hour. Time to drink a nukashine
---
Im logged in if you need. Gt LtT4Z
---
This is for the opossum. Its leatherworker.
---
There is a recipe for Fasnacht sausage that uses the intestines
---
Well damn ya got me there haha
---
I dont know how to be creative. Id love to though
---
I know it like being a kid in a sweet shop again. Thankfully what I spent was made up in sales at my vendor. I'm loving it
---
Everybody is dead unfortunately. I can tell you about the experiment if you want.
---
They can make so when a player get close it opens or when they leave the camp area it closes
---
A couple new dailys as well.
---
White Springs Resort in the General Manager‚Äôs office
---
Right now I have an executioners handmade and I'm so in love. I dont know what other modifiers would be even better than that for me.
---
Text chat is so needed.  I ran into a guy today at his camp, who asked me if I knew where he can get Marine Armor plans.  Well yes, in fact I do!  But my mic is broken.... so I emote yes, but then have no way to tell him the answer.  I tried to get him to invite me to group so I could write it out with letters on his wall, but he just said "sorry I can't group right now."  So....  I left.  So frustrating.
---
1/4 of all accounts?? Are you crazy or something??
---
True but running around killing things on a checklist is hardly the pinnacle if gameplay experience now is it.
---
One in the pennetentry up north most of the time and in white springs as well. Dont go in the wendigo cave ;)
---
so what happened to explosive shotguns this patch?!? when they were nerfed the one time i was like yeah makes sense. they were brought to the point where id be able to 2/3 shot most non boss mobs.
---
but after this update im doing like.....no damage. it took me 12 shots to kill a single bloated one with my explosive pump.
---
to give you an idea, i can normally kill those with 2 swings of my sledge hammer.
---
so basically the vendor system in survival mode
---
No but if you hit 25k on your person, anything sold after that is lost items and caps
---
This patch you can't get the extra damage from over repairing melee weapons.
---
I know it isn't buffing the buzzblade,ripper and I think deathclaw so I assume most melee weapons are affected
---
All 3 times I went there it was a 2? Are you going to the right ammo store? It‚Äôs in Clarksburg but it‚Äôs unmarked it‚Äôs pushed right up against a yellow bus at the edge of the town heading towards the shooting range
---
What the hell... those challenges are already annoying as shit.
---
No clue actually I‚Äôve never seen someone selling one.
---
If you mean keycard convoys, i get a lot of them spawning at my camp at whitespring station.
---
I didn't see any patch note about it. Is it a bug?
---
Yeah i farmed dethclaws, i farmed behemoth, i farmed super mutant blood balls, i checked most of hunters cabins. Over 10hours of searching. You just have to have luck and get it as random drop. Fucking bethesda!
---
It seems that instruments didn't work already as like as the frog cans. Try to do some other badges maybe. Just did photographer and it works.
---
Wow that would be great, thanks! I am on PC
---
Yeah agreed, I actually just moved into Seneca Rocks. Jet packed up to the highest point &amp; somehow found a nice spot. Stunning view, Top of the World big &amp; clear, Monongah power station. I occasionally spawn into the rock but I just re-fast travel &amp; it puts me up in the base. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever seen a base here. No water though but I have near 200 purified water I think I‚Äôm good
---
I was gonna go for the easier challenges rip thanks a lot though.
---
Bought an Anti Armor explosive harpoon gun for 350 caps today. I already love these vendors haha
---
There is a whole list of every answer floating around this sub.
---
That is kinda dumb
---
Server maintenance scheduled 
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1126289393088704512?s=09
---
I‚Äôve gotten it twice today &amp; only got it twice before ever &amp; I‚Äôve been playing since December.. idk what it is but it‚Äôs gotta stop lmao
---
This is reasonable. Stealth boys and hallucigen canisters are both pretty easy to find.
---
Network of Fast Travel???   People joining groups to FT or something?
---
Well I do not think that the launch was quite as bad as the item dupes thing.  That is what sank the game completely.
---
Hmm, never really thought about it, but yes, I stayed away from players, trading or grouping because the possibility of my camp being griefed or me being attacked.   Accurate description: weird nuisance.
---
I hope it will work after some patches
---
Correct I just snagged that recipe for 50 caps earlier!
---
I found the machine, I never noticed them before. Thank you for the info. I truly appreciate it.
---
I personally sell plans that I find as I‚Äôm not making a loss but I‚Äôm also selling stuff that I want to get rid off
---
I believe its used in mystery meat pies too.
---
Then who gives a shit?
---
There are usually three Brahmin in the stream near top of the woods
---
üòÇüëç
---
Thank you so much!!
---
Yeah, I mostly solo and my playtime is usually of the "drop in, drop out" sort. I'd do a quest, some exploring, then I'd log out. Game never held my attention for but 15 mins. at a time. But since this update, I found myself playing the game for an hour or more (which for me is a long time playing FO76 at any one time).
---
Thank you, this worked by slipping just near the rocks to 'slide' into the water for revive.
---
I dunno. It‚Äôs definitely better but with the fire rate I still think flamer fuel is going to go fast as you can make it, probably faster. You‚Äôll need to have a different weapon to back it up.
---
You may be first, cg. It is fucking nightmare. Well now i don't know if i want it.
---
This guy was afk in his base. Furious SS Shiskebab for 500 got that (when they eventually buff it HOPEFULLY it‚Äôll be nasty) same guy had a Furious SS +strength Super Sledge for 2k, definitely snagged that up as well!
---
No one has ecer visited my camp before yesterday. Yesterday people came to check out my wares, amd spemt a bunch of time crafting in the workshop I have put together. It made it feel like there was a real purpose behind my settlement.
---
Oh my god! You are amazing! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Went looking for stuff like this tonight and just generally checking out different camps. Some thoughtless individual - who no doubt thought he was being clever - had a rad shower constantly running at the top of a staircase and I wound up losing Marsupial because I didn't see it until it was too late. :/ Now I REALLY Have to find someone selling these plans.
---
YES, I built my mountain base for a reason!! Enjoy the damn view with me!!
---
One of winterspring inside vendor have it. Check it
---
-60Er and -60rr is minor???
---
Maybe that was the big and it got fuxed
---
Can confirm that you can purchase with it off still. Someone did that at my camp while I was watching. I'm just going to make a room and put a lock on the doors.
---
its game breaking when your pump goes from taking 2 shots to kill one, to taking 12.
---
mabye its not as bad if youre spamming a combat shotgun or have a tse, but jesus fuck the normal explosive shotguns are completely unusable now.
---
What platform are you on? I have like 4 of them lmao
---
Quick question, for the tadpole challenges, when it says camera picture does that I have to find the camera?
---
Which part of the quest where you up to?
---
I can't do without it. I love the ability of typing in the quantity and price. Setting up 120 slots of vending machines without the mod was very painful!
---
Kuddos for letting 3 out of the "Fallout story RPG" denominations. 
---
I agree with you, there ain't as much as in the past games. However the story is indeed a Fallout Story, with its lot of stupid treasons, little lies, sad death and atomic boogaloo.
---
Sure, the lack of alive NPC make it feel like there's no consequences to our actions, but that's pretty normal considered the time frame. However, a few interactions here and there (given, with holotapes and computers for now) are already indicating that what we do does matter,  lorewise.
---
mine went down by probably 80-90%. to the point where my explosive pump took 12 hits to kill a level 68 goul
---
1/4 of all accounts..? Where tf did you get that statisticüòÇ If you duped &amp; got banned no matter the item that sucks for you or whoever got banned, next time don‚Äôt dupe? None of us did &amp; we‚Äôre enjoying the game lol
---
I did the ecological balance one and it didn't show up
---
Good question... Honestly, I don't know. I haven't tried any of the 'take a picture' using photo mode.
---
I already had the camera.
---
Still need it? I can help
---
Even the "story" criticism are bad : the lore in Fo76 is very interesting. If you read and ear every terminal, holotape and notes, you know as many things about David Thorpe, the raider boss, as you know things about Preston Garvey. The only difference is the way you learn about them. 
---
I find the lore of 76 more interesting than the lore of Fo4, because you learn about the pre-war life, the enclave, and all the post war organisation in Appalachia until the scorched wiped everyone.
---
Leaving notes would be fun. Containers as well. Even just the planned display cases will be fun because you could set up a real shop like looking settlement. Sending intra-mail from personal terminals would be rad, a bit more immersive.
---
50 caps.
---
Less if I can buy in bulk.
---
My son was trying to grenade himself too but he died about 5x in a row before we stopped. He was level 3. How do you guarantee a revival? Is he getting too much damage done to him?
---
They should allow you to inspect even if the owner is away. I didn't buy a few items already because I couldn't see what some of the legendary effects were.
---
Okay, well you on PS4? I got like 7 extra cameras today
---
There's always something to do. 
---
If you get bored, grab a gamma gun and go to whitesprings. Find someone doing ghoul-killing runs and run with them, healing the ghouls with your gamma gun. 
---
So much fun :D
---
Good question. My nocturnal Explosiv Pump has at night 477 dmg without Perks. I need 3 - 4 shot for a lvl 68 Scorched wtf. Before the patch every of my Explo shotguns does around about 250 dmg that was enough to kill 2 of them in 1 shot. Maybe a visual bug?
---
I‚Äôve done the new event 3 times &amp; got shit the first one (just basics stimpak‚Äôs, water, Radaway) then the 2nd I got the s‚Äômores recipe &amp; then the 3rd time I got the same basic event rewards no recipe or plan so idk if there‚Äôs a lot of plans like the Free Range event or if the new event is just worthless after you get s‚Äômores. It‚Äôs technically a guaranteed legendary spawn but it‚Äôs 1 star soooo
---
Much appreciated!
---
Definitely
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to find out, where does one find a camera
---
for me this is the best part off the update, been able to see other ppls camp at will has filled a viod the game had it really feels like an online game.
---
I got comms banned yesterday after asking people to kill themselves....
---
At least on light leather armor, pocked and deep pocket add pockets all over, and it's especially noticeable on the chest piece. I don't know if there's a difference in appearance between them though.
---
Nevermind ü§¶ just found out I can't sell, trade, or drop the extras. Just wasted a huge pile of materials fixing them up and they're totally worthless. FML.
---
Not if you left them in a "bloody mess"?
---
It‚Äôs no minor but it also gives you +120 carry weight lmfao so definitely has a major upside for people who don‚Äôt care about RR or ER. (The two less common damage types tbh) I see waaay more ballistic
---
I actually like trying to find my way up and down the mountains. My camp is in the Savage Divide, of course.
---
You hit the nail on the head in your last paragraph. It was never meant to be a story based, serial fallout. It was one of their spinoffs and knowing that it was easy for me to take the game for what it is. I really love the game mind you, it has a lot of the core exploration and passive story telling that I prefer from the fallout series so it suits me well. You just have to put some effort in to enjoy it.
---
Could you imagine if they had made Fallout 5 and tried putting this multiplayer in it instead of trying it in a spinoff first? They would have ruined FO5.
---
I saw someone's base yesterday it had a pressure plate under the powered door and it opened and closed real nice.
---
HAHAHA yeah it is Big Fred‚Äôs but I like Big Bubba‚Äôs BBQ betterüòÇ
---
Any chance you can make it so I can make a copy of the file for my drive? I'm having a bit of a hard time with the formatting.
---
*in whine kid voice*
---
But I want to grow them myself!
---
Kill a bunch of super mutants or scorched, loot ALL their weapons, then \*walk\* to the nearest shop. Best done close to a shop...
---
name and shop location?
---
In case you're still looking for 45s, I have over 5k for sale but not through vending since I can't afford the stash space.
---
Let me know?
---
Sure are my PSN is Quieo_Squared are you on right now?
---
Hermclan123......thank you for your service. I am prior military myself (Army). I was in from 1987-1994... I know I am old. I was Desert Storm and Panama Invasion. I am on PS4 (AvgGuy42..level 218). I have to say to all the camps I have seen.....OUTSTANDING JOB. I also want to apologize to any body who had live stock in there camp, only to come home and find them deceased. It was my mutation that killed them (the one that gives off the plague) I believe it‚Äôs called plague walker. I am so so sorry.
---
Ouchies lol mine is from the ban waves a few months back. I was a bounty hunter and destroyed peoples duped junk. Got a ban but dont regret it. I do wish bethesda would just email me back saying no they wont unban me so that i can give up and uninstall or prepare for the unban
---
Maybe did understand and was looking for the buyer who did not understand.
---
Yeah I sit there looking at my frog habitat all day wondering if I‚Äôll get the cred for it
---
My alt was lvl 5 or 6 and when I grenaded myself I was at 40% hp, I basically threw it on the ground and went on top of it but flatwoods is a stream. Maybe being lvl 3 is too low? Also, depends on the grenade, I haven't looked at it but I assume baseball grenade does less damage then frag one.
---
I do believe that picking any plants at all with make you wanted.  So no one is going to loot the front plants either.
---
Maintenance is going down for fix at 11 est I think
---
Go to camp adams. There is event over night. Server hop to trigger it. There are fucking milions of mosquitoes.
---
It was introduced in the last patch, you need to find one of two NPCs to get the quest started, Ansel or Anne:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist\_and\_camera\_all\_possible\_spawn\_locations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist_and_camera_all_possible_spawn_locations/) 
---
This is a place to start I guess :)
---
I had more success visiting the possible spawn locations in one server than staying in one location and server hopping however I didn't do the math for the odds in either case so do whatever you think suits you best ;)
---
Seems like that would be an easy screenshot and report to Bethesda.
---
If someone has a floating camp, it should get completely demolished if you destroy the foundation it's on. Like ark, or rust.
---
Nice.
---
"dense" like paladin Danse? Elder Maxson send me. Sir i have to check, if you are a synth. Ad Victoriam
---
You've activated my tactical dot card!
---
At this point, all you can do is to try and buy another one off a player.
---
.
---
This has been mentioned several times before. It makes no sense and everyone else is hoping Bethesda will allow it.
---
Preach!
---
I did stings and things and the toxic goo one again and didn't get a badge for those either.
---
As I understand it the explosive effect was causing double damage instead of the intended 20% boost. Patch 9 fixed that. However did it over fix it?
---
They might still be able to buy, but turning the electricity off to the machines removes you from the map as a vending station. Only passers by would be able to buy anything. Also assualtron keycards are a good cap dump I use all the time.
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
[](/celestiawarfare)I dunno man, you might've dodged a bullet. I had a guy rock up on my base, and loudly complain about how there was nothing worth buying while people were trying to shop. He must've sat there for 20 minutes berating my shop until all the other people left.  
---
  
---
I'm pretty proud of my selection, I've got all the varieties of both Chems, and booze for discerning followers of *the lifestyle* at no more than 10caps each if not less. I've got a fine variety of nearly every kind of legendary weapon/Armor(all at less than 500 caps). Tons of hard to find plans I've painstakingly collected, Every variety of stable flux, I've even got a junk extractor I leave unlocked for people to take freely from...  
---
You get the idea. Killed my buzz pretty hard. Sorry for the rant.
---
Ironically the most dangerous enemy in the wendigo cave isn't even a wendigo.

Still a whiner somewhere!

The 7 shot 6 shooter that Arnold Schwarzenegger uses in the rather fun and daft film Cactus Jack (or The Villain pending the country of release)
---
Doesn't sound possible? Wasn't something already implemented so as they could do nothing with any of the duped inventory but destroy it to a certain weight.
---
So how exactly do you know they had "millions"?
---
Servers have been very unstable for me with literally nobody on the server (seriously - just me) so i have little faith in your conclusion.
---
Really waiting for compound bow to go full Lara Croft. What's more post apocalyptic than that?
---
Server maintenance going ahead today so fingers crossed that sorts it
---
In fact, i believe Bethesda already has server maintenance scheduled for today to address some issues.
---
The brotherhood cares for its knights and paladins. Humans must stick together against the dangers of the harsh wasteland . We must fight against these goulish abdominations and the failed unethical experminents called supermutants for humanitys sake.Ad victoriam!
---
Elder Maxson send his regarts
---
Just a joke mate
---
I don't think anyone really knows how Explosive works, especially for multi-projectile weapons. There are a lot of ways that it could work. Some of them would be at least as good as a non-explosive shotgun, but some of them wouldn't.
---
Yeah I walked away from an AA Gatling plasma for that reason. Was priced at 3.5k but the other perks could have been garbage. Not sure if I made a mistake but either way it would be nice to have seen them
---
https://imgur.com/a/dugnRmJ
---
I forgot reddit is full of slow people
---
This would allow e.g. raiders to organise themself to raid some camps, or brotherhood knights to unite against the abdominations of the wasteland
---
Not sure on the area, but those small purifiers are an option.  But I much prefer the industrial one as it is far more efficient.
---
Don't stand on the behemoth, but definitely kill him* and then build your camp on his pond. He will guard your stuff. I call him Dave. 
---
*if you don't kill him he will try to redecorate you and your camp while you build it.
---
I tried to screenshot but it moved down. I don‚Äôt know if it was millions or tens of millions. I thought you couldn‚Äôt move if you were over weight but he was moving around fine.
---
I got backpack in 4hours. Couls be two if i know what i am doing.
---
Now i am farming for mod. Over 14hours. Have 6badges lol.
---
Great ! Thanks!
---
Fof 3.5k you couldn't have gone wrong!
---
Same problem. I haven't unlocked the robot legs and arms. I can only craft the chest.
---
I snagged a screenshot also. I already reported to Bethesda.
---
idk..feels that way. mainly because my explosive shotgun does less than my normal shotgun.
---
theres literally no point to use it if it does less and also endangers the user
---
Mount Blair under the giant saw
---
Me too. I've found 3 so far. I think they added it so you can have multiple lenses without going to the tinker bench every time you want to swap...just my thoughts.
---
Exactly my thoughts! I guess people like to whine. Yesterday i play for a few hours and then i closed the game because i felt overwhelmed with all the things i have to do lol. I don't remember the last time i felt this way (lvl 203 now)
---
I love it though :D
---
Are you talking about the tourist camera? Someone did a post about all the locations they spawn on here. I server hopped about 10 times at land view lighthouse and it still didn‚Äôt spawn for me. So I fast travelled to wavy Willard‚Äôs and it spawned second server hop for me
---
Anyone see the irony in a cheat sheet for a boy scout exam? Me either,  fuck it. Some of these questions are insane.

Go to the pond north of Watoga. There's a queen spawn, attract her attention, go inside the shed, she'll send spawnlings to try to get to you. Voila!
---
Not saying i don't believe you, but i don't believe you.
---
I don't even have that perk yet and my crafted crossbow has well over 100% durability.
---
How can I add a photo to this post?. I got a screenshot that is missing name so I won‚Äôt break rules.
---
Well done! No mean feat :) Enjoy your pie!
---
Why are people so negative about f76? Stop playing if you don't like the game. A few days and you will see.
---
I actually think it could recover given that Bethesda keep adding content, especially story and challenging gameplay honestly I'm not so impressed by what I've played of the scout questline and the camera questline so far, but I really did enjoy the sheepsquatch investigations.
---
The vending is a great boost to the community and overall gameplay, now we just need spawn points for camp fast travel to stop people spawning in the camp, in floors ect.
---
I'm excited to see what the future Vaults will be like, hoping they can be run Solo and instanced for us lone wolves out there. Not that I am in anyway adverse to playing with others but often I like to go at my own place and really explore. Also as my bud is stealth based my pacing is slower than a heavy gunner in power armour and I hate being rushed.
---
Nuclear winter sounds interesting, I'm hoping it really shakes up the survival aspects of the game with a more irradiated and hostile landscape.
---
All in all, if they keep adding content, new places to explore and story I think we'll be set for a good recovery.
---
The fuck hahaha there‚Äôs seriously no reasoning
---
You do know you can get the camera in red toolboxes right? I found one in a toolbox in Harper‚Äôs Ferry
---
AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
---
Someone come to my house with that shit (literally) I need more fertilizer for my Unsullied Cat Topiary Army.
---
So a lot was added in the latest update but to me the standout feature is player vending. We can now sell our junk to other players. To me however, It's the implementation that has really shaken things up.
---
You build your vendor and fill it with your wares, once connected to the power, your camp appears on the map. Players that highlight you camp can see what kind of items you're selling and fast travel directly to your camp.
---
Player vending on its own is one thing, but knowing where nearby camps are and being able to fast travel to player designated areas has been just that little something extra. I've got people stopping by my camp regularly and that just wasn't a thing before.
---
From what I've read (not experienced) you can repair them.
---
Oh yeah, most definitely.. Found a &gt;!battle strategy note!&lt; while I was exploring the place.
---
It is even lower rate i did maybe 8events and had 2badges.
---
game is shit CHECK,
---
Helmet looks/sounds like a cheap toy CHECK,
---
in-game items aren't worth shit CHECK,
---
glow in the dark map costs 50c at best CHECK,
---
getting a super shitty nylon bag is about as good as getting a grocery plastic bag CHECK
---
Yes it‚Äôs an uncommon reward for the challenge, and they are a pain to make, keep a lookout for syrup, sugar, spices, I can‚Äôt remember what else, there‚Äôs around 7 ingredients
---
Not bad, I plan to just carry a few backpacks for different purposes. High capacity when near weight limit, extra armor when running around as melee.
---
Um having mule accounts is allowed buddy.  Being a trader i have some my self .
---
I did notice that as well, part of me wondered if it was regarding the placement of the Legendary exchange machine? Or it could have just had a lighting upgrade which is nice. As Watoga station was pretty dark.
---
you would prefer the weak, cheap looking, uncomfertable, unwashable nylon to canvas?
---
Next thing you'll want will be spinning picture frames.
---
The quarry you mean ? If so that's where I've been trying to do it. To no avail.
---
I get it, the principle but seriously, we‚Äôre talking about repair kits... chill man. It‚Äôs not P2W. you can‚Äôt bust out a repair kit in the middle of a firefight, so that argument is out the window. The principle still stand, they broke a promise. Does this open the door for P2W? MAYBE a BIG maybe. We‚Äôll have to wait to see, but crying about a repair kit isn‚Äôt worth your time man.

\[Intelligence Check 7\] No, you're not crazy.. Things have changed.
---
What platform.
---
not well known info. oh well.
---
Yeah same..
---
I think the office of the taxidermy place. Let me know
---
It sucks, but I don't think anyone can.
---
That would be so fun leaving holotape voice recordings as notes. That could lead to thins like community scavenger hunts with clues and a prize at the end for the victor. That could be so much fun!
---
I tried to hook my buddy up with a backpack earlier and it wouldn't let me. Pretty sure it's thr same concept.
---
Looking at screenshot he had 9 billion+ adrenal serums alone. I took a screenshot and emailed Bethesda already.
---
I must be a very rare exception then. I'm 267 and run through for Collision Course which is one of my favourite world events, and what's already been said.. It's a partially decent area to farm to .38's, .45's, .308's and Shotgun shells.
---
PC. Is it the place or not ?
---
You can find 3 of them at whitesprings in the room across the big room with the crafting benches
---
I thought they had something in place for mass duped items.
---
I just came here to see if it was something to do with the new dupers.
---
Player vending bug:  
---
When stacked items are purchased, the seller gets a notification with an incorrect amount displayed. The amount they are told was purchased is actually the amount the buyer has in their inventory after the sale. 
---
For example, I have 835 rounds of 5.56. I purchase 350 from a player for 1c each. The player receives a pop up notifying them of the 315 caps they just received, but also see in the corner that someone just bought 1185 (the amount I would now have). 
---
I actually have a thread about this.  I'll edit in a link.

There's a cave sort of off to the south-west of the vault, then! It's not super big, but it's pretty size-y and you can build around it as well. I don't recall the exact location but if you've hit the big hills before the Mothman town, you've gone too far west, and if you've hit the curve in the road you've gone too south.
---
I guess this means Chainsaws and Drills are still broken. That's a shame.
---
Can confirm, there is one in his office. Thanks again!
---
I'd like planters that clip through the floor, there's nothing worse than floating crops. Razorgrain is the absolute worst for it.
---
I think I've spent as many caps on fast travel to camps than I have made from sales lol. This was a great addition though. I've gotten to see some amazing camp builds and met some really nice people
---
Dang, that sucks... Guess I have to do it the old fashioned way, looks like from some recent posts that it's easier to find a camera, at least.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
In Fort Defiance next to the safe for forbidden knowledge
---
Did you by chance look for "veil of secrets" or whatever it's called after you repair/fabricate a new one?
---
I have two spare, what platform?
---
Np
---
No there aren't. Last week:"There‚Äôs nothing to do", This week:"Server hoping, waiting behind load screens right after another, bugged inspect, bugged challenges, relisting 120 items because bug unlisted all your items"
---
I've been finding them randomly in containers. I have like 5 now. I think they made them easier to find. Just scavenge like normal, and you'll come across one. üôÇ
---
Yes they do function. There was a thread on here a bit ago of a guy's youtube vid where he was launching unsuspecting peeps off his porch.
---
Not gonna lie, I laughed quite hard.
---
Not just you. Ran thru and got one, one star legendary.
---
I place bags full of propaganda Flyers all over peoples doors
---
Whatever they were doing it isn‚Äôt stopping them now so they are signing back in now.
---
Awww.. You could have left him the little bits of junk!
---
Nah, there's still nothing worthwhile to do.
---
Yep, maybe it's something to do with the platform. Because I didn't have problems
---
You, I've been using that perk that reduces fast travel cost.
---
I even saw one player yesterday who has their camp about ten feet from 76, assumably for the free fast travel. They has the right idea. XD
---
Haven't come across one yet, but I might not be looking in the right places, hopefully I come across one soon :D would love a more mobile photomode. (Not to mention the challenges for it, either)
---
I used about 900 acid and 450 oil and made about 4000 flamer fuel (with ammosmith and super duper). That doesn‚Äôt feel like enough, that was a ton of acid and acid isn‚Äôt lead or gunpowder. Guess I‚Äôll still be tapping the fire button instead of holding it.
---
I appreciate your viewpoint
---
I agree.  Far fewer legendaries.  All of the diseased ghouls used to be hidden legendaries dropping 1* trash.   Now they don‚Äôt.  But I am getting higher    stars now when drops occur.
---
That's true, but you are still losing caps by selling it to players none the less.
---
Take off your weapon artisan perk before fixing it.  Doh!
---
You know Thats possibly a visual glitch right? Its viturally impossible to have that many of said item in your inventory after prior patches. Also id they did you sure as hell wouldnt have been abke to even see inside their inventory due to the over max weight patch not allowing you to even trade with said person. Now that being said i do call bullshit.
---
If you playing at Pc, join me asap, please. IGN:emreyigit93
---
Wow what special effects did it have for someone to pay 18k caps for it? In other words elder Maxson wants to know your economical strategy to rebuild human society with a strong and stable economy . Ad Victoriam!
---
I agree but he was bragging and it showed it. I have to wait 24 hours to post a pic in this subreddit because I am a lurker.
---
Set up an imgur account and post the screenshot.
---
You more then likely just set up and reported a guy for doing what most people do with their inventory due to a cisual glitch thats happened to countless people almost daily and they post about it on reddit even lol
---
Never mind. I did it. 
---
It was probably a bug with the servers or the mobs.
---
I didn't need to hide, I was there with another player and she spawned a ton instantly this time.
---
Took me only 10 server hops :s
---
I sold my lv 35 TSE shotgun for 8k caps.
---
When I was setting up the prices at the start I didn't really want to let it go because it's the best gun I owned but never used because I'm melee only and shotgun ammo was getting hard to come by if I only used a  shotgun.
---
18k is pretty standard for that weapon. I've been offered an absurd amount of caps for my BE Handmade (50k plus trades). It's definitely a sellers market.
---
Or you can use a bench / chair / bed / etc. on the other side of a window to just pop through the window / wall.
---
Was it north or south from the ice cream place?
---
I have 5 spare I fixed up (PS4) let me know if that suits ya.
---
I can't sell them in my shop, but I can drop them...
---
This is accurate, but it's not as useful if you're stuck *inside* the house.
---
I agree with you, it was a stupid way to give it too us. Get read to use that camera to complete all sorts of boring lists to get a backpack.
---
It's not minor at all idk why it's so much I think I read that the other mods also take a lot a way which is kind of ridiculous I can understand like - 25 but as it is rn that's pushing it
---
Thanks for this. Will definitely check it out
---
But with that said instead of being limited to a few caves as a workaround would be nice to be able to build camps that look like Bivs house etc
---
My door is unlocked and i have an open sign if you feel like having a glass of whiskey and maybe watch a nuke go off from my balcony [Ps4]

I've also made a similar [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm9eii/having_actual_logs_of_sold_items_through_vending/), so may be we could bump it together and get some traction for the big B. to notice.
---
Got it to work thanks !
---
It was probably a bug with the servers or the mobs. I didn't need to hide, I was there with another player and she spawned a ton instantly this time.
---
I don't know if I could honestly fork out those caps lol. Maybe it's the Fallout Cheapskate in me who immediately turns to "I'll just find it in the open world" when I need like 2 screws but won't spend the 5 caps for em üòÇ
---
I have 5 I have fixed up...must check the weight as I doubt I will be carrying all of them around...I was hoping to sell them but sadly not.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many people play this game and don‚Äôt visit reddit. Finding your weapon to some is as exciting as finding your best drop. Without being active in trading on reddit I‚Äôd imagine lots of folks out there have lots of caps. I sold armor plans for way more than I believed they would sell for and they sold anyway. Player vending has made caps fun and valuable.
---
Lol! I seem to have the same problem.  I'm maxed out on caps across 3 characters &amp; I'll still grind for my own damn junk!
---
I'm melee as well. Been using the "All Rise" Super Sledge FOREVER as it gets the job done. I normally whip the TSE's out if I'm certain I'll need it for a hard boss or something that I don't want to be in melee range of üòÇ
---
Yeah i dont want it now. Maybe good for bersekers build tho
---
Yeah I had issue too, she spawned them at my second try.

I find exiting and re-entering the build menu temporarily fixes some of those errors.
---
Cheers pal, I will keep an eye open haha
---
Since yesterday‚Äôs update I‚Äôve found a bunch in random containers. They def realized how it was wasn‚Äôt working and changed it in the latest patch.
---
No he was bragging in a public area. He also had the balls to complain that the server was lagging.
---
it might be a few before I get on but I will help and won't cost you caps.
---
Player vending has made me love the game more than I already have. The robot vendors better look out. There's people literally opening shops next door selling the same shit for half the price lol. Also seeing how creative people are with their CAMPS has been amazing even with the certain build restrictions.
---
That‚Äôs epic.  How the hell wasn‚Äôt that account not picked up by the over-100,000 script?
---
Oh god lord, thanks for that tesla tip!! I have bloodied one, didnt thought about that.
---
Cool. (Throws that one rad ant lager he was holding on the ground). Probably take six months to fix.
---
There's not a lot to decorate with unless you get all the fancy lads stuff from the Atom shop. üòÅ
---
He hadn‚Äôt signed in a while. I don‚Äôt think they are actively looking at dormant accounts and shit hit the fan today
---
And thats what makes caps near worthless in the end.
---
New player has 250 caps, buys serum from you, sells to vendor, now has 500 caps. comes back, buys 2 more, sells to vendor for 1000 caps. rinse repeat, soon player has no need for more caps, if player has no need for caps, caps become worthless.
---
Honestly if legendary enimies were rarer but a 3 star 100% dropped a 3 star item,  2 drops 2 and so on. I could live with it as long as it wasn't super rare
---
Or go to Flatwoods -shrugs-
---
I frequently see cook fires just outside windows . . .
---
He hadn‚Äôt signed in in a while. I don‚Äôt think Bethesda is searching dormant accounts, just the people who where signing in. It seems like sh*t hit the fan today.
---
You can probably do these at a teammates base if he locks his terminal and you break into it (if you don‚Äôt join the same team). Works for a different challenge.

My first camp was literally a tent, a sleeping bag, a few benches and a camp fire. üòÇ

---
Ok sure....i also i have multiple acocunts where i store stuff. And i also have a toon with weapon weight armor and so many diffrent weapons it causes instability in the area im in. So again you probably set a guy up and repoted him because of a visual glitch and because he was cocky about having mules... Lol sounds like a witch hunt the more you speak. Also slunds like a it of jealousy in all honesty
---
Not a bad shout.
---
I‚Äôm using normal, but I‚Äôll test that later.
---
Yes, still trying
---
Ok I will have to try that
---
I've seen plenty of tse go for 30k+ on discord. Whoever bought that at 18k got really lucky.
---
I was thinking it would be great if we could track sell history with the personal terminal they gave us.
---
He said he had millions. I bought 3 and the number went down. This is pretty open and shut for them if they look at his accounts. He will get banned. Bethesda needs to know the script isn‚Äôt working.
---
Just wanted to update that with episode 9 this still works without issues.
---
The only thing that changes where you'll spawn is where you place it initially, aka moving your camp. You might spawn there or somewhere else, but everyone else will spawn directly where you put it (or very close to it), and moving it around after the fact doesn't change where THEY will spawn (It still might change where you spawn though). Anyone who spawns at my camp always spawn where I put the camp module, and no amount of moving the camp module has change that.
---
Wow, all that mutations and OP legendary weapons and armor and you still can hit a cardboard :U
---
What you‚Äôre feeling is the nerf the rest of us felt when they actually nerfed us but not you.
---
I need to revive too, could be on in 5 mins.
---
I haven't seen this event once...
---
?
---
You like server instability? The server went to total hell when he showed up for EVERYONE. We were in a group. Bethesda needs to know script isn‚Äôt working.
---
It trigger every time at night when you stand in camp adams
---
You available right now? We can do this
---
I've just added you. "Epedemic-", got no mic, so i'll just try to find &amp; follow you and see if we can work it out. No caps needed, but i also need to revive you.
---
So you need to physically stand there to trigger the event? It won't show up on map like others?
---
Same here. Legendary Stingwing was kicking my butt
---
Yeah, my Beth id is TraumaticSoup
---
My super sledge has 40% power attack damage and damage to bugs (still haven't found a better one) if I'm in power armor I just facetank everything now. Bugs just die when they come into range.
---
I found a bowie knife yesterday. It has double damage to targets at full health as well as 40% power attack damage and +1 str . That first power attack is stupid powerful when I'm going solo.
---
That is the going rate on PS4.
---
Hahaha i dont think you know the difference between a lag spike and actual server instability and on top of it man the servers have been shit since update. Your still in the wrong on this one
---
At later levels, once you stop caring as much about ammo consumption rates (because steel, lead, and gunpowder are pretty easy to scrounge up, plus it's easy to buy ammo on the market in a pinch) I recommend the .50 Cal MG
---
Yes, the .50 Cal ammo takes a bit more steel to make, and it hits slightly less hard than a Gatling Gun *per shot*, but it's very quick with exceptional DPS, it's accurate, and it reloads quick too (slightly slower than the Gatling Gun, but much faster than the Gatling Plasma or Laser). Tears down  Bravos and mows down hordes of Scorched equally well because it's fast enough to hose down a horde, but high enough base damage to not bounce off big armored targets (a problem of the mini-gun). Perfect middle-ground for every occasion.
---
Also, the comment earlier about bandolier making 5mm ammo weightless is inaccurate just fyi. Definitely take Bandolier anyway because it's a great perk for heavy gunners, but the person is slightly mistaken. The ammo says 0 wt, but if you drop it you'll notice your wt change because it does have wt, just very very little lol
---
are you on xbox, if so I would buy it from you.
---
Still can't inspect legendary effects in the vendor.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmgoka/light_wood_laminate/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

All events trigger by people who pass around.
---
So stand in camp adams and server hop. Or wait till night and go there.
---
Btw if you can, pick tesla rifle with you. Too much mosquitoes.
---
Yea i have tried to loot a house close to my freinds camp but the lvl 3 lock safe is always empty has been empty since the last patch
---
Why did you mark it at 0 caps? If you did it, even if you recorded it, why would Bethesda support that? 
---
Item= x caps... 
---
Improvement would be not selling it 0 caps. 
---
Sorry to sound negative but I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd mark it at 0 caps in the first place...
---
Nah, just with a vendor at your camp it appears on the map and can be fast travelled to, even if it's in an obscure location.
---
A handful of people probably visited it while you weren't checking your map.  But yeah, I'm definitely getting much more people visiting my camp now that it has vending machines.
---
I absolutely had no idea! ...I don't even know if scouts over here even have merit badges, to be fair.
---
But I agree; even a sash that updates everytime you get a badge would be great.
---
Yea I got the weapon without stepping foot into survival mode.
---
I also sold the weapon for 2000 caps.
---
Good Whitesprings needed to be nerfed for all the legendary spawns actually.  Now they will feel ... legendary.
---
There is a level 1 and a level 2 inside Fort defiance.
---
I was level 104 when I launched my first nuke. There's so many things to do.
---
Thanks...   I went to a couple of CAMPs with two Vendor Machines, I assumed that they were the same and to provide service to multiple people.  I never tried setting up more than one.
---
I assume that each Vendor Machine has it's own 30 slot limit?   So you could sell 60 different items by setting up 2x Vendor Machines, etc?
---
Thanks cheers
---
Sent you a request - dignite
---
They did say Private servers were coming at the end of 2019. So hopefully they're still on track to release that.
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
I mean, I'd love to be able to mosey on down to my garden, then pick every possible flower and plant. Then I'll make a quick trip to the abattoir at the other side of my camp where I have a fridge full of every type of meat in the game. After that, I'll swing by my lead, steel and acid extractor. Then when I'm done crafting bullets, I'll go to the little elf workshop hidden behind that tree to see if they made me any springs and screws and obviously give them a stern look if they haven't made enough so I can repair all my Power Armours. Oh yeah, don't forget to visit my Tactical Brahmin whose manure contains ballistic fiber.
---
I know, this is a bit of an exaggeration, but if we get everything we need in our Camp, what's the point of going out there and looking for stuff? I live having to go on scavenging trips, especially because I always get side-tracked and discover something new or interesting.
---
Start by following the main story line ... but let yourself get distracted along the way. I explored most of the map while doing the main quest. That's 100+ levels worth of content right there.
---
Yes, this is still true but more than half of the random people on fb or twitter commenting on fallout 76 posts aren‚Äôt even complaining about bugs. They are still harping in about the lack of human NPCs, story, just make fallout 5.
---
Guaranteed magnifying glass spawn in the big army tent on the road behind Vault Tec university in Morgantown, It‚Äôs on the white shelf on the right as you go in the tent and it‚Äôs the shelf that has the globe on it, there‚Äôs a cap stash that spawns on the table in there too next to the wire shopping basket.
---
Go more on right. Or check my last post.
---
I have 3x Machine Set up but people most of the time check one and move on.
---
Not a bad idea but nah.... I came back to the game to have a look at this quest specifically, spent some atoms on the backpack skin (that I'd earned) but am gone again back to other stuff.
---
Thank frigging Christ. Those lists looked boring as hell to complete.
---
Looking into it now lol
---
You are not helpful.
---
Agreed. Grind dlc.
---
I‚Äôll sell you mine for 9k and then you made 9k...lol I don‚Äôt use it at all and it‚Äôs sitting in my stash...
---
Added back
---
Ok at least I‚Äôm not crazy. Too bad I‚Äôm also not repairing my armor.
---
Well musican don't work, that bullshit with crafting frog dont work, there are no deathclaw hides. Thanks god for this!

Actually Even whe  to you try to sell thing from you stash some Itmes are greyed out and says (listed in another Vendor Machine.)

Ahh the good old "If we are all winners no-one is a winner?" argument

I do agree it will just stick for new players that keep getting less of the good stuff over time
---
Either is posting misleading and or false information. Get the facts straight man banned accounts cant even log in and those who have thousands of items like that were banned.. Theres a max weight limit. Theres no possible way for you to trade with someone whos over max weight. And on top of it everyone already knows about how bad server instability is and everyone knows that when a heavy mule enters an area the area becomes unstable. Its a sad fact of the game due to haveing too much stuff nothing more nothing less.
---
That‚Äôs a glitch, it happens with steel and other items... I‚Äôve seen others post pics saying they didn‚Äôt dupe and they log out and it goes away.
---
How often do you get them, once every 3? Cause I did it twice and didn‚Äôt get a badge.
---
The pic shows a known glitch, I‚Äôve seen a few people mention this. If he had that many it would also set the weight limit off and he couldn‚Äôt sell.
---
Did one right after uploading and have another badge so 10events-4badges
---
I tend to prefer basic needs/functionality over pretty so I know how you feel looking at other players camps. Mine in particular looks like crap partially due to area I'm located in, but I like the area I'm in for map location and few enemies.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll run through some more tomorrow so I can get those backpack mods üòã
---
That is a visual bug, folk have reported on here they‚Äôve looked in their pip boy and they suddenly look like they have a mountain of stuff then they change server and it goes back to normal
---
I bought mine yesterday for 12k... In hindsight a good deal....
---
So with the bragging, screenshots, server instability, it was all coincidence/ glitch and all the controls are clearly operating effectively?
---
It's a heavy gun so it benefits from the heavy gunners perks and stabilized in power armor
---
Because the system doesn't really support proper item-item trading, and I was being naive. It was a mistake and I've learned from it. Still doesn't mean the system is where it needs to be.
---
Just because controls are in place doesn‚Äôt mean they are operating effectively. The need to retest them. Hi t isn‚Äôt working.
---
I'd want the components for such plans to be relative high. Maybe throw in some flux as a requirement. Wouldn't want the market flooded with unlimited chems and stims immediately. 
---
I only just started my chem pushing business!
---
Why is this such an issue to you? IF it is a visual glitch (High chance that it is) Bethseda will know that and ignore the report.
---
Honest mistake by Kodiak, if it's NOT a visual glitch, then there is another dupe method going about that needs to be stopped asap no?
---
Yes, it occurred to myself whilst I was at a player‚Äôs vendor
---
i put an open sign outside, and the machines inside.  people seem to be buying stuff and using my camp that way.
---
Yeah I lost some T-60 parts and was a little heated over it. An hour later I have new parts. Fuck the spawn rate of T-60 right legs...
---
I've found mine for sale at a players vender for 30 caps :)
---
Jesus Christ... and after they nerfed over repairing armor without so much as a line of notice in their patch notes? Wtf
---
Ah I see. Sounded like it was free fast travels.  But It allows more more points.  I have not played in over 3 months... I think since Patch 5?
---
Yes, it was the same when they nerfed back the xp gained from ghouls saying they were given boss-level xp.
---
Same when they fixed the electrical trap in the tower that gave unlimited xp.
---
Same when they fixed the item duping.
---
New players will actually get the game as it was intended now and not all the exploits.  They wont level to 60 in less than a week or wont have god-teir items freely available.  But I hope they have more fun and spend more time in the game than those that came before them.   They wont reach max nearly as fast or have the best items, but they will be able to play much longer before reaching "end-game" with nothing left to do.
---
As soon as someone purchases from me I check in to see how long them spent in my Camp!! I‚Äôm not impressed is they leave straight away - do they know how long I spent renovating?!!
---
Interesting title. üòè At least buy me a drink first OP.
---
Contested workshops are open pvp.

No you can‚Äôt, I tried last night. They don‚Äôt appear in the trade window and when you try to drop them a notification says it‚Äôll be destroyed

75 Mr fuzzy tokens, my mr fuzzy outfit is that little bit closer now lol
---
Everybody, right now, stand up, and start clapping, this, right here, is AWESOME!  
---
Thank You!
---
There has definitely been some significant improvements since then.
---
I had the ground glowing like crazy some times todsy first time I have seen anything like it
---
Cause reporting a person for absolutly no reason along with sending screen shots of said person in attempt to get them banned without fully knowing the consequences of their actions if they are completely wrong is absolute bs in my opinion. Knowing the facts has more power then being wrong a possibly ruining someones gaming experiance.
---
I think that I understand what they are doing.  The Serum sellers are selling the serums to the robot vendors for 500c each until they reach the cap limit for the day.  They then turn around and sell the extra serums for 250c at the Vendor Machine.  
---
Other players will then buy from them and sell to the robot vendors to make a quick 250c turnaround.  It's a really easy way for the buyers to also get their cap limit for the day, less grinding.  
---
This way the Serum seller is almost guaranteed to get a lot of extra income over and above the 1400 cap limit each day.  All they need is a lot of stable flux and they have a cash making machine.
---
I just got my first serum, Marsupial, since it's popular.  But if you follow the above strategy, then it doesn't matter which serum you sell.  It's just being used as a cash cow rather than to gain mutations.
---
Just make sure you sell them for more than what Vendors buy them for, stops people buying from you and selling them on.
---
This happened to me yesterday. Some of my junk was showing those absurd numbers when switching between junk list and component view.
---
It is possible this bug is causing instability though... Everything is in a database @ Bethesda, so if something tries to update it with a value which is out of defined range, stuff can crash if not handled properly in the code.
---
I read yesterday that the enclave is now selling the X01 plans on a permanent basis :) I haven't actually gone to check this out yet.
---
Either way I had a few customers last night who bought the jetpack lol
---
They have to be close to their camp, otherwise I don't think there's a way currently.
---
Quad Gauss for 300.
---
And to say honest mistske lol thay kid is straight attacking that person on a social page because of his firm stance on how hes a dupper...thats no mistake thats intent.
---
Only if the the owner of the camp is nearby.
---
Can you explain your situation properly please?
---
Did you kill the bear ?
---
I have both, whats your psn?
---
Every event seems to be getting worse.
---
At most 5%
---
Why? What‚Äôs the balance and thematic reason? Is the mod actually to take away resistance and the extra carry weight is just for more RadAway and rad-x?
---
LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
Problem with that is, usually I do look around someones camp to appreciate it first. With an emote or two to highlight this.

Then again most are locked :(
---
I know many, many who do not, so who knows.
---
TSE&gt;1* AA.  But AA&gt;TS.
---
I have a similar problem with my Gatling guns.
---
The one out front?
---
The event that lags and crashes and never appears. Great
---
I dropped by one players camp to check out their wares, though I ended up playing their tuba for five minutes while I checked on reddit.
---
Hopefully they didn't mind the one man brass band going at it out on their decking.
---
I was going to say the opposite that I get about 9-10 1* and 2-3 2* or 3* each time I swap servers
---
If this is a visual Glitch, Bethesda will KNOW. The player won't be banned, no harm done. There was no need for the full tirade that you've directed at Kodiak. A simple comment (like other posters did) advising that this is is mostly likely a visual glitch and nothing will come of it, was all you needed to say.
---
They have vending now that works well for a hands off approach... what would you suggest be improved?
---
Server hop at camp adams. I can do it 5times a hour....
---
Even if the market crashes, you'll still be able to sell  serums to the robot vendors, as long as Bethesda doesn't nerf the price.  Two weeks of selling serum just to the robot vendors will net you enough to buy the next recipie or just continue using the one recipe as a cash cow.   In addition, you won't have to do much grinding just to reach the cap limit each time you play.  You'll have more time to just have fun...
---
I'm like you, I just got the Marsupial recipe, my first serum recipe.  I listed the serum at 1000c just tonight figuring that it was below the Enclave pricing.  Guess I'll have to rethink my pricing strategy....
---
That's an integer overflow error. It will fix if you log out and log in again.
---
Mark spoiler?
---
Watching them every year at Christmas is still a tradition in my family, despite us all being full-grown adults. They never get old.
---
Considering the information that Kodiak had? "Millions" of Serums, bragging etc. It's a honest mistake, IF you did not know about the visual glitch.
---
If you DO know about the Visual glitch, then you're a dumbass.
---
Sanchez is right, didn‚Äôt happen
---
I actually play the game every single day and very much enjoy the game. I'm just being real. I'm thinking on the scale of legendaries they give us for survival challenges.
---
But I feel you, get angry I guess.
---
Yeah I just explored there for the first time. Please tell me mirelurk kings are the worst things in there. Because those things are nasty.
---
I love stupid CAMPs like the one I made for an alt. It's a Motell with six rooms for rent. Nobody is ever going to actually rent a room, but it's an in-world house that I thought Morgantown was missing. I love most non-floating monstrosities, and even some of those too.
---
Im not the one who snapped due to my comment lol. So try saying that to the op . who probably still contiunes to claim dupper even tho the facts have been laid out pretty clearly. So you continuing to make this a issue by futhering your point when this didnt need your input to begin with its def on you at this point lol
---
Pretty sure it can be completed in either mode. Another Beth oversight.
---
In what level is it relevant to start doing this? I just started playing.
---
For sure. You only need to look at the difference in upvotes between patch 9 and 8.5 to get a general feel on how people felt about repair kits.
---
In nuked? I would assume nuked would be the same 
---
But for 2 days now I've gotten hardly any  compared to what I used too
---
I'll give you a short list;
---
* General and personal abuse in chat
---
* Peurile comments
---
* Gold farmer spam
---
* Sales spam in the wrong channel
---
* LFG spam in the wrong channel
---
With voice turned of it's pristine...
---
Literally said how I'd like to see it improved in the OP. Both players should be able to select items/caps they want to put up for trade, then both players hit a big confirm button for the *whole* trade to go through. Right now it's piecemeal, which makes trading items for other items practically impossible. Have to use caps as an intermediary, which is annoying since people might not have a lot of caps, or might not have a reasonable idea of what a particular thing is worth in caps.
---
I had luck at other players camps, also if you are doing possum challenges, just check my last post.
---
Hot damn.  I put all the beer recipes @ 500 and they're selling like hotcakes, I imagine that seasonal/event recipes will sell in the thousands, easy.
---
I totally hear that.
---
Item for item trading which does not execute without both parties‚Äô approval.
---
Even with the buff to their ammo and and Class Freak fix for Grounded I still feel flamers/cryolators suck.
---
Didnt you crap it? You need all 5things turn back to robot, before scraping them.
---
Awesome, more impossible challenges, because that went over so well when they delayed the camera.
---
i get your frustration, i feel the same way.
---
i love the update, I also like the grind of the new quest, but damn F..k the test lol
---
SORRY I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE YELLING!
---
You're the GOAT
---
I did that, I finished that daily thing. It still says I have to finish bravery
---
Really enjoying watching other players swinging past my camp to shop out of my vending machine and being distracted and appreciating by my camp build.  Feels pretty good :)
---
Sadly I cannot help as not on PS4 but which events are you trying?
---
A suggestion, is to try the "A real blast" events. These usually are in small areas with cover incase your struggling and seem easy enough to do.
---
The 'Robots on parade' events I find may be harder since the area will be very open with little cover for you, so perhaps avoid these for a bit.
---
old man winter for 5 caps, im sure the person i got it from forgot a few 0s.
---
Does seem like no one cares but I spent 2 hours looking for the box pack to unlock it to then buy the skin only to relise the skin and pack are one and the same
---
Thanks for the info!
---
You will stumble across building plans while you explore West Virginia. It's a good feeling when you find the plans to something you've been really wanted for a while. Also, vendors that are found around the map sell plans too. 
---
You will find mods as you explore. They are yellow, rectangular boxes that are quite large. As well as finding them, you can also purchase them from vendors, as well as unlock them by scrapping weapons at a workbench. For example, if you have 2 hunting rifles, scrapping one gives you a chance (I think there is a certain percentage of a mod being unlocked depending on its rarity) of unlocking a mod for the same weapon you just scrapped. You will hear see a notification and hear a sound effect when this has happened. 
---
I've only stumbled across Mothman once - I'm fairly new myself - and he flew off straight into the sky before I even realised it was him!
---
I don‚Äôt think so about flamer Fuel
---
It's what you pick up. Can't be purchased or given by other players. Popped for me so it isn't bugged
---
Definitely. I'll be in my own world, adding furniture or crafting at a work bench. Suddenly I'll have someone waving at me.
---
Previously I could probably count the number of camp visitors on one hand. Now there is a couple every hour.
---
At this point I feel they need redesign the Gatling Gun to be a bit like the [Brass Beast](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Brass_Beast) from TF2 so that we won't need to deal with that huge magazine blocking our vision.
---
Is it in game? I didnt meet it yet.
---
I think this is the case because I got the gatling gun for claiming a workshop in adventure mode
---
[](/braaap)[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà](https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/dc1bb80d-e521-4fd2-978e-0b064790063c/svn/graceland-oak-pergo-laminate-wood-flooring-lf000883-64_1000.jpg)
---
Same here.
---
I click A on it and it does nothing.
---
Worth 40 crip
---
Yeah  they must be picked from world. I had problem with that too.
---
That's when Mr. Prizebot comes out from behind a bush and yells "Congratulations! You're the winner of an Appalachian stick-up!"
---
Psn is brm138. I‚Äôm usually on in the mornings
---
Had someone on Xbox lfg posting they were selling the dupe glitch thru PayPal today. Reported the post of course
---
[](/ce02)People are probably spawning in the room with the switch. The fast traveling into other peoples bases has you land at different locations than when the owner fast travels in.
---
having claimed a workshop makes you pvp once you enter the workshop area.
---
I don't think it's many at all, maybe 2 to 3%. I'm always talking to players in-game and the vast majority know nothing about Reddit
---
I had a run of 7 legendaries...
---
Four 3 stars
---
One 1 star 
---
And a the rest were 2 stars 
---
I think it‚Äôs back to the glory days of grinding
---
I think there are only - bacis, 2x pioneers and that one on atomic shop
---
So no refrigerator backpack yet???
---
Not sure mate
---
yep - a message appears when you claim that says "you are eligible for pvp. all they have to do is run in and contest ( pushing the same button you push when you go into build mode.) and they can unload that banked critical straight to your noggin. the good news is that they can no longer go to your workshop - contest it - then go across the map to where you're fighting the queen and shoot you in the ass. once you leave the area your no longer pvpable as of this last patch.
---
some rules I live by when claiming workshops.
---
1. sty under budget unless you have extra junk you need to burn - when you go into build mode in the shop all junk is listed in green when you go to build things. that means the workshop is paying for it. when the junk turns white it means its coming out of your personal junk stash. if you dont get ganked theres a also a chance of server disconnect. clearing the area usually pays for most of the cp cost, a little loot picked up can pay for the rest. if you keep it long enough to get a full batch of resources you have made profit, anything after is gravy. 
---
2. I try to never get so mad I come back more than once. no matter who you are - including the guys one shotting you. with current mechanics anyone can be one and two shot by anyone else if they are not stealthed. so the first time they kill me there's nothing I can do about it and its minus 220 caps. Then I usually try at least once to get my shop back. usually fail and lose another 200 caps. Then I log out and go to another server. losing your temper can quickly add up to a couple thousand caps if you keep "fighting the good fight." trust me they want you to be stubborn and keep coming back for more. 
---
3. the workshop is not a "hangout" build your defenses, defend, build your resource gathers, gtfo. the only time you're safe in a workshop is when you are stealthed. in my case my stealth sucks and I use power armor. that means I gtfo asap. 
---
I am level 220 with over 800 hours 400 of that has probably been in workshops. I am not good at pvp I am a power armor user and built for pve, I kill the occasional wannabe ganker if they suck but any pvpers of moderate skill and equipment usually take me out pretty easy. also I don't stealth, I keep my jump jets. I set my workshops up and keep moving. site to site event to event, I keep a timer and return every 24 to 30 minutes to gather resources, I get a lot of xp from the defends, I get a lot of caps from the resources, I stash my junk everytime I hit a resource node, I usualy put a stash box next to each gatherer. when you crouch you disappear off the map. I do that when I fast travel so I arrive crouched, I crouch when I am reloading, eating etc, when I am not being lazy. make sure you sleep and play music  in a locked room, keep at it pay attention to expenses and you can indeed profit very well off of workbenches.
---
still other camps up there. I,m pretty sure I know exactly where you were ( pond directly above you,with copper node at east end ? ). their still there so maybe its not location.
---
hmmm, I will have to check that, as I'm sure I've seen a few that have been walking along the road and then walked to the purifiers.
---
Is the place they spawn in constant? Or changes each time?
---
As it sort of defeats the object now of having an upstairs shop and a downstairs farm with brahmin that is locked to ensure no one steals stuff :(
---
I would have to say the TSE. It does more damage overall of course and it‚Äôs good for tagging enemies.  The only down fall of a TSE is the TS making it having low accuracy compare to one that does not have TS. When I‚Äôm firing my TSE in third person view I can see the bullets going way off my target but the closer you are to the target the better accuracy you can get. In vats it seem about average 2-3 shots before I actually hit my target (headshots)...with the perk concentrated fire and about 20-25 perception.
---
I bought like 30 from someone, damn it. Wasted caps.
---
According to game sites and youtubers, it‚Äôs 90%. It‚Äôs more like 2-7%. A majority of my friends don‚Äôt know what reddit even is.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous. Of all the places to take this game, it‚Äôs huge push is taking pictures. In Fallout. 
---
It‚Äôs also stupidly immersion breaking (if anyone cares). What is your character doing with all these pictures? There‚Äôs no social media in Fallout. You‚Äôre telling me the Overseer wanted us to waste our time taking pictures? 
---
What the hell ever happened to rebuilding? Just a dumb line they tossed out with no substance. 
---
This game is totally dysfunctional.
---
you can still send messages to ppl. go to social click on the person you want and then send message. it not an in game message but it will send him or her a xbox live message. 
---
i do it all the time spacially when I activate the free range event.
---
Thats mod, not skin. You must buy by possum badges. (Harder ones, check my last post how to get them fastest)
---
I slapped a Sheepsquatch to death for that Atomic Badge.... what do I win?
---
I thought this was the case. Thank you. 
---
Do we know if there will be alternate backpacks or will they be skins?
---
Instigating is fine for melee and low fire rate guns, but for high fire rate guns like the handmade, it‚Äôs not as useful once you land that first hit. AA works for me. Vampires is also fun on high fire rate guns (your health bar barely dips down) and a quad handmade combined with a drum mag is nice (damage isn‚Äôt boosted but I hardly ever have to reload)
---
From what i have seen atomic one is alternate backpack (but you need unlock basic one to be able to craft) and pioneers are just paintjobs
---
I seen a guy selling Faschnacht plans for 7025caps earlier...like, I don't even know...
---
What a bunch of bullshit
---
10%-20% mosy people are like WOT? when I talk about reddit.
---
[](/cehappy)I'm not sure if the location changes, but it can take it's time loading in the actual structure of a base, and until something loads in on your screen it doesn't affect where you can go, so people can easily stumble into locked areas while they mull around waiting for things to load.  
---
So there's not really anything you can do about people getting places you don't want them if they fast travel in.
---
They didn't need to include the 10% tax on sales.
---
We will all go broke fast traveling to everyones camps just to see them! "uuuuhhhh nice one! :P
---
r/lostredditors
---
I'm pretty pleased with my camp, set up by the Devil's Backbone along the road. Even managed to make a nice bridge to cross the broken bridge part, which luckily was right on the edge of my border. The view over the Bog is excellent, and it has plenty of water.
---
I see the word tribalism and I‚Äôm getting excited for something that probably won‚Äôt happen....
---
Maori themed stuff or primitive stuff...
---
Oh- is that what happened to me today?  I got confused b/c I thought I had accidentally logged into survival (and this was a mule alt carrying an absurd amount of aid- yikes)
---
Its a reference to a game called Colossal Cave Adventure. Its a texted base adventure game. At a certain point in that game you receive a message that says, "A hallow voice says 'plugh'." That's what those blocks spell.
---
i saw them yesterday in the Graton station a long with the BoS plans.
---
What the hell are you talking about, this patch is what we wanted?
---
Who signed up to fallout to take stupid pictures all day with a camera and complete long boring lists of objectives (a bunch of which can‚Äôt be completed) for a backpack?
---
What happened to fractions. Why are they jamming this goddamn camera down our throats and into every activity they give us. It SUCKS. 
---
When I played FO2 years ago, I never imagined we‚Äôd be sitting here, taking pictures of water parks for check marks.
---
Same here,
---
I tried to go back to  Fallout 4 recently, and something was off.
---
How much time until the game is truly finished?   
---
The UI is not great, the controls are bad (ridiculously bad with keyboard/mouse even), the housing keeps telling me to go f\*ck myself everytime I want to place a wall, we get soft-locked pretty often, and enemies shoot through walls (and especially through opaque windows, and WE CAN'T shoot through those). Also it's pretty ugly (compared to Fallout 4).  
---
Aside of that the progression feels nice, the whole S.P.E.C.I.A.L. cards things is an original system.   
---
While we were against Super Mutants, Ghouls, and Mirelurks, my friend (who really liked the previous Fallout games) told me "I feel more like fighting against the game itself than fighting against them". And I can't tell he's wrong.  
---
We'd really want to continue playing it, but the game is not ready yet.
---
Cool, that makes sense. I‚Äôm assuming the one I‚Äôm after will appear in the atomic shop eventually then. Thanks for the info!
---
Yea, I seen a few guys selling 1\* weapons for 5k and 3\* for max caps or near max...then others I see more reasonable prices. I picked up an AA Gauss Rifle today for 150 caps...1 star but still,  cheap.
---
I've also seen people selling serums for close to what MODUS sells them for and I've seeen multiple peiple selling the BoS Combat plans for anywhere between 600 and 3000 caps. Like, I just picked mine up today at Grafton Station for 300caps for all 3 of them (Legs, Arms and chest)
---
People are just insane....and I thought I was expensive selling deep pocket plans for 500 caps...
---
Clear communication, like with removing over repairing. Yeah they were totally up front about that.
---
My first run through post patch was way higher legendaries than usual. Since then it‚Äôs a mixed bag. Overall doesn‚Äôt feel that much different to me, except that 3* enemies in general have been giving me more 3* loot than I used to (I always had terrible luck getting 1* way too often)
---
Don't jump out the water or go on land otherwise it will say it's failed
---
I would really prefer for Beth to make shure all base weapons work as intended, have varied mods and are balanced.
---
Looking at guns like the SAA with it's complete lack of benefits vs. a normal .44 or the fact that explosive weapons just aren't very competitive at the moment.
---
now, if it was Instigating....oooh boy...
---
I think if there were flaming trees and more lava, people would change their minds
---
Close
---
Wouldn‚Äôt they just be able to tell by how many people bought it though?
---
bug fixes, mutations working, perk as well. BGS did fixed a few things on the new patch
---
Game Forumers and Redditors are very much the tiny minority of the player base, 2-7% sound about right.
---
Now that perk cards are sorted, the most dangerous thing in the wendigo cave is me ;)
---
Much love
---
91dmg resist is quite crazy imo for a backpack..
---
Just search it someone posts this every single day
---
Well if they don‚Äôt add some content besides cameras and challenge  lists it‚Äôs going nowhere. I love the base game (minus the horrific holotapes), the world, the enemies- but they‚Äôve added nothing of substance since they started. 
---
A crafting bench. 
---
A camera. 
---
A backpack. 
---
A couple of events. 
---
And whole lot of lists to get check marks for. 
---
Riveting.
---
I said "up to".  Worst case is you have to pay for the recall thingy (~2000 caps) every time and you only become a conduit once every time.
---
60 * 2,000 = 120,000
---
Very true unfortunately they are on platforms for the masses and are the most vocal.
---
Purified Water if you have a lot on you and cooked meals. Grenades and mines, chems and clothing usually fetch a pretty high price.
---
yup saw some on the field. looked like as if it was intigrated from Bethesda. high density and full of shit
---
but how am i, a noble gentle kind commie going to spread the word of our lord and savior General Jingwei?
---
Where? I read them twice and they said nothing.
---
Using this cheat sheet is the clearest proof you don't have the right stuff to be a Pioneer Scout.
---
But the Enclave will welcome you.
---
Exactly that what i said. 200% durability power armor pieces have the same amount of damage resistance, as a 100% one. For example a lvl 50 100% durability T-51 Chest has 115 114 65 DR. I have a 150% durability chest with the same stats. Before the update, you got additional resistance from overreapiring, but now its gone.
---
Because there will be maybe better tier backpack later i belive. Idk if that one from atom shop have same stats tho.
---
I‚Äôve literally only played it for an hour since the patch and I had more interaction with other players in that hour than when I‚Äôve been on for 3 or 4 hours before. I‚Äôve always been one of these people who wants to know who‚Äôs been hanging out at my camp and wants to leave a little thank you note and maybe a gift if I‚Äôve used another players camp. Please make this happen, Bethesda
---
Quickest way for the purifier is to capture a workshop once done it'll unlock a bunch of buildable schtuffs for your CAMP and workshops .. including the concrete base water purifier
---
Armor/Weapon mods you can get from scrapping armor and weapons or from finding the plans .. a good place to start for some plans is directly behind top of the world along the road there near the arena some of the wooden shacks there usually have plans lying on the tables.
---
The rumbles are underground earthquakes cause reasons.
---
Theres a couple of mothmen some hostile some not all easily escapable doe just throw one of them ninja knives at it and run
---
That lady one is one of a few you find laying about the world, another thing is posters, when you see posters(theme park, excavator power armor, scouts etc) stand in front of them and activate to get a quest
---
Tips - 
---
eat corn soup, take a lot of drugs, drink a lot of whiskey .. don't hold more than 50-100 resources in ur stash of shit you rarely use but store like 2-3k of steel, lead, plastic, ballistic fiber cause reasons.
---
mid-bottom left side of map silva homstead has a field of corn and a field of razorgrain .. after looting those run to the river to the west and you'll find a cookin station right next to the water .. easily cook soups and razorgrain flour here
---
trainstations have maps on the wall with pins on certain locations mouse over them and activate them to have a marker put on ur map .. also look for giant ranger stations which you can climb and activate the railing at the top for multiple locations at once
---
What console are you on? I‚Äôm on PS4 and my PSN is: CaptainModrah 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping you through the wasteland
---
Hope it is, I loved playing the game back in the day, had 3 characters even!
---
No there wasn‚Äôt anything you missed. They hope the issue gets buried under a slew of ‚Äúhelp me with the insanely grindy challenges‚Äù posts and you won‚Äôt notice that perks now offer no bonus over repair kits.
---
I see it maybe 10x a day lol.... i guess nobody knows how to use the search feature.....
---
I leave all five of mine unlocked cuz I have a dinky restaurant themed camp and water is free
---
My suggestion would be to take over the workshop in the north west of the map to get generator plans then set down a camp on a junk pile and put an extractor on top.
---
Don't think I'll bother. Can get better carry weight with a few pieces of unyielding armor.
---
That last part is a sentence fragment genius.
---
i can help if your on ps4 - PSN blaine\_anderson
---
I learned that CAMPs can actually be really close together on the map. I spawned in one time and there were 3 camps within a 1-2 cap FT radius.
---
sorry! :(
---
Scrap and pick up everything you see including shit weapons imo.
---
I should've specified, I'm on Xb1
---
Oh really? Gutted! Looks like I will be holding a mega cut-price sale on Phantom Devices then!
---
Now I‚Äôm wondering...does the food spoilage rate be the same if I was to take off the perk good with salt?
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôll be able to play next week however so I‚Äôll see you soon
---
Haha am i the Only one who has made a camp that says: Stay the F away! üòÇ
---
50-150caps.
---
It gives plans worth 100-10000 caps so....
---
treasure maps are pretty worthless so not a lot
---
try standing on the walk way under the bridge, it will only register if it says new river bridge in the top right of the camera
---
10 to max 20 caps, I will never buy anything above this.
---
I‚Äôm a console player and I DO NOT want to play with Pc players. There‚Äôs a whole different mentality. 
---
Besides, I doubt Bethesda could hack it anyway.
---
Ive noticed that when I first log into the actual game. It takes a bit for the base to build and I can stand in my farm to save running through. But ive not seen this happen after the first log in to the server. Unless is sort of cached for me?
---
Hmmm, well im going to have to have a rethink then for the base. Its a shame as I essentially had a drawbridge into the store with the neon Tibb's N' Chips above the door that I was very proud of.
---
But those letters pretty much destroyed my budget anyway lol. Since I need a couple of turrets since nastys spawn around the base
---
mine have been selling really fast @ 50 caps per
---
The backpack in the atomic shop is just a skin for a backpack, so I was told.
---
Carry weight mod gives 120carry weight. But -60er and -60rr
---
u work for a mod, a simple mod like that. Why does something like this need a drawback? Seriously.
---
Im on PS4 so i cant datamine sorry.
---
try killing all the insects that are in the two buildings not sure if the yao guai count as pests
---
AND PET HER. DONT MILK HER, PET HER. NAME IS BETTY. SHES A GODDAMN FINE BRAHMIN. TELL HER SHES BEAUTIFUL.
---
there is also one man army (stagger and cripple limb chance) under the Luck section
---
Yes you can, I did it
---
I was gonna buy Marsupial again today is someone had it, but I happened to get it during a SBQ fight, but I'll probably buy a couple more of it or others, if they're cheap enough....I like to experiment.
---
Oh hey at least some people got to inset their favorite youtuber into ES6 with a petition. Isn‚Äôt that just swell?
---
When I first heard about the refrigerator mod for backpacks I was happy that I can finally take down my good with salt perk and use those three slots for something better. I tend to gather and hold a lot of meat because for some reason I get more hungry than thirsty...it may have to do with the speed demon mutation that I got.
---
What's in Arktos Pharma?
---
I've used all mine myself but I rarely get anything worthwhile, can't imagine them being worth too much.
---
How about some content that doesn‚Äôt come from the end of a camera to keep the game alive
---
I've been trying to do a few PSAs about it but they are not getting a lot of upvotes. People want to keep making money off them haha
---
Don't feel overwhelmed, just go with the flow and enjoy it.  If players are coming up to you and you see a brown bag on the floor they are most probably trying to give you free stuff so don't run off, look in that bag!
---
It is not here yet, but if you look at the Wild Appalachia trailer you will notice it shows several underground locations (cleary not the Warren) that are shown with the Artkos Pharma logo on the walls in the background. Datamining suggests it is a group-dungeon, with an event that requires multiple people to do.
---
Not going to bother either, haven't really had a problem with food.  I'm going for the extra rad protection, cheaper too.
---
With grinding that event i will eventualy get to point where i will be selling those plans.
---
I've had a weird problem where it says my camp's full when I try and put more things in, then I'll come back later and it'll let me despite me changing nothing.  Anyone else had this?  Are the items in the sales terminal linked to build limit?
---
The H&amp;k G11 and Neostead shotgun were actually in previous Fallout titles. I think Bethesda was just got lazy after they made the new melee and heavy weapons.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about leveling up fast, if you just grind for levels you won‚Äôt experience fallout 76 for what it is and what is has to offer

Nice! I've also made a Motel. Mine's in Morgantown. At first I did an 8 unit, three foundations each room including bathroom, two story motel but my budget wasn't enough. I changed it into a 6 unit, four foundations/room, two story motel with a shop and small bar. I really wanted that exterior corridor with door-window-door-window look.
---
If you can find people to play with, them and their camps would be free fast travels and that will save you some caps
---
Erm no. There‚Äôs a reason people buy in bulk and spend thousands or even tens of thousands on them.
---
when you come out the vault,go pick up the pistol to your right,then STOP.backtrack, and go left,and round behind the vault.there's a little shack and a tent.lots of goodies to get you on the way. you will almost certainly come across some blue buckets with lazers,take them out with the bang bang,and find a melee [weapon. one](https://weapon.one) hit with a pitch fork will do = saves your ammo.after that, the tourist path is down from the vault. wot ever takes your fancy.
---
It depends. What is the prefix for the explosive 50 cal?
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Nah 50-100 is what they‚Äôve been going for on reddit and they sold quick. 20 is way too low.
---
I bought an unyielding/powered/sentinel chest for 24k. Ive made over 130k so far. I am more than willing to pay max caps for great items.
---
exterminator's
---
Yes all the English speakers who understand this just fine are illiterate and you, the guy who doesn't understand this, are the smart one.
---
Sure thing buddy!
---
What‚Äôs the toll, troll?
---
I don't think this would add anything to the game, except for everything being disliked because of the price
---
I didn‚Äôt call you illiterate, but if the shoe fits it throw it on asshole
---
I'm doing 50-75% of what vendors do 
---
I noticed everyone is pricing what vendors charge or more makes no sense to me if I'm not buying from them why will i buy from you. i know theirs a fee but oh well I wasn't going to use the item just sits in my stash box
---
Amno 1-3 caps per bullet
---
Stimpacks 15 caps
---
Radway 15 caps
---
Mutation serum 1000-1500
---
1-3 star weapons 250-500 caps
---
Fushion cores 115 caps
---
I would restock more often and focus on it but this backpack got me running around. 
---
I've made around 15k
---
Here are some youtube videos that kind of either try to fix the bug or explain / show the bug so you know more what I am talking about

It won‚Äôt matter people will just use vats anyway
---
I‚Äôd like to sit the developers down and force them to complete all the badges (minus the broken ones and ones requiring items that apparently don‚Äôt exist yet). I‚Äôd like to see how much fun they find completing those lists.
---
Honestly, the biggest bonus for me from player vending has been going from camp to camp like it's some daytime TV 'Selling Homes' episode and just being nosey about where people have built, what styles they use, what good ideas I can steal.
---
Post-Apocalyptic Sims FTW!
---
The action hero did 1 more damage per cullet than my zealots explosive .50. So it basically does the same damage per round but overall has 25% more DPS. That said, the accuracy is fucking disgusting. You can‚Äôt use it at long range and even at medium range you‚Äôll miss half of your shots. You could use it for the SBQ or in close combat but anything at a distance is a no no.
---
i don't even know how to trigger the challenge, could someone explain?
---
Ill be on in 3 or 4 hrs my friend and I can help
---
perfect balance, not if I can get one shot from a  mile away. play a few more days and you will get used too the new change.
---
I love you
---
Without perks, the TS is slightly better (by ~3.5%). With Demolition Expert 5, the Explosive is better (by ~9%)
---
It actually just keeps it to your previous answer, right or wrong. So its down to trial and error if you don't know the answer. Unless you use google.
---
Seems I still love this crappy game, last week i couldn‚Äôt enter penitentiary and today west-tek! Yeah, a good game! üôÑ
---
&gt;	Imagine the reviews for the game if it launched with this. 
---
If ‚Äúwe put it out in two years‚Äù was the difference between greenlighting or canning development, the alternatives were getting what we got, or getting nothing. Personally, I‚Äôm glad we got the game, rough launch or not.
---
I hope so I need to get me some backpack mods do you know what the easiest challenges are?
---
Yeah but for 30 pounds iy better be pretty high
---
For the heavy gunner perks it says for "mom explosive" my LMG has the explosive effect
---
Thats crazy aswell.
---
Just saying, somethings in the game right now have gotten +1 Damage resistance; it's probably a visual bug.  If it gets fixed, then it'll probably be 90.
---
Workshops are intended for PVP.  
---
All they need to do is prep themselves, line up your head and then click claim and BLAM!
---
Do not claim workshops if you do not wish to PVP.
---
Aren't all the models on a chessboard in one of the college houses lol
---
They drop rarely from that event, but I believe one possum token is always awarded from the bug collecting daily quest
---
Yup.  I got the impression from some other posts/comments that people were worrried about it being abused ... not sure in what way exactly, as you can always fast travel out of a locked room if needed.
---
Serums 250 caps 
---
Ammo 1-2 caps not more
---
based
---
Good thing they just slashed our armor rating so we can expect to take more damage from them. It‚Äôs a lame enemy and the damage they do is cheap and excessive.
---
Yeh that's what I got,the shotgun nerf is weird though says same damage but feels way weaker now I have a instagating tse pump action.
---
This let's us CAMP-building fans build more CAMPs without having to level yet another character and gather/buy all the needed plans.
---
I have a lvl 188, 64, 62 that have CAMPs I'm pleased with. Now I'm working on that lvl 22 getting high enough to have all the plans needed. They're not mules for legendaries. They're my CAMP-mules.
---
It is still counted as heavy weapon but also you can prop up the explosive damage with Demolition Expert.
---
Depending on the item I try to average reddit pricing and vendor pricing for example stimpaks are around 10 caps on reddit and 40ish in the vendors so I sell mine for 20. Weapons and armor is a little harder id try and look on reddit and discord to see what ppl are willing to pay and go from there. Or you can put a price check post
---
Took a few goes to work this out. Seen a psa about it now, which I‚Äôm glad. I‚Äôm terrible at writing things on lack of sleep. Hope they fix this. Happy hunting
---
PC but thanks for the offer mate:)
---
Can you tell me what autorun is?
---
Totally offtopic, but is this your camp? I'm pretty sure the owner of that camp had a very similar name to yours.
---
https://i.imgur.com/M3CFwm8.jpg
---
It's bloody amazing and it's by far the prettiest camp i've visited.
---
Meaning fat man, grenade launcher, the sort. Legendary effects are able to make your LMG explosive so it gets damage buffs from heavy gunner and demolition expert
---
Maybe to keep feature parity between SKUs? Text chat on console would be a pain in the ass.
---
You can choose your own price of course, but charging more than the game states it is worth is kinda scummy.
---
How will good legendaries ever become scrap? The meta may shift but good gear will never be worthless
---
Does over-repairing with a repair kit still give extra damage? Because if not, this comment is irrelevant.
---
Thanks, I'll try
---
You get badges from doing daily quests as well. The big collection one gives you one possum badge, and I‚Äôm fairly certain the toxic waste pick up gives you one tadpole token
---
Well played!
---
A friend had that but he just relogged and it came back.
---
Made 7k in 5 minutes yesterday off a bunch of bulk junk
---
berserker's weapon users say thank you?
---
FFXIV also has a textchat and is playable on PlayStation. It's not a reason to not have a text chat in my opinion
---
I was hopeful for two seconds
---
Ah I'll try that. Shame to loose my workshops though. There really should be a way to keep them and be able to reload the same server by choice
---
Is this a bug? I don‚Äôt see why that would be intentional right?
---
Ive found them after just this evening. I hope were talking the same thing. The green pods outside dyer chemical? Im on ps4 btw.
---
I was trying to explain someone by gesture to kill himself so I can revive him, he did but I wasn't able to revive him for unknown reason, the game don't want me to get a backpack...
---
Yay, no problem.
---
I'm not sure if it is because of the new patch or disabling SpeedStep but i didn't had any crash in a 2 hour play sessions! This looks promising! Thanks a lot, you're the best.  
---
Is it dangerous to leave SpeedStep disable while not playing?? (i.e everyday use)
---
Not sure if this would do anything at all, but has anyone tried hooking a terminal up with a vending machine to see if you can do anything there?
---
Ya now that u put it like that....
---
Quite a few of the possum badges are impossible to complete due to missing items or not being able to  trigger certain things.  You cannot compete musician due to most of the instruments not registering as being played even after 15 minutes.
---
Thanks man
---
What platform are you on. If PS4 I can show
---
Honestly, why does anything work the way it does this game? Every fix makes something else break. Just gotta roll with it.
---
Yes, that's mine! :D What a lovely coincidence to find someone on here who's also stumbled across my CAMP in-game, and I feel very honoured that you remembered my username!!  Thank you so very much for your kind words, though; it really means a lot! &lt;3
---
Did it to me about 4 times last night, it was only the furthest one out that was causing me issues, I ended up having to crouch down while approaching it so I could stay deep enough in the water.
---
Only get to play it once a week whats included in the update?
---
I swear the All Rise has some hidden damage buff.
---
They made it clear in the patch notes.
---
Get a bloodied automatic rifle, adrenal reaction, nerd rage and an unyielding set. You can down an 80 scorchbeast  in about 5 seconds by focus firing its head.
---
Full auto rifles use very little AP in VATS.  Unielding armor will boost your agility to 30+ giving you assloads of AP. This is the most OP build right now so it will probably be nerfed later...
---
Sixty times?!? Wtf man üòüüòí
---
Yeah, I hit my 25k cap today just selling excess plans and ammo. Bought a bunch of raider mod plans lol
---
Don't know if this would start the quest for it though, would it?
---
When you add something to the vendor it puts it in your stash, so you need the room in your stash. Stupid system but it is what it is. I‚Äôve also had it happen when my stash is not full but my build limit is, so I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a bug where it takes up build usage too.
---
Oh boy, bit too much for me to list comprehensively. [Here are the patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)
---
Player vending, legendary scrapping, new questline which seems  like it has a lot of activities, backpacks, fixes, nerfs &amp; buffs, mo atom store stuff.
---
You get a slideshow.
---
Add me gofukyurslf326 I'll be on in a few hours
---
I've killed a bunch of ghouls with my bloodied deep dish gamma gun :)
---
Yeh definately a bug. I think Devs know and are working on it
---
Conversely, for players who constantly trade on the trading subs here, 18k for a tse handmade (assuming its got a good 3rd star) is very reasonable, possibly even slightly undervalued.
---
What would be something you would consider worthwhile to do?
---
I had to be underneath it while pretty close to it for the name to show up in the camera hud
---
The world doesn't change, it doesn't even exist after the credits in FO:NV.  The only thing you can influence is a slideshow.
---
You have more effect on the world in FO4 (that's to say, almost none) than you do in FO:NV.
---
They are, its the house with the password for bivs storage room.
---
Yes! And parts of the Vault 88 build set from FO4 for us Vault-tec enthusiasts!
---
We all know to whom we owe our lives! Vault Tec! The saviour of humanity!
---
There's a building with 2 terminals on your right when you're facing the scout leader.
---
Thx but not this one, the practice one .
---
You spoken to the bot there to start the quest?
---
Yup, that would be a great way of building up a new community of pedophiles and daech agents in the game.
---
Yeah he told me to go collect goo and drop it in barrels and I found the barrels but not the goo
---
The punch bowl was probably a try out for the vending machine. They used it to find bugs in the non-owner interaction and transfering part.
---
It can depend on other factors. You can experiment with your setups [here](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
A hardened TSE is \~21% better than a hardened AA, assuming both bullets hit. A hardened Instigating is \~36% better than a TSE for the first hit but then \~63% worse than TSE.
---
I run with several handmades:
---
* *Exterminator's*, *Hunter's*, *Mutant slayer's*, *Troubleshooter's*, *Zealot's* against specific enemy types.
---
* *Furious* against Ghouls, landed Scorchbeasts and big frame enemies so that there is a low chance of misses resetting the bonus.
---
All drum magazine, suppressor, long scope, true components.
---
I had experience with other prefixes:
---
* *Quad*: only applies to the base ammo capacity, so Quad Drummed is only 145 rounds. May be worth making it a Quad Perforating for 80 rounds if you don't have AA.
---
* *Vampire's*: tradeoff between more damage output (see versus) and healing yourself. I used it when we had to keep the SBQ on the ground via a player staying in its melee range.
---
* *Executioner's*: I found it good against Ghouls and Robots until I found a Furious. Limbs seems to trigger the executioner's effect, thus can kill faster than a versus in some cases.
---
* *Anti-armor*: if you don't have a versus then it could be a good general purpose gun.
---
* *Two shot*: the second bullet may miss, you have to let the enemy relatively close and possibly no-VATS.
---
* *Nocturnal*: inconsistent and highly situational.
---
* *Junkie's, Medic's, Mutant's, Assassin's*: highly situational
---
To get into my camp I have a code for my garage door advertised on the outside of my camp in small numbers so that players can get in. To get back out I have a pressure plated electric door. Everything auto-closes.
---
I just dont want people to leave my door open for some ghoul or mutie to make their way inside and thrash my stuff while the turrets cant reach the bugger.
---
Good job ghouls and muties cant read numbers!
---
The time you spent to make this for the community of 76 players, well congrats
---
Ahhh, try reloading the game, that's helped me in the past when a quest marker hasn't shown. Or check your quest tabs in your pipboy to make sure it's active.
---
They don't.
---
It's essentially the same game, it's just a lot more stable now, less buggy and less server crashes. It has some new content too.
---
I did think this initially but there's likely a lot of people who may only purchase 1 or 2 items, but enjoy seeing it used by other players ie Rider PA skins, weapon paints or certain CAMP items. Shows players want more of that particular item. 
---
They will obviously continue to chase where the money at (and rightly so) but it could help them guage better what people want, as I expect a maximum of 25% of the game's population uses Reddit or the Beth' forums.
---
However even on Reddit I'm constantly seeing people calling out the wack stuff and pleading for more weapon skins or specific CAMP d√©cor. Personally I think we have more than enough paint for Power Armour but not nearly enough new looks for guns, as well as a lack of more serious apparel items that aren't overly wacky.
---
I sell my stuff based off how ive  traded on here, usually stick to 1‚òÜ= 100-500, 2‚òÜ=350-750, 3‚òÜ=850+. But it all depends on certain legendary rolls on weapons and i take level into account as well. Most armor isnt above 250. Plans i usually go at about half of the value it shows in the pipboy, same with aid and everything else. Serums stay at 200, All ammo (except FC and PC) are priced at 1 cap. It seems resonable and i constantly get to buy and sell without running out so its workin for me
---
I think its a patch problem coz all my friends are having the same problem
---
It‚Äôs def active and I‚Äôve restarted several times I‚Äôve watched a video on where the smudge is but it doesn‚Äôt show up for me I‚Äôm on ps4 playing adventure mode and level 15 if that helps
---
I agree. When you say 'recover' it could be taken several ways. One way that I see it recovering is from a financial standpoint for the studio. It took all this time until I finally reached a point where I would almost consider buying Atoms (but yeah, no). I have just enough to buy the 3rd horseman PA but I'll have to make up another ~1400 Atoms doing challenges. All told I've probably earned 8,000 plus Atoms. My point is, some of the content on the Atom Shop is reminding me of the Epic Games Store for Fortnite in that I could actually see people, in my opinion foolishly, spending upwards of $56 (1400 atoms X 4...assuming about 100 atoms per $1) just to get the matched set of the 4 horsemen PA.
---
And then you have somewhat tricky things like the Vendor Machine for 500 atoms or the KEEP OUT backpack for 500 atoms. When I first saw these my initial thought was "Oh, so I have to buy these before I can use them?" No, you access them by playing the game, these are just cosmetic 'upgrades.'
---
Why should anyone need to go to discord and beg others to help them complete a quest? I know plenty of gamers and they never bother with things like reddit or discord.
---
No it should be for the white spring resort's wall of safety from those nasty critters that gives the robots a hard time
---
He is there as I remember
---
Faaaaaaake
---
Thanks for your suggestion. The thing is, I love my shotguns and the nervous playstyle that goes with it. I could kill a level 80 Scorchbeat in 10-15 shots, and I was happy with it, I didn't need more power. Also I love being an unkillable tank.  
---
The only thing I can do now is remove some convenience and weight perks, and replace them with more ranks of the shotgunner perks; also rank up my Adrenaline perk. I have solutions, but choosing between them is hard.
---
Are they blaming stability on this again? Because STABILITY
---
You can sell money in the machines? Awesome! What do you sell the stimpacks for?
---
There is an archery range about 100 meters to the right of where you spawn.
---
Card games like caravan, black jack, or Texas hold ‚Äòem poker would be fun. 
---
Maybe a drinking game where you have to press a button at just the right time against an opponent and the winner gets a little buff, maybe the loser gets a slight debuff?
---
the shooting one? at the pioneer scout camp run west, pass the tower and keep going up the hill, you will see a archery range.  theres a button between 2 of the tables under the canopy to start it.
---
You DO realize that pretty much anything you encounter aside from players is an NPC right?
---
They are only for people who lost their cameras so they can fix and then use , I think
---
They have one in the Dev room.
---
Absolutely I'd love this sort of thing! It'd be a great little extra to the game.
---
I said limitations in other ways would be better
---
Fast travel to the pioneer camp and walk towards the vending machines, turn right and keep going past the showers ( they‚Äôll be on your left ) then up a little hill on the right it‚Äôs there
---
Dude, we are buying thing for 10x higher the market value, just so that we would hit the max cap limit. If you sold it for 25k, I would have bought it, even if I didn't need it. I would just bought it to sink my caps into something, because I sure don't have nothing to do with the caps.
---
As of this latest patch, that glitch appears to be gone :(
---
I used to have a carryweight of ~540 but now it's only 440...
---
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE MOO-MOO'S SINCE I BECAME A FILTHY PLAGUE-WALKER
---
In the most tedious fashion imaginable.
---
i've sold 2 TSE weapons 10k each.
---
Yea and nuke flora should take 2 high radiation fluids and 2 nuclear wast and 1 of the flora you want to grow and a rad mist spray to keep it alive
---
Thx, I found it !!
---
Yeah won‚Äôt happen.  They may sell a npc dlc for you but that‚Äôs as close as you‚Äôre getting.
---
Np :)
---
You're assuming that everybody plays the game the same way. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not everybody is into farming for legendaries, wants to do that for hours or days on end, but neither do others want to grind daily and weekly challenges intensely or whatever. Some folks will do a bit of each here and there and just not kick the arse out of such things by server hopping etc. It kind of becomes more of a chore rather than fun at least for me.
---
That said, it's a new feature. It's possible with performance streamlining or uptake of the feature plus feedback that changes will be implemented in the future to raise the limit of scrip?
---
Search before you post. You are only the 1 millionth twenty second person to ask the same question.
---
Mine kind of looks like a floating camp but it's accessible from the back. Although I've had several people come near the camp and walk away without using my vendor machine (which you have to sort of jump to get to). I should probably rethink my setup... :-/
---
I'm currently holding the tourist body until 11am GMT for anyone who needs it.
---
But ill join you afterwards
---
Not gonna lie, it was strong and felt awesome using it
---
They don't exist yet.  They, apparently, will be a way of sharing the effects of a stimpack with nearby players.
---
one is a daily quest reminder, and the other alerts you to new quests I believe
---
Wish I could help. There's actually a pretty cool animation for people who need reviving underwater.
---
I did this something like ten times for my main character. The stairs have been improved on since then though. Back then I stored everything including all floors and walls and with only a few foundations the stairs were still reserved. Also some of my wiring had to be made before placing the stairs and then carpets had to be placed before the rest could be placed.
---
I will, because you can get power armor plans that will sell for 2k caps easily.
---
Yeah, I've been experiencing quote a few bugs that seem to be server related. One annoying one is that sometimes when I go to fast travel it just won't do it (and no, it's not because of enemies or being overencumbered).
---
Bought mine for about 1k in the good old duping days. Still have.
---
Do you know how much rad protection it gives?
---
You make a good point but you're not exactly being friendly about it.
---
I dont get it. the 308 is available to you within 2min of leaving the vault.they are a peice of piss to craft and mod and still one of the best general purpose weapons in the game. A 50. cal version of this,is really hard to find,unless your supremely lucky.both are extremely accurate and the 50. is only now 10 points higher. the 308 remains absolutly deadly.
---
Yeah thats why it is better to grind this event.
---
Oh you're right, didn't take that into consideration.
---
So does this mean unyielding sent is the best to go with now, since you get high damage and everyone dies easily anyways?
---
Nah, we need to move on from the .308 plus the .50 cal bullet makes sense to have more damage. Since, you know...it's a bigger bullet. I get what you mean but this just makes the search for the plan and the upgrade more rewarding.
---
Typos do not make it suddenly not a word.
---
Yeah, I found some interesting looking 3 star items but I walked away because I couldn't inspect them.
---
Who says you have to? If you want to make your life harder sure... Go survival mode, kill someone and revive them. Tell inside the game, that you wanna revive them. Start event and hope someone dies and revive them. I am just saying, it is very simple quest, if you aren't neanderthal.
---
Definitely not working for me either on XBOX.  Have done everything over and over again not checking off.
---
Up voted for viability.
---
I made a Hitler
---
Waterboarding did become quite  dried up since the bombs dropped years ago 
---
Good luck interrogating the culprit with water i dont think that the culprit will spill the truth where they took your water
---
If anything Power Armor is underpowered in the endgame. The lack of legendary effects makes it ridiculously easy to one shot kill these "walking tanks". Which is a sad thing for Enclave fanboys (like myself) since our faction has no legendary versions of anything.
---
* Our scout armor doesnt have legendary versions.
---
* Our Power Armor doesnt have legendary versions.
---
* Our Weapons don't have legendary versions (enclave plasma).
---
For being basically the only faction with any working infrastructure left, that is depressing. There isn't even a skin for the Power Armor, even though they're the only faction that could still construct them.  
---
Playing as an Enclave trooper basically means I'm setting myself up to get one shotted, in no small part thanks to the deficiency inherent in Power Armor in FO76.
---
I ended up triggering the Encrypted event.  And nobody came.
---
They won't, you need the bucketlist from the dead tourist. But I wanted to make a PSA for all those that accidentally scrapped their camera alerting them that the broken cameras are now all over the place. They also drop from ghouls in Whitespring. I already fixed three more to either keep them in stash or sell them to other players for zero caps.
---
I think the broken ones auto scrap with &lt;scrap all&gt;, though, so craft your cameras ASAP.
---
that would require a more realistic representation of ammunition weight then everyone would raise heck about carry weight . thinking of the weight to enemy casualty ratio 5.56 &gt; 7.62 &gt; .50 
---
there's reasons every soldier didn't walk around with a .50 cal in ww2 but if bethesda got to realistic with it peeps would rage :P
---
Whereas we computer nerds were triggered by the question in the "codebreakers" exam where Bethesda swapped "&lt;" and "&gt;".
---
Tooting my own horn: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/bmhc09/an_insight_into_programming_in_the_fallout/
---
Apparently the CAMP loads in later in the arriving cycle and that would mean that if the mat was placed high up in the CAMP you would fall before the floors are being loaded in.
---
I still wish they would make either of two changes. First, if you are in a foundation, below the floor, push that player up out of the foundation! This is even worse for the wooden foundations as they trap the player inside. Second, let us place a fast travel point on the ground anywhere in the CAMP building area. I would be happy to let people spawn outside my house.
---
2 or 3*? I‚Äôve got one and yea it‚Äôs okay but that price bewilders me, I thought with the nerf a few patches ago they weren‚Äôt so viable?
---
I found your spreadsheet and put the link in the description of my video giving you full credit. I just wanted to say thank you especially on behalf of my viewers who will benefit greatly from your post.
---
Here is the link to the video- If you have any issue or would like me to change anything about the credit please let me know.

Again, Thank you!

Where are you on the map?
---
I've been thinking a lot about this as well.  This is definitely the first time since I started playing that the 'rebuilding America' tag actually meant something.  It makes sense, when you think about it.
---
A group of people living together isn't necessarily a community.  I never felt like I should be going into people's camps before, because they were still private spaces--literally another player's home.  I went to a great effort to combat this with the design of my own camp, with 'all welcome to use' signs up and an open-plan space full of useful things.  I based myself in and around Flatwoods because it's somewhat of a hub, one of the first proper towns new players arrive at.  So very occasionally I'd get someone wandering in and having a peek at how I've designed things, then using the crafting benches or the stash.
---
But with player vending, suddenly it's taken on a whole new meaning.  I've gone to even greater lengths to invite people in, big neon signs and everything.  I've resurrected the name I gave to a Fallout 4 settlement - The Bar at the End of the World - to encourage that sort of atmosphere.  And having camps marked on the map suddenly has been brilliant.
---
Suddenly it's a community, and people are communicating lol.  All everyone needed was an excuse, because lets face it--we're all curious at how other people express themselves.
---
Well done that guy this is what the game should be about always.
---
It wasn‚Äôt? It‚Äôs an expansion upon the game with new content, and it‚Äôs downloadable.
---
At the miners monument.
---
I should have said in OP but i got excited haha
---
Reviving a player is not a quest. It‚Äôs a list check mark, a quest substitute. Reviving a player and repairing a crossbow is not content. 
---
Screw you and your snide comment.
---
They don't autoscrap they go under the Misc tab in the pipboy so there's no chance of scrapping them.
---
I'm running g around like a madman this week so far.
---
My experience is that moving the CAMP thing around changes where the owner spawns but not where visitors spawn. They appear to spawn in the spot I put the device when placing the CAMP in the first place. It's a pity since most will build their structure in the middle and that makes players spawn in their inner sanctums or locked generator rooms.
---
Yes! This is the newest QoL request for another thing that should be made the correct way from the start but wasn't
---
you already bought it.. wtf are you asking strangers in a forum about a game you already own when you can see for yourself. you make no sense to me.
---
My experience too.
---
I believe that you do need the Pro-Snap.
---
As when you aim down the lense it tells you the name of the subject in frame.
---
Im currently at the tourist if your on Xbox.
---
You mean the part where they reintroduced server hopping, made it into new gameplay and that not only for vending but also for quests? And then you sit behind loading screen one after another. Or the sh#tty UI/UX where you have inspect option that doesn't work when you need it to work instead of having weapons effect displayed as list, like the first effect is being showed, when hovering/selecting weapon. Or the amazing bug, that unlist all you 120 items from vending machines. Or the sh#tty challenge tracker, that is complitly useless for new challenges.
---
Wait we have to revive a FRIEND? Not just a random person?! I was hoping I‚Äôd get away with just reviving some random person and be on my merry way.
---
What are you, some kind of commie?  You want a planned economy or what?
---
Alternatively:
---
Yes, a price cartel!  Fits in perfectly with the Fallout world.
---
Sure. Send me a friend request? Then we can bang it out in Willard Wiley‚Äôs right fast :)
---
Only problem is, things like poker and such can probally be used to just let other players win and give them lots of caps and kind of breaking the game.
---
But it would be fun
---
thanks mate
---
I bet you're fun at parties.
---
Uh, did you notice his flair?  What do you expect him to do.
---
My favourite part is that for both the Camera and Backpack they released news ATOM store skins. I mean, besides the fact that both of them are awkward to acquire, before anyone had one you already have customisation options, is that entirely necessary? Makes me a little salty, I'm still waiting on the Handmade skins that were patched in to the game nearly two months ago...
---
"on reddit" 
---
seems to be a very where are you selling and what system thing.  by reddit standards my price of 30 is to low.  by xbox lfg standards im sitting at double the going rate.  even after advertising in xbox lfg my maps have sat there all day
---
Just an ally so a random person is fine.
---
Oh, it'll kill them if you have an automatic deep dish receiver on it. The trick is to just give em bursts of health. Don't out pace their regen with damage.
---
And failing miserably.
---
It mostly just makes us who's thrying to build nice immersive CAMPs scream with frustration.
---
The others just place their single foundation, place a stair and perhaps a second on top that lead up to their box filled with only workbenches, some instruments and a bed.
---
Ah. Well, the grinds begin. And I'm on PC. I'll just start my server hopping
---
I just went to the encryptid event and waited til someone was downed in the water in the middle of the fight. Revived them and got the swimming one and the basic revive completed.
---
I'm sticking to my guns with the shotgun stuff.  I love them, I collect them, just try playing around with a bunch of them, my Quad explosive still shreds, and non explosive ones seem to be doing well too.
---
As soon as you have the means to get enough lead .308 becomes completely useless since you can craft tons of .50 while .308 still remains relatively rare in high level areas (West Tek for example, you can get a lot of 5.56 but I have like 200 .308 after a week of grinding it).
---
Meanwhile the .50 is also better in every way now.
---
I remember when I played, shortly after release. It was always a "SHOOO! GET OUTTA HERE!" situation when someone was near my camp
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call what was a normal use of perk a weird trick.
---
XD before raising the dmg value of the 50 cal, a lot of people wanted to "make the 50 cal great again"
---
So, no matter which bullet they adjust, ppl want the other one? I don't get it
---
Yeah. I've felt that way before. Never quite sure if they wanted to use a workbench or wreck up the place.
---
Ah, ok, didn't notice that. Another item to check when you're overencumbered then, right? I guess they won't also be weightless. ;-)
---
I get what ur saying but not everone can use a search function....
---
Actually they have a weight of 0 hahaha
---
found my 50. around level 30 ish. although the stats were lower, it just seemed to do more damage and was fitted with recon, loved it,still do. but , 500 odd hours in, I have still not found the 50, reciever mod or plans. had to buy a high level one from a w/springs vendor,cost a bomb,and i've only seen it once. never leave home without it. Bigger bullet ? , well shit you would like to think so, a [50.cal](https://50.cal)  should be awesome, but we do find that the mechanics does'nt behave as anything real world.
---
still..... the 308's effectivness at extreme range........ havn't found anything  that comes close. still use both. The 50 is now 149 for me,138 for the 308,not much in it.
---
cheers.
---
I think they should make traveling cheaper if you're traveling to someone's camp
---
Cool. So it's impossible to do all the scout tasks currently.
---
As posted above, the action hero is somewhat of "stick in your face" weapon...to that end, it's fun ^^
---
Fully credit Chisato from the Captainoob discord server.
---
Hmm that would be a challenge, it's a good point and I'm glad you brought it up. But honestly people can do the same in trade can they not?
---
Poker games could be capped to like a 50 cap pot or something. But blackjack on a machine or with a protectron dealer would be pretty cool and reasonable.
---
That'd be great, yeah.
---
Thank god
---
Not to mention the guys who give them out for free.
---
Thank you. Have a nice day, member.
---
Lmao
---
Lets welcome the crazy Brahmin Lady
---
Make sure you have normal stimpak, it won't work with super or diluted. We had this issue last night.
---
And why did they remove the side snapping points? I would build my own version of that stupid, always interfering, stair-with-floor. I would love to have the smaller floors to have the atom shop skins too. That would make it so much easier to build great camps. And please let us have walls with half the width. I would finally be able to make appropriately sized toilets.
---
It was ALWAYS to smash a hole in my fuckin' walls, they wouldn't even come in through said hole, just walked off. I assume they wanted me to try fight them for the bounty so they could kill me.
---
You're an NPC in my version of Fallout 76.
---
totally gonna use this but wish it wasn't one giant vertical list
---
They should still leave 50 cal at higher damage than 308 like it is now, just make the latter easier to craft so that it becomes a viable choice.
---
Bless you!
---
Some people want to go pure stealth to be the ultimate glass cannon, others don't like stealth and want to maximize on VATS efficiency or bring in secondary weapon perks. 
---
I did say OP could choose to specialize in one, or do a little of both. I personally think that's the way to go, I've never been a min/maxer
---
I am not buying much (some crazy high prices out there) but every time I log in a find a few camps to visit.
---
You can start the quest at any level by reading the posters placed at train stations.
---
&gt;Corrected a Weekly Challenge timer that would have outlasted the inevitable heat death of our universe.
---
wat
---
You received a working piece of software.  Millions of people logged in and enjoyed the game for tens if not hundreds, of millions of hours.
---
Was the game perfect?  Absolutely not.  
---
Is the franchise going in the direction I'd like to see?  Not really.  
---
But Bethesda did deliver a functional game that continues to get better as they iterate have a larger test pool  (aka us).  
---
We have the choice to embrace this modern iterative process or go without.  I recommend embrace.  
---
Why? To do otherwise potentially removes the profit motive, the motive to take risks and innovate, and we can logically expect highly profitable but low cost games live Fall-out Vault 2.
---
Damage is perfectly fine imo now, they just need to make the .308 easier to craft since the .50 cal is arguably the easiest one in the game rn.
---
How long is a piece of string?
---
up voted cause this is the best gun in the game and any updates to it would be a privilege to any dev doin the work
---
also add regular raider armor plans to the raider vendor pl0x or make em more widely available
---
I don't need to be friendly about everything, princess. ;-) I usually am, and I'm still helpful here giving you a heads-up so you don't start to wonder why you don't get a 1000 word review of the new features in response to your question.
---
Like others have posted before, we do need a sticky post that highlights the major changes and links to the [patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news) and stuff. You're welcome back, by the way. ;-)
---
It's just not for living.
---
I mean it's hard relaxing in the yard, having a nice lemonade, watching Beth the Brahmin while wearing a gas mask all day long.
---
Maybe we're just spoiled after all these years in the vault
---
Or balancing via weight, accuracy, crit modifier or sth similar?
---
Server hop at Wavy Willard‚Äôs. He will be lying against a car right in front of where you spawn in.
---
I would think that a community of people who actively play the game would be the right place to ask...
---
I do agree that there are days where these kinds of posts seem to crop up a little to often and do not ask anything that has not been answered recently on another post of the same kind but... conversely the OPs often get a fair bit of flak so everyone that thinks has something to add to the conversation one way or anothet gets to say their piece.
---
I haven't seen the mods remove any 'ranty' or derisive comments from those posts that added as little as the posts themselves due to that very reason either.
---
Me neither lol
---
Yep. I took a break from FO76 for a few months, and came back to see if they'd fixed the issues with not being able to sink camp structures into the earth. Guess I'll be back in another few months.
---
Easy! I never use Blueprints. If I ever move my CAMPs I always rebuild them from scratch to make them fit perfectly at the new place. I don't believe in any fit-anywhere house. They never properly fit in with the surroundings anywhere.
---
awsome will try that thanks dude
---
Look in tourist attractions for a named corpse. I found one at the Phillipi Battlefield and also at the Fairgrounds.  I have heard that on also spawns at the main entrance of the Whitespring.
---
So that's why those damn turrets were so annoying.
---
Haha, ok, this gets better and better. Can pick up and amass them without regret then, and just craft them when I've got resources to burn...
---
Focusing on sneak will get you the most damage via sneak attacks, however sneak attacks won't help you as much when you're ambushed by a group or fighting a big armored target. I would recommend doing a bit of both. Concentrated fire, gun Fu and adrenaline are great for dealing with crowds and you're downing one target in vats then jumping to another.
---
Covert ops gives you your raw sneak attack multiplier, and I forgot to mention before but pick up escape artist under agility as well! It's a must have for me, it makes it so when you're spotted you can run away, crouch, and the enemy will lose sight of you.
---
Thank you thats kind, i got it through yt already :)
---
And by the way... The hold-E (PC) and move everything in FO4 worked much better than the blueprints in FO76.
---
I can only vouch for the single round rifle, [50.cal](https://50.cal) rounds easy to make but hard to find. I play both as snipers and as such, both have a place. I don't require a lot of ammo for either since they are standoff.
---
5.56 or 45 burn a hole in my pocket
---
I get that, but just scroll down the subreddit for 5 minutes and you'll see the exact same question. That tells me they haven't done even the most basic of searching before jumping on and asking.
---
The vid sucks .
---
Or it‚Äôs cause you just got a dickload of new content and some of its buggy, so Bethesda is taking servers down today to fix it
---
Is there still no text chat in this game?
---
I just walked in to a level 12 camp selling legendaries.  Nothing less then 5k  not buying.  They also had 20 spiked boards everywhere so maybe he wasn't really into selling anything.
---
I only have 12k caps and I play mostly everyday since November!
---
But did you already have one?
---
I think it's possible that the update will facilitate the neighborhoods people are calling for. I'm assuming it's more about actually noticing someone is nearby, now, but it certainly is noticable that I'm noticing more player homes nearby my own!
---
probably exploited caps anyway lol
---
Its nice to hear that they will take servers down to fix it!
---
There was two bugs with explosive shotguns. First the explosive effects were doing 100% damage when it is meant to do 20%, and second tooltip had error that was showing wrong damage. Both should be fixed now. Atleast in theory sice its Bethesda.
---
Hey man no need to be rude and call me that. Was just saying you can phrase things differently so that the message can be taken better. But I suppose I should expect as much being in the internet and all. Either way, take care.
---
Yes it was causing me issues when trying to hit them with my baton.
---
Well in MMOs you can also often have only around 10-20 people in a zone, so it pretty much feels the same when there is no big event that lures people from all the zones to one place.
---
I think it was unintended. Is anyone complaining though? ;)
---
18k? I'd pay 25k. Finlly something to spend money on.
---
Kidding right ? Mutation serums for 1000-1500 each!?  Greedy bastard üòÇ
---
Do you have adrenaline and/or adrenal reaction when you see this number?
---
Didn't read in Beth forum today, so is the maintenance confirmed?
---
I too am on the fence with this one as well, I had it. it felt like it procced so rarely I would be better off with higher endurance or something. when it did proc it was amazing, I specced out of it and actually shifted points out of luck. Saw a video on you tube concerning the lucky break perk. I use a laser gat and he mentioned to get lucky break to proc you had to stop shooting and it was x% every trigger pull. sooooooooo now I have to level up 1 or two more times to get my luck back up and retry it using shorter bursts. with a gatling gun the first time I thought 12% would be a cripple every 12 or 50 at least but I always just hammered down the whole time. maybe if I stagger the bursts a bit i can get more cripples im going to try burting repositioning bursting etc and see if i can get it to proc more often.
---
Me too.
---
I was able to finally get my hand on a TSE shotgun about a couple days before they made an announcement they'll fix the shotgun Nerf bug lol I was having a great time with it last week but man, wish I could have enjoy it a little more
---
Only if it is a setting, as I have my doors set to lock, but when my shop is open I leave the front door open so people can enter. I don't want it closing and blocking them.
---
Though I suppose I could just unlock that one door.
---
It's a known bug. You can complete the challenge in adventure mode. Did it myself as well.
---
Well you gotta post pics.
---
They might be hard to find, i'm not going to deny that, but when you can craft about 1000 of them with around 60 lead, something that your extractor can do in about 2 hours (That's without even counting Super Duper), them being rare is not that big of a problem.
---
Honestly i wonder if its this, and lots of people bringing out mule characters recently to sell everything at vendors. 
---
I have nothing to base this on except speculation, in regards to the server crashing. However, ive run into MANY people with multiple vendors, who are also trading with their character thats completely loaded to the max with weapons and armor etc
---
Why would anyone in this community say the game isn‚Äôt worth playing.... obviously we play it semi regularly or we wouldn‚Äôt follow a reddit page about it. Is it too much for someone to just click play and test it out themselves
---
I'd need someone to revive too (i don't use mic). I can help in return if needed
---
I found him at the miners monument. 
---
Lying on the stairs right next to the monument. Took me 3 server hops
---
That's a lot to ask though. I'm already trying my hardest when I read an entire post before I make my response, you really think I have the patience to scroll and read for longer than 5 seconds?
---
IMHO were all at that point. Its the start of the free market in game. Price it what ud pay for it and if it dont sell after a couple days either reduce price or put other stuff in. It just all depends on who wants what and what there willing to pay.
---
Ya I think it‚Äôs like 11 or 9 am eastern time
---
for anyone having this specific problem, what fixed it for me was changing the type of foundation back and forth until finally one piece would allow itself to be stored. i had to keep doing this for a few more pieces of foundation before i finally could store all of them.
---
I found him after 3 server hops at the miners monument.
---
He was lying right on the stairs by the monument
---
Eh, that‚Äôs not all this patch was. A lot more than just pioneer scours was added.
---
At the highest rank its a 12% chance to cripple a limb. So round down to 10% for arguments sake. So 1 out of every 10 shots, 10 in every 100 will cripple a limb. But is that shots that land on limbs or in general? ü§î
---
Reason for that question is that if it's shots that land on limbs, then given the nature of heavy weapons which are not terribly accurate but lay down a hail of fire and have perk cards to improve that, then perhaps you may get more out of that by supplementing with other heavy weapons perks if you don't do so already?
---
Something that actually has to do with Fallout, the wasteland, not some silly pioneer scout and tadpole crap. I understand it's fun for a lot of people, and that is fine, but it's not what I expect in a Fallout game.
---
resoloute veteran earned it on accident myself. I dunno what the challenge even was haha.
---
I'm fine with this if the 60 euro full game release costed me half the price, and called it an early access. I'm too burned out and traumatic experience of crashing and losing ammo and progression that I just cant get back to the game.
---
I have no idea about that but Im pretty sure  I saw some people who are definitely using Dupe Glitch to Dupe Good Items in recent 2~3days
---
Eh, still kind of pointless once you reach a certain level, I can do around 1500 Stealth damage with my BE Hunting Rifle (And i'm not even fully perked yet), having a bit more damage in critical would be useless in 99% of situations.
---
I heard there and Mothman Statue are good server hop spots
---
Oh my, how many &lt;wink&gt; smileys do I need to put in before you read my sarcasm? ;-) You immediately downvoting my posts won't make me (and others) more susceptible to help you out, though. Bye.
---
Funnily enough, that's what we do. We only really play together and I use it and share that. I saw it and was like "Huh that'd help."
---
Back when I was lv 15 or so I had a couple come visit my camp and politely laugh at my ingenutity. ( I haven't played video games or fallout since the first one like 10 years ago).  They helped me out built a ginormous generator hooked it all up and even planted some corn with some scare crows in the mix. Then they took me to there camps. Both of which were lv 150+ I couldn't believe the ability this game gives you it was fun looking around his trap base and a concrete bunker then hers, a quite mountain top villa compete with working shower and and a king size bed. 
---
I got excited after this online encounter and started pouring lots of hours into the game only to have a$$#‚Ç¨‚Ç¨!!‚Ç¨$ come and rip my cardboard shanty apart time and time again...... I persevered. .......At lv 59 now it's rare for someone to brave all the defensive measures I started adapting and I was enjoying my scenic camp. I loved watching my tourets rotating about just drooling for another a$$#‚Ç¨!!‚Ç¨ to try some drunk in public behavior and send them limping away shooting up stimpacks and medx.
---
Those days are gone now and I've dismantled 80% of my defence to make more building space as the camps are immune after our illustrious update. I'm excited to rebuild with freedom but I think the game lost a very enjoyable asspect as well.  
---
During the time of my home invasions I'd always rebuild with the thought of a newb visiting my base and finding the unlocked purifiers, work benches and complimentary crops to harvest and enjoyment. Now I don't feel my kindness will be so awesome as the update has turned all bases into freedom land. üôÑ... 
---
I haven't been online much after the update but I'm excited to see all the creativity so .... I just hope Bethesda finds away ( of course after fixing all the bugs that disconnect me from the server every 45 minutes) to re- introduce the fun of building your camp defensively.   ........... After fixing the bugs...... After fixing the errors.  Of course they should fix problems before creating new ones.  I mean after FIXING THE GAME TO RUN SMOOTH. maybe we can get some more twists AFTER THEY FIX THE GLITCHES THAT ERASE HOURS OF WORK AND  RESOURCES.     OF COURSE AFTER THAT.... Bethesda
---
That's fair. I cannot blame you. I got my copy for ¬£13 recently. Definitely wouldn't have spent more and I've had my share of issues. Just felt like highlighting it feels like we've actually hit Fallout 76 version 1.0.
---
We're basically out of early access now. ü§£
---
Yeah im sure. I know this still happens
---
I will pass. I will continue to price items as I see fit. Your pricing structure is very naive in consideration of what effects are worth what value. You are going to laughingly sell a 1* bloodied handmade for 200 caps when it is worth 6-10k.
---
I will also buy all of your Bloodied explosive weapons for less than 1k and then sell them for their actually price (which is 25k-75k caps).
---
Not useful other than killing SBQueen/Imposter Sassy/Real Sassy (enemies with huge healthpools. Chance to proc is too low for anything else. I switch to it when fighting mobs like that.
---
The game has never felt so populated, it's pretty great.
---
I want this.
---
Elder Brotherhood here. I approve, need to stop these commie bots.
---
Ok well shizz i thought i could sell it cause i won the wasteland lottery. Lol
---
Seconded. It's about time the 10mm SMG gets some love.
---
1) No. [Here are the datamined numbers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blsib1/datamined_legendary_sell_curve_tables/).
---
2) I don't have experience with this but there were posts indicating other players can still kill your animals.
---
3) Yes.
---
7) You can't learn item plans from scrapping items, only mods. You have to find item plans or buy them from vendors. In addition, some mods can't be learned and you have to find/buy plans for them too. There is complicated and randomized element on which new mod you end up learning with and how often, the more mods you know the less likely you learn something new.
---
9) In theory, yes. In practice, you don't get the benefit for black powder weapons unless [they glitch out](https://youtu.be/l31Hlrg-dv4).
---
12) [Yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa_which_enemies_are_affected_by_versus/)
---
13) Probably yes.
---
I've always modded my Bethesda games for lonely survival gameplay and have never seen the quests in them as anything special compared to other RPGs.
---
So for me F76 is everything I loved about the other games. Superb environmental storytelling in a very open sandboxy world, plus a very complex survival/durability/sickness system I would normally need like 20 mods to create for my game. It's the perfect game for me and probably the most immersive online game I have ever played. 
---
Obviously at the same time it's an unoptimized, buggy, ugly mess. But I guess you can't have everything. It helps that I treat it like a MMO where the launches were often much much worse than what Bethesda did and for an online game its still pretty young.
---
You can get possum badges for doing new event at camp adams. Check my post.
---
There is such thing as nuance... 'the game is worth playing as long as/if x, y or z'.
---
Or 'the game has this to offer but...'
---
I could go on but I am sure that you get the picture.
---
Ther might be the odd troll but all in all it would seem to me that most people come in good faith searching for answers.
---
Since you are talking about this already, is the game worth coming back now?
---
When it comes gear and plans,recipes, it doesn't matter if you know the price or not, because everything is behind heavy RnG and consumer has access only to fraction of market. I can put legendary weapon for sale 100 caps or 2450 caps, it wont matter, because the one who needs it has no information that he can get it from me and one who doesn't, wont buy it, even if it is 20x times below market price.
---
Saw a BE pump action shotgun for 25k. I would have bought it but I didn‚Äôt have 25k on my character.
---
you and me both, tme to remake my camp lol
---
1:1 exchange rate?? That's a terrible idea. I play the game every day, for at least and hour, and I've probably only come across 150 legendaries in my whole time. Not everyone "farms" and server hops and stuff.
---
Try reading the poster again or taking to the master 
---
I had the same thing happen but I hadn't actually completed anything yet
---
I‚Äôm talking bout tadpole outfits, but thx.
---
Hell yeah
---
Had 20k
---
bought Elder Paint Plan
---
was at 0
---
Sold TSE Handmade for 12k
---
wanna buy neon letters for 10k
---
So I can sell my 3* Quad Tesla again for 14k
---
feels good :3
---
No, don't run those
---
Strange sub to be in then no? Even stranger post to comment on since you dont play. Just came here to spread some hate and negativity? 
---
You seem sound of mind and a joy to be around.
---
It is 100%.  I overheard conversations in party tonight about people that were doing it.
---
I need fusion cores for my laser gatling.
---
I need water for my corn soup.
---
I have been getting frustrated with all the loading screens.
---
I am level 220 and nothing is a challenge no matter where I live. 
---
I want materials to sell on my vendor.
---
I moved in between Charleston Landfill and Posiden powerplant. which is very low level but at this point in the game I could post up in the queens cave and just spit on her till she dies.
---
I built a bridge it is pretty. both workshops are in artillary range and im going to play with artillary.
---
posiden generates helicopters when fully repaired I am going to play with helicoptors. 
---
in fact I am gonna get super kinky and play with helicopters and artillery at the same time. 
---
hopefully they're close enough I can find a happy little patrol and spend less time looking at loading screens.
---
Those pods, but only after they bloom, and they only bloom if someone on the server has recently done the Radshield quest! Both the pod and bloom is harvest able!
---
It's always like "quit back in December what's changed" and I honestly can't remember what happened in December that made everyone quit. Was that the TSE nerf?
---
&gt;Raiders tag
---
Oh boy... what'd they nerf that offended you so?
---
Text chat should be on your pipboy. That would be pretty cool as have a lore value to it
---
I totally agree ive had more mic chat and player interaction in these last days than ever before. I think we can call this the actual reclamation patch. üòÄüëç
---
I have no idea if they can do that with the trade im a new player. But in most games from back in the day the way to get rich was using glitches with poker minigames.  With a protectron would also be really cool
---
Keeping a shotgun/using enforcer is the better solution?
---
Nice!
---
To be fair I've rarely used the trade system due to scammers and glitches early on that could loot your inventory. Most of my trade has been the old good willed drop trade.
---
I like this. It could possible help keeping the veterans in the game.
---
Maybe it could help identifying if a low level is just an alt for a veteran player?
---
Yeah....got all 7 of mine for free from Jims1973.
---
I've never understood the complaints about food spoiling - you're supposed to be cooking semi-frequently, not hoarding steaks.
---
you rock found him here thanks !!
---
You have to switch servers before your SO gets happy with you?
---
Oh is that still a thing? Because otherwise i wont trade with people.
---
I still remember the first 10 minutes i came out of the vault. A lvl 230 something wanted to trade with me. But i didnt really know how and what to do so i refused.
---
Who do you think Fallout's fanbase is?
---
Wait? 
---
I‚Äôve had suppressor on my 10mm smg. 
---
I‚Äôm confused
---
Explore the green part of the map first its the lower level section. And I missed that when I played ended up following the story story which took me to high level areas and I leveled up to much to fast.  By the time I went back it was too easy
---
Took me over a week to find it but I wasn't willing to spend more than 20 min every day looking for it. and that's not many server hops per day.  I also found mine at the miners monument  below Whitesprings.
---
What time are you on today? It's 11:30 am here (UK) and I'll probably get on after work
---
Personal preferance. I can't tell you what you like best :) Not like the game is so hard that it needs to be minmaxed. Go with the one you have most fun with. Personally i go with heavy weapons (lv220).
---
when graham talks about maybe having a memory of dancing it hit me right in the feels.
---
ye just found him there after 5 hops
---
I think that finally fixing the infinite carry weight glitch might have had a bearing on that, more so than the TSE nerf.
---
Heck yeah
---
I saw that too. I swore he said..."Wait", but the guy I was doing the Free Range event killed him before he could say anything else.
---
I think they fixed it, but if I'm honest I've only ever had good interactions with this community in game. I really love the community.
---
I saw someone selling about 2k leader bobble heads. Felt that was weird and took a video of it.
---
is that a weird level of bobble heads or does that one spawn somewhere consistently?
---
&gt; Best case: you insert a legendary item you already have, and pay scrips to re-roll a single effect. 
---
Best case insert *any* item you have and pay scrips to roll between 1 and 3 effects.  That would let us put legendary effects on things that don't yet have them, like Scout Armor.
---
Even if it's asked a lot shouldn't you be stoked people are interested? Wouldn't you like to grow the community by welcoming these people and encouraging them? Don't be a salty ass
---
Are you sure? Im pretty certain they are not in the game..
---
In the end i convinced my coleague to download 25gb of updates to do this.
---
Maybe that was bethesdas plan to return some players to the game *puts on tin foil hat* :)
---
That makes sense thank you
---
Agreed. I was never too excited about the possibility of pvp against other players; there are way too many dangers out there already, so helping out others is the goal for me :)
---
Nothing is worth 18k caps üòÇ I've seen reasonable people sell 3* items for a few thousand at most. You're part of the problem with the in-game economy
---
I've seen pure flux go for 50c and people were snapping it up.
---
Me want!  Me want!
---
Same thing happened to me! It‚Äôs so weird isn‚Äôt it? At least I got the share the wealth with my little brother
---
Is that a change we expect to see? How would I know if this was a Wild Blueberry or one someone planted? That seems counterproductive to the Overseers Message of ‚Äúgo out and help each other‚Äù
---
I don't see why they would, they have already said  
---
" You can also add functional mods to give your Backpack more utility, like increased damage reduction or food refrigeration, often in exchange for reduced storage capacity. "  
---
in the patch notes
---
Ye üòÇ. Most  decent Price is like 100-250 each not over 1k üòÇ
---
Happened to me too. All four machines empty (0/30). Stuff in in the stash, but it took me over an hour to setup 120 items, quantities, and prices.
---
Nah I‚Äôd rather keep the loyal non toxic fallout fan base. The more people who aren‚Äôt hardcore fallout fans the more trolls and griefers that will play. Love the community as is just the right ratio
---
I‚Äôve posted this in other threads, but I really find it useful to think about perk layout and equipment load-out as having several major categories, and it is useful to have a plan for how you work in each of those modes.
---
* General PVE wandering adventure
---
* General PVE survival
---
* PVP
---
* Travel, crafting and selling
---
* Capstone boss
---
* In addition, you need a ‚Äúgroup tag‚Äù option if you‚Äôre in a group event (herding cows or Whitespring ghoul farming say) and can 1-shot most things. You want to get your lick in, but not be a jerk to everyone else.
---
Some things you really only need for PVE capstone bosses. My heavy weapon person right now I focus mostly on flamer and cryo, though I have a few dakka I generally don‚Äôt use. For the rest of PVE adventuring, I swap to Fire Axes. Mind you this is mostly because ammo on those until very recently was a mother of a bitch to keep up, so maybe I‚Äôll stay heavy for a while. Given that armor pen doesn‚Äôt work on energy weapons I have the points and card ready in INT but instead carry Batteries Included (for all the fuel, cryocells, etc.)
---
Please allow me to bestow an upvote good sir.
---
They aren't but people like to think their virtual shit is really valuable. Players that are in it together won't charge nearly that high, only the ones that are out to take advantage of player trading and set prices based on marketplace values will do it. 
---
I've found plenty of equipment for just a few thousand caps. Kudos to the players that actually care about making a fun game with others!
---
Leaving raw fertilizer is always good
---
Most likely to be a duper or friend of duper
---
got you. I live above the lucky hole mine and still have not used all the ore from ONE run with ex armour 250 hrs ago.steel is in abundance all around me, acid however can be a pain.just saying tho,
---
if a non legendary  308 can take out a level 55 beast out at sunrise field,from the top of wotoga high school, in 5 clips of 5, then its still a highly viable weapon. havn't tried the 50. with long scope and no supressor to check accuresy yet,frightend something unrepairable happens to it.
---
having said that,due to wait constraints,my 308 is in storage in favour of the 50.but would still like to carry both.
---
Stimpack diffuser should be released next week.
---
Yeah its risky as hell, makes ya not even wanna at times
---
I use it, very helpful to stop charging enemies in there tracks.
---
Cool I'm going to report it. They were a lvl 30ish and also had 2k of stimpacks.
---
The game has no idea what the market value is. These items have been openly traded for caps for 6months. The game will tell you to sell an extremely rare legendary combination for 1% of it's true value.
---
Well alright this sounds good! I stopped playing in January but i will redownload now
---
Never bothered with mutations until yesterday, decided to try my luck at a nearby camp and some fine fellow was selling them for 250 caps each. Best 1000 caps spent in the game yet, don't know how i managed without speed demon and marsupial for so long before but it makes exploring the Wasteland so much more fun.
---
Yeap, very weird. I've reported this bug, maybe today maintenance gonna to fix it
---
I find myself running around people‚Äôs camps and just interacting with things and getting a general idea to how I can structure my own CAMP. It‚Äôs great - it also makes time go so quickly when you‚Äôre exploring other camps. I have also found I‚Äôve learned that there are weapons I‚Äôve never even heard of by looking at peoples vending machines, which makes me want to go out into the world and try and find/craft said weapons myself!
---
Every single day the same question a hundred times.
---
Nice, thanks for the Info
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem like a ‚Äúdead‚Äù game anymore.
---
Really, what the fuck are you going to do with 30k caps? Considering you hit the cap at 25k too. I usually have around 6k caps in the bank and no fucking idea what to do with them
---
Pleasure.
---
I guess if you wanted a haunted house camp...
---
Wanna buy some overpriced bobby-pins?
---
I think most people don't understand that once you start running nuke zones the materials for serums are cheap. I just vendored a bunch of materials for stable flux because the damn stuff weighs a ton.
---
Well if any PS4 wants to help me with it, I‚Äôll gladly pay well for it!
---
Hmm, are u on PS4? I would borrow this plan for little tip if you dont mind :D
---
The effect of enforcer is just so much more "visible" ^^
---
High capacity tops out at 120lbs of extra carry weight. It also lowers your energy and rad resist by 60 however.
---
Personal I think the prices are ok.... 
---
It all depends what the player is looking for and willing to pay  . I had a sheepsquatch outfit It was my first item I did put in the machine ..... I asked 500 caps . I have a instigating super sledge 1 star ,my price is also set to 500 caps . 
---
30 Min later  it was sold . My teammates said I sold it to cheap ,they have seen it go for 1K and more .... 
---
Since the new update,  I run my own "Salvage Shack"  , everything is 2nd hand stuffü§£ .
---
So prices are reasonable. (I think üëçüèª )
---
This is how the game is intended to play .... We are traders trying to survive...
---
Have a nice day ....
---
Lol. You need to do some econ101 reading mate. Supply and demand dictates prices. I have no ability to influence that in any meaningful way. The reason prices have gone up so much is the rarity of good drops and the abundance of caps due to people being able to create 5 characters and easily get to max caps on all of them.
---
Join the discord. There's a group offering 80k for unyielding and sentinels every day. No joke dude. I'm sitting on 32k right now and I only spend it on ammo because no one has the instigating super sledge I need.
---
By the way, when it starts the quest and you can‚Äôt find it, check the Daily questlog. It‚Äôs not under the usual sidequest or Order of the Tadpole screen. You have to click the quest so that it shows where the mutagenic goo is. If you still can‚Äôt see it, look for the steaming yellow goo around the rundown housing slightly to the southwest.
---
I thought about doing this actually XD. Just fair warning, don't build too close to Morgan Town. Its a Cobalt Flux gold mine and I need them for all the prime plasma cartridges that are actually worth making now. Sorry if your shop just so happens to be on the wrong side of the river.
---
sorry, forgot to say. I'm PC player
---
I've stopped playing in december but for none of that reasons. I was simply burned out waiting for bugfixes and constant server crashes and lag (due to idiots duping stuff).
---
Btw i bought refrigrator and it isn't bugged same way, shame.
---
Bad news for people like me who find joy in smashing other peoples things.
---
I like it and didn‚Äôt think I would. Stopping by others places has been fun too.
---
Yes. XB1 here. As another member said, I‚Äôve had to use VATS to auto-target then come out of VATS to actually attack.
---
what is all this? pls explain
---
Ok so those are pods not blooms they only bloom during radshield quest? Sorry the english was a bit confusing.
---
Agree on the map price. Are any plans worth 10k now that deep pockets and BOS are vendor available?
---
yeah, i thought more like human non-hostile NPC's however
---
This has to be one of the greatest gaming communities.
---
Real price of bullets is 0.3 caps per bullet (except 50 cal and 5mm and prime). Only reason you buy for 1 caps or higher is because there is no where to sink your caps.
---
You can still get your schadenfreude in survival though?
---
how dare you!!
---
Omg someone posts something i dont like! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOM HALP.
---
Yes, my friend bought fridge to, and it isn't bugged. It's work only for capacity mod
---
Fou d a use for the repair kits the SBQ drops  fired around 10 shots and used kit 3 times.  took me around 15 mins to do all 3 repairs
---
Excuse you! My perfectly preserved pie is totally worth the 25k it's currently listed as, thank you very much! After all, it is perfect.
---
It's mad lol, it's such a meta part of the game too, just read one guy would've bought it for 25k just to get off the cap limit. Well mate then theres the stash weight limit plus not having someone buy it off you because it's 20k too dear! Mental! I imagine some top hat and monocle wearing 1%er monopoly men sat in a discord quaffing champagne and talking like Texan oil barons
---
Who's Graham?
---
Oh OK. As you asked. I would never normally share CAMP pics but now you understand it's the *principle* and not any inherent beauty, here you go: https://imgur.com/a/GPwLT7f
---
To be honest, i have no idea which plan is most rare. For me it is fucking shielded raider underarmor.
---
Ive played every fallout game in existence, started f76 at launch but quit about a month in cause duping, inventory space, lag etc.... Im not a troll or briefer. I cruise this sub every few months to see if its a game I can enjoy. What's wrong if people like me ask?
---
There has been so many patches and updates its quicker just to ask you guys for current data. As a fallout fan if rather have those genuinely wanting to come back for fun come back, and salty players like op hit the road lol. Attitudes like yours aren't what makes this game or its community good, or give it a good look to attract new players
---
I love it when im crafting and i get the caps sound.
---
Have a look outside and its a player. Wave hello. Invite him in. Offer them some freshly cooked... well whatever i recently killed in a nice little packed paper bag ready for the road. Some water is available at the purifiers.
---
Wave goodbye, good luck on your adventure into watoga lv33 character. 
---
Its also cool do make a detour to someones camp on my own adventure. See what they built. See what they are offering. 
---
Maybe it would be cool ti make it a bit cheaper to fast travel to someones camp to incentivise it a bit more. Like a 10-20% discount. Sort of like a trade route.
---
Oh darn it I that reminds me of the terminal, I have to build one of those and see what it does
---
Colonel Kelly monument is good too. Only took me a few hops to find him.
---
Ye thats fact‚úîÔ∏è
---
Nah i'm not very high level I get bullied on there.
---
Hardest part of the Hunter one was finding a wolf to kill. 
---
I will admit that I found a level 28 bear for the dart gun.
---
I'm not sure I remember this spot. I'll have to look it up! Thanks!
---
Ah, I see. Well, something to shoot for. Level up and continue your wanton destruction.
---
It's just south of Philippi Cemetery. Tourist spawns lying on a bench just before actual monument. What I liked about this location is it's not too far from the spawn point.
---
You can also scrap and rebuild on the same server over and over. Goes quicker if you have way too much fertilizer Nd do a Green Thumb run of a field of razorgrain
---
Ah, I'm never up that ways. Do this will give me a new reason to explore the area
---
Give me a text chat box, I'd stay and chat with you.
---
Otherwise I'm sick of hitting the same 2 emotes.
---
Look,  it's also possible that they just played the hell out of the game. I trade stuff among my characters,  have 3 machines at my camp... But I'm not a duper
---
Thanks, found it! I was at the shooting range instead.
---
Deep pocket plans, you say? Are they just for leather armor of can other types have deep pockets?
---
DENTAL PLAN
---
But that‚Äôs cheating
---
Even better the second time around
---
It would have been nice to have this be unlockable in Ever Upwards as part of earning a "botanist badge"
---
You can craft a separate one at the armor station.
---
It's the same game you played before, on slightly better servers.
---
I mean they are kind of more in demand due to the possum badge.
---
See, the irony here is palpable because so far you're the one here who is being toxic my dude.
---
Scope for the Crossbow as well please. 
---
Honestly most of the new guns have little *if any* mods available.
---
You didn't REALLY think hoarding legendaries for months would give you a massive advantage, did you?
---
There are two heads. Maybe one is female and the other male
---
On the other hand I saw a furious lvl45 lever action for 350 caps. There's no consensus on pricing, hence the thread, I guess.
---
How many badges at each level do you need to do to get access to the next level?
---
For the first time i have 10k caps. People buying my spare nuke cards and giving my old legendaries new homes cuz i aint gonna use them again lol.
---
Servers hasn't been real stable since the patch came out at least not on PS4.  The vendor screen is hella sluggish and non responsive.  Don't know that it has anything to do with duping since it seems to have come with the update.  Just my experience anyway.
---
He‚Äôs a super mutant trader who wanders the map
---
&gt;The fact they've built their construction-system on an inept engine isn't a really valid reason. 
---
How is that not a valid reason? It's not like they could port the whole game to another engine at a whim. Currently, this is what we have and there's no way around the technical limitations right now. 
---
So far, they made noticeable progress on server stability what with the additional stash size and reduced budget for turrets and lights. We just need to be patient. We'll get there eventually.
---
&gt;As you say, there's only 24 people on a server, some with CAMPs barely made of a few planks and the workshop.
---
You can't calculate with half of the players only having a very basic camp. What if all players on the server happen to have camps with an almost full budget?
---
Thought that video was just gunna be another whiney rant but it is actually genuinely funny, enjoyed it a lot.
---
I angered a troll as they browse my post history just to down vote me.
---
Yep, I saw someone who only had Misc items and I went to check out what that meant. Left their CAMP 250 caps lighter and jumping like a kangaroo.
---
And is it too much too ask of you just ingore those posts, if you don't wanna nswer it or get involved?
---
Because your method of blocking those request is showing this community as a closed up bunch of arrogant ego.
---
Whilst if you would just ignore those post, someone else can answer those asking and present this community as friendly and welcoming, which it is most of the times.
---
I found marine combat helmets for the sale and the owner told me to scrap it to get the plans. Im gonna be selling them now because someone bought my spare for 75 caps
---
Ha! That is my base. You can put your CAMP there, even inside. I completely built around that. 
---
1. It has about 5-10 world containers
---
2. It will spawn plans on the TV in the bedroom and mods by the armor bench. 
---
3. It has good junk in there laying around.
---
4. Ticks spawn CONSTANTLY and there are about 8-10 each spawn.
---
5. Whew! Did I tell you this is a great spot! 
---
The only drawback is that I use a bunch of disease cure because I get ticks on my balls all the time which causes parasites. Ticks everywhere, ticks, ticks, ticks
---
Can people please adjust fusion core prices based on charge? If you want me to pay 162 for a full core, don't expect to get that for a 50% core. In fact, price that at about 70, because I still have to carry the full weight for less charge.
---
Done! Thanks!
---
I built a quite literal metal box. Don't worry. 
---
I couldn't build a fancy home even in Minecraft. Trust me, I tried.
---
I‚Äôm getting on now. I need it too. AC_Fortuna
---
What tho?
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for someone to put something great up as a joke for 25k so I can buy it haha :)
---
If I'm unsure I usually do a 50% price cut from what the game says its worth. 
---
If I'm still unsure I just ask myself what price I'd wanna see if I was visiting another players machine and price accordingly.
---
What didn't you like about it? Even after over 1500 videos I'm always looking to improve.
---
Yes, bashing! And make sure you have the Gunsmith perk unequipped, wondered why it took me so long :)
---
It's tough. I put all my bobbleheads at 100 caps and they aren't selling.
---
Got a explody double barrel for 7k and nobody biting.
---
I paid full price for it, I think I'm allowed to complain a little. How about you do something else instead of trying to dictate what I do and do not say?
---
Why'd you have to throw in that "i was in the military!"? As far as I understood, there was nothing related to army/military here.
---
Honestly, I'm glad they finally fixed the 50 cal damage it was silly that it did less than the 308.  I also understand the pain of trying to get 308 ammo.  It used to drop at a higher amount but that was patched long ago.  But with super duper and weapon artisan its not terrible, I wish I could make 5.56 in 100 groups too, but I've adjusted.  Think it's a win sorry not to agree with you on this one.  On a side note I picked up a couple 50 and 38 cal receivers at Grafton station the other day I believe.
---
Send friend inv
---
Nothing is worth 18k to YOU.
---
To that guy it definitely was. 
---
There are no set prices. The majority of players probably have never even been on reddit or any trading site.
---
I never use the trading sites as I hate 3rd party game mechanics. So I have no clue what you perceive as 'normal' prices.
---
I set my prices on what I think they are worth.
---
I hit max caps twice after buying serum recipies both times just to free up cap space. Never been over 10k before last night and I have played since beta, lvl 158.
---
I'm asking 400 and they are selling. I figure that's low enough for people who want them to mutate.
---
Im not saying those people are dupers....just that its a lot of stuff everyones bringing out all at once. Some people are really into the vending and were stocked up and ready for it. I wonder if the servers were
---
its a joke referencing the old games skill/stat check points.
---
All in all though, it changed with the last patch.
---
For sure :) still
---
Under 1k :)

Why people keeps calling him Graham? It's Grahm.

Anecdotal evidence is not evidence

What is this interior you speak of all of my crafting benches are sitting on the ground by a river.

Hey! If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll happily build you a Camp for free :)
---
**Bug**: nice they fixed the black powder reload bypass glitch, [but who needs reload at all, still](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l31Hlrg-dv4&amp;feature=youtu.be)?
---
**Bug?**: went to Flatwoods, milked a cow but the other 7 cows did nothing when I tried to milk them. The prompt stayed on.
---
**Bug?**: Still can craft and scrap a certain item and get a free Steel scrap beyond getting all resources back. For better results, equipping super duper 3 and crafting 100 items will get back all invested resources plus about 130 free Steel. I'm pretty eager to do a PSA about this Beth ;)
---
**Stability**: I also got kicked from server and rolled back once. Hope it gets resolved by todays server hotfix.
---
**Quest design**: revive an ally but I'm soloing and lately an SBQ run is pretty unlikely. I wonder if emergency protocols or misterious savior would count? Perhaps repairing a messenger or the random encounter Mr Handy could count.
---
**Bug?** I also got the survival weekly reward in Adventure mode. May not matter the next week (unless that challenge is also bugged).
---
**Bug?** Mirelurks are no longer animals (I wonder they fixed it due to my post), but a Scorched Yao Guai is still an animal (unlike other scorched).
---
**Bug**: *I haven't encountered this in P9 just yet*; I reload my gun and the game [shoots a bullet without me clicking](https://youtu.be/Q27ok2hwFRo), over and over. It only stops when I do actually shoot an additional bullet.
---
**Bug**: After logging in and becoming able to move, reloading the current gun (the one that was equipped when logging out) does not refill the bullets and stays 000. I have to reload again. The fact that one starts with 0 as the game forgets the clip amount is pretty annoying already, but having to do it twice is quite a letdown, especially since mobs show up half the time when I log back at my camp.
---
**Bug?**: *Probably not new*; planted camp food (Razorgrain, Mutfruit, Tato, etc.) block shots. It is pretty annoying mobs start to trash the vegetables and I can't shoot them next to the bushes.
---
**Bug?**: *Probably not new*; there are these small cars with a plateau (I don't know what they are called in English; 4 wheels, a flat space to put stuff on and a handle) which block shots, i.e., I can't shoot throught the handle opening. There is one near the SD markt in Watoga and one in Harper's Ferry at the Chem Stations in the alley with that Van.
---
I get the skill check, I get that you're saying it changed. I just dont know what changed. Im honestly asking. It still looks the same.
---
Had one, was two star, sold it to whitespring station bot because I needed that stash space
---
Sounds about right. I wouldn't pay more than a 100 caps.
---
If your DR is low enough does this drop you below zero?
---
Remindme! 10 hours
---
Yes, if you haven't fully joined the pioneer scouts. 
---
Exams and quests are required.
---
These are all really cool, thanks for posting this.
---
Yup happened to me last night
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, and really like shotguns.  I‚Äôm going to swap between melee and shotguns since it‚Äôs just a handful of perk cards.   Like you, I need to decide if I want to put more into adrenaline.  I will say enforcer still does its job, so stunlock/crippling my foes then switch blading them to death is cool.
---
did you learned the plan for it yet?
---
is the next thing I have to ask.
---
At the terminal would be fine, id prefer an actual ledger that when your sit at a desk it opens up to use
---
W
---
It's part of the overseer's questline to have you join the responders.
---
If ure going for tagging/grinding. Go after the quad effect to cut down in the reloading. Then use the automatic mod and zap everything!!
---
DeLisle Carbine
---
Welrod
---
Sten (with suppressor as a mod)
---
PIAT
---
Flying Dragon dart gun
---
American 180
---
So even if I don‚Äôt put much into strength the melee weapons will be viable, at least in the early game?
---
It got trashed hard. I used to go there to sell.
---
So your rationale is "I don't use them, so fuck everyone else!"
---
Blueprints aren't just there so YOU can use them, they're there for the system to back your camp up itself in the event you HAVE to move.  i.e. how the game was initially designed where logging into a server where your spot was taken meant your house was forcibly removed or even now when bethesda decides to pick a new area as a no-build zone to move in a new event or quest.
---
Yep, folks can charge what ever they want.  But I can't get enough caps to make buying at those prices worth it to me.  I bought a 3 star hammer yesterday for 1k caps saw a 1 star version of it for sale this morning for 5k.  
---
My camp is off the beaten path so I have to mark my stuff down considerably to make any sales (made a few thousand caps so far though).   But I don't think I am alone under the FO poverty line.  
---
I have also burned hundreds of caps traveling to camps to browse though.
---
Only vaguely related to OP but those of you who have the 'refrigerator' plan, would you mind sharing what is the 'drawback'?
---
Just trying to get my priorities 'right'.
---
That would be great, I also think they need a way to indicate if someone has legendary weapons/armor for sale. Sick of going to places that show them having 20 weapons and then it only be fucking axes or knuckles.
---
And by the way, that's not what blueprints are used for.  Their purpose isn't to make moving a structure ten feet to the right easier, it's to make moving a structure to the other side of the map easier.
---
I hear that! Shoot, I'm lvl 77 and I have the same problem. I didn't realize how much of a dump I had until seeing that many settlements.
---
The mutations you get in the game are much more fun than the ones in real life.
---
Both the old terminal and the new one we got yesterday don't have any options to select when connected or standing near your vending machines, sadly.
---
Quad seems to work fine with automatic barrel but it deals way less damage and it drains ammo extremely fast. I'm not really a huge fan of that ammo drain...
---
Started a new character because I messed up my old ones build, found one at the teapot without even knowing the cameras came out yet, decided I‚Äôd rather play my old guy and haven‚Äôt found a camera yet at any spawn points.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried server hopping because I don‚Äôt care that much right now, just trying to level up to fix my build.
---
But,  stash is still at 800. It's not like you can really overload things,  with a 30 item limit.
---
I bought it from the atomic shop by accident. I still have to the quest even though I bought it ?
---
I want spoilers. What changed?
---
This may be true. I played survival when it first came out and it felt so refreshing, I wish there was a way to turn of fast travel in regular mode because it‚Äôs too tempting especially when your team mates do it. You don‚Äôt want to take ten years to walk there when they are 10 steps into the next quests already.
---
The only other buff that might get popular is the -15% dmg while blocking. But I still think even with the nerf these armour pieces still stand out on top with a complete sets.
---
75% still pretty high, add in the right perk cards like dodgy will help alone too.
---
However there is one last thing it needs: tamed Scorchbeasts that you can summon into battle by your side ;)
---
I love people visiting my camp since player vending I have alot and one or two have gone out of their way to message me to say they like it
---
Ya that can be true but it‚Äôs mainly a great setup just for tagging when in large groups lol
---
You made the same mistake as me I thought it was the actual backpack its a skin
---
You need to finish the tadpole quest and do 3 world challanges from the tadpoles badges
---
Posts like this help the game recover to some degree. If I wouldn't not already be a member of the society, I'd buy the game and join it ASAP.
---
Yea it really ruins it tbh. Its like all the Rust or Arma players joined and started making the same shitty bases they made in the other games.
---
Got a stalkers explosive double barrel set at 7k. No takers last night. We'll see how today goes.
---
Awesome. The whole point of the game is finally working on the most basic level over half a year after launch. Congrats bethesda you finally accomplished what should have been there on day 1. You get the bare minimum credit bethesda, good job.
---
Imagine playing Ultima Online instead of taking pictures to pass check lists like in Fallout.
---
Yeah. It should definitely have reflex sights and a silencer. 
---
The thing I don't like about the smg is the recoil. You would think a smaller caliber would have less recoil than a handmade with it's 5.56. Otherwise what is the point?
---
Out of your choices I‚Äôd go with bloodied. I‚Äôm bias as I‚Äôm s bloodied build myself lmao
---
How much more weight does it add?
---
Marsupial and Bird Bones is a good pairing, but it suck for your strength.
---
chiming in because I just came back and I don't understand why this game is worth playing currently. I came here to figure out what new content there is and to discuss it. If you honestly are so hostile that you can't even accept people questioning what there is to do in this game or why you would play the game, then maybe you shouldn't be here? You're obviously too much of an immature child if you can't answer a simple question and get butthurt over someone asking...
---
I‚Äôve got a list if you need it?  Hope this helps!
---
Syrup x2,
---
Milk,
---
Sugar x2,
---
Spices,
---
Bone,
---
Razorgrain flour x2
---
maybe he's confused with 10mm auto-pistol. this one sure have suppressor capability.
---
that said. 10mm is super accurate gun even with ironsights. like killer-pixel-precision-accurate. i used it, when explosive was all the meta (have one explosive 10mm) and it was a headshot seeker. single taps with insane accuracy.
---
Amen to that, brother.
---
+60 for 50lvl
---
You can see how ridiculous it looks though? theres nothing better than coming across a base that looks good/interesting that doesnt look like it came straight out of *Castle In The Sky*
---
At the restaurant not far from the brotherhood vendor at watoga
---
haven't milked a brahmin yet, but i can see i will need it for a recipe from the new scout quest, does it spoil, or can i just stuff them in mys stash for a long time ?
---
wait how did you do that
---
I mean, unless you're looking for black titanium, shotguns and mole teeth there's nothing worth getting there.  And it's ugly and has toxic areas.
---
How do I transfer stuff to it üòÇ been trying for ages
---
Ran across this texture blip the other day.  Freaked me out: [https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Zen6znF.jpg)
---
Was killing max level super mutants in far less than 12 shots last night with my level 40 quad explosive shotty. 
---
Quit crying.
---
Does it have an udder?
---
Because if it does, I have news for you...
---
I hopped through a guys window messed with his unprotected terminal all his lamps are now random, his switches are off, and left a surprise for him on his bed
---
Today: hate, yesterday:love. 
---
Seriously I was thrown under the bus when I told someone who asked the same question to expect hate. He got all pleasant answers. 
---
I guess you asked on the wrong day.
---
You wouldn't think backpacks, booze and a reskinned deathclaw would bring so much to do... but here we are.
---
Literally mod a Combat Knife. It has "No Upgrade" as you'd expect with the default blade, then it has a second "No Upgrade" which is exactly the same functionally, but removes the blade from the model.
---
You can load up your character
---
50!
---
Are you on XB1? What's the roll you're looking for?
---
I was level 99. Completing the Scorched Earth event got me to level 100.
---
I typically do:
---
1c for most ammunition.
---
1c for Bobby Pins.
---
2c for Junk.
---
3c for Grenades. 
---
5c for drugs and Purified Water.
---
7c for Radaway.
---
10c for Stimpaks. 
---
12c for Plans.
---
25c-50c for 25-100% Fusion Cores.
---
100c for Nuclear Keycard.
---
Weapons and Armor are priced according to Item, but you're better off trading Legendaries for Scrip at the moment.
---
&gt;I bought a TSE Handmade without mods last night for 2.5k so don't bullshit me on that
---
Thanks for confirming again that you need to do some econ101 reading.
---
&gt;Also I sincerely doubt the majority of players have 5 characters with max caps
---
Majority? No, probably not. But you're ignoring the bigger picture of the daily inflation where hundreds of thousands, if not millions of fresh caps are generated into the market every single day. Do you really think an item that might have a tiny fraction of a chance to drop is worth the amount of caps a single player can easily earn in 2 days, and also an amount which will clearly lose value very quickly due to said inflation?
---
I was wondering that the does, now we know
---
The negativity to this game deals with ALOT more than launch bugs, which for the most part are still there. 
---
So yea don‚Äôt be so easily dismissive. the games taken over half a year to get to the point where it should have been at what used to be a regular launch.
---
This is great but the challenge for crafting a serum, like, why Bethesda, why?
---
 Up to 1500lbs, I believe,  and then it locks up
---
Because they‚Äôre realistic? I‚Äôve been on his forum since day 1. And I would stil caution people from jumping into this game.
---
People bought them, though! I don't farm flux (rather, High-Radiation Fluids never seem to drop), so that's my issue with a higher price.
---
Didn‚Äôt hoard legendaries for the vendor 
---
I have legendaries to sell, you never know what people might want so I kept a lot
---
Doing that for 3/4 months before a tiring so I saw this as a new direction
---
Heh, just so long as people understand it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Hell, if my post sounds vaguely backhanded, it is. But I do think Bethesda have hit an important milestone.
---
Regardless of my own personal opinions on 76, the good, the bad and the ugly, it felt it worth noting all the same.
---
A few days ago "I'm ready to do this, it'll be so much fun to adventure"
---
Bethesda: Were gonna have you taking so many camera pictures you'll be able to open a photo shop
---
&gt; I paid full price for it, I think I'm allowed to complain a little. 
---
You are.
---
&gt; How about you do something else instead of trying to dictate what I do and do not say? 
---
I never once tried tried to dictate what you should/n't do. You seemed to be making a mountain out of a molehill, so I just recommended a path you can take, if you feel so "slapped in the face."
---
Carry capacity +1500
---
I have a bloodied explosive Tesla. It's fantastic for nuke zones. Not powerful enough to one hit anything but packs enough of a punch to clear a mob if needed. Perfect for tagging.
---
Haha I managed to restrain that level of backhanded compliment for the sake of the post, but I get you.
---
Trading subs? Can you tell me more? I just started playing.
---
Anything would be better at this point than two whole ‚Äúquest lines‚Äù that rely on taking pictures all day. What boring content.
---
Just tested it. No, at least UI wise, when your resistance goes below 1, it just doesn't show any number in stats, just like if you don't have any rad resist effect, there's no numbers, but the moment you pop up RadX or get any armor with rad resist, the number appears in stats.
---
Maybe something related to workshops? I got mine when I captured sunshine meadows.
---
I ended up selling mine anyways
---
Oh wow that's impressive i will get that instead of the refrigerator mod. 
---
Im working on the possum musician challange and none of the play this instrument register
---
With vending machines, it gives purpose to my insane idea.
---
Build a pub.
---
Build a pub, filled with alcohol, barstools, all that jazz. A vending machine gives incentive to come.
---
If you add a couple of PSN names to your friends list you can travel for free to them and then you can go on by foot  to the next vendor . While you are there kill a couple of mutants and sell the weapons in a station. 
---
It's nice to see all the dissent camps as well.... That's worth the extra caps
---
Technically the worst case is you keep getting DC'ed immediately after it starts and NEVER get to become a conduit.
---
Aw, lame. I guess I‚Äôll just sell them to players who accidentally lost theirs then
---
I got a bloodied, limb dmg one.   I usually aim for legs in those mob. Then they all slow down üëçüèº
---
I think it's bugged challenge. Try another
---
I feel ya. I have chemist, pharmacist, super duper. I'm basically building a chem and alcohol store over here.
---
The admins on this sub have banned mention of the main one for no good reason so I can't link it. Its got the word market in the name followed by 76.
---
Wow, wrong forum. I'm a dork. Sorry, y'all.
---
None of this socialist propaganda of set prices.
---
This is capitalism with a free market.
---
Go away commie.
---
Still too cheap in my opinion, People can still get them from you and sell on to the vendors for a profit.
---
IMO, they should be sold for no less than what the vendors BUY them for.
---
Def agree.  I enjoyed checking out everyone's camps!
---
Pc dude.

I‚Äôm on the freeway near riverside manor!
---
I‚Äôve setup on the road with a thru-way type setup, going for the ‚Äúwe collect shit from pre-war‚Äù vibe. A wall dedicated to illuminated posters and my vending machine here sells bulk junk, as well as an indoor bar and workshop area. Got a picnic spot out the back which has access to a pot for cooking, plus the vending machine there sells food and drink!
---
Advanced Power Connectors (buy the plans from the Enclave vendor), the one you're looking for will be Pass-Thru (or something to that effect)
---
If I could, I would buy all your serums for 250, then sell them to vendors for 500, making myself free caps.
---
Damn! Pretty sure I have that exact roll but I'm on xb1. Good hunting!
---
If you let me revive you in water, I'll let you revive me
---
Thanks!  I knew it was something like that.
---
Sure I‚Äôll give u name of the guy 
---
Who sells that for 250
---
Check my post about easy way to grind it. I did 7badges by doing one event repeatedly
---
Will be online in 30 minutes
---
cheaters
---
I always try to keep my stuff cheap. I've sold a couple of - IMO - decent legendaries, for only like 280 caps. Chems I sell for like 25-50 a pop. Fusion cores are 100 caps.
---
Then I stumbled on someone's camp yesterday and saw some really awesome BoS armor I wanted to get...until I realized it was 1500 caps a piece. As a filthy casual, I'd rather farm for the plans.
---
Damn man, you are a beast!
---
Thank you so much for the effort you put into making this, because there's no way in hell this was easy to do.
---
At a minimum, sell them for more than the Vendors will buy them for. At least you will stop people buying from you and selling onwards to vendors.
---
Sure I didn't know that was a challenge. I'm andy892 idk how much water you need but my camp is near the mirelurk pond at whitesprings
---
Got mine first day on the first try.
---
It was at the waterpark in the parking lot.
---
I don't see it: [https://imgur.com/a/kHCj8Eo](https://imgur.com/a/kHCj8Eo)
---
Or use the restroom, eh?
---
Dumb question, may have forgotten....but how many badges/quests need to be completed in order to upgrade to opossum? I really want that backpack
---
I will help you, no need anything as refund, just bring me some fragmentation grenade for suicide, please. IGN:emreyigit93
---
You do know it's 30 items per machine correct?
---
 From what I seen a lot of people didn't realize this.
---
i got s'mores from the tadpole quests
---
Honestly this patch added a ton of the harder to find plans into the train station vendors. This means about the only thing worth using them for is power armor plans. These tend to drop at like 1/50 chance. So to me the chance of getting anything good or that I need is extremely low. I really feel these maps took a huge value hit do to see some of ya'll pricing them at nearly double their usual rate is baffling. But hey, if you can sell them at whatever price, more power to you.
---
Just go to the grafton train station and buy em.
---
Seeing all the fancy homes my shed pales in comparison.  In fact my aim now is to make my shed as grotty as possible to see how bad I can make it!
---
That is way to high! I wouldn't pay anything over 500 or 600 caps.
---
For me it‚Äôs the worst part of the quest... I am a player day one , lv 191, and have ZERO friend everybody left... Indeed as a PC player no one use the mic ( me included..) and there is not basic chat in game.... 
---
well in the same case as you...I‚Äôll be there tonight sneeaking around vault 76 hoping for a fresh player to Die so I can revive him....
---
I just found about that from a video 3 hours ago about the adam camp event. I've only gotten 1 possum badge from doing it 8 times. So far doesn't seem worth it. 
---
I'm close to getting 4 badges from the challenge will finish those then try the event over and over
---
Nah it‚Äôs gram
---
Ahh, I get it now. You never understood the point of the post in the FIRST place. Your insistence on arguing an irrelevant point makes sense now. 
---
One last try and then if your still don't understand, then I'm done wasting my time. The post, you see, was about players locking their doors. And mobs destroying your base is in no way related to that subject. 
---
Mobs spawn behind locked doors. They spawn in my generator hut all the time. I kept it locked a long time ago but realized that was useless. Only lining the floor with punji boards helped - but that still doesn't address the locked doors.  You see?
---
In closing, for those who are glacially slow, I asked about doors being locked. Enemy npc spawns don't care about locked doors. Locked doors only stop honest players. I do not care one bit about whether or not items in your base can be destroyed by mobs spawning in with player fast traveling - because it's unrelated to the post. It has nothing to do with whether or not you lock your doors. Other answers to the post were from people who actually read it for what it was. And they responded about players' behaviors in your base, not molerats and liberators. 
---
If that's a lot of text to you it's because I'm truly trying to help you see past your tunnel vision. Will that help you? I'm guessing not.
---
I found some around Helvetia. I think mine was just luck tho
---
 Yep,  have multiple machines going on two characters
---
Ok thanks! You might want to delete your comment for safety ;-)
---
Dupers doesnt bother to sell "in game", they want to sell on eBay
---
They fixed that bug. It shouldn't of ever given more dr or damage.
---
You'll need it for the swimming bit
---
I'll be online in 20
---
I would rather prefer them to add weapons from previous games.
---
You can still make a fancy metal box.  I did.  It's not much but it's home with, eventually, missile launchers ;)
---
Its vats weapon anyways
---
Game night or real?
---
I killed ten squirrels yesterday.... At Seneca rocks
---
2k stimpaks is neither here nor there.
---
2k bobbleheads however - and of the same type to boot - is... I am going to conservativelty settle for 'peculiar'.
---
This is the second time I see the word scrip and I have no idea what it means (I don't play the game in English). Can you explain?
---
That was the first place I tried ,
---
but no luck for me :(
---
I wish it gave a server-wide notice. I did it once lastnight by myself and got to round 2 out of 3 gor the bug swarm, and couldn't complete it. It gets crazy with all those damned bugs.
---
My favorite camps so far are the ones that look like someone was trying fifteen ideas and stopped each of them 10% of the way in.  I saw one that had stairs that led to nowhere but had a fishing dock all setup.
---
I think that's the stub barrel, it looks like a suppressor,
---
In all seriousness the game still has bugs. If your tolerance for them hasn't changed hold off. 
---
The game has a lot more to do but you're a little late to the party. Each event seemed to bring people together and foster a community. For about a week. Then people move on. Nukes are rare, haven't seen an encryptid in days, anybody who hasn't got a camera by now can't find anyone who's holding a spawn and anyone holding a spawn gets crickets and no-one showed up to free range today. Even Fasnacht had a depleted turn out after about 3 days (the impossible to get masks didn't help though)
---
Maybe vending has staying power but only if you have some great items. I'm not even bothering setting up one because I know I have nothing anybldy wants. Primarily it does make the game a bit more alive since it's easy to find people's camps. 
---
Get on quick if you do. I'm sure the Pioneer Scouts only has a couple of days of life left in it.
---
It feels way more online and alive than ESO where the only form of player interaction you have is PvP in Cyrodiil. This was by far the best update to the game.
---
I made a post on this yesterday, it's definitely nerfed. 1 run used to net me 5-8+ trash legendaries, now after 4 runs I feel lucky to have gotten 3, still the most reliable place for junk legendaries tho, which I needed last night for scrip.
---
I'll give it a try. Cheers
---
Yeah yesterday a player came by my camp he repaired his stuff and asked me if he could harvest some of my plants to build his own adhesive farm. That's how the game should be all the player helping each other outüôÇ
---
I was doing that event for 3hours. 10badges from it.
---
Where‚Äôs your camp?  By the golf courses near white spring I‚Äôm guessing?
---
I read this in Billingsley's voice.
---
Got to store them, which will empty them and you'll have to set all your prices again. People can still buy from them if they aren't powered.
---
I had intestines everywhere and couldn't fig out from whence it came. Squirrels and rabbits.
---
Look around Vault 76 or the Overseers camp, there‚Äôs some spawns around there
---
I never knew they could be bought...this changes things
---
I'm flat out amazed at how many nukes are being dropped, and how many high level players came out of the woodwork for the update. That's really nice
---
It wouldn't matter because having Fallout in the name and not being Fallout 2 clone is crime against humanity according to these morons.
---
Wait to you see the price üòÇ
---
Not even close xD
---
Of course, but it's not that there is a camp nearby. But that it keeps joining the same server when I choose to find a new world.
---
I don't mind the non-solo challenges but I do mind the scout *quest* that requires you to revive somebody else.
---
Ahh, I have indeed captured a random workshop (think it was at an airport) and it did unlock a load of stuff. I shall take a look when I get home! Thanks for the advice :)
---
Thanks man!
---
Put the wire through a open door. Select replace. Replace it with non door wall.
---
Plus, Cow icon on map (South of Vault 76) and hill next to service entrance (Waterspring) that I can remember.
---
This is my current shop, and build. 
---

---
I'm sure it's pretty easy to locate, almost made max caps yesterday, my location helps out a lot. Right down the road from the Vault, open workshop, and bar upstairs.
---
My button for it is X, I don't remember if that's default or not. You just press it and it keeps moving forward until you press another directional button to cancel it. Although in this game it's not too effective because every ten steps there's a rock or tree or cliff in your way
---
I suspect many dormant players have been sat on their dragons hoard of wealth and loot, just waiting for vending to rear its head.
---
Finally their time has come to rule the wasteland as business tycoons.
---
No.  Read the patch notes for patch 9. You‚Äôre not joining the same server. There‚Äôs now a ‚Äúno camp zone‚Äù placed there. You‚Äôre camp needs to be moved.
---
Oh snap, I need to find this cave!
---
10mm is not a smaller caliber than 5.56, just putting that out there.
---
Sounds good, thank you for the info :)
---
It feels like it got changed completely. Either the lights were broken (game-wise or physically just shattered etc lamps) or not there at all before. Now there's a full array of proper lamps
---
The only one that seems toxic is you, bro.
---
It's by the trainstation :) I've never had it on the golf course
---
Heh, night is at different time at america and europe. So probably ingame night :P
---
How often do you see more than 24 players around you in MMO?
---
The mods didn‚Äôt add that in Fallout 4, only the legendary ones.
---
Similar thing happened to me a few days ago, pre-update. Logged in and half my quests were gone. I'm new, so figured there were some weekly resets I didn't know about. Then several hours and logins later, they were all back.
---
I‚Äôm really glad they added this feature, but it still reminds me that the tag for search feature is still buggy. It‚Äôs hard for me to pick up exact instances, but when tagging -especially cooking ingredients- I swear some other items get untagged.
---
I'll try that, thx
---
Two words that changed this event for me: tesla rifle.
---
Awesome, I really like seeing themed camps. Mines ontop of the cliff over wet tek. Needs some work to make it a coherent thing, looks abit mental atm with the outside of building covered in paintings!
---
Rad ant lager. High voltage hefe. Balistic bock. Tick blood tequila.
---
I'd pay 25 or 30 caps for em. Maybe more for that tequila.
---
Radnim almost there. I had my camp there for a while super well travelled for trading
---
Be kind. Rewind.  Having flashbacks now...
---
Well I just asked you if it was by the golf course and you replied ‚Äúof course‚Äù.  I‚Äôd check further into the ban area. I bet it‚Äôs rather large.
---
It's not like destroying your entire camp is subtle. And again, they can just destroy around it. If their intent is already to fuck your camp up, the locked door does nothing.
---
^this. Yup
---
I actually don't think the Brotherhood is hostile to non-feral ghouls as they are in later games. Most likely due to lack of interaction between the two. The only interaction I can remember is between the ghouls and the free states.
---
Mana-knife!
---
Weight.  The handmade has low recoil because it weighs about 16 tons.
---
You've gotten lucky it's given me 2 smore recipes, I will try more today I'm hoping this maintance fixes world challenges so i could try the event only. I don't think it's changes but I'm on Xbox.
---
Yeah, most probably. Now, armors and melee weapons do feel significantly weaker. It's actually a big change in game and how could they not include such an important bug fix in Patch Note, you know?
---
Please.
---
If it was a max level tse handmade, you could have gotten 25k for it
---
It's a perfect weapon for sharing kills. It likes to eat ammo tho haha
---
Ah okay guys it must be the stub barrel then!
---
My bad. I was so sure
---
Good call, I'm definitly gonna try that out.
---
I‚Äôve just taken a bunch of screenshots that are uploading to Xbox live, I‚Äôll post the link down below!
---
I‚Äôm definitely no pro, in fact my own living quarters and attic is quite baron; but I‚Äôm okay with that because I have the other areas that people will see and enjoy. I tried to do a budget motel incorporated but I couldn‚Äôt get the budget to work with what I envisioned.
---
As for the outside, I feel you. Mine *always* look plain and boring.
---
I found a guy on Xbox groups selling for 100
---
Yes, but taking fruits from another fields is not considered proper.
---
I know for a fact, that if I went to a farm in Pungo and picked a bunch of strawberries and tried to take them home without paying for any of them, then I would be stopped by the farmer and/or police.
---
If the farmer gave me a bucket of strawberries, that is being "helping each other".
---
But yes, people can get wanted by picking your crops.  No those growing wild on your land though.
---
It works. But it looks funny. The through all connectors the other commenter mentioned is the real way to do it.  But the door trick does work
---
I HAVE INSTRUMENTS ON THE BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE MONONGAH VALLEY, PLAY THOSE FUCKS AND ENJOY THE SCENERY
---
Witchcraft!
---
Found this comment whilst tryna dig up info on the tune on google, thanks for this! Deserved way more upvotes, massively slept on
---
Imo, yes. 
---
Not sure why; I'd guess they target limbs and thus your total DR has no effect. People say shoot the thrusters but that doesn't work most of the time; when they are onto you, one of their arms block out the thruster. Also they are round shooting them just a bit off-center deals fractional damage. Plus, some stagger perks make them spin around randomly so I either miss or deal fractional damage again.
---
Probably from maps, i am tring to find it in players vending machines haha.
---
In workshops maybe
---
Hum.  MODUS keeps bitching to me about people breaking the market.
---
Is yours not?
---
Follow the overseers quest line.  It will help keep you in level appropriate areas, and provide a lot of backstory for whats going on in the game.  
---
Stay in the forest until at least level 15.  
---
explore, explore, explore.
---
enjoy the graphics.
---
turn on pacifist mode
---
ignore most of the negative here, an enjoy the game..

Yes sorry, I missed that reading your reply the first time. I just qiut the game and restarted it and got into a new server. Maybe it's my internet not having enough juice to provide me a new server... I deleted the post, it's not that big of a problem as it has only happend twice before (on other locations).
---
This. I use a 1* quad auto for tagging/clearing trash mobs and I love it. It shreds even without commando perks and, while I don‚Äôt use it as a main weapon, I never seem to be short on cells. Plus people are often selling the ammo for way cheap.
---
lowest is 3500 no matter what
---
I doubt they are using a specific definition of tribalism to mean primitive.  Instead just the generic definition about how they are acting in a small group.
---
16 tonnes, but what do you get?
---
Tells you when quests are ready like BIV's quests etc. You can click on it and it goes to your on screen list of quests
---
Heh, I quit because all the players that visited my camp wanted to be Griefers.   Just got tired of the crap.   Figured if I wanted to play single player game, I would go play one.
---
Good luck with the possum challenges then.
---
If you can sell serums to the vendors for 400 caps, why would you sell them at your camp for less than that?  I‚Äôm selling them at 500 and they‚Äôre flying off the shelves
---
[deleted]
---
That is nice. 
---
I am not sure it is balanced however.
---
Being able to craft serum is a weird choice from bethesda.
---
Yeah and can our camps not be damaged now by asshats or that a future patch?
---
Yeah that's supposed to be the way but we gave up trying to match up the connectors on each side to make it power up. One of those "it sometimes works like this" things
---
Still better than a bowie lol
---
THANKS!! I think you were having trouble because of the auto stim perk. Haha you wouldn't die.
---
And then people who sell them for 100
---
No, it's Grm
---
Can I join you guys? I need to finish that one too.
---
I'll have to see if they fixed the damage bug from an automatic tesla rifle yet. Patch notes didn't say anything about it, but I get the feeling they want to pretend the damage bug doesn't exist anymore
---
Is there like a tutorial or anything? 
---
My last Fallout for PC was Fallout 3 back on it's release.
---
I almost gave you the obligatory downvotes that I give to all those kinds of posts...
---
Well I have some real shitty bugs and glitches happening still so maybe if this was the BETA
---
Yo, someone else helped me but if you want I could give you have if you need just hmu
---
Sure, IGN is bencebacsi, add me, online now
---
I like that there is no diamond, but damn, would it hurt for an in game hint lol.  Searched 10 mins before looking it up.
---
Oh thank god thank you so much!
---
Berserker build in survival will need this
---
I love the "I was lucky, why don't you just stop being unlucky?" answers. I'm in the same boat.
---
No actually I wasn't have this, just was have shielded bos. I manually used stimpak for prevent insta die. I don't know why grenades don't kill me lol.
---
Depends on the legendary. A lvl 12 selling legendaries is a mule for a much more experienced player/trader. I have a full stash of legendaries on a lvl 5 character. Any bloodied/twoshot/furious explosive weapons would be worth at least 10k and if a sought after base weapon, more. Any unyielding 3* armor is worth 6-8k as long as the second and third effect are not completely useless. Any unyielding sent/cav armor is worth way more than 10k.
---
Yeah people are into this aspect of game play aren't they. I'm seeing so few events triggered lately as people just stand around chewing the fat at vending machines haha
---
How bad is it? Or do you know where the plans can be looted? I'm still trying to google, but no luck
---
Play an instrument.
---
Gotta make donations to the RNG GOD and pray for it to drop then haha
---
I built mine originally floating out over a cliff until I had the budget to go back and add the support pillars (bottom selection under stairs).
---
So last night I spent time going around the outer edge adding in long support columns from the camp to the ground. Still not perfect but looks much better with the support.
---
One thing that would be nice if there was a diagonal support beam that could be added under a camp that came out from the side of a cliff.
---
And forgot to say, you're welcome then.
---
Head over to the Giant Teapot. Server hop for 5 minutes. Loot the tourist corpse. It really is that easy :)
---
I've built my base dozens of times. Always use a pass thru connector to go thru walls. Never had an issue.
---
Place one on the inside with the nipple thru the wall first. Then attach the inside connector. Attach wire. Done
---
Go have a look mate don't spoil the surprise. Don't forget hard bargain and grape metants
---
Larger diameter, but shorter case length and its not as high pressure as 5.56. Both calibers out of a long gun should be very controllable though, but I can't speak from experience on 10mm in a carbine.
---

---
New player.. Just got into Ash Heap yesterday and was thinking the same thing. Looks fantastic. Plus sounds, etc.. I thought to myself, best Fallout environment ever
---
&gt; is there a way to target the specific mutation you want to rid??
---
It would also be nice if you could make a counter offer .... Then the seller gets a notification and can decide to reduce his price
---
Thank you all for the insight!
---
I found it quickly at Mothman Statue.
---
Yeah I know... I just always wanted a full on actual tribal theme in a Fallout game on par with the Honest Hearts dlc from NV
---
I got a bloodied 90% reduced weight hunting rifle for 1000 caps and a bloodied crossbow for 100 caps yesterday, god bless these people who don't know how to price
---
Added you, though I am nit sure if it went through
---
I don't want mine to. I leave my door locked in case ghouls or wildlife attack, but I want to leave it open if players drop by.
---
Bold of you to assume normal parameters means control Vault.
---
You need help right now?
---
Yeah you bought just the skin.  You need to earn the pack through the quests
---
Depends on the stars really, people don't want to sell 3-stars too cheap because you can exchange them for legendary scrap. Bloodied 1-stars can sell for a few hundred, ghoul slayer and similar sell for basically nothing
---
I live on a billboard. It's a cool location (includes cats!), but I put minimal effort into it. Now I gotta step up my game!
---
Yes I guess I just have more than the average inside my house but I feel like its not alot. Just wish this update would have brought on a bit more space in the budget.
---
The True Struggles. *Hugs*
---
Oops. My bad...
---
Why do you purposely mock me?
---
And why do you find it funny to yourself to encourage the idea to mock me? For not being very smart?
---
Yeah I was like that when the game first came out, just happily handing out aid and power armor frames and anything you needed. Then the bad stuff happened. I became a recluse. I hid and only hunted at night. My camp was a hole in the wall with no lights, just scarecrows. But someone friended me and helped me know there are still nice people in the game and I came out of my hole and now I'm giving stuff away again but I'm cautious, see, real cautious...
---
It spoils
---
Not wasted, there is still an in-game challenge to hold one of each magazine. Pass them off to a friend so they can progress it or turn sound and sell them again.
---
Mothman posters
---
There‚Äôs ALOT more to do.  It‚Äôs much more stable than before.
---
I think he meant to reply to OP, who mentioned Air Force BMT (basic military training) in his post.
---
Lol, THAT list :)
---
Can't even remember to have seen that syrup after 187 levels, and where the he.. do we get  Razorgrain flour :D
---
I made my base with a main building and a courtyard so I could grow plants inside and not have random mobs constantly destroying them. I always had a couple turrets but ranged mobs would just shoot the plans from outside the turrets range.
---
I think most people who bought the game are still playing it. The ones who quit for various reasons are the minority.
---
Isn't there a terminal log where MODIUS communicates with a ZAX?
---
Doesn‚Äôt exist
---
Another day older and deeper in debt
---
i would think no one is talking about it becuae you have more than enought time to leave the server.
---
been away for a long time, didn't they nerf them into almost uselessness?
---
typical :/
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
I‚Äôve also gotten this week legendary - however I‚Äôve been unable to put in my stashbox - anyone else got this problem?
---
Do you need to unlock those or does everyone have them?
---
They should just let us buy legendary effects and let us place it on crafted weapons
---
Well yes if you want to get into the technicality of it, a 5.56 is a higher pressure round, but that's because you're doing an apples to oranges rifle vs pistol caliber spec.
---
On the flat though, still not incorrect to say 10mm is not a smaller caliber, which was the only point I was making.
---
Hi there! Please do not lump all Americans together :)
---
Just randomly looked for this since I want a camp with a junk extractor and access to water and here we go :) Much thanks :)
---
Im not sure what "scout badge" they where trying to earn ü§®ü§î
---
Yea, I have been having to enter/exit build mode several time to get it to work.
---
Syrup is made from tree mucus and sugar, razorgrain flour is made with razorgrain, concrete and can't remember the 3rd ingredient.
---
You can also server hop Harpers Ferry for the plans too! Just don‚Äôt pick up any other plans if it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre looking for, that way server hopping actually works. When you fast travel to harpers ferry, that building with the broken brick wall ahead of you should spawn 2 armor plans (one on ground floor, one on second floor)
---
A \*\* TSE shouldn't really go beyond 8-10K.
---
People are so blindly fooled by the TSE. Why would you want that on a sniper rifle, for example, instead of an Instigating VATS accuracy? You one shot them in the head from 200 meters.
---
Selling to a vendor bot gets you over 400 caps with hard bargain perk and grape mentats, I can't understand why people would sell cheaper than that...
---
Saint peter dont you call me cause i cant go
---
It's 1500 over your capacity, if you can carry 300,youre maxed at 1800.
---
Extremely good point üòÇ
---
Such a bummer! That‚Äôs ok though, I‚Äôll wait for story/content to drop for now. Thank you!! üòä
---
Duping won't stop, it will always be a thing.
---
Know of any other skill 0 terminals?
---
its a bit different that previous FO's, but it still fallout.  
---
Depends on how you want to play - discover on your own, get help when needed, or have it all handed to you.  
---
  You learn the history of what happened in Appalachia via notes, holotapes, and more than a few (static) visual displays.  
---
Some of the latter won't mean anything until later, some are easter eggs, references to other FO's, some are just plain funny.
---
Oh, and always read the wooden blocks.
---
Theres paper guides, online guides, lots of different opinions on certain aspects can be found here.  Theres another forum (fo76filthycasuals) thats usually a bit lighter than this one can be.
---
Well you see in the Wastlands you never know what your looking at, since it could be anything from a health condition to something unknown
---
Squirrels almost always spawn on the hill in front of the Whitesprings service entrance and on the grassy area to the left of entrance of whitesprings where there are flowers. Just spam vats
---
I hope so! (Though I‚Äôm really enjoying the game already.)
---
Bloody explosive gatling laser. Its a giant angry unicorn that spits explosions.
---
I bought an anti armor explosive hand made for 15k yesterday.  Worth it to me
---
Play Fallout 2.
---
Saw him last night; he wandered along the road past my house (route 81, near Billings Homestead), and about 10 minutes later wandered back the other way, muttering to himself.  Chally was nowhere to be seen however.
---
I'm level 73 and have come across the pair of them maybe 10 or 12 times.
---
I just use Windows with glass.
---
It could be like the super mutants only 1 gender
---
I mean..... rose and grahm are my favorite npcs and they‚Äôre already in the game.
---
There's nothing that LMG won't mow down in three seconds flat.
---
Tree mucus, concrete and bone, I knew s‚Äômores were unhealthy but jeez! üòÇ
---
Same here, no solution?
---
we're allowed on both :)
---
A bully who doesn't like to be bullied. Is there a name for that? Hmmm
---
Have you seen the one at the golf course? 
---
(not WS, the one on the forest)
---
LOL nice! I have a few items in my stall that are way overpriced just in the event that somebody really wants dog food.
---
I refuse to eat mine.  I've had parasites, the collywobbles, you name it.  Starving.  Will not eat my perfect pie.
---
If you server hop at the whitesprings resort, the second you spawn in you look slightly right and if ansel isn't on the red car just server hop again
---
I owe my soul to the legendary scrip machine.
---
Can you put our autostim please?
---
Can you sell plans?
---
Fuck I feel old
---
Since Camps are now immune, I am watching workshops for the A$$hats on my list, every time I log on to a new server, I check the Recent list against my "Shit list"
---
Oh. I didn't know this one. Thanks!
---
Then I would like to totally agree with you! Would be cool attachments!
---
Ungrateful
---
You CANT sell them, trade them or drop them!!
---
Sorry about that, MASSIVE THANKS :)
---
Ignoring that the console graphics are potato quality compared to PC, have you actually tried building one of every item, or are you just guessing that it works fine on a console?
---
If you're too lazy or incompentent to make an effort to search one of the hundreds of postings asking the exact same thing, the problem is with you, not anyone else.
---
And then calling someone *else* an immature child??
---
The player vending made the interaction go through the roof. I hear people talking more than I've heard in a couple months. It's nice. I'm usually solo but I'm not against a good conversation. Met some nice people of all ages on there.
---
Oh you are welcome. :)
---
No, it's Gr
---
No depreciation on that!
---
Came out in May of 2000 (Marshall Mathers LP). I feel ya on that one haha.
---
That is not currently a feature of Fallout76, nor do I see it it talked about in any of the release notes. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è People grab plants from wherever pretty much whenever, currently. Same with unlocked water, resource collectors, etc.
---
Wait did they add like an Auction House or something? I havent played in months
---
Hahaha I was more thinking the FTFY.
---
Highly, it has quite the kick!
---
Try the swarm of suitors challenge.
---
That one spawned 4 or so little critters when I did it....
---
Fixed That For You
---
Congratulations? I haven‚Äôt spent a penny on this game after the ¬£8 I got it for, and my camp is bitchin‚Äô so you must be doing something wrong
---
Oh yes!!
---
120 items, means you have 4 fully filled vending machines... I'm guessing you play this game a lot. And you server hop to try to take items from noobs who don't know the value of items they have. 
---
You know at some point you have to think that when a game gives you such vast number of flexibility and possibilities, it is up to you to make the game fun for yourself. Noone is telling you to server hop to try and cheat the system. 
---
Giving it a 3/10 and trashing it only to continue just seems counterproductive.
---
I spent sooooo many hours doing the quizzes yesterday without your answers. I actually passed out early last night I was so exhausted. Thank you for doing this for others.
---
Haha uh oh I've been found out XD Also yes! (and it may not come as a surprise that I enjoy running Whispering Ice Builds)
---
More redactions than a genuinely interesting SCP.
---
Brahmin are good eating. Good milking too. Best think is to milk them before you kill them. Otherwise the milk is more of a strawberry flavor.
---
yup, seen it, can't remember where, but there are more. the little things you can find,if you take your time to look. Wouldn't suprise me if a.n.other designer on the team,is asking "what IS that ?". For me, adds SO MUCH to this game. Or the teddy bears - in places which are near NOTHING, way out in the boonies and heres 2 teddy bears sitting on a rock.
---
It's so you can end him rightly!
---
Did you craft the ammo yourself? Learning the Prime Plan for any weapon also includes learning the corresponding ammo, if someone else did the Mod, and crafted the ammo, there could be issues with that.
---
This is why people find it frustrating.. it‚Äôs not a backpack challenge. It‚Äôs a fun challenge that happens to reward you with a backpack. I think if you focussed on enjoying the challenges rather than racing to the reward you might get more enjoyment and playtime out of the game as a whole.
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
just one of many you will run across :)
---
that one showed up for me while I was still in the PA station.  We killed each other....when I respawn in, another player had entered the building, and the dang thing respawned....
---
I think those are atom shop ones, yeah
---
r/nocontext
---
Bethesda has confirmed that it's not in the game by accident and they're going to be releasing it next week
---
It's so rare too
---
Its around the middle of the map.
---
and
---
make sure you have on your clown outfit. :)
---
Lighter weapons usually suffer from recoil. An extreme example would be the Mac-10.
---
I‚Äôve found a few robot plans over at treetops.
---
Sweet
---
Still sets a new low for gaming
---
Companies shouldn't treat their base like trash
---
ü§£
---
If you had it up to date before this update, it‚Äôll be whatever the patch notes say it will be.
---
I hope this remains a thing and maybe Bethesda adds a voice line to a venderbot.
---
Results of running on 48 hours no sleep. Not intentionally I tried to go to sleep within the carbon monoxide detectors went off. So by the time I was doing the videos I was almost seeing double lol
---
I was the same way with the shooting range in the archery test, way too tired lol
---
Shhhh!
---
Lol! this weirdo is still messaging on a post that is done with. Hung up and still replying. So I‚Äôm just entertaining it now rather than taking it personally! I‚Äôm sure I will get a reply to this there is no doubt. He just can‚Äôt stop himself üòÇ he is seeking the last word on an opinion that is not of the majority here. I Looking at his history of comments on his profile, it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs used to writing novels. Lol! Not taking his insults of me as a gal personally such as calling me ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù to Bethesda. Again I am just laughing at the weight of his insults. Because whiny or coercive is just the opposite of what Bethesda and Sony have said after they saw the video of the in-game incident. They and the person I spoke to stand behind my original post :) they also read and support the massive positive response I have received in game and on Reddit. They matter more than his menial replies that hold absolutely no relevance to the support and friendly opinion here. His reply here will simply be downvoted, reported, and removed again. Stay off my post. No ones reading it anymore. Until then, I‚Äôm going to simply keep replying to him until he decides to do the right thing and block me. That way he‚Äôll at least think he‚Äôs gotten the last word üòÇ
---
it's not super huge, however it does take like 2hrs to initially install the game.
---
I still say this update opened up a huge player interaction thing that wasn't there before. It was there but just needed a little push to really open it up. I mean some just play the game and then some actually get in to it aka Sims type life. I dunno if that's where they are going but it's awesome. I love post apocalyptic games and movies so, to me, this is an awesome step. I just wish sometimes there were more on. I'm a solo player but I do like interactions sometimes.
---
If you told me I'd still be playing this game after the release mess I wouldn't believe it. I just couldn't give up on a fallout game, yet.
---
If its a digital copy that you're downloading, it's probably going to be about 62-63 GB Download, but that will include everything that's been added to the game thus far. My wife had to redownload 76 on her new XB1 last night.  
---
If its a disc, then it'll be about 50gb install of the disc to the harddrive. And about 6 GB - 10 GB download of updates, I'm honestly unsure of this part.. as it's been a far while since I installed my copy of 76. Sorry I can't be anymore help mate.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be only obtained in survival mode, by completing the corresponding weekly challenge. Bethesda messed it up this week and it‚Äôs now able to be earned in adventure mode too.
---
Doh! I forgot about that and decimated at least 500 ghouls and scorched and my crossbow is still 25% over repaired, no amount of bash damage could help with that. Thank for this comment!
---
You completed the weekly challenge for that weapon. It could be completed in either adventure (likely a bug) or survival. You had to build a turret, claim a workshop, and kill a humanoid creature.
---
Yep. They are all over. Found one in Flatwoods Ag center yesterday.
---
We got on today and the server disconnected a couple times. Logged back and was reverted to the last location a few minutes earlier (I assume with items intact). My friend was in same server and he got kicked too. I'm pretty sure it's still happening. They have a way to crash it, friend disconnects with traded/dropped item and the crasher gets the item back in the revert.
---
The issue is in the revert. If they could update the items held in realtime, seems there's a bit of a delay to the database. The server crashes and the db has old information. Probably harder than it seems. Maybe an second program that collects items held in rt, and if they crash the main, updates the db? Or even a check with items dropped or traded, if the receiver of item logs, it updates both the buyer and sellers db.
---
You on ps4? I'd love to hit up those 12c plans.
---
**no and stop cheatin!!!**
---
Apparently adventure mode is earning survival achievements right now, it will probably be fixed shortly I haven't looked though so don't know an idea as to when
---

---
Because I can write novels too ;)
---
Yeah, and dead ends as well. I found a few Responder Corpses wearing Firefighter gear based Responder outfits which I'm sure were never there previously either.
---
Lol I bet so.
---
I took a break (not going to say quit) back in January and just came back, I had issues where I'd disconnect nearly every time I zoned.  Went on to play some other games while things got sorted out, but I kept myself mostly in the loop on updates so I didn't need to post any questions.
---
That said, I think with the improvements and the need for "new blood" in the game I don't think we should be too hard on posts like that, don't want the reason people don't try the game to be because of the community.
---
To clarify, my camp is fine. My C.A.M.P. is what is missing.
---
Not something more reasonable. 60 gig at launch before you can play.dont know what it is now.
---
It is a pun, not a real word when used as a verb.  The legendary purveyor takes your legendaries and gives you ‚Äúscrip‚Äù‚Äîa word meaning non-governmental paper money.   But the items appear to be ‚Äúscrapped ‚Äú‚Äîdestroyed.   So the noun ‚Äúscrip‚Äù and the verb ‚Äúscrap‚Äù are conflated‚Äîsubstituted or mixed together‚Äîbecause they happen at the same time and the words conveniently sound alike.
---
Ugh. Bummer if true.
---
It's a pure visual glitch in the trade menu, I tested it out right after patch 9 and reported it to bethesda. If you try to sell them you get the error "trade failed on server", if you leave the trade menu and go into your pipboy you will see the (normal) real number of items,  It's only annoying...
---
No i didn't but i cant wait to add that pic to my collection, i feel like im roleplaying a character from xfiles
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar sir.
---
Well, thing is.. It's not. It's changed completely. I've played since the B.E.T.A and I can tell you, there was never a basement area. It's been changed drastically.. and I say.. I like it.
---
I'd love that.
---
It's soooooo bright.... and beautiful.... and Blooooddyyyy ... Myyyy Eyeeesss!!
---
Well, I don't see how it wouldn't be unless Bethesda is pulling a really big con on people looking at the files, but I doubt it given how many lines there are.
---
Great work man! Ty for sharing
---
I really dont hope they nerf it. Yeah its good dmg but since the armor nerf its even a bigger tradeoff .
---
almost makes me wish for something else than a nuclear winter
---
At first I was like what on earth are you on about.. Then I Realized I was dying of hunger. Well played good sir, you've made my evening. Bravo!
---
I have one just SE of the Pylon Cabin by a black titanium ore vein.  If you are on ps4 running the imposter sheepsquatch event stop by.  I have all the crops and workbenches you need plus the extractor is unlocked.
---
Agree, i love the little mysteries i just wish there was really a way to solve the mystery. Like the ear tag on the sheepsquatch, who was breeding and raising them... and why??.
---
What i found weird on fo4 where all the manechins in here it's the gnomes, why in god name to they giggle when you pick them up. WHY?
---
Nope. It was recently added as of Patch 9. Don't worry, my mind was blown as well. as I wondered through going, I swear to Atom, I don't remember this basement being here.
---
Nice! 
---
I'm trying do decipher the loot drop system for months now; what is your Luck/Charisma and did you have or stashed Two shot and/or Explosive legendary weapons before this? Approximately how many legendary drops did you have during this 630 hours?
---
One of the additions from this patch was the Legendary Exchange Machine. The machine allows you to throw away your unwanted legendary gear, in exchange for "scrip". Each star, and I believe the level, will influence how much scrip you get in return. The cap is 150 per day. It's a currency that you can use towards the new legendary trader that's coming... next week I believe?
---
14 so far for me. Working on my second full pie.
---
Shame, there was almost an even rewards foe pvp and pve üòÇ
---
Ditto
---
Try whitesprings. When you walk up from the entrance near the railroad station, they sometimes spawn in the side of the building where the patio is. Sometimes near the bunker entrance too
---
Get me one of those Free States doors.
---
Yeah, that stumped me as well. 'Til I went back to the room with the Responder wearing the Police uniform and found &gt;!the keycard in her hand!&lt;. Well played Bethesda.
---
If you go NE of there you can find a black titanium vein which is where Im camped
---
Don't worry.. I never realized they had added it as well, 'til I reread the patch notes. And was like "Oh 'Thesda you pulled a lil' sneaky on us" as I didn't remember ever seeing it there. And later found out, they forgot to make mention of it. :P
---
You have items, they do you little to no good, and take up space. They earn you 0 caps.
---
You put them in machine for 1 c each. They now make you 100 percent profit.
---
I know, now I gotta go see.
---
Sure, that'll be 1200 atoms
---
Increase carry weight mod gives +120lbs and reduce enegy and radiation rezistances by 60.

Fridge mod  have reduced carry weight to +30lbs and your thing spoils slower, dont stack with that salty perk.
---
I think next will indeed be bloodied. The whole concept of that bloodied builds to me personally feel rather strange and out of place.
---
leave meat and other degradable materials lyin around to attract insects to gnaw on the brahmin then leave oily rags and acid and such around to make the insects sick which will attack predators to eat the excess bugs
---
my assumption is if it's spawning inside a building nothing you put down from your camp is gonna stop the spawn, it'll prolly just spawn on top of whatever you put down or get stuck in it, might be best to move .. or follow my previous suggestion
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/4dTgqgD) it is, featuring the descriptions used when I uploaded to r/fallout76settlements
---
What are you calling a basement in these pics?
---
Took me 10 server hops at the Giant Teapot by the picnic tables. The bucket list quest took 20min. Good luck!
---
Removed? In less than 5 minutes...
---
This is where I got mine too after waiting at the teapot.
---
Excellent!
---
there was only about 5 or so from the entire time ive been playing (since day 1) so far 99.9% of the people i run into have been super nice or at least not bothered me.
---
Can you give the Plan to me? Im on pc
---
Okay thanks I'll take a look
---
It would be amazing.
---
It feels like such an oversight to me; especially when you consider that the ***Combat Shotgun*** has a suppressor.
---
You're welcome! So just find a random and team on up.
---
What the hell? I'm not in violation of any rules as far as I'm aware.
---
Thanks. good info
---
Thought as much. I‚Äôm just holding onto mine to swap it for a decent melee weapon of equal quality.
---
I think people are so drawn to it because of its appearance tbh.
---
Crit headshot a guy with my Dragon in survival mode. No damage. I don't think this nerf did much.
---
Filthy milk drinkers
---
Player vending machines, build-able at your camp.
---
Power connector on rug. Connect from generator to power connector. Select rug, move it a few inches and place it down again. Again select it, and now you can place it anywhere you like ;)
---
I think that when/if it happens I will leave the game.  Since January almost all of my equipment has slowly converted to bloodied.   I would be irritated by having to redo it all to Antiarmored.
---
Its not an even playing field. You STILL have a extreme damage reduction advantage over anyone not running assassins/sentinels. Stop pretending like it doesn't do anything just because it cut a bit back.
---
I always find one at the water park, anywhere else, I haven‚Äôt.
---
Dang is this really worth it tho? Your losing out on quite a bit of storage space.
---
Bought an AAE Combat shotgun for 10k, and flipped it for 25k in 5 minutes.
---
Why didn't I think of that! It was on the desk right behind me!
---
Sad thing is you can‚Äôt sell these cameras on vendors.  I fixed 2 up figuring I could help people out (for a tiny profit) and no go on the vendor station.
---
Nice! What about the Insulated or w/e?
---
Not everyone is on reddit or the Discord though, so value is subjective. Someone might buy it, it might just take a while.
---
Yeah trust me I did it at first also! Glad I could help
---
I think the other one is news cuz it talks about the legendary machines.
---
You sir have done your research. Love all of these weird weapons!
---
Great job
---
What I meant is that saying "we can't do this because we took bad decisions" is quite a shitty argument.
---
FEV experimentation?
---
The bears squeak when you pick them up, too :)
---
I almost bought the old man effigy (that badass bonfire) for 3k I really think that‚Äôs overpriced but I‚Äôve never seen someone selling it &amp; I skipped that event :-/ right when I made my mind I was gonna buy it the dude logged out &amp; I fell through his base lmao
---
Can you tell, if I have 0 rad resist it would be -60 or 0 with mod?
---
No can do, I'm speed running all the camps in Appalachia like it's a black Friday sale.
---
a neat trick is you can place the triangle wall pieces right over the wire, so make a section with a sloped roof and leave the triangle piece out, run the wire to the outside then slap the triangle piece on and BAM achievement unlocked! EPIC BUILDER!!!&lt;echo&gt; &lt;echo&gt;
---
or yeah buy the advanced power connectors and run a pipe
---
I found one at Wade Airport in a toolbox in a hangar, the one with 3 super mutants in it.
---
Why not?  I play the game, enjoy farming for the mats required.  I've already got 425,000 caps, why over charge for them?
---
18K caps for a TSE.  I must have about 100k+ worth of caps in my weapons cache.  I have 3 handmade rifles.  One of them is an AAE 3 star, one is a 2 star hardened w/explosive effects with large magazine and another is a 1 star.  I love them.  The 1 star is sneaky good vampire with suppressor and auto fire w/25 mag clip that I bought that from a dude about 2 months ago for 500 caps.  
---
My issue is I‚Äôm capped out (25k).  Pun intended.
---
Game night.
---
But the issue is the game never gets very dark to me, so I keep missing it if I don't keep looking at the pipboy clock.
---
Explosive is not optimal for tagging as it does not arc.
---
I dont have that mod, so i cant test. Would be good for bersekers  build.
---
Doesn‚Äôt stack with the salty perk?! Wooow you better get some major refrigeration from the mod.. anyone have it &amp; can share any info? Does it last much longer from what you notice?
---
No, the parallel is it‚Äôs easier to get laid with the one cow at home than to chase the young moos around town
---
Damn, i'm getting a physical copy and i'm pretty sure that it is a launch copy i mean i offered like 45% the price they were asking and they accepted
---
I have a spare Prosnap camera if anyone wants it. (assuming the game will let me trade cause i cant drop it)
---
bet he devs laugh them self silly.
---
but seriously, the gnomes giggled ?. now i have to reinstal fo4,aw shucks,never did the nuka world anyway...............................oh oh, the pads on ps4 word differently - stimpack button     ...aw bugger.
---
Someone else commented on this earlier, said Bethesda was "working on it".
---
Click the link
---
I like this. Its not just advantajes
---
Thanks, we all got to do our part to make this a better game!
---
Yup. He talks to the ZAX that becomes "President" in Fallout 3.
---
I miss him
---
Kill everything around the cabins. Although for me only the cabin with the robot marked the objective as complete.
---
Interesting i moved my camp with full vending machine and everything was in stash later.
---
Unless the owner is nearby, u can‚Äôt inspect the item. 
---
Guess it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Cool idea, but maybe not Caravan.
---
... How the -f- do you have that many caps?
---
Isn't there a hard limit? And how did you get that many?
---
Thanks and good info
---
If you are using for tagging, do any if your choices offer faster fire rate?
---
&gt;a knife but without a blade
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
Or like a pager in a sense on the pipboy?
---
I just put a 2 star radium rifle up for sale for 400 caps.  I have a 3 star nocturnal laser pistol was thinking of putting up for 500 caps.  Maybe I need to jack up the prices lol
---
I think Bethesda said that they changed the inside to better reflect the fight between the Responders and Scorched. I think that may have been in the patch notes
---
How you get a lightsaber op?
---
There aren‚Äôt 10 cows in flatwoods, there are like 4 and chances are only 2 will let you milk them. And also the milk cycle doesn‚Äôt reset once you log out and log back in, you have to wait just like with everything now. Just like you can‚Äôt loot a building and switch servers anymore and loot it again. Same with cows except your cow
---
That's weird, I expect there are cool downs, but hard to tell
---
Oh, that's very good to know... Thank you.
---
I moved it again afterward, forgetting I had machines, and It was fine
---
Pretty epic
---
It's raider armor, honestly I'm surprised the light version isn't available by default.
---
i bought one for 1200 and now i feel like ive been scammed XD
---
9 charisma, 6 luck, i had 2 TSEs and 3 that are just TS on my character when i got these drops (sold the assault rifle to another player before getting the revolver), and i have no clue how i would even start estimating the amount of legendaries i killed in this many hours.....
---
Do we know if we will get our stuff back?
---
Probably because it looks exactly like a suppressor from the 80s.
---
It's in the game. Same place as where the Nuka Cola paint plans are.
---
I have it, but that need some datamining. There is no numbers, one of my post from today have picture from armor workbench. I think i wasted 8badged for science..... Now i am still grinding that event but oh my god for some reason i DC or get bluescreen so much times at end of event.
---
Nice
---
Well prior to patch 9.0 you could, now to find a broken one..
---
I'm sitting on my porch watching, people check out my workshed - but nobody comes in my painstakingly decorated lodge!
---
Glad to know it's not normal. I was so confused upon receiving it.
---
You just gave me an idea. üòà
---
Is there any chance there will be available again in the future?  I really wanted war, but didn‚Äôt know about these, and have not been playing regularly, so I missed it.
---
Hunting rifles have all of a sudden become semi decent weapons again.  I just picked one up yesterday.
---
STARBURST LINOLEUM
---
You gotta pay the Troll Toll If You Wanna Get Into That Boy's soul You gotta pay the Troll Toll To get in!
---
I have seven. I saw someone had one for sale at their camp, wanted 10000 caps for it!
---
Lewisburg has one.
---
Same here, minimal effort. Maybe today if I recall I'll talk a photo and send it to you
---
hope you got a good internet. mine is 2mb/s tops, had to leave it overnight, and god help those that don't have an unlimted download cap.
---
1 respec point per level and you have to chose from respec point or perk card. Can't  have both
---
You can milk, scrap, rebuild and milk again? Wow that‚Äôs crazy
---
This certainly explains the state of society. I hope all the cheaters at least remember some of the answers.
---
I'd assume it's a hard no, Bethesda doesn't seem to care/ have access to individual items unless they're deleting them. Sorry for your loss, I have only been putting plans in mine until I know it will work properly
---
Thanks, just trying whitesprings
---
One spawn for Ansel with the camera is right outside the Whitespring entrance, on the red car you pass just before you go inside (main entrance, not the bunker or the train station). He's draped across the hood of the car if he's there.
---
Try server hopping there for a bit, see if it comes up for you.
---
Ah ok then thanks
---
Go to bethesdas support page
---
Ah okay thank you!
---
People do that more than makes any damn sense..  
---
The trolls hate anyone trying to improve the game, and the "diehards" hate anything remotely critical of Bethesda. Hell my bug posts used to get 5 to 10 downvotes before a single Upvote.
---
Keep posting them and submitting reports, and if it gets missed feel free to shoot me a message or better yet tag me, until I burn out plan to keep these going.
---
1.  I'm semi-retired so I have lots of time. (age 47, 25yr army vet)
---
2. I have 4 kids that play (ages 22,18,14,12), each has their own account, so 5 accounts in the family total)
---
3. In the "gaming room/mancave" I can run 3 accounts (xboxes) at once so muleing caps to said accounts is easy.  
---
4. Last time I checked (1 month ago) between the 5 accounts we had 1,800 total hours.
---
5. Me and my 14 year old run Trading Camps, I sell the serums (Aid), he sells the gear (armor/weapons)
---
Thank you good wastelander
---
My gt is laidbackleo87 message me when your on and we can meet at the Pioneer camp and take care of that challenge for you, my tse shotgun is perfect for downing myself.
---
I live out in BFE otherwise known as bottom right corner of the map
---
I actually landed a stalkers 2 star minigun as a drop at Whitesprings last night.  Also a couple of 3 star armor pieces in the same spot a little later. I was like what?!?!
---
I‚Äôve played for weeks and not gotten one drop like that.
---
What‚Äôs the frog jar and frog habitat. Have you tried going to a train station and looking at the poster.
---
Good info, will try it out!
---
If only any online community could be trusted with such a tool.
---
you put your prized weapon ..................................................................in a vending machine ?..................................................................................................?
---
ALL ITEMS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OFF TODAY ONLY
---
You may have to sacrifice a few walls and all your turrets, and maybe your brahman pen :P
---
They could fabricate another card game I‚Äôm sure. I wonder if there are any card games played by miners? Or any that originate from W.V?
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs different. Say if you have something you really really don‚Äôt want them to destroy, you can put it in a building, with a locked door inside of another layer of walls with a second locked door. So they now have to pick two locked doors before they get to that item or they have to destroy your walls to get to it. If the doors aren‚Äôt locked they can just walk right up to that item and start destroying it directly which gives you less time to reacts and fast travel
---
That's what the bulk of my sales have been. I've been hoarding plans waiting for this moment!
---
ive got a few mutations going for a lovely 999 caps :) loads of weapons and armor too at reasonable prices - find me on ps4 north east of whit springs station
---
There were rumors they were going to change the way fast travel worked with enemies near by, didn't see anything in the patch notes, but I'll reread them.
---
I‚Äôm just saying to me that‚Äôs a lot more disturbing than framerates. To be fair I don‚Äôt notice framerates at all until they get literally a slideshow (I mean seconds per frame and the game starts skipping some to try to catch up to what is happening). And anyways performance is honestly my least concern with a game (if it is good enough I‚Äôm fine or if the game is fun enough I‚Äôm pretty forgiving. I expect bethesda games to be janky and usually really enjoy them so it doesn‚Äôt bug me as much. Hell, I was not near as bothered by launch as everyone else though since bethesda it didn‚Äôt feel unexpected how the game ran at launch. I only said this here cause if we are talking performance that‚Äôs what bugs me the most. It bugs me enough to actually bug me, put it that way).
---
I have to keep 80 GB of free space available on my PS4 to download any updates even though the update may only be a fraction of that amount (digital copy of base game). If I try with less, I get the download error about not enough free space on my system. It doesn‚Äôt use up the 80 GB, as it‚Äôs still free after it installs. Just letting you know to be aware of that. I may be a strange case though, so you may have different results.
---
Yea that‚Äôs confirmed
---
I prefer to leave in on the doorstep with a Molotov or lighter inside. They'll figure it out.
---
Oh wow. I may have to get back into it
---
It is much more stable and much less buggy.  In my view it is obsessively fun.
---
That crept in around patch 7 I think, it's a PIA to replicate, and usually clears with a reload, but I'll include it this time around!
---
I did that for 30 minutes didn‚Äôt find him went over to the cemetery in toxic valley to grab a BPR to go radstag hunting and immediately found him lol
---
Crits already ignore the effects of this armor. Sounds like you missed or that didnt happen.
---
Speaking of that, the mammologist challenge where you milk cows is working just fine so I suggest that
---
You can just go to the train station next door
---
They might, or just not properly save.
---
Yeah, the debuff for cancer is really harsh.
---
His post did say how his camp was set up under a bridge but he edited it out lol
---
Admin login on the sale terminal with sales receipts would be cool
---
Why discourage these posts?   Welcome those who are considering trying out the game again.
---
Hell grateful to anyone that includes helpful info to narrow down bugs, so thanks right back at you!
---
Yah! I had my fun with it, I loved her, but I found better, I wanted to keep her, but she was just too heavy. ;-;
---
Actually, it's east of the lookout tower and slightly west of the camp on a hill.
---
The server I was on last night had three camps grouped up as close as possible to each other in the Mire. It felt like a real homestead, it was like a ten second walk between houses, and each was sending different items.
---
I don't think so. . . I see it as balanced quite well. Yes you put up great dmg numbers, but this comes at the cost of 80% of your health pool. Can't get much more balanced than that. If you're running bloodied and are smart, you're focusing your points in Defense. To make that last 20% of health hard as hell to move. Iirc looking at my resistances last night I'm at 605 dmg and 415 Eng resist when I'm at or under 20% health.
---
Yes boys! I finally found 1 by Whitespring bunker :) Thanks for all your help :)
---
I don‚Äôt know any miner card games, but I do know that Caravan wouldn‚Äôt exist in the Fallout universe yet.
---
How about some frame modifications for crossbows, too? The standard frame is boring.
---
Yeah...i gave a ton of cosmetic CAMP plans away to a level 15 like 2 weeks ago. But I have accumulated quite a bit more since. Maybe people will buy them. I usually just give them away lol
---
Same here 125-150 and literally the first day of vending my wife and i sold 200 serums.
---
It does now, I'll share the picture later.
---
But I mean, I don't need power armor constantly. It takes up space, then th power cores and farming stuff. What if I could just rent a full set of armor, for say 100 caps for an hour.. Then at the end of the hour I was offered a one time rental extension of an hour. Then, it would automatically kick me out and return to the rent machine.
---
Gonna check it . Thanks !
---
A few of us were groaning yesterday when we saw the change to the sights, they seemed to have tweaked the placement of the Gatling gun a bit as well, I swear it takes up more of the screen now.. (Agree/Disagree?)   
---
   
---
Anyway I agree, it's awesome they heard us, but the placement is a little wonkier now...
---
When you see me coming better 
---
Step aside, a lot of men didn‚Äôt 
---
a lot of men died
---
Lmfao yeah you have one shot volume health &amp; can do more damage.. seems so out of place.. what do you suggest everyone uses if they nerf it because of people who don‚Äôt understand balance? You suggest we all run around with those awesome ____ insert fucking anything because currently bloodied is it. AAE is the only other alternative (which people sell guns like that for 20k so good luckü§ë) sounds fun!!! We should all run around with ONLY anti-armor guns because people like you think it‚Äôs strange when Bloodied is one of the only viable builds left!! Let‚Äôs just get rid of legendary effects they‚Äôre too strange right?! Haaahaa
---
Can support Berserker damage is down across the board. With 2 DR from Ghost DR and 1 from Hazmat Suit  Berserker Explosive combat rifle went from 134 to 114 a loss of 15% damage.
---
... wow.
---
I have made about 8k since trading came out... (i think ish, wish there was a way to find out whats selling best...)
---
What sorts of things are selling best in your experience?
---
Fantastic info and thanks!
---
I have an AAE handmade rifle.  Honestly I don‚Äôt use it all that much.  My vampire 1 star auto handmade is used a lot more often especially in survival because of no explosive effects, great accuracy and distance, and suppressor.  I can also bust off 25 rounds in no time.  My perk build currently puts dmg at 95 per shot.  The AAE is much greater dmg but the explosive feature will give you away quickly.
---
I have five characters loaded with items‚Äîand I don‚Äôt dupe.  You‚Äôre just speculating.
---
Question were you in PowerArmor with the reactive plates mod?
---
I got mine this week as a well. I've hit ever machine I have see since fallout 4 release. It was really weird seeing it grab onto it square and lift.
---
The time is now. Imho, they're doing a great job at adding content and keeping the game alive. Especially as of late, and we're not even officially through the 1st dlc yet.
---
So my **Two shot Explosive Gatling Gun and my ***Two-Shot Explosive 90% reduced weight - are basically a nest egg retirement plan.
---
I'll sell you an I.O.U note for 25k.
---
I'm broke
---
Well fu**!   I‚Äôve been just dealing with all the nerfs but god damn it‚Äôs getting to be to much, every update nerf nerf nerf
---
Why are you making the game less fun.
---
My legos are looking pretty fun right now
---
Damn damn damn 
---
And I have over 1000 hours in , it‚Äôs just too many now 
---
Rant rant whine whine
---
Ok done
---
 
---
Next thing you know we're going to be carrying around different backpacks like armor sets.
---
I hope this is on their radar too.  I think if it was able to be done outside of combat only there would be no PVP issues and would improve the quality of life for most players.
---
Plot twist: Hide your vending machines so people are forced to explore your camp. :D
---
No, but I have now had this happen a few times and every time the person who killed me was using a bloodied 1 handed build (perhaps related??)
---
3 supermutants in a toolbox?  How did they fit?
---
If they nerf bloodied I‚Äôm quitting not a second thought for it. They‚Äôve nerfed TSE‚Äôs to the point that they‚Äôre dogshit I can go more damage with a fucking melee than a EXPLOSIVE weapon that shoots TWO bullets instead of one.. makes senseü§® they make decisions because of whiny kids who can‚Äôt get a bloodied weapon so they cry to nerf it, boohoo go on the market &amp; make your life better &amp; stop trying to ruin the game
---
Probably ran out of Abraxo down their XD
---
Let her pay rent?
---
Nothing against a good roommate as long as Bettsy provide milk and meat.
---
Does the event even give you anything? I‚Äôve done it 3 times &amp; got the s‚Äômores recipe once &amp; the other two times I got literally nothing, just regular event rewards
---
I mean, it did do damage, but so little that it might as well have not done any.
---
ah..... that makes more sense
---
best of luck.
---
Bloodied builds are already half dead, most of the time they‚Äôre below 30% or 20% health, idk that seems like balance to me. 
---
And bloodied builds are easily countered in Survival (esp after patch) and if you are mad about other ppls builds in adventure mode then you‚Äôre just a hater.
---
I'd be fine with out of combat or even if you had to be at a train station or CAMP to change.
---
Probably been mentioned before but you can farm them off the rooftop of West Tek. I used to covet the thing ever since my little brother explained the Port-A-Diner thing, then I found one on my usual West Tek run and it kinda ruined it for me. 
---
Still fun to look at though. An unspoilable pie.
---
I think you missed OP's point.
---
Can always count on you for great info, thanks!  
---
Will try to reproduce these later and post them.
---
It's not a Nerf, over repairing never stated the dr boost, it's a bug and it got fixed.
---
I'm okay with the current price, if only because it allows me to easily go to "new" parts of the map. This is my third character, so doing the long walk isn't as fun as it was if I'm on a specific quest. Now I have a jump-off point, and I get to say hello and trade with some randos
---
Serums and Ammo, we can't keep thus far with the demand.  I sold at least 30,000caps in serums the first 2 days.  I'm selling serums at 225 each and 5.56 and .50cal at 1 for 1.   
---
PRO Tip:  You can have more than 1 vending machine in your camp, thus selling 30/60/90 different items instead of just 30 in the one.
---
This. I went to someone's camp to check the vendor and it was locked behind a level 3 lock. The only level three lock in my house is the generator room where I keep the power switches that shut off power to the vendor or the whole house if need be.
---
You could spec into Covert Operative for the sneak attack bonus and Mr Sandman if you can get a suppressor on your shotgun. No sense in leaving 3.75x bonus damage on the table every night.
---
What about for the melee weapons
---
It's gone, that's exactly why I haven't set one of these up yet, knew it would be long before stuff disappeared or a player figured out some way to yank stuff from those machines.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a nerf apparently the extra armor was a bug the whole time (the best bug left in the damn game)
---
Awesome. I will get back into it. I was making ammo when I last played and finally hit my 100k rounds for .50 cal so maybe i can sell those in a vendor now.
---
I found mine at Phillipi cemetery next to the dug up grave. Better to server hop there imo. Because each hop you can check three locations within running distances, without spending caps.
---
Agreed.  Many of the nerfs are due to the persistent whining of incompetents.
---
Yeah, the addition of player vending has really livened up the place. I'm thinking of making a camp called "The Teleporting Tavern". Food, Drink, and a warm bed. The catch is, that it will just show up in random places around Appalachia, but be the exact same building, thus the Teleporting Tavern.
---
I do.
---
I'm not Bethesda, idk
---
This is the problem though. People who don't like something always complain and get what they want. I'd gotten pretty annoyed in some PvP situations when I couldn't seem to damage the ass/sent characters, but I'd never try to get them nerfed. People whined and it got nerfed lol. 
---
People who can't handle the meta will always try and bring it down to their level where they can.
---
Nooooo, not my bloody hatchet!
---
not all heros wear capes
---
What about melee weapons I‚Äôve not tested that
---
Found a right leg that was maybe 4k going for 7k. Still bought it because I need to burn caps like hell
---
You gotta go for the shorter barrels to control its recoil. The stub has the best recoil managment at the cost of range so the short barrel is the best of two
---
Thank you :)
---
Im sure there would be buyers.
---
Thanks, I hope you have good fortune on your travels.
---
I met someone who did the same thing as you. He basically set up a bar right next to the overseer's camp, and his vending machine was stocked with stuff geared towards low levels coming out of the vault.
---
For Brahmin either head to flatwoods because there you find the most in one place or get the Brahmin pen plan for your camp and set up one or two
---
Why anyone would put their vending machine inside a locked house is pretty much stupid. How else do you expect anyone to buy it? lol
---
There's a suggestion! We need a knocking function if people are away to alert them across world to return lol
---
So your stuff showed back up?
---
Drawback is that a level 50 fridge pack is only 30 carry weight and description says it doesn‚Äôt stack with the Good with Salt perk in the Luck tree
---
Let's play a game called Reddit Out of Context.   
---
Is he talking about   
---
A. An in game weapon  
---
B. An ex girlfriend
---
I tried to get into your lobby after u accepted my friend invite but im always crashing to the main menu
---
Uhm, maybe i'm stoned but.how the hell can i complete the new quest ? I did 2/4 objectives, and now i have no mission tag on the map whatsoever
---
Got disconnected from server
---
Well sorry I asked you seemed to know about the armour so I thought you‚Äôd know if the extra damage boost was a bug
---
There is also plan for pioneer skined tent.
---
But yeah most times it gives only caps and meds.
---
I think that server died mate. Sorry. I'll let you know when I find the Tourist again
---
places with concrete flooring? honestly.. wasn't really sure what to call them. Any thoughts?
---
It‚Äôs sad because they‚Äôre gonna ruin the game &amp; honest to god this is the only game I play. COD had went way downhill, TD2 was a disappointment to me like this is still my game of the year in 2019 lol I have so much fun &amp; if bloodied gets nerfed I‚Äôm gonna be 10 hitting super mutants with my axe.. sounds so entertaining.. I hope BGS understands the majority of the community does not want this shit nerfed.. most of us don‚Äôt even play damn survival if they wanna ruin the game makes these nerfs survival ONLY so I don‚Äôt have to live in their bland sad world
---
One of the is in challenges under the 'World' section, the other just requires you to revive a player.
---
I kinda thought so to, but I just had to get rid of some weight and wasn't willing to drop good weapons.
---
Yes, melee weapons &amp; guns were also a bug apparently. No extra damage
---
Not just the advanced repair kits, using the perk to repair to 200% also doesn't give you a bonus.
---
My chainsaw only does 4 dmg again instead of 30 when at 200%
---
They phantom nerfed it on purpose to coincide with a huge update so people wouldn't notice the change because they are too pre-occupied with the scout quests and player vending
---
Last question, were you in pacifist or PVP and the mutation trigger the "slap"?
---
I'm really hoping that the other vaults are a way of adding solo player content with full story and nice, rather than just everyone's dead like everywhere else.
---
Nope, tried that, has to be someone else
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Yup, seemed that way to me too. That's why I bought an AAE Combat shotgun for 10k, lol. Owner was near, so I was actually able to pull up the full specs.
---
Pretty sure I've seen just plain old Two Shots for like 45k
---
I've got some badges for the repeatable quest in the Addams camp. Plus leatherworker, roboticist (if you have schemes for robot armor) are ok. Look if you have all unstoppables magazines, if so then the collector is pretty easy. Rail Enthusiast is good too. Musician doesn't work at all. Chemist needs to craft a serum.
---
I was in pacifist mode.
---
So free range had like 20 something plans in the table &amp; the new event has.. 2? Jesus what a step back lol
---
Nerfed too, but I don't know if it was a bug, but it was a handy one. Suppose your DMG did go down with each hit though lol.
---
Grrrrr. Thanks though.
---
They call these bugs just like they said, they're not paid mods they're mini DLC's
---
WHO YOU CALLING A FERAL BUDDY?!
---
Yes got brahmin in camp and in flatwoods now. But spamming the X button and nothing happens!
---
ok thanks
---
The only pic that has a solid/concrete looking floor is the last one with the terminal.
---
Everything else has been there. The trading post, the crashed bird, the fallen plane. I even think the terminal has been there...
---
Alright I‚Äôll check them out thanks a lot üòä
---
Don't have any alt characters? I have alot of my best gear that I don't use stashed on other characters, along with tons of garbage legendaries to scrap. I figure I'll give the vending a couple weeks to get the kinks worked out of it.
---
I figured that so do you mean advanced repair still give boost? If so then this was done on purpose those sneaky freaks
---
Side note, your loss prevented me from possibly losing my stuff, way to take one for the team!
---
I have had ammo up the whole time, but only 1 person has bought that I have seen. I don't know if those are the ammo I am selling, I will have to change to those I guess.
---
and I have sold about 5 or 6 serums (hard to tell with out a sales log *hint hint bethesda, would be nice feature for the personal terminal*)... I guess the price should be dropped on mine, as its currently at 500. but I only have 2 types at the moment.
---
Nuuuuuu üò±
---
I was at this one dudes camp when THREE SBs just showed up and started going to town on everything. I did my best to help the guy but when the fourth SB showed up, I logged. I am so sorry.
---
Oh God, why?
---
mines just NE of whitespirngs trainstation - alot of nice player flow, earny about 20000 caps on the first day or so, slowed a bit now though :) PSN madmitchell79
---
everything is reasonably priced and stocks always changing :)
---
It is step backpack. Maybe it should give 1badge everytime so you can buy all backpack mods!
---
for me i found that most the tests related to merit badges i had done IRL where pretty easy though bit confused about why swimming would have you take photos of water park attractions
---
Wow this just smacks of "please don't take my advantage away" 
---
Don't worry i'm sure the next meta build will be along any time now it'll spare you from the dangers and risks of experimenting.
---
I had a player stop by my vending machine while I was at camp. He mentioned the regular "revive" requirement and I told him I needed it, too. We took turns throwing ourselves off the cliff at the edge of my camp until we could revive each other. It was awesome :)
---
For the "revive in water", I got lucky and got someone up at a Sheepsquatch event while we were in the pool in the middle. Counted!
---
An easy way for me to track sales is to always put a set amount of each item.  For example at the start of the day I set my serums all at 20 and ammo at 5k.  That allows me to see exactly how much of each is being bought thus telling me the supply/demand ratio.
---
So I will not be bothered by anything or anyone besides the occasional deathclaw or forrest critter
---
Not at all. It has changed, there are parts with concrete that I didn't take screenshots of, as I didn't want to truly spoil it for people. And it gives people a chance to visit Morgantown Airport and see the changes for themselves.
---
You have to do a bunch of BS pioneer scout stuff to get it
---
I'm staying with Sentinel. Not because I play survival, but simply for the added survivability + being able to stand my ground when/if someone decides to go full douche, and try to grief me.
---
I've been touring around for a couple days now and I've seen what some folks are building. Now I KNOW my CAMP is super dope on comparison. 
---
Please come see it!!!!
---
Advanced repair kits as far as I know don't give you a boost either ( never had one)
---
Bethesda logic, advanced repair kits aren't play to win if you take away the boost you get from 200%
---
It deffo does sound sneaky, if it was done when there was a small patch more people would've noticed it
---
So theres nothing in this pic.
---
Jesus you could've saved a lot of time by saying "oh I didn't include the new parts in the screenshots."
---
Jesus.
---
No.
---
Remindme! 3 seconds
---
Or a chance to earn a badge something man.. 2 plans is not okay when stupid free range had 3 melee weapons introduced &amp; at least 5 mod plans for each melee weapon also.
---
I used to live right there northeast of Thunder Mountain right on the map boundary. Made for a great grind with various Wendigos, Deathclaws, Mothman Monsters, Grafton Monsters and Sheepsquatch a little northwest of me. But once the vendor update came, I didnt want people having to fast travel all the way over there so I moved to that little river in front of the overseers camp. I get a lot of foot traffic, and I like to drop some free diluted stimpaks for anyone that swings by and says hello. 
---
Once the new wears off and I clear out of most of my inventory, I'll probably move back up there since I loved the swamp feeling. But I've got about 50 different legendary pieces of different stars that I'm waiting on the purveyor for to see if I want to scrap them, post them for sale at my shops or offload them wholesale at Whitesprings with Level 3 Hard Bargain and Grape Mentats.
---
Wait the increased carry weight mod adds weight and increases DR/ER? Why would anyone take the armor plating?
---
Yep. Strength increases melee damage by 5% each point, so in the early game that just means you might have to hit an enemy twice instead of once if your strength is low (with a big powerful 2 hander). The teens is when I remember the melee backup starting to suck.  But I just replaced it with a shotgun then.
---
No, I am speaking of mutations. I'm not complaining about it because I make the choice to run without Starched Genes and just clear them with a decontamination shower and redose with serums as needed (except nuke zones). I'm just sharing my observation that even the radiation from food can be enough to give you a mutation.
---
It's weird that I hardly got any mutations accidentally for the first 50+ levels, but once I started playing bloodied and resting at about 60% rads the chances of getting mutated seemed to have increased. So maybe that's what happened.
---
I second this!!!!!!
---
I hope not I recently in one White Spring loop got a Bloodied Gatling and Bloodied Knuckles with all my unyielding armor and 19% health my knuckles do 712 damage but a strong wind and a rad roach can kill me.
---
Why not?
---
I'm rolling with a hunter archetype for my main - butchers bounty, good with salt, super duper, thru hiker, stealth etc. - and my dream of opening a meat shop is dependent of refrigeration.  
---
People underestimate how good food is - I run around on average with +2 END, +2 AGI, +2 PER, +20 AP refresh, and +20 Carry weight - and each food item that gives these bonuses weighs between .01 and .05 lbs. and the effect lasts half an hour.
---
Also meat is good money.  With butchers bounty and super duper a glowing animal gives up to 30 caps of cooked meat resources, sell value, a head.
---
I ran into a perfect copy of Deacon... only he was naked (I assume to make switching disguises easier).
---
Well I don't know what happened but switched servers and all is good :) Guess I got Bethesdered
---
Yeah I'm not sure why they omit certain things.
---
 Maybe they forgot to edit the notes or maybe was unintentional. I don't think anybody will ever know.
---
Marsupial &amp; speed demon imo
---
If your referring to the punch bowl you can't at the moment. They removed the functionality of it in this week's patch, possibly due to bugs or exploits it introduced. It'll probably be back in the future.
---
"I have been playing for 500 hours and out of stuff to do, this game has no content what so ever!"
---
Not sure. But marsupial sure is the funnest.  Completely changed the game for me
---
I made a post about how silly it is to lock up your big empty ugly room with nothing in it, and somebody brought up that they lock the doors so enemies cant get in. I still think it sucks. 
---
I spawned into probably 5 camps yesterday where I was locked inside their house and unable to get out. Stuck in a 4 wall mess of a camp with no personality or  charm
---
There has been sales
---
That‚Äôd be a tiny pommel to be hit with.
---
good point. Thanks.
---
I really should launch my first nuke at some point, I have been playing since beta. Really would help me make serums that I have plans for I guess...
---
Tank builds. 
---
I don't want increased carry weight mod because assaultrons already grill me in seconds lol.
---
Probably gona stay with basic bag, but want those plans.
---
It‚Äôs already hard enough to see.
---
That is why they invite me. No point inviting people, who think watching a paint dry is fun.
---
Ooh, like a gun and equipment locker/tool chest that will let you swap between 3 or 4 preset builds.  You would have to reset them all if you reassigned a perk point but other than that it would be awesome!
---
Can relate, people don't use the search engine on Reddit, everyday we get the same posts... They have to ask themselves don't they?
---
Haha aww I'll come visit your camp if you're on PS4! I love playing FO76 like SIMS! People have been super sweet, hanging at my camp and even complimenting it for the past few servers I've been on., I'll bring you some of that love &lt;3
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I need everyone to upvote this so it makes the top post section. Please give this to us, Bethesda.
---
Good luck)
---
Better yet what‚Äôs a good time for u I can work around your sch my work hours r from 3-11 pm
---
Absolutely! I live off food. I have only used chems for fights with Scorched beast queen. And I limit that to rad x, rad away and fury. That‚Äôs why I am thinking of being pharmaceutical and weapons.
---
Someone did the same thing for me when I was just getting started.  Even gave me my first legendary which was too low for him.
---
Thank you, you‚Äôre a godsend. I‚Äôve only ever done the Medic exam successfully
---
Had the same thing happen. This game is so lively now!
---
Or as hunt as they are called in the Project Valkyrie mod in FO4 for the Liberty Prime mission ), "Communist Super Mutants, Fascist Gunners. And Red Chinese Raiders". Lol
---
Sorry buds, browsed the recent posts and couldnt find a similar question but thanks to those who did respond! I didnt want to give up but the gameplay was a struggle. Still got love for the game and community though! Will give another go!
---
I asked this about a month ago. I took a break around December because I would spend a lot of time grinding just to have a server crash ditch all my junk, or a CtD screw up whatever I was doing. I wanted to come to this sub to ask the state of the game after the latest updates, specifically for the reason that I knew there were people who actively played it and could give me an accurate assessment of whether or not those various little bugs got fixed, how well the game ran, etc. 
---
I was met with some negativity, got downvoted on the post and every comment I made, etc. I still came back to the game though, and the updates were great. I dont see a problem with those posts, its a great way to get old players back. Plus it means more customers for my shop ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
PC im afraid.
---
Not for me. I don‚Äôt even have to turn on my pip boy at night unless I‚Äôm in the mire.
---
Wrong if max it to lvl 50 its 60 extra lbs you carey
---
This takes place in an alternate reality where Energy weapons were developed as the top of the line military weapons instead of the modern-style weapons. Ballistic weapons kept being developed but many of the ballistic technology we have IRL never came to be here.
---
Shame :( guess today is not the day. If it was on steam i could use up some leftover dollars.
---
I'll just leave it in my cart and hope for an email when it does happen.
---
You don't have to buy it through the launcher
---
This
---
There isn't no real advantage to bloodied, those who use it know how much of a risk it is to run it. As a bloodied player myself I'm worried it will be nerfed, I don't pvp at all and all the whining and balance issues come directly from the pvp camp, why should I lose my damage because others want to cry about a balance in a game mechanic that shouldn't even exist in the first place.
---
You can milk anything with nipples
---
Has to be marsupial, I couldn't play without it now.
---
I don't even care about stat resets. Just the perk cards themselves.
---
I‚Äôm actually surprised that I‚Äôve made profit from this venture, I honestly didn‚Äôt think people would buy my discounted plans! It‚Äôs honestly really nice.
---
I‚Äôd rather only see this for passive perks like making items lighter, lock picking, etc. I always thought that being able to quickly switch between entire perk load outs would be too OP. Currently you have to decide how to spend your points and plan where you need more perks. It just seems to me that being able to immediately change your entire perk load out just translates to ‚Äúcan have every perk equipped‚Äù
---
"That's not a knife"
---
I haven‚Äôt had these issues.  Sorry that you have.
---
Thanks makes sense now been sitting there spamming the button...
---
If they're buyin i wouldnt stop! Ive just always bought and sold them on here for 200 and thought it was a good deal
---
I also wish the Welcome mat was an option again, it existed during Beta and I wish it'd come back!
---
Wait... Really? I'll have to test this! That's a game changer if it works üòÅ
---
My thoughts exactly. Seems like a great way to invite someone to come back, maybe even have a partner to travel the wasteland with.
---
Hey, if I see a plan I still don't have and the price seems reasonable, I sure as hell buy it.
---
4 and 5 stars are coming
---
Its about 15‚Ç¨ on keysites.
---
like the challenges to get the badges?
---
I generally slash the prices by half or two thirds, depending on what kind of plan it is
---
ye he talks to John Henry Eden
---
You do need the deluxe version specifically, right? I found a bunch that just said broken ProSnap camera and was unable to access them in the tinker bench, and they autoscrapped after.
---
It'd be graet if Bethesda could just track what items are selling for globally and set the in game value of those items at that average price. At least for chems and such. Kinda how items work in Runescapes GE.
---
Darn, I was gonna hook you up (discount price) with your missing serum plans.  I've still got a few and you don't typically get good conservation in this sub-reddit.
---
I like it!  I also want to mod up legendary hunting rifles and lever actions I get from the purveyor when she shows up.  Meat and guns! ( and maybe booze)  IF i open a bar I'm going to call it "The Shallow End" because my lodge is right on the edge of the gnarled shallows.
---
What's the point of getting so many caps. I'm continually at the max cap limit with nothing I need to buy
---
It would still be similar scores because most of the scoring especially YouTube reviewers was because of the backlash that existed before the beta.
---
You can see it still to this day back in June where you had people on the fallout subreddit calling the game a rust clone
---
Still looking for some help with this quest?
---
Totally agree, most of the time at night it seems like dusk at best.  Every fallout game since 3 I've used a darker night mod cranked to max.  We need more realism in this game.
---
Idk it feels like a laser with a stable stock and long barrel.
---
(Running a double shot, explosive and 90% weight reduction)
---
It sort of was, though, because Weapon Artisan's damage boost to V. Fast weapons was significantly more than every other melee weapon.
---
Don't forget to hold it sideways too
---
Marsupial is the one I‚Äôve seen the most
---
I quite enjoy looking at weird and complex weapons. this channel is a great source if you want to see more, because there is a lot more cool and weird Guns there that I haven't covered.
---
Depends what the legendaries are and what level max level bloodied explosives Ive seen bids start at 7k and the same for anti armor explosive cavalier and sentinel is also most pricey because they're rare
---
So what exactly changed? Would anyone mind linking me? I‚Äôm looking to start playing this game now if it‚Äôs finally worth it (for me)!
---
Where does one do that? Honestly about 95% of my games are from steam.
---
Don't worry, my camp is placed in the only place my pre-set would work üòÇ 
---
So I just keep adding more and more as I leveled up and now it looks like a crap heap.
---
Come on back. The FEV is fine.
---
I found some to the right of White springs station
---
Marsupial has been pretty popular at my station, I think some scaly skins were picked up last night before I logged off.
---
I wish I could bundle Speed Demon Marsupial and Birdbones as a  custom item called "The Flight Kit" but hopefully people just pick up all 3 on their own without my prompting.
---
YES! Totally agree. Stop fucking nerfing everything before we ruin the game &amp; have a stale experience. Buff other things.. TSE‚Äôs need brought up they‚Äôre dogshit compared to Bloodied, Furious or AA builds. Don‚Äôt nerf those, just buff others man. People are gonna complain, they‚Äôre gonna whine so let them. Don‚Äôt ruin the game because a bunch of kidsüòû
---
I have been wishing for an auto-closing door since I started building in this game!  As soon as the Nukashine quest showed us the Nuka Cola door that will automatically close after 30 seconds, I have been thinking "Hey, they've shown us now that they can make a door which will automatically close. GIVE ME ONE FOR MY CAMP!!!"   lol
---
I play the game mainly because I love the idea of a straight survival gameplay where I'm wandering around, killing shit, and collecting items to keep my camp, guns, armor and myself healthy. This game does something for me that Rust, Scum, and all those other "survival" games cant. I liked Fallout 4 a lot, but mainly for the fights, base building and the occasional companion to join me. Wasnt a big fan of the story. Now I have my little brother (who's always loved Fallout) running around with me killing any hostiles we encounter, and I get to help him learn new stuff with the Fallout series in general. 
---
If you like a survival game with no story and just a never ending open season on anything in Appalachia, this game is for you. But it's not for everyone.
---
Its definitely different than trading on here, i picked up a 3 star bloodied handmade for 3200 and a bloodied grognak axe for 150 last night
---
If you‚Äôre running a melee Bloody build with unyielding armor and radcool perk you have insane carry weight.  I have 385 carry weight outside of power armor, I don‚Äôt need anymore.  I‚Äôd rather have the 90 DR to be tankier
---
Buy recipes and make all your caps again
---
Reading comprehension....try it. I never said people loaded with items are dupers. I said everyone breaking out their mule character to sell everything at once is probably a lot on the servers.
---
The radio relay just west of vault 76 for me
---
apparently we have those free computers connected so who knows? maybe in the future
---
I think all perks would be fine, but they should have something to balance. Like you'll have to be in your camp or a train station. That should keep it balanced.
---
I also don't think it should let you change your SPECIAL points. Just perk cards. At this point you can still do this just only one card at a time. It would pretty much be glorified "load outs"
---
I don't get the random animal attacks on bases, there's plenty of buildings but they only attack ours?  It's just mildly puts me out cos I have to waste time rebuilding but the annoyance factor a through the roof.
---
Yup
---
Ultimate stealth weapon?
---
Thank you. be sure to watch some of Ian's videos. I would not have found these guns without him.
---
They're trying to please every casual player who play no more than a couple of hours per week. If they whine, Bethesda will nerf it. They don't want to farm for plans so Bethesda made all plans available to buy, they don't spend time to farm legendaries Bethesda is making legendaries available for purchase with scrips. Bethesda forgot that those casual players won't spend an extra dime on the game, after they get everything so easily they will stop playing.
---
good x2 lol
---
This all makes me happy, but also kind of sad.  After half a year of playing my interest has dwindled.  And the idea of Vault 51, the experiment, and a prototype ZAX, makes me interested in the game again.  But more from just a story and not from an actual "I want to play it" point of view.  Like I wish I had been doing this stuff the last couple months of my playtime instead of waiting til some time later this year.
---
I just picked up a 3* raider leg for 5K.  Was a sentinel unyeilding piece +1 strength.    
---
Honestly felt like I stole it haha...
---
this
---
The armor mod reduces carry weight I believe
---
Hey, you wanna play a prank on Andy?
---
Thank you for the offer.
---
I have an xbox... but I got PC version because the announcement said mods and private servers... And typically my other xbox games have not had best mod support.... :-/
---
Serves me right. Getting greedy like that... all the features I want, and the abilty to edit stuff?
---
My best selling stuff seems to be booze recipies...
---
I guess not everyone does as regularly as me...
---
It was a good way to get the mod one-handed weapons and mod bladed weapons challenges done.
---
I honestly dont think they will remove it.  its one of those bug fixes that would just piss off players
---
it makes me smile when i make some cash for those ammo that i always thought were useless for me.
---
my junk maybe is the treasure of others lol
---
also i'm surprised the amount of plans that i sold everyday that i thought they were hyper common
---
On now (Xbox) all need this. GT is name here
---
Wait you want us to finish in your camp?
---
There is a pinned post of the front of this sub with the new patch notes, [though here's a like directly to the most recent patch notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019) for convenience.
---
Basically now at your place camps you can set up a vending machine. Once powered you camp appears on the map as a fast travel point, alone with displaying a rough idea of what kind of thing you're selling. It's given the game a much needed boost.
---
I have nipples, can you milk me?
---
You are a hero! Are you on PC is there anything I can get/do for you?!
---
Playing the pip boy games on an arcade style machine would be a lot of fun.  Having the machine save the scores would be awesome!!   A nice Grognak console in my camp would look great!
---
You are correct.  I conflated your post with that of another.  Please accept my apologies.
---
It's funny, I just had a conversation yesterday with a player who insists that making it harder for griefers to target players in Adventure mode lessens his playing experience and will ultimately shorten the lifespan of the game, while insisting that he'd never greif another player himself.
---
I pointed out survival mode exists  and is a thing and he did not seem to get the point.
---
Yes.... yes,  I can add. (See above)  Thanks for the calculation assistance though.
---
Well... the sign outside did say "Red Rocket."
---
I get the tank thing but you said carry weight does DR and ER while armor playing just does DR. Wouldnt you benefit from both rather than just 1?
---
Yep I'm Max int, when i crafted it for me and my buddy we of course had 2 full healthbars.. I also have an unyielding build..  and accidentally had gunsmith on... took forever to get it down 1/4 of it's first layer of health bar. Ended up heading to my legendary bank character picking up the 3 crossbows I had on that toon (one was a quad so that felt like is sped things up). Hopped in my power armor to loose all my int/luck buffs and was bashing people in the face to get them down enough to barely repair.
---
Can someone ELI5 about the animosity against the Enclave? I joined up specifically for those sweet sweet Grape Mentats recipes.
---
Seen one on PS4 for 500 caps. Set mine to 300 caps, and it just sat there. No-one wanted it. Lowered it to 100 and someone bought it.
---
Oh it does wow thts nuts but it's big jump on defense
---
Go over to the trading subReddits and read for one day.   Then you will know how to price.
---
DR/ER boosts are plausible to a point and undoubtedly will get you through the majority of the game.  The problem comes when you get things like Colonel Gutsy who have rounds that seem to ignore DR/ER.
---
Dodgy is a double-edged sword, indeed, because it can leave you without AP when you need it most.  Against the Scorchbeast Queen, if you don't have enough Rad protection, her toxic cloud will essentially sap all of your AP things to Dodgy.
---
I hate PvP, and I am an explosive shotgun user, but I upvoted you because this is well thought out.
---
If you ever want mutations, I can make them all and I sell them at 299 at my camp :3
---
ign: ItsJustDashu
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool, it‚Äôs starting to sound like the multiplayer fallout experience it should be. Thanks for the link!
---
Last week I had 30 less carry weight and 90 less DR. I've survived with 175 carry weight for a month, 205 is a nice free buff.
---
Lol sorry, I didn't even see that comment when I posted.
---
I never knew such a thing existed, they're fucking cool. They're even cute and eat fruits and vegetables.
---
I see. Well, each of us may have our own preference between them but they are meant to be similar open world regions.
---
Wasteland - Mojave - Commonwealth - Appalachia
---
I agree with some others that the most recent update has made Appalachia feel much more lived in with other players that I can almost forgive there not being live NPCs. And apparentle we may even be getting some NPCs with the current roadmap.
---
I have high hopes that this game will keep my attention until Fallout 5 with some interruptions along the way (e.g. Borderlands 3).
---
 I found all that but weight redux instead of strength. 3000 caps first day of vending. Sold my trusty 1 star instigating super sledge for 1500 I think, took longer than i expected
---
PvP and pve stats need to be separated somehow.  This was a huge problem in ESO where the majority of the time PvP grievances we're causing nerfs that adversely affected pve.
---
If they can somehow bring human npc's back to this game in a lore friendly way I would definitely put it in my top 2 Fallout games.  I really like FO76
---
that should be on the classics channel now
---
I havent encountered anyone as cancerous as this in game. Yet. Most of the people would just emote hello and hearts to me when I encounter them. I've had some people invite me to team to use me as a free fast travel hub then drop me some items and leave the team. 
---
I did have a run in with a couple of level 200+ who audibly told me in voice chat to leave the area so they could grind or they'd kill me. Other than that, everyone's pretty laid back.
---
Pretty sure it's just any random magazine spawn location.  There is a chance it will be a Hologame magazine.
---
I got really lucky hopping one day at Janet's Soft Serve, while hopping for the random event location and the Responder Bot Vendor.
---
Inside the trailer at the locked safe, there is a magazine spawn right behind it against the wall (half hidden by the safe itself).
---
You can hop there and keep checking to see if you can find a game magazine.  You have a few different RNG rolls working against you though.  Magazine has to spawn.  Magazine has to spawn as a Hologame magazine.  Magazine has to spawn as the Hologame magazine you actually need.
---
Wait while I prepare the hormone injections.
---
Yeah. I've put a lot of ammo I'm never going to use in. Someone probably uses fusion cells.. Right? Haha
---
:D

Man I needed you last night badly.  My teammate kept getting stuck on that Swimmers exam and I was failing miserably trying to help.  Thank you so much!  I will definitely look here for the other exams.  +1
---
new vegas has a 1911 you start the game with it
---
Look for the Pack Leader events in the forest.. loads of wolves :)
---
Now itll become someone else's sentimental shotgun. I still have my Instigating Bolt Action pipe rifle that I've been running with since level 54. I dont think I could ever bring myself to sell it.
---
üëÄ I have Pipfall for sale at my camp. (GT: Jay Kateel)
---
Yeah, I sell to the vendor and clean them out, the rest for the day is profit.  They are easy to make
---
All builds use Speed Demon, Marsupial, and Carnivore.
---
I think the Death Blossom event NW of vault 76 usually has wolves.  That forest area also has that Horde event which is also wolves most of the time.
---
Hells yea, love these kinds of stories.
---
So it did not show back up on relog.
---
I too am looking for someone to die for me, will of course return the favor if needed, do not have mic though, am online right now, username Coldane
---
if ur on xbox ill keep an eye out for you. you can probably hear my camp, missles are constantly flying lol. mutants need to leave my blackberries alone
---
I built mine in the forest near Helvetia.  Nice safe little location
---
Good point but since we have the AK-47, 10mm submachine gun, recon rifle and the 50. Cal machine gun it‚Äôs enough to also justify the current ballistic technology status in the game.
---
I don't understand your question. If you brose this subreddit for carry capacity mod, you can too find picture of it from some guy. There is writen -60er and -60rr. This one increase all rezistances by +91. And all other have all rezistance +1.
---
i sold an arpoon gun and all the ammo for it lol, looks like someone wanted to roleplay as a far harbor dude xd
---
No, it's G
---
Was looking around for a NA code but sadly they seem Only slightly cheaper then the launcher. While EU codes were very cheap indeed. Ill have to wait for a sale. Thx tho.
---
Hopefully they find their white whale.
---
I sold all of forest maps for 5 caps. I didnt even know people wanted forest maps and im selling out of the ash heap lol
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. It‚Äôs the problem of every game. But I need one of these posts to blow up so BSG see‚Äôs this isn‚Äôt the path we want to take! Buff other things don‚Äôt nerf the only things keeping us around. For the love of god just buff TSE‚Äôs a little bit because they‚Äôve ruined them by this point &amp; other things. Laser weapons are still crap &amp; the Plasma buff hasn‚Äôt really helped as I‚Äôve seen not one person personally using one. I mean maybe if you have a god roll one or something but tbh I‚Äôve received one legendary plasma rifle ever sooo
---
Yeah, np, i just dont want everyone thinking im calling them a duper for selling stuff.
---
I hate all the nerds going on fallout 76 and would support a minimum hipster level to log on.
---
My bad, I thought it added to the total.
---
Ever watch Kingpin?  At least your Brahmin is very happy.
---
Fast travelling again doesnt always work when you need to get out of someone's place to shop. I spawned in on someone's two story house where the machines were outside but the doors were locked. Kept trying to fast travel over and over to his camp but it put me at the same spot. Decided to just fast travel to deathclaw island and go from there since it was near.
---
wait how do you check this?
---
I hate to say this but if an item is not in the game then it should not be part of the challenges. You should of added it when the plan was put into FO76.
---
I can confirm, as of last night, its absolutely still there.  on XB1 anyway
---
Was PvP ever fun in Fallout 76?
---
Tadpole.
---
if you spawn at national radio astronomy research center and walk around the back and out about 50 meters you will find a campsite on a hill.  from there walk directly toward treetops. you have a like 30% chance to walk past a random mob spawn its either ghouls, mutants or wolves. keep walking and you will find a small shack made out of a vehicle and its on the side of a cliff. there either wolves spawn or mole rats.
---
Even if it doesnt stack it could free up a perk slot if your using Salt
---
Oh i would love me a good crossbow. Only used a one-star lately when i was farming that 'kill scorched with a crossbow' challenge and i fell a little in love.
---
Thx must a mod for PC. Don‚Äôt have it on xbox, I have it hold X like a sucker !
---
Jeez rude much? How about you do yourself a favour and go have a look.  
---
And there are new parts in the album, apparently you're just that blind you think they haven't changed at all.  
---
Idiot.
---
Do it!
---
I run a low health PA build with adrenal reaction and have a furious plasma rifle with the flamer barrel.  It absolutely melts enemies at close range in just a few shots.  Its drawback is the range but fires so fast and is so powerful that everything dies before they close the gap.
---
Under 20% health with 9 points in rifleman, 3 in tank killer, 3 in bloody mess, each shot deals 110 ballistic and 110 energy damage (if i recall correctly). After 5 points in adrenaline get running each shot deals close to 200 ballistic and 200 energy damage.  It fires extremely fast, the clip has 300 shots, and each shot seems to be an area of effect (like the flamer).  Also, it weighs less than 5 pounds! This has become my go to close range, crap i'm being swarmed weapon.
---
TLDR: In my opinion plasma rifles are now significantly more powerful than before and a lot of fun to use :)
---
The paid fast travel is for a luxury you can always walk if you don't want to pay.
---
PS4, same problem, went to get done bloatfly parts, couldn't hit them in vats, just 0% hit chance
---
The whole point of the tax is to remove 10% of caps from the game 
---
Having free fast travel to camps would just negate the effect the tax provides
---
Maybe. But who am I to judge?
---
Yeah dawg it‚Äôs super cheap everywhere but NA. I check CDkeys pretty frequently for it
---
We should only be able to reperk at camps tbh, habing builds means nothing if you can just switch out cards at will. No point in equiping the hacker cards if you can just equip it when you find a computer and then unequip it after.

---
Sure, if you'll return the favor :)
---
That's a great idea. I'll try to compile and make a gdoc of everything here.
---
Welcome to the nerf club.
---
yes, i also said that lol
---
You *do* know that all of these games have bugs, right?  Fallout 4 wasn't perfect when it released.  Did you know that it takes 40 seconds to load an area when could take 1, all because of a poorly implemented framerate cap?  New Vegas has a massive save corruption problem.  There are fan-made patches that address hundreds of these things and make it appear seamless, but you gloss over that because it doesn't fit the narrative.
---
Also, we have a Lever Action Rifle that works.  And they fixed the loading thing.  And our Aluminum Trays scrap to Aluminum, thank you very much.  I can't say much for Bethesda Prime, but this team is at least interested in fixing the stuff they didn't.
---
I've played the game since the week after launch.  For me, it has never been unplayable due to bugs.  Yes, there are bugs.  There were more than there should have been at launch.  But a lot of the recurring complaints you seem to allude to fall under quality-of-life irritation - like the Bobby Pins, scrapping bulk, etc.  I don't know how you judge failure, but failure is not a game where Bobby Pins weigh 0.1.
---
Yeah. Just add me. I have to do something it will be a few minutes. Just add me I‚Äôll be on quick
---

---
Perhaps but there‚Äôs still assasins effect which is 40% less and that‚Äôs not affected it‚Äôs whoever really gets the first shot off now and if your health is full you have a better chance of not being one tapped
---
Because I don‚Äôt want them to ruin my favorite game for a bunch of kids..? You must be a loner at parties, have a bad day‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You're toxic and a gatekeeper.  Don't be either of those guys.
---
Mods are great and all, but this should be a QOL update from Bethesda
---
But those are just the guns you can see in any other game. I rather see new things.
---
Felt accomplished when I beat the cooking exam without needing to look anything up!
---
At cost of 30carry weight. But for some people it may be good.
---
Yeah, on our terminal
---
dont think i can add you before you're online, or i dont know how
---
Alright, if you want me to have sex with your camp I won't say no
---
The people that cry, moan and whine until they get what they want, in this case weapon needs are just a symptom of wider society at the moment. IE they are so pampered and used to getting their own way, they will constantly call for the moving of goal posts to suit them. 
---
I don't care about silly little manlets that can't handled being killed via PvP. Stop listening to these utter cry babies. Every nerf makes the game less enjoyable, and I'm concerned that my beloved bloodied will be next, although it's hard meta in any department other than DMG output.
---
Is it the same sound as the frogs on the west river in the Forest area?  Cause there are some nice resource CAMP spots there but that frog chirping sound is deafening and I cannot stand putting a CAMP there because of it.
---
Your thinking is why the market is broken ...
---
any build that doesn't require heavy guns.
---
Let‚Äôs all uncover them together for Bethesda to see
---
Excellent. Market research at its finest. Haha.
---
Hoping they will double the players on a sever now. Probably not since we have so much server instability now.
---
I can help build for caps on xbox
---
It's so cute, I hate to see it in the tiny little jar. "Habitat" seems an odd choice of words.
---
I just bought a level 50 perfect storm from someone for 200 caps
---
Yeah i just found it thanks
---
Thanks :)
---
they also need to add bulk ammo, no one is ever going to spend 1 cap for 1 bullet no matter the ammo type. On ps4 it seems like every person decided to fill their machines with ammo no one is ever going to buy.
---
Got use an stub or short barrel instead of long. Makes big difference
---
Same! I had a real fucking hard time with the code breaker one though lol.
---
nm...friend request sent
---
Thanks for the offer. Went to bed early last night. I‚Äôll give it another try after work tonight
---
Hmmm, not sure ..I can't remember what sound is there. I will say that if you had a bunch of these, then yeah it could be annoying. But just a couple make nice little chirping noises.
---
I put mine on a Roman pillar and put Naveen on it ü§£ I caught me a real prince!
---
If you are charging anything near the cap limit for one item you ARE the problem with the economy. Sorry to tell you lmao
---
You have to read them.
---
I got lucky and found the neon letters off a player for 3k last night on Xbox, instant buy for me.
---
It‚Äôs becoming common to gift the new players , just remember to share the experience with a low ur when you‚Äôre grown , pay it forward ü§ó
---
I‚Äôm ready now
---
I've chatted with a Community Manager about this, as far as we know ATM it seems unintentional
---
Hey, you did your best! I showed up at my camp a little while ago and 3 SBs were just beating the hell out of it. One really kind soul was fighting them off when I arrived. We handled it pretty quickly, just trying to resupply  now to repair everything. Thems the breaks! üòä
---
Rifle stocks maybe? Theres plenty of rifles missing them.
---
I‚Äôm a plan vendor as well and what I do is I sell them for half their price, cuz honestly I‚Äôm always finding plans out there XD
---
To be honest man when that update came out. I went to a random event and found the camera within the first 5 minutes. I didn't even know the camera was a thing lol. I would just go to random events. I think the event was that tea pot thing lol
---
More like at the cost of 90 carry weight, because otherwise you could equip the high capacity mod for 120.
---
I've got a quad one. 
---
Once it's reloaded completely, it's pretty fucking rad. Those reloads though... You basically need to use it for quick succession medium-close range sneak attacks.
---
Yeah I do, I think it is bugged. My challenge tracker showed I've read most of them even before I bought the bunch from another player.
---
I call it functionalism, a legit architectural style.
---
Praise atom I hope so üëç
---
Fairly good chance during Events, such as Sheepsquatch.
---
Whooooa! Bethesda let your light shine down!
---
The biggest issue I had is I finally started listing my stuff, and now I have to worry about that 25k cap limit.  I was at 20k before the patch.  Luckily I just spent a bunch of caps on the X01 Mod Plans at the Bunker they added.  But before I knew it I was back up to 18k caps, with three vending machines filled with a bunch of plans and mods totaling another nearly 20k in items.
---
I'm afraid now to actually do things that will keep me away from vendors for too long as I need to find things to spend caps on before I reach my limit.  
---
Speaking of... is there a way to remotely turn off your Vending?  Like if I am out and about hit 20-23k caps, I could just go into my menu and turn off vending, disabling my CAMP sales until I turn them back on.
---
where is the tea pot thing
---
What kind of perks for the armour though so I know what kind of space I have on the park 3 to make sure I'm getting max damage output
---
All those preservatives, makes my tummy hurt just thinking about it
---
If you're on PC, I'll take it. Itll make for a good low level killing machine. Tired of wasting ammo on level 5 mole rats and scorched.
---
This is becoming a critical problem with the player vending machines. I'm getting tired of FTing to a C.A.M.P. vendor only to :
---
\- Spawn in a foundation
---
\- Spawn in a fence
---
\- Spawn inside a locked building
---
\- Spawn on a rock sticking out from the edge of a cliff (fortunately I haven't spawned in the air and died yet)
---
Dead and/or trapped customers can't spend much money, don't ya know...
---
Actually, we just set up the auto moderator to start filtering some of these posts out. Those conversations don‚Äôt add anything to the sub, and if you‚Äôre asking as a legit question to a community dedicated to that game, you probably won‚Äôt give you an answer beyond what you‚Äôve already decided. Feel free to report the ones it misses.
---
if you are on ps4 id be happy to sell you hyper inflated items to reduce your caps
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it get's a bit of a nerf. It's just so much more powerful than everything else.
---
What I would like to see is a buff of other builds and perks to make them more viable, rather than nerfing things.
---
\-Beserker
---
\-Nocturnal
---
\-Junkies (I know there was a small fix)
---
\-All the enemy specific prefixes (hunters, troubleshooter, etc)
---
I think a rework of some of the enemies would be good too.  Make them hit harder and less spongy.
---
Another thing may be any that you did during the beta don‚Äôt count. If you read 3 in the beta. You need to get to 23 in game now.
---
Dude! The first vendor shop I found, had a Ghoul Slayer Grognak‚Äôs axe on sale for only 200 caps. I bought that weapon so fast, my favorite melee weapon from FO4! Thank you MediGirl!
---
God I want combat knife mods, I have a 40% faster swing speed, +1 strength, more damage when mutated one on my melee character with twisted muscles. Mods would make me so happy.
---
I almost exclusively use normal armour.  We got a nerf recently but I still rock over 400 dr and er. I also have 25 poison resist which is a must for radscorps and scorchbeasts and just over 100 rad resist.
---
My perks. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e1d15e8&amp;d=s92sd0sf2so2se0sp2p20eh2ej3ei2eu0ed1cu0ib3ir0ab2af2an0au2ai2a00la1l71lt2lu0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
I use BOS combat chest and 1 leg, marine leg, robot and raider arms (mainly keeping these for the 100% fall damage reduction until I find better).  All armour pieces are heavy, remember there's light, sturdy and heavy versions, except in trapper and marine.
---
Are you on PS4? We could team up if you‚Äôre down.
---
Also, make it a handgun rather than a rifle.
---
Not bitter at all...
---
Oh maybe I should sell bulk junk too
---
Just because I don't like something no one must like it
---
ready as well, dont have a mic though..
---
Just normal post updates woes. We got a lot more activity of people putting things in, pulling things out of stashes with the vendor updates. Probably putting a heavy strain on the servers.
---
IMO, caps are kind of a joke and to pay cap for fast travel never made much sense to me as I'm not taking a bus, train or plane to my destination. I would have thought fast traveling would cost hunger and thirst over caps since I assume we walk to the destination, but hey, whatever. I'm just thinking of creating more foot traffic for the camps with players that have more caps in their pockets to spend.
---
If you could see how many times I die, you wouldn't call it an advantage. 
---
All that boost to my dmg and I can't one shot a lvl 68 mutant out of sneak.
---
Fallout 76 good
---
Give me upvotes
---
How do you unlock Habitat?
---
&gt; "Habitat" seems an odd choice of words for the jar.
---
It's all themed for little kids joining the scouts.  So it's like when you find a caterpillar as a kid, put it in a mason jar, add a stick, a leaf, a rock, punch some holes in the lid.  Now you have a whole habitat!  (Adults know it's just a jar, but not from the point of view of a kid).
---
I would love to see your own list of weapons that bethesda should add to the game.
---
It was in the patch notes if you read it
---
I thought this was a camo skin for the combat knife when I saw this picture
---
What's making me really happy is seeing the same names multiple times.  Even if they're not going to buy something, it means they're finding value in my c.a.m.p. and that just feels great.
---
The entire reason I built where I did is because there were no convenient hubs to repair and rearm in the area. Now my c.a.m.p is a fully functional BnB. Crops, water, beds, crafting, and now vendors with ammo/food/supplies.
---
Sure the ammo is on the expensive side, 1c per bullet...but it's the best I can do and you're paying for convenience. (besides, the workbench is right there, lol)
---
Im confused
---
Just wondering what you're planning to spend that Scrooge McDuckian pile of caps on?
---
I was level 200 before I left the vault
---
Ps4 sadly.
---
I was refering to basic no mod. Because 120lbs bag have -60 rad rezistance and -60 energy rezistance. Which is not so good if you are not berseker.
---
Sorry if I wasn't clear, I wasn't comparing the settings from the different Fallout games - by 'wasteland' I meant the post-apocalyptic experience in general, pervasive throuhgout the whole series. Collecting badges and becoming a scout doesn't really fit into that imho.
---
After 200+hrs, I keep logging in and wanting to play this game, but there's just nothing interesting left to do.
---
Y'all realize the same eldritch entity that empowers the Skyrim couriers are also behind the Great Appalacian Sweepstakes, right?
---
What platform are you on?
---
Good call! Didn't think of that
---
I think it only works on the base weapon weight. Mods dont get a reduction.
---
PC (master race(sarcasm))
---
we should do it in water i believe?
---
What really terrifying are things that can take radiation (granted not 100%).  kill it with fire!
---
Deathclaw hides exist, just not dropped on their death. I found one a while back in a scorchbeast pile.
---
Unless we are talking about different things it‚Äôs definitely mentioned in the notes.
---
Nah
---
Only Stans have this knowledge
---
It's part of the tadpole herpetologist badge. You craft a frog habitat jar and then catch a frog to put in it.
---
If you really want I can throw a Prime mod on for you if you're on PC. Wouldn't be my greatest waste of flux... like the time i accidentally primed a railway rifle.
---
Ammo cost below:
---
1 Ultracite  
---
1 Aluminum  
---
2 Adhesive  
---
3 Plastic  
---
5 Steel  
---
1 Pure Fluorescent Flux
---
Damn. I have like 5 of the damn things but I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
&gt;you ARE the problem with the economy. Sorry to tell you lmao
---
More like they are a symptom of the problem with the economy.  Overall Caps had little value due to how much existed in circulation and storage.
---
With any luck, the 10% tax and Fast Travel fees with CAMP Vending will begin to cut into that surplus of Caps and stabilize things.  But that will take a while considering there are 6 months worth of horded caps out there.
---
im here because i tell the truth
---
Do you need blueprints?
---
I'm mostly selling excess plans right now. Tier 1 plans for 25 caps, Tier 2 for 50, and Tier 3 for 100+ depending on the meta. Ballistic Ammo for 1 cap each, 2 for shotgun, EC, plasma, etc.  
---
Stuff is moving at 10-15 items per hour so I don't feel like I'm too under/over priced
---
Don‚Äôt see it
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/64xBDO2aEDqzWOsXuWPtle/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-8-5-notes-april-23-2019
---
Finally someone not asking for nerfs for everything ! üëçüëçüëçüëç
---
Um, I'm not sure I follow that logic. So, then if you buy something from the player, you should get the fast travel cost back - right? :)
---
You should come back and play hahahah
---
Ye i heard they are random world drop, but super rare. Not worth trying to farm.
---
I love checking out other people's CAMPs when I visit their vending machines! There's some great builds out there that put my crap-shack to absolute shame.
---
You pull sixteen tons, and what do you get?
---
We need in-game version of Perk Loadout Manager mod
---
Another great idea.  Hoping Bethesda lets us know soon!
---
That's it.  I only thought it might have been a Nukashine destination at first thought because I couldn't see why the game had blueprinted me, but quickly dismissed that because it would let me build new foundations.   I just couldn't get my base to set back in place because when I originally set the foundations which formed an "L" shaped observation deck along the top edge of the north face and east face, I had to really set and reset them to get them to line up and the main building foundations linked up off of them from there.  That's a bit of a hole there because it's the bottom of the slope that starts just south of the pond from above.  The elevation changes in the foundations made it impossible to reset properly.  I have no idea why the game had to remove my camp.  I had just updated with the patch and I figure there was an entanglement issue with another player's camp or a server hiccup maybe?  Who knows?  Anyway, I've moved and happy with my new place.  I am glad others are still there, it was a grand vista from that corner.
---
Plasma thrower attachment is boosted by rifleman perks or gunslinger depending on the stock.
---
Common sense would assume commando but that is not the case. 
---
Unless this was changed in patch 9, but previously my plasma thrower only saw a damage increase from rifleman perks
---
You just linked the april 23rd one.. were in may, its in that one.
---
I would love darker nights and heavier storms.
---
You obviously have not seen my wares and by the way you are speaking couldn't afford anything I have for sale. People who understand what they are buying are more than glad to pay the price of admission.
---
Agreed.  Got mine last night at the Cryptid event.
---
1. Are you wearinging them? Doesn't work if you're not wearing them, duh.
---
2. Are you in power armor? Power armor negates all standard and legendary armor bonuses.
---
3. Sometimes the game 'wigs out' and doesn't calculate the weight bonuses correctly. Log out and log back in again.
---
4. Some weapons (Grognak's Axe comes to mind) do not benefit from weight reduction perks. The harpoon gun shouldn't be one of them.
---
5. Some weapon mods (maybe all) don't work with weight reduction perks. Might want to consider removing them.
---
6. If you really like your harpoon gun consider the Bear Arms Perk. At level 3 with weapon weight reduction armor perks that gun should weigh almost literally nothing.
---
Lucky you. I'm on PC so maybe that's why.
---
Switching out cards only in camps seems extreme given the limited amount of cards you can equip at one time and so many of them are just situational.  In my opinon this game doesn't need any more limitations to it but rather make the just annoying ones (ie. nothing to do with game balance) better so people can spend more time exploring/questing and less time managing things.
---
That serum price is pretty standard (Mid to High end of the spectrum, you could usually find people doing 100-150 cap serums).
---
Fusion Cores will be a nice thing to purchase as you find people with surpluses looking to offload their high weight values, and they are pretty easy to farm if you are willing to do workshops.
---
10/10 Best Melee Weapon in Game.¬† Every player should use this.
---
I primed a railway rifle once. The ammo was a pain to craft. Huge waste of good flux. Also I'm on Xbox so I can't trade with you.
---
Ah, good call. I hadn't even thought of that.
---
Arktos was datamined to be a huge raid so definitely not coming but on another note why the fuck do we need maintenance every day.. can I just enjoy the damn update without having to sit here for hours because BGS are the slowest workers known to mankind..
---
one night I looked at my ingame map, there was a group of five level 1's and a sole level 144 at my camp near vault 76. made me smile but i was afraid to fast travel to my camp
---
Marsupial, bird bones and speed demon work perfectly together and are essential for me. 
---
I could never go back to playing without them, which is why I'm so reluctant to start a new character.
---
With all the nerfs recently I worry if my precious mutations could be soon.
---
Xbox, but thanks anyway.
---
They used to be a lot darker during the BETA, but people cried and moaned.
---
"I put lives at risk when I drive like this, I put wives at risk with a knife like this"
---
I'd rather leave it up for other people to see. The more that head over there the better market we have :)
---
Thile I've been conversing with you, The entire album has  ended at a dead responder at a terminal.
---
I would check myself if I weren't caught up at work. Not everyone cam be on the game 24/7. I have asked you what changed, you've been little to no help. I have very clearly said what I was asking about/looking for.
---
0/10 no rice.
---
I'll be happy once game developers move past this endless Battle Royale hump we seem to be stuck on.

That's why my vending machine is at the verryyy back of my camp in separate building, so they have to go through 3 buildings trying to find it
---
That explains the weird taste.
---
Hard? Nights are practically the same as the days wtf.
---
It seems like it actually is. The spawn point for visitors appears to be where you first set down the C.A.M.P. not where it currently is. I've visited a lot of them lately and I spawn on the C.A.M.P. if it was never moved. Visitors to my C.A.M.P. appear exactly where I placed mine the first time even though it's not there now.
---
Thanks!  Navigating the Challenges screen is so fucking shitty, this is going to save me a lot of headaches!
---
theres a good run in the ash heep that will net 5-8 cores in &gt;10 minutes or so
---
,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I have max caps so you sound like a uninformed child (not surprised by the post). A TSE is literally worth no more than 10k they‚Äôre dogshit in this meta they‚Äôve been nerfed 4 times now? But I know I‚Äôd walk into your shop for a nice ‚Äúfair‚Äù 20k TSE weapon hahaha nice one buddy
---
K looking again
---
Ignorance governs these prices.  The inability to know even a rough market value for something just turns it into a crap shoot.
---
35$ at Walmart
---
www.walmart.com/ip/Fallout-76-Bethesda-Softworks-PC/848056847

I'm not a big fan of doing any workshop work in general, so finding fully charged fusion cores at that price was like a kid in a candy store lol
---
Complete Possum challenges to earn badges. Exchange those badges for mods in the vending machine at Pioneer Scouts Camp.
---
In a month you should have enough badges to get your first mod.
---
I've sold multiple fashnacht masks for 500c each:)
---
I noticed that since the patch SBs are showing up in 3's,had 3 at WS last night, had 3 in watoga Tuesday. Since the patch I haven't encountered a single SB, only packs of 3.
---
Isn‚Äôt it a craftable item?!
---
Yes, please.  It's kinda weird that it wasn't added long ago.
---
Dont u buy mods from one of the machines by where u got the main quest
---
LOL! I have to support my wife's in-game lifestyle too &amp; It's just nice to say "money is no object" really.
---
Is it just me or do players and customers spawn i. At different spots? Kinda makes it hard to know where the players will spawn in.
---
You got a link to the discord?
---
low energy
---
It doesn't take that long. I know not everyone has time to grind the game but I managed to get the high capacity mod by grinding the challenges for 12 hours yesterday
---
Make sure you dont have gunsmith equipped
---
It really isn't unplayable.
---
It's just as relevant since neither have hard data on actual trade prices.  That's purely in the devs relm since the don't expose the trade logs.
---
Burnt book and burnt comics are useless, and weigh a pound each.¬† They have no scarp worth!
---
Agreed in full.
---
I had neglected my main account at lvl 80 for months sfter losing interest in the game. I ended up leveling an alt character to 170 with god tier weapons. I came back to main and was mortified by my whole setup. I ended up leveling it up to 148 with some good gear and mutations. Dont fear being mortal again its actually fun using the knowledge of the game to build yourself up into the killing machine you once were.
---
Firebreathers/Responders banners and flags plz XD
---
There is also a smores recipe which you need for other challenges
---
They're probably going to fix the "resolute veteran" issue.  As a fellow heavy gunner, I made sure to get this.  IMO, it's quite underwhelming.  I have a Twoshot gatling that I've been using, and found myself switching back to the twoshot after a while.
---
Damn, I have that exact same weapon, same level and effects.  Been my trusty sidekick for ages.
---
What about when you set a price for something and it jumps back to the top of the list. This is the worst one... Scroll allllllll the way back down to set a price for the next item
---
At the risk of sounding like a complete moron, I'm gonna ask this question, you do have stims in your inventory right?
---
I‚Äôm not exactly opposed to this especially if they normalize gear. Could be a fun way to pvp without feeling ‚Äúat risk‚Äù out in the world
---
How do i get the rank of a possum?
---
I got 1200 hours so far and still very much enjoy myself with plenty to do. I don't bum rush content. I like to take my time and explore, so many ways to entertain myself in this game. About to make a third character, gonna make a max charisma medic with max luck. I don't think I'm alone, I'm sure there are others that love this game as much as I do.
---
if you follow the train tracks, cross into the divide near top of the world, its pretty quick to get around. also the dried river bed leads from vault 76 to ash heep really quick
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation
---
I'd enjoy it if it was difficult or even challenging, as you say. As-is, a vast majority of it is simply tedious, and that's not fun... which is *supposed* to be the point of this whole endeavor.
---
what platform?
---
Damn. I need either that plan or the tiny wood ones. What price do they normally go for?
---
Totally forgot to include that. PC.
---
Still don‚Äôt see it highlight it for me please 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019
---
My set up is 3 pieces of vanguard heavy combat with aP refresh a Chameleon heavy with aP refresh and a heavy combat chest with weapon weight reduction all BOS. getting just over 400 Dr and nearly 500 energy I think. I don't use any perks to increase Dr either. Probably put together for around 10k
---
It really depends on what it is. Like another person suggested you are probably better off just cruising the trade subreddits for a bit.
---
I sure hope not because I feel it's fair, even before I went bloodied. Been a bloodied build for less than a week now and while I do damage akin to pre-tse nerf, I now have to sacrifice health and keep a constant eye on my rads. Silo runs can be a pain if you skip repairing the reactor, but it's so much quicker.  
---
I don't have bolstering/sentinel, Cavalier/sentinel, and only one piece of unyielding and even if I did, by the looks of my friend with a full set, no longer are you practically untouchable. (I can actually kill him without spamming a magazine in VATS and unloading criticals on him in hopes of a stagger)
---
I was a semi squishy stealth vats sniper before, though I could still tank quite a few hits, but now I'm even more so. A true glass cannon and if I make the wrong decision, get detected and cornered, my chances of survival are extremely thin. Especially with ghouls and their rad damage in their attacks.
---
Are those of us who got the gun going to lose it?
---
I agree on the town idea. I built close to someone I don't know, but it saves people having to pay to fast travel. Still, that travel agent perk is way more useful now.
---
I'm in the same boat, I've never played the game with a friend.
---
If you have the backpack, you already are.
---
Ahh thank you I totally forgot gunsmith effects wear on weapons
---
since no ones taking the bait. good choice on brances of the military. i'm in 13 years so far. wavering on my commitment, but do not regret my time in the AF at all.
---
I'm selling everything cheap. About 50-75% of "in game" pricing... (i.e. if the description says that a weapon is 200 caps, I charge about 100-150).
---
It's more than I'd get from a Bot vendor, and allows someone else to get closer to the build they want... and that makes me happy.
---
I mean because I got it from the glitch apparently. Because all I did was claim a workshop and I got it
---
Not like it has a scope to make use of the long barrel range anyway.  Maybe PC is different but on console if you can see your target while aiming with it, your target is at short range anyway.
---
Yeah finding it very hard to find legendary combat pieces with decent effects
---
Not really, some weapons were developed prior or during the divergence. The AK-47 appeared during the forties. 
---
Furthermore energy weapons aren't good for sniping, so ballistic snipers kept being developed. Energy weapons aren't good for armor piercing either, hence the 50. Cal.
---
But Laser and Plasma weapons far outperform something like an M16. (Even if the game stats doesn't reflect this in 76)
---
I spent 15 minutes kiting the Mirelurk Queen and trying to take a photo of her and her spawns but with no success, the challenge wouldn't complete. Then I said fuck it and fatman'ed her.
---
It's so confusing tbh. I see people selling brick/barn/warehouse/metal building sets for 20 caps each. People selling fasnacht masks for 15 caps each and fasnacht plans for 100 caps each. Then you see people selling stimpacks for 40 caps, (bullets are a complete rip off for 1:1 ratio)  and the rare clothes from the responders vendor for 7k to 10k. It's a mess lol
---
Of course, it was an exaggeration. But still, it is extremely grindy for a single mod.
---
But the grind is funish!
---
to be fair, players already stopped at others CAMPS to check them out. However now there's more of a reason too. I always enjoyed looking at others camps to get ideas
---
Haha, yes :)
---
Not a stupid question, in this case.... I'm tearing my hair out over this.
---
The market subreddits have turned what would otherwise be a complete crapshoot into somewhat less of a crapshoot. Plenty of items have developed a clear market value based on many highly active auctions. The main market subreddit is something like in the top 30 most active subs across all of reddit. Seeing the prices people are putting in their vendor machines, now that's a crapshoot. But it should sort itself out over time.
---
&gt;You know at some point you have to think that when a game gives you such vast number of flexibility and possibilities, it is up to you to make the game fun for yourself. 
---
This sound like one of those american cults, where old men have multiple underage wives, because they decided that this the way of living fullest of life. NO. This game is not sandbox game. It is too limited to pull parallels with such design.  And the "Fun is what you make" is a poor excuse. Its a excuse that people make to justify trash-"This burgers taste bad, but hey if I imagine it to something better, it aint that bad". With that logic you can eat from garbage pin and still call it good. Sure some people have low standards on fun and see paint drying as fun activity, but I sure don't have low standards when it come to fun and games.
---
Can't give higher score on a game that is not worth more. Even if you ignore the opinion, the technical side and UI/UX is already pulling the game down and these aren't thing where you say "I don't like". How bad has to one be at design UI/UX, when your ESC does same thing as M button? Or the fact that you think text chat is not needed, because everyone uses mics and have hearing. Whats even worse, you launch game without push-to-talk button. Did you hire your designers from mechanic garage?
---
I have 8 Alts, 4 of which are maxed @ the 25K mark...money is no object and you'll never be able to match what I have monetarily....Not to mention Weapons you could only dream of or drool over.
---
k
---
This. First thing I thought when I saw the OP, was, great, the community is toxic.
---
Imo bloodied does not need the nerf because unlike TSE bloodied has a built in disadvantage
---
How is that word spelled? Massochist?
---
The gnomes sequeaks in 76, but in fo4 some manechins were too heavy to pick up meaning there was something inside of them (people? spy equipment?) there also was a capsized ship not far from the chinese sub with all the manechins surrounding a pile of bones, one of them even wielding a board and a note on the pile of bones that pretty much said he felt the things were moving and suggest they murdered him
---
I could never find anyone's camps, except the boring turret bases at Whitesprings.
---
üòÖ
---
You are missing Bezerker for Legendary mod. At 0 DR it adds 50% to base damage.
---
I'm disappointed that after you catch one it no longer glows. üòî
---
It's the same deal as backpacks, people have to do the quest to get them, can't be given them by others. In this case they have no choice but to find the tourist.
---
I love doing Claim Workshops and get overloaded with Cosmetic Plans. I have like 5 plans for daisy rugs....however I do still occasionally get random new plans that surprise me.
---
I have an entire stash of god roll weapons so I wouldn‚Äôt even think once about your weapons.. also totally flex your non-existent in game currency!! I bet you can buy a life with all that‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Bethesda took it for their Elder Scrolls: Blades mobile game.
---
For all weapons please
---
Do you have it on PC?
---
Ah thanks. So how many challenges do i need to complete to be able to buy  mod?
---
Not what I'm saying at all. What I suggested would simply show what the majority prefer to spend atoms on.
---
It's at the top, just to the right of the sign.
---
&gt;its unplayable
---
Except it's not.
---
Apparently
---
I'm on ps4 and the tea pot event was next to one of the power plant events on the right side of the map I believe
---
I‚Äôm a solo player too. Very rare I‚Äôll be in a group. But when there are challenges or quests that require me to work with a teammate I just ask whoever is close to me on the map and 9/10 they‚Äôll be down to help. Then I‚Äôll have made a new friend :D lmao but the community that I‚Äôve experienced has been nice enough to help when I ask someone.
---
Even if they did, it's sooo easy to get it again.  Spawn in, kill a ghoul, super mutant, or scorched...claim a workshop, build a turret, and you're done.  Takes less than 2 minutes (sans load times)
---
Haven‚Äôt finished the first tadpole mission (order of the tadpole) yet (need somone to revive) but I did the archery test and nothing happened am I missin something or have I just not progressed far enough?
---
We encountered a mob of these at the WS last night, hilarity ensued, a big chunk of me hopes they overlook this because it's great!
---
Nah, I got it on Xbox
---
1. Yes
---
2. No
---
3. Relogged, did nothing
---
4. Holding a dozen or so guns and not of them are being affected by any of my 3 armor pieces
---
5. I could work around this, but I have a feeling I have a bug
---
6. Yeah it isn't just the harpoon gun, was just using it as an example.
---
Honestly the last few days have been rough for me in this game. Bought a bloodied vats Crit 10mm SMG for 10k caps thinking it would be good for my bloodied sneak build but apparently it doesn't have barrel mods
---
Then buy 3 WWR pieces for a total of like 12k caps and none of them are working for me atm
---
Now I'm just over encumbered and broke lmao
---
/u/Sinisphere I was at your base last night and even purchased from your vending machine. Nice place and good prices - 5 star vendor, highly recommend if anyone gets a chance to stop by his place.
---
Wanna resell it? Lol
---
Make sure it's shallow water. It took us several tries before we got the revive option.
---
i agree this sucked however now I'm level 70 so those rushes are entertaining now
---
I heard bashing damages it faster been to busy rebuilding my camp to test
---
hmm now I feel like a jerk for selling them at 760 caps a piece, but hey capitalism?   
---
I have other easier crafting/farming ways to hit my vendor limit without selling the serums so I feel like i'd be wasting the hard farmed flux by selling it for less than 500, mind you I've given quite a few away free to awesome people I've met but I need to make back all the caps my buddy and I sunk in getting me all the plans.
---
I finally found it, thanks.
---
My alt uses a Prime Mutants Crossbow. Not even fully specced vats sniper yet and it still does work.
---
Most anything at that character's level is a one shot kill.
---
And with a sneak attack crit, I've dropped players that should have turned me into a red stain on the ground.
---
Ugh damn
---
Thanks for replying
---
You do understand the term "Spoiler" right?
---
Not once did you ask me nicely.. I would have gladly gone back and gone some screenshots for you, but you wanted to act a dick. 
---
0/10 - Use your eyes Jon Snow, and look for yourself.
---
Check my post how to get badges.
---
Ok so too much money in the system can mean things lose value or something....doubt this will effect computer games though with their piddly little economy, seems to be based on an idea more than fact......yeah I should stick to engineering, this goes well over my head.
---
Too many utilities, nothing to increase your damage output.
---
every 5 rads gained has a 5% chance to give you a mutation
---
...but does it still cut a bitch?
---
Back in my day...
---
I got my card from the quest and saved it until I was in a lobby I was confident could beat the imposter, held onto it for like a month, finally cashed it in, 2mins in the imposter is on the verge of death, I died, blank loading screen of death. Had to reload whole game, wasted card. Sucks.
---
Haha, that happened to me the first time I started it. Sunk cost. I've had better luck since.
---
Haha, well I'm flattered. I'm still working on stocking up. Hopefully once more funds start coming in, I can increase my ludicrous chem making output.
---
They are a quest item
---
Check my posts. There is event, that gave me 10 badges in 3hours farming.
---
Yup unfortunately OP doesn‚Äôt see that as the issue lmao. Instead he called me poor for not spending 20k on one fucking weapon hahahaha
---
And also there's a 25k cap limit so surely that negates the need to tax?
---
Yeah you sound more &amp; more like a kid as you go on.. keep embarrassing yourself haha
---
I hooked up my vending machines to a switch so I can turn it off and my camp won't be seen on the map. Only issue is if someone stumbles across it, they can still use it and buy things, which is a bit odd. Only shoppers you may get is foot traffic.
---
I play on pc. I tink the problem was my internet connection. I heave 3 internet connections and i use the best one but i heave issue in online games and i switched to the other internet connection and its working.
---
No, your gonna need to disconnect the power line running to it.
---
That depends what weapon you are using but you'll be able to take down 2 or 3 sorchebeast with this setup! :P just depends on your armor and weapons.
---
Not apples to oranges at all. Definitely fair to compare bullets to bullets in this case, it's just the real number we should be talking about is the kinetic energy of the round, which is 1/2 mass \* velocity squared. Because the 5.56 NATO has a higher velocity (pressure as you say) than 10mm auto, it kicks harder and hits harder.
---
But people are dumb, every gun debate comes down to caliber.
---
Stop typing low key, you're a grown man.
---
I‚Äôm pissed I didn‚Äôt wait to do that quest till level 50. We should be able to craft higher levels for all the quest items
---
Not true anymore. I've found broken pro snap deluxe cams in toolboxes around whitesprings since the patch. I had the Dane thought as OP. Fic some up and sell them for a few quid to those poor souls who lost their originals. Guess that's not an option.
---
Hey Jay GT waynestaton on now till about 4 EST
---
At one base, I played a banjo. The owner dropped out of his power armor and played the steel guitar with me. I have never played music with anyone else in this game. He even sent a friend request.
---
Oh hey! Thats mildy annoying to have to go to walmart but 25 bucks is 25 bucks! Thx :)
---
You've wasted my time and everyone else's. You have this spoiler tagged as though there's actual info in it.
---
Turns out your just a troll.
---
I loved it before the patch and it's even better now. Honestly now I look at disconnects as a chance to have a new player pool visit my shop.
---
Love it when that happens. All the instruments match up and actually work together.
---
Actually yesterday I got 3 new plans from one location, I was surprised
---
You need to earn 8 badges. I don't know how many badges a single challenge rewards, but the Tadpole ones only gave 1 each, so...
---
Did you troubleshoot your connection 4 months ago or did you assume then it was a game problem to and did nothing?
---
Thanks so much! My buddy and I were going to make this this weekend thanks for saving us so much time!
---
Thats not true, I've sold in total at least 25,000 rounds of 5.56, .50cal and shotgun ammo at 1:1 the last 2 days.  Xbox btw
---
You are technically correct.  The best kind of correct!
---
I think it sounds more like a coliseum or arena type PvP. What with all the expectations for victory or losing in the upcoming tests.   
---
Any how it says there are multiple tests. I don't think it'd keep track of multiple BR matches. I think it's gonna be some sort of arena based matches or possibly more like a traditional deathmatch mode.
---
There are two strategies. Pick one spot it spawns at and server hop until it shows up, or pick one server and go to every location where it can spawn until you find it. I did the second option and found it at like the fifth place I looked. It's mildly annoying, sure, but it's not impossible.
---
I disconnected just as it was killed earlier.... First time I've finished it and it didn't register... No items. No rewards. No point
---
No thank you but I appreciate the offer. I have 4K 10mm rounds to blow and this bad boy is going to be fun to use
---
There are three aspects of 76's story that I find most interesting:
---
* That, other than being Vault Dwellers, we are totally blank slates.  More blank than even the Courier.
---
* That Appalachia was, in many ways, doomed *regardless* of whether or not the bombs fell due to simple, old-fashioned greed.
---
* That we get to see a different side of the Fallout universe where all of this Atomic Age automation was *unwelcome*.
---
Oh my, that would be terrifying! Haha but must've been a sight to see
---
I enjoy most of the little bugs with the mobs. I especially enjoy when they go, for some reason, white bar and passive or a "ghost" of them are still there from someone else killing it, it means picture time!
---
2* legendaries with the explosive effect show their explosive effect in the description + the primary effect without having to inspect.
---
I didn‚Äôt wait either I did it around level 25
---
Boy that post title is whiny.. They're a quest item that you can't capitalize off so clearly that means Bethesda hates capitalism üòÇüòÇüôÑ
---
It‚Äôs not really like that, as soon as you become a tadpole/opossum scout, you unlock all the challenges at once
---
You can't get it to go down at all? I just made a really weak crossbow and bashed a few mobs and then repaired it. It doesn't have to be all the broken to repair it
---
what are all the possible locations
---
My camp is in WS! Might consider a move if it becomes too common. It‚Äôs a pretty big strain on supplies.
---
Anyone who spends a good amount of time watching trade subreddits can give you accurate value estimates for common to fairly uncommon to even rare items. Only super rare items are hard to price.
---
In some situations, it is
---
But honestly I've heard too many horror stories about people getting kill farmed in survival. Lol
---
In some situations, it is.
---
Rads are bad news man. You cant see it, you cant smell it &amp; cant even feel it until its to late. The thought of burning from the inside out is just crazy.
---
It‚Äôs just a matter of your tolerance for annoying bullshit. Clearly the remaining players enjoy the gameplay enough to look over the myriad stability issues. Lack of stability drove me out of this game and Anthem as well. I don‚Äôt have any major complaints about either of these games except the fact that neither of them run consistently smooth.
---
My camp is bland And boring as hell
---
There was also a bathroom in FO4 with a skeleton in the bathtub and like 4 mannequins around it holding like machetes.
---
Just chill out here or on other fallout 76 sub reddits. Get involved and post comments etc. This will help give you some exposure to people on Reddit and that'll help. See about joining Discord and see if any fallout 76 sub reddits have a discord channel and get an invite. I am not going to advertise other sub reddits but they ain't hard to find :) If you can't find them just send me a DM - no worries.
---
Also next time you put a shout out don't forget to put what system you have the game on (yes I know you edited this post so np), if you are in Discord or not and don't forget to mention if you have a mic or not. If you like you can hang out with me and my buds (we are all GMT time zone) but there is four of us so not too sure if you can 'join' the time (I think the max is 4 people in a team - that right)?
---
Either way I hope you find some buddies to explore with in Appalachia and have fun amigo :)
---
Hmmm...how deep is the water you're attempting this in?
---
I had a regular 10mm smg lvl 50 that I was using for a while. It wasn't my strongest gun but it was a good tagging weapon and melee gun since both of my mains are explosive. I always said it would be great to have a higher level perfect storm since I did that quest so freaking early. I've thought about getting an alt to 50 for another one but if I could find one for sale it'd save me a ton of time
---
Huh, I've never heard of that before. I like it
---
Jesus...what do just Explosive Handmades go for? I just sold a 3* Exterminators/Explosive/Damage Resist while aiming handmade for 2,500...
---
You can't get it to go down at all? I just made a really weak crossbow and bashed a few mobs and then repaired it. It doesn't have to be all the broken to repair itm
---
No it wasn‚Äôt decreasing at all, I used it for two hours last night both normally and bashing enemies and not a change. Going to test it tonight without the gunsmith
---
I have a level 35 junkies explosive lever I got at uranium fever when I was level 36. That gun was my main forever!  I can't bear to sell it.
---
Hah. "How Much Time Was Put In To Finding Them"... pffft. It's a game. What else were you gonna do with your time, other than... play games? Learn the piano? Teach yourself to speak Mandarin?
---
You were gonna play games. You got some make-believe rewards for playing make-believe stuff.
---
Allowing ALL players to sell their stuff in the machines, is what will fix the economy. It will drop the bottom out of the ridiculous pricing model that is used by a certain subset of players.
---
"taxation"... hehehhe. I can't tell if this post is serious or tongue-in-cheek.
---
Until someone posts it to youtube and then they're gone by the time you get there!
---
I also purchased a level 50 all rise for 1800 caps the other day. I don‚Äôt know if I over paid but it is definitely worth it
---
So I'll high key do what I want and type low key
---
How much you buy them for?
---
I haven't noticed a difference myself. Gonna stick with my cav!
---
PC need help on this one too, can reciprocate :)
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/bTGEaJ8](https://imgur.com/gallery/bTGEaJ8)  &lt; -- Signifcant changes to the area.
---
You did, I was blinded by fear of disappointment.  Sorry.
---
Oh ok! Thanks for the info!
---
This!!!!!
---
Maybe a dumb question, but did you actually exit the Vault with your 2nd character? It doesn't save it until you do.
---
Play with my kids they always need 6 stimpacks per whitesprings golf club
---
You get badges from the new event too
---
Havent played in a while could somone fill me in? Is it worth getting back into it? Definetly missed the social aspect of the game.
---
Mine worked in a small stream, barely enough to cover your feet. It didn‚Äôt work when the guys head was under water.
---
You know you can... walk... right?
---
Go to the Giant Teapot, and server hop a couple times. The dead tourist carrying the camera will be on one of the tables right infront of the teapot
---
*squirts bleach water into hair*
---
I think this is just a good common courtesy thing to do as well.    I would like to add that a really good way of doing this is to set up a actual switch that is attached to your vending machine so you can just turn that off without having to worry about wires and the like
---
Uh, I mean it‚Äôs not about having an advantage, it‚Äôs boring and there are no incentives.
---
No, you pay for fast travel to save time. It's a luxury to save time and it's also a great cap sink. You don't get your caps back because you paid to save time. I have a lot of caps I don't mind paying. Travel agent also saves a lot with FT cost
---
I sometimes walk because you find some neat off the path unmarked inclusions to the game which you'll never find while fast traveling. 
---
Speed demon also helps tremendously in cutting down walk times.
---
Also why does the smg weigh less than a pistol?
---
We can take this to PM if you want, but if you have max level heavy Vanguard robot armor, I‚Äôve been looking for a long time. I finally got a good RL the other day, but need the other pieces.
---

Enjoy :)
---
Thanks for the tips! I‚Äôll do some more digging around and such like you suggested.
---
It's been rocky but it's starting to turn itself around let's hope nuclear winter is even better
---
The whole inside looks different
---
Is that a knife for stabbing ghosts?
---
The lowest I've seen was 8k but I am kinda new to the sub so I can't say for sure.
---
The cost is there, for one reason, and one reason only... to take caps out of the game, as u/deja-vu stated. It's why the Vendor-bots pay ridiculously low amounts, why there's a travel cost, and why there's a 10% tax.
---
Since you don't want to say I'm just going to assume you have shit. Killing SBs isn't hard. Perked correctly you can do it easily with non-legendary pipe guns. All the high end weapons do is let you save more ammo while doing it.
---
You can't get upstairs anymore - says an ID is required. I bought a Responders ID off of someone but it doesn't work so idk how we're supposed to get up there.
---
Yep. High number of disconnects appear to be back after the latest patch. Game's been solid as a rock for me, save an occasional client-side crash, for weeks. This patch drops, and suddenly I'm seeing three or four disconnects a day.
---
I've had more interaction in the past 3 days than the last 6 months combined
---
Pretty cool idea
---
Shhhh...keep that one quiet!
---
I‚Äôve got a mutation guy, he sells em for 250
---
I specifically build a separate power conduit for my vending machine that has an inline switch inside my camp so that I can quickly/easily turn on/off the vending machine's beacon. :)    
---
Side note:  Vending machine can still be used as normal when beacon is off, you just don't appear on the map anymore. Handy :)
---
Never had access to the beta, I'll try equipping that perception perk card and gathering 20 more magazines before I submit my bug report.
---
Judging by your post history, you were only gone for 9 days.
---
Good lord
---
Lol, but I prefer the pistol tbh
---
I feel like there's a level 2 in Poseidon a few floors up that opens the door that leads into the reactor area. I think the ones on the outside of the building are level 3.
---
Big oof my dude. You could‚Äôve easily gotten twice the amount
---
Some tips for this event.      
---
**BEST TIP- Start the Dolly Sods Pioneer Scout Daily Quest before doing this event.** You will get all the ingredients to complete this daily while doing the Campfire Tales event.      
---
\-It can only be started after 9:00 PM in game time at Camp Adams. West Side of map, right above the Nuka Cola factory.  Server hop until you get in a server at around that time.    
---
\-On the collect kindling phase, only grab the **Dry Kindling** by the trees. If you grab Wet Kindling, insects will spawn.    
---
\-There are 2 variations of this event, one has you fight 3 waves of insects while keeping the fire burning with Dry Kindling on the last phase. The other one spawns a \~lvl 20 Legendary wendigo named Nia that you have to kill before the fire burns out on the last phase. The other phases leading up to the last are really easy and dont require any other tips. Just dont grab wet kindling.  
---
\-The 3 waves variation can be rather hard for a few reasons. The amount of bugs that spawn is insane even though they are low level, they can overwhelm you. They can stagger you and get in your way when trying to place the kindling on the fire. The fire burns out rather quickly. Also they can die on top of the fire itself leaving a corpse that makes it impossible to put the kindling on the fire, causing you to fail. Best way ive found to complete this is with a tesla rifle or a VATS/gun-fu rifle build. Stand on top of one of the buildings and just slay. Only jump down to get kindling and refuel the fire. Try not to kill bugs directly on the fire. On the 3rd wave it seems like its completed when you kill the crowned bug, which is usually a radscorpion.      
---
\- The other variation is really easy. Same steps leading up to the "keep the campfire burning" phase. When you get to this phase, instead of 3 waves of enemies, it just constantly spawns insects along with 1 Legendary Wendigo, Nia. She spawns almost immediately after this phase begins and is around level 20. Simply kill her before the campfire burns out and you complete the event.      
---
\-The rewards are the typical event rewards but about 1/3 completed events will also reward you with 1 Possum token thing. I grinded and got the High Capacity backpack mod for 8 tokens. It reduces your Physical and Energy Defense by 60 but increases your backpack carry weight to 120. My numbers could be off as im writing this at work. Hope it helps though
---
Right, it's okay for 2\*, but 3\* becomes an issue and you risk taking a gamble on that third effect, unless the owner is nearby (as BanGGnoRE stated above). Hopefully gets fixed in the next update.
---
I think another cool idea to encourage them would be to let you play them so you could get the buff anywhere.
---
Now all we need is some sort of settlement system.
---
I‚Äôve sold a lot of ammo also. Paying 1 cap beats grinding for mats to craft, I imagine.
---
Had the same happen last night, kinda. I'd been holding on to a free one but decided to use it to encourage some player deaths to get my scout stuff finished. 2 minuted in and the server dc's.
---
Agreed. It's my favorite as well!
---
That's actually a handy bit of info there ... the bit about the nipple through the wall first, as I hadn't realised there was one with a nipple. Ta for that, I'll give it a try
---
&gt;More like they are a symptom of the problem with the economy
---
Fair Point, I've been trying to tell people about some basic issues in that regards, but due to ignorance or selfishness (not sure which) they don't seem to care.
---
Did it actually remove your caps? I tried buying something out of a vending machine the other day... It asked me to confirm the purchase, but didn't take my caps or give me the bulk aluminum I was trying to buy.
---
Wow, now were on to something!
---
And? You could always turn it off as well if you prefer. Most of us prefer to have at least text chat to trade and coordinate SBQ fights etc.
---
This is for the ‚ÄúLITerally‚Äù achievement correct?
---
Because the vendor is actually just your stash and food spoils more slowly when stashed.
---
Ha!  I think the same thing.  Whenever I fast travel to my camp and turn around to head inside and the door is left open I am like WTF?  Just close the door when you leave.  We should be able to put a sign on the door that says please close when exiting.
---

---
Yeah the caps are gone, I had just topped off my character to 15k but now they've only got 12.5 left. I also went back to see if it was still in the vending machine, but it was gone from there too.
---
\+1
---
Hopefully with today‚Äôs patch in an hour or so it will help it. It‚Äôs been horrific on Xbox!
---
I've never been called a feral before.
---
Lots are saying do the possum challenges, tbh thats a waste of time. Just server hop camp adams for the campfire tales event. You have a chance to get 1 token each time you do it. Did it last night to get high capacity mod and tbh it was worth it because a lot of these new challenges are  broken or just not really something I'm looking to do.
---
If you're fast traveling a lot, then it will absolutely be like that. All your carried food will take a condition hit on fast travel.
---
I leave mine unpowered when I'm working on it.  People are apparently still able to buy out of it when no power is running to it- I just recently sold a few things while the machine was unwired.
---
I'm ok with the battle royale type stuff as long as they give us more PVE content. I want raids and stuff I can team up with other folks on. I like grinding for awesome gear and the obscure rewards.   
---
Honestly the PVP in this game is pretty bad and unbalanced.  I won't really care about the new DLC if this is all it is about.
---
WALK!? :O Ha-ha
---
Disconnects are always bad for a couple to a few days post patch.

For the love of god, martial artist, iron fist and barbarian over the QoL strength perks

I heard you can trade that plan because of bug even after learning, is that true? And are you on PS4?
---
Great write up, all you need is tesla rifle.

Hey, if you still need help with the kindness part I'm down. I need it too.
---
That joke went wooooosh
---
I agree. I wonder why we only get the blue color? Why not all the basic colors?
---
If your on a console,  which one?, I'd like to check out your bar
---
I would appreciate a couple of NPCs - even if it's just a couple more wanderers like Grahm. He made my day when I first found him and I just followed him around for like an hour cause he's great. I was really hoping there'd be a couple non-feral ghouls.
---
I did! I am so glad to have the camera back
---
"I never knew I'd..."
---
You better repeat that to anyone who comes to your camp
---
Three badges plus the other tasks in the quest! :)
---
Nope. I just did it. I don't know who is telling people that.
---
Thankfully this is how all the camera challenges work.  It would be wicked hard to get a picture of certain things together if this wasn't possible.
---
Answering your turning off vending question, I don‚Äôt think you can do it unless you‚Äôre at your camp. I put a switch on my vending machine so I can just turn it off or on when I want. Using the camp terminal does it too but also turns everything else on or off
---
I wasn't gonna say it. 10mm is way bigger than 5.56mm.
---
I'm sorry my character was born in a barn, his mother had to seek shelter from the protesters, as they were getting wild.
---
Give them a few more years lol
---
I had three players at my camp last night when I fast traveled back. I had just enough time to get out of my armor and then all hell broke loose. I normally get sb spawns there because I'm between two fissures, but two level 80s spawned in with about 20 scorched. They covered me while I got back in my armor, they all stayed and helped me fight off the beasts that were leveling my camp, and they even hung around to cover me while I rebuilt it once the coast was clear. One even dropped a poo bag with some building mats for me. It really made me feel like we were a bunch of survivors, banded together against a cruel and harsh wasteland. I truly believe 76 is getting to the ideal we were all sold on before launch.
---
I mean i pretty sure moth man exist too ubran legends but come from ppl supposedly sighting them
---
that doesn't sound too bad. I was starting to worry that a majority of badges would be needed or something....that would suck
---
You're free to make your own, if you'd like. But remember that not only is the list filterable (i.e. you can hide *everything* except the tasks for one specific badge, for example), but you can also use Ctrl+F to navigate. Please read the first post for information on how to filter. :)
---
You have 10minutes until i finish event after every server hop. Isn't it egout time to chose from those 200+ plans?
---
Daaaaammmnnn....I need that recipe. Need it.
---
I'm growing attached to them. They're my little adventure buddies.
---
What discord is this on?  LOL I've got a full set of sentinel armor that I have on a 2nd character that I never login with but could use teh caps!
---
Also Tru-Hiker is pointless... Switch it out for some ranks in Adrenaline. Also get yourself Scaly Skin and Twisted Muscles
---
Ya I dont get it either
---
hey, thanks for buying!
---
Maybe not, but thats what I had it listed in the vendor for. It sold quickly.
---
Oh, rock on. Thanks!
---
Seriously, how can I roleplay my inner Snake Plisskin without these mods?
---
Mostly just streams and such. It looks like it comes up to your knees.
---
I keep asking the other player to get into shallower water, but no one seems to understand....
---
like the Veiled Alliance questline does.
---
I think they're in there for people who may accidentally get rid of theirs.
---
It‚Äôs more of a consensus the deal, to see what people are really interested in so they can release more of that preferred interested type item
---
Cool I didn't know that. Is anything under 5 rads safe then, or is every rad a 1:1 percentage chance to mutate? Good reason to use lead belly before eating a bunch of food I guess.
---
Now that I think about it, I think I used to use lead belly all the time in the early game because I didn't have much else to use on Endurance perks.
---
all the best.
---
ps. know the spot well, your not the only one that has a camp there,at least 4 on ps4.the pond is busy as well,noticed since vendor,at least 2, 5 down below me under lucky hole, havent come across the 3 others on my pond for a whle. I picked my spot thinking that they'd be no-one else up here, leads to dead end - no thru traffic. views down to watoga,water,lead ,iron,berries,flowers,and piece and relitive quiet.
---
Didn't reckon on their being a spawn point at the other end of the pond.why would there be ?
---
log on, watch my camp build up, now have to defend it. usually in groups of 3. low level mutants, 3 to suck me in, go to loot them - 5/6 lev 68 in full armour waiting for me. wolves,dogs,scorched,bugs,rats,ghouls, buckets, and why is there a dead s/beast on me front doorstep. AND , they'll be waiting for me to come back,end not at the other end of the pond, oh no, right up close they be. Do you get any of this at your end ?
---
keep checking your pond.....mythical flatwoods AND the mothman like to spawn at the waters edge,right where the affored mentioned copper is. If you havnt found it - lead at the south cliff face.
---
That is such a great video oml...  
---
For the people who haven't seen it:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8)
---
Meanwhile my shop is in a lake with plenty of water and peace...unless you if you count scorchbeasts by a fissure site as a disturbance
---
How often do you get one shot?
---
Can't ever say that again!
---
But they're all going to be 25%. So you're going to have a huge weight penalty on all those partially charged cores. Not to mention reload times if you run gatling laser.
---
As well as evasive...
---
Also: hard lemonade. I can never, ever find that vendor. I hopped like two dozen times one night, trying to get to him, with no joy.
---
The easiest place for this turns out to be the encryptid event. Not only does everyone go STRAIGHT to the floor, but the pylon people should call for help. Race to fix them!
---
Torgue from borderlands narrated this whole post for me. Go Mr. Satan!
---
Because there are SO many bugs introduced in patch 9 ... I was hoping they wouldn't make us wait 2 weeks to fix it. Having said that, it didn't sound like they fixed issues introduced in the previous patch anyway!
---
Discconects bothers me the least
---
if no PvE then it's pretty much useless
---
Thank you for the vote of confidence and as it happens .... VERY WISE WORDS!! Guess what? They all showed up today, pretty much as you said. One day they weren't there, then "abra cadabra" the next day they are!
---
Hey, I see it as investment.
---
1) Saves me as average of 5 caps per trip.
---
2) get to farm mats and locations as I go.
---
3) get cheap goods when I get there.
---
So, in the end, I figure the average session puts about 200 extra caps in my wallet just by walking.
---
Spending 100 caps to save 100 caps make-a-no-sense to me.
---
Btw, when i try  to use another Xbox and a mule under a different user account the mules die instantly and can't be revived, only option is respawn. Is this due to their low level? Figured I could use one of them to do this but no luck. They just die lol. Worked on land though and I made sure it was shallow water in a creek at White springs
---
Fast traveling to camps is the real cap sink. It needs to stay
---
Now, I check to see if anyone is at my camp before hopping/logging.
---
This might be kind of a stupid question, but where is Iron Fist?  If you're going to run Unarmed, you're obviously going to want that.  While going Strength 15 is the right thing to do, you have way too many points wrapped up in weight reduction.  Things like Traveling Pharmacy and Sturdy Frame can be more situational - if you find yourself grossly over-encumbered, you can equip those cards.  But your main things should be Iron Fist and Martial Artist (which has a built-in weight reduction too).
---
In general, what you have here is a character that will be able to carry a lot of junk, but hit like a Radroach.
---
Corporate endorsement. ;)
---
Same, first thing I did after the update was walk around asking people if they would die so I could heal them for the tadpole quest.
---
Totally needed.
---
üòÇ I have seen some Piper clones or ones that strongly resemble her. My friend with the Elder Maxson one does freak people out as he loves to see what people have done with their characters, especially if they look like somebody else. He can get a bit in your face. üòÖ
---
Couldn‚Äôt find you lol
---
They only recently became droppable with legendary mods which I am extremely grateful for
---
Thankfully not! You need three Tadpole badges to unlock your backpack, and the maximum cost for an upgrade is eight Possum badges, but some mods are much cheaper. I recommend the Swimmer, Archer and Athlete badges for Tadpole, they're the easiest to complete and you'll get your backpack in no time! 
---
Also, remember that you can craft higher level backpacks at an armour bench, so once you unlock your regular Tadpole backpack (which I think is level 20...?), you can craft up to a level 50 one which gives +60 carry weight!
---
They were at the Grafton train station for me as well.
---
so i could learn it and give it back to you? lol nice. im cool with that if you wanna do that IGN: Jimusmc
---
&gt; Wait the increased carry weight mod adds weight and increases DR/ER?
---
No, it *decreses* DR/ER:
---
&gt; Increase carry weight mod gives +120lbs and reduce enegy and radiation rezistances by 60.
---
Oh man, I am so sorry... I just deleted my other comment because I thought I was replying to someone else. Didn't mean to be a dick. In general though you'll want to minimize utility perks in favor of things that will maximize damage output... But if you aren't struggling then there's no need for it.
---
That sucks. The only thing I can think of is the water being too deep to "detect" if you will the other performable action and so it just wants you to take the water. I don't really know what else it could be unless there is just some kind of bug
---
Woah woah woah - you just have to be easy on your ol' girl fella lol
---
Be gentle, tender and care her and don't squeezin in hurry... It's a Brahmin and not a ketchup bottle ya know?
---
What system you in, I‚Äôll buy one
---
It adds a negative amount :)
---
Sounds good. Add me up
---
10% bonus xp also the other person didn't mention that. Also you can stack foods, like you used to be able to with chems before. If you stack foods properly you can get pretty damn good buffs.
---
Of course
---
When you buy the plan, it doesnt work like other plans you buy. It automatically consumes/learns it when bought. Instead of sending the plan to your inventory for you to click and learn. Just go to your armor bench, craft a new back pack and then mod it, like you would armor. You will see the High Capacity mod option. You have to be Possum rank to be able to craft the backpack though. The High Capacity mod cant be put on the Pioneer Scout backpack you get from the Tadpole quest.
---
Found one there last night, bottom of the hill from vault 76 next to the small pond between the hill and the lumber mill, also the lumber mill is always a reliable spawn for ticks too
---
I puked at a vending machine last night, but the person was selling way overpriced things. A nuclear keycard and a cranberry bog map for 25k each among other ridiculously priced items.
---
There are many valid criticisms of Bethesda Fallout when compared to 1/2/FNV. But bugs aren't one of the valid complaints. Well, it's a valid complaint when talking about the game itself. But comparing buggy-ness to other Fallouts doesn't make Bethesda Fallout any worse. Especially compared to New Vegas. 
---
FNV was the buggiest Fallout I ever played. FNV at release was terrible. Much worse than F3 or even F76. There were constant crashes caused by nearly every kind of action. It was FNV that taught me the reflex to press F5 before and after everything. Planning a conversation? F5. Finishing a conversation? F5. You see an enemy in the distance? F5. You've closed to the enemy but still not engaged in combat? F5. Going AFK in main menu? F5... Really. Bethesda Fallouts are rightfully notorious for their bugs, but FNV takes the cake. Obsidian might have made the best Fallout storyline and factions, but they've messed the game files and the engine like amateurs.
---
And then there was the performance, which was yet again caused by Obsidian messing inside the engine. The game was nearly unplayable for the first months for many people, becaue they've broken GPU detection and related stuff). I had really bad framerate with LOW preset. After I used a dll that faked a GPU (i think it was GF 8800) I suddenly had relatively good framerate on MEDIUM.
---
Sorry for the rant and history lesson, but it irks me when people try to make bugs the reason why Bethesda Fallouts don't work. If it were the truth, then FNV would crash and burn hard. Well actually, it somewhat crashed and burned. The reason why it had the Metacritic score of 84 (and therefore not reaching the bonus limit of 85) was the terrible performance.
---
I can help around 3:00
---
so how does this work now that players are immune to damage? and camps are immune to damage?
---
Now we just have to start procreating the next generation !!
---
Yeah, if you need a Honey Beast, visit the Freak Show and photograph the corpse there.
---
Just be sure to mind the Mirelurk Queens.
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúthat boys hole‚Äù
---
What system you on?  I wanna see it now.
---
Yeah, as long as the name shows in the  upper right corner,  you're good. Another hint, be a battlefield photographer at Scorched earth. I got about 15 bodies in one photo and checked off a crapload of stuff.
---
That sounds like a method to move caps to and from other accounts maybe.  Or hoping someone misclicks.
---
I got one this morning. I think they're still being awarded occasionally.
---
i got disconnected while traveling to the last location
---
I dropped my camp in a tree just down the hill from the legendary vendor. Figured folks might appreciate a fast travel point there that wasn‚Äôt loaded with Scorch. 
---
The spot is loaded with gulpers and other wildlife, so repairs have been pretty costly. But so far it seems like a fairly well trafficked spot by players and there‚Äôs a pond, so there‚Äôs plenty of water about.
---
Well, that's the thing. We're also getting Vault raids in Nuclear Winter, which are PvE high-level dungeons with objectives and such. Really, I would estimate this mode would be about 30 percent of the update, not all of it.
---
Come visit my camp, too! All the resources you need in or next to the barn (purified water, corn, tatos, blackberries, milk, etc.)
---
All instruments available to play.
---
Two cabins off near the edge to rest your weary bones, or a large tent if you want fresh air.
---
Outhouse/bathroom next to the main house. 
---
Comfy space in the main house full of plants to rest or chat with folks. 
---
I moved after vending went live and nothing is locked anymore.
---
Possible.
---
It only weights 1lb.  You could have a few backpacks in your inventory^* and switch as needed.
---
(*: a few backpacks in your backpack).
---
One of the Whitespring vendors sells them with low conditin, got one yesterday to complete the hunters badge
---
I had to use plan for fridge mod. Check you inventory!
---
How close can you build to each other ? I‚Äôm only lvl 4
---
Depends on how popular the item is. I will generally go a little over the value and the more popular the item the higher I price it.
---
That was my poor attempt of making a joke. Yeah, I had close to 20k in caps and use Travel Agent all the time to help decrease the FT cost. While I would like to have a lot of free time to walk from place to place, unfortunately, life responsibilities get in the way, so I have to have an agenda for what I hope to accomplish each play session; fast traveling just makes that a little easier. Before player vending, I rarely ever bought anything from vendor bots. I never tried speed demon as I don't like the increase hunger/thirst it brings...I know, I can equip Class Freak to negate the negative effects, but until I change my mind, I'll just stick with marsupial.
---
I just got one
---
It's true, i just wanted to type the title of this post. I love this game and never stopped playing since it came out
---
Yeah I guess so. Gonna do some further testing today to see which is more overpowered in most situations.
---
The way I saw yesterdays test was anyone with good gear can wipe a full assassin sent build out basically instantly. (i have be handmade build, also tried tse laser and exlosive radium, and everything other than the radium cleans out ppl).
---
Standing still is a death sentence. Vats crit is a death sentence. No assassin sent/cav armors is a death sentence. We have no way to protect ourselves properly against eachother when it comes to endgame PVP.
---
Ive kept the memory of my pump called hunter sinceive started my character. Im up to hunter IV now
---
this happened to me yesterday as well.  Ends up the vendor originally had the item renamed, and posted that for sale.  No way for me to see this, since it was just identified an Executioners Grog Axe.  I purchased it, lost the credits, but wasn't in my inventory.  Vendor didnt have it either when I mic'd up and asked, and I have no reason to not believe him.  Save your time on opening a ticket with Support.  They stated they will not restore lost items.
---
I would if people would stop locking theirs. I'd love to come see what people did with their camp and yet I find at least half or more of the camps I come to are locked up (what, you don't want to brag? Hell, it's not like i can do anything to the camp now even if I wanted to be destructive).
---
I did it in the pond next so the missile launch tube for silo alpha. Water was almost up to his shoulders. He dropped 2 grenades onto himself and I revived and got both challenges complete.
---
And always one in each hand.
---
Ya.  25% cores are garbage.   Ever since that nerf I see cores left in empty chassis all the time.  I personally don‚Äôt touch them.
---
You may change the outcome of the story, but you (or the story) doesn't change the world. That's why you cannot continue after the final slideshow - because they didn't want to let you back into the world that doesn't reflect the slideshow just seen...
---
Thats in 20minutes right?
---
If the seller removed the item at the same time. it takes ur caps cause it thought item was still there
---
It's not bad at all.  Just stash your aid.  
---
I had to do the "Action Hero" challenge for that weapon.  Gathered all the materials, went into survival naked (I didn't want any chance of dropping anything if I get attacked) and did the quest.  I had to run through morgantown to scrap 20 ranged weapons.  It was actually really easy, and exhilarating knowing that I could get attacked at any moment...when I checked the leaderboard, there was only a 1st place dude, and I was in 2nd, and there was no 3rd...so there were only two of us on the server.
---
Maybe if you give it a bit it will appear? Seems like I've had something similar happen before, except it would have been before vending machines, so I'm not sure exactly
---
Damn, on my day off of course. Hopefully it's not 3 hours long
---
Wait, they locked their vendor behind the doors? Honestly though most likely they put the vending machine in and forgot they had set the doors to be locked in the build menu.
---
Should be easy to do, though. With fast travel to camps with vendors and a lot of camps having a brahmin, it shouldn't take too long to find one.
---
i went to the bunker and there weren't any plans
---
I‚Äôve been having a great time buying and selling. I have found useful things and folks have bought a bunch of my stuff that was taking up space.  It was pretty cool to see three folks waiting at my machines.
---
Two other things to keep in mind:

\7. If the armor is broken, it won't confer any bonuses at all. That includes DR and ER and perks especially
---
\8. The weapon weight bonus isn't 20%+20%+20% for a 60% weight bonus; it's 0.8x0.8x0.8 for a ~50% weight reduction. If that harpoon gun weighs ~20 pounds and you've got a mod that adds another ~6, that might be the right weight after all.
---
yep. been doing the water park.
---
Hahahaha well..at the same time..yestersay i bought a god roll armor piece for 91 caps..and a qe double barrel for 300 before that.   Im sure itll balance out eventually. But right now gheres no reason to be spending 20k on anythibg because a few hops and caps spent on ft..you can find some dope shit for the L O.
---
I have all my shit at reddit prices though..miss me with that cheap shit.
---
Every update comes with a hotfix. Bethesda cant atall seem to get their update right
---
A plastic frame would be nice, possibly for weight reduction.. A steel one might be good for the bashing boost. Aluminum for accuracy/damage.
---
Me again! So unfortunately I'm starting to think we have some bug in xEdit, or your script or both. I don't know.
---
So I re-exported every block under  [00] SeventySix.esm (AD0538BE) \ Worldspace \ 0025DA15 &lt;Appalachia&gt; Which seem to form a grid -4 through to 3 in X and Y (however two anomalous blocks exist at (12,0) and (-6,-7)) and now my mapping tool has *some* more data to work with, but it's clearer to me now that some blocks are simply omitted. I'm going to try re-exporting them again but I wanted to see if you had any ideas.
---
[See here](https://i.imgur.com/KjeI8pk.jpg), it shows how I'm clearly missing entire blocks. Interesting in a symmetrical pattern, too.
---
Thank you everyone for your help, patience, advice and sense of humour. It is very much appreciated!
---
I absolutely welcome and support friendships between all levels of players!
---
You are your own individual and should never feel pressured in to joining teams if you feel it impacts on your play experience. But that should not stop you from networking üòä
---
Pretty much, yes.
---
Feed me please.  Then I‚Äôll peruse. 
---
Just like Ikea
---
Go to someone's vendor camp that has other players there and ask if someone will help you. Chances are they will.
---
And I thank you for them! But honestly, someone dropped a ton of plans for me at that level a couple weeks back and I dropped a 1 star legendary I‚Äôd acquired but couldn‚Äôt use til level 50 for them.
---
Ive had a fight like this by overseers camp that involved the whole server. You can imagine how that went. This was in adventure too so knowone would die
---
Whats even going on here??
---
LISA NEEDS LAMINATE
---
You do you. Whatever fits your play style and preferences that's the beauty of this game!
---
It depends on what standards you want to apply. There isn't a single "Fallout standard". When it comes to story and factions, then maybe, I could see it. But when it comes to gameplay, lore and exploration? No way.
---
I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum. I love barely charged cores. I keep all of my 95 percent and above cores in my box and run the barely charged ones, so it knocks them out quicker and I dont have as much of them to hold onto after a few days of a grind.
---
I do lol i stay there for the events to get lead
---
That's because they need to get the patch out to their load testers ... AKA, the playerbase.  :-P
---
Thanks I‚Äôll give this a look tonight too, I‚Äôve not been back to white springs in a long time. The last time I was only a low level and died pretty much instantly haha
---
The broken ones are junk and so can be sold or put in containers.  If you fix them they're MISC and so can't be sold or put in containers.
---
It‚Äôs down stairs from the locked door. A responder sitting in a chair in the basement is holding the key in their hand.
---
You can say that again!
---
I‚Äôve been buying them for 500 caps. Not bad tbh. Bless those type of players.
---
 "I would estimate this mode would be about 30 percent of the update, not all of it. "
---
That would be ok with me!
---
Damn. My day off and I was just about to log in. Hopefully it isn't for hours.
---
H¬≤O¬≤ actually. it's in other lyrics
---
PSN=MyTurkishPrison
---
I wont be on right after the update, but I am more than happy to help this evening.
---
Pretty sure it was either in the black powder store or the be for who's in the spa next to the pink Assaultron.
---
I would definitely participate (on pc, sn: tararynieyn) but wouldn't that be a tease to the poor unfortunate souls just coming out of the vault with nothing? :D
---
its almost as if there are more than one type of person in the world. FFS. youre just griping to gripe. you are just as bad.
---
All of the camps I‚Äôve seen so far have been super fucking lazy. Just a quick floor, maybe walls, a little generator and the vending machine. I say boo to you good sirs and madams. Have some pride in your wasteland digs! Fucking especially if you‚Äôre going to try and get people to spend caps at your shit shack.
---
Basic +60lbs.
---
With mod +120lbs, -60rr, -60er
---
A couple of different presets (that you can rename) would be amazing. Upvote all day long from me!
---
Starter kits for the desperate who want them
---
I still have turrets because mole rats came through and wrecked all my crops :(
---
MOO-MOO RESTRAINING ORDER, MUST FOLLOW OR BEATINGS FOLLOW
---
Awesome thank you! And I can server hop and repeat this event?
---
They're immune from player damage unless you're engaged in PvP with the person, from the patch notes:
---
&gt;**C.A.M.P. Damage Protections:** C.A.M.P. objects and Structures no longer take damage from other players as long as the defending player, and their C.A.M.P. defenses, are not hostile against their attackers.
---
:)
---
Marsupial and speed demon for sure
---
My friend always finds it weird how I always shut doors upon entering or leaving. Lol. Glad I'm not the only one thinking this
---
People have mentioned a whitesprings hub.
---
South of it I see more bases going up in close proximity to each other
---
It freaking great. Still a few bugs to work out but it feels like an online game now. More people are active. Helping each other. Player vendor was the best idea. Get back in it. I'm on ps4. Like  to help out others.  Mre605rc
---
No one believes me, but I still full heartedly believe it‚Äôs because they ran into a bug or issue without reducing caps received. If it was a duplication glitch or unlimited cap glitch, good on them for finding a way to fix it. And of course they would be cryptic about it, they don‚Äôt want us to know what they‚Äôve already found and fixed.
---
Yeah but free range gives non exciting plans if you aren't a melee character from what I can tell.
---
Yeah just stand at camp adams and start grinding.
---
i really like that you have to travel to peoples camps, lets us show off our handy work and see what others have done.
---
For the brahmin, go to Pleasant Valley Station and travel due east and follow the water. There's a pond around there that usually has 3 brahmin swimming. If someone's already milked one recently, nothing will happen when you try and you'll need to come back later. If they refuse to let you milk them, they will grunt and kick at you and you'll have to try again later after the cool down period.
---
I for one am selling a ton of ammo. Sold 5k caps worth of 5mm today alone.
---
I've been dropping items for free at my camp even with the machines and when I visit someone's shop which has things I liked. Try to give a few things so I would definitely do free starter kits. I wish we could put together a survival kit in the game.
---
just server hop at whitesprings resort.  The dude is always there for me.  
---
I swear, kids these days can't do anything themselves.
---
Most of the stuff I've got is no more than 2k, and that's a 3* leather chest piece. I'm trying to be somewhat fair, but if I too high hopefully someone would tell me.
---
I'm a bit slow and glitchy til my camp finally finishes setting itself up.
---
Yeah, screw the people who call this whiny.  I've been thinking about this a lot, since I have a friend who has had difficulty finding the camera.  Why do we have this class of quasi-Atomic Shop items we cannot share, cannot drop, cannot sell, and yet are obtainable by anyone?  And I can't think of a single, compelling reason for why this class exists, especially with the camera, since so much seems to ride on it now.
---
The entire point of player vending, let alone player interaction at all, is to enable us to provide services to each other.  You may not know how to do these things, but I do, and I can share this with you for a price.  Or maybe I'm generous and I'll just give it to you.  So, why is there an arbitrary mechanism blocking this?  A backpack goes up in flames because I share it with someone?  What sense does that make?
---
IMO:
---
* The camera and Ansel should always spawn and be available for everyone who walks by.  There's no reason to make this thing rare.
---
* Let us craft, sell and trade cameras and backpacks.
---
* Don't allow a player to use a backpack *optimally* without doing the Pioneer Scouts quest.  After the quest, give them some perk that lets them pack more into it and apply mods.
---
I have a tse one, but the recoil is awful. Can you post a screen of the attached mods?
---
I would definitely do this if I had the will power to actually progress in the game
---
I had my marsupial serums for 500 caps each, but no one has bought any. I thought my price was reasonable .\_.
---
.... what dude? I was trying to use photo mode
---
Hmm...that kind of makes me want to start looking into those challenges a bit more honestly. Are the rewards typically as good as a 3* Legendary Gatling Gun though? Don't want to be wasting time or effort on junk. Lol
---
I guess you and us will figure it out once you log on... lol
---
My username is Torble you can join our group
---
Just reboot the game and the shop refreshes.
---
No need to delete save data.
---
I have 3 xboxs and haven't had to do that once. Just the reboot of the game.
---
Plus deleting the save data deletes your pictures I think. (I uninstalled once and lost the photos.)
---
I swear - you‚Äôre why people don‚Äôt like gamers. Asshole
---
happened to me numerous times as well so far...sucks that I get stuck in their base and don't want to pick the lock to get flagged yet their vendor is outside.
---
Hoping this is what my bar will become once I get to play this weekend and activate my vending machine. Had a spot on the right side of the dry lake bed (New Gad) in between all the vacation mansions right on the road since beta just hoping people would stop by. This story gives me hope!
---
I had a really cute little house on a cliffside with a nice view. It wasn't amazing but I liked it. 
---
I moved and started from scratch. At first I regretted all my life choices because my new place was garbage. But after a couple restarts I have a really awesome space. I was able to build a house, a barn, a bathroom, two simple cabins for travelers, a farm, AND decorate within the budget.
---
My old place had way less stuff and was still capped somehow.
---
If you're on PC, come check me out at the junction of 87A and 91. Under the electrical tower.
---
It‚Äôs seem to become a new fallout 76 meme made by the YouTuber the Internet historian. Who recently made a video about all the drama surrounding the introduction of fallout 76 (in no particular order). 
---
It‚Äôs the sort of video that FO76 haters will refer too for years and years to come without you looking how far the game has progressed just like how so many people can‚Äôt consider elder scroll online to be an elder scrolls game.
---
I have an issue with hoarding in that game and to me weight reduction seems to be a must to keep the materials I need for base building. I get they don't make much sense for straight damage, but it seems like if I don't have them I become over encumbered in seconds.
---
Hmm...the 120 lbs mod would definitely be worth it...
---
If my camp can't be placed (which is frequent) he would be gone anyway so how would I know then?
---
Why are you even here? Cringe reddit elitist lol
---
Put your vending machine inside to coax them in to your humble abode!
---
Have you tried a furious tesla? I've got one and I can't figure out its mechanics. I can't tell if the effect stacks with only the first enemy hit or all of them.
---
get your resolute veteran in adventure mode while you can!  It's sooo easy though...don't be scared to go into survival to do it.  It's actually quite exhilarating.
---
Nah, that's just the new stealth blade idea they are trying out.
---
I love my Quad CB
---
Is there a way are I can print this post out in game and stick it on the side of my CAMP?
---
I found hard lemonade for 50 capsü§ë but I‚Äôve found that effigy ONCE &amp; got robbed
---
Well i guess hes gone then.. thanks for answering your own question :)
---
No it's not. Otherwise, if I bought a TSe at 2k, you bought one at 5k and my sister bought one at 9k, what's the price ?
---
I share inspirational 3 and team with low levels, I don't help them unless they ask me to besides carrying them through everything
---
I got a quad crossbow once as well and thought "Holy shit this might make it useful" because I thought it would reload one bolt and then it would have the 4 at my disposal.
---
Nope. Gotta reload them all one by one. Which blows. It was fun though to quickly put 4 arrows into someone's head and then run away to reload.
---
Weird, it auto learned mine when I bought it. It was never in my inventory but im able to craft it. Ill grind the fridge one tonight and see what happens with it. Does the fridge mod change the look of the backpack at all? The High Capacity mod didnt for me.
---
Same
---
I had trouble with this yesterday. Took us a solid 30 minutes. One of us ended up jumping off the pipes that run into water at Grafton steel.  Aim for the yellow bit of the land and it should be shallow enough trigger a revive. Then the other walked over to the pioneer camp, lured the ghouls to him while he stood in shallow water. I waited for him to die and instantly revived. Hope this helps!
---
Thanks for letting me know! I will find it!
---
Oh man, that would be amazing, where everyone can just buy a vacant lot and build something in it. You'd get some problems with connecting to a server where it's already occupied, but if there are 24 lots, there would also be at least one vacant one. I support this idea!
---
Thank you so much :)
---
I even had one shitty griefer set it up so you would get locked in his house between 2 doors and forced to pick a lvl 0 lock to get out. As soon as you pick it he would kill you. It was so shitty and shady and it sucks children like that exist.
---
Read the Ever Upwards poster at any train station, or get it free in the Atom Shop, place it in your CAMP, and then read it.
---
Train station poster as usual. Look for the Scout poster next to Sheepsquatch and Fraternity party.
---
Yeah I suppose. Just sucks man. I hate waiting all damn day for them to re-open servers I just wanna play the gameüòû I don‚Äôt even have any sort of issues in-game so I don‚Äôt wanna wait hours to fix something that doesn‚Äôt affect me
---
no,it has formaldehyde in it
---
Atomic Store, free poster. Place it in your CAMP and then click on it to activate the quest.
---
So would I be able to tame another? Is taming and pacifying the same? I know it's the same perk card.
---
All the missions can be started by going to train stations and activating a poster.
---
I‚Äôve been running my Bloody/Explosive Shotgunner whose PA 100% of the time and under 20% all the time as well.  I‚Äôve never been one shot, not to SBQ or Mirelurker Queen acid.  I have been dumb and let the imposter Sheep Squatch laser beam kill me because I was lazy and didn‚Äôt move, but I had seconds to react in the beam.  For Bloody PA build and to avoid ever being one two or three shotted, work Blocker, Dodgy Nerd Rage and Emergency Protocol into your build.
---
On my Unyielding Bloody unarmed character, I don‚Äôt have near the amount of time I have on him as I do my shotgunner 400 hours vs 40 or so.  I still haven‚Äôt been one shotted on him either and I‚Äôve done all very same fights SBQ, mire lurker what not.  For his build I worked in Blocker, Dodgy, Nerd Rage, Serendipity (doesn‚Äôt work in PA).  I will admit out of PA you‚Äôre very squishy but with the right perks nothing should one shot you.
---
I can link you both toons full builds if you‚Äôd like.
---
Ditto.
---
No idea. Maybe tonight I'll lock the escape route and see XD
---
Feel free to come test ;)
---
I've only done two...the action hero, and this one.  Next week is a Legendary Deathclaw Gauntlet i believe, and the week after a legendary twoshot double barrel.  
---
I'm going to start going into survival more often.  It completely changes the way you play the game.  It's exciting.
---
Okay, that makes more sense and I really wasn't trying to criticize you and my reply was a bit blunt and hasty because my phone was dying.  You manage your build anyway you want sir!  Most players I've met run the Starched Genes perk for the obvious reasons and I just assumed you were too because you were keeping the mutations.  You know what happens to people who assume too much.  Since mutations are a function of total accumulation of rads over time, it makes perfect sense that you could catch one from eating food or swimming without rad protection of some sort.  Being bloodied keeps you right close to that mark all the time so I'm not surprised they pop up more now for you.  Again sorry if I came off as being critical.
---
Lol I did the same thing!
---
Link please
---
U said u saw in patch notes that you cant tame another. So no you cannot tame sloths... you answered ur own question again lol
---
I somewhat agree.
---
For me the essence of Fallout is the exploration of post-apocalyptic world. The exploration can be done via quests, NPC dialogs or literal exploration. I prefer the literal exploration. I like to see or find something myself, not to be told about it. I also prefer the mosaic of small stories (side quests) than a semi-linear questchain like in FNV. This is the reason why I prefer Bethesda Fallout to old Fallout. Bethesda may not make the same Fallout as Obsidian/Interplay, but for me Bethesda captured the spirit of Fallout much better.
---
And when it comes to comparison between Bethesda Fallouts... well, I'm not sure if Fo76 wins outright, but I've always had inclination towards online games. Not MOBA/BR type online games, but games where I can show off my progress and customization. Where I can meet strangers, help them out and then go away without being forced into cooperative gameplay or without being artificially segregated from other players. Basically, I enjoy MMOs. And Fallout 76 felt for me like MMO-lite. It scratched the MMO itch without going full on checking every necessary MMO checkbox. And now with the player vending, I can actually consider it true MMO-lite game...
---
Same deal with me. level 105 and solo. What i usually do is follow these message boards and do nukes with players.  Get friend requests here and there and usually accept if they seem normal. Go to looking for group on xbox live and you can group up there too.
---
its got to the point where is see the same regulars trading and playing
---
I would assume the Legendary Vendor would have a static inventory like the other vendors to avoid server hopping, but her inventory would change week to week to encourage logging in and grinding away.  I'm willing to bet the prices for the good 3\* legendaries will be high too.  Given that they introduced the scrapper a week before the vendor hits for us to build up our wallets.  We would have enough to buy one, two, maybe three items but then all our scrip runs out forcing us to go back and get more, farming - selling - repeat until her inventory refreshes.  It is a good tactic to keep people logging in and playing each day.  Of course this is all just speculation but it seems like something Bethesda would do.
---
The bestiality badge obviously.
---
Also true! But the s‚Äômores &amp; tent are not exactly exciting lol. S‚Äômores takes too much effort to craft &amp; the tent.. it‚Äôs a tent I mean that‚Äôs it lol. You should be able to get backpack skins or mod‚Äôs or outfits something.. I mean there‚Äôs no point.. now I just got the tent plan so I can farm &amp; sell those plans &amp; recipes but shit
---
No, I saw you couldn't pacify them, said nothing about taming.
---
Were you not born in a Vault?  KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED!
---
Nah.
---
i have a 3 star instigating super sledge...what are you looking for with the other 2 stars, i think mine has the 40% power attack buff but i cant guarantee, might be on my 3* stalkers super sledge?  xbox?
---
damage mitigation my friend. in power armor and all perks, no meds, my bloody gatling does 620 damage.its only one star. my point is, with dodgy and other perks you can survive HARD under 20% health.
---
Mine would be Solo, Party, CAMP. Boom. Done.
---
+50 from pocketed.
---
And you can reduce weight of different kinds of things by 20% from each legendary. Or have +1streng in every part.
---
I never liked PAs.
---
With all maxed melee build you can make 400lbs without PA.
---
Game isn't even on Steam.
---
The tadpole event has a section that requires you to revive a player while in water. That's the only one I need to unlock the backpack so just asking for help with that. Nothing exciting
---
i do, i use the same tag "Kayman18" on fall76 i should be on around 5 EST tonight
---
if you still need lemme know and ill hook up the Microphone tonight lol
---
stupid lack of text chat
---
Why?
---
Great weapon for just sneaking around.
---
On the plus side that stuff has almost no value to the average player.
---
Why? Its basic economics. Things are only as valuable as people are willing to pay.
---
It doesn‚Äôt make much sense to set your camp up for fast travel to the one free fast travel location on the map. Which is why somewhere like Whitesprings is popular. Lots of foot traffic and splits up fast travel costs if you want to hop from WS to cranberry bog etc
---
Server-side only hotfixes - which from the wording I assume this one is, there is no mention of client-side updates - are fairly swift.
---
They will probably get it out of the way within the hour.
---
same deal. 
---
i server hop but always check before i leave. if someone is nearby, ill hold off
---
Some of them have already been in Falllout -- the H&amp;K G11 for example.
---
My camp was floating and looked terrible, so I added a central support column.  Now it looks like a (VERY TALL) mushroom.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uwtc8T7)

That would be awesome. 
---
Even better, add a projector and screen that slides through a chosen selection of photos on the big screen for other people to see.
---
Skill2 terminal - watoga transit hub
---
Iam only selling legendary maxlvl weapon between 500 an 3000 Caps atm. But yes he probably thought it was too expensive. Still no need to be disrespectful. Iam of course not making things cheaper because someone got sick in my Camp lol.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59
---
So's a bloodbug probiscus but those can be sold. They're not a quest item until you've found one with the bucket list on a tourist; however they *are* tool required to complete challenges.
---
Pacify and Tame are 2 different things in context of world beasts in fo76. The question was whether the patch note meant both or just pacify?
---
I tried reboot and it wouldn't work for me after several times.  but the photos bring lost of very good to note. I don't do much with photos so didn't notice. Thanks for the info
---
Had a level 18 visit my vendor station. Gave them some meds and simple food plans for free.
---
Options button, triangle
---
You mean like the H&amp;K G11?
---
Everyone keeps posting crazy cool things they‚Äôve found, and I just keep seeing crazy priced junk weapons/armor lol. I‚Äôve put like 3* bloodied up for chump change and nothing. The biggest sellers for me have just been aid items and a couple junk items.
---
Think I‚Äôm just getting bum servers or something.
---
TFW I already have the Minigun Skin. Found it on a dead scorched. it is was self named as the gilded minigun
---
I earned mine in Adventure mode.
---
Some guy on reddit made post, that he learned high capacity mod and then gave it to friend, which done same and give to next friend. Sadly they were on PC :(
---
I don't think it change apearance at all. It is more like costume not armor part.
---
Camera quest is easy. Not hard to get
---
Might just have to give that shot
---
Quick question, are these account wide?
---
If I create a new 'toon' and discover these locations do they count towards the challenge? (not only those, I have a fair amount of these glitched... flora, holotapes, all sorts...).
---
Weird is wrong
---
my main is a quad explosive double barrel, base dmg on double barrel is so high and then you get the 8 round "magazine" with a quick reload speed...
---
Awesome idea.
---
Take my upvote
---
&gt; 1847 Walker Revolver: the Texas Behemoth
---
The actual big iron.  Noted for its tendency to explode if mistreated.
---
Two shot explosive needed a big nerf, it was all benefit with no drawbacks, huge damage increase and even reduced ammo consumption. 
---
Bloodied has a big built in drawback, I don‚Äôt think the perk in and of itself needs nerfing, it was only OP when combined with the OP untouchable armor effects - having one hit health isn‚Äôt a drawback when no one can damage you. Get rid of that and bloodied is good. 
---
I agree with the person who said some of the others need a buff, especially berserker. Having no armor seems as bad as no health.
---
I‚Äôm the same way. Two are sitting in my stash. Refusing to sell or eat.
---
No worries - happy hunting :)
---
Have my perfect storm i used to tag at ws and grind levels with the big boys when i was under lvl 50..bought a lvl 50 perfect storm and hVe not shot it off once. But when i link up with a lower level 50 now..i let them use it to tag and then mow ghouka dowbmn with my 50 cal. Lol
---
I think it was done that way to be fair and make it so everyone has the same opportunity to get/use scrip. Not everyone plays the same way - my friend and i play the same amount of time but very differently - I'm picky about what I pick up because I don't want to bloat my stash with crap I'm not using - my friend on the other hand picks up every little legendary he sees and puts them on his mule. So despite playing the same amount he would have an advantage because he's a hoarder lol
---
You don't even need the pressure plate. You don't need to power the machine to sell things from it.. All powering does is put it on the map.
---
I was joking dipshit.
---
I used to be that way but since the update it loads smooth.
---
huh. weird
---
If I get any other recipes I already know they‚Äôre going up here.
---
I think it‚Äôs happened to pretty much everyone
---
Dang. My excavator armor only gets me to 345 with max strength special. I guess I could get cal. shocks but...meh. lol. I've just always been concerned about running around without it. I feel like stronger stuff will rip me apart. Level 91 deathclaws can take a third of my health even in PA. Lol
---
How do you know when its client side?
---
I'm selling things more out of convenience than profit.  If I have a bunch of plans taking up weight that need to move, I'm selling those for 20 caps a piece.
---
The only thing I'm a bit hard-nosed about are the serums.  People are selling them for about 200, but I could walk over to any vendor and get \~450 for one now.  And some may do exactly that - buy my serums and turn around and sell them to a vendor for 200 caps profit.
---
Nice work mate. Haven't done any of these yet, but will keep this bookmarked. Just in case... üòÅ
---
100% Agree!
---
I've been slowly coming around to it, but I'm finally at the point where I'm ***GLAD*** there are no NPCs in the game...they'd feel so flat and boring comparatively. I've posted about this before, but this game has forced me to use my mic and talk to people when I otherwise would never do that and to my shock, it has on the whole been overwhelmingly positive.
---
I think in part because this game was so negatively received and everyone felt so beleaguered, there's been a real sense that we're in this together. The weight restrictions have definitely helped motivate people to drop off gear/plans/ammo/aid they don't need (I'll be interested to see how this changes with player vending) and generally encourage "giving" behavior. I've been really pleasantly surprised. :)
---
Also, my ideal apocalyptic future is *definitely* one populated by funny robots. I've Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Protectron.
---
Most camps I see are **awful**.
---
Floating platforms with no means of a support loaded with turrets. We have this world, carefully crafted by the developer to have some versimilitude and here is this pile of ridiculous player rubbish thrown up next to some valuable resource.
---
I wish you could tell the game "OK, don't show me xXNinjaVaderXx's camp *ever again*".
---
I have decided the only thing I can do if I arrive at a player camp that looks like lazy toddler made it is I don't look at their store.
---
No. I am not struggling at all. It's surprisingly helpful class set up against harder enemies.
---
Ok, Mr. Cumbucket üëå
---
You have to make a camp diner and roleplay as Tiana now. It is law.
---
That's a very happy Brahmin.
---
Tgis has been requested a lot. Even when the game just came out. 
---
I hope they are working on it.
---
Only the milk part of the recipe spoils, you can hoard syrup (glowing sap + water), razorgrain flour (water + 4 razorgrain + concrete), spices and sugar that doesnt spoil, then just run and get a bunch of milk at once
---
ü§£ Already a medic sorry! (Glad somebody got the reference)
---
nice, i'm going for the dmg resist.
---
Yeah I expected as much. Pretty standard fare for this game lol
---
Ability to see history of items you sell through the vending machine.
---
The metric I use is CTD. If the client actually crashes to the desktop, I presume that's not a server-side issue.
---
Isnt one female in new vegas?
---
Sweet.
---
My Gatling is a level 40 so I won't get that much what perk cards are you using to get that much damage?
---
What is that?
---
Photo mode doesn‚Äôt work for this quest.  Was looking for help. 
---
When did gamers become so rude
---
I only have the one character so I'm not sure.
---
Hopefully this will fix the bug for those of us that cant get the clean up portion to show up or register as completed.
---
I agree. Got it myself without server hopping; third place I checked. However there have been three posts in the last hour alone asking how to get it and every day there are probably a dozen people complaining about how "impossible" it is and a dozen more breathlessly announcing they've found the tourist and to join them in game.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work with all windows for me. If I want it to pass through I have to use the wood siding, attach the wire and put it back to metal siding (I use the metal) not sure if it‚Äôs the same for the brick building
---
Way to out yourself.  :)
---
This. This needs to be done!
---
XB1
---
Are there only two guns that work with Guerilla? Auto-Pipe Pistols and the 10mm Auto Pistol?
---
Well that joke went over my head lol 
---
I also have Marsupial it's the best mutation. Speed demon does raise hunger and thirst but it's easily controlled. I also have Class Freak so that helps. 
---
I know the feeling of not having time (kids, job, etc.) which is why I only sometimes walk. I find it very enjoyable when I do walk there's so much I miss out on by fast traveling everywhere. 
---
My usually playthrough is sell stuff for caps 1 loop at WS then log out. Now I have to add Legendary scrapping to my day. I may have to kick the kids off the TV one night so I can do some walking again.
---
Do you have calobrated shocks? I have 400lbs in exca PA with not full strengh and birdbones.
---
I have high sneak so YMMV, but I got her at the farm south of watoga. I just camped out and she periodically spit out an egg. Run over to it and it'll hatch. As long as you kill the queen and a hatching in close proximity, you can take a pic of their bodies and it'll count. We killed the queen first, then triggered the eggs to hatch and kited them back to her body before killing them and got the pics.
---
Guess once I am done with the whole possum malarkey will have to test myself :)
---
Thanks anyway :)
---
Ahhhh so fresh milk of human kindness...
---
100 hours...there's a raider faction?
---
I got what you need for the prices you deserve!
---
Same thing happens to me and I am running
---
Win 10
---
AMD FX 8350 black edition @ 4ghz
---
GTX 970 SSC 2.0 4g edition
---
16gb DDR3
---
Game is on SSD / OS on a separate SSD.
---
I read an article about needing to assign an Nvidia profile for F76 and this seemed to very slightly help. But it still occurs pretty badly so I am must confident it is coming from the CPU.
---
Were you ever able to find a solution?
---
Manager's Terminal is a 2.
---
Hey bes, if you are therr, I'd pay for a mod that does this lol
---
It doesn't matter if it's an *effective* advantage in every scenario. The point is they promised the shop would be *cosmetic only* and this is not *cosmetic only*.
---
Make whatever claims you want about it making you enjoy the game more, it doesn't change the fact that they broke a promise, and an important one.
---
Foot in the door is a powerful strategy against people like you. They push the limit to see what people like yourself will be okay with. The only way to not end up in true P2W territory is to never even get the door open. That's over now. Mark my words, more advantageous things are coming in the shop. Fridge to keep food longer? Shop item. Better power armor lamp? Shop item. More visible/clear weapon sights? Shop item. Then one day we have ammo and boosters in the shop too. 
---
They've got their foot in the door, so now they're going to push it until it stops being profitable. That's how this works every single time a developer makes this promise.
---
That's not how economy works lol
---
Niceeeeeeree thanks!
---
Ive got no fix, but i feel your pain. Mine was all green but something was apparently floating... 1 hour later i just rebuilt it.
---
Hope you find a work around.
---
What i didnt try to do is place a foundation and snap the blueprint to it. So you can give that a go
---
Jokes on you, I knew what I was doing all along buddy!
---
I had someone giving me the Down and Mad emote when I didn't have my 1 of my vending machines powered up.
---
Winner
---
now heres a thing, that started for me right from loggin. I thought it was part of lowes
---
quest because it was there the night before the update ?????? assume your talking about scouts. arrived and things went pear shapped real fast. is that mirlurk "at least one player,get to the island" part of the scouts quest or something else ?
---
completed the clean up contamination, don't know how, to busy with the 2 bears and horde of mutants from grafton steel.
---
I really dont know anymore
---
Maybe they think of it as a make believe video game house that really just serves a utilitarian purpose.  Your character fixes his gear there, sleeps, and cooks.   I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time there milling around; i‚Äôd rather be out killing shit, helping others, and exploring.   That‚Äôs my perspective.  It‚Äôs more strange to me the lengths people go to decorate their camps, and spend countless hours sitting around said camp.  To each their own.  Floating, wood, unadorned rectangle, camp owner regards.
---
Issues I've seen reported in last 24 hours here are vending machines that give out stuff but you get no caps because near limit, move camp and lose everything in the vending machine, machines that sink into the floor and cannot be retrieved, new building issues like half walls that cannot be stacked or have roofs on them and stairs that cannot have anything under them, floor parts that bind together and cannot be deleted, players spawning inside walls, floors, extractors etc when visiting other camps, camps that cannot be placed for no apparent reason because they are floating now, power armor vanishing, new quests that seem to not complete ... the list goes on (as do I apparently!)
---
bloody, adrenal reaction. then adrenaline perks, all 9 heavy gunner, bloody mess x3, etc. mine is lvl 50. i found it at a player vendor. i had a vamps gatling, but the bloody did almost 2x. that 620 is at full adrenaline 60% buff tho.
---
again, get emergency protocols for your power armor. below 20% health, it Halves incoming damage before other resistances touches you. i can go toe to toe with a legendayr mirelurk queen and only use a stimpak once or twice
---
Plz add blood for the blood god
---
you dont have to wait out the recall timer unless the PA is a higher level than you can equip.
---
Either re-enter the armor, or take a step back, point at it, and hit the collect button.
---
It still works if its not powered. Powering puts it on the map.
---
But kudos for inovation
---
I saw several camps last night that used the small letters on the front of each machine to indicate what was in it: weapons, armor, chems, etc.
---
I did post about how to complete first rank of pioneer yesterday. It is somewhere in hot. I would link it, but im on mobile :(
---
So mark them up to 500.  It's still a good deal for everyone.
---
No... Give me my money in atoms and we will call it even. I paid for the Tricentennial edition. 80 dollars in atoms will tear the band aid off quick and easy. Its not a lot but its something that I should get for all the b.s. that i went through when this game launched. And all the time waiting for it to get playable/enjoyable.
---
Bring them into line with other melee weapon damage, but make their damage based on Charisma, not Strength.
---
Also would be cool if there was a perk card that would let you Well Tune others with an Instrument weapon.
---
Bards.  I want a viable bard build.  That's what I want.
---
I absolutely support this. 
---
In addition, I run Holotape game tournaments in my camp every thursday night on PC at 6pm pacific time. Buy in is 110 caps and the player with the highest score after a half hour wins the whole pot.
---
I keep an updated scoreboard as well so we know who the best gamers in Appalachia are.
---
You guys are all welcome to come hang tonight and compete. Passes the time while we wait for proper cabinets.
---
Be careful to stay in the deep water - if you come out of the water / walk it will fail.
---
Also it isn't all day, it's a couple of hours at worst and if the game isn't solid and working for people then they will leave and not bother. Won't have a game to play then.
---
Sorry, only consistent players get to make requests.
---
But in all seriousness, they've already mentioned it.  It'll come.
---
Hopefully they fix the inspect function on the vending machines.
---
lol :D
---
Yikes. That would be quite the bug.
---
For serums never more than 300, crazy how some people have 1k + prices
---
&gt;Your thinking is why the market is broken ...
---
That's not how economics works. Items only have value defined by what people are willing to pay for them.
---
well, lol again, hahaha :)
---
haha I didnt realize your GT is actually tighteywhiteyman
---
Yep. A 9 level perk for just two weapons. It says ‚Äúauto pistols‚Äù in the description, but I figured it was just an oversight. Kinda like how so many perks that apply to unarmed only say melee in the description.
---
What incentives were there before? You ALREADY had the best pvp armor. You STILL have the best pvp armor. I don't understand your logic. You said "The field is even now, but there are no incentives." 
---
Maybe Im wrong, but that statement implies that having and working for an advantage is the incentive to keep playing?
---
10/10 for ghouls! ghouls! ghouls! sign.
---
Gotcha you are pc so it‚Äôs a bit different . I‚Äôm on Xbox and I get 3 types of crashes:
---
1.loading screen never loads , loading screen vault door stops spinning and it will stay on this screen until i restart my console or I go to the dashboard and exit the game 
---
2.game feels like it‚Äôs stuck in a gear, makes an annoying sound , then restarts the game after a minute
---
3. I get a message saying server not responding and it backs me out to fo76 home screen 
---
Would be nice to know which one is Comcast‚Äôs fault and which ones are Beth‚Äôs servers
---
It‚Äôs your cloud data, it‚Äôs not syncing properly or you‚Äôre preventing the sync when you start playing.
---
You know that there is somewhere for some reason that one guy with accounting passion keeping a notebook of the transactions he's making. Both in or out. I've seen people do that in plenty of games i wouldn't be surprised if it happens here.
---
With that said a sale history accessible via the personal terminal would be cool.
---
lowest prices wins...
---
thanks, more grinding then i guess :)
---
You can thank Chisato#7699 on discord.
---
Same here!! Free fast travel to my camp so peeps can buy stuff!
---
Agreed.  Vendor I was talking to was super cool, offered to refund my caps, etc. but wasn't his fault.  Just wish Beth had a way of crediting the lost items or caps in this event.  Game has to have logs showing the transaction.  Or worst case credit some ATOMs if warranted.  Bug bounty program!  ;)
---
Omg I‚Äôve been waiting till it‚Äôs almost broke, didn‚Äôt think it would count if it was damaged a little.
---
Id settle for normal chalanges. Taking a picture of another player while he is intoxicated and wearing a clown costume in the wendungo cave seems.... oddly way too specific...
---
Its not really a chalange, its just a pain in the ass for 2 people so that one can get 20 atoms.
---
Please please please automoderate these posts.  Repetition is boring.  Or, to put it another way, I'm bored by repetitive posts.  When I see a post that's just like the one before it I get bored.  Did I mention that seeing lots of duplicate posts is a bore?  Anyway, I was reading a post that was just the same as a previous post and I thought "this is boring".  Well, there I was 1232l13e 2d323r   [ NO CARRIER ]
---
You on XBox? Like to visit your machines...
---
You have to find the dead tourist random encounter. Server hop at col. Kelly monument and check the bench at the top of the stairs.
---
It would be awesome if they let you put a machine at vault 76 or whitesprings. It's spendy fast travelling all around to shop.
---
You can also have a friend lock his Personal Computer and complete it that way.
---
"At least one player get to the island" is the Swarm of Suitors challenge.
---
That said, I read one of the scout challenges is a picture of a merluck queen with spawn, which also happens during swarm of suitors...so that event should satisfy one of the badge requirements.
---
i just got it
---
I've got a bunch of crap for lowbies in my vendor for 0 caps. Like low-level food recipes or the bajillion tinker/chemistry station plans.
---
Did you get the possum bag or the tadpole bag?  
---
Was it obvious how to get the mods?    
---
I have the tadpole bag, but logged right after getting it.
---
Just got mine now before servers shut down. Going for increased capacity which cost the most....
---
Is that known?  I thought it was accumulation until you hit a certain mark and then you got one.  My reasoning was based firstly on being told it worked that way and personally having removed large amounts of radiation multiple times and then get one with almost no rads showing from eating food or swimming.  I can see it could be that I hit the odds just right at that particular time and maintaining larger levels would kick the odds up higher obviously.  If this is true, then I stand corrected
---
This, plus please, SHUT THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT.  Thanks!
---
I believe it was for server stability. I would say no more than a few hours but you never know.
---
Free fast travel for your customers, not you as the camp owner.
---
It's a hotfix, patch notes are not released as gameplay isnt affected. It's mainly to fix stability issues caused by the last patch. They generally do this after each patch.
---
I've always said Hacking and Lockpicking should be a passive skill where your overall level determines what level lock you can attempt. Perks cars should then serve to make the hacking/lockpicking easier
---
The game can't be designed around your one personal build. I hope they do nerf it just so you have to bounce lol
---
Yup. Kingdropbear97. I'm not on often, but I think I'll get some play time in this weekend
---
I will be using some of my 30 something saved perk card points and 7 card packs. Bloodied is such a fun build I have been a melee build for 145ish levels I like the new challenge of bloodied.
---
My Gatling also has a 25% faster fire rate along with quicker reload it should tear shit up with a speedy reciever.
---
I‚Äôll give that a try later, thank you!
---
Hoping it's not too long, I got possum badges to earn!
---
I fucking love you
---
I‚Äôll give that a try later, thank you!!
---
Thank you so much! I understand how PvP is annoying, I agree, but I want it to be better by doing this
---
When I logged in Tuesday I got the poster from the shop, loaded I to a world and it automatically started without having to do anything.
---
I do my shop stuff on a mule on an account I don't use otherwise, so friend requests are kinda irritating because I get invited to a lot of games on that Xbox now. But it's a small price to pay to make a few hundred thousand caps with little effort within a few days lol
---
They can be still tamed. I run into someone that had a tamed one still from before the patch. And mentioned to him the patch notes because he didn't know about the changes. He then went and tried and he was still able to tame a mega sloth. So it should still be there.
---
probably because of the free cat and deathclaw hedge plans
---
I just bought and crafted one for the challenge, went and activated it in adventure mode and I had to power 2 pylons myself for the whole event, ended up using 40-ish stimpaks on myself and others. Then with 20 seconds left of the event the encryptid ggroes and downs me, the others manage to kill it just in time and then just let me bleed to death next to them, then took my loot when I died.  
---
I'm sure this has been said before but even withotu disconnects the event is just not worth doing for the caps and stimpaks you put into it.
---
There is an access control terminal that has a 1 on both sides. 
---
A robotics control terminal that is a 2.
---
An accelerator control terminal that is a 0.
---
The master control terminal toward the top is a 3.
---
Np budüëç
---
I'm a bloodied build with unyielding armor.  My strength is usually around 36-37 so my carry weight is usually around 375.  It varies with health.  That being said, my excavator carry weight is about 460.
---
I don't think so, I found it was already in my crafting bench menu. As well as available on the atomic shop menu.
---
Again the hamsters need cleaning out and feeding, they are installing some more wheels so the severs should be more fasterer and a bit more betterer after the shutdown.
---
Ever read up on Eve Online?  It‚Äôs amazing actually. Game economies are about as close to a free market as you get. Granted, that player base is huge but supply/demand is still supply/demand
---
No one said it was a brotherhood player
---
Dammit! Today's my first day off since the patch
---
a thousand time this, imagine selling a very cool weapon to a guy and than in the future doing stuff with that guy and he is using that weapon,  that would be quite the tale
---
This feels right. In the noclip doc and other places they mentioned they were working on a deathmatch mode of some type.
---
If you server hop at the Teapot you should get one after a few attempts, corpse is lying over one of the picnic tables.
---
Guess it's messing with their hedge fund üòÇ
---
Thank you! This makes me so happy.
---
Much appreciated.
---
My thoughts exactly, and the ones who complain need to understand that they can win if they find what works for themüëå
---
And if you add a motion assist torso, add +2 strength for 10 more lbs
---
Isn‚Äôt a hotfix normally done live?
---
Good guide
---
Don't go past the far right buoy.   It fails the mission.  Touch it and retrace your steps.
---
Ya, my "discover" challenges are bugged too. It is discouraging when I am trying to farm atoms, only to find out it will never check the box.
---
I mean it looks pretty damn well hidden to me.
---
I sell mine for 499.  They fly off the shelf, so to speak.
---
Awesome video dude.
---
That's udderly ridiculous!
---
You can‚Äôt fast travel out of it?
---
Melee, rifle, Camp, group.... Sheeeeet I could do more you know. Sneak, power armour.....
---
Maybe more presets as you level up, like one every 25 levels??
---
I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but where did you buy the mod? I checked at the badge vendor machines, but only saw stuff like shorts, shirts, flags and sleeping bags.
---
It is kinda crazy what people think their things are worth, guy wanted to sell me a 2 star grognak with bloodied and lightweight for 12k.
---
It's a vending machine, mate.  I don't stand at a machine and ask it to dispense my soda at 90 cents and wait for it to tell me "fine, $1.25 but that's as low as I'll go."
---
Set reasonable "see and buy" prices or bugger off to a market sub or discord.
---
Yes, welcome to online games. It is a constant nerf cycle.
---
Deleted the game
---
Mine too. Damn I gotta go outside.
---
Right! Got a bit of free time and wanted to spend it doing Pioneer Scout challenges
---
Don't you have to pacify in order to tame?
---
Idk but it needs to be fixed.
---
Yes but they don't.
---
keep it. if its bloody and got that faster fire rate, it will do more damage than a higher level that doesnt have the fire rate.
---
I'm guessing a fix for some bugs - likely the cat/deathclaw topiary items which were available to build but not meant to be there yet and the bug that allowed you to get the survival challenge weapon in adventure mode. 
---
Just a guess.
---
This exactly. I found a 3* max level Cavalier leather armor piece for 200 caps, so it definitely goes both ways. I actually feel bad about it now, but I forgot their gamertag.
---
And on my server, someone just dropped a nuke at fissure prime. Man I bet they're going to be pissed. When the notification came up, I just left...didn't want to waste ammo and stimpaks. But I feel a little bad for the guy and wanted to help bring her down, but I knew we didn't have enough time. Plus there were only 4 players trying to take the Queen down.
---
Good to know! I might check after work to see if I can craft High Capacity backpacks and sell them at my vendor. I grinded for so long last night that, as soon as I crafted mine, I logged off.
---
Those negatives are overblown. Most armors don't even come with rad resist in the first place so most players rad resist is already negligible and unless you're fighting a whole lot of robots all the time you're almost always dealing with ballistic damage.
---
True, I agree. The idea is to make it so things can counter Bloodied, not to make Bloodied less powerful.
---
I did this last night lol
---
Your fusion cores are quite expensive, people traded them for 50-60 caps each before vending machines.
---
Lmao! My buddy and I spent 45 mins dying and trying to revive each other in the water.
---
is it random which one you get?
---
Poor fellas
---
It was before the nerds got outta hand.
---
100-200 per serum is standard on consoles. PC prices are often higher 300-500.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who that happened to!
---
Thank you! I‚Äôll add you when I get home tonight.
---
I agree with camp decor somewhat however I'm selling my fasnacht duplicates more a much much higher mark up
---
The loading screens are just any pictures you‚Äôve taken. I have four characters and I get all four of those ‚Äúmy first picture‚Äù images in my loading screens for any character I‚Äôm playing. 
---
So it‚Äôs likely what the other person said, you just didn‚Äôt exit the vault with your new character.
---
https://youtu.be/Nvi1qSoQHPs
---
So the camera is on a dead tourist.   I server hopped the Wavy Willards or whatever.  
---
He was in the parking lot out front, leaning against a red car.  
---
You get the camera and a questline, but you have to go craft a new camera at a tinker bench.
---
No. Don‚Äôt try and price fix. Let people decide for themselves.
---
No problem. It scared the shit out of me and I almost shot it when I spawned at this guys camp to buy stuff. And I asked him how he got it and he told me with the animal friends perk and then I let him know about the fixes. 
---
I thought it was rather cool to be honest.
---
Yeah the only way to avoid it right now is to watch close as you spawn in and if you feel like a house is loading around you, run. It's worked for me so far.
---
I have a small one story shack and thats the way i like it
---
Thanks for help
---
Me too. I'm so excited about the new stuff they added. I logged on, finally got my camp moved to a better location for vending, and then I got the message saying they were going offline. Hopefully maintenance wont take too long.
---
cool thing about backpacks: they weight very little on their own, so you can just carry more than one and swap them out depending on which mod you need at the moment!
---
Probably nerf the shotguns a little more, the bloodied are still very powerful and that has to be ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô.
---
I read about a scientist that accidentally exposed himself to a bunch of radiation and he died in like 24 hours or something and his bone marrow like turned to liquid :/ it's not to be hekked with. 
---
//also cannot wait to watch this show - plan to watch it this weekend
---
Geeze alright no need to get all defensive. I was simply offering other options. I got 6 cows when I was there without switching servers. Some people don't have the brahmin pen and was just giving help.
---
You get 400 from vendors now, so I sell for 400. They fly off the shelves.
---
In the interests of healthy debate; the game's ToS also says the following. Interpret it how you will.
---
*"Users are forbidden from using any unapproved third party applications, programs, scripts or any other game modifying mechanic used to change the game play experience on a ZeniMax Game, Service, forum, or other games or services provided by ZeniMax, including the distribution of said programs via ZeniMax services, sites, forums, communities, etc. This would include but is not limited to using or distributing speed hacks, aim bots, mouse controllers, spam bots, automated game play devices, etc. Third party applications are defined as any program, application or script written by an individual, company, corporation, or private party not employed by or contracted to perform services by ZeniMax."*
---
You‚Äôre griping about the griper griping.
---
Throwing up on vending machines means your prices are too high.
---
Hopefully they are fixing  the new dupe glitch
---
If it's to fix server stability issues, then Phew! I've had more disconnects over the last couple of days than I did over the past month. Been a bit laggier than usual too. This patch has been amazing though, so not too miffed about it.
---
I am laughing my ass off right now.
---
Armor
---
fairly sure I read that, did the initial talk to robot,then all hell broke loose.
---
however, that loc. was definatly on my map, the NIGHT BEFORE the update, I had planned to go there ????
---
course, I could have lost the plot altoghether.
---
cheers
---
You get a win and an upvote for the chuckle.
---
Right? Seems like a great place to buy things way too cheap.
---
YeH that irritates me. Please close doors.
---
PS4.
---
The limit is part of the problem that is curbing inflation. With no limit ,items would just keep on going up in price as more and more caps enter the market but with the limit it pretty much caps the inflation at 25k per god tier item for the most part.with more and more caps in market , you may feel richer because you have more caps but in reality the cap is just losing value. Without the cap items would just keep rising in price . The idea of the tax is to take caps out of the market which in return will make caps gain value and should bring the price of items down .

Source : a years worth of macro in hs where my teacher was a pothead and had us watch spongebob most days
---
Provided that you are aware of your options. People will absolutely buy them for thousands because you never know what people have and it's still technically a grind to find what you're looking for.
---
I‚Äôve seen people asking about 2k... crazy. I thought I was a dick for sticking firm to the 500, if I can vendor them for that much that‚Äôs how much I‚Äôm gonna sell them for.
---
Got mine yesterday too. It's great to have the extra carry weight, alongside the plans for deep pocketed combat armour I finally got as well. 
---
My only issue is I made too much use out of it. My stash is full too so I'm back to square 1! I'm just hoping players visit my vending machine now, I really need shot of lots of stuff.
---
Fantastic work!
---
Downloaded it yesterday, trying it now.
---
Seems more playable
---
You could take a look here: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/2
---
Can't vouch for any of it, I don't use ultrawide.
---
No with pacify you look down a sight and if you can pacify it then that option shows up. To Tame you have to walk right up close and the Tame option pops up if available. Then it gives the option to "send to your camp" and off he runs.
---
Why on earth are you vendoring on survival mode?
---
As for turrets, set them to go off when a laser tripwire is activated and surround your camp with lasers except for one walkway that players can use.
---
I have had this issue with hats that I should be able to find every 24 hours - server hop 10+ times - nothing - same with a few of the plan spawns. Not sure if bug or just being heavily farmed - but I never had trouble with like the hat spawns before :/
---
Already made a rant post about that too :) completing hunter is a chalange, this is just a pain in the ass especially for solo players

It was the -shrugs- I know what the -shrugs- means. Don‚Äôt play coy üòí

New dupe glitch?
---
Max out str and go for a rolling pin
---
Your telling me,  took me took two days just to find someone that would get themselves maimed just so I can revive them. I‚Äôm just gonna get the pack and forget the rest.
---
I have never used a Tesla rifle. What makes it good versus bugs?
---
The queen must be near death to spawn the hatchlings if there are no nests nearby.
---
I'll srop by on Tuesday. Tako Tuesday
---
That surprised me too, hadn't seen that mentioned.
---
I've got a BE 3\* pump action and I think I paid 8k for it a month or so ago.  Now I consider myself super lucky as it seems to be a highly desirable weapon.  I'm a bloodied melee so I just hang onto it for enemies out of reach.
---
Butcher's Bounty, Green Thumb, Super Duper would make gathering ingredients and crafting recipes easier. Good with Salt to make them keep longer. Maybe a melee build using a walking cane?
---
I've built probably 100 bases, and I've seen hundreds more.. none ever tanked my game. Not one. Perhaps your computer would be performing better if you set your graphics to "potato".üòÇ
---
Like when ? I play it most days and I may get a disconnect here and there but that‚Äôs true with all online games and half the time it‚Äôs probably on my end
---
Oh my, thank you for this comment, I was wondering why no one ever visits my shop lol!
---
Personally I don't mind. I feel like anyone that felt super strongly on it would just lock their purifiers. That's just my opinion though.
---
Random again? Lol
---
On Sunday I joined a queen battle and found out everyone there, from level 60 to 240, were ‚Äòmelee build‚Äô except one guy a ‚Äòsneaky sniper build‚Äô using a lever action. They put in little damage to the queen because she didn‚Äôt land much, and they get slaughtered by scorched mirelurks and deathclaws left and right. It was a real comedy. It‚Äôs just sad to see what the game has come to after all the nerfs, everyone is taking the cheap and OP route.
---
fucking hyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyype
---
We need the details lol
---
no but it turns PVP into a pretty fucking annoying 1 sided "battle". 
---
I've stopped playing Survivor because so many people have the crazy weapons that put me down in 1-2 shots. Getting a good even battle is pretty fun. Getting shot down before I really have time to react is fucking annoying.
---
How long has such server maintenance instances historically taken? Do you know?
---
Asked a bazillion times already.
---
The casual player base is what keeps the game afloat, not the people on this reddit. And TSE would have not been a problem if it was not duped to the point everyone and their mother had one. Duping was the problem. I do agree that they got excessive with the TSE nerf, but it had to be reduced. It was way OP at even low levels. The problem is there should not be one build that is way more OP then all others. All build should be viable not just one or 2. And the fact sentinel and cavalier made a player pretty much invincible unless they were staggered is not fair. It just isn't. Not everyone can spend the time grinding and buying equipment with the max caps of 3 or 4 toons. It is not good for the economy.
---
omg i love you. Looking through all the badge challenges and like 90% of the stuff I really didn't want to do(mostly taking pictures), this on the other hand i would much rather grind. I was on the verge of saying screw getting a backpack tbh.
---
Not sure how I feel about the way she works. I wouldn't have enjoyed too much if she was just a random reroll machine, and even less so if her stock was just randomized legendaries that changed every day, but I don't think I like this too much either...
---
I taught everyone who visits my camp to always close the doors. Now they do it subconsciously ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôll find a lower level and message them, asking if they need anything.  If they respond and seem like an eager player I‚Äôll gift them a special weapon or weapons I‚Äôve outgrown, with the caveat that they do the same in the future.  Who knows if they actually do it but I like to think so.
---
out of curiousity are you on xb1? because there was a nice little bar/shop near the overseers camp last night with tons of people in it.
---
Imposter sheepsquatch. The quest line for the story starts in train stations on the billboards. But you'll see the event come up, it's down in the ash heap.
---
This is a possibility then, I did wait for the guy to be at his base so I could inspect it. He might have been messing with his stash at the same time.
---
Wait, so they actually do burn up from low to high? All this time I've been afraid they might not and I'd burn through my highest before lowest. 
---
It's definitely a waste of space, but I'm a hoarder on this game. I picked up so many low charge ones during my early days on this game, and I cant bring myself to drop them. I wouldn't mind finding a gatling laser to smash all of these out at once though.
---
It‚Äôs only been a couple of minutes and I‚Äôm fed up with waiting already ü§£
---
My hero
---
exactly, anything that builds on the social aspect of the game is very welcome on my book, especially since i just noticed that the atom shop description for the terminal also tells that it will be used for social stuff
---
Battle Royale is cancer
---
Yeah I started fixing them and putting them in my vendor machine for cheap. It's a help to those who dropped theirs or lost it or have a bugged mission.
---
Sometimes it has taken just an hour other times almost 4 hours. It really just depends.
---
Striders were much cooler!
---
there is another machine on the other side of the Tadpole machine. you need Possum merit badges for the other.
---
Excellent random roll to prevent endless server hop.  Also, oh no, random roll!
---
I think some people feel happiest when they have something to complain about.
---
Any updates?
---
I'm just impressed people got the reference. üòç
---
It be nice if they let more options on other weapons. Some weapons like the assault rifle has like 50 mods where other ranged weapons have like 3. I was going to main SMG tell I found out it had no suppressor. Tried pistols, they feel too weak vs all other weapons.
---
I have no difference in loading, its still 5-7 sec.
---
I sell most of my plans for 1 cap each. I need the inventory space but don't want to just throw them out.
---
Ok, but functional shower? I need details
---
I missed out on quite a few survival weapons. It's nice to finally get one without having to go to the Dark side.
---
It sounds like you're looking at the tadpole scout machine. Go to the other side of the sign and you'll see the possum scout machine, which has the backpack mods.
---
I just found this article and it makes good sense since FO4 is almost identical to F76. 
---
I am going to try it tonight and if it works, I'll let you know. 
---

It was, I had both of them (queen and spawns) on camera, it didn't complete.
---
It always leads to price fixing
---
Was about to suggest this exact combo. All the fancy Scprchedbeast recipes are pretty easy with Butcher's Bounty.

Enforcer has a chance to proc per pellet, believe 8 pellets per shot

No my dude. One hand holds the mac-10 and the other hand holds your pants!

I feel like I need to move my bar to get more traffic through it but I am in the mire. Maybe it is time to build near a real road. I don,t know.

Yeah I definitely didn't have that sub.

Alright thank you both for your replies, I'll check it out when we can log back in.

[u/JBarracudaL](https://old.reddit.com/user/JBarracudaL/)
---
Awesome, I will check it out.   Thanks.
---
All junk except screws 1c, screws 2c. My junk mule made caps at a faster rate than my other three characters. I sell flux I don't use (cobalt) for 100c, only keeping enough to craft. I don't sell bulk junk because it's wasting plastic selling to players. I sell fusion cores for a cap per percentage left (24/100 core for 24c)
---
Bethesda literally answered everyone's complaints at "end game" and "having nothing to do".... i welcome the weeks+ (months?) of time these will take to get!
---
Happened to me whilst grinding the pioneer scout challenges. Was a nice surprise when it popped up on screen lol.
---
Wasteland Grandma can bench more than you can in power armour. What is her secret?!
---
Finger Guns emote / Heart emote
---
Get ready bro, going to be fun time soon!
---
I'm surprised people still dupe considering Bethesda's actions towards those that are caught. Oh well, I've heard there is a new method but I see a lot less dupers than launch so I am glad about that
---
best place to get it is at blackwater mine(outside is a small radiation puddle/pool) i would say. mole miners can kill you in the water or you can jump off the cliff into the water without auto respawning. just did it before the servers went down with some random.
---
just a tip for anyone reading this
---
So downvote for making pointless attention seeking posts? Ok
---
You have to become a possum scout to unlock the plan for the base backpack. Then you will find the option at the armor workbench under a new "backpack" category.
---
Sounds amazing. I don't often swap to survival, but this is exactly what I want in survival ... dumping ammo like candy, bodies everywhere.
---
Only downside of survival is they've not quite figured out a meaningful penalty. Caps and aids are cheap (because, like, you can just run without them). I like the "point" loss, but think maybe we need a timed penalty box of a "you died recently" debuff.
---
u/JBarracudaL
---
I would argue wasteland mutation.
---
yes. either we're addicted or its gotten better.
---
I also have the Civil War era dress which I thought was a nice touch. Melee build with a walking cane/rolling pin is definitely happening.
---
You are correct, this is a stupid quesiton.  =)
---
You will not lose your legendary perks, just the ability to shoot ultracite ammo.
---
Darn
---
You have to finish the tadpole questions first.
---
you get from the Tadpole vending machine at the Pioneer camp. it is not like the other- this one is on a short pole/stand and it hangs downward. cone shaped. nice and clean
---
I love the smg but i seriously have to play with the TC turned down because the constant bang is annoying
---
I got mine by accident too. I'm guessing most of us did, since the tasks we had to do were pretty much stuff we'd be doing anyway just playing the game.
---
This vending sure mixes stuff up. before this update, any god roll weapon was too valuable for caps, 25,000 was not enough, many were "trade only" priced.
---
Holy shit I had no idea there was such a card.  Going to look into Charisma now.  Mine is currently at 1 which makes me an introverted elephant-man look-alike.
---
I seen a post on here where someone said they bought atoms cause of how good the update was. And you know what, after a couple of days of thinking about it, i said that‚Äôs a good idea. So I bought some atoms today to show my appreciation.
---
At the pioneers camp the vendors are selling it for batches
---
Ok so it‚Äôs a random roll on a new weapon; could be worse. Hopefully the prices aren‚Äôt crazy
---
I found a camp spot this weekend I had never seen. It was a small rock cliff shelf with a pool of water, about halfway down the huge cliff near the train elevator.
---
Camp was spread out in a set of buildings and a main house, like a settler's farmstead. Water purifier on the corner of the pond, Bramin in the paddock by the water. And a fence along the open dropoff to keep it all safe. Really homey and a great view of the cranberry bogs.  
---
Getting the spawn point usable had to be a nightmare though.
---
Roll with it. This update is fan-fucking-tastic. Nowhere near the game it was at launch.
---
Nope. It will remove the added scorched benefits from the prime reciever, but won't affect anything on gun's legendary perks.
---
From memory its name did show up red. I guess the only way to see if he takes damage is to get someone to shoot it.
---
explosive 3 star legendary shotgun for only 1999 caps
---
then some plans for a wetsuit armor for 50 caps
---
I dont know why i didnt play it, i preordered it, maybe because of the wreck beta
---
Pfft ahahaha
---
:-)) ranged weapon legendary :)) no drill, no lead pipe... if i get syringer from that i uninstal btw
---
I really enjoy getting visits from people wanting to trade and buy stuff, I really enjoy this new update
---
This.
---
I won't use any Nexus mods until Bethesda explicitly states they're ok, or at least that one is.  I haven't put hundreds of hours into the game to get banned because I wanted a faster way to swap Perks.
---
You must become opossum to learn the plan
---
Now THIS is a good idea...there is enough room for two pressure plates. One gets you goodies, the other gets a spike board toss into space. Time to re-design the pad.
---
Good meal prep.
---
I‚Äôm selling anything good for WAY less than the BS prices around the main Reddit markets. Fuck those prices. I want what I want, but if I come across a weapon that somebody else habits, and I don‚Äôt want to weapon, a good amount of carbs to make it worth my time is all that‚Äôs needed. Somebody wants to then go and sell it for 20 times more that‚Äôs on them not me.
---
The servers are run by hamsters...
---
And every time the game crashes it‚Äôs one of the hamsters dying...
---
It‚Äôs really sad
---
Yeah i read that at the top of this thread too
---
Well I pushed back a bit on them just reporting back to me with a sorry but the item is gone.  I'm not looking for a hand out, I'm looking for the item I lost or some form of compensation.  its not real money, and yea, its not hard to make caps in game, but it also sucks to be legitimately stoked to find a nice item, pay the price, and get nada in return.  There should be a better answer than sorry.
---
Me neither. I‚Äôm hoping I get to display it at some point.
---
There are two vending machines for different badges. The one you were looking at for tadpole badges and another for opossum badges.
---
welcome back....well or not
---
I just put a switch on the side of mine. Only downside is sometimes a joker turns it off when they leave.
---
AWESOME!  Thanks a bunch.
---
No you don't, I just bought it and I'm still a 2/3 tadpole lol.
---
Oh good point I actually just saw that; 100 for a 3 Star is very reasonable!
---
Love this idea!  I do something like it with a Responder character, crafting foods that give good bonuses.  Butcher's Bounty, Green Thumb, and Super Duper are absolute necessities. Thru Hiker in Agility is another perk to look out for, reduces food weight so you can load up with more goodies.  Good luck! üòÅüëç
---
There are two ranks of scouts, the first is the tadpole, the tadpole vendor only has a few cheap items for tadpole tokens. There is a separate machine for possum tokens that has other stuff, though you have to complete the first scout quest to unlock the challenges
---
U asked for photo mode.  I told u how to do photomode
---
You can't have really expected there to not be a trade off?
---
I got good unyielding and bolstering armor pieces for cheap. I just modded them and sold for double. Bought some great anti armor and bloodied weapons too for like 200 caps a pop
---
Meat hook benifits from 1 handed perks and unarmed perks
---
I hope by "a majority of the community" you mean the members of this reddit and not the whole player base. This reddit is very likely under 10% of the whole Fallout 76 player base. Probably closer to 5% max. 
---
I would also like to thank you for not wording that as "this whole community" like a lot of people like to do. (no sarcasm there)
---
It zaps from target to target, or from floor to target. So great for area killing low mobs.
---
There we go. The answer to all my confusion
---
That's reassuring, what about the state of bugs? 
---
Has it changed or does it feel still like the launch? (no offense)
---
Replying to your update : caps going from 1 player to another play doesn‚Äôt work as a cap sink because those caps are still in the market. The caps have to disappear in order for the cap to gain value and drive prices down . I do appreciate your concern for my wallet tho
---
Lol rly? Pichure proof plz
---
It did show up with a name in one of the corners of my screen when I looked at it. Of the person who tamed it.
---
What about robot armor, does anyone know? I need to craft it for my challenge :(
---
It's a hotfix not a full patch.
---
It's 100 scrip for 3* item
---
There‚Äôs definitely been a stability issue, at least that I‚Äôve noticed, since the patch. A lot of great introductions with the patch, but I have been disconnected almost every single game I‚Äôve played since.
---
That's what I said I did in the last sentence...
---
A chameleon serum recipe for 1000
---
Bloodied combat knife.
---
I react this comment as someone else responded that the plan from the machine is a skin and not a pack
---
Yes. Looks awesome
---
I never even considered this. The grandkids have to stay warm out there!
---
You suck and I love you.
---
They should equalize the prices on a 3 star melee and 3 star ranged,
---
I've noticed that 99% of players will open every door in my house and not close a single one.  They even open the prison door that blocks my tiny, unfurnished fusion generator room from vermin attacks, even though they can see through the door that there's nothing of interest within...
---
Some kind of Mire folk Yoga maybe?
---
I would if the game wasn't under maintainence
---
I tried exiting build mode a few times, but didn‚Äôt think to server hop! I‚Äôll give it another go post maintenance. Thank you! üòä
---
Sucks it happened. At least it wasnt 10k+ lkl
---
you can, but after the second time I tried to fast travel back to the same vendor base and boom!....no change.  At that point I fast traveled out of there.
---
I have found an XO-1 jet pack mod for 240 caps, and I found lvl 50 explosive quad ammo combat rifle for 999 caps. I love this player vending!
---
This is only for mods tho. You must do that backpack thing first. But with help of guys here, it will take you around 2hours max.
---
Gunsmith definitely. Who wouldn't want more durability on their guns when repairing them? Basically any card that does this for armour and other weapon types on repairing them is gold.
---
No Atomic shop items needed and all DLC is free
---
There‚Äôs a photo in the article.
---
This is exactly like old school diablo gambling.  It‚Äôs the smartest way the could have implemented this without breaking the trading markets or having everyone hand pick their gear within two weeks time.
---
Great job Big B.
---
Im lvl 76. I haven't leveled up since I hit 50. Kinda nervous to permanently change from my stealth sniper build. Plus curious about what's going to happen with the legendary character rebuild were supposed to get in a few months.
---
How many points do you have allocated to luck? I‚Äôm thinking about bumping mine up.
---
Sums up this subs feelings for the game.
---
Yet another feature to completely and totally ignore, hurrah.
---
If you haven‚Äôt gotten the backpack yet just do swimmer archer and athlete challenges. They‚Äôre the easiest and should only take an hour or two at most
---
So... she's treasonous. What will the other Mole Miners do when they find out?
---
In what way?
---
They were a bunch of well meaning pacifists, the wasteland chewed them up them the vault had a meltdown. Not a happy ending but no too suprising either.
---
player vending machine.
---
I have no idea if the plan is rare or easy to get :(
---
Finally, an opportunity to get 3 star wood armor
---
Also works at Whitesprings. Should be right on the red car in front of the doors you spawn at.
---
Also at Landview Lighthouse. Go to the top observation railing, Anne spawns against one of the railings.
---
All the sources I've found say its Fallout 76 only. Unless there is a mod that brings him to the game.
---
The most important thing is "HOW MANY OF EACH CAN YOU BUY IN ONE DAY?" I truly hope it's not limited.
---
Sounds like me and my last SBQ.  Sent the nuke off.  Fast traveled and disconnection.
---
Where can I meet these beautiful people on PC - hit me up folksssss
---
To answer your question, yes. Buy both.
---
Damn, maybe you're right. I should have climbed up there and checked for a pulse. Goddam kids and their goddam planking.
---
If they have plan for it (farmed tones SBQs, or paid 24k for one at enclace) they should know how expencive it can be.
---
I think I bought like 15-20 3 star legendaries from someone for like 50-200 caps each
---
True.  True.
---
They probably won‚Äôt. But hey, with good ole‚Äô pencil and paper you could do this yourself! Just write down what you‚Äôre selling and the price. Then at the end of the day, see what‚Äôs still for sale.
---
I snapped them up so quick I barely looked but I think they were 25 caps each so 1875 caps in total I think, I‚Äôve no idea what they are meant to be worth it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen them in a vending machine but it basically means I get the outfit 25 days sooner than I would have so win/win lol
---
Its very very close to the exams room. So if you walked for 5 mins you are way way to far. Its like 5 seconds from the exams room
---
I don't know much about it but i know it involves the Confederate hat.
---
The bait....
---
Player Vending Machine.
---
The plan....
---
MWAHAHAHAHA!
---
I'm kidding though, I won't be launching any of my potential customers! lol
---
Sure would be a hoot, though! *(...at least for me heh)*
---
You can get the recall card from vendors,it's 2k caps +/- perks.
---
True. I say things along this line about the game all the time. It can be crap, but it's my crap.
---
Thanks for the insight. Haven't played a single Diablo game before, so it's good to know this system has worked elsewhere.
---
What?? Are they just loose up there?
---
Someone was selling one for 12000 caps yesterday lol. I'm not joking......
---
Not sure if it's the best but I'm currently enjoying my bowie knife. Double damage to targets at full health, 40% power attack damage, +1 strength.
---
No, I'm XBone, but it's a first gen, so it has...... issues. The wife has the XBoneX. When I say CTD, I mean the game exits entirely and returns me to the XBox dashboard. Usually happens during loading screens.
---
I get the above crashes, too. The "annoying sound" one usually also returns me to the XBox dashboard, forcing me to manually restart the game. The behavior of that one leads me to believe it's an OOM error, which isn't uncommon for Bethesda games. 
---
The perpetual loading screen and the "server not responding" errors I chalk up to server-side issues.
---
I wouldn't. Both situations are easy to fast travel out of. The locked door comes with extra nefarious aspects. I would say of 30 camp visits yesterday, 8 to 10 were into a foundation, 5 or so got me jailed, and the rest were great. One guy had us warp directly I to the center of a outdoor room with 4 shops a stash and nothing more. It was tidy and smartly designed. The rest of his base was up above and totally blocked off. Guessing he turns a flat wall into a doorway when he gets home which is genius and much better than  a lock
---
I hope so. They shouldn't get to have fun if they rest of us don't.
---
The same a Halloween candy,... , I would have liked to see a ‚Äúreroll ‚Äú existing gear with bad stats, , this just seems lazy on Devs End
---
I think he says something like "why sheep"
---
also try to always have some halloween candy and some sweet psycho for your little monsters
---
Cuddle their mole rats while they mumble between each other and breathe heavy.
---
What article? Could you link?
---
Sell some of this stuff on FB and someone will give you a kidney and 100K+ The market on FB is stupid crazy. Then I can never get what I want from there. Reddit has been my place to get my gear.
---
Our crap.
---
Right, so if people buy a bunch from them at their "reduced" price, they easily make their caps back.
---
It's changed a lot for the better.
---
The latest update had a ton of QoL changes, now is a great time to try it out.
---
Launch was ass, but it's significantly better now.
---
Also if your able to resend the purchased legendaries back into scrip
---
without legendary effects i think assualtron blade, i tried to use onehanders in the first 2-3 months but their damage was garbage compared to 2handers. obv legendary effects matter but i wasnt lucky to find a decent 1hander legendary
---
I bought one for 5 caps on the first day of vending!
---
Yeah every time someone fast travels into the area it spawns enemies at any nearby spawn point who will come and attack them. If they're in your camp AFK or they're in vending ignoring the attackers, or they decide "not my fight" and leave because they spawned a scorchbeast then it will level your camp. 
---
Best advice is turret the place up or build in a low level area away from any fissures, or visit you camp after any visitors do to check if enemies are attacking it.
---
Kinda sucks to turn in a 3* to get the same or worse 3* you turned in...
---
I have 3 characters I play regularly. 1 has one of these drop anywhere basic camps. One foundation, a ladder, and 4 floor squares with all the necessities.  
---
One is a homestead, built to be a cool house in a great location. I like it a lot. Not fancy like some, but very safe, homey, and a great view.  
---
One is a vendor shop. Eye catching and built to be a country store roadside attraction sort of place. Not much of a house, vendors out front and crafting inside. When I need to go AFK for a while I sit in Uncle Sam garb out front right by the vendors.
---
You don't need to purchase anything from the atomic shop unless you like you stuff prettied up, and the DLCs are free updates. :) 
---
They're doing a lot to better the game. The content that just dropped is great! You can now place unwanted items up for sale, and they added a while new questline with meaningful rewards (increased carry weight).
---
There's still work to be done, but overall it's really fun, and the community is for the most part very helpful! :3
---
I don't know what system you have, but if you're on PS4, I can give you a few things to get you started. :D
---
Seems like everyone's got thursdays off.
---
What platform do you play - I'll be a patron in your store tonight!
---
Saw a 3 star pump action for 5000. But couldn't see the details. Kept my caps üòä
---
How do you go about getting a high level Black Diamond?
---
If that‚Äôs true then this game is seriously broke in terms of combat. My aae combat shotgun is not even good anymore. Bloodied seemed like the only viable way, what‚Äôs that saying? Diversity is the spice of life? Buff it all and make combat good again. I will say the energy weapon buffs have been very nice.
---
Nah, I just sold one for that much and was curious if it was you lol.
---
My only option is to fast travel. The issue with that is if the CAMP is afar from any discovered locations, I have to pay additional caps to travel and then the task of walking back.
---
That's what I do!
---
I can wait ü§£
---
You can just troll reddit instead.
---
Not too long ago I saw them still selling for max caps, so it's not too surprising.  Grats on the wealth tho!
---
It's actually a really good gun. Even after the nerf TSE's still perform good. I would definitely hold onto it for trade fodder. Caps are easy to come by, TSE's are not.
---
Hopefully it fixes the server crashes, they have been quite common.
---
You're really a wolf aren't you?
---
I need more info, such as how a DR value translates to a boost percentage, how much DR is it at 0 boost, etc.
---
Fyi, you don't need a Twitter account to view their posts.  Just head to https://mobile.twitter.com/bethesdasupport?lang=en
---
This is my worry too. I do BOS Heavy, so I just have to hope I get Heavy Combat, and upgrade it, or actual BOS Heavy :(
---
They probably do it to initiate PVP honestly. If you try to pick the lock to go use the vending machine, you become wanted and they can kill you
---
If you're on ps4 I'll for sure stop by
---
That by itself makes me so fucking happy.
---
I can do it after the update! Gamer tag: DomingDaDreaded
---
Look really cool, I‚Äôd definitely recommend it. 
---
(I have one either side of the large p/a statue, on a plinth with up lights lol)
---
It definitely is, given the event takes place, well, in the Arktos lab.
---
I'd guess this is the single most requested quality of life change made on this board. Which is not a reason not to post it -- it should keep getting posted and keep rising to the top in hopes that Bethesda will address it.
---
The current system is analogous to having to physically type "PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR NOW" whenever you character goes through a door instead of just clicking on it. The underlying capability of switching perk sets situationally is there, it's just intentionally tedious to discourage its use. A piece of software shouldn't make things tedious in order to minimize use of the feature; it should either have the feature and make it easy to use or not have it at all.
---
I want my Perk-o-Sets.
---
I guess if it doesn't exist, you will have no problem launching a nuke with only an automatic tesla rifle, right?
---
For weapons, Armor are 60.
---
I need bloodied furious two-shot drill
---
Yeah I have a couple. I think they're just a rare drop in general, and a legendary one is even more rare. There was a unique one given out as a reward for the buroughs quest(I think) with a vampires effect and stronger attack. It's called The Gutter. It would.be worth picking up for a 1h build.
---
My hero‚ù§Ô∏è
---
In other games, yes a hotfix is applied live, in bethesda terms it means quick patch that will take the servers down for two to three hours to fix what the patch messed up.
---
The more modern / rounded backpacks, are those mods in the game yet or will they probably be a Atom shop thing ?, really like them...
---
would look great on a Heavy combat armor :)
---
&gt;And the new event......it has to be the Arktos Pharmacy thing right?
---
According to datamined stuff, yeah.
---
I was the same.  I had my main buy my new char 3ea of marsupial and speed demon.  During double xp weekend I went from 5 to 22 or so.   I got to 30 and starched genes quickly after that.   I ended up using all 9 by lvl 30, but it was worth the 1200 caps. Plan accordingly and be mindful of rads and your low level alts can last awhile on a mutation.
---
Sometimes it works for me (with some visual bugs) and sometimes it doesn't. Do you get an issue where your mouse cursor will no go to the edge of the screen?
---
No I'm on ps4 and my bar is in the mire
---
I'm just going to call her Ms. Gheed for short
---
Why are you yelling at me? I can hear you just fine :P
---
Np, glad you found them!!!!!
---
I wonder if she just picks a random 3 star from all categories?  Might not be a bad thing as it looks to be quite a bit cheaper that way.
---
It's been interesting to see the creative placements for vendor camps. I now get visitors on top of Seneca Rocks at last.
---
I do not have cal. shocks. I want them for my X01 sometime soon though. Lol
---
Allows us to have Foxes too!
---
I also really want: Metal/Concrete floors.
---
I don't like the "grab-bag" style of purchasing.  99% of the 3\* items I get are going to be recycled for 40 scrip immediately.  And it looks like we can only buy one 3\* weapon per day?  Geez.
---
How do you get the backpack? The new quest ? I‚Äôm only asking since I haven‚Äôt played since the update.
---
I wish it was like Diablo where I could put a regular 10mm in with my scrip and it‚Äôll send out a legendary 10mm. This sounds like you could be hoping for a 10mm and get a middle launcher
---
Also unlike TSE which only required the effects, bloodied is as good as it is because of how well it synergizes with adrenal reaction, nerd rage, unyielding, serendipity, etc. If they were to nerf it, it'd be though caps to certain effects, like making stat increases from unyielding max out at +6, or making it so adrenal reaction and bloodied don't stack (this one would upset people though).
---
I've been putting broken cameras in my vendor for 2c I'm currently out but always check out shops that have supplies in Misc.
---
too bad you cant decide on what specific weapon or armor you want the effects to be on(like wanting only combat armor with 3 stars or a handmade with 3 stars)
---
Bloodied level 3 is standard for pretty much any build. +15% damage
---
I feel like if anything, it would be used to rename everything to "Bloodied explosive handmade rifle". I'm not sure if I've seen any kids in all my time playing the game. Feels like it's way too slow paced for that
---
I‚Äôm right there with ya except no good food
---
If you like environmental story telling and exploration - go with Fallout76.
---
If you like step learning curves and the rewarding feeling of overcoming said learning curve - go with MHW.
---
Both offer a great amount of content, and are planned to be continually updated with new content.
---
Oh also, if you own a xBone or a PC go with Fo76. If a ps4, go with mhw.
---
Dang. That sucks man
---
This is the best part. Lol i spent the last two days ft and buying. Tell you what its the best cap sink outthere...i burned 25k yesterday on new gear and ft. And im not even mad about it. My shop is full and my carry weight is low..and now i can play the game with mininal weight management. The wm was like a minigame. But now i open shop..go out and ft to all the shops in the world..do someevents.. All the while makin caps from my shop...and then what i dont want i scrap at the legendary scrapper..sell whats worth a little more once spots open up at my vendor stands. I fn love this game
---
Ya, that might be the new farming method.
---
Go to the pioneers camp in the toxic valley
---
Thank you for posting the info. Really appreciated, fellow wastelander.
---
I like how one half think that this is a good solution, and the other is like "so you're telling me that the purveyor won't be selling only 3 star TSE weapons"?
---
I'm in the mire real close to the free range event
---
The game seems to break every patch or update we get x.x
---
But there is a server wide maintenance to fix stability.
---
Since the update of patch 9, handful of glitches are reoccurring and servers are pretty unstable which makes harvesting a workshop undesirable.
---
Sadly 200% repair to raise stats was the bug:
---
 **Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition may incorrectly provide an increase to some stats.**
---
* **STATUS:**¬†This issue was addressed in Patch 9 on May 7.

---
Glowing ghouls at whitesprings. I've been 1 shorting most things during my quest for the backpack but they seem to be mid levels.
---
Who puts a video of this together? It‚Äôs kinda like a YouTube video that shows you the location of a plan only after 5 minutes to show them buying from a vendor...üôÑ
---
Nothing you've listed is "Must have" (to me).
---
Traveling Pharm, Thru-Hiker, Gunsmith-or-Makeshift warrior
---
Everything else is flavor depending on your gear/choices.
---
Except starched genes, that's a must unless the players doesn't yet understand the importance of mutations.
---
It's more stuff I can grab while out to sell later though
---
&gt;server doesn't go down, changes were made live" via injection. A quick google shows me it's just a general "changes to code 
---
This Exactly
---
Don't forget actual interior walls, lot of the current ones just look crappy on the inside.  We can make fusion cores from flux but haven't figured out the complicated art of wallpaper?
---
VATS melee is terrible in general. I sometimes get 0% hit on Super Mutants right in front of me, and I exit VATS in the same position, and my weapon will hit when I swing.
---
I guess you didn't read the other comment of someone else saying the buyable plan [for 3 opossum tokens] is a skin and not the physical pack itself.
---
But if you REALLY don't believe me that a tadpole can still buy it, I will log in and screenshot my tadpole status AND the (Known) Plan in the opossum vending machine. 
---
/insert immature emoji here/
---
Mongrel meat?
---
I‚Äôve seen them in player vendors, I‚Äôd imagine people will buy them to save the grinding.
---
Mine's in a little room with my fusion generator, behind a keypad door, which I built when someone came into my camp, smashed my generator and left without doing anything else. People are weird.
---
The update is worth the wait!
---
Honestly,  the type of player that will Google how to find a recipe ingredient are the same people who would Google "toxophilite." I say, go for it. No one has to read it, but the ones who want to will appreciate it.
---
That explains alot lol.
---
Yeah but I sold a 3 star broadsider.  In fact, it was the first one to sell!
---
I‚Äôd say always start with a summary of the topic and if that isn‚Äôt enough, let people read / see the rest of it, this way as a viewer you can quickly scroll through topics and dive in deeper when needed. 
---
If it‚Äôs videos you‚Äôre going to make, please don‚Äôt be another one of those ‚Äú9 min filler / 1 min actually good content‚Äù-tubers.
---
I'm super pumped for two reasons.  First you can see her skin, it's yellow, and that makes me happy about further deepening the mystery of the Molemen.  Secondly, she is setting up shop in Berkeley Springs - and I'm always happy when cool things get added to my stomping grounds in the Mire.
---
I am a little disappointed that you can't choose more particular categories for your legionaries though - I like rifles and pistols but all I ever get from the RNG is heavy weapons and it annoys me.
---
? It shows you the map where it is right away and then shows you running into the vendor which vendor you have to talk to...  Not sure what you're talking about.  Video is also only like a minute and 20 seconds long
---
Just so you know, there are no 4 Star machetes anymore. The sacrificial blade adding a fourth star was a bug and was fixed last update.
---
And I think meat hook is the best, with a god roll. I doubt you have anything that you could trade for a god roll though, so maybe look for a 1* bloodied meat hook or 2* bloodied + power attack. They usually sell for caps.
---
Nope any other player than yourself will spawn at the original position of the camp machine when it was placed down. If it has not been moved they will spawn on top of it. No Al the player owning the camp. Your spawn point us different. Aka it will be at the EDGE of your build area either directly in front of the camp machine light or directly behind it. At the edge of the camp. You can move the cp machine and change it's facing to adjust the owners spawn point a little. But it will still be on the edge of the build area.
---
That's been the going price for awhile. Mutation recipes go for 3500.
---
Like it says in the post,it wouldn't make sense. If im the only one hearing it though i dont think it would ruin anyone else's immersion lol
---
It's actually well thought. Will prevent people to choose exactly what they want in one hour, and doesnt' require you to server hop.
---
OG Gheed, I forgot the name of the lady you traded in blood shards too for gambling in D3.  Who cares, she‚Äôs in no way as important as Gheed
---
ding ding ding ding.
---
This is the biggest feature i want.
---
They all (90%) would be garbage
---
They're one time event rewards. If you're not a collector, save them to sell after the events end.
---
Yea that would be great, not trying to bust yer balls mate! Just wanna know and see proof, the more information you know is Always good üòÅ
---
No, That's the player's inventory. It's still random like diablo gambling
---
While we are at it maybe some mods for the mg42 pleeeaaase
---
One random three star weapon daily. Uh thats not good grind.
---
You could re-roll 3 different 2 star weapons in one day with the daily turn in of 150 scrip.  Eventually you are going to hit something good.  AA/E, B/E, Exc/E, F/E. Most of the 3 stars on weapons aren't all that important.
---
"I see you brought a knife-handle to a knife fight..."
---
*"Indeed..."*  
---
\*throws handle at their head\*  
---
\*power-fist upper-cut\*
---
Silliness aside... Reminds me of the [ballistic knife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_knife). Them folkers were crazy back in the day!  
---
*(Though apparently these came about far more recently than I had originally thought... I could've sworn I had seen them mentioned on a show as being a product of WWII or early-1950s. Guess not!)*
---
It was a good approach for Bethesda to meet in the middle with complaints about legendary drops. But someone will still complain that it‚Äôs not easy enough or unfair somehow. It always happens. I love this idea of randomizing and not getting a choice. It puts use to all of those damn legendaries that I‚Äôve been hoarding.
---
I agree, totally fair price.
---
I hadn't even considered re-scripping what she gives you, which makes it even better.
---
If your looking for pure damage per second then its usually better to go with the combat knife or similar ‚Äòfast‚Äô speed knives.
---
I have a simple one star vampire one and its epic. If you can get swing speed on it or any damage modifiers like armor penetration you can turn it into a blindingly fast killing machine.
---
150 scrip is the max per day so for one 3 3*'s you need to sell a ton of crap for 2 days. Most likely 3 since you won't always be able to buy every single last scrip in the store, like last night he had 2 scrip left that I couldn't buy.
---
It depends on which coast, west coast mutants have their genitals but have no distinct way of telling their genders apart, also they can‚Äôt breed. East coast mutants have no genitals and also can‚Äôt breed
---
Me too! Except I may have scrapped them by accident. Bummer I was going to sell them.
---
Pay it forward.. Even in a game it helps.
---
2 - very effective. Its realy important
---
3 - sometimes they cant see you in front
---
I bought someone's entire treasure map collection for 20 caps each. It's time for a treasure hunt!
---
To be honest, my camp has no doors. I could never figure out how to get them to attach to my walls.
---
Where are you seeing the ‚Äúone per day‚Äù?
---
Tunnel snakes rule!
---
What platform? I want to buy!!!
---
Daily limit from venders is still 1400 caps, while this is a good short term cap boost, it isnt sustainable for the player
---
They are after the plans...
---
As rare as explosives became it broke my heart when they nerfed my shotgun and the explosive radius. At least give us the option to use grenadier to bring the radius back to where it was. I'm glad they're taking steps in the right direction on some things, but they are killing a lot of our fun. I love explosive weapons even after they got nerfed the first time. But now there is really no point to them. I might as well use my regular shotgun since the blast radius is non existent
---
now that i'm selling stuff stash limit becoming a big issue for me. My prices are going to come way down very soon. I have radaway and stims for 12 caps and there not moving.
---
I will for sure, whenever I can!
---
I'm so scared of the coherent sentences. I'm gonna get told on daily
---
Easily worth 25k. It‚Äôs a steal for 18.
---
I've ran my vending machine in Survival for 2 days, it's only been trashed 2x in 12 or so hours of game play.
---
I‚Äôm not happy with the new lotto style system
---
Right yea, lets gives everyone the option for to have a bloodied explosive with only two rerolls! Seems like a great idea that wouldnt make farming/the economy pointless
---
My Marine chest used to go from 60 dmg resist to something like 79 when repaired to 200%. I will miss this. I want to say that my weapons would do more damage when repaired to 200% also.
---
You still offering it?
---
I WAnt aN OverPOWerED WeaPON wHILe puTtIng oUT the leASt amoUNt Of EFForT PosSible
---
Oh I never checked.  Are they gonna re-enable it?  If not they shouldn't have an option on it when you look at it.
---
I would much prefer to see a randomized weapon that I can opt against buying.  I'd rather not waste 100 scrip on a nocturnal/bashing/+dr while aiming 10mm pistol, and just keep the scrip for the next day.
---
lol just this morning i said to myself. " could you imagine picking up this game for the first time right now?" i mean you'd think powering up a power plant was taxing! i love how much content we've gotten since launch.
---
they "fixed" over repairing, it no longer increases damage or defences anymore
---
A 3* legendary armor goes for 65 and and the ranged &amp; melee weapons go for 100. Plus, you can roll a random 3* legendary (Armor or weapon!) For 65 scrip. Granted, you can generate 150 scrip per day so this is pretty fair if you ask me.
---
Wow that's good info
---
There are things worth far more than 30k caps
---
So three chances to get an awesome 3 star every 2 days? Pretty cool.
---
I had a guy log out on me when I was at his base (on some monster cliff face). He logged, I dropped, died on a ledge on the side of a mountain. 30 minutes and 40 jet pack AP charges and I got my junk back.
---
I had to open it in another tab.  If I clicked the link it was stuck zoomed out.
---
Thank you yes that's probably the right word. As I say, if I scrap the turrets I'll be able to 'finish' it. Might do even it for pics then re-arm the roof. Thanks for taking an interest.
---
Not really related but as an electrician I hate how trivial camps make my job feel lol
---
Someone played stealth archer in Skyrim.
---
I really hope they don't actually try to lessen rare effects. Just let it be random and equal possibility for any effect.
---
participate in the imposter sheepsquach event...EVERYONE dies in that little puddle of water.
---
IP addresses are traceable and can be linked to player's accounts, I doubt it's even possible to play FO76 through a VPN.
---
BGS are probabable just recording all the cheaters details and will pull the trigger on bans in one fell swoop .
---
I've seen several comments regarding the cap being 1000 scrip.
---
I don't know yet since it's not possible to confirm for a few more days, but it seems likely.
---
There is one little thing, you could do this whole day in diablo. In fallout u can scrap legendaries to get 150curency daily. And weapon cost 100. Thats one try to get good weapon daily....
---
Wait, you can get legendary bone weapons? Never seen one in-game
---
My camp is a stashbox and some crafting stations in the wilderness üòÇ
---
There is some happy medium in my view.  When they rolled it out it was too harsh of a penalty 2x your level but the adjustment was a bit much the other way - now 25% of your level. 
---
I‚Äôd be fine with 100% of your level.  As a lvl 185 only getting 30-40 caps a kill doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a reward or penalty.
---
This everything I hoped for. Shear awesomeness.
---
Correction. Nothing to you is worth that much. If they can get that price for it regularly than the market has spoken. You may not find it worth it but if it can sell at that price then that's the price a smart seller will set.
---
Text please?
---
um....i've been looting your water for awhile now.
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
You get plans for the tad pool and the standard pack. After you do that complete the possum challenges and you can buy mods for the standard pack
---
Weapon Issues:
---
#All
---
Issue: Weapons Repaired to 200% No longer gain the bonus Damage. (Ticket Submitted on 05-08-2019)
---
WeaponArtisan01 "Weapon Artisan" [PERK:003D295F]
---
WeaponArtisan02 "Weapon Artisan" [PERK:003D2960]
---
WeaponArtisan03 "Weapon Artisan" [PERK:003D2961]
---
Prior to Patch 9 Weapons would receive a Bonus to Damage if repaired to 200% (Really anything over 100%) and would slowly loose the bonus Damage as the "Over Repair" was slowly brought to 100% or Lower, that is now missing.
---
Fix:
---
Unknown
---
*Edit* I've gotten a response from one of the Community managers, they are looking into this.
---
‚Äã
---
I sold mt TSE Handmade at my CAMP shop today for 3K.
---
I just wanted to get rid of it and vendors offered around 100c.
---
I agree, I would love to be able to display or even share pictures I've taken of other vault dwellers with those people but I can understand some issues. The pictures would need to be hosted server side for all players instead of local to prevent people from showcasing Debbie opening her vault.
---
People are already saying theyre mad they cant reroll theyre own legendaries to add in perks like bloodied and explosive... lmao crazy
---
If OP doesn't reply im looking to do this once the servers go up
---
So another slightly better version of the monster mash?  Disappointing to say the least.
---
If the price point on the roll is decent then it won‚Äôt be too bad.  150 script for a 3star roll I think is reasonable since you‚Äôd get 40 back recycling the junk.  However if one starts rolling the permutations it‚Äôs already astronomical to get your god roll, why add another astronomical system?
---
Rerolling individual stars on drops you have can still be random, can have a balanced cost, and give you an endgame goal for your work, at some point.
---
This system was the best chance at fighting off the duped items out there and bringing prices back into reason.  It pulls the pendulum back a bit, but not nearly enough.   Perhaps it will be better in practice than it sounds in type, patch 9 sure was!
---
So you spend 100 on a weapon that is most likely going to be dogshit just for you to sell it back for 40, nice. 
---
All jokes a side I'll have to wait and see how this will go down
---
TSE nerf was close to January/February. 
---
What happened in December was the duping explosion and the carry weight glitches being stamped out.
---
The Stimpak Diffuser is in the game files but nowhere in the game world. I bet Bethesda is adding the Stimpak Diffuser into the game world so that the Medic Badge can be obtained.
---
Mystery pick? Interesting
---
Hey look you found option 4 but what about the other 3 options I listed. Any input on those?
---
Ur base is haunted
---
I think it takes both unarmed and one handed. That‚Äôll probably be patched at some point because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt seem to have intended anything to be capable of double dipping.
---
With melee, you have just enough to cover two or one handed. Those are the regular, expert and master slugger/gladiator, as well as martial artist and incisor. That takes up all 15 strength points. So for a meat hook you need to ditch either incisor or martial artist if you want that extra damage. You could probably go without incisor since your damage is going to be ridiculously high anyway, if the hook is bloodied.
---
That I get, but pieces found and received as rewards that were 100% or less as well?
---
You on xbox?
---
Going off of that, maybe have basic guides for each of the merit badges, then have a link in each of them, for those who are interested, to a page that has just the answers. Group the answers by merit badge, but have it behind expandable boxes so people don't have to load the whole wall-o-text at once, but also don't have to click through several pages to get whatever they're looking for.
---
I actually did that once. Would you believe zero people died in the water that time? It only came up the one time, I almost bought a card.
---
Haha Thats what I am about to do now lol!
---
Be at least level 45 when you finish rose's quests, though I realise that is less than helpful advice if you already did it at a lower level. My first character got black diamond at level 25,ans for the second one I deliverately waited, and her black diamond is much better.
---
Although, I have found black diamonds at vendors that were also level 45 but had better stats than mine,and I'm not sure why. But until I found that instigating blade, my black diamond was by far the best 1hand weapon I had.
---
If you were smart this would have been how you did it in the first place because it was always possible to do it this way without getting wanted.
---
If you have to choose, it depends on what experience you are looking for. Fallout has come a LONG way from its extremely shitty launch and is now in a fairly solid, playable state. Lots of exploring and crafting is the focus here.
---
Monster Hunter was excellent and polished at launch (although multiplayer and matchmaking can be very awkward) and has had some very significant updates since then. It has a deep, satisfying crafting system, and amazing combat.
---
I still think Monster Hunter is an overall better game, but it really just comes down to what your preference is.
---
Actually, that's exactly what typos do. They either turn a word into a different word, or they become non-words.
---
Word - a word  
---
Ward - different word  
---
Wird - not a word
---
Details... often many are too general and when quests don‚Äôt put up a diamond over the item or marker, it‚Äôs frustrating for users. 
---
Actual screen shots along with zoomed in map pic. 
---
On that note... maybe have a map with linked markers to the page that item/quest is on would be cool...
---
And if you don't like it, scrap it for 40 scripts.  So really it's 60 scripts for a crap roll and 100 scripts for a keeper.
---
Free Range almost has *too* many plans for their drop rate, it got old for me after the 30th run with no sheepsquatch shard, so I ended up just buying it from a player vendor and calling that event done for good.
---
They must holster weapons to not be hostile.
---
A grip too.
---
Unless it was a 3\* Stalkers, 50% reflects damage while blocking, 90% reduced weight Rolling Pin.
---
Never actually :) heh. Always played Daedric wearing swordsman.....pretty much your power armor wearing rifleman that I play now!
---
I'd like to try it though :)
---
Never seen pegendary bone weapons in the game - had the same thought
---
Giving people the easy choice to have an overpowered perk will make the entire legendary system and farming pointless..
---
Proper reflex sight for the Minigun too. I mean, you can slap high-tech night vision sight on a pipe rifle yet you can't have quality optic for your big gun? That doesn't make any sense!
---
This week's reward will not make you rich, as it is (was?) bugged, and almost everyone will have it already. Apart from that, many people missed the opportunity to get previous ones, so their price will increase over time. I already sold two of the first ones last week for 2000c each. To me, they are too heavy to keep them for too long, but the collectors have enough mule characters and the storage to stow them away. ;-)
---
My CAMP is a junkyard selling bulk junk.  Sitting on a junk pile, getting those sweet caps.
---
Plus, I saved up about 5k loose screws waiting for player vending.  They sell like hotcakes even at 5c each.
---
Hope they don‚Äôt take them back. I was surprised to kill a lvl 1 scorched, take a forest region workbench and put a basic turret - then suddenly get Resolute Veteran. Accidentally found the glitch, but not gonna complain :)
---
Final stretch of the original main quest chain will have it. 
---
If you don't mind spoilers, &gt;!you can sequence break to it by visiting the [abandoned waste dump](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abandoned_waste_dump), *somewhere* near the Southern Belle Motel.!&lt;
---
I can handle OP for a short while until I go through another transitionary phase :P
---
If the vendor operates like any other vendor, their stock is typically set to a cell, and doesn't change through the day when they're constantly being visited.  I don't claim to know all the mechanics of how the vendors work, but if I buy a calibrated x-01 mod from the enclave, the vendor will only have two x-01 mods for the rest of the day, or until roughly 11am est when everything resets for the new daily challenges, etc.
---
I do agree it would be nice to pick at leat one affect.
---
They misspelled rolling pin üòÇ
---
I REALLY hope we get legendary PA
---
&gt; I am not sure, but were a lot more terminals locked at launch than now?
---
I think the difference is that because of these challenges more people are hacking them now. If you arrive at an area shortly after someone else has already picked a lock or hacked the terminal then it will also be accessible for you without the hacking/picking
---
I was goibf to say the exact same thing. Literally every single door in my camp is wide open. I may have to start locking em for this very reason.
---
other people say no to escape artist,but it works for me. No silly armours and mutations,
---
in power armour,in crouch........ I swear they can't see me 4ft away, as long as I dont move. they  just stand there looking as I pump lead into them. NOT pvp
---
I wish she'd let us choose the actual weapon. I'd hate to roll my dream effects and have it load on a rolling pin.
---
No math is needed, its displayed.
---
even with all sneak maxed i cant sneak up on anything anymore, they did something 3-4 patches ago which now makes sneak melee very hard if not impossible
---
Wallpaper is more complicating then making a fusion generator lol
---
Those people are spoiled and expect free handouts. If it‚Äôs not about legendaries dropping the star level they want, it‚Äôs something else. Why not just give everyone assassin sentinel gear with AP refresh?
---
They don‚Äôt get that the easier they make the game, the faster you run out of things to do. Then you‚Äôre bored and complain more. I‚Äôm loving this pioneer scout deal. There‚Äôs. A lot to do and it takes more than five minutes to do. The burrows was a bust because it was a 5-10 minute quest. It seems like Bethesda gets condemned with no matter what they do.
---
Great info, thank you!
---
What stars will be possible?
---
Yeah I've seen on youtube, all looks so cool! I believe that the funky stashbox was datamined for the atomic shop later on, so that may be the first stashbox skin I buy!
---
ive played since day 1 of beta, playing almost every single day. I learned how to do vendor runs within the first 2 weeks. 1400 caps per day for like 100 days. Sure I have too many caps, but I put my time in and it lets me afford insanely priced items. 
---
nothing i sell is above 10k. i just have sooooo much stuff to sell and now i get to hoard the best gear for some reason. idk i guess i like hoarding?
---
How about the BOS engineer outfit, I wonder. It has two small tanks of some sort on the back. I hope there‚Äôs an invisibility mod for backpacks...
---
Are you my Dentist, by chance?
---
I like the idea. But I keep my camp out by Fort Defiance for the lead deposit so even if I don't have a workshop I'm continually making ammo.
---
It‚Äôs really weird that they haven‚Äôt added type chat for pc. Like, really weird. I‚Äôd like to hear one good reason for why it would be a bad idea, but I won‚Äôt, because no such reason exists.
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs just weird.
---
&gt;  that would make perks that you only need to use once in a while like lockpicking and armor repair ect... pointless because you would only switch out and switch back right away
---
People don't do that already? Serious question. I don't keep my picklock/hacker cards active, and whenever I run into something I need them for, I got into my perk cards and swap them, do the activity, then swap them pack. It's a pain, and would love a way t hotkey it, but I still do it otherwise. I assumed most people did this.
---
Yup. They didn‚Äôt design it to be done fast and I love it. It took me a day and a half to get the standard backpack. Do I regret the outcome vs. how long it took me? Let‚Äôs see, I‚Äôm in regular armor and I can carry 385. Put that with weight reduction perks and armor. Hell yea it‚Äôs worth a day and a half worth of ENTERTAINING work. I found a lot of humor in the challenges and quests. I love that they put such a variety of things to do that if I‚Äôm like, man I‚Äôm bored farming or I don‚Äôt feel like launching a nuke. Well you have another aspect to the game now. Go do that. Bethesda should release more content like this.
---
Yeah I mean, it's gambling. The allure is that you MIGHT win the jackpot. But I imagine odds will be low to keep the playerbase visiting the purveyor
---
so it works even if people are not in your party?
---
\*angry trees\*
---
\*buildings laugh\*
---
Are you on ps4? Lol I sold all my duplicate maps for that much lol
---
I've met a handful of kids, one was a 12 year old from my country i taught how to play. But yeah the game has an age limit so they're not really supposed to play the game. I was saying "12 year old" in jest because that's the mental age of people using offensive names on their weapons just because you arent allowed to.  
---
But yeah you're right ofc, people would definitel√∂y try to scam with it.
---
Fireproof 3 yes. Actually haven't tried dense or pneumatic, although I am aware of dense being a good option. I run all Bloodied/Adrenal,  Bolstering Sentinel with nerd rage, evasive, dodgy all highest rank.
---
My!
---
Murmrghthulu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!
---
It look like her name is basically "murmur".
---
Do you know if that is the case with the chainsaw? I haven‚Äôt been on since this last patch went live.
---
Legendary boning eh.
---
I think you're right - I opened and expanded the image and on closer inspection they appear to be dirty gardening gloves with daises on them.  Damn.
---
It's going to be an atom shop armor. Has been datamined twice. I was the one that made the post a few days back assuming it would be new armor, so apologies for getting you excited for it, because I was too.
---
I‚Äôll also add that I waited for this patch with high anticipation for vending. I thought the pioneer scouts was going to be a bust. Bethesda didn‚Äôt fall short of appeasing my anticipation. So far I love it all that got changed and added.
---
Wait what?!??!?!
---
Maybe before the TSE nerf.  Now they can be had for under 10k in most cases.  I bought my TSE Handmade for 3k.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes you have to go to your map but if you log off across the map and your camp is on the other side you might not think to check it. Not everyone returns home before logging off
---
I believe it does 25% of the first bullets damage.
---
that would be terrifying
---
We need to just start banding together in groups to have a big old Iron Islands sea baptism ceremony.
---
My question is, are we guaranteed max level?
---
I dont supose i could trade or buy that camera  from you?
---
 I‚Äôm curious about the radiation resistance version. In my wildest dreams it‚Äôs just as good as a hazmat suit or power armor so you can actually walk into nuke zones without power armor on. ...but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll be underwhelming as usual.
---
I‚Äôm not with this guy ya‚Äôll. keep doing you.
---
Your brain.....
---
Welcome to The Enclave.
---
Are the servers offline?
---
They should be max lvl for everyone but who knows. Dont weapons scale based on the enemies level? So if shes high lvl id assume theyll all be max. Though i dont get my hopes up for any updates.
---
Hi! We brought the game offline to make an improvement to server stability. We don't have a specific end-time to share for maintenance, but you can keep track of any updates during downtime on the Fallout 76 forums:
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/340745/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-may-9-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
I have heard chinese players have been complaining about how the game performs through VPN at times, so it apparently does work.
---
Alternatively, people might connect via neighbors wifi, or via phone tethering.
---
Plus some australian ISPs have gone to ISP driven NAT, unless the client requests otherwise due to games/servers not working, which means pools of people on the same ISP will now show up as having the same IP, so IP driven banning would be a bad idea.
---
Daddy i dont want to drive that old car,i want a BMW as my first car!Make it happen or i will cry!

Oh! Duh, never even thought of selling those. Good idea

Don't forget that your scrip cap is 1000, too.
---
Nawh too much ammo farming. Faster atrack deathclaw gauntlet is best! Bloodied is top.
---
Yeah, I know people have had trouble finding them and I have a fully-kitted out one to  spare. Sadly, there's no way to sell or trade it. C'mon, vending machines! Be useful! \*kick\*
---
Heard, that‚Äôs true. I was at WS before but I was ready for a move and thought this could be fun. (Plus fuck the SB attack‚Äôs there right now.)
---
I'll have a game night with you, what do you want to play?
---
I have DND, and some board games like Pandemic and Zombicide.
---
You can visit it yourself if you want . You just have to run before it loads up and you are inside the shop.
---
you know that "farming just for the sake of farming" is not good game design, right? nor the possibility of farming for decades and have nothing to show for it. that's Fo76 currently.
---
dupers made people think rolling TSEs is easy when, in truth, without them, less than 1% of the playerbase would have access to specific rolls.
---
I got mine, I was surprised (and a little sad) to see how dead the survival was. The idea is great though, I'm going to try going in there a bit more
---
The one you can get hold of.
---
Just don't forget to adequately maintain it and it won't let you down.
---
yup, ripper/chainsaw/buzzsaw/drill no longer get a boost to damage, they are now useless once again
---
thats what i meant. Hoping the update the server scripts to allow it to be bought, and to detect when the frog habitat is placed.
---
I heard there was a massive dupe, I'd assume they're fixing that
---
I will say though, that I do not actively seek pvp. I do my own thing primarily being pve. But I found early on that there are those who will prey on people such as me. So I just made it a point to be able to stand my ground, and win in most cases, at least recently when it occurs. I'm sure there are awhile lot of builds that would utterly destroy me. I just want to hold my own if the need arises.
---
i feeel like either furious/instagating would be better on 1 handed weapons since they dont have the high damage big hit like 2H does
---
Aw, I‚Äôm on PS4. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Anyone know why it was taken down? Asking since didn't even know servers were going down today.
---
This makes sens but if its a skin for what armor type is it? I think it might be trapper im not sure but its the only armor i can relate it to be
---
so, why the random movement, like a ferret that found the meth stash? Does that help the spawns?
---
Seriously, people are so damn whiney.
---
"The Burrows is so stupid, it took me 5 minutes to finish"
---
"The Scout quests are so stupid, it'll take forever to get them all done."
---
Choose a damn whine and stick to it.
---
My sneak is such that I can just wander about without much hassle, I hangout in westtek and just listen to the mutants chat. It‚Äôs pretty chill.
---
Stealth sniper build. When maxing out with full weightless gear, chameleon mutation, cards etc. Many times I would bump into baddies and still not be seen. Other times I could not sneak hit them while hidden. It's a fun build but kinda unstable in game to go for a full sneak based build, gotta have backup.
---
Awww man, the quantum paint?! Nice.
---
Interesting!!! I have an unyielding suit and I think 3 of the 5 pieces are light....we could be off to a good start! :) So there's no difference between the chameleon mutation and the armor effect?
---
Kudos i've long said the same thing for any game that has this in it. I don't understand why that is not the standard just common sense, way back in the day "alittle" game had it so you could even log out and still have your vendor going... GASP!!! it only took them a few years to do that and the player base crying about BS when the true fans had it so hard that we had to go to one "zone" and chat spam just to sale crap to make crap that was JUST barely better then vendor items and that made you UBER lol. O the good ole days of gaming...
---
Yeah I was referring to the vault doors
---
I just asked this in another thread. It would be nice if we can choose item‚Äôs level after the specs are revealed at the checkout screen, say if I want to give a good item to my lower level alt that I‚Äôm building.
---
I had the same problem. SO i put my switch to high to reach, and have a locked terminal I can control it with.
---
Brahmin have udders and horns. So I have news for you...
---
In that I have no idea what that means other then they are probably hermephadites like earthworms.
---
Apologies again. It doesn't seem to be a skin. I believe it's an outfit, which would go over your armor.
---
Dannnnnnggg I literally played double exp weekend from 12-48 just to have a chainsaw character and now I gotta go to the oh so ‚Äúmeta‚Äù sledgehammer :(
---
Always down to play a bard.
---
I am a #EncumberedExcavatorBoi
---
But maybe some day, some day!
---
I'm 151 and still haven't delved into a silo yet.  I guess I need to now to make sure I can complete a Scout Badge and finish up the Overseer quest.
---
in my case, usually 5 mins before I need to leave for work :(
---
And that wouldve allowed them to remain OP and something to work towards. Just off of farming, I had about 5-6 two shots, 2 explosives, 3 sentinel pieces, and 3 bloodied weapons
---
I guess I'm missing where it states you can only spend a certain amount each day. I know you can only accumulate 150 scrip per day.  But if I save up 500 scrip I don't see why I couldn't drop that all in one day.
---
Maybe I should do that too XD
---
TLDR?
---
Anywhere between the vids of WitnessMeGaming and Top Ranking Noob should be a good length I guess ;) good luck man, whats the site?
---
They could limit PA to 2 stars since they already have high damage resistances etc
---
Anything obviously missing in that build skeleton I posted? And also, would you have advice on armor?
---
 I cannot leave my Combat Knives. They are very strong and amazing fun.
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed one hits 250+ before Adrenaline kicks in. That's maybe 4 times a sec and you can do that till your mouse breaks.
---
 DPS baby. ;)
---
id say check out the fallout wiki to see which quest weapons/armors you would only want to be max level and avoid those quests.
---
I keep them on because its such a pain in the ass to change them, and that pain in the ass changing is the only reason to keep them on. If you could easily swap with a hotkey they might as well not exist anymore outside level gating
---
I don't care if the weapons are god-roll or not, I'd just like to see what I'm buying specifically and choose not to waste money on something with horrible effects.
---
Might be easier so players can look at or do multiple things in a certain area while they‚Äôre there. 
---
For example, Rosie‚Äôs quest at top of the world also has a survey marker near where you spawn in. 
---
Taking a pic at this location and 3? other similar survey markets is one of the atom challenges. Being that it‚Äôs a 4‚Äù round disc on the ground and not easy to see would be good info for free stuff.
---
This is what they want, they wana promote trading with others still
---
I googled most answers but not all answers. I knew some :p
---
I do this exact same build. Armor weight matters little, full heavy bos and I notice no difference. With max agility and sneak perk some enemies will touch you without noticing, but once you open fire they'll be hunting you down.
---
When you get close to the Top of the World you'll pick up a radio station, listen to it and that starts a quest.  Won't spoil it for you.
---
Have a feeling people like me are going to spend 10k scrip get nothing and just quit because random loot in this game is disappointing 99% of the time.
---
put punji boards around the crops. Critters stop and attack those first, giving the turrets time to wipe them out. And the boards are very cheap to repair.
---
It may seem like it‚Äôs a lot. But with all these new players coming to the game now since content is flowing,  you wouldn‚Äôt want them to have easy access to explosives from the jump..
---
Before few months o could stab mobs in face with sneak modifier (with maxed agility to another dimension). Now when i use range weapon and get spoted there is no fucking way to lose combat, you must run away. Anoying shit. It triggers me only thinking about that.
---
It was a shot in the dark :)
---
I moved my camp and couldn't place the building because the building "needed support". I broke it down and started over.
---
This is one of the most common suggestions.  I fully agree, we should be able to save perk loadouts and switch them at the press of a button.
---
OK, that sounds like what I need. Does the build outline I posted make sense?
---
It will take a longer time because 150 scrip daily limit and rumored1000 max, but I have enough legendaries right now to pull probably  100 3\* randoms.  People on this board will complain about anything.  There is going to be huge influx of god weapons, wonder how this will change the market.
---
Same for legendary Urban Scout armor, I've never seen that drop. Are they teasing some more changes under the hood here?
---
Thanks for the heads up! I didn‚Äôt start with the melee build and have basically just been farming so I‚Äôm not too far into weapons and armor and what not. 
---
Thank you for advice.
---
Ohhhhh ok. I just started that. Didn't make the connection that it was the raider faction.
---
Huh I like that. So you don't care if you're getting good or bad item, but in the end you would like not to get a bad item. So you effectivly do care about getting good item.
---
All they have to do to keep the odds of getting something good is just staying the course with their RNG system.  I started playing in BETA, typically spend at least 80-90% of my game time farming legendaries, and have maybe kept a small handful of pieces to actually use for my character.  The rest were sold, given away, or traded for gear that would benefit me.
---
You can only build one camp though. Once your done, ditch the crap. I started running a bloodied melee build, I can still carry 380 lbs without the perk to boost. You need to choose. Carry a bunch of useless crap, or hit like semi. Hoarding in this game is not needed, you can get a ton of anything you need rather quickly.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so I‚Äôll give you one
---
Stealth boys are still worth using. They have the benefit of actually keeping you invisible while you move, the effect/ mutation only works while you're stationary.
---
I travelled alot also, before I found one at Colonel Kelly monument. The quest didnt trigger first time, so had to find a tourist again. Found another at same spot after two tries. Worth a shot. https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1533
---
Gunsmith if using ranged weapons.
---
Weapon Artisan and any other cards that increase durability past 100% on repair.
---
Weapon damage cards for whatever weapon type you're using.
---
Everything us is fairly optional to me.
---
Really wish we had a way to do a single time respec or one that costs caps, but increases in cost each time. Just got a two shot gatling plasma that I can't use because I was forced to build for a VATS combat rifle I had. Now I need to spend the next 30 levels moving points to strength and picking up heavy weapon perks. The system really doesn't allow for trying different builds which kinda sucks.
---
Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Nice. I might actually just go for two star rolls and see if I can get some bloodied fire rate weapons, a third star for -15% reload speed would be nice but maybe not worth the extra cost until I have a good two star.
---
Weapon artisan is amazing
---
No, i just don't like standing, adhd or something like that :D
---
It seems a very complicated calculation involving armor weight and such. The chameleon armor is kind of better as you stay invisible while shooting. It has changed a lot patch to patch as well so not sure the exact setup now, but has been working pretty good lately. I wish there was a sneak stat.
---
Than you for the response so far guys it's been largely positive even where there have been some criticisms. :)
---
I feel for ya'. Fortunately my bases have been bland 2x3 structures. Ive been burned too many times with elaborate bases.
---
I saw the same thing last night in the launcher. Also couldn't sworn it mentioned "update". Alas, we're only human, and we all make mistakes. *(Maybe not at the rate Bethesda does.......... lol Half kidding, devs! &lt;3)*
---
It depends entirely on what your build and preferences are.
---
For example, I consider my .50 Cal BE Hunting Rifle one of the best weapons in the game in most circumstances, but there are definitely some people who are going to disagree with that.
---
At the end of the day, what build do you have and prefer? Fast melee, slow melee, ranged combat? If you can be more specific about that, we might be able to give an input or two.
---
Sneak is a tricky topic because there‚Äôs tons of variables that people don‚Äôt see that affect the effectiveness of sneak. I‚Äôve been running 28-30 agility, muffled legs and the correct cards. Most of the time I go around unnoticed. Other times I think the super mutant got mad when I put my finger in his but. Lighting does play a factor but it‚Äôs not a necessity if you‚Äôre running the right cards and build.
---
I guess the bottom line is that no matter what, you will always have a chance to be spotted. It‚Äôs up to you to modify your perks, armor and playstyle to be able to fully utilize sneak. I have a pure melee stealth build character and a hybrid melee/ranges. I‚Äôll admit that both do crazy damage but I‚Äôm favoring my ranged a lot more. 
---
I hear all of the complaints saying melee needs nerfing. My response is, you must not be playing ranged right. Trash mobs, including scorched beasts drop like flies. I tried pvp, two to four bullets out of an auto assault rifle picks most people off. Plus you get chameleon. Unpopular opinion, shame on me. Everyone basically runs sneak builds unless they are in PA. I don‚Äôt believe any of it really needs a nerf anymore. Not even sent/cavalier.
---
I do think it's a good amount, but just having that little boost would be great to horde some extra loot to put it up for sale in the vending machines. As of right now I don't have much to sell simply because I can't store a lot of it.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. But it is actually pretty funny.
---
Yeah I just make a screenshot with my phone of my inventory and caps when I log in and then do the same when I log out. 
---
(Not really useful to see how much caps I made though, been spending way too much myself hah)
---
I recently made a team based character and simply equipped starched genes every time I used rad away to keep them while leveling up (now somewhere in the 90s).
---
[I've since gained a few more but when perked properly. . .](https://i.imgur.com/6QJkCAb.jpg)
---
PS4 anyone want to grind the event ?
---
Yeah guess so, I mean for me it would just be 1-2 stars, can't think of anything that really be good on PA being the third star, but thought came to mind, I'd die for PA part that negates a certain amount of explosion damage, that would be greeeeaaaat. But eh, we'll have to see what Beth will do, since they call the shots!
---
That's got to be one of the new Nuka-shine hangover locations.
---
Im really not sure of that. I have try with missile turret and i never see any option like that. Btw im only using normal turret so a terminal cannot be linked. Its a big problem and Bethesda need to fix that asap.
---
Yeah only dupers and those who benefited from it should have the gear they want!
---
sentinel assasians plus 1 strength lvl 50 heavy combat armour left leg, got it for 380 caps at whitesprings
---
LOL. I use Combat Knives and I use em' a lot. 
---
 For fun I will do Harper's Ferry with my knife and my BoS Heavy Combat with a couple of Chameleons. I can do that quite fast and take little damage. Ghouls I wreck and the Muties die pretty quick too.
---
 No stealth is useless ... NOT!
---
Lol look how the gun is held and fired and tell me how on earth you could keep that thing in a straight line while firing
---
I manage 800 pretty well but I‚Äôd be geeked to see 1000, would give me a chance to actually stock up on junk and ammo üëçüèº
---
Sounds like something fun I might do with my leftover mole money. Worst case it gets chipped for scrip or sold for caps.
---
I might be because I'm on mobile but when I click on it, it just gives me a wall that ask for me to sign in and won't let me exit out or scroll through the Twitter page.
---
could be mine actually :P
---
Ah, wont work with "standard" turrents
---
Grab a hazmat suit and get a friend to give you a bunch of ammo.  Craft a pistol or something and shoot a few bullets at enemies before your friend kills them.
---
If you are an engineer that is that bad at math I hope you aren't designing anything I ever have to live or ride in. Your example wouldn't get you your target of 300.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you currently. 
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
Add me up and I‚Äôll be able to play next week
---
Neighter, i have make some test in other camp without weapon and i was auto attacked.
---
really? where?
---
If I were Bethesda I would be laughing hard now, but I get the point and I think is a nice way so people will actually spend a time in the others camps.
---
\- We are working our asses off to make new content for them and they want to play blackjack, poker, domino, tetris in their camps.
---
Wish I would have waited until I was a higher level for this
---
So let say you have zero scripts. And you want to grind legendaries, so you pick up 300lbs of legendaries, stand to scraping machine and get only 150 scripts (1weapon). Then you have to wait 20 hours to get another.
---
Thats one weapon daily. still missing?
---
If you're on PC I can build you a camp ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Then at 1000, people will want 1200.
---
 Hey I need room for that shit-ton of ammo and aid I won't use.... but just in case.
---
..I've tried every build and profession in Skyrim..and always end up stealth Archer to some degree lol!
---
So, reading it as I did and looking at the pic it appears as if we get to chose our weapon, just not the effects, yeah, that's fckn awesome. If I can choose a 3* bloodied super sledge and only have to gamble a bit on the effects, that's way better than farming and getting ridiculous garbage. Stop crying and enjoy what we have, this was never once implied that you would get to choose your exact load out, and it shouldn't be that way.
---
Are you on xbox? 
---
If so, I might have stopped by your C.A.M.P.!
---
Someone had their camp setup along a riverbed and I jumped off repeatedly into the water to down myself and have someone revive me, and the owner of the camp downed theirself in the water for me.
---
Someone PLEASE check something for me (or just fact check).
---
There are 3? classifications of melee weapon.  If you're looking for a specific kind, you have a 33% chance to get at least that part the way you want.
---
There are... 6? ranged categories (shotguns, explosives, heavy guns, hand guns, rifles, automatics, energy, am I missing some)?  So your odds of getting the kind you're looking for is 1/2 as much as your melee chances.
---
Seems a little...skewed.  Granted, I'm primary range on my main (though my second is melee).  It doesn't seem like gambling for ranged weapons is nearly as interesting as gambling for melee.
---
Imma have to add that to my To-Learn list. While I'd like to think I can do a lot, interactive maps isn't something I'm adept at. But it sounds like a fun project, so I'm definitely not saying no.
---
Cold Case I believe
---
why doesnt the community expect/ demand reimbursement from Bethesda
---
In related news, new Atomic Shop item: 5000 scrip in exchange for only 1000 atoms! ‚Äì ~ ‚Äì ~ ‚Äì Just kidding of course, but can you imagine the outrage that would cause...
---
The "Best" weapon is heavily dependent on your Build, with the best options being Bloodied, or Stealth.
---
A good Bloodied Build with the right Bloodied weapons can deal out some major Damage, but the downside is being unable to take much if any damage themselves.
---
A good Stealth Build with Instigating weapons (My personal Favorite), can also deal out major damage, as long as they're getting the Sneak bonus, if Stealth is broken damage drops significantly, but they can also be Tanky when it comes to resistance.
---
As far as weapons in general, a good Deathclaw Gauntlet with Swing Speed perk is tough to beat up close &amp; personal, and a Good Lever Action with Explosive and/or Vats perks for ranged Attack.
---
Man, first Fasnacht now Arktos... my beautiful, quiet valley is just trampled by tourists.
---
Def not the only, theres 50 posts like this one everytime maintenance happens. No one can give you an exact answer besides 2-3 hours
---
Hurt me more daddy
---
I spawned one at wavy willards car park after 3 load ups. Try there!
---
:(
---
Just get like a chameleon armor right arm or something I love that thing I will never get rid of that.
---
Edit: I think it's the left arm I have.
---
It's only been an hour. Probably another hour .
---
Yeah, good point. But it's literally like a half second to scroll over to your camp. I guess it's just if some forgets to check or doesn't care. And if they dont care a warning wouldn't stop them anyway.  I just know when I got on yesterday I was booted 3 times in the span of 20 min. And at least one of those times someone was at my camp buying.
---
Easily, at one point my security software detected it checking registry keys like the username who is logged into the pc, and the GUID of the machine as well. (its like a mac address i think). im sure it checked other things but i didn't log it down.
---
But assuming these people are selling for real $$ on ebay im sure they can afford a different pc/xbox/whatever to do the crime on. Assuming they don't use a disposable virtual machine. (if pc platform)
---
Best guess is in 2-3 hours, they do take there time with these things, but it's worth it for a more stable game!
---
What platform? I come across the bugger everywhere, if you're on xbox I can probably find him for you
---
Name it 'Anduril' and put it in a vending machine for 200 caps
---
What level are you?
---
Also many people dont want to bother putting on a gas mask just to visit your camp
---
lol yes
---
Ok, thanks. 
---
I sorted by new and didn't see any,  just posts asking when it began
---
Harder to detect while sneaking is a must, and escape artist helps. While they will be hunting for you, they won't actually have detected you yet do if you backpedal you can continue to stealth kill. If I'm careful I can get through West tek without breaking stealth
---
It's a mutation. I don't like to talk about it
---
I ended up just spending the caps and fast traveled to the tourist spawns on 1 server rather than hopping servers in 1 spot..
---
found him at col. kelly.. gl...
---
I see now people will start crying when they don't get an anti armor explosive handmade the day the vendor comes out.
---
Good question! I haven‚Äôt seen level mentioned anywhere.
---
Definitely. I'd rather them taking their time to make sure it's working than to have it back up broken.
---
Well, then guess i die.
---
I've played ~1200h, I've used market for a long time and been sitting on 125k caps and hoarded equipment worth of millions for months. I can't sell equipment cause market is busted. So I just sell ammo/aids if I somehow go under 125k. I was hoping for a way to make my current equipment better. 
---
I got almost everything I wan in gamet but the exact things I'd want are impossible to get, in game or outside of game market.
---
Just an example, I want Max Lvl Heavy Metal Left Leg with Vanguard, Action Point Refresh and etiher cavalier/sentinel/wwr. I tried months on markets and got nothing. I got pieces that are close to it, but not the exact one. The chances to get that piece from legendary vendor seem next to nothing.
---
If the legendary vendor would allow rerolls costing say 100-500 scrips each, I'd love it. That would still mean probably 1000-5000 scrips to get a single roll you want (and you'd need the original piece).
---
It seems to be another rng roulette, and still seems impossible to get what I'm looking for.
---
Reportedly it has to do with whether the owner is "in range" of the vending machine, but I've not replicated that myself.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Good to hear your still playing. I‚Äôm curious as to all the I‚Äôm back posts and then decipher the reason for leaving then reverse the decision.
---
I picked one location and kept server hopping till he spawned. Did whole quest and finding camera in 30 min.
---
slightly longer than the scout challenge crossbow...
---
What challenge is this? Theres certain that do little damage if im not wrong, but worst case just bash the bear lmaooo
---
Sell 3x 3* weapons for 120 scrip and 2x 2* weapons for 30 for the total 150 scrip available per day.
---
Hey nothing wrong with that, and player interactions and community is the whole reason they didn't add human npc's is it not? I feel this would help to actually build a community with the players. :)
---
My PSN: CaptainModrah 
---
I‚Äôd love to stop by!
---
I was told yesterday that my bloodied Mr handy had a nerf so I took it out today and it still shredds like a cornbine harvester so I'm happy.
---
I know I set my kid down for a nap and I want to play. Dad life I'm telling you it's rough.. Good stuff.
---
Or you understand that *it was a fucking typo* and get on with your life.
---
Damage it sufficiently first then use the syringer
---
Maintenance usually lasts until it's over.
---
Disconnects happen! Don‚Äôt let it worry you, plus the patch today hopefully helps. I think checking our camps before logging off has to become second nature from now on as a convince for vending. Just another habit to learn
---
Nice. Been looking for a legendary lever action myself.
---
It would have been cool and an easy way to leave notes if other players could see what you have named items
---
Meanwhile I keep picking up broken deluxe cameras in containers all over the place and have 7 cameras... :(
---
I think it would be cool to continue the story. But how exactly does Bethesda do that if you are low level and haven't finished the quest?  I'm not techie at all so I'm not sure how they would do it.
---
Does the backpack has visual changes when you add other mods (fridge/increased carry weight)?
---
They want an easy way to get a super OP weapon pretty much
---
yup, don't need to be a team / friends, any player will do :)
---
Yea, right when you grab the camera from him the quest starts.
---
I believe the armor effect does stack when it comes to PVE effectiveness, with a full set being equivalent to the mutation's effectiveness, but I've found it gets annoying with it only working when you're standing still.
---
That's why the AGL bonus from unyielding works better for me, but I guess it's really up to personal preference.
---
If you want to go all out, look for unyielding pieces with harder to detect while sneaking, but I think you probably would have capped out your effective sneakiness by then anyway
---
Check the screenshot of items in the players inventory. :)
---
you can mod a normal syringer to a bleed out one as well
---
Also, there's a challenge for the Scouts which requires the use of a syringer to kill a yao guai, this I find is impossible as the syringer is not a weapon that is intended to cause a fatal injury. I'm unable to complete this mission.
---
Oh yea, it's completely illogical.  The reload animation basically assumes gravity stops working for a second.  Still probably my favorite gun in the game though.
---
Honestly that make sense for the name but I really really hope not.
---
Its true. I buy second (red) apocalypse pa paint, but not really enjoy it. After I like how third looking in shop, but i saw it in game on player and was dissapointment.
---
Thats my point
---
I can't speak for everyone else but I know that I try to avoid putting tons of ammo and aid in my stash. I pretty much have all of it in my inventory because of the carry weight reduction perk cards. My stash is mostly junk and unique weapons/armor. I've been managing to stay around 700-750 but I am afraid to horde some extra stuff to sell cuz the stash is gonna be even harder to manage.
---
Even funnier, it's not milk.
---
Blade of Bastet, which is the armor piercing sword. And Voice of Set, which is an anti-robot .44 revolver.
---
Honestly out of all my characters the one that uses that gear is my favorite because 100% armor penetration is just disgustingly good.
---
Good to know that this is the official way to tell people. Thought he was just a naughty badger. I may have to reconsider my pricing when these cases pile up. Thx for the reply
---
Get a 1-star bloodied combat shotgun, put a perforating magazine on it. They're cheap and they wreck everything. You can dump Demo Expert and replace with Gunsmith, plus Nerd Rage if you want to 4-shot rather than 5-shot scorchbeasts.
---
I'm assuming bloodied is now much better than bloodied explosive for shotguns, given the level of complaints. It's either that or people are installing trash barrel mods and trying to hit stuff that's out of range.
---
I know. I'm about to just head a vendor and dump em all. Lol
---
same. i prefer a cool set of vanguard armor and trying to keep myself high. 
---
i have an instagating + SS sledge and an executioner + ss fireaxe. so ill open with the sledge then switch to the executioner.
---
Blade of Bastet(AA Sword), Voice of Set (.44 revolver with shock damage)
---
Each can be crafted at higher levels, one of the materials needed is a version of that item. So to create a level 45 Blade of Bastet, you need some steel, copper, oil, and a blade of bastet. If you got a level 25 one, use that to make a 35 or 45 one. Same with pistol.
---
I just reinstalled it and less than a minute in the 5 minute warning came up. I'm busy for the evening and I have stuff tomorrow so I won't get to play for a while
---
I know I'm the minority.
---
 I'm pleased as pie when the general population DOESN'T READ the objective and just assumes things will work as they expect.
---
Please Bethesda, more of this.
---
How much did all that scrapped junk help with the quest?  
---
I have a group of buddies, and they're all over the shop when we hit the wasteland.    
---
I went to get backpacks with them yesterday, I'm done, one of them still hadnt opened the tadpole quests.  
---
You just gotta focus on your task, not smell the roses (pick up everything) along the way.
---
You can knock the bear down to low low health and pop it with a rad scorpion stinger syringe.
---
When somebody gets a good broadsider......remember me lol
---
I hope you can choose the actual item and not the effects. Probably wishful thinking, cause I already have a ton of 3 star Rolling pins.
---
(https://youtu.be/FbRfv4YksK0)[WHO'S THROWING HANDLES?]
---
I'm that buddy, and while I am grateful my melee can still pound, there is a mutually beneficial relationship between having a range guy and melee guy both able to inflict good damage. 
---
We frequently (almost only) play as a duo, and having his shotgun be able to lay waste when I'm in over my head was very helpful. I often get surrounded and now that melee hits aren't registering every hit again (sweet) I'm often the asshole looking for a stim.
---
also super sledge is far from the best 2 handed melee, a fire axe or normal sledge is way more effecient as the super sledge has no mod and both the axe and normal sledge got armor penetration mods
---
What was the over repair damage buff nerf?
---
It probably possible to lock a game mode to certain quest being finished
---
You cant choose the specific weapon no, just either melee or ranged and then the stars
---
They're actually really good without the legendary effects. I imagine with sentinel or vanguard they'll be pretty fucking legit.
---
Is this sarcasm lol?  Cause they‚Äôve done about 4 major balance adjustments (with more to definitely come) because of legendaries being a problem (because the duping put them all out into the world for a LOT of people to have).
---
It's also my understanding that it's the actual weight number on your armors stats that determine sneak effectiveness. Meaning you could have a "sturdy" piece with the ultra light build mod that could potentially be better to use than a"light" piece without the same mod
---
Big guns
---
I‚Äôve been selling a lot of Brotherhood Knight/Officer underarmor for very cheap (50c - but I see people selling them for 500-1000c on fo76 market) since I have the plans and feel like a lot of people don‚Äôt have it so I want to help them out.  Same for decor plans. 
---
However, some items I have might not be that unique for some but I haven‚Äôt been able to find a lot of them myself so I sell them for a bit more (might seem overpriced for others but there‚Äôs no rush in selling, just looking for someone who really needs it). 
---
I kinda like this ‚Äúnice-to-have (cause its cheap)‚Äù and ‚Äúdamn its expensive but I need it‚Äù balance.
---
Considering I'm responsible for no less than 500 nukes alone, I would say the nuclear winter is a bit late to the party.
---
cheers...... my german is poor, is that 1 ltr of milk ?
---
You can divide a pic into different clickable areas... maybe have it broke down by some like Forrest, mire...etc. 
---
The point being is if you‚Äôre on like Rosie‚Äôs quest, stop here to get part of the atom challenge. This way people won‚Äôt have to go back just for that. 
---
A large part of the community has completed all the quests and working on the challenges. 
---
Doing them together would be an advantage.
---
Found her by accident at Philippi Battle Cemetery yesterday on PC. Can't miss that outfit.
---
(WHO'S THROWING HANDLES?)[https://youtu.be/FbRfv4YksK0]
---
My god... how dare you say nice things about Bethesda!
---
I understand mate, my Quad Explosive Combat shotgun was just a real piece of cake. I'm not spec'd into shotguns, my builds a basic 100% Rifles and carry weight, but I would always use my shotgun in times of need, but when I used it at a simple Yao Guai yesterday, my AAE Handmade did more damage, but if this prevents OP killing in the future of the game and balances it more, I guess it was for the best, and I'm not mad about that.
---
T'was good while it lasted!
---
Its 100 scrip for 3 star roll
---
"Dood, I know a guy who knows a guy. He'll hook you with that sweet mutagenic sauce. There's a finder's fee, of course, but when you're gettin' high in the sky like a damn kangaroo, you won't even care..." :D
---
i wish more people used mic :( 
---
i got a nice saloon now with a shop and i like to give people small custom quests for caps and such but nobody ever talks back
---
Well, there are playable instruments you can add to your camp. Is that what you mean?
---
He could get it too
---
That is not a grind it is stupidity. When you play games like WoW and an item has a .01 drop chance that is grind, what we have right now is a busted system. I have all the items I want including AAE, BE, TSE, and VE lasers, the AA is in case they fix it some day. I have weapons others cant even get and they put out top tier dps. 
---
I got everything i have through trading, I just wish there was a in game solution rather than others having to resort to trade forums like I had to.
---
Some people are so anti-Survival that they won't log onto the server even to complete the easiest weekly Survival challenges. These folks would probably be thrilled to find one in a player vending machine.  Additionally, other players are buying reasonably priced legendaries from player vending so they can scrap them into scrip.  All of the weekly challenge rewards are 3 stars, which mean they are worth 40 scrip at the exchange machine.
---
I'm not sure which scenario the buyer fit, but I sold The Quick Fix within 30 minutes of placing it in my machine last night.
---
Hazmat and PA both ‚Äúcheat‚Äù. 
---
Hazmat has a 90-99% ‚Äúradiation reduction‚Äù effect (think Assassin‚Äôs armor, but radiation).
---
PA has 10-15% rad reduction per piece (same idea; totalling around 75%?).
---
That‚Äôs stacked beyond their numeric radiation resistance. 
---
At least that‚Äôs what i heard from a data miner, but it makes 
---
sense based on how they both behave in game)
---
I‚Äôm super bummed I can‚Äôt play - so that‚Äôs a big compliment to how great the latest release is...
---
*i neeeeeeeed it*
---
It's true, tested it out at someone's camp.
---
Exactly. The same was an issue in guild wars 1 till they realized and separated the skills into PVP and PVE variations. This is a bit more complicated since PVE and PVP are integrated at the same time in this game. 
---
I have hope in the programmers though since they can make this old engine work so well in 76.
---
Take a look at the rewards and if there is any you want to use longer term then leave those till level 50. 
---
Only one I got at max level was All Rise, all the others I got the lower level versions. But I'm fine with that as all I ever use is All Rise. I do carry my Black Diamond always, despite it only being level 35. But i only carry it in case i need an extra bit of carry weight.
---
What about dropping it's health really low first? Theres a lvl 20 something bear by the cemetery which can be sniped from the building
---
Just make it 5000 and be done with it. If you need more than 5000 then you have some problems.
---
you're not very good at math, are you? or more like, dupes have skewed your idea of just how rare these weapons really are. realistically speaking, the vast majority of top/god rolls in the market are dupes. it's still going, btw.
---
chances are you'd never see that roll, not in years. because that's also the chance of rolling a nocturnal +per lead pipe and every other single combination. and the same applies to everyone else.
---
Well I will work and that!
---
Its only dissapointing if you only look for the reddit meta guns and armor.
---
after this deal you should have 2000 more caps to get it out of his inventory
---
just a sad day when my once godly shotgun can be replaced by a 1 star... but certainly looks like that's the way to go!
---
If you are under 25 then yes, my character was born outside, during the chaos of the protests, in a barn. My mother barely escaped with our lives. Fled to a nearby family farm, where a woman found her, during my birth my mother passed away, and this woman took me in as her own, having lost her husband in the chaos of protestors, and strike breakers. After a wile we were granted access to vault 76, it wasn't until my 25th birthday i found any of this out.
---
Offs please no br...however i would hate it less if they did t make it a cash grab for guns and just let you equip what you want beforehand.
---
Curious what platform? Haven't been finding anything this good on xbox
---
I should hope it'll scale to whatever level the player is
---
Didn't New Vegas have some sort of tex mex recipes?
---
Go to the Toxic Valley. Directly south of the "Toxic Lakebed" fast travel location or whatever (where the mire lurk queen spawns in the middle), theres a closed up store building. Jump up on top (theres a convenient fallen tree as a ramp), and have a look around.
---
Whatever kiddo was playing up there was a tad... sadistic.
---
I hope it‚Äôs not true... but if it is, only are lord and savior mothman can save us.
---
Completing quests for the pioneer scouts awarded a few of the bug ones so far.
---
Same here! Makes me wonder if the odds have improved?
---
Where'd you hear that?
---
Also, 4s already do, they come from particular mods.
---
Agreed my team was dropping about 40-60 nukes a week till the imposter came out
---
How many quests do you need for the backpack? Ive no idea what Im actually trying to do here lol..
---
It ends when it ends, go outside for a bit
---
And if that was the case everyone would have fe/be and tse handmades on the first day
---
Well, the Mire spot I had moved to was nice, but it was too dark there, so I went back to the cliffs.  I moved north of where you are now I guess.  I am on top of the first set of cliffs south of where the monorail line curves through the mountains from the elevator.  There  looks to be a Nukashine destination there with a totem setup and a snallygaster spawn just south of me on the cliff edge and I was able to spawn in and out with no problem though.  I am a bit northwest of Fort Defiance.  So far it looks okay up there.
---
I did that one time I go to login and couple minutes later... server shutting down in 5 minutes. I was a little sad not going to lie.
---
You sound very triggered, ive found more than good enough weapons without duping
---
Well, At least you didn't have to deal with people not activating the pylons
---
Found my camera first try at the wavy Willards water park north in Appalachia... the tourist was sitting next to a car in the parking lot ... there is only like 4-5 vehicles so it's easy to see if it's there... if not reload
---
Yes! This! Passive perks should be more of a skill check. Can this player maneuver there cards to unlock a level three lock? If so just let them unlock the damm box. I dont even bother picking locks cause I'm to lazy switch my perk cards around for crap prizes.
---
would have been great to know beforehand that this was going to happen though.
---
Marsupial Serum for 250 caps lmao
---
No I read what you said, but you also said in your first sentence ‚Äúfast travel doesn‚Äôt always work‚Äù 
---
I read that you traveled to the closet location and walked. I‚Äôm glad you realized you could do that. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is there is no need to pick someone‚Äôs locks, you can just fast travel to the closet location and walk.
---
Browse? Probably around 5-10%.
---
Players who look up info in search function once in a while or go on day of a patch, much higher.
---
Now if look at very active players v weekend warriors I would spitball that a high percentage of very active players browse.
---
server stability i think
---
Just get the animal to low health with any other weapon and finish it off with the syringer. Shoot it or use it to bash it to death, whatever. It is the final blow that counts.
---
I thinks its equal to your level now and amax of 50 caps
---
Then you can either sell that to someone else for caps or trade it back in to recover some of your scrip. I'm just glad that we have a use for junk legendaries now. It's better than nothing but doesn't give away the farm completely.
---
I‚Äôm loving that I can carry 385 on an unmodded backpack. The small things that they put in can be a very nice item to have. I was worried that it would be big and bulky but it actually doesn‚Äôt look bad. Looks like a mildly filled rucksack from my army days.
---
I got almost everything I want in game but the exact things I'd want are impossible to get, in game or markets outside of the game.
---
It seems to be another rng roulette, and still seems impossible to get what I'm looking for. I was hoping for more of an end game kinda trader, not a mid game trader.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, found it earlier today.
---
I have almost every version of explosive lasers in the game bud, I am just trying to help others out and make it so people dont have to depend on trade forums. 
---
If you want to complete my collection tho I am still looking for a nocturnal explosive and a medics explosive laser or ultracite laser.
---
We have no way of knowing until we can test it ourselves.
---
THAT'S IT! I'M DONE!  BETHESDA, YOU NEED TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE!!!! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Speak for yourself lol I WANT A LEGENDARY DRILL!!
---
Ah, just karma whoring then, I get it.
---
I don't think any of the, enter trade &gt; now the weapon i was carrying is gone were ever proven. I have traded a bunch of times, since those posts were made and I never lost an item from my inventory. Trading however, is kind of a pain when you don't do it often as you try to figure out the UI as some players will get impatient and just cancel the trade. (or maybe they are confused too and cancel because of that).
---
Tell me a better way, and not one that involves you getting all the god roll items on day one
---
I would hope they'll scale to your level!
---
My .50 cal loves when i farm ammo, but i agree, less bullets spent means more time for other things.
---
Thanks for the story... if only this was the way it happen without the jerks lol. What you tell is the FUN of PVP, maybe if they did a start from level 1, EVEN if you got to keep gear but have to do everything else, the mode would be less "jerky" not sure because of the Dupe items but I would like to try it and see how it works.
---
Considering most legendary runs I do don't I don't even get a 3*, much less a 3* for what I'm using (it's usually a switchblade or something), this allows you 1-2 potential 3* a day, which is a huge improvement for legendary farming.
---
10% chance to contract on eating haha
---
Can you imagine Taco Bell in the wasteland?  IDGAF, i'd still try it.
---
Oh yeah they're pretty good for sure! I mean I'm not complaining that they're not legendary. My protocoled T-51 performs quite nicely for me.
---
Vanguard and Sentinel could be good effects, but I'm quite happy with the already datamined "Unbreakable" and "Light" effects, but if a effect to reduce explosion damage would be added, I'd be grinding for that sort of thing XD
---
Yep, that's me when I'm playing Adventure.
---
You‚Äôre looking at breaking the game at that point. With how many legendaries are in the game and how many people have been hoarding, you‚Äôd be able to reroll indefinitely and there would be no trade system anymore. I personally like the direction that they went for because it gives meaning to trash legendaries and people who complain about the queen, can now do something else for legendaries.
---
Interesting, might have to spend some time using small letters in my camp to manually describe some of my 3 star items for now hah.
---
It would be cool if the new personal terminals played games.
---
Back in my day we had a 400 limit‚Ä¶
---
I think the roll chance will probably be the same as usual. Their goal seems to be to balance all legendary features against each other, so I doubt they'd change the RNG to make any of them less likely than they already are. You still have a pretty slim chance of getting a god roll item. It's still like getting a jackpot in a slot machine.
---
I agree
---
The quickest way I've found is to pull it back into your inventory from the vending machine and reprice unfortunately.
---
I've never seen the appeal of gambling, so I guess the fun of a grab-bag is lost on me.
---
You can get Brahmin if you put down the brahmin pen resource
---
I agree.
---
We can surpress a revolver but not an SMG?
---
Did you check to see if it only had one utter to yank on?
---
Friend and I both couldn't play before the servers went down. He couldn't even get the launcher to open while I couldn't stay connected for more than a couple seconds. So seems they were having some serious issues which necessitated the unannounced maintenance.
---
Makes sense.
---
Boys SOUL! It‚Äôs SOUL! Stop saying boys hole!
---
good luck.
---
oh, had scorchbeast spawn up there close to the mast.
---
maybe I should just shut up.
---
This ain‚Äôt it chief. I‚Äôm just a big fan of food/a cooking buff since they‚Äôre low (high) key Morrowind potions. More options is the Free Market.
---
I think it would be better if you could find plans, via quests, for specific potted planters that could grow rarer plants, with separate plans for each type of plant .  Maybe as as possible rewards for beating whatever boss is in the bottom of Vault 94.
---
I did it out of habit when I rebuilt mine. Locked the shutters and everything, despite setting up vault boy cutouts all pointing to my vending. I mean, I made a nice little porch with seating and a punch bowl (that I'm not sure how to fill), a sleeping bag, radio, and extra stash box. 
---
... And I just realized something. Could those accidentally locked doors potentially deter people from visiting? Does it notate a locked C.A.M.P. somehow? I haven't been able to play since Tuesday and won't be able to until my kids are no longer sick.
---
Can't be worse than iguana bits
---
Gotcha, I'm assuming a ranged build? Are you planning on using mutations?
---
At the very least, I would recommend using the 3 unused point in PER for Tank Killer, at 3‚òÜ it gives 36% armor piercing, and 6% stagger chance. PER also affects your VATS range.
---
They are indeed, bug fixes.
---
This. People are too used to games handholding them and babysitting them. I LIKE that ‚Äò76 makes you pay attention and be engaged.
---
You can suppress a revolver??? Totally didn't know that either!
---
I haven‚Äôt thought of this, but my camp is conveniently located near Vault 76. Should cost 2 caps at most to fast travel to me from there
---
still cost 60
---
I played close to 150 hours from launch till February then took a break. 
---
Dc's were every 4-5 hours, not 30 seconds.
---
I came back last night and played for 3 hours, no dcs.  Not 30 seconds.
---
Never in all of my playtime have i ever dc'd that often and never had bethesda targetted a bug like that because it's client side.
---
Yes thats also my solution currently.
---
Huh. I copy/pasted it on my phone. I get log in buttons but can still see the post. Not sure what I did different. 
---
Anyway, as of two minutes ago it was still down, though the message box in the upper right of ther FO76 main menu had changed from"server maintenance" to"ever upwards".
---
Yeah instead of end game trader we got mid game trader.
---
Meh. It's a shame they're not learning. Elder Scrolls Online devs figured out that giving players the ability to transmute traits, which requires crystals, which drops only from final bosses/dailies/etc., wasn't a bad idea. Diablo 3 devs figured out that giving players the ability to reforge their gear wasn't a bad idea either. The Division devs figured out that it's not a bad idea to let people recalibrate the talents on their gear. And so on. Bethesda? Nah, Bethesda has a full-on RNG boner. See a doctor!
---
Tarberries!
---
Yes  I thought it was just me.
---
What?
---
they tolerate till certain degree, otherwise, they wouldn't post a twitter saying that using some mods was causing a bug were you fall from the terrain in a loop some patches ago.
---
good will or not wanting to get more bad press? that's up to you to interpret
---
still pc isn't everything that people play, there are people on console that can't use mods, and they deserve a better QOL changes. This is indeed needed
---
Since when are the servers down? Just got home to play, and found them offline.

Woaaah nice weapons, and great tactic! I have a couple berserkers and Bloodied, plus that Instigating rolling pin, but honeslty the two Melee weapons I find me using the most is a Bloodied Bowie Knife and Ghoul slayers SS (can't remember thrid star) Mole Miner gauntlet, it ain't the best, but hell does it clear Whitesprings or the burrows out pretty well!
---
Those were tough times my friend.
---
I think it's fine the way it is, just the other effects need to be brought up. The effects that do extra damage to a mob type should be bumped to at least 50% I'd gladly carry multiple weapons for more.damage to a mob type like that.
---
You could copy / paste this answer to every single stash limit though. 400? Having a little boost would be nice. I‚Äôd finally be able to horde a bit extra. That would finally help me. 600? Having a little boost would be nice. I‚Äôd finally be able to horde a bit extra. That would finally help me. 800? Having a little boost would be nice. I‚Äôd finally be able to horde a bit extra. That would finally help me. 1000? Having a little boost would be nice. I‚Äôd finally be able to horde a bit extra. That would finally help me.  
---
What do you have in your STASH that takes up al the space where you can‚Äôt sell much of anything?
---
Server hop.
---
Unless you‚Äôre super low level and/or you have bad weapons and armor playing that solo is perfectly fine. I do a run through there daily and have 0 trouble. You don‚Äôt need to be 2+ for the burrows
---
Humm ok, thx for the info. I will try laser and cal.12 and make some test with the terminal.
---
I got the kill, I made a bleed out syringer- I‚Äôm not sure if the direct damage got sit or the bleed damage did, but it worked.  Has anyone gotten the Chemist syringer challenges to work? I‚Äôm wondering if i need a basic syringer, not a modded on.
---
The difference in pricing between CAMPs is really amazing. Literally thousands of caps difference in asking prices. 
---
I had never seen the White Wolf Fedora until a player‚Äôs vending machine. They wanted 500c. Nah. Went to train station and it was for sale for 29c from a responder vendor. Sheeesh.
---
If you need more than 800 you have a problem lol
---
Then I think it's time for you to quit. If you need everything handed to you, this type of game is not the game for you.
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
Oh okay well where can I find that many brahmin?
---
Returning to my CAMP to find all the doors wide open is a pet peeve of mine. I like to keep things unlocked so people can explore and use the facilities, but I've taken to locking some doors to save myself the frustration. 
---
The only door I leave unlocked is the front one, and only because CAMP spawning is messed up and people usually end up arriving via the floor, so I have to unlock the door to let them out. I wish they'd make all doors auto-close after a while, even if it was a minute or two (as opposed to the seconds that the powered doors offer).
---
I actually saw a literal Taco Bell camp on Xbox the other day - it was a sick set up and I really loved it.
---
I'd rather it wasn't like that.  The only way I can fast travel is to drop in all my weight reduction cards which means when I arrive I have to put all my melee cards back in.  I spent the majority of the game running place to place and have only been able to get into events because I can switch.  So I'd rather have a way to switch quicker even if it was to go into the screen and just hit one button versus the take out 5 cards put in 7 that occurs currently.
---
The maintenance was communicated on several channels (Twitter, Beth forums,... ) and if I'm correct even in the game and it's launcher a couple of hours before. 
---
And no, there is no ETA. Never was.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they implement more for the personal terminal. It‚Äôs much easier to start small and build up vs. put a lot of craziness in there and find out that the majority of fan hate it. I like it because I suck at remembering to do dailies. Yet I can never remember where they are anyways. Embarrassing to say from someone who‚Äôs over 300 and has multiple characters rang in between 95 and 155.
---
The brahmin's name is Norman.  You were pulling on his dick.
---
Thank you, that is helpful :)
---
But it‚Äôs raining out.
---
Give me the chimichangas!!!
---
Not to mention pieces like that are as rare as hen's teeth :)
---
Makes most sense for me to go 4 Unyielding and 1 Chameleon piece at the moment, I think.
---
I wouldn't skip any quests, they help you discover all different areas for fast traveling &amp; give decent exp. Yea some are better then others.. for fast leveling. Make sure take naps when you first log in for bonus exp. Get cranberry cobbler &amp; relish recipes and make/eat them for bonus exp buff. 
---
I recommend areas with lots of enemies, killing enemies is by far fastest way to gain exp. Ex.. west tech, whitespring, cranberry bog areas
---
This.... took me 2 server hops to get mine here; you basically spawn in and it will be a short jog right in front of you if he is there - if not, rinse/repeat.
---
Agree, especially now with player vending. Would be nice to have an extra 200lb to sell heavier legendaries.
---
there's a bunch of new issues I've noticed since the latest patch. Hopefully they're fixing some of them.
---
Flatwoods. 3 every time.
---
Wow that a list! For how many bolts?
---
I wish we could set a LF and buy option.....like I post I'm willing to buy any and all fusion cores for 20 caps, max spending 200 caps.
---
HuuuuuH!!! Only the RNG Gods can acquire such a weapon, i's too strong!! But the one to top that is a...
---
***l e g e n d a r y    f l a r e     g u n***
---
They should put an effect in there that if you milk a male named Brahmin, they kick you in the chest, drop your armor condition by 25% and launch you across the map. Like with the camera bug.
---
A new duping trick popped up yesterday on YouTube so it may have been to patch that.
---
An interesting point, but I don't think that turning 2/3 good stars into 3/3 good stars would be game-breaking. I don't think it would be preventing trade system from existence. On the contrary, now we have two tiers of items. Good items and shitty items. What I'd love would make that three tiers. Good items, items that could be good, and shitty items.   
---
Anyway, thank you for your response.
---
I honestly thought to myself "What in the actual fuck... I found 2 out in the world. I must be the luckiest guy in the world!"
---
... Then I saw this post and now I feel bad. Just glad I found the camera guy the other day at the Water Park.
---
Ive managed to rig mine up to a trip wire so it only goes off if something enters my camp, i can make it hostile only or all players and monsters will trigger it. 
---
But i suppose you could get the effect you want if you put the trips around the camp in a ring and hide it with foliage and essentially it would go off anytime an enemy entered turret range. though i guess youd still have to turn it off manually by re-arming the trips via terminal all the time.
---
Just consider it to be a rad storm and its survival training...go forth vault dweller!
---
Yeah the gang busters habits are going to be hard to break :P
---
Brilliant info man, thanks for taking the time :)
---
ah, that makes sense. i'm from Italy and here you really have to search foreign stuff on your own, so i never heard of it before. thanks for gifting me a little bit more knowledge
---
This is like the sixth post about it.
---
They introduced a game stopper which needs to be fixed yes or yes. I wonder if thats the 1\* Legendary Script thing.
---
I agree with raimbaal. As much as I was wanting a reroll and star adding option, essentially building your own legendary weapon would result in an unbalanced game (more so than it already is).
---
Just hop around doing every event. The rewards will cover fast travel costs easily, you get lots of aid items, and tons of XP because most involve lots of kills plus the quest rewards. Plus it‚Äôll get you lots of explored locations. Once you hit 50 you‚Äôre golden to go do all the quests. 
---
Mistress of mystery is safe to do tho
---
I concur. My bloodied shotgun when I'm at 20% HP does over 600 damage. With Bloody Mess maxed one shot lvl 68 mutants.
---
Seems like an hour and roughly 20min. Hotpatches seem to take less time than scheduled updates, so maybe they'll be back soon.
---
Oui, they're down for maintenance!
---
Took me 3 server hops at the Miners Memorial, the tourist spawns on the stairs right by the monument.
---
They wear bright clothing (mine had clearly been to Nuka-World) so you cant miss it
---
I met another player at spruce knob lake and neither of us had mics. I saw they were doing the swimming challenge and gave them the come here emote. 
---
Once he came over I jumped up on the building near the start and jumped high off (marsupial)into the shallows and asked for a revive. Gave the thumbs up and they went and did the exact same.
---
They went down for maintenance around 11 AM eastern
---
Thanks for being civil to the response. We won‚Äôt know how good or bad it is until it comes. I just hope that it‚Äôs not like the monster mash where I farm up 5k candy and get a wood leg.
---
Well, shit. Thank you, that changes things :)
---
How many pieces of harder to detect would you recommend? These will be pieces I'll need to search for upgrades for.
---
There doesn't seem to any harm in increasing it, the servers aren't running any worse than they were with the 400 weight limit. And with all the new updates adding in new weapons and outfits it's hard to make room.
---
I'm sad because I had a TSE harpoon gun, didn't know how good it was until like the week before they nerfed it. Was like shit I didn't get to is it much.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I forgot to mention that I never use PA... so I have no idea if any of that info applies in it.
---
Have several of these, I am sure I can slot one into my suit somewhere :)
---
I love that they named her that since she is a mole miner. The reason it is random is because she can't understand you and you can't understand her. You probably point at something on the Wall and she hands you something different. After several minutes of futile attempts to explain that you want a bloodied faster swing speed plus strength death claw gauntlet, you just accept the fact your leaving with a stalkers better blocking plus charisma walking cane. You give up and walk away.
---
i had about 10k .38 rounds sitting in my stash so I built a .38 auto "the fixer" and i absolutely love it. so i started to sell them it my store for 500 caps for the base model.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for it. That‚Äôs when players are supposed to be able to go in legendary mode and supposedly get more powerful perk options. Of course, this is all tentative because they either come up with a better idea or they want to tweak it.
---
Somehow even if the doors are closed and locked, and even in rooms that are closed off, the critters still manage to get in. I've seen them munching on my fusion generator a couple times now even though that area is completely closed off with no doors or windows... I dunno if players closing the doors will make a big difference haha.
---
Tex-Mex should increase your AP as gas or toxic gas as a mutation or weapon like robobrains let‚Äôs out...lol
---
I server hopped at Flatwoods and I got it - I think sometimes if someone milked them already it takes a while to milk them again. I got it after like 2-3 hops I think because there's like 7-8 Brahmin throughout the town.
---
I just logged in now, so it appears to be over.
---
Hey thanks! I searched around a few times and this one never came up. I'll keep these handy.
---
radiated farts?
---
Does anyone know what this was addressing?
---
Honestly it's the best way they could've handled this without it being another thing everyone is going to server hop for
---
I'd recommend making stuff like Grilled Radstag because more carry weight is always great, especially for your Level 1 grandbabies.
---
Really what is it
---
The one to rule them all, b i g   i r o n
---
How does one get the personal terminal?
---
There are actually more than 3 - there are some behind the church and behind the tavern and in the field as well.
---
Bethesda can we have a complete game please.
---
Updated OP. Apparently my iPhone deleted a big chunk of that post.
---
Are they bug fixes or as the server room finally gave up as it was crashing every 15 minutes yesterday ü§£
---
Luckily i have weapons i need, rng hates me
---
Come back here in a few weeks, when you get three Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Guns from her in a row.
---
That should not be the case. Same level/mods? You 100% sure about that?
---
The caps at the end was the icing on the cake.  LOL
---
\*muffled cheek pinching\*
---
\*muffled encouragement to finish your soup and bundle up\*
---
\*muffled hints about grandchildren\*
---
Seems for me that it just finished.
---
Maintenance is over now! :)
---
This is a great post. For sure I will need to actually learn the stealth methodology, and that WILL be a learn for me because I've never played this way before.
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
I noticed that there is a lot faster loading after fast travel now.
---
I didn‚Äôt learn then and now I‚Äôm maxed at 800...lol
---
Yep. Excellent gun at level
---
It‚Äôs been on the open screen before you log in to the game. Top right corner. Hard to miss
---
It says it in the top right hand corner every time. No one bothers to read it.
---
Fair, I don't consider Skyrim a sandbox game because of the nature of the main story but there is admittedly no one official definition. For me, sandbox games can include structured elements but they should be ignorable. Outward is a great example of what I consider a sandbox to be.
---
Let's not forget that the legendary loot pool is still bugged from the games launch. We may end up getting drills, syringers, and one star wood armor from the Purveyor.
---
!!!
---
But what about a....
---
***B B     G U N***
---
Whoops, I meant the urban scout armor. Power armor doesn't need to be legendary, that would be fucking excessive.
---
Chameleon armor it is then, the invisible while shooting is essential to me. Thank you VERY much!!
---
Everyone wants new content and stuff to do... now we have stuff to do and we actually have to grind and nobody wants to put In the work lol I‚Äôm happy with how it is! It‚Äôs not so stagnant now and we actually have a purpose
---
5k candy for a wood leg is a prime example of terrible RNG in action. Worked hard, got nothing back, very inspiring.
---
It's back online now!
---
It's two equal projectiles with 125% total damage, at least in the data files. Might be an ugly hack in the game code that treats the projectiles differently, but I'd be surprised.
---
Ahaaaaa! This is KEY info for me. Thank you so much!!
---
I'm about 90% sure!
---
&gt;2.game feels like it‚Äôs stuck in a gear, makes an annoying sound , then restarts the game after a minute
---
Ahh, that grinding wirring ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR noise, and everything locks up on the screen?  That's about the only disconnect I'll get, and it always happens after I've been playing for a few hours and got myself set up well in the world.  ugh.  I hate that noise.  First gen XBONE for reference.
---
They are already in the game. Look at any legendary. There are 5 stars that get filled in.. we only have up to 3
---
Servers are down for maintenance.
---
Game is back up on ps4
---
I found out 3 mins before when the 5 minute warning went out.  Lol was building away and boom!  But I don't pay much attention to the feeds.
---
I'm 99% sure that it's going to be a random 3 star legendary from every category. It's probably going to be the best option, atleast imo.
---
The ability to track challenges is great though, now I know right away if things are working or not. Love starting a ‚Äúkill 76 scorched with x weapon‚Äù and getting the happy atom banner countdown.
---
I just stroll by some of the glitched locations and, someday, the banner will slide out :)
---
The first vendor CAMP I went to, I took a tour of the place. Checked out their impressive Deathclaw easter egg display. Although the Camp had all these Keep Out and No tresspassing sogns, kinda giving out a mixed message lol.
---
It‚Äôs sneaky, but I like it. Downside is there wasn‚Äôt really any heads up that it was a unique, so that was an unpleasant surprise. Still is an interesting twist though. Worst case I‚Äôll just make a new toon and then drop the gun off at a friend to hold while I swap.
---
Maybe they‚Äôll fix the vending glitch where when you add a piece to sell, you can‚Äôt scroll anymore.
---
I'm on PC, sorry!
---
Oh man. You‚Äôve been banned. That sucks
---
It‚Äôll be trial and error. It will either become a hit or it will fail. I think it will be determined off of cost, chances and if they add more to it. I‚Äôd love to pay scrips for legendary mods. Obviously have a tier system in which you may mix and match but there‚Äôs a limit by a point factor to be able to add certain things. Like if I wanted a bloodied executioner weapon, that should either not be allowed or make it where you‚Äôre not getting any other perks on it. I‚Äôd love to see people‚Äôs creativity on what they would add, within a realistic aspect if they could customize a legendary.
---
Just wait out the Maintenance and you‚Äôll be good to go.
---
It doesn't say it right now...
---
I won't be wearing it for this iteration of my build, but I'll miss it I think :) It's just so ridiculously convenient.
---
Well lookie there !
---
I never mentioned any bugs. Bobby pin weight and scrapping bulk are not bugs. They are QOL. Getting killed and having your best weapon disappear when you respawn is a bug. Picking up a weapon you have searched for then fast traveling to camp to fix/upgrade it only to find it's not in inventory is a bug. Invisible players is a bug. Those are some of the worst I have seen. Worst part is Bethesda fails to acknowledge problems like these exist except for the invisibility which may have been fixed.
---
I think we discovered that we can't, because the item generation is completely server side. Some people have tested huge amounts of legendary drops, and definitely saw trends in the effects they got. I used to keep a list and it showed way more of some effects than others. Some of the data people got suggested it also depends per server instead of per player or globally, but there are global trends too - most people get to level 100 without ever seeing a tse weapon. I didn't even find a two shot at all until level 112
---
You got one? or did you complete the whole challenge?
---
I say yes. Bethesda has added so much and fixed so much that it makes the game even better to play. However, I‚Äôd look at other people‚Äôs opinions as well so you can get a better idea.
---
Normally two-shot has the extra 25% damage quoted in the pip-boy. Sure you didn't forget the receiver mod, and they're the same level?
---
Could be just a little bit deadpool? It‚Äôs Just a tadpool.
---
We only have two bosses though and people already have them on super farm status
---
Yeah, something. I mean, basically no one worries with much aid and after a point no one cares about junk. And some folks do already zero their caps.
---
Something in the middle would be nice.
---
Nobody believes your made up hypothesis without a shred of evidence to back it up? I'm shocked.
---
Worse than what the YouTube ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù said? Is that even possible ?
---
No the banned code is 4:8:2000
---
The legendary vendor will eliminate a lot of the RNG.  
---
1. The star level
---
2. The item type (melee, range, armor)
---
Half the problem in legendary farming was getting an actual 3 star item to drop.  This should help significantly!  It still doesn't say if the item level is randomized though....hopefully you can pick the level ranges.  Either way it could screw the buyer. Let's say you are level 60 and want a max level gun and get a level 15. Or vice-a-versa.
---
 I'm kinda hoping that it gets addressed during the hotfix today.
---
Maybe not off the candy but I got a lot off of the guaranteed legendaries that have spawned in there.
---
It‚Äôs always been good.
---
Players: I can't compete against those godroll wielding people who played since beta, please remove their characters from being able to play survival so I could play fair  
---
Also Players: Please don't let people work for the gear that they need. Give them random stuff instead. This will be balanced.
---
Always thought it was weird that a player can run and jump weighing 1200 pounds without PA...
---
üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Yea? Do it daily. Only bug with Tesla‚Äôs we‚Äôre the crash they would cause.
---
I may be a tard! I'll check when I get home!
---
If I ever see any level 1 grandkids at the vault, I'm usually waiting with a care package ready to go. Either there or at the Overseers camp. Grilled Radstag would be perfect for that!
---
Gimme gimme all ,now!
---
They seriously thought beth was about to give the ability to mod whatever you want how you want?
---
I was hoping for a daily list of random legendary but even this mistery method is good. I get random 3 stars everyday anyway, buying 1 won't change anything to me...and it's a good thing.
---
How long is the maintenance
---
I was just messing with you lol. It‚Äôs just down for maintenance
---
Oh should most definitely give it a try. Not only have the fixed a lot of the bugs from when the game originally came out but all DLC is free and a new Legendary Vendor is coming soon. I‚Äôm a diehard Fallout fan and I play this on a daily basis.
---
Now I'm gonna have to server hop for 8 hours today lol
---
There's an empty bottle in the wagon.
---
&gt; not having to worry about anything other then your task.
---
This is what I want, precisely. I mean, I'd like to learn the sneak playstyle, but I also want to be effective while I learn it :P
---
Them 3*s don't find themselves! :P
---
I'm pretty sure there will never be 5 star items, as most 3 star shit is broken enough anyways. Besides, well, if they nerf most of the stuff or 5 star stuff being only dropped by actual endgame bosses.
---
It‚Äôs back up now
---
At lest in the vendor you chose what type of item, like range weapon or armor. But it wont be that much more different seeing the huge variety out there for al items are.
---
Having tested it, it does power up but its damage is still terrible. Barely usable against level 20 enemies so no point against 50+
---
Read the replies to all the people that ask this every damned day
---
Same here, it's either a body shot or head shot with mine on ghouls and scorched to do decent damage but no where near what it used to. I ran into a group of mutants and they actually killed me! I couldn't do enough damage with my double barrel to end them first. There is really no point to the explosive effect anymore. Yes it will give you a 20% boost, but there are way better options now. I stand a better chance with my Ghoul slayers \*\* combat shotgun at WS now. RIP
---
I'm using the sliding doors with the code lock myself, then just wiring up the floor switches on both sides, so I can run up and stand on it and then run through, and it automatically closes behind me. 
---
I have never seen a mole rat or scorched trigger those floor switches, but I set them back and to the side just in-case.
---
Wrong they are online right in this moment
---
That‚Äôs exactly the problem.  Requests for information on anything relating to suspension is ignored or answered with a generic statement which answers nothing. One of their patches even admitted in the patch notes that folks were getting these suspensions from picking up loot bags.
---
I‚Äôve done that withy lower level character.
---
I've played since beta, and still get melted in pvp. I actually kind of with there was a set damage all players inflict...
---
It was on the game's title screen last night.
---
I for one welcome my new mole grandmother
---
Made a post a week or so ago and this could have all been done on our workbenches without all the extra coding for a mole miner.
---
My vision was this......
---
You break down legendaries on your workbenches. If you broke down 5 bloodied weapons you would earn five legendary flux of "bloodied". If two of them had swing speed you now have two legendary flux of "swing speed" in addition. 
---
Once you reach 10 of a certain legendary flux you can add to any weapon you have the plan for. 
---
So now I have 10 bloodied and 10 swing speed legendary fluxed. I go to my weapon bench and I have the plans to make a sledgehammer.  I make a 50 and in the mods table I have the ability to make it a Bloodied Sledgehammer with swing speed. If I decide a bloody build isn't my thing I can then remove the mod and add 10 anti armor legendary flux.
---
This won't help if they need certain rolls but it would help if you decide tou rather play as a different type of character downstream.
---
*I was walking near this place when I see a shadowy figure in the alleyway. I investigate and Todd Howard springs out. I am now trapped, I can go nowhere. I must face this monster.*
---
*He starts mumbling something about "infinite quests" and refunds. His shape contorts into an abomination. Most likely due to the lack of bug testing. I step back in horror. He lunges at me, yelling "BUY MY GAMES! BUY MY GAMES!" in a shrieking yet emotionless voice. "No!" I cry. I will not give in to his money-lust.*
---
*Todd Howard looks visibly angry, "It just works... IT JUST WORKS!!!" he screams as he pounces on me, with his bony hands smelling of Nuka Dark rum and money.*
---
*I wake up in my bed, sweating cold bullets. Just another nightmare. But I feel something in my coat pocket. I reach in to find a fresh copy of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Signed just from him.*
---
I did this both times I've done the quest.  I think today I'll stash all the junk I want to keep, dump the rest in the blue suitcase at the Whitespring Station, travel there completely empty and resist the urge to pick up extra junk while collecting bug bits.
---
FYI...choose to collect meat last.  I got DCed yesterday and my radroach meat spoiled on me at the last minute.
---
To make the quest a bit less fast-travely and stay in the Mire, Big Maw often has a grab-bag of bloodbugs/stingwings/bloatflies.  Southampton Estate always has 2-3 bloodbugs and one bloatfly.  Crevasse Dam has a couple bloatflies swimming around the side of the dam facing the road.  There's always 2-3 radroaches at Camp Venture, where you turn in technical data.  I forget if you need a tick blood sac, but there's usually a mess of them in the tall grass around Dolly Sod's.  Treehouse Village always has three glowing Stingwings.
---
It's easier to sell those extra junks to get the money back...
---
Why would they wan't to do that? Repair kits would be sitting at a 1.
---
Don't think of it as a "tax" what it really is you paying the "Mysterious Stranger" that revive and or Kills people for you, HE is the Fast travel guy as well... big B just didn't want to let his day job secret out of the bag.
---
Yeah, I have been fast traveling back to my CAMP and making sure no one is around waiting or using my vendors, so I can tell them I'm about to log out so they can finish their selection.
---
Some dwellers do not have doors, or walls for that matter.  Might want to open them privileged peepers of yours and gain some perspective.
---
Nice. Time to roll out a new toon! Thanks!
---
They actually serve as a fertilizer producer, so in your camp build menu the icon looks like a wheelbarrow
---
I would like 1000 to be even but it's pretty manageable right now with 800.
---
Had you managed to offer before I came up with a name for it, I would actually have given it to ya. But that would have only happened if you were online with chatmod updated last night. RIP
---
Lol we can almost carry as much as we can stash.
---
That's too much work.
---
I'll just stick with my 236, lol
---
Amazing
---
Those arent udders those are mutated brahmin penises.
---
At first glance, I thought you left your talk to text on and accidentally posted it.
---
So you crafted a new one?  Much better than the one they give you.  Just making sure.
---
Okay awesome! I'll get milking once the servers go back up!
---
PC, sorry. If its any consolation I dont plan to sell or scrap it
---
Understandable, enjoy it!
---
Ermagerd! Murmrgh!
---
So they know how to guarantee  3 stars legendaries, they could put this in the SBQ loot table too ;)
---
Do both!
---
Where you do find a guitar? I've found a guitar sword and banjo but I can't remember where for the life of me.
---
And turn off the radshower when you're done - you're killing me with this water bill!
---
Also have you done the quests from Lowe's Taxidermy?  You get plans for mounted taxidermy heads as rewards for completing them.
---
As soon as server maintenance ends :D
---
Dude, both female and male have horns. Only females have udders. So I know exactly what it means. It's a she.
---
Do the challenges
---
I mean honestly.....how different is it from having robots in the game that talk?  They could just bring in different random encounters that progress the story a little through lore.  Then start adding quests and events.
---
Many WS ghouls carry them. Makes sense though, poor tourist were happily snapping right before the flash.
---
And I always thought Mole Miners we're so grumpy because they weren't getting laid. Good to hear there are Minerettes!
---
Well that's that - now we know the details.  Yet more RNG badness.  Disappointed for sure, but not surprised in the least.  When they said you "buy" the legendaries I knew well enough to set really low expectations.
---
I kill every pet Brahmin I find
---
Oh yeah I know I tried it but I kept getting disconnected after server hopping a couple times and idk what toll the servers have when a bunch of people keep hopping in the same place and all their stuff has to load in and I just bring up the enclave events because I think it kind of goes with the scout and patriotism theme and I think it would be easier on the servers since they are al ready programed in and you don't have to jum and I mean no one really does them so why not
---
Make some White Russians while you're at it!
---
And while you're at it, maybe DON'T shoot my cow?
---
Use your old one unless you like walking and rediscovering all the locations.
---
If they are random levels rather than player level, there will be a lot of angry customers. I hope she has security! At least with legendary enemies you can see their level and therefore what level gear you're likely to get.
---
I reckon maybe they will return. Fasnacht was a fun event but people do have duplicate plans still out there to trade or buy. Just they will become limited. Given that it's an annual event in Helvetia it would be nice if it happened next spring but that is a while away. üòÖ
---
I wish you could convert crafted items into random legendry's. So if you want one specific item you can take it in and just roll the dice for effects, most effects are pretty bad.
---
23 one star effects
---
9 two star
---
7 three star
---
There are 1242 different three star effect combinations, so the odds of getting any one in specific is very rare. Being able to at least choose what gun you get would be nice.
---
Yeah, that's the point I was making. It removes a couple of layers of RNG, which makes a big difference, but it's still a huge pool of random you're selecting from.
---
Ranged still includes Pistol, Rifle, Laser, Plasma, Heavy, Shotgun, Explosive, etc.
---
Melee includes fist, 1h, 2h.
---
Armor includes all types (leather/raider/combat, etc) and variations (light/sturdy/heavy), and slots (arm, leg, chest).
---
And then from there it's still random Primary/Secondary/Tertiary legendary effects.
---
now just a thought, you might want to google "summerset spiecial",its far better, I cant remember how I got it tho. Even the voice of set didn't do what it said on the tin. The wotoga robots can attest to that.
---
still got mine,but ps4, otherwise if you were going to give it a good home.............
---
Just because there's slots doesn't mean there's a whole list of properties to draw from. This is exactly my point, there are already mods that fill in the fourth star, and I'm guessing it'll just be another mod that fills a slot when we finally see a five star.
---
There is exactly zero reference I can find anywhere of Bethesda saying there'd be a whole new tier of legendaries at some point, not even a shred of evidence from datamining. So don't expect it to happen and make everything else pale in comparison, because there's no evidence of that other than you seeing some empty slots and saying "this must be for the real good stuff later".
---
Most sought after weapon is probably a bloodied explosive handmade with decreased vats ap usage.
---
I personally am a fan of bloodied and vampire's. Vampire's can be run like a bloodied build but sacrifices the extra bloodied damage for increased survivability. My Vamp auto handmade keeps me topped off at 20% hp no matter how nasty things get.
---
I know, the timing was perfect.
---
Well I crafted the one from the atom shop and the vanilla standard. Tad pool one looks kinda cool though I think lol
---
I guess my post is a little misleading and I apologize. I guess I had better delete it before anyone else gets the wrong impression. I am on XB1, but I am currently not trading as I am in the middle of moving and rebuilding my camp. I am also capped out at the moment. Not sure I really want to open a vending camp anyway.  I was just trading casually among friends and their friends, and one of them bought nearly everything I had for her vending camp.  I just wanted BigPoppa to realize there were others out there who can and will be selling lower very soon and everybody better get it while it's hot.  I have just a few serums left on me and I will be glad to sell them to you if you want, but I can't even tell you right now how many or which ones as I am at work.
---
As far as what I've tamed I've had a level 20 megasloth, a level 20 snallygaster, a level 21 diseased deathclaw (20 seems fairly common) and a level 4 radstag doe that would occasionally spawn in as a level 40 glowing radstag
---
To be fair, the handmade uses 5.56.  It must be a copy of the AK-74 variant.
---
I personally wouldn't want to be hit with either, because three 8-9" long knives welded to an excavator fist frame doesn't sound very pleasant.
---
Saw a level 3 at my base near whitesprings last night.
---
Gonna make discovering the map 1000x easier. I recall trekking my level 15 alt to harpers to buy handmade plans. Sketchy.
---
that's a cool idea, even give them their own perk card set. Maybe even a team bonus if players use different instruments. I play 100% solo now but I would guess others would have a blast with it.
---
I agree. It's the only way to effectively recycle barbed walking sticks in an environmentally sound manner.
---
Your comment makes next to little sense in context of my suggestion. Doesn't read the objective? Sounds like you didn't read the suggestion.
---
How much were shotties nerfed?
---
I tried a max ap regen for dodgy to see how well it worked, and for the amount of pieces on power armor and perk cards just for a 30%dmg reduction wasn‚Äôt worth it.  However, the ap filled almost instantly, and for a vats build (as its not a minigun) and you use that headshot vats perk card your golden
---
I don‚Äôt think the duper hunters should be punished unless they kept the loot, in which several of them did. But if the community is going to have to police itself, we should have a means of doing so.
---
Implemented with latest patch
---
I got a level 14 Snallygaster before - the highest level Deathclaw I was able to tame was 21 and I'm level 160+ right now. I would really like to be able to tame higher level creatures so random spawns don't kill it. My camp is in the mire and unfortunately near a angler spawn so my snallygaster got killed because people spawned in the area and the anglers spawned at lvl 51 and killed him. It's a bit frustrating.
---
That, and something that's dogshit to you may be the perfect weapon for someone else, so if it's actually a solid roll you can just sell it in your vending machine and use that money to buy other dogshit legendary things from other people to scrap for more scrip.
---
Related question for everyone: is there a resource somewhere that simply lists what items sell for (with or without perks) in shops and "npc" vending machines? I'd personally probably just go for knocking a bit off of those prices for common items, something more than what i'd get from a vendor bot, but less than what it would cost from the same bot to make it attractive to players. But my memory is terrible and i have no idea what stuff goes for. A list would help.
---
Is this a confirmed bug at this point? My shotguns are utterly useless now. I read in the patch notes the damage was nerfed but this is ridiculous.
---
Cant wait. I'll be unbanned on that Thursday to. Lol.
---
Yup. Took me five or six tries to make it to the vendor there as low lvl. Ass handed to me by mutants every time.
---
SE of Huntersville is a small BoS graveyard, I've always found a pack of wolves there.
---
Turrets my friend!
---
It would be nice to know whats the cause but honestly, I get the feeling that they don't want you to know.
---
My first character was gun focused, and I started a new character for melee because it was a lot faster, or it felt like it atleast. I also hate having to swap perk cards around so it would be literal hell if I had to swap between a gun or melee build.
---
Turns out I also had missed quite some POIs, so it was nice re-exploring.
---
Shhhhhh. You are givin' away mah secrets to ammo makin'.
---
Oh I am but I know that at least one is bugged and I tried server hopping for the campfire event but I just kept getting disconnected after a bit,I'm just throwing out the idea since i thought why not it's a chance to make people do the events that they put work into its just sad to see that no one does them
---
I use that too. Pretty budget intensive though. Electric, 2 plates, wires and all.
---
So you are assuming that a long term mmo with years of development has no plans to make higher tier weapons. With half a dozen raids on the way? Really. You believe that?
---
The issue is that this is the same thing as when they had to patch Hardened Mass from being autoscrapped with the scrap all button. Same with weapon mods. Its a feature that is there because I don't want to accidentally scrap those things. Dropping bloatfly parts into a bag before scrapping everything isn't something I consider 'engaging'.
---
Have you seen someone do it or just saw a base that had a stacked foundation? 
---
I ask because I have a base on one if my characters that was built when you could foundation stack. As long as I don't move it everything is still there.
---
\*eating cotton candy\*

"Servers are back"
---
\*falls over to desk\*
---
Thanks but i've already found one
---
No upgrade, no customization, no knife.
---
I see people selling the plans alot! Some of them might be a little pricey but you can still get them from players! And I am sure that the event will return next year - hopefully with some new rewards in addition to the old ones! 
---
Also if you cannot find the plans - other players can build them for you in your camp since they are not Atom shop items :)
---
If you plan to respec you may want to roll a new one after all, but otherwise you may as well keep your caps and loot from your old character.  You'll find it easy enough to drop in where you left off!
---
hotfix
---
I did that last night bought a lever for 18500 cause all my toons are full up on caps and was close to not being able to sell things at all . So I got a good gun dumped my caps and make somebody smile , I‚Äôm sure there are dudes in the same position as me
---
I'm interested to find this out as well. If so I guess it's time to grind out some chameleon armor
---
Yes i play, i just came back after a break.   Up until i left and now i never dc reliably like you do.
---
If you had the same problem then and same problem now it might be time to troubleshoot. 
---
Many ppl talk about how much smoother the game is compared to launch yet yours is the same.
---
What about rad ant lager?
---
Sounds cool! Mine is kinda similar. Gotta go up to go back down.
---
Taking out the competition, one generator at a time.
---
i'm ps4. unless you glitched, then that will be the same for me.I'de heard of the hot fix,but another 60gb........thats all thru the night for me............................moan,moan
---
radicool perk card can get you 25 more carry weight (+5 str)
---
I love that she looks to be based on a Polish grandma.  Round, short and wearing a babuska.
---
I think this is just fine. I don't think you should be able to build-a-legendary and I like a bit of randomness in getting gear because it can force you to try out new builds. Plus this works well for trading now that we have player vending and a system to get more 3\* Gear floating around. I do think it'd be nice to have some kind of "reforge" option in the future.
---
It doesn't help the Daily quest but it does help me! Lol. I want to explore what Bethesda has created, not skip by everything in between me and my destination haha.
---
I see! I am expecting a few threads on its release with titles like "got my dream item on the first pull" or "I spent 10,000 scrips and never got anything good" I am just glad it does not lock you out after one try. That was my biggest worry.
---
Pretty sure I saw that the extra weight backpack mod brought it up to 120
---
if it works like the vendors then you could buy and sell like a vendor and get more for your money.   Get your 150 Scrip then buy your stuff refill the vendors scrip a little and then cash out on that.  So you might actually be able to run the daily cap a little higher (unconfirmed till its out)
---
Ppl sell for cheap on market subs here
---
Good point, anoying tho.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to start taming, was wondering if I have to keep the perk on or if I can take it off after I‚Äôve successfully tamed an animal?
---
That's true, it's only about 2/3 the power of standard AK rounds, no wonder hammers sickles and of course gauntlets are all more powerful weapons üëå
---
My comment makes complete sense, only someone unwilling to seek a resolution other than the first notion to come into their head would have issue understanding the blatant expression of opinion regarding users behavior or lack-of when they "accidentally" scrap items that are junk. Cheers.
---
I would avoid any quest/event that starts with, 
---
"calling all reaponders, it's sanjay here."
---
Or
---
"It's grafton day"
---
Bit honestly mabey cold case for the smg, and on my alt im leveling up im avoiding tracking unkowns quests bc i ended up getting a few 2stars from some enemies during that quest line. Just be aware those enemies were rng so possibility you may get junk.
---
Exactly! Shame they didn't take the chance to name her Gheed or something.
---
Hopefully they will make it an annual event in FO76 then. That would make sense. 
---
Thanks for the heads up on the plans. I will have to really check in the vending machines and post on the boards. 
---
I would also love to see some of the Atomic Shop CAMP items to return every once in a while. 
---
Cheers, and thanks for the rely.
---
Nah.  I find it hysterical.
---
This just in...That joke is as old and tired as it gets
---
High capacity backpack is 120 weight btw
---
Ah I get it.  Sometimes the journey is the adventure.
---
Rad Ant Lager, Swingwing Filet, High Capacity Backpack Mod. That's 120 more.
---
I've stayed near the west side of the map for that reason. Mobs are what I'm more worried about killing the things I tame than players especially when my turrets just don't seem to work sometimes
---
I'm surprised. Sorry to hear that for you. It's not that long for me.
---
I just wanna restock my store. Been selling stuff like crazy.
---
Very good to know. I've been trying to figure out what bulk junk will sell. So far acid seems to sell pretty well. I'll add screws to the list.
---
High Capacity mod is 120 lbs at the expense of some defense.
---
Also, you could add 15 more strength with unyielding (+3 all stats except endurance at low health, for each limb and chest)
---
And then another 5 I think for Radicool (up to +5 str at high rads)
---
120 lbs is 54.48 kg
---
Haha I love it. Babcia Murmgh!
---
* "I think a small increase to 600 would be perfect"
---
* "I think an increase to, say, 800...would be PERFECT"
---
* "I think having 1000 weight for stash boxes would be perfect"
---
Learn to manage your fucking stash
---
You can take the perk off after taming the animal and the pet will stay - it's just required to tame it.
---
Last night I killed a legendary 3 star bear outside Alpha and got a nocturnal wood armor. A bit later I was doing the new daily at Dolly Sods and there was another 3 star legendary bear there who "rewarded" me with another piece of wood armor. I little while later I see AWOL pop up, so I go do that, and guess what the legendary 3 star Gutsy gave me? Yup, more wood armor.
---
The point of all that is to say that I'll gladly take this new form of RNG that guarantees 3 star item rather than continue to get my hopes up and then get crushed after yet another 1 star piece of shit drops from a 3 star mob.
---
No, in CAMPs. There's a set spawn point for people FT into your camp. Figure out where that is, make a box. People have already figured out how to make it over a cliff, and not have a floor there. People have already made boxes people can't get out of.
---
How can you have played this game and spent any time in your own CAMP, and not realized you always spawn at the same spot?
---
Dang üò≠
---
Maybe unpopular opinion but for the most part I like the new backpack quests and challenges. I do agree that better instructions are needed. After I did the two quests where you cleanup waste and the other one I was like.. uh ok im at 3/4 with no clear instructions on what to do next. It also seems like it was intended you do these over time, like overseers quest and not all at once.  But that's only friendly to new players, not current players. 
---
I also enjoyed the exams. Brag warning: I was a Scout for many years and knew many answers right away. Took me maybe an hour to complete all the exams with a little trial and error. I understand that it's a very American oriented thing and much harder for other cultures or folks who were not taught most of the answers in the Scouts.
---
Oh stop your flailing.
---
I've also tamed a level 1 housecat!
---
Lmao! Effing autocorrect on my phone!
---
+50 Carry Weight courtesy of Google
---
Idk why, but I get like an old granny vibe with her flower gloves and babuska.
---
Indeed!
---
If I can no longer punch things to 1hp while the owner helplessly watches then go on a breaking spree before I get killed then I will open every door, collect all the water, and turn all lights off whenever possible
---
I would imagine they could get pricey...but thanks for the heads up on others building it for me. Great idea!
---
Cheers!
---
Wait,  I can lock doors? How?
---
Best explanation ever haha
---
The purveyor actually has a storyline outside of fallout. Same with the mole miners. I do like that they added their take on some fictional and nonfictional history.
---
The mothman statue in Point Pleasant is the only place worth server hopping to get a tourist.
---
I'd be very surprised if it didn't force the item level to maximum.
---
20 trash one-stars for a three star is certainly an attractive trade ratio for Whitesprings farmers. I hated legendary farming before, might do a bit of it now.
---
I regret all of the technical data now
---
Mkay, so....  
---
According to the Bethesda Forum thread of ["Known Issues/Annoyances"](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language=en) (which is a thread where they're stating they've recognized these things), it says:  
---
*"* **Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition may incorrectly provide an increase to some stats.**
---
* **STATUS:**¬†This issue was addressed in Patch 9 on May 7."
---
So I guess what we've been experiencing with some weapons was not intended, apparently?
---
I wasn't able to get to repairing anything today *(was wrapped up in adding my store to my camp)* to confirm whether Fix It Good is broken as [u/grakky99](https://www.reddit.com/user/grakky99) stated, though. I'll try and make it a priority once servers come back up, because AFAIK that one ***is*** supposed to add DR to over-repaired items.
---
I get the impression the devs are so busy fixing bugs (my theory is there are only 2 coders, neither of whom read the ;;comments in the code when making changes), that they went to the Perks section and came across the code that "improved item stat when &gt;100%", copied it, deleted the code, did CTRL+F, and removed all other entries...  
---
Which since they were trying to work fast which means not skipping research, resulted in screwing up perks that were legitimately supposed to do that. (Again, that's ***if*** it really isn't working for Fix It Good.)
---
My personal opinion is items we craft **should** have improved stats in *some* regard, as they're not mass-produced in a factory, but hand crafted by people. I envision it would be similar to Max Durability where some items we find, despite being 100% identical (mods included), have a longer durability bar.   
---
In that light... As an example - A chance our crafted guns will have up to 2.5% improvement on any ONE base-stat: +DMG, +Range, +Rate of Fire, +Accuracy, -Weight (lighter).  Maybe once you max out the Weaponsmith perk card it could randomly increase *two* stats. :P
---
\[/wishful thinking\]
---
Replace Buffout with Bufftats and you get 515 total
---
There are mods that reduce the ap cost.
---
Tbh rifles anti armor perks make it better than pistols anyways so it's a no brainer.
---
Not to say pistol vats isn't viable of course but rifle its more potent due to AA
---
Hey they said it would be around forever as long as we keep playing.
---
I could be wrong but I think Beth deletes the game then re-loads it with the fixes. So it's like having a new game! :)
---
There's no way not to be melted in PvP if you haven't spent hundreds of hours shooting your friends in your camp, or haven't been exposed to knowledge of those who had it. Movement and positioning is also super crucial. If you have two exactly geared exactly skilled players, and they fight repeatedly from same positions, and one of those positions is vastly better than the other, the guy in better position will get dozen of kills per one of their opponent.
---
Yeah I heard there water bandits out there lol
---
Once you've tamed the creature and its back at your camp you can take off the perk cards. In my experience the animal will stay red as if it was hostile but they won't aggro your camp as long as there's nothing blocking their walking path. It'll also show "owned by" the same was as turrets. You can also move the camp beacon to change where the creature patrols
---
Hah, i always leave my door wide open. Seems like it would feel friendlier to visitors. Last night i came back to my camp and i saw someone had closed it and it kinda weirded me out. "Someone closed my door?l Why would someone do that?!" XD
---
I feel like they are doing something, because they changed the UI from diamonds to stars but kept the 5 star slots, so they must have a plan for them.
---
Also I had a 4-star machete due to the Sacrificial Blade mod, but after the UI change it's now a 3-Star, but it still has the mod's ability on there. So maybe they are doing to preliminary setup for that now. Maybe with Nuclear Winter.
---
You could try hopping around servers and checking the new camp vending - might find some cheap! I've found some plans I've been wanting for a long time for cheap the past couple days! Good luck!
---
Buying the 2 star weapons is probably the most cost effective. 
---
As the most sought after weapons have combo effects of either tse, furious explosive, bloodied explosive, instigating +40 power attack.
---
Not for me... (PS4)
---
Great POV. Love the new content and the idea of the vending system. Love people in and out of my camp.
---
My rifle user relies pretty heavily on vats, but I don't actually have a lot of points invested in vats abilities.  I think diving deep into vats perks relies on having high AP regen ala pistols.  Stealth snipers can make good use of it though, especially if you have high perception and the perk to select body parts in vats (can't think of the name for the life of me).
---
Or....run unyielding and crank up the agility. I run a heavy ass unyielding mishmash and have a 30+ agility. Enemies rarely see me unless they are super close and I shot their friend in front of them. Yesterday I had a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw walk within inches of me and never saw me. My meter stayed solid in the hidden. 
---
I do not invest in sneak or light armor. I do have escape artist and it works most of the time. If in danger I will find a dark corner or some cover and then uncrouch and recrouch. Usually my meter will return to caution and I can continue sneak attacking with my bloodied auto handmade.
---
;)
---
Exactly. And that trash 3 star item you could potentially get can be shredded for more scrip or sold
---
I want a house cat so bad! I've spent hours server hopping spawns and I still haven't found one. I've also see normal attack dogs and the black wolf on YouTube, but I seem to only get mongrels
---
Shrooms*
---
I have a *very* minimalist camp that is literally just a deathclaw shrine so there's no turrets or anything to protect but I don't think they would help. My friend has his camp littered with turrets and they never seem to attack enemies at his camp :/
---
You have a point here. I could probably drop down to no more than 50-100 of each material. Maybe less. I wish there was a way to add a cap to the items you pick up lol
---
They still haven't fixed the issue with the Heavy Leather Right Arm and it not accepting the correct mod or dye colors. As \[shown here\]([https://i.imgur.com/vSzCjid.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vSzCjid.jpg)) the armor is supposed to be Studded making it a dark black with metal bolts, however it looks as if it was Boiled, whenever you try to add a Dye (Camo for example) it goes to the default leather color. It's a bit annoying especially when you try to match everything.
---
If you just say you want boom boom guess what she will do ü§î
---
I even proof read my body. Wish I could edit the title!
---
Most definitely, great idea.  I bought a t51 jet pack mod yesterday for 500 caps. Cheers to that seller!
---
Seriously? Out of all the ways how this new vendor could have worked, they decided to do another lazy-ass gambling simulator...? Why are you doing this to us, Bethesda?
---
I don't think they'll be adding new content for as long you hope buddy lol
---
And ya, they'll introduce maybe a couple themed weapons (like the Sheepsquatch club), but I very much doubt they'll be adding in a game changing new set of weapons or properties. The gear is already good enough to fight anything in the game without breaking a sweat, so why introduce even deadlier stuff? 
---
Fallout is not WoW, where they have to turn up the dial a bit every few months to keep the Power Creep effect going. The difficulty curve just isn't there. The new raids are not going to be very tough, because they want basically everything to be doable solo. Just look at The Burrows. Easy to do alone at like lvl 50, and the reward was just a legendary cultist blade. That's what I expect the rest to be like, not some huge elaborate WoW Raid, because that's how Bethesda rolls.
---
Use the old one, it‚Äôll save you weeks of time. If you‚Äôre over lvl 50, you can re-spec your special if you think you don‚Äôt like how you built your original guy
---
You're off to a good start just with this post. I also play on PC, if you see my name on a server feel free to send a friend request.
---
I switch between two characters in adventure and survival, so I can't say for sure where I will be on a given day.
---
There's naturally opportunity just playing the game as well. Some new players will almost immediately offer to team up and add as friends, especially before level 5 if you're playing survival mode. You'll probably run across other players near your level who will want to play together as you go through the main quest. The same is true for events at higher levels.
---
&gt;Tell me a better way, and not one that involves you getting all the god roll items on day one
---
I can tell you several:
---
* **The Xur Model:** Every Friday, the legendary vendor appears at one of several random locations and stays there until Monday, bringing with her an assortment of curated legendaries. Her stock switches each week, so check back to see what she dug up this time! *(Time-gated, targeted acquisition, some randomness)*  
---
* **The Build A Bear Model:** Deep within the newly opened Burrows awaits Hans, the legendary mole miner vendor. Hans will gladly take your unwanted legendaries and scrap them for you, giving you legendary motes in return. However, Hans only has so many motes for you each week, so pace yourself. Collect enough motes (and a hefty chunk of caps) and Hans will let you purchase legendary mods from his revolving stock; use these mods to add legendary effects to your existing gear! *(Resource-gated, non-random, cap sink)*  
---
* **The Casino Model:** Meet the Whitespring's newest residents, Dig and Doug the legendary gearsmiths! Trade in your unwanted legendaries for different-colored isotopes (depending on gear type and star rating; for example, a 1-star piece of armor yields one gray isotope, a 1-star guns yields 1 dull isotope, while a 3-star weapon yields one dazzling isotope, etc.) and either trade your isotopes with other players or use them in the gearsmiths' atomic recombobulator to generate fantastic new creations; the more and the rarer the isotopes you wager, the better the chance of getting something truly spectacular! *(Player-controlled randomness, indirect cap sink through player trading)*
---
Agreed, a lot of dying involved. I'd prefer a long, drawn out battle though. It would be better than a literal rain storm of explosive shots from a constantly jumping enemy.
---
You wan it pierogi?
---
My bloody explosive pump action shotgun with all +60% damage perks sadly now does about half what my bloody death clawgauntlet does without any perks.
---
nope
---
It didn't spawn all the items needed when searching for items the campers left behind.
---
You can do both at the same time, just so you know. What platform are you on?
---
Yes, we are! It is a great thing being a part of a group that seeks to preserve technology for future generations instead of one that would use it to destroy the world serving a twisted agenda.
---
Have you heard of our new card game...*Qwent*? It‚Äôs totally original.
---
That's a great idea if it was a one time use atom shop item. Else it would be used all the time.
---
Well no shit they want players to log on daily! Let's just see how it works once it is actually released before making suggestions for fixes etc
---
I‚Äôve been saying something around the same as you did. I‚Äôm hoping that they will take the advise. There‚Äôs no human npcs right now but they have several vaults. They can make it where you rescue them and they become various vendors or random encounters. The map itself, I hope gets bigger. Even if it means zoning to a new map or something. I think the death of this game will be if they choose to keep it as just west versions when they have every option to include multiple states like in fallout one and two. Fallout two was my favorite. The fact that I could earn caps by selling drugs, fight npcs in boxing arenas and being a porn star.
---
Haha, no. You came on here to attempt making fun of people who play the game casually to make yourself feel better and to gain a higher false sense of superiority with delusions of grandeur. It is textbook and someone ought to knock you down a peg or two back down to reality :P
---
I just want to relax and play this game in a casual manner. But there are a lot of little annoyances in this game that make it difficult to want to play for any extended amount of time.
---
Maybe a dumb question but what is the same item generation script? is that where the game is looking at your inventory to decide on what you roll? or did i just read that wrong?
---
I've seen a mongrel - never a lone wolf or attack dog yet. I got the kitty at the random spawn that's near the spruce knob - at the lookout tower. I've never seen it at the crashed vertibot spawn. But one day my kitty just disappeared q.q
---
I would honestly settle for the front sight for the irons at this point.
---
There a place to find out her story?
---
Great answer.  I like you. I'm wondering if OP saying "paid up" means Ebay?
---
I‚Äôd like for the breakdown to be heavy/rifle/pistol/shotgun, and 1h/2h/unarmed weapons
---
I understand but imagine the struggle for people who only have maybe an hour or two a day to play
---
I can't view your build from work, but can share what I know from my 200+ levels of Stealth Play.
---
Chameleon Armor, along with the Chameleon mutation is essential, but you only need 1 piece, Having multiples does not seem to make any difference, and other Armor perks or weight are all second to having a +1 Agility modifier.
---
Your most important Special Stat for Stealth is Agility, make sure you get Mutations that enhance that.
---
Stealth can be a little buggy sometimes, more so when on a Team, and is sometimes caused by diseases, check for that if you're having issues, but when it's working, I'm a Ghost.
---
I use the strongest Armor I can, as I've seen no significant difference with the lighter stuff, and instead have equipped myself with +1 agility &amp; Weight Reduction Pieces.
---
I have 12 Agility points assigned, +3 from mutations, +5 from Armor, and +1 from some weapons for 20-21 Normal Agility, which allows me to sneak through almost anything, most of the time, even during events, I can remain in Caution most of the time.
---
Last, Escape Artist absolutely works if used properly, run to an area to break line of sight before dropping back to Sneak to trigger it.
---
Based on the look of the scrip machines alone, i kinda want to join a mole men faction. I like their style.
---
lol
---
They've already shown how it works. The update today gave us the pricing and the exhanger is already in game. You pay 100 scrip for a single chance at a 3 star. Works exactly the same as when the game is rolling a 3 star drop from an enemy or event.
---
True. It took me forever to get my death tambo which has become one of my favorite weapons. I‚Äôd hate to give it up
---
At this point youre better off with weight reduction imo
---
You can have those, but not in 1v1 scenario. The game shines on 4v4.
---
That'd be Kadala. I know this because it became habit to shout 'KADALA YOU SLAG' every time she gave me a garbage item.
---
Bladed Commie Whacker is still the underappreciated meta.
---
Be prepared sadly
---
Same too, 1400/455 last I checked hahaha
---
The part I dislike is the currency cap. I would really, really, REALLY like to be able to legitimately grind legendaries. With a 150 scrip a day cap, it's like a mobile game.
---
Ummm alot honestly lol
---
When you get a legendary drop, the game rolls to see what it is. The existing way this works is how it will work with the purveyor.
---
On top of this, The cooking system should be majorly reworked, starting with being able to sort it by the number of missing ingredients at a stove or campfire.  And even better would be being able to see what recipes a flower/plant can be used in directly from the pip boy or before you grab it - Something like "this is used in"
---
Fallout 76: Inside the Vault ‚Äì The Purveyor
---
In case you missed it, we released Patch 9 this week, which included new features, quests, design changes, and addressed many bugs that had been reported by the Fallout 76 community. In this week‚Äôs Inside the Vault, we‚Äôre sharing a preview of the Purveyor, a new ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù vendor that will help you exchange the Legendary Scrip you‚Äôve been collecting into legendary gear.
---
First, though, we‚Äôd like to thank everyone who continues to share feedback and bug reports with us. Patch 9 was one of our biggest updates yet, and we couldn‚Äôt have put this patch together without your help. We hope you‚Äôll continue to share your thoughts with us as we make further improvements in future updates.
---
Now, let‚Äôs meet the Wasteland‚Äôs newest shopkeeper.
---
Strike Up a Deal!
---
If you‚Äôre a seasoned Wasteland explorer, your run-ins with the hooded figures known as Mole Miners have probably been less than pleasant experiences. The Purveyor, however, will be the first of her kind to breach the surface of Appalachia in order to sell weapons and armor to Dwellers from her vast stockpile of legendary items. . Previously, we had announced that the Purveyor would arrive on May 23 but, as it turns out, Mole Miners are exceptionally fast diggers. She‚Äôs going to arrive a week earlier than expected and is now looking to kick off her grand opening on Thursday, May 16.
---
The Purveyor is no ordinary vendor. She only deals in legendary items, and only accepts a unique currency, called Legendary Scrip, as payment. You can use the Exchange Machines that appeared at Train Stations earlier this week to break down legendary items that were collecting dust in your Stash into Legendary Scrip. Once you‚Äôve lined your pockets with some Scrip, travel to the previously abandoned Train Station in Berkeley Springs and find the Purveyor within.
---
The Purveyor has a vast collection of legendary items at her disposal and will allow you to choose whether you‚Äôd like to buy armor, melee weapons, or ranged weapons. You will also be able to pick whether your item will have one, two, or three legendary attributes. However, she doesn‚Äôt allow buyers to haggle over the exact details of an item and instead will select its legendary attributes at the time of purchase. This means that while you will always receive an item that fits the type and star-rating you‚Äôve selected, its attributes will be decided at random. Additionally, Legendary Scrip prices vary based on the type of item and star-rating you select. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry if you haven‚Äôt had a chance to visit Legendary Exchange Machines just yet, because they‚Äôre not going anywhere. Use them whenever you‚Äôve collected legendary items that you don‚Äôt want to keep, and then visit the Purveyor anytime after May 16 to add new gear to your collection.
---
There is a point here. The inconsistency is not good.
---
Hit "Y", and then "X" to repair it. They added a second step to repairing stuff, not just hitting "Y" once like it was. Read the button prompts on the bottom of the screen. Hope that helps.
---
Hi sorry for the late... I am ig now ign VvtheDuke33 if you are around...
---
I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised with it.  
---
Unfortunately, because no random rerolls, my Beserker's/Reload DR pump shotgun will remain broken and unusable, which sucks. It's so much fun UNTIL I have to reload it, at which point it's damage is cut by over half (215 to 87 with current half-baked perks).  
---
Ah well, another farming source is never a bad thing, honestly.
---
Bruh honestly. I literally remade a magnificent home so that it can accommodate these wastelanders THEY NEED TO CHECK OUT MUH POOL TABLE AND JUKEBOX SETUP
---
Talk to the camp guides again and redo the quest, I just did it and got another badge
---
They do not show up red anymore fyi c: it has been changed!
---
Thank you tried that but still not screen pop up after hitting X.
---
There's no hard data to suggest the game decides rolls based on your inventory. It's all RNG
---
Still no legendary pipe revolvers?
---
I would argue the opposite. If you look at how most mutational evolution work, female is the baseline, male is the variation. So her being female is the opposite of mutation, it is returning to the baseline.
---
Yes I've done the quest 8 times now. It had markers for the items and no items under the markers. Was like 6 people trying too.
---
The date on that email was from the end of March.
---
They probably don't like to work period. When you let them buy they will complain about the price, when you give them for free they will complain about their god-rolls' resale value.
---
Up!!! If you can helpme back!
---
I was wondering as well how it will determine what level item to sell you.
---
I don‚Äôt think those penetration mods work that well if you already have Incisor
---
Could put it in the new terminal.
---
So, if we had the ability to reroll existing gear - either the whole thing or just a single stat on it, how would you recommend  the system been designed with the selection of legendary effects we have now, that would allow people to reroll the gear so they have what they want but still encourage them to continue to play?
---
It only works in Diablo 3 because gear still has ranges on stats, and you can only roll one stat on an item.  Even if you find a "good" legendary there and reroll a stat, you are encouraged to find one where all the other stats are "better".  We don't have stat ranges in the game on the effects.  And even in Diablo 3, it clearly didn't solve the problem because they had to add in a new tier of item - Ancient - to keep the farm going.
---
I picked up the fasnacht sausage and a couple decorations for 50-100 caps each last night.  Grab em before they get scarce!
---
Nice find!
---
I'm... Confused.
---
I don't feel it's realistic to believe that Fallout 76 will still be online in 20 years, despite how much I enjoy it (and how much I hope others do, as well). I still replay Fallout 1 at least once a year and it came out in '97... am I being unreasonable for wanting to do the same with Fallout 76?
---
Please explain.
---
Also dirt in a jar, insect pins
---
I‚Äôd love this to be a ‚Äúchange my mind‚Äù style thread because I‚Äôm sure there are it ms I don‚Äôt know because I haven‚Äôt delved into the baseline how it works part of the game too deeply.
---
I run rejuvenated, lone wanderer, and action ‚Äúperson‚Äù on all 5 of my characters.  I‚Äôm not sure of diminishing returns etc etc but it‚Äôs what I do.  Would love to know min/max details on this.
---
Starched genes and bloody mess (to swap bloody for super duper, pharma farma etc as situationally needed) I consider mandatory.  All of my characters have 5 or more luck, period.
---
I do NOT run gunsmith or makeshift warrior anymore.  Rely on double repairs from the double repair weapon perk, and use first aid rank 3 and something else (usually nerd rage)
---
Ranking up born survivor is silly.  Rank 1 on any character with room for it.
---
I too have thought about this. Im comin near 500 hrs. Ive become a treasure hunter in between content drops. Rare weapons and arnor and outfits. I keep thinking how they can keep droppin new contebt..weapons..everythibg..until they stop. Then my long term collection becomes a myth. Thats a bad bad feeling.
---
Hopefully I will have some food luck like that!
---
Our of curiosity was this part of the mass ban? i.e. Not just you, but hundreds might be unbanned as well? PC could use more players.
---
Send team invite pls
---
Hmm, I've never gotten markers on them at all. I assumed you just had to find them.  
---
i've failed the quest numerous times because the other 5 people there were milling around aimlessly, I was one of them myself for a while until i figured out "picking up tinder" wasnt just collecting wood but picking up sticks I never got a quest marker for. I feel like 70% of the people there are just standing there confused waiting for the quest to progress
---
I wouldn‚Äôt like it, but I would honestly understand. I get like 1300 damage with a power fist now basically one-shotting everything. It‚Äôs way too OP honestly
---
How many scripts do you get for trading items in? Do you have any idea?
---
Caps are worthless if you play a lot.  It's easy to hit the cap limit if you try.  
---
And yeah TSE is still a coveted drop but AAE and BE are the new top dog items with TSE a close 3rd.  I woulda dropped 18k on a TSE handmade as well cause I know I can just farm that back up in a couple weeks.  
---
The real value of that gun would have been trading it for a specific legendary that your build can leverage.
---
I bought a 3* cavalier assassin arm for 1k.
---
best I can hope for is 2mb/s, so thats well into the wee hrs.
---
no-one else reporting this so i'm hoping that its not a full download... 6gb tues took well  over an hour
---
There are many online games that have been online for 20 years. As long as it brings in money why wouldn't it be?
---
I have also been playing fallout from the beginning.
---
For me it was XO1 Calibrated mods, after putting them on I forgot to collect my power armor when I fast traveled and I lost the whole armor set. No trace of it in my inventory.
---
INORITE...I could not believe it!
---
I‚Äôd love to know more about this.
---
Yes many players have experienced items disappearing recently. My friends and I have all lost pieces of power armor and a couple of my friends have also lost weapons.
---
That was my thought, just a consumable
---
Yeah that's what someone mentioned in order for them to get it completed. Not quite a pest, might be some other bears in the area. Also make sure you walk around the forest around the cabins, ticks spawn there and you may have to kill them.
---
Yeah bethesda release an apology of sorts about it yesterday. It‚Äôs not in game so it can‚Äôt be completed.
---
I'll go back to checking there, that's where my current deathclaw spawned
---
Shoot man just getting the choice to roll a freaking ranged weapon is great. I use heavy weapons and automatic rifles which means there's already like a more than 50% chance I can use whatever gun I get. 3 stars is 3 stars to me, I'll be happy with anything honestly. I've literally yet to roll a level 45 or 50 3 star gun on an actual 3 star enemy so this already massively improves my odds
---
Ugh, how do you tolerate not being able sprint, lol.
---
Easiest place is the water park in the wave pool.  Once ya find someone, drink a bunch of the toxic water there and when you get down to a sliver of health, get the nearby scorched to kill ya.
---
Fantastic, thank you so much for taking the time to help me. You mention the chameleon perk as well as the mutation though....wouldn't the one chameleon piece counteract the whole weightless effect? Sorry if I am not understanding :/
---
lol read your screen, fool.
---
How many people have you spawn camped when they came to shop?
---
Not gonna lie. I planned for the ability to reroll a weapon I bought specifically for the legendary vendor. I guess my bet was a bad one and I now have a not good 3\* handmade. At least I didn't spend too many caps on it.
---
Yeah, you can apply the Tadpole skin to it.  I was torn, but I kind of like the generic look of the newly crafted one.  You can go back and forth if you want.
---
Sure they do. They've been intentionally drilling players.
---
I hear ya!  I have always loved the game but this brought it to a new level. I love seeing people in and out of my camp.
---
They confirmed at least 2 years of planned content. The game is 60$ and has a store so money has been kind to them. I see you are just one of those doubters who probably watched one to many angry youtubers jumping on the hate wagon. Lets set a reminder for 2 years from now and settle this then.
---
Everyone thought ESO was gonna flop and at first it did, but it is still going strong. This game is getting significantly better every patch. If i just joined as a new player i would be baffled by anyone who thought it was bad.
---
The burrows were a failure   but sheepsquach shows there is a higher tier of boss intended. 
---
What i see as the flaw in your logic is you see, "things are all easy if not manageable now with current gear so why would they make stronger gear?" When in reality "things are all easy if not manageable now with the current gear but we have no idea how hard raids will really be. If they are like the burrows current gear is more than enough and the raid shouldn't even be added along with new weaponsbecause its too easy, but if raids really require 4 highly geared trained players to even stand a small chance, a higher tier will be necessary to make the raids more easy later and add an actual end game".
---
I know what you mean -- would be nice to have a way to reroll certain stats on an existing item or something.  Might come down the line.  
---
I do like the vendor, though, but I'm only at the 200hr mark.  
---
At the 1200 hr mark, you are past endgame.  You are on some other echelon of game that most people wont see for years f ever, though.
---
As a sneaker who had about 34 agility with unyielding armor (modded ultralight, mix of marine/combat/robot as i was prioritizing legendary effects) I can literally walk around in front of something and stay hidden. I‚Äôve had SB land on me (that I shot at) and stay in caution.  
---
That being said, I‚Äôve also been agro‚Äôd through walls before. Stealth is super inconsistent in this game.
---
I fast walk with speed demon lol but when I get super fat, I can't even do that. Just waiting to unload all my items when the time comes haha
---
This is Vault 76, not Oxford. We are bright, but not necessarily polite.
---
I had a blast yesterday standing in water in my underwear with fireproof unequipped.  Offing myself over and over again with TSE Handmade to the feet for 4-5 different people.
---
I will be running Unyielding by the looks of it. It doesn't seem to make sense to do anything else given the advice in the thread. Interesting to know you don't use the sneak perk....
---
If everyone is running around with a God tier roll.. Then no one is God tier. This is a great system. Its better RNG then we have now, but not enough to ruin everything. Really great system to be honest. People that are complaining want everything handed to them all the time. Putting effort and work into things brings satisfaction when they pay off. This system doesn't seem like an unfair amount of work.
---
Besides this, now that trading has increased tenfold it will stimulate the economy and encourage more trading. You have access to everyone on your world who is also rolling with their script. I think this will make your personally desired items a lot more obtainable now without having God tier rolls all over the place.
---
The hunt is what makes it rewarding to finally fins something really good so yeah, I get this sentiment.  
---
That said I'd love a way to specifically pick maybe just 1\* items and have everything 2\*+ be rng.  If I caould rely on specific 1\* items, I could get into some heave min/max character building that would be fun for me personally :)
---
Also they said raids will not be designed to be soloable, they will be meant for 4 player teams, but we can try it with less.
---
No. I have Unyielding Cav and I've not noticed much of a difference.
---
Handmade and assault rifles cost about 34 AP per shot. You can reduce this to about 17 with an auto receiver.
---
Combat and radium rifles cost about 28 AP per shot, 14 with auto receiver.
---
With a -25% AP cost legendary, auto rifles are less than 10 AP per shot. My combat costs 7. It costs more AP to jump than to shoot.
---
They good vats weapons.
---
They said they would stop releasing massive updates, so something is not right here for sure if that is the case.
---
Will hope it‚Äôs not true.  Would prefer it be a game mode with much harsher pve survival mechanics.
---
Not at all. Like you, Fallout 76 is my favorite Fallout game. I am going to have difficulty returning to a single-player version.
---
&gt; fasnacht sausage
---
&gt; food luck
---
Well done!
---
I just want to know which ones are on my side . I definitely don‚Äôt think they are 100% server side
---
I could have swore I saw a silencer mod or plan yesterday for the submachine gun. I'll have to double check tonight.
---
I might just see how can I can balance this with "oh shit" defense perks like Serendipity and maybe Grim Reaper's Sprint. Damn I love this kind of challenge :)
---
Thanks, well I meant learning the mods if the workbenches mattered.
---
shoots me down in flames.could have sworn i've seen one of these.
---
Like plants they have a refresh counter on them.
---
Unfortunately it seems that the client gives the milk option when the brahmin is dry.
---
Go to a different one, or try again later.
---
Alternatively, make a brahmin pen in your camp and milk it. Or go looking at other peoples camps for their brahmin
---
There are no steel plans
---
Good question, surprised, no one has made a video on this yet. I assume we can do this and hope we can.
---
keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
---
I never saw a freaking deathclaw there &gt;| It drove me crazy so I started checking the mire again. Right now I think I want to get a Yao Guai / Deathclaw. I wanted a Mongrel but it's only level 4 so too squishy.
---
Yeah most people are super confused. Also in the last stage, if you get the waves of insects. You can run back to where you picked up the tinder, and get more dry tinder to put on the fire to keep the timer from going out.
---
The worst is when people kill all the mobs on the fire and stand on top of it so you can't select the fire to drop more kindle.
---
It hates me too.  I got lucky recently though.
---
The previous nerf to explosive didn't get carried onto them, here is the excerpt from Patch 9:
---
"**Explosive Shotguns:** Fixed an issue causing Shotguns with the Explosive legendary effect to deal double damage, rather than the intended +20%."
---
Oh thanks! That's the info. I was looking for. I missed that yesterday.
---
Not a hater, love the game, I just think you're getting your hopes up. I do hope it lasts too, it's gotten a bit better every patch. I just don't think a new legendary tier is what'll happen. But ya, guess we'll see. Hmu when that reminder goes off üëç
---
&gt;The fact that I could earn caps by selling drugs, fight npcs in boxing arenas and being a porn star.
---
I loved New Reno! So many families to be a made man in, so few hours in the day.
---
I completely agree that the opportunities are there to really, *really* expand the world and narrative. I just wish there was an exodus plan for the end.
---
You have no idea how the chances and %s will work yet dude, just assuming it'll be the same drop rate based on how the game plays now. It may very well be but why stress so early, haha
---
[PS4] I get them almost weekly. Check up on the stumps and logs in the creek next to the chemical plant after the Heart of the Swamp event.
---
Well crap...I guess I'll know when I get one. So tedious.
---
Scoot's shack has a ton of kitties! Not sure if you can tame them, I haven't tried but there's quite a few there.  It doesn't have a map marker but if you go to the Sothern Belle Motel, and pick up a Cryptid Hunters Monthly newsletter on one of the tables near the Police Protectron it will give you a quest, and that first objective is to visit his shack which then gives you a map marker. The quest also gives a cool reward :)
---
will do!
---
It gets really confusing, as, IIRC, the 10mm SMG doesn't have a muzzle slot for mods at all.   
---
The regular SMG does, however. At a glance they're really confusing to look at as they're all worded the same.
---
Then you sell it back for 40. So the true cost of a 3\* is actually 60 script.
---
Omg wait to fast travel on you and server disconnext I am cursed
---
It sounds trippier with the sch
---
Thx man
---
Yea the PA was fixed but now I get this. I worked so hard for that gun just for it to disappear..
---
Oh no, totally feel you on that one. Normally, an hour or two every couple days is nowy life goes for me as well (bring a grown-up and such). My point was the mass amount of things adds longevity to the game. Even if it takes months, so what? Isn't that preferred to being able to complete it all in a week or two (casually) then going back to having trouble finding goals to strive for? Just my thoughts of course, also apologies if my previous comment came across as confrontational.
---
Shitty buzz man :(
---
It would be cool to have it. 
---
I'm with you all the way
---
The to get thebackpack is not hard but if you try to speed run it you will loos caps unless you know how and when to fast travle like a pro just love the backpack quest if i can finish it lol

You may be on to something there! :)
---
Something not right indeed...
---
Someone mentioned there is a limit per server, so milk 1, server hop .. we all playing Server Hop 76 .. smh .. Flatwoods or your own brahmin at your camp
---
I‚Äôm really hoping that they have a side team working on a whole new map while this one continues to be worked on.  It would give them the time needed to focus on it and hopefully polish it to a playable status.
---
It encourages cooperation between players. If you have a mic or can chat via Discord, it doesn't take that long. Even doubling your chances (1 alt) is still worth it.
---
Drop a lvl of rifleman for Max lvl Concetrated Fire.  Equipped this for the first time yesterday and didnt have a VATS accuracy of less than 92% for the rest of the night.  Not to mention the dmg buff.  One shotting way more than just running Covert with 3 max lvl Rifleman perks.
---
I don't think you have to worry about it.  
---
FO76 is going to Steam.  The player base will expand ensuring it's around for quite sometime.  
---
During that time someone will figure out how to code the server side...if Beth doesn't just release it on their own.
---
Likewise!! I must have dreamt it lol.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the support üòÅ
---
Just Strangler Pods there, always.
---
I mean they said that about Silos too, but between them and The Burrows....ü§∑ Cakewalks
---
And they also said repeatedly before release that the *entire* game would be doable solo. I know, Todd's promises don't mean much, but I don't think they'll push the difficulty super hard because they seem to have been keeping that in mind for the most part.
---
Or maybe the Y chromosome got its shit together and is puttin those nips to use for once.
---
I don't agree, first melee is op but it's more risk cause melee, second bloodied is more death risks, third cav and sent nerfs. Nerfing Bloodied build and this build will have no interest anymore
---
The beauty of this game is there are zero *must have* perks for anyone. They all depend on your build and playstyle.
---
I've gone there for quite a few pics with the cats haha. I can pacify them but not tame them unfortunately. It's my understanding that taming only works on random spawns not fixed spawns so I just spend hours server hopping
---
even without it, the sledge has rocket and heated coil mods with sawblades that up the damage higher then the nomodd super sledge
---
Honestly I feel very thankful for all the hard work they put into this game, really impressed.
---
Aww what a great find! I've got a Bloodied 1 star handmade and I've been wanting a 3 star but I don't really like explosive. Hopefully I can find something good like this!
---
You have to complete/win the event Heart of the Swamo, not just have it active.
---
What system are you on? I'll grab a few next time I see it active and donate them to you if you're online (and on ps4)
---
it's been reported since release and nobody in this sub believed them. and because it's difficult to replicate, Bethesda doesn't seem to officially acknowledge it. only recently someone was able to post video proof. I myself lost 3 different items.
---
I believe it's because of server sync. essentially, what the server is seeing isn't what your client is seeing. say you press the key to reload, at least on PC and PS4 that's the same key used to drop items. except the server thinks your have the pipboy open, so it performs the action bound to the reload key while on the pipboy- it drops whatever is highlighted.
---
now because this is a sync issue, you probably won't notice anything wrong up until your character is refreshed, which happens on fast travel. so you see, it's not the fast travel that does it, but rather something that you inadvertently did prior to fast traveling.
---
this is of course just an example. in practice, it could happen to anything that moves or modifies items. storing, selling, scrapping. maybe even equipping. what I did on PC was rebind the reload key to F and physically remove the R key from my keyboard.
---
Can't beat a max lvl VE  gatling I bought for 400c
---
if you log out by dyer chemical then log back in the blooms will be there it is a glitch

Miners a long time ago got paid in a currency called scrips and they would use that to buy the things that they needed. The purveyor would be the person who acted as the merchant. There‚Äôs quite a bit of actual lore to the game that they implemented. Such as superstition of the fabled flatwoods monster.
---
Are u suggesting  a black market
---
The warehouse plan set(Everywhere) is like corrugated steel, the Metal plan set(Whitespring Station) is like an actual steel building
---
Yeah - PA is really replaceable but 3star weapons are kind of hard when it comes to getting it replaced with the perks you had and everything. I am really sorry man :c
---
Dont work with 12 caliber and both laser turret. I have made the test.
---
Nothing sad about it. Those effects were never meant to be permanent combat increases. I'd expect them to put a cooldown on the bloodied proc -- something like every sixty seconds.
---
Pipe pistols and rolling pins for everyone!
---
I don't have the exact numbers to answer this, however, it's not exactly. Melee has numerous weapons that are basically unusable. A god roll walking cane, lead pipe, pitchfork, pipe wrench, etc. no one will really use as the damage is sooooo much less vs. a meathook, powerfist or supersledge. Whereas the majority of ranged weapons are usable or at least have high retrade value. (There are very few exceptions like the black powder pistol)
---
Good write up. I've also noticed that using the sight causes the extended magazine to block alot more of the screen. I beleive it raises the part of the gun closes to the character, which then obstructs the sight itself and the lower right half of the screen This isnt an issue at all if you remove the sight and aim with the gun.
---
Not exactly.
---
Currently, it rolls 1-3*s, and the entire pool of items, and then the effects.
---
Now you'll be able to guarantee it's 3*s, and then guarantee a general class - Melee / Ranged / Armor.
---
So that cuts out a considerable amount of random. There's still plenty of RNG, but it's removing a big chunk of unwanted combinations from your potential rolls.
---
Somerset special you get for completing the responders up to listening to mariah's holotape in the airport. Called "final destination".
---
I couldn't convince my buddies to play, so I'm mostly solo. üòñ I've been helping a random guy I met on the game. He's still learning the ropes though. I could see 4v4 being a better scenario.
---
kandzi01. But return it back
---
My take is there is no "market" price.   Outside of folks gaming the market (who want to fleece ya) no one knows min/max sale prices.  So the dude kys was responding to was just as anecdotal.
---
And it looks like there are twice as many ranged categories as there are melee, so unless you want to change up your build, you've got 2X the chance of getting an appropriate melee weapon as you do an appropriate ranged one.
---
It will still be garbage most of time, but even this looks like it is favoring melee builds.
---
Yeah man me too .
---
Hotfix mt today also no fix annoying humming sound :(
---
That was a really fun little quest - I had so much fun taking my friends and then letting them go into the church alone for the surprise!
---
Now that I have seen the prices, I almost wish we could charge Legendary Scrip in our shops.
---
I received the same email
---
The vanilla one looks really cool on the brotherhood scribe uniform
---
Same with my BE Gauss rifle and extra set of t-60 Paint plans.
---
Nah. It's just me. I've been banned from PSN because of my name üòÇüòÇ
---
Can I have plasma pistol weapon mods to plz. Just copy and paste fallout 4's.
---
dude, at 400 everyone begged for more. at 600 hardly anyone does. at 1000, like 2 people max will ever give a crap. 
---
just do it Beth.  even 1k
---
Wtf. People i see sell fusion cores for that price
---
1 star weapons drop a hell of a lot more frequently that 3 stars though. Given that they probably want us mainly getting legendaries from trading and killing, and this is something to throw all the bad legendaries you get into, 20 one star weapons for 1 three star is a reasonable trade (not factoring in the number of 2 and 3 stars you may find and trade in, plus the 40 scrip you get in case you get a bad 3 star from the purveyor).
---
The answer is a clear yes. 
---
Just look back at all the game elevating mods created for other fallout/elder scrolls games. Some of those mods were out of this world better than what BGS had put into the game. 
---
The loudest shoutout i can possibly give to those spending their time to make games i already enjoy even better.
---
just make and scrap syringers until you unlock it. its drops their Damage resistance by 25%
---
two days ago I've seen LVL 50 3*AA LMG, for 300c, but couldn't check the other stars. Once it work (like with that bloodied handmade) and few minutes ago someone selling 3* instigating lever for 3k, but can't see the stars :(
---
this is now bugging me.This came up yesterday. I immediatly recognized it, but cant remember where. FO/4 ?????
---
stuff it I'm going home.
---
There are several games still online, you're right, but why can't there be an exit strategy? Simply saying that as long as the money is flowing it'll stay makes it feel like a hostage situation and less like a game.
---
Man I wish the legendary power armor was a separate category and not apart of the armor category.
---
I've noticed a difference fighting high lv super mutants with auto guns but outside of that not much else but I don't pvp either so couldnt talk on my hat subject
---
I play in third all the way zoomed out. Can we get this to lock? I'm sick of messing with my camera everytime I travel etc..
---
The Chameleon Mutation makes you go invisible any time you are not moving, even when standing, but the Chameleon Armor only works while crouched, but also keeps you invisible while moving slowly, I haven't really seen the weightless affect work since I have always used chameleon.
---
It's a bit like cragslist.  You can see what folks said, not the caps that actually changed hands or frequency of caps/item.
---
I would imagine they would make it a separate game mode, like adventure and survival maybe?
---
Let's usher in a society of hyper sensitive, emotionally unstable 'adults'. That person insulted me; censor the Nazi. This person said something offensive a decade ago; publicly shame that bigot. Somebody one shot me in survival pvp; nerf everything so I don't feel triggered Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
---
Thanks mate. It‚Äôs was a 2* VE 10mm Pistol but still I loved using it. It was n extremely fun Weapon and it sucks...
---
I have got that code on my PS4 4:8:2000 login not authorized and I just exited and logged back in.
---
Yeah thats what i do as well but the shooting is a little...off?
---
&gt;So you're telling me modders are better at programming Fallout than you are.
---
take a quick peek at the nexus and it should be obvious.
---
Do other players spawn inside the camp boundary? That's weird, since I always spawn outside of it and it's my camp
---
My understanding of the way VATS works is that the AP cost increases with the weight of the weapon. So, in addition to perks, make sure you build the weapon as light as possible to maximize your AP usage.
---
You have doors? 
---
I am going to need more build limit for those.
---
There are times I wish I wouldn't have invested myself in it and maybe this would all be moot. I avoided Diablo 3 for the "always online" piece but couldn't avoid this one. I absolutely feel you, though.
---
aha......standard part of my load out
---
but you get tons of useless 1-stars. These add up. I will happily trade a dozen Suppressing Dragons for a random 3-star roll.
---
Omg can‚Äôt revive you
---
I play melee. Though I do agree it takes a while to get use to. I also run twisted muscles so I've always attributed to the shitty aim to the negative effects of that serum
---
Well, the animosity isn't towards the Enclave per se (other than the pre war government and Vault Tec being dicks in general in this universe), in this case it's toward this jackwagon in particular.
---
&gt;high level shop owners set up right near vault 76.
---
I saw a bunch of those too. One guy had his machines filled with level 1-15 recon rifles for like 20 caps, leather armor pieces 10-20 depending on the mods, assorted low level legendaries he must have picked up from the wolf pack event for 5-25 caps, and incredibly reasonable prices on food, water, and aid items. 
---
Once I deplete my stockpile and have room for new stuff I plan on doing something similar. I have plans for a bunch of different under armors, so I'll make a variety with different buff to help people get a small stat boost right out of the gate.
---
It's limited by how much script you can make a day. Once we get through the initial sugar rush of having 1000 script to spend instantly, we will get 150 script a day and thus we can get 3 3\* weapons every 2 days.
---
I get what your saying mate. I‚Äôm just worried I could lose something way more valuable then the 2* VE 10mm Pistol. Thank you for explaining and that I‚Äôm not the only one..
---
melee is really just 1h and 2h. every thing else is window dressing for the most part.
---
Power armor needs love
---
At this point it's painfully obvious when they can't add a simple QOL feature to the perk cards
---
They said that before this patch it was supposed to be Nerf to what it is now, but a bugged kept it doing the 2x damage. According to this new patch, the current crappy damage is what is intended :(
---
Stab them with your indifference.
---
There are teams working on making private servers work, so even if Beth doesn't, it'll still be there later.
---
On ps4? I need it as well ill help
---
Sorry bro :( good luck
---
Last in looked it was all over the place and you don't know what the actual sale prices typically were, i.e. auction board history in ffxiv.  That's also going to be folks that really want something if they took the time to hunt the market sub and cording meet-up times.
---
Its a great direction to go in, but these would need to be uniform shapes for the vaccant lots. This way, there will be space for people to plop down in case the last one you were in is occupied and you'll login to a matching community. It could even be a way to revive factions.
---
A couple names I've thought of to call the feature.
---
"Provincial Locality Obtained Time-Shares" or P.L.O.T.S.
---
"Co-Operative Neighborhood Domestic Occupied Securities" or C.O.N.D.O.S.
---
Feeling lost. At Berkeley station, but can't get in...hmm
---
I'll have to check that out, thanks!
---
100%. Trust me, I'm all for better prices!
---
I see all of these posts about how people already have a fully modded backpack, while I‚Äôm still trying to get the first badges, poor me lol!
---
You can just give it to your mom, she‚Äôll make sure I get it. Thanks üòÇ
---
Omg so funny
---
Honestly, as silly as it sounds, if your spec is 1 handers, and you got that weapon, you could do some serious carnage with it.  I watched a video last night of someone with a rolling pin creaming all of west tek.
---
a very sad day indeed :( not sure what to do now, thats 15 perks that are now useless to me... hoping to get something usable with the legendary vendor
---
At least with this though we can decide if the 3 star we get back is a mele or ranged weapon or armor,  that right there takes a huge chunk of the random out. Plus even killing a 3 star legendary didn't guarantee a 3* drop so there is that too. Granted it would really great if you could pick the type  of ranged ie: rifle, shotgun, cryolater, etc. But it's a good start.
---
I was gonna say, hahaha herpetologist *bugged* but then I realized itd the study of reptiles and amphibians or something to that degree
---
Well yes... but there's a glitch with Explosive lasers and beam splitters. That's why people want them.
---
Perk card duel! Something like Magic The Gathering or maybe simpler like Triple Triad!
---
ZERO....I want business
---
sry my pc is doing weird shit, how should i down myself with healing factorr? :\_D
---
There are webs of discords that surround the game. You get into one, next thing you now you are a regular at five different ones.
---
You wanna PvP, you gotta gang up.
---
I‚Äôm an idiot, I didn‚Äôt realize this either.
---
I had to redo the way my build was after the tse nerf so I understand
---
I was hoping a legendary weapon I had would be able to have the effects rerolled... maybe down the line they'll have an option for that costing extra currency ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I love this idea so much
---
you definitely could, yes. I know it sucks, but keep the process I just described in mind whenever you're playing the game. try to press the reload key or mess with your inventory as little as possible. sell/scrap things *really* slowly.
---
other than that we're at the mercy of Beth's servers. what's worse is that these topics never get to the front page and the community managers seldom acknowledge the problem.
---
Isn't unarmed a separate category from 1h as far as perks go?  Or is there enough overlap to make them fairly much the same?
---
Im recently back into it and yes. It definitely is
---
I would settle for a homegrown fix but I guess the goal would be for a fully supported, single-player port once everything has wrapped up. The Steam news is exciting for everyone but the console folks. F
---
I saw one yesterday that was literally a single foundation block with a vending machine on it, a small generator on the ground powering it, and a stash box next to that. It was lazy AF, but he had marsupial serums for 200 caps so I wasn't going to complain. I bought all 13 of them and then immediately resold them for 350!
---
all it took was camp sale beacons, and potentially good deals.. and camp PVP protection
---
I didn't intend to come across like I was trying to be sarcastic or jerky, I was more attempting make players understand the sometimes long periods of time between the requests that are made and their resolution.
---
I split my time lately between fo 76 and fo 4 so I can catch up on the lore of fallout so I want 76 to make it.
---
I scroll this sub daily and weekly see the reoccurring "Bethesda took our money and doesn't care about players" post so I gave my viewpoint to help ppl understand that just because an issue isn't fixed in a week, it doesn't mean that Beth won't fix it.
---
No worries. Scorchbeasts are no problem at all, got them all the time at my old place.  I appreciated all the info and conversation. Happy Wanderings
---
Dumb question but how do I save so I can make my own edits?
---
I did not see it being built. It was already there
---
If you go unyielding you perk points are going to be crazy high. I only put 10 into agility and can sit in the middle of the eyebombs and they just float on by... until some asshole shoots them that is.
---
Damn near everything I see posted about the legendary vendor is rumor and speculation nonsense and frankly I am sick or hearing about it.
---
Having said that, my expectations could not be lower.     I basically expect it to be RNG without the hassle of having to fight enemies.   I basically expect to turn in all my  scrips, and get a three star pitchfork if I am lucky. If I am unlucky I expect to get a one star ghoul stayer's tire iron.
---
Fantastic!!
---
Ditto. Ammo has been selling like crazy, so I've moved a lot of what I usually carry back to the stash for the vendor, and now I'm having weight issues again. Having to run my crafting mats at levels too low for my comfort.
---
Even when it doesn't crash,  1 out of 3 times I don't get the loot anyway due to invisible corpse or disconnecting from the event, or dying at the wrong moment. Just don't spend the 1500 unless you can afford to part with it.
---
I suppose you are correct. But since unarmed is about 110% useless, I forget it exists.
---
I love this explanation for the random, I hope I'll remember it when I get something terrible from her! Great post, made me chuckle &amp; read it out to hubby (who doesn't play, but was also amused!)
---
Thanks! I don‚Äôt hear that very often, I truly appreciate it!
---
Ya it‚Äôs sad. Thanks for all the info mate it‚Äôs greatly appreciated. Cheers
---
I would feel guilty if I bought that for 400 caps
---
Oh, nice.  Yeah, I used to have one south of your location with the junk node.  Might consider moving there again.
---
Although, where I am now is centrally located, so I would miss that.
---
Yeah trying to get my son to come back and play too, but here's like...nope!
---
Mole Rats will come through hardwood and concrete floors floating in the sky so there's no escape.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the study of reptiles and amphibians XD.
---
Yes - this. I use my Black Diamond or my Instigating Ski Sword interchangeably. They work well for most enemies and are very light. I think I still have a legendary Assaultron Blade, but I don't use it - none of them that I've gotten have rivaled the damage of the Ski Swords.
---
Disconnected after leaving first player vending machine, dc'd again after fast traveling from same camp, and menus are still slow. 
---
Don't know what the maintenance was for but it doesn't seem to have helped my issues.
---
Only after months of constant patches - and losing their fanbase - and huge losses in profits
---
The sights are so ridiculously ass, but the overall design of the weapon is so much fun! The 10mm I‚Äôm using now was a gift from a higher level player that‚Äôs completely tricked out. Just gimme a fuckn red dot pls
---
I dont think we should be able to freely change bashing damage to explosive, but I do think we should be able to select an item, select a star, and reroll it into something else.  
---
I know some people that are set to play only selected armor pieces. I.e. a guy that roleplays a raider (a roleplayer, not a griefer!), and only accepts raider armor.  
---
It sucks he cant work to have his raider set the way he wants. It sucks that such people may get rolls much better than their current ones, but still can't use it because doesn't fit their character.  
---
There is nothing wrong with being able to set yourself on a path that has something to earn in the end. If you prefer gambling than work, its okay, you do you, but don't belittle people who prefer work than gambling please.
---
FYI you can use duplicate maps. Just wait a few seconds and you can ‚Äúdig‚Äù at the location again. I‚Äôve been running through camps and buying up everyone‚Äôs maps because they usually go for 25-50 caps each.
---
Oh ok , I‚Äôm Xbox
---
So close to a great joke, you saw my intention nonetheless hahaha
---
Trading an item + caps, or overpaying to get it.
---
 I grossly overbid on a chameleon sentinal BOS RA, just because it was exactly the piece I was looking for, and didn't want it to get outbid.
---
It popped up on my phone in the chrome app as news

I dont control Google

"Hirable Occupiable User Safe Environment" or H.O.U.S.E.

Maybe I'm just seeing outliers, but I've watched people with power fists and even boxing gloves (I'm assuming bloodied builds) rolling through the bunkers and other farm locations with ease.  Not relative ease, like 'I'm not even breaking a sweat' ease.
---
My melee guy is like level 8, so I don't understand what all the breakdowns are, so I may be categorizing things incorrectly.
---
I play on PC

I sell marsupial at 350 on PC, that's about it. Even speed demon is only 275

Haven‚Äôt found it yet but this is some helpful info!
---
I didn't get a download at all, so seems isolated to some users.
---
Don't forget 50 while aiming and 250 while reloading perks on legendary weapons
---
Like? Hope you aren't saying that Player Vending and Legendary Scrapping is " a lot more".
---
Lol all hail the modders.. they can do no wrong.. 
---
Your post is arrogant
---
Forever beta it will be
---
This is killer. Thanks!
---
Thank you brother ;)
---
Over-exaggerate much? It's a nerf, yes. But it wasn't that bad. If you have all 5 pieces you now have a 75% chance to dismiss 75% of incoming dmg. That's still a hell of a defensive weapon. So in essence 3 out of every 4 shots would be only hitting for 25% of it's dmg. I'm sorry, but I don't see this as a big deal. Is it worse now? Of course. But it was too good before, and this was a fair balance nerf from my view. And yes, I wear 5 Sentinel pieces myself.
---
How so? Could you demonstrate or give instructions on how to do it?
---
Thank you so much !!!!!
---
Aw yeah!
---
we already had random generation of mods for x01 on enclave bunker, and that shows what random means for BGS (calibrated shocks spawn %). I don't want to be pessimistic but i think that purveyor will be the huge let down...
---
If there not going to fix it properly then at the least give us a rejoin last server option.
---
&gt;Unless you place your vending machines inside your living room.
---
That where mine are located. I remodeled the main floor of my 6x6 brick manor so that all the crafting benches (except PA station) and vending machines are available, and there's a sign by the stairs telling people that there's a PA station and beds upstairs. Go up the steps and there's 2 small "hotel rooms", the PA station, and a door to the balcony where I've got all my instruments set up.
---
Nowadays we're spoon fed unfinished games. With a side of promises of it not being pay to win. But thats this generation.. In love with broken games. Expensive as fuck DLC. And making a player grind forever for a cosmetic outfit or making them pay real money for it.
---
Why, though? Why would you do this, both before and after?
---
I visited one with a keypad yesterday. I tried all the easy codes really hoping they would work .üòÇ
---
Understood, but a chameleon piece will break your weightless set, which makes the mutation not work....right? Or am I misunderstanding?
---
Sorry if I am, this is new to me :/
---
Could be. But I  kinda like playing with all the players, low and high level.
---
You can play the same character on adventure or survival so there won't be any wipes. No idea when it stops being beta though.
---
IF Bethesda wants to allow us to have quick swapping of perk sets, then you have a point.  I don't know that's something they intend to include.  If not, that's a pretty unfair categorization.
---
Also, swapping was pretty broken for the longest time.  That mod was pretty close to hopeless unless you knew how to deal with its limitations.  I didn't even consider trying to figure it out, and I'm a pretty computer savvy person.
---
I think it's been made easier now (I haven't looked into it too much, but I've heard it just got changed to be relatively user-friendly).
---
Yeah my friend lost her Furious 3 star handmade &gt;&lt; I can't imagine losing a weapon
---
Noted!!!
---
Thank you very much!
---
Oh, it‚Äôs RNG. I wanted mine to be 8008, and have been trying for weeks to place a door and get that code.
---
just wait, theyll have one to sell us in atomic shop eventually......
---
Yeah mutants with miniguns have always mowed me down either way lol
---
Side note: you may have to search for the blooms DURING the event. So trigger, leave the area to go search the closest spawns and collect. 
---
I may be wrong about this
---
Id love some pics, that sounds lovely. Had an idea for a sort of mini-mart vendor mall with a 'gym' next door for crafting and inspiration is gold.
---
It's language, not a live grenade. Deal.
---
Thats an actual challenge?? Thats kinda dumb. Especially if youre solo like me
---
Paging u/ladydevann
---
Awesome! That‚Äôs reassuring. I‚Äôll play tonight and see what happens.
---
Yes, lame. Hope Stash goes to 1000 soon.
---
Honestly not sure, It's a stack and its effected by ammosmith. I can check for you tonight/tomorrow when I free up. I'm thinking 18 or 24 tops? It does about 20% more damage I think?
---
I believe they said on the inside the vault today that it has been delayed.
---
You lived in a vault. Vaults have doors for a reason. The same reason my nice home has doors...to stay nice.
---
Console folks don't really have much of a choice, but Steam has 75% of the PC market share.  
---
It should up the player base considerably...and that's really what counts for everyone.  
---
I'd hazard we have 5 years minimum (and that's thinking Beth will flop on their next few releases causing financial crisis).  Otherwise, 10+ years with Beth and many more on private.
---
Oh yes! I have a folder of funny bugged pictures with a few 100 in it!
---
Fair play I didn't really put too much thought into that ;)
---
Read inside the vault from today, there is a photo of the vendor menu, you can choose to roll a 1, 2, or 3 star legendary for scrip, 3 stars come in 3 choices, armor, melee or ranged weapons for 60 (armor) or 100 (weapons) each roll
---
I have probably met and played with more people in the last 48 hours than in the previous 6 months of play time. Player vending and eliminating camp damage was a huge step in the right direction.
---
Seriously, I lowered my prices 3 times! Funny thing is: I sold 1 plan for 100c, so that guy/girl wandered the middle of nowhere and bumped into my camp. Nice to know I have random visitors!
---
I have deep pocket plans for everything ( I actually bought 2 from a vendorbot uesterday that I was missing, deep pocket leather limbs and one other I was missing). But they are specific to armour type, and there's limb and chest plans upon that.  In my store, I have deep pocket plans for all parts of combat armour, trapper, metal, robot, marine and I have leather chest plans.
---
I honestly hate that event
---
I could be wrong, but I didn't think food buffs stack.  For example, you can't eat a Ribeye Steak and Grilled Radstag to get +40 carry weight. One would cancel out the buff of the other.
---
It really does. Bethesda give it says me love
---
I agree.  Like you, I'm not sure it isn't a case of deliberate inconvenience.  They don't want you to instantly swap because, at least for a moment, they want you to be stuck with the choices you made.
---
wondering this as well. read on one of the wikis it exists, but cant for my life get it by scrapping
---
I think the best value is going to be the 2* ranged weapons. 50 scrip per chance and almost all the good perks are in the 2* range. B/E, aa/e, etc.
---
I only wish stash was the problem but selling items actually takes workshop budget meaning decorations etc. But I do agree that hopefully they will increase stash too.
---
That is likely what I will do, because I will then take any good roll and use it to trade on the subReddits.  I am more concerned about the quality of the roll than it‚Äôs type.
---
I would love to be able to leave feedback after purchases or see some sort of receipt of the sale
---
Go to the North West of Dewer (sp?) Chemical you will see a group of gulpers in the trees. At night you can/will find glowing flowers among the tree roots, I've found them without HotS running.
---
I'll totally be back when FO76 finally allows private servers, because stuff like this is cool as hell and it only gets better when you're playing with the same group of a hundred or so people rather than a randomized group every time you log on. I think this game would have been great if they would have committed to more of the fundamental tenants of the survival genre and not tried to carve out a unique sub-genre for themselves. Private servers with persistent camps that stick around after you log would be fantastic.
---
Are you familiar with private servers for other mmorpgs? Rarely does a game dissapear even after the official servers go offline.
---
You will not eat my tiny friendo!!!
---
Yes, has to be the Deluxe. It's a completely unique camera model from others in the game.
---
That really would show a supply and demand in the market that shifts
---
I‚Äôm positive it was an option in the chemistry workbench at launch, literally 100%. I remember see it and thinking ‚Äúwtf is that?‚Äù.  I must be wrong or have seen it elsewhere.
---
With reddit guildes u will have bag under 2hours.
---
TSE 10mm pistol for 800 caps  
---
Unyielding Sentinel chest for 600 caps  
---
Vanguard Sentinel leg for 150 caps  
---
also TSE Handmade for 15k, but that's fair
---
Oh please let there be a 3* shield drop one day with no warning!
---
Because people are scared of math
---
They also told us last week it was being delayed.
---
Implementing this requires under the hood, creating some kind of one to one chat service. A service that needs to scale. I dont really see that coming.
---
\- Get a mic and use it.
---
\- Don't be afraid to ask higher levels for advice and direction.
---
\- Always try to be decent to lower levels. and pay it forward when you can.
---
This kindness and camaraderie in this game will surprise you sometimes.   :)
---
God luck and have fun! :)
---
One of my top 5 requests. A game changer.
---
also, if you had the extended mag, the magazine covers up the gun sights
---
I will help you if you help me. Add ponderman and lets do this.

My low-tech solution to the want list was to put out one of the signs with pole that you could get free from the Atomic shop. I then used the small letters to write a message on the sign. I then put the sign next to my machine. I REALLY want one particular kind of armor (no, not sentinel or unyielding), so I tell people if they have it to message me.
---
Hopefully it works. I‚Äôve tried everything else I know.
---
I've asked on a ton of threads but can anyone recommend some viable builds for a returning player that has no idea whats going on anymore?
---
Something tweaked out on yours. Update was 6gb for me on xbox. Sounds like your game got deleted somehow. Or maybe it auto detected a corrupted file and reinstalled all of it?  Point is, this is not their standard practice anymore.
---
Haha I love this so much
---
I've actually been searching for Mr. Fuzzy tokens this way. I want that mascot outfit. I have all others that aren't atom shop.

I've now got a full set of Unyealding (various levels) and with +3 on my strength from each piece and being melee I can kill heavy hitters before they do damage, though as I'm so low health if I make a mistake I die... often, but +30 strength for my melee damage output is an alternative to high damage resist.
---
Any dweller is allowed to use my place as they wish. Mine is an open door policy, but that doesn't mean the door should stay open.

Read it. Taking it with a grain of salt because we don't know yet what they "forgot" to include in the patch notes this time.
---
Once you have your first one, sometime you'll find extra broken cameras laying around that can be fixed up.

I have 3 spares (I'm on PC, or I'd give you one) that I'm planning to stick in my vending machine eventually.
---
Your pointless downvotes are the icing on the anger cake.

You can sell pretty much everything except for quest items that can't be dropped. plans, ammo, maps, nuke cards, disease cures, and loose mats that could only be sold in bulk to the robots.

I loaded one machine with 100+ maps for 20-30 caps each (20 for forest toxic valley, 25 for ash heap and divide, and 30 for mire &amp; bog), and in less than an hour someone bought every single one of them. He also bought a T51 jet pack plan for 3k.
---
Servers just got back on and I was hoping it was one of the bugs that got fixed. It was not. Just played the Bass at Nuka Shine and got no credit.
---
Unless they made all these lines for nothing, it's what we're getting.
---
Speed demon gives reload speed already. There is also talons and twisted muscles for unarmed and melee damage.
---
Also this idea makes no sense. Melee users get nothing from reload speed and ranged users get nothing from melee damage.
---
It exists, I got one from scrapping. They take a while with the lever action bit it's there.
---
I think we need more effects that are decent. Like bashing or blocking? No ones going for that. Everyone wants AA TS B, and E or SS no one cares for the other effects.
---
It‚Äôll introduce some variety *especially* if those effects only are BiS for specific builds

Hahha, yes. I was thinking about this yesterday. And then I was like, "fuck do I really want paid advertisements in this game?"

Sometimes the game is just a dick. Enemies literally spawn *inside* my house very often on one of my alts. I'm gonna have to relocate him eventually. His door and walls are pointless.

You sure you have enough stash space? Should be same as fermenter. The vending machine itself takes up budget while the items take up stash. If not enough stash space you'll get an error saying not enough budget, but it's stash it needs.
---
I usually get a couple within 3-4 server hops (night, dusk or dawn) at the Dyer chemical plant. I go once every couple weeks, including the other day.
---
Lots of plans and recipes I didn't have.  Being practically given away.  Some pretty rare ones, too.  :)

&gt; In September 1986 senators supporting the ballistic knife ban attached their bill to popular legislation designed to eradicate drug crops in foreign countries and halt international drug trafficking operations. The bill was subsequently enacted into law.
---
I'm not of the opinion that ballistic knives should be legal, I don't know where I stand on that. This shit pisses me off, though - and should be illegal.
---
Rolling Pin as main weapon.
---
Same. Since the update, super mutes spawn right in front of my camp. Before they walked up from some distance, coming from the satellite yard.
---
Dude you don't have to gatekeep other players because they didn't want to spend 60 dollars, or if they did, continue to play a game that was straight up broken. Bro-ken. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but it's perfectly reasonable for people to not have played this. I don't know the idea just rubs me the wrong way for some reason.
---
Its not stash. I have over 100lbs free and the error is workshop budget. I will screenshot and post.
---
I was only using the workshop as a guideline for an estimate of the water cap. I know from personal testing that an industrial water purifier (rated at 60 units/hr last time I checked) will not get even 1/4 that rate. In the area I was anyway. That's obviously with it being emptied regularly to avoid downtime from a full storage.
---
I found I was more successful just server hopping. I went to the Water Park. Checked the orange car in the parking lot and just server hopped until he popped up.
---
Yeah I want to try to do 1-2 badges a day with 6-8 hours of play, I should be finished in a few weeks!
---
yes Bulstorm gave me a hand and i/ve to say at least one of you need a mic trying to coordinate with thumbs up and hearts it's not the top
---
Rightly so too, I was once attacked by a 6 times table.
---
I have two turrets that do a fair job. They rattle-bang all night and hardly evoke a friendly space.
---
It would be nice if the item levels are scaled off of the player‚Äôs level as well. Kinda sucks when, at lvl 95, I get a 3 star combat armor that is only level 20.
---
I really want to visit your bear shop! I've been slowly collecting the bears but I only have a few! I have a little Teddy Fear and a Rad Bear but I'm hoping for maybe a Quantum friend &lt;3
---
Could you send me a message on Xbox so I can drop by after work when you're on?
---
I've been thinking that, in some ways, that's the point.   They didn't provide more stash space, despite adding player vending, but they allow you to conveniently carry more on your person.
---
True, vending machine space not being part of budget would be huge.
---
Happened once with chems; the bigger plague would be the infinite black screen on fast travel and respawns during events

What do you meant by different timer?

Dope!! Ill add u tonight!

It's not all bad tho, they finally can communicate in English, and it sounds like china isn't invading Appalachia anymore since it belongs to the super mutants.
---
The machines give scrips, she gives legendaries.  Buying a legendary does not sound like it will refill the machine.
---
In addition to what Orange\_Colored\_Sky said, I was using them because my shed's backed up to a cliff and it won't let me snap full walls through the terrain. So it's currently backless until this is fixed. =P

I must've server hopped at least 30 times before finding my tourist.
---
I like this type of content. Thanks for sharing. Can you reformat the table to make it easier to understand? 
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll always be taking the mystery pick.
---
But if you are, wouldn't the other players be seeing these same plans? In other words, the plans themselves matter, too. No one is gonna buy a plan for a metal bed.
---
I've tamed:
---
*  Babbity Rabbity (level 1)
---
* Danny the Deathclaw (level 20)
---
* Gaston the Snallygaster (level 20)
---
* Speedy the Sloth  (level 20)
---
Babbity, Danny and Gaston lasted a day before getting killed. Speedy lasted like 4 days and then just disappeared (no death, logged off at my camp with him there, then opened it up that evening and he just wasn't there). Still haven't gotten over the heartbreak of losing Speedy

I found the door last night but I swear it was boarded up Tuesday evening.

I paid 5k yesterday. I was only missing the sausage.

Awesome! My PSN is pwincesspiper

Ill send u an invite later today!

Still not seeing a difference.
---
I'm confused, what's the problem?

For armor it is 3 / 9 / 24, for weapons it is 5 / 15 / 40.

As annoying as this is, I'm glad I'm not going crazy.

Good job man! You get my upvote and don't pay attention to haters!

What platform are you on? PC has a FOV setting, but I don't know if its also on consoles.

Here is the screenshot.
---
Explosive damage was nerfed on shotguns, not all weapons, in this last update.
---
I have the C.A.M.P. a vending machine 3 feet from it and my stash box next to a sleeping bag
---
In build mode, look at a placed door, water purifier, resource collector and you should see the option to lock it.
---
So that's why I can't even make a cool looking "store", because the items for sale are double-counting against my stash space AND my workshop budget? Wow... just. wow.
---
Level 3 of Wasteland Whisperer and Animal friend give you the option to tame some random spawn creatures that will go back to / protect your camp. However they are not invulnerable and can die / do not respawn.
---
Did it still not fix after the maintenance?
---
I'm getting downvoted for saying that this game, which is known as being broken and buggy, at some points doesn't work. At some points, this game 5 fps, crashes constantly, and is always stuttering. I love this game, but I cant ignore this.
---
It's a load of bull that they would steer you wrong like that, but don't have a cow, man. Perhaps the trick is finding a legendairy brahmin.  Regardless, if you have a beef with the challenge you should definitely report it ; perhaps Bethesda hasn't herd about the problem yet.
---
ah ha :D its always the simple things lol
---
Yeah man, good luck with it, keep me updated when you release it!
---
Xbox one. Consoles dont
---
That sounds more like they're adding a battle royale vault than the whole Nuclear Winter thing being a battle royale, but you're the dataminer.

Would this be related to the 16 player deathmatch they talked about before release?
---
Pretty much üôà
---
Doing that atm lol, the things this game makes me doüòÑ
---
Folks are so caught up in 'perfect endgame loot' they lose sight of just having fun with what you find. I personally like carrying my 1* Anti-Armor LMG or 10mm SMG, but if I find a new melee or ballistic weapon I'll swap out my cards to give it a go. Gotta enjoy the moment and keep things interesting.
---
I think you should auto moderate. It's silly for someone to ask other people who they don't know whether they should come back to a game they already own, which they can turn on and play to see for themselves whether they like it enough to keep playing.
---
As for updates to the game since they quit, they can search and/or read Bethesda's patch notes and newsletters. Then they are better equipped to ask specific questions about new content, rather than generalized questions about whether they should come back.
---
That's dismissive of the point of my post and a little rude. I care a lot about the series and not losing a piece of it is of importance to me but if you wish to go nihilistic about it then nothing matters at all so why bother responding to some guy on the Internet? :) 
---
I'm passionate about many things, this being just one of them, so why not try to affect meaningful change if you can?
---
You know what they say, don't bring a \_\_\_\_\_ to a knife fight.

Like every few kills there what I can only describe as green or blue smoke. Like there is no graphic loading when something should

How much would a nuke card go for?
---
The cost of the new random legendaries is extremely reasonable. I honestly expected 3 stars to be hundreds of scrip. Can‚Äôt wait to start hitting the slot machine!
---
75% chance to instantly remove a problem seems pretty good actually. They even nerfed one of them because you could pacify the queen, apparently.
---
It would take a genius to make the pacify perks work in a damage build. Maybe a stealth melee user? Pacify, walk behind, 3x damage? That's kinda like using an Illusion dagger user in Skyrim. Pacify, walk behind, insta-gib.

That sucks

I have it on my Lever Action and yes it provides the highest damage number per shot. I recommend crafting level 25 guns with Super Duper active and throw on a cheap mod before scrapping - also boost your Int.

I will, I think I currently have 14 Quantum Bears left, so you‚Äôre in luck. I raised the prices because they were selling so fast at a Cap a piece, but I‚Äôll give you one for free! I‚Äôm at work as well, so I‚Äôll be on closer to 7pm PST! What‚Äôs your gamer tag?

It‚Äôs either floor decor or appliances I believe. It cost a few aluminum and some circuits if I remember correctly

Why is that a bad thing? A nuke went off. It makes sense lore-wise and mechanically that you'd need full body protection, a backpack giving you full rad resistance is just silly. If there were no tradeoffs, what's the point?

Rider bills are a fucking cancer, whether individually positive or not.

I honestly don't think I hit the downvote button faster in my life.

9 is definitely scared of 7.

What glitch?

everyone has the same cookie cutter perks anyway. I think of this game like I think of runescape. BiS is the same for everyone.

Please don't take me seriously. I didn't mean it to sound so dismissive, and was quantifying it x-post.

Yes, A switched pylon

What perks should I use?

Thank you! I found one underneath power connectors, but it didn't look like the correct one.
---
So putting things in your machines costs extra budget?
---
Everyone wants text chat. It's absolutely fucking moronic they decided to launch with "mouth breathers only" as the sole communication option in this game.
---
Treasure maps for 0 caps :-D
---
I have bloodied knuckles that do 724 with full unyielding armor and a instigating power fist that does 712 base damage with the same armor so probably 2848 with a sneak attack ?
---
I was really disappointed when I realized there was no mod for suppressor I had made a secret agent type character as an alt and wanted to use that as her close-mid range option to backup her sniper rifles.

[](/ce10)After this last update that took megasloth off both wasteland whisperer, and animal friend my pet megasloth just disappeared. Anyone have the same issue?
---
This happens to me on ps4 every so often but with red smoke.
---
You're assuming you get 33% chance of melee, ranged, or armor.  I don't know if that's correct or not.  Datamining might be able to tell you, but right now we have nothing to base that one.
---
Rough count, there are 48 ranged weapon types, 48 melee weapon types, and 100 armor types excluding power armor (going off relatively sketchy wiki information).
---
So it's entirely possible that the mystery pack will award on average 50% armor and 50% weapons.
---
is a weapon mandatory? no but they help
---
its just like another armor peice, there is variation between the mods to fit different builds.
---
  need a DR boost? add armored.
---
going farming for flux? refrigerated
---
legendary farming? high capacity
---
Is always on in your camp, doesn't need power. You only power it to show it on the map. Only 1 has to be powered if you want players to see you on the map
---
Depends if you know specifically what to search for. For example, how many stages in a grand tour? 7, 14, 21 or 28.

According to Google which is fixated on the Tour de France. It has 3 stages *pulls hear out* üòÇ

That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.

Nah don't worry, it's a little over the top. I mean I love Fallout too, but god damn.

I could literally kill it naked with my fists no offence.

Mine is (and has been for a while) in the woods in the upper NW near Groves Family Cabin. Lucky shoppers who visit my camp may get the bonus of triggering Free Range when they visit. My teammates and I often trigger it when we FT to my camp.

This depends on the Scrip you give to the Purveyor returning to the pool at exchange machines. If it worked like that, it would make a huge difference.

Was your mother a robot apologist?

Where you spawn is based on where your CAMP device is, and you can move the device to change were you land. 
---
Team mates spawn where you very first set your camp device down when you claimed your location. It seems like when other people visit you, it's where you very first set it down.
---
Bethesda should make rare limited backpack skinns to really set you apart from fellow dwellers in fallout 76 but thees rare skins should be unable to be dropped and should weigh 0 and should become a high value trade item amongst others dwellers but the skins shoud be made available form time to time agen

I could literally take no offense from this weird flex.

There's a mod for that on PC, but they do need to add an official text chat.

Double barrel shotguns are a PIA to reload, if it was a combat it would have gone fast.

I have had a few times where I, as well as all other players/enemies around me are covered in a pink/purple haze...and then my game crashes.

*G o d  r a y s*
---
Its like they've added a new equipment slot . . just like you can choose to wear a helmet or body armor or be butt-naked, its up to you.
---
Backpacks are not homogenized, you can get a backpack that increases resistances or increases carry weight or makes food spoil more slowly. I'm sure they'll add even more types of backpacks in the future.
---
yes they did not fix anything after the maintenance!
---
I have no issue with items I am selling taking stash space of course. I just dont think we should have to delete decorations to display them on a digital screen on the vending machine. Its not like the items are actually ‚Äúon display‚Äù.
---
I find them aesthetically unappealing.
---
The carry weight doesn't offset my distaste enough for me to use them. (Until they release fannypack or sloth versions)
---
No big deal, friend. I see what you meant now but I appreciate the follow up! I use the heat death argument *all the time* so it's nice to see others doing it, too. lol
---
No one wants that garbage anyway lol.
---
Sounds crazy lol. If you saved a video of it you ought to upload it for us.
---
The only way to prevent people from purchasing from them is to store them. Even unpowered you can still buy from them but your camp will not appear on the map.
---
Yeah if someone's on a marked cliff area I wear power armor before I FT there or walk onto any suspended areas in case of this exact thing.
---
...add crystals to that list as well. My explosive cryolator is hungry.
---
yes
---
You can't be serious.
---
I can think of nothing more fitting the hyper capitalism of fallout than paid advertisement
---
Amen on the text chat, I‚Äôm so tired of not being able to have a nuanced conversation or to understand if someone is having mic or PC issues.
---
They probably sell that fast because one of the possum challenges "collector" asks you to gather some (or more) of them. Handy thing youre already a collector.
---
If the anti armor is only a 1 star, then I'd go with the furious
---
I mean... it could be like everything else and we only interact with the automated ZAX system that remains and the vault dwellers are all dead or mutated in some way.

TBH, I just ran through the exams, got 75% of them right on first try, only had one that required 3 tries at 4/5. No googling or reading these threads involved.
---
Y'all need some more exposure to the real world.
---
If you still need help in 8 hours when I get home from work, I'll help.
---
I'm ready for some more visual options as well. I was hoping mods might change the appearance but I don't believe they do at this point.
---
I think a better one would arachnid: briefly cling to vertical surfaces, allowing a second jump, but take 15% more damage.
---
Caps already are worthless to most really high level players. You can rarely buy really good weapons and armor for caps anymore. That method does work but you are spending caps to make them. Much more profitable for new players to grind it out and make caps at zero cost. Lazy folks will always be willing to make caps the easiest way possible even if it costs them half their daily vendor limit to do it.
---
Fantastic idea, upvoted both.
---
Yeah, this guy was level 23, and obviously trying to do big on vending. üòÇ
---
If you're on Xbox, I'd love to help you hunt down food recipes and grandma-y things.
---
Not every time, from my experience it is mostly total RNG sometimes i get two times then six times nothing.
---
Yeah, now that I have some spare time after grinding out getting backpack, I'm going to test out some outfits and find which one I like best.
---
Some modded ones have drawbacks. My 120 carry weight high capacity one has -60 Energy and Radiation resistance, so I'm taking a lot of rad damage now with it on (totally worth it though.)
---
I got the one from the atom shop. Looks really cool. But I agree and they will definitely do that I‚Äôm sure
---
From a functionality perspective you are correct.  Although a 3* trades better.   But you‚Äôve given me something to mull over.
---
Ok thanks bruv
---
No problem!
---
Guess we'll find out, but I would assume that like with legendary items earned via missions or challenges that it levels to your character.
---
You‚Äôll probably get more out of the anti-armor one.

The lvl 40 glowing radstags that attack my base would love to mosey on over to your base.

I've avoided hitting max caps by buying every single camp decoration plan in Studio 58, every weapon and armor plan that's even remotely useful (I like to pimp everything out before selling it), and now I'm buying a serum recipe every time I hit 18k.
---
Yeah I've never gotten anything good from them myself tho
---
Gotcha yeah that‚Äôs what I figured but still thank you for the info really awesome
---
The last part is a jumping puzzle. (just want to skip it)

Yes it does give the most damage, at least out of all the ones I have (and I probably have all of em, cause I kept scrapping to get the suppressor)

I Fast Traveled to a camp yesterday that spawned me inside the camp and all the doors were locked and the vendor was outside so I didn't have a choice but to sit down for tea and hope I wasn't skinned and worn as a costume by end of visit. :|

Gimme the badges!!
---
I think you should be able to spend a quarter of the cost on a preview but pay more to buy it.
---
Vending is my main source of income because it isn't limited to 1400 caps a day. I have been making 5-10k a day and clearing out the vendor the good old fashioned way by shooting and looting. There are plenty of methods to making caps fast doing that.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I wonder if her inventory quantity is finite per day and you have to wait 20 hours for each thing to restock.

She seems to be wearing yellow flower-patterned gloves. That said, they seem to be fingerless as her fingers seem to be a more natural dirty-mutated-pale-skin color.

The haze is a marker from one of the Mentats that highlight living things. Sometimes in parties or events if one player uses it others get the ability.
---
When an installer puts files on your system, it creates a log file where it lists everything that it puts on your system.  When you uninstall, it takes that list, and uses it to remove the files it installed.  (this is somewhat simplified, but it's roughly correct)
---
If you *move* all the files the installer put in, the uninstaller has no idea what you did with all the files, and it won't be able to uninstall them.
---
Plus, in many, many cases, the game settings have pointers to where specific files are located (based on where they were installed), and again, if you move those files, the game wont' be able to tell where to look for those.  Things like your display settings, save file locations (not applicable here), your cache files, all those will be 'lost as far as the program is concerned.  Sometimes it can recreate certain files on the fly (though you will lose any customization you made), but for other files it just can't load them if it can't see them, and the game won't run.
---
Best case, put everything back where it was.  Worst case, you'll have to manually remove them, and reinstall from scratch.  If the installer doesn't create a sub-folder for you to put all the files in, make one yourself and point the installer to that.
---
tl;dr you dun fuked up

A mic, emotes, and console chat isn't enough?

They need to increase cap limit stash limit and camp budget I dont like having a small shop and u cant use alot of the cool stuff cuz it takes up so much budget
---
Yeah, at least down to rifles, pistols, unarmed, etc. These are the things we make our builds around which would make the rewards a lot more viable.
---
if thats a TSE gauss with 250DR or was heavily dupped the last wave.  may of been someone who the ban wave missed, or someone who purchased a few and is trying to resell.
---
that TS fatman though....not popular and not something that woulda been heavily duped
---
I sold a couple thousand of them last night for 2 caps each. People will gladly pay that rather than farm all the mats.
---
Noted, thanks. =)
---
Ye the HDR has no settings on fallout 76 xbox which is shitty. And the base HDR we get is shit.
---
But thats just how it works.
---
if everyone is special, no one is
---
2 caps per bullet??
---
&gt;IF Bethesda wants to allow us to have quick swapping of perk sets, then you have a point. I don't know that's something they intend to include. If not, that's a pretty unfair categorization.
---
I see no reason why they wouldn't want us to have this. If that was the case then the mod for PC wouldn't be allowed.
---
As far as the mod being broken I can admit I know nothing about that. I just see a lot of post referring players to the mod when questions about perk card swapping are brought up. I believed it to be a good mod. I may be wrong but as a PS4 player I have no way of knowing.
---
However I tend to lurk on here when I should be working and I've seen no post indicating problems with that mod.
---
If your talking about the race challenge at the east end gorge bridge, it‚Äôs not the obstacle course on the nature trail. Go to the top side of the bridge on the east side. In the far left lane is the little speaker box that starts the race. Hope you‚Äôre not afraid of heights.
---
Then why are you lurking on the sub? Seems real odd to me.
---
Damn it I play on ps4 :(
---
Im n the UK and wasn't on all day and it was down, luckily I knew what was happening but it's not a good excuse
---
My experience is that Bloodied is a rewarding, fun, and challenging play style and I would highly recommend experimenting with it.
---
Mine is PVE only build.  SPECIALS are spec'd as (S-6 P-11 E-5 C-6 I-10 A-9 L-9) a generalist.  After experimenting with some unexceptional bloodied melee a bit I've found that bloodied is so OP for PVE that your armor selection is secondary and can be specialized.  No need to limit yourself,  I have 3 sets that I'm using:
---
\-Unyielding BOS, all ultralight.  This set has nice carry weight, but requires full Sneak and low health to work well.  This used to be my main set, but now I'm not sure if I'll keep this since accumulating upgrades to the Weightless set.  
---
\-Weightless BOS with +1 Strength on all; Densified and ultralighted.  Really enjoy this set; plus it doesn't need Sneak card and health can run closer to 50%  It's light enough to carry with me.  High Quality of Life factor.
---
\-Troubleshooter's BOS- exclusively for those EZPZ solo Nuke Launches, all ultra-lighted for stash storage and AGI.  
---
\-PA Yep, required for nuke zones and carrying that all that great s\*\*\*t back home!  
---
I have mostly opted for the ultra-light builds to cut storage weight and help with VATS and moving fast. 
---
I'm still looking for a Bloodied ranged weapon, but use a Bloodied meat hook and \*\*Bloodied Knuckles +40SS to complement my Instigating Sniper rifle.   The knuckles are OP for those ghoul mobs, and the mobs are the only weakness for bloodied, as you may know.
---
Melee Mutations are required to make this work well, and don't forget Electrically Charged for those mobs.  Ranked up Serendipity also keeps you from dying as often, and Gun Fu helps to quickly dispatch those said mobs quickly.  If using Weightless, switch Sneak for Adrenaline and enjoy your new super power!   Make sure you keep Escape Artist equipped though, since its your invisibility cloak.
---
Your Build:
---
With bloodied weapons, I would move some Luck to Agility to increase your stealth and support VATS and allow the use of Gun Fu and Adrenaline, both of which leverage bloodied or other high dps weapons.  Having not played a Min-Max build myself, I cant comment on quality of life issues, but I cant help but believe that it would be difficult at best, and certainly restrictive if solo play is your thing.
---
Yeah I said most because there are times they don‚Äôt agree.
---
I am, I played Ultima Online for years on private servers. My ultimate hope for 76 would be a migration to a single player standalone to be played alongside the other entries without the need for an internet connection.
---
I have one of the supposed camera spawn points near my camp (south of Whitespring near a fissure) and it never spawns here. Been checking every time I go to camp, server hop, etc. Get tons of fun random encounters just no camera yet.
---
Asking the real questions!
---
Regular TS are awful
---
Agreed but adding a visual digital display of items on your vending machine shouldn‚Äôt take workshop budget.
---
We r getting double counted for those items.
---
Are the rolls going to scale with player level? Getting a level 15 crossbow would be pretty lame :/
---
Then again, killing 50+ enemies doesn't always net a 40+ drop so it would at least be consistency from BGS...
---
Sorry fren. I considered double dipping, but it's just too expensive. :/
---
I don't need Cannibal, between Good Doggy, and the Carnivore Mutation, Spoiled meat, and Dog Food easily keep me well fed.
---
I only use Enforcer when I'm using my Shot Gun in Blast Zones, all other times I'm dedicated to Stealth Perks.
---
I do run the Rifleman Perks, but only at level 1 on all 3 for 30% vs 9 points for 60% at max level
---
Demolition Expert, Starched Jeans, and Class Freak are on all the time.
---
Honestly it's more fun. The only time I'll pay for something is if it is something really rare that I really really want. Though with this update selling is fun so I might start spending more to give me more motivation to want to sell.
---
Remember, more AGI=better sneak
---
It should take up stash not budget. I have plenty of friends with full builds that have 4 vending Mach with full inventory
---
Kind of sounds like shit to me
---
Cool! I‚Äôll check it out.
---
2000 lbs.
---
People gotta complain about something. If you find it to be an issue, don't use the damn thing.
---
I'm not surprised. The people that frequent this sub, much less the trading communities are a tiny fraction of the user base. The average casual player is probably looking at some of these prices and wondering WTF we're thinking.
---
The vending machine should have separate weight than the stash box
---
We've known for a long time that the Modders are better at programming than Bethesda, lol. Look at what they did for Fallout 4. They fixed most of the issues with that game and those issues STILL made it into Fallout 76.  They are going to drop the "ball", just like they've been doing since this wreck set sail. I will give them the benefit of the doubt though. The team that worked on this game is the "C Team" when it comes to Bethesda games and its showing.
---
Begone thot
---
&gt; I don't bite unless you ask me to
---
Oooh. Kinky.
---
I would love to have more friends too; I'm on PC but I don't play very regularly because of work. But I'm going on a longish vacation and that may change so keep it open if you'd like. IGN: SoleSurvivorABS
---
Yeah, but by picking the mystery one, you have 2x the chance of getting a drill or syringer.
---
At least with the 100 ranged pick, I only have to worry about syringers.
---
ooh i went to the general vendor
---
Low health in exchange for high damage. Seems like it was designed with a pre-existing nerf
---
Is it the goofy looking one like the terminal near the vendor in flatwoods?
---
I crashed trying to enter yesterday
---
I need too if you guys are still available
---
disadvantage is if you have the base backpack on  and are at the max wieght and put on PA you loose all effects of it so will become slowed down so you have to loose the protection so you can walk again
---
I hunger for *ground molerat pierogies*.
---
lol get rekt
---
So everyone can be OP in every scenario? nah, leave that for single player. i get the annoyance because its a deck building mechanic, but its an rpg really. Changes to your stats should happen slowly.
---
18. The perk increases crafted ammo count by 80%.
---
Weightless rifles have really bigger price than some 2* trash :D
---
sorry wasn't home, but ima bout to hop on now. 
---
and i'll return it, im not a dick lol
---
This is adorable and i love it.  
---
I wish you were on PC so I could see the store  though 
---
On my first character I have/had a lot of Mr Fuzzies and Bears.
---
the last patch did this for turrets, which was quite annoying, but this one I guess its for anything not connected to the ground?  (mr Gutsys do still work)
---
I get the Turrets one, you could use it to break out of the map, and in the silo skip a portion, I'd prefer they fix it another way, but sure.  but now we can't target any of the flying creatures?  That's what I needed to target the most!
---
Please fix!!! (and fix the turrets as well, fix the silos another way and let us jump to turrets again!)
---
Gottem
---
What the devil are you talking about?  Unarmed is arguably the best.  It tends to do more damage out of the gate, and Iron Fist only consumes 3 SPECIAL points instead of the 9 points that Slugger/Gladiator need to max out.
---
The only disadvantage Unarmed weapons have is that they are incompatible with Power Armor.  So, if you live most of your life in a Nuke Zone, sure, it's not the best choice.  And if you fight the SBQ, you rely on someone leaving Drop Site V9 out of the blast radius.
---
Explosive is a secondary effect, so there's no way to have explosive weapons without another effect like bloodied, mutant slayer, etc.
---
Hey, stop making a fucking gun with a few mods 25 lbs.
---
....... i regret getting just to the end..... as you say that.
---
(spent two days here)
---
Camp McClintock - upstairs
---
My 336dps TS Gauss would like a word with you.
---
You say that but you could kill me by looking at me funny.
---
I took a photo of a mongrel and it didn't count for me
---
It‚Äôs funny because I actually have a Bar CAMP and haven‚Äôt converted it to a Teddy Bear store yet, which is my current goal for tonight. Location scouting and CAMP decorating haha. I‚Äôll see you then!
---
I'm on and off myself, so no big. I'll shoot that req
---
A 10% tax on 330 caps would leave you 297 caps... I thought engineers knew math?
---
Many of these things dont stack together.
---
Thank you for this bro
---
2 days ago I would have laughed at that, but now that you can over-repair the grog axe I would take that offer in a heartbeat.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I told you that because I spent 2 hours yesterday doing the same thing looking for a start box there.
---
Just fast travel away if you get ‚Äútrapped‚Äù
---
Go on then. Ign mickhyde
---
Wrong, the mutation still works, whether it was intended to or not I couldn't say, but it definitely still works, I have 2 complete sets of Armor I use regularly, One is all weight reduction pieces, and the other is all Sentinel's, each set includes one Chameleon piece, and no weightless pieces, yet I go invisible as soon as I stop moving, always.
---
Wait...do you drive a choo-choo train?
---
Still works with no power..
---
I have one unlocked so people who come by can grab some. 
---
Also, if you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôd gladly build you some large purifiers.
---
...wow. Read the updates.
---
That makes a lot of sense. I‚Äôll need to get more if demand keeps going the way it‚Äôs been lol
---
His reward pool better be made of actual useful items, because otherwise he is going to be almost pointless. I mean in a day you can earn 200 scrip, that's worth of two rolls on 3 star item, what are the chances you actually getting something useful? Same bad as we have right now with everything else. 
---
With purveyor they had chance to remove some of this bs RNG- Bring X amount weapons, with Y major perk to unlock Y perk on Z weapon. Then you bring X amount weapons, with C perk, to unlock that perk on your Z weapon. And once you are done building the weapon you cash it out from purveyor. Sure, the grind aint the best method, but it sure does more sense than RnG, with chance of 0.0000003%. Not a mention such grind would have given some value back to caps.
---
I'm on Xbox or I'd join you! Good luck out there!
---
It says it does, but it doesn't. I filled 4 vending machines to the max and it didn't dent my budget
---
The food buffs don't stack (like +like). You can use deathclaw OR stinging steaks for 2 strength and ribeye OR radstag for +20 carry weight. I think the drinks that add strength also do not stack anymore.
---
It does. Without many options in receivers the hardened is hands down, the best for the lever.
---
Hopefully I'll be able to get on sometime tomorrow. Looking forward to exploring with you. What level are you btw?
---
+karma
---
Does this really work? What about sleeping?
---
completely randomized..keep scrapping
---
You can‚Äôt if the turrets hit you
---
It‚Äôs currently a Bar at the top of Seneca rocks but I‚Äôm gonna do some location scouting and make it nicer and more like what you‚Äôd expect haha. That‚Äôs my goal for tonight after work!
---
Or... or.... hear me out. We communicate with the dev's on things we have issues with and often they agree with us and change it.
---
They...haven't done  a patch, and if anything's been proven, they _don't do patches_ you're going to be waiting at least two weeks. 
---
Of course it's still fucking bugged.
---
No. It‚Äôs more like the ones in the train stations
---
Awesome!
---
Got mine today. Could t agree more, that feeling of acomplishment is amazing. I am looking forward to doing possum achievment next.
---
Maybe nobody is willing to admit some programmer put Stimpack Diffuser instead of Stimpack Diluted.  That sort of makes sense?
---
Get a full set with that prefix..it stacks
---
I agree. There are a plethora of "joke weapons" in melee that make up an inordinate number of the Legendaries you find for it.  Guitar Swords, Walking Canes, Death Tambos, etc.
---
u/Lumpymoose00
---
Will be on in 10-15min,
---
You also need help for the quest part?
---
Nothing but team chat works for me anyway, because...i don't know, general incompetence when designing the system as a guess.
---
If the effects do nothing for DPS you‚Äôre better off putting it in the legendary vending machine.
---
You need to wait till the name shows up on the camera.
---
I actually found a vendor bot mod for sale for the lever action hardened receiver last night, but didn't buy it, lol
---
I've unlocked every mod for a lot of the rifles, so didn't think it would sell very well.
---
Upvoted because I agree AND We will all come to outlive our brains.
---
what about super mutant hounds?
---
Need help still?
---
I have a perfectly preserved pie for 10000
---
we're looking for vertibot, not cargobot
---
Most bloodied builds run round with less than 50 hp.
---
Two smacks from a ghoul, goodnight. 
---
Have you tried shooting them? Lmao
---
The cost of the attempt to get a 3 star you want is 60. The cost if you like it is 100 ;). Anyways I'm fine with it cause yeah it would get boring quick if I could just get the exact one I wanted (to be fair all I really want is an instigating hunting rifle - or another rifle that would make a good sniper).
---
Sounds like you scrapped it already!
---
But you see, I don't have an issue with it. Everything has some kind of disadvantage. Want to vendor. Well its gonna cost you camp space. Deal or continue using forums.
---
If on XB, I can attach any/all mods for the lever.
---
You could he right but if your camp budget is maxed then you cant place items for sale. I know that much.
---
This is exactly why you should sell shit like TSE in-game now instead of in market subs.
---
So many people think TSE is the best, and that poor guy you robbed from is going to be so disappointed. Market subs are too informed to fool like that.
---
He's not wrong happened to me
---
Yep! Just sent you a PM.
---
Yup. To quote Forrest Gump, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a smart man.‚Äù At least not when it comes to making doors connect to my walls. Other stuff, easy. Doors? Who needs them? If they don‚Äôt want to attach to my structure then I‚Äôll stick with my one open wall method instead then. Could google it, but meh.
---
As long as I can turn off the chat display. Always hated other people's conversations popping up on screen in online games.
---
Always in the creek bed by Dyer Chemical.  I never go specifically when Heart of The Swamp is active.  Just random checks.  Sometimes they're bloomed, sometimes pods, sometimes nothing at all.  I've never noticed a higher success rate coinciding with HoTS
---
will you be posting pictures to the settlement subreddits?
---
I have full sent/ass gear.And a good weapon to reply.But that HM just perfor me.A simple bl one.So what is fun.All ppl run after em:too easy. And  that guy told me "i have the best weapon in game" naa wrong üòà
---
Hi! Lots of good feedback in this and other threads on this, I'm going to bring this up with the devs for discussion. Thank you!
---
Considering her inventory will give you a random legendary- it's going to be hard to get those exact pieces but good luck hunting them down! Get that scrip!
---
stop nerfing everything to the ground, jesus. have you thought that maybe, just maybe, *you*'re the problem?
---
because I can **guarantee** you even if they nerfed bloodied/ar you'd still be oneshot.
---
Yep off a cliff, was fantastic
---
Some items have returned to the shop so there's definitely a chance. I've yet to see a power armor come back though, but it doesn't mean it won't.
---
The most popular power armor (and item) was the Blackbird Power Armor. Lots of people are waiting on that to come back.
---
I cover the atomic shop on my YouTube channel if you want a way to know when it's back. My channel is a way to follow the shop without having to log in. Because life.
---
I mean I agree that it‚Äôs a worthwhile weapon.  But it‚Äôs essentially just a bloodied grog axe light weight doesn‚Äôt really mean much now with the back pack.
---

 &gt; Hi! Lots of good feedback in this and other threads on this, I'm going to bring this up with the devs for discussion. Thank you!
---
I think I might‚Äôve visited you at your camp yesterday.
---
Anywhere from 30 seconds to never
---
Yeah, there seems to be a lot of complaining about things that really only affects the min/max level 100+ players who want to rush through things with the absolutely best build/gear loadout they can get. To what end? Fallout games have always been about the journey and not the destination. Hopefully the Vault Raids will scratch the itch they are looking for and rest of us can play at our own speed.
---
It's happened to me. It's a feature/bug! :)
---
Can I join too IGN Brokolireis
---
Exactly.
---
Its a big trade off for big damage. 
---
I have a stealth sniper build, but for my alt, I'm running full unyielding bloodied.
---
I hit like a train, but one wrong move, or one instance of ghouls just instantly knowing where I am, and it's game over.
---
It‚Äôs functional. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs robust enough.
---
That‚Äôs their prerogative, if they don‚Äôt want to buy it then they don‚Äôt want to buy it, if they do then they do. Yes others can see them, but some want the convenience of getting these plans (especially on the cheap) as soon as possible instead of having to go around finding them.
---
PC?
---
Yes,  yes,  yes,  and OMG YEESSS!! We could even make it where it auto logs you into a server with people in your settlement. Shit don't stop at settlements let's go all the way and even add in specializations like chef, gun repairmen etc.  Just give people special abilities to cook more powerful recipes or even add special affects yo weapons and armor.  A player made HUB, rivet city,  or Diamond City would be Soo awesome!
---
I got the mounted Firefly yesterday! I am so excited to try to get more of them! I want that lil molerat!
---
My issue is that it's completely random item, not legendary traits. If I'm a 2h melee god, and I get a god roll 1h, I either grind it or jump into the uninviting pool of trading subs. It's be nice to at least get a choice between 1 and 2h, or rifle/pistol/shotgun and so on.
---
Well of course if you are okay with 2* take that one. I spoke about 3* if there's is a mama Murphy's 2* pick you should take that one
---
*Server Hopping!*
---
Sorry :( just added ps4
---
a regular handmade could also oneshot you.
---
A dataminer shared a few days ago that it would work like this.
---
I‚Äôve seen many amazingly huge camps with 4 vending machines... doesn‚Äôt look like their budget was hurt...
---
I've had this happen to me several times since patch 9 was launched and never experienced it beforehand. However, a couple of guys I play with had this issue before that patch, particularly when drinking more than one purified water at a time. When it happens to me, I only drink one, and it sometimes freezes the game completely after doing so. This occurs when drinking from the pip-boy as well as from the favorites wheel, just as mentioned in the original post.
---
Why would that be?
---
This is my first time on this sub and this was on the front page lmfao
---
The challenge is to take a pic of a vertibot or cargo bot.
---
Just the revive ally and revive player in water.
---
I used to just so I could be close to the junkyard, but that was many moons ago.
---
I, uh, hate to tell you, but those things are 1 cloth and 2 leather each. 
---
They were probably *not* collectors...
---
No no no a 2 shot +50rads +30%dmg to ghouls gamagun lvl50
---
But wouldn't that be the Chameleon piece?
---
Gamer tag?
---
Has anyone made a "catch up" thread or video for those of us who haven't played since just after launch?
---
Seriously, it turns every opponents build into a one shot build against you. And you cannot reliably one shot someone in PVP at full HP, so it takes at least two shots to kill you while they only need one.
---
There was a dude with 900 base damage bloody build who needed 2-3 shots to kill my 400 HP unarmed tank. He even stacked sneak attacks for massive damage. It all gets reduced to around 200 damage or so for PVP. All I needed to do was land one punch. I had to abuse stealth boys and fast travel protection to get remotely close enough to kill him.
---
that's just 1\*? because someone who spends most of their time farming could easily comes across several TS fatman.
---
I got 2 bloodied The Dragons in the same nuke.
---
Um, if bases aren't destructible anymore and there's pressure switches...doesn't that mean deadly traps are possible?
---
Also, apparently I‚Äôm missing the door frame wall. That explains a lot.
---
Some people lock their doors to keep enemies from getting inside, scorched and ghouls can open your doors and get inside if they are unlocked. I like to leave my camp unlocked for anyone who might pass by, so I use a garage door that's got two switches, one outside and one inside. Also have two doors in the back that are somewhat off the ground that stay unlocked just in case haha
---
Fine, but you better mop up the mud you dragged in with you before you leave.
---
It's called capitalism. Either deal or go back to the forums. Shesh
---
Except it‚Äôs not an issue. Should the dev‚Äôs cater to your every whim just because you want things to be fair or easy? There is always going to be give and take. Chill out and enjoy the caps dude
---
Nah man. In my inventory whe I tab into it but gone during workbench time?!?
---
Just to make sure this is in the game right now?
---
No windows on my first floor and keypad door... xD
---
Yup. Despite the pricing you see on the market subs, it appears most people will happily pay 2c each rather than farm the lead, acid, gunpowder, and steel needed to make that much. 
---
I used to just drop all the ammo I didn't use on the ground in front of vendors, but once they announced a release date for the player vending I started to just drop all the valuable types in my stash. The only ammo I actually use is ultracite 45 for my lever action and occasionally cryo cells when someone nukes the queen, so everything else just became a passive source of income. 
---
5.56, .45, .308, fusion cells, 2mmEC, and 5mm have all been good sellers at 1c each. Shotgun shells and .50cal seem to be selling fine at 2c each, and fusion cores sell well at 1c per "percent of charge".
---
Where is dolly sods quest at??
---
Like everything up until now. ü§î I'm uncertain I'm afraid. I know there are a few 76 / Fallout content creators on YouTube and the patch notes are available but I don't think there is a comprehensive compilation of it all in one place currently. Could be wrong.
---
crit to the head. it's a one, twoshot at most, even with a regular handmade.
---
*you*'re the problem because instead of doing some research, you immediately jump to "BLOODIED TOO OP TODD NERF PLS THANK YOU"
---
May have! I‚Äôm by Fort Defiance.
---
Yep! I die alot to a secondary enemy I didn't see - alot of times I have to make a decision which one I'm going to kill first so I can come back and kill the second enemy. Like I found a Legendary Gutsy + a Assaultron at a random spawn so I was like well - I need to kill one but I will die to the other so I have to choose which one to do first.
---
How much carry weight dous it ad?
---
Not so much a damage build, but it could be utilized as a sort of beastmaster or pseudo temporary companion build.  Just adding in the option to have a creature follow and attack opens up a lot of gameplay possibilities. It doesnt seem like it'd be tough to implement given that the code for this behavior already exists in fallout 4 with the perks
---
I hope it levels with your character, this would be a nice way to get some sick leveling items.
---
That's not what capitalism is. That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen posted here
---
just did. do some research on pvp before making ludicrous assumptions.
---
Right now I don't think anyone has an idea, it's all kind of trial and error. I've seen prices all over the place.
---
Personally for me I set basic plans around 10-20c ea, rare plans a little higher. Considering I used to just give them away in a bag at Whitespring, it's a deal for me. Stims 20c, supers 40. Other chems I do just slightly above what I'd get for them at a robot vendor.
---
Just travel around, look at what people are selling for and that'll give you some idea. Eventually prices will stabilize, right now it's all over the place bc it's so new and we as a community haven't quite figured out price points for most things.
---
Because you're a dirty Raider and deserve to die like a mouse.
---
Nah they were low for a while, but it seems like the duped supply dried up in the last month and now prices are way up. Ofc there are still deals out there, but in general they're quite pricey.
---
Nope no nerf needed why don't you try running around with 19% health I will now make a few assumptions.
---
You are a little salty for the following reasons
---
1. Your duped TSE was nerfed earlier
---
2. You thought well I still have my armor well that was just nerfed.
---
3. Welcome back to Adventure Mode because you washed out of survival didn't you.
---
4. I have a box of kittens and coloring books you can have for your safe space from the big meanie bloodied builds that keep destroying your washed out TSE Sentinel  wearing survival wannabe ass.
---
I'm 100% sure it is. Datamining has found that quest name and lined it up with the Arktos Lab, including all the details of the event. Feel free to type that quest name into the search bar for this subreddit, but be aware of spoilers :)
---
What are friends? :P
---
For real. If you can shoot me before I get close enough - I'm finished. I normally have about 37-40 health points lol
---
So when I out steel into my vending machine, that steel should take from my camp build budget? You agree with that? Please justify it for me then of you do...
---
What is?
---
I respect your dedication, and optimism.
---
I had one of every type of bear/stuffed animal in the game waiting for the display update, but they all got autoscrapped in a particularly frantic union hat crafting session. I'm waiting for the update before I hunt them all down again.
---
I have a pressure plate at the entrance hooked to some powered speakers, so when anybody walks in I have a little digital customer bell.
---
If you fiddle with it you can place a Daisy rug over the plate. It's not perfect but at specific angles it looks üëåüëå
---
Willing to help if I can revive you out of water :*!
---
The instructions for using it (in the past at least) involved using a website to set up your spec, generating a code on that site, and using that code to edit a line into an INI file (or something similar) in a certain format.  Repeat for each spec you want to save (up to a certain number), preserving the correct format.  If you wanted to modify a spec...go back to the website, create the new spec, copy that code, go back to the INI file and find the old listing, delete that, and put in the new code.  Pretty sure you had to be out of the game to do that, but never studied it past that point.
---
In game there was no modifying anything.  If something needed to be changed or renamed, you had to do it in the INI file.
---
Not horrible, but quite a bit to deal with.
---
Also, if Bethesda is OK with modding in general, but wanted to dis-allow this particular thing, it's a bit of a chore.  They could ask the author to please stop doing that, nicely or not, and it would be up to the author to decide what to do about it (plus, anyone who already had it would still have it...).  The only other option would be to modify the game to dis-allow the particular bits being manipulated by the mod authors to be unavailable.  That might be easy, or very involved, depending on things that are *way* above my pay grade to understand.
---
This is true. I actually already scrapped mine for scrip.  Mainly because I am not a big fan of standard gatlings (plasma gatlings, however, are a different story). I just find them to be underwhelming.
---
That happened to me, and I lost a bit of stock that way, way back when. Hit me where it hurt lol.
---
I found my camera at landview lighthouse right at the top in a corpse whilst doing the event there.. hope this helps üëç
---
Shooting what? I tryed bl handmade on me with a friend (full uny)before the patch.And he cant kill me soo fast
---
Its time of the new scout quests, but its repeatable.  Start the scout mission and it will guide you to it.
---
That's why I got a shotgun turret going up to my main house. I leave the workshop open and the vending area. The rest is booby trapped.
---
Stealth and Automatic rifles are top nowadays, because Crits bypass most of the damage reduction in the game, and autos farm Crits faster.
---
Also using explosive Harpoon gun/laser guns are good because they have infinite range, so you can walk out of VATS distance.
---
Ideally you want a Vats Crits Rifle, so the best would be 
---
Anti Armor Vats Crits w/ 25 percent less AP cost handmade.
---
Then you would use a set of AP refresh armor and Grim Reaper sprint such that you can get more AP.
---
Sort of makes sense and is the first I'm hearing of it. I figured a Debuff to movement speed would be appropriate.
---
That's funny, you complaining about this is the dumbest thing I've seen. No one's forcing you to use the vendor.
---
I chose not to put in Adrenaline as I am really focussing on the "stealth through the trash, kill one mob" type thing. However, I am pretty OK to add it in in case I get cornered and need to clear some density. I went the same way with Serendipity, in that I don't want to have defensive perks because I want never to be seen. Having said that, there;'s a lot of merit to the "Oh shit" option.
---
I also really love generalist builds, and run one on my main. I have an alt who just loves experimenting though :P
---
Yeah me too
---
There's some good videos for it, also if you're not a fan of serves hopping then you wotn have fun.
---
The thing is, though, that no one wants to visit a vendor that has nothing
---
The items in there are probably already the base materials already - once the items have been scrapped to their components you have to stash them.
---
Super mutant hounds do not count for this particular challenge.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
A Super Mutant farting in the wind can take out a Bloodied build.
---
This happened to me and I figured out that the Save Everything mod was causing it.  
---
It should be fixed soon, but for now you can just remove it to stop the crashing.
---
I just traded a 3* medic's gatling plasma that I bought for 300c.
---
Sorry... LOL
---
If that doesnt work, take a workshop and place down a fertilizer producer, the cow should be milkable immediately
---
I‚Äôve had 8008 before. Fav one if ever had.. 7576 haha
---
If it's the revive in water one we can help eachother if still want, I'll be on in about half an hour. PSN name is same as reddit name.
---
the game could really improve with something like this would love to see people able to build small town together   i hope bethesda see this
---
We get legendary armor drops far more often than individually Melee or Ranged.
---
Id like to think that the 33% is a nice armor average, but in practice, like you said, it's probably closer to 50% armor.
---
Use a switch, I turn mine off when I am changing inventory. I have the switch behind a locked window so other people can't turn it on and off.
---
Except I don‚Äôt think you understand how this is working, especially since your post was removed
---
"Woefully outdated" is another phrase for "I'm a modern gamer with no patience who wants the best of everything on demand, and I'm going to kick and scream loudly (and maybe even make an angry YouTube video!) when I don't get my way, because clearly everyone agrees with me."
---
The people asking 2k are just pricing based on vendors without understanding the existing trade prices.
---
It is. It's one of the common mods for the RR, so you should be able to get it fairly easily by scrapping.
---
It's the **only** barrell mod, btw.
---
That hurt my Berserker build so nope not using it with that!
---
I never actually used a treasure map. Figured they were a waste of time. Have I been mistake ?
---
Amen, I have had that exact conversation before too. Everything would be 1 story tall and shaped like a box if they did, lol.
---
Hopefully one day because they keep adding new cool items in but we need more room for them.
---
I have a Discord with a bunch of people if you want to give it a try?!
---
I've just completed the event twice after the servers came back up for maintenance and I haven't been awarded any possum badges...
---
Your conclusion is: you can one shot me with a no legendary hm? Nw i know enought about pvp mister
---
I wonder if this is a mod for existing armor or a new armor type.
---
This is what I did to get the suppressor.
---
Ended up making like 6 too many, when I should've scrapped after every one that I made, lmao
---
I got the tick. Now I can make a row of disgusting ticks crawling up my wall.
---
I understand that at full camp budger you cant put thing for sale in your machine because it says that you came budget is full. As for it being removed, I didnt break any sub rules so not sure why they did that.
---
the legendary effect for damage resistance
---
Unfortunately server hopping is the best way to locate the tourist. If you try to travel to all the spots you're going to have a tough time / waste a lot of caps. The best way is to find one spot where it spawns (Wavy Willards, on top of the Lighthouse, in front of the mothman statue, Colonel Kelly monument, tyler county fairgrounds etc) and server hop there. 
---
I would also note to you that if your camp cannot be placed on that server and you accept - your camp is still in that spot as long as you do not move it. So you get your camera - move to a server wtih your camp and your camp will still be in the original spot as long as you didn't move it.
---
What's the GT if this guy... Need to go check it out myself :)
---
The Furious is the better boss killer, the AA is the better for all things use gun.  You could prime the Furious and carry both, but after the changes to Martial Artist no longer speending up gatling guns, with faster fire rate or speedy receiver really makes the gatling fire too slowly.  I've used up my stock of ultracite 5mm and parked my primed gatling.
---
It really shouldn't matter to you if we lock our doors or not then because 99% of the time you get in anyway.
---
"Oh shit".  Yep, the sneak build battle cry, right?   Let us know how your build works out please.  Maybe you'll be the one to crack the Stealth quirks.  Sneak is so good, until it, mysteriously and suddenly, stops working.  Mostly in Westtek.
---
Couldn't agree more with what you've just said, glad I'm not the only one struggling with setting prices.. 
---
I've also set my plans very low because of exactly the same reason as you, just leaving them in a brown paper bag for players to grab! 
---
Legendary gear on the other hand I think I'll just hold on to whilst I've roamed about the wasteland for a few days or so.
---
Pretty sure working for the FBI doesn't get you scout badges IRL.
---
I repeat.On close fight.He dnt use vats on me.
---
I can fast travel to any house and walk through before the walls render.
---
It's actually worse/easier now than in the past after the update.
---
Yeah that looks about right. I agree that it's frustrating. It should be a permanent spawn at multiple locations like the bodies for the Order of Mysteries quest trigger. 
---
What I did that might be helpful for you is to just pick one spot and server hop. I chose the Giant Tea Pot (body should spawn on one of the benches in front of it). It's cheaper and less time consuming than fast traveling to each location. It took me a few tries but eventually the body appeared. A word of caution: when you enter the game, give it like a minute. Sometimes things take a second to appear.
---
Happy hunting. I hope you find it soon.
---
Has anyone figured out how many kinds you can get? This is like 7 or 8 different ones so far, all the bugs it seems and molerat. Trying to figure out if he also has mothman.
---
While the op is at it please have him ask Todd to nerf the lawn sprinklers at White Spring they keep killing my bloodied build when they turn on.
---
I can foresee people complaining about being forced into PVP because someone attacked their follower. Or people sending their followers after you with slap damage. Getting these things just right will take a few iterations of the game. There is always some exploit Bethesda did not think about.
---
I've got a (pre-nerf) 3* explosive Hunter's plasma gatling that you'd have to pry from my dead hands to get me to part with. That thing chews through Scorchbeasts and yao guais like nobody's business.
---
Well, I know I have enough perks to spare to at least include Serendipity. I might look at Dodgy and Action Boy as well to see if they can save me when shit gets hot. Will certainly report back :)
---
I guess it's true. I'm going around player camps and seeing plenty of stuff listed as much as 10x the price I'm selling for. Serums 600 caps each, regular camp decorations 100-300 each, gunpowder 2-5 caps each, easy to farm outfits or recipes for a few hundred each...
---
My favorite is when you fast travel to someone's vending machine and spawn in there locked house lmao!
---
Fair enough I had no idea how much was involved. But I keep forgetting my perks after crafting it's a PIA. I realize this is 100% user error but I don't get much time to play and I'd like to get some of it back from the perk swapping menu.
---
I'd rather go through everything you described than forget to put on Bloody mess or Action boy again.
---
clearly you don't or you'd know that damage is ramped down in pvp, so bloodied builds are actually at a disadvantage because it's harder for them to oneshot people.
---
and you'd also know that crits to the head, even with regular handmades, are enough to down any player, even in sentinel gear.
---
so yeah, you're the problem.
---
The updated plasma rifles are pretty fucking vicious. And i love having the projectile effects back- so much cooler!
---
Scout and Character challenges are unique to each character, the rest are global
---
brilliant! I‚Äôm going to try incorporating this into a convenience store camp build I will eventually do :)
---
One of the other parts is using a diluted stimpack so I am going to say that isn't it.
---
How so?
---
Damn, that would be SUPER disappointing. I was really hoping for a hard adventure mode with more weather effects. :(
---
Grahm sounded like like Strong from FO4 but a little less gruff and more mellow but now it's much more generic Mutant.
---
Oh boy. Im an idiot! Yup. Everything in my inventory was base materials. Just picked up a roll of duct tape and was able to scrap it.
---
Yeah, this has always bothered me. I noticed aswell that on my standard ps4 it takes longer to load in than on my pro, allowing more time to walk around through walls and foundations lol
---
One mans trash is another mans treasure. People sell things that don‚Äôt fit their build, but those items can be the missing piece of mine!
---
heh, nice.    
---
Though if it's a proper bard the damage should be half ass but they should have kickass team buffs. :P
---
I'm up to eleven configurations now with Perk loadout manager, plus manual variants. Given my limited intelligence IRL as well as in game, it's impossible to equip all the maxed perks for even just weapon modding simultaneously. 
---
Taking a workshop and setting it up for the inevitable first defense then defending it alone takes two very distinct perk card combos.
---
My duped tse? üò† How you know what duped?!
---
Yeah a mic check / yes i have one / no i don't might be nice
---
You want to nerf bloodied?????
---
I give up......sure....lets just nerf everything.
---
What's wrong with mouses? I understand the dirty raider.
---
any DR hurts Berserker damage badly (Having 2 DR gives me a 15% reduced damage) all cosmetics have DR now and upgraded backpacks will have a bit more.
---
and you know that how? have you also considered that sentinel was nerfed and that maybe your armor didn't trigger?
---
bloodied builds are actually at a disadvantage because of how pvp damage is calculated.
---
I don't want to sound complain-ey, because you guys have been doing excellent things for this game lately. I just kind of went down a rabbit hole yesterday after whiffing a few shots with my trusty gat.
---
It... literally says in the post. You have to click the big link to make a copy of it, then it'll go into your Google drive and you can edit *that* version of it.
---
It would make sense to also be able to directly give the Purveyor your legendaries for exchange as well.  I see the machines as a quick drop off so your inventory isn't killed.  Then when you are ready you can go to the Purveyor.  But I would think it would be pointless if they didn't take your legendaries directly as well.  If they did then I would expect the scrip pool to act like a vendors.  Guess we will see next week.
---
There you go! Happens to the best of us don't worry!
---
Jesus Christ it isn‚Äôt the same as being naked, stop fucking bitching. It‚Äôs just not overpowered like it was. You have an 18% for all 5 pieces to proc at the same time. Higher for just a few. Explosive damage is still 100% negated because the dense mod and fireproof stack, and you still have perks that increase DR, your armours DR and serendipity. Chill.
---
That's right!
---
I agree. Would be very helpful. I might also suggest one for AFK. I know some might abuse it, but it would be very helpful for pooping.
---
At Dolly Sods.
---
Sure, I'm game
---
Oh, never knew that. Well, guess I'm server hopping then because either way, it's going to be a time sink and this will at least save me caps. Thanks.
---
That what i say.With my question on top!
---
Now all I just need is someone to revive in water.
---
love to see people caring for asthetics in this game
---
Thanks, I'll give that a go then. I'll let you know once I get it :)
---
That isnt from someone new lmao, two shot fatmans were super common a while back and its super ass
---
Get gud, son.
---
It's honestly convinced to give that game a try now that I can run it.
---
That's a nice feature Conan Exiles has, you can even choose of you want it to automatically close or not
---
Craft and scrap laser weapons to learn them
---
The mire is an exception. And yeah, during beta/first month after launch, it WAS dark at night. The mire was fucking black. It was awesome- you really needed that flashlight, and upgraded PA headlamps were awesome (and that was before they buffed those too).
---
Felt much more like a survival game.
---
Because, like Raiders, I hate meeces to pieces.  :)
---
No.Im sure
---
All the Gauss are Two-shot Explosive, the Fat Mans are regular Two-shot.
---
20? Damn I feel old.
---
Had a guy that heavily trapped his house - punji boards galore - lvl 3 locked doors! Turrets! The whole 9 yards.... had a wendigo mounted head on the wall - I was able to jump on it and get into his house thru the hole they had left in their roof.... some people xD what are they thinking
---
I sprinted on the day they raised the stash from 400 to 800. For the first 30 minutes I thought my game was broken as my AP wasn't dropping from moving. Lol, That day was magical.
---
and how do you know for a fact he wasn't using vats?
---
It won't have affect on market at all. You wont even feel that RnG got boosted with it, because you can only roll 2 times a day on 3 star weapons. You earn 200 scrip a day, 100 scrip a roll. By the time you actually win with it, 3 star weapons becomes obsolete.
---
So you do have a TSE !!!
---
I mean, I really disagree. I've had over 90 trades done there and as far as I can remember every trade has gone as agreed prior to meeting in-game. And everyone else can see that discussion so its all pretty reliable and transparent in terms of figuring out market prices.
---
I mean, it's not wrong...
---
It would be cool in the event of the servers shutting down, but I would be happier if the servers never shut down.
---
then you're wrong, that's my point. you don't know anything about pvp.
---
Got mine two days ago check the lighthouse.
---
I remember that now, actually. I have a picture of my friend and I in Excavator armor posing at our first scorchbeast kill in the Mire that we got opening weekend and it seems a ton more dreary than I remember. Kinda wish it would go back, or at least have an optional to toggle the in-game brightness client side
---
There's quite a few. You have your regular .50 receiver, Precise .50 receiver, Critical .50 receiver, Refined .50 recaiver. I have yet to experiment with all of them.
---
Even the Camera?
---
Thats exactly what I said lol, what I said is that if it let you choose what perk youd want instead of it being RNG it would ruin the market. This way that theyre doing it wont affect the market
---
Soo.I need play bloodied build,because i dnt have choise.I cant play nothing different.Except with hm like a 90% ppl. And that normal for u guys?
---
They've really gotten their stuff together with this game.
---
My base Charisma is 9, but it's reduced by 1 by Herd Mentality (tempered with Class Freak 3).  I think since my base CHR is 9, the perks menu lets me mark a perk as shared that has a cost of 3 (such as Hard Bargain 3), but as soon as I exit the menu, it immediately un-shares the perk, unless I have buffed my charisma sufficiently to keep it at or above 9.
---
Hobo rev up your banjo and play that banjo hard.
---
Cause Hell's broke loose in West Virginia and the devil deals in cards. 
---
And if you win you get this shiny armor of gold.
---
but if you lose the devil gets souuuuuuullllll.
---
There‚Äôs wood, brick warehouse which looks like sheet metal with holes and metal the most sturdy wall and probably best looking.
---
probably old stock. nobody dupes TSEs anymore.
---
it's funny because you people don't seem to realize that the vast majority of really good rolls currently in the market are dupes.
---
Man, Wasteland can be so lovely.
---
Tse &amp; sent/cav already nerfed.Why not.Then ppl gonna stop buy only bl handmades
---
I'd be interested to see full build, I run a similar bloodied shotgunner in PA, haven't worked in dodge perk though though.
---
Absolutely this, I‚Äôve bought more stuff than I have room for already lol.
---
It is in the game files according to a data miner.
---
But no-way to acquire.
---
I wouldn't rule out a visual bug on this one. Did the quantity of weapons listed match the quantity of weapons in the machine? I'd check this to be sure then if the numbers match yeah most likely a duper. Or someone who thought they were getting a deal from a duper.
---
Furious is good for big bads, and everything else dies easy, so I‚Äôd stick with furious.
---
Generally, I try to be fair and set prices to a level that I would be comfortable buying at if I were the buyer. We only have a 25K limit, and I'm not going to go through the hassle of dealing with mules to horde caps. If others want to, that's their prerogative; more power to them. I just don't see the point. Anything really awesome is usually trade only anyway.
---
Hmm, maybe I'll just have to jump back in and see what's new and figure out where to start.
---
i don't think a gradual increase every few months would be so bad. yeah it's double than what it was at launch, but that was criminally low. but as the life of the game goes on and you collect more gear, you need a place/way to store it.
---
Can I get a Gt? üòÖ I'd gladly pay 5k for a tse Gauss and not 25k+
---
What I do is grab covert operative, mister sandman, throw on a silencer, concentrated fire for weak point targetting and accuracy ramping, then I worry about damage. You can bug out sneak attacks to deal 3.75x damage at night. Together with targetting weak points, you end up dealing between 5.75x to 7.5x your damage depending on how the calculations actually work together. Weapon damage perks only increase your damage by 1.6x.
---
Focus on those bonus multipliers before going into damage. I only use one level of the three commando perks for +30% damage. I calculate my damage per second to be 3,300 under ideal circumstances with a measily 71 damage per shot combat rifle. When stealth does not bug out, I witness visible chunks fall off the SBQ when I shoot her.
---
Honestly, putting nothing into damage and everything into bonus multipliers will make your damage comparable to a TSE user who just runs and guns. It is that powerful.
---
Thats a good way to generate traffic, loving being able to visit people and see the spontaneous groupings and random things people get up to.
---
Many games have used the same system. No clue why people are just now starting to bitch about it. I'm fine with it. Used to it and not an unrealistic expectation. Someone has to pay for the upkeep of all those bots at whitesprings.
---
I have an Xbone X and the same issue happens.
---
I still run around with my lvl 50 perfect storm. It's a fun gun especially when luring enemies out of a building
---
Sometimes the enemies will scale up because of higher leveled players in the area and things like that. I would definitely take some time to do some of the side quests and things like that to level up - you might also try to do the new event Campfire Tales at camp adams for some XP - it spawns a lot of low level bugs and there's a chance for a legendary item too at the end  if you get a hit in on it!
---
lookup the lyrics to a song named "16 Tons"
---
(there is actually a version of it in the game)
---
There is an IRL historical basis to that song, thats what Raimbaal is referencing
---
Unironically saying 'unironically' is cringey as well. How Ironic
---
Why? So it had the same cap as TS, with a massive downside? Why even use bloodied then?
---
The point is trying to bring legendaries to SOME degree of parity. TSE needed a nerf. Each component (TS, and explosive) were individually so far beyond every other legendary effect it was pointless to use anything else. And the fact that you could have both (explosive should have been/be a primary effect) in one weapon... was absurd. They were combined a 600% damage increase on most weapons (with demo expert)
---
Thought that was kind of the point of the thread. To make a way for people to know that there's a cool camp to check out. Though the player wasn't interested in vending
---
Ok ok.I dnt play f76 as well.Thank ypu for your explications
---
That blows. Really sorry you had some moocher scrub raiders. Most of us try to be helpful.
---
A buddy of mine gave me the sturdy leg plans from the night quest where you fight the wendigo in the barn (he thinks he's not sure where he actually picked it up)
---
On 2 characters I got the heavy raider chest plan from finishing roses quests but it's like a 1/10000 chance .. I actually made and deleted about 10-15 characters doin roses quests over and over until I got it
---
Yeah, the base model leaves a lot to be desired visually.  Much wider than I would have expected.
---
the reason I talked about adding quests in is to get people more involved, and bring players back in the game. people like to feel connected to characters, hell if the robots in the current build had actual character traits and you could build a relationship with them it would be great. 
---
also adding humans and ghouls, maybe even some more friendly mole miners after the purveyor, would be good so we could have interactions between the groups, a ghoul settlement being harassed by humans would be a nice story arc.
---
No problem. I used to be opposed to server hopping too but I've kind of had to embrace it to find certain things. Plus it's a bit less time just because less loading screens. I really hope you find the tourist! I think the mothman museum might be the easiest one to hop at personally because you just have to run across the bridge and past those raider walls and the body should be right on the ground in front of his statue.
---
You can make gunpowder out of pee and trees and pyrite (fools gold, which is common as dirt in WV).
---
Agree also good idea
---
Jokes on you I don't have any doors on my C.A.M.P.   I do the same thing when I find a locked C.A.M.P there is no way I am leaving until I get in.

---
They are starting to bitch about it because it's Fallout 76, nothing more.
---
Gaming journalism was a mistake.
---
if you are lucky maybe it's a visual bug, try putting up a new functional item in your camp and see if it goes back to over 5000. otherwise that's a really bad bug and beth wont even bother fixing it either.
---
Quick search in the marketplace shows 1.5-2k caps as an average price for selling.
---
Stop counter me man.Bcs i talk with him!
---
That doesn't really tell you anything. They could have spent half an hour checking it out before buying something and you notice they are there.
---
Two shot was just as bad, it had a range nerf, the nerf to ts wasnt necessary so make bloodied the same
---
Yes mics only work constantly when you're in a party on ps4. This would make trading way easier.
---
You should camp out and be first in line for the Purveyor when she opens next week :)
---
People need to bitch... I got a million dollars \*cries\* why didn't I get MORE???? The internet is for trolls.
---
OP you still are not anywhere as skilled as the cave cricket that manages to get into my windowless bedroom that is behind a locked door without destroying anything.
---
Standard 1* two shot? Couple thousand I'd say. I have this gun and if I was gonna sell it is accept 2k
---
But then I'd have to venture to Dolly Sods.  And fuck that place.  Can't I just buy these plans from someone instead?
---
Does the armor category includes power armor? scout armor?
---
Awesome camp, really liked the interior. I definitely need to invest in some atom shop stuff. Usually I save for weapon or non power armour skins but stuff like the quantum and welcome signs look great.
---
Ah, okay.  Not that fallout can‚Äôt get facts wrong ever; I was just curious :)
---
Why assume everything is duped? I got a TSE shotgun at whitesprings two weeks ago. It's still very strong with adrenal reaction though so don't know why people are complaining.
---
Couldnt agree more
---
Yesterday there were 3 of us within spitting distance at the white springs. And 2 more vendors close enough to walk
---
so? have you heard about the concept of lying?
---
Ok i stop here.Nobody can explain clearly the thing. Except stupid jokes...
---
Hell yeah. Ill redownload it and set up shop. Did they leave the cap limit at 25k?
---
Seriously...  why would anyone care about that?
---
I've tagged the challenge and built a new camp.  The object total is building up from zero.
---
Yeah, i had that today. Saw a two shot handmade for 5k. Could just message the seller but its always better to do things in game.
---
no problem. do some research on pvp if you want to improve, instead of complaining in hopes they nerf everything to the ground.
---
Spies? As for me, I'm waltzing in there in full BOS paited PA, and Enclave security doesn't care...
---
Is that you Uwe Boll?
---
I probably wouldn't bother trying to figure out the scale as people who tend to use Beserker always run at 0 DR. Having even 1 point in DR drops the damage by 10%. It is an all or nothing kind of thing. As a work around I just used the weapon specific boost and raised it to 50%, but that negated letting me add in all the rifleman perks since it is capped at 60% total.
---
Your stash is full mate,everything you sell is added to your stash
---
I lye now?! What wrong with you
---
You didnt even take into account that you can sell the item back in for 40 scrip (if it's a weapon). This means you are really only gambling 25. That's like 5 min of farming 1 stars at Whitespring.
---
Ah sure, it‚Äôs a great song addition on the radio.  I wondered if the OP was referencing some tragic mining accident history that was related to the miners trapped in their suits, etc.
---
So Darwinism in action
---
This...  I will occasionally run with low levels to help them on their way.  I act like a tank while they shoot from distance.   Once they get their hits in, it‚Äôs All Rise time....
---
I got one guy that dropped by my Mire CAMP (to check out my wares) up 3 levels, from 15 to 18, just taking on the local Supermutants and doing the Heart of the Swamp quest.
---
If you guys can make molotovs or get him an automatic gun with a lot of ammo he can just tag enemies and you kill them to level up fast. Otherwise Eastern regional penitentiary is a great place for lower levels. It‚Äôs wahat I used to get to 40. Then whitesprings
---
"screams in mole" *grips mole tighter*
---
lol I did too, with about 2 minutes left I was taking Dolly Sods to complete two challenges and that was one of them. There was another guy there too that took it right after I did (I left before he challenged it).
---
If you have weight reduction perks for meds food etc it doesn't work in your stash or vendor.
---
I found that out trying to offload super stims
---
So i can't get the daily quest to start on my other character. Helpfulness and bravery. Wth do i do!!!
---
The going trend, as I see it, seems to be 1 cap each for unpopular ammo, 2 caps each for popular ammo, and it's still up in the air for exotic ammo like nukes and plasma cores
---
Unless you are in Power Armor.
---
My favorite is still the Rad-Rat with the red beam in its mouth that exploded like a Sentry Bot when I killed it.
---
To be honest this wins.
---
You aren't wasting money though you are wasting scrip you get from worthless legendaries that would normally be left in a paper bag on the ground.
---
your friend did. there's no way you can know for sure he wasn't using vats, it's just not possible.
---
learn to text comprehension. and also write properly. I can barely understand you.
---
Yeah it's crazy. It's not like they're taxing us in atoms. I think the justification that it's a cap sink is fine.
---
Awesome thank you üëçüèºüëçüèº
---
On the wall piece, scroll left or right.
---
Make sure the cat is recognized by the camera, it should say cat on the top right corner while aiming at it.
---
I didnt see that my mistake.
---
I can test and send you all.Im sure i cant be oneshooted with regular handmade.All good.Bye
---
Its a 2* it has two shot and +10‚ÑÖ damage while aiming
---
Which means that 98 percent of the three star drops could be ghoul slayer effect with increased bash damage  with +1 perception or similar useless combinations.
---
Ikr just anxious to see what the buzz is about :p haha
---
Also it‚Äôs kinda funny I had him just tagging the level 62 ghouls yesterday and I led to pack to finish them off, but they kinda started to ignore me and just chase after him üòÇ easy pickins I suppose
---
I will. I also need to revive someone in water.
---
craft a metric ton of molotov cocktails and have him fling em all over the place they tag a lot fast at the shashquitch imposter event, whatever the hell it's called, whitesprings golf club and the surrounding apartments and at west tek while you or some other high levels kill the shit .. 
---
also obviously make sure to have well resting, the xp increase perk in charisma and top left of the map theres a farm(aaronholt homestead) with cranberries .. just cranberries + wood cooked == another 5% xp
---
I would really love a optional questline for it so you could choose to become a ghoul if you really want to -I think that would be a lot of fun - I've always wanted it in the other games as well because I think it would be interesting to see things from their perspective and things - especially since NPCs do always treat them differently and create different dialogue. 
---
Sadly I don't think it will come to 76 but I'd be really happy if it does but I'm holding out hope it will be a thing in Fallout 5.
---
I've seen similar things few times, protections labeled as ghouls, mole rats labeled as mongrels. I've even seen them be unattackable but attacking me.
---
Coming soon to the atomic shop I bet!
---
Yeah, the Meta BE handmade with DR while aiming is more common now than TSE's. No way those aren't heavily duped copies.
---
What about with +10%dmg wile aiming
---
Not a whole lot more still, 2.5k maybe. Best bet is list it on the market place and see what bids you get. If you don't get any you like just don't sell it.
---
I found plans at the very beginning of the game but I can't craft any laser weapons.
---
nice.
---
if you can't understand the concept then you probably can't make a proper test, either.
---
you need the right perks, mutations, etc.
---
I use the old, ‚Äúif you can hear me jump up and down‚Äù. üòÇ
---
Hahaha
---
Wonderful! thx
---
Alright thank you!
---
Ok we can do that right outside my camp. My GT: GuineaPirata
---
Found a gulper that exploded like a sentry bot.
---
The camera recognized it,  every time I take a picture i make sure it says it at the top. I‚Äôm just confused why it isn‚Äôt registering for the badge
---
Actually that‚Äôs not true.  It seems the market is there to purchase legendaries from other players.  I sold a 1 star Tesla rifle last night.  I also listed a 2 star radium rifle for sale and 3 star laser pistol.  I‚Äôve got about a dozen other 2 or 3 star weapons I could sell if the price is right. 
---
Everyone is going to want the 3 star bloodied or furious version or something with AAE effects.  Guess what?  That‚Äôll cost you.
---
I have yet to see a real soul complain about it even I dont care im getting caps for nothing really just news outlets trying to get those clicks
---
I'm just keeping him around until they fix the Frog Habitat thing.  I find the poor frog kind of disturbing, myself.
---
how is anyone ever gonna find your camp to visit if you don't power it up to show on the map? before the latest update, i had 10 drinks in my punch bowl and nobody ever took any... meaning nobody ever stumbled upon my camp. after firing up my vending machine i get tons of visitors and all my drinks were gone the same day.
---
AK-101 is the 5.56, AK-74 is 5.45
---
Ill throw you an invite when I get home from work!
---
while this is needed sometimes the picture still does not trigger the accomplishment and this actually happened to me taking a picture of a cat as well!
---
Heh.  Well, you just stepped into a giant puddle of nice people.
---
love the name...Purveyor Murmrgh
---
And you rude.Ok.Thanks for your explications!
---
Exchange ratio means nothing, if you can only roll basically 2 times a day, because you can earn 200 scrip a day, 100 scrip a roll. 2 rolls on a chance of 0.0000003%....Ok, maybe few zeros less...0.00003%. Even if it was 1% chance, statistically it would take 50 days of rolling. Thats a basically mid summer, means vault raids are coming and expect vault raids reward skill over RnG.
---
I've bought several for 100-200 each. Anything higher than that and I'll spend the 15 minutes chasing the stupid bot around the map.
---
Also can you get inside Morgantown airport main building? My doors aren't loading so i can't get inside it.
---
Congratulations
---
When I was a kid,  we got our three star level 5 junkie's anti-armor rolling pin with 100% VATS accuracy when not in combat *and we were thankful for it*.
---
It sucks but those articles are for people who dont even play the game but want to revisit hating on 76.  EA does the same thing with its ultimate team and its rarely talked about.
---
I put all of my duplicate Fasnacht plans, recipes and masks in the vending machine along with ammo, weapons, magazines, etc.  Most of what folks are buying from me are specifically the Fasnacht items.  Was a bit surprised.  Hope they got put to good use as they were all reasonably priced.
---
I‚Äôm going to try this, thanks!
---
We can both admit there is a lot of duped TSE weapons. I am not complaining TSE's should have never been nerfed I do not have one  and have never been blessed by the RNG gods. But they  shoot two bullets that explode it should be over powered.
---
You're the first person on reddit who's ever commented on my name!  The other night I met someone ingame who's name was "F1shmansMumu" or something. We ended up jamming for a few minutes with me on steel guitar and him on drums, but he must have DC'd or something because he just disappeared in the middle of jamming :(
---
When it happened last time was the vendor at their camp? I wonder if they found an exploit to pull the item out of their stash after you bought it, but before the xfer completed?
---
That being said, I would still likely blame it on server latency.
---
I would say 2.5-3k caps. Always remember, everything is worth different prices to different people. In your situation, I would just post it for sale and say "Want Offers".
---
Wellll‚Ä¶ I would argue that being hit by the blade-festooned scoop on a front end loader would do more actual, overall "damage" than being shot.
---
ouch.  Have you been able to buy other things?  I wonder if bethesda found a way to kill duped items being sold?  Not saying that these were duped, but it's a possibility.
---
Haven't tried yet.
---
That's actually shockingly low. I figured vending machine spawn camping would be a new meta...
---
Looks like an exploit, I'll be super careful to make sure I don't buy anything when the owner of the camp is home. You'd think something as simple as this would have been picked up during in house testing.
---
Patch notes said (I haven't tried yet) first one has to be placed like normal (not floating etc) then you should be able to just stack on top of that one. Not working for you?
---
I found that over half my weight in my stash is junk. So I just decided to start selling it all for cheap as well. I imagine someone will come along and need a silver, adhesive, and a screw or two and slowly diminish my inventory. Whatever doesnt sell I probably have too much of anyways and I will usually go sell the bulk.
---
Good luck the sales. Hopefully I will come across some like-minded folk. Thanks!
---
I STOP HERE.BECAUSE NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN PROPERLY WITHOUT JOKES AND RUDE SENSE.
---
I had that happen when i bought a 3* furious radium rifle. It showed up as ‚Äòexcavator‚Äô in my weapons tab, which was weird cause thats what i named my power armor, went to change the name of it and it popped back to normal. It only showed up when i went to my stash or possibly the weapons bench.
---
The quest checks are server side. This is standard in online games to ensure people don't just bamboozle the client and get rewards.
---
The fix would not require a download to the client in any way.
---
Much like how map markers can take 30 seconds after login to finish appearing, due to them having to download every login.
---
Something to test with a buddy... that sucks man I feel that
---
Great joining now.
---
Yea it gives me an error and says I can't make a copy so I was wondering if I was missing somegbing
---
Lol couldn‚Äôt agree more I rolled my eyes so hard I thought I‚Äôd go blind
---
Can you craft the backpack from the quest?
---
Are you the one that has been leaving rat poison all over Appalachia
---
You have to do the questline in order to unlock a backpack to apply that skin to. It is a skin - not a backpack itself.
---
I play until beta.I know what a mutation.My build is good.U explain me nothing here üòï
---
I got the exact same issue. Started the quest early and it totally skiped the first three steps of it on release, no frog jar and outfit since I didn't speak to the NPC.
---
Was able to complete all objectives but the Kiddie corner robot is just missing a trigger.
---
Opened a ticket on Beth forum. You're not alone OP, for what it's worth. Me so sad.
---
Gladly take one of those two shot dragons off ur hands üòé
---
I think the idea is still valid as it would be a mix of both with a less impactful downside
---
I'm on xbox... gotten this effect since launch. Green. Blue. Purple. Has the shape and motion of a smoke bomb... Looks like the negative space of a visual effect not loading... 
---
No idea what is supposed to be happening but it's certainly malfunctioning.
---
&gt;Did they leave the cap limit at 25k?
---
Yeah, but with 10-20 new shops on each server there's always something fun to spend money on. Instead of doing boring grinds for lead and shit I can just buy all the ammo I want for 1-2 caps.
---
Yes only have to play survival to see TSE weapons everywhere
---
&gt;I got a TSE shotgun at whitesprings two weeks ago. It's still very strong with adrenal reaction
---
This may be a strong weapon we better nerf it again to be sure it's child friendly.
---
It's never going to happen, or they are saving it for another huge fuckup to take the burn off something stupid / liable to make people angry. Either or.
---
Looks like there is...
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/T-60_power_armor_(Fallout_76)#Modifications
---
you need to be able to craft a backpack to be able to craft that version., its a skin.
---
Have you progressed to possum level of pioneer scout yet? if not, thats what you have to do.
---
I 100% agree with this. I am a builder. Love the Adventure Mode and keeping a permanent, nice, camp. As you said, they keep releasing great stuff. 
---
Here is hoping!  Cheers
---
Piggy back at Westek. Use cranberry relish and well rested.
---
Who makes up the prices ? There is no rule .... In-game trading would be more fun that way . To bad you need Redit to find good weapons . The problem is that a handful of players buy all the weapons . They do not get in the game ,they stay in somebody's Stach . It's all about caps ..? And what can they do with it ? Nothing because they have everything .... It's like in real life .... The rich are getting richer ,the poor ..... (You know the rest ...  )
---
Anyone know why the backpack skin in the atom shop doesn‚Äôt apply to the basic pioneer scout backpack or do I need a different backpack.? Thanks in advance!
---
I got one by chance. The was a supply drop that randomly appeared. Swooped in and grabbed one. I have no clue what to do with it so I figure sell it haha
---
If the buyer has the vendor menu open, and then the owner goes into the stash and removes an item. I've no doubt it probably still remains visable in the vending machine, unfortunately it looks like the game isn't programmed correctly to recognise this.
---
oh todd üò¨
---
Remindme! 1 year
---
Great idea!
---
My only complaint is minor, but I'd rather not be able to see any players at all on a leaderboard, even if they have survived the longest. Breaks the immersion to me. I hope we get the option to turn that off at some point.
---
I buy and sell stuff like that all the time. I have an entire mule of weapons like the ones you sold. I am specifically talking about god roll items. On ranged this would be any bloodied/twoshot/AA/vampire/quad explosive/fire rate weapon. For melee it's bloodied swing speed +Str weapons. For armor it's sent)cav combos. The trading of these types of items is beyond caps. The only way to get one is to have a different one to use in trade. The last time i saw a bloodied explosive vats AP handmade sell for pure caps it went for 75k. No one has the cap space for that kind of trade.
---
They have never once responded to one of these threads, but they've responded to things within the exact same timeframe of post. 
---
They don't want to or are saving it for when they do something nasty and need to cover up
---
I think it‚Äôs coming next patch. we just got the machine you can use to trade in legendaries for the currency today.
---
Better call a wahhhh-bulance this kids filling the dried up lake bed with his tears.
---
I would be fine if they dropped it to 600(or better just kept it at 800) and changed it so that Junk has no weight in your stash. There's no difference between having 20 Lead Scrap and having 2000 Lead Scrap for the server load.
---
If they've chosen to ignore it for months another thread won't work.
---
...and that means a 25% chance at either a ranged or melee weapon. If you're after a specific weapons type you're better off with the 50% chance of it being what you want that you get with buying a random 3 star weapon.
---

Try taking it towards the side wall, out of the pool.
---
Have no clue why you're getting downvoted. You're right.
---
  Reference to not getting paid by the hour, before the mandatory 40 hr work week, getting paid by how much dirt you moved to find the ore, not getting paid in real money, but in chits/scripts.
---
  Too far/impractical to commute to work; the company owned all the surrounding land for miles - the company built and owned everything from local housing to the general store - and you bought all your supplies from the company using chits/script.  Cashless utopia? 
---
  But the company made sure what they charged for housing and supplies was more than what they paid in chits, so the employee was always indebted to the company, a little more each "paycheck"  
---
There were no other job around, so every day, you moved tons of earth, got older, and owed the company more.
---
Did you get the backpack in game that you get from completing the tadpole rank?
---
No joke. I've made about 5k caps since player vending went live on crap I used to dump in the metal box behind Nukashine. Three stars go to the scrip machine, one and twos apparently are useful to someone...hell, I made 50 caps selling a tato stew recipe this morning before work.
---
They definitely need to update the description on the keep out back pack to make it absolutely clear that it's a skin not a working backpack
---
Damn it. My high school diploma just burst into flames. Lol
---
Can't you just look on the map?
---
Cool cool. I appreciate it.
---
It might be the variant of the cat(?). I finished mine with the tabby version of the cat instead of the house one.
---
I hope we get a budget increase with the display cases that are going to be coming out.
---
Yes, the owner of the vending machine has to be in their camp unfortunately at the moment. That's the only way to see. Best bet is to find them on map and ask them about the item before you buy.
---
Game will never feel alive to me without text chat. 90% or more players don't have voice chat on and just the same a lot of the time I don't feel like putting my headset on considering nobody else does.  Text chat and human npcs ala fallout 4 and this game could make a big comeback.
---
Oof
---
Say "I am sofa king we Todd did" out loud as many times as it takes for you to figure it out.
---
I was thinking that a ‚Äúcan you hear me?‚Äù emote might be helpful, when I ran into mic issues the other day while trying to tell someone I was just going to claim a workshop, build a turret, and then server hop so they were welcome to it afterwards.
---
Wondering if dude keeps his stash open while your browsing and pulls weapon out of staff once u buy it
---
I think I heard the player has to be at their camp for it to be able to let you view the perks. If that's the case, that's a weird requirement.
---
Thanks for the help yall.
---
[https://imgur.com/DCfiINs](https://imgur.com/DCfiINs)
---
This is true I would usually agree with you but crafting mini nukes hacking into  master level computers and launching nukes isn't something you would do In real life either  and it certainly won't get you a badge but the challanges are there so I think my idea isn't too far fetched compared to these
---
Unyielding armor + Radicool is a better STR boost.  Also don't forget about Rad Ant Lager for a quick extra boost to fast travel.
---
I hope. My walls keep getting more bare, as I have to keep scrapping stuff to add new content.
---
Agreed.  The mar the appearance of my character‚Äôs outfits.   Good Lord‚Äîdid I just write that?  What has happened to me?
---
You have to hit me back to we get out of soap damage and into PvP
---
If anyone made it here and is looking for a &lt;3&gt; strength terminal there is one on an upper floor at the Atlas Observatory. It's just sw of Sons of Dane compound.
---
Aren't they in your Misc?
---
Okay I‚Äôll try with a tabby this time
---
Can you tell me what the error says?
---
600 gang anyone? Just me? Ok
---
Here's a pic.  
---
I can't explain nothing to you because you're wrong. there's nothing I can say to change that fact.
---
learn how to pvp properly.
---
You just disappeared in the water.
---
(#3)
---
The devil opened up his Pip
---
And he said, "Now gimme a sec..."
---
Took about ten minutes to switch his perks
---
While Hobo said, "What the heck?"
---
Then he settled into that folding chair
---
And played that same old tune.
---
A couple of Deathclaws joined his group.
---
Their screeching filled the room.
---
I don't think it's that the doors are not loading as much as the doors have been blocked off with the update - the only doors in are on the backside of the building. The open door I found has an "Arrivals" sign over it.
---
Doing a hard reset of my console has fixed this for me in the past
---
Pull the power cord out for a good 30 seconds and try again.
---
they're bloodied though. and I'm on PC.
---
So I see you took deathclaws out of animal friend, fair enough, now could you please add them into wasteland whisperer. I want my pet deathclaw back. I get it for bosses like the queen but deathclaws really aren't that big of a threat to most players like they are in previous games and I dont think it needs removed for balance reasons
---
What do you care what people buy?
---
I use a bloodied Lever Action and built around it. 
---
But hey, go ahead and nerf because you are more concerned about what people are off buying.
---
As for why not.....well why stop there? Let's nerf anything that anybody buys, or that is any but effective as a weapon or armor so it takes everyone at least at least 50 shots to take anyone or anything else down.
---
Or maybe just dont engage in pvp activities if you are not any good at it.
---
I'm not good at it at all so I avoid it and enjoy taking down mobs with my lever action. Someone did try to take my workshop the other day though and I took him out with 4 hits midrange, so yup, clearly needs a nerf as it can kill.
---
Shoot...But then we're not allies if that happens
---
Try relaunching a game, this is similar to an issue someone else talked about last night. When I took the wavy waves I stood on top of the small building to your right as you face the pool from the shallow end. I had to point the camera slightly above the pool.
---
My guess is that maybe both quests are locked to once per day per profile, not character.  Doing the quests on your 2nd character may have locked it for the other.
---
We need a skin too
---
Why not.....üòÇ
---
Come on.Dnt think u are a god in pvp.Its just f76Pvp for kids
---
Same problem here. Doing Free Range and was killed by the Stingwing...not the Sheepsquash ü§£
---
Hopefully they fix this soon.
---
And that why it is bad. Whats the point of adding things into game, that has no affect on game (alcohol, burrows, parade, Encrypted). Just waste of resources. Could have fixed the inspect bug in player vending instead. 
---
With Purveyor they had chance to actually impact economy positively and given back some value to caps by putting purveyor rewards behind grind instead on RnG. Atleast with grind you know you are making progression and not shooting blanks.
---
Had the same thing happen with armor I bought cheap. It was renamed to one of my armor chassis I had on me. It was kind of confusing, but I removed the name in the pipboy and it went into the legendary script machine fine.
---
I also had something weird happen on that transaction too. My weight shot way up to where I was over encumbered. I had to unequip all my weight perk cards and put them back.
---
How dare I have an opinion on the internet, right?
---
Both spawn not very far east of Vault 76.  Hope it goes well
---
I never said that. only that *you* need to learn a thing or two about it.
---
I think anything can open the doors, I've had mole Ray's open the door and attack me while I was at my weapons bench.
---
I still have hope because of the online nature of the game. In ESO you can buy cosmetic "Polymorphs" and Skins to let your character appear like Draugr and other enemies.
---
It is purely cosmetic but gives massive opportunities for roleplay.
---
I could totally imagine something similar for ghouls or even other humanoid creatures on the Atom Shop.
---
There's a Mr Handy inside the building that you see when you spawn in
---
I think this is true. I found 2 in a 1 hour session on my character who already has a camera, and 0 in a 3 hour session with a character who doesn't have it. I think it's just for people who might accidentally lose theirs so they can make another.
---
Powerfist, DCG, MMG, Meat Hook. You couldn't be more wrong.
---
I can confirm that the lighthouse spawn is at the very top, right before the stairs to the light itself.
---
Bolton greens, spawn is in the fountain in front of building
---
Wavy willards, spawn is in front parking lot, sitting/leaning against the rusty car.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I have the tourist at the cemetery . IG mcgivens82
---
A suppressor and sight for a single one of the dozens of types of guns is literally the only thing stopping Fallout 76 from being a complete game. Get your doggy poo together Bethesda and finally finish this game
---
Sure if you can find someone willing to sell them.
---
Its been over 20hrs now though. I guess ill try again in a couple hours
---
thanks, i didn't even have to click on it, it auto learned when you traded it to me
---
&gt; They don't autoscrap they go under the Misc tab in the pipboy so there's no chance of scrapping them.
---
Sorry mate, I checked myself earlier after I found another one. You have been posting wrong information there. The broken and repairable cameras do indeed sit under the JUNK tab, and they **do** autoscrap, just like I originally wrote. And the repaired cameras do of course land in the WEAPONS tab so that you can equip them.
---
Glad to see another UO vet on here. Now we just need more persistent maps so everyone can always know where to find our very specifically designed ancient roman Colosseum that sells beetles, horses, and ostriches.
---
It spawns on a table next to building at the shooting range, where you have to go.
---
Nice I got a 2 shot crossbow off a drop now hopefully I can build and scrap crossbows for some good mods.
---
Can't be in PvP or we won't be allies for purposes of the quest
---
Also, the colonel kelly monument, spawn is on a bench at top next to the monument.
---
Hey it might be a moneymaking fad, but at least it's a fun one
---
I took a pic of the sign that says what ride it is
---
Yeap) you are welcome
---
Should have mentioned PC. My bad on that one.
---
But... I can already just give you lots of caps... Is my game broken?
---
Also the free state vendor sells the plans too incase it don't spawn in. Got it from the one in whitespring resort
---
That is a simply answer.Not with stupid ans sinic jokes.
---
There's definitely some crazy variation on pricing that will probably take a while to normalize. Last night I found one guy selling nuke keycards for 2.5k, and the next shop down the road was selling them for 100 caps.
---
Only mod is prime receiver.
---
Ahh... Still worth a try maybe, Nothing to lose.
---
Always thought those were 1h weapons. As they are, you know, weapons you hold in 1h. Guess not. I was trying to use knuckles, gloves, or rusty spike mods and wondering why no decent options were out there.
---
Didnt know this, im a new player
---
My bloodied death tambo would be very happy with that decisions. ü•ä
---
that *is* the answer. bloodied isn't op, especially in pvp. if you think otherwise you need to learn how to pvp properly.
---
Ps4 unfortunately, but thanks :)
---
If an area gets nuked it won't just be "The buildings still standing undamaged but the plants now are glowing, and then everything's back to normal an hour later." So I don't think lore is a good leg to stand on, here. Anything is justifiable in Fallout if they want to justify it.
---
Mechanically, I just wish there was a way to meaningfully participate in endgame content WITHOUT power armor. Hazmat suits remove every single piece of armor you wear, losing all their protection and all the legendary effects, leaving you a wet paper bag in terms of safety compared to people in robot pants.
---
Now, if Bethesda feels that PA is the only way to play the game in endgame content, okay. It feels a bit weird given all the perks designed around NOT being in PA, including the backpack, but okay. But this half-and-half is weird.
---
I stood on a wall instead. Couldn't find my way up to a roof and it worked! You the best, zyelox. You the best!
---
  I started doing WS runs @ L27 with a L20 vampire machete.  Used it through about L45.
---
Picked up a second one as a loot drop in the golf club.
---
As a 37 w/ a decent melee weapon, perhaps in PA, he should be able to do survive, especially with escort.
---
Well, I get 400 from selling a serum to the NPC vendors, so... feels weird to get less than I can for it.
---
IMO, the first rank of the weapon type perks for whatever weapon you're currently wielding is on the "must have" list. Devoting 6 more perk slots is a bit much for me, because I also think picking up the supporting perks for the weapons are "must haves" for me as well, like Incisor and Martial Artist for melee or One Gun Army for heavy weapons for example.
---
I also would never level a character without picking up the lockpicking and the hacking perks just because I gotta know what's inside... but they really aren't "must haves."
---
But to get to the generalized list that I think any character "must have" in order to be complete:
---
S- Blocker, Traveling Pharmacy, Pack Rat
---
P- Concentrated Fire, Green Thumb
---
E- Aquaperson, Fireproof
---
C- Hard Bargain, Tenderizer 1, Lone Wanderer if not in a group, Strange in Numbers if in a group and it applies. Special mention of Rad Sponge if no one is running a bloodied build.
---
I- Chemist, Pharmacist, Fix it Good, Armorer, Power Smith, Power Patcher, Contractor, Weapon Artisan, Makeshift Warrior or Gunsmith depending on your weapons of choice (or both). I also like First Aid and Nerd Rage, but they wouldn't be in every build.
---
A- Actionperson, Born Survivor 1, Thru Hiker, Ammosmith, Gun Fu 1, Adrenaline 1, White Knight.
---
L- Serendipity, Woodchucker, Luck of the Draw, Starched Genes, Bloodly Mess, Class Freak, Super Duper
---
If you want to launch a nuke you'll need them, but they're easy enough to acquire, so if it's going to be a while before that happens you may as well sell it and get the caps now.
---
Will do. Here's hoping. Thanks for the response either way.
---
find some cliffs to jump off
---
Thanks for the clarification valseek seems they are :)
---
I would really love this for the Perfect Storm. :)
---
Update: I took a picture of a dead tabby and a house cat and an alive tabby and still doesn‚Äôt register. All of them had the icon at the top that said what it was
---
Trust me, I understand.  I've done a few SBQ fights with Super Duper on (and no, it doesn't help) :P
---
Terrible in my tea but great on toast.
---
Lol I totally meant to say that just had TS on my mind. I‚Äôd take bloodied over two shot all day
---
Holy shit this was actually the solution. It had renamed itself to something from my stash ("[Syringer] - Flymaker" in my case). And I found my other lost item too, its was disguised as the pearly peepers!
---
Didn't you hear?!?!? 7 ate 9!!!!
---
How can you get 200 scrip per day if there is a 150 limit ?
---
i just sell everything for 0. take that bethesda.  /s
---
How much have you played this game?
---
Two questions...
---
Do/did you sell any of your berets in the vending machines?  Would love to get a hold of one?
---
Does your luck actually help towards better drops, i.e. legendary or rares?
---
Played the stress test, beta, and at launch. Played until December and never returned.
---
Did you get a 3* combat armor lvl 20 for real or just saying ?
---
I want to visit my good sir.. where is it located if you already said where then I am sorry
---
Still a little bummed that I can not place my multitude of Power Armor sets on my vendor
---
haah, even worse. I always knew it was 200, like the vendors were before.
---
No free fast travel
---
Super duper would have a chance to double anything you craft as well when it comes to crafting ammo i recommend both perks together
---
I‚Äôm at the top of Seneca Rocks lol, but I‚Äôm gonna relocate pretty soon.
---
I didn't know that was a thing, but now I know it exists, and now I want one.  Thanks, OP.
---
Prices are okay, considering you can sell back those 3-star items for about 1/3rd their cost if they suck.
---
yeah I've had it not work. i took like 10 of the same target no credit. I checked the menu like 12 times hoping it would register
---
It identifies as a Deathclaw apparently. Which is fine until it encounters an actual Deathclaw.
---
This hasn't really been an issue, though I did spend over 500 caps fast traveling to camps yesterday.  Too impatient to run places.
---
This is a fantastic idea! Not only will it show what we don't like and what we want to see more of, it will also tell them what we do like but we're not buying. Then they'll have a better understanding at what some things should be priced at.
---
Love this ü•∞
---
But they're taxing us! Big government is a scam! States rights!
---
Totally agree, perhaps take it out of hunger and thirst instead which would make more sense.
---
I‚Äôm out this isn‚Äôt working. I got a Bobblehead active
---
I love how you guys claim to know this game well by just sucking it off. I'm in the right. This game is still, after so many patches etc. unplayable, or at the very least unenjoyable. Love it that I'm getting downvoted for swimming against the circlejerk.
---
Yep I can, my PSN is: CaptainModrah 
---
I‚Äôm on next week so add me up and I‚Äôll join you on events and personally, I‚Äôd love to finish the pioneer challenges with the help of a partner!
---
Yes but I use it and I also used the PA compass fix for many months until the got around to fixing it. 
---
Basically BA2s wont get you into trouble. DLLs might (script extender makes me nervous but it's required now sadly)
---
Murgle worked for me. I have the zoom lens on and was close. Sometimes you have to ads in and out to get the name(s) to show in the upper right.
---
Yeah... leveled an alt making the same mistake. Took until about level 40 until I realized.
---
Now shes carrying 4 pipe pistols around. It's a struggle even with a "great" pistol build.
---
Bah
---
Brave souls..
---
This nerf wasn't needed IMO. Shotguns require close quarters and with my TSE shotty I had to avoid being TOO close because the explosion would kill me too. Even with fireproof, I killed me more than the enemies did. Like the now popular Bloody weapons, TSE shotties had an"high risk high reward" system built in.
---
RIP TSE Shotguns.
---
Ok. PvP won't work for future reference.
---
Okay I got it when someone is next to me it registers but if I‚Äôm by myself it doesn‚Äôt. Idk why this is but it happened at wavy for the swimmer badge too. I tried taking a picture alone but when someone got in the same area it registered
---
They should just get rid of the hacking, lock picking cards, its fucking dumb because you can just change them out at will so just get rid of them.
---
Only issue is that legendaries are quite uncommon. I haven‚Äôt seen hardly any except in events.
---
If people wanna waste atoms for challenges, i say let them. Its their atoms
---
We are in the process of implementing a system to auto remove many of these post types, and many are already being caught by our filters already.
---
How about, you‚Äôre now a feral ghoul, instantly receive 100 rad resist, but your only weapon can be a fancy hairbrush.
---
I'm really pleased with this overall, I see several comments complaining that they can't be more specific about weapon type, but even if that were provided, most would then complain that they couldn't choose the Perks they wanted.
---
I see this system as an opportunity to improve and normalize player trading &amp; overall game economy in general, if you get a lousy roll, you can simply cash it in for 40%, and roll again, on the other hand you are just as likely to get a weapon that is good for someone, in which case you can do some trading, or just add it to your Vending machine.
---
This system will eventually remove a massive amount of useless gear from the game while adding a lot of good 3\* gear, which will in turn help stabilize the game economy, the days of players paying 50k caps or worse, $19.99 on Ebay should now be over.
---
Thank you Bethesda, for listening, and for properly managing the game to make it a long term, viable source of entertainment.
---
Fuck I got that song stuck in my head now hahahaha
---
Agreed. They went too far. I can do math, and the amount of extra shells I'm using to kill now is crazy and is not in line with an 80% nerf. I do next to no damage at all on tanky enemies like mirelurk queens or sheepsquatch. It's hitting as hard as a melee weapon with zero melee perks.
---
Thanks Bethesda,very cool
---
It was a pretty easy challenge, honestly. I walked outside my base, bashed a mole miner, returned to base, repaired, repeat. The resources needed were a bit expensive though.
---
For pvp yes, but definitely not for pve. Furious easily beats anti armour there.
---
Yea i was shocked to see ‚Äòexcavator‚Äô under my weapons haha, and then saw the pic of the weapon when i went to it, what a great feeling!
---
If he isn't talking about opossums then I may be mistaken..
---
&gt;But a lot of ppl use em.For all weapon types.Why?
---
because they're the best legendary mod for pve. they're not as good for pvp because of how survival servers calculate damage. bloodied builds are actually at a disadvantage in pvp.
---
&gt;I cant understand why ppl attack me bcs im confused about my fight. I delete this post bcs that.
---
because you're wrong. and because you can't/won't type properly.
---
I do the same. If I‚Äôm ready to get off I‚Äôll FT back to my camp, lay him in the bed or on the drums and irl go smoke a cigarette. If no one is there when I get back from smoking I‚Äôll log off, if someone is I‚Äôll wait till they finish and on mic thank them for stopping by and to have a good night and that I‚Äôm logging off. Just trying to be considerate
---
Holy shit I feel bad for the OP now.
---
What's your in game name? I can help you
---
It's a paint plan that you can get from a event. And I'm not sure how much it would be I have one
---
&gt;I wonder if she just picks a random 3 star from all categories? 
---
Unless I'm misreading it, that's exactly what she'll do. At this point I don't really "need" anything specific, so I'll probably just hit the "I'm feeling lucky" button most days.
---
Oh, well hello there travelar! Yes, I can sell you anything for any price. So I can just sell you 1 piece of ammo for however many caps you wanna give me.
---
Awesome much appreciated. He didn‚Äôt do bad but I really didn‚Äôt have a decent melee for him under level 45. I‚Äôll try and find him soemthin today!
---
Ok cool!
---
Try all angles. I just got my camera today and it seems fussy
---
I have still 10 improved ones from SBQ. If i had people to farm her with, i would be sitting on tones of them, so why not waste them?
---
It worked a minute ago but when I initially tried to save a copy to my Google drive it said something along the lines of you can't do that...
---
Assumed it was still locked or something but it's all good now.
---
Thanks for this!
---
Look.. Bethesda games tend to CHALLENGE the player and encourage growth. It‚Äôs a challenge to remember to use our perk cards. It‚Äôs a question of are you remembering? Is switching it on worth my time?
---
You‚Äôll say it‚Äôs an inconvenience. I see it as a memory game.
---
Does anyone know why I can‚Äôt apply the backpack skin from the atom shop in my pioneer backpack..? Or do I need a different style backpack.? Thanks in advance.
---
Absolutely not
---
Probably not. Legendary weapons are only worth big caps if they have the best modifiers aka TSE, AAE, etc. Otherwise you would be lucky to get anything more than scrip unless you want to sell them basically at vendor price.
---
No I'm talking about the pioneer update lol
---
It's you paying the cab driver.
---
Happened to me and a few others when the fermenter came out. In my case, it fixed itself after 2 hours but for others it took longer. I suggest DMing a Community Manager.
---
Still have this? Been looking for a long time
---
Yeah I saw 100 as well. I see a lot of newbies listing out regular gear for a lot too. Then there was an anti-armor max level SMG for 125 caps. I still regret not taking it
---
Nope. How do I do that? :(
---
How does one know this on day 3?
---
Damn that is kind of broken, i have 1500 caps rn, when my bestfriend has downloaded the game, i will give him some to start
---
read the highlights in the patch notes.
---
I know but i i can do it here for cheaper and also i dont have those flux materials enough for both legs. I wonder if someone would help me out with that
---
How are we to know when you stopped and what has changed since you stopped? Just jump in bro! Waters great! It's actually a lot more fun now since Update 9 just came out.
---
People are still saying 76 is a bigger disaster than Anthem or Artifact.
---
Anthem literally has delivered one thing from the road map. They've delayed stuff since March. The devs have had to stop working on content just to get the game playable.
---
Valve has put artifact in a weird "suspended state" I guess, where they aren't delivering updates because they have to rework the game for down the line. Which, given valve's history with time, isn't promising.
---
And yet 76, the game that, while obviously not perfect by any means and still has some big issues to work out, has delivered multiple content updates (to varying degrees of quality), patched many bugs, and made significant QoL improvements, while showing an actual long term commitment, is still the primary punching bag. It's not just frustrating because I enjoy the game, it's frustrating because other games are objectively in worse states. It's not even an arguable point.
---
On XB, and I haven't sold any of them so far, and probably won't put them in my vending. It's more a collection thing, so I can part with one for someone who didn't get one.
---
Luck has no affect on RNG drops whatsoever. There's no proven correlation between any of the SPECIAL stats and loot drops. LCK only affects the durability/condition of items found, so everything I get has a high condition bar, and &gt;100% durability.
---
Kinda like when you could swap out weapon equipment sets to change up play style like Diablo 2 introduced....like 20 years ago?
---
datamining is a thing............
---
Sounds like it was just a hiccup on Google's end. I'm glad it's working now. Enjoy! :)
---
My PSN is: CaptainModrah

Add me and we can help each other
---
You have to wait to take the photo until the name of the creature pops up in the top right of the viewfinder. Sometimes it takes a while.
---
You're getting downvoted for speaking the truth
---
Death and Taxes, the only 2 things that are inevitable in life.  Can't even get away from it here!
---
Yup I‚Äôve made quite the career of running around West Virginia as naked as I can get lol. I get tons of looks taking down SBQs in my tighties lol
---
I have 60 improved repair kits from killing the SBQ, and i use them on everything, all the time, never spent an atom on them and never would
---
Man I find legendaries everywhere. Idk if it‚Äôs luck or if I just know where to look. I have three mules full of legendaries, my main is full and I‚Äôm trying not to make the guy I‚Äôm playing now to be full.
---
ü¶Ñ
---
It‚Äôs quite a minor thing and I don‚Äôt think the developers were thinking about repair kits when they made the challenge, but it does essentially remove any struggle from completing that portion of the challenge.
---
Thanks I received the same plan not sure of its rarity figured I'd ask
---
Almost every game with any sort of player selling through non-face-to-face trading does. Wow auction house for... 13 years now? Valve's own store for selling items for real money.
---
Search in here. There‚Äôs about 25 of your exact post a day and most have answers. Though as of recent a lot of people in here have been getting cranky/hostile towards returning posts so the further back they are the better the information.  Also asking more specifics will result in better answers.  The game has got ALOT of new content. And has way less bugs.
---
TY Apexigod &lt;3 Doing the lawd's work out here.
---
Yeah I had the same experience over there, which was nice! I was just getting antsy and really don‚Äôt want my camp constantly destroyed by SB‚Äôs so I figured I‚Äôd try something new, and I thought maybe people would feel inclined to stop if it‚Äôs within a short walk of free travel. üòä
---
It's a great idea! I'll pass it along.
---
I doubt it because you had to pair it with sentinal armor or something so you didn't get that last slice of health bar taken away. Without that you're best off using a 40% health bar which doesn't leave it quite as OP.
---
I farmed golf course today, 1 legendary ghoul, which is about what I have been getting post patch. They all came at me except for the one that gets stuck downstairs in the golf shop behind the register. I suspect the "golfer" ghouls are replacing possible legendarily, deliberately or not.
---
I have admitted my forgetting perk cards is 100% user error.
---
Well, I guess everyone else is struggling to finish this one too...
---
Sights and suppressors for the dragon would be epic
---
Thank you everyone for the help, I guess I‚Äôll need to find the scout quest and do it before I can get the backpack
---
Whatever.Wrong idea to post my opinion here.All good üëå
---
Ah cool thanks for the info!
---
Hey /u/valseek can you tell us if the scrip spent on a legendary gets consumed, or does some portion of it roll back into the legendary wood chipper like when we buy things from the regular vendors?
---

---
 &gt; It's a great idea! I'll pass it along.
---
There's no guide that I know of but you might be able to find helpful tips and things on youtube. There's a lot of new content depending on when you left. Come get your backpack!
---
I would kill to become a ghoul in 76. I too played ghouls in 3/nv/4. New Vegas made the most sense, because there was no reason your courier couldnt be ghoul from the start.
---
Took some creative mental gymnastics and an alternative start mod for it to make sense in Fallout 4. In that, my character was Nora's brother and Nate's Squadmate in the Army. My character introduced Nate and Nora, but while Nate got out of the Army, my character reenlisted and was stationed in the midwest to quell the civil unrest before the Great War. He knew Nate and Nora were moving to Sanctuary and just had a baby when the bombs dropped. He survived the apocalypse and became a ghoul, eventually becoming a ruthless raider. He figured Nate and Nora didn't survive the bombs so never went looking. 
---
200 years later, he starts hearing rumors about the raiders in Nuka World, and realizes Sanctuary and Boston are on the way, so he might as well lay some ghosts to rest. He finds the settlement, Codsworth (who mistakes him for Nate) and discovers everyone dead in the Vault, his infant nephew missing and has an attack of conscience. His nephew might still be alive, and someone killed his sister and best friend "recently", so now he is going to avenge them and maybe do something good with his life, finally. Spoiler: he kills Shaun and the Institute and takes over the Commonwealth with the Nuka Raiders because Boston is as shitty as everywhere else and being a good person gets you dead.
---
Hunt them down?
---
Every bear is at the Fairgrounds. Go down to the amusement park and there you have all the cats.
---
You can milk almost anything that has nipples.
---
Would be so in for that. Would love to use fusion cells to be able to create fusion cores or scrap .38/.45/.308 to make 5.56 and .50. Even if there was some kind of 10% loss its still better than dumping ammo due to weight concerns
---
Crossbow Ideas;
---
Fix the front and rear sights so they are correct and line up. 
---
Reflex sight
---
Short scope
---
Skeletonized stock
---
Fix the arrow animation when looking at the crossbow on the menu area (arrow sticks out of the crossbow, not on the actual rail). 
---
Just a few ideas. Cheers
---
Shouldn‚Äôt Free States argue this? Lol
---
Run whitesprings
---
Quit game
---
Load back in whitesprings refreshed
---
Reapeat till content
---
Try west tek and a few other places
---
Legendaries are pretty common
---
PC also allows more freedom then consoles. Hell PS4 modders could not even use external assets, due to how Sony is a closed system. So I dont think it is a problem of them being incompetent, I think it is more an issue of consoles not allowing the things needed to make it happen, without major programing. Also Bethesda does not openly allow and support modding, it is more they tend to turn a blind eye to QoL mods. Or at least that is the impression I have gotten.
---
but I'm always jumping. Crouch jumping. Not to be confused with crotch jumping.
---
I don't think there was any struggle to begin with. A single point of durability damage let's you repair it.
---
I guess if you have zero junk for some reason, yeah maybe there is a bit of a struggle...
---
it's not an opinion. you're wrong. that's why people "attacked" you.
---
One guaranteed 3 * per day is still a better grind than playing for several hours and not getting a single one.
---
Well, one also has to be smart, if I see a vendor with 2 items I'm not going.
---
Dude.  Ft to water park. Run to car in middle of parking lot. You see a body by the car?  Camera. No body by the car? Server hop. Sorry. It‚Äôs the best way. Good luck.
---
I have two very specific questions.  much much easier to ask those than search through...i dont know how much information, to find the answer
---
Any one complaining about this is just bad at the game
---
I made 16k in my vendor this morning, sold some TSEs and other random stuff. I don't want to spend it traveling around to all of these new player shops
---
No the Chameleon Armor only works when you're crouching, the mutation works when not moving, and does not require you to crouch.
---
I just knock them out of the sky when i see them, i got up to 8 cards one week hanging out at whitesprings.
---
Hopefully shouldn't be an issue with the vendor only 6 days away, can get up to 900 including the last 2 days we had access to script
---
np.  
---
I switched to a cultist dagger at 45, and now alternate between that  dagger and a vampire switchblade.
---
If you have the right perk, serrate the blade for additional damage.
---
Has he started the mysteries questline?  
---
Blade of bastet is slower, but carries enough damage to be another good one.
---
You do the new dlc that came out called the order of the tadpole. To start the quest, in your miscellaneous and there should be something in there to start the quest. Once you finish this quest you get to go to the next rank and that is where you get the backpack I think
---
Then walk
---
Check it now. I thought i read patch 9 was supposed to address those sights
---
I certaintly wouldn‚Äôt expect to pick a stat to my choosing , sorry if I alluded to that , what I think would be ideal is a system where you roll for totally Random effects but keep your prefix this way if you have an item say ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äù in the slot you want you could say once a week reroll the last 2 stats at random, this way if you get another bad roll you can still reroll after cool down and grind until your item is Acceptable this kind of system would off course need to be throttled to avoid exploitation , but I feel it would give players incentive to grind out until their gear is perfect and move on the the next armor set or weapon, the thought of trading in crap for perhaps more crap as the intended system is less appealing in my opinion
---
I have put together a comprehensive guide to activate any of the quests that you have missed:
---
1. Go to any train station and look for posters hanging on a display board, activate them.
---
I added you and am online now
---
I say we should be able to get base 10 of every SPECIAL.
---
Well on first day i both made and spend over 20k caps, so i could have free fast travel for week.
---
But you have to fill out a bunch of complicated forms and wait in line at the dmv office to get it.
---
More RNG bullshit instead of game design.
---
It's not as personal though, and that's the only thing lacking.
---
Dam sry on ps4
---
In my case it took a couple weeks of hunting before I found someone, actually selling, serums at what looked like average.  It was enough of a time sink I haven't used it since.
---
Regardless, there is no way for most folks to actually find what price goods actuality sell at.  Now your looking at a drastically lower bar for entry into buying and selling on the casual side and more in game transparency is needed.
---
No not at all who want auto aim and crits
---
Not really that broken. What platform you on? I'd be glad to help a new player if you're on PC
---
Wrong about bl nerf,ok agree.But nobody ask what weapon i use,what type of armor,mutations...before write jokes and juge my gameplay.That not ok
---
True, I also realize my post does make Bethesda sound incompetent which wasn't the point I was trying to make. 
---
I've been happy with the game overall I just hate perk card swapping.
---
Hey join my game I Found out how to do it
---
Try restarting the game. I was super pissed last night when it said I had 0 scrip when I knew it should be 300. It stayed at 0 through fast traveling and stuff until the server couldn‚Äôt be reached and the game crashed. When I restarted it, I had 300 again
---
Other than prime receiver there are no mods. 
---
Wish i knew before crafting/scrapping 50 of em
---
Well stated.
---
Me too, I only have like 2 hours to play on a week day
---
I don't know how far from your spawn point the tourist is at the teapot (hell, not sure I've ever been there).  But the one at Whitespring is 20 yards from where you log in, on the hood of the red car at the front entrance.  That's another easy option to try.
---
I haven't been there all that much since the patch that added them, but I've seen it several times there in my comings and goings.
---
I don't see how adding explosive to a gun can possibly make it worse. Most likely the guns were carrying people's builds and they don't want to admit it.
---
20 yards is 18.29 meters
---
it's...not our job to do your basic homework. 
---
I plugged "fallout 76 beta wipe" into google. I got the answer on the first page. 
---
I plugged "fallout 76 survival" into google and got the answer to that question. 
---
_do your own fucking homework_ dude.
---
Thats cool but people farming west tek/SBQ can make tones of 3* per day. This is not for them probably....
---
I been trying to find a lvl50 perfect storm what system are u if xb1 give me a shout out if u find another plz my gt is BACONDRAGON93
---
Doubles the base amount. Not the total with ammosmith
---
Fyi...no one really uses 1 handed...so good luck getting alot out of it..(bought a bloodied swing speed max shishkabob for 500 caps because he needed space and no one even wanted it)
---
Of course they'd work together to kill her...until she died...then it's a free for all.  At least let everyone loot the queen before you turn on each other.
---
Thanks for the offer, but im on ps4:) if you could give me a good tip i would be gratefull
---
Not in West Virginia it ain't!
---
(good bot!)
---
Ppl would for sure murder each other cause you would be dropping all that stable flux you just got
---
They have more in common than not, authoritarian government control of everything.
---
They _don't do server side fixes_ without patches for this game.
---
You being in the right is your opinion. If it was unplayable, I wouldn't be able to play and if it wasn't enjoyable this sub would be dead. 
---
Let people enjoy what THEY want.
---
Welcome back! Happy wastelanding!!!
---
The (incorrect) assumption that players must use a bloodied build to compete in even standard PvE content much more strongly supports a balance pass for "bloodied" weapons.
---
Honestly, I'd have more contempt for these FotM one-trick-pony builds if I weren't a stealth crit rifle sniper. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yes!  I can do a great ghoul voice and this would be perfect!  Just walking around talking like a ghoul.  I've almost considered playing someone like that in guy in NV who thought he was a ghoul because he was ugly. 
---
Hey smoothskin.
---
Can you only hold 150 scrip?
---
I mean a lot of people would maybe not murder each other, but I think the most try hard players would kill the others. It would be nice to see the more PvE oriented players team up against the PvP people.
---
&gt;Come get your backpack!
---
And don't forget to try the nukashine!
---
No government bureaucrats here!
---
you need to craft a Basic backpack at the armor bench and apply it to that. confused me as well.
---
You could, gives it that personal touch and customer service to interact with them though.  Or hop in the bed or piano for a bonus to start off the next session.
---
I haven‚Äôt played for a while. What are scrips
---
Yeah especially since they're gonna add legendary power armor eventually
---
Rage-bait "journalism" is cancer, and so are the people that peddle it.
---
Definitely go with the previous mentioned food gathering perks.  Also to consider can do for more random food goodies.  For yourself you may consider dromedary, slow metabolizer, and rejuvenated... if you're well fed, there is more to give to others.
---
As far as recipes to make I say lots of Tea and lemonade. Also sweets pie, cobbler, ect.
---
Now if you wanted to be the best Grandma ever you could also farm "feed the people" now that those cans don't spoil... Grandma always sent you home with a dish too.
---
Don‚Äôt do it it‚Äôs a trick üòÇ
---
Actually a two shot mirv is dope. While shotguns only fire one extra pellet, a mirv fires an extra shot but both of those shots split into more bombs. Effectively double instead of a quarter.
---
Same here. Seems like a problem bethesda would want to address. I‚Äôd gladly buy more atoms if I could actually place the new stuff I buy. Right now that‚Äôs not possible.
---
Wasteland grandma, serving up a heaping helping of HOT LEAD with a side of DEATH!
---
Oh, okay. So I basically should get both then?
---
I've got plenty of low *3 items. 
---
Watoga especially
---
Cool, thanks. I'll give that one a go as well if things don't pan out at the Mothman statue.
---
Those are good points. Seems like an overarching issue might be that most of the endgame content is tied to nuke zones, which limits viable playstyles.
---
100% this. 40% RoI on even a bad roll is solid math.
---
Congrats on become a tavern owner. I aim to have the same thing happen to my shop one day as I'm right outside harpers ferry.
---
mole rats are our friends :)
---
Future Wikipedia entry for Bethesda:  Early 21st century game developer that pioneered the monetization of Beta testers.  
---
Seriously Bethesda, I hope there really is some reward for the early (i.e. patient, forgiving, and understanding) customers in the near future.  This 'fix a problem&gt;create a problem' development model is wearing thin.
---
Oh snap. Thanks tho
---
Why is that?
---
The bugs right now since patch 9 have been pretty bad. Well it's only really been server not responding. But usually, it's never enough issues to be a real problem.
---
It‚Äôs like rust now lol armor doesn‚Äôt mean shit anymore
---
I got a Furious Explosive pump but its only lvl 35? Are you on PC?
---
you yourself didn't bother writing down those details. you just made a wrong assumption. you can't expect people to react any different in a situation like this, that's not how social interactions work.
---
not that your build matters. bloodied doesn't need a nerf. period.
---
Only the first foundation has to be placed correctly. Anything that snaps to it can "float." 
---
"Foundations: The requirement that all Foundation pieces in a block of Foundations need to be built on the terrain has been removed. Now, only the first Foundation will need to be built on the terrain and subsequent foundations snapped to that original piece will then ignore this rule. "
---
Yeah, but what Im saying is that people would probably see the vendor thing empty and be like "eh.. not worth the caps to travel"
---
Yup, this is true. Anything can if your doors are unlocked. And then you got the bastards who will, on occasion, just spawn inside your house
---
I said in my post that I did that. I made sure. It still didn‚Äôt work.
---
Currency you get from scraping legendaries at trainstations.
---
I got bored. It‚Äôs only worth playing with friends IMO, and besides all I used to do was scare new players and chase them down, never fighting back.
---
Are you on xbox? Maybe we could play together and you could show me what‚Äôs new :)
---
Actually...that would be a great optional quest. (stress optional)  Go to the courthouse, get some forms, get them stamped, find proof of income, run to another department, try to find your w2, then get some of the caps back you've spent in shops. 
---
"Tax Season"
---
Whaa?  This offends me.
---
Hey, thanks. 
---
It's ; shry I added you
---
What gets me is when I fast travel to a vendor camp and it spawns me inside their locked house. Vending machines is outside but no one can travel to you to check it out without getting trapped in your house. Unlock your doors!!
---
Or at least put a workbench or music instrument on both sides of your window so people can phase out without fast traveling or becoming wanted
---
Just like i wrote it would be , cheaper than expected though. 
---
Cant wait for the posts when ppl get only trash and complain all the time .
---
I would love a system of legendary perks and legendary mods.  Simple 1 to 3 perks for building 1 to 3 star weapons. 
---
Every item you destroy gives you a legendary mod of that type.  So you have stripped the legendary materials off a weapon.
---
The first star added to a new item costs 3 mods of the same type.  The 2nd star needs 9 and the 3rd star needs 27.
---
This would encourage trading by players to get enough of the needed legendary mods.
---
It would also make it possible to get exactly what you want, but very difficult.
---
What do you do with it
---
Nice workaround!
---
My was less creative...
---
I used a camera mod, a "silent protagonist" mod and a Nora companion mod. 
---
In my game my Ghoul Chernobyl, a travelling scavenger and merchant, finds Nora in Sanctuary while looting the settlement. She breaks together but he takes care of her, explains her the world she woke up in and approves to help her out of pity.
---
So i play the companion and pretend that Nora speaks in the dialogs of the main quest ;-)
---
I went with the Railroad and blew up both institute and bos.
---
Now? Nothing.
---
I'd love to see the "Cowboy" perk from FONV to roll over. Lever, Shottie, Knife. Cherry pick utility perks as needed on top? Beauty.
---
Yes but they are STACKING. Now just connecting mid air
---
I moved all the way up north into the mire nexy to a very nice vertrabird crash to have a unique place to peddle my wares and have a resprite for the weary traveler.
---
I'm kinda bummed no one says hi or pets my mirelurk king
---
I wish there were challenges/events were script is a reward.
---
You're a special person :) It takes a lot to be willfully blind when multiple people are telling you that you're wrong.
---
You would think after separate people telling you the same thing I'm saying, you'd figure it out. But hey, you do you
---
I did. It still wont count
---
I was curious of this since I visited a camp and they had multiple Vendors in a line but one wasn't connected to power because something broke the wall and ate it, but I was still able to access it's shop.
---
Wdym lmao, its super easy to get, each 3* is already 40 scrip and the total cap is 1000 anyways
---
All the more reason to let us choose between them when buying.
---
Scrap before you store. Try to stay well rested.
---
I just don't want someone to scrap their legendary weapons they might be able to use to roll something they would like to have or can sell in their vending machine. Bethesda didn't really tell us that, and it's been found through datamining and talks in the community so I wanted to make a post about it everywhere I could so people would know and be prepared.
---
Ahhhh I‚Äôll have to try again later. I might have been only trying to apply it to the backpack you are rewarded when you graduate from tadpole. Thank you!
---
Never Craft without it! Honestly forget to swap it out for combat half the time.
---
This has me laughing harder than it should
---
Hey man do you have anymore scaly skin serums? Would really appreciate it
---
 PC yeah. I don‚Äôt like explosive on shotties because it damages me too much.
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
True,  or people charge super high prices for items. The highest price in my vending machine is probably 100 caps
---
Oh. I was confused. Ok
---
Fuck outta here Donald
---
I'm sorry to hear this brother but it does give me hope that enough others have this issue it will be seen
---
The way I would do it: place my true foundation. Then line up a second ring of foundations around the first, using this line like a frame, by snapping foundations INSIDE the second ring, then removing the second ring, or as much as it will allow. Or some variation thereof.
---
I travel to caps, open the door.... and then just leave.
---
It's called fast traveling works indoors on this game..
---
They just took it offline for maintenance today. I thought it might be to fix it.
---
Maybe refund your travel caps, or part of them if you actually buy something? Encourage people to use the mechanic.
---
Who tf wants to buy a half broken, non legendary, level 30 lever action? That's what I just ran into.
---
Probably not a requirement.  I suspect that  aplayer's inventory is tied to their character (even the stash) to make it easy to access your stash anywhere on the map (like at the Red Rockets).
---
Seems like an odd choice, but tying it to the character instead of a box (or to nothing at all) makes some of the other programming easier.
---
Likely, when you are looking at a vendor, you're actually trying to look into their stash (where the 'sell this' flag is set), and since the 'stash' is actually on the other side of the map with the character, all you have access to is the object name and basic info.
---
It *should* be fairly easy to fix, though fixing this without screwing up 983479 other things might take a bit of work.
---
(All speculation if course, I've only taken a quick peek at the actual game code a couple days ago, and I'm still a bit dizzy from the experience)
---
Yeah it's silly. I wonder if there is a way they can fix it. Honestly I think we all know welcome mats are the way to go
---
Start sending invites to everyone on the server, you‚Äôll be in a full team in no time
---
Also- especially at Whitesprings... Check ALL the ghoul bodies - Many of the ghouls there are carrying legendary items, but lack the legendary prefix ("Diseased" tag and others (?need to verify?) obscures the "Legendary" tag on many of the ghouls that spawn there, both nuked and un-nuked...
---
Haha yeah loved that guy. The whole questline was gold!
---
Or maybe let us filter camp shops on the map to only show camps with certain gear. Like "only show vendors selling 2 star legendaries"
---
Note, you can't stack the same bonus from the same type of aid item.
---
food, water, chem, alcohol. 
---
wellington and steak are both food, so their +strength effects won't stack, nor will +carry weight from the radstag and ribeye
---
whisky is alcohol and will stack replacing steak +2, You can also use steeped fern flower tea to get +2 strength, as it's a drink.
---
Yeah without a doubts, but I liked selling my unusable stuff to the vendor for my daily caps
---
Now that's how you show the Man who's boss!
---
You can't control me!
---
I'd sell you on for 500 but I only have 2, if I had 2 more I would:/ try doing the dailies?
---
I'm going to have to vote no.
---
You cheapskates already have all the vendors in one spot in White Springs because it was too expensive to travel around the world.
---
 If you wanna travel to somebody's base for free I recommend walking.
---
 Please stop trying to dumb down the game. It's already ridiculously easy.
---
this is a bad idea how do they know where your camp is
---
maybe they should take FT away and people can just walk in from the nearest FT point for free..
---
then it would be on vendors to have good locations..
---
cant just have people free FTing all over the map...
---
edit-
---
sorry i dodnt mean to reply that to you.. but rather to the thread itself...
---
The AA will have better accuracy especially if you use vats.
---
Timer might be the wrong word, but if you make 3 of the same type they dont all fill up at the same time or any faster, vs 1 of each type will fill up at the same time getting you more water faster. And I cant confirm this but the nice ones from the atom shop are also different then the basic dirty ones
---
Two shot will have the higher outright dmg than aa. Since both are explosive. If you have penetrating mags with the tank killer perk you'll have a bunch of aa already in my opinion. But the aa is good against pvp. So depends on your engagements really. I'd take tse personally.
---
That kind of datamining stuff is so interesting. I would have thought it would just pull a text entry of some sort, but you know how binary goes heh.
---
Go to camp adam. Wait till night, do event. Have chance to get badge. Get badge. Profit.
---
Camps defy gravity for several practical reasons. (1) to ward off monsters from entering and destroying expensive decon arches. And (2) also to better protect turrets. Plus, (3) the vertical beam in the stairs menu never worked great. And lastly, (4) til recent patches, blueprinting often didn't place correctly across multiple flat foundations. So builders lost their hard work when they moved spots.
---
Edit: forgot (5) some people don't care or are dumb
---
People will just turn it off, scrap the wire instead.
---
Spend a perk on Travel Agent. You save 30% on fast travel
---
AAE is more accurate, the TSE has more damage IF and only IF both shots hit the target.
---
Because the cost aint high you don't have to spend week of grinding to be killed once you logged in and have to work for it again. The answer to "more thrill plz" is to add events where not dying is crucial to meaningful victory. This way it'd satisfy the needs of people that want defeat to sting, but at the same time would not kick out the majority of the playerbase without unlimited time to spend playing.
---
Alternatively, we could discuss "hardcore survival mode". Less everything besides violence, more violence, no legendary loot - only crafted items and regular gear found in the wild - and full loot drop upon death. Single character, no mules, separated from rest of the non-hardcore characters. Since there would be no legendary gear, all that would be lost upon death could be recreated. Now if you would loose a gun you farmed 300h for it'd pretty much mean ggthxbb for majority of people. But in no legendary reality all you'd loose you could craft back. Prepared players would be able to rearm themselves upon dying quickly, several times. Meta would change. Instead of having few thousand ammo when you hunt, and a minmaxed PvP build in perfect gear/build synergy, meta would be to be able to operate as cheaply and as efficiently as possible. Noone would waste ammo on criters, even sneaky snipers would be partially specced into melee.
---
But this harsh vision cannot coexist with adventure and with current survival, and removing current survival for hardcore survival described above would be a terrible thing to do to this game. Implementing hardcore survival as a new and separate game mode would, on the other hand, be a wonderful move and a sign of appreciation for various needs people come to online Fallout with.
---
Please don't answer with "if you'd loose your gun after your 300h and you'd quit then farwell". With 800h in F76 I'm now nearing half the playtime I had in FOnline:2238, which was a full loot drop unofficial online Fallout game that was a mashup of F1 and F2 made small-scale MMO.
---
Your best bet is to jump in and actually take time to enjoy the quests and updates. A lot of people who want to play catch up after being on hiatus will want to speedrun through everything. It's great to just take time to appreciate what the updates have to offer. So much has changed and with all these updates. I always have a plethora of things to do. Welcome back and happy wastelanding! :D
---
Really disappointed... we should at least be able to choose based on our build class, such as heavy weapon, rifle, arms, legs... this really sucks and makes me not want to use her. The price is steep for a random 3 star i traded half a dozen three stars to buy
---
Some new duping method came out, I'm really not sure if it's limited to Xbox though
---
ok.
---
To follow up... if anything the fast travel cost should go to the person who owns the camp.
---
&gt;thus we can get 3 3* weapons every 2 days.
---
If you're willing to take a chance on the mystery pick you can get 4 legendary items every 2 days, or 16 per week.
---
Thanks a million, TIL :)
---
nice find!
---
Eh sorry but.. you kinda paid waaaaaaayy too much on that :(
---
We've only been saying that for months
---
You have access to letters in the workshop menu. Use them
---
Sure but selling to a player avoids the daily vendor cap. Making 2,000+ a day beats 1,400 a day. I‚Äôm glad to sell cheaper to players than robots but at some price-point it‚Äôs not worth my time.
---
Yeah, just like Deathclaw Skin doesn't seem to be available anywhere.
---
I gave up on bloody mess myself. I was tired of forgetting to swap it with super duper when I do stims. I would whole heartedly agree that perk load outs are needed. But I think there is more at play then it seems. Especially after reading the whole process you have to go through to get it on pc.
---
May 16 the Legendary Vendor will be taking the scrips.

---
speaking of pictures, in PvP if i kill someone i hurry to their body and get all my armor and clothes off and stand near them looking at their body with my camera. 
---
gotta throw a little sex into the psychopathic killer scheme ya know?
---
I commented above for another floating camp comment. But hopefully that changes over time now that it's easier to build and blueprint camps
---
It is only from that daily where you have to bring parts of 5diferent insects.
---
For some reason i could do it multiple times so i had egout to do this challenge.
---
Challenges sux anyway lets do event: campfire tales. Fastes way to get mods.
---
Great work. This post is the most informative I have read here. The information given also the most infuriating.
---
Any 3 Star rolling pin you will be so over powered people will want rolling pins nerfed
---
I fully agree. I‚Äôve been trying to build one since day 1. If you‚Äôre on PC, I have a spare banjo I can give you. It‚Äôs classified as ‚Äújunk‚Äù
---
is the meat hook medium?  i main the meat hook but it might be "fast" i cant remember
---
i do like the ski sword as well, pretty sure that is medium
---
5000 for *just* explosive is fair. Not a great find, but not a bad deal either
---
*Bloody Mess
---
Great movie. Now I wanna build a castle... Connected to a staircase ;)
---
I'm pretty sure it's under Misc, the very last tab of the CAMP's build mode.
---
Do we know if there is a cap like in Skyrim?
---
Microphone grenades. When dropping the mic doesn‚Äôt cut it
---
What's the point of disabling it? I just noticed it was there and it seems like it would be cool to use
---
People was expecting they would get awesome rolls everyday i assume
---
No! It's one of the few cap-sinks in the game.
---
I'm down
---
Add me - PSN hovdogjay
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre right, I got mine from the daily repeatable quests.
---
Paid waaaaaay too much. I sold one for 999. 5k.... Thats inflation. Never pay more than 2k for anything.
---
Does the mounted firefly generate light?
---
I had all variations of the Mr. Fuzzies, and all types of teddy bears are not at the fairgrounds, only the common ones.
---
The only legendary scout armor I've ever seen is the chest piece you get as a quest reward, which leads me to believe these will be a new addition to the loot tables.
---
Well I don't think anybody knows. I'd assume so but, honestly no details on that yet :/
---
Explosive weapons will make you go to danger. Avoid it.
---
Yes I do. What is your IGN and when will you be on next? My IGN: jchamlin
---
I actually think this is a second stealth cap sink and I am ok with it. It's too easy to make caps and I need something to spend them on if I ever want to sell things in my vending shop.
---
A 3x3 house is very nice and compact if you want a lot of decorations, recently got a way bigger camp build and thinking of downsizing
---
Wouldn‚Äôt 250 dmg be perfect for this gun?
---
What do you mean with promoting?
---
Recipes are good money. There's collectors out there who want to collect every one of them (*shifty-eyes).*
---
Which is better though, powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet. With mods on both?
---
i appreciate that you didn't link to the articles.  no need to give them clicks.
---
These are the reasons alot of PvE oriented players don't play on survival.
---
 To turn on people that just helped you complete an event is just completely stupid and toxic in my opinion.
---
Its not dumbing it down. Every other Bethesda title and almost every other open world game for that matter has free fast travel.
---
Depends on your build i have a instigating power fist that does 712 base damage. Anti Armor is great when used with incisor I also use 5 pieces of unyielding armor.
---
I saw someone else say that it does but I haven't tested it myself yet! // I am at work or I would check for you, sorry!
---
Another gamer who does not understand how game development works.
---
Where is this daily located at
---
No problem. I believe the enclave stealth boy has the longest time in effect. Also the phantom device you get from the mistress of mystery quest line has the added bonus of making groups on enemies frenzy, good for escapes.
---
Given the incredibly low odds of getting a third worthwhile effect this seems to be the best way to approach it.
---
There are programs that will turn the binary into something readable, but trust me, that's not nearly enough to help :P  The only real way to get anything useful out of it is to have the program AND be able to write a script to parse the data into 'bite sized' chunks of appropriate information (and the ability to figure out how a lot of the data relates to other data within the program).
---
I'm not a programmer, but I do data analytics and have enough experience with basic scripting and database structures...and I made pretty much 0 progress in even finding what I was looking for.
---
[See the comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/ee45vqt/) that sent me down that dark, foreboding trail.
---
Hmm? wdym? Scout armour can be earned from the enclave bunker vendors, or doing their respectable quests. These armours aren't in the loot table, so they can't drop legendary except for the couple unique ones given, but they're all not great.
---
You can buy mods for the Scout Armour, but they won't give any legendary effects.
---
Most MMOs have a tax system.  It's really not news, or negative.
---
I found my lvl 50 Perfect Storm in the market on Reddit. I put it out there that I wanted it and almost immediately got a reply.
---
There's a video on YouTube that shows if you let a 1* or 2* enemy kill you in an instanced (inside) spawn it will 'promote' itself to the next star level
---
My opinion still stands.
---
I didn't reply to you, oops
---
Whichever one has 40% faster swing speed
---
Please explain how you came to the conclusion that it would be just perfect...
---
You know you will always wsnt more.
---
If you look at the player inventory in that screenshot they have a piece of legendary scout armor listed, so they either photshopped that in to fuck with us or it's being added to the game.
---
Instigating is also good for stealth snipe once you‚Äôve got all your perks ups. Maxed out Tank Killer and Bloody Mess are a must., plus max Sneak and Covert Agent. There‚Äôs not much I can‚Äôt one-shot now and what I can‚Äôt is usually two-shot.
---
It's mutated why wouldn't it give milk? 
---
Ya milk drinker.
---
It's actually kinda funny at the price reactions. Being someone who has been trading items for 3 months I am surprised at how low prices are compared to what the market actually was before vending machines. The influx of players who have low to no experience on legendary prices are either under or over estimating value. If you are selling legendary items for 100 caps you are probably on the under side.
---
Wow, I did not know that - noted!!! Thank you again :)
---
Did you get the free terminal from the atom shop? Check dailies and it'll give you quest markers
---
RudyFN826, I can be on when ever you‚Äôre available. I‚Äôll be home all day
---
It would be amazing for getting people together!
---
I got the mounted stingwing
---
I'm lvl 69 so I don't have the best gear and am looking to start making builds, but I mean best for like just base damage no legendaries so I can pick perks from legendaries later.
---
Well, I have heard the game's engine is old and probably written in some cryptic language, so I completely understand your road block.
---
I like this answer
---
Not to mention you can one shot muties in the head and they almost always drop 4-8? 5.56 rounds.
---
You can clear westek and come out with a net positive of 100+ rounds
---
id rather people unlock their water purifiers, we get thirsty out in the wasteland!
---
I feel the opposite. I hate everything about what they did
---
never saw the place until now, time to earn that explorer badge!
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Tax audit bots! Random encounters  of "You've been identified as a member of the Free states, and have failed to file your taxes properly" get attacked by automated audit bots. And world event "Defend Harper's Ferry from the IRS".
---
Ps4
---
Just to the east of top of the world in the second lake there‚Äôs 3. :)
---
Flatwoods and Cow Lake, just north of the flowers icon on the map, in the Savage Divide.
---
I've never seen that.
---
Already a quest like that
---
Flatwoods should have several roaming around
---
Check the video by innovsurvivalist
---
Flatwoods across the street from the little red rocket there are five. Hop a few times after you milk them and you‚Äôll have milked ten in no time.
---
No, it would kind of end your character.
---
Alright, if you want to truly min max your armor for pure stealth then there are a few things you need.
---
1st two pieces of wood armor. Serious. You need to do missions in the mire until you can enter Raleighs bunker, it's one of Abi's missions. In his bunker in the workshop is the shrouded wood armor mod. This mod gives bonus move speed while stealth, low light stealth bonus, and weight reduction. Two pieces gives max move bonus. Problem is you can't use the mutation with wood armor, as it only has one star slot.
---
2nd Ultra light armor, as armor weight effects stealth, less weight is better. If you can get weightless armor you can use other mods. Shadowed armor is next best.
---
3rd stealth boys or other stealth aid items. I'm personally a fan of gulper slurry, but it's very situational, so...
---
I personally don't find enemies that hard to sneak about, but if you want to punch them in the face without them ever seeing your fist that's how to go about it.
---
Build a Fertilizer Producer and they will come.
---
It should be noted that the voice of set's electric damage only applies to robots.
---
Where is the tourist at in beckly?
---
What's your psn name I can help you out with some melee weapons.
---
I did not realize that. Thank you for the info that is good to know.
---
I know some of those challenges dont work good
---
This system sucks... 
---
At the very least allow for more specific choices for more scrip. Ide pay 300 to guarentee a gatling gun... hell maybe more. I hate this system. Its just more rng
---
Search for "jug fallout 76" on YouTube.
---
Starting the quest?  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/bgmjut/finding_a_tourist_guide_for_getting_your/ 
---
That post is helpful but honestly the easiest way is to go to the Giant Teapot or Wavy Willards and server hop until you see the bright blue tshirt on a corpse.
---
I feel your pain, although I don't mind spending the caps. And I have to admit the preview popup for each vendor is very lackluster, the way it is now. It should at least tell us the lvl of the owner, because I will look for high level players' shops first and foremost.
---
If the owner is at camp, I can of course see their lvl, but having to find their dot elsewhere on the map is just tedium. And of course lvl is not the only important number (players are also emptying their mule characters' inventories, for example), but I also try to judge a shop by numbers of items in various categories.
---
No pics?
---
FMJ could go though the target and only leaves a hole behind, but hp/softpoint creates a large cavity inside and is way more devastating. Gauntlets are deadly but nowhere near 10x.
---
Honestly, if the drill was actually a 3 * legendary it could be pretty fun.
---
I wonder why 'they' bothered including this mod if not for just the fancy name, dissapointing :(
---
u wot, it was always advertised as "you can play it alone just as well"
---
For my stealth marksman build I use a suppressed instigating gauss rifle,  
---
(I use 3x max rifleman, covert op max, bloody mess maxed and tank killer)
---
*other perks are available from all good retailers lol.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a bug, and I would be very careful doing this. Mind you it still a fairly innocuous bug given that, even if the mod becomes a 3\*, they still have an even chance of giving you garbage, but it is still likely unintended
---
Sounds dangerously close to communism...
---
Oof. I got all my armours from pure grinding, took me a long time, got a full function set, nerf, still works pretty well though. I can stand still and still take damage, but it's at a small rate that I can manage, which I'm happy with, never wanted the OP "don't take damage", ruins the challenge!
---
But ahh nope, I don't feel unhappy about the nerf, I'm more glad that it happened!
---
Real Nathans know that Em and m has nothing on Playboy Cart. Die Lit AOTY
---
I got a couple chem plans like the antibiotics plan by going to the whitesprings bunker Medical wing. I traded with the Modus Medical terminals
---
Looks cool! Thanks for the rec
---
Idk... It was in the patch notes. 
---
I haven't been over to check it out yet. Hope it's awesome! There's supposed to be some new lore in there as well  :)
---
With a variant Mr Gutsy named "Death and Taxes" that shouts the benefits of taxation and hates infrastructure freeloaders!
---
Would be cool if you turned scorched and hunted down the vault dwellers to make them "one of us"
---
Try owning a couple of workshops and help defend them in the process to get some good XP, that's how i leveled up well doing other things on the side. It's good extra XP. :)
---
Is there seriously? What's different?
---
I killed 4 of them there yesterday, and I'm sure there were at least 2 more.
---
I forgot that people need to milk them :P  Fortunately they respawn fast.
---
and then what if someone can't use a mic? there's not even a chat lmao
---
Sure... but my point being... blunt force trauma from hydraulically powered heavy equipment is "nothing left but hamburger" type trauma, it's "left a limb behind" trauma, or "torso turned to paste" trauma.
---
Yeah, and the meat rots in your inventory, so get it done fast before it spoils.
---
This is a great idea. I agree, this has been a great update, makes me look foward to the next updates
---
You can get your self in a serious bind if you wander into areas before you are the proper level, even if the quest lines send you there. My suggestion is to go back to the flatwoods area and explore until you are lvl 20. The reason for this is that some areas have a huge range for enemy level, and that enemy level is set by the closest player at the time of enemy spawn. So in your example, a high lvl player was wondering through the area and set the level for the mole miners. Then you stumble in and get murdered.
---
Lol i do the same thing. I hope Bethesda adds perk pack loadouts soon. Also if you have the letters pack you can make your self a reminder on the Wall to swap perks back out when you do it in your own camp.
---
Yup just been there. Instantly lost and confused. gl hf
---
This disadvantage is the ridiculous grind to get a finished one. I‚Äôve used Google more for the exams in the last day than I have in the last two weeks for anything else.
---
We with my quad single-action revolver
---
Thank you for the information. I didn‚Äôt think so, but hate to assume. Cheers!
---
You're correct. They don't within the same category. You get the effect of the last thing you ate. However, if one gives carry weight and one gives strength, then they should stack that way.
---
Not really perked for melee but I have a ghoul slayer mole miners gauntlet that is great.
---
Can't dodge gamma rays as effectively when you're lugging around and extra 120 lbs of crap!
---
Can I get 6 arms like Kollector? Cuz that'd be pretty sweet.
---
( they'll never give us visible mutations though. üòî )
---
You can hoof it, free of charge!
---
Out of the two options you give it's AAE... But explosive weapons aren't optimal for stealth.
---
They would not have needed to nerf TSE is it was not duped to hell and everyone had them. They were way over OP even at low levels. You should not be able to one or 2 shot the hardest enemy in the game. But I blame the dupers that took end game weapons and gave them to everyone and their mother, as the reason for the nerf.
---
Oh I bet
---
/S
---
Do you still have plan? And are you on PS4? I heard there is bug that let u sell it even after learning.
---
Are you following me?!?
---
Thanks for the update! If I find a fix I'll make sure to let you know!
---
They should just fo away with fast travel fees their nothing but annoying at this point. And their are better ways to manage and influence the economy through other means like player vending etc etc.
---
I feel like for low level players and newbies are entering the game when prices are all over the place.
---
It still would be fun to see what happens.
---
Everything. Whole new place. Can't find myself there yet.
---
Then just make it a really cool death animation, and only lose your junk
---
In 7 hours 3 disconnects is my experience on PS4.

But you get this for you loss from me

I'll be getting on in the next 20 minutes or so and will be on for a while. I'll look for your friend invite in-game and accept it, or add you. Come and find me when you get on. IGN: jchamlin
---
where exactly did you read this was a bug, and just wheere did you read it got fixed? ive looked all over the patch notes but i cant find them, please direct me to your proof
---
I mean, you could just put calibrated shocks on your excavator armor, if you log back into the server in it, you'll have easily over 500 carry weight. I think I'm sitting at almost 540
---
You beat me to it! 
---
Didn‚Äôt see this and posted an almost identical response lol.
---
A bloodied will do over 400.
---
Cool thanks I sent you a friend invite already
---
Have you tried checking some of the raider vendors? they now have a plethora of plans for different armor mods. I got my heavy combat armor plans not too long ago but i first had to buy all the light, sturdy etc. plans before the heavy started showing up.
---
Thank you for your effort.
---

---
no PC, did not receive a recipe, as soon as you buy it, it gets learned automatically
---
I did this morning, I'm sure there will be many more.
---
Thank you for this, in all of my previous research I thought I was ok to use mods, but it has been a minute since I've looked all of that up.
---
These posts questioning the legitimacy of using some of these mods got me freaking out that I missed something, and you sir have quelled my fears :)
---
On top of all of the specifics regarding what BethSoft deems as a cheatable offences, it seems pretty clear to me they are trying to stop any form of someone gaining significant advantages over other players or someone who makes it so others playtime is lessened in enjoyment by whatever tool they are using.
---
I can see no reason why the Perk Loadout Manager would fall into this category, as it is just getting rid of needless menu fiddling.
---
Yeah, i tried there like I said, server hopped for an hour. . I'm frustrated. I want to do the challenges especially now that they're essentially forcing us to use the camera with the scout challenges.
---
I saw that video, but it really didn't do much in the way of convincing me that he was on to something.  If you do a specific thing, and 'sometimes' it works...you really don't know what's going on.
---
I wasn't exactly studying the video, but did he actually record an instance where he shows that that happened?  It all seemed a little...iffy to me.
---
I honestly doubt you will complete it.  There is bound to be at least one guy sporting such a wood at all those people to gank he wont be able to contain himself for 8 minutes to finish the event.
---
Democracy is not negotiable.
---
How do you build it?
---
I‚Äôve looked for it for T60 but never ever found the mod or the schematics, so I thought it‚Äôs for x01 only. Two websites say they exist, I‚Äôd love to get one.
---
&gt;It was advertised as a multiplayer game that ‚Äúcould‚Äù be played solo.
---
Is my exact words, that is what it was advertised as. But first and foremost it was advertised as a multiplayer game. I never said it could not be played solo. I said it was advertised as a multiplayer game. I personally bought it to play with friends, not to play it solo. If they wanted it to be a solo game then they would have released it as such.
---
Yeah i saw a criket opean a door and kill me

It's not a tax. It's a service and licensing fee to the Fallout Vending Co., LLC for use of their vending machines.
---
Ah, what unlocks it? Thanks
---
I agree, I‚Äôm not saying that nerf was bad, and I think sometimes nerfing is the right idea, especially in the case of TSEs. However, since then some unnecessary nerfs have come out and my idea is to buff for a while to sustain balance
---
Ugh, all RNG. Man, I just want 5 of the same armor type (appearance + affixes) and it's just never gonna happen.
---
I‚Äôm aware, I didn‚Äôt really mean *only* Explosive. I just meant Explosive *without* TS, eg. the gun I went on to describe.
---
And instead of gaining AP from coffee you'd get drunk :D
---
Awh i see now operation tidy located at kiddie corner cabins is where i can get more. 
---
No didn't get free terminal from atom shop
---
Yes its bugged
---
Yes and it‚Äôs fugly ü§Æ
---
Interesting, i bought that fridge mod and had to use plan.
---
It's from the daily at dolly sods in the mire

Been around for a while and Bethesda still hasn‚Äôt fixed it. Just gotta keep waiting.

Three is a sort of basement entrance that connects to a confusing loop. It does look cool bit you kind have to think to get back out. Or exit to the main menu.

Progressing through the scout quest.
---
Same here, it's not counting for the challenge
---
There's also a couple static spawns for crossbows as well. I found one last night at Middle Mountain Cabins. There should be others at Palace of the Winding Path, in the outside building at Belching Betty, and near Welch, according to the wiki. The couple I picked up were damaged so that should save folks time.
---
"Due to poor rate of acquiring new scouts we aren't just allowing scouts of all ages to join instead we are also allowing use of cheat sheets on exams." -Scout Robot you have to speak to join scouts
---
Yeah dude, you just outlevelled your gun. You could probably craft a normal level 50 one that would do a lot more damage
---
No not the berry mentats haze, it's just a little puff of red smoke then it's gone.
---
Legendary Enemies can still drop zero legendary items. 3 Star Charred Ghoul, nothing but a stimpack on him.
---
Check out the 76 marketplace sub
---
Wasn't their maintenance this morning? I thought that would have been fixed :(
---
There's so much things you can do! Take your time to do all the quests and take time to appreciate what the game has to offer!  Just FYI for your level, everything to the left side of the map youll have low level enemies from your level 1's to 25-30? and everything to the very right of the map would be significantly higher and up to 50-60. Enjoy and Happy Wastelanding!
---
What about my 2 grape mentats, 2 overdrive, 2 daddy-o, and 2 psychotats?
---
I also desperately need someone to do it with on PS4. My PSN is UmbranOverlord. Add me and we can get it done
---
Player vending is a lot more. I‚Äôve been spending more time checking our camps than doing the pioneer scouts. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre not happy with this update, but I think you‚Äôre in the minority.
---
We ever going to get ultrawide support in any of these patches? The majority of everything is still stretched to shit.
---
In all of my playing FO76 (now lvl 185) I‚Äôve only landed a few decent weapons.  One was a 3 star war drum, one was a 3 star explosive machine gun, and one was 2 star explosive shotgun.  I also got a 3 star auto grenade launcher and 2 star minigun.  That‚Äôs it.  I‚Äôve gotten a crap ton of 1 star weapons.  Lots of 1-2 star armor pieces.  A few 3 star armor pieces. 
---
My best weapons I‚Äôve purchased from others, although the 2 star explosive shotty I use a lot.
---
that's unarmed (punching/gauntlet), not one-handed BTW
---
I got about a thousand I think.
---
this guy had the mod plan still, he traded it to me and i learned it automatically then gave it back to him. so i have it with only 1 badge lol
---
Still feel like Christmas I get a bunch of plans and search for explosive weapons , I really should sleep ;)
---
I had something almost identical to this I think vats crit 33%..sold it for 2500
---
Now that's teamwork
---
I dunno, how often do you have to remove an entire wall just to use a pass-through power connector? /s
---
This would be true if there wasn't a cap on how much we can trade in per day. We cannot recoup the value in a reasonable amount of time if there is a cap of 150 per day. As it stand we can only get one three start per day. They need to allow us to turn in more than 150 script per day so that we can immediately recoup a portion of the cost of the shit gear they will give us.
---
I think Path of Exile‚Äôs approach is smarter (than Diablo or FO76). Plenty of RNG but also has mechanics to let players spend more to reduce variation. Take a look at PoE. It‚Äôs genius, and still has a thriving trade market.
---
Always seemed to be North for me, but I haven't really experimented with it to any extent.
---
I have noticed that when I log in (assuming I logged out at camp), I am located where (I assume) my camp base was placed originally.  I can't remember for sure.  But if I teleport back to camp, I'm at the edge kind of like you describe.  Definitely a different location consistently between the two.
---
I built it before the maintenance, so it will probably never register üòî I'll try it at a workshop later. Maybe that'll work...
---
It‚Äôs really weird that this hasn‚Äôt happened yet. At some point this HAD to have been brought up, which means someone said no. It‚Äôs safe to assume someone else asked why that person said no, but what did they say? ‚ÄúWhy make things easier when we can make them harder?‚Äù
---
Ok I will
---
There‚Äôs a BBQ full of them at Morgantown airport...near the back where the cargobot drops those boxes..near the broken plane converted into a home
---
Yes omg
---
I missed that, thanks for the heads up!
---
Yeah this happens to me on average once a day.
---
Punch bowl was being exploited to kill noobs who didn‚Äôt know what nukashine did so they removed its functionality. Presumably that‚Äôs a temporary measure but who knows.
---
I think the assassin sentinel/cavalier needed to be nerfed, there is no place in a multiplayer game that makes a person pretty much invincible. And yes I know the stagger trick, but you cant stagger on first hit every time. And when a lvl 10 shotgun can pretty much one shot almost every enemy in the game, that is OP. those are really the only 2 nerfs I agree with. And I think a lot of stuff needs to be buffed, looking at you Mr. Handy Buzzblade, Ripper, and Chainsaw.
---
Dude said wood teehee
---
No it isn‚Äôt enough. Pc doesn‚Äôt have any chat, emotes are extremely limited in getting the point accords and not everyone has a mic or wants to use it all the time.
---
hunting rifle doesn't have the .38 and 50 receivers &amp; their variants
---
Should grab it, it is free lol but it tracks dailies you haven't done yet
---
Glad you got use out of my compass fix mod while it was relevant!
---
Also glad it's not needed any more because that was a dumb fix. xD
---
I think I've seen one on a grill behind a building in Flatwoods near the enterence. It may also be behind that hotel right before Flatwoods. GL
---
Yesterday the whole server seemed to freeze with connection issues right as the damn thing fucking died.  It didn't right itself after freezing, and I was disconnected without receiving any reward.  It was on the last minute and a half too, the current group that initiated it was having trouble, and I drank a lot of blood to hold two of the pylons myself.  
---
I'm still really sour about it, luckily blood isn't too hard to come by, but I still don't like all that effort going to waste.
---
I'd be less sour if this event wasn't so exclusive.  I don't like that you need flux and a special card to activate this thing.
---
Hm, I did a screenshot as well, I will have another look once I'm back in the game. Thanks, and sorry if I got it wrong!
---
Agreed wholeheartedly
---
I have 48 prime bolts in my shop.
---
Darn. I found like 3-4 the other day. For the life of me cant remember where and it wasnt Camden. Ill update if i remember
---
Yes I‚Äôve found it, thanks.  Need a frog now :)
---
It depends on your level and your build.
---
Up to about L45, I used a L20 vampire machete.
---
So far, I like Blade of Bastet.
---
Black Diamond is second to that.
---
(I have maxed swing speed perks, BTW)
---
The deathclaw and moleminer gauntlet, the meathook variants,  are also good, but do not work when in power armor.
---
But my gotos are fast 1H weapons - cultist dagger and serrated vampire switchblade.
---
Damn I was just there, thanks
---
Travel is still expensive with this perk.  I always check if I can save caps by hitting 76 or my camp first.   
---
I really don't like paying for fast travel..
---
Why not check the map?
---
akdauel1, sorry for late response, teacher took my phone
---
No. Youre character shouldn't be the best at everything/everything within your special ability range all the time, on the fly 
---
I actually think swapping perk cards should be limited to only being done at camps, train stations and Ally camps. 
---
My character, in a matter of a minute can be a maxed out : Shotgunner, one handed melee user, two handed melee user, unarmed user, carry capacity pack animal, scrapper, ammo smith, weapon smith, armour smith, lock picker, hacker etc 
---
It makes for fewer interesting decisions. 76 doesn't even really have builds because of this. It's more of a system of :
---
"Choose a few weapon categories that you want to max out... Then just stick enough pts in the other specials to swap out every useful non combat perk"
---
The term "build" in 76 is literally just weapon based. That's the only decision you have to make.
---
I hope so...though I feel bad for the one I‚Äôve got trapped..he looks so sad ..I‚Äôll do it again (so it registers as done) and then he‚Äôll have a friend lol
---
U wanna risk the stable flux earned? EZ PASS
---
I remember finding some at White Powder Winter Sports before. Maybe just one or two though.
---
Don't forget your silver fork!
---
If you are running shotguns luck of the draw is really good even at level 1
---
Had to pay in Morrowind.  Until boots of blinding speed at least.  :). Or constant effect levitation.  Fuck, I miss that game...
---
Today you win.
---
Same.....I have another caught frog in my inventory to remake if needed. Sure hope I can set him free sooner than later?
---
As stated in another reply not everyone will always remember to check their map. If you logout across the map from your camp you may forget. Not everyone returns home. It‚Äôs a habit you‚Äôd have to form, a notification is just a simple reminder to help
---
Don't even use them anymore, just spray everything hoping to hit something lol I use it the most at Whitesprings since its loud and draws out the ghouls and only weapon I have that won't one shot or drop the health low enough that not everyone can get there hits in for power leveling groups
---
Same. I just keep hoarding to my means. Although, I was mass holding onto every legendary so with vending and the Scrip trade-in starting, I‚Äôve lost 200lbs.
---
Yup I was at 7200ish
---
My problem is constantly teleporting into people's houses and they locked all the doors and I can't go outside to he vending machines.
---
Awh I didn't see that i was wondering what "my personal terminal" was when i was going to peoples camp
---
Silver fork could be deadly, against vampires?
---
Laugh, but I do have a 3\* rolling pin.
---
Executioners with increased swing speed, and reduced damage when blocking.  I modded it to chefs (metal instead of wood).   It does about 100 base.  I want to blade it to see how much different it will be, but dont have the mod on hand...
---
Take my Uptoot for the amazing parody of one of my favorite song. And take my admiration for the creativity. lol
---
I‚Äôm good thanks tho
---
On pc. Had an attachable mod for it for like 10 caps in my watoga vending . Might still be there
---
Pool at whitesprings always spawns a few.
---
He needs to stand on the ledges at WS..he's not strong enough to fight them..so he needs to be somewhere so the ghouls can't touch him
---
Same thing happened to me. After a server hop, I had the same amount as before it freaked out. So I don't think it's actually duplicating them, probably just a display bug.
---
This has given me great ideas. Thank you!
---
What do you need them for? Just curious
---
Luckily I was slowly leveling-up and didn‚Äôt run into too many big weight weapons, but at level 20 or so, I was definitely dropping some damn good legendaries only because I had to.
---
Nuke where?
---
Maybe in it's own mode. PvP in adventure should be minimized unless you're asking for it.
---
Just scrap random combat armour pieces until it is unlocked.
---
Yep. I‚Äôve been buying magazines from vendors and just found out it doesn‚Äôt count towards the challenges.
---
At least they are somewhat easy to make. The only thing I needed to grab was bloodleaf
---
Not sure
---
Dude, I have been working on that one all freaking day.  My crossbow hasn't dropped below 100% yet.....   65 kills including about 20 bashes...
---
Yeah I got duplicate ticks and sold it and someone bought it almost immediately. Keep looking!
---
Still done though the mechanism of mutation
---
Happens sometimes, I came across a scorched roleplaying as a sentry bot. You might have noticed that random enemies like ghouls or scorched will explode like sentry bots/legendary robots do, it‚Äôs a bug that Bethesda introduced a couple patches ago and still haven‚Äôt fixed. It‚Äôs actually killed me a few times.
---
I too associate with the free states faction, and I've found the perfect aesthetic: winter jacket and jeans, blue bandana and the American trucker hat. I will never change this style I love it so much.
---
I also rock a hunting rifle, lever action, and a pump shotgun. 
---
Independence is not a crime!
---
I think everyone is either
---
1. TSE
---
2. AAE
---
3. BE
---
I‚Äôve been going about 10% of suggested prices for most things. So 250=25 caps. Aid has been no higher than 5 caps.
---
Y'all'er aware stuff spawns inside your buildings right? Door or no door things will get inside.
---
correct.
---
Same here! Ha! I‚Äôm purging those bad boys daily!
---
I still think the issue is that there aren't exactly a ton of secondary effects that fit in each effect "slot" there's only 10 of the secondary and 12 of the tertiary.  It's a 10% chance to get the specific secondary effect you want if you only wanted one possibility of the 10.  
---
And while, yes, there are games that let you reroll some of the stats on your gear, there are also looter/shooter games that don't let you re-roll specific stats.  While Diablo 3 *does* allow for it, Diablo 2 did not - you just had Gheed.  And Diablo 3 doesn't have trading, and if you reroll a rare item it becomes bound.  Allowing trading of these items would further unbalance things. 
---
I understand that one week isn't hard coded, but I think that time frame would frustrate people: what do you do the other 6 days during the week?  If it's limited to dailiy, then odds are people are going to get their gear "perfect" pretty fast. 
---
Point being - building a good system that let's people get the legendaries they want, at a reasonable speed, with a reasonable amount of effort, without eliminating the need to actually play the game after isn't easy.  
---
I think this system is reasonable - you can turn a bunch of 1* legendaries into a 3*, if you get a completely crap 3* - you can turn it back into scrip (and 60 cost net isn't bad), if it's 1/2 decent but not something you want - you can probably turn it into some caps that you can use to buy something good, and if it's good you keep it.
---
camden has em next to te chick robot on a long table.
---
dunno if they spawn when the daily isn't up or not
---
I'm only allowed a bike with stabilisers
---
Next Thursday, you'll be able to trade it in for a random Legendary from a vendor.
---
He's honestly the best of the build guides as far as showing you tricks for making unique shaped structures (like rounded walls and such)
---
If you're looking for interesting locations to build (Pre existing structures to build off, or places with certain resources, raider themed etc) check out Decoy's Dungeon. He has a series of "Interesting camp locations)
---
It happened to you too?
---
me too!!!
---
150 income by scraping per character per day. 1,000 scrip cap from data mining reports.
---
I actually kinda like having a limited stash. Makes me think ‚ÄúHMMM? Do I really need 3 Submachine guns that I will never use?
---
Color me corrected then.
---
Yeah had only 400 or so left to build
---
Depending on your build either instigating or bloodied maybe?
---
Naw when it comes to legendary items i have horrible luck.
---
I'll admit I was one of those people who bought a TSE Handmade when they were being duped. So I got one for 2k. Honestly glad I did it at the time. Though I barely use it since I've made a new character and was always afraid of killing myself with it in tight quarters.
---
What the.... well at least you found them!
---
White springs or the burrows is supposed to Be good
---
Eh, it leveled back out to one. I didn't even think it was that controversial. I figured people were downvoting for the "yeah, no shit" reason.

While we're at it, could we have a shot or slug option for shotgun ammo?
---
Why stop there, two extra arms can hold another two-shot Gatling, you‚Äôve got a Four-Shot Gatling now. 
---
Or add an Akimbo perk where you can fire two pistols simultaneously, with four-hands mutation firing two-shots you will be shooting an Eight-Shot pistol üò±

This is actually a great observation, and now it's gonna give me all sorts of heartache when the Purveyor finally releases.  I was all geared up to blow my scrip on 3 star stuff, but now....

Agreed but many put the stuff they find on an alternate character. 
---
I have 3 different characters all at levels between 21 and 157. 
---
I‚Äôd like to separate armor from clothing and legendary items separate from them all...
---
Someone was selling a bloodied explosive handmade for 25k which made me laugh. He'll never sell it based on the fact people won't have 25k caps if they fast travel there. üòÇ
---
I'd say faster fire rate. It's basically a 25% DPS increase.
---
I wish there was an option to add effects to current equipment
---
OP thought it was worth 5000, so they did not spend too much.  They just spent less than what you would have.
---
What console are you on? I‚Äôm having this same issue and if you‚Äôre on ps4 we can help each other get the pictures for the challenges
---
How to you get scrips
---
Wasteland snipers FTW!
---
No it really helped i went to location didn't activate the quest went to the terminal then it reactivated the quest
---
I'm also a stealth marksman. Sometimes I get put in caution with my instigating explosive sniper rifle, but never immediately in danger unless I'm right in front of the enemy/not in stealth.
---
Yeah. It's people complaining for the sake of complaining. 
---
Or fishing for others to agree and justify their faux outrage, because complaining about 76 is the popular thing to do.
---
I'm glad :)
---
between 98 NAR regional and Beckwith farm.  if you are the road, it's on the rock wall on the east side
---
Are you trolling?
---
I had 14 walking canes in storage that I made into scrip last night. 14. And 9 pieces of troubleshooter armor.
---
We all have horrible luck. I used to vendor 99% of my drops for 10-40 caps a piece. Now I will turn them into script.
---
Not only boring but super time consuming.Yesterday i was doing the possum railway challenge.It took my whole game session.Was not able to do other things like Biv ect ect.I mean,the patch its awesome but  this challenges will suck all your playing time and you wont be able to do other things.
---
Adding you now
---
are you on PC? because at the start i thought it bugged because could not find it in my inventory but when i went to a benchmark it appeared in the crafting section
---
Likewise, see Path of Exile. Reduced variation at a cost doesn‚Äôt mean everyone has top tier gear. It seems some people missed some great games.
---
Thanks !
---
I am one set of steps down from the greeting Mr.Handy at the vault. 4 vending machines. A 10 room motel, all the crafting benches and musical instruments you could want, a large garden, and a couple of open water purifiers.  
---
I love when I see a new player leaving the vault.  I make a level 5 set of deep pocket leather armor to start them off
---
It‚Äôs literally a normal death but with a cooler animation, are you suggesting we remove death as a whole?
---
You can fast travel to them too
---
Is that the auto stim? I guess the percentage might but personally I‚Äôd run 1 and leave space for more useful options.
---
Unless you‚Äôre trying to build an unkillable pvp toon lol.
---
My favourite is the ghouls that stay in their laying down spawn positions, but slide across the floor and attack with invisible radiations beamz.
---
What does becoming petrified have to do with pvp?
---
I've checked Antoine several times. He doesn't have it.
---
Is anyone else unable to place their stored houses down because i cant it just says floating cant place
---
**Edit:** I have also noticed that plans which I can place have developed issues with pillars and items that were once sitting on top of pillars.  My pillar with a bunny and some potted plants sitting on it is now floating with the potted plants intersecting and the bunny completely gone.
---
The only effect this would have would be an increase in :
---
"I got killed by x number of people with x weapon today Bugthesda. This is your fault for allowing duping/you need to nerf this immediately" posts.
---
fast traveling is one of the few things I can spend caps on.
---
Until someone figures out how to use the welcome mat to set you up in a Jigsaw trap room.
---
Um....I would walk there for that gun. 25k caps is on the low side. You could probably flip it immediately for 50k.
---
Am I reading that right, the max scrip you can get from the machine is 150? Is that daily? Per machine location?
---
There's a couple at the Gorge Junkyard Workshop as well
---
Setting up near or close by to Vault 76 helps a lot since it‚Äôs a free fast point.
---
It in no way was just as bad. It didn‚Äôt have a range nerf, just an accuracy issue if you were using VATS/hipfire. And that‚Äôs still the same now. Literally the only change was the damage value. 
---
The nerf was absolutely necessary. 
---
You had a legendary effect that literally doubled your damage. Next best thing for non-bloodied builds were instigating (only first shot/if target was full health) or anti armor (at best 28% more damage, worse depending on your other armor piercing boosts and your damage vs enemy armor). 
---
For a bloodied build you still only got ~60% damage, for having to stay at 20% health. TS was 100% damage for almost no downside unless you were a VATS user. 
---
And that‚Äôs not even talking about explosive. 
---
Does that sound balanced to you?
---
Again, why would anyone use a bloodied weapon if it did the same as TS? The risks of a bloodied build are far worse than a TS build.
---
I'm on xbox and would be happy to have another traveling buddy. GT is same as my reddit name.
---
I'd be okay with that tbh.
---
Are you checking at night? I don‚Äôt know if it is true or anecdotal, but I have only seen them bloom at night.
---
I started the event but then it bugged out in the Gather Items phase... I picked up the Occult Tomes and Camper's Backpack, but the other items were nowhere to be found, even though my compass said I was standing right next to them (wherever I went).
---
Same. Hopefully this'll fix it.
---
Had that problem but at watoga high school
---
I will help. What's gamertag?
---
Ah yes, but I'm not always bloodied. That said my bloodied weapon is a melee.
---
Bloodied does that now, and it shouldn't, maybe 35 so it's still better but it's broken and you with 4he right armor and perks it's risk free, it needs a nerf you just abuse it
---
It‚Äôs glitched.  Will have to wait for a patch, the whole challenge is.
---
aminsino. When can you hop on?
---
Just as there's no proof this is a bug, there's no proof it was a feature. The perk that overrepaired armor and weapons did not say that it provided a Dr/DMG buff to weapons, so I'm assuming it's a bug that got fixed last patch. That's my take on this issue.
---
Edit: I'm not saying I didn't like it, but if it was indeed a bug, it needs to be repaired. If this was a feature, the perk needs a new description.
---
Most of the doors are boarded up now and the inside looks more like fallout and less "dirty shopping mall"
---
Think you've gotten confused there's two very similar, Auto stim uses a Stimpak when low on health and the life saving one revives you when you're down.
---
You should get a couple more grannies together and start the Appalachian chapter of Maud's Muggers...but you're mugging people with kindness. Rolling pins are a requirement for your primary weapons (they're actually quite good).
---
I‚Äôll add you rn man
---
I agree. Whenever I‚Äôm at max i know it‚Äôs time to sell the less needed junk I have stocked up.
---
I go and snag the plans to both quantum paint and nukacola paint everytime I log on. I also hit up the alien dome and grab the plans and ammo.
---
Ok sent you a friend request
---
PS4
---
I havent seen any type of raider armor from vendors and ive looked around
---
One of the side quests takes you deep in the mire where there no cap on enemy levels, so while you can technically start it at any time it'll be awfully tough to do solo if you're under level 50.
---
Hapened to me once too. Just find another event.
---
lol - yes, and for the people commenting about how good the info was... without reading the comments.
---
This should definitely be a note in the patches. Its nice to sell to wanderers without... *those* type of players instantly showing up.
---
I'm in now. But let me finish this challenge real quick 5 mins I'll be in your game. Do you know a place we could get this?
---
I over look all off cranberry bog. I nuked Watoga yesterday just so visitors could enjoy the view.
---
Likewise.  I imagine before it was possible to buy god rolls for caps, but nowadays the only way to break into that market is grind for ridiculous amounts of time so you naturally get some number of god roll drops or to constantly browse the marketplace to find it on some new trader's listing (who doesn't know the value) and grab it cheap before anyone else does.  With the caps limit, long-time traders sit on god roll gear as a store of wealth and will typically only let them go if there's some other god roll gear they really want or they can get a better value in trade and increase their wealth.
---
It's frustrating to look through some people's inventory and see they're sitting on 19 B25s and 16 BEs (a real example) among other great rolls people are looking for.  I understand they have no other real way to store wealth but that leaves everyone else having to be satisfied with the crumbs.
---
At least give us armor conversion please, there are too many types for me to get the type I want let alone the affixes so everything is mismatched. I been very specifically looking for Trapper/Weightless/25 Rad Resist/Detection and in 582 hours I've found 0 with that exact combo and this isn't really going to help that too much.
---
Well if someone paid $120 for it, now he may feel like there was an instant $30 depreciation. Some salt is understandable.
---
Yeah okay. 
---
Do you know if it‚Äôs attached to on of the limbs or chest? 
---
I‚Äôve discovered that scrapping only gives you mods to the specific limb scrapped. 
---
So just wondering if I need to be aware of what limbs I‚Äôm scrapping or just CB armor in general to get the BOS helmet. 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
Yeah I just go thru and take out stuff I don't use alot and drop it at overseer's / trainstations / whitesprings
---
I removed all doors except 1 that goes to a cliff access; dogs keep getting in. Input a 0 lock and every day someone unlocks it lol. Theyre willing to punish themselves just to keep a door open.
---
Great point. That Skyrim guild complaint was what attracted me to Elder Scrolls back during Morrowind. I could specialize or be a jack-of-all-trades. And if I spent countless hours going for full completion, I became a master-of-all. Then I cranked up the difficulty and had a blast. Fallout adopting the dynamic difficulty setting made a somewhat similar approach. It's a true RPG: specialize or not, pick your challenge, or fully explore on easy mode.
---
Yes same, guess ive gotta go back to the ol x01 then
---
I think we don't need more damage weapon. I would like if those weapon to be more strategic weapon. Like, because they make noise, they could bring the aggro on the player, so it would be perfect for a tank base player. Everyone is build around domage, we need to be able to have role to be better in team. 
---
By exemple: the tank could go first, bring tge crowd together and than the damage dealer could kill the crowd.
---
Let me know what you thing!
---
It‚Äôs too bad that no one really likes the Free States in the FO76 grouping and there‚Äôs no real player clans on it
---
I don't use a mic. When people have asked I just shake my character's head no. Seems to have always gotten the point across.
---
Is there a reliable way to get legendarys? I havent been playing the game touch recently,  im only level 73 i think and i mostly end up gettin butt weapons and armor.
---
Not... us.
---
If it helps to know, I skipped the gym this week after work to try to get a backpack ASAP and I still haven‚Äôt accomplished that. Lesson learned I guess is gym first, 76 second!
---
Maybe a river or something. Im assuming wed need a creature to down you in a body of water so im going to the mire and im going to try to lure something near one of the lakes there
---
I guess door griefers are the new meta.  Had someone open all 8 of my doors yesterday.  I couldn't be mad.  They got every single one.  Now had they only opened a few?  That'd be upsetting as that's just being lazy.
---
I expect it's an unintended consequence
---
Thanks! I will give it a go!
---
Cool does anyone know why we can't have a food and drink tab too?
---
Like the ones that go with chameleon mutation? What kind of effects
---
Look in the "World" section of the challenge menu and scroll down to the tadpole challenge section. Each badge requires passing the exam and doing 6-10 other random tasks like killing specific creatures, taking pictures of stuff, etc.
---
Yea I‚Äôm in x01 most of the time largely because of the recon sensor.
---
I build my very first PC a month ago, I will add you tomorrow!
---
Daily. Remember how it used to be 200 caps per vendor, 1400 caps per day? It's 150 scrip per day, no matter what machine. Your cap is 1000. That's 6.5 days.
---
ive got 3 of those bugged.
---
Why such an exaggerated response? It's a story and franchise I care about and based on the poor rollout and missteps thus far there is a real possibility it could end up like many other online only games and end without a way to play it. 
---
Why is this sentiment worth the derision?
---
Wanderers such as yourself, should make your way to the Bards college in Solitude
---
Ah, I follow you now! In that case utilise both? Lol
---
One set on the rooftop of the city where the Mothman location is.
---
Yea, will be azm for pvp üôå
---
I  suspect that you will mostly get ghoul slayer and troubleshooter effect for weapons and maybe the same for armor.
---
That‚Äôs so great!! I‚Äôm not quite that well established, but I do have all the crafting benches, a few water purifiers, instruments, crops, and beds. (And selling chems/stims/some ammo on the cheap for lower levels.) Set up right behind the lumber mill. üòä
---
If they're resolved as eight separate explosions (unlike normal shotguns, where the pellets are combined before the DR calc), then they'd be substantially worse against a single target, while single-shot explosive weapons would be better.
---
Your theory is also plausible though. I haven't seen any vaguely scientific testing, and I don't have an explosive shotgun myself.
---
it's 150 scrip daily max.
---
Personally that's what I use. Not sure if they stack though.
---
Gulper lagoon should work when we meet up w'll kill all but one gulper and then let it kill us in the water while the other revives
---
Will do! Any suggegstions for cool side quests?
---
No it doesn‚Äôt do that right now. At 20% bloodied is ~60% boost. If you are trying to count perks and mutations... those apply to someone with a TS weapon just the same. And in no fucking case is it risk free. With the same perks and armor a full health TS build is less at risk. 
---
Stop trying to bring things other than the weapon legendaries into this; anything else can be used just the same on both, so it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdifference‚Äù. You can run a low-health TS build if you want to; it‚Äôs not a good idea to use TS over bloodied if you ARE running a low health build, but pre nerf, TS was hands down the best on any build. Which is dumb design, poor balance, whatever you want to label it, it was bad. 
---
YOU just want to be OP.
---
Had no idea nice PSA!
---
Bloody mess does
---
The one that just sold had three effects
---
Won‚Äôt effect Chameleon
---
+1 perception 
---
Junk reduced by 20%
---
Im on now
---
No I want balance not that
---
Okay. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs the same for me, then.
---
Wow good thinking! So to sum it up, musical instruments attract the aggression of enemies to the user. It would be awesome if this was implemented along with some of the other ideas I've read here.
---
I have several locations bugged - I was able to get some of them to trigger by switching to a low level character and having a friend go there / fast travel to them - but it did not work for all of them - Toxic Valley / Cranberry Bog still bugged. 
---
It also says I've never killed a Scorchbeast queen and I've done that plenty of times :/
---
Sounds good man, I can craft quite a bit of stuff if you provide me the materials (I'm pretty low as of late or else I'd donate them myself)
---
I also have quite a few duplicate plans and recipes.
---
Free Range event?
---
All the V Fast weapons are devastating if properly prepared. Although the Chain Saw says slow, that's just to get started.
---
 I have seen 57 on a buzzblade and almost that on a chainsaw. They tick fast.
---
u/CarterG4 you.
---
Anyone remember the giants ball sack in Saga?
---
I've used this mod since release and i can't imagine playing without. Please stop the hand wringing and use it if you're on PC. Bethesda is clearly OK with it.
---
The real price of bullets is what people will pay for them. That's how capitalism works, and that's how we do it in the U.S. of A. Get out of here with your communist ideas traitor!
---
Stay to the west for now.  Flatwoods, south explore in clockwise fashion.  Each new place discovered gives XP and the enemies are lower level.   Do events in that area too, including Leader of the Pack when it spawns.  I think you are high enough level to take on Grafton in the north as well.  Then Ash heap stuff.  Savage divide, then mire and cranberry bog area last.   Explore!  Every once in a while, go back to main quest.  Oh,  and do side quests in each zone.
---
Thanks! I really like the map so far! But it might be best to stick to the left side for now lol
---
Could you explain why?
---
Ok turning in my challenge now be there shortly.
---
I figured that out myself, and looked it up to confirm - bit of a shame
---
If you really really want to max it out, since it's 150 scrip per character and not account you could turn in up to 750 a day with the 5 characters you can have.  Just need to find someone to sit there watching your stuff in a paper bag while you transfer it between your toons.  But I'm thinking the item given will be based on your level so you'd want to level them all up to 50 if so.
---
You deserve the Wasteland Recycler Award
---
Agreed.
---
Lots of server disconnects last night, had one right after I‚Äôd picked up a 3* piece of armor I‚Äôd have actually used, and a pretty decent fight to get it. When I logged back in the game had kept track of all the resources I‚Äôd spent, but not anything I‚Äôd looted afterward.
---
I get around that by having one machine list clothes and loot like plans and maps.
---
Armor and weapons go in their own store.
---
Ammo it's own.
---
Aid and misc gets its own.
---
Just my way of keeping it organized. Even put the signs on them to point out what each machine has.
---
&gt;Can't you just look on the map?
---
You can, but as a non PA user camped in the safe zone I always log out at home. Logging into a nuked Whitesprings once was all I needed to lean that lesson.
---
I am down for some Bowie Knife mods please! Take my upvote!
---
Itsacapsink.
---
Or have Bethesda make it look more like an aquarium then a jar...especially if they have those huge arms ..can‚Äôt be comfortable
---
Omg style points.
---
He means secondary effects.
---
Add me: siestafied
---
how does one do that?
---
I can help you - add me - dignite.
---
I've done mine so I'll just help you.
---
OK sounds good. Im right outside the lagoon.
---
Great point. I avoid PA as much as possible. As a stealth rifleman, I had a moment where my build was OP, but now I only survive from a distance. By contrast the bloodied melee build is the new OP build, which I am weak against. Class balance created organically though Bethesda patches. So if I'm a traditional ranger, and melee the barbarian, and anyone in PA is a knight tank... now we just need a decent healer class to emerge outside of item (mis)use.
---
No I'm not, unless I miss looked. you can see the camp vending machines in survival.
---
Sure just add MisterWick
---
I quit because of inventory. Either bigger stash or junk shouldn‚Äôt count toward stash.
---
It's a bug nvr been in survival but got it last night
---
Yea it takes around 10-15 after pricing the item to scroll, or either you have to back out and go back in. I‚Äôm on Xbox btw.
---
I did it again after maintenance and it still didn't work.
---
We need "Unique items" stash box. Whats the point in me trying to sell any kind of heavy weapon when its 40+ weight in my stash box? It makes it impossible to be a true heavy weapons vendor.
---
We need items in the vendor to not weight anything and be its own thing. Separate from the stash box.
---
If someone paid $120 for it they're an idiot.
---
I bought a 3-star one from a player vending machines yesterday very cheap that I've modded up a little. Every one I've used to date has been useless so I'm hoping some love from Bethesda the SMG will become worthy.
---
You completed the weekly challenge. It was supposed to be in Survival mode only, but it was bugged so you are able to complete it in Adventure mode.
---
Very good idea. 10/10
---
I'm saying is there a market for them? I feel like most people have these plans by now.
---
Cool beans thx
---
Or make it so you can't switch while in combat and only once every 15 mins. Or something along those lines.
---
ah, that explains it ty
---
Of course friend, I‚Äôve made a lot of caps just from a few hours of selling
---
Well what kind of look are you going for? There's a lot of outfits to pick from- some are much easier to get than others.
---
Could be, I don't do pvp but it tracks hard-to-see mobs so effectively. In sheepsquatch battles I know all the time where she is even whe she's invisible üëå
---
back in that day everyone had unlimited weight with the pocketed exploit too. good times.
---
phrasing!
---
If you want to level up more and kill enemies within your level. There‚Äôs a mill on the top left of the map where there‚Äôs a lot of super mutants. Good for XP farming if you want to level up quicker. I built my base there for the longest time until I got to level 40ish haha.
---
.....that started LONG before the 90's.
---
 And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History becomes Legend. Legend became myth.....
---
Not so far, for me
---
Even if the legendary vendor is worthless, it's still a way to get rid of the legendaries that literally no one would ever use. I'm looking at you junkie's/troubleshooter/nocturnal. I have 299 scrip right now, and I haven't even sold all of my crap their stuff yet. I have maybe 8 useful legendaries in my stash out of 40 left.
---
You sold it for half of what its worth :O
---
my Camp is completely open, with easily accessible workbenches including Pa and stashes.  The house itself is always unlocked, even a patio overlooking the river and plenty of seating.   Two beds, multiple instruments on both levels.
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to play since the update; I‚Äôm looking forward to popping up a vending machine and entertaining.
---
Beer hat
---
I've ran into self destructing Super Mutants and Scorched. Watch out.
---
Normally you literally just ask that and people give a thumbs-up or down. No issue. What we do need is a TURN YOUR F&amp;\^%KING MIKE OFF emote...
---
I can see that, but I don't like going back home at the end of a session in case when I come back I need to do something in that area(like Daily Challenge) and don't want to waste caps and time to fast travel back.
---
Fast travelling anywhere is bugged, have to try at least 2-3 times before it works.
---
Heard of Bloodied Explosive.  Thats the real meta.
---
I used to live in a town that was once the largest copper mine in the world (and not in America). Back then the miner were paid money but the company didn't provide housing so the miners had to build their own, after work. One caveat for working in that mine was they had to attend church which was Wesleyan or lose their job.
---
Ever since fo3 I've wanted a true ghoul or super mutant race type to choose from, I think in fo76 it would be absolutely amazing.
---
Take more than 20 seconds to read and think about what I‚Äôm writing then, because TS was waaaay the fuck unbalanced. It‚Äôs fairly well balanced against the other top-level legendaries right now (furious/instigating/AA/TS/Bloodied are the top level; mutants, enemy-specifics are second tier; quad/double can be between first tier and third tier depending on your goals and what weapon you get them on; nocturnal, berserker, junkies, stalker are bottom tier imo)
---
Again, bloodied has *significant* downsides to take advantage of it. You‚Äôre literally losing 4/5ths of your health to get 2/3 more damage (again, I‚Äôm just talking about the weapon effect, because again, everything else can applied to other weapon effects just as equally).
---
It was! I don't disagree. But I want berserkers and a few other effects like furious to be as good as bloodied then we can talk. You don't want it to get nerfed, because you enjoy it, more playstyles should be usable
---
They've since fixed it &amp; it operates in game again. I prefer the nukacrypt version myself as I'm already there using it to plan the build anyways, so I haven't updated.
---
here you go : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmmqlj/mama\_murmrghs\_mystery\_pick\_always\_the\_best\_pick/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmmqlj/mama_murmrghs_mystery_pick_always_the_best_pick/)

It was meant for the person who started the post. I saw Air Force and I assumed he was prior service. I am sorry of I offended anyone i didnt mean too.

Will do. I‚Äôm at work right now but will probably be  be on later tonight.
---
Wading in tighty whiteys shooting at my feet.  Good times!
---
Tbh I would pay money to do this
---
Got to handle it to you it is pretty sweet, it should also say No Blade  nyuk nyuk nyuk
---
None of those things are different than they were before the most recent patch. Literally the only thing about shotguns that was changed was their erroneously benefiting from 100% damage increase from the explosive legendary modifier rather than the 20% they were supposed to be getting, like every other legendary explosive weapon. If you are complaining about the generally poor weapon balance in this game, that is a MUCH more involved subject, and not at all what this post was about.
---
Yeah, I think it'd feel a lot more rewarding if you could pick a pistol or shotgun or 1-handed weapon. We all build our characters around this stuff, so it'd feel a lot better to spend on something we could at least use, even if it's not perfect. 
---
Even if it cost 500 scrip for a type of weapon, it'd still feel better.
---
Haha I‚Äôll be at work later.
---
I think if theres multiple they can finish you off when you get wounded
---
You sell your legendaries to the new automated collection points at every train station.
---
It doesn't matter. I got mine by scrapping a combat chest piece for example.
---
Did you find one? I've been looking for one too, encountered all types of Mirelurks except hunter so far.
---
Exactly. With all these new updates we are bound to get more unique weapons and outfits, maybe I'm just too stubborn to give them up but I like having a nice collection.
---
Not if I get there first! //water thief
---
I think it's on purpose. Proof the socialist capitalism works! Sorry, "social market economy"
---
That‚Äôs when you log in with your second account and FT over to top you off.
---
Thank you Apexigod!
---
That makes sense! Thank you.
---
I've played them all. And I love them uniquely. But to play devil's advocate a bit... FONV was soooooooo slow at first. Possibly the worst ramp up. I quit so many times at first.
---
Someone's got to.
---
"Now we just need (there's always a "Now we just need...") a better way for people to trade gear without going through out-of-game channels like Reddit."
---
Plop your camp down and put your item in the vending machine. You both do this obviously, and then you can see the item you want in there at the agreed upon cap cost, before completing the exchange.
---
Not perfect, but better than dropping paper bags hoping the other guy does too.
---
2 handed melee perk cards work like slugger I'm pretty sure
---
I don't think this table makes sense.
---
Maybe just a crossed out line saying [sold] for just the particular session?
---
Turn in legendaries to the scrapper machines at every train station
---
WHATS IN THE BOX??
---
WHAAATS IN THE BOX?????
---
I agree. Having items weigh nothing in the vendor would be nice.
---
Good point. I'm hoping by the time they make private servers they find a way to blow our minds with NPCs.
---
Go for it, that's why I lock some but not all of it.
---
Why shouldn't it? Value is subjective, not an absolute based only on intrinsic properties. Why do people go after things like tomahawk plans and snallygaster spit attack explosions?
---
&gt; Power armor doesn't need to be legendary, that would be fucking excessive.
---
At the moment, yes, but power creep is inevitable in games like this. Eventually they'll add level 100+ enemies to challenge high level players, and higher level loot will inevitably come along with it.
---
Taunts would be a nice addition for things like the SBQ fight / Sheepsquatch but not really needed anywhere else right now until the raids come out / if the raids are hard enough to require it. There are some perks to make like a "battle-medic" kind of build right now tho which is kind of nice for people who wanna support instead of fighting.
---
Things are the same as they use to be waaaaaaaaa
---
Or you can just continue on with your day and let someone who wants to be helpful answer his question instead of wasting your time telling him to search himself. ü§î
---
tyvm
---
Yeah, they made HUGE improvements with today‚Äôs update! Super happy with it! Thanks Beth!
---
stash or inventory?
---
Thanks and you're very welcome. Have a good one
---
I can literally hear this üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes, do you know where the abandoned house is down below Watoga? Its marked on the map and is next to a mirelurk queen spawning spot
---
Yep you too!
---
You're welcome. üëç
---
why on earth would you want to encourage this? There are 3.7 people subscribed to this subreddit logged in right now. 
---
Do you really want every single "wait, is this BASIC FUCKING INFORMATION GOES HERE a thing yet" question? Because that's how you flood the subreddit with garbage posts like this.
---
I hope they have something in the works to fix this. I didn‚Äôt think about making a new character, I‚Äôll try that thanks for the suggestion.
---
\+karma
---
I know your pain.
---
I would love a FOV slider on console. Idk why they didn't add it to console when it was added to PC lol.
---
yes please, irons are shit and hipfire is too random
---
So it's an other bug that adds up.  
---
Because before the 200% (at 100% and lower), there's 60 base dr missing. If to those 60 missing DR there's also the bonus def you should get that is missing, it starts to be a lot of stuff missing.
---
Berserkers and junkies both need some love (although I think the latest patch actually fixed the biggest problem with Junkies? I need to reread the patch notes. Losing addictions on death was a huuuuuge downside to junkies. 
---
Without that... fully addicted, I believe junkies does more raw consistent damage than AA or TS, just with minor SPECIAL penalties. The problem was the chem costs to get re-addicted each time you died. 
---
Berserker definitely needs some love- maybe tiered level-based armor benchmarks. Like, at level 5, you can have up to 10 armor and still get full value. At level 50 or higher, you can have up to ~50 armor and still get full value. Or something of that nature; exact values TBD. And that should ONLY count armor from things you wear, not armor from mutations or other buffs (bodyguard perk, ironclad perk, etc)
---
Where?
---
I'm a sucker for the Mystery pick I took 1 look and said that's the one I want. I just hope they don't roll low level gear if you're a high level player.
---
I just want a scope other than the recon scope that isn't terrible. Every other scope is slow, delayed, and unreasonably shaky to the point of being unusable other than for a sniper scope with breath holding.
---
It's the perfect meta, tho!
---
That the two things would be linked somehow.  Proximity of the seller and the ability to Inspect an item.
---
That's why I do it! Free water for all!
---
Precisely. I sell 2 per day to the robots for 500 each and the rest get sold to players for 2-300.
---
I hope so too. Hopefully that might get you the last couple you need.
---
sometimes it just works
---
And the downsides to Bloodied necessitate that it be overall more powerful. High risk high reward is a playstyle choice that‚Äôs *good* to have.
---
It wasn‚Äôt in the patch notes BSG employee replied to someone‚Äôs post it was like a week ago on this sub
---
I'll 100% be downvoted for saying, but the only thing I don't like is the limit on how much scrip I can earn per week per character. As it is right now, I have to log on to 10 characters between my 2 accounts every day and transfer 3-4 3 star junk legendaries to each, turn those in to max their daily scrip, then repeat every 24 hours so I can hit 10K scrip on each.
---
For those interested, I'll be maxing out my scrip on 10x characters and doing the Mystery Pick x15 on each.
---
Ok Mr. Whiteknight. I wasn't talking about how much i would pay for it. But how much the thing is valued. You can go to any trading reddit / discord and the price of that rhing will be 500-1000 caps max.
---
I would totally buy a 3\* Broadsider with the right effects. lol. COuld you imagine a quad Broadsider with the multishot mod for it?
---
I hopped back into fo76 and was mega surprised to find out they didnt have one.
---
Fake news pretty much stretches into every aspect of culture. It‚Äôs up to us to be responsible consumers of information, and publicly set the record straight when we see false reporting.
---
I would like a new effect that boosts damage the more armor your wearing making PA have a good weapon thing to have
---
Is it a beta character? Maybe the reason
---
I thought PVP was bad and you were had for engaging in it?
---
No wonder the milk tastes funny.  ü§¢
---
Hope to see you both, always game for a team up.
---
I was thinking about this again last night, but my first concern has always been Starched Genes. They'd have to be very careful to make sure swapped profiles didn't disrupt that.
---
Nope, Isn't a beta character
---
I always ran the military fatigues and gas masks. But since all that badass sheepsquatch shit came out I've been a cultist lately:p
---
Trying to do this part of the quest right now and cleared all creatures from Dolly Sods, but didn't get any award for it.  Wonder if we also have to claim the work shop? I wont claim b/c not interested in PVP.
---
I honestly don't remember 76 ever being *that* dark, except in the Mire.  Where Campfire Tales takes place though, at the top of a hill, I wouldn't expect it to get very dark.
---
I'm really enjoying it and play often as well. I'm almost ready to say "my favorite". 
---
I like it so much that I gave the devs a few bucks more by finding a copy of collectors edition, flaws and all in that edition. The bag really is disappointing. 
---
I haven't supported them with atom shop cash, because I think Bethesda still has some proving to do from the crappy launch before they can start making money from that avenue. I'm warry of the repair kits they are selling and the shameless nerfs they put out frequently. So I'd rather appear to them as another purchaser and potential 2nd player, than a MMO whale. Still, I felt buying another copy of the game is a way to support Bethesda's hard work. I may go buy some copies of the game for my friends to try it out, now that the bugs are mostly gone.
---
I‚Äôm in power armor :(
---
It was actually released in the patch Tuesday, along with all the scout quests, and player vending. The Maintenance today was just for server stability.
---
Is there anyway to reconnect to a server? Would you have to friend a person on the server?
---
What? Don't understand your comment
---
I‚Äôll say bloodied build deal much more dps if you build it right
---
.... no. Do you understand balance? ‚ÄúHey, we see you‚Äôre hella buff in this area- we‚Äôre going to reward that by making you hella buff in THAT area as well!‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs low risk high reward. That‚Äôs unbalanced.
---
That‚Äôs not how balance works.
---
No kidding!?
---
I always wear the Science Scribe Outfit matched with Medical Goggles and a Surgical Mask (Gas Mask when needed). Fits together nicely.
---
I used to wear the Farmhand Clothes and a Newsboy Cap for a traditional settler look. The Sack Hood/Sack Hood w/ Hoses can be swapped in if you want to look like a deranged serial killer from a movie.
---
That name is hilarious.
---
Oops I responded to the wrong comment. Someone else said that you should be able to play as a scorched. My bad.
---
So they will rant about a 10% tithe to a totally renewable (free) currency in-game for a totally voluntary set of in-game actions but not that the atom shop prices are about 50% too high across the board.
---
Maybe, only a buff in PA, because regular armor already has legendary effects
---
Yeah, i was looking for a bloodied explosive one, but i got a bloodied faster fire rate i just want to know if FFR is good as explosive
---
I plan on selling legendaries from my mule. Level doesn't matter too much.
---
His health may have been lower than yours. His max HP is probably lower too. And he could have taken on rads as well.
---
I'm the lowest level (at about 80 now) on my squad and often ghouls will run past me toward 100+ folks on my team. Most that I play with are bloodied. I'm not.
---
Agreed, or be, aae, tse laser rifles. There is no in between. Lol
---
Ok, I'll get on soon(ish)
---
MiissThaang
---
Because nobody provides any proof they just link names exactly what you‚Äôre doing now. If you post just one TINY damn video PROVING that he‚Äôs a scammer without any reasonable doubt then bam maybe you‚Äôll get your wish. Idk why this post is even up without evidence it‚Äôs considered witch hunt
---
there‚Äôs a label that has to come up on the top right of the camera UI for it to count as a picture taken at X location
---
hope that helps!!
---
I really would love for some more ways to align with factions in game.
---
Faction outfits, CAMP items, quests, perks.
---
They really have a huge opportunity to expand on that aspect of the game.
---
Same. I thought it was my controller at first. Sometimes changing tabs will help, but not always.
---
I'm joking. Before survival any pvp discussion usually resulting in insults toward the OP for "griefing" and ruining other peoples games
---
As evident from the firebreathers excavator, they‚Äôll expand on this. I feel like at first it‚Äôs only going to be the Responders, and then they‚Äôll dabble with either the Enclave or BoS. I can imagine the Free States are going to be on the back burner for a long time.
---
Okay badass
---
Interesting I run bloodied a lot as well I wonder if the low health has anything to do with it! Thanks everyone for the tips this is awesome
---
This. TSE is garbage now. I mean its better than nothing... but only a little.
---
Not encouraging it, just saying you wasted your time telling the OP to Google it and even googled it yourself. All that could have been used to answer their question. If you don't want to answer their question just ignore it and continue scrolling. There's not much of a point to prove by telling them you googled it yourself and found the answer.
---
As a general rule FFR is better for PVP, and E is better for PVE.  But both are equals overall, IMO.
---
It's kind of tedious, but you can use the tiny letter set to write signs on your walls. I wrote "buying stable flux -40 caps each. Msg me if I'm not home" on the wall next to a vending machine, and several people took me up on the offer. Once I had what I needed I just hung a painting on the wall to cover the letters.
---
That's why it's not locked in the first place.
---
Yeah but most casual players aren't going to take the time to go to a trading reddit or discord.  Sounds like you're mad because this particular customer is fucking up your , "in game economy"
---
i‚Äôve been wearing the impostor sheepsquatch garb since i got the second piece i needed
---
it‚Äôs my favorite
---
You can't take those.  They are part of the Chow Line daily quest.
---
Weirdly, they don't count as food during the quest either.
---
Just gotta make sure you include in all your builds. ;) My idea was the swapping perk cards only.
---
Same. On xbox. Have to enter and reenter the machine for each individual item.
---
Spoiler tag? Also you have any proof or just throwing this aroundüòÇ I have seen the new dupe method as it‚Äôs crashed my worlds multiple times (that‚Äôs the server instability btw not whatever BSG wants you to believe) but I‚Äôve seen zero TSE laser‚Äôs for sale btw. Not any vending machine, not any post on all of Xbox LFG. Sooooo
---
I like the idea of getting someone well tuned by bashing them over the head with a guitar.
---
When I first played during beta - the night in the forest was almost as dark as the mire is now at night
---
Exactly and if its about trading itll always be at your own risk.
---
I‚Äôve never had anything spawn inside my camp. Not once.
---
Plus if he's got any caps at all he's losing those to the ether.
---
So stupid it was needed at least. Meanwhile I made "Speak Up Biv" which was simply his audio files boosted. Because. Well...  the same reasons I guess.
---
LOL not necessarily, some people simply have cash but little patience.
---
Hmm. Im gonna have to hop on and complete my goal of 100k of each ammo. 
---
What kind of stuff does the new vendors offer?
---
Yeah some of my challenges have reset as well, like my repair a blunt weapon is at 1,when I played with a super sledge for a good while and should be way up there. I'll try restarting, but who knows if that will do the trick or if my progress is truly lost :(
---
It's not even that bad of a nerf. 75% chance is pretty reasonable. I wish they'd focus on some weak legendary effects. All they've done to legendary effects is nerf them, haven't seen a single buff.
---
It always doubles the total amount for me, with ammosmith and chemist
---
I need to send you evidenceüòÇ some dude was selling a bloodied explosive laser for 13k today
---
Yeaaah no, thats wrong. Communism is not authoritarian. Communism in no way impedes upon your personal freedoms in order to enforce strict obedience to the state. Thats just a line Right wingers use to convince people that dont know enough that communism is evil. Authoritarian dictatorship can be communist, but not all communist states are Authoritarian. Capitalist governments are exactly the same in this sense.
---
Not a bad idea. If SBQ gets too strong because worthless players show up and don't help ...just kill them.
---
I have a Bloodied FF Combat rifle  the fire rate increase is very noticeable.
---
There's a rare chance to get weapon and armor plans, but most of the time it's just a random assortment of crap. A couple weapons, some ammo, and "fancy" junk like pocket watches.
---
Sounds like you found a Synth Mole Miner.
---
So far, At most, I've wasted 30 seconds on this post. You're wasting more of my time with this moronic argument than my original "hey, do your own homework" comments to OP. 
---
Teaching moments. It's about teaching moments. "The information you want is readily available, look for it first" is USEFUL FUCKING ADVICE.  What's your issue with me providing that, exactly?
---
"Be able to use to roll" what do you mean?
---
The auto laser/plasma pistols also work with those perks. Still a very low amount of weapons for 9 points. I hope Bethesda adds more weapons very soon.
---
Yes. I don‚Äôt trade with ANYBODY. If you ask for a trade I‚Äôll automatically assume you‚Äôre shady. Unless there‚Äôs some fair way to trade added it‚Äôll always be super sketchy &amp; I won‚Äôt participate so I don‚Äôt get scammed. I know it happens but we can‚Äôt make posts without proof especially with someone‚Äôs IGN
---
...or maybe a notification to whomever is on the premises that the CAMP will be removed in 5 min on a countdown timer and then of course code in that it goes bye bye in 5 min
---
Yep. Had 3 worlds crash on me in an hour and a half last night. All I could think of was ‚Äòoh here we go again.‚Äô
---
I‚Äôm not telling you my secret hotdog stashes! Mustard steal bastards!!
---
Don‚Äôt let Liberty Prime hear you.
---
Because tricking someone in a trade is not a bannable thing it‚Äôs the wastes surprises you can‚Äôt rob people in this game yet
---
Yeah, a couple patches ago they tweaked it so that you always use the lowest core first.
---
Lmao that's great
---
I didn‚Äôt say you needed to send me evidence. I said you should post proof if you‚Äôre gonna make a post like that but go off little kid. Btw still haven‚Äôt seen one
---
Itsajoke.
---
No i'm not mad, just informed the guy that he paid too much for a bad item. You are the one here that is coming out as mad not me.
---
True, value is subjective. But if you are smart enough you will see plenty of 2** TSE Handmades for sale and you can get one for 10K.
---
Really? Every other weapon would have been like you expected lol.
---
You have to swim back to the "startline" and the one checkpoint on the right is pretty bugged, go the same way back as u go there. Worked for me.
---
RE: Pointing emote. What I wouldn't give for a laser pointer or red dot scope. My buddy and I were debating whether we could climb a particular cliff face and used bullets to indicate what we were looking at. 
---
So like binoculars but with a red dot.
---
Again, in not a kid I'll show evidence for that aswell youngling
---
Off the top of my head, Slugger, Bloody Mess, and Overly Generous.
---
How do you know if they haven‚Äôt done anything? I reported a scammer with evidence and they said they would review but due to privacy of information they couldn‚Äôt tell me if they had banned him or not. I mean I doubt they did but I don‚Äôt know. also I‚Äôm pretty sure they transfer the stolen item to another account as soon as
---
Stealth is fantastic for all these new scout quests. I can get right on top of anything and get great photos without breaking sneak. I had a mirelurk queen walk right over me and never see me. However, if you want to stay hidden, make sure you can one shot things quietly. If you don't kill a super mutant on the first shot, they will all know you are there and will come after you. Even with a silencer. If you do manage to kill on the first shot, you will still likely go to caution. This is true on every super mutant encounter I've had and it also happens with high level ghouls too sometimes. I got caution while taking down a legendary sheepsquatch but I kept moving around it in circles and it never found me. A couple times it got lucky and was able to throw its quills at me but it still didn't really know where I was in order to do the charge attack. I cleared out west tek with my instigating gauss and only got minimally detected. For reference, I have full sneak perks, escape artist, 14 agi points, shielded raider underarmor, 4 pieces of chameleon armor + stand fast and one of them has an extra +agi, and finally bird bones and chameleon mutations.
---
I used this guy's video for my build inspiration, but I don't do bloodied as I'm too anxious to live like that. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZk\_TFozwI&amp;t=104s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZk_TFozwI&amp;t=104s)
---
Depends what you play on.  I've seen Junk/Explosive/Junk 3\*s go for up to 10k on PC.
---
I'd like a reduced load time mod for the crossbow. I have a crossbow with 25% faster reload and it's pretty decent already but another 25% would be great.
---
Xbox looking for groups and reddit
---
I just took your shit
---
I am currently using a bloodied one for the same thing and it absolutely slays. And even if VATS says 45% it still hits. I'm one shotting Scorched Conquerers left and right.
---
Early on Night Eyes was a valuable perk.  Not anymore!
---
bathrobe + yellow sticker hat .. I mean if you wanna get the females and help rebuild .. works best with marsupial ... you'll know when you try it
---
what i been rockin and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND is a surgical mask, heavy leather right arm, light combat left arm(bloody paint) and sturdy raider legs no chest piece cause ima badass .. best outfit ever also go bald for that angelic appeal
---
Honestly nah. I love scoping bargains someone's 150 white fedora is someone else's 20 cap one. Still killing me in travel costs but great for a low lever player find all posts he new areas and hunting bargins
---
Go ahead &amp; provide proof for both. If you‚Äôre an adult you failed out of English so good luck in lifeüëåüèº (I‚Äôm*)
---
Not really an issue, I just thought you looked silly telling them to Google it and even googled it yourself as im assuming you knew the answer before googling. Would have been much better to just give a simple answer instead of acting how you did. ü§î But I digress.
---
You should consider holding out for better prices once display cases are released and collectors have a real reason to go after specific ‚Äújunk‚Äù items!
---
I always sell cheap I move alot more product that way.
---
I live on a mountain with zero extractors or water purifiers or crops so unlikely
---
I'm not going to kill them. I may stand back and crouch with chameleon, but I wanna see if people kill each other or fight SBQ. I think most people will work together to kill SBQ. After SBQ is dead, that is when I think the kills will happen.
---
Funny, bears are the one thing in the world I pick up regardless of whether I need the cloth. 
---
In FO4 I was going for a complete collection of letter blocks.
---
Uranium Fever. He might even get some useful drops from it.
---
Lol tell that to China bro
---
It is not a witch hunt in this case.
---
Damn I need someone to revive in the water too. And can die on demand
---
You sound like fun
---
I bought two pieces of level 50 armor I wanted from a level 6 guy so it's really a crapshoot what you'll find.
---
I think they might be 50s style gardening gloves which had leather covering the fingers.
---
Without proof it is lmao literally read the rules of this sub
---
There are exceptions, but what you've described is unusual
---
Omw!
---
It's a quest reward. If you wait until level 50 to do the quests that give weapons or armor, you receive level 50 versions of them.
---
I mean, it was on the exams terminal, it was the swimming test. Sorry if I wrote it badly.
---
Not really, as it's unbalanced. It adds get more damage that can be stacked onto melee via mutations. If you run unarmed you already get two 25% buffs, bleed damage, and a chance to cripple your target from mutations.
---
Totally forgot about that one üëçüèºüëçüèº
---
I'm just saying this is simple supply vs demand. The guy had the supply. OPs demand necessitated that he spend 5000 caps on it. If OP was willing to spend that much on it,  that's how much it was worth.  Even if there is a cheaper option somewhere worse. 
---
For example, if I go to Walmart and find dog food for $20 but it's $15 across town at the pet store,  I'm still buying it at Walmart just for convenience.  That extra $5 doesn't mean shit.
---
Because I told you the truth? Your life must be fun haha
---
It can be silenced, or a muzzle break.
---
I'm not the best at spelling and I type quickly that's why. And I'll show you
---
The thing here is bethesda wants to get people to sink caps out of players inventory to both achieve a stable value of items and the depreciation of caps. With the duping players would be tens of if not 100k caps and that inflates the value

If it was useful on any gun it would be this one

I can help you out with that. Add me, same psn as my username

Personally I'm gunning 2* ranged. I'll be rolling that until i get my hands on a B25 50 cal and/or gat gun. *Then* i'll go for mama's pick

Minecraft taught me to always shut doors behind yourself.

I think they are trying to make those alternate prefixes more viable in some situation.

After I failed Encryptid, I started regretting every bit of Troubleshooter's gear I got rid of.

I have my vendor that is exclusive and hidden away on a mountain. There maybe some insane deals if you ever find it. Remember my name and be on the lookout! (PS4 platform)
---
Question, if I, a sweet little lvl 25, we‚Äôre to purchase an item through this, would I be limited to like 1 star or 2 star or something like that? 
---
Does the number of stars correlate to item level? Or can you have a 3 star item of any level?
---
‚åõÔ∏è‚è≥
---
Don't the games with them though have like store terminals for searching (you don't actually have to go and find each individual stall to buy)? Like I played FFXIV and it let you search for any of x item being sold on the server and listed them by price. When something is actually doing a service 10% tax seems reasonable. Like if we could search all other shops from our terminal and buy things, then it'd make sense.
---
Is that like regular mining, but for pixels and karma? Do you get paid in scrip? Do you have to sell your soul to the company?
---
Please go back to 2016
---
I did know the answer. What I did was tell him how to _get that answer himself_.  Then I used the terms he provided, and _checked that it would fucking work_. 
---
I fundamentally disagree with you. Posts like this shouldn't be answered with "hey, here is the answer", they should be answered with "here's how you get the information you want without clogging  the board with 300'th post of it's type".

I left a present for you on your bed
---
You can get all raider plans and the sturdy/heavy metal plans from farming the messenger. Super rare drop rate, but my friend has gotten 3 plans from it. 2 heavy raider and one sturdy metal.
---
I have a sleeping bag..
---
You trade with him then.  Trade with Wig Guy and Broken Arrow while you are at it.   Set to zero first like a big boy!
---
Thousands of players are trading every day without problem. How do you think you're going to get scammed?
---
Tick tok tick tok
---
Was decoded and reported day of, on a few posts
---
*I can't wait to find out.*
---
The only way this happens if they lock perks. No more switching up. 
---
Otherwise... every player is a jack of all trades.
---
Yes, yes you did. There I go not reading everything. Hope they fix it.
---
It's the same story with the Assaultron head. You still have to load all 20 cells one at a time by charging it to get the benefit. 
---
I threw out that Assaultron head a while ago though because this was before they fixed it to where no matter how many cells were charged into it it would only do the damage of a single cell.
---
No, irl
---
You on Xbox? I‚Äôve seen 20 posts in 3 days about scammers (different IGN‚Äôs too) just isn‚Äôt for me. I‚Äôd trade with my friends or something obviously but people I just met? On reddit maybe. Got a good community here but on Xbox LFG you‚Äôd have to rob me first lmao
---
That'd be me... but nobody requires a medic. I even try to sweeten the deal by sharing my 15% XP boost... no takers. I've got shared heals, faster heals, better heals... nope. Nobody needs me.
---
yea, i'm trying to figure that out.  I assume auto-stim doesnt stack.  but 5 life savings (if stacked) would essentially auto-revive you every time you died.
---
Ahhh, as I‚Äôm laying in bed you must be ant man
---
I was trying to go with something that has full covering, and maybe looks semi-nice - like not cobbled together, but preferably not like enclave or responders
---
You can do the math if you can find images of a couple to see how the damage stacks up. Explosive shreds but so does higher fire rate in dps.
---
Can't you just leave it alphabetical? If I understand you properly.
---
Even with the damage of 20 cells it still sucks. I had a friend take off every piece of armor and they didn't have grounded and it barely got them to half health.
---
you animal ima let the neighborhood watch know of your shenaiganz!! i bite my thumb at thee!!
---
It seems to be a new bug. I was attacked by a group of scorched that identified as super mutants.
---
Hopefully they decide to add it into the game soon.
---
Yes, it is. Well, kinda. It's actually a really dumb pun.
---
Again.. do you have proof or is there a post about them? If not it is a witch hunt lmfao no reason to get upset
---
It's been 7 hours. Where are my hormones?
---
No that will sort the junk items but not by the craftimg mats
---
Lol, yeah keep going back and forth between the farthest points on the map to make vendors go broke.
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME HIS SPECIES!!!!!!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
the bayonet is a mod you can find(or maybe buy) in the world i have one on a vampire dragon. i found the mod in the world back in january but it didnt say what weapon it was for so i had to randomly check what it was for, my surprise when it was for my dragon
---
Lol found 5 on the BBQ at Morgantown airport as someone suggested. Backpacker done.
---
But if everything is at your camp, it would make it less stressful, less tedious and practical. Why would Beth want that? After the terrible backlash against the game the entire time, why make it easier and fun to play? I just dont get why anyone would want to do such an abismal thing!!!  How dare you for questioning the almighty and powerful Todd and his omnipotent decisions? Shame on you!
---

Not all receivers were added, mostly those were added that give max damage/effect. 50 was not good enough before P9. I don't know what the P9 numbers are for those receivers.

I'm a monster. I need to be stopped.

Thanks a lot for the help and calming my confusion!

I have the photo of a dude selling one at 13k cus its been  duped, how do I send inmages then?

Yeah the maintenance didn‚Äôt fix it. I have no clue what the ‚Äúissues‚Äù they were supposed to be fixing today were :(.
---
this is why i only trade on a specific sub with its own karma system and (proof required ) blacklist....

FFR's are a hot thing right now especially for PVP and seems like it's a pretty high demand attribute to have on a weapon. You got a pretty sweet gat there! Role's are perfect imo.

I too got a 35 bloodied explosive pump from uranium fever. I too am very upset about watching it get nerfed so many times. It used to one shot mirelurk queens and now I'm lucky to kill a scorched in 1 hit

Yea that is all nice and good but doesn't change the fact that he paid way too much for that item. He could have gotten way better item with 5000.
---
BE Is better, especially if supported with Demo Expert, but it‚Äôs not a huge difference; be very happy with what you got either way!
---
Word.
---
and then people complain about servers crashing too often
---
And what were the details of these scams? Or just people saying "I got scammed!!1!1"?
---
There is nothing dangerous with trading, unless someone is constantly requesting stuff and you put a price on an item you don't want to trade. But if you are careful, that shouldn't happen.
---
The Institute has already perfected synth moleminers it seems - more Bethesda retcon.
---
As of patch 9 this is correct. Great change, like much of the patch!
---
Thanks for the info. I just found a bunch of them in the Glass Cavern. Good thing the photo challenges work with bodies!

From BETA through about the first month it WAS dark. They patched it to quite a bit lighter in I want to say patch 2. You used to actually need your light on at night
---
What outfit is that??
---
Every once in a while I go over to the Anthem sub to see if things got any better... cause Fo76 was in a very similar spot for the first 2 months. But it's just super hostile and depressing over there. Now THAT is a game on the verge of death
---
Because I asked if there‚Äôs some sort of proof? Sorry I don‚Äôt instantly believe people I‚Äôve never met on the internet bud
---
I love the Black Powder mod ideas. Fantastic. That said, I use those rifles as my primary weapon and disagree they are not usable. I can one shot just about everything and they have suck incredible range that if I can‚Äôt one shot, with a tiny bit of backtracking I can finish anything off without a faster reload. 
---
With those weapons, it‚Äôs all about the legendary prefixes, perk cards and chems. They are deadly in the hands of a guy with a proper sniper build.
---
Play and decide for yourself. You already bought the game so what have you got to lose?
---
Even that would suffice!
---
If you own it.. play it. It's best to form your own opinion on it . Personally I play it every day and love it
---
I wish one or more of the overtly organized people on this subreddit would make a base line price guide for vending. That way people would kind of have an idea on value. IE 1* legendary combat armor, base price 500 caps. That 1* being hunter‚Äôs or nocturnal no raise in value. That 1* being unyielding or Assassin‚Äôs another 500 caps. 2* being a weight reduction * another 1,000 caps etc.. etc.
---
well i just picked the commonly expected answers on the exams .. but if i didn't have a clue i'd prolly unmute my mic and be like .. hey .. psst player on other terminal what's the answer to ... seeing as there really isn't any there to stop from cheatin ..
---
on the additional shit i ran to where other players were like uranium fever and hot spot phat lewtz vendorz and was aye .. i knowz ur shopping and u smell great .. wanna help with this dope achievement .. it'll help save the planet and like 3 out of 10 ppl complied it was epic
---
Well, did you look for the fork in the river?
---
Well even if they do you'll still have people selling below average and above average.
---
My camp has a locked generator area and I found a super mutant stuck in the floor his legs freaking out hitting my fusion generator with his bare hands. so somehow he reverse shawshank redemptioned himself through the ground just so he could kill my power.
---
I literally met a higher Level guy doing this last night on PC while journeying around taking photos of good bases and their owners. 
---
He said he did it to help y‚Äôall out so you didn‚Äôt have to spend more caps then you needed to with that 10% tithe. Prices were actually ok - which is worth noting. 
---
He had a nice lil shopping hangout setup immediately at the base of the stairs - forcing new players to stop in. 
---
Vault boys statues behind the shops. Shops on first floor Astroturf (if this is you - hi again!).
---
Brilliant - thank you so much for the info and the vid :)
---
Just today I bought someone's Action hero for 1500 caps.... üòÇ What was he thinking.
---
Since its bloodied are you using a low hp build? I still do 400 damage with mine with 0 shotgun perks
---
I wonder if that vendor scales with charisma? do the machines? I have 4 charisma and hard bargain 3 and i sell 1 star for 3 scrips. even tho i believe that i used to be able to sell them for 5 before unequipping and reequipping hard bargain.
---
yeah they even ruined power armor lights, took forever to get the ultra brights for 2 of my armors only for them to be the default for everyone now
---
I got my best deals from a lvl 2 player who was obviously just a mule. It‚Äôs not a waste of time at all. And honestly, all the purified water you get from peoples camps more than covers fast travel costs associated with a day of server hopping and fast traveling from shop to shop
---
Idk PM it to me. &amp; how do you know it was duped? Because he isn‚Äôt selling it for max caps like the rest of the people that ruin the economy?
---
well that sucks
---
25% faster fire rate makes it on par with explosive which is only less than 25% damage increase post nerf. The only benefit of explosive is if your bullet missed the target but hit the ground nearby, the splash damage still counts, while for a non-explosive weapon aiming is more critical.
---
Did in a post of my own on here. In a game of rng vs progression player growth this is just another way for slowing down player progression and development through rng at a high cost. At most you can get 1 legend roll first day and 2 second day. So every 2 days you can gave up to 3 rolls.
---
Someone else on the sub did the math and that means you have a 0.01% chance of getting the weapon you want with 2 or 3 (i forget which) desired *perks. Based on that it was determined if you played every day for 50 days you would get 1 legendary you wanted.
---
Now of course people will get what they want and for all we know there id a pitty timer or a list of pemade combos so we don't keep getting instigator gamma guns.
---
That is just a couple logic based reasons i hate it

Yeah, i know- i was trying to get the picture (as well as visit credit for metalworker) and couldn‚Äôt get it to come up anywhere. I went from one end of the bridge to the other. Didn‚Äôt get visit credit either. 
---
It may be very specific of where it works from though- the picture for Top of the World doesn‚Äôt work most places actually close to it; i finally got it looking from the train station. I‚Äôm going to try to get the bridge from around Flatwoods, see if that counts.

Doesn‚Äôt work for me either

I hope so. In adventure mode, I've seen people crafting while we all waste ammo.
---
I mean I bought a Level 40 Bloodied Hunting Rifle (unmodded) for about 700 caps just yesterday off some vending machine. I'd just been thinking about how I've yet to find any kind of legendary hunting rifle, and wouldn't you know it the next camp vendor I visited had one. 
---
I also spent about 7k on a Hunter's Explosive 10MM because I like to pretend I'm a Space Marine.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you say that the first timeüòÇ I wouldn‚Äôt have even questioned you if you said he had 6 lmao you said he has one for 13k.. also type slower man Jesus you‚Äôre frenzying your words
---
That's a bit harsh, as long as it's just buying/selling for caps, it works as advertised (minus some UI problems). The problem is people asking for trades (item for item, not an in-game mechanic), with everyone pricing their item at 0 caps. If you do that with  a random player, you are just asking for trouble, but I do it all the time with people I can trust.
---
If the offered trade is too tempting, then it's probably not sincere, but what you can do is have both players set a price like 10000 caps instead of zero as some form of insurance. Of course, for this to work reasonably one of the traders has to have no more than 15000 caps, and the other one has to have at least 10000.
---
better yet you should form a group of like minded individuals .. like a gang that uses gang signs .. maybe called **"The Takerers!"** or the **"Got you shitererers!"** .. iunno maybe even raiders or something we should meet like once a week on fridays near bus stops and plan the weeks activities it'll be great .. ill bring females you bring the dip
---
Yup. Snare and bass seem broken overall, as they didn‚Äôt work at Sons of Dane either.
---
Nice heads up! Upvoting for being a decent wastelander.
---
Did u keep these on u? And r u on PC?
---
If so I might buy it for a couple caps.
---
I‚Äôm a bit lazy ya see.
---
its literally the best gun for that legendary affix. you spend more time reloading that gun then playing the game. honestly its pretty badass just for a weapon to tank with.
---
I like it, but it's a huge missed opportunity.  It's pretty much just a less random legendary drop. 
---
It would be really cool if she was able to also offer a kind of "enchanting" service. Right now there's not much reason to craft your own weapons. Who wants a gun with no legendary effect? Imagine if you could craft the weapon you wanted, then take it to her to "enchant", basically giving you random effects on a weapon of your choice. It would really help out people trying to roleplay, and also could be used as the only place to get certain legendary items, like legendary shepherds crooks, drills, ect. 
---
I actually thought this would be the plan when they came out with things like the Fixer and sheepsquatch assultron head, legendary items without a legendary  prefix.
---
Yep I only started finding them /after/ I got the camera from the corpse
---
same, on PS4
---
I have played since beta. Traded EXTENSIVELY. Never been scammed, frauded, anything. It's all on you.
---
It's part of me, I talk fast as well üòÇ, and someone was tying to buy one for 6k today I was dead when I seen itüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes, that subReddit is fantastic.   If I stick with people there with more than six weeks tenure and over 20 subReddit-specific karma, I feel safe.   Especially if I read their trade history.
---
Did you get bass, snare, and play at rusty pick? I couldn‚Äôt get credit for those
---
Noted. So what you are saying is we need scrolling marquees for our camps lol
---
I like this idea in theory, but I‚Äôm a little afraid that something so basic could send the wrong message. For example, if I run into a shop item that I love, but I hate the cost... do I dislike that and send the message that I don‚Äôt like the item? Or do I like it and send the message that the item and price are good? Short of adding a complicated review system, I don‚Äôt see this being a good long term solution to the issue you are presenting. 
---
That said, I love the fact that you are presenting solutions to a problem and don‚Äôt want to discourage you. So you have my upvote. I don‚Äôt have any solutions for the issue, so you are already a step above me friend. Cheers
---
Discord supplies this.

That‚Äôs the same thing as this post..? ‚ÄúAHH I GOT SCAMMED DONT TRADE WITH THIS PERSON‚Äù like wtf are you on rn dude

They just gave them a huge boost and now ppl are killing themselves for any type of energy weapons

Harsh but true imo

Still around?

Of course it is the same as this post - who is saying otherwise?

So you pretty much confirm my suspicions, thank you.

You sure you got 5/5? I was getting confused at first because of the way the wording came up, it was really telling me question 5 of 5 was up next, THEN i got results.

I loved the DARK dark nights. Made light sources useful. Not anymore... Beth plz

If you get a legendary drill, sell it to me! lol

I honestly think Bioware/EA will go through the motions for another couple months, release one "substantial" update, and then move it to sustained life. I don't think they'll completely pull the plug for a while, but they'll stop working on it and updating it. If they have anything substantial to show for Dragon Age at E3, I'd expect that not long after

Given the amount of time we are talking....gwyneth paltrow's bleached skull and a jade egg.

so many many bugs .. plasma is super dope doe .. esp as a flamethrower my buddy made me one for those oh shit moments and it's amazing

overall though changing builds is the only issue at this time .. with player vending and server hopping you can farm what you need and sell what you don't etc and play a lil styleout(tm) in ur downtime .. right now im rockin a bathrobe(slightly ajar) and a yellow sticker hat so if that sexy image doesn't pull you back I don't know what will

Or crossbow

Vanguard gives up to +35 DR per piece, the higher your hp.

Bolstering gives up to +35 DR per piece, the lower your health
---
Could have been an LMG. It‚Äôs got crazy fire rate and good accuracy for the first second or so before recoil starts to bounce it all over. Solid damage now too; as a heavy weapon user, it‚Äôd be my PVP weapon of choice.
---
No I obviously buy stuff with caps but I mean trade as in no caps gun for gun armor for weapon whatever it may be. That‚Äôs shady imo. It‚Äôs my own opinion I‚Äôm not saying anyone‚Äôs stupid for doing it, it just isn‚Äôt for me so I won‚Äôt do it. If someone says they want trade I say have a good day no thanks that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not gonna even put myself in a situation where there‚Äôs a chance to get scammed. I love my weapons currently of course I want better ones. I‚Äôd love a BE plasma or laser but people charge 30k (I have one character &amp; will only ever have one I‚Äôm not maxing two characters to buy one damn gun) or they ask for trade (they want like 3 god roll weapons for their ONE)
---
Apparently door states are persistent while things like leaving my jukebox off are reversed at the games whims.
---
Go to the other terminal down the stairs in the vault along the wall. Maybe it wants you to do that step without  giving a marker. I've bee  able to complete this the past two days on xbox. Might be bugged for you though.
---
You mean when you look at one item at a time? Or is this a view option I can switch to in UI?
---
In Whitespring. Behind the vendor that sells recipes is a stove. Crouch down and inside there's a teddy bear with a hotdog and a nuka cola cup.
---
I dont think scrip is tradeable. so you would actually need all 5 characters to ALSO be max level, and be doing the trading themselves.  only transferring the end prizes
---
Purchasable containers (with caps) to separate and organize my items would be even better. 
---
People were saying we need a cap dump, why not make it for more and separate storage?
---
Dude I‚Äôm serious lay off the drugs you‚Äôre having an entire conversation by yourself you lost us all a long time ago. Quit while you‚Äôre behind a lot

100% need decent dark nights again.

Smells like a loot box...

I wouldn‚Äôt mind more stash room too.

Maybe u could get an extra 100-200 Stash just for the vending?
---
I‚Äôm not over encumbered at all and don‚Äôt even need too wear my excavator much anymore but it would be nice too be able too horde all my legendaries so I could sell them at the vendor or exchange em later when the exchange refills with scrip every 24 hours.
---
True
---
Yeah ill get back on now
---
I just got off lol but ill be back on
---
Not a very helpful tab since on \[PC\] it currently shows 0 for everything but caps when it shouldn't.
---
Yeah, I did go down and I tried to turn the power back on but the terminal just told me the files were corrupted or deleted. I couldn't do anything with the terminal other than read that.
---
If you have scrapper it may not be accurate, it shows it w/o scrapper
---
It‚Äôs also by accident. I‚Äôve sent like 15 friend requests just trying to travel to someone‚Äôs shop indicator. Feels obnoxious but fallout gonna fallout
---
I unironically would if I could
---
Oh yeah I would not be the least bit surprised if that game lost all traction and didn't get much new content in the long run. They totally alienated their fan base with the god awful public relations. I'm glad I avoided that game for sure haha
---
To be precise, each attempt costs 60 scrip plus an extra 40 if you decide to keep it. The muermur's surprise option looks intriguing - 25 scrip per attempt plus 40 to keep. That's a pretty good deal.
---
Working for me - as u/banshee3 stated you might need to ensure that the reactor is online under the uni
---
I was able to complete the quest this morning
---
Lol put on fireproof 3 under endurance. I can not die to my own weapons now. Shot a mirv at my feet and I take 0 damage I just get crippled. If your going to do a low hp build definitely get nerd rage 1 and serendipity 3
---
Fucking click bait assholes who just gotta keep crapping on F76 for the traffic.
---
Ignore them.
---
Yeah. Look at Path of Exile. Some people didn't like rolling for six-link items, so they added a more-expensive-than-average cost to get six links. In the long run most people are better off gambling, but the higher-guaranteed-option works for people who prefer work to gambling, and of course, this didn't blow up PoE or given everyone god-tier items.   
---
The problem is, the RNG in FO76 is so bad, that a higher than RNG chance of the right item, level, 1st star, 2nd star, and 3rd star is an astronomical number.
---
I would... but I only play PC for 76.
---
I could play PS4 fallout 4 tho! üòÖ
---
Yeah after I just replied that I realized that step happens to power up the analyzer in the first place. What if you insert the specimen then leave the building and come back to the terminal? Does the term even have the password entry option before you put in the DNA?
---
If you don't have any arguments, just say so, no one will blame you for it. But don't embarrass yourself this way, man.
---
I like to turn off all the lights in the camp
---
How's the new update, wild Appalachia I think it's called
---
It wouldn't let me turn the reactor back on idk I'll try again tomorrow!
---
I logged out and back in.  It did not fix the issue.
---
personally i do wish it was more definable (re-roll specific perks on existing items, select specific item, etc)   Beth could easily still make it likely cost 5000 scrip to get the exact item you want, which is a huge investment.   but I can all but guarantee that 50 3 star weapon purchases will NOT give you the exact thing you want.  And i would further bet that a lot of people will just stop bothering to use this content after they spend several hundred/thousand scrip and never receive anything but garbage
---
and then we can all bitch and moan when Beth adds something to the atomic shop that increases our "good item" chances
---
Why are you assuming Project Paradise involves Arktos? Dungeon‚Äôs will be a while off considering they can‚Äôt even put a display shelf in the game currently lmao

Is that the Demon Core? Some guy slips with a screwdriver around a containment unit and kills himself and the security guard behind him.

So many 3\*'s are worse than the right 1\*, that it will give garbage 99.9% of the time, but it's still better than nothing.
---
Yeahhh, okay little buddy. Back to talking to yourself. Have a good day tell your caretaker I said hi ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
How is buying a 500-1000 caps weapon for 5000 caps a nice find with bad legendary effects like that?
---
Yeah I have the same issue
---
Any idea where to get the water revive done?
---
... you realize ‚Äúmongrel‚Äù *basically* means wild dog, right? They‚Äôre dogs. Wolves, are a bit distinct. 
---
I wonder if mutant hounds count, though. I mean, the mongrels in game are mildly mutated dogs; mutant hounds are just moderately mutated dogs.
---
All the TSE users would kill all the melee users when they rush the queen. Friendly fire would be disaster. I can't imagine the mayhem with my TSE gatling plasma with beam splitter. I'd hit everybody.
---
It's your game do whatever you want, why ask others? Play for a while, stick around if you like it. Or not, if you don't.
---
Veterans of this sub would probably suggest you search this before contributing to the 2 dozen iterations of it we get everyday.
---
Personally if I see something spawn when at someones camp I kill it. Just seems like common curtesey.
---
That said if its a scorch beast or the like I'm out.
---
Oh, I know. I was assuming the person would farm on one character and paper bag the legendaries to his others. 
---
And is it confirmed that legendary level will be based on character level?
---
You really need someone else's opinion to load up a game that you already own?
---
I don't wanna say that's pathetic, but really man...
---
There's been plenty of changes since launch. You can easily look through all the patch notes from Bethesda and find out what exactly is new.
---
How do we KNOW it will take place there? I don‚Äôt get where that assumptions is coming from. Was there a post I missed? I remember this large datamine post a while back saying Arktos was going to be a large, actually challenging dungeon. So either BSG scrapped it or you guys are making horrible assumptions
---
Can you please post some sort of proof? I know in a few days we'll know if the 1000 scrip cap is right but despite the high number of these "1000 scrip limit" post I've yet to see proof.
---
I had a set of stairs I couldn't get rid of... Had to work it into my camp design.  Happening a lot today.
---
Maybe where the swimming test was
---
Yeah, I moved something over then it wouldn't let me place it back. Really annoyed
---
If you can't turn the game on, play for a bit and decide for yourself whether you like it or not, you should probably go play another game.
---
Most people here play the game. They'll tell you to play. Then you'll play it and the first or second time you blue screen (which does happen from time to time), you'll rage quit and tell us all about it in another post. 
---
For me, it's worth playing. For you, probably not.
---
I opened dms lets talk there
---
They never said Dungeons will not come, just not in 9.5.
---
It‚Äôs glitched like most of the challenges lol. No word from BSG about it &amp; the patch today did nothing for it still
---
Preach it brother!
---
I got a 45 blood fast swing speed pickaxe from someone yesterday.... for 60 caps
---
Yeah. I'm not sure. There are more ranged categories, but fewer totally worthless ranged weapons. There are a whole lot of garbage melee base-types.
---
It would probably scale with your level, or at least that'd be fair for lower level players. A 3* Bloodied Explosive Faster Fire Rate Handmade! Yeah! Oh wait, Level 45, damn it.
---
You lift 16 tons...
---
I always assume laziness will be a factor.  and "rolling from full item list" is the laziest thing they can do.  so I expect 50/50 weapon/armor to be accurate
---
Yeah me two - TWICE!
---
Didnt realise it gave the other ones as well
---
Keep digging, man.
---
Pathetic.
---
I imagine itll be based on your level. Like with crafting. If you are level 45. It gives you a level 45 weapon. Once you hit 50 it starts giving you level 50 items. We will see though.
---
It might be a case that you need to start it all the way from the beginning, sorry.
---
I mean go to Fort Defiance, interact with the terminal there (I seem to remember it was the one in the room furthest from the elevator to the right, the one with the PA stations) to get the the relevant password etc

I get this with Ecological Balance where I can go four or five days without having to retrieve Amy's Note from her corpse in the Creamery and then for no apparent reason I 'lose' it and I have to go fetch the wretched thing again.

500 a piece is actually a lot for them lol. I sell my serums for like 200 &amp; most people on Xbox I see do also. But I‚Äôm happy for you marsupial was my first &amp; my favorite!
---
the 10-20 new shops I mentioned are the other players selling stuff. When you build a vending machine and provide power to it your camp appears on the map and becomes a fast travel point. When you hover over someone's camp icon it'll show a category list (weapons, armor, stims, junk, misc, etc) and how many items in each category that they have for sale.
---
You can sell pretty much everything other than undroppable keys and quest items, which means you'll find people selling magazines, ammo, mr fuzzy tokens, disease cures, nuke keycards, and all the other stuff that the robot vendors won't buy. Last night I bought 100 boiled water for 2 caps each because it was less time and labor intensive than collecting wood and dirty water.
---
I use conduits. They look good and they simple.
---
Sure thing! Happy to help!
---
Can you get on now
---
I cant use it for some reason. everytime i click a on it like it says nothing happens. i have alchohol on me, what do i do?

I saw a tick in the mire labeled super mutant. That was a strange day indeed.

Did I go too far over? Thanks, Great feedback!

You're welcome! Glad I could help!

It makes me want to build you a camp in the style of Cracker Barrel. Lots of rocking chairs

Not a bug. 10% tax on items sold for ammo is per bullet.

---
it's bugfails-duh(bethesda in engrish) so there is always gonna be bugs and exploits but I gotta say the freedom is nice the people can be weird .. man some of the people I've met ... wow .. yeah so back on topic but the game itself is not as repetitive now .. yeah you'll prolly out of x resource but you have now multiple ways to quickly or humbly get em back WITH a variety in environments so farming doesn't feel as exhausting .. plus you can say some weird shit to ppl and 9/10 times you get weirder shit back which is amazing

I got killed in the glassed caverns once and could only respawn at Cliffwatch too, also on Xbox. No idea why it happened, unless it‚Äôs related to the dying while overencumbered bug? I was way over carry weight when it happened to me.
---
Added a card to my cards agaisnt humanity set which was Gwenyth Paltrows severed head. Very funny. Would reccomend.
---
You got scammed, they shouldn't be more than 200
---
I've put a lot of time intoine and had it pretty nice, figured I'd touch it up now it's all messed up and I can't fix it
---
Survival is dry af. They made survival as weak as adventure
---
Sure, I'd love that, but I'd rather have more content and such.  I'm not quite sure on how big a developer group they have, so I wouldn't want to have anything else that would be more important put off for a mini game.
---
That's my plan once I'm more well geared and actually know how to play the game. Been wanting to have a camp where people can just come and get materials and healing needed.
---
Old bug its stupid
---
Vete a matarte ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
My camp I keep wanting to start over, but the way it was built over time slowly it has some character to it.  Though I did find a guys house that was built over water falls under the bridge south of morgantown that was really nice.  
---
But back to mine, it is all moststly built around my original camp, which was 4 walls and a roof with a bed in it.  more or less in the middle of the pond near the log cabin.  I did find a few more nice spots over the months, but could never get to killing off the old homestead.  maybe tonight...
---
A lot of them are bugged and not checking off -_-
---
I hear they "fixed" the punch bowl so it wouldn't work anymore.
---
Oof well that definitely sucks to hear but now I don't have to waste my time trying to get it to work. Thank you! ‚ô°
---
This. Deathclaw+ribeye+whiskey+rad-ant lager *maybe*. Not sure if the last two stack; the first two definetly.
---
Same here. Plus cant find deathclaw hide
---
That was longer than a yes or a no, but sure. üëç
---
:-))
---
But I've also heard other people comment saying that people will work together. No one really knows the answer. Maybe after I do SBQ, I should see if the same applies to Encryptid.
---
The security of "waking up" at home is worth more than the caps to me, but I can totally understand your logic.
---
Like the Grand Exchange from Runescape
---
UC ammo is usually has a base amount double that of normal ammo. Notable exceptions are 308 which is nearly quadruple, and 5mm/50 which is the same.
---
Np! Yeah it sucks I think they‚Äôll fix eventually though
---
Same???
---
Yep. Bugged for me too, bah!
---
Alegr√≠a Macarena
---
Ignore anyone who says you got ripped off, 500 is perfectly reasonable for a serum, all things considered. Congrats on the find!
---
Well one makes you use ammo quicker so idk if that's ok with you then probabaly do faster fire rate
---
i sure as hell hope so, otherwise it will immediately be dead content.
---
can you imagine how bad the chances would be to actually get something good if item level was also rolled for?  
---
also, that would alienate literally every player lol
---
I have it on PC and PS4 I personally prefer PS4, it‚Äôs what I use the most.
---
Lol. I read the title 'fellow senior citizens of vault 76.. ' Guess it's my eyes going first in my old age
---
Picture of squirrel and opossum also bugged &gt;.&lt;
---
I think the fuck not
---
Shame, I just happened to inherit this fantastic vintage steel bridge, 19th Century engineering and ingenuity at its peak, from my paternal grand uncle who was an Antarctic explorer in his youth and I was going to offer it to you as a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
---
It is rare to find bridges like these in the open market, perhaps you would reconsider? Opportunities like this one do not knock on your door twice!
---
It's good fun. But seriously you can pick the game up for like a tenner
---
Only 13k hot damn
---
I am glad i can see everyone's camps. 
---
I had 8k caps down to 56 caps.
---
Bought stuff i like and will use/wear and plans/recipes i wanted.
---
I set a waypoint to each camp. 
---
If the person logged out, oh well.
---
Pick another.
---
I agree I am level 175 with a tse pump action (Slow ROF) and was needing to hit level 5 super mutants 3-8x depending on the range. (All within 10ft max) and anyone saying they got sniped by a shotgun at any distance greater than maybe 25ft even with the skeet shooter card is full of shit unless they are running bloodied with shit armor this is not a kill shot.(One exception would be if the guy stacked bobbleheads but good luck no mater what the guy was shooting.)
---
Sounds good! I often have my xbl profile in offline mode, so if you're on and don't see me just shoot me a msg and I'll join your game if I can. I'm usually on most evenings pacific time, and often for a couple hours on weekend mornings if my wife doesn't make me do chores :)
---
There are multiple instances of this happening - the one I was speaking about happened when too much of a certain material was put into a container and when the scientist got on a ladder to look into the chamber right as the reaction happened and it screwed him
---
What s ur username
---
So a 10% tax on 1 cap is 1 cap?
---
Would love to join you both. I've been playing all on my own since the Beta. :/
---
use the metal lettering, stick them on your machine to label the contents
---
I'm completely with you there, I would never go beyond 25k either, and I do only trade with people I have history with. The problem is that god-roll weapons and armor tend to be trade only these days, so trades like that take a few in-betweens and back and forth.
---
At least for me, that is. ;-)
---
Sure what‚Äôs your IGN I‚Äôll give you my base &amp; my whole stash for itü§ë
---
Proof or it‚Äôs a witch him
---
It's on Reddit, it's on the forums, people have found it in the game files through data mining and it's a pretty big topic of conversation today throughout the community.
---
When will you be on?
---
They say Psn, so Playstation
---
I could do anytime before you go to work but afterwards would be too late for me
---
BTW they changed the damage not the range or am I missing something here?
---
There is a crossbow at middle mountain cabins consistently and I think one at pickets fort consistently ..
---
Haha no, I was wondering if the item level was based on the level of the character buying it or if they're all max level.
---
That would be a horrible scenario though... lvl 5 BEs for all!
---
Haven't played other fallouts on PS4, took me a lil while to get the controls only because I am used to playing on PC. I enjoy it though. But if you are getting it on PS4 remember you need a PS+ account.
---
:D ..  yea i bet there is a senior gang playing fallout :D like 80+  LUL
---
Hey, I've seen you around!
---
Thanks! You are the man
---
Self driven motivation to become a great scout
---
Awww! but it made sense
---
i edited the first line to directly say searching for ps4
---
Yeah I just won‚Äôt even bother if they ask beyond 25k or a trade. That‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôll take my very slim chances trying to get myself a god roll. 20k is probably the most I‚Äôll pay since I‚Äôm mostly maxed out
---
Ooooh another one! :D 1000x this week! :D I honestly think that all these "is the game good now?" posts are just bad trolling attemps.
---
Omw
---
Ive got one in my shop (might be a lvl 45), mention this add and Ill drop the price 50%! 
---
GT ThePainBelow (xbox1)
---
Edit: should be on tonight between 9-10 EST
---
auction house mods
---
I would vehemently disagree, but I don't really know melee all that well, and all I know is from videos I've seen of people pwning everything using a drill, death tambo, rolling pin, etc.
---
For every rolling pin, there is a pipe pistol or cryolator, but honestly I don't have the info to do a 1:1 comparison.
---
I know but I haven't seen a link to any proof. I guess I'm still holding out hope this info is incorrect. The limit is way too low it takes about 17-18 days to max out caps just from vendors I was hoping they'd keep the same formula.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahaha.....
---
Mama Murphy was a degenerate crack whore, all hail mama murmghle
---
A crossbow plan should spawn at the Pioneer Scout Camp by the archery range. in addition to this, there's also a couple static spawns for crossbows as well. I found one last night at Middle Mountain Cabins. There should be others at Palace of the Winding Path, in the outside building at Belching Betty, and near Welch, according to the wiki. The couple I picked up were damaged so that should save you some time.
---
I wish vendors wouldn‚Äôt use stash
---
Just went back and tried that but no luck. Nothing changed in the terminal(s) or in my quest objective. I'll try again tomorrow maybe the third time's the charm!
---
Been having this issue too. Free range event is a pain now.
---
I've read that, and while I don't have a ton of time to play, I'm definitely looking at setting that up sooner rather than later.
---
I had the same thing happen to me today as well.  Bought a TSE Handmade, it named itself as Excavator Armor.  I talked to the seller and he said he had renamed the item before putting it on the vendor.  I wonder if that has anything to do with it?
---
Just being able to convert a bunch of one star legendaries into a three star or two is a big deal, even if we do still have to sacrifice Brahmin to the RNGod
---
IGN is HonestAndDependable; will be available shortly, just finishing the paperwork for the soon-to-be proud owner of the coveted Garrahan State.
---
They didn‚Äôt put it in the patch notes but they used to have basically infinite range, now they don‚Äôt
---
Are you talking the Badge challenges?  They aren't meant to be all completed in a day.  It's a process.  The Tadpole ones aren't too bad, though there are a few you can't complete due to items not being in game, but I recommend doing the Athlete, Swimming and Archery ones.  The hardest bit of those is to revive someone.  I got someone on the marketplace to be my human sacrifice.  He stripped all armor off, threw a couple grenades at his feet and killed himself.  I revived him, and since he was in knee deep water, I got two achievements for the Tadpole challenge done.  Got my backpack and now I'm going to work on the rest intermittently when I have time.
---
How do you do this ??? Been trying for ages
---
The Engineer outfit looks really nice - there is a welding helmet that goes with it too but I like the Newsboy cap with it just fine for a kind of everyday look. It's kind of blue with a leather apron on it with tools and a oxygen tank on the back. You can get that one from turning in tech data or buy it from players fairly inexpensive.
---
I think the Hunter's Long Coat is a really nice looking coat but it's harder to find /more of a grind to get / more expensive to buy from players but it looks really nice. One of my usual outfits is the Hunter's Longcoat + Confederate Hat - they look good. 
---
The Science Scribe Outfit + a Sentry Bot helmet has a weird kind of neat vibe too it. 
---
Right now I have the Winter Jacket and Jeans + Ushanka Hat + Standard backpack which I really like - it feels like a more "drifter" type of outfit.
---
Sounds like you might be hoarding a fair few chems and possibly Armor/ weapons as well? Chems add up in weight extremely quickly, it‚Äôs what I struggle with as I find I want to keep all the stat buff Chems for a rainy day but, I‚Äôm level 68 melee and have fought everything except for the SBQ and frankly I don‚Äôt really need them. So any of the non melee damage or str/agility Chems you might be better off just quickselling. Any gun you don‚Äôt have as a backup (should really only just have one for enemies if for whatever reason you can‚Äôt reach) you should scrap or sell, and when it comes to ammo you shouldn‚Äôt have any missiles, mini nukes or fusion cores as the weight is huge. 
---
Also if you are fighting deatchlaws etc I‚Äôve noticed their parts don‚Äôt break down when you do a scrap all junk, and you‚Äôve got 8lb heads sitting in your junk stash which only have 3 pieces of junk in them. 
---
Sort all this out you should find a bit of stash room
---
Build an automatic door
---
'Hard work is its own reward'.
---
I love Gun Jesus, his videos are great.
---
Yeah, it's always smart to do your research first. It'll be interesting to watch the dust settle after this update, I imagine it's going to be market chaos for a while.
---
Just tried that, no luck :( The terminal says "Enter project passcode to proceed" but I have no option to enter a passcode ü§î odd!
---
Aww I'm sorry friend! I could always use a Medic- I'm bloody so I spend half the game dead ^ ^
---
they would have to be based on buyer, otherwise non-maxed players wouldnt be able to use it.
---
i know its shocking but &lt;lvl 50 characters DO exist =P
---
Just got S'more recipe from it.
---
Yea i used a bad example. it is indeed a great move.
---
Eh, I see it as something that holds a lot of value (non monetary) that if I play my cards right and don't be a moron, it will only need to be a one time purchase. So 200 might be a better price, but 500 is definitely not too high given that it's practical value is greater than 500. Especially when you consider how many caps are exchanging hands and making it so wealth distribution is more widespread thus giving more players caps.
---
I must admit I haven't really looked that hard yet, but where do our scrip totals accumulate?  I mean, are they listed under Misc or something where I can easily see how close to the maximum I'm getting?
---
Freaking right?!
---
what type of armor?
---
No? How about we add more players to servers
---
You can get a possum uniform from a possum vending machine - I know there is one for sure at Camp Adams where you do the new Campfire Tales event (which also has the chance to give you possum points!)
---
Are there classic rap stations now? There should be! I'm gonna be rich!
---
Brahmin milk reduces some rads.
---
Brahmin are finicky but doable. I completed it last night. I was periodically milking the ones in Flatwoods, if that makes a difference.
---
If i see someone with door or windows unlocked, i open everything and then leave. I am the toxic
---
The new Shepard‚Äôs crook is actually relatively beastly. Throw on a civil war dress and a fancy hat and you‚Äôre in business
---
Good times!? Are you insane server stability was just straight fucked bud
---
Could you explain to us what you mean? 10% per bullet means that each bullet is worth 0,9 cap for the vendor right? Then selling 1000 bullets should yield 900 caps.. no?
---
I'm not sure, but I'm also curious about how to change the pack's appearance.
---
For sure! I got in legs on Saturday and I‚Äôm still sore today. Shows how much I‚Äôve been skipping leg day. Not anymore!
---
i cant see them coming out with an update that will give you a new frame to find in-game.  i just think theyre gonna do the crossbow frame like theyve been doing the lever action skins.  i dont see how thats illogical
---
I found a dead molerat on its back, with the sentry bot red beam coming out if his face!
---
The campfire event is a nightmare for solo melee.
---
Yeah it's brutal. Lost the event twice in a row from the bug swarms. Have to switch to my backup gun just to get railed by the squatch.
---
I think it's only like the 3 you can get from the vendor machine. High capacity, armor plated, refrigerated.
---
I play it on PC and Xbox and something interesting I noticed is that the environments are different. By that I mean that the people interact completely different. On PC players are more try hard and put full effort into their character while respecting others who do the same. On Xbox people are significantly more chill and don‚Äôt completely care about the effort they put into the game, but this also leads to the fact that they don‚Äôt respect anyone because they think nobody will care if nobody puts effort into their play through. That being said, that‚Äôs just the general tone and not the complete experience. Most of the time player to player interaction is completely based on you interacting with others, and less of others interacting with you.
---
 I would assume that Playstation and Xbox are pretty similar in their environment, which is to say a significantly better environment than most multiplayer experiences. 
---
As for the game itself, massive improvements have been made since launch. While bugs still persist, it is nearly a bug free game. Massive gameplay mechanics and improvements have been made over the last couple of months which truly make it a good game.
---
*Get thee Serendipity!*
---
The Shepard‚Äôs crook has pretty good damage and looks walking stick/cane like
---
I'll start begging just to troll.
---
Yeah seems like it works like that lol.
---
It said +900 caps after both purchases tho.
---
Yup, that's pretty much my response in a nutshell for the 500 cost. The damned things never need to be repurchased and they're incredibly useful. Unlike some weapons and what not that are charged MUCH higher for whatever reason. (And I don't mean the meta ones for the best builds, I mean the ones that you'd probably use in lieu of the best because they're good enough to get you by)
---
And i thought i was the only one who had their door left ajar by visitors and ckming home to find mole rats running wild inside.
---
I would go there first before going to the bog (which at least for me makes the quest trigger 'automatically').
---
Good luck! :)
---
None of the play instuments at this location work. Tried all 3 locations, even played each instrument several times.
---
Lol. I love my quad cryolator. You‚Äôre missing out.
---
Great comment!
---
Affects renamed power armors as well, my X01 suddenly got the name of my Nuka Cola
---
Same with shoot the yao guai and radstag with syringer for me.
---
Last night I cleared 10 camps in a row of mobs checking vending machines. That‚Äôs too much, it goes from an encounter to a chore.
---
Lost my snallygaster to people spawning near my house for the new quest! Wish the anglers didn't have to spawn in EVERY TIME someone walks by.
---
I‚Äôd like that...so much time spent doing inventory management simulator
---
I usually ask for a thumbs up if they can hear me. I wish more people just used their mics.
---
Also I wish the in game chat was louder
---
Use the neon letters to put a sign up :D
---
Can you also acquire the lands of the Cranberry Bog? I want to mine Scorchbeast bone marrow to make myself Superman
---
Awesome! :D   
---
More and more people get to know me every day. When the Appalachia Fight League PPV goes live in June 18th, hopefully EVERYONE will know me :D
---
Yeah make sure you have the perk cards so you can keep those things!
---
Bathroom emote might be better ... also invincibility while sitting on a toilet.
---
It's just a bug, my power armors keep renaming them selves atm...
---
!!!! I'll check
---
I got three possum badges from the campfire event today - that was the forth time I had run it successfully
---
Already had the recipe and tent plan
---
Something. 
---
I just think it's absurd from an thematic perspective.
---
My character, who has learned to struggle through the wasteland, adapting and surviving is amazing at....... Everything. 
---
He's spent his life after leaving the vault getting stronger and stronger. Able to wield weapons with amazing strength and ability.....
---
But give him a minute and he'll also have spent that time learning to hack and/or pick locks and/or be a black smith, and/or build and repair complex things like Power Armour. 
---
How boring. 
---
The lack of specialization is going to seriously limit a player driven economy.
---
Sorry i killed the scorched..
---
All of those seem to be "use the new camera" challenges &amp; I don't think there's a way to selfie with it
---
Oh I know there will be bugs, just as long as they aren't as bad as what they used to be back in December
---
I didn‚Äôt get any possum badges I‚Äôve done the event 7 times now?? Maybe I‚Äôm super unlucky?
---
Using the 6dmg default syringe, I did this at site alpha running against the ‚ÄúShutdown Imminent‚Äù clock. Had about 30 seconds left when the beast finally went down
---
Wtf.. I did it 3 times this morning after patch &amp; got no badges.. I must be super unlucky?
---
YES PLEASE! I made a post about this last week.
---
I'm actually thinking the 2* ranged weapon might  be a great pick.... Can get 3 of them a day.
---
Who else will be riding dirty with me and rolling nothing but Mystery Picks for 65 Scrip?
---
I‚Äôve scrapped hundreds of laser rifles but they seem not to have unlocked any laser pistol mods, I haven‚Äôt found many straight laser pistols mostly just rifles
---
Stat screen of pip boy, third option over
---
I hear you! This was frustrating the ever loving hell out of me.
---
I switched to the shotgun in that event; fuck having to dash and spin around like a dervish on psychedelics.
---
But how do I get the quests?
---
Brotherhood fatigues with the military cap and wrap around goggles is my personal favorite outfit.
---
I didnt see anything come up on the rewards list, but when I went to the vendor machine I had three possum badges available to cash in - and I havent completed any of the possum badges yet (they are an even worse grind then the tadpole badges). So the event is the only place they could have come from
---
You need video proof , once you do that step Bethesda could prove
---
Thanks man I appreciate it
---
Change the stock/grip from a stock to a grip, that changes if it‚Äôs a pistol or a rifle
---
If rifles and shotguns didn't weigh like 40 pounds each we wouldn't need the extra stash.  It would be so much easier on their servers if they just reduce the weights of armor, weapons and ammo.   The cards help to reduce but it's really not enough.  they still weigh a ton.
---
there in the build some where hornright you have to take the stair all the way up to top, Not elevator
---
Will see what I can do ;)
---
I happen to have a sweet thing going with She Who Rules in those lands *wink wink*
---
Note that I've found my items in the meantime, it seems there's a bug that will cause your newly acquired item to take on the exact same name as another item you already own. Meaning the item you 'lost' is likely somewhere in your inventory, disguised as something you already owned.
---
Your friend is a monster who was born in a barn.  Don your Cultist garb and grab a Cultist dagger, and sacrifice him to the Old Ones at The Maw at midnight on a moonless night
---
You know that this must be done to save all of Appalachia.
---
Do it.
---
Well that‚Äôs interesting... but perhaps not worth the effort of implementing such a thing. Plus I think we should get grateful and stick to what we currently have, for now. And perhaps later, we could talk again about that.
---
She‚Äôs a beauty.. don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre sleeping with her.. lucky bastard
---
I dont need the stims or radaway, but thank you
---
Since November , no response from their part , doubt they‚Äôll do anything about as it forces some type of player base to purchase atoms ...
---
And Todd‚Äôs wallet getting fatter
---
Thanks!!
---
Yes please!
---
Yeah I just checked my collection thing &amp; it says I have zero :-/ I‚Äôll try &amp; do it a few more times!
---
Where would I be able to do that? It says 60$ on the PSN store which is wayyyy out of my ballpark.
---
As someone who lives on a cliff this would be good. I feel ive killed more than ive sold.
---
Okie dokie.
---
Not on FM radio that I know of. Satellite radio and apps like Pandora have 80s, 90s, and 00s hip-hop. Pandora even has 10s hip-hop, if you didn't already feel old as dirt.
---
Sounds bugged. I dunno.
---
Yeah I'm straight east on the cliffs about the B&amp;B
---
I know this is a little of topic, but they should add in a legendary fly swatter
---
I was skeptical a first myself, but it really is just so easy. Free Caps for all the crap i was never *actually* going to sell, and once I set up the machines in my camp the effort to maintain them is minimal. Ever since the patch, my cap total has been fluctuating constantly. 
---
Before now, the only time it changed by more than about a thousand was when i was close to max and bought a bunch of plans to get back down.
---
Because the skins aren't mods that change anything other than cosmetic. Completely different
---
I think the update has been awesome and the scouts are one of the better additions - the badges are grindy, but not too bad. I see them more as a long term thing (especially the possum ones) that I can tick off as I do other things. The backpack is great, and having that extra carry capacity is such a welcome thing.
---
The feeling of a living world (see other players camps on the map, and having the option to visit) is awesome, and there is a certain thrill when you hear the sound of a sale. 
---
I would have liked a couple of things though
---
* A way to see avg prices of items when I put mine up for sale
---
* A transaction log or something so I can keep tabs on everything that does get sold.
---
* Higher ranks in the scounts - hopefully there will be something beyond possum in later updates
---
* Confirmation on if badges are awarded from the scout events/quests
---
And Class Freak so I can minimize the damage from those negatives. Speed Demon and Healing Factor are definitely annoying negs
---
I took a lot but I don't have an imger I'll make one when I get off tonight
---
Also Kadala was Gheed's Daughter. Gheed was the gambling merchant in D2.
---
They aren‚Äôt going to implement a trading system like this but I WOULD like to see a ‚Äòbuy‚Äô terminal option where you can put on what you‚Äôd like to purchase at what price and people could sell it to your terminal. 
---
It would offer some additional trading options without compromising their intent of regulating the caps market
---
Currently stuck in a water purifyer, keeps happening will have to fast travel away and walk back.
---
Also a peace sign (f***ing commie pinkos), a middle finger, crotch grab, drunk/been drinkin', an awkward handstand (or a graceful one, if you're character has a high enough ability score), see no evil, hear no evil, speak No evil (separately),  and yoga poses (maybe a yoda pose ... thanks auto correct), flexing, Bruce Lee style 'come at me bro' (maybe a two handed chest slap), you stink, you're awesome, thank you, i mean hell, resort to sign language if you have to.
---
Indeed for the folks who grind west tech all day, this is not much, but for the rest of us, a 1-2 three stars a day is really nice.
---
Yeah I checked on the new collection tab, and it showed zero as well, but the vendor machine showed I had three to spend.
---
Maybe the new tab only shows ones that you have earned from completing challenges?
---
Why would I sell them to you for 200 when I can vendor them for 473 with a 4 charisma? 500 is totally fair. Everyone just got used to the lower prices when vendors could not buy them. Especially how they require both flux, and  ultracite which is not cheap now.
---
They wrote it on INSIDE THE VAULT for the burrows patch that the burrows were supposed to be a dungeon, it wasn't but still, they did say that.
---
Complete possum challenges to get badges then you can use them to buy plans at the scout Pioneer camp from a vending machine :) you need 8 badges for the extended backpack
---
Experiencing this on PC as well.
---
It gives me the option, but it doesn't work on the first try. I have to try 2-3 times before I actually fast travel.
---
You get by completing possum world challnged for badges. Theres 2 vending machines at the camp and you buy the plans there.
---
üôÑ
---
Yup. Noticed it too yesterday.
---
Can't hit any flying insects in vats anymore.
---
I was just kidding ... i'm older than eminem fans ... it was kind of a joke within a joke ... who actually listens to the radio any more.
---
Innosurvivalist is a girl. Are you talking about the same video?
---
Haha yeah true
---
Sorry I'm on ps4
---
The Burrows was definitely a dungeon. It's not an instanced dungeon, but definitely a dungeon by all definitions of tge word. Whether it's easy ir hard is a different issue.
---
You know I don‚Äôt think I was actually aware of that. Too busy slinging blood shards at her head.
---
Oh no, why'd this one have to give those plans &gt;.&lt;
---
Op edited it. Early it was a nightmare to read
---
Alot of gamers have udders ... and they're mostly male ...
---
That must be it, thanks!
---
They are not there. I guess I will have to open a ticket with bethesda. ( I ham a possum scout) I did have a crash shortly after I completed the tadpole quest
---
Does hitting with the weapon also count?
---
They're not quests, they're challenges. They show up in the same place daily and weekly quests do.
---
I cant remove some of mine as well
---
I've been rocking the brotherhood scribe outfit with a cowboy hat. Looks pretty good, especially with the backpack
---
If it is too dark the mobs would never detect some of us in PvE.....and may not spawn.
---
Save them up until you have multiples. As long as you have more maps you can keep digging the same spot. The forrest treasure maps only drop lvl 20ish weapons and usually common plans but it can be worth it for scraping low lvl ledgendarys and the small amount of caps you find.
---
I accidentally got a bounty by "stealing" from a govt drop after almost being killed by a charred ghoul that spawned with it.  a dude 30 levels over me ran up and killed me for the bounty and took my junk bag. I was pissed, so I jumped back to my camp to gear up again. As I'm crafting, the same dude comes into my house and I assume is going to kill me again. He drops all of the junk I was carrying, plus 5 stims and some ammo. Gives me a thumbs up and runs away. There are some cool people in this game.
---
is this...is this sarcasm? did the chainsaw get nerfed?
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Definitely wasn't then.  It wasn't someone I subscribe to, just a 'suggested video' that popped up on my feed.  I'll have to give her a look and see if that one is any more convincing.
---
Wait, I saw nothing in the patch notes about chainsaws. What happened?
---
Check challenges --&gt; world and scroll down until you find possum challenges
---
Hey can u get back to me on your messages? Still wondering about that hunting rifle :)
---
In patch 9.5 you will be able to take this to the next level.
---
There are releasing a mod that lines the chain with prime quality goose down.
---
Because nothing says Fallout more than tickling a scorched to death :P
---
üòÖlmao
---
Wow this is the opposite of salty
---
I didn't even think about this. I've been capping scrip daily on 10 toons, but only one is above level 5.
---
Shit.
---
Yeah it's pretty bizarre.
---
I took a shit.
---
You....ESAD.
---
You may have done what I did. There are 2 vending machines. 1 for tadpole tokens. 1 for possum tokens. In the beginning I didn't think I was getting tadpole badges because I didn't see the second machine
---
In fact I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs sweet
---
Why would they nerf a weapon that only spawns at lvl 20 and only does 30 damage max?
---
Check out today's Inside the Vault article and the information about the Purveyor. You turn your legendary's into scrip, and you have a chance to roll an item of your choice from a broad category and I just don't want anyone wasting their legendarys.
---
OverRepair got nerfed, which was the only thing making the chainsaw, ripper and BuzzBlade viable
---
I kind of want a ghoul mutation that lets us make our character look more like a ghoul but would be cosmetic with a ghoul / anti ghoul serum so we don't have to delete all mutations for a costume change
---
True art
---
"Granny does your dog bite?"
---
"No, child, no."
---
I never even tried to deal with mutations until this patch, since I've always been lower level and fairly poor. Now I specced my character specifically around marsupial, since I could easily buy it. It's been a pretty good few days
---
My mule is level 3 and sells hundreds of stable flux, tse weapons, bulk stuff, and armor. Tried to put ut on my main but it turns out to be too heavy
---
Never buy games from the ps store it‚Äôs always overpriced af. I recommend console-deals.com which finds some of the best prices available for all kinds of games. Also people on ebay are always selling the game for cheap so that‚Äôs an option.
---
Looks like he couldn't, lol. That dude picks fights with people, often swears and goes way overboard for the conversation and then just deletes the comments later, same as here. Now that I've noticed him it's almost daily i see him say something without actually knowing what he's talking about and then just delete the comment. I don't get it but i have had several laughs about it and it's quite entertaining at times
---
You do know how to turn a man on with those words.
---
I'll be restarting my life in West Virginia soon :)
---
Still a bit much at the moment. Thanks anyway.
---
I'll probably be on tonight from 8 or 9 until midnight-ish. PM me your GT and I'll add you as a friend so that if you're on I'll see you in the in game friend list.
---
Where did you find the arms? I need arms and legs.
---
we need doors with a auto shut mechanism that simply closes the door after 20 secs - we have them in real life why not in game
---
It seems like a good weapon, the reloading takes a while with these so the damage resist while reloading is especially handy on one of these.
---
But I think I‚Äôll stick too my heavy guns ;)
---
Also using the bleeder barrel (I think that's what it's called) adds a DoT bleeding effect, which really helps. That's how I got my kill with it
---
It is a MUCH more inbolved subject. One that I don't care to get in to detail about. The balance is bad and its never going to be right.
---
thats my point.  if they were gonna add mods for it, they would have a mod section for the crossbow, but they dont currently.  that is why i think the "frames" will be nothing more than skins available in the atomic shop.
---
 A scrolling marquee that we can edit from our terminal would be sick.
---
I'd love permadeath or hardcore instead of survival...
---
Now I want both the fiddle and a weapon based on it added to the game, almost as much as I want a mouth harp added to my camp.
---
I have seen them for anywhere from 200 to 2000. Give it a few weeks so that people have a chance to really look around, and you will see the prices of things will start to stabilize. To anyone who thinks 500 is too much, before I discovered the trading subs, I payed retail at the Enclave Bunker for 3 of them. I just bought 3 more today for 300 each. They are cheap enough now that I can play around with different mutation sets to see what works best for me.
---
Only new 1s I've gotten have been tick and radroach from the bug parts daily
---
Black powder is boss. I carry a BP rifle and pistol for a backup. The load time isn't a problem if you don't get caught off guard
---
Just go to the venders they have every single plan they can have even if somebody else bought them
---
I just bought all of the bos combat armor plans :)
---
I suspect its a feature. It worked in Fallout 4 as well.
---
They might be using stairs.  I'll have to try when I get home.
---

My camp is covered with lights..
---
This is how I was able to register the pic: go to east side of the bridge, then get down the hill under the bridge. Look up and take your pic from under the bridge.
---
cant even hit turrets on walls, used to beable to vats them and autojump attack to them within range, cant anymore.
---
Strange.
---
I'm at around 300 hours and have never had this happen.
---
It's definitely worth mentioning on the bug megathreads that people post when a new patch drops, I saw a thread yesterday.
---
Edit: A screenshot or video helps too, for the dev team.
---
Vangaurd, 1 star heavy Vangaurd with brotherhood of steel nets you over 400 DR. I have no damage resistance perks but mainly use vats and crits. if I'm not using Dense I'm using lighter to add AP refresh bonus. If you can get pieces with AP bonus even better. Your goal is to be so aggressive you don't get hit in PvP . Think overwhelming firepower. I use furious two shot and armor piercing weapons. I open with an instigating that has damage resistance and close with an executioner that increase crit damage. my middle gun is armor piercing or two shot depending on situation. good luck
---
I go in there with my BOS Armor all the time. Nothing registers with them. üòÄ I believe we're all under the assumption that the BOS no longer exist but I have a feeling that once they begin to open up these other vaults we will find out differently.
---
You all do know you can sell a serum to the vendor for 500 caps? 
---
I am all for free market, but why sell them for anything less?
---
I'm not saying there aren't exceptions, but I've never seen what you describe.
---
It‚Äôs a permutation game, with a twist!
---
Say 25 1 Star options, 8 2 star, and 9 3 star.
---
You want a specific set of 3 stars on your weapon on choice it‚Äôs a 1/1800 chance if you get that weapon.  If there are 50 weapon choices?  Well then it‚Äôs a 1:90000 chance.
---
The twist(s): 
---
-we‚Äôre not 100% sure if everything has a true equal chance.
---
--there are reports that carrying item types increases chances to get it.  Like if you have only unyielding armor, you in theory have a stronger chance of getting unyielding.
---
This is why the purveyor May be fun, but don‚Äôt be expecting your god rolls in the first week, unless you‚Äôre sleeping with Lady Luck.
---
I wish I could say, I honestly don‚Äôt even remember where I got the arms and chest piece myself. Most likely from random events but I‚Äôm positive there has to be a plan spawn for them somewhere. I just read another post that said they have a chance to spawn in the brick building with the hole when you fast travel to Harpers ferry
---
Combat armor
---
Also, check your camp icon on your map every now and then to make sure it is the shop camp icon.  Mine wasn't earlier today and it was because enemies had destroyed my generator.
---
No. This would be cancerous. They should further nerf perk card switching so that people aren't being tryhards with their stats.
---
I tried whitesprings a couple of times as well as the harpers ferry vendor and I didn‚Äôt see them in there :(
---
I might just have to do this now lol
---
Even better if u get a bunch of players to make a new faction. The IRS.  All agents have to be in suits and they would have to travel to players who have been avoiding the 10% tax (somehow)
---
I think we can all rest easy. But there has to be a reason for being able to do this. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
---
I have 3 locked security doors down a corridor until I have enough supplies for a keypad door
---
I like building, wandering, exploring, scavenging, and also fighting (not against other players), and I get what you say, 99% of the time I don't fear for my life.
---
I would totally be up for newer hardcore places and/or events, just as long as they don't REQUIRE more than 1 people to do them. 
---
Sometimes I want to join a group and sometimes don't. Don't want to be limited by groups when i play the game. 
---
Aside from that, bring the pain Bethesda!! :)
---
well yes, but actually no
---
Bleedout and yes it makes this much easier.  Also because it is dot you can hit the bear with other things and still probably get the kill. Or just pull a sword and block for awhile.
---
O ok, nm. I'd hooked ya up. I'm on xbox sorry bud. Good luck
---
New public event: tax season
---
Ahhhh I see, okay I‚Äôll check the vending machine then. Thank you! I thought I was just the most unlucky guy in the world
---
Bashing counted for crossbow, so it should
---
Tesla Gun has standard and reflex sights. I mod them all the time. Reflex sight gives a couple of little green dots to aim with.
---
He need some milk?
---
Me i saw lots of those. You can see what the guy sell without fast traveling also. If you see only 2 weapons, probably a low level. But if you see 4000 of junk and 30000 of bullets, its a low level mule because it would be too heavy to stash all that on a main.
---
I mainly go to player canp that are lvl 2 or 3 because they would have the most stuff. Between lvl 5 and 100, yeah i would agree its so so.
---
And if its a lvl 200, he might have one or two stuff that is interesting but not as much as mule camps
---
Look for camps around overseer camp
---
Never thought of adding that back to my perks actually. Seems like an obvious choice with the Healing Factor negative.
---
HIDE YA WIFE
---
Wat do you do to get 3 stars every day? I feel like I have seen a grand total of 10 of them in hundreds of hours lol
---
Ha ha, because it was budget-friendly and had interesting scaling? My favorite build was Flicker Strike using Oro's Sacrifice.
---
Hey man, sorry. I‚Äôll be on around 10pm est tonight if that works for you.
---
I love healing factor but I moderately regret it because I‚Äôm a bloodied build lmao it‚Äôs okay though saves me on stimpak‚Äôs
---
I have a heavy laser turret so minor spawns dont annoy me at home
---
Well. Someone either had a lot of level grinding to do or 150 x 3 x 9 worth of level 1 legendaries coming his way! 
---
But seriously, that sucks. &gt;_&lt; Here's to hoping she only deals in max level legendaries because really, what low levels would be over in The Mire to meet her?
---
No worries.. glad I could help!!
---
My CAMP is located just up from New gad.. come and check it out..
---
I have had this too. Idk what's causing it but it does get old!
---
So its pretty affective?
---
D3's Kadala would like a word with you.
---
Earlier, I ran into a charred feral unruly golfer at Whitespring that identified as a glowing honey beast.
---
You can't wear arm armor with this mutation as drawback
---
The one you get given adds 30, but is only a low level one. You can craft higher level ones, with the level 50 version adding 60 weight. 
---
You can eventually add the extra weight mod to it, which gives further weight, although I cannot recall how much more.
---
It's the Sheepsquatch imposter outfit from the Encryptid event
---
You were correct, it was Polarbear Igloo that I saw (same video she saw that sent her down this path).
---
I will admit, her video was pretty convincing, it certainly was clear what was going on (if not why), and now I'm quite curious what's going on with all that.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll see if I‚Äôll be able to get on then just message me
---
That right there too. Honestly, unless you REALLY don't need caps and you are practically giving them away because you want to see more people have easy access? At least sell for max vendor amount.
---
It's in the files. Arktos is a dungeon with an event, as opposed to a one off quest.
---
Yeah, I'm getting ready to cross 600 hours and it has happened more than I care to remember. It's not even a vital, game changing bug..it's just a hassle.
---
I'll add it to the thread later tonight. Good suggestion. 
---
I have very low hope of a ticket being put in ever being seen in my lifetime..lol..but it's worth a shot as well.
---
Build multiple vending machines. Idk why it works but it does. Each vending machine can hold 30 stacks of items or 30 items.
---
If you're on xb, I can part with one.
---
So you are only talking about the scrapping part to make sure you don't go over 1000. Got it.
---
I‚Äôve always used heavy laser turrets and they seem to do the trick. I tend to avoid the missiles so they don‚Äôt blow up my crops and stuff.
---
Ive been seeing this and worse for weeks. Made a bug report with screenshots and they really didn't have much to say about it
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs takes a minimal amount of support perks in order to help each other out enough. I was thinking of creating a high charisma character but overall most of the perks don‚Äôt seem like they are worth the points
---
I sold mine for 2000 ish, that was about the effort I put in to getting it. I already had a 3star tse .50 and a two star tse in the shop along side it for 2700ish
---
It hasn't been to good
---
I had one which has been gone for ages. Thought i scrapped it until it came back last night. Then i scrapped it.
---
Ahh, must‚Äôve missed that part. I just recall the data miner saying it was supposedly an actually challenging dungeon &amp; even described in detail some of the objectives inside the dungeon. That‚Äôd be depressing if it‚Äôs only a repeatable event. (Unless that event actually gives us new items we care about)
---
We just got over "i quit" posts and now we're full of "i'm back" . Sigh
---
I guess I‚Äôll have too have a look at these then.
---
Hope we get chainsaws one could hope :D
---
Thanks for the info, I'm still rather pissed as if it wasn't for dupers I would not have to deal with all these nerfs. It seems like all they do anymore. (Rant done, now depression starts.)
---
It's worth way more than that, I've seen them swap hands for 10k+ and it's only going to get rarer.
---
I have a bloody VATS x-bow that would like a word with you...
---
Or how about no unreasonable prices all together.
---
I agree, maybe +10% damage with musical instruments while well tuned.
---
How about the ability to equip regular instruments and play them while standing or walking around. Maybe it could even help with taming creatures.
---
Also perks or special score affecting your ability/ song book ... higher agility=better playing ... higher intelligence=more variety of songs ... Hell, I might waste a perk from time to time to be able to play a decent tune instead of the crap programmed into the game now. I'd definitely get the perk. 
---
And on a side note, how dare you not put a fiddle in this go**amned game, fah que bathesda.
---
100cc's of death for that witch
---
This has come up dozens of times, the search feature can be fickle.  
---
They are not supposed to exist, this is not a new issue / question.  
---
The Charging Barrel has a AP_Gun_FrontSight, which is a deviation from the rest of the gun, and I've only seen the scope show up on the Charging barrel versions, somehow, though it's not clear, a scope from another firearm is getting attached during the legendary generation process.  
---
My only guess is when the DLC weapons get inserted via script (assuming they are injected like in FO4) there is a hiccup in the process, it rolled a firearm, the tesla rifle is subbed in, and one of the mods remains attached due to the open, non-conforming AP on that barrel
---
What a PITA, lmao. I'll check it out tomorrow and, if it hasn't come back, just build another one. Again.
---
Im in the forest so much creatures are low lvl but it usually gets them all real quick for just the 1. Would have used explosive but was afraid it would cause damage or hurt moo moo.
---
Take my upvote good sir!
---
Only the bugs have been added with this update. Probably next update.
---
because of dupers, literally carrying dozens of thousands of weight, some even several magnitudes beyond 
---
hoarders in the 1k range never hurt anyone
---
And that's the reason why I locked my CAMP
---
I don't feel like this game is build driven. Really any weapon can work like pipe weapons. just pick two and focus on that. Spec into it rather or user whatever you can until something you like drops but always have a second option. something for crowds and something for single enemy. If you only carry long range weapons that share ammo you'll have a tough go. Ask yourself : " What will I use in close range crowds?" and "what will I use long range or mid?"  I carry 3 weapons into battle. A heavy or long gun, an automatic and a revolver if some type. I have only 5 ST and no weight reduction perks so I am always planning things out or using drugs. I Don't use excavator armor so getting a backpack is a new goal lol.  I'm on PS4 If you need help but feel free to message me here. I love the look of combat armor and I usually am wearing it.
---
The owner must be at the camp. Then you can
---
Idk I've been wondering that too
---
I think it came back because i had to repair all for some reason. But it has been weeks since i last saw it.
---
What about near white spring? Their are mr gutsys, asaultrons and securitrons. But will the laser weapons work on level 30-48‚Äôs?
---
This is confusing,  i had another user saying something about scrip to me on another thread but i assumed maybe they meamt scrap,  what is a scrip?
---
Have you been getting a bug where the ghouls will come at you while still in their laying down animations? Ngl, it's pretty creepy.
---
There are still a lot of bugs and problems come and go and differ quite a bit for every player. 
---
Overall though the game has come a long way from December. I think it‚Äôs finally at the state it should‚Äôve been at release.
---
You could just go into area chat and start singing ...
---
Make sure to take off any perk cards that improve weapon durability before you craft.
---
No
---
If the price is too high, don‚Äôt buy. If someone buys my 1 star axe for 20,000 caps.....good for me.
---
That's why i love them ! Such a good feeling when you get a backpack and upgrade it.
---
You have 1920 effect possible combos on ranged weapons, can make only 1 and half roll each day and you worry about not getting syringer. Thats like being on Titanic and worrying about if you locked the door at home.
---
Yes.  I was thinking about this at work, and I'm likely going to purchase the 2 and 3 star ranged weapons and the mystery item every day, at least until I run out of scrips.
---
Awesome! Thanks.
---
Yes but will still only allow a max of 800lbs, unless there's a bug/glitch &amp; if there is I need it ;)
---
you should probably post the sources to this information... 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm27me/psa\_you\_have\_a\_max\_cap\_of\_1000\_scrip\_per\_character/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm27me/psa_you_have_a_max_cap_of_1000_scrip_per_character/)
---
No. Maybe it changes at a certain level, I was in my 106, but access to the upper floor is now blocked, restricting access to where the overseers stash previously was.
---
Events can be challenging, as evidenced by Encryptid, etc. From what I remember when I looked at it, it was complicated and seemingly difficult.
---
Yeah, I get you. Initially I was like "I want it nooowwwww", but now I'm kind of glad that I've got some reasons to come back and play for a while, doing a bit each day.
---
Quite a few people including me use wood armour btw. The drill.... not so much.
---
I walked the bridge and when i reached the middle, i jumped. Took the picture from under the bridge and it worked.
---
Nah. See that's the thing. Increasing the stash limit promotes even less specialization and that's less helpful to the player economy.
---
Well you aren't wrong but in the end I just don't need that many caps. I paid 2500 for my 3 star tse and I have based all values on that sense. Hopefully the gun ends up in the hands of some one who had no other way of affording one.
---
Some people are just awesome like this.  I put a can of dog food in my vendor for 10k just hoping someone does the same for me.  Can't hurt.
---
Turrets arent great in general so none will do much against higher lvls but laser or explosive should slow them down. Depends on how many u can make.
---
Where I come from, milking an animal is the sincerest form of petting.
---
Hopefully Murm doesn't. It displays as a 3* mystery roll for 65scrip. Let's hope it stays that way.
---
Edit: "Low level" got it.
---
You can only vend up to 800 lbs. Or what your stash can hold. He had easily 100,000 lbs of inventory. Definitely not legit.
---
ive sold mine quickly at 50 caps, ive seen people attempt to pawn them off for 500 caps. i checked later and they where still sitting there
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
My votes on no.
---
Just use t-60
---
I've never had much luck with them to begin with!  Mind you it's no real issue now we can dispose if them at stations for scrip.
---
It was a be laser rifle
---
&gt;Speaking of future updates, we‚Äôre adding Patch 9.5 to our Wild Appalachia line-up in order to bring a new repeatable event to the game, called Project Paradise, and fix a few more bugs. 
---
No matter how many times I read this, I can't find Arktos or dungeon in that description.
---
That‚Äôs not me, but that‚Äôs awesome! Sounds like a great spot! üòä
---
I have mine labeled very conspicuously.
---
If you want them to be bought by someone who will use them, 1 cap more than a vendor bot would pay and less caps than you can buy from the vendor bot.
---
If your just looking to unload stash or am like me and love seeing transactions pop up on the screen, very cheap.
---
People like you are why the economy is awful.
---
Oki, maybe I‚Äôll try a mix of laser and kinetic then.
---
They really must fix these challenges since they unlock new content. I'm hoping for next patch but i don't think they got time for that. We'll probably see it fixed next month
---
i lost all ammo twice (300+ first time, 200+ second time) now this past week and still haven't figured out why .. on shotgun none-the-less buuuut again it's been made easier to farm so i got more ammo insanely fast .. and for shotgun so that says a lot .. 
---
some people have been complaining about buyin shit on player vendors to only have their caps taken and no item received and a new dupe has .. well theres still some kinks
---
i completed 2 or 3 of the new quests exams only to realize that while I passed the test it didn't actually count but the gameplay is still fun and theres def always shit to do and ppl to mingle with .. plus i hear theres females so that keeps me going
---
Okay I didn't think about that
---
I am aware of that, thanks. In previous challenges, before the last 2 patches or so, they wouldn't count for the challenge. For this one they do.
---
As I noted in another comment, no, the mutant hounds do not count for the purpose of the challenge
---
It also works on fall damage so +1
---
I‚Äôve been finding a ton of 3*s behind the big houses but you have to get there before the bots kill them
---
How much salt was it, hopefully 25000 of them ..
---
my post from yesterday has the proof
---
Dude, this is genius.
---
Yes. They are bugged like many challenges.
---
I second this.  It's hard to be both functional and well-decorated with the current budget constraints.  My house has a 'basement' with all of the crafting stuff, and even an extractor, but with all those resources, I need some defenses.  After all that, the living quarters on the upper level appear functional, but spartan.  With just a little more budget, I could dec out the house nicely, especially with some of the atom store stuff that I don't have room for.
---
Will check it out, thanks!
---
Explain
---
Exactly. But I always carry a melee or shotgun to quick swap too if the distance is being closed too quickly
---
I like the stash limit for vending as it is now. 
---
It allows you to either sell a little bit of everything or more of just a few things.
---
Also what happens if you have 20K caps, do you only get 5K ?
---
That post assumes a whole lot of information that we don't have.  Take anything in that thread with a *HUGE* grain of salt.
---
This only happens when you add from your stash. Try moving it to your personal inventory first and then it doesn‚Äôt seem to have that problem
---
best I can do is 3500
---
add me yalc-1
---
You can have a million pound inventory. There was a small handful of Players who duped in the first wave back in December. Who didn‚Äôt have good weapons or armor but had heaps or junk and other valued items. They didn‚Äôt track junk items or aid. Only weapons armor and ultracite ammo. So when the ban wave came a lot of players who didn‚Äôt dupe weapons or armor were missed. Also Bethesda allowed for banned players to write a essay. Saying why duping is bad and so on. Those player who wrote the essay and got unbanned only had there stacks taken and kept everything else.
---
this is actually a thing. the list for all of the armor choices has the enclave scout armors in it.
---
also its just a roll from the whole loot table for the mystery pick
---
Try going to bos vender they have tons of things
---
Oh? Didn't know that. That's pretty sweet.
---
Did you get his name? Was he on PC ?
---
Complete tadpole challenges. They are in the world challenge section I believe.
---
Honestly. Take whatever, if someone gives a shit then they should have locked it. 
---
I take a locked resource as a please leave this. Even though I can take the level three I don‚Äôt. Otherwise it‚Äôs fair game.
---
What i want is to be able to put skins on power armor without scraping the mods first
---
Nobody wants that.
---
I completed 5 challenges. The stupid event won't give me any badges.
---
This is just ballistic correct? Do energy weapons get a bump from tank killer?
---
I can't keep ammo/aid/booze and chems in stock fast enough.
---
Eat trash, play dead
---
You serious? I make 2K in a few hours.
---
I estimate my main characters + all mules add up to around 3000-3500; 600 more if we count the to-be-liquidated legendaries though
---
if you know where to look, gathering resources is easyish. most of the effort comes from launching the nukes to target areas of proper flux colors.
---
i was at around 18k when my soulmate bought it, it caps you out at 25k no matter what the item sells for
---
You can't hurt other players when you are doing same quest

1920 possible effects, yes. But based on RNG loot experience over 360 hours, my odds of getting a syringer is about 48%, with 20% chance of getting a pistol, 18% of a heavy gun, 10% chance of an energy weapon, 2% of getting a radium rifle, 1% of getting a BP rifle, .8% of hunting/combat, and .2% of getting a lever/handmade.
---
Then, thar doesn't take into account the 92% I have of getting a hunter/stalker/troubleshooter prefix.
---
Dude, the swimmer make me giggle almost as much as the mythical, almost unkillable glowing long dog.
---
I just kept shooting it with the bleedout and jumping around. Hooray for marsupial! I also went to Dolly Sods for some silly reason and completed it with a lvl 76 glowing yao guai
---
So take a couple screen shots and report it to Bethesda.  If they find anything wrong they'll deal with it.
---
Feel free to have a nice collection. 
---
Then feel free to just visit me and buy all the other stuff you need as you need it. Ammo, aid, chems, mats. 
---
Win win for both of us :)
---
Must have half a butthole or it's just cosplay.
---
&gt;If you go over 1000, you're not getting ANYMORE scrip. Just like the 25k caps balance. SO PLEASE, fellow wastelanders and former vault-dwellers, BE MINDFUL of your legendary weapons and don't return them to RNGeesus for NOTHING!
---
That means, recycle first the stuff that is moderately heavy to it's scrip value.
---
On average, how much stable flux do you get out of a single nuke zone?
---
Not huge, it but will affect some.
---
Yeah, can definitely see where that poses an issue. Haha. I'm a no real discernable build build, so it works out to be not too bad for me. Still in the process of screwing around with things that I might find fun. Thinking Heavy Guns though, fell in love with that Weekly Challenge gun recently.
---
Queen a few times is enough for at least 10 serums
---
F that noise.
---
You know how many caps I'm making off selling junk? Stop hoarding it and just go buy it from. Your local vendors as you need it :)
---
I think every piece likely has an equal chance to drop, then the effects are randomized.  Given that there's leather, metal, combat, trapper, raider, robot and marine options in three different weights and five different pieces (torso, l arm, r arm, l leg, r leg), that's probably why armor seems so much more common than weaponry (not to mention the five wood variants, but they all seem to only be light armor).
---
I use rifles capable of being suppressed, and there's only combat, assault, handmade, pipe, bolt action pipe, lever, hunting and gauss for my options.  That leaves me with a pretty small chance to get any of those rifles with the effects I want.
---
I don‚Äôt really care either way :)
---
My friend you could have nearly a million pounds, if not more, legitimately, if you had more than one account and hoarded everything..  
---
At one point I had nearly 100,000 pounds of just collect PA pieces.  
---
OP,  
---
You don't have to compete directly with them, you'll see someone like that very very rarely, price things how you want and enjoy when people do buy... If your prices are reasonable.
---
Hey thanks! I‚Äôm not looking for highly specific rolls, just ‚Äúgood‚Äù ones in general that can be used to barter what I am looking for. I remember a calculator that was floating around some time ago that put drop odds approaching the millions so this is definitely an improvement.
---
[Just one?](https://imgur.com/a/DhyJer2)
---
With the Nerf to sentinel, you die alot more in pve. So more glass than cannon
---
yeh no kidding. it is a 2 handed melee weapon :) try it out
---
I assume you are referring to the Pioneer Scout stuff?
---
First you have to join the Pioneer Scouts at the Pioneer Scout Camp in the Toxic Valley. Upon joining, you are given the Tadpole rank and a multi-step quest (complete 3 Scout challenges, Revive someone, clean up some toxic waste and kill some bugs). Complete that quest and you are given the rank of Possum.
---
If you are referring to the animal, use the Marsupial serum and kill lots of ticks.
---
Yep, atlough unless someone knows better I would assume it's the same 20 hour reset as caps.
---
No it doesn't. 
---
You could still be selling 40 or so heavy weapons at any given time.....
---
It's a trade off. I don't sell weapons or armour. I sell chems, aid, mats and booze.
---
That's a realy nice idee but i play on PS4üò≠
---
Saved you the disappointment of 13 high levels joining late and spawning in 10 times their weight in Mr Gutsys and not taking one pylon or wasting their precious ammo (or waiting, hoping to spawn in a few legendaries)  and losing the event after spending the caps on a card (2100 caps base).
---
I recommend forming a team, even with a rando if nothing else, to make sure you can find your way back to the server where you started the event.  It's shitty that we can't "rejoin last server" within, say, 5 minutes of an ungraceful disconnect, but this is a viable workaround.
---
That‚Äôs why you live in the mire like me, where the only thing spookier then the creaking of a pylon is that glowing Wendigo who leaps from the dark to scare the life out of me
---
Just read the latest post about the Purveoyor from fallout.com.
---
Good catch.
---
Downvoted cause yall pay too much lol ok
---
mostly depends on the nuke zone. you need hardened mass, glowing mass, and high rad fluid per stable flux made. i normally have a large stockpile of them, but since player vending came out ive burnt through a large portion of my stock. will need to refresh soon
---
A little bit of work. Target different areas for different things; flux, masses, fluids. Nuclear keycards and time in the silos.  But all good as it gives xp and something to do. Benefit from selling stable flux or serums. Cheers.
---
That would actually be amazing.
---
Gt: HerbalxAssassin
---
Can we just rename the item and have that show up? A quick description?
---
I've already forgotten what the quest there is. Lol
---
You can repair the same one 3 times, you dont have to get separate ones. 
---
Take off any perks that make weapons break slower before you go killing the 50 enemies. That will cause damage. Repair. If you found the crossbow chances are it would need repairing to begin with. You can bash enemies with it, or even just bash a wall/rock or whatever. That causes damage. Even a little damage, just as long as it can be repaired.
---
I found a cricket that identified as a sentry bot
---
Red light steam and everything
---
It also means player vendors kind of have to choose to be a "general store" type vendor with a little bit of everything, or be more specialized and focus on alot of a few specific things. 
---
Encourages and allows for more activity at more player vendors.
---
Yea possible dupe. Tricking the server to make an extra copy is my guess.
---
i think you can obtain some unique items only from that pick, like power armor, Alien blaster, etc
---
I'M NOT A KID, I JUST WASNT TO BE FRIENDS!
---
I can‚Äôt wait for those responder paints to come out, I have been waiting since the games beta when I first learned of the responders
---
Haha I guess I'm just used to the busted ass chainsaw!
---
I think they were referring to the guy talking about selling an overpriced axe
---
I really thought the personal terminal would be implementing some sort of text chat, maybe send texts to friends via terminal, but nope, well not yet maybe in the future.
---
I honestly think it has a chance to go either way. There really is absolutely no point in grinding for legendaries when you're below level 50, so hopefully they're max level.
---
Just buy it from a player vendor as you need it.
---
Dang, people downvote a valid question. But yeah it's been datamined.
---
Yes please, adding now
---
Ok, that makes more sense
---
Of all the things to complain about, this is about as dumb as you can get. Unlike real life where the supply of money is (supposedly finite), new caps are infused into the in game economy every time someone kills a super mutant.
---
Without an assortment of small cap sinks like fast travel fees and vendor tax, the value of caps would inflate even more than it already has. This was absolutely necessary, and I think BGS nailed it when they picked 10%.
---
&gt; mouse controllers
---
wtf is that supposed to mean lol 0.o
---
I really would like to toss scrips for a re roll on a existing efect of a legendary.
---
lol yeh i hear ya.
---
i love my buzz blade instigating used to wreck before this patch.
---
now the over repair doesnt add damage to your weapon. BGS working on a fix ;)
---
Yooo that's a wonderful experience! Your very own post-apocalyptic version of Cheers!
---
I completed the shoot the Radstag and Yao Guai I‚Äôve shot a dozen wolves and not working for me
---
It's because you're not a good vendor. 
---
Specialize in something or be a general store with a little bit of everything. 
---
If every player vendor had tons of everything it'd promote less activity at fewer player vendors.
---
It would be prone to review bombing as well, especially with things like repair kits, but what you've mentioned is a much more complex issue and probs the strongest argument against it.
---
In all honesty I'm just hoping for more out the atom shop and whilst it's content has improved I still think it has a lot more potential. Perhaps if we got more stuff at a quicker rate it'd be better, there's still things like the Handmade skin that have been floating about in the files for a while now.
---
It would harm player vendors.
---
That's not really a thing most players can sustain on a daily basis. Unless you've got some secret farming method.. I rarely see 3 star enemies, and even more rare it actually drops a 3* item.
---
I think it might be easier to farm players that are selling junk, which will probably become that much more rare with the vendor.
---
And get in groups when you do it too - everyone in your group gets the award even if only one person had the map
---
Custom item names are only visible to the person who named the item :(
---
&gt; another thread won't work
---
no m8, we just haven't reached the critical mass of posts for something to be done about it
---
I like schrooms ... makes it seem more educational.
---
There's no economy in this game.
---
more than one person can use it at a time.
---
There are 2 in the room lmao!!!
---
Dumb question, I logged in the other day, got the update and checked out some player vending and noticed that each had several vending machines. Can we not just have one machine for all our goods that we want to sell? Each machine seemed to have different stuff and I couldn't make sense of the order.
---
the pump action shotgun lacks sight. Personally would like a glow and reflex sight any maybe a scope for blonger barrels and maybe slam fire? It's good that it has a lot of barrel types and variants but I think it be nice to add in some more features to make it unique.
---
Her vid (based on polarbear‚Äòs input) convinced me, that it‚Äôs working. But it seems like quite a hustle tbh, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use it...
---
You can still get on the computer if someone‚Äôs on it. You bring up your pip boy and that is used as the screen. I‚Äôve personally used it on the exams computers as well.
---
Archer, athlete and hunter are pretty much the only three that anyone seems to be able to do
---
Yeah. Regardless, I'd hold off on letting the mules feed the scrap machine until its confirmed one way or the other.
---
Though they already changed the mob spawns to a 15 minute cooldown a couple patches ago. People were complaining it killed the farming out at the whitesprings.
---
Have they said something about it?
---
Mammalogist
---
Tell me about it. I moved 20+ nukashine the first day. Can't keep up with demand.
---
Make it so each hit plays a note and when you get enough notes you and your team get a buff
---
It sounds kind of ridiculous but I have a bloodied explosive handmade and an anti armor explosive handmade and have had offers up to 75,000 caps on them. Not sure why someone would want to spend that much, but I have had several offers like that.. havent sold because I use one daily and the other on pvp but I just thought that price was crazy
---
I'm at level 88. I did everything already, except the latest part of the main quest, and i already find no point to continue to play after this.
---
I was expecting much more...and also, bigger challenges. In 1 month i did everything SOLO. The game is too casual oriented. I am disappointed, but at least the adventure was fun in many ways.
---
I saw every miner called scorched commander at the uranium event lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Wait it needs to be powered to show your camp on map?! Fucking shit why there isn't a simple quide for us idiots to tell these things? English is my third language so I am not good at it. I don't  know every second word that comes up. I was wondering why no one ever came to look my nice camp.
---
I'm pretty sure I've found this as well, but it was a little while ago (2 weeks, mayhap?), and I think I found it in a different location. 
---
Either that, or I've just read about it at some point.
---
I'd like to see the new Sheepsquatch weapons added to the loot tables, as well at the pipe revolver.
---
Legendary scout armor would be a really nice addition.  I've got a dense torso mod for the scout armor sitting in my stash, just in case.
---
Do you know where you got that number?
---
the only reason it says Scope is because thats the placeholder name for that slot on the weapon.
---
KillaGorrella. I‚Äôll be on in an hour or so. Leeeeggggeeeettttitttt
---
I‚Äôve had a few of the better ones go for $100‚Äôcaps.  Getting ready to lower mine to $75 to see if they move faster.  Had a guy buy out my buddies magazines at 50 caps each.  That surprised me
---
Each machine has a set number of slots. So people who want to sell more, need more machines and power. I guess its some kind of balancing / performance / anti-duper system
---
Haha... Just found him yesterday, but have karma anyway for being a stand up guy.
---
My thoughts: DPS is the exact same between explosive and faster fire rate. Explosive is arguably better as higher damage means less loss to armor. However, faster fire rate is arguably better for PVP as explosive can be almost negated with fireproof perk and dense armor mod.
---
It‚Äôs actually a lot of more-or-less separate content, and it‚Äôs all pretty well done. Obviously there‚Äôs still quite a few things that need to be fixed in the game, but overall they‚Äôve made enormous strides in improving the quality of the game. In my humble opinion, it‚Äôs more than enough to bring a vault dweller back into Appalachia!
---
And thus, Captain America was born.
---
Seriously? That's unfortunate because most of the time no one is there
---
10-20k based on how much they want it
---
Do you sell serums?
---
First of all, there are 2 in the room. You can also find computers at Camp Adams. Second, if i hear someone calling me names and throwing explosives for this then you'll be damn sure he's not getting on that computer.
---
I used the greek letters.
---
How much do you sell your serums for?
---
How difficult is it to repair an item? Seems harder to damage the item enough than it is to repair it
---
Nah PS4.
---
I just do runs at westek for the level up challenge. 1 3star  happens at least once a day. Or urianium fever event. That alone will drain the machine.
---
I think if someone is already on a terminal, if someone else use it, they'll just use their pipboy for it
---
Yeah, i figured. Only on consoles those guns are so cheap ....
---
That...is actually all I needed to know. Thank you!
---
Yea :\\ 
---
Fix It Good no longer improves DR like it used to.  
---
Interestingly, my chest armor which has just a little bit of &gt;100% left, has **1**DR more than it does normally. So it's not like the feature in the game was removed, it's just as stated: The perk is broken. Shame.
---
(And for giggles, I tried Weapon Artisan on my Power Fist, which did not yield superior damage after being repaired. So *that* is fixed as intended, but they broke armor repairing in the process. GG lol)
---
I think it depends on what you‚Äôre playing on. At least on PS4 they have to be on your friends list to be able to join the server they are on, but as long as they don‚Äôt get booted as well, you can rejoin through them. Done so a few times, even if I‚Äôm not joining their team I try to join friend‚Äôs servers for this exact reason.
---
obviously there was issued but we had crazy marsupial amd other fun bugs.
---
i dont think its overseer. there is a vault 51 overseer in the files so that cant be it
---
At first it was based off how FO4 worked. I did some testing of my own, a body shot verses a head shot and measured the pixels. The headshot indeed seemed to be double the damage. I have a picture of the comparison on my PC. I can post it if you wish to see it when I get home.
---
Judging by my experience, nope
---
The developers wrote that they had to disable it temporary. Hopefully they will enable again soon. It was nice.
---
How much do you sell serums for?
---
A man with 20 fingers...... Kinda sounds fun üôÑ
---
Too bad there‚Äôs no hot chocolate in game. Make sure you have green thumb. It‚Äôll really help out for  soups.
---
for the time being, yes. at least until they "fix" (nerf) lasers. although ultracite ones usually go for lower because they're downright broken.
---
id assume they set that price to show off an item
---
Console gamer though. PSN doesnt have any way to adjust others mic volume other then turning your headset volume down itself.
---
Ahh thanks for the knowledge all. Will give it a shot
---
There might only be a couple plans from the campfire event, but there's way more than 2 plans associated with this DLC. The event at Dolly Sods has a chance for several different mounted heads, and I got a pioneer scout bowie knife skin from the "clean up the goo" quest.
---
It makes sense to spread them out over the 3 repeatable events so that people have a reason to run them every day. For that matter, I don't think it's possible for anyone to have even played the 2 dailies more than twice, so without dataming it's entirely possible that we don't have a full list of what's out there.
---
Here I am with my machine glitched at 288. I'm unable to turn in any more legendary items
---
I have found, and it may be related, that I have to remove some in the order in which I laid them down. So if I lay a square like:
---
32
---
41
---
I can't remove floor tile 3, even though 4 is connected to 1 and therefore still accessible, without first removing 4.
---
I'm gonna be honest with you if you quit because the carry weight bug you will be disappointed because there are no bugs that benefit you anymore.
---
I'm going to have to find the list of "failed games" that put Fallout 76 as a worse launch than Star Citizen.
---
Yes, Star Citizen, the game that has crowdfunded over $250 million from players--the #1 crowdfunded project of all time, in fact--and *does not yet exist*, and *may never exist*.  A game whose single player version was supposed to launch in *2014* and still doesn't have a release date.  A project so nakedly, greedily pay-to-win that their backers are selling starships (for, remember, a non-existent game) for upwards of $4,000 apiece, and on top of that selling in-game currency--again, potentially years before the game launches!  All made by company so obsessed with money they planned to charge fans $20 to *watch their convention stream online*.
---
THAT is the game that this "journo" thought had a BETTER launch than Fallout 76.  At this point you just have to throw up your hands and say, this is not a level playing field any more.
---
Yeah I'd use it more if it had some decent optics at least. Its great for low level enemies and there is ammo laying around all over.
---
I had a similar issue, I bought a suppressor's explosive minigun and it showed up on the top of my list renamed to "*PA, T-60". I got worried for a second but my t60 is also intact and nothing got lost
---
If there is a will there is a way. Honestly 25k for a be handmade is cheap. You typically can't buy them for caps at all.
---
hey guys it's trader99 here, I got this ultra-rare amazing thingy, only 100k caps!
---
&gt; they wana promote trading 
---
...caps cap... does not compute
---
and while I'm at it: \*wanna
---
Please, if you're worried about the cap, sell the stuff at your merchant. I'm still bouncing around looking for neat weapons.
---
I completed the archer athlete and swimmer.
---
The MG42 could use some mods too.  All there is for it is the Prime Receiver.
---
"I AM THE GRIND MASTER!"
---
Good for you, i guess ... i found the challenges a bit much, and with the herpotologist message glitched I'd go so fast as ro say tedious ... it was a sense of video game accomplishment i guess, not quite my first queen fight or that time I killed 11 super mutants while level 30 with a vanilla sniper rifle while overencumbered, but ... meh.
---
Just another asshole wanting to feel special.
---
Aw poo
---
Or it's a mule set up to sell just the handmade and has no caps at all.
---
I saw a couple near the lumber mill . They were shown as enemies . There was also a cat called "House Cat".
---
...I wanna buy a weapon, yeah, and some ammo too. Alright, now give me all your money!
---
Possibly, I'm going to try &amp; get it later today if it's still there, the seller is always on so I'll message him later &amp; see if we can come to a deal
---
Caps don‚Äôt grow on trees
---
It's happening to everyone, just enjoy I guess.
---
Stupid dupers. Ruining the fun for everybody. First they caused the TSE nerf, then the shotgun nerf. Next is gonna be AA and bloodied. I just know it.
---
It doesn't bother me, but I must admit I have no idea what the point of it is... is it supposed to be encouraging us to continue to trade face-to-face?
---
I‚Äôd imagine that this isn‚Äôt meant to replace farming for good legendaries, just supplement it, so while you can still get bad rolls even on a 3* it‚Äôs still better than just farming. If we could get a buff to legendary drops that would be great too, like maybe spawning more 2* or 3* enemies or tuning which legendary effects can drop on each weapon.
---
Was this person located in the Mire because I‚Äôm pretty sure I grabbed one from them as well. Thank you good sir!
---
You sure its not because you hit the daily 150 max?
---
Decks decks decks
---
Just a guess, but the reason they are unlocked is simply because the owner of the camp is happy for others to take stuff from it.
---
But that could just be the way I do things. If I have a resource on my camp I never lock them. Even extractors if I have one. Players are welcome to take some, theres always enough to go round.
---
man, i hope they don't fix this lol
---
I was having this problem earlier, I actually just unequipped and re equipped the camera from my PipBoy and then my photos were registering for the challenges!
---
Take it!
---
Plz dont hate me for asking but Wyatt does rng staffs for I'm not the best with the acronyms
---
Hmm. Tried 3 different Yao Guai. Maybe if they are a variant "glowing, diseased, etc" it doesn't count.
---
I know the modern standards of gaming journalism are abysmally low, but that is beyond stupid. Anybody with a week's worth of experience in an online game's economy will know that cap sinks are absolutely required to prevent the issue we already had of stagnancy. The duping brought it about much faster, I bet Bethesda was expecting they could bring out player vending before it became an issue. 10% isn't even a lot, people are buying 3* god tiers left and right
---
Interesting
---
Happy to help, it's super annoying because most of the bugs I've been able to directly isolate and identify a fix (see arms with the muffled mod, which is only for the legs)...
---
Stands not staff ugh spellcheck
---
No it isn‚Äôt, these are my genuine feelings. I love this game and this franchise, that‚Äôs why I criticize it.
---
...you'll probably need to level up your alts to 50
---
Sweet gods of firearms that‚Äôs awesome.
---
exactly. if you're impatient, i will go AFK on that computer out of spite
---
I usually loose a few but I have an auto so I tend to waste an extra bullet trying to shoot one round but failing
---
Wth
---
This is actually really easy to complete if you do the campfire tales event. Assuming you get the bug version of it and not the wendigo version. Just do the event, grab a little bit of everything from all the bugs (just to be sure, of course) then head to Dolly Sods. It makes this daily insanely easy. Plus, hooray efficiency!
---
Uhhhh..... Yeah, I'll be right back.
---
Mabey they count for the read magazines challenges?
---
From the screen shot, it doesnt look like bloodied and a few other types of legendary effects will be available.
---
I once bumped into the amalgamation of a Super Mutant-Sentry Bot that made whirring sounds, charged, and exploded on death.
---
Depends on platform (PC, etc) but the lasers have sold for 15 - 50k'ish range,'I'd guess you sit squarely in the middle
---
Those are the ones! I only need one more level to fully rank that perk and I‚Äôm so hoping I can tame on of those guys!
---
A bunch of cats spawn two feet from my camp. My turrets don't like them so I eat a lot of cat.
---
Those was hard times
---
Find a huge group doing one that can handle most of the fighting and come prepared with at LEAST 100 Rad Away and a shitload of Rad-X and then hang around in the back picking away at it with a rifle and run like hell from the smaller creatures
---
Your camp is at the pond right by mine, I think. üòä
---
Ditto. Tedious, but doable.
---
yes, there are several. black, tabby, "house". they usually spawn as enemies and will flee on sight, but I had this weird encounter near Gauley Mine where a group spawned and was heading straight towards the Scorched.
---
so I quickly dispatched them (the Scorched, not the cats). when I got back to make sure they were fine, they weren't aggressive or fleeing anymore. could be a bug, I don't know. but it was cute.
---
apparently cats are the only thing able to survive nuclear apocalypse.
---
I have been putting the ones I make in my vending machine for 350. Allows for personal use or resale to vendor for a profit.
---
As in they break faster?
---
you should commit seppuka and restore you families honor cause you're a cheater!!!!
---
it's a bug and will prolly be fixed shortly .. nothing you can do really .. except sell that legendary for phat lewtz!!
---
people actually pay 50k for a gun
---
Just shoot them a message. I had semien fast travelm backhome. I felt bad because they didnt have what I wanted but most people can just pop back.
---
people shocked that they fixed a bug that broke the game seriously confuse me. like. it wasn't an intended gameplay feature. why would you expect to keep using it?
---
Who cares? The daily cap is your real limiting factor.
---
That's a good idea.  It would also be nice if they could get some mods.  At least one option for each.
---
Bethesda coukd take a page from gw2 storage. Stash has 2 tabs, one for everything and the other fir junk. Junk would have a fixed number of each component. 
---
And like gw2, Bethesda could sell increases to junk storage in atomic shop.
---
r/fo76guides may come in handy.  
---
They would be. üòÑ
---
Cap tax is probably to help bethedsa pay the lawyers in their plagiarism law suit lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This is one of the reasons I lost interest in the game. It's far too clumsy trying to manage builds. It feels like a game from 15 years ago in this aspect.
---
That goes both ways. The amount of builders I‚Äôve worked with that I had to explain basic reasons for why things needed to be placed in certain spots is bewildering.  No, the shower head should not be right next to the wall, it needs it be placed so a human can stand under it.
---
let me guess: bright neon signs above them?
---
Thank You for the source. I appreciate it.
---
Udderly ridiculous
---
Thank you very much. Now I know which ones to focus my efforts on.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again - 1000 is the "sweet spot". 800 is enough but I want space for items I will want to try later...
---
You literally just described Minecraft
---
I got the firefly and the bloatfly head so far.
---
Ah shoot. Well I‚Äôll add ya and maybe another time. I‚Äôm Mysticalvisions on PS4
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt consider that.  I seemed to hoard them all this time.  Now I‚Äôll sell them!
---
The greek letters, vertically, on the lockers.
---
For Legacy items or "perfect" rolls that aren't duped, either in caps or trade, yes..  
---
I've seen Bloodied Explosive perfect rolls trade for a couple / few pieces of Unyielding/Cav... Which is usually in the 25k'ish range as I understand it
---
People are going to flip tf out when the steam version is released, and they find out it's not actually made of steam.

Where are you located on the map? I can't fast travel, and seeing if you're close

Random-Number-Generator

Basically, anything that happens in a game is based on a random number usually. First it could roll 1 is ranged, 2 is melee, 3 is armor, and then again 1-3 for stars, and again 1-X for whatever type of item it is, and then like finally each legendary 1-X where 1 is furious, 2 is bloodied, 3 is stalker's, 4 is mutants, etc.
---
Could just use a couple of pressure plates with far too many connectors on either side. That's what I did. The doors auto-close after you aren't stood on them
---
Yeah that makes sense, thanks!
---
Only pulls the Stimpacks,'never got it to work with diluted
---
Had that happen a few times. When I store the object/floor it was placed on, I can find it back in my inventory again. But if I set it on the ground and it disappears, then it's gone forever until I move my camp... and that's a pain in the ass when you've built around the terrain and can't easily place blueprints. So I've learned to keep my turrets on top of objects or flooring at all times. 
---
*long sigh*
---
My dream item is a black powder weapon with bloodied explosive and faster reload i know they probably don't work together but that's what it is second will probably be a bloodied mole miner gauntlet 90% less carry weight faster swing speed once again ik it probably don't work like that but still lol
---
oh i just don‚Äôt see the point in using s mule character to pay for a gun it is so easy to get scammed out of that
---
What cosmetic and what armor?
---
ooo that sounds way better looking.
---
i uh, gotta go redecorate my shop. for. reasons.
---
That's reddit for you. Bunch of Scorched around here. "Hive Mind" don't question things so on and so forth God forbid you express independent thought or ask for sources.

the damage for me went from 20 to 2.. not sure how the characters with more then -7 str were effected.

---
Sort of.  It sort of slowly lights up and dims back down in a cyclic fashion.  It doesn't really provide any noticeable illumination, in case you were looking to make some variety of extra-creepy room filled with dead fireflies.
---
You can find Squirrels and chickens at Wixom Homestead in the field and rabbit by the pond near Gilman Lumber Mill at least on Xb1.
---
Aww, I'm sorry. I ran across a pet deathclaw in someone's camp yesterday and took the opportunity to take an excellent selfie. Pet deathclaws are the best!
---
Yup especially archer
---
What are you talking about?
---
The list on the left is just "Stuff this player has" not a list of everything available.
---
BUT because I've never seen a scout piece ever, the fact that there IS one in the menu, implies it's added to the things you can get.
---
Just because things aren't in the screenshot list doesn't mean they aren't won't be attainable.
---
Tyler county Fairgrounds.
---
Before this patch one could take drills/chainsaws and increase the damage alot if repaired passed 100% durability.
---
Ya. It's been like that since launch.
---
You have to get a little creative with those sometimes though. No way to spell ‚ÄòAID‚Äô so I spelled ‚ÄòKEMZ‚Äô. Haha.
---
Generally, especially the people on the trading discords/Reddit's will only do trades of that scale with people who already have established reputations, scamming someone would destroy that rep, making it harder and harder to keep trading..  
---
In short not worth it
---
Yes you can...and shoot through them: that's how I plunk mole rats in my crops!
---
Just bought the brink set
---
What‚Äôs the Gamertag, I‚Äôd like to browse his shop?
---
Have you stockpiled serums? If so, how long? Also, has your trading sales increased since player vending?
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good catch. As someone who rocks a full ultra-light polymer urban scout set under my PA (for when those mole rats sneak up on me when I'm crafting). This is awesome. I love the scout gear. Thanks OP.
---
no. ultracite lasers have lower damage, faster fire rate and a green laser compared to regular ones. except they use the same mods from regular lasers, so when you attach one, you're essentially turning your ultracite laser into a regular one. even the projectile turns red.
---
if memory serves, some mods will also downright break the gun, as in it'll deal no damage. at least explosive ones.
---
PS4 and I play with a few friends
---
I'm not the only one who enjoys killing things slowly :D
---
I put mine up for the default of 100 and have no issue moving them.
---
Over repair was broken in the patch and has been added to the known issues list (so not really a nerf, since it's a bug).  This is true for both armor and weapons.
---
Ahh... Thank you for that. Of course my work ramps up right when I want to melt a day in the wasteland. How many slots are in the machine and, is there a limit to how much of 1 type of you can load in, like say if I have 100 bulk steel?
---
I think medic pump at least world with diluted just based on me getting the "stimpak diluted has worn off" in the middle of a battle.
---
I'm really not sure though, hence the question.
---
Or items you could place or you could give pictures to your friends ... or even your enemies ...
---
But I love it when I have 3 characters on 3 different servers and the people in two of the three think I'm crazy as I carry on a conversation they can't see or hear.. ;)
---
Did you already try restarting your game?
---
It certainly helps.  I've had the quest go a few different ways (bring a rapid fire gun and aoe options if the campfire is going to go out) and sometimes you miss out on stingwings.  Good one-stop shopping for bloatflies, ticks, radroaches and bloodbugs, for sure.
---
But i have a fusion generator. Those things run for hundreds of years.
---
Ah thought the math might be wrong. Still, the redux doesn't seem to be working right. Thanks for the information though!
---
I think it pulls normal stimpacks first and will only pull diluted or super ones if they are all you have left. Not sure what preference it has between diluted and super in that situation.
---
Ill be on around 8ish
---
Happy cake day!
---
Crazy, will have to try that or
---
üí¨
---
I tried to find super mutants. They seemed to give a lot of XP per kill. Also you could find vertibots and destroy them. Level 10-25 seemed like a little bit of a grind to me. After that it goes pretty smooth
---
Oh thanks I didn‚Äôt even notice lol. I only get on here once in a blue moon
---
my generator is on the second floor surrounded by brick walls with a keypad-ed entrance, so if power goes down all hope is lost
---
Honestly one of the things I love about 76 is how much communication we get, sure it's not perfect, there's the odd stealth nerf/change. But on the whole we get so much more engagement from the devs and community managers on reddit than most other games.
---
When you select the vending device to build it, it kinda clearly shows it requires 3 energy. I suppose if you haven't build much of energy requing things into your camp, then you woudn't know what the symbol meanns.
---
That would make sense since they‚Äôve been putting so much effort into balancing weapons.
---
It's been bad for me for a while. I've actually had decent luck farming the burrows, when there's actually stars there.
---
I would love to play as a Ghoul, even if it is just a player skin in the Atomic Shop.  The option to be a Glowing Ghoul like that guy from Nuka World would be cool too.
---
I particularly want to look like a Scorched.  I really like how they look.  My role play reason is that my character contracted the plague but got vaccinated before he fully conformed to the Hive Mind.  All the damage is done but he retains some semblance of his humanity.  And on occasion, he hears the Hive Mind speak to him.
---
Mine too, it‚Äôs called Fort Filthy and it can probably be seen from space lol! I need to find a kind soul in here to take and upload some pictures of it, I‚Äôd love to get some feedback on it.
---
Who is dolly and where can I find her? Is it part of the pioneer scouts quests?
---
I need a picture of a cat. Where is this located exactly
---
Like I said in the post, I wouldn't care much if I could find a single other shred of anybody else talking about it. I've seen plenty of bugs with other stuff not being assigned properly in the game, right now I'm holding on to a serrated bowie knife and the "no upgrade" invisible combat knife as well, but I've seen plenty of people mention both of those
---
I‚Äôve done this too. Dude built his house in a cave. Hello darkness my old friend.
---
Adding now
---
I always kill bounties ... one for the challenge of hunting man ... the other to get that stupid 5-10 caps off someone's head ... i usually sneak up, snipe the snipe, and leave ... hahaha and you're welcome all in one.
---
This is why I use campfires
---
will do any specific area were I can server hop and find a lot of them?
---
Tyler county Fairgrounds
---
You'll find you're on reserve power next time you check to see that there is no fusion core in it! Muhahaha!
---
I could see that being the design intent. If for nothing else, to present a choice
---
People who don‚Äôt grind for materials for crafting might be skipping workshops.  I only cap them when I need 1 or two different materials.
---
Nope. In fact I've had two pretty good runs.
---
I built it too but nothing now I can‚Äôt get backpack without doing another badge where r u @Bethesda
---
If you want to do it again and kill them you can try and gather a team. Some of us would be glad to help you. I hear you though, the imposter is a high level event. I can‚Äôt solo it unless I nuke her.
---
oops my bad i misread that as "scouts armor" like tadpole scouts or whatever they are called :P
---
400 gang
---
joke's on you, my camp is a public rest stop, i WANT you to take my water and corn!
---
rng=random, particularly referring to random roll.
---
99.9% of the time I come back to my camp and every single door is wide open, even the prison door that serves to protect the unfurnished generator room.  You can see what's inside, which is a fusion generator and a conduit poking through the wall.  Why open the door at all, and then leave it open?  Were you expecting my secret treasure to be there?
---
The rad shower is also usually left on.  Good thing the stove can't burn the house down, or I'd likely have to spend half my gaming putting out house fires.  Who'd expect a bunch of gamers to be such slobs?  LOL
---
Still better than my stalkers‚Äô rolling pins with faster reload ü§Æ
---
&gt;Or atleast scale with our level with 50 being the Max.
---
Of course they will scale.
---
Stick your edit AT THE BEGINNING OF THE POST.
---
Good call, I only had to shoot mine maybe 5 or 6 times thanks to getting kinda lucky with the sliver of health I'd left it.  I'll add your suggestion to my op tho :)
---
Same here OUCH
---
Huh
---
Thank you all! I finally found it :) i must have looked at it a hundred times.
---
Can you get more than 1 badge per day? I just did this event twice, but got a badge only the first time.
---
but you expect to shoot through there's no glass but you don't expect to walks through the wood
---
Saw a guy selling em for 200 yesterday
---
I think you can earn then by doing the campfire takes event but it's a rare chance
---
You can't see legendary effects in player vending.
---
This is a good idea.
---
I mean, I don't disagree. some parts of the game require a party for better or worse. and farming is hell. but you *can* be successful solo, all you gotta do is play smart.
---
you can have an AR PA or VATS build and absolutely wreck everything with 1\* bloodied weapons or even regular ones. if they go and nerf the AR/bloodied mechanic though, then we'll have a problem.
---
Oh ya known bug some of them you can some you cant
---
Well silver is deadly for werewolves not vampires hahaha
---
I've got a couple heavy laser turrets around my house. I'm south of the Top of the World so enemy's can spawn at they max level. They make short work of low to mid level enemies, but only really serve as an alarm for the higher level enemies.
---
Take your time, explore, have fun. Game is what you make it.
---
Otherwise I have found leveling up alts that no matter what type of guns you want to use in endgame a solid melee weapon will probably be a good primary weapon to level with early on. Especially if your ammo poor.
---
Events are good to do for xp and rewards like stimpacks, purified water.
---
When sleeping for xp bonus alway try to sleep in an elevated bed to reduce disease chance.
---
For your camp put down a water pump so you can always cook boiled water. Also put tatos, corn, and mutifruit down so you can make vegetable starch that breaks down to adhesive. Think it takes two of each veg to make if i remember correctly.
---
If you find yourself rrunning out of space in inventory or stash, make sure you have scrapped you junk to base materials.
---
Always read plans and recipes in the notes tab of your inventory.
---
Also, keep an eye out to what enemies you are fighting. For example if you have been smaking ghouls around easy be prepared for more a shock the first time you run into say a pack of super mutants.
---
A mic is not necessary to play, especially when starting out. That said a mic def makes life easier when in parties.
---
As for combat, i would suggest you flow into your own style from experiences dying and winning the day. I can share some of my tips though if you need.
---
Well, then people will just use it to store all their non-god roll heavy weapons for no cost. And if someone buys my crappy 2* Gatling gun for 25k, that‚Äôs cool too.
---
They‚Äôd have to come up with a way to make it so people can‚Äôt just exploit it for free carry weight.
---
build a fertalizer producer in your camp. it's just some steel and raorgrain. makes a wheelbarrow full of food, and it comes with a free brahmin.
---
so, the "fertalizer producer" is also a milk producer.
---
You can jump right through them. No biggie...my door is always open
---
It will probably be fixed in the next update. For now you have to wait until the owner shows up, which might be never
---
It seems as if reddit has more of an influence than the tickets do, unfortunately.
---
Idk how high the levels will spawn but west tek has like 45 mutants everytime!
---
The seller has to be there for it to work.
---
Please please please allow the purveyor to add legendary effects to thing we give her.
---
Exactly üòÇ  I never sit at my camp
---
So what you are saying is I should fill my vending machine with level 5 pipe weapons and wood armor to get you to walk into my trap.
---
Strange, I actually was playing around my combat metal and leather armors today and they don‚Äôt show over clothing at all
---
Happy to help! I had to knock its health down to almost nothing and then still had to shoot it a handful of times before it died. It got a little intense for a second, that's for sure!
---
This all falls under general help i guess so here goes ....
---
food water - try gettin herbivore mutation down the road .. corn soup silva homestead mid-left side of map gather corn/razorgrain/concrete go to the river to it's west and use the cookin pot to make corn soup and razorgrain flour
---
think about mutations in the future too they really help but perks for them don't show up till after level 30 or so I believe 
---
VATS is easiest to build for as sneak is kinda .. sometimes only at a smaller portion of combat where VATS is all through the entire fight
---
top left of the map aaronholt homestead easy crannberry farm for extra xp
---
pleasant valley cabins easy plan/recipe farm
---
store lead/steel/plastic/ballistic/leather etc whichever you need to repair the type of weapon/armor you use in stash SELL THE REST or keep like 50-100 of other non essential resources .. don't waste the space
---
scrap everything that is scrappable until you get all the mods and the phat lewtz you can .. prolly early level take scrapper perk in INT for couple extra resources
---
make a lot of molotov cocktails .. you're gonna find yourself in areas with high level critters more often then not, follow the higher levels around and splash everything they shoot at with molotovs .. you'll get xp and loot rights without all the pain and suffering
---
sneak up to people and whisper over chat .. you smeeellll niiiiice .. reasons
---
avoid shotguns/automatic/energy weapons lower levels .. melee is good but chances are your first epic legendary is gonna be a pistol or rifle plus the ammo is hella cheaper
---
invest in fix it good/weapon artisan and ignore the reduce wear and tear perks, like gunsmith or white knight and instead focus on either sneak or VATS crits or str8 up damage
---
DO NOT INVEST IN A HYBRID its a total waste .. focus on ONE weapons type and stick with it .. think about it, if your swinging a melee weapon what use in that battle does perks in rifle or pistols serve rather than extra sneak damage or better crit damage ..
---
chems are awesome chems are great alcohol is awesome alcohol is great
---
whitesprings golf club waypoint if you get it .. thru the tennis court to a small stone circular structure has a fountain of sulphar water drink it to cure diseases for FREE!!!! ommmmgg!!
---
do leader of the pack, patrol duty, uranium fever, something something night(top right of map you fight a wendigo) free range, the imposter etc quests whenever they pop up for phat lewtz ..
---
theres much more but ill let others chime in good luck in the wastelands
---
I have the same issue, it's why I will never do player vending from my main character. In all the 400 something hours of play I've only not been able to load my camp maybe 4 times.
---
For me, it's a habit from other online open world survival games.  No one else can open your door, so it's a bit of a stop-gap from allowing other players free access to all your storage containers.  Of course they just destroy your place anyways, but it keeps players honest on private servers.
---
I agree with your point, but I‚Äôd just like to point out that selling chems made from plants and/or trees is quite lucrative. Everybody needs disease cures.
---
Bloodied is already countered by Executioners so I don't see the point of nerfing it when theres already a legendary that exists specifically for that purpose
---
how do you down? it keeps insta killing lol
---
You can get the possum tokens from the campfire tales event, but I believe the tadpole ones are exclusive to challenges. There are exactly 10 challenges, and everything from the tadpole store requires a total of 10 tokens
---
Officers, he's right over here.
---
A lot of the time the third effect is crappy but for guns at least you could get vats or reload speed which is good
---
The prison "Eastern Regional Penitentiary" which is a few clicks north east of Vault 76 has dozens of super muties. I remember grinding a few levels out there. There's also some events that spawns a legendary sometimes.
---
400
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs only rodents and insects. I‚Äôve done it twice and got radroach and bloatfly head plans.
---
The right one star is better than the wrong three star
---
The second star can increase damage with explosive or faster fire rate.
---
The third star is just convenience usually, and never anything to do with damage output. (except strength on a melee)
---
And level, don't forget level.
---
Don‚Äôt bother with vertibots after this latest patch- they nerfed the xp grind using them
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I was going to do just buy a bunch of 2 star ranged weapons
---
I‚Äôve got that for the exit, just in case I hit the ‚Äúall closed‚Äù switch. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the ability to link electronics all over, but they are so high on budget üò≠
---
No......
---
There is another bear spawn in a cave at the southern end of whitesprings - just south of the pond.
---
Yes! Where oh where are they!?
---
I wouldn't bother, especially if you're just starting out. I'm getting only 2\*s myself.
---
Don't see the big deal.  You can make up the tax playing the events, selling junk to vendors etc
---
LOL.  I rebuild and scrap the cow when needed.  It dies instantly from players and enemies alike.  Sometimes players accidentally kill it with Plague Walker or Tesla Coiled power armor.
---
Keep 4 razorgrain plants (or two and use Green Thumb) and just rebuild as needed.  It sucks up sooo much camp budget that I don't find it worth keeping full time.  If I want some milk, I just port over to Flatwoods.
---
grab a ton of molotovs and head to whitesprings usually at least a few players farming that place .. just toss tag and loot easy peasy
---
Agreed it also gives more of a survival feeling in my opinion.
---
yeah i killed that one with the shotgun but figured maybe a lower lvl one would be easier thus the graveyard :P  
---
As an aside the whole "whittle down with another weapon then use the one it calls for" works for everything.  My rifleman build sucks with a shotgun so I got the dolly sods one down to like 5% health then broke out a shotgun and got credit for it.
---
Hahaha.  Bet you the level is random.
---
Wait till you get your 3 star level 5 wooden leg.
---
I've got my bloody build completely tweaked, and with 1 point in Born Survivor I'm basically unkillable unless I get stomped by a Yao Guai twice in less than 20 seconds. I'm not sure how the math works on stacking resistances, but I've got Dodgy 3 eliminating 30% of all damage, Blocker 3 mitigating 45% of all melee damage, and Serendipity 3 for a 45% to completely avoid all damage.
---
Here's my bloodied shotgun build. If I want to run melee I swap out the shotgun perks for slugger, martial artist and incisor, and then drop enforcer in favor of a level 4 adrenaline card.
---

---
I‚Äôm not even in an area that should make sense for vending, but it must be popular for a reason I‚Äôm overlooking. But seriously, I do not want to spawn in a world my camp can‚Äôt spawn.
---
Oh thats great to know!
---
My game crashed while I was checking out other camps. Someone was in mine at the time. I hope they didn't get hurt.
---
What was it?
---
Level is the highest for the set without exceeding the mob's level. Or in this case probably just player level since it's a vendor
---
So either 5-15-25-35-45   or 1-10-20-30-40-50
---
no prob !
---
A link to a post or something saying this somewhere?
---
Yeah, but a lot of them require you to have items (frog containment jar or a frog) or recipes (s‚Äômores) that I have no idea how to get
---
Who wants low level legendaries?
---
I've heard that the stream to the side of the whitespring clubhouse works. When you die in the stream, it is shallow so you would be kneeling  in the water and easy to revive.
---
They addressed something to this effect in today's from the vault article. That is assuming displaying things will include displaying weapons as well.
---
You've already received the injections, they take a while to come into effect.  The first signs will probably be a loss of libido.
---
The first owlet I saw was when I got the plan for a mounted owlet..and I was like wtf is this thing
---
What's that location named?
---
I actually did catch some guy in power armor with a hammer fighting off a bunch of super mutants he spawned on my house today.  I got on area chat, said thanks and dropped him a baggie of various meats (I'm a wasteland vegan) and extra aluminum, rubber, plastic and steel.  He also bought a 3\* buzz blade I was selling, which was cool.
---
Getting a lot more stuttering and "lost connection to server" in the past few days. I wouldn't necessarily attribute that to anything more than an influx of players coming back and lots of server transactions happening quickly
---
That's what I did for both of these seeing as I have never come across a decent legendary shotgun in over 200 hours. Instead I crafted max lvl double barrel, let my Action Hero do the heavy (Ha! Pun!) lifting, and finished it off with the double barrel.
---
Hahaha.  Soooo true.
---
The Bowie knife and cultist blade both suffer from a missing MA keyword, preventing the mods from being attached, but they rarely spawn with them...     
---
Been reported since B.E.T.A. And hope that one is fixed soon.
---
They appear under dailys
---
Yeah, I've been dropped off a cliff or bridge twice today. Crossed my mind that it might be a new form of griefing, but I was in PA both times so no damage done.
---
It felt like journey before ..  mostly solo but you occasionally brush paths with someone else.
---
The hurt person does not need to be in the water but you do. Some random guy I met today and I built a tower next to the river and took turns jumping.
---
Did you leave within 5 mins of activating it? If so,it rolled back. Tbey have a 5 min rollback to combat duping
---
I trust ya, but i'm sure others would like it.  I been targeting heads regardless and its definitely higher damage.   I was just curious if there was an actual data point out in the wild.
---
Far as I know, 1* armor is worth 3 scrip, while 1* weapons are 5.
---
I think they‚Äôre caps-locked.

---
Building mats and ammo aren't exactly expensive. Nor is aid.
---
The event is chaos and definitely not intended to solo at lvl 30 (not in general tbh, though there are those who indeed can solo it).  As far as the gear and decorations go, those come more with time and exploration than by doing things like soloing the hardest content etc.  Some things only drop from events (and it's easy enough to see those on your map and join if there are already people there so you won't struggle with anything alone, though nothing wrong with trying them solo either =).  I have most of the CAMP decorations and most armor/weapon plans based on playing solo casually since the beta (I have definitely out in a good amount of time exploring etc, but I am not someone who solos the Encryptid event either =).
---
Same here. Just sucks when you spend half an hour fast traveling to see poorly built camps and/or nothing worthwhile sold. Who puts normal guns (i.e. a lvl 30 hunting rifle) for sale? Lol
---
I'd love to see a mole miner or scorched or mongrel dog shouting as they attacked: "Does somebody need their ass kicked?!"
---
You get the recipe from the event at Camp Adams, I got it tonight.
---
Thanks! And slick is an understatement, goddamn
---
Yeah I've seen it too.
---
And all the way back from the behind the scenes video they did, it really feels like something the devs WANT to do and want to try, not because they feel they have to. The devs give a shit.
---
My suggestion to you regarding the Cryptid event is wait for it to pop up while your just doing your thing in the game, fast travel to it, shoot it one time to tag it and get the loot and then let the other high level players do the work. This may seem cheap but at level 30 it's best to do this to get the rewards.
---
As for the rest of the game, take it at your own pace, enjoy it. There really is no rush. Everything will be there when you are ready for it. I've been playing since the Fasnacht Parade which came out March 19. I started up a new character that weekend it was released because I hadn't played since the beta. So I started fresh and now as of May 9th I am level 72. I do not play everyday either,  I almost never play Mondays or Tuesdays.
---
Keep an eye out on news of Bethesda regarding a Double XP weekend as that got me from level 37 to level 60 in just 4 days. That'll level you up quickly. As for getting things like plans you can do two things. One is to unlock the workshops around the map, they grant free plans and in Adventure Mode, most people don't really bother with them. The second thing to do is to buy them, the in game vendors have some somewhat cheap plans but they just recently introduced player vending into the game and that is a great way to get plans for cheap. Go to other players camps and see what plans they have for sale.
---
My last recommendation is pick a weapon class you wanna be good in, this game isn't too viable for a jack of all trades like Fallout 4, New Vegas or 3. I prefer Two Handed Melee weapons.
---
Remember to just take it as you go, this game will be supported for "forever" so you got plenty of time to build your character up.
---
Same. Tactical Red eyes appear white when lit.
---
And they can destroy your camp, because you‚Äôre now hostile.

The Star Citizen defenders are so brainwashed about that game
---
Yeah the items I obtained keep reverting back to their bugged names, might have to try trading them to a friend and back again to see if that helps resolve it.
---
Totally stealing this idea for my store. Gonna make one of my vending machines a tip machine with varying single items for high prices
---
Jump off the new river gorge bridge into the river. Then have someone revive you.
---
Did the update fix kiddie corner for anyone? I still dont list ot as being done on the main scree (3/4) but its checked off on the quest so I cant do it. Wtf? Thought this patch was to fix issues with the update?
---
Bugs the hell out of me lol
---
If you go to lumber mill near Vault 76 and then run North East a very short ways you‚Äôll find a pond with a pier. I had black cats spawn by the pier at that pond.
---
Use your vats button to zoom the lens. Works pretty good!
---
Big Maw
---
Go build one with one of each item and let me know how it works out - guarantee it tanks your frame rate, same as PC.

Wild apalachia trailer video shows a 3-floor place where people are fighting some cryptids, in this particular second [https://youtu.be/CIZ-LGaRB6M](https://youtu.be/CIZ-LGaRB6M) we can see behind the water coming down from the roof of the cave a wall with two borrowed images, those borrowed images are the Arktos Pharma Logo.

=====================================================

!&lt;  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;&gt;!Engineering finalized the blueprints on the centrifuge and trough. Materials are being delivered this month. We expect to have some of the framework built out by the end of the quarter.
---
&gt;&gt;!I thought they were crazy when they proposed an underground biome lab to me, but this thing is truly a marvel of modern engineering. If we pull this off, we can perform all kinds of testing with variables completely controlled. And the fact that it's away from prying eyes - well, that's a nice bonus. !&lt;  
---
&gt; &gt;!Dr. Joseph M. Majzoub =
---
= Log: APBL-AT-003A =
---
&gt;&gt;!We're finally up and running with all systems nominal and the techs are working out some minor bugs with the code. 
---
&gt;&gt;!We're submitting a list of animal test subjects to corporate. Currently awaiting approval but we should be good to go soon. I get most of the animals on this list, but a sloth? The biology team is a weird bunch but I guess everyone plays their part. !&lt;  
---
&gt;  &gt;!Dr. Joseph M. Majzoub =
---
= Log: APBL-AT-004A =
---
&gt;&gt;!The list of animal test subjects have been approved. Subjects are being delivered on a daily basis. For the most part they're acclimating to the habitats we built for them. Except for the sloths, but I could have told them that would happen.
---
&gt;&gt;!We encountered a few issues with the temperature regulator in Habitat B but nothing engineering can't handle. Testing will commence this quarter. We're on track to deliver results that will even blow corporate projections out of the water. !&lt;
---
A lot of notes inside the buildings point that exists a 3 biomes laboratory underground Arktos Pharma.

Bethesda Game Days reveals this:
---
[https://youtu.be/-zIQaXj8h6o](https://youtu.be/-zIQaXj8h6o) until 28:10 they say that Arktos lab is a dungeon. But as we can see on inside the vault it isn't. They keep saying it after 28:10
---
I hope so because currently I have gotten zero emails in relation to any of the tickets I put in, the status of them, about any shipping, etc.
---
They said the info wasn't clear enough on the first five or so that I filed and each was closed due to that.
---
The sixth one was approved and when I checked last month it said it had been closed due to being a duplicate even though it was the only one that had been approved.
---
The seventh that I filed after that one had been closed along with the first five was never responded to.
---
Likewise, my email on file was messed up for months as a ".con" web address instead of ".com".
---
Bethesda probably has the most convoluted customer service of any company I've had to contact and I feel like I'd have a better chance of waiting outside the offices to talk to Todd than to get help through the back-and-forth emails.
---
???
---
also a new duping method got posted on youtube, it got pulled down pretty quick but im sure plenty saw it, so would bet thats also not helping the situation any.
---
But they earned them! hahaha
---
Entitled much?
---
Get on top of the building at the back of it and take the pic aiming down.  That‚Äôs how I got it.
---
For personal use 2* stuff is fine. If your into trading and selling some people will only want 3* even if it‚Äôs a useless stat on the item.
---
The point is to travel around and explore.... like an actual scout lol it forces us to interact and communicate with other players and talk in game. Work together. Use your knowledge and memory of the map to investigate and identify what/where it might be
---
And if you have 4, 120 items to sell.
---
The Devil flashed an emote
---
‚ÄòCause he knew that he'd been beat
---
And he dropped that golden PA
---
In a bag at Hobo‚Äôs feet
---
Hobo said, "Devil, just come on back
---
Once Bethesda releases legendary PA
---
I‚Äôve got the best perk build in whole damn state
---
of West Virgin-i-a
---
You can have 4 with 120 items
---
Christ that's a pretty stupid decision by Bethesda right there
---
That is big facts
---
Hop til you find a bear at site alpha 
---
Have it kill you just at the edge of the water
---
Take workshops. Still killin‚Äô for XP, but you‚Äôll also get more for claiming/defending. Make sure you sleep first for that added XP %.
---
That and they look kinda cluttery. I preferred the smaller ones in the Vault add on for FO4
---
That is every true but if you have 6 with 180 items but who‚Äôs going to realistically need to sell that many
---
It probably does make sense to go for a good 2 star, because you‚Äôll get a lot more chances to get it. Once you have it, then maybe start rolling for a 3 star.
---
Should change this to "the devil has perk cards"
---
Good point, but half the population of 76 (including me) doesn‚Äôt have a mic, and everyone‚Äôs going to use google. Don‚Äôt deny that
---
You can only have 4 max
---
I like where your head is at...
---
Interesting I‚Äôll have to take a look. Have not been on in a few weeks.
---
I remember seeing your post about it some time back. I've found two serrated bowie knives, but still no stealth cultist blade
---
Perk mod is totally perfectly safe to use.
---
Coming
---
IMO Reduced weight perks are worth the 3‚òÜ roll
---
What the hell?
---
When you try it, you will not consider for a moment for not using it.
---
Where is this guy?
---
How is being a d**k better than giving a compliment?
---
Okay I didn‚Äôt test past 3 so I didn‚Äôt know that but thank you fro that info but I was just trying to make a point
---
I have been getting disconnected a lot lately
---
GT check out. I like it.
---
Nah, this one was in the forest. I was just out crossbowing Scorched for my merit badge and bam. Wild fancy store appears.
---
Can not be over encumbered or die from rads.  Lower with rads and toss a grenade works fine.
---
I'm sure that makes sense to you.
---
üòÇ Haha thank you
---
Its okay just letting you know
---
And some people actually need more than 120 because they have plans for days that they need to sell
---
I completed Archer, Mammologist, and Athlete. Finished them super quick.
---
Probably 12 hrs or soüòÅ
---
That's not always the case. I've seen myself and multiple party never CTD at the same time.
---
Your analogy just made this memory even more special
---
Todd Howards itself said that they have to "Build a new Architecture" for the dungeon system, this could totally be as Solo and as Team. I know there is a lot of discussion about to make dungeons soloables but if you think about it this is the first FO multiplayer what is the bad thing about playing with others? I don't get that, but I still understand your position about that and I totally respect it. We will see what Bethesda's answer is.
---
They need to split the categories up.  It's still too random to have a decent chance of getting what you want.  When you select a type of item they need to give you a menu to pick roughly what you are looking for i.e.:
---
You pick ranged weapons and you would get the following options:
---
Pistol(ballistic only)
---
Rifle(ballistic only)
---
Energy(all types of energy weapons would be here for a decent pool size)
---
Heavy(ballistic and energy)
---
This way you get something in the category you are looking for but no guaranty that you get the exact weapon you are looking for.  Same for melee and armor.  This would be a much better way for us to get what we want and would give people much more of a reason to use the service.
---
My how things have changed. Used be 300-400 was a steal and 500 was the average a few months ago.
---
Pretty sure I read it. Have not tried it myself. If so, now they need to fix the crossbow sights..lol
---
Nice try, Raider.
---
Yeah I was talking about him
---
Yep. Good try griefers.
---
You don‚Äôt have to though, I got 3 friends I met online and we play together every session and discover and find everything through exploring. 
---
Half the fun and excitement is figuring it out and having it work. 
---
Imagine how boring the game would be if we just had everything we wanted in an instant. There would be no drive, no purpose. It‚Äôs fun not knowing what to do and then figuring it out together.
---
Just like weapon/armour drops. I‚Äôm lvl 182 and got my first cavalier drop last night. I‚Äôve been around since beta. I‚Äôve had multiple opportunities to buy 3* max lvl sets of unyielding sentinel with every game breaking stat I wanted for real money from duper‚Äôs online. And as nice as it would be. And having all that power in the game to be invincible, I said no, because what purpose would I have if I had everything I wanted. 
---
it‚Äôs fun to earn it.
---
I kinda liked that part, it adds a bit of drama; however, people camping the fast travel spawn points sort of ruins that drama.
---
Who has 16,000 caps...? I can barely float 1300
---
Let‚Äôs do this you do me I do you PSN Datuputi64
---
Xbox?
---
Nope. It's an item they've said they're implementing next week (or the next one).
---
Agreed.  I'm still hoping they'll roll things back, cause their lighting tweaks inadvertently messed up the lighting on a bunch of item models.  Inspect a can of Vegetable Starch, any piece of paper, or heck just the 10mm Ammo Box and you'll see what I mean.  Things didn't always used to look so washed-out.  Here's what standard notes used to look like:
---

New:  [https://imgur.com/a/KVZUVHk](https://imgur.com/a/KVZUVHk)
---
I usually just get them at random usually in containers
---
Haven't seen em either. Do they exist?
---
Great!...what's the standard way to disable ourselves?
---
Mine have been a majority split  containers or mob drops
---
PS4 here and mine is all zeros too. Where the heck do I find my scripts then ?
---
Making this tonight!!!
---
I had to move servers if you're unable to find me!
---
I agree. I think it should be able to know before it logs you in and only log you in if you can place camp..
---
Not a requirement but a definitely big qol fix. I had to try six times and I swear it put me back on the same server more than once after that!
---
Werewolves XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Would be hella cool that when u start u get option to not be a vault dweller but instead start as Ghoul or Super Mutant and in some sorta crazy future maybe Play as Scorched with your very own scorched beast mount (we know this is possible)
---
Falling?
---
Sounds good. My place is right on a cliff
---
Thank You, that makes sense
---
Found the military paint for it at the enclave bunker.
---
Same goes to you, thank you :)
---
Beauty!
---
Still need help with this on PC?
---
It's an Event. Wait for more people to join.
---
Well yeah, of course it‚Äôs fun to earn things. I agree that working for your stuff is better rather than just hopping on a website and paying about 30 bucks for a tse. But, when you‚Äôre totally in the dark about stuff, this just becomes ‚Äúfast travel and hope it‚Äôs there and if it‚Äôs not, server hop.‚Äù That‚Äôs all my opinion, though.
---
I am a huge fan of Bumble Bear.
---
Honestly me too mate
---
It always sounds like they're shouting "WADDAFUG" during Uranium Fever, which sounds like an angry, muffled "What the fuck"
---
So I'm just gonna call Murmgh "Mom"
---
&gt;Mom, can i have this for my birthday
---
&gt;Sure honey
---
&gt;On Birthday, open something with a name that sorta sounds like what i asked for, if you ran it back and forth through google translate a few times
---
Yeah I thought of this exact scenario when I got a random team invite.  Just like before the patch, except now they need an accomplice to be able to destroy my camp.
---
I'm not sure 3 star is worth it given the first 2 effects are really the "bread and butter" that make the item good or not.  AAE, BE, TSE, sent/assassin etc are all 2 star drops and the 3rd effect won't make or break a god roll item.  
---
So personally I plan to buy all 2 stars until I get the items I want, and only then gamble on 3 stars in hopes of getting that perfect upgrade.    
---
You can get five 2\* weapons for the same price as two 3\*.
---
yup, at whitesprings at the moment
---
I play an hour a week since launch, more or less. This is because our daughter was born around launch and I firmly believe in raising her being a doll team effort so not a lot of free time left for games. 
---
I'm level 50 and maybe have finished a third of the quests tops but I still love this game!
---
I only do the sheep event if there are others there. B being a casual,I simply need to rely on others often and I don't mind.
---
I have 2 accounts one is a bunch of low lvl stashes and i do sell with those and not with my main. Sometimes low level can surprise you =)
---
Most definitely
---
If on PC, I can help since i need this achievement too.
---
I bought it from the enclave bunker. I believe it was in the production wing vendor.
---
thats bullshit so we lose defense to carry more how dose that work.
---
Yeah, that confused one of my friends. I asked if he had built a vending machine yet and his answer was that he didn't have the atoms. I had to inform him that was a skin, the base model was free in game.
---
Yes. Please.
---
So say I want a melee hybrid what type of perks do I want(crit damage, sneak damage, etc)
---
How much does 1 weight?
---
I‚Äôm sorry not melee hybrid I meant melee build
---
I might when someone gets banned and there's the slightest indication they had anything to do with it.
---
Like, I know that's unrealistic, but that's out the window if beth just go trigger-happy with it out the blue one day.
---
oh no, I'm sure your video shows a completion.  I just kept failing, and it turned out there was an area I was leaving.
---
It‚Äôs legit a thing
---
Watch out out there. Us adventure players are easy money &amp; junk, lol
---
So once you do 3 tadpole badges you get the plan when you become a possum or when you are a possum you have to do more challenges?
---
Sorry you had to run the gambit of sour posters. 
---
Yeah, it's an ok time to come back. A little more stable, some stuff to do. Focus on the Pioneer quests, the other events are a bit of a ghost town, do them if you can get a group together.
---
I need it to expand my fight club for different match types like my mine field melee
---
I will gladly take your crossbows.
---
Can you not even drop it?
---
Gunpowder would make more sense
---
I get it's a thing in survival but adventure seems kinda silly to do that you don't get as much
---
Nice shop!
---
Thank you! I assume you were just there? Was nice having you!
---
Nope, used to be sit in class with your eyes forward only
---
Also it's not common enough to deny an invite when you have a shop up
---
Just put your junk away not that hard
---
Loooool this just made my day!
---
Yeah but you get -a warning and it just disappears.
---
I havent seen any unobtainable ones
---
I had to finally tell my friend last night to close my doors haha he always leaves them open but I didn‚Äôt want to sound dumb telling him to please shut my doors in the digital realm
---
Oh come on just relax and enjoy what we're given, you're getting these quality updates for free because of people who choose to purchase mtx. Time is money, you think the devs are gonna work on a game if they're losing money over it?
---
No problem, when I have more caps I might revisit to buy some more stuff
---
What kinds of issues? I mean, were talking aboit fallout 76 here, soo
---
You get the standard backpack plans upon finishing the tadpole challenges. Possum challenges are for the mods to put on them and some other plans and outfits. After I get the refrigerator mod I‚Äôm done because this is beyond tedious. But it‚Äôs worth it
---
What have they done to the airport?
---
Cool, you're welcome back any time!
---
yep, only got about 1 or 2 left over
---
Or if you have any camp budget left, people can start placing random shit. Already have had this happen too many times now.
---
PC tag the same name?
---
NOOOOOO üíî
---
Is he always dead now or just when you went
---
I forgot he existed
---
Pretty sure all the Responders Robots carry the same plans- check at Whitesprings
---
yup, indeed
---
Yea I‚Äôm going to smash the badges out tomorrow, thanks btw.
---
I approve of the term "canvas bagged"
---
That‚Äôs exactly what happened to me, I had a lovely spot at whitesprings next to a river that, it had a robot guard too though enemy‚Äôs spawn and attack the robots, which was fine since I could just help whenever I had fast traveled home to find a war in my lawn. But after this update I always come home to find my crops razed, new holes in my walls, and even my generator on the second floor destroyed somehow, I‚Äôve even witnessed scorched and dogs sprint from another players camp in whitesprings and run past me straight to my Brahmin to start killing it, so eventually I just moved to a nice spot in the mire
---
Survival lead me to store aid and next thing I knew I was at Max..
---
I had a non-legendary serrated cultist blade..
---
I had the same issue, so I just bought the plans from the free state vendor for like 200 caps.
---
I know bro, I think they should have had an initial quest to help everyone get the first backpack, then after that, leave it how it is to get mods and upgrades and badges
---
If 800 isnt enough you either horde too many items, overstock your vending machine, or have alot of scrap you dont use. 200 more lbs wont fix this because players will continue these bad habits. Inventory management is tedious but very neccessary.
---
Motion seconded. That‚Äôs perfect.
---
Yeah i went to palace of winding paths after searching it up
---
It‚Äôll take a few hrs to finish them all so good luck. And you‚Äôre welcome.
---
However, there‚Äôs a 1000 scrip limit. So that sucks.
---
As i say to all people asking for emotes : ¬´¬†or just add text chat¬†¬ª
---
Well you need 3 challenges to get to possum don‚Äôt you?
---
Oh yess waiting 5 minutes for the game to load because of all the crap everyone hordes will be so much fun.
---
Pretty sure all the Responder bots have it. Check the one in Whitesprings resport or Morgantown train station.
---
Woah, woah! No need to express/vent your inner anger against fallout onto me.
---
Go check it out! It‚Äôs worth seeing. üòä
---
Good thing you posted this so early... we can immediately morph this into ‚Äògetting cb‚Äôd‚Äô when the vendor rolls out.
---
Not to sure t45 and b51 have any paint jobs like the military
---
Something like 30 slots, but you can add stacks, so I'm selling like 10,000 ammo, etc.
---
Just take a lot of the same kind
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure! I‚Äôm going to check back a little later tonight if I get the chance, though.
---
Seriously‚Ä¶ those were some Wild Wild West days of stability. Nuke? Good luck!
---
