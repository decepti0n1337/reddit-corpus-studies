Because its easy to get caps and the whole community won't lower prices because caps have a 25k max capacity

Mate I know fallout 76 is a fun game but its lacking in a lot of content so whats been keepen you playing for 900 hours?
---
Wasn’t it proved by the 900 hour guy that ultracite ammo in big enough quantities could get you banned? And say you had multiple rare things Bc you were a trader and they all counted twice Bc you were mulling then crafting mass amounts could 100% get you banned
---
Okay.
---
Would you also like a sippy cup and training wheels back on your bike?
---
If you wait for it to "meat pile", it's often easier to see, too.
---
if your foot is made of brick, you have much more pressing matters to attend to...
---
Damn how do you confuse eating and using lmaooo
---
Not much honestly since energy weapons are trash. 
---

---
Before you ask how I know that. I use them.
---
Oh theres no lag when they come back. But my god the 60 and 10 second message spam..
---
That would be very disheartening
---
Pumpkin House + North Mountain Lookout
---
I should be able to cover whatever flux you don’t have. But I’m really low on adhesive.
---

---
Monster mash mask and imposter sheepsquatch outfit
---
Fashion Souls :)
---
Nope. Only if you drop it from your inventory and not place it
---
Not super high by most, but you'll get people like me who will buy and start crafting endless ammo, for example I currently have at least 2000 of all balilistic ammo
---
When the XP glitches were more prominent, i saw level 900+.
---
Ya in fallout 4 I got to the point that if I walked anywhere that would load sanctuary, it would crash and corrupt that save..
---
What should I replace for sneak perks?
---
Just save up your caps and buy the plan. It is a very rare drop.
---
-karma
---
Good. Thanks, this has had me seriously paranoid any time I'm around other people.
---
ok
---
It is. I only take pictures for atom points now. The good ones take I screenshot on Xbox so I don’t lose them.
---
The dumb thing would be selling something for 7k caps when you are at 22k caps. Your "fix" would just make that 7k item cost 70k.
---
i wiah they would load in the enemies etc before loading in my character
---
300 is all I need. 100 for outfits and 200 for junk
---
I think combat armor chest and leather limbs has the highest Dr/ER total value. 
---
If you're a bloodied build get marine or some thing else with base RR.
---
So for two months I rarely die, then in 24 hours it’s 30 times easier to be killed by things that could barely hurt me, again only wanting to have your opinion stated, thinking you just are the brainiest person, even fitting in slightly fancy words your still missing the simplest of points that I’m only pointing out an issue I’ve noticed in game based on my time spent and my observations while playing my character, and that alone makes all your points null and void since you have 0 of the info I have from my experience of what’s happening
---
Or have the ability to trade/sell to other players/vendors
---
You can have everything in the bag, you probably have had a crapton of requests. go nuts!
---
Thanks!
---
I'm only annoyed when I kill a 3\* SBQ and get a drill. Or a 3\* Mirelurk Queen and get a syringer. I think the level of legendary should have different drop pools, too. And take out every single darned wooden anything in any beast over level 25.
---
Ok... I wasn't around back then, and in my 270 hours have hardly ever seen anyone over 300... so thought over 700 was a major anomaly.
---
Just for saying that you’ve earned yourself your base to be destroyed again
---
Oh ok, not just me then.
---
They do? You just can't see them, they're there. That's why you get killed before you even load in.
---
Excavator has worse resistances comepares to other armor, and some armor has mods that excavator dies not have, such as the jet pack or stealth boy mod. Excavator is also expensive to repair, and other armor has better paints, like the bid paints for t-60.
---
There is a cap on discounts.  Shared perks don't stack and I believe the chr sell bonuses tend to cap around 15 chr. I have 9 natural, 12 total when on team. And popping a grape mentats barely saved me a few dozen caps on the m9st expensive items.
---
Typical armor has zero or little energy resistance
---
I did the event 5 times today. The first time I activated the event myself and took a pylon right away. It took a minute but a lot of people showed up, got the pylons going and we all took it down in about 5 minutes. I felt like things were going well.
---
Every other time I jumped on a pylon right away only for about 2-3 other people to show up and just run around shooting at the invisible sheepsquatch and we failed every time. This event really  needs an active server full of decent level players or you just won’t make it. The severs were full of low level under 10s when I was playing and we just didn’t have the muscle.
---
yeh what 8m saying is they should make them visible before loading my character in
---
Holy crap man, how long did it take you to find all of those, much less clean versions?
---
Happens to me too but what I think happens is in between the time you select the gamer tag and sending the invite the list updates as players come and go so when you send that invite the person you intend to send it to their name drops down one spot and you end up sending it to the person who’s gamer tag is above theirs. Next time if happens look to see if the intended invite is one spot below the unintended invite
---
I think I have a few that I can make. 
---
Gt: WinterImmersion.
---
My greater point is that while it served a purpose, it'll eventually have to go. I definitely agree on your points since I'm at that point now.
---
If I were to restate your issue as "My bloodied build keeps dying, why is that?" then the universal answer most people would come back with is "because you're bloodied." Your anecdotes about how it's changed within the past 24 hours doesn't really answer the most basic question of why you expected to die infrequently with a bloodied build. It's called a glass cannon build for a reason.
---
However you're interpreting my tone, I'm not trying to be combative with you. If you want to take it that way, that's your prerogative.
---
1st time I did it I didn't realise I could leave the area of the pylon as a conduit. So just sat there going through stims, taking out the adds waiting for other people to activate the other pylons. Managed it, but only just. 
---
The second time through I learned I could activate all three pylons myself and don't need to stay near them.
---
You don’t know what super special fertilisers they have in 2076
---
Its a known issue, devs are aware.
---
Yeah then he winked and Xbox messaged me for like 15 min straight. Needless to say I’m friends with the guy that stole the armor now, he’s much cooler.
---
Somehow I had mine set up where I had to have a mic plugged into my controller to make the sound work. I had to go into settings, I believe the xbox settings, to fix it.
---
In a few. GT?
---
This was very fun to watch. Until now, I'd never heard anyone talk about the Cola-Nut perk, and had never really given it all that much consideration. Now I'm stoked to try it out, so thank you! 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, I know you said you had sentinel armor on. Is your chest piece modded with dense (less damage from explosions) /pneumatic (reduces stagger)?
---
What system are you playing on
---
Lol did not see my mistake
---
Dude, chill. You are way too upset.
---
1) you have no idea what you're talking about.  You can't tell people what someone else is thinking.
---
2) You don't know how repair kits are going to work.
---
3) You understand nothing about programming if you believe any of that.
---
4) You may very well be right, but you have no evidence or logical explanation behind what you're saying, other than 'well it HAS to be!!1!'.
---
Seriously, just stop.  You don't know anything.  I'm as afraid of the way things are going as you are (well, maybe no one else really is), but until there's some actual evidence or proof, I'm not making accusations, and neither should you.
---
Ive spent around 220 hours and am Lvl 155
---
I just always use melee so if this happens I don’t waste to much. Put about 1000 rounds of emc into the Scorchbeasts queen to not even get a 3 star weapon or a weapon at all, just ammo and a stimapck no plans either. I use melees and they most of the time don’t despawn
---
Did you ever make that medic build? XD I'm looking to make one pretty soon
---
110 hours, level 73.
---
Can I buy a t 45 and raider set
---
Where did you find it? 
---
And you have to have someone that's not on your team kill it....or you can move your CAMP device. They normally "circle" that, so if you move it outside  and relog it should go with the device.
---
Yeah I'm currently running one now
---
that's what I'm saying! People excpect to be immortal and upset when they realise that they're not.
---
I don't even know why there should be any possibilies to be immortal in pvp.
---
had something like this happen the other day, dropped a nuke on whitespring, one of the protectrons got in the way when we were killing ghouls, had to  kill all of the bots at the resort
---
PM sent
---
BSG indicated recently that they were looking into it.
---
Can you link to me the build?
---
That happens a lot at my current camp.  Radstags, cats, fireflies, squirrels... and those little furballs can open locked doors too, so the molerats just waltz right on in.
---
I am chill, I'm just speaking my mind on how I feel Bethesda is treating us.
---
Yeah give me a few
---
I role play as an upset and disgruntled utility worker there to shut off the power and things get carried away.
---
The closest I’ve ever come was hearing a weird sound, turning around, and seeing one teleport away
---
The armor effects don't work. 
---
Sometimes occasionally thw game will bug and it'll allow you to keep on your armor/underarmor and says it ls equipped. I've had it still register and give me special stats during that bug(and the extra carry weight and hp). But whenever I entered a building, or fast traveled it removed them. 
---
No clue how to force that glitch though its been completely random for me and not all that common.
---
No I didn’t just call them if you have their number though where I can speak to someone directly feel free to share it!     I submitted a ticket the response was there looking into it which to me doesn’t mean squat!
---
I just didn’t play very much and if I did I idiotically held everything on me
---
PS4, my PSN name is OneNudeBanana
---
Huh weird, I'm finding it too easy now. For the last 5 times a random nuke has been droped in a server Im in we killer her in 10 min or less. 
---
Huh weird, I'm finding it too easy now. For the last 5 times a random nuke has been dropped in a server Im in we killer her in 10 min or less.
---
Same its been crazy bad since last patch.
---
It’s beside a set of stairs where there is no floor
---
It’s a piece going next to a set of stairs where there is no floor
---
I selected them off the map with no one around and it still does it. I thought the same but it still did it off the map. Its even done it when i try to fast travel to them
---
Same, xb1s
---
Agreed, I'm basically a glass cannon anyways so I don't care about armor as much, that's the reason I'm wearing entirely leather armor, low weight and deep pocketed. Plus I can carry more out of power armor (excluding Excavator with Motion Assist Servos and Calibrated Shocks) so it's pretty much all I use, although I will take my X-01 or Ultracite with me for Queen fights usually, and the  excavator afterwards for farming flux/loot.
---
I tried to Rez a guy but I accidentally ate him instead. I felt bad.
---
Yep weapons are repaired appreciate it !   Still can’t attach THE XO1 Jet pack or any other model for that matter does that power armor but I guess in a few months they’ll fix that also
---
It did thanks!
---
Huh weird, for the last few times Ive seen the queen on a random server we killed her in 10 kin or less. Im finding it too easy now and find it kinda boring.
---
Also on the crashes, I feel you bro. It crashes 1/3 times when I fight the sheepsquach.
---
Thanks man!
---
Fingers crossed for a future update. Add it as a mini game
---
Lol it would be cool to just have showcases of it and build a power armor museum. different types of power armor, different skins.
---
Really, that’s good advice for anyone trying to see *anything* rare or random in this game. I’ve been busy traveling around areas filling out my map and it’s amazing how many mothmen, legendaries, and random encounters I’ve found. I’ve even found a good number of handmade and lever action rifles the past week when I do it.
---
Still no more than one quick glimpse of the flat woods monster though
---
Quick update: Just had another rad storm occur at my CAMP.  Went out to check the trees, and they just had glowing resin. Flowers hadn’t changed either...  I guess it was just a coincidence that my first “random flux appearance” happened to occur during a rad storm.
---
Very decent

---
This is the base build. I tweet it depending on the situation such as swapping the pistol perks for stealth ones and moving charisma perks around depending on the situation.  Most important part is team medic and traveling pharmacy
---
Tell em to drink some vintage nuka shine that’ll be fun
---
I really like your little garage, and the beams at your bar. :)
---
You can earn better ones in-game, and it doesn't affect you at all. Another reddditor convinced me of this. I was upset too, but honestly, it is okay. Look at all the free updates we have got. They are improving constantly and it needs to be funded. So, if someone with less time to play wants to drop some bucks, let them.
---
18 hours, level 39. Started playing on the 2x exp weekend.
---
Still pretty new to the game
---
Hmm I mean it possible I didn't get the atoms, but yesterday I remember having 500+ atoms so I think it gave it, but could be wrong, I remember in the pass some challenges would be auto completed but it would be like 1 challenge like level up or craft med item but that was so rare though.
---
Well crap I was hoping you would say Xbox I would craft one at your level and just give it to you. I believe the vendor bot inside of Grafton (not the train station) sells the plan for just under 2000 caps
---
Possibly just left over as a glitch from the engine from fallout 4.
---
Amen to that
---
So when I can take a beating from a mass of bears and walk away one day but then almost die from a lvl one scorched with a gun the next that’s just the build is what you’re saying? And has nothing to do with the possibility that there’s say an issue with stats not being loaded like my stabilized mod not always working, and that the fact I can see a major change in my survivability from fights has drastically changed from 24 hours ago, like that fact that being in my excavator armour is now better than in my combat armour even though my combat armour has more resistance and lowers incoming damage?
---
Flatwoods is the alien cryptid, Grafton is the albino hulk with no head
---
Yea, that's happened a lot, but the bot traders there are supposed to be invincible. I think they forgot to code that in
---
How did this happen?
---
May 23rd is when it will be in the game.
---
Happened to me too, turned around fast enough for just a glimpse and he teleported away
---
Jeez you could carry more on yourself than in your stash, lmao Bethesda was wildin'
---
Happened to me in the asylum. I killed a 3 star and the ghoul dropped a bloodied dragon xD. And before I could pick it up it disappeared. Didn't even get to see if it was even a 3 star weapon.
---
Standing does not mean crouching friend, and if you're standing still you're begging for a vats crit in the head which will ignore that precious %dr on the armor anyway
---
It happened to me a couple of times with dailies. Logged in and 4/5 were done. At first it seems like you've been robbed but i actually recieved the atoms later that day for zero effort.
---
How much you want to bet there’s some kind of DLC in the works like the wild Appalachia stuff
---
I had a surprisingly good group at the event today. People activated pylons quickly and then everyone laid on the DPS properly. It worked out great.
---
Yeah. Honest question for someone who does hate them: what is the issue? I’m not disagreeing, just asking. 
---
I’ve seen players do a number of shitty things (as well as many great things), and this strikes me as something that would be toward the very bottom of things to complain about. Unless I’m missing something?
---
Actually I was wrong it was 400 whoops
---
Still tho
---
Yeah nod being able to attach mods is annoying. Hopefully they get that ironed out here soon
---
Crashed 4 times on ps4 in about 6 hours. 3 of them happened just after trying to access the perk card menu.
---
Vampire is really necessary for tanking her. As a solo, I guess you filled that role amongst others.
---
Exactly. I've been farming it since the patch and I've gotten two legendaries and one was today. It was a 3-star level 52 in the Civic Center. And guess what it dropped Auto stem with leg. That is b*******.
---
This has been happening to me too, and also from the map, not the list. This needs more attention so Bethesda can fix it.
---
Either you just rearange your camp for it to pass through comfortably on it's way to the  C.A.M.P. device
---
Or let a Player who's not in your team kill it.
---
Got the same problem, both solutions worked for me.
---
The thing I really don't like about this event is that my entire shotgun build often relies on crippling enemy limbs to weaken or stun them, and this event boss has limbs that are 100% immune to cripple.
---
I wish they would only be like 80% immune so that it would at least give me a chance, instead of making the boss completely ignore an otherwise extremely important game mechanic.
---
Seriously why does a sheep-faced assaultron have adamantium limbs but the fucking scorchbeast queen can be totally paralyzed for 30 seconds by crippling its limbs? It makes no sense.
---
Holy hell, this is super helpful. Thank you!
---
Okay good, I almost couldn't believe it was 200.
---
&gt; the result is finding something dead, or doing something for a dead person 99% of missions
---
Try 100%
---
If it was that would not be fun
---
Killed the insult boss sheep five times so far, got one drill, three wood leg pieces and one leather arm.
---
Link wont work
---
until you can't find it lol
---
There’s a way to glitch it out. I know some people who have it. Might be a YouTube tutorial
---
Overall its good for a two handed build. 
---
I'd still recommend moving 2-3 points from endurance and into luck for class freak, it'll cut doen the penalties for those mutations pretty sharply, but you don't really have any that'll ruin your build if you don't have it. 
---
And I'd recommend life giver over ironclad. Lifegiver is much better in terms of increased durability its 45 extra life versus 40Dr/Er. You should be able to easily reach pretty high Dr. With scaly skin and barbarian.  Grounded plus scaly skin gives you all the Er you'll need. When you toss in armor.  Barbarian with max strength, and +3 from enclave underarmor would be 72 dr. Plus 50. Plus probably another 150 from armor. 
---
If you look up how Dr works then you'll know stacking it past 200 is pretty meh. It gets the best reduction until it equals the damage and after that heavily dimishing returns. The extra 40 dr/Er might work out to an extra 2-4% reduced damage.  While 45 extra life is an extra 15-20ish% max life for most characters.
---
The very second week the game was up I saw a lvl 800ish. Glad we can report now.
---
I'd be OK with it if I could vendor the useless drops for a decent amount, but there's nothing 'legendary' about 9 caps.
---
+karma
---
I had that happen once. I ended up with over 100 of them in my inventory before the weekly reset finally deleted them all. I avoid those guys now.
---
Check it now. I accidentally had a word in with the link.
---
Sounds just like how an alien behaves when he is spoted a by human lol We don't hear much about aliens nowadays in real life, it used to be a big deal and often seen on TV back in late 90's and early 2000's, I remember.
---
Named my instigating fast-swing sledgehammer "*Sit The Fuck Down*" in memory of my "*All Rise*" that took me through so much before I got the new one.
---
Ok, you go ahead and crunch those numbers and give me a total max carry weight you can have before you can't transfer or drop items. 
---
And tell me why it's significant compared to the millions of pounds that people were lugging around on their mules and mains before.
---
For me they still drop legendaries but the legendaries suck. 3 star legendary ghouls dropping 1 star items. Always a trouble shooters, a Mutant Slayer’s, or an exterminators.
---
I suggest doing a lot of the faction quests (Because I think there the best.) to get more of a feel for the game, after you at least kinda know what youre doing I suggest events and grinding. Also Its pretty easy to find a group online or in game to play with and get the ropes for.
---
Also If you even see the sheapsquach event do it and get a hit on it, you probably wont have fun and it will be annoying but trust me. It only lasts 10 minutes and in a year from know when all the sheapsquch drops have 10x in value youll thank me.
---
This is true, when my corpses vanishes, I usually find them where they spawned... Excpet they are not lootable at all, and I still lose my loot.
---
Great work.
---
Talking about _this_ game, actually.
---
Way **too many people** are experiencing this problem since the patch, me included. I have all the mats and perks and still cannot apply any mod, not even those that I had already applied in the past. This is a clear bug introduced by the patch, which they will hopefully fix soon.
---
Am I the only person who doesn't loot unwanted ammo? I mean, seriously, why do you people pick up shit you don't need and then ask Bethesda to give you a way to get rid of it?
---
It would prevents people from grinding for XP by killing the ghouls as soon as they spawn in the golf club. It’s just a dick move. There are plenty of other places to grind though.
---
No they don't more than others! It's all about firerate... I've got killed in my SA armor by so many types of weapons: Minigun, Gatling Gun, LMG all with high fire rate... 
---
So prevent that someone could shoot at you is the best thing you can do (in every game).
---
I've gotten a few off her myself. I was there right next to him when he got the recipe. You might be running low luck chars, you'll never get anything like that.
---
Probably. I guess some people didnt read the title of the post as i very clearly said maybe but hey some people don't have the ability to read apparently
---
Right? You get better so the game is comparatively easier. Making the game impossible for people who don't have time or money to dump on gear isn't going to make you "better". Wanting it just makes you more of an elitist jackass.
---
Oh thats why ive never heard of them 🤣
---
Got 8 cards, launched one Nuke. Keep shooting down government transport-drones for fun when I see them.
---
No u
---
I like your little garden. :)
---
Nah. Teamwork makes the dream work.
---
I think this is still accurate?

---
For guns it's either anti armor explosive or bloodied explosive, depending on the rest of your build.
---
Considering that your examples don't make any sense, yes. Yaoi Guai have always negated sentinel+cavalier damage reduction before, so the fact you were able to get hit by them before and not die doesn't make sense. The fact you expect to be able to take any amount of damage as a bloodied build doesn't make sense. The fact that your stabilized mods don't work but mine do doesn't make sense. Everything you're describing as a bug with your bloodied build except for the stabilized issue is how my bloodied builds have always experienced the game. When you run glass cannon levels of health you tend to die like a glass cannon does. I never thought that was a bug, I always thought that was a play style choice. If you're only just now catching up to the rest of us, welcome to the club
---
ammo from completing events/quests and accidental pick ups still builds up quickly ?
---
I've never come across it. Do you have an exact map location?
---
Takes skill to solo
---
Meta? No. Viable? Yes.
---
Agree so much.
---
I think the times of the day reflect the loots. Anytime during noon to late evening the drops have sucked, but usually around 1:30am central time I get tons of good legendaries. It's almost like the ghouls reset. You also have a much better chance at this time because a lot less people are on as well.
---
It's in the imgur link scroll down. That's the location on the map
---
Sure, buddy. Sure it does.
---
Never actually used it don’t play any more... But this is my idea of a good build as long as your on a team otherwise I would not recommend it. Unless they changed how perks work or any of the perks I recommend I don’t follow the game anymore
---
I loved making p.a displays.

I’ve managed to see the Flatwoods monster twice: one in the savage divide when I was level 30, and then again while I was running away from 2 ScorchBeasts after attempting the queen fight, at level 49. 
---
I also have a question: can the Flatwoods monster control other enemies? Because when I ran into it the second time, a purple aura surrounded the 2 ScorchBeasts that were tailing me and they landed and started following me on foot.
---
Wish it was Xbox man
---
They removed explosive from energy weapons, so you can't find TSE lasers anymore, but TSE ballistic weapons still drop on occasion. I got a level 35 TSE shotgun the other day.
---
To scavenge.. I might have needed it later. But the apocalyptic scavenging/scraping/recrafting and bartering on all levels is not too far-fetched or too much to add into a game.
---
Began a new character on survival while new to the game and now a level 39? Hats off to you. That’s pretty dang impressive
---
A baseball bat and a tire iron are my recent SBQ loots, actually being disconnected half way would’ve saved me all those ultracite ammo.
---
Agreed. I was actually really surprised that the photo mode limit was so small. Bethesda invested quite a bit into creating this fantastic photo mode, quite possibly one of the best I e seen in a video game, yet cap the players at such a all number of photos. I resorted to screen capturing them on Xbox and saving them that way as XB is seemingly limitless with saved screen shots. 
---
It only helps the company to create a free advertising base from the players. I would think giving playing a large cache to hold their in-game photos to share and talk about would only help the game and the overall bottom line. 
---
Please increase the max number of photos exponentially. Thank you.
---
Prove me the professional skill of 3v1ing someone
---
Same on ps4 as well. Kinda lame
---
No u? How about a better answer.
---
I've gotten past that point but when I go to upload the data into the fabricator It says i lack the necessary components which I do not
---
Yeah ikr, I was very excited to have a huge catalogue of photos but bwahh
---
3 characters, highest level a 72 and I've put 422 hours in
---
No
---
538 hours sadly... Level 138 on one character,114 on another and 38 on the last, spent a lot of time experimenting builds and perfectly.
---
Its probably server lag/issues. That is normally what happens when you stop dealing damage and peoples health keeos bobbing up and down.
---
you're awesome, i'll definitely add you as soon as I'm online
---
I feel like the only possible way this could be added would be a display case and that alone may be difficult for Bethesda. I would rather they not waste the time on this, honestly.
---
Cap limit!  Meh - 100 hours in my highest cap count has been 4000.  Not sure how you all make your caps, but I am over her weighing my fast travel against my wallet.  Lol
---
I'd managed to avoid any spoilers for a couple of months before playing so I had no idea everybody was dead until about the third time a quest giver turned out to be a robot. Lost interest in the main quest pretty soon after that.
---
I've thought about building there a few times, I love the little shack.
---
I'm not visiting one. I hit up three or four of the spots north of Abbie's Bunker. I've seen the Mothman and plenty of lemonade vendors and tameable creatures, but never once a Flatwoods monster in the area.
---
Because you know it's true 1v1 takes more skill than 3v1
---
What ever it is it make pvp impossible sometimes
---
Sound good!

Got killed 5x by a 3 star murelurk king in about 20 secs each time. Thought it might have been an immortal ( bug ) type.
---
Eventually killed it with 8 missiles point blank and a melee attack. I was persistent cause I thought it may have something good.
---
Ended up with a Legendary lead pipe ( 1 star ).
---
I did play the hell out of fallout 4 and I did read some guides on how to level up efficiently.
---
Thanks anyways!
---
Sorry didnt scroll down. Interesting find. Hopefully someone knows what key it is.
---
It's a game. Take a breath
---
Looking for that ?  [https://imgur.com/a/RxPJbBM](https://imgur.com/a/RxPJbBM) 
---
MP ;)
---
Might be the trail to open the TNT dome places
---
Not when it's survival mode.
---
That’s stupid op how do you counter your build
---
No crashes for me on PC. But the latest update caused the game to stutter whenever I switch weapons
---
Its bugged rn
---
Np, yeah I would like to know it's a mystery to me right now
---
Nah I believe you I just know how difficult it is to concentrate on the game in survival much less being new to the game with a brand new character.
---
I was wondering the same thing.
---
Clearly the best weapon in the Game.
---
It is Dense yeah. I considered Pneumatic but I really found I needed Dense.
---
You shouldn't need any perks to apply pre existing mods, though
---
no idea. thats why im posting it around. something felt fishy
---
RIP
---
I just assume when I get the notification that it's a new player turning it on by accident, never gets higher than 1/4.
---
And your true ignorance shows, oh mighty one who knows best and is caught in his tunnel vision of being the only right person in the world do you feel good about being so high on your horse? It’s a shame really must get boring having your head so far up your ass, this has been fun and you’ve accomplished absolutely nothing but having another person see what an ass you are because god forbid someone else is correct that there may be an issue you refuse to see as a possibility
---
Prove to me a 1v1 takes skill. It's just a gear/perk/mutation battle. Whoever has the better of those, wins. That's not skill.
---
380 hrs/ lv 108
---
Yeah wish this bug would count the hard challenges though, it seems to affect older challenges you completed before.
---
"Hey boss, where do you want this Nukashine?"
---
"Right next to the Mr. Handy fuel, under the armorer bench."
---
I usually take a pylon or two, jump on top of the cabin to avoid being killed and slowing progress down, then snipe the mobs after getting a few hits on the boss while eating stims.  (I use First Aid and Chem Fiend perks for max effect)
---
I have an instigating/vats acc lever gun, so all of the trash goes down with one hit and I basically always have 95% accuracy.  Gun Fu is great, as is Adrenaline.
---
Sometimes I'll start shooting the boss with my handmade when I see that the rest of the team isn't making terrific progress, but I tend to just focus on the gutsies because everyone is generally focused on the boss and seems to forget the rest of the event exists.
---
The event is done in like 2/3 minutes if I have my buddies online, not counting the initial dialogue and start-up time.  Jumping in with a team of randos tends to be messy.  I probably have to do 10x more work with 12 players I don't know than server hopping for an open terminal with just three friends, and die WAY more often.  We've actually gotten thumbs downed by players that ported in too late because apparently we finished too fast.  (that's what she said)  
---
We're partially trying to mash through it just to decrease the likelihood of crashing before finishing.  It happens 80% of the time if the event goes for longer than a couple minutes.
---
Ah yeah I hear it bugs the event out if you glitched it lol.
---
hell, just sticking the red star pin on the ushanka would be 90% of the work
---
I was using my vamp gun at first but its damage is just much lower than what I wanted. A medics shotgun would do better i think.
---
I got an email saying they would look at my account in 7-10 days. That was on 1/24. It’s kind of silly at this point with the amount of time Iv put on another account but I’d like to get that username back at some point.
---
Best of luck to you on your glass cannon tank meta
---
It's still just a game in survival mode
---
Is there a rarity order on these, or just an equal chance for any non-dirty one?
---
ThreeCirclesNet .  No charge.
---
Nice job finding the communist, soldier!
---
I seen this player month or two ago and they were level 500. Its not glitching imo, just extreme farming all day long.
---
ah thank you
---
I leveled from 20s to over 100 without fast travel...  and I was THANKFUL!
---
Preferably from orbit...
---
It's the only way to be sure.
---
When you lose a outrageous amount of items not just "some" aid items then it's more than some game.
---
I forgot to mention you need to be at least twice it's level. That's probably important.
---
I had a quick run through the golf clubhouse on my way to sell some stuff and got 4 or 5 legendaries - seems pretty good to me though I don't think I saw any 3 stars or anything.
---
Its a 4v4vX when its most fun. People who don't team up are either lunatics or legends.
---
I still have more than 5k yet don’t know what to buy. It appears skins for weapons are extremely difficult to make, at least to bethesda artists.
---
I really like the build-up, had me going there.
---
I'll be on in 20. Maybe i can make it?
---
Absolutely Marvelous all by self man
---
Different skins with effects maybe? Eyebot would be more of a burst pattern (beam splitter) for example, with the gun shape based off the eyebot. Could have sentrybot one be an auto charge instead of reload (similar to gatling), firing on release.
---
Could also have mod-able lenses that either change range focus (weapon range vs damage) and/or beam color.
---
Stealth Boy = No VATS
---
I'm sure they aren't too far off from doing this. They've already brought up how they are working on ways for players to show off their bobbleheads at their camps. Will most likely be displayable on a stand while also taking up stash space.
---
Welcome to most online games. I'll be posting guides how to do this hard content solo. Already did sheepsquatch.
---
Yeah, pvp is broken at the core because its so easy to dish out damage because armor pen abilities are easy to get on multiple weapon types (melee,rifle,heavy guns) and crits bypass armor anyways. The only reason sentinel/assassin was so broken is because it reduced damage directly as wasn't effected by armor pen, but vats crits knock you out of sentinel so its easy to play around,  also one gun army works as well.
---
My issue isn't that people can walk up and steal your shit when you die. My issue is that, unlike pretty much everything else, there's _no way to get it fucking back_ when some sack of shit walks up and squats on your death bag and steals your shit.
---
Iv tried a couple times to get one out on PS4 with no luck. I’d like to get my hands on one.
---
Glad all you guys are coming to save us from people putting up camp were they want to thank god for you. Wow just think I thought each one of us could do what we wanted in our own game. Thank you so much
---
And I should be able to _walk up behind you_ as you squat over my bag and _steal my shit_ and blow your fucking brains out, and add your pile of scrap to mine, because you _should_ be flagged for PVP when you steal other peoples shit.
---
On my way
---
I’ve got a whole bunch of ‘wrecking ball’ bonus cards for leveling up, apparently Bethesda really really wants players to grief each other.
---
And if you decided to be a sack of shit, steal someone's dropped loot, you should be flagged for PVP so I can walk up to you, blow your brains out, and add your shit to mine. 
---
That's the problem.
---
A zoom feature would be quite handy for notes
---
No need for profanities dude. People don't need lectures from some low life.
---
Yrah, I posted early
---
What?
---
Thanks for the build!
---
What do you think of this build? The idea is to use handmade rifles and vat crits to do additional healing. 
---

---
Well. A few points. Don't get in a fight that you can't win. Get good. Use tactics instead of whatever TSE you probably are using. Use smarts to beat overwhelming odds.
---
I'm a little bit of both I guess. Lel
---
Np.
---
Thanks for the compliment.
---
What's tse
---
There is no paid DLC in this game and most likely won't be. There are no paid consumables and there most likely won't be. There is no way of skipping any kind of grind here. You can't pay for resources, you can't pay for exp, you can't pay for legendaries, you can't pay for better drops.
---
They made it ultra rare to get a Two Shot, Explosive, Anti-Armor, and Furious mod weapons.
---
Wasn't referring to you
---
You can move your little camp device thing in the build screen and that will change where it hangs out. Also if you want to kill it make sure pacifist is off.
---
Well  I used anti-armor weapons and it seemed to work well, but then again I wasn't the only one shooting at her so it's impossible to know how much of it was me and how much was from other players.   I only did the event once and when I did most of the server showed up for the fight and we destroyed it pretty quickly.  There were high level players but also a good chunk in the 40's and they all contributed.  The more people the better.
---
E  of Mega Rocket is Freddy Fear's, that spot usually spawns Halloween Skull Masks/Witch Hats, not sure abt the costumes themselves
---
NEXT WEAPON CONFURMED
---
Ok. Just making sure.
---
Cool! What's your psn?
---
And I think it's entirely dependent on if I tie a string around my finger and pray to RNGesus. It works 100% most of the time!
---
Interesting idea
---
Why, because they stand a better chance of winning when they work together? And winning in PVP is kinda the point of survival?
---
Get mentally prepared for a lot of drills and useless wood armor pieces. But if you don’t mind poor in-game rewards, yea it’s a fun pass time.
---
I've been having this exact lighting issue.  Interiors seem to be unaffected but the terrain is just awful.
---
When I try to load the files in the editor, it crashes. I guess I'd just have to replace the music .xwm files. Thanks for the heads up!
---
If anything this would have been the “Hunting” patch. A ton of crossbow/bow and hunting rifle could have been added and changed. 
---
With the lying Lowe quest and side quest it felt more like I should have put on my detectives coat and chased the leads down.
---
Gotten to the point now where I give up on hoping someone else will be a conduit, three times now I've gone in, taken all three pylons, survived the entire 15 minutes whilst killing mobs for everyone and watched everyone else miserably fail to kill the Sheepsquatch. Drives me crazy.
---
Idk if you’ll find anyone selling a tse pump for 500 but there’s always hope
---
The ONE TIME I"M away from home for 5 days and  I missed this \*cries\*   
---
Off to Falllout trading so someone can make me a whole set...! #dangmyluck
---
Exactly, no junkie drug would be so easy to screw up
---
You take that chance when you cross over. You know the consequences, don’t play if you’re not able to accept those consequences. Too easy. Don’t cry when you don’t win.
---
I would be funny if the event didn’t fail.
---
It's cowardly behavior, here's why if you overwhelm with numbers it's just one big statstick forcing you to pull out mini nukes and stuff which at that point lacks skill to use numbers to win.
---
Came across an interesting issue with a lvl-45 Tier 3 Legendary Berserker's Fire Axe (unmodded).  
---
Its powers are:  
---
\- 40% Faster Swing Speed  
---
\- More Damage the lower your Damage Resistance  
---
\- +1 Agility  
---
When not equipped, its damage shows *(for me, and I no melee related perks)* that it should be 140, but after equipping it the damage drops to 84 *(both in weapon stats and the damage retical in bottom right of PipBoy)*. Not only that, but the damage of my other melee weapon also drops considerably if I hover over it to see its stats *(224 down to 94)*; however, it returns to normal upon requipping it, as dose the Fire Axe
---
At the bot vendors, the "Plan: Assaultron head" is showing up as not being "(Known)" for me, and yet I can craft *both* the Assaultron Helm and the Salvaged Assultron Head (weapon).... I suspect this is related to the issue with the plan from the Sheepsquatch event that you've documented *(which I confirmed that the sheepsquatch version does not unlock when read by my main character, and he too prior to that already knew the Helm and Weapon Assaultron plans).* 
---
Not sure if this is normal, as I too am not one to use VATS but once in a blue moon, but seems related to the issue of VATS consuming lots of Fusion Cell power in PA. I noticed while quickly pressing Q, my AP would drop each time by about 1/32^(nd). Since while in PA I'm pretty sure the amount of fusion cell drained is tied to the player's AP, then anyone who spams the VATS key/button will in turn be draining cells. Basically no different than running in PA.
---
Seems *all* of the .44 Pistol Receiver mods only require: 1x Nuclear Material, 1x Screw, 3x Steel. Barrels... seem to only differ between two different ones, so maybe normal? Grips *all* are the same: 1x Adhesive, 3x Screws, 8x Steel. Sights are like barrels (though I only have 3 available), which I suspect is a bug since "Standard Sights" require the exact same as the Reflex Sight. &gt;\_&gt; 
---
\-=-=-
---
I'm not sure if you're also collecting "mapping, texture, and  other errors" as well, but...
---
At the "Thomas Farm" where we have to "Search for Clues at the Thomas Farm" as part of the quest *"Unsolved: Best of Intentions"*. The 55-gal barrel of Glyphosate inside the barn , the pop-up box has a typo in it. Says 'For Aersol use ONLY' instead of *Aer****o****sol.*
---
Also at the farm, near the big aerosol fertilizer machine, is a random corner to... something. It's just randomly placed and not attached to any object. It's clearly in error because it becomes invisible from the opposite side.
---
For the *"Unsolved: Tracking Terror"* quest, the pile of skulls and decomposing viscera is placed completely half-assed, partially in the dirt, partially floating above the weeds... (They really need to work on their map editing program to have it rotate/angle crap they place!)
---
And since my game is 'froze' during the Sheepsquatch event.... I'll all it here and comment :)
---
You got all your prices fucked mate, Mutation serums sell for like 150 each and last time
---
You might have learned a plan for a BOS under armor mod.
---
Bethesda really knows how to fuck up a game with patches,honestly they should just stop trying and fire all their shitty programmers.Just let the modding community fix the damn game.I saw a post last night about a modder that made a mod to switch the buttons back around on the repair menu,how retarded is it that people have to fix stuff like this??
---
These guys are like the single worst collection of devs and programmers I've seen in 20 years of gaming.I literally shudder to think of all the stuff that's gonna break when they introduce their first instanced dungeon O.o
---
Been playing 250+ hours and still haven't run into him. Mothman only 1 time. Bethesda should up the chances.
---
How is it cowardly because people are working with others? It allows you to employ strategies that would otherwise be futile. The whole point of survival is winning the fights. And if you work together to win, that doesn’t make you cowardly.
---
That's a lot of power armor
---
What legendary armor effects would you most suggest?
---
Same. I get a shit load of legendaries only 1* stuff. When it’s nuked, definitely not as good
---
250+ hours and I haven't seen his ass either. Mothman only once.
---
I'd say nuke whitesprings then go get bitch smacked by glowing ones they always tear up my armor somehow
---
It's the game performance that is the joke. Getting server dropped or a game freeze is the worst. 
---
Some fights work out and others don't - that's the main criticism of this game.
---
Only when promised a 1v1 it does.
---
It is perment content.  Did you start quest yet?
---
It's not circle jerk. I've encountered none of what you are talking about when doing the event. The problem for me has not been with people not doing their part or with failing it. The problem has been with completing it and getting rewards that are no better than what you get from killing any random one star legendary enemy. 
---
It's a real problem, and it's serious and it's something Bethesda has been consistently ignoring. So you're going to hear about it, not just from me but many others, regardless of what the intent of your threads are.
---
Wallpaper or paint would be fantastic.
---
If you're looking for mutations, look on the 76 Looking For Group tab. I got almost all my Serums today for 100 caps each after someone posted they were selling in Whitesprings.
---
It's a know bug since the last update. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.
---
There are some methods to do that. Don't remember how of the top of my head, but there is a way.
---
But it’s survival mode, all about survival right? Survival of the fittest, and if you aren’t fitter than a group of guys who’ve teamed up to survive then why do you think they should weaken what they’ve made in order to give you a fair shot
---
I have, I collected all of the ingredients and then the quest disappeared.
---
Well... The word "some" doesn't mean your whole aid box it should mean around 15 to 20%.
---
So yes I have that right to cry there
---
Yes it really showed the dev wants everyone to farm WS and WS only. Don’t play the events, they either cap the bosses at low level, or bait you with a three star then throw a drill or a piece of wood at you. Tbh they’re right, why waste time else where when they set up the perfect farming ground at WS.
---
Auto stim helps vanguard and or bolstering would also be good. I run bloodied so I use unyielding and bolstering with a chameleon and autostim and I think a life savers. It all depends on how you play
---
Yea, if they actually communicate that they are going to do a 1v1 with you and then call extra guys in to gang up on you that’s one thing. 
---
But if you just happened to run across of gang of marauders, what do you expect to happen? Their not out to show you a good time. Most people aren’t
---
I do have to say a well made point about Hello Games’ NMS.
---
Happened to me as well
---
I've been stockpiling magazines in anticipation.  They're surprisingly heavy.
---
O_o k
---
Lets do it!
---
LMFAOOOOO 
---
Buzzfeed: “People are LIVID about the new Fallout 76 update!!!!”  
---
*Provides 3 tweets and one Reddit thread to prove it*
---
It's semi rare
---
More like survival of the cowards.
---
Dude. No one is gonna care about making it at 1v1. Its survival of the fittest. It’s not about a glorious match. Fair is something that survival is not. You go into survival knowing the fact that teams are a thing.
---
Strange
---
It helps if you have someone with sentinel armor be the damage sponge and keep robo squash in one place... I've competed it a few times today with randoms..  yes many died but we still got it done in five mins or so... also today someone nuked the queen solo, so I reluctantly helped and the two of us killed her in 7 minutes... this is multi player, you gotta have team work for these end game missions, even if the team is one other person
---
Is it? I've got loads of them. The BOS scribe outfit os the rare one of the bunch.
---
I pick up all ammo. Once in a while I go through it and leave any unnecessary stuff at overseers camp. Helping people out....
---
Game altering microtransactions?
---
Many youtubers are partially to blame for this. They basically tell Bethesda hey look at me i can get the most out of your game at this sweet spot, so Bethesda has to kill it.
---
I run a build with 23 luck so dont think thats low. 😂 But thanks for elaborating there might still be hope then.
---
I’m not sure what you expected from survival, but you expect people to wanna 1v1 you, you have another thing coming.
---
Same problem after I just spent 3500 on mods for it!!
---
They sure advertised it as a solo thing I mean look at vault boy with a knife that sure sounds very soloy to me.
---
Make a mule and sell some dude lol I got 5 miles basically full of crap
---
How much is the scribe outfit going for?  I found that and two bomber jackets this week
---
read the Pi Mus party poster at a train station to start the quest line
---
MINOR SPOILER:
---
  I'd tell you that if you dont have the weapons to help with the fake sqautch you can still help in the fight...be a conduit. Go to one of the pylons and activate it. When they are activated the shield on the imposter goes down and the others can damage it. Just make sure you have stimpacks on a hotkey, being a conduit drains your hp.
---
People who team up survive. It's a survival game. People team up in the real world in literally every situation that would benefit from it. If you cant find someone to team with you, we have a term for you
---
 Victim. 
---
Welcome to the fuckin show.
---
I suppose I could do that one. Drop at the 1st cache to givem a leg up. Good tip. Think I read that before too
---
Ya and it means....nothing.Isnt that a shame.
---
I'm a honorable person I grant 1v1s heck I believe. In them keeping their stuff after.
---
I have done a few segments of the quest already though.
---
Not really because everyone who said it would be easy to do refused to stream themselves doing it to prove he was correct.
---
Talk is cheap.
---
Same. I have to exit out completely and go back in. I use a sort mod, thought it might be responsible but not so much. There is a nexus mod mod that purports to fix it post patch 8 but haven't tried it myself yet.
---
I found one in the Northeastern most portion of the map, near the compass icon. I was running away from a scorchbeast and was getting shot by a purple beam. I had no idea what the hell it was until I climbed into some random treehouse.
---
Yeh that hotfix made it worse for me. All the time now. Tonight was the best run I've had. Only one crash. Feel like that was winning lol
---
Actually it means I need to get strong enough to fight teams solo
---
I found one at my camp up there. across the road from thunder mountain between there and excelsior model home. he flew right on up to my camp.
---
You can't sell scrap junk I tryed all over the map at ever vendor's
---
I can sell you a one star bloody smg for 500 to get you by if you don't get any bites
---
with the new cap limit on vendors, ive just been dumping them there for a solid 300 per serum, almost 500 with Grape mentats and Hard bargain. even with the daily cap limit. good for days that i can only briefly play
---
Okay? It’s cover art. What does the art/logo have to do with gameplay?
---
Not the 10mm right ?
---
Bulk it
---
When you do that post the link here I’m down
---
Bethesda confirmed in this week's 'inside the vault' that the upcoming burrows dungeon is balanced for 2 players and is soloable. 
---
I agree that the new event is a clusterfuck (although I think it could be tweaked to improve it) but I don't think we'll have the same problems with the dungeons.
---
Probably a shit load of other glitches and confusing design decisions though!
---
Can you still talk to bev? Have you tried crafting it?
---
Bringing full squad
---
You can sell it if it's bulked
---
Knifing a individual instead a poses like duke nukem.
---
I haven’t tried, I will now.
---
I'm all for funding the game with microtransactions, as as long as the stay out of the pay to win areas.  Repair kits are not *really* there yet, but it's another toe over the line.
---
'You can get better' is letting them get comfortable.  If you could buy legendary items for cash, just not the absolute best ones, would that be OK?
---
Yes, people are overreacting.  But they're coming from a good place.  If FO76 goes the rest of the way across the line, then what?  It will be too late at that point, and many, many of us will walk away.  Then the game will only exist for the whales and the people that just don't care any more.
---
how far along are you?
---
Too op
---
Maybe he’s using crits but if you find anything let me know
---
Nah it's pretty accurate. I got a furious lvl 45 handmade for 1000 caps a while back and even then I'm pretty sure I was overpaying. Xbox had it the worst with duping, so 500 for one of the thousands of duped TSE pump actions isn't even unreasonable. Serums is eh, I remember they went for 500 caps each but nowadays people will make them for free if you bring them materials
---
Check out r/fo76bazaar
---
Your argument about cover art has nothing to do with gameplay. Survival is survival of the fittest. Unless you decide you want to team up and use actually good strategies against other teams, have fun getting your shit rocked. 
---
Welcome to Fo76 survival, kiddo.
---
Bull it or sell it on market 76. Lots of people buy it. Or drop it lol
---
Happy cake day
---
Gathering nuka cola quantum, boiled water etc.
---
I've chopped through a team of four would be raiders defending my munitions factory before... this game is about skill, perk cards, tactics and luck.  They backed me into a corner with my 50 cal and just kept running at me lmao... bottom line, you put in the time you can be a one gun army, but you will always be better on a team
---
Someone needs a hobby.
---
I'm no kid and I have to get strong enough to beat noobish numbers. Strategy beats strength no matter the opposition.
---
Occasionally radroaches spawn "inside" and when they die the ragdoll physics go insane and they start bouncing nonstop inside of the object walls
---
Hahaha somone took his Sweet roll
---
loooooool
---
1000 ammo for like 100 caps, I doubt anyone would be more rich then they are
---
do you have the full recipe for Nuka shine, including the "missing part"?
---
They already said they have stability issues related. We might get 1K but 4? Not going to happen. Sell the weapons you dnt use. Keep less junk, you get more constantly. Mules or be a minimalist are your only options.
---
I think so.
---
You'll want to get Escape Artist in there.
---
If it's a bloodied build (suggested by Serendipity) then Class Freak + Adrenal Reaction is strictly better than Bloody Mess, if you're only taking one of them.
---
Four Leaf Clover and Critical Savvy stack negatively, so you might want to pick only one of them.
---
Gun Fu is worth considering over the top few points of Adrenaline.
---
Shouldnt have stopped in the first place and yes its better and this coming tuesday is the 3 dlc being released
---
Go bloodied and yes. Bloodied is the new best. I use a bloodied explosive gauss and I'm loving it.
---
Why don't they have toilet paper at KFC?
---
Because it's finger lickin' good.
---
Lol solo is the exact opposite of what survival is about..your trying to survive best way is more people
---
That's why I'm asking for the stash box's limit to be very high in limit it's getting to a point where I have to sell armour and weapons that I have crafted
---
Beastly O.o
---
Because it's finger lickin'good.
---
thanks :)
---
That’s awesome
---
My god how do you do it. at least someone gets it . the lone wolf lifestyle. Question does fireproof perk slowly explosive weapons like it says in the perk.
---
I have just legendary weapons I sell the poor guns
---
I wasn’t happy about that nerf either, but tbh TSE is still a viable weapon. It no longer takes down a pack of level 68 ghouls in one shot, but with the right perk cards, you can still squeeze a good amount of damage of of ea shot.
---
Except when your role playing as a lone wolf build
---
Ig you got all the ingredients and you got the pass code to the storage room. Maybe just crafting it then using ferment next to it were bev is might force it through.
---
Armour and weapons you have crafted shouldn’t even matter tbh. Legendarys are where it’s at. I’d just scrap those items for mods. Lol
---
Yep. And solo players could do well, there really aren't any consequences. I wish the survival was more brutal. Make people really on edge, and reconsider attacking at first sight. Drop everything and start from the vault. Get to your body and you can reclaim weapons and armour. That's it.
---
Yeah sell the legendaries youre not using. Trade with ppl. Give to your friends. Etc.
---
I've never seen it but it sounds like Flatwoods Monsters do take control over other creatures. It's funny how Scorchbeasts are always the ones fume out green fog and turn other creatures into scorched but they can actually be under control of a Flatwoods Monster. Alien technology is real.
---
Isn't the explosive gauss a legacy weapon? If so, nice job before the change on that lol
---
And gross joke haha
---
Pretty good chance you'll encounter one doing that pumpkin house mission.
---
Well first off dont use mini nukes on the queen... imo bloody heavy guns wreck the queen.  I went thru 3k rounds killing her with one other person with my 50 cal...In 7 minutes.  I dont even have ultracite rounds.  Once your setup is right, the game becomes easy all except pvp.. I still get wrecked there but I do ok sometimes
---
I have a laser weapon I carry around to deal with low level mobs, but yeah even with all the best mods I can make the thing is no good against things approaching level 50.
---
Less than what Phoenix (Watoga market vendor) sells them for. If you're selling one that you found in a safe then you may struggle to find a buyer, as they're not popular.
---
In what way. I get that you personally dislike that style of gameplay, but you’ve not given us evidence of why
---
Eh not much has changed except new buggy quests and items. TSE still kicks ass tho. My laser is doing well in survival
---
Plus make one shots impossible so it's possible to live and react.
---
Well there's also the actual fighting part...
---
Ditto. I'd never played an online game, let alone a multiplayer game before FO76, even though I've been a gamer since the late 80's. Heck, I'd never had a Reddit account until now either, though I had used it some. I still mainly play solo but I've teamed up quite a bit as well and i do enjoy the group events like SBQ, squatch and nuking WS.  I've had very few bad experiences and a load of good ones. Couldn't have asked for a better game to break thos old dog in on coop
---
The standard for low health effects is normally 30%
---
I hear ya I rp as a insane raider who may even shoot at his own team but that is the hard path you choose so you gotta tough it out or be even better at hiding
---
Ditto
---
You're right. Seems pretty easy to cap out...on caps as it is anyhow :D
---
So that’s why you find it cowardly. You’re role playing. Well guess what, “lone wolf” survival is not a role playing mode. It’s survival. It’s harsh on everyone intentionally. You’re not gonna win if you put your “role playing” first. That’s not how survival works.
---
Pal all my friends are low levels (on PS4) and I'm level 42 and people don't want legendary weapons because they have them
---
&gt;what Phoenix (Watoga market vendor) sells them for. If you're selling one that you found in a safe then you may struggle to find a buyer, as they're not pop
---
ah. ok then ill just learn it :)
---
Rushing in as a group seems well... loud/stat sticky. Solo actually involves more precision.
---
It sucks though, even with full sent/assassin and a bloodied sniper build, when two or more people start lighting me up, I get staggered and die. Nobody has 1v1 me however, and lived to talk about it.
---
To get rid of the scrap junk
---
Nevermind the fact that he’s being downvoted to oblivion
---
If your build is dedicated to lone wolf it should work.
---
I’m sure oblivion is where they took his sweet roll
---
Then drop them dude if no one wants them and you don’t use them they are pointless to keep around. There will be lots of legendary weapons you’ll encounter. Or sell to vendors
---
Oh no, you posted something similar just now on a separate post didn't you
---
Just sell them lol
---
Honor is dead.
---
i feel like sometimes they spawn like crazy, and other times it's sparse.  did it twice this past week, one time we could barely keep up with them, and the extractors got broken a couple times, the other time there was hardly any.   
---
i have a feeling there is some kind of algorithm based on number and level of players that determines the spawns.
---
Yeah. You wanted the other?
---
You say as you make a reddit account. Get on the 76 subreddit, and bitch about how you’re having a tough time on survival because people are playing in teams. Boo-hoo
---
Sell the scrap junk on reddit or to vendors by bulking it. Most junk besides steel you can get like 3 caps per scrap.
---
I can't stand the sights on it or the recoil lol
---
That sounds cool though. How your sniper build set up
---
Actually both times I did the event I encountered the issues the OP stated. The loot pool for the entire game is generally bad but the issue with the event is the players, at least the ones I encountered during the events, not the loot (because if you don't want the loot don't do the even).
---
Either that or xxpssyslayerxx killed him and looted it
---
I was literally going to say Hello Games can do it Bethesda can afford to do. Read half way down and you got it :)

I took an hour working out how to connect those big floor stair things to another one underneath as I was building top to bottom and all it took was adding one of those posts to the first set of stairs for the bottom one to attach to that. 
---
Now while having to put so much effort to just do that I was mighty satisfied when i saw the green and it attached. But yes, I have found so many seemingly simple “snaps” require such a big work around to actually work and for the average builder they would just give up which honestly would cause a lot of people to just be like f^^k it and switch the game off.
---
No I’ll take da sub ! Da Boxes is my gt I’ll be on ina few
---
Actually I didn't find a Reddit on this so I figure see what others think. So I made this post.
---
How about alternatively we make caps actually worth something.
---
How do you tame animals? Is it a perk?
---
That's to funny lol! Just walked past it a couple of hours ago. It would be super cool if we could build drivable cars and bikes in the game, or possibly virtabirds and drones for flight!
---
So sad but true. I'll try to keep the candle lit even though the winds wanna snuff it.
---
&gt; Upon killing an enemy the head will say "Baaaaaaaahhhhh"
---
This would be so damn great lol. I really wish they would add mods for weapons like the Assaultron Head and the Crossbow.
---
Kingsmen secret service would like to know your location

---
Are you saying they nerfed the ‘stand still and never die’ magic armor bullshit? If that’s true kudos to Bethesda. It’s never too late to get rid of the dumbest part of a shooter game.
---
Create bulk ammo.
---
Gosh your right there. (No sarcasm) I'm usually going out noobing it.
---
Because I've played this game way too much and done research, grinded for caps, sold junk until I could afford the weapon I wanted... mainly junk has made me my caps.. I've up traded a few times, but mainly scrapping &amp; selling junk, and daily cleaning out vendor caps selling them misc weapons and bulk junk that players wont buy.  And fire proof is great.  Explosives tickle me
---
Definitely xxpssyslayerxx, we cracked the case OP we can start the which hunt
---
Did it just end? It says until the 13th (which is now), but I'm not seeing it.
---
K good I'll remember to use that perk next time to withstand them 2 shot explosions
---
I got T45 Jet-Pack from every queen since hotfix. :( Was nice the first time.
---
Trust me you’ll get used to it. I’m level 240 rn. Haha
---
Lol was the no sarcasm really sarcasm? Wasn’t trying to be rude just how it is lol survival of the fitest
---
I also take it slow. 212 hrs level 80. All main quests finished. Few side/misc i'm leaving when I want sth to do.
---
Dude. If you’re on Reddit and didn’t know you would lose all those aid items then that is on you. That was known knowledge the day survival went live. Actually, it was the most popular threads that entire week. Thanks to that I didn’t even try it. No where did they say you 15-20%. People learned the first day to not play survival with neither caps nor aid items.
---
Explosive's still one of the best second stars. It's just not monstrously better than anything else like it was before.
---
No I mean the gosh part actually sounds sarcastic I am for real on that comment
---
that worked for 1 day.. now i fall off the cliff when i go to a new server if i log at my camp. 
---
which is why i always go into PA before i log.
---
Btw. Some to you means a whole different amount to me and apparently Bethesda lol. I get your frustration though. It is what it is.
---
That’s kinda the ol not okay but yknow
---
Some shouldn't mean all though
---
Forgive my dumb question but where is said bazaar??
---
Well they haven’t officially said anything but everyone I know with the god armour has said the same thing
---
Will you take yen?
---
True on that.
---
The nerf is still ok with explosives. Just have to rethink your perks. I feel it works just fine
---
Agree with you , but it’s kinda effed
---
Up some of
---
This challenges are un obtainable like the rad storm or the blatantly bugged ones
---
Get outta here
---
Good stuff.  Bethesda needs to hire you to revamp the heavy weapons too!
---
this Post is a little Old but i Found what i Guess i can Call a Glitch what you need to do is go To the Ash heap and get to the Battle Bot Event then once you get to The Area with the Gutsy's Complete the Event then after you have done that it will you give you a amount of screws from 2-9 and go to Main menu and go Back in you will spawn just Outside the Area and the Event May Start once Again great to farm certain ammo and caps As well as XP hope This Helped
---
Also if drop site 9 is where you are fighting. GET OFF THE ROOF. She will not land if the top dpsers are on the roof. She will bug out. And path away. 
---
Also if she is in the air Melee can't hit her. Just move off the roof out of the compound and everything is good. To many fighs I see y'all standing on the roof. I just walk away. Not spending the resouces when she's gonna bug out
---
Legit amazing. But I still despise this "mission"
---
Ghandi? Is that you?
---
r/fo76bazzar
---
If that’s the case thank you Bethesda. Stacking two tier one effect (sentinel + assassin) is a major mess up, it’s like putting bloodied and two-shot in one. Players will abuse it to the max and make it unplayable.
---
Battlestar Galactica?!?!?!?!?!?
---
How much for the field jacket? Is it still available ?
---
I actually made my fallout 76 character ghandi...
---
Sounds like something from the no-no room.
---
This instance cause me to destroy 3!!! Camps all there lined up.    And not to mention they dropped the nuke to miss their bases so the glowing ones didn't even spawn there... I walked up in those camps like Rick James walks on couches
---
I can't find a server with anyone doing this event anymore. Did it once this morning and it failed. Since then, nothing 
---
I don't have any money to get a recall card so I keep waiting for someone else to start it and no one has no matter how many times I server hop and wait.
---
If I knew anything about modding I would definitely try. I got some ideas I wish I knew how to implement in general.
---
😵
---
You guys say this until somebody finds out a way to steal your power armor.
---
On [this map](http://imgur.com/wk8HCSL) was it one of the two by that fissure I mentioned?
---
You are 100% right. People need to just keep shooting a damage immune mob and looting other people's bags.
---
Already over?
---
Yes! Would be nice to not have to weigh out which picture I want to hang onto more when I come across a new broken or bugged out baddie I want to pose next to
---
I feel like we could be friends...
---
Well idk, I dont trade much and kinda just trust that people wont same me. Also I know vendors that'll sell Furious hand made for 500. Also on the 2se fuck knows, they're kind of just a mess now.
---
I agree but the issue then for new players the game would be insanely hard, which it already is pretty hard in  the beginning with no resources and no god rolls
---
They’d need a better way to balance out that mixture of players; maybe a high level only zone that’s like 100+?
---
Haha precisely
---
Tried today with just the game open and after doing a fastravel I needed to drink and crash... :(
---
Oh I understand the online part. That isn't an excuse though. There has been multiple posts on here that mention it and the quest even shows who has the pylons. I applaud you for the patience and time of the guide. Let's hope people take the time to read/watch it.
---
I don't farm Whitesprings so I have nothing to add there but i do see one thing a lot and I have to ask: why do people keep saying you don't get items from the dead if the turrets kill them? I have my camp at the Auto Repair south of Grafton and every time I spawn in my turrets kill the Scorched and I can loot them without me personally ever attacking them.
---
Well just look at OP’s vid, level 200+ camping and shooting a level 32 at spawn in the back and was pissed because it wasn’t as easy he expected. That’s pretty much what those players wearing those bs armors are doing. Shitty game design for shitty gameplay.
---
Yea a 100+ zone would be good. I'm just kind of hoping they'll do something unexpected with the dungeons that'll give the game back some challenge.
---
I just have the standard Realtek Audio drivers, I got a very simple headset. I don't know what is going on but it's driving me crazy.
---
Im waiting for when they finally implement player vending to sell all of my unwanted ammo and excess junk. Tried selling it on here but have had little success
---
This weird animation glitch happens to me all the time. When I switch from my Switchblade to my combat rifle my character spins the rifle like a Switchblade, even happened with a Fat Man once.
---
Is the fight still going?
---
You have to actually talk to big once a day to trigger the repeatable quests. They dont just pop up.
---
Ya join up I added you
---
Already did, I think I'm not getting any response till Monday since I post the ticket on weekend.. Hope they can help me and I can go back to play.
---
Are you also aware that without being able to mod weapons/armor and join a game of a friend through the SOCIAL menu because of bug issues you've reduced this AAA, $60+ game to a barely playable version of Fallout 4. Bethesda should be kissing the feet of the fans still trying to make good with their subpar product. STOP ADDING GARBAGE AND FIX THE CORE MECHANICS!!... WHY WOULD I WANT TO NAME WEAPON/ARMOR THAT HAS BEEN GARBAGE THE PAST 4 LEVELS BECAUSE I CANT MAKE IT BETTER WITH MODS?!?... I got this game to play with my friends and I cant even do that now. Pull your heads out of yours cornholes and get it done.
---
You wouldn't think it, but those cards weigh 1 pound each. Good to have a few, but they can quickly eat away at your carry weight if you're not paying attention.
---
Is it the Tinker's Workbench noise? I was having a glitch where I heard that sound effect loudly and randomly and it took me forever to realize that's what it was. Sounded like grinding and then a train...
---
I’ve managed to get this numerous times since last patch,. Found it helpful to just select item above or below what your using within the menu and deselect what you want. Most often it would automatically place in the world without clicking. I thought it was a lag issue
---
Once again you're showing your bias is false. Done the event 3x in the past 24 hours. 2x was on someone else's dime. Once on mine. That's a 66.6% probability that you are Full. Of. Shit. Continue on though, your fallacy is almost amusing at this point ; ) .
---
Welcome to the wasteland
---
125 if I keep them on me ;)
---
The 20s are the hardest levels. Once you get to 30 and can get starched genes and marsupial, the game gets better.
---
Someone forgot their huffing supplies.
---
Tbh. Just scaling the max damage down would be enough.  Sure the bloodied one hit wonder builds take a hit. But who honestly cares. Sans for the ones that treat the high dps builds like a messiah. 
---
Either pull base damage down or reduce the scaling of additives you can achieve
---
I feel your pain. Ive also have had to take all three pylons while trying not to get killed and beating the boss. Sucks how some people will run right passed you if youre downed but expect you to help them out.
---
Mind if I keep my weapons on me.just have a lot to sift through. np if no.
---
Huh. I thought it was just me.  I get fucked all the time
---
As long as you are using a weapon that you don't have a legendary version of
---
If you've got 45s and are on Xbox I'd give you a legendary item or two
---
Oh wow that's impressive
---
Okay
---
Ya so if I wear excavator with calibrated shocks then I still get +77.5
---
I'm pretty sure that is part of the question to get the Quantum paint for X-01 PA. But I usually drink when I play so I don't always remember correctly.
---
I'm amazed by how many players completely ignore the mobs of robots. Like hello, five Gutsys are shooting you directly in the butt and you're just running around shooting at the one enemy you can't hurt? Are you dumb?
---
I've done the event maybe 20 times by now and only once or twice did we have a good cohesive group that got the job done quickly without too many deaths. Although it seems more players are running to the pylons and making sure we get that done before anything else, so that's good. In the beginning I was often carrying all the pylons by myself and just hoping to stay alive/get a shot in on the imposter.
---
I've leveled up like crazy the last few days because it seems very few players are taking out the Gutsys, either during or especially after the event. Joke's on them, there's usually at least one legendary Gutsy in the mix. Frustrating but whatever, more XP for me.
---
You don't actually have to level up three times. What the game is actually asking you to do is level up under a specific circumstance, and these circumstances stack with each other. If you are able to fit the criteria for three of them at the same time, you'll be able to complete the challenge with one level up.
---
Not gonna happen. Read the Inside the Vaults. They said they were going to implement a way to convert ammo.
---
It's not 3 different times its 3 different ways 
---
Can be all done in 1 level read the challenge
---
Same here. I did it this morning with a friend (we're both slightly over level 100 each) who triggered it for free and only three other players showed. We failed. I'll only do it again if someone else starts it and I see eight or more high levels doing it.
---
Do perks go beyond the team and into randoms within the same event?
---
I craft a lot of .308, .50 cal and 5mm - different guns for different moods - and it’s always the lead that runs out first. I had a camp next to a lead deposit at one time... I need to go back to it. I moved for a junk deposit - not worth it.
---
You choose to play the game on easy mode by powergaming your build.  
---
You should adapt to the game so that you can get the experience you want. The game doesn't need to adapt to cater to you.
---
Bloodied + what is the best combo. I currently had a tse gauss, and a tse combat shotty. How is the PvP now? Is the new pvp mode viable with tse's?
---
Excavator also gets an extra 100 carry weight, which is the real perk.
---
I don't think you at all read the post. No where in there did I say anything about loot being acceptable. Nor did I act like Bethesdas event is even acceptable. We though are given an event that requires specifics things to be done that aren't being done. The fact you go of on a tangent completely unrelated to the conversation is why its a circle jerk comment. I feel like you are about to post some clickbaity YT about how Bethesda did you wrong.  So either you have never actually have done the event or you are the luckiest person to play this game. Though if you are that lucky I wouldn't expect you to be complaining about the loot then...
---
X01 has a unique recon sensor helmet mod that allows you to track targets easily, even when they’re blocked by terrain or structures. This is very useful in heavily wooded areas like cranberrybog. I use Excavator most of the time, X01 would be my 2nd.
---
It only lets me spawn at vault 76

*Alright lets try this again since my ebay link got my first reply removed...*
---
Thanks, I'm glad you appreciated it! :)
---
I'm honestly surprised it's tied to the remote facepalm I presume it's a specific button on it that does the changes, and that's why it can't be done via TV controls?
---
Even then, I'm with you, I'm not sure any of those 4 modes are going to do what you're after; however, "Wide" may indeed do it. So fingers crossed! Push come to shove, there's always this: ***search ebay for Seiki SE39UY04 remote***
---
&gt;sick of waiting for people to activate the pylons so i usually end up doing all three and spamming stim-paks till the end of the event
---
This was me this morning. Spent a small fortune in stimpaks and we lost anyway. No idea what anyone else was doing. Not rezzing me when I went down, that's for sure.
---
I'm going to admit I've only done the SBQ successfully like 10 times (without my server failing I mean), but every single time people are on the roof and she's never flown off except her normal rotation. She always lands, she always takes off, and then lands again.
---
either or would be nice to be honest
---
me and my friend play a lot together so we leave the game on area and use discord for team chat if we get to far apart but I'd rather a in game solution
---
yes i agree. if you want to tell me that laser weapons didnt work. then why are they available. LASER weapon should SHRED stuff. i have a gouls lever that smokes my instigating laser weapon. its just a numbers game, but really bethesda? you think that the weapons created after the black powder rifle would suck less than them?
---
I have my camp on a acid deposit, so I just get a workshop set up at lakeside cabins (for lead and Crystal) and grind breach and clear missions end of my gaming session, lead is not a problem.
---
Noticed something is off, the environment seems... strange at times. I have to double check what I'm looking at, sometimes it looks like I'm looking through myself stealthed even though I'm in first person and dont have it, trees seem 'stretched' but not a lot... just like a little odd, shadows have appeared as squares or in strange positions or just 'off' from the usual.
---
with bethesda you need to tape a deathclaw to a stick and keep poking them with it till they notice
---
You can delete the makeshift "blueprint" yourself, it then places all individual items back into your stored tab.
---
Ps4 you hit square and scrap it all in one go.
---
Ill take that! Im going big guns! Got my perks up so that they weigh 2-4 lbs each lol... Love my shotgun but like to have alot of carry capacity!
---
Yup
---
That's tragic
---
Don’t fuck with the elderly ladies and gentlemen
---
I think I've seen them around before but I can't remember where. Maybe in Cranberry Bog.
---
I actually like this idea, though it'll probably end up pushing people to one type of weapon unless they're balanced to a knifes edge.
---
Where and how do you find these?! I have all the hats, but I only find white and weathered dresses!
---
I just want a way to display all the dumb Stuffed Bears I've collected.
---
I like the randomness of it. One day I was getting some dirty water and caught Healing Factor. Soon after, I spawned into a nuke zone and got nothing but a strong burning sensation. It's a nice surprise when the genes get a little choppy.
---
Do the traders caps reset every 24 hours?
---
PlayStation, sorry man. I totally would if I was xbox : ) thanks for the offer

I found something similar in the... place where they tested Stuff pre-war, with the Flora labeled room and syringers.
---
Miscellaneous recipes with those names that aren't actually recipes pretty sure same name.
---
I don’t really feel like getting my alt banned just to prove a point. Duping something doesn’t flag you it’s the amount that gets you flagged.
---
Ah yea, that makes sense. That lakeside workshop is a sweet one. I usually do that or a junkyard depending on needs.
---
Is there any way to do the event if it bugged out
---
We have players from other fallout games: solo play
---
We have players from games such as destiny: team work = face roll and run in
---
We have players from games such as “old school” wow: team work = mechanics
---
Unfortunately most of the population falls into the first 2 categories which means they have no concept of actual team work by sticking around in the vicinity of the battle and using mechanics, wether it be pylons, tanking, adds, healer, etc. 
---
all we can hope is the players that can use and know mechanics can pass on knowledge (as not all players read reddit) but then this requires mics and a level of participation beyound what is required for most of the current game. I’m glad the game currently doesn’t have “matching” mechanics, as this would lead to more frustration then gaining a team easier. Best bet is to look for a like minded team on reddit or similar LFG platforms
---
So it's right by a fissure. I only hit up the one further east most of the time because there's usually Scorchbeasts in the area. That is one of the spots I regularly check though, played since the beta. I think it's just as likely to spawn there as any other Cryptid spot, I've just never seen one there.
---
It's a good time to learn about letting stuff go. It's just stuff; there's plenty more out there. Figure out what you need and sell or dump the rest. It might get a little better when player vending actually happens, but even then the market for legendary rolling pins is pretty small.
---
I find that a strange way to look at it. I do I agree that the amount of damage Im doing is ridicules and should probably be nerfed down to half, but the fact you think strong players should just make themselves weaker instead of Bethesda adding more high lvl content is just strange to me.
---
I kinda get what youre talkin about but Ive been thinking this ever since I was doing 300 damage, the games too easy for high lvls in my opinion.
---
They seriously nerfed crafting in this game compared to 4, and it's very sad.
---
Can you craft anything with the head plan? I looked through all my menus and never found any indication of a new craftable item being unlocked. I even checked the assaultron head weapon for a new skin option, but no.
---
Love this idea
---
I take it you're on pc?
---
On ps4 i just use the share button to save out my pics
---
Yes I am! You tryna hunt? lol
---
I honestly don't know, but I would think so since today there is a challenge to play h/h while in a group.
---
Cap limit and stash limit should definitely increase with players’ levels. Right now it’s like giving kids and adults the same quota for their bank accounts. It’s such a joke that they want players to play the game for 7600 hours yet they don’t expect their assets to grow with the time spent.
---
Loooooooool I hate how accurate this is
---
Does this look better, and I wasn't really planning on a bloodied build, I just put serendipity as like a last resort just in case I get super low or something like that
---

---
You aren't strong. You are so absolutely weak that you need to powergame your build to compensate for your weakness.
---
I wasn't trying to be funny but if your barrier for humor is so low I'll take it.  You play your way Mr. Embarrassed (a name your parents surely gave you) and I'll play mine.  You aren't the rule maker or the final word on the matter.  An open ended game can be played any way one wants.  But if feeling important gets you though the day I'm here to tell you you aren't and your opinion means nothing to me.  Let me know if its cold an lonely on that mountaintop buddy.  Actually save it.  I already know it is.
---
I think so. I have read it's every 20 hours, but am not for sure on that.
---
Thanks.
---
You stole my loot.
---
Tell me what you’ve got, I might make you an offer (PS4). ;)
---
Well make sure to at least tag the boss even if you focus on the trash.
---
Yeah all day today. All my sound also went out sometimes during the sheepsquatch event
---
Can you craft me all of the serums, I have all of the materials required. Name is curiex81
---
ugh i totaly bought it after seeing the single stair then realized it should have the platform version also but its bugged it shows in camp UI to unlock it even if you bought it then fails to link to atomic shop if u try to rebuy it any way :(
---
I don't do that, but every time I try to farm Whitespring it's flooded with bloodied melee builds running around at the speed of light killing stuff before you can tag.
---
Delete your mods. Delete the fallout76custom.ini files. There is one at c/users/you/documents and settings/my games. Don't forget that one.
---
Thank you!
---
I'm on xbox, but it's just easier to have them in a collective spot
---
Well ok then, I think you're taking this game a little too seriously bud.
---
Thanks for the help ill give it a try.
---
Are you on now? Add me jims1973
---
I’ll sign on real quick and take care of you. Otherwise I won’t be on again for another 12 hours.
---
Never know when you'll get that gun that you just want to start using. Like just recently I got an AA combat rifle, decided to put my TSE Gauss down to use an automatic weapon and luckily I had 8k .45 ammo to go with it.
---
Really isn't that hard to wear a responders outfit, a Fasnacht mask and be over level 76 or carry a protest sign or any one of the other conditions all at the same time when you start sneaking up to the level rollover.
---
Do you have Power Patcher equipped when in power armor? 
---
I don't understand why you want it to break faster. There are easier ways to get XP than repairing power armor.
---
Just sent you an friend invite
---
Oh I definitely do. Now that more players seem to get the jist of the event, I find myself not needing to be on pylon duty as much which frees me up to slaughter Gutsys and then go back to pounding on the imposter.
---
Haha ya man I’ve never done this quest
---
No not equipped. I want the maximum Ballistic Resistance.
---
Think I found the same in West Tek. At least similar name.
---
What’s the amount they were dropping? Tens of thousands? Millions?
---
Yeah we’re on Xbox but he’s tried everything and the scrap all in one go isn’t working.
---
If OP doesn't take you up on that offer, I will. Would gladly pay or trade if you're looking for anything. Won't be on till around 9 Pacific time.
---
This is entirely the problem of why they're so impotent. Anti-armor needs a fix on energy weapons and rad weapons. It's been 5 months. This should be fixed already
---
Lol. When you wrote that were you like "yeah, this'll really get that stranger on the internet all riled up"? Ooo, I'm so *embarrassed* by my user name. Bazinga? Yuck. You just keep trying to repair your gear in power armor guy.
---
Sylvie &amp; Sons logging camp is a great spot to get wood. Can quickly get well over 100 in one trip.
---
Accepted. Please join me and ft to me. I’ll make you’re serums. :)
---
Well yes, but they clearly were able to dish out more damage faster
---
Hey bud I'm ps4 and my new character is lvl 33 if ur down for grouping psn: jocc122
---
I keep crashing when trying to lock pick, been happening since last patch. So I just quit lock picking til I can figure something out.
---
its a glitch that came with the newest patch
---
Agreed. Half the time when you go back to the spot you killed the thing, there will be  a meat pile with your 1\* wooden left leg in it, though.
---
Only tried with PA, but after backing in and out over and over because of this issue, the issue was suddenly fixed when I changed the paint on my PA before I repaired a piece.
---
I'd rather have a way to repurpose ammo than sell it anyways! Already plenty to sell, right? Hopefully this happens sooner than later.
---
It's happened often 😭
---
Streams. I'm streamer
---
Just finished the event again. I was 2/3 conduits multiple times and when I was downed I had one guy come up to me and try and finish me off before buggering off to be unhelpful to someone else. I did manage to get revived twice though but once was because I had got to my second pylon just before someone else and I got downed right in front of him. We got it done but it was with less than 90 seconds left
---
Condition and damage resistance are not the same. As long as it's above 100 condition, you are getting the full effect of the armor.
---
I gave up on "naturally" getting mutated and now just buy them. :/
---
See, you just went straight to the gutter with that.  I, on the other hand, thought "Free Puppies".
---
Yep. No guarantee, but could be, but won’t be more than one star.
---
I have yet to officially beat the sheepsquatch. Just keeps disconnecting at the end. I'm out of caps.
---
With a high enough energy resist/stealth build, one person can tank all 3 pylons at once. I do it with my main everytime.
---
Bethesda haven't shown themselves to be capable of balancing a game, so unfortunately that's what you have to do. Pick your own difficulty level.
---
If they raised the difficulty level in general, it'd also cut off all the people who don't like the playstyle of any of the overpowered builds. For example, if you like to aim your own shots, want to use a gun with an actual sight and don't enjoy running low HP then there are no competitive options for you.
---
Thanks again for the crafting service, really appreciate it.
---
Pro-Tip:
---
Field Surgeon
---
First Aid
---
Cola Nut
---
np bud just msg me when u get on i have one for you GT : Tanaas
---
That worked. I like pain train, but that was a pain in the ass
---
I've got 5 of those
---
That too ^
---
Flip passive mode on?
---
I’m sure people wouldn’t recreate 9/11
---
Cheers, catch you later!
---
No but you dont have to be in pacifist if you dont attack back
---
A lot of 1 star items are better than fancy 3 star ones (such as junkies + bash damage and reduced weight but still weighs six pounds).
---
My method of getting them is to go to hemlock holes and in one of the toxic ponds there are 30 rads a second. I strip naked, make sure I haven't taken radx, and that starched genes 2 is off, and then get one. 
---
I then server hop and repeat.  You can only get one mutation at a time this way.  So you have to hop. 
---
I do this often. Too often.
---
He didn't 2 shot me. Watch the video. My health doesn't move until the blow that kills me.
---
+karma My pleasure, stop by anytime and thanks for the caps!
---
Yup, that's a problem as well. People need to be aware of their surroundings and tone it down if others are trying to farm as well.
---
945 hours lvl 237
---
That fair enough, I know I will have to do that if I want more challenge but there's just something deeply annoying to me about handicapping myself to get more challenge out of a game instead of  them balancing it or making harder events and challenges.
---
Hasn't happened to me on ps4 the 5 or so times I've done it
---
Love this but make it a misc (non droppable) and a product that is only obtained through trade.
---
Eg: platinum that is originally traded for caps through an npc robot. Then can be traded back at same value to npc robot or fellow vault dwellers. 
---
I personally wouldn’t wouldn’t want gold or silver in this format as it is used for certain recipes/plans
---
It's a matter of selling something you have to someone who wants what you have some people will pay an exorbitant amount of caps for the item that they really want. And that is how people wind up with a load of caps.
---
Explosive is still the best secondary with full demo expert. I think vats crit is the runner up. Pvp is pretty brutal to be honest, most of the time you run into tse or e wielding people and they are easy to put down. It's the people who know what they're doing, wearing cavalier/assassin sentinel/assassin, fully pvp specced and using all available advantages (stealth boys, berry mentats, etc.)
---
If you are like me and prepared for pvp, then it is a blast, even running into an ass/sent mirror match, it becomes a bloodbath of revenge seeking and chaos everywhere. 
---
Its what 76 should have been from the beginning. 
---
My highest killstreak was 40 something. And I fell to my death without even being in combat lol. They also fixed the spawn camping, until you fire your weapon, you have a period of invulnerability after spawn. You can use this to position, run, track someone, or whatever. 
---
Be weary of train stations, especially whitespring station, they tend to be the areas of concetrated killing.
---
Use tactics to your advantage, players are not just more enemies to gun down, sometimes you will make an ally, and sometimes dangerous enemies. Hide in the bushes, use real camo clothing on character, stay hidden MOST of the time, unless you can tank 3-4 explosive rounds, then retaliate. 
---
Its usually fair, normal fighting, then a Sent/assassin shows up and starts dropping everyone, the people who notice will tend to ignore eachother and gang up to take out the guy. Overall, it's loads of fun, you can never breathe easy, even sitting at camp, and bounties are different, they aren't a bad thing, so much as another way to brag, like the leaderboards.
---
&gt;and gathering actual ore is somewhat time consuming 
---
Depends on what ore you need. Lead? Ultra common, and easiest to find in Lucky Hole Mine. If you take the secret path to the back area where the Lovecraftian creature is there's a hallway that has a ton of lead ore nodes. With Excavator, you can easily get around 100+ lead ore within a few minutes. Smelted down, I average 300+ lead from a single run using  Super Duper. The only downside is, as you said: acid. But if you need ammo it's ultra efficient and a super quick to run. But you'll never want for lead again.
---
Plus there seems to be a higher chance of legendaries spawning in the mine, especially towards the start. I've come across a few 3\* cave crickets in there while farming lead.
---
You know that a piece of armor repaired above 100% has more ballistic resistance than one at 100 or below, yes?
---
You know that the maximum bonus resistance occurs at 200% and decreases down to the base armor resistance as condition approaches 100%, yes?
---
I don’t know what you’re referring to as the “full effect” but ballistic resistance is absolutely tied to condition between 100 and 200% condition.
---
I didn't notice that you had no Starched Genes. Speed Demon and especially Marsupial are powerful defensive mutations for PvE rifle builds, and they're also a lot of fun.
---
Did you really just brag about your entire life revolving around reddit? Cool for you.... I guess.
---
Grape mentats, recon pip, tesla... There are many ways to counter it
---
pvp in fo76 is not person vs person, its perks vs perks. which means levels are virtually meaningless. Weapons and armor are important, but not a deciding factor. A well placed shot from anything means nothing, sneak, team tactics mean nothing. All that matters is stacking perks. I think Bethesda really failed at what they wanted this adventure game to be. At first they were anti-greifing, now its anything goes. Reguardless if you like or dislike pvp, any gamer knows that when a level 80 can own a level 200 because of perks, and charactor build, that part of the game is unrealistic and broken. I hope they fix it, I too like the game. But I see why so many people are leaving it.
---
Real gold has uses irl too. I do like your idea as well! Thx for the reply.
---
Oh I've also been getting heaps of sound bugs. Often when I do sheepsquatch all my sfx drop and the music is incredibly loud!
---
I got a SBQ Adrenal Recipe after it was available in the Enclave.
---
(Got a nice T-60 Jetpack in a SBQ fight today also.  Used up 3K of 50 cal and then 400+ shotgun shells but think it was a fair trade).
---
This mod is supposed to provide a fix but I haven't tried it yet: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285?tab=description](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/285?tab=description)
---
No? Obviously you don't have good reading comprehension. Let's try again in small words you can understand.
---
Me on reddit 2 year.
---
Me have many comment people like.
---
Me have big score.
---
Me not spend all time on reddit.
---
You're not at full health. You're missing a bit to rads, then your health bar ticks down as you do energy damage to yourself on the first hit (thanks to electrically charged), then you get laid out by the killing blow. Had you been at full health to begin with, it wouldn't have been a 1 shot. 
---
It's in the video and you can verify it yourself. You can also do some of your own testing on a character with 1 endurance, full health, and see what the damage cap is. It's there.
---
"  If this is any indication how this community is going to play when Raids/Dungeons come out we are fucked. "
---
well most of them console player and have only single player experience. what do u except?
---
You know you can only acquire one mutation in each game session? After each mutation, you have to log off and back on if you want another.
---
Yes u can do it against your team I tried it earlier
---
I have an amazing rolled 3 star assasin assaultron head. Just waiting for it to be useful.
---
Lol nice
---
I appreciate the effort but caution that the assaultron head’s unique charging mechanic makes it easy for it to get out of hand if you add too many variables. Much as I like mods, I’d like them to get the core fixed first. 
---
Also it is currently a pistol. Whether it should be or not is a fair question.
---
Omw
---
My only charisma perk is Quack Surgeon. I carry many bottles just to get downed people drunk and back on their feet.
---
My friends love it in survival mode.
---
Definitely agree with this too but irl I don’t die and drop my loot/aid.
---
And if I accidentally drop my gold irl I also have insurance (not available in game)
---
Not trying be a smartarse, merely just trying to say. If implementing your great idea, I personally believe it would have to be a new item and make it non droppable (unless of course you can’t pay your bounty)
---
They are part of the lying low quest.
---
I got your fixer plans
---
That's not patched. There was even a [post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/) debunking 1 shots to non-hostiles *except* in this single case. [I was the person that encouraged the OP to test that scenario](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aw9z88/psa_slap_damage_results_of_an_extensive_although/ehmrdee/). This is what happened. It's not a true one shot, but it is an exploit.
---
I use a stealth build on my main character. Just grab all three pylons and chill. It's super easy to manage the damage when no other monster can detect you. Get u a silenced non-explosive gun and relax.
---
You can craft them on the chemistry benches  at Arktos Pharma, the recipes are there as well. Don't think you can do anything with them at the moment, probably later content.
---
I’ve never been able to successfully complete the event. Either my game freezes after I die and I have to reload in, or we fail, or someone just decides to engage me in pvp right before it ends and steal all my stuff. I’m taking a break now after the last jackass took all my stuff the only time I would have competed the event successfully. 
---
(I had accidentally shot him but moved away and didn’t do it again and I had even revived him twice before but he just really wanted to be a jerk I guess)
---
&gt;one of the items I received after completing the event was a schematic for a large generator, so 10 power/ea.
---
(quoting my post you replied to ;))
---
Haha good stuff
---
World events are a mess. It sounds like dungeons will be single groups (1-4) so I think they’ll be easier to coordinate. We’ll find out soon.
---
You said you had imposter head too.. how much
---
But now he lives forever. As a part of you...
---
I saved up so much ammo &amp; junk for player vending just to get shafted :-(
---
My most successful runs (in general, not just bosses) have been in a team of 2.
---
Dunno what you're talking about. Survival is always 23 vs. 1
---
How much for fixer plans?
---
Negro please, this has been said a thousand times.
---
&gt;You know in Fallout 3 and New Vegas(and 1,2, and Tactics) all weapons had hard locked in skill and strength requirements
---
Console commands.
---
&gt; If high level mobs are spawning in a low level area you need to be in.
---
That's why I went to another game, because it seems every area besides the starter zone is one I shouldn't be in. There's also no server jump button. There's mainly bad game design that pairs me with servers filled with people over level 100, which could easily be programmed better, too bad the A team isn't working on this game.
---
&gt; Enemies can give your position away to their group, but if you take one down silently before the others notice, you stay hidden 
---
Cool story, so why can they find me instantly after I jumped off the roof and move behind a container? Maybe one of them saw me even though normally I can sneak up in front of them with no issue until engaging. Bad game logic. Shouldn't they just be chilling on the roof? Also, when throwing a knife and oneshotting them, they all know exactly where it was from, because zombies are super intelligent and can figure out knife physics from the angle of the scream of a dying enemy.
---
I never even thought of the junk. Good catch! I was serious though, thanks for the reply!
---
😁
---
It's stopping the rest of the whole server from being able to battle those NPCs and claim any legendary gear / glowing mass / hardened mass because one selfish person decided to prevent them from having the chance. 
---
It's possibly the single most densely populated 30 square metres on the map, packed with legendaries, when it's nuked. Taking that away from a couple of dozen people when that one person can't be bothered to even do it themself? Yeah, they are dicks. Destroy these. All of them. Give people a chance to fight the ghouls and claim rewards.
---
Nope. There are no safes involved with the quantum paint steps, and definitely not the one shown.
---
This.
---
I’ve thought this after they dropped survival. How about a high level permanent nuke zone. High level mob, tougher multi tasking for rads, food, water. Slightly less rads then a nuke zone in normal mode and then an extreme zone when you launch a nuke here. Purely pve as it would be an easy pvp zone
---
This is hilarious. Did the same thing, had to remove that card real quick! 😂
---
Well shit, like I said, I should really play sober sometime. Thanks for setting me straight.
---
I guess I should have stated I'm on PC. Also that's like saying no one that's played Destiny on console could coordinate. I though feel it's silly to say because someone's console they shouldn't have knowledge/experience at something.
---
If u mix plague walker maybe reason...
---
"when hit this house cloaks for 60 seconds"
---
Let's hope.
---
While we're at it..just ask for infinite carry weight..or..why not just give us infinite ammo too and the guns don't need to be repaired either
---
Bruh this is annoying stop
---
What I did is a logged created a new character in got naked walked out vault reached flatwoods wore responders outfit and I got a mask from
---
Atom store boom less then 10 minutes after done
---
It's worth no more than 500 caps
---
I’ve never noticed a difference.  I think all shared.   I haven’t taken much in the mire or cranbog tho.
---
Bro we call them beepy bois to
---
Lol I guess this is over?
---
Yes this. Two nukes tonight at Whitesprings and both times there was at least one person running around 1 hitting everything before we could even get a shot in. I ended up trying to spray explosive rounds at them to hope for splash damage but it wouldn't really work.
---
Well done on your bloody builds, people. But next time try letting other people get rewards too.
---
Try turning on pacifist mode(obviously unless you are in survival). I had the issue you had until I enabled it.
---
Legit reminds me of playing ESO and quitting dungeons because the DPS or tank wouldn't follow the boss mechanics.
---
Fully expect that with Burrows, Ive now run the new event 9 times, 2 completions, and I've counted 4 total people acting as pylon (myself 1/4).
---
It's whack.
---
Bad
---
You can drop 2 points of concentrated fire/PER (to 13). The 2 extra points in Concen. only give 4% extra damage, you'd be better served with 2 additional AGI/LCK points and perks.
---
Everyone being drunk would at least be some kind of an excuse
---
Are u PS4
---
It’s the same loot and combat mechanics from level 1-200 nothing changes except a few legendary items
---
acid is bad enough; even if you are super dilligent with looting everything tagged with it exclusively and have a workshop &amp; camp spawned on it.
---
Events like Breach &amp; Clear are nice in concept and gathing the ore itself "feels good" that there's a better/alternate way than server hopping and dashing in silos; personally I never really want for ammo as I usually use Strength perks for either fist or melee of some sort to fall back on.
---
Meanwhile my level 32 self is activating the pylons because it's about all I can do. Can't tell people its invincible with them off....
---
...only fallout 76
---
To clarify: whether or not they are fair for both of the parties involved, I wholeheartedly believe OP can find a seller for all the items they are looking for at the listed prices
---
It ok, there’s always Anthem.👍
---
Speed Demon and Marsupial are fairly standard for rifle builds, although Marsupial requires some adjustment. I ran both of those without Class Freak: Marsupial's penalty has easy workarounds, and Speed Demon just burns through a bit more food and water. Thru Hiker would be better value than Class Freak just for that.
---
Eagle Eyes should be really good for a VATS build. I'm not sure if SPECIALs can go negative, so you might not need Class Freak for that either. Similar for Bird Bones.
---
Adrenal Reaction's great if you're running mid-to-low HP, but it does really need Class Freak.
---
lol
---
Its okay theres always alien colonial marines
---
Enclave bunker, military wing. Check all the desks. I've found as many as four in one run
---
I agree that the weapon degradation is painful, even with weapon artisan 3 + Int 10 + gunsmith 5. And the ammo grind can be a chore. But otherwise, I love it. I like it desolate. For the events where I need to find other players, I can find them.
---
That game deserves GOTY. Hell it deserves game of the decade. Best game ever made 10000/10.
---
Make a new character that doesn't have the quest.
---
Go to the Enclave bunker/military wing. 
---
In the desks is usually a few.
---
You can stack them if you don't have the quest active. Hand them to a friend or use second PS4 for transfers.
---
It's all RNG. I had a dry spell at the beginning (got nothing) , got two in a row, another shortly thereafter, and seem to be on another dry run now for paints. I did get some outfits lately though. Just keep turning them in.
---
1000% daily iron consumption
---
Might want to link it first...
---
Yes I have. It’s no Destiny killer.
---
And that's great. If you can get pylons going and then lay on the dps the adds might not be an issue. I have had a few go like that but I've seen too many times where 1-2 people having to take pylons and tank adds as someone runs around like an idiot dragging the boss off into the wilderness.
---
Huh, we are not playing the same game. What system you on? I add friends all the time.
---
That's nasty.....
---
If you dont want pvp in adventure..dont claim workshops. And there isnt any power difference between a lvl50 and 300. Its all just gear.
---
No, I'm xbox.
---
Ahh ok I wanted to buy some water lol
---
From the normal Spawn point. Go straight west. You'll have to jump over a rail. Then follow the "tunnel" and turn rslight right. There's a video up on YouTube.
---
Yeah, I still dont know how people do that much damage. I do like 1/5 the damage you do on my melee guy. I dont use radicool or the low hp stuff on my armor, and I'm not mutated. None of that interests me. So I'm not really looking for enemies to have more hp.
---
Oh sorry then. I sell mainly to vendor bots. I let anyone take water from my purifiers and junk extractor items for free. I'm sorry I can't let you do that.
---
Thx bruh it's cool
---
This
---
That's what I'm afraid of. I'm glad they are saying it can be done possibly 1-4. I have a couple of friends so we can hopefully get it done. The raids though if they require any sort of decent coordination are going to be a site to see.
---
Seriously.  I'm baffled why they thought that having voice chat and emotes as the only forms of communication would work well.
---
Yeah, seems like another event where you have to check the server first or have a full group of decent players. I did one a few hours ago and the Sheepsquatch's body got blown of the hill by an explosion. No one found the body so no decent loot.
---
Enjoy the wasteland and may you find clean drinking water, my Ps4 counterpart!
---
First part: Yeah. I feel like you do need a team-mate to make it less lonely, and I'm normally fine with solo games. Unless you have friends who play the game, I don't think it works.
---
Second part: Nah, there's some mild challenge to overcome, but it's fundamentally an easy game. Main issue these days is that all quests point to Whitesprings &amp; Pleasant Valley, which is a balance disaster due to monsters being scaled up by nearby higher-level players. Go check out other parts of the map and things work a lot better.
---
I mean he does... He has 50.
---
That worked! Thanks!
---
I use all those things, Ill probably get rid of most of them soon though since I've gone a bit far with  my damage.
---
Even if you have a workshop, 94% of the time people wont bother you... unless you're sitting in the workshop being an easy target (in adventure mode)
---
Lol my bad [https://imgur.com/a/jK6upwa](https://imgur.com/a/jK6upwa)
---
During Sheepsquatch or SBQ, mine is.
---
I mean it started off with me just trying to get to 500 but then I keepted going and going
---
Mine is all the time.. every ten seconds a spike 😫
---
Maybe lvl 80-100 and 300 but there are plenty of cards you do not have access to until upper 40s or lvl 50 that increase power.
---
Has anyone gotten anything other than the wolf, yau gai, bird, and radstag mounts?
---
Sheepsquatch can be brutal.
---
It’s the times when people do that it’s a problem. I’m just trying to make ammo but a surprisingly high percentage of the time I end up getting involved in pvp because a level 200 decides to be an ass.
---
Hey maybe instead of using gfcat use YouTube instead. This way you can post however long of a video you want.
---
You are a good man
---
I call them bleeps, like a censored expletive. "Damn, that *bleep* won't go away."
---
Uh there's no such thing as slap damage now, you have to fight back for them to kill you lol. Don't take workshops, do the PvP events, or go into Hunter/Hunted Radio. This seems like a troll post tbh
---
cooking oil too.
---
i love my fashnacht donuts (especialy since they dont spoil for whatever reason)
---
Yeah, but oddly enough it hasn't crashed me. Queen did, which sucks.
---
Thats if you dont plan ahead..and in those cases I recommend not claiming a workshop.
---
I'm sorry for your loss. If it makes you feel any better I killed it twice today and got T45 and T60 jetpack plans, and 3 prime plans.
---
Find someone that uses the stuff you drop and vice versa. Also the r/market76 to sell it on.
---
Sadly your fellow pve players cried and cried till they convinced the devs to remove all risk from survival so they could get the xp without losing caps. Guess where kills are worth more now? Yep adventure, you can make 3x the caps killing a player or players with work shops in adventure now. Expect more blown up bases and work shop deaths.
---
My point wasn't negative - that he had done anything wrong.  It was that I was amazed at there being people that have put so much time into the game and still going.
---
Workshops are pvp zones, it even tells you when you take them
---
omg those fucking beepers again.
---
Have you tried asking for help?  Every time I see a thread of someone saying "I'm new and having problems"  multiple people are willing to help, myself included.  This game, like life, is what you make it.  Put in your time and ask for help. And for me, I did my research on the game and now it'smuch easier. ... My first month was struggle because I didn't really dig the team thing, I like to figure things out on my own, but ever since being active on trade pages I've made quite a few friends
---
Set the washer to delicates also.
---
If youre looking to sell them to vendors I can spam craft you some. 200 caps each, should yield you a profit on sell.
---
not yet
---
Badass af
---
Some kind of brag? I couldn't really care less. I want to hunt monsters for the sake of it.
---
Don't forget when she flies off the map and you can see her but not kill her.
---
True! I'll put them up on the vendor when we get the player vending in the next big patch.
---
Im at 250 and got the impression i was slow, approaching 900 hours.
---
The big clinking sound you hear is the robot army being fastly rebuilt by the cylinders. Since when the nuke hit all bots get destroyed.   Had the same thing happen in the Enclave bunker after a glitch made all robots die at the same time.
---
I mostly get lag from everyone panic Fast Traveling to the Event! Xbox isn't too bad otherwise. I have yet to deal with the Queen though, so maybe that will change!
---
I play slow, I don’t power lvl just let it come and enjoy pve
---
She can land on the roof. Crippling her wings will make her land if people are doing their job.
---
I'd suggest Combat Armor for the Vitamin C
---
You should join the nukacrypt people and help brute-forcing the codes! The keycards are the hardest part of the process.
---
its just nice to see someone at similar level with the similar hours. :)
---
It wasn't a brag. It was an attempt to make you feel better knowing you can get something good when not expecting it. Take it how you want, but lay in the misery you create for yourself.
---
I like this idea... even though I lured a yau gaui to someone's base today and he died fighting it and dropped a ton of junk... whoops!  But he did come after me, as he rightfully should... that was my asshole move of the day lol... I didn't think he was gonna die tbh, but it was too funny.. Just dumb luck it was close to his base and I ran that direction not even knowing his base was there... I hid on the roof stealthed out XD
---
👍👍
---
199
---
Lmao dude. You are being pretty pathetic.
---
The more I see the less it makes sense
---
Pinic blanket, fixer plan, mascot and imposter outfits, white wolf fedora
---
Not as much as your attitude. See ya.
---
That's probably my main thing against teaming up. The whole mobbing up on someone thing. Is well frustrating.
---
I played solo till 50 did all quests from launch. The last 200 levels have just kinda occured.
---
Its a game, who shit in your cereal?
---
If you are on PS4 I can help. I just need to walk my stank ass past it and it will die (Plague Walker mutation) Only way I can think of off-hand that will do no damage to your camp but will rid you of the dreaded chicken.
---
Picnic blanket is one I haven't heard
---
The ones I know for sure from obtaining them are 
---
Sheep mascot uniform
---
Sheep Imposter uniform
---
White wolf fedora
---
Assaultron head plan
---
Fixer plan (don't own)
---
I has a friend on Xbox who used mods to get to level 1700 something a few months ago.
---
so far I've received the white wolf fedora, sheepsquatch head &amp; body, salvaged assaultron head plan (and the sheepsquatch impostor variant?)
---
I got it. 😬
---
"Sucks you lagged, but here's my cool stuff!" Just.. Stop.
---
Ya same here , I sometimes get bored but heck still play and find things to do
---
Thank you! I got the fixer plans, although I got the fun itself in an earlier quest.
---
I also received the T-51b jet pack plan
---
I got the T60 and T45 today. I'm thinking about reading the plan myself to sell my service making them. I wouldn't charge much with the customer's material.
---
Oh that was a nice one too. Probably way more satisfying than popping one of the typical 5x floor, 6x turrets, and a stair camps.
---
You need the required perk to add it. Owning it only means it won’t cost you the materials to build it.
---
Yes it does ultra armor gives only resistance to scorched damage vs x01 gives raw resists
---
It’s not Fortnite..........
---
But I actually like the idea
---
At this point I feel worse for the cereal and the one who did it to the cereal.
---
That's just not true. I have an automatic laser rifle with a splitter on it, and I go through about 500 cells before it needs repair.
---
I'd love to scrap everything besides 45, 556 and shotgun.
---
That'd be awesome.
---

---
Using it as a rug. I think it fits nicely in my house.
---
No. Even with planning ahead. Put your combat perks into nukes dragons. It will be at least lvl 60 for "obtain all the cards" at the bottom of the page. Start adding in a few sensible other cards and it will go over lvl 70 in a hurry. You simply do not have access to start getting several combat cards until after lvl 45. Unless your perk pack rng is amazing and perfect, you will not have everything a lvl 300 can make use of by lvl 50.
---
Sure you didn't get that from the Unsolved: Picnic Panic quest? Thats where that is supposed to drop.
---
Yea it is, but in my experience PvP with someone level way higher is just as frustrating. Fallout just wasn’t meant for PvP, because battles are supposed to be in the pc’s favor.
---
Hmm 70% upvoted. Looks like a good portion of the community disagrees.
---
Bottom line is if u not pvp ready then dont pvp. No one is making folks.
---
What perk?
---
Then we'll just have to wait around for the owner and level them first. At least then we can be sure to explain why we're doing it.
---
Yah, it stacks with callibrated shocks too so can get an extra 200 carry weight
---
Well maybe but I did all of them together so you are right. I could have gotten it earlier and just didnt notice.
---
You don't.
---
Weapons are either 1, 2, or 3 star legendaries. there is no way to upgrade them currently.
---
My suspicion is that a big reason we have robots instead of full NPCs is that the AI packages that dictate behavior are expensive to run across a server and multiple clients.
---
Robots can have simple pathing, a few voice lines, and be consistent and believable. When you start getting full schedules and complex paths and actions, it becomes resource intensive.
---
In that case, if they can manage that full spectrum of action, they should just introduce human NPCs.
---
I saw a dude with a 4 star machete earlier
---
It’s for comedy purposes. Fortnite dances are already used as seats. In fallout 4 they have their own dances that are pretty funny. Also emotes are boring and not expressive in this game. Imagine someone that’s naked randomly coming into your camp and just dancing on your couch*if you have one* and then just randomly ran away.
---
Big Smelly Gnomes
---
Same, It’s so annoying
---
I did that too. I set that first and then the drier and still couldn’t click it. Is there something else I’m missing?
---
Thank you
---
I posted this like, 5 months ago. They’ve already had PvP updates. This post is pretty much irrelevant now.
---
How much would it cost if I covered the materials and what are the materials needed
---
I had one randomly spawn in my stash once. Freaked me the hell out.
---
Doesn’t matter, you can leave really quick and grab one from your stash (if you have one)
---
Fallout is mainly a pve I'm guessing PvP is a experimental thing
---
If you really think there’s a complete lack of story then you’re genuinely not paying any attention at all.
---
Nope, happened to me. Glirched.
---
The 4th star can be added once you complete the Fire Breather training at Charleston Fire Station. On the terminal, you can download the mod to add Scorch Killer effect to a few very specific weapons. The weapon must be a 3***. It adds additional 50% damage to all scorched, but 20% less damage to everything else. 
---
The regular 3*** machete can be upgraded to cultist with poison damage, which adds a 4th star as well.
---
Dang, well thanks for helping haha. Glad I’m not missing something super obvious
---
Okay while the thought of this happening in a Fallout game months ago I would have been disgusted at the idea of this. However considering the kind of game this is, I would actually like this myself. This isn't a Fallout game to be taken seriously with role playing and all, at least not yet. It's a much more laid back relax type of game and something funny like this would be welcome.
---
That's using the sacraficial machette mod. 
---
It seems to be the only one that adds a star, afaik.
---
Only take two max at a time multiples past two get no bonus
---
The thing is is that even if I’m in pacifist mode if my team engages in pvp I’m stuck defenseless so that s why I don’t use it.
---
Get in the van...
---
Probably 500 caps per torso modded seems reasonable, right? That's what I charge for T51 stealth boy torso modding.
---
*But it’s Opposite Day only for you though*
---
Hells yes! Got black titanium coming out my eyeballs from hitting blackwater mine every time I got to whitespring station!
---
Power smith (maxed)
---
Shit you’re right, he’s straight up suggesting massive inflation as a solution
---
It has to be maxed? Thought you just needed Level 1
---
I like to see if I can run in a circle around them and draw everything in a one mile radius to them at once. Then see if they can survive on that little slice of health bar. A lot of them can't because they only got the weapon and not the armor or defense perks to make it a full build.
---
&gt;That’s pretty much what those players wearing those bs armors are doing.
---
Agree completely and I'm happy to see them getting what they deserve.
---
It isn't very cool to be railed into a quest and not be able to get remotely close to the quest area because there's heavily outleveled mobs in the area.
---
Oh you cant do it for xo1 or ultrasite?
---
Its lonely and boring
---
You have no friends at all. Confirmed.
---
I had a friend come and do it, and was able to move forward from there
---
I prefer not to overload people with all my strategy. Though, I have tips on many matters. What would you like to know?
---
Dude same, i have no idea how i got it
---
Just basic stuff I love finding out more complex stuff on my own I really just want to maximise my playtime and enjoyment as it's not everyday I get a new game
---
No, I dont have those, sorry.
---
Don't forget to mark your calendar!
---
Good tip on scrapping the problem items!  He’s tried to delete the makeshift blueprint and it won’t work. For reals it’s bugged out.
---
I just meant player vs any other amount of online players. 
---
It should have been kept as a single player experience, because there was no way to change the style of gameplay without drastically altering what fallout is.
---
Hoard, don't be afraid to grab everything that has value. Building caps and materials is important. Bonus! Use the "tag" feature when crafting to mark materials you need! It places an icon next to junk you look at, letting you know it breaks down into something you need. Very helpful for new players.
---
That tag feature is really nice to know, thank you!
---
Good come back?
---
I got so much blk titanium I hate myself for it. Gosh I wish I could spend it on more things.
---
But it’s a post nuclear apocalypse. I don’t know why you think they are stupid you’re basically learning what has happened I don’t really know what you expect, you just don’t seem interested in the lore which isn’t their fault
---
Hey sorry I didn't see this. I'm only level 40 so I can't use that one sadly. Do you have some plans I could buy?!
---
Green with jealous rage right now
---
Road between woods estate and clarsburg
---
That's true also. On a side note I wish there are other npcs besides robots
---
Ah, man! I should of totally came back with a greater insult! Dang it acted more like a *joke* then a actual insult, dang! I need to practice don’t I?
---
Watch out for bullet consumption, invest in picking up lead and steel. Not only will it help your CAMP, but you can craft your own bullets. 
---
Take basic survival perks depending on your playstyle with semi-survival gameplay.
---
Also look at mutations! They can be very beneficial
---
You continue to reply and still have nothing to say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Looks like lonely was an understatement.
---
Do you actually need someone to explain why non-cosmetic microtransactions are bad for games? You're fucking kidding, right?
---
Hoping its a sign they will add it but more likely a sign they added from last game and didn't bother marking it unequipable as only dogmeat could wear it last game.
---
Very welcome! And don't be afraid to ask the reddit for in-game help. I know plenty of people here would gladly drop in and lend a hand.
---
Pick up weapons and scrap them to learn the mods. I wish I’d known earlier
---
I’ll lend a help. Gt is same as here.
---
Oh definitely
---
So my strategy of hoarding all the ammo and avoiding fights is still solid good to know, thanks.
---
I'll be sure to remeber that have a nice day.
---
You certainly are not. It's been the worst I've experienced since I started playing the Beta... What gives??!
---
(On Xbox1X)
---
Certain areas really make my frames drop.
---
Picnic blanket, mascot and imposter outfits, imposter head, white wolf fedora, t51 jetpack plans (this one really surprised me)
---
Yup. I was trying to get a photo of every creature in the game. Kinda like Pokemon Snap but ran out of slots
---
Not just you. Mine has crashed 4 times in the past 2 sessions! It’s really pissing me off! And to OP, I agree completely. The last few times people have actually worked together on my servers as we killed him with a few minutes to spare a couple times. A group of people need to do robot control and focus on the gutsys and eyebots.
---
Thanks, sent you an invite
---
Now that is some very helpful advice as I don't think that was in 4. You just saved me alot of time most likely thanks.
---
I’m leveling up a character and setting him up for laser stuff in the hopes they fix it.
---
Well shit I guess they are Beepy Boys now.
---
“Insert opinion here” there’s always gotta be one
---
Round filing cabinets seem to have a good chance to spawn technical data. The control rooms for each power plant should have a couple.
---
Where do you find the clean versions? Or the colored ones for that matter!?
---
Missy important thing is to have fun.  If you have a specific  build idea though it's a good idea to build your character online with nukesdragon.com or another builder.  Gives toy an idea if where's you want spend your points so your not respeccing after level 50.
---
Other options:
---
Perception: Refractor perk for ER
---
Endurance: Fireproof + Chemfiend. 
---
Charisma: Lone wanderer for less damage taken
---
Robot Hacker perk for pacifying non boss robots
---
Automatic tesla rifle for taking out everything not the boss. 
---
PA: Welded Rebar / Reactive plates mod for dealing with melee
---
Sentinel: Stand in a corner, so you can't get staggered, or put on Padded for less stagger. 
---
Troubleshooting legendary armor.
---
Marsupial/Jetpack atop the roof
---
Chemist + Super Duper diluted stimpacks for spamming in PA. +First aid (intelligence) and Chem fiend (endurance) perks. This combo makes healing last a LOOOONG time and is super effective. Can easily end up with hundreds/thousands of diluted stimpacks over time. In PA, you're effectively unkillable if you cannot be one shot. If you're in PA, and atop the roof shooting down at the sheepsquatch, the bots can't explode on you, and only have to deal with adds shooting at you. Be conduite supreme and nail the boss easily.
---
Honestly the hardest part about soloing is getting a server all to yourself.
---
Just pissed out last 5 times I have ran I got to loot it twice wtf
---
Ill be there
---
... recall cards?
---
Medic's healing effect is very low. Better off with suppressor's for less damage taken or just troubleshooters / blooded / damage legendary
---
I believe I've seen every cryptic and I'm only level 32 or 33
---
Oh snap! That's a great idea.
---
First off, I would roughly plan out how you want your special stats early.
---
then you’ll need to start leveling up. The quickest way would be to find a friend online, have them help you kill higher level things the get more exp faster.
---
Flying solo or in a team mostly focus on the events. Guaranteed enemies, extra XP and bonus rewards.
---
Level 45 and 50 is when all the equipment is maxed level. That’s when you want to trade with other players to get the guns you want.
---
Thus, at level 45. You’ll want to start getting rich... easiest way is to sell items to vendors. You need to gather 1400 caps worth of items that you’re willing to sell. (I have more strategy on this)
---
Another handy way to make caps is to sell your excess junk. Nothing feels better than trading junk for caps then caps for amazing things. 
---
People like to buy steel, lead, acid, plastic, aluminum, springs and few others. I would have a strategy for gathering all of these items. Some better than others.
---
Thanks for the recommendation

How to I join ya?

Add my psn underdog2020
---
My game just straight up crashes when i try to get into the top of the world to craft the karma syringe
---
F
---
Crashed. Can you reinvite
---
&gt;I personally think the prizes for this event are garbage
---
Oh  they definitely are.   I was reluctant to do it at all then I got a notice about the event. Then I completed it successfully and got a fedora an a one star piece of leather armor.
---
Step one find a freind gotcha... in all reality tho I think I have a freind you plays the game so that is really helpful thanks so much
---
X-01 upgrades only come in mods, unfortunately no plans.
---
I'm down. Message me your GT
---
I did it with 3 (including myself) players and a total of 9 mole miners spawned. I did it with the same group 2 weeks ago and there were tons of enemies! Definitely messed up!
---
Ok thanks anyway
---
I’ve gotten better loot off the legendary mr gutsy’s that show up to that fight, though the best one was a furious war drum, I just go for the xp from all the adds
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I want a tamed chicken! I would tear my whole house down for one :)
---
Terry's taxidermy and mounted animal nature trail.
---
Hmm? Like there is plans there?
---
I may have a 1* bloodied radium for sale
---
Playstation I don't have room on my Xbox to install games and I don't like unistalling games to make room
---
And girls...
---
Ya noticed that today on Xbox
---
I’m down
---
Just let us break down bullets like in FONV. We need to have ammo types: explosive, military, incendiary.
---
I was smoking more personally
---
You can do it with all walls (I think. I haven't actually tried the warehouse and metal walls now that I think about it.) but it will clip through with most variations and look a bit odd. It's best for brick walls IMO. I'm picky and like color variations on my walls so I have one or two rooms with red barn walls as "accent" walls. I don't care how out of place it looks. I want wallpaper, damnit!
---
Take your time, explore, enjoy your glorious pipe rifle. One day you'll look back and miss the struggle. Live for it. Enjoy yourself and dont worry so much about the "top tier" stuff
---
Is there a white van with no windows nearby with "Free Candy" written on the side?  I mean, that's legit right? :D
---
I usually rush for the best gear but I think I'll take it slow thank you
---
dayum
---
Like I always have tons of either at any one time.... Should have made steel the one that saves most weight when bulking.
---
I’m sure a ton of people are ready to jump on the help bandwagon... but ask me any question in the future and I’ll tell you what I can.
---
Fast travel. Invest in 'travel agent' perk. Drastically reduced travel costs. Also, fast travel to the vault 76 or your camp if you are crossing vast distances and then onto your destination as those spots are free. You'll save lots but encounter one more loading screen, it's worth it.
---
Its been happening since this squatch update.. if anyone else is having issues please speak up.. maybe it will get some eyes on how bad it truly is
---
None that play PS4 and FO76
---
Well thank you and you have a wonderful day
---
Added ya. Headed your way.
---
I have an X-01 torso w/ jetpack already installed. Pulled it off when I installed emergency protocols. Unfortunately I won't be on until tomorrow afternoon though. If you haven't found the mod by then hit me up, I'm sure we can make a deal.
---
you don't ...not yet you only get the ones from lying lowe there is no access to the others yet there are 100 topics on this already
---
Thanks. About to start silo bravo
---
Be the change.
---
There's some things that in fortnite that would work good here.
---
I have one advice. Find a higher level friend to stalk and gain free XP off of.
---
Old thread but really? 5 plastic is pretty valuable, unless you don't craft shotgun ammo at all. But that's only smart if you use all your lead into prime ammo. Even if you don't use it yourself, shotgun ammo is fairly valuable, it can be gradually crafted a lot, and most gun chars can carry insane amounts of practically no weight, and then it can be sold to players.
---
After the changes about week ago I think Im using combination marine tactical and civil war top hat, with occasinal civil war suite (not sure about the name, it uses gold and cloth)
---
Is fast travel just one flat cost or is it based on how far away you are on the map?
---
I have a quad laser pistol with a splitter, with a capacity of 126. It broke from 100% condition before I ever needed to reload
---
This is a great game to get lost in. I love playing with friends, and love playing alone. Sorry it’s not working out for you. Don’t know what answer you’re looking for with this thread- people play the game because they enjoy it.
---
I also want to add not creatures are coming up yellow. Not all of them but some are. IE scorchbeasts, super mutants and scorched.
---
Dang
---
Adding u
---
Or they could just shrink the loot pool by removing all the legendary effects that literally nobody ever wants, and remove weapons that nobody ever uses from the legendary pool. Less pipe guns, drills, and exterminator's boards, etc, and maybe people could actually be excited about finding a legendary.
---
Bring out the teslas (and molotovs). Those will arc tag everything before they can get a second swing in.
---
It helps to team up with other players, so you can rejoin the server in case of crashes. Spam team invites (or team up emotes) if need be
---
Dude u went there like a week ago and got my ass handed to me in full power armour
---
Yep I use my shotgun to target wings and legs to make her land
---
thing is my friend has the jetpack mod but apparently since the last update you cant mod PA. hopefully gets fixed asap along with the friends list lol
---
Yeah the mini nukes are for the adds that surround the queen. Heavy weapons is indeed the queen killer... also endangerol, pumpkin grenades, tenderizer perk and cryolators.
---
Ah, darn! I hope you find some good people to play with, I'm on XBox.
---
I know what you mean, there is a plot line but the lack of character appearances just makes the storyline feel empty. This is just my opinion.
---
Diversification is key. Serums are good. Water is good. Civil war suits and civil war dresses are good. Hell, even the top hat is still okay. The best cost per selling ratio though is the Marine tactical helmet. I used to just load vendors down with top hats. Now I just load the vendors down with a combination of the above. I haven't run out of materials yet or changed my playstyle.
---
Any specific places to recommend?
---
Yes, how did people get sbq head!? Me and my 2 friends got the same mounted heads from the quest!
---
She'll more likely hover and bug out as people stand on the roof or the fences. Crippling only makes her stay in the air even longer while players are in invalid landing locations. 
---
Top aggro needs to lure her away from there. Better yet, don't fight near V9 at all.
---
The Virgin Assaultron VS The Chad Bloated Feral Ghoul
---
Haven’t had this happen in awhile and when she flies off she come back so far since the patch that fixed that....
---
I think they patched that.....
---
I agree that we should get a cap increase, but the real issue is that there is no cap sink. 
---
Caps were initially intended to be much more difficult to acquire than the single player games, and I imagine this was done to give them more weight. 
---
Unfortunately the ramping dupes ruined this, because people sold duped goods for peanuts, which added up over time and now we have players sitting on these mountains of caps. 
---
But caps don’t “do” anything. Making people pay 2k caps for the Sheepsquatch event is actually a good idea. The problem is they haven’t made the rewards worthwhile. 
---
If it cost you a fair amount of caps to do these “end game” scenarios, and these scenarios had higher chances to drop loot than killing standard Legendaries, we’d see Legendaries drop in value and see cap values soar.
---
I am on pS4
---
Yeah that’s another problem I’ve noticed a few times. The eyebombs blow the body away at the same time as they murder you. With the tossing and the disorientation of respawning it’s pretty easy to lose the body. Especially since it seems no one else is very helpful, they just run around killing more Mr Gutsy’s
---
Once you finish the event in the story you can redo it using recall cards. They're pretty hard to make of your lower level since it needs some nuke materials
---
Stableflux is an event reward for successfully entering and completing the Scorched Earth event.. however it is possible to fail to join the event, if you're not paying attention (so make sure you join, ideally clicking fast travel join event instead of walking in).
---
Secondly the type of stable flux is randomized. 
---
Lure the queen into the blast zone and do follow me emotes for others to do the same, as much as you can.
---
This was me today. I was so busy not dying I didn’t even get a shot at the squatch. Almost everyone was just standing around.
---
I only find other players in some of the events (specifically Sheepsquatch) but no one really interacts with each other.
---
Do they get caps for your death!!!???
---
Hmmmmmm. Hadn't heard about that issue yet but not surprised I guess. Lol
---
I’m sorry but you’re wrong. I took over a workshop in survival with a friend and we battled constant waves of players who eventually teamed up and took us down.
---
Just for you, I'm going to go waste a bunch of ammo and repair materials and count how many shots from full (you should be repairing to 200%) it takes to break.
---
I love grahm! Bought the homemade rifle plans off him the other day on the cheap! Plus who doesn't love Moo-Moo.
---
Agree completely. When I see it I "consider" it but think why bother. Would be fun if it had some real stakes, as in a prize not loss of items to the losers or atoms.
---
Similar experience, except I got 3/4 through the silo solo, then a rando joined me to help. And proceeded to launch the nuke for me. Never bothered trying to do a launch of my own since.
---
I completely agree, all the tension is removed, and that was my favourite part of the mode.
---
Forgive me it’s been a minute since I played, but it’s only 60 caps with your estimate. That’s not that bad, not bad enough to need it to be a major concern, sure it can add up but I doubt every event you travel too is ending as you get to it
---
Amen. My handmade, combat shotgun, most of my melee weapons, and half my armor are 1 stars. I have...eh, 500 odd hours in this game and my only semi-great 3 star legendary dropped two nights ago. 
---
And it's still not better than my 1* bloody handmaid for pure damage.
---
The cap is bullshit at 25k. Period. Anybody who plays the game for a a couple or few weeks can hit 25k. Then that totally kills things for trading. Player vending will be impossible imo. Today a guy wanted my bloodied dcg and I missed out on 4K more caps because I was maxed out! Sucks
---
Ouch, that would be so horrible.
---
Go back to Fortnite.
---
Make sure you count the actual hits, which deplete your condition, not just shots. And I'm sorry that I can't repair a freshly dropped legendary to 200%, you can thank the intuitive game mechanics for that
---
Iron clad in endurance instead of radically since beating ranged
---
Wait...
---
You seem to be looking down on low levels but your god-like level of 42 didn't know about bulking scrap?
---
I agree, survival has become much quieter since the nerf, but With how unbalanced PvP is in the game, I don’t think it’s right for there to be huge losses, once PvP combat is more balanced then I think increasing the rewards for kills and penalties for death can be addressed,  but as long as the combat remains insanely unbalanced, survival will have to remain a bit more casual
---
What does Graham being 3\* matter?
---
Check JuiceHeads channel, he's got footage of it from data miners
---
This is spot on! Just noticed it today and it’s bullshit!! It was my favorite thing to do for a while, hit the vendors then run through watoga and see if I got really lucky to catch a legendary robot. They are enemies! They are red, so why shouldn’t they have a chance to be legendary!?
---
There’s been a handful of updates and patchs but we haven’t gotten any more damn slots for photos. It’s a fucking travesty. I’ve played since the game came out, I have quite the catalogue of events. Sure would be nice to keep them all.
---
No you don't.
---
Not yet
---
 It will be added at some point but not in game yet. All images are from data mining so far.
---
What about being able to wear the weapon? When you equip it, it goes on your head.
---
I'm really hoping when player vending happens we'll be able to put ammo in there.
---
When I am done for the night, if I am feeling a little low on cores I just go kill a few of the sentry bots at white spring. They will drop loot even though you sometimes have to let them sit for a bit before it’ll show properly.
---
Im totally infavor of that!!
---
I just got a bos leg plan by scrapping light left legs today.
---
Nothing is good in fortnite....
---
I joined the event this morning as a level 64 and ended up holding 2 conduits the entire time even though there were at least 5 people over lvl 100. Still failed it... I spent the entire time on area chat explaining what to do and we will not get a reward if we ran out of time. Evidently killing the gutsys for 15 min was the only objective they were interested in. At least it waznt my keycard/caps wasted. But i did waste stimpaks that could have been used on another attempt.
---
Sry if that's not what u meant.
---
I was way behind when I figured it out. I was picking them up and selling them. But early on in the game this is huge to me
---
No you can mod them to improve the base stats but you can’t upgrade a piece from sturdy to heavy
---
I cut down trees, I wear high heels, suspenders and a bra!
---
Nah. I prefer Minecraft survival games 👌
---
Tottaly down.plus would make the tedious kill golfer ghouls easier for lowbies
---
Threw a beam splitter on my two shot laser rifle... Same thing, bih broke broke before I reloaded
---
The pve players cried and cried to remove cap loss from survival so they could get xp without risking caps, the devs listened. Guess where player deaths are worth 3x more now? Yep adventure, I have gone back to blowing up bases in adventure for wanted and killing workshop owners in adventure for 3x the caps. All they needed to do was make a limit on max caps lost 100 or 150 and made the loss 100% same as adventure. Survival is pointless now why would people use strategy or tactics when they can just zerg from spawn sites over and over and it cost them  almost nothing to do it.
---
Doesn't each chassis weight 10? So you need 500 to carry/store them all.
---
Had 8 legendary mutant around and in westek the other night
---
I’ll help, CodeMonkey57 is my GT
---
thanks - yeah I could do that and I probably will. they are pretty cheap
---
Chainsaws are allowed
---
Man, I just came across a chunk of posts, this one and three others, all about this issue, one after the other. 
---
I’m not complaining, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that this is clearly a major bug and I’m a little surprised that this one (and maybe the repair bug) didn’t get taken care of Thursday because of all the attention they’re getting.
---
Yes. Which would leave me with 300 free. However if I were to carry them all it would be 125 with my perks(the perk the reduces weight I can't remember the name of)
---
I call them all Major Tom...but that's just me.
---
Mannequins
---
I found one BOS plan. It was from a Savage Divide treasure map. The other two I purchased from the market place.
---
I asked Spotify if they would work with Bethesda about letting Spotify premium accounts be used they said as long as they were approached by Bethesda they said it would be a possibility, sent Bethesda an email so perhaps one day if more people asked them for ir
---
Quite lol
---
OMG how could you assemble them all before being able to rename?
---
How do you get these different stringers!!??
---
Yes.
---
Pls.
---
I had someone drop like 1200 ammo for me on my first day playing.  It lasted me until level 13 or so.  It was awesome and allowed me to stockpile tons of ammo for other weapons. 
---
I intend to pay that forward for sure!
---
Dang it then how will I go about hiding sky platforms full of turrets in my friends bases.
---
I watched a fox open my front door once. I was a bit surprised.
---
Just leave the ammo you don't use in suitcases at the train stations...
---
Well played
---
You got the jet pack mod from the event?
---
Mine lags everytime I log in some worse than others, I am on PC
---
It's just a bug right now, I've seen it on X-01 and Ultracite
---
What am I looking at?
---
Explain to me how PvP is severely unbalanced?
---
Same dude back to adventure it is
---
How much
---
2000
---
Or 24 bulk steel and 20 bulk lead
---
If your on PS4 you can play Spotify in the background while playing.
---
Exactly you can just walk around will nilly. And if you die? OH NO I LOST 10 CAPS
---
Before renaming, placing them was a nightmare. It was completely random, the only way to tell any separation was atomic paints. And with just a 2 minute timer theres was never enough time to sort even 10 into a specific order for a picture
---
u/SeattleSk8 \- you seem to be the person I should ask this question to: If I buy a power armor paint from the shop, i.e. the mothman power armor paint, do I need to gather materials for an entire new armor set or can I simply apply the paint?
---
You're spread out all over the place. Pick a weapon type, and build around it. Perception goes with rifles, Strength goes into heavy/melee/shotguns. You don't want to mix both.
---
Also choose whether you go Power armor or not. If you're not going PA, you don't need batteries included. You don't have nearly enough endurance. You need fireproof and possibly adamantium skeleton. Go white knight if you're doing regular armor. 
---
Sneak builds need to be very specific builds. They do go well with handmades, nor BOS gear.
---
Honestly if I were you, I'd forego sneak, go PA + BE Gatling gun, high strength, low perception, high intelligence. moderate everything else. Handmades are incredibly expensive ammo upkeep while gatlings are extremely ammo efficient. When you get crafting perks ammo smith and super duper, you average over 200 5mm bullets per craft, and a much higher kill to bullet lead ratio than handmades.

---
That's my build during queen fights. Pharmacy is swapped out with first aid, and perception goes full refractor for sheepsquatch.
---
It is for the statue of Hebe found on top of the dome covered well at Whitesprings.
---
Good luck when you run into the major gutsy or whatever that shoot the op af bullets haha. But yeah sentinel can be very buggy sometimes
---
Ikr, before if you heard shots or footsteps, it was genuinely tense, but now dying is barely even a punishment.
---
Yes I did. And another mod but I can’t remember off the top of my head
---
I feel like stash space is very much like income - we spend what we have. Some combination of that and maybe we knew a lot less about the game in the early days so we had less to store.
---
Did she disappear?
---
We just beat
---
Her body disappeared I could t loot her
---
Yea just did a squatch run and two waters for healing later was fined last night something insignificant looks at me I was dead
---
She got gooified
---
I’m not having this issue my dcg was doing 2400 earlier. I would try getting rid of your adrenal and get it again. Try un equipping and re equipping everything.
---
Yes the SB can be aggro'ed by other mobs or other players can kill it before it reaches, and it'll never appear to those doing  the event.
---
You can paint armor that you already have. You'll only need a few materials like 1 oil and 2 plastic and maybe one other thing(not sure off the top of my head) to apply the paint. It's real minimal materials to apply it
---
Ughhhhhhh
---
At least there's another one lol
---
It's easier and quicker to just buy them. You can spend hours trying to get one that you want and not get it.
---
Not when you can vats and kill instantly you’ll always be faster because of crits if you’re not a crit build or have stealth boys you’re screwed basically
---
I got lucky today and found a server with min-max players who fired off all 3 silos sequentially and took down the SBQ in just a minute or two each time. The whole thing took like 15 minutes. Without min-max players, we're lucky if we kill the SBQ at all.
---
Happy Cake Day coacheyes! I hope this is the beginning of your greatest, most wonderful year ever!
---
I usually just sell unwanted ammo to other players.
---
It's actually a decent way to make caps, just craft a bunch of 5.56 and sell it for nearly a cap a bullet
---
Did you actually get the leg plan or just able to color a combat armor helmet? I was mistaken as well at first.
---
It does seem like Watoga got nerfed though.  I'd always see multiple legendaries each time I made a loop of the city, nothing in the past few days.  Probably a good move though as it was way too easy to farm legendary protectrons there.
---
If you ment if you buy a second paint and want to cover the first, yes you'll need new materials for the new paint
---
I found leg plans in a level 3 safe
---
Also with the not getting rads targeting the scorched adds are not dropping glowing, hardens mass....
---
I got a 2 star weightless chest piece
---
Exactly my point if you can't outskill them you can outnumber them.
---
There's always one by the Capitol building if you really wanna see one. I see them all the time. They also frequently spawn in the gardens of whitesprings and new River gorge.
---
Lmao I thought they nuked fissure again it was WS
---
This is a brilliant idea. I don’t know that they can balance the system enough to provide more than one or two new meta weapons and a bunch of stuff nobody uses, but ideas like this are a step in the right direction. LOVE this. Thanks for sparking creative discussion
---
Lol ya. We’re server hopping to find one to do sheep
---
Watoga has been nerfed. I farmed it every server hop for mods and killed at least 5 legendary enemies. I haven't seen a single one for a week there. It has been nerfed.
---
k lemme kno
---
stop it you are making it stronger!! i think it is attacking my base right now!!
---
This happened to me. After 3 server hops I got it to work
---
I built a dedicated garage. It looked great!
---
I've been carrying over 600 pounds on me with all weight perks ever since December. Honestly a stash size increase won't even affect me unless either they raise it all the way up to 2000, they make weight perks affect stashed items, or I stop being a hoarder. All three are unlikely bordering on impossible
---
More players = More adds. Honestly, as long as they are not drawing the queen onto unlandable areas, that's a good thing. 
---
Why do I care if they're not doing damage, when I'm going to fatman mini nuke / orbital strike / blooded tesla rifle arc / autogrenade launcher / nuke mine kill all the adds, and cryolater/endangeral syringer/tenderizer perk the Queen anyway and she dies stupidly fast with my heavy weapons on her.
---
Really, low levels are in no way taking away from the experience. They don't increase the SBQ health either (nor damage resist). They only 'add' (mobs) the experience.
---
North to Toxic Valley. South to the Ash Heap. They're both level capped so you won't be totally outmatched if a high level player shows up. You can also head west through the Forest out behind vault 76, although it's thin on events out there.
---
Join
---
Got one
---
All them damn explosions causing frame rate lag.
---
I saw one literally as I was level 1 when I first walked out of Vault 76. No idea what it was. Then I saw one again when I was like level 30, still didn't know what is was, but when I tried to kill it, it just disappeared.
---
Coming...whitespring was beat sauce
---
Thanks. I saw one once at the golf club, but if that is what it was intended to do, it must not have been very effective because I didn’t even notice anything different beyond the annoying sound of turret fire. 
---
Interesting how people complaining about griefing by legitimately, purposefully dickish moves often get downvoted, yet posting comically strong feelings about maybe not having one legendary farming location out of many on the map, on the server they currently happen to be on, probably even in the middle of a day full of server hopping...gets upvoted and celebrated.
---
Performance has been horrendous recently. I've had times when the game would just keep rubberbanding me around for a good 5-10 minutes, even if I hopped servers. At one point I left while that was happening and when I logged back in, I was rolled back a good 10 minutes of progress. Lots of crashes too, especially when trying to use a consumable item. I had so many crashes trying to drink something for all those stupid "eat out a deathclaw's ass while wearing an Egyptian prince's cousin's dress and doing a handstand during a solar eclipse while also drunk" challenges
---
I like the fo76 map better, I don’t really know why though haha. I just like it
---
Normally Destiny players would be fine (i am a destiny player i understand heroic public events and message people when they don't know)
---
But i definitely hear ya, i think 90% of the Destiny players playing 76 are the Destiny players that have no idea, and die to dregs
---
It’s strategy.
---
76 for sure.
---
I had this same issue earlier today, but I found a swell gentleman named /u/Firesicon 
---
He has “learned” nearly every weapon mod in the game. So basically he is unaffected by this bug because it only applies to using the boxed mods. 
---
He’s got a lot of armor mods too I imagine. And he only charged me a treasure map to install the mods. 
---
I would look him up for business if you need it!
---
It would be perfect if it didnt take a few seconds to get into and having the map on the pip boy is very convenient.
---
And have a 3*aa sub as well
---
Same thing here, game freezes up in that identical way while eating or drinking. It also keeps you in the game until you force quit via task manager, so if you tried healing in combat you will most likely be dead with all your junk gone by the time you log back in
---
Bummer. Would be cool to be able to apply to other models of PA. Thanks!
---
If, big if, watoga got nerfed then good. Hate how people justify using it as legit. I don't believe anything else was touched.
---
I want that anti armor sub what’s your gt so I can party chat
---
Strategy is using cowardly tactics. That isn't using strategy it's basically a brain dead hammer move to muscle attack something instead of using a scalpal precision strike that requires forethought to execute.
---
Don't worry you would've gotten a 1 star wooden chest piece anyways
---
What do you mean, not good for RP? Dancing is great for RP. We have all sorts of musical instruments, why would no one dance? RP doesn't have to be super serious stuff all the time, you can RP lighter elements of life, too.
---
I play on PC and have GTX 1080, 16GBs of DD4 Ram, and a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU. Fresh reformat, fresh everything. Crashed and froze 5 of the 7 attemps.
---
Damn! That’s pretty cool! I know for sure you can get the following; white wolf fedora, imposter head, imposter outfit, mascot head, mascot outfit, fixer plans, assaultron salvaged head plan. Those are the ones I’ve seen at least. I’m going to keep farming it to get all that I can!!
---
I've heard it too. Drove me crazy and I had to leave.
---
I would love more "things you might do irl" animations, dancing would be nice. Eating, drinking, etc, would be good, too.
---
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I know what I’m doing tomorrow
---
GG haven’t done the SBQ in While
---
Needs more upvotes. Has been a thing for a while
---
This is not the issue.  I've had it maxed for months and this glitch was introduced in the last patch.  Very irratating that I can't put my X-01 calibrated shock on right now.
---
Why don’t people as creative as you work for Bethesda 🤦🏻‍♂️ they create these new guns and make them underpowered and have no customisation... the 50 cal,  LMG, plasma Gatling, gauntlets ect.... while all rifles have like 30 different barrels and grips with minimal differences
---
Hopefully it’s fixed soon

Nukashine is a hell of a drug.
---
I'm only lvl 43 with shit tier guns and armor (I've just come back to the game after quitting a little after release, so working on remedying that) I try to do my part and kill adds at the very least. Best I've got is a Gauss Cannon @ 150 dmg and a Pump shotty @ 117. I can take out eye bots and protectrons easy enough.
---
You have to salvage syringers in order to learn how to craft the different types.  For the bloatfly larva syringer you need 10 bloatfly glands to craft it.  Took me over a month to find the first 10.  Got up to 8 before they got autoscrapped smelting lead and had to start again, but once you get one made, it is easy to make more.
---
Just booted off a server for the fifth time TODAY. this is FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
---
Lost ALL progress made in the last attempt to play. Now back on and every item I grab is still displayed on the screen. The nuke zone I was farming is gone. THIS is why, after years of lov8ng Fallout, I damn near passed on 76. FUCK this online play bullshit!@!@#!
---
It sure is.
---
You're a tool.
---
Take workshops. Even if all you do is take it and leave. It will get you CAMP plans. Also check every container at train stations, I have heard people usually dump unwanted things there. I usually drop stuff at overseer caches.
---
Those are probably the 2 best things I have learnt in my 15-20 hours in game.
---
I hate that, I was excited with how they were saying "even the hardiest and most powerful wanderers will need a team and find it difficult." 
---
Hearing people say thay it'll be possible to solo takes my excitement away.
---
incestive kinda went down for her. more of a hassle to fight the queen with tse nerfs, loot bugs, ultracite armor no longer rare... ect
---
Got the fedora that dude was tough!!!!
---
This was happening to me too. If you're on PC then go to the game folder and delete all of the .ini files. Then run the repair tool in the launcher.

---
I don't even care about the weight. Just having your power armor out so you can see them and pick one to jump in would be awesome.
---
Doesn't work for me. Shows purple and black boxes everywhere in view. Relog was no help, on ps4 so pretty sure it's not on my end
---
Whoaaaa I got expensive 3 * marine leg
---
Also give them durability greater than that of wet tissues
---
What kind
---
the plan spawn locations in the toxic valley such as Grafton will spawn BOS combat armor plans
---
* weightless
---
* 25 % damage resistance
---
* ammo weighS 20% less
---
Are you playing on PC or PS4/XboxOne? I have 567 pictures and I play on PC. What's the limit?
---
Thanks. I never had luck with the stringer and somehow I scraped or lost the weird one from rose! I’m going to make and scrap some tomorrow. I think they are pretty cheap to craft
---
I think that's pretty good
---
Yea I kno, but after fighting imposter shespsqatch like 10 times I figured why not. It’s prob my 20th time dropping a nuke solo there and usually guys will come. I did it yesterday and day before no prob.  They need to add in more rare or unique drops for the queen to up those insentives. Not stupid repair kits either lol
---
I'm on xbox, do you use the actual photo mode itself or..?
---
 Be aware of the scrap you get from weapons. Steel is great but scrapping lots of weapons makes a lot of steel. Make sure you have plastic so you can bulk it and sell it to vendors when your stash is full
---
That’s pretty damn good. I didn’t get a good legendary but I was happy to get a prime handmade receiver
---
Nice..I want the sheep head thing lol
---
The mascot or imposter? Cuz I can sell u a full mascot set
---
I'm looking for them to use.
---
I want to take my spare power armor and turn them into scarecrows to keep the ghouls away
---
The one u were wearing
---
No u just cant bulk them,u can sell them unbulked tho
---
1500 caps
---
&gt;  I'm a huge PvP player and I don't see the point of playing this mode anymore simply because there is no reward.
---
Caps ain't hard to get friend. So if your reason for PvPing is only cause "I want money!" then you're not really a PvPer...
---
What you're saying is basically akin to not invading in dark souls cause you got your PvP covenant to rank 3.
---
I just saw my first yesterday, after a number of hours I’m terrified to look up, but amounts to over 230 levels among three characters.
---
For the set?
---
I love the 76 map, I just wish discovered (&amp; heard-about) locations stood out a little more than they do.
---
Coming to u now
---
I really would like this feature for pretty much every object. Placing floors facing the same way is a chore.
---
I encountered mine on the cliffs overlooking the monorail elevator.
---
I'm on xbox if anyone wants to check it out or get a picture with it
---
Photo mode, screenshots are stored in other directory. 567 photos = 1.76 GB (including the thumbnails).
---
You might wanna rephrase that lmao
---
I'm looking for AAE lever action or handmade trying to let everyone kno to keep this ears open
---
Pewp. I'd rather be able to bulk them for storage.
---
Only lead and aluminium wil go down in weight when u bulk it
---
You have a BE Handmade, but you're using batteries included? I would drop that and Nerd Rage for Demolition and prob 2* First Aid. Then only use Gunsmith when you need to mod a gun (scrap is everywhere you don't need your weapon to break more slowly...) Take those extra points off Intelligence and apply them to Endurance and get perks like Iron Clad, Fire Proof, Adamantium Skeleton and Cola Nut for the sweet Nuka Grapes. 
---
I'd probably get 3* Bear Arms instead of Traveling Pharmacy too.
---
You gotta steer yourself away from quality of life stuff and into damage multiplyers. Maybe also roll a few points off luck and forego Serendipity to get closer to 15 points on Endurance.
---
Only lead and aluminium wil go down in weight when bulked
---
That would be friggin' fantastic.
---
Heard they can drop from the Encryptid event.
---
Lol well played, upvote for u
---
If you’re talking about raiders, yeah they don’t play by rules. Some person built a pvp arena and my base is also a pvp town. I’m down for 1v1s with rad x to suppress mutations, leather gear, and pipe guns.
---
Not two players though, they'll travel to each other and miss each other. The point is to not know when you're in danger
---
&gt;Don't complain about showing up to a PvP mode getting killed then losing all your caps, what part of high risk high reward don't you understand? 
---
I guess they assumed that they had a shot at the "high reward" part, when actually they're just getting farmed for caps by players they'll never compete with. The mode probably wasn't sustainable.
---
I generally have to avoid nuke zones/any events with lots of people like Sheepsquatch or SBQ, I’m almost guaranteed to disconnect from them at this point.
---
I had one in my camp that worked. They were in the beta and it carried over but haven't been able to find it since.
---
76, most def
---
the potential is limitless I for one would love to be able to show off me power armor on display 😂👍
---
You've just straw manned me and taken me out of context, my argument is: I see no reason to PvP in survival because of the lack of cap reward, because adventure is 4x better now. I will PvP in adventure. Just because I don't do it soley for the joy of killing people but also for cap rewards doesn't mean I'm not a PvP player that's absurd and a black and white view of things which is generally inferior to something more broad and open minded. Also as I've said the lack of huge caps loss takes away from the tension of the mode.
---
They will add the SBQ Mounted Head plan - which people seems to be interested in - to the levelled list with a chance to 'drop' of 0.036%.
---
I’ve experienced this a couple times too
---
It's a random percent of what you have on you drops. So if you have lots of chems a lot of them will drop. It should be set a max of like 10 items total not half of your shit.  They said they reduced the percent that drops but but how Much who knows,
---
Yeah though they are alot easier to rotate around than walls for me, at least on the floor preview it shows the correct way it will place! Walls highlight an go green yet you place and you just get lumped with a big fat line in the middle of your wall that wasn't there lol
---
Items that can be sold directly to the vendor (like screws, nuclear waste, fiber optics, etc) cannot be bulked. The only reason for bulking the other items (aluminum and lead excepted) is to sell the otherwise valueless items to the vendor.
---
I don't know why people want to carry so many aid items like this. Why not just take what you need?
---
No, you are not the only one. My game lags BADLY
---
At 
---
Morgantown and surrounding areas
---
Nuke zones (sometimez)
---
Weekends
---
The event is bugged in that the scorchbeast rarely ever spawns in near you, but it *does* seem to always spawn. As you experienced, it's usually somewhere off in the distance, and once you pop a few shots into it, the script kicks in and acts like it should, and flies down, lands near you, and (hopefully) dies.
---
Yeah, I want them all to be bulk-able to go down in weight. It makes no sense that some things you can bulk, and it's helpful, but other things you can but there's no reason, and other things you can't bulk. It makes no sense to have like 3+ things you have to think of when it comes to bulking junk.
---
Same I can back this up. Done a full 20 runs of the city and it’s buildings and only 5 in the city and 2 in WES are legendary. From the 10+ you’d get normally if rng was good.
---
It just seems so silly to have some things one way, and other things another.
---
Thanks. I get so sick of that message lol
---
There are PvP towns???
---
I've seen tons, even saw a 3star glowing protectron come out of his pod in all of his glorious robot flaming glory.
---
are you not killing Diseased?
---
Is it an uncommon occurrence? Some dude dropped 4 nukes there today and each time most of the people were on the bunker. SBQ would land outside of the gate tho every time.
---
&gt; Console commands.
---
Put that goalpost back.
---
&gt; That's why I went to another game, because it seems every area besides the starter zone is one I shouldn't be in. There's also no server jump button. There's mainly bad game design that pairs me with servers filled with people over level 100, which could easily be programmed better, too bad the A team isn't working on this game.
---
Yeah several other games have the exact same issue, but don't catch shit.
---
&gt; Cool story, so why can they find me instantly after I jumped off the roof and move behind a container? Maybe one of them saw me even though normally I can sneak up in front of them with no issue until engaging? See, I can spew bullshit too, but seriously, that's sad game logic right there.......
---
Well first off there aren't zombies in the game. Feral Ghouls are closest and they're dumber than sacks of particularly stupid rocks. They can't find you when they know where you are. I've had it happen to me numerous times. Of course the real trick is making sure that one enemy doesn't see the other fall.
---
Also you don't go from hidden to targeted all at once. [Hidden] goes to [Caution] when you first alert enemies. Only goes to [Danger] once they know where you actually are. So if you're getting ganged up on like that... You must be standing out in the open, in broad daylight, in Power Armor, with your headlamp on. Especially when all you need to do to to get [Danger] to go back to [Caution] is run, break line of sight, find a place to hide, and crouch there for a few seconds.
---
Unless you're fighting Scorched, since they're a hive mind. When one goes down, all the rest in the area instantly notice. If one spots you they all know where you are. Good thing their perception is pretty crap though. Getting away from them is pretty easy. Still they're the only enemies like that. Since Super Mutants, Feral Ghouls, Mole Miners, and etc all take a noticeable second to notice a dead comrade and another to sound the alarm. Plus with most enemies, if you get put in [Danger] by one, out of sight of the others, and drop that enemy before they can shout, or attack. You'll then drop immediately back to [Caution], or [Hidden] depending on which state you had before the enemy spotted you.

Which is the same sneak mechanic in Fallout 4, which was significantly upgraded from Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Since you can still land Sneak Attack Criticals from [Caution], each state tells you how severe it is, or how hidden you are, and it's far more forgiving than 3 and NV. In fact it's rather on better than basically any action game with stealth. Where when you alert one enemy in the area, all the rest are alerted too.
---
Is either the cover art for '50 Shades of Camo' - now with 75% more kink - or a... *Raider thing*?
---
It could have been avoided with fractional cap prices, but that would have been more difficult for them to implement i think. 
---
I REALLY want fractional cap prices (or bulking of ammo) for player vending and trading as it would make vending ammo much easier.
---
I haven't seen a Legendary in Watoga in days, and I used to see 4+ every time. Anecdotal, but after a while you have to wonder.
---
Every time I try to nuke the queen people roll in with two shot explosive stuff and then she bugs out and doesn’t take any damage.
---
Keep in mind this a survival BETA. Nothing set in stone.
---
True, that is why I'm trying to provide feedback
---
Yeah, the scribe outfit's not rare at all. I farm tech data pretty much every day, and they drop fairly regularly.
---
I don't get many disconnecting issues just occasional console crashes. Have you ran a speedtest during your DC times to see if there's any correlation between your ISP/packet loss and Server disconnects?
---
You do know their messing with passive mode so pvp won’t work on people who have it ticked on?
---
I’ve also noticed this, ever since the first Wild Appalachia update a while ago (also Xbox)
---
If it’s mainly the exterior aesthetic you’re worried about, make a porch type thing with a standard metal walled exterior door, then the powered brick wall door inside :)
---
Trade something nice for an explosive one. It makes a huge difference
---
What's ur platform?
---
I needed that... thank you
---
No items in this game should cost more than 25k. If that’s the case then the in game economy is absurdly over flooded and increasing the cap limit will do the opposite of fixing that.
---
I mean, the only real reason to bulk junk is to sell it
---
Great. People aren’t mad about cap loss. Their mad that people are allowed to achieve builds that range in the 800+ damage. While only having a very small fraction of the number. Thus if they go in pvp their just gonna die if and waste time. The caps are a back up of recovering from that. 
---
That’s why cap rewards were needed.
---
Exactly! The economy is already over flooded. You don’t need more caps lol
---
Every camp I make is a PvP map. :)
---
I genuinely don’t see the point of Hunter/Hunted now that survival mode is a thing.
---
Especially as I don’t enjoy PVP, it’s kinda irritating for their to now be challenges associated with it which means I’m missing out on atoms.
---
Yeah for some reason despite the photos being saved locally, they limit us to 50 on the Xbox. It’s really frustrating. We should be allowed to adjust the maximum amount of space we want to dedicate to photos ourselves.
---
I’ve seen that safe, it’s in the mire. Have never found the key though
---
Biggest concern.  I really don't want a cluster fuck dungeon where the first team just kills everything.  Or someone enters with you, and just loots everything of importance while everybody is busy fighting..   Or every time someone enters, the enemies respawn to compensate.
---
Instancing dungeons is definitely needed for new content, and maybe even a lot of new content since new stuff is guaranteed to be packed on the first day.
---
Theres a limit?? I loved recalling adventures :( how many can i keep?
---
Probably because people’s stashes are filled up with other things and don’t have room for aid as well, plus lots of people have the perks that lower the weight of aid items (which only works if you’re carrying them in your inventory, not in your stash)
---
I've seen plenty of legendary enemies but haven't seen a legendary item drop since beta 🤷‍♂️
---
Level 60ish.
---
I mean are there PvP areas (like how dark souls has that dragons bridge invasions).
---
^real mvp
---
Same with Xbox One
---
I’d happily take any 50 cal
---
Literally says it in the post.
---
Remove it, damn thing almost crashes my console mid fight everytime somebody joins it and the message pops up in the corner - really pee's me off and nobody uses it for PvP given workshops an survival mode
---
I've been crashing constantly as well.  The one thing that does it more than anything else?
---
Overlays.
---
Every time I crash, I've been doing something like picking a lock, reading a note... basically, anytime an object is superimposed over the screen.  I've crashed twice tonight, and two of the crashes were reading notes.  I just get dumped straight to my desktop.
---
I don't want to talk about how many times I attempted that damn DMV quest before I finished it. I will destroy that damn Junk Mail overlay one day...
---
I've upgraded my graphics card in an attempt to fix the issue, but it's made no difference.  I'll get five overlays that are fine, and then... nope.  Or sometimes, the first overlay after I log on... crash.
---
Sigh... guess that's a sign it's time to actually finish *Kingdom Hearts 3*.
---
World events are very different to organized raids, though. Ostensibly, you're taking 8 of your buddies through the vaults. World events are a clusterfuck of everyone showing up and hoping everyone else does the mechanics
---
I do it daily.
---
Severs not lagging you are
---
Yeah it’s more “tolerates”
---
Or turn it back on?
---
If I recall correctly it is only 50😕
---
Please tell me what perks you have and what level you are?
---
Anytime the Encryptid event is going on the server seems to have a heart attack, they should have anticipated the level of activity around it. That's probably part of the reason for the 3 hour cooldown (plus the fact that it's "endgame" content).
---
You clearly havent tested it enough.
---
But they don't stack......
---
Automatic weapons received a larger durability buff.
---
One gets you 25 caps two gets you 40
---
Are you sure you aren't thinking of heavy automatic weapons? That's what the patch notes said..
---
GameStop Laws isn't how a video game economy is supposed to work?
---
When taken out of context your either
---
&gt;A.) A good gamer  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;B.) A seasoned terrorist
---
Soon CAMPs wont be destructable at all anymore. Just as people wanted.
---
With Whitesprings moving to clearly become some kind of 'community hub' it is only understandable that traders will want to build their CAMP as close to or on Whitesprings.
---
If they're going to make Whitesprings any kind of exlusion zone they should make it a nuke exclusion zone.
---
Just play the new sheepsquatch event. No shortage of downed players there
---
H/H reminds me of going head-to-head with my friends on Pokemon.  It's a great idea but each encounter just seems too one sided. There's rarely a dynamic fight.
---
I've seen an increase of legendaries dropping from normal trash mobs
---
pistols would like a word with you about being the worst weapons.
---
So many people are saying this that I feel like us like-minded individuals ahould get together and actually do this event properly
---
It's not just the perks.
---
Take the Laser Sniper barrel for example. It's damage is around half of that of a Hunting Rifle, while you need to wait ~3sec after every shot to even get that full damage due to the 'recharge' mechanic. Giving it much less damage and a slower fire rate.
---
A Laser sniper could have it's damage doubled and it would still fall short of the Hunting rifle, let alone the Lever-action.
---
Important perks not applying to it is just the cherry on top of the useless cake. Those perks alone won't solve the problem.
---
And let us display our Bobbleheads! I never use any of mine so I can store them in my stash and admire my collection.
---
No, it can happen a lot anytime there's an invalid LZ.
---
\&gt; most 
---
Note, she attempts to land on who has aggro. The rest of the players literally don't matter. Top aggro players tend to go on fences and bunker (more likely fences, if they're out to focus only on the queen, and avoid taking damage), explicitly being an invalid LZ. 
---
Aggro mechanics aren't completely known, but top DPS and low health (bloodied builds, the current meta) seem to contribute. 
---
It isn't guaranteed she'll bug out, as there's a lot of variables-- however she literally cannot bug out if everyone's away from invalid LZ's, and the ONLY time she completely bugs out has been when players are on invalid LZ's like the bunker roof fence.
---
It is not worth jeopardizing the event, and preventing spawns. Fight AWAY from the bunker.
---
yeah funnily enough sightings pretty much stopped once we had the technology to look for signs of tampering of "photographic evidence"
---
The heavy gunners need the roof and they still get attacked by the mobs. She usually lands right next to the bunker. Or sometimes right on top. Last week had the queen and a normal sb both on the roof at the same time. The normal sb got blown away in a couple seconds.
---
They confirmed place-able junk for a future update. I for one am making a bathtub full of beer bottles.
---
Challenges arent registering. I've discovered every where there is to go and I have 3 challenges for three places that didn't register it and is showing I haven't been to places that are clearly on my map.  
---
The kill hard enemies challenge is broken too, I've killed megasloths and legendary yao guai and it still won't register that I have. 
---
We still load into buildings twice. 
---
Our bags disappear into the ground. I've lost armor and legendaries to this.
---
When going through a silo, replacing the mainframe cores lags and when we need to replace the pipes, the game takes forever to register what were doing.
---
Yeah actually. Right now I have the max amount of lights making a heart in front of my base because I wanted some sort of custom decoration.
---
I mean, I want all bulk junk to be less weight, like lead and steel.
---
That's right. She usually lands next to the bunker. There are trees near the bunker so you need to keep away from them.
---
I fire a heavy gun from the roof and we always kill her. Once only 6 of us showed up. It took most of the 30 mins but we did it in the last 5 mins.
---
Ah, Now I see why they are all gone! lol
---
The prices are there to discourage you from purchasing from robot vendors, redirecting you to scavenge and scrap for your junk.
---
Yes, 100lbs lets me carry enough extra loot and aid to make it worth it.
---
Untill backpacks are added in its the only PA im using.
---
Well with an attitude like that?   lol.  Probably if they don’t see it in the post I’d be a hard pass on friending them anyway.
---
What attitude?
---
They still break too fast as well, a laser rifle breaks more than twice as fast as a regular combat rifle, while also dealing less damage.
---
I just sold something that was for 1 cap and it reset them.
---
Just kidding around but your very frank reply ‘ it literally says it in the post”.    I just thought it was funny.
---
Hugely YMMV, but it is a L2P experience. Yes it does help to announce to social media, and better yet a circle of friends.. but what I do is look at a map and count how many level 100+ players are there (50's barely beginning end game, its pretty baby), and if there's 6+ that's a solid chance of overkilling the SBQ. Again YMMV and depends on time of day and your server's activity.
---
if fighting in the nuke zone my game can't handle the graphics and locks up. If just outside it is usually Ok. So if I aim a nuke I leave drop site 9 clear so I can play it.
---
Wow, I thought the one over 400 I seen  was rare!
---
\&gt;  Legendary spawns are the same as they've ever been 
---
Well no, they did do a little rebalancing (they explicitly stated they nerfed whitesprings), but that was ages ago.
---
Correct. Vending is meant as a last resort
---
That’s impossible
---
Ah, was just pointing it. Guess it seemed kinda of gruff but wasn't meant to be. Lol
---
They should. I’ve been jonesing for a log cabin wall
---
It happened to me Thursday.
---
Why would something weight less when you put it all close together
---
Its really bad for me, averaging 30 fps at absolute most, I'm on pc (I7-7820x, 2080ti, 64gb ram and the games on an ssd).
---
Don't want to jinx myself, but I'm on PC on satellite internet and it's the best it's ever been. I used to lag out constantly, and was unable to do a SBQ without the server dropping me, but since the last update I've barely crashed at all.
---
Remember to post truth, and bring proof. Too many times I figure out nobody remembers the scientific method.
---
Just like how people think weapons are breaking faster now
---
That’s the thing, I’ve had the display bug when I pull things out of my stash, I’ve never had it display something I don’t have though. Biggest downside is the wooden armour I picked up yesterday are still there lol.
---
Heck if I know, why does scrapping junk make it weigh less? Why do steel and lead weigh less?
---
They aren't looking for the worst possible outcomes, these are old stories that everyone knows how they end. You on the other hand are trying very hard to see things in the best possible way.
---
Ill just tell you this: if you have to lie to yourself about X to enjoy that X, are you actually enjoying X?
---
"I am the strongest super mutant!" Shoots you with pipe rifle.
---
I'm always looking for a SBQ event. Probably just unlucky. I suppose you need to do a quick check of the higher level players.
---
 It's a disappointment if you fail the event but it does happen sometimes.
---
That's not true at all.
---
I've been playing since the beginning and I still haven't seen one.
---
I got one a long time ago.   Didn't know how but I held on to it.  It has a negative value.  Was hoping to mount it somehow when world items in your camp became a thing.  Put it in the toilet or something.
---
Yes it is,if you bulk anything else the only reason the weight is going a tiny bit down because the use of plastic when bulking
---
Jarvis, activate the house party protocol.
---
I appreciate the hell out of this post, 76 seems like a game without a decent wiki. I rely on YouTube and subreddits for information.
---
Selling as a whole sorry
---
Items I'm looking for are listed below =)
---
Happened twice to me today on PC.
---
Currently not on, but would love to have recipes for talons and carnivore. Will be on tomorrow. Can I add you and see if you're on tomorrow?
---
I'd love the robot workbench to be re-featured to match this. Maybe without Ada, we would'nt know how to use it past weapon mods, and instead, we'd make robot gauntlets. Mr. Handy saw and flamethrower hands, Assaultron claws, hell, maybe even armor. I'd love me some overclocked Sentry Bot wheels to go super fast.
---
I have been going to many of the same places I know Legendary enemies spawn and they are either very rare or just boss enemies.  Whitesprings is still pretty consistent, I managed to find a Two Shot Limb Damage Gatling Gun there when it was nuked.  AWOL Armaments and Uranium Fever have been my go-to events.
---
Check out InnovSurvivist on YouTube to see the locations I am talking about.  I have been to the locations in the Savage Divide, the Mire, and the Cranberry Bog.  All of them have been a bust except for WestTek and the Gulper Lagoon but I cannot call them reliable.
---
Yeah gt u1smoothOpr8r 
---
Send me a message on xbl and ill respond when i get on
---
The assault rifle we have is more based on the Lewis Gun. 
---
It’s also meant to be a LMG/supporting rifle hybrid . Rather than a in your face rifle. 
---
It does need more damage being bigger and all. And a durability tweak. 
---
The handmade, combat, Chinese assault and missing R-91 should fill that infantry roll with the bulky assault being covering fire model.
---
All depending on what kinda build you have or are going towards. The Bloodied build is what I use personally, and it’s not just the weapon that matters. You have to use your cards in a way that’ll make the weapon better.
---
Plastic weighs minus?
---
All mods are glitched
---
No. People are stupid rich as is. Selling ammo just pushes that further.
---
when I posted that I literally got home an hour earlier and it was already gone \*SADFACE\*
---
Me too. You can add me if you like Jay_31_
---
wellllll shit. thanks
---
No problem
---
Will do. My GT is kittielickie
---
The most recent patch has made it impossible to attach mods at the moment and can only hope it’s fixed this Tuesday
---
U use like 2 plastic and 20 lead to make 1 bulk lead,so the 2 plastic is ‘gone’ when u bulk
---
Okay but what if someone handed you a bunch of ammo they don't use so you can profit from it?
---
Don't hoard. I know this contradicts other posts but you don't really need much in mats unless you're building a camp. The only thing I would focus on gathering is adhesive, although you can make your own, screws, springs and ballistic fiber, last of which is rare and you're better off buying. 
---
You know about tagging tag those items as well as lead. Lead is seldom by itself, doing so will give you a good amount of steel and wood. 
---
Be mindful where benches are and collect weapons and armor when one is close to learn mods. I wouldn't necessarily focus on low end weapons, sell those at vendors. (Keep in mind where they are too)
---
I focus on ranking up luck for looting. Pharma farmer and scrounger keep me in stimpacs and ammo. Perception's butcher's bounty keeps me in food. 
---
I farm Morgantown airport for stimpacs. The best place to farm is fort defiance but you'll need to rank up a little to get there. 
---
Weapons (and armor) upgrade every 10 levels so don't become attached to anything. Maybe go down to the ash heap and start grabbing combat rifles. You can't use them until level 20 but you can get mods for them to use 38 which will make that ammo relevant, at least in low level areas. Combat rifles generally use 45, if you skip using pipe revolvers which are a low end weapon that uses 45 and just sell them, you'll have tons of 45 when you hit 20. Don't let the low damage numbers fool you, they're pretty good, especially with armor piercing mags. 
---
Handmade rifles are better. Get plans to build them asap. Farm patrol duty at the prison (if you can get it start) to get it free or check vendors in mid to high levels for plans to buy. 
---
Melee is best, even if you don't prefer it you should always keep one at the ready because enemies get close regularly. 
---
Choose your play style, specials focus on certain weapons amd skills (sometimes 2 specials) Rank up the specials for those weapons. Endurance doesn't but it does handle yoir health, rank it up but unlock cards for different specials until fireproof becomes available, a really good perk. Intelligence is about crafting and weapon durability. Agility handles armor durability for some reason.
---
What do you mean by collective? Do you all share a photo pool on xbox?
---
Why bulk with no benefit?
---
No sorry bro gone
---
Anyone familiar with Fallout 76 knows it isn't an MMO. Not sure why people assume an online rpg is inherently an mmo...
---
It's my on my gf's char and it's geared towards bloodied with full set of 2* bolstering CA. Thing is she tends to have her health above half most of the time. The low base damage of the AR makes me think that it really doesn't mean much against tanky enemies. I think maximum armour piercing is around 82% total with perks, mods and legendary. Since it's not my char I haven't done much testing with it.
---
Just in the in-game photo gallery
---
Can I get 2 scaly skins and a Herd Mentality please?
---
That sucks sorry man
---
*The US Army wants to know your location*
---
If you are on ps4, when you delete the picture from the in game album, the picture will still exist in your fo76 folder in your ps4 library. But yes, the limit is quite frustrating.
---
Sell it to players for a random amount. Or drop in at a train station.
---
It's a Beta. Changes are to be expected.
---
The mode's far more enjoyable now imo. With the changes to vendors, a stable income of caps is pretty easy to aquire now. With how it was before, the risk was greater than the reward imo. With how survival works at the moment, everyone's got a pretty fair shot at killing anyone provided they at least put some thought into their builds. That makes large player encounters a bloodbath. And with the lack of slap damage initiation, even the best builds can be felled by simply getting caught off guard.
---
It's pretty awesome imo, but the unpredictability is exactly why the massive loss of caps was such a burn. And the risks just keep getting steeper as you level up and after a certain level, you've really got nothing over other players save for a larger number and larger cap amount that you'll lose.
---
Over the last week, I've enjoyed some lengthy battles involving several people. Lots of them stayed for a while too, probably because no one's wallets we're getting cleared out. The caps were nice, but everyone was just slaughtering for fun.
---
Yeah it sucks that you can't make a killing by ...killing, but as someone that just enjoys a good skirmish, the lesser risks make it all the better. The less to lose the more brazen players get. The more brazen, the better the encounters imo.
---
If they go free to play and bring even more absurd microtransactions under the false pretense of server loads what do people who spent money on the game get? a pat on the back and a few credits? I see your point but it would sting so bad and piss of the player base even more in my opinion
---
These people seem to have a problem understanding the "Random" part of "Random number generator."
---
Similarly, the "ERMAGERD WEAPON DURABILITY NERF" is bollocks. Pre-"Nerf," my Hunting Rifle could last for two SBQ fights, and post-"Nerf," it lasts for... Two SBQ fights. Ten bucks says they're just not accounting for their Sheepsquatch runs.
---
That's basically selling a bullet for one cap each, if it's sellable scrap. Everyone would still makes boats of money.
---
Are we talking about against PVP or PVE? I know my Bloodied DCG does normally around 1400 dmg when nerd rage kicks in. I keep my rads high due to keeping it in that 20% range. I’ve never ran AA. So not sure on that
---
If you don’t mind a daily respawn and a bit of dungeoneering, in the Glassed Caverns at the end (Behind where you fight the Schorchbeast), you can loot Lt. Tagardy for 2 random pieces of BOS Combat Armour.
---
However the rarest to drop is the heavy chest piece so far
---
Same with PC!
---
Yeah
---
I get scrapping junk, taking the parts out of a type writer and only keeping some of it is gonna be lighter than the type writer. I dont agree with bulk steel and lead, but maybe the had a reason for that
---
There are still plenty of Destiny players who don’t know how to trigger Heroic events. It’s a universal problem.
---
Because you throw away the dross.
---
Claim  Poseidon workshop, can get 8 fusion cores per hour. Check lunch boxes and other containers at the railroad stations. That's where I dump my unused ammo. I'd help you out but am on PC. Hope this helps.
---
P2P trading is fucked too. I dump just about everything I don’t need on low level players.
---
WT actual F?
---
I'm willing to guess most of the time it's because of the healing factor mutation.
---
I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall with you guys this evening. 
---
There are things that bulk, that give benefits: 
---
Steel, lead: reduced weight.
---
Other bulk-able junk: it becomes sellable. 
---
There are things you can't bulk, like screws.
---
My question is WHY are they different? Why can you sell some in it's "raw" form, but others you have to bulk? Why do steel and lead reduce their weight, but none of the others? It all seems arbitrary and makes little sense. 
---
My OP was asking if there was something I was doing wrong, because it doesn't make sense to have some things this way, some things that way, and somethings still another way.
---
I was able to attack an emergency protocol mod on my excavator armor
---
Vendors have a problem which doesn't let you see their caps until you sell them something. So try that everytime you try to sell something.
---
Help lower levels, do SBQ or the impostor, as well as daily quests that's about it
---
Then its not really different than saving to your console's screen shots. Ps4 has mine organized by game so they're easy to find and sort.
---
Depends what you got banned for I guess. Some people got back in after a few weeks and other are well not. And some even ppl ought new game/accounts.
---
It’s better to go on with a group. Everytime I’ve done it solo, it’s a failure. Either people don’t show up, or they do but have no clue what to do. There’s a group of us who run the Queen regularly and we can take her out in under 4 minutes. The drops are mostly meh, but if you do it enough times, some good stuff does pop up. The goat can go fuck itself 😂 how many white fedoras does one person need?
---
Hopefully never.
---
Please repost this with the "Spoiler" tag to protect sensitive information. Do not post spoilers in the title.
---
&gt; So either you have never actually have done the event or you are the luckiest person to play this game.
---
 
---
I have run it four times and have not failed it once.  That's because I find what needs to be done and I do it, instead of complaining about  others are not  doing it.
---
 I ran the event tonight and was a conduit  for two pylons and someone else did the third. 
---
I wear T51 power armor with medic pump and lots of stimpaks and I die once per session at most. 
---
I use an anti-armor gatling gun with the stabilizer perk which  does well against it but I'm not the only one doing damage because    everyone there was contributing as far as I know. But then again, I don't know what everyone else there is doing because I am focused on one goal and that's killing the assaultron.
---
On Xbox I need to first 'interact' then it shows.
---
Maybe never try making a new psn a friend of mine had to it since bethesda never got back to him even he was submitting tickets almost everyday
---
Ok, joining you now
---
But then you wouldn’t know why the roses grow 😂
---
r/unexpectedlynotafalselinkmemecommentandletsalldownvotewhoevercommentstwentycharacterlimit
---
if they went free to play it would most likely lead to memberships, where if you paid you'll get membership and if not you'll be free to play, so yea a crap ton more micro transactions
---
That’s lucky, is it only power armour you can mod?
---
My only complaint really about teaming is that there are no non-verbal communications possible at range. Sometimes people invite me and I want to be able to tell them that I'm about to log off or etc. I hate to simply ignore a friendly invite when I can't accept.
---
The game has a secret mechanic to help deal with this
---
Unknown to most players it seems, there is actually a "stash all junk" button that..
---
well get this..
---
*Prevents you from losing anything when you die*
---
Absolutely insane right? I know
---
I’d just read the answers the other 5000 people that have asked this question on Reddit have received.
---
It said I got banned for having more than 10000 of an item and i very well may have. I just dont remember. I dont really want to get another account but I may just have to
---
If you have a, let's say a board. And you break it down into "wood", why would it weigh less? 
---
For that matter, why do I get more steel off a .44 pistol than I do a rifle, but get nothing from a blunderbuss?
---
I'd take 3 recipes.  Grounded, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon.  I can jump on in the next few minutes.  I'll do 5k if you throw in Talons.  Anything you looking for?  I have a decent stash of AA, Bloodied, etc.
---
680 or so. Like others, I've got my money's worth. I'm cautious of the sunk cost fallacy though in terms of effort and am ready to walk away. Bethesda needs players to stick around. I suspect the population has aged quite a bit and most low levels I see are alts.
---
Honestly you could have. Realistically it can be done if your not paying attention or don’t notice. 
---
Tbh I’d hit up BGS support and see if they’ll unban. If it was duped items then I doubt they will. But ammo or resources really should matter at this point.
---
Bears.
---
You might see a few in open areas of Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog. Good luck
---
On Xbox not too bad actually, even smoother then it used to run. Only problems I have is when a lot of players are hopping servers at once or fast traveling. So pretty much queen, sheep, and the old parade was the worse. I don’t even rubberband in Whitesprings anymore unless something is wrong with my Wi-Fi
---
Yeah weightles ap refresh armor and lever actions and hand mades
---
Take the road by Fort Defiance North, follow it until you're next to the monorail path, turn east. Walk probably 150m, should be a chicken triplet
---
That's not the point of this post at all, go find somewhere else to whine about little things that have no impact on anyone
---
It used to do this on ps4 alot but it hasn't happened to me for awhile now.
---
I’m not sure. It’s the only thing I’ve tried
---
I was able to attach a mod on PA but not craft on PA. Was not able to attach a mod on weapons but was able to craft on weapons. ???
---
Actually if you have another herd mentality I’d take that too
---
I'd appreciate the graphical bugs getting fixed too. Gatling plasma and automatic ultracite laser still don't shoot anything. The invisible projectiles they fire are just disappointing.
---
Some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't. 
---
I guess that's the whole game in a nutshell, ha.
---
Sorry guy game invites me and thought it was part and left world. 
---
Did you still need that?
---
Really good idea with new stuff (mutations specifically) that really should've been in the game to begin with
---
Yeah if I could get another herd mentality and the 2 scaly skins that’d be great :)
---
Steel does as well, doesn't it? I was at 780 the other day with 950 scrap steel. I bulked it up, put the resulting bulks back in storage and my overall was back to 756.
---
Legendary hunting, events. Daily/weekly challenges. Explore if you haven't already. Help people.
---
Did you already do it ?
---
This is my problem and exactly why I haven’t stepped foot in survival although I’d love to try it. I’m carrying 200+ purified water, canned dog food, diluted rad/rad-x, chems, nuka colas... they’re not fitting in my stash any time soon. Slowly selling them off but can only do so much daily :(
---
I had supermutant parts. Leg, hand,...
---
No, I haven't. Made my support ticket in December. However, Bethesda stated in their reply to my ticket that it could take up to six months. We'll have to wait a bit longer, I guess.
---
The question is, is $30 a price you're willing to pay based on the opinions of a group of people who have, I would guess, a generally positive view of the game? 
---
Personally, I've gotten my money's worth and more since day one and was happy to have pre-ordered it.
---
MMM - especially considering that you can buy the unbulkable items as bulk sets from vendors, like bulk screws and bulk ballistic fibre.
---
Yes but as a wiki I usually use some youtubers that have posted about it... I'd actually love to see an actual WIKI about Fallout 76... can someone make this happen?
---
There are none
---
Bears, beets, BSG...
---
I had around 13 000 atoms by playing since beta. But now i have completed all challenges, so i can do only daily/weekly which are becoming stupidly not doable.
---
Ok thanks👍
---
If Bethesda went that way with Fallout 76, what kind of membership do you believe pre-paid owners should get?
---
I’d probably go the way of an atom allowance and atom store discounts, maybe increased chance to meet rarer cryptids as well
---
This is the best $30 bucks game I've ever played for over 30 years. Even if it has subscription, most likely I will play it still.
---
Yes because u use 2 plastic with each bulk
---
Ammo is so easy to get the components to make is why it's not for resale.  I just drop that at whatever station I'm at during that specific time.
---
But with up to 24 whole people on a server, it's just super intensive.
---
Can't really stash all junk when the stash box is overfilled with junk :P
---
But that's only using 64 plastic. 64 Plastic doesn't weigh 24 pounds?
---
Me and two friends all play leveling up together. We think its great!
---
Wow the day before the wild Appalachia update huh...thanks for sticking it out for so long.Trooper.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
I definitely am not losing caps and sell the vendors SerumS until the broke every day.  Thanks for the advice but i know exactly what I'm doing.
---
I still like mixed zones because you can farm low level mobs like robots for the same parts as high levels. Plus it seems more lore friendly that The Forest is easier to live in.
---
I've switched from semi-auto laser pistol to semi-auto 10mm and I feel the 10mm does more damage even though laser on paper does more damage per shot. I think it's mainly because 10mm has armor pen.
---
In general, I feel pistols, both ballistic &amp; energy, who gets no armor pen whatsoever does too little damage to even be useful as a sidearm in most cases. Armor pen just decides everything, and honestly I think it's kind of absurd.
---
Just play Spotify in the background.
---
True,strange then,u can look it up somewere,stil only lead and alu
---
Cool lol
---
I think they should make a room inside whitespring with enough spots for vending machines so that each person on the server could have a spot if they wanted and they’d all be in one place.
---
I have a 3 star Mutants Handmade with +15% vats and bash dmg.  Zealots Lever Action with +1 PER and bash, both lvl 45-50.  On now to at least buy the recipes.  5k and the 2 guns for grounded/scaly/speed demon/talons/electically charged?
---
Same here - tried to install a calibrated shock on my X01.  Same message, etc.  I even built a brand new leg, tried to install on that leg, same results.   Same with weapons.  Mods are fubar.
---
...and missiles, and crossbow arrows and ...
---
I wish I was a girlie like the majority of MMO players although they are mostly men playing as girlies and my dearrrrr...
---
Papa 👴🏻😎
---
They are tired and because you still play, they can't kill whole game, without their name being in all media.
---
If they go ftp, im deleting the game
---
Dumb
---
sorry not interest in those prefixes.  I more look for instigating anti armor bloodied and weight reduced.
---
I sold out of scaly skin so sorry
---
&gt; how many white fedoras does one person need?
---
All of them.
---
&gt;  It seems ridiculous to me that people want more legendaries, 
---
You seem to ignore  the fact that legendary drops have been continually nerfed.  It's not even a question of wanting more legendary drops, but ***not wanting less***, which we are continually getting.  The most recent patch nerfed legendary drops in Watoga.
---
Very constructive.
---
The first wave of people who pre-ordered the game where the best. Second wave at the beginning of December where Kool. After Christmas and a discounted triple A title a wave of douchebags. Wait till it's free you'll have every non speaking English person in this game just running around in underwear blowing up camps. Contributing nothing. Having nothing good in there inventory. Keep it the way it is. Let it die. The king is dead. Long live the king
---
Still have the recipes?
---
If it bleeds it pays and will buy stuff. They will rotate product in a cycle like super markets, just BGS aren’t selling beans.
---
Honestly no clue, it would really depend on how much money they would want to try and milk out of us. Most likely a cosmetic or something but they could surprise us if they went this route
---
Yes
---
I agree, we are a dedicated fan base let's get this Goin!
---
Thank you friend :)
---
Huh - thanks - will do. Maybe I did some lead at the same time and didn't remember- anyway, I particularly recall the figures because I was so tight for weight and didn't think that bulking steel would help that much.
---
What if they went FTP, and added equal amounts of free DLC and atom store cosmetic items at the same place they’ve been adding them? How would that change the gameplay experience you’re having now other than bolstering the player base, increasing revenue in the atom shop (more new players buying what would be old cosmetics to us) and more free DLC to enjoy? 
---
I was against it at first as well, but I just want more new players and a way for the game to continue to support bigger and better DLC (free).
---
Well - I can understand your frustration. I think part of the attraction is to get the better of the game or bethseda.
---
That I am going to get my moneys worth despite the occassional shit experiences etc.
---
🤣
---
Sorry
---
Did you get that?
---
Sounds like he didn’t kill all the mobs and died and now is on reddit, thanks for the time my guy o/
---
My biggest problem is hearing that terminated employees had been detected, followed 0.5 seconds later by the crackle of some dick one-shotting them with some duped explosive weapon they bought and then whining on area chat about the lousy legendary drop.
---
They could be giant oversized wheels like on grass friendly tractor mowers, it would be really funny 😁
---
What about a free to play server and a premium server that only gets the DLC for paying players? Or maybe survival mode is free to play and adventure mode is for paid players?
---
They were probably bored of the fight since we dropped nukes on her since last year.
---
They did announce that all dlcs will be free for fallout 76, and ive payed for my game, to make it ftp will rip us off, and if they Denise to have a subscription like lets say eso, then they would rip us off even more. I Think it would bring bre players, but us veterans will prob quit.

Eagle eyes electrically charged grounded healing factor herbivore herd mentality speed demon and talons
---
&gt; Anyone familier with an mmo understands how nessisary a wiki page is
---
Spelling aside, (holy shit it's bad)  the title itself is absurd. It is not an MMO.  There is no point to this post.
---
A wiki exists, it's up to the community to make it happen. My best piece of advice is to take a piece of the game you love and make sure it's on the wiki. Whether it be an event, gun, quest or hidden part of the game. Post about it on the wiki.
---
Definitely  worth $ 30 Cn. I paid $48 ( AUD ).  I think our dollar is about the same.
---
I did it twice last night with just one one other player.  Yes that guy -- the one shot wonder.  Fuck him.
---
I'm not sure how easily this can be done, but a table for possible legendary roles on each weapon would be awesome. Maybe exchange rates as well, I'm not sure how popular exchanging is on this sub but some sort of catalog would help when buying and selling legendaries. I mean with only in game currency, charging real money for ingame drops is just gross.
---
Maybe It Is Because You Capitalize Every Word.
---
10mm, 5.56 and .38 are pretty common just by killing enemies. Get e sword and slash those scorched. You can also farm lead+steel and craft your own.
---
"they asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard."
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
Finding exploits in software as we know can be quite lucrative. It seems to be in the nature of some players to attempt at least, to break the game.
---
Try it again with some steel only and let me know please :)
---
Ok, I'll take grounded and speed demon.  How do we meet up?  Your GT in the OG post was not found.
---
Would you eat me? I'd eat me so hard.
---
Git gud then
---
Gt u1smoothOpr8r
---
I've seen some amazing work posted on reddit, I'm not sure how much of it has been documented into the wiki but I'd hate to see it disappear into the void.
---
I never complained about the new survival mode, but if you're such a huge pvp fan why not focus on a BR game ? Let's be honest here, fallout can never be a good pvp game.
---
You're dense, the point of the post is the wiki needs more active contributors, which it does.
---
I believe Pete Hines mentioned at Pax that he had a vision for better rendering C.A.M.P.s and making them permanent within servers so that they’re still visible to other players after logging out so if that’s to come to fruition it’ll be something to look forward to.
---
With Player Vending, it would be nice to have a window when using the vending machines to access the shops of other players from where you are since not all camps are easy to find/reach (safety from attacks/griefing)
---
Its a game that was designed to be played with people, personally all of my mates hated it so I've been a solo for a long time, and i always end up with some random. The whole game is based on random luck. Some of the best stories you'll get out of it aren't actually the stories that are written but the absolute wackiest stuff that has happened. If you want a game where you know what you want and get what you see go for it but this game will challenge you in ways that will most likely leave you in some disappointment but will have keep looking for that gem around the corner, like teaming up with a bugged scorchbeast that's friendly and killing everything with it, or sharing a nice time with some random that you've met. Unfortunately this style has left a sour taste in a lot of peoples mouths, but if your willingly to put all chips on the table it's a gamble that personally i found was worth making
---
It happened since the beta, either you get dc, or the game crashes or the boss corpse instantly disappears, etc. The end-game is a joke and nonexistent..I'm waiting winter 2019 to come back and see these "raids/dungeons" that should have been in the game since day 1.
---
The game has a crappy reputation for a reason, it's not just all lies from haters..
---
There was no such thing back then. Your generation discovered it.
---
I would rate your build  a shy  4/10.
---
Yeah, still didn't find you, not sure why.  Come to me Threebicycle976.
---
That should gives idea to bethesda :D
---
wait until you try posting on the market...
---
Nope always there, before I was bloodied I used to skirt around said crater.
---
Just play it in the background? Alt-tabbing out of game doesn't break it like other Bethesda games, and if thats too much, just control it from your phone
---
I feel like spotify integration wouldn't work too well as you'd have to create a new interface in the pip boy to search for songs or albums or whatever, there would be more lag due to increased downloads (neglible unless you have Australian internet) and you'd also need account logins which provides a security issue (see: bethesdas history with security, including tickets being viewable by random people)
---
Reduce the legendary drop rate for anyone who has a duped weapon or armor.
---
You know that you have two random spawning points right within easy walking distance, right? I mean that Close, that even a Cat should make it.
---
Where?
---
Should probably list what system you're on
---
i forgot
---
the rule may be kind of stupid but you're also being ridiculously petty lol, the content of your post could have easily fit in the title without all the snarky filler you put, you're just trying to bait more people into clicking on your post
---
Why are you here ranting, just stop playing and get on with your life.
---
It’s just a game!
---
Before buying mind that it's pretty bugged. Putting it inside your building will put on the roof instead. Also all grass around your camp will immediately vanish and won't re-appear until you remove the status and travel out/in your camp. Pretty disappointed about this one. 500 atoms into nothing, since in this bugged state it is completely unusable for me.
---
Hmm well I suppose I suck at exploring then, now it's interesting that this crater looks similar to the one close to Huntersville, now I'm wondering what made this crater, according to the lore a nuclear bomb is not an option here....
---
I was looking for something and couldn't find anything new to craft. Definitely not implemented properly.
---
I realize I'm 3 months too late but I'm curious as to whether or not you found your plans and if so, where at? I've been server/spawn hopping like crazy and I'm not having any luck.
---
I tried to initiate the event when it popped up earlier and it wouldn’t let me press the button to start the trap.
---
Someone presenting facts to deter spreading of misinformation is apparently whining. 
---
***TIL***
---
There are actually 2 craters like this, my camp is beside one and the other is a little south of that towards fort Defiance
---
Ya people asked for alot of shit,problem is Bethesda only seems to implement stuff that benefits them in some way.
---
Not even close, I would take any unmodded pistol over a fully decked out legendary laser rifle any day of the week lol. It really sucks because I love the energy weapons in this game but they are just so garbage. Plasma Rifle is so fun to shoot lol.
---
Joke’s on the guy that killed me instead of reviving me. I was a conduit.
---
You should have more upvote so U/Valseek can see it !
---
Soldiers like you make me hopeful we can reconcile our differences
---
You are the one that’s clueless.....lol
---
The optimal build part assumes any of the adds get near me. Demo expert most certainly benefits my explosive shotgun. Honestly I should've been throwing grenades out to proc Adrenaline. Agreed on positioning too. I could've done way better, but that's sort of the point. With proper strategy it's not a hard boss. 
---
I like your ideas though. Everyone just seems to jump into PA and go melee the boss. Then they get 1 shot. A suppressors gun could be a cool idea. And stim spamming is a great idea for PA users if they come prepared. 
---
Honestly the problem with this boss is that you get very little prep time compared to the SBQ.
---
Sorry bout the short order fulfillment.  Thanks
---
From my experience my medics combat shotgun healed 40-50% of my health.
---
I want those Vault Interior room walls.
---
Never thought i would die fighting side by side with a child of atom.
---
The aim seems like it's to encourage players to trade with each other which I like doing
---
I appreciate the gesture, and I go there from time to time to see if the plans there. Thanks a bunch!
---
Salut tu es sur quelle plateforme ? Je recherches des joueurs fr hl pour un futur clan
---
Sur PS4
---
Sure thing! I'm OneNudeBanana.
---
Maybe thats because they are company with a lot of people gain their money from that company
---
The games economy needs fixing desperately. Literally with a mule you can bypass the cap limit. Hell with a mule you can ignore stash limits too. 
---
Limiting our ability to store stuff, but then allowing us to dump things onto mules is an issue.
---
The patch notes did say "significantly" less though. I wish it went into more detail, because i played survival for the first time on this basis. Yet when inwas one shotted by a player i lost all of my 102 stimpacks.
---
Join my game, bout to do one now
---
Where is the power source for this? I cant find it anywhere
---
I've just started to use laze guns and I can sag it's defoe very undermelming.
---
All good.  Hit me up if you get another scaly plan.   Nice suit btw.
---
The game is still a mess. Each patch fixes something and breaks others. We have no idea how mechanics work so we just develop a "feel" for things. And when things feel different people scream bloody murder. 
---
Just server hop till you find a golf club vomiting legendaries then likely you'll see a lot in other locations.
---
👍thanks
---
I have a full set of troubleshooters armour , seem to work wery well but the pylon damage was brutal. Is there any way to reduce the damage from the pylons ?
---
Yeah I will for other stuff. Hopefully the burrows proves a fun challenge to solo.
---
Same problem here from time to time!
---
Same Mutation ( Herd mentality), PS4.
---
Wasn't aware that this Mutation could be a possible reason.
---
But the shared card just disappearing ( or being non- shared) is not resticted to Hard Bargain with me. Had times, when I was not able to share any card whatsoever and times when it seemed to be restricted to only some ( randomly).
---
Double checked for any illnesses or anything that might have downgraded my Charisma, but ended up with just acceptence to this mystery.
---
Good to hear, that someone  else has the Same problem.
---
Now that's good
---
In the map where the flag of fort Defiance touches the railay. And down ( ur Up) the path to the lucky hole mine. Take some Server jumps and you will easily recognise the spot :)
---
I reckon.. and masks etc too..
---
Same here buddy! Been collecting legendaries for 2 months. Some are really good stuff like 2\* Anti-armor Grognaks Axe and 3\* handmade from my first encryptid run, and much much more. It's been real trouble with the stash lately because of that. I even modded every armor ultra-light and weapons modless so I'd get everything out of the stash size. I might have to get rid of the junk next since I have all the aid and heavy weapons on me with weight reduce perk cards. Basically I can't play soon because of my carry weight so I'm kinda hoping for vending and Pyrveyor rather sooner than later.
---
Yes. FIX your game please !
---
Dont worry bro out of 12 times i battled her i got to actually loot her once, 5 times disconnect, 2 times damage bug, 4 times couldnt loot her because of continuous load glitch. I havnt battled her in over a month because im over wasting resources for nothing
---
Saw you running around with your 5 caps bounty till you got killed for it, haha. Fail.
---
I ran it for the past couple days, server hopping after completing my circuit.
---
Nary a Legendary to be seen.
---
It also seems it's not just me as there are absolutely less and less players running around Watoga when I check the map now.
---
I think it's another Shadow Nerf that came with the clothing crafting nerf to stop people from getting caps from selling to vendors.
---
In other fallouts, getting ammo/gear/aid from vendors was fine because the game had tons of quests to get you to explore the whole map. In a game like this, making more incentive to scavenge is a good idea because then it gives players incentive to run around and explore.
---
Well not ALL mods. Just the pine box mods you get from vendors and find lying around. The mods you learn from plans and scrapping weapons &amp; armor still work.
---
Well howdy there, I do play on PC and I am around level 32. Althought I wont be able to play at all this week due to vacation but after I'll be free
---
You can find those in In a underground waste storage place, westek dotted super mutant body’s there
---
You should read this, OP did the maths on the logic behind the bulk vs. not bulk benefits. Basically as others have said; only bulk aluminium and lead as they weigh less after plus the plastic usage. Everything else only decreases by the plastic amount so is only worthwhile to do when selling. 
---
Conversely; the raw junk you can sell unbulked; fibre optics, asbestos, gold, silver etc. are what I sell off keeping an ambient of 50 each in case they’re needed in something I don’t build currently. 
---
I find that you get plenty of raw junk with a value even when only picking up things I’ve got as marked with the magnifying glass e.g. asbestos is found in cigarettes but I’m only interested in the plastic. 
---

---
"*How* ***DARE*** *a company that creates a product or service try to achieve a profit in order to pay employees to continue to provide the same product or service I am using and would like more of in the future!!*"
---
Honestly, I wish all of the people that complain about a game company making money would start their own companies so they could give away their games for free.
---
I wouldn’t mind continuing playing, but my character is an alcoholic so doing the questline is important to me. 
---
It’s ruining my role playing not being able to finish it.
---
Because the item you can bulk are the most commons and the possibility to have those materials in great numbers are high, on the contrary screw and radioactive materials are very rare and don’t need to be bulked.
---
I'm a bloodied build, low health is a must but I also switch to an AAE handmade for Robots and Power Armor. Apart from that bloodied is my main choice, although wihh certain perks a AA gun can do just as much damage as a BE weapon. For example bloodied guns don't ignore armor, therefore you have to do big damage to hurt the enemy where as AA with certain perks ignores a lot of armor thus breaking through and doing just as much damage. Just have a few guns. I carry 2 AA, and 3 Bloodied rifles and nothing can get past me. Only real threat is the Queen really.
---
I earned the Stimpak plan on completion of the Meditation Event up at the temple. In fact, both times I completed it gave me a medical/Drug plan. I got the Fury plan there too.
---
In decent games, developers are carefully planning the economy of the game. In Bethesda games, the economy has been included without any planning.
---
If you think about it as a storage box it makes sense, bulks take up less space as loose parts but weigh the same so yeah
---
Same happened to me yesterday. Game froze over encryptid event when i tried to respawn. It was very laggy btw. Its seems whenever graphic content is overloaded console cant manage with it.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests
---
Not yet complete as new quest will be rolling in, but good for now.
---
And with two, you could just have friends trade kills to get the rewards nonstop.  Adding in even one more person would stop that.
---
I'm lvl 43, my age is 33. I should of clarified.
---
I'm always down to play, and help out. What times do you usually play?
---
Buy the plans and scap them I got all the mods in about 20.
---
Assassin sentinel armor (they take no damage at all)  , Chamelion armor and vat crit is the meta in survival mode 
---
He was probably using bloodied build and vat crited you
---
but the plans cost about 2000 caps,prety expensive
---
This is the end game of FO76. Hoard all kind of garbage as much as you can.
---
There are Legendaries all around, I constantly bump into them, especially along the road from watoga through to the mire. From Cave crickets to Super Mutants...
---
If anything I'd say the legendary drops have got better since the latest patch. Actually getting 3 stsr drops and decent armor pieces, weapons etc.
---
Anything that might affect your chances of buying ATOM will definitely be rejected. Sorry pal.
---
Unless player 1 has 2 friends :\^ )
---
If this game was free then yes but all the pay to win you want but it's not I played full pirce for this game (week after it was half off ..... yep ) so I expect there to be no trace of any pay to win. If it was free put all the pay to win you want I don't give a fuck but I payed for it so if they put pay to win in it I expect my almost 100bucks back after taxes so I can use it on the pay to win.
---
It's aluminum and lead that go down in weight, steel is exactly the same unless you are counting the 2 plastic you used to bulk them.
---
Nice don't care
---
i have a full decked out pistol + explosive build which gets 210 damage per shot from an explosive furous western.
---
i can get the same damage from a grognak axe in power armor without any cards.
---
theres also no armor penetration for pistols.
---
What about side by side with a friend?
---
Whitesprings blast zone can fail too, many times only a few mobs showed up or I was kicked from the server..
---
Sometimes I totally forgot there are laser weapons in the game, I’m lvl 90 and I never seen a legendary Laser weapon drop.
---
I’d like to see this in the future maybe even 10 rounds for 1 cap or even 20 for common stuff like .38
---
For now I just load it into the suitcases at the train stations
---
Headshots all you chumps got to defeat my mad skills?
---
It would be good if I could find him! I've only seen it once in 175 hours played
---
Best £60 I ever spent. Just don't treat it as a fallout 5, because it's not intended to be that
---
I appriciate your feedback, I will edit the post to have better spelling :)
---
If you're on PS4 hit me up, sounds like we're a lot alike.
---
Says a lot when months after a Fallout release the wiki is bare bones still.
---
I... never realized how much I needed this until now.
---
There is no "hardcore players" anymore in this game. They all exited after 1 week playing. There is only "Bethesda I want red skirt to my character and Bethesda please let me hoard more junk to my stash and make it infinite" people playing. These people could fail to kill any enemy even it would stand still and do nothing.
---
IT was nerfed because its charge damage wasn't working right, before even a max charge was only doing that base 80. Now it is actually charging and doing more damage per round loaded. Don't know exact number though.  
---
Think it was nerfed so you are not doing like 1k damage in a shot with it.
---
Killed a lvl. 91 Deatclaw in the Divide the other day...pretty sure I ran into a lvl. 71 Scorched guy yesterday. I’d never seen higher than 63 before.
---
My bloodied assault rifle only does 65 more damage than a stock handmade
---
agree. In the meantime be a nice guy and drop that ammo at a traiding station case i.e.. Thats what i do.
---
Besides that, after the last patch i got plenty caps (are 1400 caps per day not enough?) 
---
IMO this is not a urgent matter
---
Just my 2caps ;)
---
I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer!
---
You have to activate the calendar on the wall. There is no glitch. Just look at the calendar after setting the dryer and washer.
---
Not everything is a bug or glitch. Sometimes it’s the player...
---
&gt;We need you for the Fallout 76 wiki! Anyone familiar with an MMO understands how necessary a wiki page is for new players as well as veteran players for referance. The wiki page for our beloved FO76 needs some love. Please, for the love of atom, update the wiki, most info is out of date Fallout 4 stats and pictures.
---
FTFY :)
---
Devs have straight up said that's exactly the reason.
---
This game performance is trash.
---
Idk where to find them
---
Well it's a survival game...
---
Nevermind months, I had to work an 8 hour shift before I could play Fallout 4 and damn near everything I looked up *then* was already answered.
---
I would like to see you try and make an "economy" in game.
---
I had three of them until recently, I think I dropped or sold two, now I have the one, will probably just drop it in the Overseers stash at her CAMP.  Don't need it, don't want it.
---
Did you actually find the bait? Or just a reference to it in the notes? I have a theory, if we can get it hands on some of that bait...
---
\&gt; The argument of immersion 
---
If immersion is an issue have the UI display it as the pipboy's connection to whatever server/satellite it uses to detect events/show map etc.
---
Usually when it doesn't show in pop boy it meant legendary effect on the weapon is broken. I have the same problem with furious on my weapons and rad resist on armour pieces.
---
Yah know I’ve always supported this option before but I just gave it literally 1 second of thinking and I realize why they don’t.

Since Bethesda obviously doesn’t want to make it so you can have “0.25 caps” or “1/2 cap” they can’t let us sell ammo without making everyone in the game filthy rich. Think. How much ammo do you have stockpiled? If every single piece of that = 1 cap each, everyone would instantly have over 1000+ caps at *least*! And then same for scrapping. What are you going to get from a single bullet that you could realistically use to craft something else? Literally nothing.
---
Any aye, that’s my talk, thx for reading.
---
Oh, I see. Well, I usually play around 6-10 CEST but that might be reduced due to exams coming up
---
Is it because it sucks?
---
Are you high bro?
---
They MIGHT have done this to push players to interact and Trade with each other
---
Do you seriously expect a logical answer?
---
So you are trying to say that Bethesda isn't doing "secret nerfs". Its already proved that they do sometimes. Some people do datamining regularly and they will see a lot of changes that are not reported in official patch notes. If you are one of the Bethesda's fanatic lovers please try to understand that some people are making arguments based on facts.
---
Well it's unbalanced probably because scrubs like you think they're good with there full ass sent set they bought for $20 ok eBay and duped AAE shotgun or AASS power fist, bullying lower levels because they don't know you can't be killed
---
Nukacrypt.com posts the codes for each silo every week.
---
When you search a container near the camp/cave it states it's smarty's bait for large creatures with some warnings but doesn't put it in your inventory, I closed it before taking a screen shot so I cannot confirm.
---
I will be going through with another character soon so I hope to capture the full details
---
I remember attempting to update the Fallout new Vegas wiki the day lonesome road and I almost felt like it was a competition. I updated one weapon and my update was soon over written with a much higher quality description, Stat explication andlocations to find the weapon.
---
It doesn't show your build for me
---
Yes, inert fluxes no longer have a value and cannot be sold.
---
I sell corn and razor grain for like 1c each to the vendor
---
Oh dammit. I got them through trades I spent so many caps lol. Thanks for letting me know
---
Explosive is wank on heavy weapons. My BE gatling gun does 829 with perks and explosive adds minimal damage. 10% damage whilst aiming would be better on a gauss or vats Crit
---
Thanks man I'm terrable at spelling XD
---
I think you missed the point of the post.
---
Jukeboxes are always on. If folks are visiting the base music is always playing.
---
Radios are not.
---
Is it possible with the coming dungeon/raids, they are nerfing the normal location of legendary farming to funnel people where they want them to go, into the dungeon/raid?
---
I'm using only bloodied now as i never found broken bloodied
---
I didn’t, you leave the server so your radio turns off, just turn it back on.  It’s not hard to walk over a hit a button
---
i got that too.
---
edit 2:  verified that when i reload all my weapons and log off, when i return, my weapons are all unloaded.
---
Gotcha thanks for your helpful feedback. 😂
---
I'm still pissed you can't tell known plans or ammo
---
Before the latest patch I've only found  
---
1 legendary 1 star weapon  and a lot of 1 or 2 star armor.  Last night I did get 3 legendary 3 star  weapons in 3 events and 3 star armor. 
---
After the uranium event I was at the vendor from White springs station when I 've gotten  attacked by 4 green creatures ( The ones you see at the WSR , can't remember their names ) . 
---
I quickly did quut the trade.
---
There was a 1 star and a 3 star trying to eat me.
---
I ran out the station , jumped on the roof and killed 2 creatures.  The 2 legendary's ran to hide, and then I took them out one be one and did get some nice loot.
---
So I was happy  to be the  lucky legendary hunter of the weekend. 
---
I'm level 60 and It was my best legendary run ever...
---
I always thought that Bathesda did not want me the have any good weapons.   😂😂 after last night I was happy like a little child 
---
Still looking for that one jewel of a legendary shotgun....
---
Here is a quick example the mutation serum in game costs 25k each, I recently bought a couple of serum at 200 caps each from a trader, never give your caps to the fucka robots just trade with others players and you can get almost everything you need at Onest prices, check r/market76 or r/fo76bazaar
---
Would vendoring the items and buying them back fix it, or is it worse then that?
---
That's cool - the more caps we spend on people, the better the economy does in theory
---
I’ll give it a go, good idea
---
First Fallout game for me. Got it day one. Really got into it before it came out. Stuck with it through all the fixes and patches and now it's a huge part of my life. It may not mean anything for anyone else, and that's perfectly fine, but to me, it says something. A game has to have something special to grab my attention. Something about 76 does.
---
Agreed, even with hard bargain maxed out, the prices are still appalling
---
the biggest problem is the lack of decent guns that use 38. i have over 2000 of if it and no players want it since only pipe weapons use it
---
I mean you already can with anything other than brick so why not use brick then inside use the barn walls and doorways
---
I’ve begun using an automatic laser pistol as a backup weapon, mostly for use against super mutants and robots, which it seems most effective against, at least when compared to my lever-action, vampire 10mm SMG, and Blade of Bastet.
---
The rule more you carry more you drop still applies
---
What new players..
---
At least I would have done a little planning on how it works. There is no need to search for a model from afar because we live with economy system. In Bethesda's model, all goods have a fixed price. Goods with condition price are determined by condition. Merchants have a daily limit on sales. This model is as simple as it can be. It makes the economy generic and boring. Real economic is based on availability, demand and supply. None of these factors are taken into account in the Bethesda's economic model.
---
If you think fo76 sucks why use this sub?
---
Wait, we can activate all three ourselves? Really wish I knew that last night. The event failed because only myself one of other person seemed to be able to keep two of the pylons active.
---
I'd have to see repeatable proof. I am regularly the one she aggros and I've had only 5-10 instances where she flew off map. 2 of the times I was pulling aggro on the bunker.
---
What effects does it have?
---
Every enemy can be killed solo including sbq and sheep, that's what I'm doing, I gave up with team play in fo76 unless i play with a friend.
---
Its so hard not to want to strangle them seeing as how many of them are so damn simple.
---
Thing is though, I dont remember a single post ever saying they would pay for repair kits... or even asking for them in general, Ive maybe seen the odd comment about how new vegas had repair kits and this didn't, but never anything substantial.  
---
  
---
I even did a search of this sub after they were announced and could find exactly **0** posts with the words "Repair Kit" or "Repair Kits" in them
---
Damn, I miss that asshole
---
I did the event for the first time last night and failed. Only me and other person were able to keep a pylons active. Whoever manned the third kept dying until everyone got scared and focused on robots instead, the robots which were already being 95% handled by me anyways. Had they even focused on the damn Sheepsquatch the slightest when it was vulnerable we might have won.
---
More lag, but maybe a free server but you can only get to level 15 and the first is the only accessible area is the forest. Once you reach 15 you cannot play anymore unless you make a new character. 
---
FTP will make this company abuse and justify pay-to-win mechanics.
---
So its been over a week now and there's **STILL** no response from Bethesda on this issue
---
Please explain how repairing a weapon is pay to win. 
---
In PvE, it actually helps other players if a strong attacker's weapon breaks, he can repair instantly and help everyone. 
---
In PvP, every fight is done in 1 melee hit, or a few shots, which wouldn't cause a weapon to break. Even if it did, it wouldn't matter, because the fight is over.
---
So tell me, bandwagon, how me repairing things faster makes it pay to win.... in a non-competitive (no worldwide leaderboards, no lasting competitions, etc) game that is designed for us to work together *more often than not*.
---
"mm love low elvels....once they hit lvl 18 I hate them but some to my place for a great time and lots ooot"loot"
---
Trolls gotta troll.
---
I would recommend just getting other people to help and/or do all the work
---
Someone was feeling hungry when they posted this.
---
IMO need at least a couple of PA. No need to stick to only one.  Excavator is great for every day use, but I would take another PA to a fight. Each PA only eats 10 of your weight budget plus you get to show off your PA skins. PA is lighter than a lot of weapons, lol.
---
I suggest you hop over to one of the market subreddits. Youll find plenty of people throughout the day that sell and buy junk. Hell I have regulars for dogfood. Its feels good trading around and actually interqcting with others instead of just robots.
---
As a dataminer I would love to help contribute
---
I haven’t played in a couple months, but last I did I would kill her every day with my friend. She is an absolute joke if you are using power armour and melee build. After landing a few times she would be dead. Unless they changed a lot since I played, melee is king in this game.
---
I'm 50/50 on the idea, its good I guess in the sense that people cant take your shit without a consequence, but I often find abandoned junk bags on the floor that people have no interest in coming back to.  
---
Maybe if they unlocked themselves after a certain time?  
---
The only other point is I dont really see this as a big problem, theres so many places and opportunities to stash your junk dropping it in a lost fight during an event is really on the player
---
Then the players love you and follow you around everywhere wanting more. Not all, but a few.
---
Listen to yourself.
---
You just stated 'some of the playerbase' asked for this.
---
Why would that make sense for them to cater to a minority.
---
The problem is that ImposterSquatch is a timed event with a decent paywall on it. I feel like people are panicing when they join in to what is simple a clown fiesta if an event.
---
Now hopefully raids dont have time limits so we can actually hash it out with the people we join with. If so I think we will have a pleasent expirence and have everyone "fill a roll".
---
I had a 3 star laser weapon for a while but they are still so trash I used it briefly, got fed up of repairing it every 15 seconds and sold it to a vendor
---
This is already what is happening.
---
There was a mod in fallout 3 that did this. So one of the fallout 76 lockpick skins could have a more weathered look.
---
Careful, if you go implying repair kits weren't heavily requested,you'll get mobbed in here and people will throw links to 1 post and say things like " I've seen plenty" and "lots of posts" etc.The white knights come out in force.
---
You're prolly the ones who bought it at release and now angry about it. Dumb sheeps fomo buying unfinished games. Ahahaaha. I would buy it for 10 dollars maybe to try it. I heard they've fixed most of the bugs too.
---
Class freak also doesn't affect all mutations for whatever reason. Empath is a prime example :(
---
Ouch, sorry to hear.
---
Heyyy that's my mod! Yes it works.
---
I don't know if anyone mentioned that but healing factor is not for bloodied build, basically no positives and huge negatives
---
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass
---
was the bone raider excavator armor like that? I could have sworn I had to use a lot more than that. Although maybe I didn't find the paint option?
---
I actually think I already made a change to the mutations for the electrically charged mutation hit chance
---
we have to see how player vending machine will work.
---
also, keep in mind that in any multiplayer game, money has to be destroyed otherwise everything gets out of hand quickly.
---
Money is fallout76 is more like tokens: you can earn a limited amount everyday only.
---
Been lagging bad too at random times. Also fast travelled and it look so long to properly load I was within an inch of my life being attacked by high level scorched without being able to see them, attack them or heal myself :(
---
There is no recipe for psychotats. They are unable to be crafted
---
Well then maybe they should stick to the plan they promised to when they solicited money for said company in the form of pre orders.
---
301 - snk n rebel  
---
pretty high. just spotted in the wild
---
The problem isn't with herd mentality the problem is with hard bargain. That specific perk modifies your bargain charisma. Try the perk that changes your chr based upon how many teammates you have and see if sharing that perk does the same
---
really? I was of the thought that with having below 20% hp, your hp would heal quick and easy
---
I haven't even used laser weapons in this game which is sad because I enjoyed using them in Fallout 4.
---
Holy cow 500 words of essay for a game. It's just a game, mate. But no worries a gamer is a gamer, you will be back!! :D
---
It heals you out of combat, during combat you suffer from your stims being 50% weaker and all other chems basically useless
---
*Terrible
---
;)
---
No worries, hardly the end of the world, no matter what the internet will try to tell you.
---
I think fallout 76 is releasing a new faction based on you, the "pioneers"
---
I would prefer to scrap, so I can make other kinds.
---
I feel like my two shot has been doing less damage for a couple days now. I've been having some issues with stealth too so could also be the sneak attack duplicator not working.
---
No Watoga did not get a legendary nerf. No areas did. It's the same rate nk matter where you are and it's based on enemy level. 1% for 0-10 2% for 11-20 3% for 21-30 4% for 31-40 and 5% for 41+. These percentages are doubled if you are in a nuke zone. This is all based on rng and lately there's been a lot of bad rng going around
---
At level 120 ish and still using a non-legendary handmade that I crafted and modded. With full rifle perks and  bloody mess it averages around the mid 90s in damage. Most useful standard long arm weapon.. only drawback is the weight. Fortunately I have 2 weapons weight reduction armor legendary pieces. Very practical build. Leaves space for supplementary melee perks too. Enjoy !
---
I cringe every time I see some eager beaver announce, "I'd pay for that!!" These are the things that get added as a priority not fixing the damn bugs.
---
Melee explosive!
---
Profit is admirable, profiteering is abominable.
---
There was an mod that added a HD model in fallout 4.  It was amazing actually. One of those thing you never knew you wanted until you had it.
---
Your cynicism is so edgy and impactful.  Man you really burned us all expertly.
---
oh damn, sounds like shit
---
I've got quite a few but of the lot ot drops the least. I'm talking about the scribe outfit Taggerdy is wearing, not the field scribe by the way.
---
&gt;balanced for 2 players and is soloable.
---
ugh
---
Why should they fix energy weapons , I don’t use them....
---
this is why we aren't getting anymore flags.
---
I don't know if I'd call these turret towers griefing necessarily. Mostly just being shitty and selfish. Although they may be doing this with the intention of purposefully preventing other players getting rewards. Then this is griefing. Some people call some weird stuff around here griefing and don't know what that really means.
---
I'm interested why you'd defend these turrets doing what I said in my previous reply? I don't really see '*there's other places*' as a reason for people to do this when somebody has gone through the effort of launching a nuke on *this* spot. It's not a single player game any more. Prevent somebody else getting rewards? You might get your towers destroyed.
---
People have strong feelings because this has been an issue for a long time in this specific spot and It's been discussed to death. When else have you seen the destruction of a camp called for and upvoted? No. Other. Time. That's how strongly the majority agree. Calling it 'comical' is extremely belittling. These people may have just spent a lot of time, resources and effort launching a nuke.
---
Also I'd like to know where else on the map is as good or better for farming legendaries than the golf club in a nuke zone? You say it's just one "out of many". If there's just as good and quick farming spots I'd like to know for my own play.
---
I'm still sitting in a bath of cold water hoping the burns aren't too bad when I get out.
---
After latest patch on Xbox One I am unable to:
---
1. Use "phantom" stealth boy (animation is shown but nothing happens)
---
2. Apply some mods to legendary weapons (after accepting button nothing happens)
---
Sterling idea man. I’m in.
---
Thanks we did it, but was tedious, only the winner got the atoms, so we had to do it 4 times, definitely not worth it.
---
I've never seen or heard of this ever being an issue. Record video of it and send it in to Bethesda. You'll get more help that way.
---
Leave in suitcases at train stations. Gives a chance that someone will them and it will be useful. Rather than just dropping
---
You are a moron . If anything’s it’s pay to lose . Anyone else can do a 200% repair while repair kits max out at 150%(?)
---
Getting roasted like this like this almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Lag is absolutely obnoxious. And to top it off, I can't get through whitesprings without the game just freezing and crashing to desktop. It's just infuriating...
---
Should I tell him it’s impossible to scrap quest items or just let him leave?
---
Fallout 3 had you selling ammo at less than a cap per unit. Doesn't strike me as too hard for them to add this without breaking anything.
---
0.1 cap or even 0.01 cap for very common ammo types would still encourage us horders to sell ammo we don't use. Obviously less common ammo would be more etc. Not expecting 0.1 caps for a mini nuke. Lol.
---
Personally the player vending is where I'm hoping to see ammo selling. All My spare ammo will be going into that if it is.
---
Sounds like you are mad that you don't have any good gear. You got me I paid 5 caps for all my armour and gear. You haven't presented any evidence that any of that gear is unbalanced, all you've said is that you are too incompetent to obtain it through ingame means so you think the only way to obtain it is break the terms of service for the game.
---
All the gear you mentioned is counterable with perks and 1 star equipment. If you think ass sen users are unkillable that's very wrong and exposes your lack of knowledge about the game and your inability to strategise.
---
You're not getting many upvotes perhaps because some of the issues can be avoided with experience and knowledge of the game. But I completely understand your frustration. The game itself is the toughest enemy you will face. I have been killed by mobs, players, gravity, explosions and none of them caused one tenth as much anger and frustration as the clunky, bug-ridden, patched in then patched out  minute to minute game experience.
---
Yes I played it, a lot, but damn it the going has been tough sometimes and I have to say I'm left feeling a little...empty.
---
Yea you got me I will never recover from that financial setback
---
thats it bud just a low chance
---
Enclave Bunker - Military Wing. It's going to be a lot of world hopping, unfortunately.
---
Xbox? I just bought some I can point you to whom I bought them off
---
Only viable laser weapons are explosive ones with beam splitters. They are weird in that they dont show superior damage in pip boy but they outperform in dps a handmade with same legendary effects.
---
It’s it’s diablo in a fallout skin in a Skyrim world
---
As long as it's cosmetic, I have no problem. I'm against repair kits in general. I don't see any point in them, and I never once saw anyone ask for them. If they did, I'd just assume they're BGS employees lol. 
---
I do think as an idea they could of given some "I survived FO76" items, as a thanks, and them poking a joke at the bad launch state of the game. Something like that would go a long way. I dislike that Bethesda damage control doesn't acknowledge more the issues with the game and downplays them as little issues. 
---
Routine maintenance is an understatement. Especially with the latest patch and hotfix causing major problems across the board. This is the problem when business comes before product. A quality product sells itself.
---
That is a great build to have and i must admit , i thought it was cheating too since the guy couldnt be touched . My friends lost so many caps to him that night in a hopeless effort to figure out what was happening . Any tips on the type of weapons that are best against such a build ? Because the explosive handmade and melee did next to nothing to him .
---
Yeah Xbox but I don’t need them so badly, in case I really won’t be able to find them I’ll hit you up, thanks ;)
---
just killed it today, was dissapointed with the loot as there was nothing remarkable, how could it be like that when you kill an alien?
---
The money is not what you should be prepared to lose. Be prepared for a frustrating, uplifting, soul destroying, beautiful mess of a game that feels more like a job in dead end office at times.
---
Permanent CAMPS would also mean no server hopping. As it would just put you back to the server you left, because your CAMP is in there.
---
Personally I wouldn't mind that at all, but there has to be a way to change servers then. What if your 250-level character is stuck on server with 20 people under level 20.
---
How are you going to do SBQ or the new Sheepsquatch event.
---
It’s all to do with rounding that it goes down in weight, let’s say lead ways 1.97lb. The game will round this up to 2lb but if you bulked say 30 into bulk lead 1.97x30 is 59.1 which the game will display (and calculate carry weight) as 59lb thus making bulk lead way less than unbuckled lead. 
---
Long story short, it’s because while imperial measurement in general suck they especially fucking suck when it comes to weight less than a pound and so the game rounds in stupid ways.
---
They were. The Heavy buff appears to have done the charm for them, but energy weapons are still second tier. 
---
As an aside, I think there's a few other changes they need to make too, namely that rad damage on the rad rifle and Gamma Gun don't scale with any of the damage increasing effects.  Energy damage scales with ballistic damage on the Plasma Rifle. It should do the same on these that deal rads.
---
You should be careful with what you say. Bethesda could see this and ban you from Fallout 76 permanently
---
Ever heard of it it forward?
---
To fight someone you gotta understand them first. Cavalier works only when sprinting. When you sprint, you use your AP. My cavalier build had been optimised with this in mind and he can sprint for minute and a half. There are hence two main ways to kill him.
---
The univeral one, the great equalizer, the vats critshots to head. Those will eat them. The second method is to prevent them from using their AP to sprint by eating all of their AP. Cryolator drains AP of enemies hit.
---
Ok so there is an exploit using pacifist mode? Haven't encountered it hope they fix it
---
With 9 charisma and level 3 hard bargain I get 10 caps per bulked rubber.  I think the best you can ever really do is selling something for about an eighth of what you buy it for.
---
Wot?
---
&gt;  Leather coat, traveling leather coat
---
Where are these two supposed to drop from?
---
Nope, not bothered at all. I don't need to or bother with trading with other players, well not until player vending is actually here that is. I still find it strange that caps is our main currency, yes I know it's the iconic Fallout currency, but can you imagine carrying any amount of bottle caps, those things have sharp edges, and would weight a lot ( But thankfully don't in-game!).
---
Lol. Humor of the day.
---
Could care less what you think pal but keep it up if it makes you feel good.
---
You have to have the plans for the regular cooking stove in order to use the red-skinned one.
---
you need to have the normal stove unlocked first
---
I play fallout for all its aspects, while I like the pvp I like how all the other aspects combine together. I don't think the game is severely unblanced  but you definately can' t it in into a competive game because of the shitty server stability and the fact its an mmo.
---
Known plans not selling is the worst. It suddenly makes them worth nothing as a reward. Feels like a little slap.
---
I agree with you
---
Eh they definitely needed events ...
---
Some nice guns
---
Now this is the actual kind of constructive feedback I like to see! I like the idea for having it unlock after a certain amount of time say 5 minutes or so, basically after the set period it becomes considered abandoned and goes unclaimed making it free reign for anyone who stumbles by to pick up.
---
I just think they should do more stuff like this to make more use of the bounty system (in adventure mode). You STEAL from someone, you are a thief and should get a bounty. It has really only become frustrating with the new event and the forced damage of the pylons, most people refuse to do them and the ones who do shouldn't be punished for doing the mechanics.
---
BSG?  Galactica or Pacifica?
---
@xilooften#0779, sorry for late reply. i was a bit sick yesterday
---
You cheated therefore don’t ever play again.
---
Scum like you don’t deserve to be able to play this game and I hope Bethesda did something that caused you not to just get banned but also hardware banned.
---
Cheating cunt.
---
The repair over 100%are loot drop only too.  I like the idea of it personally.  I can use some of my earned atoms for a few, it isn't like this is a problem in need of fixing.  It is an annoyance that can be slightly mitigated.
---
They’re are a myth, like snallgasters, wendigos, and the graftin monster
---
I was saying this very thing the day they were announced when every one was in full on rage mode. 
---
BGS isn't testing the waters for P2W items. They are testing the waters for pay for convenience. They want to monetize mundane portions of the game where possible, to snag a few extra bucks from impatient/lazy gamers. 
---
I'm ok with that.
---
Who even cares. Repair kits aren't P2W. It's a convenience item. Very different thing. 
---
Monetizing aspects of the game that are mundane and have 0 impact on other players? I'm fine with that.
---
They will probably be needed mostly in the burrows, and similar lengthy dungeons. If that's the case, it will come down to whether or not there are repair benches in those places, and whether or not you can fast travel in and out without disrupting the quest/run.
---
They seam to be a mistical item /s
---
they are pay for convenience but if we allow it, in future they will add:
---
\- a pay for convenience refrigerator plan in atom shop
---
\- a pay for convenience junk deposit from every location
---
\- a pay for convenience ammo scrapping utensil in atom shop
---
\- a pay for convenience machine vendor plan in atom shop
---
\- pay for conenience more stash space...
---
should i continue?
---
Save yourself two tasks - collecting them and decrypting the code - use the posted code.
---
The short answer is that imperialism sucks and the game would make a lot more sense if it went metric as it’s base measurement. 
---
The longer answer is that the game code and computer logic are both metric while the game displays in imperial measurement. Thus the game developers kind of botched the mathematics so it could calculate in metric but display in imperial. 
---
By the way bulk screw do actually exist but players can’t make them because they serve no purpose and weigh more than unbulked screws.
---
Well, before this last patch, I would let the monsters near my camp kill me as soon as I'd hit the top 3, this way I'd not lose caps and I could easily retrieve my stuff.
---
I still died to players a bunch of times, but honestly, I find the survival mode very funny, even if I don't stand a chance against pretty much anyone.
---
Now that life lenght isn't anymore a clock that tells me when the next player will come to slaughter me, survival is a lot better. I still meet players and I still die, but maybe due to how safer it is now, I find a lot of people not interested in butching me.
---
I would trade with other players if there was a text chat to communicate exactly what i need to buy from them.
---
I for one agree with you but I think the main worry that the community has is “is this just the beginning”. They’re worried about where it will go next and Bethesda will add more stuff that is atom shop exclusive that will much more pay-to-win vibes e.g. new op Chems or weapons
---
I have a tse automatic laser rifle and I literally repair it after a single event lol if not half way through put it in the stash for that reason lol
---
I also like to add that one should not take ‘win’ too literal in ‘pay-to-win’.
---
You guys really want to continue splintering the servers that are already not that busy lol
---
pay to lose\* they don't over repair
---
Ummmm...
---
Because everyone’s opinion matters?
---
But if u like we can tell Bethesda not too listen too ur suggestions anymore. Seeing as u are just one in many players.
---
sweet
---
Still waiting for firecracker whiskey to be crafted
---
if you were led to the cabin with the pylons then you werent meant to get another quest
---
It's a 30% reduction off of the regular cost, which is based on how far you are from your destination.
---
They are trying to force scavenging or player trading. Issue with player trading is the 25k cap limit and no worthwhile cap sinks to make that a meaningful limit.
---
Haven't you just been loving the batches of new content? The parade....Brewing... Now the Sheepsquatch....
---
And now we got dungeons in a few days!
---
Aren't you excited? 
---
Oh yeah......sorry. you can't play them. 
---
I fucking love it. Cheaters missing content. Fucking love it.
---
Nope. I buy serums from a really reputable supplier.
---
Nope. I just finished investigating Sal's .....
---
The end of Baa Baa Black Sheep portion is at Sals Grinders, where you download the coordinates from Sals Terminal.  Is that what you mean, or have you completed Lying Lowe?  The end of Lying Lowe is at the pylon cabin.
---
Yeah, you know what it says? That the arms race is bloody and noone shares their aces. War, war never changes.
---
It's weird there's even a limit, they're stored on your PC not on a server, if they are stored on a server too for some reason then that should be changed and the photo count should be unlimited, much like steam screenshots.
---
Use Sals Terminal to download the coordinates.   It starts the next one to investigate the police officers or something to that effect.
---
hahaha made the same mistake myself my friend it says we need the plan
---
Craft and scrap them
---
I chuckled audibly
---
I want pay for convenience Teddy Bear shelves 🧸💖
---
I like this theory. But you know I’m just gonna Jackie Chan that shit and start using whatever weapons I find anywhere like I did in Breath of the Wild.
---
This is one of the dumbest arguments I’ve seen against these stupid transactions. I personally would rather not see them in the game, but it’s THEIR game and after the huge shit-show they suffered from back in November, I do not mind at all having Bethesda dangle keys in front of players in order to fund all this new content we’ve got coming in. 
---
Getting back to my counter argument, your cause for alarm is utilizing the system we’ve been shown for the repair kits, and using fear-mongering to get people up in arms about them. IE, “SiNcE u WaNnA sAy ThAt ItS pAy FoR cOnViEnEnCe, ThEn E V E R Y T H I N G wIlL bE tHaT wAy!!” However, when they were announced, Bethesda told players they’d be offering them two versions of the repair kits. One that’s free and is earned through completing in-game events, such as killing the SQB (which is the easiest shit unless you’re brain dead or just picked up the game yesterday and haven’t learned how to fight her). Plus another version, which can be bought for atoms, but isn’t as strong as the one offered to players who actually grind for it.  If we utilize your argument here, then wouldn’t Bethesda offer players who play the game a better version of all those (absolutely useless items imo) for players who play the game? I’m sorry, but I abhor this backlash because it sounds childish to me. Every fucking video game company asks you to pay more than 60 dollars for their game, grow up, stop whining about it, and be glad we’re not fucking paying for loot crates.  I’m sorry that you feel lied to, or maybe even terrified that one day, rich people will log onto Appalachia with the ability to store 900 lbs worth of shit in their stash and have mutfruit never decay. 
---
So when you ask if you should continue, I say no.
---
You come off as a frustrated 8 year old. 
---
I didn't pay attention and scrapped some stuff I didn't want to. Thanks Bethesda. 
---
I don't like that I have to turn on Pacifist mode. It should be on by default. How would I have known? It's not like there's a prompt at level 5. Thanks Bethesda. 
---
I probably did something that engaged PvP and got killed.....thanks Bethesda. 
---
I bought the game used, and in turn supported it's creators in no way shape or form and now I'm pissed... Thanks Bethesda.
---
If only they were as easily to find as those!
---
The best way to report these kinds of things is to use the official Bethesda site and log a feedback ticket.
---
I downloaded coordinates. Baa Baa Black sheep completed. Nothing happened after the quest completion screen.
---
I did that. It was part of Baa Baa Black sheep. I got the Baa Baa Black sheep completed splash. Just no new quest after it
---
Well it does, alt-tabbing sometimes changes the resolution of your game which you have to restart to fix it.
---
what if i say the ingame version of the repair kit will have a drop chance of 2%?
---
Try exiting the game and going back in.   It should give you next questline starting back in Lewisburg.
---
wow, my whole argument, debunked.
---
You should still be able to sell vegetables. Maybe your razorgrain and corn spoilt before you reached the vendor? Happens to me all the time.
---
Definitely not. Every other online game I play works flawlessly
---
You wouldn’t even know what happened to Old man Mose until it was too late!
---
You got dropkicked off the server.
---
In your Pip-boy under data, main: what is the last completed quest?
---
I lost all my pics late december or early jan after some update. Had a shit ton of them from launch week with my roommate. More pissed about that than any server crash or other fuckery lol
---
Enclave Bunker, very rare..., I did server hopping for hours to get it
---
Yay!
---
Ok I just found them but I cannot apply the mod. I mean I equip it on my armor but nothing happens. Bug or I am missing something?
---
The issue with that, If no one has money, no one can buy my stuff...  
---
My Lvl 51 Toon has ~7k caps right now.  I have a hard time finding enough stuff to sell to the Vendors to make the Max 1400 caps per 20 hours.  
---
I cringe when I look at the Power Armor Mod Prices, let alone the Serum Prices...
---
This is how you get temporary companions in game.
---
its still not cosmetic if they go back on this its just the start
---
On a similar note, Rose's Station has potential to be fantastic, since it's the only one with a host..
---
And it doesn't play any music?!
---
But fusion cores counts as ammo, and idk bout you guys, but I’ve held Poseidon, Mononga &amp; Thunder mountain at the same time, and after a bit you have TONS of fusion cores. 
---
That would make it too easy to earn caps. But if you could sell them to other players though, that might not be broken.
---
Nothing complicated.  Just a maxed out charisma build that's all.
---
Mods are broken as of last patch. Armor, weapons both don't apply to whatever you're modifying. Keep 'em at the ready for when 4th his gets fixed
---
Why the fuck did you put quotes around 'the'.
---
No.  Just scrap lowest level you can craft to save materials.
---
I Have a bloodied fire rate laser and I can get up to around 230 damage with low hp.
---
Because an interior wall has 2 sides. The barn set has the exposed wood ribs on the other side so it won't work well for what in looking for.
---
I'll be sure to do that thanks
---
I have most of them, can mod/craft for you, on PC if you need something specific
---
Some vendors carry attachable mods, but insane unreliable way to get a specific MOD for a specific weapon. Craft and scrap.
---
Again thank you and after hearing what happened in your game I'll most definitely do everything I can to remeber it
---
All the time. I keep spawning in the ground UNDER white spring golf club. I watch the whole building spawn on to of me while I'm buried alive.  Next time I'm gong to take a video because it's terrifying. I can only leave server.  Ps4. Since hotfix.
---
&gt;(that way we can report error, check what some challenge means (like : kill raven gouls in bombed area (translated from french to english).... what is a bombed area ? a nuked one ? that way there is no "raven gouls", on ly "glowing gouls"...so we, french, don't understand this one :))
---
In English this was “kill feral ghouls in a Nuke zone”.  I didn’t do it, but did not know if Feral Ghouls would even spawn inside a Nuked area or if they all changed to Glowing Ones.
---
Not only does this seen helpful to get stuff early on, but knowing where I can place stuff for others when I'm more progressed is very helpful. Thanks!
---
"As we look to the future, we’re exploring ways we can bring other community-driven ideas to the game as well, such as refrigerators for C.A.M.P.s, ammo and food converters, and even the ability to send scrap to your stash without having to head home"
---
Seems ammo conversion is always on it's way. Can't wait for it.
---
Dont be rude boys, us fallout fans are new to your world lol. i save before leaving the first vault ALWAYS and i was at a loss too
---
Apparently it’s to discourage trading with vendors and encourage trading with players, but that’s not a good enough excuse for how it works right now. Selling prices need to at LEAST be doubled. Selling for 1400 caps a day is a pain in the arse, and buying anything from a vendor is even worse. Good luck getting all those blueprints from watoga and the serum recipes without spending all day selling on your 50 different characters for weeks at a time.
---
&gt;shout out to the crap RNG of an end game
---
I understand *some* of your frustration (although I'm not a fan of too much hand-holding in a survival RPG, it is supposed to be hard), but if you rage-quit at level 11 you are not entitled to criticize this game's endgame mechanics. Just my 2 cents.
---
I’m assuming he means permanent camps in the way that you still hop servers, but to increase competition for land that can also allow two nearby camps not cancelling the other out for having the build radius a pinch inside the other’s
---
Never helped on a will before, is there a coordinator or something?  Idk where to start and would like some direction.
---
fought it 3 times since BETA, not won even once, only dissapointing waste of resources.
---
Thanks for informing me of how out of date the wiki is I'll be doing as much as I can to improve the wiki so I can help my fellow dwellers.
---
Oh damn that's pretty nice.
---
I love that plans cannot be sold.    It has saved me much pointless time grinding and/or caps.
---
One of the reasons I no longer play, haha
---
Ok thanks
---
I was the conduit for two pylons last night. It was my mates first time doing the event, so he was the third Pylon while I tanked multiple super stims. I concentrated gunning down the adds with my 50 cal, while he got all up in the bosses grill. Once the adds were cleared, I'd focus fire.
---
It's amazing how smooth the event can go when you rig the scenario so that all the randoms only focusing the boss is actually exactly what you need.
---
I think you all misread OP's question. They were not asking where to find TD, but if there's a way to make the rare paint plans drop more often. I don't have an answer for that, and I'm in the same situation: I only ever got the BOS Initiate paint plan, and no other plans for a lot more than 100 drops since that.
---
Feels to me like I'm bugged out of the paint plans loop because I got the Initiate paint before the game was updated with the better ones. Maybe an in-game counter got flagged to MAX as that was the maximum available at the time?
---
I can help with some of those questions but not all. The keycard component you need to craft the recall key card can be purchased from vendors for just over 1700 caps with hard bargain 3, grape mentats and sweet roll, you mentioned 18000 caps so I didn’t know if the extra 0 was a typing error or if another player had tried to sell you a key card for 18000. The Sheepsquatch is real, a Reddit found a bloatfly that had Sheepsquatch meat in its loot table and unlocked a Sheepsquatch meat recipient in the cooking workbench menu. Bethesda also said in their ITV The were happy we were enjoying the quest “so far” so that means there’s more to come, the Wild  Appalachia trailer showed a dressed up dweller meaning the real Sheepsquatch although all you see is his mouth and jaw move when he goes nose to nose with the dweller. Hopefully someone can tell you what to do about the quest not completing but the Sheepsquatch is an event and is on a 3hr timer so to do that bit you could just server hop till you find an active one.
---
Interesting i remember that i saw people asking for repair kits so much, it was on hot and some comments in which people asked for them to be atleast on atomic shop. This was way before repair kits announcation.
---
Maybe i am on reddit too much and i have halucinations.
---
During the Monster Mash event, I took the mask but the quest marker still said I had to grab the mask. So I'm guessing servers were bit off and didn't know what to do.
---
Don't give me an excuse to take more screenshots!
---
It’s just super irrelevant to what he is proposing
---
This. Or why nerfing TSE when actualy only few people cried that they were killed with OP weapons.
---
Not mind sorry
---
To be totally fair - I've definitely seen posts where people mention convenience items and how they'd be fine with paying for them on the atom shop. It doesn't necessarily represent any kind of a majority point of view or anything, I just definitely remember seeing them.
---
I see 5 posts a day min. Asking about buying the game . It was slow out the gate but she’s picking up steam now
---
For me, the perk menu seems to be where my game says “nah dude”.
---
I heard that in TSE:blades (new bethesda mobile game) you get crates. They open in some time, or you can pay $ to open them. On start that is ok, but eventualy you get to point where you dont get more gold than you spend on repairs, so you have to pay for opening those chests. This can be very ugly Pay to play mechanic.
---
To make you mad and here we go!
---
And don't forget Super Duper. Saves a bunch of screws when it triggers. And craft the lowest level gun
---
I’d be less annoyed about repair kits if they didn’t do Item Degredation nerfs to integrity after use and the respective perk cards.
---
If they’re going to implement cheap conveniences like repair kits and refrigerators, just don’t nerf the rate at which items degrade because it pushes an agenda that hurts the community’s trust and tolerance.
---
Enough people even without nerfs would still pay for these conveniences to skip what can sometimes be a tedious or unaffordable task, like the wallet warriors and the people on the hate wagon just for the sake of it? Could I be wrong?
---
I agree the 25K cap sucks . But I'm affraid increasing the cap from 25K will cause a big amounts of inflation. I Think this cap artificially keeps the inflation down because of the multiple account switch hassel while trading.
---
Those robots all have one prime directive; MAXIMIZE PROFITS.
---
&gt;If I have an Legendary in my Inventory that has a value of ~100 caps, it is bought for ~4 caps...
---
And the vendor put it out for sale at 400.
---
It's completely fucked. I don't see how ANYONE has been able to save up 10,000 caps for the signs and letters plan.
---
It also depends on what Silo you’re in from what I’ve noticed, difficulty rising order of Alpha, Bravo and Charlie
---
What a waste of atoms.
---
There is a static drop in the mire. Just pick one up every few hours and scrap them for mods.
---
Source for this information? I run Silos every day and I've never seen a difference in difficulty
---
you barely used anything lmao
---
No source, just experience, I did a run through Alpha and mostly encountered level 32s - 44s with with the odd level 56 here and there but a previous Charlie run was mostly level 48-56
---
I once saw a level 460 player farming ghouls at whitesprings - definitely a 24/7 fallout 76 player. I guess he was aiming to reach level 500
---
My only problem with game's economy is that dirt under my fingernails is more valuable than caps these days.
---
Every person who played the same account definitely used the infinity experience glitch, where you can disarm a trap forever and get experience each time. Each player must have sat there and did the infinity experience glitch the whole time
---
Berkeley Springs has a spawn spot for a handmade.
---
Maybe your intelligence perks were low or you didn't go to places to farm good xp
---
Have you check the vendor in Camden Park?
---
I've been playing for around 8 months and am level 137 - I always farm the whitesprings for legendary gear and xp and farm lead and steel for ammo at the top of the world
---
You are correct, sir. People just love to overthink things and they love drama.
---
Good to know.  Will have to check that out
---
Level 941?! holy crap that guy must've sat there doing the infinity xp glitch for months cause if you don't use the glitch to level up it would take years to reach level 941 (or thousands of server hops to farm whitespring ghouls). Highest guy I've seen was about level 470
---
When I run through a Silo I usually encounter Lv22 Gutsys but occasionally I'll encounter higher levels (usually when somebody has already been through the Silo, you can tell because there are destroyed turrets etc) So from what I can tell, the enemies scale based on either the number of players running the silo OR the Silo spawns higher level enemies the longer you spend tackling the Silo. I could be wrong though. I've ran silos at least 100 times and I'm still not 100% sure why they spawn higher level enemies at times. I may log on and do some testing cause now you've got me wondering
---
Level 2000 players must have used half their life to reach a level to that extent. Also, how do you know there are some level 2000 players?
---
Come on, they promised to only include cosmetic items in Atomic Shop, repair kits is NON-COSMETIC.
---
Hooray for golf outfits and golf skirt.  Pop a grape mentat and and hard bargain 3 perk and they net you 27 caps each.  Just yesterday I picked up the 1400 cap limit on those two items alone.
---
Spotted and killed one in The Mire. I don't think he's a Zetan tho. If he lands face down when he dies, you can see tiny legs pretty far up on his body. The lower half of his body is mechanical.
---
I wouldn't rely on this idea, could lose a lot of stuff. Also, it'd be cheaper to put stuff in containers.
---
By quest items he’s probably referring to the unique outfits you get rewarded early in the game , like responder jumpsuit or whatever , if not it’s just another bait post.
---
I had considered setting up an artillery piece nearby and going in there with a fat man and artillery smokes for giggles.
---
🤔 You've given me much to consider.. You're a bad influence hahaha
---
I bought marsupial mutation, stealth boy, and jet pack for nearly 5K apiece.  I’m right now at 18K caps.  It’s not that hard to build up caps.  I just wish more players would trade.
---
Maxed out Charisma and some Luck
---
I probably have 50 fusion cores in my stash and at any time have 6-10 on me and I never run out.  They are all over the place if you know where to find them.  Hell yes I wish you could sell or junk them.  They are an absolute bitch to craft which is hilarious.
---
Oh I'm in no way pressing my luck and acting like this is in any way reliable. Just had to give it a shot when the opportunity was presented to me. Glad it worked out though.
---
Now that you mention it, I should've just placed in then in a container... Oh well, only cost me a few hundred caps.
---
I remember in the beginning Preston gave me a sidequest, hopped in one of my suits of power armor and didn't get out until they patched it.
---
Screen freeze every 30 seconds last1-3 seconds the game is unplayable right now for me
---
It's a skin not plans. Also I believe you can find the cooking stove plans at WS shops
---
This is what is happening to me
---
How are you getting caps?
---
I have a modded instigating anti armor pipe weapon.  With all the trimmings and tank killer it’s a very underrated piece.  But you are right it’s the only thing .38 - well not the only thing - but pretty much.
---
I just checked and my flathead screwdriver is actually red.  But it's red and black, so yeah some variety in the little things would be pretty cool.  It can't be THAT hard to implement and I'm sure it would make them something in the long run.
---
If that &gt;!impostor sheepsquatch!&lt; event is any indication, we're gonna need to do a lot of repairing in these dungeons.  That, or everyone's going to need to bring multiple sets of gear with them.
---
I don't know why anyone would play long enough to reach level 200-400. I mean, Fallout 76 is pretty addictive and you can play for hours and hours power levelling your character, but level 200-400 is way too much because the game becomes too easy and you just visit the same locations you've been to hundreds of times and collect the same loot you've collected hundreds if not thousands of times - I don't find any fun in that. 
---
If I reached level 200 with my character with a fully maxed out build, I would start a new character and focus on another build - for example, my primary character is level 137 doing a stealth command build, and I've almost finished doing the build when I realised that it would be much more efficient to farm whitespring ghouls with a one handed melee build with no power armor to not have to scavenge for ammo al the time. The fun in this is, one, levelling up a new character is fun because it's challenging, and two, characters with different builds are better for different situations, like a one handed melee build with no power armor is probably most suitable for farming whitespring ghouls and other trash mobs that give heaps of xp and legendary gear while the stealth commando build is probably better for killing scorchbeasts and stronger mobs
---
I did not know you could sell bulked items...thank you SO much.
---
Better than launch, worse than before the last patch. Overall it's vastly improved but they do have a habit of fucking up updates.
---
I've been playing almost 12 hours a day since the first day of beta. I am disabled and stay at home with my new born so I have a lot of time. I stream on twitch and im actually going through right now to segment out clips of me completing quests. Would you be interested in me including videos to the wiki? I would love to contribute I just need some direction and motivation because usually im just playing the game. I do know a whole hell of a lot about it though.
---
was on a server for six hours and it didn't reset! wouldn't let me use my recall card
---
I was just wondering this. Wrecking ball only says Workshops. Does it work on camps too?
---
Alternatively, you could help the [non-Wikia Fallout wiki](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/The_Vault_Fallout_Wiki) since Wikia/Fandom is a scummy corporation who doesn't give a shit about their users and only cares about ads and money.
---
Not everyone that plays the game uses reddit to talk about it, that makes the reddit community the minority a lot of the time, so Bethesda should never listen to the reddit community?
---
Oh definately some people wouldnt mind, but that also reflects that theres a lot of people who would legit pay to win too, some people are willing to pay for anything
---
That's some really good idea, and what about if when you become a super mutant you can have a pet/companion centaur ? (Like in fo3 they were usually around super mutant if i'm correct ?)
---
I’m shocked how many people have played so long have never seen this creature. I see him quite often. Hell one time I travelled to cranberry bog where I got ganged up on by a scorchbeast and a flatwoods monster working together. 
---
Didn’t end well for me.
---
I played fallouts 3,NV,4 for essentially one thing:  wandering around burned out houses and collecting tin cans.  Fallout 76 does this wonderfully, and in a very pretty setting I'm familiar with. 
---
I also loved the DS games because all of the stories and lore were told on the descriptions of leather pants.  Fallout 76 adopts this tend nicely, but opts for scraps of paper and tape decks.
---
The players you run into are too friendly. They all want to fully equip you fresh out of the vault, and then I feel guilty about using all the items I've been gifted without having earned them on my own.
---
The spacesuit is a literal gold mine
---
Whether or not the dungeon includes workstations will be interesting, a canary in the mine so to speak. Given the current closest equivalent, the nuclear silos, I'd be surprised if there weren't any though.
---
You know you don't have to reach 1400 caps every single day right... I would try to get every cap from a vendor when they only had 200 each but now i find myself selling stuff i don't even want to get all 1400 and it's busy not worth it sometimes.  Wait until you actually have things to sell.
---
There have been a few xp cheats since launch mate and people have taken advantage. I stoped playing 2 months ago and highest I saw at that time was level 1600ish but people report even higher levels.
---
It is NOT obtained via legit normal gameplay.
---
I'd pay for majority of what you listed, when things like this are added to a game they aren't added for people like you. I have a wife and 3 kids so my time gaming is limited. If I can throw a few bucks to making my playing times QoL better, then I will.  Also I'd pretty much throw my wallet at a respec machine plan as well.
---
OP did have a post removed for rule 6. I doubt this is "click bait" just check OP's history
---
I specifically use red dot because of the wikis being absolute garbage, the only place I could find good info was here on the reddit and that was only like 70% of the time.
---
I’d noticed this on my lvl 45 TSE handmade. It shouldn’t take 2/3 shots to kill a lvl 6 scorched.  
---
Was much better last week, was it’s damage reduced recently?
---
You keep saying "steel and lead", I just want to confirm to you that steel does not drop in weight when bulked, it's aluminum you're thinking of.
---
&gt;  Oh well, only cost me a few hundred caps.
---
I once lost a lot of low level gear doing this I was meant to join a friends server and his power went out I server hopped for ages but nothing. I did pick up a 3 Star bloodied axe though so it was a ok time
---
Couldn’t be bothered with Queen fights anymore.    
---
I prefer to do nice, uninterrupted Whitesprings runs, while the entire server is waisting ammo &amp; stimpacks in exchange for another * zealot or mutant slayer right leg armor.
---
I’ve never really paired up with anyone intentionally but I can assist if need be
---
Psn is Mrseanwardmrsean
---
Or because some people might not realize that bulked items go into your inventory, so the stash will drop in weight significantly, until you put the bulked items backs in.
---
Arent there already 2 wikis? Im a huge fan of documentation, but having it all in one place is important.
---
Do you remember the 5th of September?
---
Massive agreed
---
He answered about it, he did a glitch that could get him high enough Intelligence so any mob he killed gave him thousands of exp.
---
So I generally just play a game and don't bother with exploits.  I can also understand how using exploits to dupe item can wreck the economy.  I've never been banned for anything.
---
However:
---
These kids likely paid full price for a game that they cannot play.  I don't remember agreeing to a TOS when I logged on.  If I did, the TOS wouldn't have a mind reader clause of "don't do anything we didn't intend, and if you don't know what we intend, make sure you guess well enough".
---
I know that this kind of thing is par for the course in games now, but the entire idea seems insane to me, especially for a game that can barely be considered competitive.  It just irritates me as a consumer that companies can unilaterally break something you have purchased.
---
Let he who has no sin cast the first downvote.
---
Often for me, on PS4, when this happens I just exit the trade screen and go right back in and it’s fixed.
---
No, it's simply because lead and aluminum get a weight reduction when bulked.
---
I am no longer allowed to use grenades because I killed myself so many times in west Tec.  I was a mid lvl, probably 80, running west Tec alone for shits and grins with really bad weapons.  I died at least 10 times in about 20 minutes  I learned a lot about myself as a player that day.
---
Clearly you two aren’t meant for each other.
---
Dying from radiation from collecting water and not paying attention to my health
---
She doesn’t get it.
---
I drowned in air.
---
Yep recently did the event it was well....great actually fantastic even and fun as hell but that’s the thing the events are inconsistent some times they work out great other times you get lag or freezes or worst disconnects they could bandaid this a lil bit by haveing rejoin previous server but that’s just a bandaid it’s internal problem the engine itself I believe don’t know how they can fully fix it
---
&gt; on the contrary screw and radioactive materials are very rare and don’t need to be bulked.
---
Speak for yourself, I'm currently sitting on ~400 of each
---
What did you say???
---
Yeah I did that once
---
1) Tossed out a pulse mine and then tried to shoot a target in VATS. VATS targetted the mine and I pulled the trigger too quick, blew myself up.
---
2) Sprinting at night, accidentally ran off a cliff.
---
Jumping off a cliff heading to watoga forgetting I hadn't got my power armor on.
---
Firing my tse lever action ( pre nerf) point blank into a robot at a silo and instantly killing myself, then having to walk a he'll of a way because I was over encumbered lol
---
What’s worse is that they have weight too
---
Nothing yet, haven’t spoken to her since the ‘ultimatum’. Currently not at home as I’m dog sitting.
---
Who cares, it's still fun.  It's a Fucking game with glitches. I still love killing ghouls.
---
I agree, I hop, and do Watoga every night and I slay everything for steel/alum/lead. No legendaries anywhere. 
---
It's been nerfed everyday same thing, patch goes through and no legendaries. Something is fucky.
---
Spare something for me 🤣
---
Top of the world is a good grind spot, take the weapons from the mods and sell em, black water mine is good too, Welch, and there is another place next to a train station but I can’t remember what it’s called
---
Haha it all makes sense now
---
Update: Tried reinstalling and making a new character, neither worked, i have never installed mods for fo76.
---
Oh I've got all the gear, I got mine without spending $$$s though. I own a set, and it's completely unfair. I'm actually laughing at you thinking you know all the shit when you don't, hell you probably don't even own a suit. I don't PvP anymore because it's unfair on other people. And I would love you to kill me with a 1* weapon. Thanks for the laugh. Another person who thinks they're the shit

Bethesda said cosmetic only.   This isn't that.   Yes it is somewhat innocuous as far as things being added to the Atomic Shop.   If this was the first and only thing added I would have no problem with it.   We all know this also isn't the case.    Next month it will be something else, something that will just push the boundary for what is acceptable just a little bit more.    You can see the pattern here.   Before you know it the cosmetic only Atomic Shop is just a memory.    Now the things that should have been in the game from the beginning for free start showing up with price tags.   That is the state of today's gaming industry, customers being squeezed for more and more money.
---
Now I do enjoy this game even with all of its problems.   The bugs that have yet to be fixed.   The bugs that get fixed to only be put back in the game.    The server instability.    The events that you cannot complete because of those servers.   Quality of life improvements still missing five months later.   I have put up with all of this.    Now they are trying to leverage themselves into a position for more revenue by breaking their cosmetic only promise.
---
No.   I say no.     I really would be a lot more open to this sort of thing happening if the game worked as well as it should if I were to be completely honest.      It doesn't so I'm not.
---
The only thing that would be pay to win is something that would buff your damage, health, rad resistance etc. Or paying for the best weapons and armor.
---
I'd personally love it if the whitesprings robots would just destroy any camps built on the grounds.  Their purpose is to maintain it, and I'm pretty sure they know a three story ramshackle structure made of plywood and sheet metal isn't part of the property grounds.
---
Is the chat volume up?
---
Recently for me its almost always set all the way off when i login. Its really annoying
---
I saw that line in the ITV and thought the same exact thing. I've been on this subbreddit daily, since launch, and couldn't remember ever seeing that. I realize that Reddit is not the end all to be all (though some would believe it so), but there were definitely a whole slew of monetizable requests that they could have put in where I would have been like, "yup, saw that one coming." Unless   that's what they were getting from the "heavy/energy weapons breaking too quickly" rant posts, I just don't know.
---
If i discovered something myself, like a spawn location for cooking oil, what should I post as proof?
---
No, what did you say in game that flipped her out? Must have been something bad for such a radical ultimatum.
---
 I got my last team mate grounded for life because she didn't like him flirting with me.  I'm a married middle aged women with a mouth like a sailor who lives thousands of miles away, insecure much?  I won't say I'm innocent but fuck that, I like making Dick jokes.  Mostly i play high so my mom filter is turned off.
---
That was a bug on release, and because they don’t know how to patch bugs, they brought it back in the last one.
---
Chat volume is at max.
---
I haven't noticed that issue before, my bad! Either way, I'd prefer Bethesda to focus on fixing bugs like this than adding spotify integration
---
Try setting it to area then idk what else if that doesnt work
---
Alright then Mr expert, create a brand new game engine with that feature. I'm waiting
---
I don't know, but I have this problem with certain players only so it's not me it's them, Dammit.  We end up on area, which sucks because then everyone had to listen to me go on non-stop about the virtues of my new laundered dress...
---
Then maybe just don’t have your mic on whilst she is there? I only tend to connect mine when I specifically want/need to talk to someone and talk to my g/f whilst playing. She’s actually really gotten into fallout lore now and bought me a vault-tec hoodie. 
---
I wonder if she’ll wear a nuke girl costume for me??
---
They know what you did.
---
Honestly this game needs some challenging things . It’s ridiculously easy 97% of the time . The new event is a start
---
No, it’s not that. She doesn’t like gaming anyway, but tolerates it. But apparently playing and talking to others is a step too far. My 15 y/o does it too and it drives her up the wall, mostly because of the noise, so for me to do it is too much.
---
I have waaay too much money in this game, around 150k now on 2 accounts with all housing plans unlocked. My problem is that i hate sitting on reddit and trading discords for items i want, so my caps just rot away. 
---
And the power armor mods and serums is sold very cheap by other players. Some even give them for free, if you bring the mats.
---
Platform?
---
Yeah I usually don’t play when she’s around but my step daughter apparently tatted me out. Anyway, this post was meant light heartedly, it’s not a biggie.
---
When you're a casual player, some of the prices these people are talking are ridiculous.
---
I get all my better gear and weapons from stuff people drop at vendors, because I hate farming, and I don't want to buy things off people charging stupid prices. Still have 13,000 caps.
---
Seriously, gamepedia is vastly better than wikia.
---
I’m angry that you CANT mod ammo.
---
Buy her some nice noise cancelling headphones?  Move the console to another room?  One of my kids is a screamer while gaming, so I get the frustration,  really.  
---
Just don't start whispering on mike. I played with this guy who was whispering so his wife wouldn't hear and it was creepy as fuck.
---
There was a mod in fallout 4 that gave it attachments, it was great
---
I know you can bulk gears, why couldn’t you bulk screws? I go through screws pretty quickly though, so haven’t had the need.
---
Binge drinking nuka cola often?
---
Joining a friend's server is slighlty more reliable but still risky. Better still get a friend to trade.
---
Indeed, he didn't look like one of those Zetans I recall. Hopefully, Bethesda comes up with a new alien senario in future DLC, revealing what they really are.
---
Thank so much
---
There comes a point where breaking down guns isn't worth it anymore so I sell them. Would recommend the luck perk cards for searching more meds/ammo upon search. I make a fair bit off that.
---
Mothman egg omlettes sell for a lot.
---
Put the perk on for double flora and then hit the farms and sell all the food. My level 8 flatmate just made 102 caps off corn lol, which seems small, but it was more caps than he currently had.
---
Before I log out I bulk and sell junk too to keep the stash tidy.
---
Ay, i could do that.
---
Still not working :/
---
There's a fine line between challenging and frustrating. Having to spam stimpacks because the lasers never end is frustrating. As a Level 130 something I get what you're saying but the lasers are just a pain in the ass
---
If it’s a revolver or pistol shouldn’t it include range?
---
Damn, that’s tough. My wife’s only complaint is if I talk too loud while she’s trying to sleep. I sometimes play with a large group of people, and it can get pretty raucous with multiple trades and conversations in party chat. Maybe you could turn up the tv a bit and let her listen in, so she gets why the mic is important. Or maybe you could try to get her to play a little so she becomes less anti-gaming. Good luck!
---
True, they are easy to acquire which would mean probs nobody would wanna buy them. But I feel like selling them to vendors are to broken, as they can’t say no.
---
Yes the lagging is ridiculous after the latest squatch update. Also really bad is the colorization fluctuations in the ground cover. The glowing aura on the surface that can make it tough to see and changes randomly for zero reason.
---
What kind of armor are you wearing? Maybe spec for more energy resists if you are having trouble?
---
Just keep waiting Mr fan boy and remember to down vote all comments which bring the truth out.
---
&gt;  Help other people and if you don't know the mechanics then either watch what others are doing, read the events hints, google the mechanics, search this sub for tips, or just don't show up. There will be cries saying this event isn't hard. You are correct. It is not but you will fail if you don't do what is required. 
---
This ! Did it today with a mate and we were the only 2 doing the pylons ... I agree how fucking hard is it to read the onscreen prompts to "Activate a pylon" and the glaring quest text with peoples names next to a pylon ... I did have a laugh though cause my mate who's a normally really calm person was a tad ragey about it .
---
You're probably mouth breathing over area chat and wants to stop playing with a mic as a courtesy to other people.
---
Yes it works on camps too. I make a point to melt WS golf club turret camps
---
What system you on? I’m sure someone would sell you the plan dirt cheap. If you’re on PS4 I might have the plan to give you for free
---
do you know how to get it
---
Anyone know why I can't see it in the Atom shop? Thanks
---
It's not so much the damage as it is the game mechanic that's frustrating. Apologies, I should have clarified
---
The "truth" is your opinion you selfish fuck
---
Plot twist: the first thing you see in your room waking up in 76, is a commie star on the wall!
---
Was having a intense battle In survival and after 5 or so minutes I blew my self up w a TSE handmade
---
Was in the nuke silo, threw down a pulse mine for the sentry bot and got stuck while trying to retreat on a robot corpse I’d just killed blowing myself up, fell in a fissure site while doing the brotherhood quest in the glassed cavern, fell in the deeper water in black water mine, couldn’t get out or fast travel out in time and drowned lol, I’m clumsy in real life too 😂
---
Turn the mic off for a month and just narrate everything you are doing in game to her instead.
---
Wait, you're not joking?
---
Dude, run.
---
Fast.
---
Thanks. I think she just wants me to spend more time with her.. we have 3 kids, 2 dogs and both work full time. Gaming is my escape. She, on the other hand, needs to be entertained.
---
Sorry man, missed it
---
Glol!
---
This fix should be the top post!
---
I buy most of mine on market subs..a lot of my friends have super duper so they also craft for me..and I almost have that card maxed too..but if u ask on market subs u will find great deals..cuz ppl just wanna get rid of it to drop weight
---
wtf
---
That’s a spawn point? Didn’t know about that one. Is there a list of these?
---
Different rig but same problems here
---
Ya, good place to farm
---
He's not being petty. Those bots are total crap. It's ridiculous how specific you have to be
---
Yea i want it too, but now with the new vendor cap pool it's not that necessary imo.
---
Or you waste ammo and aid only to get nothing from the queen.  I really hate that.
---
I feel like server stability died with this newest patch. I disconnect at least twice a day now. It really sucks because a couple months ago when it was like this I avoided launching nukes because it was literally pointless since i'd probably get dc'd. Now I'm in the same boat.   
---
I have 31 nuclear keycards I literally collected from chance encounters and will probably always have around 31 since the server stability seems to be an on going issue.
---
Hate when she does that, like she has to go get kids from school rq
---
It is the safe near the 2nd Harper's Ferry bridge.  People have been asking about this safe since release, and no one has ever found out how to open it.
---
The general consensus is that they forgot to add that part into game, or removed it by accident.
---
They don’t pay the playtesters anymore. They gotta make that profit, you know. After each patch Todd lets Todd Jr play for 20 minutes, and if he says its straight, brother it is straight.
---
Why would they add stuff to the atom store that we actually want?
---
It's just outside the graveyard just about due South of the church. There are a few graves with junk for headstones. Fever Blossom is right at the foot of a grave marked with a yellow owl mounted on a short post.
---
I farm there regular, always see the same (known) plans there. I presume someone has made a list somewhere.
---
How many endangerol shots are enough? I just kept pumping them in to be safe but I wonder how many are actually needed
---
I usually hit up the rail car near watoga station, but didn’t know about this one. Thx
---
Oh wait, you can't do this? I was expecting you to be able to leave them on the racks like in F4... Why play this when F4 exists, idgi
---
If you enjoyed fallout 3 and 4 you're going to like this.
---
Hm, interesting. I figured the Overseer's quest was impossible to complete because they were going to add more to it in the future. But, maybe it was a bug that they finally fixed.
---
Drop your own nuke where the flora is, that's what I do
---
you're a terrible friend
---
Calm down man there is no need to get angry :D. Maybe one day you will surrender your huge ego and learn something.I'm definitely not "the shit", I just consider myself a high tier PvP player. I take back what I said and apologise, you may have the gear but you don't know much about it and are making excuses for your inability to strategise learn and think outside the box. Let me know when you are ready to surrender you ego and learn something about game mechanics  :)
---
It seems like the latest patch caused a lot of stuttering. I personally haven't experienced any, but I have seen some other people complaining about it.
---
Check the glass cases in the buildings with the holes at the bottom as well.
---
I just googled the quests and ended up going to the different locations myself 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Congrats dude
---
I found one once by going to the extreme north of the map in the Savage divide just to see how far the map went, he was chilling at the border for some reason, lol.
---
This is a good idea! It would actually encourage people to help in the event rather than hiding in the cabin just to get the loot.
---
Did I kill you today? Is that why you are being so hostile? Can't remember you tbh.
---
Ty 😊
---
What game economy?   
---
There isn't one. So long as you can server hop you can pretty much get whatever you want when you want it isn't hard at all.
---
Agreed.   I’ve been trying to get that achievement for weeks on Xbox only to either it disconnect or the others hitting it stop and simply farm the scorched adds instead.  Tons of ammo down the tubes and no luck.  Event the drops from the adds were worthless too.
---
Do you play on PC?
---
Commenting so I can also find keg plans, or someone to put one in my camp for me
---
I feel you one this one man. Lol. My old lady is the same way. I have to wait till she goes to bed before i can play anymore. Now she complains i dont go to bed with her at the same time. I told her its either i play during the day for a couple hours and go to bed with her, or i stay up and game. shes not a gamer, she'll never understand
---
No, this sounds like the perfect time to end this relationship. Ultimatums are relationship killers. Even if he decides to just stop talking on the mic, there'll just be another ultimatum down the road. It's time to call it quits.
---
lol just stop hording junk
---
Yeah in the same boat with the bed times now..
---
I think i got a T-45 Jetpack plan from the event.
---
Mine hang every half an hour or so.
---
I was helping a few of my friends launch a nuke and didn't realize there was a lot of radiation in the reactor room (it was my first time). I ran straight for it while not in power armor and died from radiation. Then, everytime I would try to go back into the silo, my game would crash and at one point it even turned off my console entirely.
---
It's explosive and nocturnal. Not the greatest combo but worth playing around with.
---
Tell her to deal with it my dude.
---
You are certainly not a "high tier" PvPer, I don't do PvP because it's too unfair on the other person. The only time I've been killed is with an anti armour powerfist my friend had and he killed me in 17 hits. I, like any sent ass owner could wipe the floor with every non-sent ass player. It's just unfair
---
She deserves much better than the neckbeard you are, OP
---
they need a option to make bulk ammo and instead of single bullets they sell bullets bulked as well 
---
plans should have a quest where I can turn in random plans for a prize kind of like technical data
---
Good luck man, hopefully you can work things out
---
I haven't seen one either.  I've seen everything else, but not them.
---
150,000 between two accounts? Well, that’s bullshit… considering the max is 25,000.
---
I just make folders of certain types of pictures. You can swap them around from time to time
---
Would you like to sell that tse laser rifle?
---
only time i purchase junk from vendors is bulk ballistic fiber when I’m too lazy to go all the way to fort defiance and clean it out (or have already done so in the past 20 hours), definitely not worth it otherwise
---
If anyone here wants to sell their legendary laser rifle/pistol hit me up I love using them
---
I just miss Pre-War Money being worth a damn.
---
😳
---
I don't know you except from this dumbass post you made about going over to the adventure server and annoying everyone there because Bethesda isn't giving you enough caps on survival. 
---
You really must've tore the place up with your 5 cap bounty :P
---
Cheaters should be perma banned. I hope they never lift the ban.
---
If I kill an enemy in VATS and I'm indoors, I get a white screen flicker before going back out of VATS. It's awful. There's a bunch of other new glitches I experienced in my last 10 minutes playing in the new patch. I'm going to put F76 down and wait for a few hotfixes, the game imo is currently unplayable.
---
&gt; I’m sorry that you feel lied to, or maybe even terrified that one day, rich people will log onto Appalachia with the ability to store 900 lbs worth of shit in their stash and have mutfruit never decay.
---
Uh, that's pretty much what's happening. People feel they lied to us because they actually did, when they said Atom Shop would be cosmetic only. That's false advertising, customers have all the right to complain about it.
---
Right now hunger, thirst and resources are just a part of the game. I wouldn't care if they made an Easy Mode with slower food decay and more durable weapons and armor (it could be balanced with less XP gained For example) BUT if you make it skippable with real money you are annoying people playing the game until they pay like it's a free to play game and you haven't paid anything for it.
---
Next week we get the new dungeon. Would you enjoy it if it was long and full of high level enemies with no workbenches? Would you like it if every one use only repair kit costed 250 Atoms, which in real money means 2.5 €? Isn't it funny that they nerfed the White Knight perk and people complain about food decay being faster now, and they suddently talk about making you pay Atoms to make it less annoying? By the way now you need to kill a glowing enemy in a RADSTORM to get 10 Atoms from a daily. I've played hundreds of hours and I've seen 4, now you gotta get one to get ten cents worth of Atoms, what a fucking joke. If that's the price to pay for new painful and annoying content, we don't want more content.
---
Fallout 76 had enough shit already, we don't need more. The game still has a lot of unfixed problems and they are already breaking their promises and asking for money in shady ways after only 2 small dlcs.
---
900 lbs is 408.6 kg
---
Are you trolling us with the bulking of screws everyone knows you can't bulk screws because it is the most rare junk in the wasteland I could probably have 10,000 Ultracite rounds before I had 250 screws
---
The only unbearable ones for me are the meditation palice and the frame skips that happen in certain places.
---
Thanks for the love dude.
---
I'm lvl 307 and die constantly at the event. But I get some serious licks in on the imposter. I hit him a few times, his health goes down, he kills me. Rinse, repeat
---
You’re why I grief people.
---
Yep, CAMP is not fun. I make a little shack, because there's no point in building up something cool if I have to move it (or the server FORCES me to), and if it's too complicated it won't fit anywhere, which then I'd have to break-down the blueprint, which then makes certain piece of my CAMP disappear randomly. Man, what a feature. Thanks Todd. :\^)
---
I wonder what happens when I jump into that fissure?
---
Check if your antivirus is not blocking it...… I know it sounds weird but my antivirus asks me from time to time whether to block or allow audio from Fallout, I don't know why
---
i would hit up Harpers ferry for loot more often but that place is like a mf maze to me i swear
---
The world map for 76 is better for sure but not having local/interior maps is not great.
---
My number one request is what legendary effects can roll on all the weapons. [Example M79GL cant roll Double or Quad]
---
I've gone as far as is currently possible in them (all locations checked off for the challenge); not missing anything. It's just always hung out as an incomplete quest.
---
Even if you scraped it, the pieces would be in your inventory.   A friend had the server crash and when he logged back in PA pieces were gone and his equipped weapon.  It would make me move on to another game(rage quit).
---
Happens in fallout 4 too
---
They actually brought the game back to BETA-level stages of brokenness. I'm putting this down until they make it playable. LOL
---
Was it in your stash, inventory, or equipped?
---
you wouldn’t happen to know a man named Dio, would you?
---
Oh i guess they are going to add more to it maybe or fix it
---
I think it's fair game unless they're legendary. I always kill everything at uranium fever and then change to a weapon that won't 1 shot when the legendary comes out.
---
You’re doing it wrong then. 250 screws are pretty easy to find if you know where to look.
---
In situations like this, let them hit first. That way they always get exp and loot. You can then finish the mobs off in one shot. Alternativly you can join their team.
---
Yeah everyone hates gamestop but least they take it for around a 1/4 to 1/5 of the price.
---
this is proof that gamers are the most oppressed minority
---
You can try and buy the mods on the market.  You can also use T60 legs as the cal shocks are 1000% easier to find.
---
Same issue here
---
Find out the exact time the local servers switch and re-spawn items, normally this occurs at the same time the Daily and Weekly challenges countdown counter reaches zero and resets. Usually this is 9am / 10am EST or 2pm BST. Then server hop following the directions and instructions by "Sifting Flour".
---
It’s a supply and demand economy. Robots have no need for what you have, so they pay shit. But they know you want what they have, so they can charge as much as they want.
---
Nah, it's not being blocked.
---
No people love it especially when you follow tradition with the usual curtsey of tapping them a few times and shouting into the mic OWNED to reassert your dominance. 
---
Generally speaking though .. those people are probably looking to kill them but wouldn't mind the added bonus of XP, I'd at least give people in the area an opportunity to tag them before you kill em, usually too people don't all have god tier weapons so they may want to kill them quick but it's not in their stars.
---
A gauss is a very different weapon than a gatling. The explosive boost from demo expert does far more than 10% extra damage.
---
I’m the most oppressed of all - middle aged, middle class, white and male. And a gamer. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Hmm Idk I have both I'll try out the differences later
---
Just be courteous and let everyone get a hit on legendaries
---
Regardless of who attacks, is xp split among the team?
---
They implemented that so you’re forced to trade with other characters, not just NPC vendors. I often just brown-bag all my unwanted ammo and leave it places
---
falloutmarket76.com Register. Trade. Get Caps.
---
Oh, this is cool. I'll make sure to go there as often as possible and pick up all the junk and trash it. so no one else can use it :\^)
---
When I first started playing, really low level, learning the controls, etc. I was exploring Morgantown at level 5, when I hear the nuke alarm go off. Not thinking anything of it I’m still exploring... until I see another player suit up into radiation gear and run away. Still not used to the new controls, I bring up my pipboy to look at the map, until I remember that it’s not that in 76. I see on the map that I’m in the middle of the nuke zone with less than a minute left. I died at ground zero on the steps of Vault-Tec university and got the achievement for it too. But now I always bring up the map when the nuke alert goes off so I can gtfo out of the blast zone
---
Setting up a landmine barrier near the bottom of a very long and confusing flooded mineshaft I'd been exploring for half an hour.  Well, it seems something snuck up on me while I was setting a 4th plasma mine and the entire area exploded.  Took 10 minutes to get back to that area to collect my loot.
---
I hope they aren't holding it back because of clipping because id be fine with stuff clipping with it.
---
From what I can tell yes, but feel free to correct me if im wrong.
---
Agreed.
---
Well, some players do want to decipher the codes themselves and the ping is helpful for them.
---
That said, there are a couple sound effects that bother me.  There's the obvious glitch that sometimes happens when another player is using any Minigun-style weapon and the audio just gets stuck in a loop, even after they leave.  This happens a good 50% of the time when I do SBQ battles.
---
The second is the obnoxious tap dancing routine that the Scorched do inside buildings, like Riverside Manor.
---
I imagine that a lot of people are genuinely surprised that Bethesda threw out a boss with actual mechanics in it.  The only other one I can really think of off the top of my head is fighting the raider boss in Nuka World.  For once, it's something that can't be solved with more dakka like nearly everything else in all of their games.  But this is good.  It's a wakeup call that harder, more strategy requiring content is coming.  I'd rather half to flip three switches and take a debuff than just deal with another bullet sponge.
---
I call them the Beeping Dead... you know... as a reference to that one TV-series.
---
"we must save my family"
---
Don’t buy it. It’s not a Fallout game at all. You will buy it, play it, and after all of the bugs you try to ignore just so you can SLIGHTLY enjoy yourself, 10 more will pop up with the next patch, and 1 more that was already patched previously, will pop back up.
---
*it would be nice,* **IF THERE WAS A TRADE SYSTEM IN PLACE WHERE YOU COULD ADVERTISE.**
---
I killed three Scorchbeasts in the cliffs to the east of Whitesprings once without dying.  They all landed relatively close to each other, so I decided to take a picture.  As I kept backing away to frame the shot, I stumbled backward off a cliff and killed myself. 😂
---
Unsure, but took a couple hundred of Asylum runs to finally find the rarest uniform which was the Forrest Dress. Although the Ex-Asylum has a perfect combination and balance of hard enemies, TV Dinner / Surgical Trays for Aluminium,  Medical supplies, and Straight Jackets to sell for profit.
---
I just want clean walls, and more clean floors and furniture.  Having my scrapped together, POS base is good most of the times, but sometimes I want it to be clean.  With all the abraxo cleaner out in Appalachia, and with us fresh out of the sterile vault, am I supposed to believe none of us care enough to paint and clean our structures?
---
How can you possibly enjoy this game so much? Im curious. What other games have you bought?
---
Aw, shucks.  I'm a really Shit player at level 95 because people "take care of me" in the game so I have to put zero effort in.  In return, I farm legendary and supplies, and make a lot of double entendre.  It's win win.
---
All I wanted was a silencer. Took forever (well 20+ hours) to get enough drops to finally scrap a silencer out. Never found a plan for the handmade until I shopped at the Whitesprings new states vendor.
---
Took cover behind a car during a gun fight with several super mutants .. even I contributed to my untimely death as when you're too close to something whether or not you aim over it you hit it with your fire as well.
---
Close second was running through some woods super fast cause I'm a boss, jumping over logs and rocks alike, again cause I'm such a boss and nimble until one log was positioned at the peak of a cliff and I fell to a horrible death.
---
I have 6000 caps, 250 Springs, Screws and Gears several 3 Star Legendary melee weapons and yet no one wants to trade me an Explosive Heavy.

I mean fuck pairing, propper balance, roles, dungeons and the likes when you can slap overpowered enemies onto the map am i right?
---
Out of the top of my head, the only advice I can give to you is... tell her to go fuck herself.
---
Relationships are not business, people don't own each other like property. I only tolerated that bullshit ONCE, 20 years ago, but I was young so... but now, no more. 
---
If she doesn't like that you play an online multiplayer game and interact with other people, then obviously she shouldn't be with you. Condescension? Fuck that. Is anything that you do not let her do? no? then why would she?
---
The signs are there, man, end this. NOW.
---
Go fire three rounds through it, then repair.
---
I keep forgetting about that place!  I need to go there to stock up for the burrows.
---
No one ever believes this happens. In a game about grinding for months for specific gear, flakey inventory is so scary. I have had 2 legendary weapons "vanish" as well.
---
Thanks for the offer... stuck doing chores.

Yes. (From easiest to hardest).Dirty and Weathered White (always in the same spot), White, Brown, Green, Blue, Yellow, Red and the hardest to find Forrest Uniform. Unfortunately the standard, "clean" version of the White Asylum Dress is still dirty. There is also a standard nurses uniform that spawns near a shop next to the AVR Medical Centre.
---
The band will be lifted when they can implement a log and tracking system for trades.
---
I believe that to be the root of the whole 100,000 items / suspensions. They can't track player trades so they assume those vast amounts were duped.
---
I believe it's a latency thing.  The laser needs to have line-of-sight to hit you, but it's like the routine that evaluates line-of-sight doesn't happen frequently enough, so you end up taking damage through walls and other obstructions you put between yourself and the Assaultron.
---
The best strategy I've found, now that I'm strong enough to do it, is to literally go up and punch them in the face with the Power Fist.  No more dancing around lasers.  No more crippling legs with Enforcer.  Just smash them.
---
I have soooo many. It’s a problem. That day can come already. I want my space.
---
That’s depressing. Doesn’t a BE handmade do like 400?
---
If you have never played a video game ever before, its a great choice.
---
Oh I guess that's important. Haha psn
---
World of Warcraft has a varying sell price for things, most of the time it's 1/4 of the buy price, which is reasonable, but 1/4 of 1/4 is pretty ridiculous.
---
The white knights don’t need repair kits cause their shit doesn’t break.
---
Yeah great idea those level 1 guys really need that ammo
---
Skype used to also do this for me, it would add random people from my friends list into my group calls and I'd have to explain to them what happened every time to not make it awkward when I kick them after...
---
Probably. 220 with all perks and very low health. Before the patch that broke/fixed adrenal reaction it did 440

Buy a bag of marsh mellows and throw one at her everything she yells at you, if she becomes violent use the bag as a cushion to shield the blows.

We all know females are emotionally unstable you could wait 3 days and when she asks who you're talking to tell her it's Stan from marketing and it's important you connect with him for your promotion.
---
Appreciate your solidarity man, but I’m only showing you one side of the story, and mostly just for laughs. There’s nuance to this situation that my post doesn’t allow for.
---
Pre nerf explosive pump action shotgun. A lot of times.
---
The only ones in the game atm are the 4 received during the current set of quests. There will be a part two!
---
All auto melee weapons are catastrophically broken. You can over-repair them and they arw decent.
---
I have a bunker so o xant have a porch thanks for the suggestion tho I really hope they are metal keypad doors for the aesthetic and the defense
---
I'm level 55, not that high I know, but I'm still waiting for some kick ass weapon to drop from a legendary, something I can pull out and say,
---
"Oh?! So that's how you wanna play?!"
---
..but nothing. So I'll keep strugglin' on with my basic pea shooters..
---
Complete events, take/defend Workshops, complete quests, sell excess materials (some cooked food &amp; aid items net quite a bit of caps, clothing weighs next to nothing so you can pick up everything &amp; sell it later).
---
I prefer to play the game solo, so why can I get decent caps from this damn robot. Can't I just hack him.
---
No one said that I don’t believe you. Fake news.
---
Items break at an incredibly fast rate. Bethesda set that rate. Then Bethesda says we will sell you a way to fix them instantly. Its Play-To-Win....for Bethesda.
---
BUT IT LOOKS SO FUN.  Fun to rip into a gang of lvl 1 ghouls.
---
Psn
---
Sugar grove always gives me at least 1. As someone else mentioned, the cylindrical drawers have a good chance at a spawn.
---
I found a lv5 AAE combat shotgun once that I gave to my brother when he started playing - they do drop
---
I got an explosive pump shotgun level 5 dropped from a ghoul.
---
25% of the item value is the cap. With 15 charisma, and the maxed hard bargain card, the best they give is 25% when selling. 
---
Adding a grape Mentat onto that (+5 charisma and better bargaining skills for 10 minutes) does not help bring in more caps. It’s still hard capped at 25% unfortunately.
---
After 400 hrs I have seen 1x cal shock for X01 in the enclave vendor.
---
I left it there cause I had bought them already.
---
I generally try to damage but not kill, and try to make sure others can tag legendaries before they die.
---
If I’m farming a place like the Whitespring and lower levels are around, I’ll get the aggro and let them tag them before I swat them.
---
Yes, you are correct it is for convenience. I explained this before when the news was released n people were crying it’s pay to win. If you have the “weapon artisan” perk card fully maxed it repairs your weapons to 200%. The most an advanced repair kit can fix something is to 150% I believe. So if those values are correct the only real advantage to using a repair kit is if you are away from a workbench or don’t have that perk card yet. Some people aren’t fans of collecting n hoarding junk so this is a way for them to just wander the wastes with fewer restrictions on their role playing.
---
Yes because during the darker stages ppl would show off with them at whitesprings..all low-level players
---
They get that weight reduction because of rounding you moron!
---
 Trying stratigically to fall down a cliff. then dying and went back to the cliff tried to stratigically fall down it again to get my loot and dying again

Enclave Radio would be nice
---
You're reading too much into his comment, there's no need to be so aggressive man. People are doubting you because it's been happening again and again in this subreddit that people don't understand one mechanic or another and immediately point to it as a bug. Or they make a post like "did they increase hunger or thirst?"which happens after every patch because something in the game "didn't feel right".  
---
You can't be offended because people are doubting you because you're basing it on nothing but "it feels wrong" and we haven't tested it like you have so we have no reason to believe that. Stop playing the victim man, no one is attacking you.
---
Crafting ammo or bulking junk
---
My inventory. I checked my stash and it wasn’t there. I didn’t rename it either because I know people have been reporting bugs
---
Inside next to benches?
---
It use same space as the stash. Full stash= no slots
---
We should be able to lock items so they can never be removed
---
Tell her to go fly a kite
---
To be honest that’s my current mindset. I’m so disappointed
---
Falling inside fissure site and losing all my loot
---
The games economy is what made me put the game down a few months ago, I still follow it for the time when I may come back but I haven't seen anything big enough to draw me on yet.
---
Here's hoping you dedicated gamers can get the game where it needs to be! Upvotes for you all!

She ain't the one

The only cryptic I've seen it's the Wendigo, but I'd not really count that.

No?? Haha I’m so confused.
---
I dunno man, how big is your vehicle, can it sleep 4 and, can you get WiFi in it?  Dog takes up 2 spots :)
---
&gt; craft the lowest level gun 
---
wow I seriously never thought of this lol
---
Do u mind telling where..I've only been there a few times
---
Aww lol if ur on Xbox, add me and I'll see what I can hook u up with
---
I think the max is 125,000 (5 characters by account). 150,000 between two accounts is possible.
---
I'm a casual kind of player, almost level 40, and I would really just like to buy plans to beautify my CAMP if nothing else. And they're so expensive. For the first time I ran into a trader and a couple of people up for trading at his CAMP, and what I realized is even if I had several hundred caps to spend how do I know if what he's asking for something is a fair price? Maybe if I spent hours looking at trading websites or boards I would know but I'm not looking to spend that much time on a game when I'm not even actually playing it (like I said, filthy casual). That's why vendors are still important I think, even with player trading.
---
20
---
its so sad :'( really hope they fix and buff these weapons.
---
i will check the youtube video out thx :D
---
It's spread over different characters, so no bullshit here!
---
I wish we could use it on vending machines at train stations.
---
they are so fun xD i use the chainsaw for ghouls. feels great xD
---
Are you denying they do it?
---
It’s not bad... bugs new and old are still around.  Stability is questionable.... 4th disconnect today.
---
I understand your concern for this not to go full on pay to win n I understand that it’s a slippery slope when adding new items that can potentially cost real money. I think Bethesda is doing a good job of trying to take feedback from the community right now. After the release of 76 there were a lot of requests to bring back repair kits from the earlier games n Bethesda is doing that all be it in the atomic shop. I appreciate the fact that they are listening to the community n I am fine with this n even the super hero costume that gave you a +10 to your HP since you couldn’t wear armor under it. Bethesda is doing fine with making things interesting but not OP. I also know there are many ways besides spending real money to acquire atoms in game. Try not to let this bother you wastelander shits gonna be alright.
---
It's fun man, you can have a good time and get up to zany hijinks.
---
Ya all the paints are about the same cost
---
Well most of the bad reviews are outdated by now but a lot of them had their merits, it was really buggy and glitchy at the beginning .. it still has it's bugs and the possibility of new ones cropping up with each update is highly probable with their track record. Balance needs much work like most games, especially when it comes to pvp.
---
With all that aside as a generic survival it does the job. Weapons and armor break very frequently even when you take measures to slow it as well as hunger and thirst but generally speaking these are the basic activities in survival games. Building when it comes to your CAMP and captured workshops is entertaining and has a decent enough selection and options which continue to grow as updates come.
---
Items spawned into the world like toasters, oil cans etc can only be looted by one player so some aspects of the game promote solo play, but like any game it's much more fun with friends to tease and verbally abuse along the way.
---
Is it worth the 30 bucks, yeah it is .. will you get frustrated with it periodically .. absolutely. It's got the basics of any survival type game with the added bonus of other shit to do (Quests/Dungeons) besides collect/build/eat/shit/sleep .. plus it's got additional combat mechanics that have at least 3-4 builds you can experiment with for variety in gameplay.
---
It isn't stealing things when they are laying on the ground. For it to be stealing they would have to be taking it from your character. NOT from the junk dropped on death which is designed as a punishment for dying.
---
I was just saying a bout a month ago how we need a Wowhead style wiki for this game including average prices for specific popular items and was greeted by the ignorant acting as if I was proposing the impossible.
---
I'm not for straight up "pay to win" mechanics, but "pay for convenience" mechanics are what will fund future content and development. Server maintenance and continuous new content cost considerably more than you paid for the base game. But, hey, it's your right to complain about mostly minor changes, as much as it's my right to buy a choco-rad fountain for my base that cures my rads and decreases my hunger.
---
It depends on what kind of medic you want. 
---
My support gunner uses 9 chr. And spams diluted stims to heal. It gets me tenderizer and supressor. 
---
You're gonna want more if you want radiation removal and the flame healing one. But honestly with the stimpack sharing and maxed first aid I do fine. 
---
For barebones medic you'll want 3 chr and 3 int. 
---
For a support gunner 9chr 3int. 
---
For a maxed medic probably 15chr. And empath plus defensive perks to give you staying power.
---
I find the game quite fun, once I immersed myself deep into the game.  But if you’re on PC, be prepared for *a lot* of game breaking issues.  Not the cute little color blinking ones....the ones where the game and server will crash quite often for no reason, you lose a random bit of progress, enemies still don’t function properly, main storyline quests are still broken, and be scared of updates making the game even more unstable.  I wish I was exaggerating when I say that the game is still unplayable at times.  My personal experience has been heartbreaking and infuriating.
---
But if the game decides to run halfway decent, you can make the game whatever you want it to be and actually have a lot of fun in it.  Sadly, this is the most infuriating part of all of this...
---
I have a two shot explosive laser rifle that i slapped a beam splitter on. Damn thing melts everything it touches, even with how bad laser weapons are. I would absolutely adore any buff they gave laser weapons, to be honest.
---
It was pretty epic tbh you missed out on one hell of a blood bath
---
Pretty sure that each legendary gun/armor still follows the the level rules. So for example the handmade can be crafted by level 15 so that’s the lowest legendary level you will find of that type. Combat rifle is level 20 etc. 
---
They do drop randomly as I have gotten a few TSE 2 and 3 star drops. 
---
Throwing out this random thought also. After I made the switch to AA and AAE  weapons and got 5 to 10 in my stash I started seeing more drops of those type. 
---
Could be pure coincidence, but it was like 5 in a row.
---
I'd say it's a mixture of scaling, the brief invulnerability when respawning and what looks like the old explosive weapon bug that was supposed to have been patched. I've noticed too that some things take a bit to load when spawning or fast traveling, maybe some features or mechanics of survival mode are loaded in after, kinda overlayed on top of adventure mode to create survival mode. Either way, I who heartedly agree there's some massive balance issues with pvp.
---
They're not that easy to find. I only have a two shot heavy, but I don't want to lose it. Most people only have one.
---
I'm sure you tried to communicate and let others know what to do right? Or like a bitter douche just decided to make a whiny post on reddit.
---
No-no, I feel u there, I've noticed the same
---
What kind of a roll?  A Swiss roll?  A bread roll?
---
appreciate that :) but PC.
---
Maybe it's a platform issue? Can't say for sure, but it's a thought, and I only suggest it because I have not noticed any lag at all recently on my PS4 (not sure what platform you're on).
---
if you ever come to my camp and do that, i'll frown at you SO HARD
---
Honest question. Did you name the frame? I lost my T-45 that way also.
---
Just because it isnt a traditional MMO doesnt mean they dont share MANY of the same mechanics.... You know like RNG %, Item locations, NPC data.... and the list goes on............
---
You can stop that from happening by not dying, or dropping off all your junk before you go into a place where you aren't sure you can go without dying.
---
I've been playing the game since BETA and I've never once needed some carebear hand holding like that. I know that dying in the game has consequences, one of them is giving other players the opportunity to loot the stuff you drop. That is literally the POINT of junk being dropped on death, if you die you will drop all the junk you have on you for anyone to loot for free.
---
Nope I’ve been avoiding naming because of the bugs
---
I am ps4 and the jumps are unbearable..
---
Ya I did not know that. Has to unname all of my power armor.
---
Where
---
I was asking about the repair and modify options.
---
I want weaponX it sounds amazing by name alone.
---
&gt;My question is WHY are they different? Why can you sell some in it's "raw" form, but others you have to bulk? Why do steel and lead reduce their weight, but none of the others? It all seems arbitrary and makes little sense. 
---
The reason you can still some things without bulking and others must be bulk is value. Things that are worth more than 1 cap per unit can be sold. Things that are worth less than 1 cap per unit cannot be sold, and must be made into bulk which sells for some amount like 5 caps per 30 units. So the reason you can sell some stuff without bulking, and the reason those things can't be bulked, is because bulking only exists in order to sell things which cannot be sold individually.
---
As for aluminum and lead weighing less, honestly, I personally think that was just an incorrect value being entered, and they just never bothered to fix it.
---
You think those mules with extremely over encumbered states? All of my mules are insanely over encumbered, if I want to add something to them or take something away then I just pump them with str boosting foods and excavator armor. 
---
Not to mention those million pound mules can still get their stuff off of them through death. They didn't fix those mules because they can drop things through death instead of "destroy" in place of drop.
---
From the fast travel point, head north up the road until there is a park with a path to the left. Follow that to a salon building. It has a sign. On the top of that building is a small stack. Just inside the door should be a handmade on a shelf.
---
Same problem on PC. I have all the materials required, but I cannot fix it. Anyone resolved it in some way?
---
Misjudging a fall. All the time it's the fall.
---
It's an event not a quest
---
No, they don't. You're being incredibly hostile for someone who has no idea what they're talking about.
---
U are the man..Harper's ferry is part of my daily routine..will add this to my route..I've been meaning to check out that place also +karma
---
Testing out my fully maxed Adamantium Skeleton perk card. I decided to jump off a cliff to test out my new unbreakable legs. I forgot I could still die from the impact damage of jumping off a 100+ foot cliff. The bonus was my body landed on a small ledge about 30ft above ground level so my junk was stuck just outta my reach.
---
I saw that yesterday. Maybe to modify ammo from one type to another in a future update?
---
Funny thing is i'm on Xbone and since all those server maintenance sessions crash rates have been progressively decreasing for me. My only problem nowadays in the fight with the Queen is that she's usually just an absolute bullet sponge. If there aren't enough people packing proper firepower in the fight, what usually happens is that the timer runs out before we can kill the damn thing.
---
I once went to help kill a camper at whitesprings train station, coming to help I spawned up took position and waited, the victims came running away sweating at how shitty the guy was I said I’m here to help stood up and gave the &lt;3 they immediately opened fire, laughed and said they were dicks. I’ll never help another player in survival mode.
---
If you’re playing then it’s not dead
---
Ive had this issue 5 times so far with that stupid event.
---
I think it’s just confusing as most people would assume that he means two characters
---
Same. Its pissing me off
---
Berkeley springs. You can find a tutorial on youtube with the exact location.
---
I’ll look for it
---
Its not
---
No. You must tag to get xp. I play on teams quite a lot.
---
Honestly its good pvp armour but what you are saying is plain incorrect you can kill somone in sentinel with 5 shots from a 1  star bloodied rifle. Don’t know what else to tell you except you are outright wrong. Not only that these simulations you do don’t take strategy into account you are literally telling me how pvp works as somone who openly admits doesn’t do pvp at all. Cbf to argue with you anymore since you have no idea what you are talking about... enjoy fallout.
---
Anytime I try to invite someone into my world to buy something or do the same, I’m usually queued or they are because world is full.
---
Precisely
---
I find it displays zero at random times even when it should be reset. Try selling and item and the caps show up.
---
Connection-type lag I don’t think I’ve ever noticed in several hundred hours.
---
Framerate lag however, sheesh this game takes the price. Running 2 2080Ti’s in SLI and a 9900K. Jumping from 25-200+ fps. 
---
Possibly the worst optimized game in history.
---
The food decay issue seems to have been fixed (I played for 6hrs today, and crafted food once), I also ran westtek 4x, whitesprings 7x or more, and the new event twice without going below 100% on my armor (lucky break). I can't help but think that most of these minor changes/issues get hyped up until they seem practically game-breaking. I do agree though that Bethesda should stick by their original stance of cosmetics only in the atom shop, although I also want them to get enough revenue to provide us with kickass future content. I'd rather have actual weapon skins (not just paint jobs) than these upcoming repair packs. Give me a raider handmade with bones, or a futuristic enclave assaultron blade.
---
The recent update didn't cause any serious lag issues for me (I'm on Xbone for reference). The only case I can think of is usually entering the Whitespring Resort. Upon entering, i'll usually rubberband once while textures load and then i'll be fine for the remainder of my time in the building.
---
&gt;1) you have no idea what you're talking about. You can't tell people what someone else is thinking.
---
I don't care what they were thinking about. Be it intentional or not they have still negatively effected gameplay.
---
&gt;2) You don't know how repair kits are going to work.
---
Yes I do, go read up the datamined info. 
---
&gt;3) You understand nothing about programming if you believe any of that.
---
LOL, uh huh. 
---
&gt;4) You may very well be right, but you have no evidence or logical explanation behind what you're saying, other than 'well it HAS to be!!1!'.
---
You aren't even making sense. What is it you are even arguing against?
---
Do you deny that the change in how repairing works that was added in the patch that repair kits were announced and had the ATX info about them added in?
---
Or do you deny the moving the repair function where you have to go into inspect just to repair the item is less intuitive, slower, and inferior to the previous placement of the repair option?
---
You keep trying to put intention into actions when I've never said anything about intention.
---
It's a shame Fandom just bought out Gamepedia
---
Also the last patch seems to have changed it so that you cannot place already fermented beers into the fermenter.  Can only place things that can ferment.  Gotta place already fermented beers in your stash directly.
---
Agreed, it's just a bot junkyard now full of dead bots that die inside respawners

Anyway, nit picking and semantics aside please enlighten us as to how that failed debate is in any way relevant to the benefits of having a decent wiki.
---
Wish they'd add that ping to the dropped loot bag sometimes.
---
&gt; I managed to find a Two Shot Limb Damage Gatling Gun there when it was nuked. 
---
What the hell? I thought Bethesda removed the Two Shot Legendary modification!
---
OP here. Answer was "server glitch". Got a "server shutting down for maintenance please join another world" message. Joined another and Overseer's logs we're back in inventory...plus my stash. Most useless duping exploit EVAR.
---
I just returned to 76 after a few months of not playing. Running 2 2080Ti’s in SLI and a 9900K and I’m jumping between 25-200+ fps. 
---
I’m genuinely amazed how poorly optimized it is.
---
Over-repair them and they're not. More so if they're bloodied, they're just hilarious then. I've wrecked a scorchbeast in a couple of seconds with one.
---
You haven't hit the caps limit yet?

LOOT

RETURN
---
&gt;"pay for convenience" mechanics are what will fund future content and development.
---
No, cosmetic items is what should fund the future content, development, and server costs, if they struggle to get money from cosmetics there is something wrong in the shop itself, if they don't know which cosmetics ppl want, just make surveys
---
You can text chat on xbox, it is just a bit cumbersome.  Tap the xbox x, search their gamertag, then text them.  People do it to me about 1/week.
---
Really should be an ingame option on screen next to invite to trade/team.  There is space/buttons for a 3rd option
---
That's what I'm thinking
---
Jk tho. If you stop to think for a minute, it’s not truly necessary, but adding usable items behind an ingame store for ingame cash that you can pay real money for would make it pay-to-win (In my opinion of course)
---
Sorry for the huge wall of text above I got kinda excited
---
This happened to me yesterday as well. I didn’t initiate the event at least, so i didnt lose the 2000 caps. But really though, in an event where you are expected to die multiple times, this shouldnt be an issue.
---
That's dedication right there
---
&gt;I waisted 100 caps trying to do the sheep squash event as it finally appeared and I couldn't complete it. I took the nukashine before it come up.
---
That seems like a really strange thing to do.
---
&gt; Do you remember that some of you said: "i would pay for repair kits."
---
&gt; Sometimes comunity is 'the' problem.
---
You're calling the community the problem, so I'm sure there were several threads asking for this, but quite frankly, I personally don't remember seeing any requests for repair kits in the Atomic Store for real life money. Do you have any links to such threads?
---
What I *do* remember is not saying any such thing myself, so for what it's worth, I for one am not one of those "some of you" -people.
---
You mean this wiki?  https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Fallout+76+Wiki

Its not even the ghouls its the fucking mutant warlords

What's that?

Good to know, thanks! Haven't pushed it up past 15 yet, good to know there is no point (ps - don't forget sweet rolls as another boost)
---
joking aside, the fextralife.com one is the one I use the most as it seems to be the most complete and has the best layout imo
---
Where did you hear this?
---
Unfortunately not, I checked the data section of my Pip-Boy to see if there was a quest, but no luck :(
---
OMG could not find rum from either bars or vendors last night.  Wanted to throw some at the screen and scream "drink this!"

Finally just brewed it, but yeah... will be nice to have player vendors

The fight just needs a rework overall

"Sorry if I sound mad, but it's because I am." is the couples-communication story of my life lol
---
Dang it, that’s such a weird bug, good find though I’m excited for the backpacks
---
‘Getting back on” if you already have the game on your console, just log in and see for yourself, I don’t know who told you it’s dying but that’s complete rot, my servers are always well populated at any time of day. “Don’t want to play a dead game” well technically if your playing it.... it’s not dead, in my humble opinion it’s going from strength to strength and will be around for a long time to come.
---
They nerfed the effect a while ago.  It used to double the damage of your gun.  Rather than a 100% Damage increase, it is now a 50% Damage increase.  It is still pretty good but I personally think Anti-Armor and Furious are better because the accuracy and spread on Two Shot Weapons is pretty inconsistent.  At least on my Gatling Gun.

I’ll buy it

Tell her not to threaten you with a good time haha

I’m almost always on a que to join my friends world

It's a pain to play F76, I have disconnects every 10-20 minutes.

Try the community economy. Its much better.

I think that might be part of the problem, she’s the one that wants a good time ;)

Nope. Full worlds are common

On PC, we have no option for this really.

Guess you midget need to become mayor or something. Step up

“I’m your boyfriend now!..” 👅
---
Probably just the way the server works.
---
Not lag for me on ps4 pro
---
How’s the game gonna load your camp without you there?
---
Ok, I was worried that they were just adding the imposter and quitting lol
---
The nerf I knew about. I still think that was overkill and Bethesda should have just focused on Explosive, but of course there's not much that can be done about it.
---
Same
---
Agreed. Call it pay-to-play if you like; which is still troubling to add to a full price game. 
---
Unfortunately they probably cannot fund as planned with cosmetics, after giving out so many free atoms.
---
When you try to start the game do you get a message like there’s s problem with this account, check your email or contact support? You don’t want that one. That means it’s new account time.
---
These backpacks gonna be awesome, boys.
---
I'm set up outside the Charleston train station. I have signs set up about what I'm selling and what I'm looking to buy. I've only had one taker, the entire time, and I just gave him the item for free because I was so psyched to have an interested customer. I'm not the best business man.
---
Thanks.  And spawn this time. Got nothing but frogs.
---
Need a hermit crab and fog crawler too.
---
We got the mod:  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
I meant it should check first whether it can place your camp in world instead of putting you there first
---
Just use Fallout 4 wiki, its the same game but 10x larger.
---
What will the backpacks allow? Visuals and more carry weight?
---
For looks most likely. Plus whatever legendary stats or sets they have
---
In due time.
---
The camp is tied with your character it checks once you load in because that’s when your camp  loads in, it loads with you not before you (:
---
Leather breaks faster, why I tend towards other armor types.
---
EJECT! EJECT! EJECT!
---
Is there a plan for the spacesuit?
---
You have a better chance of finding Todd Howard’s phone number and asking him than getting a serious answer about that here.
---
 Hate doing events alone so I love when a high level player comes to the area and saves my ass. Doesn’t bother me at all if they one-shit the normal low level enemies but I do like to get a tag on the high level mobs if I can.
---
The devs doing something that makes sense? No!
---
But seriously I love the trading, it's just buggy as hell.
---
Maybe you're right, and cosmetics are all they need to gain enough money, but the current state of cosmetics would have to drastically change.
---
I always run out of 308 for my sniper rifle which I use the most always looking for lead to craft them. Trade with other players my other types of ammo.
---
That's a good point. I forgot about that and repair costs. Do you know of a table or data that shows the break rates and repair costs?
---
No... Any all the down votes?
---
Followed by "I wonder if I can reach my loot bag?"
---
I need the flux!!
---
Isn’t Elder Scrolls FTP? Have they abused pay2win in that game’s store? I haven’t played ESO in years, so that’s a genuine question.
---
Why? He clearly states accounts, not characters. There is a 5 char limit per account, so 2 accounts max cap limit would be 250k.
---
I saw that too. But there’s nothing in the list....yet. Probably like PatsBard said, for a future update. Hopefully for breaking down ammo.
---
And copper, cork, oil, and gears
---
Great feeling right? 👍
---
It costs 2000 caps to summon the event? Why?
---
Bethesda is all about making money via the atom store.  A great way of sticking to the cosmetic only would be to sell a power armor display station.  I would gladly buy that and it has no outcome on gameplay.  Now those repair kits, how about we just replace that idea with this one.
---
Sell civil war hats. You can max out daily cap limit with hats you make your self from mats you can gather in one run of welch and doing an aid drop for prewar money.
---
No, only have personal observation that my leather right arm is my most repaired equipment.
---
I don't get what was so off-putting about my response. Seemed innocuous to me.
---
You say that until it's 500 atoms for a new screwdriver and 600 for a new lock
---
All the Paddleball mods were cut from the game. They were to be learned through Plans, but for some reason they decided to remove them.
---
Don't scrap yours.
---
It doesn't stink either, apparently
---
They did at one point. Was that nerfed?
---
Seriously, reddit is the only reliable resource for information on this game. 
---
Every time I Google something, I'm met with 3 different wikis with absolutely the least useful information available. 
---
Upvoting for visibility.
---
there is already a FO4 power armor display station in the Garrahan Mining Building in Fo76 so they would only need to add them to our C.A.M.P.S. and give them their functioniality back
---
It's innocuous for sure, just not correct
---
I just checked. Bone raider is: 2 steel, 1 oil, and 2 bone per piece. Garrahan is plastic instead of bone. Mothman paint wants lead instead of plastic/bone. All the rest that I have want the 2 plastic, the oil and steel dont change.
---
This is not true. When I need caps, farm purified water and razorgrain in workshops in the Forest is profitable, fast and easy (even it is fun). I also farm gold and acid from hole in one workshop, sell the meat of the beasts attacking me on the events of defense and the rewards of aid items, but that things are a little more complicated.
---
You will need the perks for pick double flora, loot extra meat and craft a extra of items. You also need complete the power up Poseidon event.  
---
In a couple of hours you will have clean the vendors, and you will have water, aid items and gold to sell another day.
---
I think it was just a big misconception in the BETA.
---
I agree, but FO4 is 125 years in the future. Maybe the combat rifle hasn’t been converted to .308 yet?
---
Yeah the lack of text chat is an absolute travesty. Biggest missing feature for me to be honest.
---
The definition of pay to win is: "something you pay for that gets you an advantage of any sort or kind, that a non paying player doesn't get". So it is pay to win.
---
Especially they already have them on relay towers and some bunkers, so it shouldn’t be so hard to add.
---
I imagine the cc Creator would have to do it, and that’s if they allow it. Don’t see why not but that’s up to the people who make the game.
---
Huh. It's accurate to my experience.
---
No I remember when the glitch was around to dup resources you had to bulk it to keep the weight limit down.
---
That happened to me a few times in FO3 while I was drinking toilet water
---
Even if the aid is in my stash? You sure?
---
Same problem here. Everything else is fine, sliders are up. Tried doing a scan/repair. No idea.
---
Loose/box mods are bugged since the last patch, on every platform.
---
Not OP. But farm purified water a week. You will have enough caps.
---
Seems like a legit theory.
---
I never duped.
---
Honestly, it doesn't help that there seems to be maybe 4 big sites that all have their own "fallout wiki". It's ridiculous that there's no collaboration.
---
The thing is, they're all so wrong and full of speculation that I've personally stopped using them all
---
It's not because they nerfed it. Look at all the comments above that support that
---
Why do you need a microphone for this game?
---
yeah if its just a girlfriend and no kids are involved and she is already giving ultimatums it just going to happen again and again.   
---
but then again if youre sitting on the couch next to her playing while shouting at the tv as shes trying to watch a lifetime docudrama, then yeah, shut up.. look for a bigger place so you can have your own gaming room, sound proof the walls and shut the door.   
---
fortunately my wife doesnt care what i do as long is aint at strip clubs, wasting money and chasin women, she likes the fact she knows exactly where to find me. I have a game room in the basement so my talking on mic never bothers her.
---
Not sure about the food part to be honest, you are probably right on that one; about the armor thing, I was talking about the White Knight nerf from long ago.
---
I agree with you, most of these "stealth nerfs" are probably just biased opinions because of the repair kits and have little to no proof. But the thing about the repair kits is, any situation where armor and weapons break easily like a long boss as SBQ is no longer just demanding but a way to tempt you to spend real money. Nerf any of these QOL perks and it also becomes a way to get your cash.
---
And yeah, luck perks are totally awesome. It's kinda weird that you can completely bypass the microtransaction kits with certain builds.
---
Some people =/= The entire community. You're the problem. You not only are not providing anything to the conversation, but also fanning flames with your flag waiving and holier than thou attitude.
---
It's forever, don't worry. You'll eventually get as sick as you do playing SBQ events. Imo they really messed up with their first added event being limited time, makes everyone second guess every other event they'll come out with. Can't wait for "Is the Burrows limited time?" lol
---
Just under 2k. I think that's the price for the assaultron circuit board, one of the mats you need to craft the recall card.
---
For real. I have a max level instigating plasma sniper rifle and it's still poop compared to my lvl 35 gauss.
---
Relax, I wasn’t the one calling him out. I am just saying that I immediately took it at two character as that guy did. As most people to my knowledge, don’t have two account.
---
Good bot.
---
Don't know the WIki's policy but screenshot it and mark it on the map perhaps. Check the wiki guidelines.
---
First solo silo attempt. Assaultron killed me @ final silo stage with statusbar @ like 99%
---
They have different special abilities based on how you customize them.
---
You don’t, but it does add to the game and I only use it when playing in Survival with some friends.
---
Fandom has a defined video program where they work with content creators to feature videos on specific wikis. The Fallout wiki is one of them that had this program. I think you’d have to go through Fandom in order to get feature videos added, but you should read the wiki’s guidelines about their stance on adding media to pages.
---
Never said you did. I got duped gears and screws and I bulked them to cut down on the weight limit back when the stach size was 400, All of the duped items got removed in the end regardless, but I do remember bulk helping with the weight. Yes it’s a huge waste of plastic but it did do something. Also bulk is mainly so you can sell it to venders if I remember right.
---
Wow really? Dang
---
A CALL TO ARMS, LETS GO PEOPLE
---
I didn't say it was. I know it wasn't a nerf. I haven't gotten shit in forever, it's always been nerfed. Or I've always had horrible luck. That's my whole point. I'm not even confident legendary items exist outside reddit at this point.
---
/s?
---
My camp is "impossible to place down because an object is floating" since November. Some bugs are here to stay apparently :/
---
I like it due to my dailys actually reseting
---
🙏🏻yes!
---
You misunderstood the question. How long is the content. Not “is it a limited time”. Can I start from the train station, and bust out the quest line in a couple hours. 
---
Can you answer that?
---
The vaults are balanced for 4 people and aren't supposed to be soloable. I think the Burrows is sort of meant to be an introductory dungeon
---
Awesome
---
+150 carry weight. People got some from the dev room
---
Could I please 😁
---
Sounds to me like A. You don't find legendaries or B. You're bs'ing
---
Awesome, thanks. I only have a couple hours to do it today cause of scheduling between friends. Just wanted to make sure we wouldn’t get cut off
---
I agree with a lot of your ideas, and hope the devs see and use these types of two-sided conversations to make more meaningful changes in the future.
---
I edited it my post before you commented, man. Don't do the side quests associated with it and you'll probably be fine. There's a lot of terminal entries you'll want to read and if you're playing with others you have to take into account the time if they want to read them too
---
Pretty sure the hunting rifle can have a .50 cal reciever on it. That being said an anime style oversized anti material rifle would be pretty sweet.
---
Hey, if you still need those mods applied I can hook you up. I run hardened and suppressor with mine but I might only have the medium NV scope. It'd be that or a reflex sight. If you're interested my IGN is Drazhan
---
It's a weird bug I've seen multiple times. Also legendary robots at watoga only exist during nukezones or very special events.
---
That sounds awesome! My buddy and I had a similar experience at Pleasant Valley station, where he also has his camp nearby. We fought against a group of 3, pushed them towards the station, got pushed back into the forrest, fought around the small lake. They even pushed us back to my buddies camp and we fought inside his house for some time. Not even once did they try to destroy the camp, it was just for the sake of a good PvP fight. This lastet like 30 mins and was an awesome experience!
---
Fake. Noone uses their mic on fo76 🤣
---
Thanks, good to know it's not just me.
---
Ah, timing is fun. Well thanks for the info then.
---
i bought the plans and just crafted to get the plans, so i don t need them anymore,anyway thanks for the sugestion
---
Is this the only way Bethesda communicates with players?  Is there a forum, a twitter account or maybe a Facebook page that they have?
---
Yeah I throw so much ammo and resources at the girl and it is never satisfying. Even worse when you dont kill her. 
---
Seems the real reward is all the adds dropping mass and radiation fluids. Then there is all that violet flux.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
Urgh. Fuck them so bad.
---
Is the new event permanent?
---
You're the one giving yourself a couple of hours for it, the questline doesn't have a time limit. Just wanted to be clear on that. The event at the end itself does have a time limit though
---
There is a .50 cal receiver for the hunting rifle.
---
Problem is it REDUCES damage.
---
Its the main way they stay in contact but there is their twitter and forums, but they actually said in PAX East i think it was that reddit was their go to
---
i doubt that was their reasoning for not adding it to be honest. they either just forgot or thought it wouldn’t be balanced etc
---
I saw one of the backpacks (a blue one with 105 carry weight if memory serves) in the inventory of one of those "lucky" rare fasnacht mask recipients. Still salty over that event simply for the reason I truly don't believe any dropped legitimately. Looking forward to the backpacks actual release however!
---
How do you know that it is a minority?  Do you oversee their community interactions?  Are you tracking all of their social media and forums?
---
I think lots of people here forget there are ways of contacting Bethesda that aren’t this sub.
---
What exactly are backpacks doing? We already have an inventory
---
I've got no reason to bs, but whatever.
---
that’s hot
---
[I'm doing my part!](https://media.giphy.com/media/YYfEjWVqZ6NDG/giphy.gif)
---
But its incredibly easier to craft 50 cal over anything else
---
Ah ok. Appreciate it. I know it ends in an event, but I’ve been staying away from spoilers. It’s just one of those “our group has one day a week to do it, and only a small window”. So I wanted to make sure. 
---
Thanks again
---
To be fair, the laser sniper barrel was garbage in FO4 as well. That doesn't ma le it better,  but that's just the way it has been. It also doesn't help that you can't see when it is charged or not if you have a sight on it.
---
Ill buy all your 308
---
Yup, it's a known thing. I'm upvoting every thread about it and encouraging everyone to submit an official report so that maybe, just maybe, they can fix it in the next patch
---
Probably from someone who doesn't play the game.
---
I can't believe I did all the stupid quests just to see the sheep and then when I finally get to summon it I have to wait 3 fucking hours? What? So of course I server hop bc me and my team have been grinding all night so we can do this. Finally find a server after like a dozen jumps where we can summon the beast and as soon as it shows up the level 100s that also showed up killed it immediately and I didn't even get to see what the fucking thing looked like. Holy fuck boys I'm passed.
---
Or brick walls that are brick on both sides. I dislike the white side soooooo much!
---
I’ve read anecdotal estimates here of it capping at about plus 60-70% of base damage. I use a Furious handmade, and that feels about right.
---
If also like to know this. I have a max level electrified furious buzz blade and it seems to stall out rather quickly.
---
I think he misses his job a little bit more
---
Then again leather’s crafting materials are really common so rather than repairing you can craft new pieces.
---
A few days before Survival mode was launched, I got disconnected from a server, and got asked which to select: Adventure or Survival.  I was like "WTF, that's not in the game yet..."
---
Fun stuff.
---
Yeah that's sad bro. Dont know why problems like these go un noticed
---
At lower levels, yes. When you start gearing with legendaries, not so muh.
---
Which 2 ? Lead and steel. ?
---
Fantastic, that's the spirit we had. Just a good fight and everyone walked away after without any griefing. Love the cat and mouse element behind that kind of pvp encounter.
---
They are the worst weapon type in terms of damage and perk support, but at least they are usable. Even if you have to empty out your western revolver or 10mm pistol into something for a whole five minutes, your pistol isn't going to break after you get it down to half health.
---
Yes, last night for me and several times last week. I posted here about the strange happenings for me in Watoga last week.
---
Wiki admin here. If you want any help with getting started on editing, send me a DM :-)
---
You can absolutely do all of it in a couple hours so long as you're not dealing with being overencumbered/inventory management (scrapping/storing), waiting for the slowest member of the party to catch up, and/or walking instead of fast traveling.
---
The end fight isn't very long nor is it very hard so long as the people grabbing the pylons know how to move around and stay alive without being downed.
---
honestly i just figured everyone uses Power Armor
---
As there are no NPCs and no children if the lore was logical, there would be no raiders as they would have all killed each other, I guess there would be one left wandering the wastes.
---
As a mole miner I would like to be extremely salty  swing my fists.
---
Just started playing a few days ago. See a map warning that someone has launched a nuke in the southeast area of the map. I am excited to see what this looks like, so I fast travel to the nearest place I have and book it towards the target. I see the nuke come down on the other side of a mountain and the top half of the mushroom cloud and I keep going because I want to look at it from over the mountain from a safe distance.  Ear in mind I'm like level 10 and do not have power armor.
---
Turns out I severely underestimated the radiation spread and I see my life bar being eaten by rads! So now I'm booking it in the opposite direction and nomming all my radaway, only now noticing that I'm overburdened and I'm moving in slooooow motion. I barely make it out of the rad cloud and think I'm cool only to notice the moth man that's also been chasing me when he kills me.
---
It was pretty awesome.
---
Level 181, currently only using weight and crafting perks
---
Once you get to high levels like past 50
---
You will be able to use max level weapons to maximize your damage out put.
---
You bet 😧
---
Yep old drum left of the armor bench.
---
Screws and Ballistic Fiber are a couple items that you can buy in bulk, but can’t bulk. If you can sell them for a value on their own, they can’t bulk. Bulk gives non value items value, and therefore a sell price
---
Thx bud
---
Nope, it’ll still scrap your bulked junk so don’t scrap all before putting it up
---
Legendary stats on regular armor puts power armor to shame most of the time tbh.
---
Its an event like the queen its not just exclusively for you
---
How much gear do you normally bring? I’m usually carrying around at least two large melee weapons, a combat rifle, and a sniper rifle.
---
I really need to specialize...
---
I didn’t like him, anyways
---
&gt; The white knights come out in force.
---
Twat.
---
IIRC any camp with available sale inventory is marked on the map.
---
Well I'm on my second toon I'm going for 15 luck and 15 charisma build so what ever offer the most protection and life lol
---
No, its not. The Scorched Earth even is timed and advertised.  And takes way longer. This shit was done before I could even see what the thing looked like.
---
Error Error -- absence of sense of humour detected.
---
Being able to 1-2 shot monsters is much more build dependant at higher levels. I have my character heavy gunner perked, and can kill most things with ease as long as I am using a heavy. My lever action takes a LOT of shots to kill something though.
---
It's vice versa for shotguns tho. The lazer rifle with all the rifle perks makes all the ballistic shotguns practically usless... a lazer rifle that acts like a shotgun with a beam splitter but still us a rifle technically. Has better range , ads accuraccy (u can snipe) rate of fire and ap cost then all shotguns.  It's damage per second makes the combat shotgun look like the biggest joke lol. So it goes both ways abit here.
---
I initially thought this was the case.  This is what I heard since beta.  However, I don't think it's the case. I don't bulk lead, and barely do aluminum.  I bulk everything else to sell.  After I bulk a bunch I always seem to save a few pounds. Now maybe that's because I use plastic, but either way I still save space. 
---
Not saying you're wrong.  But it does seem to save me some space.
---
The way I understood it is the camps would remain UNTIL someone else with that same location logged in.
---
Then the offline players camp would despawn.
---
This is my biggest turn off.. really no desire to come back until this is fixed.
---
ive got about 1100 hours in the game, still enjoy playing it.. worth the 80something us i paid getting tricentennial edition (sadly tricentennial wasnt worth it imo).
---
Yea I’ve been trying to get a dense mod on a chestpiece and it makes the clicking crafting sound but nothing happens.
---
Tons of people played it just fine, so while it had bugs and quirks, it was far from unplayable.
---
What if you could only sell in bulk? I haven't thought about the balance but something like 50 bullets=1 cap?
---
But...but what about the Assaultrons outside of Watoga D:
---
In all seriousness, I know; I'm trying to get the "beat up a bunch of robots" challenges and Watoga is obviously the best place for that
---
What type of combat build are you going for?  And what kind of perks are you running?
---
I'm fine with this as a starting point. Low ch character without any investment. In a RPG, I can expect that an unfriendly character with no economic knowledge will be ripped off and get a few caps for their treasures. But being the cheery salesman of the world, haggling your way through everything, and you can only get like 20% of an item's value? That is beyond stupid
---
Its a raid boss people are gonna kill it quicker theres tactics and having a whole server is better than 4 man team lot more bullet sponges
---
From what folks have datamined, you'll be able to craft backpacks with different abilities: more carryweight, increase time before food spoils, etc.
---
I don't believe you, she was probably kidding and you took it seriously.
---
I always approach from the church back door and work my way down. In sneak, nobody ever sees it coming, nice and quiet 😊
---
I DID ALL THE WORK AND I DIDN'T GET TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. MY QUEST WAS COMPLETED FOR ME BY OTHERS. NOT COOL.
---
I’m my experience it’s best to wander around the world, discover locations and do side quests and events till you’re around level 50. And then do the overseers quest and personal quests because then you’ll get high level weapons because those quest weapons are level based. And after you finish with the overseer quests then start farming high level areas like watoga, westek and whitesprings resort. Hope that helps :)
---
Don't listen to people who don't play the game
---
I think I may have a 2 or 3 star medics gatling that has explosive rounds of you’re interested. If you are let me know and I’ll double check the stats and trade it.
---
Yeah if this turns you off, better stay away. Or you know... just store your bulked stuff or sell it.
---
Its a known issue, last patch broke then, devs are aware.
---
I have no idea I never bulked stuff for weight, just for sale.
---
They shouldn't have "nerfed" TSE, they should have just deleted them because they're 100% duped.
---
Well have fun thinking that i guess its meant to be a server wide thing theres an anouncment just like the queen and people are gonna join wether you bitch about it or not
---
You'll get mixed answers with this. You're dealing with either a bullet sponge type boss type, a take a couple rounds to take down enemy, or a larger grouping of enemies.
---
If the guy had rare masks and a backpack, that was 100% a dev room cheater
---
I’m up for a trade, I’m out right now but I should be back in like an hour or so.
---
Omg! This is the best news since weeks!
---
Finally the text chat mod is back!
---
You really know what you miss when it's gone.
---
I've been getting, defend workshop from sheepsquatch regularly for past two weeks now, sadly it's never there.
---
I have one
---
There 2 .50 cal receivers for the hunting rifle. 1 is called hasty and the other is hardened. The hasty says is does less damage than the .308 but the hardened does more. But the hardened is a little harder to come by.
---
We all know, it's mentioned at least a dozen times every day
---
Honestly it makes sense that watoga would be nerfed. It was a 0 effort legendary grinding spot. Once you complete the quest they aren't hostile and you can farm at ypur leisure.
---
Probably best as a chart
---
Dude relax. Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game with raid bosses and event quests for every one in the server to play. You would be absolutely fucking desolated without other players. And you’re team of 4 won’t cut it. Keep farming the event and you’ll see it. God damn kid.
---
Good bot /s
---
You guys do understand that there's not much reason to bulk anything but steel and heavier junk? It doesn't reduce most things, the weight difference you see is due to all the plastic you're using. 
---
I'd maybe not let the scrap thing bother you so much.
---
yeah ive heard stuff like unyielding is broken as all hell when stacked lol. hope legendary power armor comes one day
---
Hey could I have them please?
---
Awesome news. Had given up on this, good to see it working again. Was a great community, hope everyone comes back!
---
Only other assaultrons I’ve ever seen outside Watoga are at Whitesprings. And it’s good idea not to kill those or the entire place wants to kill you.
---
Definitely do Watoga. It’s a mayors duty!
---
You would have been even more pissed off had you successfully completed it. The loot drops are pure shit.  Sorry this happened to you though.
---
At least you now have npc representation in the game soon!
---
Vile you tuber lies!
---
Sure. Just join on me. I'll drop them for you
---
I’m sorry dude. I bet those were some good pics too. I know they won’t be the same but you could always take more beautiful pics of Appalachia
---
X-01 is crispy and delicious.
---
This isnt the first post and having the server is nice so we got 3 guys being conduits while we all shoot its easier than 4 guys and no ones able to do a thing
---
I’m at work currently so probably won’t be on until around 5 or so. Just message me on Xbox so it’ll pop up on my app and we can keep in touch. Gt: Nfamous Shirley (make sure the space is in there) but I’ll hold it for you to take a look at.
---
It those guys didnt show up, all you would have scene is death and failure. Youll get a glimpse next time. Soon youll be pissed cause no one showed up at all lmao.
---
Dumping things into a public container is not "Trading"
---
He did give reasons for every instance. I agree it may be a bit pretentious, but he is correct here.
---
Huh. That's really interesting!
---
There definitely is a TOS screen.
---
Stash is safe only what you carry can be lost
---
Just incase u didnt get the notification, the other guy said it caps around 60-70% of base damage
---
yeah hit the new encryptid event take 30-40 stims with ya.. ignore the event and just run around stim'n peopl.. be outta stims in maybe 5 minutes.
---
course if ya wanna take the long route i got a friend that plays bloodied, i have to keep stims on me just to revive him i can introduce ya to him.. you can follow him around.. shoot any car he gets near.. say "oops sorry, missed the mob" hed prolly believe ya.. and roll on until ya got your 20.. in a day or so..
---
lemme know.
---
I was using a full BOS set for the looks and reasonable stats, but have been replacing pieces now with Unyielding now I’m running with low health and like the increase in Strength for my melee main build.
---
I've never seen a Flatwoods Monster.
---
Well, I say never, but one of the first times I saw a nuke I took a photo and when I looked at the photo there seem to be two tiny little shapes caught in the blast that look like descriptions of the Flatwoods Monster...
---
Cue twilight zone music.
---
Selling ammo would kill the economy.  You should be able to scrap it though for sure.
---
It’s intended purpose compared to what happens most of the time.
---
I hope not :(
---
He most likely critical shot you in the head.
---
Mutations serums in recipes exist
---
I would also love to see the Heavy Incinerator make a return (if they fix the fuel crafting cost that is)
---
Welp that's not the way it seemed. I didn't even get a shot in before the thing died.
---
I haven’t seen that, lemme look at the wiki.
---
I'm over 200, the game is really easy. Full set of unyielding armor, mostly bloodied weapons, in sneak I can kill anything really quick. Only problem I have is pvp or survival, I'm useless 😕
---
Thus is the first weekend I haven’t got an Sbq win , I would usually have about 10 wins under my belt thru Lfg by now
---
Mutations in a bottle? You mean Plasmids!! Sorry, wrong game! Lol.
---
Its almost like explosive being in the second slot huh?
---
Seriously the first week I got Speed Demon off the queen
---
&gt; The Scorched Earth even is timed and advertised. 
---
So is Encryptid...
---
Calling them pay to win is a joke. I thought it was just a giant meme where everybody was shitposting about it, are people seriously thinking these are pay to win? You won't even be able to spam your wallet for infinite repairs, the way they said it very strongly implied you will be able to make a one-time purchase for a PLAN. You will still have to craft them yourself. Not to mention that better repair kits will be available outside the atom shop...
---
My guess is 500 atoms for a plan that's going to require a whole bunch of rare resources (springs, screws, lead, maybe even black titanium or ballistic fiber). 
---
That last statement sums it up, anybody calling this pay to win either does not understand what the term means or is desperate to throw out as many negative buzz words as they can. It's not like that was ever the case earlier in the game's life cycle...
---
If you do the math, the weight per item is less when bulked than when it’s alone. I calculated it all out on excel one day lmao.
---
I’m not a high enough level to kill the queen, I just thought it would be easier access if you could make them.
---
Thankyou 😊
---
Hats only sell for 11c with max Charisma and Hard bargain now, just as an FYI
---
You can buy them at The Enclave base White Springs
---
Thanks to Lyalai and Keretus for sticking it out and finding a solution, rather than just throwing in the towel.
---
Like many others, vault 15 was part of Vault-Tecs grand social experiment. The Fallout Bible (by Fallout 2/Van Buren) says the experiment in this vault entailed that it was to stay closed for fifty years, populated by vault dwellers of extremely diverse ideologies and cultures. The situation caused by the experiment led to a great schism, during which four groups ultimately left the vault to brave the wastes during the spring of 2141. Three of these groups became roving gangs of raiders: the Jackals, the Vipers, and the Khans in the winter of the same year. The fourth group settled down a few miles west of the vault and founded the village of Shady Sands in the spring of 2142.
---
We can become raiders if we want to, because it’s our game too. It’s just icing on the cake that there is a lore precedent. Do you think America’s Best and brightest all share the same ideology?
---
Damn this returning player thing is anoying ass hell...just take an hour to play and look for your self jeeezzzz
---
Never seen them there and I look what’s for sale there everyday
---
No, I never did.
---
Yes I think it is. Something like uranium where it's nice exp. One shot nove on. Especially the legendary
---
Srsly? I never knew they were that common. I've only seen 3 and completed 2
---
The sheer amount of volatile incessantly blathering individuals on their open mics yelling throughout their homes or leaving their TVs or music blasting is unreal in 76. Never had as large of an issue with people who have no mic etiquette in a game. To be fair, I'm more used to team discord servers which is somewhat different. Conversely I played DCUO for a couple years which had a large younger population and it wasn't nearly as bad with many more people in tiny areas compared to the 24 on the entire server. I keep it only on party chat these days, are you not even supposed to use that or does she just hate the area chat thing? One I can understand but if she wants you to have zero communication period that's batshit.
---
You don't have to believe me, but I trade in a lot of plans and I always sell for half or less of what is the suggested retail value.  That being said some of the whitespring building plans are 1k a piece or more from the bots so you will still spend a bit at my shop to get the fancy stuff.
---
It caps out around 50%.  It increases by about 5% per hit up to that point.
---
I agree, the Gauss Rifle ammo the 2mm electro whatever’s weight so much it’s like 3 lbs for 4 rounds.
---
3 lbs is 1.36 kg
---
Rounding doesn't cut 50% of its weight. Play the game before commenting with hostility, will you?
---
As someone who has played WoW for a long while, I know what you are feeling.
---
I still remember those hours spent on trying to kill a raid-boss, that is otherwise not that hard to accomplish (if everything is done correctly), but the sheer amount of players who gave 0 shit about watching a video on YT to learn the basics has made it REALLY hard to do.
---
Perhaps the problem here is that players were not prepared for these raid-like events in a game about shooty-shooting everything that moves in the face... We didn't have bosses with different stages, we never had any special mechanics to kill anything... heck, the only end-game boss was literally a bullet-magnet that required nothing but cheesy weapon mechanics to complete. Basically, the only answer to any enemy-related problem so far was a B.F.G. - the bigger the better.
---
I agree with OP, that going forward we WILL see harder bosses with even more interesting mechanics, which will definitely require some cooperation to kill them. So may be this particular event will make people aware about other ways of handling a problem.
---
Course! Have fun out there Wastelander  👌
---
I'm not trying to argue with you and I'm completely relaxed, I was just more curious as to why people were glossing over the part where he states 2 accounts.
---
As for most people don't have 2 accounts, I am sure you are right that the average player doesn't, but you would be surprised at just how many do, remember the fo76 xbox bundle that came with the game started getting bundled with an additional copy of the game, so if you bought it you got fo76 twice. 
---
Got to keep in mind most stores tried to give fo76 away with as many things as they could because they had too many copies in stock.
---
Heavy Robot Legs also offer the best DR and ER combined.
---
Honestly, I think both Marine and Urban Scout need a buff, since they're very underpowered at the moment.
---
It wasn't when I did it.
---
Not sure where you're looking boss
---
Normal trade and military trade
---
Phantom devices and stealth boys are in the game for sneaking too. Havnt tried them with "the fixer" but maybe it would be good.
---
Wrong section there in the medical section
---
Play in windowed borderless mode, won't have that issue anymore. That is an issue with running it in full screen mode.
---
I'd got 100/150 = 1 or 2 caps would make sense. Getting 50 is easier so I think 100 would be a balance. The reason I say this is because you can craft anmo.
---
Do I need to keep the phantom device for something at the end of the side quest line or can I use it?
---
Then make a different term for it. Pay-to-win is specifically meant only for the worst offenders. Games where free players are second-class citizens getting demolished by paying players and who have no hope of competing without their credit card. Modern gamers needing to cry pay-to-win at everything took away any power that term used to have. It's like calling fast food commercials racist because they show white people with chop sticks.
---
Not saying you can’t be a raider, yes it’s your game too, just positing my thoughts on the matter.
---
Thanks for the mini history though, I’m not really into all the lore as it gets very complicated.
---
I wish there where people NPCs of all ages in the game to make communities of any colour more believable.
---
I'm seeing for Heavy Polished Robot Legs with mod 31 DR 31 ER 23 RR
---
Don’t mean to be annoying, I do really like the game also 😊
---
Well, you need to get a phantom device to finish the quest. But it gives you the recipe as well.
---
If enough people experience the same dramatic shift in RNG, it means something has changed. I spent hours each day farming Watoga prior to the patch. Some servers had lots of Legendary robots, some had very few. I never experienced an entire day without seeing a legendary robot. Since the update, I have not seen one single legendary robot in Watoga, outside of a Colonel Gutsy I ran into with a gang of roving Gutsys. I am not alone in this observation. It's obvious something has changed.
---
to be fair, people have been asking for stash space in the atom shop for a while now. it would be something useful for the people who don't care about skins to spend all their free atoms on. I still see posts about it from time to time
---
I’ve looked there a couple of times but I haven’t seen them, maybe all bought out already??
---
Yeah and you can get the mats to make enough to buy out the full 1400 caps with the number of hats you can make from a single aid drop and welch run killing mole men. 
---
The aid drop normally drops roughly 100 prewar money, which breaks down into cloth, and the mole men armor pieces break down into leather for the hat. You can make the 140 hats from those mats in about 15 minutes.
---
Since so many people are offering their unsolicited advice I just wanted to say *don't* leave your girlfriend over a video game. I know you're not going to, you seem level headed and chill OP, just felt the need after seeing that.
---
As for needing to stay up to play, I would find a way to tell her exactly what you said on here. It's an escape for you. She might have a hobby or favorite show or something, this is that for you. The only reason I say that is when I was in my 20s I would do something very similar, staying up late most nights to get time in with my favorite games. Eventually I just wasn't coming to bed early enough and that too had an effect on my relationship. I regret what I feel like was neglect there, but you don't get the chance to go back and fix the past. Fallout will still be around the next day!
---
She should go in another room or maybe look into some sound proofing.
---
There's always a bunch you can also server hop to change the ones that are there
---
I’m just trying to do the emp quest now, but I’m low level with bad weapons.
---
Ok thx
---
That's why I have dense and fireproof
---
This game is already unbalanced AF, but its fallout, so we tolerate it :)
---
I know there are entire threads on how silly/not silly it is the CR is chambered in .45. But I really think they could give the CR more life by adding .308 and 5.56 receivers. I liked fallout 4's idea of it essentially being a "weapon system", meaning you tailor it to your needs.
---
Just throwing these out there, but each chambering could have the following advantages:
---
.45: high-ish, better damage close-up, low range. Good option as a CQB weapon for rifle builds.
---
5.56: Lower damage, higher fire rate, better range, and accuracy. Ideal for commando builds
---
.308: High damage, excellent range, lower fire rate. Something to bridge the gap between the handmade and lever gun for rifleman builds.
---
Obligatory "I want the R91 from fallout 3 to come back. Its in all the perk cards!"
---
So I completed the watoga major quest so their all friendly to me but no legendaries spawn at all. I only get level 50 protections and lvl 24 assaultrons
---
Yep. But now there isn't any spawning at all. Too much of a nerf.
---
You can absolutely sell it to other players.
---
I should point out they're not cheap I believe you can get them down around 6700 caps
---
I’m 100% sure that this issue is related to Bethesda.net. It starts happening right after the initial sign in and atomic shop loading complete. Can happen anywhere, on main menu, in the game, while browsing the shop. Etc. I don’t exactly know the reason but I’m positive that it’s related to atomic shop and Bethesda.bet here is a [video](https://youtu.be/T-XZntjHX0s) how bad it is
---
It has to be this way, or the economy would break. When players trade with players, caps are not "created" or lost  But when you trade with vendors, caps are "created" to and removed from the world pool. By limiting the created caps and increasing the caps removed,  the world economy  is slowed down to a reasonable level of inflation. 
---
And Bethesda is paying attention. Notice the nerfs on selling thinks like civil war hats and raw flux. Too many caps being created without enough labor/time creates imbalance.
---
Same here, since the last patch.
---
I have 300+ energy resist on my armor, which has a good amount of vanguard and leather in it. The laser still does way too much damage for what it is. With that said, the damage would be acceptable if the laser worked right. But between infinite lasers and them being able to hit you around corners, through walls, or even behind them, the damage is unacceptable
---
Buy one from someone off the market, much cheaper
---
My thing is I bulk to sell... then on the way to sell (Jumping all over the map) I end up gathering more stuff putting my over my weight limit (so I can’t fast travel) I have to scrap and end up scrapping the bulk. This was happening pretty much daily.
---
Not according to the game files.
---
What about the fact that their laser damages you even when you go behind them
---
You have no idea, i was laughing so hard when i got that message. Like they won’t even let me state my case on why. I did it.
---
The trick is to use Weapon Artisan and over-repair them.  Weapon Artisan always conveys a damage bonus to melee weapons, but with the Ripper and Buzz Blades, it's almost double damage.  Unfortunately, it slowly returns to normal as the condition decays, and you can't over-repair it again until it's back below 100%.
---
Ideally, you could find a Bloodied one and really go to town with it.  I have an Anti-Armor Ripper that isn't too bad when it's over-repaired.  I'd love to find some mods for it though, or a dedicated place where Rippers drop so I could scrap them and learn.
---
I see one in lfg and wait patiently if world is full.,, as usually someone will end up disconnecting  and the kids playing usually get bored and release que :),.. takes 10 minutes sometimes but usually have a 3/4 success at joining
---
Why was it unplayable? Maybe you need an upgrade of your gaming device or a complete clean out of the device drive of old games etc to make read/write access faster.
---
Ghehe go enjoy it!:) its just everyday there posts like this,but mayby i should not look everyday here:)
---
I thought that only spawns marine armor/robot armor plans and the marine wetsuit
---
Get someone to level you, or get a pa and goto nuked zones with a group.
---
Ok
---
Stop making light of the fact that he quest is fucked up.   The quest sends you to the shed with  the computer at the end, and 10 times out of 10, nothing happens because not enough time has passed.   There's nothing  in the game that explains this. There's no notice explaining  you how  much longer is left until you can trigger the quest again.   People are landing on servers where it could only be a five minute wait, but instead they are hopping to the next server because have no idea
---
You shouldn't have to check reddit just to understand what the hell is going on.  And true to form, Bethesda hyped this event as a super- challenging end game event.  What's challenging about a boss that can be killed before people even get a glimpse of it?  Nothing.
---
Are they not in the game yet?
---
I know this doesn't solve the endless laser, but I've found rotating behind the while attacking is pretty effective at evading them.
---
Last staff told us, they didn't plan to merge the wikis and I think gamepedia staff is still going to take care of Gamepedia. So hopefully it won't end up changing anything
---
Okay, how does that apply ?
---
I tend to run with a combat, handmade and laser rifle, All Rise, a pipe bolt action rifle and three suits of PA.  I stashed the handmade but I'm thinking I might switch back to it.
---
Level 35 Laser Rifle with Explosive Ammo prefix and a splitter attached to it absolutely ANNIHILATES most of the stuff you can find in the wild. If only it had a TS prefix as well, then I'd be the happiest person in existence. You can only imagine how good it is with an automatic receiver... No wonder they've removed it from the game.
---
Or .214 stone
---
Thanks for all the answers. So from what I understand is that the game is going to stay easy for 2ppl party except for some tougher bosses from time to time ?
---
Had one rare mask on him atleast, but definitely the pack as well, didn't keep inventory open long enough for me to scan through all his masks, but he had one on... by the time i was done being transfixed by the backpack i didn't have much time to check.
---
It is rude to kill Legendaries before they've had a chance to get a shot in, though.  For other things, I try not to, but I have to take my own survivability into account too.  I'm not going to stand there having my HP and AP whittled away by a Super Mutant with a Minigun just so you can get a hit in.
---
Cool cool. Thank you
---
I get that having a timer would help but I’m not making light of anything. Just because you don’t have a visual timer doesn’t mean the quest is broken, sit your impatient ass down and wait for that bitch, server hop and wait again. It’s not that hard and just because you haven’t had any patience doesn’t mean “nothing happens 10/10 times. Be patient.
---
Dont forget intellegence boosting chems net more xp
---
Just keep playing, there’s easier ways to get caps. Plus now you don’t need to fast travel everywhere anymore, vendors share a cap pool.
---
Oh okay. Damn well I want it now
---
I used mine to buzzsaw scorchbeasts pretty fast dunno.
---
Like BGS :3
---
Well that explains a lot
---
Any chance some of ya dataminer fellows could get good pictures/clearer pictures/better angles of some of the creatures for the wiki? or outright model rips (is that the right term?) if possible?
---
But where do I find a mega sloth in the Cranberry Bog? Other than the SBQ fight, that is...
---
I've tested the laser shotgun extensively... unless you have a crazy legendary pre-fix, its the same damage as any other laser weapon, just split into 5 beams. And if not all 5 are on target... good luck killing anything. Even if they are, good luck. 
---
Its useful for stockpiling FC's and mowing down low-level mobs on the west side of the map. But thats about it. It should feel awesome against high level creatures...but doesn't. Energy guns in general should be a late-game item that are high damage.
---
It wouldn't un-balance pvp, because there are so many perks/armors that are stupid-high energy resistant.
---
Same in a melee build and I just have a bunch of ammo
---
Just had constant really low fps, I play on an Xbox one s, seems to be fine now though 😊
---
I think ESO is not run by them.
---
Wait you can charge it with the sniper barrel?
---
Probably, butI think that's a fair ask. JMO
---
I got wolf fedora and t45 jet pack plans
---
I just finsished maxing out luck. So I havent figured out what kind of combat build yet
---
I just did this quest for the first time because it popped up on my screen,im level 125 and have a tse handmade and did not do many dm to this invissible thing and dead like 10 times,yes i did the pylons everytime i good..there were several other 100+level players and the quest failed,what is the strategy please???
---
Until we get a working nif editor (changes in the nif format with fo76 cause us not to be able to view/edit using the nif viewer) there isn't a lot that can be done. I'm going to message the developer of it to see if I can get a working version with the changed info
---
I went max charisma to be able to share 5 star perk card. However, Magnetic personality (charisma perk) grants you charisma for each teammate so I'm considering switching out a point of charisma for a different stat. (not sharing a perk unless you have at least one person teamed with you. Even with a lvl1 card +1 teammate you can rock a 14 charisma without issue)
---
9 charisma base + (lvl 2 card (+2 charisma per teammate) full team 3 = +6)= 15 total = ability to share 5 star card. 
---
You can only share one card at a time so it works out. It's something to definitely factor in. 
---
Assess the perk cards and determine which ones you want to keep up. The ones I find to be most handy to have up is Team medic, Field Surgeon, Philanthropist, Rad Sponge (situational, sometimes I run with bloodied builds), and Anti-Epidemic.
---
20 bucks says he listens to her lol😂😂 
---
Game? Or sex? Ya hell listen to her lolol
---
It’s Zenimax their parent company.
---
Yeah, Magnetic Personality works fine, but it's usually just my wife and me playing so it only gives a bonus of 1 Cha. She's trying to sell to vendors and make as much as she can, so we're trying the Hard Bargain sharing (her character has only 1 Cha). So she's been putting on Magnetic Personality, and I've been trying to share Hard Bargain. It's definitely been a bit of a challenge. I have to just sit there in my perk screen ready to re-share the card when it drops off while she sells and buys stuff.
---
It's not hard at all to hit the cap limit every day
---
The strategy is you kill it.
---
Then why can I only find ballistic fibers at the vendors?
---
The prime revolver plans, does that make it so I can change my weapons into prime weapons?
---
It's extremely annoying, plus with the cost of fast travelling it always means that you'll have a grand total of ~200 caps which is really aggravating when you realize the way you make new items is plans..
---
It's definitely not as stupid as the Rad storm one, or the ones involving events that seem to have been disabled for that day...
---
Think we can all agree the modded hunting rifle pales in comparison to the actual anti material rifle from NV

---
A really good guide on armor loadouts
---
Why do people want regular plans? Shouldnt you be using legendary armor?
---
Nope, fine for me. Actually getting less hitching and better FPS than last patch.
---
My x-01 with jet pack and calibrated shocks vanished from my inventory last night ;-(
---
Same. Maybe 3 or 4 hits and that's it. Most stuff does by then but still
---
This guy...wtf
---
This has been my observation as well.  My furious combat shotgun vs a level 90 deathclaw shows a ramp up of damage through about hit number 10.  Overall, I suspect the two shot (with a constant 25% increase?) works out better.  Depends on perk cards of course.
---
I know there are some likely spawns in the southwest woods of the mire, you can probably just lead one down to the cranberry bog
---
I support this. And I don't think they would be OP for PVP. A coordinated attack can take them down easily. Unless you're melee only...
---
But yeah, better turrets. Wall mounted laser/plasma turrets could be cool too. And skins for turrets. Like the shopping cart turret!
---
Is watoga vendor still "shopping mall vendor"?
---
But even then there's so efficent way to communicate with them, and if you post something about wanting to trade on Reddit, no one replies. So that's not very encouraging..
---
You can go back and forth
---
Don't argue with the bot
---
Same same... all armour's all mods.. my plans work top notch still..but the dang mods dont take... poopybum😔😔
---
There is the same server-wide message about the event starting as with scorched earth. Idk if it's timed or not
---
The doubt I have about something like this is that we already have Legendary effects for deflecting melee damage based on blocks, and I never use it because the timing is so dodgy due to latency.  I wish I could just hold down block and keep it up.
---
Yes my prefix is bloodied sorry I didn't say that. . I can get around 240 dmage low health and fire rate of 82... against ai energy weapons  don't seem that great but this in pvp destroys even with all the energy dmage buff. It's not hard to hit all five shots it's stupidly accurate. Especially since the beam has the equivalent of skeet skeet shooter 3 built in.
---
The .44 plan I have allows the person that uses it to make the .44 revolver primed, and also craft the ultracite .44 ammo. I do not know if this works with the Western Revolver that uses .44 ammo.
---
Generally i just relog and it comes back. It used to work to change your audio setting and still does but only for like 20 seconds then it cuts back out again.
---
In my experience so far I find that I come across more Legendaries if I don't fast travel everywhere. My CAMP is middle map so I pick a direction and go - and at lvl 205 they find me!
---
I usually switch to something that leaves the enemy with the tiniest sliver of health so the noobs can get xp still. If it's in a low level area like level 6 scorched i just wipe everything out and the noobs usually throw me a heart emote
---
Before all the vendor changes (actually about 3 months ago) we used Serums to calculate \~30%. We took serums from the base price of 5000 to a minimum of 3500. Was that changed with the vendor updates?
---
Yup seen this also
---
Took me only a combined hour or two when overencumbered. If you can fast travel around the ash heap and savage divide you can probably get to the point of the encryptid event in half an hour
---
I fell off the edge of a cliff whilst in build mode constructing my base, ironically I had only got out my power armor 2 minutes previous.
---
But then Shields would be the right thing to have, because you simply can Hold Right Click to Raise your shield.
---
Play survival mode. It’s really good to not be able to travel anywhere. It forces you to explore and the added chance to be killer anywhere changes the game. You don’t lose anything that you can’t get back in another loot run.
---
Xbox here if you give me the materials I'll gladly spice up your handmade with mods. I have almost all of em
---
Are you ok?
---
Yea, the game definitely needs to make all the super easy enemies a little more tricky to deal with and tone down a few of the absurdly strong ones.
---
That's fair.
---
I had just spent hours doing the quests leading up to this. There is no reason I need to wait an extra 3 hours to just complete the quest. You're reasoning is moot.
---
Yeah that sucks. I had mine in my ultracite armor in my inventory and placed it but it was invisible, not loading. Then server crashed, reloaded, no more power armor. Fun way to loose some good stuff
---
Came here looking for an answer to this too
---
Lead and aluminium
---
I’ll sell you all the mutations if you want them
---
Think I have a aa gatling. It'll be a bit before I can get on though
---
It's a bit of a dick move to blow up say the 3 star at the end of AWOL if there's others there before they get a shot in but aside from that... cant be waiting around all day while people pew pew pew with their underwhelming weapons.
---
Two Shot is inaccurate, but it is a constant 25%, yes.
---
I'm melee, so the thing about Furious is that there are only a handful of enemies that would actually survive long enough to see the effect (Scorchbeasts and the Mirelurk Queen).  You really don't notice it much in practice.
---
I’ve really disregarded a lot of posts about these issues selfishly really because now it’s happened to me I realise how damn right frustrating it is. The first thing I did when I got this game was power through to enclave and work on my x-01. I only just got the calibrated shocks recently and now every piece and the chassis is gone 😓
---
Why the fuck is "stealing shit is an act of PVP" so fucking controversial around here? What's wrong with you lot?
---
There'll be no water on earth before I put the single data on anything Wikia related.
---
Nah, you're flat out wrong there mate.
---
Yes..i noticed this as well
---
I'll give it a shot, thanks.
---
Yeah, most bulked items as non bulked dont sell for any value.
---
Mods need to start having current major issues like this on a sticky at the top to try to limit these.
---
I’d like to trade for this. Let me see what I have that you may want.
---
Since the last update my game crashes to desktop one or two times in a three to four hour session.  Haven't been able to pin point a common theme.  Same hardware and settings you have.  Don't know if the last update is the issue or just a coincidense.  Frustrating.
---
If they worked like that, sure!  Course, there's no reason why the current blocking system couldn't (and arguably should) work like that.
---
If you continue leveling they'll begin to drop more frequently - hang in there! I didn't get my first until lvl 75!
---
Plus the FONV rifle had a much more satisfying shot sound.
---
Constantly updated and evolving map, fingers on the pulse of today's events (up to date and fun emotes). These two would be great if they could be put into fallout.
---
Do you even Hard Bargain son?
---
Thank you I get nervous whenever I see the term beta.
---
Only .38, .308, 10mm, .45, .50, 5.56,and .44 are worth keeping, but really only .45, .50, and 5.56 are actually worth holding in the endgame.  Depending on your build of course
---
Lol that seems so convoluted to me 🤔
---
I have legendary, just want it deep pocketed as well.
---
That makes sense. I just wish they had mentioned it in the patch notes. I am glad that it’s at least working properly now.
---
Makes a double or quad version that much better
---
Bulk steel takes 30 Steel Scrap
---
Steel Scrap: 0.05 lbs

Bulk Steel: 1.5 lbs

fasnacht - how to do a multiplayer event....sheepsquatch - how not to do one
---
There was no connection to duping. Bulked junk only weighs less for lead and aluminum. Bulking is so you can sell to vendors. The junk you can't bulk sells to vendors without bulking, IIRC
---
Still better than getting pushed into a Fissure site while you're loaded up with scrap. 
---
Goodbye weeks of bulked goods.
---
That's all I used to get, wonder if something had changed?
---
Yeh, I have a same set purely because my OCD compels me to do so.
---
Even though I don't like the way BOS heavy arms look.
---
That said I've never seen Senitnel/Assassin heavy BOS left arm and leg. The right limbs I have hevay but never seen left limbs in heavy.
---
i really don't want any caps only because I'm not melee. if you can spare 2X bulk of adhesive that would be great.
---
Wrong series. Should be atom bless you
---
&gt;sillyoverwatchstuff
---
&gt;complaining an enemy is too hard
---
Checks out
---
I know man. I get pissed when that happens to me
---
Yeah, everything about it, proper chunky recoil and sound. Being able to clear entire groups with one explosive round was always a high point
---
Useful. Even better with marsupial and bird bones mutations.
---
I don't notice any problems? I'm 99.9% sure all jetpacks are the same.
---
I'm curious about the description of this, "which can dispense mixed drinks in your CAMP".  
---
I kinda hope for a new buff item, where an alcohol can last 30 min or something.
---
I named this account after my Tumblr, that's where the silliness comes from
---
And my man I'm talking about broken mechanics not difficulty
---
Pay for Convenience doesant really exist as a different entity from Pay To Win, since Pay to Win just means you can exchange real money for in game benefits, so maybe you see repairing your weapon on the go as convenient, ok fair enough it is, but I see buying experience from the atom shot as conveneint, cus why should I grind through low level to get to where I want to be? XP if free in the game so it doesnt give me an advantage?  
---
Maybe I should buy some legendary weapons because I could get them for free in the game anyway so its not like I have an advantage, its just convenient i dont have to grind for them.  
---
I should be able to pay for a free fast travel pass because I could walk there for free so I'm not gaining a benefit, its just convenient.
---
They've kicked around the idea of Survival Mode having "seasons" that would presumably require new characters.  One of the reasons it's a free-for-all right now is to test the worst case scenario of having all of these disparate levels in the same world together.
---
Maybe that's where all mine are going. I feel like I still hardly notice it working anyway.
---
You have to fire off those missiles and nukes. Don’t donate! You will miss out on the random explosions and destruction. You know for a fact that IRL if you found a missile launcher you would fire that up! Also- ammo weight perk cards ftw.
---
Why not? It's not like it's going to argue back.
---
lol this is a shitpost. So yes, you're the one that got whooshed.
---
Yeah that's awesome. I came across it before but couldn't find it again
---
I might have a few 3 stars in the stash, what are you looking for?
---
It really should have been fixed. I get falling into a Fissure might be an instant death like a nuke, but if you fall into an irrecoverable area loot drop should auto adjust, it's MMO standard for a long, long time.
---
100% agree. Im lvl 50 now and tried to launch a nuke for the first time the other day. The assaultrons i was fighting in the silo were only like lvl 24 and theyre face lasers dwindled my hp to nothing in mere seconds.
---
The imposter sheepsquatch has invulnerable periods and vulnerable periods. If it's visible, it's vulnerable. That's why you didn't get a tag in
---
It's not 'broken' it's a lifestyle ;)
---
I made the decision to play the game as a perpetually irradiated and mostly dead blooded/Unyielding, Sneaky Crit, Lever Action totin' granny. :)
---
My credibility aside, think about these: simple game mechanic, excellent 1st person immersion, you play &amp; group as you like without anyone looking over your shoulder, be able to launch a turd while still looking cool, free content for non subs game, are things that checked all boxes for me. Other games just try way too hard while requiring too much dedication from players.
---
Yes! I had one of those auto stim chest armour and I had to unequip it for that reason.
---
Hopefully
---
You can already sell ammo to other players. I’ve sold fusion cores myself.
---
Level 55 can be awkward.  Your character still isn't as strong as you had imagined.  You will continue to develope through and beyond level 100.  Focusing perk cards on a particular build can make non-legenday weapons devastating to all but the very highest level enemies.  On the other hand, spreading out perks for a generalized character can make a good legendary a mediocre weapon.
---
They added a skyrim DLC..u can fly on a dragon now
---
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE JIM!

You just have to be creative and stop acting like 30 lbs of cluelessness

30 lbs is 13.62 kg

I'm level 115 and didn't know about this bug. Did you get your account back? Did Bethesda ever fix this bug? Want to use my maps, but I'm concerned now. Thanks
---
It doesn't "charge" like normal, it just has a set amount of time you have to wait between shots for it to go to full power, something like 3 seconds. Otherwise, it does reduced damage. You can fire it as fast as you want, but it will be useless unless you wait.
---
Because then I wouldn't be able to life my camp for free.
---
that's what i do, i also leave thing like plans i already know.
---
ALWAYS CHECK SUIT CASES
---
yep, it uses a ridiculous amount. had some auto-stim armor equipped for about a week and now i’m down to 4 stims
---
“*Anime Style*”
---
Did you call the NV AMR an Anime Style Rifle lol?
---
Sorry meant to put bug
---
wut
---
The born survivor does the same killed stimpacks early game for me had to put a different perk in
---
That’s there updating style. They have a bigggggggg team fornite. Fallout 76 team... not so much.
---
So this is not what it looks like. It's an augmented assaultron. What is this a picture of then?
---
I gave up on things like this because sometimes, it's literally more efficient to die than to burn through your entire stash of Stimpacks.
---
Stop exaggerating.
---
People are still asking this? Move on. This game isn't going to be functional any time soon. It's the player's fault at this point for sticking around.
---
Also for the pipe revolver...  and while they are at it, they should beef up the 50 cal receiver for the hunting rifle.
---
I actually didn’t know you couldn’t do that. I’ve been saving .308 rounds for that exact reason.
---
Stash them. Pull out 1 per new server. Think I read this can work. If not, sorry, no clue.
---
I'll see what I got. Add me user name ECmadhawk
---
I'll try that, thanks
---
I actually did help with a few perk cards as the game came out! I felt like I was making a difference for some reason but looking back on it I think I only did the Serendipity perk card all the way lol.
---
Yes a stimpack will fire every time you go below 50% health with the medic pump, the only way to avoid it firing and preserve your regular stimpacks supply  is to hit yourself with a nuka cola or diluted stim before your health gets that low. It’s useful in SBQ and Sheepsquatch fights keeping you in the action for longer
---
Just get a mate to help you take it down then kill each other for the bounties. That way if you rack up a big bounty you can get your friend to give it back.
---
Player vending soon
---
Combat rifle is based off of the BAR it was originally a .308
---
I wouldn't like the idea of having to level and gear a new character every season. I'm definitely more in favor of having two separate characters one for PVE and one for PVP. We're PVP is true PVP including base raiding. But we'll see what they do I'm at least happy we have a PVP mode at all.
---
You'll have access to way higher damage weapons and perks at higher levels so it removes a lot of the bullet sponge factor. Only things that take me more than 3 power hits to kill would be scorch queen and the new miniboss
---
Honestly when I’m playing survival on my sentinel unarmed alt, I see power armor opponents as easy prey, almost a sure thing.
---
My main character was geared towards power armor and when I realized what a disparity there is I stopped playing him almost entirely.
---
My reasoning Is not moot, it’s not YOUR quest it’s an event. You have to have patience because it only show up every 3 hours. You are just impatient. God damn.
---
She sounds like she should be with my fella,luckily we don’t live together though. Don’t be talking to anyone or accepting any friend requests.  I just play when he’s not there. If he was that much of a good boyfriend then he’d be playing Fallout too and I wouldn’t have to team up with random strangers.
---
You don't have to be such a negative Nancy. I'm just trying to get attention to a common problem
---
Most things die very quickly, scorchbeasts take like 30 seconds, mirelurk queens take maybe 10, aside from that everything is much less spongy. Once in a while a cloaked assaultron is able to hide for a few seconds but they still go down quickly once you find them. Those are the most annoying ones off the top of my head.
---
What OP is suggesting is that the game be modified to check. Something the programmers can do. It would require that a server could be queried before loading in, somewhat like how a server is checked to see if it's Adventure or Survival.
---
Yea for real they promised sheepsquatch and we got a fucking assaultron? Super lame.
---
😆 I didn’t notice it was a bot lol
---
Those shady bastards...
---
I used to finish all dailies every day.  Then alcohol came along and I quit doing dailies.  Now I'm starting to do them again.  I think its a move (on Betheda's part) back to something I enjoy.  Glad to see it even if some tasks are difficult or impossible for me.
---
Oh they definitely argue back . I’ve been burned by a few
---
I would say the combat rifle is closer to a PPSH with BAR elements.
---
Same. I used to use my super sledge, but buzz works much faster
---
Oh cool. Thanks.
---
I don't think so (not entirely sure) but they spaqn every few days at the crashed space station in the upper right of toxic valley
---
Ps4? I have a furious explosive minigun I would trade for the right melee
---
I just killed a legendary starred goul and it despawned when it hit the ground lol sigh
---
Yeh just the other day, they roll out of their pods and drop dead. Went back later and alll was normal, as for Legendaries I do still see them, just rarer than it used to be. They still also blow up when downed, almost like they have a timer, that timer being as soon as you get close enough to loot.
---
can i use reshade while i have this mod?   
---
as it require a custom dxgi.dll, used for reshade too i think
---
Yeah, I'm not sure I can picture them actually doing this either after the recent patch relaxed the penalties in Survival mode.  At some point, you have to ask if the overarching goal is to have a hardcore deathmatch-style mode, or simply a more tense way to play the base game.  These changes were definitely a step in the latter direction, and if that's what they want, seasons would be necessary.
---
Yeah survival has gotten me back into the game. There's still lack of end game but at least now there's a reason to group up and enjoy some good combat and interactions.
---
A buggy one
---
Jumped in and died....(runs back to CAMP to get Hazmat suit...)
---
Speaking of guns, how about the K9000 cyberdog gun?  That was fun to have.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/K9000\_cyberdog\_gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/K9000_cyberdog_gun)
---
Shit.. sounds possible. " new VAULT TEC bobby pin. It,s blue. 10,000 Atoms please."
---
Hopefully each skin would actually retexture the entire lock picking interface  (lock, bobby pin, and screwdriver)
---
Not sure what the price should be though...
---
Oh, I know that. I was referring to the explosive gauss rifle not actually naturally spawning on legendary enemies anymore, due to Bethesda changing what guns can get the effect. Like energy weapons will no longer spawn with explosive, and I wasn't sure if the gauss falls in that category
---
Not the Greek letters though, O still exists floating in air and another letter
---
Assultron circut boards cost 2k? This cant be, I've scrapped dozens...
---
What mods do you run on it?
---
I think the watoga train vendor sells them. That where i bought my plans and the plans have always been there since. But i dont know if tbe vendor is different for other people
---
I fear that's what I've done, to be honest. I haven't fallen in love with any specific build, so I've generalized. Don't get me wrong, I'm still having tons of fun, and maybe it's a good thing to never feel too comfortable in any situation..keeps the tension up :)
---
..still, it'd be nice to have some TSE in the back pocket. Just for giggles :)
---
&gt;Compatibility  
---
This mod modifies the dxgi.dll file and will not be compatible with any other mod that does so.  
---
&gt;Game updates will require an update to the mod for continued functionality. 
---
That's from DXE. So, probably not
---
I'm a heavy gunner and I prefer to be right in her face, blasting with a TSE or AAE. 50 Cal. When she flies off I bring her back by blasting her with my AA 4 Barrel Targeting missile launcher, that thing never fails to aggro the SBQ. 
---
Right in the shit, blasting mobs to keep Adrenaline up and doing that damage. Never in the rear with the gear.
---
Dude its just a game lol
---
I think the LOS is only for the initial blast, afterwards it doesn't seem to care.  Circle strafing around them tends to work well.  But again, that is a melee build that I have.
---
Factually incorrect. In order to dupe, you need an original, unduped copy, thus disproving your "100% duped" claim
---
I’ve been to 4 or 5 and haven’t even done the quests yet. All this bitching , you better not go to anyone else’s or you will be the biggest hypocrite baby next to our king

ty
---
It’s a recall assaultron keycard under the misc tab at the vendors, with hard bargain 3 it’s about 1900
---
So you just lurk in comments about a game you dont play, thats normal.
---
So, I made one this morning, I'm getting ready to head into work, but I'll put some more work into it tonight.

No i did not get a gmail but i dont want to buy 76 again

Sentinel assassin builds are the absolute bane of anything remotely fair for PVP, you deserved to have been killed there.
---
It’s Bethesda, it’ll be 50 unless you buy the special atom edition one that gives you an extra +100!
---
Will I be banned for using this?
---
Close quarters with a fat man...
---
Enforcer, one shot to the face and no more laser.
---
Plus if you have ore or gunpowder, those can be heavy, and they arent stored since they are misc. Forgetting you are carrying 200 gunpowder can be fun. :)
---
there is no harden 50 call reciver for the hunting rifle and there are more than 2 50 cal recivers.
---
I don’t think you want it to be there if he’s anything like he is in the event😂
---
False. Facebook groups have been super useful to me and they provide me tips and coordinate selling. Just if you do, pick the right FB group for your platform, otherwise some of the groups are a shitfest of complaining and ragequitting from overlevelled beta pc users.
---
In my experience, it has a tendency to follow you around.  Not always, though.  Sometimes they just shoot straight ahead and that's all they do.
---
Sure is, but your issue doesn’t seem to be a bug.
---
Hi. My sister has the red asylum uniform and hat for sale if you're still looking.
---
I don’t know the answer to those questions but it will kill the travelling vendor bot that sells the rare outfits like the hunters longcoat, it will make it more difficult to milk a Brahmin and it will render your instigating weapons useless as enemies will not be full health by the time you are close enough to melee, I had plague walker and had to get rid of it to get the most out of my instigating fire axe.
---
you're the best - thanks!
---
Have you ever seen a PPSH, like ever?
---
What worked for me was, pull one out of your stash, drop it, grab it and if it doesn't trigger, change servers, drop again and it should trigger the event.
---
Alright great.
---
It’s lower damage because you can craft more rounds for cheaper
---
Tell that bitch to get back in the kitchen and make you a sammich, lol
---
I'll try it
---
Like I’m not trying to be rude but can you back up your statement with any examples?
---
Find a guy. I save all my unwanted to include in regular sales of the 5.56 I make. He’s helped me out while looking for some weapons I wanted.  If you’re on XB I can put you in touch with him.
---
How is only being able to respawn at a place very far from where I was and not loading in not a bug?
---
Doubt it but it would be awesome. I don’t really see them adding new guns as they can’t even get the balancing right with the guns they currently have in the game
---
a leaderboard doesn't need to be worldwide to be competitive. PVP is still competitive. However, pay to win is paying to have an advantage over another player, no matter how small. By definition, the repair kits are a MINOR pay to win mechanic. The issue is that it opens us up to more blatant and abusive pay to win mechanics.
---
8500 atoms plus an additional 300 caps in game for 5 song packs.
---
not if they lack the resources to repair it.
---
That's literally the only reason I keep Daisycutter in my inventory at all times. Find a mini nuke? Guess some lucky player will get to experience a "random nuke out of nowhere" when I fire that sucker high into the sky.
---
They're for doing the quest again after your initial run. You buy a recall card circuit board from any faction vendor for around 8k caps, give or take depending on your CHA, perks, grape mentats, whatever. Each vendor only has 1 card so there's a limit on how many you can buy.
---
You use the circuit board to craft an Assaultron Recall Keycard that you take to the shack with the pylons and activate the event. It can only be done every 3 hours per server or something though.
---
Card costs to re-run the Sheepsquatch event:  
---
3 x copper  
---
1 x recall keycard circuit board  
---
1 x rubber  
---
1 x stable fluorescent flux  
---
2 x steel

Tried to add some information to a few wikia pages but I'm not a native English speaker. Some of my edits received some nice comments with explanation how I could improve them while others were nothing more than slightly aggressive reactions by some wikia elitists.
---
Wouldn't make much sense lore-wise to have it, since that gun was more than likely crafted post-war in the Big MT by the Think Tank.
---
Sounds like a lot of damn work to go through just to provide my time to help lol. How much sense does that make? Im a simple person. Make this simple for me.
---
It’s fun acting as the mute NPC’s that Bethesda didn’t give us, showing lower leveled players around.
---
I see new players all the time. You complainers should move on and find another game

Tear them down.

Do you want your neighbor's eye stain of a house to lower your property value? I say no to that.

Guess I ran into a 24 carrot run of bad luck on this one didn't I?
---
Stash them, take one out at a time and that should work. If it doesn’t, put into a container and take it out again. It works for me most times. Usually I can only do one a day.
---
You were right, my hero!
---
Ah thanks, I will try it!
---
The phone app is much better. I just realized that this week when I updated it. The chat doesn’t load automatically if you’re in the message screen and it crashes at least once a day.
---
And add weapon mods to power armour that would be great
---
I would like to buy more plans that the vendors don't have. I don't need another barbed walking cane mod.
---
Always 1-4 rum in Blackwater mine and in the above ground area.
---
About a week before the whole Sheepsquatch quest line dropped I saw a world event for sheepsquatch horde. Naturally being excited for a new enemy type I joined it and it changed to a feral ghoul horde.
---
Twice I’ve been standing at the top of a large cliff and a mole-rat would show up out of nowhere and knock me off the cliff to my death.
---
I've seen them south of the Thunder Mountain workshop a few times, just north of the warehouse I can't remember the name of.
---
I have two characters now and my vats rifleman in survival has really revived my interest in the game. 100% with you on end game, hoping harpers ferry dungeon will add abit more to it.
---
The rifle stock matches the ppsh-41 exactly, the gas block also matches and the fact you can put on the ring sight which once again matches the gun. take off the barrel heatshield and add a wonderment grip and it will be similar to posh, you can’t say it doesn’t have that guns design in it.
---
So it’s impossible to build floating camps now? That’s a bummer, i was just thinking about building one with stacked foundations.
---
Can you?
---
You mad bro? This game is dead already and there is nothing you can do about it. Your fanatism is only amusing. Game won't become any better by closing eyes and ears and trying to down vote truth. Eventually you will understand what I mean, but it takes some time for you.
---
Ya. Then if someone is using it at either place it just says "busy".
---
I don't really want to travel all around the map if I only have a short play session. If I have more time I wouldn't mind. 
---
I wonder if fast travel will be free to player camps
---
Did you complete them on an alt?
---
I think it's fine the way it is. 
---
Me and a group completed it twice last night back to back. 
---
Yall just need teamwork...
---
Alt update:  I have a lvl 80 character that I had stripped bare that seemed a good candidate to try this with. I started on Friday evening. He was in underwear with only Last Bastion Urban Scout Chest armor on in Morgantown when I spawned.  No caps, no weapons, no chems.  As of last night, he has 4,200 caps, a full set of Urban Scout armor (I like how it looks), a full set of lvl 50 T60 PA (I have the Motion Assist mod too but can't attach it), a TSE LMG (a true drop in Whitespring!, I almost fainted!, first TSE ever to drop for me, from a Legendary Wendigo at the Clubhouse), a 2\* Super Sledge with SS plus something, a bloodied switchblade (sold to a player for 2k caps), a 3\* Deathclaw Gauntlet with SS and other stuff I can't recall (kills EVERYTHING, I have the extra claw mod but can't attach it), and more chems than you can imagine.  I bought the Scout armor as I could afford it.  I farmed the T-60 in Watoga. I bought the Super Sledge from one of the Bot vendors in Watoga.  No Player vendor purchases.  No visits to player vendor stores.  No Reddit items.  It's all just what the game will give you.  I am quite shocked. If you hear of anyone who says they've run out of supplies and want to quit, show them this.  I can show them how I did it. I ain't that good but I'm persistent.
---
I think the game really needs a new game + type thing for end game characters to go back over the good content. Maybe nuclear winter will be something like that. 
---
These little content patches are nice but way to short term.
---
I hope they keep the workshops the way it is right now since they ruined the pvp server but that’s just my opinion.
---
Not to be an ass or anything, but how come you didn't go to a weapon's workbench and repair your guns?
---
A buddy I play with has lost a 3 star anti armor explosive lever action and a 3 star anti armor explosive handmade, and yea this was post-dupe wipe
---
No. Just no. Everyone wants this to be a buddy-buddy game, it's not. Finding those moments is supposed to mean something in the apocalypse.
---
Server hop if enemies are too high level (from other players) and eventually you can spawn them at your lower level.
---
Thanks for the laugh. You are the most delusional person I have ever had the misfortune to come across. Please shut the hell up and get if this sub Reddit, no one cares/wants your negative opinion
---
Yeah i know that. But since we have pvp only server. Why not do that in there?
---
Hey, have any idea where I can find a megasloth in the cranberry bog?
---
Can you point me to some examples of this?
---
Both mine were anti armor, hmmm
---
ooh never knew that thats a nice tip thx!
---
Find a lot here, abandoned waste dump will also have plans or mods regularly with the occasional legendary
---
There where underground nukes pre-war, maybe these are points where they were to close to the surface or time has exposed them?
---
If you server hop at harpers ferry 3 times and have hard bargain when you go to sell, you should clear half the vendor from *rifles alone* if you clear each time.
---
Though I see your point I kinda like having that small bit of pvp in adventure. It's the only time I feel that people are roleplaying as raiders(I typically build them for community use but love the aspect that I may have to fight iff a raider). But maybe make it so if the pvp attacker loses they have to spawn at camp or 76 to avoid spam attacking .
---
That's my 2 cents!
---
Jumping off a cliff that wasn't high enough to kill me, but forgetting I had Marsupial which gave it juuuust enough height to kill me on impact
---
Assultrons please!
---
I have seen this twice.  Once was just eyebots, the other was eyebots, protectrons, and protectrons on treads.  It kinda freaked me out.  They weren't tough or anything, just seemed out of place.
---
So you are saying you shouldn’t be able to buy mats with caps either? Both are in game currencies and you get atoms for free
---
If you search around you will find answers going from 30% to 50% with no sources of anyone actually documenting proof. It’s hard to tell.
---
It is just opinion to discuss about. Feel free.
---
Don’t condone the cheating, but I feel like even my friends who aren’t banned from fallout don’t know new content is coming because they’re playing other games.
---
And gunpowder
---
huh i wonder why they did it that way well...
---
well i guess it make makes sense going from really sharp weapons to dull as u use it
---
http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Fallout_4
---
Have a look through here, I’m not saying it isn’t a bar but it does have ppsh-41 elements on it. I’m not the only one. If you search into google what they are based on once a again it will say it is a gun with elements of PPSH and a BAR
---
Still lagging horrible for me since Patch 8. Bethesda can you hear us!? Im on PS4.
---
Would love to see the return of centaurs tbh mutant hounds never really cut it for me
---
Crafting at my camp going down a cliff side and falling 100ft to my death multiple times lol
---
Also, another issue is that if you have perks like bandolier or batteries included which reduce ammo weight, any ammo put in your stash returns to normal weight. This was messing with me for a bit with my fusion cores
---
The game has been miserable for me since the hot fix
---
Oh, I'm not defending them. Destroy them for all I care. I just found it interesting how I've seen posts getting more downvotes by (for example) criticizing the game mechanic that allowed some high-level player decked out in 3 star legendary gear and some TSE/BE weapon, to destroy random camps for no reason, and then spawn-camp the owner when they return to hopelessly try to save it. I've seen posts like that get multiple upvoted comments mocking the OP and calling them a whiner. Yet these almost unanimously get upvotes with little to no criticism (deserved or otherwise).
---
Coincidentally, I saw my second one of these last night after I made that post, albeit not in a nuke zone. If it was made to kill all the ghouls so no one else could, it was utterly ineffectual. I still was able to wipe out the dozens of charred and the glowing wendigo, got three glorious one-star legendaries including a nocturnal pitchfork. Worst part once again was the annoying sound of turret fire.
---
Regarding where to get legendaries, all of Whitespring even beyond the golf club has a pretty good number of legendary enemies, particularly when nuked. But for the past 3 or so months I don't think I've found a single useful legendary while farming there. Typically one-star items of limited functionality. There have been several posts detailing legendary farming locations and quests better than I can, but my personal rounds are uranium fever, monster mash, SBQ, Watoga, thunder mountain substation, cranberry bog horde, sometimes WestTek. None of these have swaths of 10+ legendaries, but I've had much more success getting useful two and three-star items from them.
---
Or buy with atoms. I haven't heard either way, but the way things are going...

I know, I've done some smooth runs myself but I've done a lot where everyone is running around like headless chickens, ignoring the pylons and trying to kill an invincible enemy. This post was just a joke at those kind of idiot's expence 😉
---
Bloody Mess in the luck tree helps
---
Would you take caps?
---
If not, some things I have for trade are:
---
3* Assassin/Sentinel Trapper Left Arm with +1 End Level 45
---
3* Unyielding Metal Right Leg with Reduce weapon weights 20% Level 50
---
TSE Black Power Pistol Level 40
---
White Responder Foreman Helmet 
---
Responder Fireman Uniform 
---
Traveling Leather Coat

Dude if you're on xbox, you can go to the game hub and look, people are always posting shit up. I'm not sure if it's also on ps4 or pc.
---
I wish this was true. Had an unending load screen on the encrypted event yesterday. After killing the client and going back in: different server.
---
i only use 45 cal, nothing else. im just such a slut for lever action rifles :(
---
How about that idea: Replace all players with Npcs and with that end all player interactions for good. Of Course only in Singleplayer Mode \*cough\* meant Adventure Mode.
---
Drives me crazy when I try to make a room and the last wall refuses to face the correct direction nomatter what. :(
---
Bloody mess and tenderizer help loads.
---
Wow I didn’t even think about this thanks man
---
Nobody uses power armors for pvp, there’s zero legendary effects for them while Bethesda stacks three effects for normal armors and make the wearer unkillable to many. They don’t want people to use power armor period. Get yourself a set of duped sentinel assassin and remember to stand very still, you’re good to go.
---
If other players have been there, the enemies will spawn at whatever level those enemies were at before. The southern area and the top right Mire seem to hold the most dangerous enemies. I say this cause my neighbor is a Behemoth that sits in a pond lol
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
It's based on your location. The wotaga side is where all the harder enemies are at. If you're in flat woods enemies are around lvl 1-5 etc
---
Stop spreading your biased propaganda . I have 4000+ atoms and haven’t paid rl money for 1 of them . Can you buy them with rl money? Yes but unless you want everything in the store you really don’t have to
---
Np
---
I like this
---
So it has a wooden stock and a square back. Cool, I guess the federov is a ppsh too, and the Thompson, and to a certain extent the garand and the M14
---
yeah you're the only person in history who has experienced lag in an online game desipite it being the very nature of the beast
---
Definitely hit up Whitesprings. I don't know what level you are, but farming the ghouls and the occasional random legendary there will quickly allow you to gain xp, find drugs to sell, find good junk, and perhaps even a decent piece of armor or weaponry
---
r/Market76

I believe it just stacks on total ER from armor

Darker than black gemini of the meteor has a chick who pulls a PTRD-41 out of hammerspace so i guess "anime style rifle" stands :P
---
Ok but how?
---
I take workshops all the time, and not for PVP.  I also defend workshops all the time, not for PVP but for the caps, xp,and loot.  I defend others’ shops often too, even when they aren’t there (or perhaps they are hiding).  If the creatures are higher level I will even repair their defenses.
---
With that said, I have no problems with the current system; it adds an element of risk. 😉👍
---
I like your style
---
Yes. Seems worse since this last patch. 
---
On xbox I also get buzzing crashes sometimes where the audio goes "buzzzzzzz" for a little while and then the entire application closes. Seems more often on loading screens, but sometimes also when doing things with my inventory.
---
They are very common
---
Isn't the Atom store version usually worse than the in-game version? Did they change their mo?
---
You totally can do it all the content in a hour without issue.
---
The issue will be doing the actual event, since it has a 3 hour cooldown, if the server your on has run it recently you won’t be able to start it. If this happens you can server-hop to find one that hasn’t run it, this is where your time will come in.  
---
The terminal in the cabin will say something about needing to recharge if it’s run recently.  If you have a group you can probably disband, all serverhop and when one of you see a different message all reassemble and go.
---
Challenges are account wide.
---
I've seen a couple just east of watoga around the train pylons
---
Yeah they weren't hard to kill, but they were high level.
---
It's worth it for sneak attack bonus perk though if you play that way
---
The Jet’ll make ya jittery.
---
Why are you lumbering around over encumbered near a fissure? Always be prepared to die
---
Same. All of them seem to have mostly imported info from Fallout 4. At the moment I think the game is still changing and being balanced too much for any wiki to stay reasonably updated, yet alone finding the right info between like four of them. That, and lots of items are just random spawns.
---
You died. If you haven't changed your respawn point you spawn where we all start. Same in every single survival game that has been released the last 4years.
---
Most of the items you need are next or at the Whitespring
---
I also tried to learn a plan from the sheepsquatch here event last night and it told me I learned the plan to craft the imposter sheepsquatch helmet, but when I rushed to my crafting bench it was not there.
---
Well if you would like to check the link I posted it will break down the gun to show the elements that is used to create the rifle. It clearly has PPSH elements mixed into the gun
---
Just happen to me on my PC, expect now i have to reinstall the game :(
---
I didn’t know the Hulk was in the game...?
---
I dont think your understanding.. im rubber banding every 10-15 secs. Did not happen till patch 8. The game went from silky smooth to completely unplayable. I may be using the term “lag” improperly.
---
How did you manage to set them all up without the first one returning to inventory before getting the last out of it?
---
Good Question!
---
Huh. Never thought about it that way
---
Because it needs to load the world to see if the cell is already occupied.
---
/r/titlegore

You should also check the aid tab.

Why on earth would you carry weeks worth of scrap into an event?
---
I stay away from all them Chems...
---
even that dang nukashine... seen some people gone mad.
---
Wasn't overweight. 
---
Between perks and gear, your backpack storage is far more efficient than your stash box of holding. 
---
When you live by the excavator armor, you die by the excavator armor.
---
Wait a minute, the bots all became neutral to you after completing the quest? That didn't happen for me. I really expected it to because you know, that makes sense. But it didn't, and they are still hostile for me
---
@valseek
---
&gt;Yeah i know that. But since we have pvp only server. Why not do that in there?
---
Because griefers don't want to be in a server where everyone is exactly like them.
---
You know what, the responses here have enlightened me. I think I'm gonna drop melee for a bit and move back to heavy weapons, just like when I was lvl 50 to spice things up.
---
I agree with you on the PPSH, I was asking the other guy to back it up with examples.
---
I'm going to look now, thanks
---
99.9999999% sure they were dudes...lol
---
I have always wanted this!
---
I got fast enough throughout collecting that I had just enough time to take the one picture. I took about 3 of only 49 because the first would pick up
---
Do they attack you on sight anymore?
---
I have 6/10 been that way for about 2 months now....
---
Perhaps, but it works.
---
Because of my stupidity/lack of resources. It just was not a good idea to go in there to begin with 😂
---
I pointed this out in the past and got down voted into oblivion. Pretty fair trade IMHO.
---
Absolutely, its still worth it, just wanted to point that out for posterity's sake!
---
Nope, that was ALWAYS a misconecption since beta. Only 3 things about bulking are lead and aluminum weigh less, and acid USED to dupe by bulking (you bulked acid with 10 and could dismantle it for 15 acid).
---
Atleast with the TSE you should be getting explosive damage from both bullets at the very least even if the ballistic bonus is messed up for some reason. Do you have demo expert maxed?
---
Mine happened twice yesterday over a few hour period.  I rebooted and didn’t have the issue again. Played about 4 hours after that no prob
---
Fallout.wikia.com has it covered
---
Buying or selling works
---
Bethesda’s greed? Gotta be blind to not have noticed that
---
I agree with playing spotify in the background as others have said, but at the same time, playing tapes and having music going since it wont auto pause is slightly anoyying.
---
Over on ps4 I haven't seen her killed since the two shot / explosive nerf.
---
I managed to fix it. There was a fallout76custom.ini.bak which was still being read despite the .Bak extension. Cheers.
---
Reboot pc and your router.   Works every time for me.
---
They were nerfed heavily many patches ago, instead of doing 200% damage they now do about 120% so it’s not much different than single shot but the accuracy is much worse. Thank you dupers.
---
It's an upcoming atom shop item, hopefully you'll be able to use it when it releases lol
---
My base damage with any rifle is 146. (lvl 50 hunting or 35 lever action)
---
I don't have any explosive rifles so i don't know exactly how much extra damage you get from the explosive effect, but to me it seems a bit low if it's just 7 more points of damage.
---
Anyway, as a rifleman there's no need to chase bigger numbers. 146 base damage+ headshots+adrenaline makes it so you can one-shot any basic mob.
---
If you do want more damage bloodied+adrenal reaction+headshot+vats crit+adrenaline+bloody mess+sneak+anti tank+chems should give you some stupidly high damage numbers but as i said before, there's no point in doing that. It's overkill.
---
I don’t think that’s the case anymore. 10 items weigh the same as 1 bulk.
---
Same here. I was hesitant on day one after the reviews came in, but said “fuck it, I’ll form my own opinion” on day 2. Currently 650+ hrs in. It’s blown my mind how much I love this game. And for very non-traditional reasons. On paper, I get the hate. But it’s more than the sum of its parts combined. The joys of this game (for me personally) didn’t fully surface until about 100 hours in or so. Not saying it was bad before that, just bewildering with all the issues. But navigating within the boundaries of this new type of experience, I’ve learned to love it. Now I just play to see what random things are gonna happen today. Not to min/max. Not for end game boss fights. But just interacting with others, building up a legit shop, helping new players along the way, giving away cool stuff, etc. it’s just fun living in post apocalyptic Appalachia. Probably not for everyone, but I feel if you love fallout, you should definitely give this a try with no expectations up from. Just explore.
---
Watch the map and other players who are around locations you are going to. If you see 100 +/- players around or near a location chances are high enemy will be higher. 
---
Stay low and use vats to see if their high and you’re alone switch servers or come back later.
---
They still have a red mame/health bar but will not attack you.
---
The imposter sheepsquatch helmet is already a drop from the event.
---
The patch notes specifically state "Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod". Of course, the patch notes are untrustworthy (Tesla?), but I'd expect the gauss rifle to fall into the "weapons that fire bullets" category.
---
Sniping stability mods for arms. 
---
There's really no good mod for PA arms at the moment.
---
I'll do you one better, forgetting to turn on pain train and running down mall hallway in power armor.
---
It is not timed, it starts immediately, and if you waste any time getting ready you will miss it.
---
Bruh go outside you’ve been on reddit to much and don’t even play the game
---
Put in a support ticket in last week. No response yet. Going to call customer support in a couple of days. Figured id give them a week to respond. Ill let you know what they say
---
Dude there’s literally no way they killed it instantly. You have to activate the 3 different pylons and go through the phases of vulnerability and invulnerability. There’s no way that a couple of 100’s could kill it instantly because even with 15+ players all in separate squads together but all in an Xbox party we still were dying left and right and still ended up failing in the end.
---
Same, they feel like a lazy design. Just an FEV dog.
---
Building a trap base and trapped myself
---
Luckily high schools exist with tons of plastic. Bulk the junk you don’t need to build with currently and sell it.
---
Yeah I went looking around for a while couldnt find any and was going by a location I'd explored before and noticed a shed I forgot to check out. Boom power armor frame and 3 peices of T 45
---
Cards or armor say 40% health and others say below 20% health or something like that... I know what you mean,,, went through a ton of them that way!
---
I think your right, but ppl dont like to door opening  to pay to win which is how ppl see the repair kits.
---
Outside of the stretch where they grossly overestimated how much beer people could craft or drink the dailies have almost ALWAYS been reasonable.  
---
It's only been in like the past five days that the rad storm crap popped up and people freaked the fuck out that Bethesda's master plan to deprive them of 10 atoms a day was going to destroy the game.
---
The real best armor is heavy metal armor, as the vast majority of enemies deal physical damage. The full set of armor gives about 80 ER, which is plenty of protection. The only dangerous energy attacks are the assultron laser and the wall mounted level 40 laser turret.
---
oh, sorry! I’m using my mobile so it’s hard to keep track with what people are saying. But back onto topic I would like more receivers and did like the fact the combat rifle could be rechambered to suit your needs. It was quite a modular weapon.
---
Thus far, items in the Atom Shop have only been for aesthetic purposes. No item has given players any benefit while playing the game. At most they will release skins for the backpacks in the shop but they won't change the effect.
---
Fully perking a weapon class (all 9 points) is a commitment but it pays off in damage output.  Then Bloody Mess in luck for 15% extra damage and Adrenaline in agility.  With adrenaline you may have to adjust your play style - kill all enemies quickly, then go back and loot, but the extra damage as you go is addictive.
---
-strength, crit damage + , perception +
---
Seeing as you can have a snallygaster with wasteland whisperer I think it would be the same for a centaur. As both are just rogue FEV mutations.
---
I've seen like 3 recent posts claiming steel gets a reduction from bulking, it doesn't now, it never did. It's lead and aluminum.
---
3 comments in 3 hours if this post doesn't get any traction I'll be the first to keep this idea alive. Pls Beth I have a camp that's built on stairs( the single beam ones ) and I'd love to place some turrets underneath.
---
Awesome!
---
I don’t see how your description is anything but explaining how its bugged?
---
lol @ pc gamers ruining things for everyone and then complaining when it happens to them.
---
Also had an AWOL armament with 3 or 4 additional 3 stars. Monster mash is also been insanely lucrative, 7 3-stars and 2 2-stars in 2 attempts
---
Thanks
---
if you don’t see it trigger after pull one out of stash, check your misc quests.  Mine was there and active but unselected.   I selected and it showed up on the map.
---
Okay, well, the only real way to find out in the game is to get lucky enough to get one to spawn, if they can spawn lol
---
Because many of us have been foolishly hoarding legendaries hoping that the upcoming token system makes it worthwhile.
---
Even with all perks, you're better off storing weapons and armor and keeping junk on your personal storage if you still want to be able to fast travel. 
---
Outside of two very rare events, server crash during the precise moment between death and loot collection and the topic of the conversation, fissure fall, there's very little reason not to be recollection is incredibly simple and in most situations easy. 
---
That's the reason I assume this is actually an oversight and not intentional and should be fixed because in any other death scenario they still let you retrieve lost goods, even taking a nuke to the face.
---
Actually the helmet its self is already a drop, I have one.
---
In a mildly large write up I did on STASH management I copy/paste around to people having issues, one of the steps reads as:
---
&gt; If you don't use the weapons dump, Missles, Mini Nukes, .50 Cal Balls, Cannonballs, Harpoons, Crossbow Bolts, Flares, Railway Spikes, Plasma Cores, 40mm Grenades, 2mm EC, Gamma Rounds, Cryolator, Flamer Fuel, and Paddle Ball String. You can find/craft more in the future if you need  it, even that smaller size ammo is 1lb per 100. 
---
I do this daily and leave the ammo in Whitesprings. The non-regular ammo is pretty heavy comparatively.
---
How about 160+ Plasma Cores and 600+ Plasma ammo.
---
Donated it to Whitesprings cash machine.
---
What level are you? I can make you some deep pocketed leather if you need it, combat after 20. Also a BOS 308 sniper rifle depends on lvl but all are game changers starting out.
---
Follow the quest missions from the start, bulk everything and plastic and adhesive are your bff’s...lol
---
Learn to READ.
---
You're not SEEING legendary enemies because something broke and a bunch of them are not getting LABELED as legendary.  They're still there, your lazy ass is just quickly scanning the crowds and not seeing them and moving on.
---
I regularly farm Watoga EMS and one shot the random super mutants, ghouls and scorched on the way to the boss to pick up ammo and chems and regularly an otherwise normal and unlabeled enemy will drop a legendary.
---
You cant change your respawn point? It gives you one nearest to you what are you on about
---
What location was this at? I could use those armor pieces
---
I thought you couldn’t sell ammo or am i just dumb
---
We really need some LAER's up in this bitch, a la fallout new Vegas.
---
Haha you gotta get closer to get the full render dude !
---
"THIS ONLINE GAME IS ALL ABOUT ME! IT CAN'T BE AN EVENT! &gt;:("
---
As you explore you’ll find power armor stations all over, and I think most of them have a chance to have a frame and pieces
---
I support this! I don't want my turrets on the ground but I don't want to have to build platforms everywhere for them.
---
They probably would need to rewrite large chunks of code, which is a waste of time.
---
And here we have 5 comments going “yes yes the game is broken” but no discussion, not talking to each other just all screaming. No post either just some douche putting his whole post in the title.... again
---
Haha, I’m not sure what to tell ya. It’s definitely a passion project. I’m the #1 editor and an admin on the wiki for a different video game, and I probably put a FT job’s worth of time and effort into building it up last year. The guy who did our videos spent a lot of time working with editors to write scripts and fact check info, plus recording, editing, and practicing the videos for pacing/timing. The Fallout wiki (Nukapedia) in particular had a lot of drama when Fandom first introduced the video program because the admins were not happy with the video content that Fandom chose to feature. I’m not really sure where they stand on it now.
---
Then prove it halfwit.  If you're going to jump up and say "But there is proof!" you actually have to PROVIDE THAT PROOF.  Of all the unofficial patch notes that have gone up after a patch bring us even ONE that shows bethesda manipulating the legendary spawn rate.
---
Apparently the vendor bots in the game learned how to trade while watching reruns of Pawn Stars.
---
Yes, it’s a 308 straight bottom box mag with the same receiver as the bar, and I believe the same bottom mounted gas blowback tube.
---
Hmmm, not sure if I should suggest that they should nerf 50 cal production and up the damage given that IRL a 50 cal round is 2x the size of a 308 or just keep my mouth shut since I do all my sniping with a gauss rifle anyway...
---
I agree, but everybody's replies make sense. Apparently I'm in a really popular spot now; sometimes I have to load 2 or 3 times before I get somewhere I can place it.
---
You need help...
---
Same, my body just lay there until the event ultimately fails. Then it suddenly allows me to respawn. This event is super broken, even for end game. Lack of time, instruction and preparedness. At least with SBQ you get a 3 minute heads up before it starts, and then 30 minutes to kill the bitch. 10 minutes from start to finish isn’t enough for an event that requires as many people on the server to participate as possible. 
---
There isn’t even anytime to get to the event. I see the warning, run to my camp to drop off junk. Then spawn in with 2 minutes left and no pylons activated. It’s a mess
---
I’m short this one too.... at 658 hours as of right now.  I’m 99% sure this is bugged on PS4, perhaps elsewhere.
---
I would like to buy a Marine Armor Helmet.
---
maybe that's where gung Fu comes in as well.. I DO need to take a break farming for screws and take a good long look at my perks..thanks for the advice! :)
---
After looking over the Lewis gun a bit, I’d say that nothing really changes.
---
The changes I suggest aim to make the weapon more for covering fire and raw damage, that benefits from taking the slow and sturdy road.
---
I believe something like the R-91, rangefinder (throwback), and Chinese could adopt some characteristics and drop some others of the two guns here, but the AK be the cheap low point with low power and high mobility, and the Assault Rifle be the high power high cost weapon, with low mobility.
---
Those other guns and the combat rifle should be middle grounds, being the best at different categories, like the R-91 could have damage a bit higher than the handmade, or perhaps the ar is auto only and the other guns are either just semi or both.
---
I'm nowhere near prepared for this boss but that sounds hella frustrating! I hope they fix it soon.
---
Why are people downloading such a valid serious exploit. This sub baffles me sometimes
---
Gary!!!! Heyyyyy buddy!!!! *brandishes sword*
---
You're not wrong! Also, with level 5 gunsmith and weapon artisan... unless you're a commando burning through ammo... your gun isn't going to randomly break. 
---
Now if they lowered weapon conditions across the board at the same time... I hope  they're not that stupid.
---
I didn't happen when the event first came out but has been happening more and more recently
---
The register next to the vendor bot. Always check them (and suitcases) at train stations.
---
So I was doing Powering Up Poseidon and did all the optional quest. After powering up I am really glad it's over so I exit the Poseidon Power Plant
---
I exit in the cooling Plant that I didn't know I was dying inside the cooling plant. Lost those well earned junks in the deep water of that Cooling Plant
---
Hard to say without knowing how the current code is structured. Definitely not a waste of time though as people want the feature and there are other things you could do with server queries.
---
I also have just the 2 characters. I expect them to let us keep moving them for normal survival even after beta. I know seasons are coming and I like the idea of having a new character to mess around with for just a few weeks as long as there’s some kind of progession for it. I would like to see a “hardcore” survival for those who want a more rust/ark like experience. Something with persistence for large base raids
---
Yes Bethesda is greedy, but direct upgrades in a game that make a quick buck aren’t in this game. 
---
An argument could be made for the weapon repair kits, but those aren’t an upgrade.
---
I’ll check it out
---
Just another Stacy keeping the gamer oppressed
---
I asked for examples specific to your point. I’ll take that as you don’t have any.
---
I do not know the Heavy laser/plasma are still shit better by a lot but still shit.
---
.50 cal mg tho? What happens to them?
---
Happens to me too even if my camp is in the middle of nowhere
---
Lol get a mule and dont carry bulked junk. It's so funny to see ppl lose all their junk cause they ain't planning or thinkin
---
I was taking a picture of myself sitting on a couch beside a skeleton while my friend was around the area looting. Right as I take the photo, my friend yells "oh fuck!" and fires off a few shots. There were super mutants that we had not seen. We were both low levels (under 20) and out of our element. As I stood up, I saw a rocket super sledge being whipped at me and then I died.
---
On the bright side, I have a neat photo of myself in which I am on fire while just chilling.
---
He said virtually smash!

Trade with players who almost always shoot you on sight? Nah. I’ll brown-bag it.

---
I have a 2 shot radium rifle. It’s really bad but I love the sound it makes when it fires lol
---
Thanks :)
---
I dress up in the cowboy duster/hat with a lever action and a flare gun. Any time I see someone's workshop under attack or an event in progress I fast travel over to help and shoot up a flare. The waste Virginia responders are here!
---
You and your group is the key statement there. Im play solo usually but when i join this event i turn my mic on and try to help people understand how to win it. Yet as a level 60s player im usually the one being conduit supreme because everyone else is too braindead to be a conduit and stay alive. Try joining the event 1 time with randos and tell me how your experience differs.
---
I'm not sure if that's better or worse....
---
For me they should just switch the .50 cal and .308 when it comes to crafting and then make the .50 cal LMG a .308 LMG (They do exist in real life anyway).
---
God damn man, I'm on xbox so Idk but I dont think anythings different between the consoles. Maybe Im just hella lucky to be paired with op players.

---
Dammit, having the same issue.  I got a 3* sledgehammer and I'm trying to attach a heavy searing sharp rocket and it won't work.
---
Yes another reason for me to keep quiet about it... although, would you trade higher production cost for a big damage buff on the 50 mg?
---
And the Gauss Rifle is the PKM...
---
Agreed. 
---
I’d love to see the assault rifle have semi auto when standing or auto if modded. And when crouched go full auto.
---
Awesome news!
---
Deal. IGN Sgt\_OKeefe
---
Oh it is different.  I agree.  But I don't want bgs to change the difficulty because no one can play together for once.
---
I think the “safe” zone is significantly larger than our actual CAMP space. There may have been one nearby you just didn’t see. 
---
It’s also possible that when it picked the server there was someone in the spot but they logged off as you were logging in. That’s more likely than it sounds as servers are usually full, so chances are, if you’re logging in it’s right as someone else is leaving.
---
Buy them in the Atom shop...
---
I read that they will be soon adding a function to decorate your camp with any junk in your stash. I'm assuming that decorations wouldn't be able to be looted by random people moving through your camp. Once that system is implemented, power armor display should follow quickly if its not included with it.
---
The ReShade API is fully ABI-compatible with d3d9.dll and mostly-compatible with d3d11.dll. You should be able to rename your ReShade dll to d3d9.dll without any issues.
---
Aye, I could do that.
---
Yep did the same
---
Various zones have differnt level caps, though once you get to the 35+ areas, that cap no longer exists, pretty much. 
---
This might help though: [https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc](https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc)
---
Yeah I have been confused about the communication mechanics. I have a mic but rarely find other people that have them, normally everyone just jumps in circles.
---
Yet. Repair kits are starting down a path none of us wants. The downvotes for me and other dude are some fanboy ass shit. We’re allowed to have our opinion that Bethesda has gotten greedy as fuck, your entitled to the opinion they are not. How anyone arrives at that after fo76 and es blades I don’t know
---
Keep dreaming dude. The fanatics are hurt most when truth comes out. Hope you can handle it when this game has only few players left.
---
I figured the fast clears were pre made groups or something.  From what I've seen if it doesn't die fast it gets flooded with low dps players.
---
I have pretty much accepted that vendor bots operate by GameStop rules lol
---
Yeah the magazine, gas blowback etc scream bar and the rifle does handle like a bar I just think aesthetically it is a PPSH. I think the rounded top tube receiver matches a PPSH rather the flat/raised sight of the bar. 
---
I now get what you mean by it not being fast firing and chew through enemies as fast as your ammo reserve though.
---
I noticed this on crash once yesterday, but logout and back in normally usually gave me a different server.
---
Currently have 500 caps ready.
---
K, few mins. Walking my doggo
---
Because jumping the gun is cool!
---
I’m level 81 on XB1.  I have yet to find anything other than a 2 star ts.   My friend gave me a bloody 3 star combat rifle.   (She’s more melee).   All  I seem to get are weird armor drops.  Robot , and wood limbs.   Anything else I have, I’ve purchased in white springs.
---
The problem is that .50 cal ammo is so damned weak in this game.  If they added it they'd have to bump up every other gun that uses it.  Which they should, honestly.
---
Well i would be for it but you're BoS and as NCR..................oh wait we don't exist at this point of time.................carry on.
---
Which is exactly what Bethesda hoped would happen when they chose to leave human NPCs out. Of course some people run around and are completely annoying instead, but most of my interactions with other players have been enjoyable. Last night’s episode was one of the best yet.
---
That's what I'm saying. I'm not assuming anything at this point. Maybe a basic one will be craftable, and mods will be atoms or quest rewards. Just a healthy amount of skepticism at this point.
---
As far as i know there is no hardened 50cal receiver in-game yet.
---
The standard 50 cal receiver does the same damage as the hardened 308 receiver.
---
I love how easy it it. Oh and yes I do need help. My  missus often compares me to the joker.
---
Fallout 4 is 210 years after the great war.
---
I didn't flip out personally but given the rarity of rad storms it did kind of irk me.
---
i confirm, it work! i just renamed my old dxgi.dll (the one used for reshade i think) to d3d9.dll and now i have both chat mod. and reshade fully functional :D
---
Same here, chat volume starts at nothing and when I raise it I can't hear people
---
Yeah, I've seen guys playing with girl names before. It's more common than what you might think, LoL. I have one female character and one male character. My female is my main. I typically play female characters because I play in third person a lot and when I do, I don't wanna be staring at some dude's ass as I run along the map. I know it's only 1's and 0's, but it's still female and looks so much better than a male's ass shaking around in my face, LoL.
---
It’s a legendary enemy of course it regens
---
My current sniper is a hardened. 50 cal
---
The Sheepsquatch is still coming
---
It's not just you. The Forest is capped to level 10 max. Toxic Valley (north) is capped to \~25, while most of the Ash Heap (south) is capped to 40. Whitesprings and anything further east is uncapped, and because there's almost always a higher level player nearby, you'll regularly run into max-level enemies there.
---
As the main quest lines all force you into Whitesprings or Pleasant Valley, the difficulty level naturally jumps from straightforward to nearly impossible. You can either take a break from quests and concentrate on levelling, or resign yourself to a lot of deaths.
---
The standard 50cal receiver does the same amount of damage as the hardened 308 cal receiver.
---
All other variants of the 50cal deal less damage.
---
Hardened 50cal receiver isn't in game yet.
---
Are you on xbox?
---
You do realize most stared lengendary creatures regen health when they reach 50% that a mechanic thats been in fallout since 3 its not going anywhere either
---
Yep
---
Haha, man, I had just about forgotten about this post. Sure thing though man. IGN is WanderingWolf15.
---
I want those new mutations and mutation looks I'll pay atoms just to change my character with unique looks like a ghoul or scorch
---
I don't think the plans are in the game yet, only the 4 you get for the quests...
---
500 atoms for a radomized lock skin would be fine investment for me, everytime you went to a lock it went to one of 5-10 different lock skins would be neat.
---
There has been zero indication of that. So yes, you are assuming.
---
*Antler
---
Do enough people even use it to make it useful?
---
Probably not.  The Gatling gun has high damage and slow rof.
---
Because that is what is most important on reddit...
---
I get camped and slaughtered at train stations all the time, so as neat as it sounds, no, too much work.
---
I couldn't get it to work either
---
The 20s are a weird, tough place to be. You’re too high to be just fighting low level enemies in the Forest, but too squishy still to be wandering far into the Savage Divide (especially when other players have been through). I leveled up through the 20s and some of the 30s mostly in the Ash Heap, and getting some basic power armor made my survivability better in higher areas. 
---
One of the worst was when my sneaky sniper (with no really decent melee weapons) snuck into the clubhouse of this nice golf resort I found, and was mobbed by dozens of angry level 40-60 ghouls clawing me to death as I tried desperately to run away.   Now it’s one of the best spots to visit :)
---
No ones arguing they’re greedy. They are. We know this. 
---
They’re just not Activision greedy. What you guys are describing, is that.
---
I've been having fun with a stealth build. Ranges sneak attacks and I forget th name of the perk but silenced weapons at night get a huge bump
---
I can trade you one, do you have blueprints to trade instead? Do you know what time you‘ll be on?
---
My indication is Repair Kits. If they're having those for items, I don't see it being the only thing, is all.
---
This is like the harlequin or the goblin mask from fasnacht. Not going to believe it until i see it with my own 2 eyes.
---
Having confirmation that it's actually real might motivate me to serverhop until i drop dead for one of those.
---
Can a mod pin this comment? Or better could you make a follow up post with a quick description on how to edit the wiki for everyone?
---
I am right there with you!! I’ve seen a guy in what looks like a legit sheepsquatch outfit but I’ve only seen him once. Maybe he was a mirage
---
No I am not, bethesda specifically added this feature in to make dying be a punishment. They aren't "stealing" your stuff, you lost that stuff when you died and dropped it. If you get back to where you died and no one else got the stuff you dropped then you got lucky, but when another player comes along and takes the stuff you dropped from dying? That is how it is supposed to work.
---
noob.
---
Well, that's good to hear. Still though, need to make sure to disable ads on Gamepedia from now on then. Don't want Wikia/Fandom getting anything from me.
---
Some context: I run a Simpsons wiki. I have done since its days on Wikia. Wikia forced a new skin design on us, lots of people objected. It was so anti-editor, made to allow more ads on pages etc. We were discussing what to do, and of course ended up discussing moving away from Wikia. Staff then, as a result, removed my admin powers and closed the discussion, claiming it was already over. When it clearly wasn't. Which, I thank them for. As many editors were on the fence about moving until that happened. lol
---
Yes I’ve just got one coincidently
---
Lol.  I hear ya’.  Thanks
---
Everything helps man, thanks for your patience with the system
---
Currently on...... ......What do you mean Blueprints? (I have a lot of random Blueprints if thats what you want.)
---
I never really thought the dailers were unreasonable as they are supposed to be a "challenge" but i was damn bored of getting alcohol challenges every day and the same for weeklies, i dont really use alcohol on my characters so it was forcing me into a play style i didnt like doing just for the challenges
---
They always regen at 50%. I would recommend that you don't bother summoning a queen unless you can call on some players with bloodied DPM builds to kill it for you.
---
If you like fallout games but think they have too many npcs and main quests, then this is the game for you!
---
No really though it's a fun game. If you like fallout for exploration and character development it's all there. Just the storyline got moved to tapes, notes, and robots. The multiplayer aspect is there, and fun. But not necessary for 90% of the game.
---
You on and wanna sell it haha
---
Lucky you.   Lol I couldn’t even go there
---
The game is balanced around PVP currently. Bethesda doesn’t want to have any weapons that can easily one shot players. It is why missles and nukes are garbage.
---
but the white sheepsquatch mascot outfit is far superior to the black one on the store
---
Lol good to hear I’m not the only One!
---
Because it isn't an act of PVP because it isn't stealing your shit. You lost your shit when you died and dropped it, if you manage to get back there and be the first one to pick it up good job you got lucky, but someone else coming along and picking it up before you isn't stealing. That is just you losing your junk for dying, dying has consequences. That consequence being you lose all your junk on you by dropping it and having it open for anyone to take it if they want.
---
There's certain quest items that need to be repaired at a Tinkerers Bench, but nothing I can think of that can be modded at one.
---
Nothing is broken with it. I’ve used it now for at least 100 levels
---
You are the reason why women don't like playing online games with with men.  I've been harrassed twice in this game by boys who think it's ok to virtually stalk me and be crass on open mic after I tried to help them since they were lower-level and underpowered.  Keep your opinions to yourself, and learn how to respect other people.  No one in this world exists for your pleasure.
---
Ive done this event 3 times and weve not had a problem any of the 3 times, i dobt know what people your playing with but they dobt sound up to the task
---
I hate it too. My bar doesn't feel the same :(
---
Why would you want to waste .308 on the combat rifle? Save it for the light machine gun.
---
Unyielding BOS ain’t bad. I have a full set but only use 4/5 pieces.
---
Ok.   Thank you
---
Ok thanks man
---
Just let me know when you're able to get on and make the trade
---
Yea just looking to browse really maybe trade one if i don’t have it.
---
whats your gamer Tag?
---
World full.
---
Speaking of pioneers, I’ve been trying to make a sort of almanac for the game, namely locating resource deposits, but I uninstalled discord and have to wait for my paycheck to clear to be able to download it again (I know, filthy mobile user.) I’ll start a thread with the discord link when I get my paycheck for keeping track of all sorts of things, resource deposits, spawn zones/behaviors of hostiles, and anything else a wiki might need
---
Thanks all for the advice!
---
But for a boss that requires a lot of people to kill and then there is hardly anyone online where I'm from so I think that the boss should have a little more health but no regen.
---
Really, it depends on what you want to do. Some spots that need love are Atomic Shop items, verifying weapon information and especially mods for them, and quest walkthroughs.
---
Jesterskull25
---
It was limited in its availability. It ended last night
---
I agree. I really do enjoy how challenging it is and that teamwork is somewhat required. I think a looking for group radio station or some form of "fallout tinder" or a wow like dungeon que to help people find groups would be great. 
---
The wow dungeon method was always nice. It made me feel like farming mats was something to do to fill time while waiting for my dungeon ding,  not the prime directive like it does many times in 76.
---
I'll join yours.
---
Hardened is still .308.
---
50 cal is its own mod
---
I actually have two in my stash right now &gt;&lt;
---
That's ok! I'll stay out of your way and just be a little comic relief as well as a provider of food. I'll add you. I'm theaimpolice4
---
There's already a .308 MG - the [MG42 or LMG](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Light_machine_gun_\(Fallout_76\))
---
Some events require it, i just hammered througj every mr gutsy and protectron in the Crypic event just now because they were targeting the other players and would be a problem for them, so i stood on the roof with my explosive minigun and laid waste to them all
---
I’m half in agreement with both of you. It is a server wide event, but there is absolutely nothing in the quest chain (at least that I recall) indicating the final part cannot be completed solo. I get his frustration. Doing 2-3 hours of solo questing just fine only to get to the climax of it all and discover 1) More than 1 player is required and 2) Depending on your luck it could be hours before you complete it.
---
The implementation could have been better, for sure.
---
I thought they just made you make a new one from the part?
---
I’m out here just using armour that looks nice, pretty peaceful life being a PvE only player
---
Sending invite now.
---
Yeah i had that just now, part of one of the dailers is to level up in watoga, but all the robots spawn dead now :(
---
Most Raider RP people see is pretty much "Why are you destroying my base?" "'Cause I's a Raider". 
---
If/When CAMPS become immune to player damage (at least in Adventure mode) most people RP'ing "Raiders" will have almost nothing to do than target the couple of occupied workshops that most players really don't care about after level 40-50. Once global chat becomes a common thing the RP can really take off.
---
Yeah I’ve been saving .38 and have a ton of known plans, shits gonna be cash when I can sell it
---
I prefer to circle around and come up behind them throw a few grenades to disturb them and then nail em.
---
Thats the point of it....its a boss an endgame boss at that..come on why make it easy lol if everything were that easy it wouldnt be any fun. If you want easy go play need for speed
---
What universe am I in? A company trying to make money to keep itself around is greedy?
---
it d i d him, I cant get over that,
---
I have no opinion on that.  I have not gotten to play since the parade event thing, sadly.
---
They have full whatever armor makes it so they stand still and take almost no damage
---
Happy Cake Day guccishort! Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true.
---
\+karma
---
I think it’s that, plus from an economics standpoint, it serves to siphon caps out of the economy, which should help control inflation.
---
Usually what happens at level 20-25 is that people follow the quest lines to Whitesprings, get murdered by max-level ghouls and then post here asking how the hell they're supposed to progress. I'm guessing that you didn't get there yet.
---
Later in the game the difficulty diverges a lot depending on your build. In the early game it's more about where you go.
---
I swear months ago at release it was a thing that sometines robots would spawn in there instead of ghouls, but i havent heard of it in a while
---
It gave me the "your title needs to be longer" twice, so I finally just used it's own message as a title, I'm not being petty lol.
---
Sentinels.
---
Did they fix the issue of dropping a bunch of aid and caps? I want to do survival but I don't want to lose all my stuff.
---
I would love to have a Battle like that. I only ever get one shotted, often because I never shoot first.
---
Haha, trust me, I've gotten the "your title is wrong" there a few times, too. Mainly because I forgot I had to capitalize PC, Oh noes!
---
They just claimed each others bountys
---
disconnect from server instantly
---
Keep in mind it might not have been there the first time you looked as its a random soawn at certain locations, or if another player had already taken it it wont be there
---
Weapons Artisan and Makeshift warrior makes it tolerable.   
---
Weapons artisan allows you to repair weapons up to 200%.   Makeshift warrior then slows the breakage.  
---
As for breakage rates, I haven’t seen anything that would indicate that the breakage rate scales beyond the amount that you are use it (i.e. per “shot”) In that way Melee weapons are the same as guns.
---
&gt;Repair kits are starting down a path none of us wants.
---
Don't speak for me. Idgaf if they add repair kits to the store. I'm not going to use them either way. Repair costs are already ridiculous, and there's absolutely zero chance building them wouldn't take half a dozen screws and at least 1 ballistic fiber, which I have few of on a good day. 
---
They're there for the whales and the bleeding edge types that absolutely need everything at 200% before going to solo kill SBQ
---
Interesting, I need to farm for BOS with unyielding sounds good.
---
I bulk all of it anyway it helps me organize the stash!
---
They could also give a proper Anti-material Rifle instead of the hunting rifle since in all logic the hunting rifle wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure from a 50cal cartridge. I would actually prefer to have the Sniper Rifle from 3 and New Vegas, it just looked better and I agree we need the original Assault rifle from 3 as well.
---
Missiles are buggy and will just vanish sometimes. Also don't aim directly at the thing when using missiles, aim for the ground  in front of it... For some reason a direct hit does nothing, but splash damage is devastating.
---
1: get gamma gun
---
2: laugh as they don't try to avoid your fire and become irradiated husks
---
3: ????
---
4: Profit!
---
All companies are greedy. Not saying it’s a bad thing, the bottom line is money for them, just like it’s always been. 
---
But they are greedy. All corporations are lol.
---
Yeah, there's no reason to carry bulk junk around anymore because of the vendor cap pool change. You can just dump it where you bulk it.
---
Yeah you drop far less aid now, same with caps. Believe they detailed the change in patch notes.
---
I've got like 300+ screws lol. Mostly I give them to my bro as he's melee build and needs to repair more than I do as a sneaky sniper.
---
aw.. okay.  
---
Thank you for the info btw!
---
I can get behind fallout tinder haha
---
Thats messed up and that should be impossible in some way
---
Your worries are what a mite button is for
---
Gah, thank you! Everyone is acting like I'm crazy because I had a question about why bulking is arbitrary and makes no sense on what you can and can't bulk.
---
It’s definitely not dead. Always full servers. Sometimes the world is full and I can’t even get on.
---
Yeah, found one once. I think it's currently on one of my friends' characters. Not selling it since the massive buff though.
---
Hes a duper! Get him
---
You have to craft/loot them, they don’t just spawn in the box.
---
Always capture the vid man and then pull a screenshot from the video later.  Tsk tsk.
---
It was awesome. Tbf some guy had to be sacrificed so I could get on the leaderbored. Then when I'm visible on the map we focused on building notoriety and people putting bountys on us helped. We went out of our way to create the conditions and the pay off was great.
---
Definatley want at least one mate with you, sharing the experience and working together against people adds loads to It.
---
They weren’t mine, I honestly think it would be great to have someone spew racist stuff so you can hunt them down and grief them after reporting them. Because, to quote better call Saul, *Criminals have no Recourse*
---
Yeah I like the idea of a hardcore mode like Ark, Rust or Conan. With Base raiding. The camp system is a good starting point with so much potential.
---
Where do you craft them
---
Lol don't have to do they may on my cork scrap 0.03x3000
---
That's about as subjective as it gets
---
The boss in the event is not the Sheepsquatch, it's the Imposter, the real Sheepsquatch may appear later on, either as another event or just like the other cryptids, at a random location.
---
No, found only 100% spawn of that carcrab. Would be happy if someone who know megasloth spawn share.
---
I try to tag things as much as possible to let people get hits in, but the only must is legendaries, IMO.
---
You're getting downvoted, but you're not wrong. I give away all of my dupes to lower level players / trade knowns for knowns. It works out pretty well.
---
I saw one once just across the water from the eastern edge of Watoga, but I've never found him again.
---
Link up with other people. The internet is a great thing. Surely you’ll find people to form a group, a clan or something.
---
I can get on right now, my IGN is LightSabersEdge.
---
It might be a bug with the build a camp quest.  I think I have seen it before a few months ago.
---
They DO just spawn in the box. I have one. Try storing it, leaving the game and then rebuilding it?
---
Ya let me know what you find
---
Same here.  Several weapon modifications that won’t stick.
---
Except for the comic book skins giving that 15HP boost per outfit in a group and the only ones that didn't take up all armor slots were the atomic shop ones. The ones you could buy you could wear over your normal armor, meanwhile the one you could get in game made you take off all your armor (garb of mysteries).
---
So while it was only for a limited time, they absolutely have had items on the atom shop already that gave ingame benefits long before repair kits.
---
Well, this is my problem.
---
There are titles out there where what you're describing (which is also what I want) is part of the larger gameplay loop, and it's not so far-fetched that they -should- be part of the gameplay loop, as opposed to simply a "find the fun" and "use your imagination."
---
Part of the charm of EVE Online (besides spreadsheets everywhere) is that it allows players to band together and... do... things. Guard duty. Scouting. Exploration. Building homes. Weaving a story.
---
EVE, I imagine, isn't the only title that provides systems for this, but it's certainly the biggest dog.
---
I'd look up the YouTuber Jug. He has quite a few work arounds. Unfortunately I don't believe there is one for your problem.
---
Players should be able to set up  in game pirate radio stations and actually broadcast. Could go for the better, but probably the worst.... but it could add a fun element into the worlds and be great for role playing.
---
I had one of those recently, but I think it's because I lockpicked too soon after entering Whitesprings. I ran down the stairs, started the lockpick, game dragged me back to the entrance (standard) and then crashed.
---
Thank you I feel so dumb now
---
Usually would be around 150-200 people online at a time in the past.
---
Nope, look at when they did the comic book outfits, each one gave +15 hp for each unique version in a group. There were 3 you could get in the atom shop and one in game, the 3 in the atom shop allowed you to wear your armor with the outfit, meanwhile the only one available ingame replaced all your armor.
---
Defiance Has Fallen
---
Same here. I got a great location. Would hate to have to move it
---
I varies based on Charisma, mine is 6 but if I don't have Hard Bargain and Magnetic Personality/Party Girl on it's like 2300.
---
I don’t know about that. Plenty of people are happy with the directions things are going, and that direction is as bad as anyone else
---
I finally found a T-60 level 50 Torso and right leg yesterday.  I kept find level 40 versions.   
---
In the Mire there is T-60 power armor behind the Red Rocket south of Harpers Ferry and one in RobCo.   
---
There are many other power armor locations in the Mire.  But those are somewhat easy in comparison.  
---
One bug that I ran into is that the game wouldn’t let me apply a mod to the T-60 right leg after I picked it up even though I had the materials, perk cards equipped, etc.   I haven’t tried reconnecting and am hoping that it’s as simple as that.
---
Any hints on where I can find BOS combat Armor plans? I got the arms, but still looking for chest and legs.
---
It’s good but buggy. Sometimes worse than others, like with Power Armor mods getting broken with the last patch. But there is a road map with new content coming regularly. 
---
You can’t go in and expect more Fallout 4. It has a different take. The other players you encounter add a dimension. On ps4 there is a great shared experience and you can play as solo or join a squad as much as you prefer.
---
It has a big map, lots of things to do and find. If you like Fallout, give it a shot.
---
[At Stonehenge yo.](https://ello.co/artcinco/post/icut2xdbn0yhwnfrmk2j7g)
---
I activate pylons die.. lag... have to activate pylons again.. die.. lag... failed event lol
---
Can I buy a marsupial please GT doubleA3455
---
Lol same bro
---
Any word on when it will be fixed? Probably on tuesday when I finally have an hour to play. ;)
---
Lmao that’s the imposter set! That’s my favorite outfit in the game now. I ended up just buying the head from someone after I got the damn fedora like 5 times in a row! It’s a fun event and if you get a group of people that will actually work as a team (conduits and robot control on top of damage on the sheep squatch) then it’s not too hard honestly. I failed the first 2 because we had no clue on a plan of attack!
---
Don't feel dumb. You didn't know and asked for help. Nothing dumb about that. 
---
If you get it to work, just let us know so others that may have the same problem can see a posdible solution.
---
This might be what I finally need to abandon my power armor
---
Well I just did the event again and we killed it in less than 5 minutes so.... Idk what to tell you. It's too easy now that I've actually gotten to see the thing.
---
In case i wasn't very clear, please do post a screenshot of your hunting rifle with a hardened 50cal receiver. 
---
There are lots of threads about it and nobody found one yet. If you did find it it would be really useful to show it as proof so people know it's in-game already. Further info such as where you got it will be appreciated.
---
The way i was thinking of helping is to open my game and Upload my inventory.
---
That way, the wiki will have EVERYTHING.
---
EVERY possible stat of aid weapons apparel and also list every junk as well.
---
Then upload our map of places we visited.
---
Nope, why would you be banned?
---
Is using a mod on an online game against the terms of service? Can I be banned and lose my access to a $60 purchase for using this mod?
---
It’s basically mini excavator armor
---
It started working thank you very much your right I shouldn't feel dumb I just got it
---
Can you craft me some that I can use and I'll pay you. I seen them around for mostly 150. I can't find any now so 200 caps isn't that bad I guess.
---
What do you mean needing everyone on the server to participate? You realize sheepsquatch imposter can be solo'd right?
---
Some of y'all never launch your own nukes and it shows.
---
We're all learning. Glad it worked out.
---
Oh yeah..we defeated the queen last night..and someone's whatever gun 'gooified' her..she disappeared..couldn't loot her..I was salt
---
Best! News! Ever!
---
Looking forward to runnings dungeons with the Text-gang!
---
#TotallyNotATrap
---
I an not home right now I will send you one when I get home.
---
Okay, thanks! I'll see if these are the problem.
---
I thought I got shot by a ceiling mounted turret in the armory lol it was a knock over heavy turret glitch through the floor!
---
146 isn't horrible. I'm lvl 79 and my max lvl AA LAR is at 160 dmg and I have all rifle/demolition perks maxed.
---
I'm not sure you could squeeze much more out of it.
---
Yeah, never understood how my 50cal sniper does less damage than the 308..
---
If I were Bethesda I would make the .50 hunting rifle use a new type of ammo called .50 BMG that is crafted in smaller quantities and up the damage, the MG can continue using standard .50
---
No.
---
I found out that carrying a variety of weapons took up too much carry weight
---
Guess if I wanna go around w/o power armor I can’t use my vampire Gatling gun
---
:( it’s basically the only thing that kept me alive during the sbq fight
---
Observations? More like a small novel, you couldn't condense it a little bit?
---
Nope, still able to build them. Just that there is still a bug where it says things are floating when they aren't.
---
With the new pooled caps for the vendors, people are able to sell them for more profit since you can sell higher valued things there. Up to 1400 caps.
---
Thanks. I will have to hope that Makeshift Warrior 4 and Gunsmith 4 (or maybe 5/3) will work, in conjunction with Weapon Artisan 3 and INT * + mentats + brain fungus soup. But it will take me quite some time to work up to it.
---
I'm planning on a casual Shotgun + Melee build (more on the melee side) so I'll probably need to keep both melee and shotgun weapons from degrading. :)
---
I would love to see this as well, but it probably wont happen because of issues with mobs not being able to path to them correctly when attacking your camp, especially if placed on a floating wall.  Can you imagine the WS turret camps with unreachable turrets that would pop up?
---
I'm also looking for some mutations. Only one I have right now is marsupial. I'm on Xbox also so let me know what you fellars have.
---
Shopping cart turrets would be awesome
---
Well..this is a fallout 76 dedicated to the game..where everyone here plays..so..I'd say...probably not
---
I mean, me and the crew are usually run with we'll do a couple. We did a run last night. And killed the queen within like 6 minutes. That is if everyone gets on. It's usually like six of us.
---
I found it at watoga in a building with a juke box near the river. It was random because I had most other recipes already.
---
I’ll have to try that next time😂. I have a fearius one my only worry is ammo
---
Pursuing insult target
---
I think many of the weapons a weirdly heavy, luckily all I need is my two all rises and my two shot Tesla
---
Thanks! Also sorry for the traps lol
---
the black ones colour scheme is terrible. The random blue and red ruins it. If the eyes were just red and the blue was taken out it would look slightly better
---
Kinda reminded me of Doc Ock from PS4 Spiderman
---
I've seen a lot more cooperation during this week for Sole Survivor which is nice. It's especially good if you keep running into the same person over and over (if you haven't already teamed) so you have some mutual understanding that we're just here to finish events.
---
I do see teams (usually top 1-3) going around trying to kill people at events but there are usually enough events to avoid them (they tend not to split up to cover events).
---
Good luck getting 20/20 events!
---
Yeah, basically how it is now is that if you buy someone's awesome item for caps, they basically just gave it to you for free.
---
I’m about to quit this damn game. It’s a good game it’s just the but a few specific bugs and shit completely ruins the experience. I can’t loot fort defiance except maybe once a week or so it never fucking respawned any of the loot. Same with containers and stuff everywhere. I’ll go days without being able to loot anything. Can’t find any specifics online about what it takes for it to respawn either so fuck this.
---
I'm sure there are lots of good honest traders out there! I just wish I could see what the "going" price of an item currently was as the markets fluctuate. If only there was an Ebay for FO76 goods. Lol
---
Was that the pure k os invite?
---
Seems like a bad nightmare the 400 limit. At least with 800 we have a reasonable storage.
---
I have it out front of my camp and love it! Kind of like a garden statue! :)
---
No problem I just at work so I cant play🙁
---
No! Give them to me! I always need more mini nukes and missiles, I'm down to 47 mini nukes and like 60ish missiles.
---
I’m having this issue too
---
+karma Thanks man. If you were actually interested in the impostor sheepsquatch outfit, I do have an additional one, and I'm open to hearing anything you would like to offer for it.
---
Hold up wait it’s you Ben wtf I didn’t even read that
---
*We Must Save My Awrahhghghahghhh*
---
--stabbing sounds---
---
**Feel my vengence, how does it taste?**
---
sounds like a good group! If you could give me a heads up the next time you’re going to do a run that would be great. PSN: stollio
---
Desperate virgins lol 😂😂
---
I joined a little late but I got it easy when someone was like “stop shooting it until the conduits are done!!!” And then everything fell into place nicely lol
---
I wish I had the imposter one. I have the one that looks like footie pajamas
---
I think those weapons are supposed to be using the overly generous perk and grind a bunch of rads into folks
---
Yeah, but that was a temporary bonus that lasted for a week, so... not really a bonus you could buy to have.
---
Players sell serums, just fyi
---
I prefer normal armor. 3* legendaries can have 20% weight reduction effects, which save you some perk space. It's also much better to have weapon weight reduced than specifically big guns or pistols or melee weight reduced. It's the only way to make rifles weigh a reasonable amount.
---
Plus, I'm pretty sure with a full set of vanguard armor you can have more resistances than power armor. I'm just using mishmash pieces, some of which aren't max level, but have an easy 300+ in both physical and energy resistance
---
Oohh. I guess not now that I think about it. I was just thinking that their health bar and all was still red. Lol
---
I ran into that problem before. I switched audio to area, went back to the game, switched back to auto,v then returned to the game. Seemed to work for that game session afterwards.
---
I hope not. Caps already not worth that much. Being able to sell ammo would make caps really worthless.
---
I do hope in the future we can scrap ammo for junk.
---
As far as I know, there are no lever action spawn locations in the game. They'll sometimes drop on boss enemies, but otherwise you just have to buy the plan and craft them yourself.
---
Huh strange. I seem to be killing every single enemy at watoga and still not getting legendary items. YOU learn to talk to people like a human. Get off your soap box. Multiple people that farm are standing behind my comment of not finding legendary items. You are just coming up with non-backed excuses for us not seeing them like us being lazy, which is untrue.
---
Look for casual underarmor
---
😂😂 Where did you go?
---
How much for 12 nukes, 20 missile and all the fuel?
---
My bad, I'd turned the game off for the night and couldn't quite remember.
---
According to the terms of service Fallout 76 does not support mods addons or third-party programs. The only thing that lists as a consequence is that the game may not function properly. I would still probably not use it although I wanted to, until private modded servers are available. online games the mass majority do not accept the use of mods because this opens up the possibility of exploits and cheats. :(
---
This isn't the right thread to bitch about this but....I'm pissed that my rifle build ate 9 perception points for only a +60% damage output.
---
You're right. I realize that now
---
I got empath after having 8 other mutations from serums I used... needless to say after 15 Radaway I had empath and no other mutations.. very sad day lol lesson learned always wear starched genesis maxed out when fighting ghouls.
---
With the Grounded mutation, in my opinion, Metal armor is better than BOS. Most damage you take in the game is either radiation damage from ghouls or ballistic damage from bullets and melee. I've never had my energy DR above 400 and nothing has presented a threat of killing me with energy weapons except for the robots at Whitesprings when I piss them off by scratching their paint trying to help them.
---
At the end of the day, your legendary abilities on level 50 equipment are more important than the damage reduction combinations on them. As long as it's BOS, Metal, or Leather you're fine with 2-3\* gear with damage mitigation.
---
You also shouldn't look at total resistance as an important stat for the reason about energy weapons I mentioned above. Your example of 215DR/394ER means you have more 27% protection from a damage type you're going to see 90% less. Even if you're going to go up against a bunch of high level robots, you'd still be better off with metal armor with Troubleshooter's on it since robots still use Melee a bunch and the damage mitigation from Troubleshooter's would provide better protection from Assaultron than any ER less than \~500.
---
Just some food for thought, not trying to be critical.
---
Lol i always got extra junk im not using and have to dump it!
---
Yeah I am sitting here thinking they are hacking.  They can jump to the roof of the power plant from ground lol, no power armor, move around mid air like no clip mode and auto aim bot me from a mile with an explosive auto.
---
Or find someone to mod it for you
---
It is a company, the money they make pay for the salaries of the Devs that improve the game. Their bosses wants the game to make money or they pull the plug on the servers. That is not greed. It is business.
---
Sorry mate PC
---
Ok thanks for the help
---
I remember somebody did the math to find the "ideal" armor combo, but it depends on what you're doing. You can generally have a good idea of what damage types you will be up against in a certain area. Also it's generally better to have a balanced build because the difference between 350 and 400 physical resistance is nothing compared to the difference between 100 and 150 energy, or vice versa
---
Ah, that's interesting. I didn't realize things worth over 1 were saleable, I just knew somethings were, and some weren't. I feel like I can sell some stuff that's just 1, though. But maybe I'm wrong.
---
Sorry I’m unfortunately on PS4
---
Yeah thats why I can see why it needed nerfed as a farming spot. You shouldn't be able to grind legendaries with no risk to yourself.
---
There’s a duffle bag and the resort up north in the savage divide that has a high chance to spawn one. Not likely but it’s a good place to check for one. 
---
Also doing events in level 25 areas and up can reward one. 
---
If nothing else ask and see if someone can craft you a few.
---
Hey, I sent you a friend request on discord. The name coming through will be Regicide.
---
Oh if u looted it previously it won't reset for another 20 hours..I don't get my first legit 'explosive' gun (from an enemy I defeated) til after 450 hours..don't let it get to u bruh..I said it before..legendary enemies are the worst teases...EVER..the best thing to do..is to just play it like u usually do.. the RNG gods will bless u eventually..but for now I'm just buying all the things I want from the market subs..it's not the same but.. at least I can enjoy some of the toys this game has to offer
---
So selling triple a titles for 60$ isn’t enough money for these companies now?
---
How do you feel about 500 caps?
---
You need to learn to find junk at these locations: Go to fort defiance, go to missile silos, go to military areas, camp venture and forward stations. Explore. 
---
Literally L2P issue. There's only a few things you want to buy, and they're convieniences, not 'needs' (plans mostly-- these drop in the world, but its far faster just to buy them)
---
Used to be Grafton, Camden Park, Welch and Lewisburg. Haven't checked since the last patch though.
---
oh cool, didnt know that! any place where you can find one? wiki says its drop only or by plans at vendors
---
it happens all the time after a nuke is done
---
Did the backpacks drop already? If not when are the backpacks suppose to drop?
---
Well, if you ever deicde to try it out I can recommend the Perk Loadout mod, the Text mod, the Better Inventory mod and the mod that makes the map more like in Fallout 4. They are all very nice.
---
Level is more important than armor type in terms of repair costs. Max level legendary leather still needs a good chunk of ballistic fiber, adhesive, etc
---
1. Running around in Harpers Ferry, decided to chuck a Nuke mine and a A-hole super mutant shot it in the air before I could even back away.
---
2. Scrapped the floor of my camp and fell down a cliff.
---
3. Random Encounter Wendigo slapped me off a cliff in the savage Divide.
---
4. Decided to try out a Quad Explosive Combat Shotgun
---
I see, thanks bro
---
Except that literally what it was a temp boost to your character for paying cash. Just because it was temporary doesn't change that. I mean hell most p2w mobile games boosts you can bu with cash are also temporary.
---
Like ild he robbing you, 750 is still a steal
---
People also don't run the queen as much so there's less stable flux running around.
---
Nice good to know there out there i bet you could do silly damage with ine3
---
I like it. It's a discussion!
---
1 every 2 minutes. Use the event timer as a reference. I like to shoot at end of either every even or odd minute. Example, shoot at 25 minutes to go, 23 minutes, etc.
---
I have that same pistol. I don't know why but I want it too. I'll trade the plan plus 1500 caps if that seems fair?
---
.50 BMG is what the MG would use realistically 
---
For the hunting rifle I'd bring .338 or Winchester 300 mag for a beefier round
---
Is that guaranteed or just a chance
---
Hmm, I'm having this problem everywhere though - from the freak-show to fort defiance to the crashed satellite area.
---
Put it on toggle and tell her it's off half the time. That's called compromise and if she takes the relationship as seriously as you do she should choose to meet in the middle ground you're offering.
---
I definitely think there’s something else to the loot respawn. Like I said I’ve gone up to 3 days before anything respawned before
---
Buy “the resort” do you mean whitesprings? Sorry I’m fairly new to this game so I don’t know a lot of the locations lol.
---
You are onto something
---
I try to find someone if possible. People aren’t always the most adamant on trading.
---
This was ps4 last night around 1am EST? And then someone nuked WS right after the scorched event
---
Allo again, if you're still collecting I've noticed another above the AVR terminal in Charleston AVR centre, the one you use when running the early quest to inoculate yourself.
---
I'm 282 and have found maybe 5 awesome things that are keep/sell worthy lol
---
Yea I have that one too! You will get that one too if you just keep doing it. I think it’s kind of dying down now but I personally really like the event. It’s the most challenging event as of now imo. And the chances of legendary enemies on top of the boss are pretty good. Not to mention the good junk you get from the dead robots! I’ll join it every time it pops up.
---
Complete with no re-charge time
---
No I think it’s called sunny top? The bag is on the left hand side. It’s a ski resort.
---
I get it. Honestly, I like the white better too. But you can describe your opinion as much as you want but it's still just a subjective opinion.
---
GT: KnowledgeHound
---
You used commas wrong in two totally different ways. That's oddly impressive.
---
I wish we could break it down like the New Vegas system. You could break down one ammo type and use the components to make a different type.
---
Supposedly they nerfed some legendary enemies..I heard the watoga robots and noticed less at the whitespring golfclub
---
I am at 15 of 20, and just did 4 in a row that didnt count. I even tried closing the game via xbox dashboard. Still not counting them. Enclave events have counted for me.
---
Another happy owner of one. Tho it seems to need a lot of modding before it comes up to snuff
---
One would think that a bug this bad would get a hotfix asap, right?
---
Had the same thing happen on xbox, jumped in tagged the queen, ran around and killed the adds, queens killed and no body or Xp
---
It gets posted from time to time but it isnt that exciting so doesn't get many upvotes.  I have seen it personally on several occasions.  I do not know what caused this but it seems like a lower level player walking nearby is part of the trigger.
---
Did you get any objectives?
---
Sadly not enough people use mics and it sucks ass yo :(
---
It's been bothering me. I love the impostor outfit, but the matching helmet is just...meh. I love the horns, but overall I'm not fond of the design, and the cleanness of the helmet does does just make it seem off.
---
Damn it, I now just seen what you mean and definitely need this. Now I want the really cheap clear plastic handle screwdriver... in before ‘Snap-On’ promotion skin for 10 atoms per day.
---
Yeah, but since Atoms are freely and easily farmed ingame there is still no need to pay to get the bonus. Me and my friends got the costumes and enjoyed that bonus, nobody payed a cent. Were we doing pay2win?
---
Aaaaaannnnnnddddd your banned
---
You get them from the new event (You can also get new hats and outfits)
---
attaching mods is broken atm it's not just that gun
---
Before the server crash there was a ton of players so when I came back in to the same server WS was empty. 
---
Keep in mind the nuke just hit and still showed the red circle on the map but it wasn’t radiating at all. This went on for a good 45+ minutes... 
---
Ended up pointless since there wasn’t any hardened mass or glowing at all anywhere for flux...
---
I think mean they should have two separate rounds: .308 rifle round and.308 LMG round.  Likewise with the .50 cal
---
My game guide says that causal linings drop from census violence. I haven't gotten any yet but half the time I try that quest its bugged
---
I think this’ll be something I’ll be able to do in my free time. Plus fandom wikia stuff is able to be put on a resume, according to an informed English major friend of mine.
---
My PS4 gamer tag is TruJoe_
---
Guaranteed. Same as the handmade rifle plans, just different locations.
---
I would also like to test this, however I don't have dev hacks for free testing, and have no interest in using my resources to intentionally bug out the queen and lose additional resources in the process.
---
\&gt; There seem to be so many variables and bugs in the programming  
---
Of course. However you need to pay attention to your location, and scorchbeast AI. I used to do a 'thunderdome' style base near fissure prime, lure her over, and there were no valid locations to land at (and no spawns occurred unless she landed), so she landed very infrequently. I've also had bases where the 'roof' was actually flooring, and scorchbeasts landed there (only had sbq land once ever while fighting her).
---
Pay attention to who she's attacking and aggro'ing on consistently, and when she lands. There \*are\* a few spots that're still valid landing around the bunker, but its easy to be invalid LZ's.
---
I call them fuckers cuz I cant stand the noiss
---
+karma thank you
---
I noticed tho..after she was dead..someone shot her with a plasma gun ..and she turned into liquid and vanished..I was never so pissed..from the event I got stable flux and a 2* chest piece..but then I was like wtf.. that could have been my AAE or BE lever or handmade 😡😡😡
---
😂
---
Yesterday at the sheepsquatch site a guy kept chasing me with this ‘want to trade’ request. Maybe he wanted to buy the 50 cal I was using. There’s no polite emote that says ‘no thanks’ so I thought I’d just leave the server. When I logged off and came back in, I landed right in front of the same guy lol 😂
---
Get bear arms perk, reduces heavy gun weight by 90%. I carry around a Gatling, .50 cal, and harpoon gun for a total of less than an unmodified handmade. Hell, a 10mm pistol weighs more than any of my heavy weapons.
---
Or go pistols or rifle and use strength, int, and agi perks to reduce weight of chems, armor, bullets, energy ammo, food and drink, junk, and explosives by 90% then weapon weight isn’t a big deal. 
---
Every class of weapons has a perk for 90% reduced weight, except rifles.
---
Probably it would weight (.8)\^5=.33 of its original weight
---
I've found two, a level 30 and a level 50. The first was a drop (I don't remember from what, probably a super mutant horde boss) and the other was for sale at the Enclave production hall for about 700 caps.
---
worst kind of balance tbh
---
pvp was a mistake
---
Thanks for being so helpful. Sorry I’ve been asking so many questions but would you happen to know where exactly in grafton? Just whether it is in a building or not would be super helpful. If you don’t know that’s fine too.
---
M metal chest armor has 126 DR and 97 ER
---
Servers costs money, server maintenance costs money, server reapirs cost money, and ongoing development costs money. Ongoing costs require ongoing income. Still not greed. It is standard business. Older online games used to have a subscription service to pay for this. Gotta say I much more prefer this model, now we can chose to pay extra or not and support the game.
---
It has a max of 90% weight reduction so it would weigh 10% of its original weight
---
I’ve only seen the most hardcore players talk about solo killing the sheepsquatch, you have to have crazy gear and stims to do it. No average player can solo it.
---
Man choosing perks after level 50 is so fricking confusing, I have the +50 carry weight thing and the junk reduced weight, and they are my favorites. Everything else is whatever I needed
---
So far so good, been a week, no ban. I also wanted to make the video so I had proof, and hopefully to show Bethesda that 100K ultracite ammo isn't proof of wrong doing necessarily.
---
Hmm.  Honestly when I bought all mine for 85-90 I thought it was super cheap and I bought extras.  And really though, being able to buy these mutations and upgrayed your player for 450 caps is still a steal.
---
Its in a shed at black bear lodge northeast of grafton
---
I got one of the masks.
---
I'll have to try that event then.
---
You have bet seen it = you didn’t bother to do a search.   [Here’s one from just a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bc5g4n/whitesprings_full_of_protectrons/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 
---
It has happened once for me in all my runs- I’ve seen it posted on here far more often than I’ve encountered it in-game ;)
---
However the peices are lvl 30 most of the time
---
As I'm not the mod codder, I suggest you ask him on nexus, or come by his discord server ( link is on nexus as well).
---
I didn’t even get that, another time we killed the queen event failed, but got all the loot, xp and the body, things have been pretty messed up since the last patch/hotpatch
---
I would love to try them and thank you for the recommendations. I'll just give it a little more time and maybe wait for private servers to release. The reason why I changed to PC gaming this year and left my console behind was mods and games that utilize mods. There are so many in the Fallout franchise that change the games completely in such a positive way, it's amazing. Coming from a background of Ark Conan Exiles and Rust the idea of mods on an online game where they're not on a modded server is kind of like playing with fire. Thank you again for your recommendations :-)
---
I know it’s not a popular opinion but I agree with this. I’m not saying it’s all players, but I’ve had a large amount of unearned hostile encounters with other players.
---
maybe single player like not really suit for workshop, lol.  
---
get rekt of squad of four.
---
There's always a risk , whatever the mod you use. 
---
So far Bethesda seems to be OK with the cosmetic non cheat mods.
---
Yeah we do
---
There are multiple hermit spawns on the main road in the mire. And fog crawlers are pretty rare I think and I've only seen them in the Mire as well.
---
Ha..yeah tbh I didn't even care for the event rewards
---
I am truly not sure what exactly you think in my post was "biased propaganda".
---
I honestly do *not* recall seeing anyone actually asking for repair kits, or *anything* non-cosmetic, to be added to the Atomic Store. What I *do* remember however is the promise made that the Atomic Store would only have cosmetic items for sale, and I also remember seeing, long before we knew about the repair kits, and even long before certain things were datamined, several threads asking Bethesda to stick to keeping the Atomic Store cosmetic-only.
---
Now, what I personally remember seeing isn't really relevant one way or the other, but the OP was blaming the community at large for this, trying to make it seem like this, people asking for real money repair kits (or even something else similar to that, was somehow a common occurrence. If you want to talk about "propaganda", that there claim would be something that might qualify, since to me at least, it seems like a complete lie. However, if the OP, or you for that matter, have threads to link to, to show that this was actually happening, that the community was actually asking for repair kits to be added to the Atomic Store, then I'll definitely stand corrected. Mind you, one or two threads with a few dozen upvotes does in no way represent "the community", any more than either of us does.
---
As for how many Atoms you personally have, that's not really relevant at all, unless you're trying to make the claim that if you have 4000 Atoms, most people who play the game will also have about as much, and that it then justifies adding non-cosmetic items to the Store. In that case, you can definitely argue that point and can most certainly have that opinion and hold that view, but I have a feeling I'm not the only one who would disagree with you.
---
Yes, I was'nt there on first iteration, but it seems lot of people used it back 2 months ago.
---
You can still be banned then have to go through a process to get your account fixed, I’d just do 75k in rounds just to be safe
---
i thought i got the idea, they wait at the spawn point and kept spamming kill when my pc not even loading environment ready.
---
closed, deal complete
---
Sorry took much longer then I thought.
---
They’re garbage, but hopefully the sbq head mount will be a reward soon
---
Bethesda said that they enjoyed how players would exchange known plans to other players. People need to understand vendors are only here out of neccesity due to the lack of a proper trade hub.
---
you should play fallout 4 instead with that idea. no offense tho.
---
How many of these subscription games cost 60$ up front
---
For x01 the only place to find mods is WS Bunker I’m afraid. No schematics either so you just have to keep hopping until the right mod shows up.
---
There's always a risk.  
---
The risk is lesser even null if you use non-cheat mod that don't give you unfair advantage in game.  
---
So far no ban report on this mod.
---
Why do you go to work? To make money? That's why I go. Am I greedy, too?
---
hopping on rn
---
That inv weight restriction and inability to store much has ruined fo for me.  
---
I liked grabbing everything in sight, but here I just end up hard passing on shit unless I'm going to go get something specific.
---
Makes fo not feel like fo.   Horrid system
---
weapon balance was lack of balancing so i was not into pvp from the start.
---
10 atoms a day? I'm a real life alcoholic, and it's been pretty shitty with 5 alcohol related challenges every damn day. I don't drink anymore and as such I've made a point to mostly stay away from the drinking challenges because I don't need to let the thought that "oh I can drink in a video game, maybe one in the real world will be ok as well."
---
Well...yeah?
---
That's pretty fucking obvious
---
Had something like that when a workshop of mind is Under attack sometimes taken over it says sheepsquatch as the enemy a while before the quest line.
---
People buy that stuff? I always throw that stuff out.
---
This is a nice thing to know I'll spread your info around.
---
Yep! Far too many players seem more likely to just kill you and take your junk than trade you for the legendary gear you have that doesn’t match your build. 
---
Oh well, I guess it’s off to the vendor for my daily allowance.
---
I bought 2x marsupial at the Enclave bunker by mistake for 3500 or something each, kept the spare, I kicked myself but it didn’t take long to hit ‘max caps’ again.
---
Caps seem so easy to accrue.
---
got the point. seem most problem was humanity itself.
---
It's always been 25%. I used a bobblehead as a test item because their value is a nice round 100 caps. Even with maxed charisma, a full set of unyielding pushing me to 30 CHA, and Grape mentats I couldn't get the sell price higher than 25 caps.
---
Its all good dude. You still need a gatling gun?
---
They have mod-support on Elder Scrolls Online, without the need for private servers, so most likely we will get official mod support here too. They just need to get the server codes stabilized so they can guarantee they wont break the mods (which happens regularly now, but is easy to update and fix). 
---
There is also a mod now that fixes the broken workbenches we got after the last patch.   
---
;-)
---
I bought one from the vendor in Welch and found another in a safe
---
It'll Def feel like you got aids. That's for sure.
---
Why?
---
Which system?
---
Nope, all weight reduction caps at 90%. This is true for any combination of weight reduction gear and perks. The only exception is weightless gear, because that specifically affects the weight of the item and does not contribute to the umbrella reduction. If you have a weightless weapon and a full set of weapon weight reduction armor, that weapon will weigh 1% of its base weight and 10% of any mods it has attached
---
&gt;Then why can I only find ballistic fibers at the vendors?
---
Most of them have bulk fiber for 270-300 depending on your perks. I buy it all the time because it's faster than server hopping to find places that haven't been picked clean.
---
I have a TSE Western and a TSE Laser Rifle. Western may have less damage on paper but with resistances and fire rate factored in Laser Rifles are hands down much worse. Not using any pistol perks, not even damage, my Western 2 shots almost everything when I'm in sneak. My Laser Rifle WITH Full Rifle perks and sneak damage takes 5 - 8 shots on most things and is literally more useless then an unarmed punch against robots and blast zone creatures. You can look at damage stats all you want, it doesn't represent how a weapon will actually perform compared to another weapon of different damage type.
---
To put it in perspective. If you have fought a high level Gutsy shooting you with bullets you know how much they can hurt. Hell, in some cases we even fear them when there are 2 or 3 cause they can kill you rather quickly even in power armor. Can you say the same about the ones that shoot lasers? No. The damage is crap and no one cares about them, most people don't even remember that they even exist in the game. No one fears anything that uses a laser based weapon, hell I was running around Watoga at lvl 12 without a care in the world because the robots shoot lasers and do no damage. Just had to stay away from the assaultrons &gt;\_&gt; they mean.
---
Sweet bro moment guys!
---
These are all absolutely essential if you ask me, also lowered weapons is fantastic.
---
Remember the days when people just played games until they got better at them? When did this entitled "ittsssss tooo haaaaarrrdddddd change it please" mentality come from? Jesus have some self-respect.
---
I may have an extra BOS Officer one... I’ll be on in about an hour...
---
\&gt;  With proper strategy it's not a hard boss. Honestly the problem with this boss is that you get very little prep time compared to the SBQ. 
---
Of course. 
---
\&gt; The optimal build part assumes any of the adds get near me. Demo expert most certainly benefits my explosive shotgun.   Honestly I should've been throwing grenades out to proc Adrenaline 
---
I was thinking that too, (and I love my pulse/nuke mines/grenades). However you clearly can avoid the adds if you're solo, as they're very slow-- or in the case of tesla weapons they proc on everything. I love Demo expert but it got nerfed to hell, and doesn't really benefit the shotty that much. 
---
Really though, for this boss you'd probably be better off with a furious combat shotty with +vats ideally. Maybe troubleshooters + vats damage on your build.
---
Btw for vats crits builds: Near that location (all around the ash heap really), just east (a little bit north of the train tracks on the trees) of the Lewisberg station there's lots of blight, which cooks into blight soup for an additional +20% crit damage. 
---
\&gt; . Everyone just seems to jump into PA and go melee the boss. 
---
I usually see the opposite, PA users avoiding boss, and armor users punching and dying to boss. . . and me being coinduit supreme taking all the pylons because all the others are ignorant/dumb/dead. 
---
That said, it is quite possible to melee the boss, even as a bloodied build (although significantly more difficult as conduit supreme), even in PA. Emergency protocols, blocker, suppressor (perk), and LW (if solo). Ideally in team, a teammate has empath, but its not that important. The boss doesn't really do too much. It is the conduit and lag that really kill (and my electrically charged mutation proc'ing, I really need to get rid of it while bloodied).
---
Refractor perk may help too. Honestly though, a prepared player is going to have an easy time regardless. These are just some of the methods.
---
Thats the one that shot the exploding fireballs right? if so I agree...shocked it wasnt in this either
---
why two? Dont they both have the same stats?
---
When you'll neee it to do future raids, it's p2w. Easy as that. And seeing how fast stuff breaks in the game and how they timed the release, it's certainly p2w.
---
Oh darn, sorry for that, Imma edit the post, Hahahaha, for PC.
---
Yes, used to have 60 fps near 24/7 and now, without changing any video settings since the last few patches it's gone to 30-20 fps with bad texture pop in and lighting issues.
---
For gaining an unfair advantage?
---
Yes they do, just like high level weapons. Found a level 1 bloodied hunting rifle the other day. low level legendary ghouls and creatures are spawned to match the players’ levels.
---
How?
---
Same. Only problems I have are that high-level baddies occasionally like to fuck with me but overall it's a pretty peaceful area with lovely views and a nice little pond.
---
Post your character's name.
---
The three lvl 3 safes in Pleasant Hills Cemetery (near Lewisburg) often contain plans for uncommon weapons...
---
I was in there once and every single ghoul spawn was a level 1 diseased Eyebot.
---
Highlight what you want locked ex:door go to modify on the left of your options it’ll say lock, hit corresponding button to choose your lock
---
Ah that must be scaling with your vats crit build somehow. I'm receiving far less from medics weapons.
---
I understand. I’m currently rebuilding my Heavy Gun Tank because I completely jacked up his perks. I’d have to level from 115-157 just to fix all of him, so I’m just new gaming it.
---
If interested try out https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/   I make my build in that, then every time I level up from 1-50 I open up my screenshot and pick the specials I need, and try to get a perk card in that build too. Much better.
---
Also, depending on your inventory and weapons, choosing weight reduction may be better than +50 carry weight. For example if you have 4 heavy weapons that are 20lbs each, choosing bear arms frees up more than 50 lbs. if you carry 100 stims, radaway, rad-x, or other chems like I do, (50stims, 20 buffout, 20 med-ex, 20 psycho, 50 radaway, and 10 rad-x) then running chem weight reduction again frees up more than 50 lbs. I used to run the strong back perk too, but found swapping it for weight reduction is usually better, depending on play-style. 
---
Without  PA, always run ultra-light over carry weight on armor, especially using heavy combat armor for instance. On top of the weight reductions being greater than the carry weight increase in most cases, you get an AP bonus too. Also, look for legendary armor with +STR.
---
I’ll craft as many as you want, I can craft them all now after last night if you have the supplies AND would like to give a little more of those supplies to me... no cap charge... 
---
Ingredients are harder to come by since less nuke zones...
---
That would be "Lamont Cranston"
---
Starched Genesis sounds awesome 😎 wish there was a serum for that 👍
---
Oh why thank you but I don't need the underarmor just the lining. I have plans for the the officer suit and the shielded plans for it, I just don't have all the linings for casual armor also I'm on Xbox.
---
PSSST
---
*I think they were being sarcastic*
---
Hey, at least we're only a month or so away from the delivery of... a delay in the arrival if the replacement canvas bags.
---
So they actually get SOMETHING for PAE.    While still just being a jab at what they did. 
---
It’s still a bait and switch and no one’s gotten bags yet. So they’re gonna need to do -something-  when that 6month mark passes
---
If you get the ingredients I’ll make what ever mutations you want for a little extra ingredients, let me know.
---
Maybe 200 since it's a minor aesthetic change that you can go days without seeing
---
900 hours guy had over 300,000 of ultracite ammo between two characters, plus well over 200,000 of other various ammos he accumulated in under 30 days.
---
Yeah, try various social networks (discords, subreddits, facebook even), and gl with the grind. I hear watoga's good, but I prefer supermutant areas myself.
---
Had a similar issue. Turned out it was wall decorations. YMMV.
---
The other day when I was server hopping at Creekside Sundew Grove for the legendary enemy fissure challenge I had a megasloth spawn after about 6 hops. I'll probably hop there for this one.
---
I bet you they give you nothing. I’ll save this post for your rage later on.
---
Yes. Please.
---
With the 200% repair perk its quadruple durability!
---
I used to be a rifleman but switched to the camp Gatling gun because it does more damage and the ammo is much cheaper than a .45, and it's more satisfying to shoot. Got rid of all of my other weapons (except melee and a pipe gun for low tier enemies) and I'm at a solid 140lbs out of 230 at all times unless I get rid of some more ammo. 
---
It's the only thing that allows me to shoot a scorchbeast compared to rifles, which are a huge pain to deal with if running a primary sniper rifle or combat rifle. Probably not going back, it isn't worth it right now (also the weight is almost identical to a fully upgraded combat rifle, so not much difference there)
---
Ty.
---
Sending you a request in a few minutes from SoleSurvivorABS.
---
👍
---
Let me check, I’ll let you know what I have for linings, I have a few different ones of those as well.
---
check under the misc tab. i found out that i had over 80 pounds of gunpowder the one time, so i've been crafting ammo that is weightless with my perks and legendaries. also tokens are 10 per pound which can add up.
---
Oh I see, it’s just so he doesn’t have to repair them as often
---
Might be for modding/repairing the upcoming camera. They mentioned having to craft film for it too.
---
Allright! Thanks! Let's clear some wasteland punks together!
---
Except for when you collect enough junk that Bethesda thinks that you're duping and exploiting and kills off your mule, or the person you use to transfer it has something happen. 
---
You're more likely to lose a mule account than I am to lose my junk permanently doing what I have been. It's a game man, im not stressing about it. I've lost all my junk only 3 times since game was released. 
---
But you do you.
---
Sounds like you were still under the influence of the shower when you removed starched.
---
Is alive as ever, any hour of the day there are tons of people playing.
---
Not really, I meant it like they should make the 50 cal LMG able to shoot both 50 cal and 308 (Receiver plans). And make 308, 5.56 and all the others more or less on the same level of crafting requirements as 50 cal and 5mm.
---
But what if it was Ricardo's ass?
---
Because they need a money sink otherwise the game would be piss easy.
---
Funny, i just lost around 2000 caps in junk by falling through visible but unusable geometry, dying inside a mountain. I'd have tried to get my stuff(*) if it wasn't for the 5 minute loaing screen after which i was already dead again. Sprinkle some 10sec freezes and lags on top and there you have it: perfectly normal bethesda experience!
---
(*) I also once died on a flat surface to discover my stuff floating in the air at 10m, unreachable - so there was hope it would've teleported to the top of the cliff.
---
Mhm. ONE successful retrieval. Placed my PA into the fissure, stood on it, grabbed my bag. These days, I maintain better situational awareness.
---
Oh, I read it wrong. I was talking about price reduction for buying going to 30%, you were talking about selling selling. Yes, you're correct.
---
So wait, am I a moron for running around wearing whatever mix match of armor I can get so long as it has decent legendary effects?
---
Ah I see, I was told they were all the same so I have been only trying charlie
---
You're getting downvoted, but you're not wrong. It's highly likely that some of these will need to be purchased and not just found
---
I'm glad no is interested in leather armor. It was pretty cheap to get all my gear. But it's also hard to find, cause no one keeps good leather pieces
---
Those who got them from the dev room now have a 100 lb paper weight Lmao
---
Yeah, it's too bad there isn't some easy, real world device that holds multiple bullets at once...
---
Lol. I feel ya bro
---
Was trying to get all the Responder logs for the Atoms, saw Miguel's listed as 'on the building by the truck on the raised end of town'. Took it literally and went up the hill to try to get on the roof. I missed the jump and went splat.
---
It's on the porch at street level. I'm an idiot.
---
And if it's a common drop you can't even trade it since low levels don't have the caps to buy it for a reasonable price (most plans for camp items I would not take less then 50 caps for) or higher levels already own
---
I think I saw a graph with max Chrisma and HARD Bargain and the player was only selling items at 25% value to.vendors.
---
Add to that the low prices are meant to make the player trading more attractive. BUT the are so many hindrances to that as well: 1) only 23 other possible buyers per map 2) the mixed levels make the buying pool even smaller due to high levels not caring about lvl5 items 3) fast travel cost to get to a prospective buyer 4) the trade mechanics are terrible and 5) the communication barriers are bad as well.
---
I gave up trading and just basically scrap everything because it's near impossible and cost prohibitive to trade.
---
Rumbly
---
It's definetly by design
---
Hopping around with marsupial works wonders! Make sure you use Serendipity as well. I run a semi-Bloodied build and I find myself doing like 5% of its hp a punch!
---
Pc user, the hotfix did not help. The stuttering  is still there along with the freezing when loading in.
---
Got any assasins maxlvl armor?
---
I didn't see anyone post about that. This is in regards to base stats. 3* legendary BOS chest &gt; 3* wood chest
---
Alright thank you. I have 3/5 for casual linings just find the other ones which I saw all the time before a couple of patches ago.
---
Hell yes. I want the DKS-501 back in this game so badly. Loved that gun in the previous games and the FO4 mod that added it was great.
---
He's talking about the imposter mod for assaultron head
---
Sent you a friend request. Join my world if it's ok for you.
---
What do you mean arguments based on facts? There is no solid evidence, people saying that they are getting less legendaries does not prove anything, I have been getting more legendaries since the patch, but that doesnt mean they have secretly buffed it. And yes, bethesda does make changes that are not listed in the patch notes, but you have to open your eyes and realize that people are coming on here and crying about the secret nerfs but dont come on here to talk about the secret buffs
---
I play PC.
---
IGN: MortisCorpus 
---
I have all of the serum recipes and I craft for the materials required.  Meaning, bring me the materials after making contact and I will make them for you at no cost other than required supplies.
---
I aim, to please.
---
That’s scary and outrageous. Did those happen after the latest patch? He didn’t sell them by mistake? I lost a piece of three star armor and was flaming mad, but later found out I transferred it to my mule by accident 🤮
---
make all your floors atom shop floors cept for the one square you want to spawn in make that a normal concrete or wood foundation ...you will spawn there
---
Will do
---
Actually one has a higher durability meter then the other but I just keep two since they only weigh 3lbs and since it breaks so often
---
No that vendor only carries Excavator Armour plans not the X-01 ones unfortunately.
---
They gonna have refrigerated backpacks too that make your stuff last longet
---
Balance. When you're level 1, frsh out of the vault, it wouldn't make sense for you to have BOS armor when you're supposed to be fighting molerats and lvl 1 scorched.
---
Honestly. It would be preferable to a shitty jab at them not caring.  I don’t care either way.    But I just think I’d be funny for them to joke about how shitty the PAE was
---
Did it drop a drill or syringer, because if it did, thats the 0* legendary for you
---
What you got?
---
Done that a few times myself, heh.
---
How's that beef treatin' ya? Games still shit btw.
---
Source?
---
Honestly its survival mode, u need  to survive.  I plan for them shooting me and I find a spot so I can shoot them first. May not be 'fair' but survival is as survival is.
---
Maybe they boosted the drops in Lewisburg? I had 3 drops in one spawn from there and another 2 when another player came through.
---
It's not the fall that gets you. It's that sudden stop at the end.
---
Oh no i mean like, i get that part, but why dont most armor and weapons /go/ to max level instead of just stopping at 45
---
Just a guess, but I think the problem is that you're trying to play a massively data-intense game using WiFi.
---
They do spawn grenades in the grenade box just not gernades.
---
Ah, gotcha.  I thought I was about to have to craft a whole set of armor when I get online!
---
Like mentioned, when legendaries are involved either hit it once, or if you'll kill it, let the lower players get a hit. In places like Whitesprings after a nuke drop, I put on my wear weapons (does about 80% damage to ghouls) and just run around punching things at full life. Then I let the lower levels or people with heavy guns finish the job.
---
I want that knight paint yo
---
I get what you are saying.   People will always find exploits I know.   I'm just a bit bummed out by what happened,  you know?
---
Reminds me what Fable did for when you died.
---
A friend has this problem, I can log in to his account on my PC with no issues.  Tried repairing, uninstall and reinstall. He ended up going back to fallout 4.
---
I might agree with you, but I had no issues or bugs remotely like this until the update on the ninth.  For clarification, I've been playing since launch in November.
---
Consider that the problem may at least in part be on your end. 
---
I've been dropped from the server once or twice in the past month.
---
they were +105 carry weight. Any existing backpacks were changed to being called "junk", had their carry weight bonus removed and now weigh 100lb
---
Being able to bulk them and then sell them like junk would be great, even if one bulk of 50 ammo would go for a cap.
---
Reduved weight could also be a benefit.
---
I mean... if you're getting rid of her i'll take her. I'll pay for shipping too if it helps.
---
It puts eagle eyes on your character.
---
Did uninstall / reinstall fix anything?
---
Pro tip, beyond refractor (per perk) for ER, the Ghoulish (Endurance) perk works against these lasers. Those things actually heal me with ghoulish on, because the assaultron lasers produce radiation (that procs ghoulish).
---
Other than that, suppressors, lone wanderer, and straight up melee'ing it works.
---
I haven't fought it yet, but i'm hoping that one man army at max will help.
---
The chance to get a drill or wood leg pieces has been greatly enhanced lately. 
---
Let’s rebuild America, one drill at a time. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/KfueGrz
---
Nope
---
I would probably just use it to show off my base. Its in the middle of no where but built into the environment. I cant wait for player vending "come on in to the devils backbone bar and inn. We have great views of SBQ nukes and even better deals! Located just east of huntersville. Just follow the road down the hill you cant miss it!" 😂
---
Just like the lore reasoning for the cryolator being in 76.
---
Now that you mention it I’ve noticed that when I first start the game I will load into a world and after ten minutes or so the game will disconnect from the server. The second time everything runs ok and I can often play for hours no problem. I wonder what’s going on.
---
I love the new system, players every where on the map. Pew pew you dead*looks at map* let's fast travel there. Alright will I die or them
---
It did drop a syringer. Did not know that was a thing? Has it always been that way?
---
Was this your first time doing the event?
---
If you hover over it, it should say who placed it. Find the right one.
---
It would be nice if it did that, unfortunately it instantaneously disconnects me for dozens of attempts before I can even get that ten minute window.
---
If you have an extra violet you can spare. I never seem to be around for the queen fights.
---
Well use blessing of sanctuary it cut threat generated by 30%
---
Before fireproof and dense armor mods, scorchbeast attacks are energy (and explosive) that wreck early level players. Crafting a level 20 set like the above is a big deal for lower level players. 
---
That said, some people like more balanced stats, and things like radiation resist. . . and some people just like cosmetics/aesthetics of different sets.
---
1. Do not fear death. When you die, you’ll respawn right there. 
---
2. Activate the pylons. Nobody seems to want to do this, but somebody has to or you can’t damage the thing and the event will fail. 
---
3. Don’t waste stims. Use them when you’re a pylon conduit, not if you aren’t. When one of the conduits goes down, revive them. Goes along with #1.
---
4. Try to have somebody there with a Cryolator. They can hit the sheepsquatch and freeze it. 
---
5. Ignore the adds as much as possible. They’re a distraction. Even if you kill them all, more will come. Focus on activating the pylons and killing the sheepsquatch.
---
Doesn’t work if your camp station isn’t on ground level unfortunately. I did and I keep spawning outside of my perimeter. :(
---
If you're on Xbox you can go to recent players and it will show the two people that were standing next to you. You can join off them.
---
All I want is the backpack. Ive got several backpack mods for FO4, Love backpacks as a whole.
---
Same for me at chr 4 so I guess 2300 is the base price
---
Yeah the ammo is a bit of a bitch to make, furious is sorta irrelvent though. Whilst the damage isnt terrible, it's the rads you want and it doesnt increase it. Personally im trying to get hold of a quad, but quad gamma guns appear to be about as rare as hen's teeth
---
FO76 has tons of problems with NVIDIA cards. I've seen some cases on Steam boards where after looking into things some 1080i's were not even doing their jobs and lag was caused by the core processor hitting 99%. I've tinkered with game specific 3D setting in the control panel as well as got GForce experience working properly. Most of my lag went away after doing all of that.
---
hmm gotcha didnt know that
---
What did you do that you got that though?
---
Explosive and armor piercing level 50
---
Casual may be the same as raider. Those linings are easy to find. Try top of the world.
---
Where you based? Let me calculate that
---
whenever I’ve seen it the area still rad nuked flora versions of all plants so my guess is it has something to do with the section resetting and getting interrupted before it does with someone else showing up
---
I believe the next quest segment  is Back to Basic.

I haven't ever had this thought until this very post, and now it seems so obvious
---
WTF isn't Bethesda adding song packs? Id definitely pay for this!
---
Consider me converted :)
---
Few people are interested because they know the loot is guaranteed to be poor. Farming at WS is way more rewarding.
---
atoms become a trickle after a while and you can't buy caps for real cash. you're completely changing the argument.
---
If you are a conduit for a pylon, make sure you are not being focused, your hp is too important since staying alive as a conduit is needed to remove the stealth, if your not a conduit, equip blocker so that the melee attacks dont destroy you instantly, marsupial jumping is a big help to dodge the laser
---
Bug, if your bag drops too close to anything like a crafting station or a container you wont be able to access it. Happened to me a few times.
---
What system are you using?
---
Why would this be a feature
---
Can confirm from my own experience. Windowed Borderless also solved a microphone issue I had in 2018 with FO76
---
Id pay it
---
rad-phobia would have to be if less than 5% rads or something, otherwise it would be pretty terrible
---

What console are you on?I can craft you a shit ton of rifles to scrap, or just craft a rifle for you
---
&gt; BOS, Metal, or Leather 
---
Of course, desireable legendary &gt; armor type &amp; level. What's that? A level 20 sentinel light leather piece? Yes please. I'll take that over a level 50 vanguard/bolstering piece with lockicking.
---
You shouldn’t have went.. Its not a once in a life time event, should have gone after you had felt with your junk.
---
Sorry for your loss, but it is truly your fault to begin with..
---
You got it! Add me and we can connect and I’ll give it to ya. I’m not on a ton, but I might be on tonight for a bit after my kids go down and before GoT tonight.
---
Yes it has always been that way, im assuming that either they made a mistake and put non-legendary items in the possible loot or they made a mistake that is causing those items to have no legendary effects
---
That's funny cause I give those away to low levels.
---
If you don’t mind the poor loot just want to roam a wasteland, it’s a fun solo game.
---
They’re different. Casual is stuff like flannel shirt, vault jumpsuit. Raider is raider/road leathers, harness, etc. Responders sell casual, raider vendors sell raider.
---
No, Legendary effects &gt; armor type. 
---
Example: Full troubleshooter gear vs sheepsquatch / missile silos / watoga &gt; full heavy armor with useless legendary mods for that area.
---
I don't mind if my camp can't be placed, I normally like to check out whoever is in my spot and see what they built.
---
Happened to me at SBQ twice this weekend, this game is a fucking joke.
---
I did the same thing jumping off a cliff near Top of the World.

---
I'm tired of the phantom weight, it's back. And yes I checked my misc for gunpowder, ore , nuclear key cards , checked notes for plans , I carefully went through my entire inventory. It is alphabetical, makes it real easy when you know what you're looking for. Any time I loot the SBQ too quickly, because I know it will disappear if I don't , I get an extra 10-15 pounds of phantom weight. If I log out and log in a while later , it goes away. This has been consistent for me since patch 8
---
lolwut
---
Please explain. I can't wait
---
Grounded dramatically lowers energy weapon damage, Copper Veins i feel would be nearly the opposite. a little something for everyone who says energy weapons are trash
---
all of those listed above are pre-class freak, so with Rad-phobia would be only +5% with class freak lowering it by 75%
---
I made a thread about wanting a new animation the other day. But I want like, the behind the lock animation changed. Seeing my gun pointed at the door behind the lock is so immersion breaking for me for some reason. Just make me be holding the screwdriver, or something.
---
Agreed, the only way I'd be able to solo it is with a bloodied power fist or some other ridiculous weapon putting out close to 1000 damage.
---
My arms.
---
My queen group used to run all day every day but it died down when they patched the silo glitch.
---
Lowest it goes to is 1750 with 25 CHR or a combination of high CHR + Hard Bargain.
---
Why would you go to a vendor with thousands of caps worth of junk, when they only have 1400 caps. A 500 stack of ultracite would have probably been 1000 caps at the very least. 
---
And then you go to a boss event? You could have just walked into a fissure if you were looking to lose everything. Weird post.
---
Problem is some energys are already crazy strong. Flamers and gatling lasers can do pretty insane damage already. And the energy resist loss isnt really that relevant
---
I have a Bloodied one.. I like to take it to Whitesprings and watch the ghouls run into it and explode on impact.
---
Right now my main weapons I like are my vampire Gatling gun, my baseball bat with bloodied and some other stuff, which is a heated rocket all star with the whiffle bat skin I named pinky, it’s technically the 2.0 cuz I got the legendary bat for cheap at a vendor which replaced my old one (same level, 45), an executioner pump action shotgun, all rise (the super sledge with 90% reduced weight), a recon (and other upgrades) 10 mm pistol I mainly use on low level stuff, blade of Bastet, and the special gun from the mistress of mystery quest. I have a lot of variety I guess
---
Hey mate just curious, how much fucking damage do you do?
---
Yeah dude, you screwed up by going there with all your junk, not the games fault.
---
It was in Beta and removed for whatever reason. We discussed this a few times here on Reddit way back but nobody had a solid hypothesis, I recall reading 'If there's fast travel mats, visitors will travel and be placed in evil traps!' and thinking that's the best reasoning we have available. If someone knows or the Beth community guys can shed some light, I'd really love to hear it :)
---
Hmh felt like it was working better than ever last time I tried it.

I have a camp set up where folks can have a drink and a chat, I have a boxing ring setup so we can have fights to burn off tension. Raiders are called raiders by their victims mainly, you have to remember that raiders also do other things, like any one else. Some raiders sure, they like to rape and pillage, some don’t. Some are guilty by association. Look at Carol Sweeney, who didn’t have it in her after Charleston, so she retired to Big Bend Tunnel with some other folks and started a community that was accepted by the Brotherhood of Steel. Was she a mindless griefer? I’m certainly not. Though I do have a road block setup where I expect a toll paid for safe passage... but that’s just entrepreneurial!
---
I don’t have any faith in the Brootherhood, or the Responders, the Enclave put us in this mess to begin with. I’m not hiding in a whole like those Free States survivalist cowards though. I want to be free, to do whatever I want, and if that makes me a raider then a raider I am.
---
Will I be decorating my camp with skulls and corpses when possible? Hell yes.
---
You probably got stuck in a loading screen because it took several seconds for the others to empty your paper bag.
---
“Balance”
---
Did it for the first time last night..we completed it..but what a convoluted-mess if an event that was
---
I know tge mg42 got a buff, but I got rid of mine so idk what alls different. I think the grenade rifle needs one. Its probably the weakest explosive weapon you can get. 
---
For memes I wanna say the alien blaster. It doesnt need to be fallout 3 levels of op, but its really really underwhelming, especially with the ammo conversion. Maybe other energy weapons as well.
---
i do see your point on that front. perhaps i can lower it to 30% instead of 50%
---
Let’s be real. In the real apocalypse, we’d be breaking those damn vending machines apart and looting that shit! Those bug me haha. I agree, how does a machine like that take caps?
---
The positive effects are +4 perception and +25% critical damage, with strange in numbers, it is +5 perception and +32% critical damage, the negative effect is -4 strength, with maxed class freak, it is -1 strength
---
I personally don’t think becoming rich from selling ammo is a bad thing. Every game of Fallout I’ve ever played my main strat is to keep all ammo regardless if I use it or not, and I get a lot of caps from it. But a lot of things in the game that I consider essential take up the most of what I buy, like stims and radaway. I mean, even with the highest better sales price perk stims still cost around 80 caps a piece in 76.
---
Not really only requires 5 pieces of sentinel armor of any type don't even need to have secondary effects just sentinels. With that you don't even need stimpacks:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcvvmy/encryptid_event_solo_guidetips/
---
Hopefully I don't have to try that, but thanks for the tip😂
---
Ive heard some people say it shares the same coding that the tighter headwear like the marine tactical helmet uses. I know absolutely nothing about that world or anything to do with coding, bugs, and fixes but id have to imagine it cant be too hard to fix how the wrapped cap works :(
---
Your kind of people being " middle aged, middle class, white and male " ?
---
Gather a crew..more than 4 ppl
---
People in this subreddit fully admited they paid for that gear specifically becausr of that buff. So no you are wrong about no one paying for that advantage
---
I had a similar experience in Survival this week. I hope they include more rewards/challenges like this that encourage a variety of play styles.
---
I’m totally cool with Survival having zero restrictions, but it’s boring if it’s nothing but a death match.
---
I shit on this game and Bethesda a lot for being incompetent developers in general, but this is the one thing people need to stop demanding.
---
Licensing music costs a fuck-ton, and it wouldn't be realistic at all monetarily for Bethesda to license more music. Not to mention, the audio filetype they use is inefficient as shit, and would bloat the file size even more.
---
The only viable alternative would be public domain music nobody wants to hear, or some sort of partnership with a music streaming platform like Spotify for an official station, which would again probably cost more than it is worth to implement.
---
The radio demand is dumb and people should give it up already.
---
Amusing,  the French army use "anime-style" rifles,  (PGM Hecate 2, aka the AMR from FO:NV).
---
That could be, kind of weird they'd use it instead of the weapons work bench.
---
Maybe has something to do with where we are in the timeline.  The Enclave could've invented it later on or may the Institute did.
---
Lol!!
---
Not been the case for me, crashed during sheep and SBQ events multiple times and not once ended up back on the same server.
---
Ya, I’m not seeing as many these days, even before encryptid was released.
---
Yeah, was a very fun gun, id of loved to have one to have fun with in this game.
---
Oh yea the grenade rifle, I forgot about that thing. Yea that is in my opinion one of the coolest looking weapons in the game and If I could I would make a build around it. Too bad it sucks.
---
No, actually
---
I got some weird event the other day near the ranger station in cranberry bog, something about the sensus was off so the only way to make it right is murder? Went there and it wouldn’t trigger just the marker on the map
---
I have 
---
zealots leather Armor level 5 and another level 40.
---
Vangards robot left leg level 40
---
I have lodes to sell just pop bye pal
---
That's all? I thought I had to pump her full lol
---
&gt;balanced around PVP 
---
Bahahahaha. Sorry man, but PVP is only available to ultra cheese builds that think vats crits or unlimited strength damage. Shotguns? No. Heavy weapons? No. Power armor? No. 
---
If you're not vats pistol/rifle or one handed melee, you're in an entirely different class of PVP. It's embarrassing how easily my team mates kill my PA medic build, even with massively damage boosted TSE or instigating shotguns. There's literally no hope.
---
I'm working on getting the elder paint. Gathering like 100+ tech data on my alt that hasn't done the quest, then xfering them to my main one at a time at the turn in lol.
---
+4 perception..which is great but I can't deal with the -4 strength
---
Hoarder + neanderthal + twisted muscles + radicool = crazy melee and carry weight
---
The one true scientist of the wasteland.
---
&gt; No, man. I know exactly what I'm doing. I just don't know what effect it's going to have. Over there controls power in this building. That station has readouts on the computer network. That big knob there makes a crazy noise. Sparks come out of that slot if you put stuff in it. And I'm learning more every day.
---
-- Fantastic.
---
Yes! If... Our costumes cover it
---
Perks I’ve found useful when I’m being a conduit are:
---
Robotics Expert - why not get the robots to fight for you instead of killing them. 
---
First Aid - duh
---
BORN SURVIVOR RANK 1 - This is a must have and the lower the rank the better since the stimpack it injects seems to be on steroids when healing you. 
---
Mysterious Survivor - keeps you alive if you make a mistake
---
Quack Surgeon and EMT - Help others survive while preserving your stimpacks. 
---
Basic strategy. Take over 1 to 2 conduits. Tag the boss a couple times when possible. Otherwise hang back from the main fight. Inject stimpacks all the time. Hack Gutsy’s while shooting off the eyebombs before they get close. If you do this, you will never fail the fight so long as others kill the boss, and everyone else will always just want to kill the boss, so go in committing to this and you’ll win.
---
The general thought on the alien blaster is we could be alien invasions at some point so more better weapons could be coming.
---
Also how bought they make a note of what server you're on and try not to load you into the same server 5x in a row, lol. So So annoying.
---
Scorched earth events are pretty stable these days, from my experience.
---
If you're on a PC, restart it. That fixed the problem for me.
---
Dude... This is all YOUR fault.
---
Also the crossbow is one, just give it some mods like different frames, scopes, and bolt types. Any weapon that doesn't have any or has hardly any mods
---
Changes look good. Sadly, after trying to come back to the game it now crashes shortly after entering build mode.
---
Pistols
---
No it hasn’t been until yesterday
---
English please.
---
If you move your camp module to the opposite side of where it is. Should fix your spawning.
---
BAR was originally a .30-06, not .308 (7.62x51mm).  I know it is semantics, but it irks me and I can't help it.
---
Yes I do agree! Very different from fasnacht but I like it! Very intense!
---
My sincerest apologies, I didn't realise how much the use a wrong flair would make people cranky. I corrected it for you. I hope I didn't ruin your day too much xx
---
I know bro. This shit honestly pisses me off
---
I have a neighbor at my spot too, but I haven't seen him in a while. I wonder if he moved. :(
---
I plan on dropping off pies next time he's over there lol.
---
Quality of gear mostly.
---
i can see Hoarder being one of the go-to mutations if it is ever added
---
My favourite armour aesthetically is the Trapper armour. I love the backpack on that set. I'd love a full Trapper themed backpack.
---
I picked mine up in Welch as I recall
---
All the modifiers from modding. Drum mag on everything sucks, make the penetrating, Bush damage, junkies, etc. Be worth using
---
I have been sitting on piles of junk because my stash is overflowing and I can't unload it all even after days of vendoring. If I died and someone took my bag it would suck but be ultimately my fault. Losing my stuff because I disconnected while respawning is my main gripe. Being stuck with all this junk all week because I have no real way to unload it was tolerable if I knew I could just keep it and sell it eventually, but losing to a disconnect is too much. I will come back later once that is fixed.
---
I think the crossbow should have more stealth befits, maybe increasing its sneak attack damage would be nice.
---
The endangerol stringer also helps a lot
---
Right... Having the junk weight reduced armor means you can take off your pack rat perk and use those points for something else.
---
Agreed. I have a double shot ultracite gun and I would love to use them if it would do more base damage (and if I would get a plan for it to turn it into a rifle)
---
If you can, do the quest
---
It’s odd.... when I do decide to stay on the server and I go back to my original location it’s quite rare to see a camp there - even in its vicinity.  Makes me wonder why it couldn’t be placed.
---
Damn. That seems like a worse issue than this
---
Sure. I should have not disconnected. Trust me, it is not happening again.
---
Tf I got this today but I’ve never duped, hacked cheated or anything like tht
---
Turing test passed ✓
---
Yes sir
---
I have a prototype hazmat suit that never has its durability go down lol
---
Yea I get it a guy wanted all my junk, probably about 600 pounds worth and we teamed up to trade. A guy his friend I presume attacked him and then attacked me for my junk. Lost all of it but I didn’t really care it was just junk
---
I want to see this!
---
Now if they could fix my inventory sorting back, that'd be great. 😅
---
Nope I just login 24 hrs from the last day which I did most or all challenges.
---
Yea I could see that happening, the alien blaster is so ridiculously bad that Bethesda must have done it on purpose so it would make sense for them to have more planned around it.
---
Can you help out to update or how do we keep getting this info for the wiki?
---
This. I no longer search for "fallout 76 \[issue\]" just "fo76 \[issue\]"
---
Weird things have been happening.  I got a Wasteland Wanderer paintjob for my T-51b PA the other day.  Wasn't able to find it in the store.  And when I replaced the torso yesterday, it wouldn't give me the option to repaint it with that paint job.
---
Dude... There is a .308 LMG in the game. The .50 Cal is NOT an LMG(in the game).
---
Fair enough, I dont use pistols but Ive played around a lot and never seen a high lvl using one.
---
why are you being downvoted to oblivion lol. I don’t see anything wrong with your comments, I mean sure you’re assuming but It honestly makes sense that they could do this. 
---
maybe backpack skins, but if they are willing to break their terms and add non-cosmetics is it really wrong to assume repair kits won’t be the only thing they stop at?
---
Mods bought from vendors are currently broken
---
Someone would have taken your stuff anyways. I never understand why people carry tons of junk on them especially bulk into events.
---
The asking if you want to destroy the current mod is just a confirmation (whether there is one on or not) that you want to apply the external mod and is just a feature to prevent accidentally modding your items
---
The not being able to attach those mods is a bug with a lot of items right now and seems only the mod plans have any lenience right now rather than attaching the external ones
---
Posted something like this on day 1 of the new patch. Everyones a bunch of babies and like to pvp with no risk apparently
---
Yea it seems there's only a small pool of good effects out of an ocean of bad ones.
---
I think part of the issue isn't that you percieve the value of an item to be minimum of 50 caps, but for me, I won't get out of bed for less than 50 caps. 
---
If you're trying to buy three dog food from me, go home. If you're trying to buy 60 (even if it is less caps/can) lets start talking prices. 
---
I don't think players will be willing to pay much for crappy plans, which still makes them a crappy award. I think I've recieved 4 trash can plans in the last 4 events, and I wish it was at least something I could sell to a vendor for 10 caps.
---
Multiple people that "farm" do nothing more than run around looking for enemies with LEGENDARY above their head without actually killing shit otherwise.  AGAIN if you could read it has been WIDELY reported since the last patch that "regular" enemies have been dropping legendary loot, i.e. the spontaneous legendary robots that pop up in Watoga are still there, you're just walking right past them because it doesn't have a big "KILL ME I DROP GOOD SHIT" over their heads.
---
Oh hell yes. I hate being encumbered.
---
Oh geez. I just bought these mods too. How long has this been an issue?
---
I think it’s the “sheer terror” quest line for some reason, I don’t have extra crashes when I just do old things, but in that quest line I crash out at least once on each section and my friend has had the same.
---
That's unfortunate. Thanks for the info
---
Bethesda should just give us a TSE when we leave the vault.
---
Sounds like those two players were ready to loot your stuff.  I don't think you were getting it back even if you made it back on the server
---
Had you spawned the event or did you join it?
---
I spawned one this morning and that happened to me :(
---
This sucks most the time if i leave a lobby it was for a reason
---
Yeah, I've gotten the helmet myself but there's been multiple reports of people getting the assaultron weapon sheep skin from the datamine. Sorry for the confusion
---
As I was reading through your title, I was thinking "Come here and it will make sense."  Then I got to the part where you came here and it made sense.
---
There's some subtext in the game about how it all went downhill.   Crooked companies and politicians,  over reliance on coal, automation, etc.  All true to life.
---
What do you mean by not focused, normally when I activate a pylon he zones right on me and kills me
---
Joined. Downed, was about to be revived but mashed the give up button. Then Infinite load screen.  I was bummed because I hadn't seen the event triggered all day, then that happened.
---
Thanks but I have already scraped a butt ton of rifles and was lucky enough to have someone build one for me.
---
Nope only takes any 5 pieces of sentinel armor of any type, then you don't even need stimpacks:
---
Sell it to players
---
While I was on last night, I think one of the Security Protectrons killed the Free States Vendorbot and the Shopping Mall Vendorbot.
---
I signed an affidavit stating it was justified.  I'm sick of hearing 'Serve and protect' every 5 seconds, too.
---
BEAR ARMS
---
I can try it again - I've tried that twice, already, restarting the game, Bethesda launcher, and my PC to no success.
---
Jedi supermutants should drop guaranteed 3 star gear.
---
It was a feature implemented post-launch, so this was probably the easiest way to get it into the game without re-architecting a bunch of stuff.
---
I suspect there are at least two servers involved in getting you into a world: a server that handles allocating players to worlds, and the servers that actually host the worlds. The server that does the allocating isn't hosting the worlds, so it doesn't have the world data loaded - meaning it cannot check if a location has already been occupied. So the allocation server would have to ask the world hosting server "hey, has this location been occupied already" - which is doable, but probably not something they designed for originally.
---
I've been trying to find the things I can contribute to, as a non-data miner. Yesterday I edited the entry for Honey when I realize that it didn't mention brewing, and neatened up the writing a little. Am planning on trying to keep going through consumables and the like.
---
I have one too but I’m also at work. I can’t attach the damn mod because of the bug though.
---
They’re all at the train station vendors for sale at around 1500 caps
---
You have to remember the world in fo76 was far different after the war. Certain technological advances did not occur.
---
I think its because they might kick the current campsite owner out.    I seen enough times where I would get suddenly DCed while in a team and come back some one is on my base.
---
I am have come into the game a bunch of times and seen my camp eating another camp on the same spot.
---
I am very well versed in Fallout lore and raider groups throughout it. But there's a difference between a Raider from a lore standpoint and a Raider game play standpoint. I respect actual thought out RP with backgrounds and in game work to show a story made by players. I'm not knocking that.
---
What you're doing is more akin to the Raiders we've seen in things like the Nuka-World DLC or the Combat Zone, which is nice, it shows thought and respect for the lore. More common than not, though, most Raiders people have been exposed to in Bethesda's Fallout games were pretty much mindless AI just put in place to be vapid douchebags and minor annoyances. That's also what most 76 players see "Raider RP" as being because it's been taken as an excuse for griefers to be vapid douchebags and minor annoyances.
---
You'd almost be better off RP'ing something akin Gunners or a loose semblance of Caesar's Legion. Just calling yourself a Raider is going to get you more flack than friends regardless of your actual Lore Knowledge and work on your own RP simply because of the association already ingrained in the 76 community.
---
But again, once protections are in place to completely remove grief, I think the RP will be brilliant and add to the atmosphere. All the recourse from vapid douchebags and minor annoyances giving the actual RP a bad name will go away.
---
You're forgetting that theres a mutation that gives the player +100 energy resistance anyways. Yeah it might reduce energy damage but if you're roleplaying as a mutant freak like me you gotta have them all.
---
Thought about that but it would require losing perks i have for heavy weapons. So I only carry a Gatling Gun now. It takes a really long time to break.
---
It probably just glitched our or you got there too late
---
Not to mention, they STILL haven't fixed that GODDAMN bulk glitch, the overencumbered respawn glitch is BACK AGAIN SOMEHOW, and now we're getting CTDs like free hot dickings. They either can't even keep their versions straight or merged, and that should be STEP 1 in an online multiplayer game like this. Bethesda is really turning into the next EA.
---
Let me go grab you a cookie. The servers are crap lately. I'm on PS4 and I played for 3 hours a day and have one blue screen into disconnects. No matter what anybody says they have not fixed the server issues.
---
Didn't expect to run into a fellow SAO Abridged fan in r/fo76 of all places. =)
---
Go to the market 76 sub, loads of users sell serums for around 200 caps a pop. Just pick the ones you want.
---
Because people don't like being reminded of possible pay-to-win? They've already broken their cosmetic-only promise, it's the stickied post at the top of the subreddit. I dunno, just being down voted for my skepticism?
---
I like this version, but I think they should also have a version for the way it was.  I'm just got that good yet.. I think this beta survival could be a good transition to hardcore survival mode
---
That's the one that automatically uses a stim pack when you are below 20% percent health, right?
---
for 100% fusion cores the power plants are the fastest, but those are PVP risks. you can craft them.. but it is a little bit expensive requiring 1 of each stable flux for only 1 core. for 25% charged cores watoga's power armor chassis leftover from the BOS. it used to be better. but they nerfed them
---
Player to Mob damage balancing, kinda sucks to have 300+ ballistic and energy damage resistance if the enemy does the exact same amount of damage without the armour equipped. Not to mention player weapon damage output vs enemy damage output seems critically one sided in most cases.
---
Fix your spelling before adding new posts to Reddit
---
Level 2 of bandolier makes 5mm, .38, and .44, weigh 0.00, literally nothing. And all the other ballistic ammo is 90% reduced.
---
Yea like why does my combat Shotgun weigh 20 pounds
---
I like to farm mine at the Powerplants. They give you constant amounts of cores and you can go do other stuff while they make cores for you.
---
Wouldn't that weigh your entire stash? 6*47+3*60?
---
Same, I have only done around 10 of them and have yet to down a event where I did not have to grab 2 to 3 pylons becuse no one else would. It burns alot of stims to do it. I will say out of the few times I have done it there have been players going around giving out their spare peices. I dont know if they are recognizing who burnt a bunch of resources for everyone to complete it or not, but I like to think so.
---
Thats strange. I am using lever action rifle leggie and blooded hunting rifle and TS 10mm automatic pistol for fun and I never really complain about damage (which on vats crit build and sneak is pretty much insane) and carry weight.
---
If I see lower levels (sub 40) trying to grind in an area, I'll just swap to a slightly worse weapon. Then I'll hit things but leave enough HP for them to tag them. Sometimes I'll train a bunch of enemies and keep aggro so it's basically an XP delivery service.
---
It barely takes anything from me (two extra minutes? my armor degrading another pixel?) and I still get all the loot.
---
The biggest exception is if you're doing a timed event and you need to kill everything *now* or it'll fail.
---
Just since this update and chances are it’ll be this coming Tuesday (16th) or the one after that they fix it, otherwise I see the player base dropping temporarily until it’s fixed
---
The fasnacht event had a fair few inconsiderate players too.
---
They would join  and hide in the church throughout the event, never participating but get the reward regardless
---
I’d figure hang out during the sheepsquatch event.
---
I would, but daisycutter and missle lancher are like 20# each...
---
Power stations.  While you are open to pvp, don't get all the workshops and you'll most likely get left alone.   I think it's 12/hour.
---
Thunder Mountain Power Plant’s Workshop, 2-3 cores (100%) every 20-40 minutes
---
Yes!  It is in Misc, so I always forget it too...   had 500+ once.
---
Pretty sure these "mutation syrums" you speak of already exist. Also pretty sure some developer already thought up a "recipe" for them.
---
As I understand it, there may be a window of time where the owner has logged off, but the server still counts the space as reserved. After whatever interval, it updates it as free, but if you hit it just right it gets all Schroedinger’s cat on you...
---
Ah that has another name I think. head not helmet.
---
I always sell them for 200. If you on xbox u r welcome to pm me.
---
Wait, are you supposed to die in a fissure? I only fell into one once but nothing happened. I just jumped around for a while til I fast-traveled home.
---
I also keep 10mm for my machine gun when I am cruising around Morgantown.
---
Itd be cool if you could store heavy weps with the PA, just jump in a rock and roll. Iron man style
---
If you don't want Bloodied then Vanguard armor would be a good choice to help make you tanky. I wouldn't write Bloodied off so fast though. Bloodied unarmed/melee has probably the best dps in the game.
---
Big oof. Hopefully they will fix it soon. Thanks for the info!
---
So,
---
On this last patch, Atleast on PC, if you attempt to scrap an item that faved, you get a popup msg telling you it’s faved, AND asks if you still want to scrap.
---
Folks have been complaining that the extra layer of notification was annoying, but I’m thinking it’s worth it’s weight in caps..
---
Where in Whitesprings?  I'll dump mine there too and maybe it'll become a thing
---
Gamerz rise up!  Gangweed style.
---
Yes he trys to come after me too when i try to be a conduit, normally i try to exploit the AI by running circles around objects (like the pylon) so that it cant get to me and/or try to sprint away until other people activate the other pylons, keep in mind that im doing this with the speed demon mutation, then i start shooting things when he is no longer locked on to me
---
What are tokens for anyway?
---
I just enjoy the power armor.  I think it's because I'm a petite woman and it makes me feel powerful. Same reason I like melee and heavy guns.  I feel great anxiety when not in PA, even when I had good armor.
---
I always thought they should replace this game's enormous red screwdriver with the tiny blue and yellow Vault-Tec one that came with all the IRL Pip-Boy 2000 kits. It never made sense to me that my character could basically be forced into weaponless, unarmed combat, then basically pull out a shank everytime they needed to lockpick. Same for Skyrim.
---
How about you chill out and take your advice and learn to READ. You keep repeating the same thing like a broken record player instead of READING what people comment. I believe this post was done the moment you started insulting people instead of being respectful.
---
If someone else got there in the past 3 hours, nothing will trigger on the final terminal. You will need to server hop or come back in a few hours to try again.
---
When the timer has reset it will trigger an event when you use the terminal
---
My Strength is 20 with mutations and gear so when I'm not in a huge fight my Strength is occupied with Bear Arms for heavy guns, Bandolier for bullets, Traveling Pharmacy for meds, Ordinance Express for explosives, and Strong Back for +40 carry weight, I also use Thru Hiker for food and drinks, nd Batteries Included for energy ammo. 
---
When I do need to do a lot of damage I've got Demmo Expert for my missile launchers and fatmans, Auto Grenade Launchers, of which I have like 7-8 of each, and my one M79 Grenade Launcher, and then I've got all of the Heavy Gunner Perks, Bullet Shield, Tenderizer and Bloody Mess for my .50 Cal Machine Guns, Gatling Guns and my Miniguns.
---
I've had to become a Power Armor user because of this and even with that if I switch to my damage perks I'm overencumbered by over 700lbs.
---
If you’re account is not locked, and you can’t remember what your password is, submit an ingame service ticket to reset your password.
---
I thought this was common knowledge?
---
That's a normal event. It's called census violence, I've done it before, maybe was just glitched or something
---
I think you are stuck with them until Tuesday
---
If you are on PC and use mods update your Fallout76Custom.ini.
---
Sure, that'll be 2500 atoms, please.
---
You on xbox?
---
Really? I am doing allt hat shit and still trying to come up with stuff. Wasnt asking for free dumbass. Asked to trade first. If your just gonna be an asshat go somewhere else.
---
id thought someone woulod want them
---
How is this in any way shape or form an "unfair advantage"
---
Oh shit sorry, I still have it. Msg me in game, same name, I'll be on later tonight
---
Not really. It’s not a weapon.
---
This is broken mechanics, not difficulty.  If Darkeater Midir pulled his laser out of nowhere and aimbotted people would complain about that too. This game doesn't have very many defensive mechanics, so op attacks have to be taken down a notch, sometimes by removing a glitch.
---
You have to tweak your cards for it a bit, the best advice I can give you is make a plan with your points and build your legondary armor around it. Start with 1 or two star peices then slowly upgrade as you can afford it. Each peice and card will make you stronger.  After lvl 50 you are weaker in power armor that out of it, the only good time to wear it is in nume zones.
---
I tried to hold posidon and got my ass handed to me by level 198 lol
---
Some people just want to watch the world lag.
---
I recall the lever was lost, well he noticed it was missing, during a fasnacht event. Back tracked vendors just to be sure but I don’t see that happening twice especially because it’s right at the start of your sell list.  Here’s to hoping we get a lock option. Renaming sorta helps because you can put “aaaa AE handmade” to try to avoid accidental sells
---
1 item that hasn't been brought up again by bethesda that simply repairs things(which I'm against being in the atomic store as well mind you) doesn't equal mods, attachments and upgrades being in the atomic shop but keep reaching

They have to be within 1 build section. That is to say if you have 3 wall panels and the power radiator is on the far left anything on the other side won't work. 
---
They will power things through walls such as lights etc 
---
What are you trying to power?
---
Good to know
---
Not how that works.
---
Invest in Sentinel Unyielding or cavalier Unyielding set cheaper and more easy will be get only unyielding set sentinal reduce dmg 15 proc when you stand and do not move cavalier when you sprinting also 15 proc unyielding give you plus 3 to all stats exept endurence  lower your health is
---
when mining one of the Ore deposits (across almost the entire map) some of the more "common" materials will give you 4 instead of 1 per push of your action button. rarer ones will not give 4. like Ultracite Ore
---
I found that enclave events didn’t work for me
---
Try rebooting. I got back on later that day. It was something with my internet.
---
Oh, i definitely got the event. Started, basically the whole server was there....and then when it ended, it kinda just...ended. usually i would get a completion reward (for fasnacht, it was the masks, for prev quests in this line, the plans, gun, etc) but do you not get anything in the end?
---
Yep. I got the buzzing crash a few days ago on the Sheepsquatch boss. That was what prompted me to break from the game for a bit.
---
Try to drop or stash one. You won’t be able to.
---
Never done it yet. Never did the enclave storyline. About to start
---
Maybe you should think before saying stupid things? Dumbass lol
---
*That?! That’s specifically the reason you won’t come back?* Interesting. Just wait until you hear what they did with the STASH transfer button.
---
I take it a step further and add "site:reddit.com" to my searches, just to eliminate the wikis
---
Ah, I thought you meant you completed the quests rather than the event. On the event, I got the usual completion screen both on success and fail
---
It changed in the latest patch.
---
In ps4 atleast i have to press the square button (i believe x on xbox) that opens a inspect screen for the weapon and has options to rename it and reapir and then triangle (y on xbox) which should repair it
---
Not "allowed"?
---
ak56thethird I’m typically on the weekends and only lvl 52 so I can show you what Ik
---
That is a great plan. Thank you for that!
---
The paint job was a limited time only, and I can craft the paint as well. Seems to be a pretty common bug
---
Probably similar reasons would be my guess.
---
i enjoy it too ( after i figured out how to bring down the volume of running in it )...  i guess i just need a change. my game style is getting old.
---
agreed
---
Nuka_lenyos lvl 85 im on alot can help you do quest or anything you need help with
---
Everyone gets the same code pieces, they are universal and change every week. You don't need them to launch a nuke, just decipher the weekly launch code. You will collect them often, and they can't be traded. Your heart is in the right place though.
---
I have 3.  One is the same damage as my hardened 308 receiver
---
Sweet. Thank you for that
---
I know, what i'm saying is after you finish a challenge a related item could be in the atomic shop, completing the tales for the west virgina hills challenge doesn't not mean my  NEW character has all those holotapes...but what if you could buy the set in the atomic shop but it required challenge completion just like the camp skins require finding the base plane first.
---
Hon stay yes I am. The balance was there by limiting the amount we get from vendors a day so the nerf on crafting wasn’t required. Quit being the typical reddit troll who looks for any reason to preach higher of themselves to everyone else. You sir are a moron
---
Gotcha. 
---
So the Grafton vendors are also responders, as well as the one at the amosement park to the east.
---
suppressor, small stock because I like how it looks, true short barrel and a hardened 45 receiver I would actually recommend an automatic receiver but I'm not good with ammo management so that's why I use a non-auto.
---
not sure if they all work for any prize machine, or if each machine has its own type of token
---
You will always have a tiny chance of getting some mutations from any rad exposure, even drinking a nuka cola. Unless you are running a build with every possible mutation, starched genes is still optimal.
---
I lost my 3* instigating swing speed super sledge and 2* furious swing speed grognak. They were my 2nd and 3rd best melee weapons but they disappeared at the same time. The 2 melee weapons lost happened I believe mid February. Started an unarmed build alt and haven’t really went back to my main now that my alt can run the queen
---
..  Which you probably already knew.
---
It was in the patch notes for Tuesday's update last week 😁
---
Just wear the power armor. Full set gives boost to carry weight.
---
Walk up to a mining node, and click on it. You'll get more than the regular amount.
---
More than you'll ever know.
---
This has been posted multiple times now, people were super excited when we found out we could name the power armour we had
---
Does anyone know if there are there plans for Bethesda to implement text chat officially?
---
Rust / sepsis? I don't know.
---
Yeah, exactly.  No offence but if I see you have a few of my favorite workshops all setup and ready and I think I can beat you, I will try.  If you can fight me off and kill me a few times I'll kindly fuckoff :)
---
OK. Suit yourself. 
---
I play regularly with quite a few folks on PS4 who aren't complaining, so it's at least *possible* that you have a crappy ISP or your router may be nearing the end of its life.
---
As long as you don't mind accidentally getting extra mutations you don't want.
---
it sounds like it will take time.  The base stats seem so low, even on combat armor.  I'll take another look at bloodied.
---
YES! Simply put...
---
I wouldn’t give any cred to any youtubers who create videos for likes or jumping on the bandwagon of hate like many did... 
---
The game has come along quite a bit since demo and a lot of early glitches and issues fixed. Sure it has some bugs but many games do. 
---
Much like any other game, you either like it for what it is or don’t and move on, too easy. 
---
I’ve created a few characters starting from the beginning with different builds knowing what to do and how to do it and ALL have a different experience! 
---
So again, YES I think it’s worth it!
---
That's right!
---
You would think the devs would do something about that dev room by now.
---
Omg it never occurred to me that I can turn that down.
---
Just bring the one from 4 creation club into 76
---
Yes, pies! The perfect gift for neighbors.
---
Had this happen yesterday with lvl 1 legendary eyebots at the tennis courts, robobrains in other parts! It was pretty weird...lol
---
Do you use strange in numbers? Maybe that requires proximity. Honestly not sure. First thing that came to mind.
---
Pistols for sure need a buff, although with the right build i can atleast deal pretty good dmg even with full health build
---
When Fisto fists the wrong person.
---
I totally agree. That’s primarily why I want to embolden the line between raiders and griefers. One is rp, one is meta.  
---
In my rp circles I usually play an npc because everyone else wants to be a hero. And why not? But there’s no story if everyone is a hero. Good versus Evil is pointless if there’s nothing at stake in the middle.
---
Or it should just have a max loss of 150 caps and be 100% cap loss just like adventure. Currently with player deaths being worth 3x more in adventure most of the incentive is for pvpers to go back there and kill workshop owners and blow up bases for wanted and kill people hunting them for 3x more caps. That's moving backwards where no one is happy. I stopped playing survival because I dont care about xp for pvp and all people do is zerg from spawn sites now because it cost them nothing to just die over and over constantly run back. My favorite part of survival was that you needed strategy and tactics to stay ahead, people were laying elaborate traps with other players and you had to figure out different ways to split them up or beat them with terrain ect. Now it's just bad pvp players zerging and running at you.
---
Wait, do plans exist? I'd love to replace my lvl 30 one
---
Thank you for replying!
---
if it happens again: drop something else right near it that u can still access, all your dropped loot will shift over to the new bag.
---
I need to go wash my eyeballs out with bleach after reading this creepshows post.
---
Console?
---
I have a 2* tse radium waiting till I get the plans to learn some mods for it. Working on the lever now tho. Love the gun but aim down sight is impossible.
---
Should be easy peasy then. (I haven't done that quest yet, but I think I am going to have to soon.)
---
Yup I don’t wanna day they doin it on purpose to make us buy atoms but it seems pretty fishy.
---
Sorry PS4. Forgot to specify.
---
Yes renaming is a huge help. I’ve seen some really nice three star items at vendors, I always wondered whether people really didn’t want them or sold them by accident. 
---
The other day at Uranium Fever after everyone left I saw a paperbag on the stairs, checked and found a level 50 bloodied Gatling Plasma inside. The event’s loot is capped at level 40, so it cannot be a loot from the event. Apparently someone picked up something from a mole manager and didn’t like it, then when he dropped it he dropped a wrong item. Accidents do happen a lot in the gameplay.
---
It's not so bad, its just extremely rural compared to almost every single video game setting and very spread out in real life too. I've lived in the area most of my life and honestly I prefer the freedom of the country side vs more industrial feeling of say Pittsburgh. Funny enough, there's a new documentary that everyone is loving simply called "[Moundsville](https://moundsville.org/)" that covers exact things that you're talking about. I've always loved the area because it seems like every 5 miles or so it does feel like a whole new state. Some are humble, some overgrown but people loving it, and others an absolute ghost town. That feeling even continues north and across the border to Ohio which would be a gold mine if we could see Steubenville or East Liverpool in game!
---
There's a lot of history that 76 kinda avoids like I'm still upset that 76 doesn't have Wheeling at all, but find it charming that Wheeling Island is "Deathclaw Island" in game. I really hope in future expansions Bethesda really doubles down on the feel and history of all the areas.
---
5 miles is 8.05 km
---
Ps4 sorry
---
Minimizing carry weight won over on that for me.  That and my character is unarmed, so I pretty much just keep one tse on me
---
Without Makeshift warrior there as durable as a toothpick in a pop can
---
I got a two shot fat man the other day. Works great. And I’ve had a 3* two shot combat rifle both non explosive but still work better than non legendaries.
---
Nice what kind of gun?
---
Game is balanced around PvP? How is sentinel assassins armor balanced exactly?
---
With the right build, pistols are pretty good. I get a crit every 3rd shot!
---
Whack!whack!whack!SNAP!
---
Take the mirv mod off Daisy cutter and it weighs like a pound. Daisy cutter is Weightless but weapon mods aren't affected by the weightless effect, only the base weapon weight.
---
Agree about 1000%. I had Gobi Campaign rifle from NV equipped for about 40% of the game, Anti-Materiel Rifle for 20%. I'd also love it if they had Lucky as a set legendary 3* Single Action Revolver. 5% critical chance outside of vats, vats critical +50% and +1 luck. It'll never happen though..
---
Without a scope, at least a short scope, ads is bad in first person on most guns lol.
---
Never put ammo in your stash.
---
Will they stay active while I'm offline? I assume they're only active while I'm online.
---
They removed Travel Mats from the Beta because people were placing their camps and subsequent travel mat to get into areas of the map that you could not normally get into without this glitch/clip.
---
Explosive Ordinance 3 cuts their weight by 90%, making Daisycutter an okay crowd control weapon.
---
Same, fortunately I was in a group, but that didn't matter. Even being a pylon when you come back the sheepsquatch and its corpse are invisible. Happened to a group mate that had the same problem
---
Why is the mic important? I've played with plenty of people who don't use mic and 99% of the time it's not an issue.
---
I have a mic and my character is lvl 105 so happy yo help out if needed
---
I drop all my excess crap in artisans corner in front of the vendor bots.
---
Yeah you have to be in game.  You can also taken them if someone didn't lock their fusion core generator.  If it's locked you'll be wanted. It's not nice, but it happens. 
---
Lock your resources, people
---
It’s just easier to communicate plus I get kinda bored just running the silos so it’s good to have some1 to talk 2  :) you on now
---
Unless you get a good legendary one it's just an ammo sink
---
Mostly ignore base stats, legondary effects out weight them. That's the main reason people dont use power armor.
---
First image that came to mind was Sinon's weapon from Gun Gale Online (Sword Art Online II).
---
No one can attach mods at the moment since the recent patch. So you'll have to find someone who can craft the mod for the weapon.
---
With the fix to perk card sharing, how much charisma you really need depends on what perk you want to share with the team, the gear you have, muations you have, and the perks you think are necesary, if your gonna be a medic then you should always be on a team, with full +1 charisma gear and herd mentality, you can have a base 8 charisma and share max level perk cards, if you want to share a level 3 card, id say just go 7 charisma and get herd mentality unless you feel other charisma cards are necesary, due to the lower ap cost of pistols, a vats pistol build with a medic’s 10mm (or other pistol) would be effective, allowing you to heal the team even without the use of a stimpak
---
Yep, there are also several 'Take photos in/at xxx' type challenges that are bugged hit at least there were options to allow for some not working. These 'Discover locales' challenges are a 'do all' so ko room for non working. I have been to some many times and I also created a new character and walked right across to Grafton Dam as a low level to prove the point. Still didn't register.
---
Will be in a few mins
---
Calibrated Shocks will always be the best leg mod, up until the game dies. Also Targeting HUD is the only good head mod
---
I would really love this.  The brick annoys me at times.
---
Ps4
---
Cool GT DAPANDA280
---
It's an energy weapon.
---
I like to build my camps on rocky outcroppings and I always spawn below my camp and have to climb up a hill to get to it
---
Sounds good my dude just lmk
---
Omg, this is genius..... Check please
---
ha.  now we just a volume on the super sledge rocket!
---
I recently sold 11,000 fusion cells that I had been saving up since I started the game. It freed up 50+ lbs of character weight.
---
Oops.
---
Since launch.
---
Do you live under a rock?  Games 10 years ago costed less than 15mil to make, these days it takes 50-100mil.  All businesses are there to make money, that is a business, i am not sure you know what you are talking about.
---
And they both do the same damage as the most powerful .308 receiver. 
---
Anti-Materiel Rifle would be like the Gauss Rifle in terms of power, but with ridiculous recoil and/or slow bolt-action rechambering speed
---
I do indeed, and almost maxed rifleman.
---
Hehe auto type on my phone .
---
Turrets.  I assume that’s a no go.
---
Added you but you show offline so I've joined a server
---
i dont know why im so excited about them but im kinda hype to start a character when they drop, wanna try to make a STALKER themed build. havent played the game since i bought it on sale in november i believe.
---
did you get them from scrapping the fixer? or the plans themselves from the event reward?
---
&gt; ~~Turing~~ SAFE test passed ☑
---
What platform? I’m pretty sure there’s a known issue on pc with keystrokes that can cause a drop of the legendary highlighted. I’m tempted to say that someone saw that it was a Gatling plasma and dropped it because of weight and well reputation.  
---
Also they might not know better when dropping to conserve weight. I played a lot of this game not really knowing what I should have been wearing. 
---
I started knowing what the deal was around level 150 on my first character, and  I currently have 2 characters totaling about 340 character levels. I did grind to a high level after launch. R.I.P. white spring.  MAKE WHITESPRING GREAT AGAIN
---
Why one-handed and not two?
---
Joining you now
---
Thought about trying this game again.
---
Now i can save my drive space.
---
Lol I think I was at like 1.8k or something?
---
Lol. 😂😂 its pretty trash
---
What was your GT again
---
It's the mining helmet and I put the red tactical headlamp on top. There are a few different colors for mining helmets. I believe mine is the light grey color.
---
RebelsAdvocate
---
Thx
---
ah that's what's going on.. I bought a refined receiver for my lever action off a vendor but have not been able to attach it even though it shows up properly at the bench..making me nervous..so there's every reason to believe this will be fixed relatively soon right?
---
How long? Is five mins too long?
---
M'Squatch
---
For Grafton town vendor, you follow one of the rail tracks towards the town from the station, then hurdle a fence from a raised platform and it's the first building on the left as you enter the town. Look for the Responder signs.
---
Yeah should be I have ton of mods I've also gotten for my lever action
---
10 mins
---
It's mostly the mini-nukes, missiles, harpoons, railway spikes, 40mm grenade rounds, fusion &amp; plasma cores. Bullet ammo weighs hardly anything in comparison.
---
We should be able to sell ammo. But then we'd all be rich
---
I did a launch last night on SBQ and only one other guy showed. First time that’s ever happened to me.
---
That started in Patch 6, but almost no one noticed
---
We’re beginning the process now
---
I honestly don''t think their is any market for just gunpowder  however plenty of people buy bullets so maybe you should try making ammo and sell it to players
---
It probably should have been a dm.
---
Setting up a multi-story CAMP near a cliff. Looking upward to work on roof pieces, walked off the unfinished floor and off said cliff. What kind of dipshit dies in build mode. Derp.
---
Hasty, Precise, and Refined 50 cal receiver... I know that refined has improved damage in addition to changing the ammo type in the description.
---
I’m level 60 something and I’ve never even seen one.
---
(Thanks, literally don't need any armor now.... seriously, didn't die all day today because of Chameleon perk and stealth build I have going.... (now I just need a backpack and I am ready for anything.)
---
Been wandering about trying to find one myself. Only time I see them is during the scorch east queen event on the chance one gets spawned.
---
Find an empty server (or any server with anyone under level 100) and hold Poseidon and the munitions workshop for a while.
---
Huh, I do 1.5k and I barely put a dent in the thing.
---
No, turrets have to be attached directly with a conduit
---
Try playing on oceanic servers on survival mode. I've gone 4+ hours between sessions and logged back into the same server.
---
Tenderizer?
---
If you're running a stealth build it's usually the other way around.
---
I had a friend that had legit 100+ missiles in his stash that he insisted weighed 0.2 or whatever because that's what the game said. I told him to take them out, and he was crushed
---
Sometimes, it is just a visual glitch that corrects itself once you sell something

I got you. send me a pm

You are Welcome, hope you'll find the pet you want!

Yeah, I know that they exist now

Found my first one

Was using the bots there( 3 assualtrons 4 protectrons and a sentry bot to farm scorch beasts)
---
Flatwoods monster: OwO whats this and turns everything against me
---
I now hate the flatwoods monster
---
I spam loot so I regularlly stop and drop unused ammo at the nearest train station or unload gunpowder and ores in my stash.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think it was fixes last patch. There was no difference in Damage between Hardened and 50cal.
---
I personally just like the look of Marine armor, prefer that over others.
---
I’m on PS4. Like i said, the Gatling plasma was level 50 so it wasn’t a drop by the mole miners. Someone brought it and dropped it there. 
---
It’s hard to imagine that someone brought their Gatling plasma inside the mine and dropped it there when there’s a vendor station right outside. Maybe he got a level 40 bloodied plasma pistol and didn’t like it, but dropped the Gatling plasma instead by accident. Heavy weapons weigh only a couple of pounds when you use Bear Arms perk. The person who dropped it should have had already dealt with the weight before going into the event with that weapon.
---
I wish more people would call attention to this to demand a fix. I am starting to sadly believe it's partially intentional...or just simply not a big deal to Bethesda.
---
Yea but radium rifles have that...metal cone around the muzzle. I believe the muzzle mods remove that tho
---
Do you use melee with incisor on? Maybe I'm doing more idk I dont check. I run full unyielding with bloodied weapons.
---
NAR repair yard sometimes has one
---
1080ti/i5-9600k and I'm super stable at 1440p, have you tried sli off?
---
Yep. Backpacks were actually a paid mod in the Creation Club for Fallout 4, too.

To be clear I think it's fine but I can understand if someone thinks that a lack of global communication puts them at a disadvantage.

*I'm getting real tired of your first year psych student bullshit*

I don’t think so, think it’s a glitch
---
Isn’t the Bossoldier suit kind of orange. And I think I picked up the BoS officer suit and the was a dark grey. What color is the BoS Knight suit? That’s if you crafted it yet. These suits are ok until they are upgraded to treated, protected, and/or shielded. Best underarmor in my opinion
---
I’m the moron huh, I’m not the person complaining about a craftable hat that people would sell to vendors in excess amounts just to make caps. I don’t know if you know this but there are Hundreds of other items in this game you can sell to make caps and the weird thing is, most you don’t even have to craft you can just find them in the game world.
---
I tried that, didn't work. Here's what's in my Fallout76Custom.ini:

No, thank you for correcting me. I learned something today

*every power plant workshop
---
Then I guess I'll be in touch. My username is Eternal791, just so you know who to expect.
---
Yea I basically use all the perks that make me stronger but I deal like 1/4 of what you deal to the sheapsqauch
---
Upvote because no one updates anything. Most information is from November and is massivly out of date, based on Pre laugh speculation it down right un answered. Also I love the Flextralife, can we collectively shun Gamepedia and the 90 other add based trash sites for 76.
---
Lol I forgot how fast I go from 999-&gt;0 with the smg, ammo spawn needs to be buffed
---
Shucks. Good luck! Take a stroll through Whitesprings and check errybody. Otherwise Grafton is usually good for it.
---
I’ll be on in 2hrs if you haven’t got them yet. GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
It’s not really a must-have for non PA builds because stimpaks usually come by in large quantities, and if you’re running low health there’s a good chance you would die before getting your limbs crippled anyways. Even without running low health and no PA I’ve never used the perk cards and have been existing fine without it
---
If you repair the chainsaw to 200%, it's not bad
---
The one I'm wearing in the album is the knight suit. Seemingly the same colour as the soldier.
---
And yeah, the Strength + Endurance is a real good combo. I'm currently wearing the camo brotherhood fatigues that can spawn at thunder mountain that use the brotherhood under armour stats.
---
I'll be honest, in my 400+ hours on this game I've never even heard of the BoS officer under armour lol, must be a real rare spawn.
---
What kind of mods you looking for
---
I think this is a cool idea, it would make pistol builds and one handed melee more viable
---
The problem with plans is that they’re hella expensive and I’m constantly broke.
---
Huntington seems to be non-existent as well... traveling easst from Camden Park SHOULD take you directly into Huntington, but instead it seems to totally skip Cabell and Putnam counties and just dump you straight outside Charleston.
---
I thought they were the same 4 as in the taxidermy shop.
---
Farm acid and cloth to make it
---
are you asking from a lore or gameplay perspective?
---
For my lever action rifle, just a better receiver with higher damage. Same with my handmade. I don’t know what kind of mods you can put on Gatling guns.
---
So many multipliers I lose track. I had a fury popped too.
---
But it might work for every ground level camp so thanks for the advice!!
---
I have some mods for all of them I'm getting on now gottieboyz
---
Just as you said, great for keeping you alive, also great for burning through stimpacks for when you may really need them
---
After some more research, yes, they are. Lol.
---
Datamining shows these mods: Armor/Refrigerator/Weight and I forgot the rest.
---
Killed it immediately? Very unlikely. Every time I’ve done the event with 10+ high level peeps it still takes us 5 or more minutes to take the Imposter down. That’s with everyone cooperating and activating pylons.
---
ma boi, this simple change fix my game completely, thanks a lot sir ;\^)
---
I concur, fellow traveler.
---
Okay. What kind of price do you want? To make sure you don’t steal my gun can you put down a deposit that I will give back after?
---
More like why not unarmed, I can outclass either of those through speed alone
---
Holy shit this is pissing me off. I have taken the Poseidon plant several times now, the workshop twice.  Each time I have been disconnected after just completing the quest, or after I've invested time in it.  I just finally got the extractor going for the power cores...Server Disconnected.
---
Your telling me that taking a proven game and a proven engine and existing assets, is some 50-100 million dollar venture?
---
My username is TruJoe_ btw. I’ll get on in a bit.
---
Are any legendaries or all base guns
---
Where do people find enough fusion cores to stay in your power armor forever? All I find lately is fusion cores that are like 15-20%.
---
I thought it was officer but I’m gonna hop on to make sure it’s not just knight and I’m getting the two confused lol. Because I got it and was like this is  kinda rare which is betwixt within itself. I’ll edit the post when this loads up. But Yeah it’s officer. So I must be the man 😂
---
Base
---
Does it do extra damage when overrepaired?
---
I don't use the Adamantium Skeleton perk, and I'm not in PA except to fast travel (if I'm over-encumbered).  The only times I really get crippled is when I'm not paying attention to exploding cars, but, I usually fight from a distance.
---
Can some melee builds weigh in?
---
I mean I have legendary of all so I don't need them if I were to steal but I guess 500 each?
---
I don’t have a lot of caps right now so I don’t know what I should pay you in
---
All good

He was accurate in his assessmemt, no need to get defensive.
---
I set up a fusion generator at the 3 fusion core processors and within an hour or so I got enough fusion cores for a week or two
---
Actually that's a bit much haha maybe 400
---
Sounds fine by me. Can we take this to pm’s?
---
I'm from moundsville was disappointed when not much from the area was in game
---
Many different types of enemies favour different parts of the map. You will soon meet them all. Just continue with your main quest
---
Make sure they aren't ignored.  This happened tho us and we all laughed about it once we realized we had a good natured shootout when one of us (him) was wanted.  I ignored him by accident.
---
No. Reason: Lemme place 1000s upon 1000s of whatever object and crash every server I go to log into.
---
Stop at 1.15. 
---
Misses signed into the other Xbox as me and signed me out and it shows you offline so I can't rejoin you
---
Was lucky to find a exploding bullet .50cal and with a lot of perks got it up to 97 damage per shot. If i give it a prime receiver i would get 117, but the bullets are to scares to do that. Maybe if i find a second expl .50cal i could do that to it.
---
Otherwise come play with me.  I'm fun!
---
No need for that unless they add RP servers.
---
Not sure if it's a bug or intended, but if you repair armor above 100% it gains some extra physical resistance that goes away when it wears down. Same thing with auto melee weapons like the ripper or handy buzz blade, they will gain extra damage when repaired above 100%
---
Exactly. This is better than calibrated shocks!
---
I’ll inv

I made [this guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/edit#gid=0) awhile ago. Scroll down for my recommendation of the best armor sets.
---
&gt;but it's like the routine that evaluates line-of-sight doesn't happen frequently enough
---
Ever see a scorchbeast attack Watoga? Literally everything starts shooting at them, through buildings, inside of buildings, from behind buildings. They don't even bother with line of sight. Once they have a target they just attack it from wherever they are.
---
Indeed. Many atom shop camp items are just reskins of the existing items you can build. Removing cost would make them pay-2-win :D
---
That happened to me once yesterday. After that I had no issues
---
Cause it loads one object at a time
---
Believe me the fat man is very explosive.
---
Common bug find someone who has the plans already or wait until its fixed
---
I had something similar with my two shot dragon (and I loved it)
---
The main downside of the AMR would be it's weight.
---
I'd rather them work on fixing their constant server disconnect first.
---
Had the same issue with the Siberia 800 and changing the settings did the trick for me
---
Can we also have floors that are not foundations but are not upper floors? I wanted to make a 1 square width floating walkway to walk my water purifiers but it's impossible.
---
Absolutely no clue. I want to know as well. Just updated and it was there
---
Definitely exists. I've unlocked every plan except domestic kitchen tables, not sure where that 1 is hiding
---
I loved fable.
---
That sounds perfect!!! How was it?
---
If you find out, lemme know. Curious
---
Mostly the top ofv the map is where you'll see some weird stuff at first then as you travel to the right side of the map you need your best gear
---
it was great till I finally fired my last shot and had to start reloading again
---
Darts and pool please!
---
This explains why my Anti-armor/+50% Vats criticals Gauss Rifle feels like it sucks.
---
What's the ETA? I'm ready!
---
Like the CC mod for Fallout 4? Awesome, people can say what they want about the CC but I love that mod a lot.
---
I took a box from one of the Fallout Lootcrates, it fits perfectly inside the Pipboy case and lifts the actual piece up a bit.
---
just travel to the bottom right corner of the map (especially when theirs a red circle there) u will find all the variety you will ever want
---
Hey the unyielding armor set with weapon perks. I can carry the equivalent of 945 lbs of weapons without a single perk lol I love it
---
Ooh yeah never thought about that aspect of it. Just a camp full of water purifiers dragging down the already trash servers. But... If people spend enough money maybe they can build a better one 😂
---
945 lbs is 429.03 kg
---
You're absolutely right, it *doesn't* equal that. But I still think it could. Just like those lunchboxes *might*, and just like repair kits *are*.
---
The dart gun from Fo3 included
---
I need the one at the bottom of the list, looks like a vault tec table of some sort
---
Why even do the vent? you only get one shitty legendary.
---
There are some questions yet to be answered before I can say whether or not I feel they are pay to win.
---
If the basic version is **NOT** a recipe unlock but bought directly it **IS** pay to win. In this case you are paying atoms to bypass needing "rare" resources, which is effectively buying "rare" resources for atoms.
---
If they are plans and you craft the items yourself, it depends on the materials required and what they work on. Ballistic fiber is required if they repair armor. Do they work on PA? If so they better require ultracite as well.
---
Also how is not having to get outta ones PA in order to use a workbench for repairs not a tactical advantage over someone who has to find a safe place and get out of their tank suit in order to repair?
---
Did you do it?
---
Not a bug.  DR is increased proportional when item Condition is above 100%.   Melee damage is as well (not ranged weapons though).
---
Your so mean
---
Because the hotfux sucked this time. Everything is loading wrong and slow.  Especially my not complicated camp. Ps4.
---
It's for the hope of getting something. Plus we need for legendaries for the economy
---
Yeah this, the only reason they even have CAMP budgets is so the servers dont die, some of my FO4 settlemenst got to game crashigng levels, imagine if there was 24 of those size things on a server, it'd be unplayable even for the most hardy machines, let alone people on consoles or lower spec machines
---
I do the same. It's amazing if you stand in the golf club doorway.
---
BeCaUsE tHeY aRe TrYiNg sOmEtHinG AnD I HaTe NeW ThIngS YAY
---
will he not find a variety of creatures there?
---
I assume they slowed down the rate of which everything spawned in so that it would stop crashing peoples game suddenly having everything try to load in at once
---
Does exist, probably can provide proof has I haven't read it, not sure where I got it .. probably from Grahm or one of the vendors, just keep looking, quite rare. I continuously check vendors for rare plans ..
---
Your time would be better spent farming the caps for the plan and the materials to make it IMO.
---
I was laying survival yesterday when I noticed my purified water was gone. Not just like 1/3s of it but ALL 30 so that’s all I remember of survival now
---
Yea he will I guess
---
I suggest going to the right of the map at or around level 25 when you can use the good power armor
---
It's hard to know where and how to bring it to Bethesda's attention really. I would personally say "No more DLC until the core functionality is fixed" ... just having the game solid and big free would be amazing. Enough people reporting bugs that then don't get fixed ... or new ones get introduced.
---
It’s simple: people love matching sets, and energy guns are bad.
---
This situation would be better if energy guns had suppressors  and an ability to reduce the projectile visibility a bit. 
---
The best armors in the game right now are Heavy Metal, for normal people, and Trapper, for sneak builds.
---
Yes, a reward from the Cryptid event allegedly.
---
That would be the point I'm making.
---
What type of cryolator mod wise?
---
Hmmm, guess ill have to keep that in mind. Ty
---
You have a skewed perspective from the OP builds based on duped guns that people bought for real money.
---
Yeah. It's a soul killer. Lol
---
What I mean is I would not sell a plan for less than 50
---
If Im having fun shooting the shit with my friends killing stuff etc. etc. I should just be able to look at my compass and know whats what...I shouldnt have to open my map, hover all the different custom markers just to figure that out...all Im asking for is a QoL update because why is everything the same color of Aweful Orangey Beige
---
[If you didnt realize this is the only fallout you cant change your PipBoy/HUD color]
---
Oh boy. It was in a very rough state, but mostly, fallout traditionalists complaining about "muh RPG elements" not realizing this game has them in spades.
---
They just leave them on the ground when I do
---
How did you
---
Good to know. Ive been ranged my whole play through. So i guess i never really saw the increase.
---
Or get the bear arms perk and lower the gatling gun weight to ~3 lbs
---
I don't have my computer with me, but just make sure you copy-paste the line from the updated Fallout76.ini file first, and then append the mods you want to use.
---
There should be no extra newline between the [Archive] header and the sResourceArchive2List.
---
It is very easy to make a mistake, so copy the lines exactly from the Fallout76.ini file.
---
Also, make sure you have the lastest updates to those mods too.
---
Also, try without a Fallout76Custom.ini, and if that fixes it, you know you have something wrong with your custom ini file.
---
Have you considered griefers who will exploit this by placing a million of one Atom Shop item and crashing every server they load in on?
---
Yes Bethesda believes drills and syringers are legendary enough for the players of their game.
---
Yeah i think thats the culprit
---
I just give people what they want...Are you not entertained?
---
Following. Same here
---
Oh I am
---
Just love getting to the end of a quest to have the game freeze completely. Nice to know Bethesda is more worried about MTX than fixing their disaster of a game.
---
There was a vague allusion of them maybe working on it in the future, all in 'why not' mode. That was in november I think.
---
Hey, I have the domestic tables plan, if you want it
---
Spam E at a snallygaster spit attack!
---
It is an on-going quest (or never-ending).
---
Most of the answers to that same question tend to say that there will be more Overseer's  tapes in new content sometimes in the future.
---
Try going back to Biv’s place and reading the terminals, or activating a poster.
---
okay, i see that.
---
It was a glitch along with the behemoth stomp attack I believe. When you killed one of the mentioned creatures sometimes those would appear in your inventory. Has since been patched I believe but more of a collectors item.
---
Then people with microphones have a clear advantage vs them who can't communicate at all.
---
Yeah alright. I'm currently on holidays, will be back in a couple weeks so you I'll contact you again then. How much for it?
---
How isn't there....they have to have some kind of thing to entice you to spend money over just earning everything in game. Take warframe for example, sure they tell you that you can buy the blueprint for the warframe , but it's super small and not obvious espcially to a newer player. They have even confimed that they do this. And i still think warframe is a fair game in it's business model. You're being blind to the facts im trying to tell you so i can tell the conversation is basically a lost cause, no company is going to let you just earn everything without expecting or at the very least hoping you spend additional money sometime down the line. They do this by limiting how much of the currency for purchasing the items through gameplay etc. Those to me a tricks or misleading because sure you can earn stuff from gameplay they said , but they will never say you can earn like 1 item a month or so on.
---
Gg, worlds full
---
Like the whole box itself?
---
lols yeah I was thinking that my self - I really think being able to bulk and sell ammo be to players or vendors would be a major game changer also moving from like 5% item worth to 10% as well would help 
---
that said the fact now all vendors have a single lump sum of cash is a major help for me
---
You’d love survival mode.
---
Oh please.
---
Most plan spawn locations do not spawn specific plans. They have a loot table of possible plans that spawn at that location.
---
But if you memorize a bunch of plan spawn locations, you can check them every day to get more plans.
---
Really? Interesting. Guess I have something to finally spend my points on!
---
Artisans corner cash register. It has a 0 weight limit so you can put anything in it. I've seen ammo, plans, and legendaries in it. I find there and the Train station suit cases get lots of the WS and Uranium Fever drops put in the all the time.
---
I don't trust dropping bags. They're sometimes harder to see and no one is sure if they despawn once you log out and the cell is unloaded.
---
One Million Caps lol. I have a few. Shiot me a pm when you return, I'll set one aside and shoot it to you for 50c
---
That value
---
Good thing that's not what I said at all
---
Agree. Collecting water to make soup is borinh
---
The glitches, glitches, and more glitches. I never hated it or jumped on the hate train like most but god it was rough. The game has come along way since launch I remember when it would crash seemed like every hr or so.
---
.....probably that she was a protecton all along...
---
This is exactly what I meant. Zero balance
---
Beat her several times already, I can confirm you can still damage her when she’s invisible but it’s just very hard to fight an invisible enemy.
---
You’re doing it wrong then. Caps are insanely easy to stack. Go on cap runs and actually loot enemies and sell their shit. Lack of caps is a terrible excuse.
---
Domestic kitchen tables? Yeah same here, only one I need too. I'll buy it if it's the kitchen tables plan
---
Yeah and the description is wrong. Refined is actually 2 points of damage lower than the standard 50cal receiver. The standard one doesn't even say it has "improved damage"
---
Standard 50cal: https://i.imgur.com/YYTvame.jpg
---
Refined 50cal: https://i.imgur.com/lIPMv8E.jpg
---
from what I saw from data mining
---
Visual - cloth material type - flair 1 and flair 2 - skulls / teddy bears / lantern for flair items 
---
active boosts - default - high capacity - insulated (rads?) - refrigerated 
---
BUT take that with grain of salt cause who knows what will be out when they start them off and whats to be added later
---
Yes, additional hook iirc
---
Yip, the least they could do is add a rain catcher to collect dirty water over time like how the purifiers work.
---
I haven't bought a single item with real money doesn't make it seem any less scummy i don't intend purchase anything either unless i feel the game has gotten to a place i was hoping it would be at from launch or i feel they have earned the money from my hours spent in game. I have no problem support the ongoing development of games that i feel have earned additional money from me. I do this consistently with warframe because they give a ton of hours of fun and ask for basically nothing in return. So i in a way feel obligated to support them in a good way, very few games make me feel this same way. I wish more companies would take notes from how they run their system, i have never felt forced to purchasing anything from their store and yet i do and in my opinion it's why the game is so successful today if they had a different business model with the exact same game i doubt it would be as popular or successful.
---
I think they slowed down the loading to help with frame drops on log in. As it was a very big issue when the Fasnaught festival was around. 
---
Seems to happen whenever you join around something added after the world map was started. Like dlc and camps. This can be observed by the missing door for the tattoo parlor on log in and its missing map location.
---
its so weird that we cant use purified water anyways
---
purified water is for mixing with stimpaks rad-x or radaway to make diluted ones. This should be your main source of income. If you have extra purified water, you must not be doing this. 
---
Also just collect dirty water in any open puddle, takes a few seconds to get 100+, wood is also very cheap and easy to find. Just about any log.
---
Yeah, tbf I never know if stuff like that is down to the buggy ass game or if its working as intended or I messed up somewhere. Still, I limit my aid to 10 a stack in survival, less worried about dying that way.
---
I love how innocent this sub is compared to market subs. Here, this should help you a bit:
---
r/fo76bazaar  
---
I've ignored it as a normal unarmed build. Basically if a limb gets crippled, I've already taken enough damage to need a stimpak anyways. I run one autostim piece and one rank of the autostim perk in agility and I never feel in any kind of danger.
---
yeah, still happened without the Fallout76Custom.ini file, so something is wrong on Bethesda's end...
---
I want backpack with slupersledge-like rockets on the back that increase my movement speed and jump height, but whatever
---
It's the "Domestic Tables" plan. I'm pretty sure it includes all domestic tables. Kitchen or otherwise.  
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong
---
Because it wasn't exactly what they thought it was going to be. So anyone with a keyboard or camera made sure everyone else knew how unhappy they were it didn't have what they wanted. And then all the issues with Power Armor Edition, Nuka Dark, updates that broke more than they fixed. That's why there was so much bad press.
---
Me? I just kept on hoarding and scrapping, hoarding and scrapping. Stabby, stabby, stabby. Repeat.
---
I'm having fun
---
How do you manage such high charisma? With 6 base the highest I ever got mine with gear and chems is 14.
---
Then you want a “Furious” Legendary Chainsaw.
---
(Though Personally Like reduce weight mods and Vampire)
---
It’s mostly geared for solo, 2 people should make it easier
---
Every responder vendor in the game is selling a Lever Action Rifle for around 1,500 caps. It may be a bit higher as I was using trader related perks. you can then craft and scrap them to get mods.
---
Yeah, it would be pretty easy for them to let you make boxes or magazines of ammo. Most bullets have a box mesh and texture. It makes no sense that you pick up a box of bullets and carry them around loosely. Bulking them up would be a good use for paper as well, you make nifty little cardboard boxes for them.
---
And yes, the single lump cash is great. What's even better is when you have a high barter and sell something, the caps they get from the sale can now go above 200. Great for those high priced items.
---
I just want something that I can use my .308 ammo for. Even if I put all of the fastest firing/reloading mods on a hunting rifle, it feels like using a black powder.
---
any shotgun shells for sale?
---
I didn't think the chain saw was even on a loot table.
---
She left the area by plane..... So unlikely
---
Editor ID's are pulled directly from the game files, so you either need "Creation Engine"(Creation Kit on our side) or XEdit to get that data
---
My 308 hardened sniper rifle (level 50) does something like 136. To be fair I gotta lot of rifle perks so not sure what it is without perks.
---
Yeah, and it’s highly likely theres rat feces in your candybars. No one needs someone shouting it every chance they get.
---
If he hates the atom store there’s a million other games he can play. I sighest Black Desert Online so you can see what a real in game store looks like.
---
I've seen it, and considered adding, but already have hundreds of hours invested in helping with the bug side.. Can't do both :(
---
I once ran into a bug where instead of 1 or 2 assaultrons, a sentry bot, etc spawning at a whitespring gate by my camp, they were all mole miners. First and only time it ever happened
---
The interface is only on one side of the pylon. You have to run around it to find it. I think there's a little red button there. If it's already been activated, it will not offer you to be the conduit. If there's no blue electricity coming off of it, then it hasn't been activated yet.
---
It should exist. Try claiming all workshops, that's where you'll get most of them. The whitesprings and grahm has a few too (mirrorball is one that's semi rare on grahm). The watoga vendor has some that pop up too like the magazine rack.
---
I wonder if he/she/it will actually speak or just make mole miner noises at you?
---
I miss 20% of the sheep events I'm in because thay happens to me
---
Why be a pirate when you can be a union soldier? Then you can use a single action revolver as well!
---
They all did years ago.... Also those 60$ games with no subscription got little to no development post release. If they did get content it was a 40$ expansion.... Also, games back then were mostly the same length as games today and cost a fraction of the cost to develop. Also, in subscription games they put massive artificial grind in just to keep people paying. These days since there is no subscriptions grind length is relatively short in every game and they use microtransactions to cover the difference because nobody will pay a subscription and flip their shit if a game is over 60$. So blame whiny ass cheap people for cash shops.
---
i like this
---
I can’t wear power armor, it turbo over encumbered me, I go from 190/240 to 280/240
---
I am making a new character to try any make flamers work. I hear scrapping a flamer gives 50 fuel. I imagine I will be doing that a lot in order to feed the beast.
---
or an AI lmao
---
I'm not sure but I'd like to see. I have a trade but I'll be back in a minute ign: rotoass
---
Also aid items.
---
I have x01, excavator, and t51. I mostly use x01 for cosmetics. But if I'm going out to get scraps, I'll bring my excavator. I also only have t51 for cosmetics. Because of the nuka paint.
---
Enclave best faction.
---
Im not. I rarely use stims etc at the moment, I am also not really selling anything. It was just a suggestion based on my rather limited experience in game.
---
not sure about anyone else but I stick with my x01 because it has a jet pack and everyone knows jet packs are cool
---
Kinda running my own version of this but focuses on having two mutations (super jump one and  Chameleon) and The Lvl 50 Fixer
---
Plus sneak Lvl 3 and escape artist
---
Crossbows. Definitely. I really wanna use one consistently, but unfortunately they suck too many butts.
---
Energy weapons in general, but that's not news. I just want my instigating plasma to be worth it's weight.
---
Because the X-01 has good enough ballistic/energy resistance? 
---
I do have all types of power armors but i only use the X-01. I can't be bothered to switch to T51 for a bit more ballistic resistance. X-01 kept me alive since i was lvl 50. Never died in PvE...
---
I guess I have just been lucky,  people always get the pylons in the events I have been to. Then again,  I will always try and take a pylon if I can. 
---
The biggest issue I have seen is that even with server hopping,  I can't seem to find the event going on very often. I have only been able to complete four events so far since the patch.
---
I'm at the point where I can't do it again until I build my stimpak stash back up. I burn through 30-40 (at least) per event. And if no one else takes the other pylons, it's a waste.
---
I did have a good experience the other day. Another player revived me when I went down -- I tend to stay next to my pylon. And he seemed to help defend around me after that. I'm not sure if he intentionally did that but it seemed so. I didn't die again from attack by the assaultron and we won the event pretty quickly.
---
So am i xD I'll let you know if i figure out though
---
Yeah i 100% agree, my camp pumps out 60 purified water per hour yet i have to jump in some filthy lake and get dirty water to boil, makes zero sense.
---
sounds awesome
---
Card costs around 2k, not 8k.
---
Yeah and I bet they'll charge you to login too. No one is saying it CAN'T happen. People basically don't want to here your rant about microtransactions and crazy baseless assumptions on a post completely unrelated to what your going on about.
---
Broken by last Tuesday's patch. Nothing you can do now except wait for them to fix it unless it's a mod you or someone else knows how to do without a mod.
---
Let's geeeet readdyyy tooo rummmmmble....it's lunch time!
---
Agreed. The clothes are there. YOU GET TO USE THE DRAGON.
---
Respect.
---
I was tempted by the flamer build, would love to see a successful one to decide if I should give it a go.
---
I completely support this, mostly because i hate the current blocking system.
---
Plus, i love the image of a raider running around with a lead pipe and car door as a shield.
---
Respect
---
Definitely.
---
I've never had that happen.
---
it was and now its so depressing watching that metal rod slowly going down the pipe as I wait a minute to reload
---
dayum..probably reappeared in someone elses inventory lol
---
Lolol this is a hit to the nards
---
Dam near close
---
Also focus more on luck and other perks then  agility 
---
Running night eye and a lot of other useful perks (will post later)
---
Fix one thing, break three more.  Argh.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Aliens
---
There are 4 or 5 extra missions in total
---
I have luck finding them in the more near treetops
---
The white fedora and wood part, yes, all the time.
---
U saw me die and drop all that junk and u didn't help me? Maybe it was even u who took my junk... That's the only reasonable explanation. How else could you describe what happened to me in such detail?
---
Furious would be awesome, if it existed.
---
I use combat rifles a decent amount, rifleman with it tuned to semi-auto - would definitely use .308 for this cause I don't ever use heavy weapons.
---
It works for me. It's doubtful it's a problem on Bethesda's end.
---
Try renaming the Fallout76.ini and Fallout76Prefs.ini files to backup names and let the game recreate then on next launch.
---
If that works, carefully restore your modifications to Fallout76Prefs.ini, using a tool like Beyond Compare will help with that. 
---
If that does not work you will probably need to scan and repair your install using the Launcher.
---
You are correct. I edited my post.
---
But why does it suddenly not work
---
kk He's gonna be awhile. I'd like to see if that's it. I'd buy it off you for sure. I think they changed it to kitchen tables in the build menu.
---
Dang I should do that
---
I hear what you're saying but the fact remains,if people want to waste caps,they should be able to.You are trading a few caps for convenience.
---
OK, I'll be curious to see the build. The biggest issue I have is that the Pistol and the One-Handed Blade are the weapons of the Mistress of Mystery. And its a bit tight having the Pistol line in Agility, since that is also where all the stealth perks are.
---
Oh so glad we have you to explain this to us, why thank you oh genius one.
---
this is all my personal opinion and is slightly biased
---
I pre ordered it and Honestly at launch it was very bare bones and very glitchy. While it’s still glitchy now it’s not at all like it was when it released.  People would say there’s no npc’s (even though technically they’re wrong about that) and that there wasn’t much to do besides loot stuff 
---
and grief other players ( that part is true) 
---
there was also bunch of controversy over the stupid bags that people had gotten a nylon bag instead of a canvas one that was in the pretty picture that supposed to hold a power armor helmet that was originally the main selling point and didn’t really care about the bags until a guy on Reddit made a lot of noise about the bag and that set everyone off. 
---
and people were getting fixed when you sent in a support ticket to Bethesda and where somehow getting everyone else’s info I’m not really sure how that worked. 
---
I’m sure there’s a bunch of other little things that were happening but that really all the big stuff that put people in a fit and had people calling it the worst hand of the century... until anthem came out( again personal opinion)
---
bum deal
---
It is a pop up, like verdant season. Then you have to go to the event site, which is a flashing hexagon like other events
---
It happens, hipefully you had the numbers you needed.
---
We did, it took a little longer than normal when I throw a post up, but we got it done.
---
It has a god damn flaming mod, what more do you need!?!?
---
Ok?
---
A TON of Fallout is true to life, I really want to write my thesis on it for my BA. The setting and technology might be wildly different, but their universe and ours have a lot of the same problems
---
Awesome guide man! All that makes sense
---
I personally got tired of doing quests for dead people with little reward, and the unfinished nature of the game as a whole. It's got pros, but it's also got cons that are hard to look past for extended periods of time.
---
I am looking for one as well. Someone mentioned look at The Thorn, there is a video where someone found one at a random spawn [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDkxONWvEM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFDkxONWvEM&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Forward to 2:57.
---
Others. have mentioned find it in the mire and let it chase you into the bog, so I will have to see, going to try see if I can test the random spawn for now.
---
Certain big boi enemies tend to show up in certain areas. If you feel like going hunting for big game, there is a Daily just for that in the toxic valley that Grafton's mayor will send you to. I can hook you up with a few spawn points I know of:
---
Grafton monster appears in what once was a river between Poseidon Energy Plant and Charleston station (right next to the black land) as well as in Grafton in the Toxic valley (white land) during the common Grafton Day event. 
---
The Snallymaster appears in what once was Charleston a little each of Charleston Station and if you do the daily at a place called Black Bear Lodge in the white land, areas where you can find Bloodbugs, Yo Guys (big boi bears) and the Snallymaster.
---
If you really want to go big game hunting then go north to the toxic valley and you will have a blast. There are rad toads (walking frogs that set you on fire), Grafton Monsters, Snallymasters, Anglers (walking fish that set you on fire) and the fabled horrible creature known as the Blood Bug. You can find the big game daily mission at the Black Bear lodge. To locate it, Look on your map to the top of it where you see the big snake creature. A little to the right past the motel and the small shack you will see a dark brown lodge. Mark it and travel towards it and it your feeling dangerous, set up your camp there and make a living in absolute hell. Make sure you don't come naked as along the way there are Super Mutants, Scorched, lots of radical toads and Anglers, and make sure you avoid water as it's toxic there and will irradiate you super hard. You also can't cook it so you will need to bring some with you.
---
Yea i did but that would just get me to the "register" aa new account
---
I just wish there wasn't such a drastic difference between the Pylon event and all the Lying Lowe missions leading up to it. I walked into the event, thinking it was going to be another cakewalk, and immediatly got demolished. Personally, I'd like it if the event was slightly easier, but still challenging, but at least the missions leading up to it should get gradually more difficult.
---
Allfather* wait...
---
&gt; I mean sure you’re assuming but It honestly makes sense that they could do this.
---
Could, yes, but haven't. There is currently more leaning towards they won't than there is for they will. We don't even have repair kits yet, so we don't know 100% for sure thay will end up as atom shop items.
---
In addition to the glitches, server stability was incredibly rough. You could barely play a straight hour without getting kicked
---
The way the crafting system works in the engine used, they would need a duplicate recipe for each crafting recipe using the water. I'm assuming this is the only reason there is a limitation. Being able to turn purified water into boiled water would fix most of the issues without an overhaul.
---
On a secondary not, if you're having issues with boiled water (as someone with a huge need for food, I get that) a good piece of advice is to take Woodchucker and always look out for logs and wood piles. Just doing a couple loot runs for other things I pulled in almost 400 wood just from logs, junk, weapons, and wood piles. Prickett's Fort and White Powder offer tons of wood for you to boil your water. Just random tips.
---
I’m sorry but are you a masochist ? Why are you playing this trash game ? Do you love pain or just not value your time ?
---
 No such thing as a free lunch
---
*muffled screams*
---
With one of my characters, I can always safely fast travel to my own CAMP and appear a short distance away from the buildings, but about 60% of the time that anyone else fast-travels to me while I'm there, they'll appear embedded in a specific spot in the foundations of the CAMP, unable to move or escape. I'd love to put a fast travel mat outside just to avoid this repeated ordeal.
---
if you listen to the speech given by the wolf he explains exactly how to do the event.
---
Yesss! #Marie Kondo lol
---
Could you post some pictures of the place....I'm really interested.
---
You should make a trip to McDowell county, where the ash heap is based off of. Theres an entire town that's been on fire for years from a coal deposit below the town and no one does anything about it. The area you're talking about is seen as the richy suburbs compared to the county.
---
And dildos could become a thing. It COULD happen... Your logic is rather flawed.
---
Yeah you will get banned 100%
---
Thanks for the tip. Generally I just forget to collect dirty water.
---
Ah I was at the thorn before haha. Cheers I'll check the video and have a look!
---
Hide and seek. 
---
I’d tell you to look at Fight Club. But it doesn’t exist *wink, wink*
---
Nope.
---
Says the guy commenting on the sub for a game he doesn't even like. And believe it or not a lot of people enjoy this game lmao
---
I have one of each set and honestly it’s just about what I fancy on any particular day. I also have a hybrid set made from an X01 torso with jet pack, X01 helmet, excavators legs and ultracite arms. All colour matched using the prototype skins for the X01 and ulracite parts lol.
---
Kill sheepsqautch a bunch of times, go be a helpful guy and buy or give lower lvl people goods
---
Not gonna lie, didn't even know that gun existed but it's cool as hell.
---
Likely.
---
I’m a fan of the T-51b.
---
Fuzzy tokens are weightless and you can cash them in for the mr fuzzy suit. there is also tokens you get for the load bearing event and have weight which you can cash outside of the event mine, but i have no idea if they are worth keeping for the rewards.
---
I think we all missed one important aspect in this post.  I'm on Xbox1
---
Also gunpowder. I had no idea that I had like 800 gunpowder. I assumed it weighed like nothing.
---
Have you bought all the serum recipies yet?  I have only 1 more to buy before I have them all.
---
Ill be honest: my drops were better than a wood leg. However, I did have a loot bag twenty feet up thanks to the eyebombs.
---
IDK if you are dumb but vats crits go straight through it.
---
As long as they didn’t take your lunch money...
---
donate to a worthwhile charity..like say, "LifeInAnalog" on PC..
---
..that's what I'd do in your situation :)
---
East of camp venture one can spawn in a clearing and it’ll take you really a minute or two to get into cranberry but I’ve found scorchbeast stalking that area so it is dangerous to say the least
---
I don't even get the legendary drop half the time. :\
---
Yes we do:
---
&gt;Basic Repair Kits will be unlockable in the Atomic Shop using Atoms you’ve purchased

---
+karma Thanks man great server. Queen and sheepsquatch!
---
Watoga emergency center
---
Anti-Armor does nothing on legendary stats, only damage resistance.
---
T51 with T60 legs!! That has been my setup forever
---
Oh yeah! It might be you guys get it and not us on PC. I checked my plans guy and he doesn't have domestic tables. It never drops. You know where you got it?
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
In all seriousness I feel bad for West Virginians
---
I have four points slotted for rifleman and spent most of the past 20 levels primarily using a bolt action pipe rifle. The only heavy perk I have is Bear Arms. It still does more DPS.
---
So is this new sub mainly going to be about gathering and glorifying existing raider lore in f76 or a potential recruiting place for people who like the raider mentality? Personally I've always wanted to RP a raider in a game like f76 but there was a lack of a real PvP experience. Up until the release of the new survival mode that is. I'm still hoping that one day Bethesda will release a guild like system that will allow players to form gangs but we'll see.
---
Cheers. I'm near venture now. I can handle the scorchbeast I'll give it a go :)
---
Some of them have gone like that.
---
Others was like: FT to the event &gt; Activate pylon &gt; Pop Nuka &gt; CTD &gt; Rejoin &gt; 'Why is everyone shooting at thin air' &gt; 'I am taking damage from... what exactly?' &gt; Pop Nuka &gt; CTD &gt; Rejoin &gt; Event Ends &gt; 'Well at least I am getting the event rewards' &gt; CTD &gt; 'Guess I am not either'.
---
Luckily a handful of them have gone smoothly and I even got the plan to craft the helmet.
---
So far it's only mole miner noises but they are slightly different sounding. I wonder if this specific mole miner has managed to retain a but if it's humanity
---
This is the third time in about an hour. Don't you Like...search before Posting?
---
I just found a thread saying the Thorn, I don't know if you have to start an event or just server hop at the thorn .. but for now I am hitting this randoms spawn, I will let you know know if I am successful, it's going to be tedious either way.
---
The basic water pumps produce dirty water. I'm not sure if they are known plans right away but I have one right next to my campfire for this purpose.
---
It's 7am give me a break. Thanks for the help.
---
Oh, I though it did both, interesting!
---
They said that, yes, but given the outrage, they may change it. So again, we don't 100% know till they are actually in the game.
---
go away
---
The Raider vendor at The Whitespring had it when I was looking the other day, so you should give that a try.
---
I have x01, but use t51b. Not often though.
---
The hand pumps? Yeah they do but its slow. I will just have to make an effort to stand in a river.
---
You never thought a Bethesda game would have things just floating around? You must be new here. Welcome! :D
---
Awesome work!  I had a friend laugh at me because I spent 5k on a sentinel assassin robot leg and the dr is only a few pts different from bos
---
Jsyk if you drink from a water pump and then spam collect at the bottom it’ll collect about 10 or so dirty water each go
---
You should be good to go down to Charleston. A level 10 Grafton Monster lurks down there, and there are super mutants (level 5?) at the Wade Airport and maybe the Capitol Building (might be level 14 though, not sure). Also a snalligaster. In my 30s now and I'm coming across Wendigos fairly often (I'm finding the lower level ones tankier than super mutants twice their level).
---
haha. relateable. any idea what caused it?
---
They hated fo4 as well.
---
it took me 3 play sessions of capturing 5 workshops and then doing said defend/retake events when they popped up, i hastily dodge normal events as people just reject it an run around killing you like fiendish little snakes. Levelled up alot doing so too tbh, 300-500 xp per defend/retake aint bad.
---
Trapper for sneak builds, huh? Never heard that before.
---
If CAMPs become non-griefable, then adventure will pretty much be an RP server.
---
not a clue although everytime I swich guns their fully reloaded so I'm wondering if its something around that glich
---
Hi wondering, I'm Mom.
---
\*looks up from playing mini-game tapes on Pipboy\*
---
Hrm?
---
Nerf it.
---
SBQ is glitched now they need to patch something
---
Plus we get outfits we can wear over our armor
---
I really enjoyed your story. If you're on PC my name is SolidSnakesBandana if you ever feel like hangin'. Sometimes its nice just to be on a team with someone because they can have your back if something goes down. I like playing Survival because the lack of fast travel and constant danger of other players makes the game much more interesting to me.
---
You could just have 15 strength.
---
Un-armed is the answer. My bad.
---
Why would you anyway? PA perks are dope.
---
farm ticks
---
Yes, it's happening to everyone, we assume it's a glitch, hopefully it will be resolved Tuesday.
---
It's a stealth build and I'm more concerned about first shot damage than DPS - fights aren't sustained and if they are I use an AA/Fire rate handmade. Mainly just use it for farming stuff in order to burn off .38 and .45 ammo - would like the .308 for that too.
---
Thanks, I'll look for good locations to do this online
---
Still, it would be nice if I could activate the pylon without clicking directly on the keyboard of the console, and instead anywhere on that side of the pylon.
---
Somewhat of a work around.
---
2 way to do.
---
Way one
---
Place wood foundation underwater far enough to use stairs to create the walkway as a second floor. Leave foundation and stairs as a leader to your swimming hole.
---
Way 2. Build a bridge
---
Works in most cases. You make an arch bridge from a 1 foundation, stairs a 1x2 floor, stairs going down and then your walkway around your purifiers. Once you have them placed at the correct height. Use a half wall under 1 of the walkways to remove your archway.
---
Protectrons are the worst at using protection themselves. They are more of a “do as I say” sort of robot.
---
Unyielding Armor, +3 special except for Endurance at low HP.
---
Also, there are so many log piles at Helvetia
---
easy take over a pwoer station get alot of cores, use the perk that makes cores last 30% longer. and the perk that makes energy ammo reduce weight. (cores act as ammo on here)
---
Create a backstory for your character, maybe a certain accent. Definitely give them a flaw or two to make it more exciting.
---
I know for sure that one can spawn at treetops in the mire.may require some server hops. It's gonna be a challenge to kite it to the bog though. 
---
I got lucky and found one fighting the queen.
---
It's a lucky solution and would like to know more about a permanent one,since we'll have this challenge again in days.
---
no need for the Dev's to test new in game mechanics...... It just works......
---
One armor, less weight to lug around (for me at least). I have 3 torsos for the x01, emergency protocols, jetpack, and stealthboy. Switch them in and out as needed. The stealthboy could probably remove, only use it in the silo through the radiation part. Since you can skip that through lockpicking and hacking it's kind of dead weight.
---
It has the rad resistance for nuke zones and excavator takes care of the daily jumps (now with the vendor update it's even less useful).
---
May want to consider trying out Nuka-Grape and Orange once you hit late-to-end game. 
---
Cola Nut 2 *triples* the benefits these drinks provide. With that perk, those two provide enough HP to fully heal you faster than two Stimpaks applied at the same time with Field Surgeon 2. That's not even considering the other benefits they provide (such as Grape removing radiation in a way that doesn't risk losing mutations if you don't have Starched Genes 2 on).
---
They are also not too hard to get. The Soda Fountain at Whitesprings always sells one Grape and Orange for 25-40 caps and they restock after a server hop.
---
Just Spam collect in any water source and you can get a hundred in a few seconds
---
I'm glad you enjoyed the story. I can't really cover anyone's back because my framerates are bad. We can play on Adventure maybe, or do the events on Survival together. I'll be able to play tomorrow maybe. When I'm playing I'll add you.
---
And if you can get a legendary variant, it's cooler still. Just keep in mind that the reload is painfully slow.
---
Proof please.
---
I have noticed a drop in stability since the last update, plus the very annoying glitches with the workbenches/mods. Buncha weird visual glitches too like getting an event failed notification for events I am nowhere near. I think Lying Lowe really knocked something loose in there.
---
Now you're getting it.
---
Do it quick! I would! LoL
---
For the same reason VATS works fine without an additional power source in regular armor but it takes huge chunks of your core in power armor: Rules of the Wasteland Codsworth, rules of the Wasteland.
---
https://youtu.be/Uuqt5lgKyBk
---
**Fic
---
Likely to stop you from spamming marsupial jumps to dodge attacks after using all your AP in Vats.
---
My PSN is: TheBlackPrince05
---
Yes!!!
---
What missions are those called again... I’m having a moment of brain fart and want to make sure I am not missing anything.
---
If I get low on cores, i claim a work bench at a power plant and get the fusion core generator running. I did this a week ago and I still have more than I need.
---
Try it and let us know... for science!
---
I don't play on Adventure mode but there's new Survival weeklies every week. It's always nice seeing a friendly face out in the harsh wasteland! I don't expect you to be my bodyguard or anything, its just two heads are better than one!
---
Or, you know, you can always use reddit and youtube to find out what you are supposed to do, just in case you were interested in actually playing the game
---
I posted the other day about being able to apply the bone raider skin to my T-60's right arm, (and only the right arm). Made it look like the excavator w/bone raider but the stats stayed the same.
---
Crazy how Bethsoda went from one of the most respected and loved game makers to hated trash in two games
---
How has the fire not gone out?
---
the alcohol challenges were a pain in the ass but i was able to finish them.  just took way longer.  but in the last week or so they've had some challenges that are nearly impossible, kill a glowing creature in a rad storm (super rare event), just to name one.  the megasloth today is a pain, just have to server hop.  i'm convinced Bethesda is amping up the difficulty on the challenges so people earn less and open up their pockets to buy atom.
---
Pushed until May for tweaking.
---
Yeah if a team member or a friend travels to you camp they spawn in where the CAMP machine was initially placed when you chose your camp location. This for some reason doesn't work when you travel there.
---
I also got this
---
No mods are able to be attached since last patch.
---
Have no luck for this, tried few server hops and all those spawn location, but can't find Megasloth...
---
Why Trapper for sneak builds?
---
Are you on PC? I can craft you a level 50 one for free if you can provide the mats.
---
Yeah this pisses me off so much.
---
2h still
---
Certain weapons have a major lack of armour penetration an i think that's their weakness. Laser, Shotguns, explosives had a chunky nerf, it's hard to justify an explosive build that isn't reliant on rifleman/shotgun/heavy perks, ie, Grenade launchers/Missiles/Fat man. They're almost wholly mitigated against. Missile launchers 100% need a buff, they're so bad for their weight/damage offset.
---
I don't understand why the T51 is better than T60 and almost better than X01 too, almost wouldn't think they're later/more advanced models.
---
[i got it too](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-i7sVuh2YNuaYNVwT3WCiJPX8WMclnxW/view?usp=drivesdk)
---
They do, however the plan for the pole hook is missing. And currently you cant attach mods since last patch.
---
WoW did, Everquest did, pretty much every one of them cost that much 10-15 years ago. Expansions come out every 2 years or so that cost $20-40 as well, plus the $10-15 a month subscription.
---
As a fellow cliff-dweller, agreed.
---
thanks my dude, went there and server hopped a little till I got it.  i'd spawn in at bootlegger's shack and then head NW towards the grove and after 7 or 8 server hops, BAM there was the ugly bastard by the trees.  tyvm!!
---
That event unfortunately was time limited sorry.
---
I really hope they find a good way to integrate shops so it’s 1. Easy for players to find them and 2. No way to grief/loot them. Perhaps afk shops would be nice as well! Not sure how that could be implemented though.
---
You can farm them off the Sentry bots in White Springs. 100% drop, but the charge seems to vary between 25, 5p, and 75. 100 might be possible but I don't think so.
---
If you are quick you can loot them once before they blow up, and again after they blow up, for a total of 2 cores per sentry bot. Make sure you are close and spamming your Loot key as they die. About half the time you can get 2x the loot (nice source or aluminum and circuits, too). Nice little side bonus is that they give like 400-500 xp per kill, and there are more than half a dozen around the course.
---
Then you got to use wood to boil it then wood to cook. 
---
It’s silly. Dirty water should be fine to cook with, it’s like a bloody wood tax.
---
Ill give you $2.50 for it
---
I'm pretty sure it dropped from a workshop mission, but I know I've seen it at Studio 58 at Whitesprings
---
Nah, most of the time it's: "I've already got a pylon, stop standing around doing nothing and grab the last pylon you fuck!"
---
I don't see a Fallout76Prefs.ini in my Fallout76 folder.
---
Just noticed this today a friend pointed it to me lol
---
They won’t get mad but will be disappointed.
---
Hmm, sounds like you are getting screwed in that transaction
---
The event with masks is over, but that came out before Survival mode. That other poster kinda gave you the wrong information. The new update gave a nice addition with the Sheepsquatch questline. It culminates into an event that's equal in difficulty/rewards as the Scorchbeast Queen. Dunno why everyone on this subreddit gives half answers
---
On Xbox? Can craft them for you
---
Added you
---
Heh, them mutants with assault rifles an colonel/major gutsy's are a particular thorn, literally doing 10-15% of damage at times is fucking insane
---
He wasn't talking about Faschnacht really, he just got the two mixed up. Faschnacht came out before Survival
---
So only a few limited events and a new questline?
---
Good point. Its not every session you need to pick a lock.
---
So if 200 is reasonable they'll bump it up to 600 lol.
---
If you're on PC pick the amount of would you want and I'll donate it to you. Cheers
---
It's weird, because most of the comments I see about the new event are similar to this one.
---
Last night I did the event for the first time, activating it myself. As soon as the event started, about 10 other people showed up. I grabbed a pylon and instantly 2 other players did two. In about 60 seconds the imposter was dead and the event was completed; I think I used 2 stimpacks. Went a lot smoother than I had expected.
---
Yeah, licensing can be unbelievably expensive. One option is to license unheard-of musicians, the Cities Skylines approach to radio stations.  New Vegas had a couple tracks like that as well.
---
First time I've heard that the audio format is an issue but I don't doubt it.
---
Youtubers thrive on outrage culture. They don't have to look into anything if they know what they talk about will guarantee views.
---
Me personally have excavator ( when farming lead ore) and I'm usually in t51 just for looks since both my x01 and t51 have calibrated shocks, a jetpack and servos. I also store a t60 set but haven't modded it yet.
---
This happened to me yesterday too... odd bug considering I was closer to my camp than either of those places
---
If I've heard right, the items will be tied to your stash box. Should help with any looting problems.
---
Hi usually, I'm Mom.
---
It actually makes perfect sense and it's not a matter of a poor economy or cheap construction. Houses aren't built to stand the test of time without proper upkeep. A little too much rain without proper pumping floods basements and weakens foundations, a little too much snow without clearing rots and collapses roofs. Once either of those fail it just cascades from there.
---
Ooo that's a good idea.
---
I never said it was quick! Haha but yeah, Rivers work too depending on where you camp/cooking station is
---
I cant even access crafting stations anymore
---
I was coming here to see any improvement of the game so I could buy it...anyway, might check it out 2 months later.
---
I'm pretty sure most people have no idea what they're doing.  Fasnacht held your hand the whole time, this event actually relies on the player having read and listened well.  Bold assumptions IMHO.
---
I am a local (north of the bridge and moved away years ago though) and the southern end of the state was almost entirely reliant on the coal mines. They were the biggest employers and spenders in most towns and now that coal is on the way out a lot of those towns are dying it's sad really. It's also no surprise opiate abbuse is running rampant in those communities
---
Upvote for the post, sums it up nicely. 
---
Lemme be *that* guy and offer a couple of tips though.
---
1. Get your tag in on the imposter asap, even when it is not vulnerable, but don't try to damage it.
---
2. Recently, I _think_ it's been vulnerable with only 2 pylons active, not sure if this is a glitch.
---
3. If you're a conduit for a pylon and go down *DO NOT* give in if the imposter is vulnerable, you're keeping it that way until you give in.
---
4. Use the perk that gives you double time while you're down for reasons in point 3.
---
5. Fast travel to whitesprings 😁
---
I’ve been using a few cosmetic mods from the Nexus for 6 months with no issues, cosmetic mods change the look and feel of your local game.
---
Without the Scorch Beast mod ‘Reasonable Scorchbeast Scream Effects’ I’d never had reached end game through migraine and visual disturbances. 
---
For some people maybe older players these kind of changes make playing Fallout 76 possible.
---
hahaha dear lord keep it up man
---
I've got a screenshot of what you're talking about, I'm looking to see if anyone has found anything more
---
I hope you're right about that. I'd rather see songs, cosmetics, etc in the Atom shop too rather than time-savers or in-game items. But Bethesda is the Horse-Armor company, after all
---
Excavator with Calibrated Shocks has me at 440 max carry weight.
---
Should have collected some when I was camped near desth claw island. Oh well.
---
Thanks at least I’m not alone. Frustrating had to pay 29 caps there and 29 back to watoga. Hopefully a known bug with a fix in the works.
---
That would work but you would have to be able to put some limitations on the number that could be sold. For example I may want to sell super stim packs, but let’s say only 50 of 100 in my stash.
---
I agree, I would like to option to sell everything.. Vendors sell ammo, and its not cheap! Mods and plans are expensive too.. And leveled to get more expensive as you go. 
---
Im just going to keep hitting the blackwater mine alot and selling at the whitespring station til I'm mad rich lmao
---
Grounded stacks
---
That's awesome. Yeah, little touches to immersion like that would make the world more engaging.
---
Basically same. I got like 5 of those Fedoras now...one complete Sheepsquatch costume and Plans for The Fixer. Glad it doesn't require the original to build.
---
Yeah i hate how dirty inside brick is and while farm house is nice on the inside and out it has lame windows
---
if you cant see that the item is a p2w mechanic you must be blind.
---
if you cant see how Bethesda keep putting the middle finger on fans ass you are blind.
---
is facts.
---
won't really affect your gameplay unless you play pvp and even then it won't make a noticable diff   [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vo50b/updated\_power\_armor\_stats\_all\_sets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vo50b/updated_power_armor_stats_all_sets/)
---
But I just paid you $35.99 and I haven't left the store yet?
---
GS - Technically it's pre-owned now, $2.50 or else.
---
True
---
You can move your CAMP device which will move your spawn point.  Easier if you have a friend playing with you to test it.
---
No. There was the Faschnacht event, which was a week long event. That came out before Survival. It's been over for a while. Then survival came out a week after that, and last week a new questline came out with a permanent event that you will be able to repeat for as long as you gather the materials. Next Tuesday a new feature comes out, the game's first dungeon. Also you might have missed the first content update, but it was a moonshine questline which gave a new crafting ability and drinks with unique effects. So in total there have been four content updates, with another on the way Tuesday. Then on May 9th another questline will come out, this one faction-based
---
Irl the burning mine is in PA actually, McDowell country is just very rual
---
Thanks, will check today
---
&gt;I don't see how ANYONE has been able to save up 10,000 caps for the signs and letters plan.
---
My problem is I'm always so close to hitting the 25K max. This is kind of what I do and how I get caps:
---
Hard Bargain perk card maxed out.
---
Pharma Farmer maxed to get every chem I possibly can. I always get more chems than I use in the game (and I do use them) and I sell the excess to vendors.
---
Keep and run an Industrial Water Purifier. Between the purified waters I get from events and the water I farm from my one Industrial Water Purifier, I always have water to sell to vendors at 4 caps a piece.
---
Make and sell outfits if you can get a plan or two. I have the plans for both Union Soldier uniform and Civil War Dress, so I sell those when I have enough gold (Union Uniform, plus cloth) and crystal shards (Civil War Dress, plus cloth) to make them. If you're not sure what gives crystal shards, tag that in your pip boy, but off hand my best sources for crystal shards are magnifying glasses (easily found in WS), decanters and microscopes.

Farm junk, especially clipboards and life preservers (for springs), fans and typewriters (screws). Bulk and sell at vendors.
---
Then there's the weapons you pick up along the way - sell them or scrap for bulking later if they aren't worth carrying to sell.
---
Get Travel Agent perk card to keep fast travel costs down.
---
Keep your camp in an area conducive for keeping fast travel costs down (basically keep it somewhat near locations you want to travel to frequently).
---
Farm as many mats are you need by playing - don't buy anything you can't find by yourself for free in the game.
---
If given a choice between fighting super mutants or scorched, I will always pick super mutants because they give caps.
---
Learn where at least a few caps stashes are and hit them whenever you're in the area.
---
Use Grape Mentats for improved charisma and better prices at vendors.
---
Beer gives you a +1 charisma bonus for better prices, too.
---
Pick up junk when it's available and convenient. Scrap and stash until you're ready to bulk and sell to vendors.
---
Log in everyday if you want in order to sell everyday, even if you end up not really playing that day.
---
That item is in so many MMOs and other games it's not even funny don't be ignorant.
---
For me it's more like I fast travel and have to wait 2 minutes for the enemies to load while I'm constantly dying.
---
Ah cool, seems like i returned in an exciting time
---
It's pretty pricey to repair I believe. But I'm living in my excavator armor exclusively so my actual knowledge is limited.
---
Got fucking bullets coming out my ass but can’t get more than 16 screws together at once
---
I'm not sure honestly, it seemed like it just had the same stuff as a 1* or none
---
The coal mines have shaft drilled to pump air to miners and there is a ton of fuel. But op is wrong the mine is in PA
---
Cheers
---
I fall in the water leaving uranium fever every Fucking time.  I mean every time.  I can attest it does not work under water. Marsupial doesn't help either.
---
I think he is. He took a break before survival and mentioned an event with various masks. If not, the other event is the end of a new questline. I don’t want to spoil you the quest and the event OP, it’s pretty cool imo.
---
Yeah, they have content planned for the next year that's shown in the road map. With how much they're adding, to me it kinda shows that most of this stuff was supposed to be in the base game
---
Added u
---
Eh. Just a suggestion.  
---
I just communicate with them or spot the marker myself.  
---
Can’t deny I’d love a hot pink pipboy/HUD though. And do they have colorblind settings? I don’t think I’ve noticed if they do.
---
Max lvl White Knight makes this not a big concern though. And repair to 200% keeps it going longer before needing repair.
---
I think they should make some more wall types even if they just put it in the atom shop I would be happy
---
Yep its a bug.
---
I’m an English major and I have honestly had this exact same thought, lmao. There’s so much subtext and background lore that eerily parallels the current situation with late capitalism in America. There’s an absolute wealth of material there to write a huge scholarly article on.
---
Awesome.  Hope you get them!
---
Of course. I think it would work the same as player trading where you can do just that.
---
As a thought, this can be a dangerous game to play with your mutations. I tried to do it before, but totally forgot to reequip them when I used radaway.
---
I only repaired my x01 once and i'm lvl 300 :P, melee prolly has to do alot more repairs though
---
That would be tough without re-specing your build as shotguners need strength while snipers need perception. If you did something like a sniper build and got the perk cards for automatic weapons, it would be easy to swap out cards to change classes without having to move stat points around. Hope that helps!
---
Costumes help a lot, finding a girlfriend who is handy with a needle and glue stick will be a great addition to the team.
---
I still have a sniper build, using bolt rifles
---
Yeah, I got mobbed in Garrahan Mining Headquarters and it only gave me the choice of respawning up at Cliffwatch. I just killed the game and logged back in, it put me at my camp up in Morgantown.
---
I believe there is a perk in endurance that reduces rad levels during the day time. I used this when i couldnt get starched lvl 2 and it never took my mutations.
---
although ultracite dosn't have jetpack or stealthboy if you want either of thoose
---
Definitely if they add wallpapers they can have all my atoms
---
Bloodied railway rifle
---
I hate when people jut tag and sit by and try to let everyone else do the work
---
20 hours per Besdetha
---
Sometimes you have to wait in the area for the server to catch up with you and it'll finally show up. Just walk 50 ft away wait a min and go back. 
---
I believe it's 20 hrs but I doubt know for sure.
---
people still selling serums for 250 on ps4
---
I used to do this because I didn't know better then someone made an excellent post outlining all the different armors strengths and weaknesses. Now I only use x-01 in nuke zones, t51 for everyday grinding, and excavator when I have too much crap and want to travel.
---
long range weapons shred close aswell 
---
shottys suck at range and are not that good close up either (except pvp explosive i supose)
---
I haven’t died doing it yet, I feel like a lot of people just have builds that make them very squishy
---
I was wonderinf about this...i have been in 3 ws nukes since patch and i have not seen one ghoul in the clubhouse ever
---
It’s happened to me around 5-7 times since the survival mode was introduced. I normally quit out but paid the caps because I had junk to retrieve and a three star legendary enemy I was fighting.
---
I only use heavy guns since getting it. I have a .50 cal, gatling gun, and gatling plasma on me at all times, and the 3 combined weigh less than a rifle.
---
But the game GIVES you caps for achievements.
---
ha ha I love it
---
🤢
---
&gt; 'If there's fast travel mats, visitors will travel and be placed in evil traps!' and thinking that's the best reasoning we have available
---
But if someone can fast travel to your camp then they're on your team so the traps won't actually do anything, right?
---
It's open because they're going to add new content. 
---
Her last holotape had acliffhang
---
They can stand still all they want there bag will be the only thing left when you use a fat man
---
Yea my SO said she nearly died trying to get this shot
---
Well, it and the Excavator are the easiest to get a full set of Armor since you actually build them and it offered the better protection. I still haven’t gotten a T-60 helm (I’m using a T-45, though I’m thinking about cutting out that armor anyway and replacing it with Excavator since it’s not really functionally different from my T-51b) and up until last week my T-51b was using a level 30 helm. 
---
That and it’s probably still seen as the “end game” armor given that it’s the last armor you are given access to as a player, and in Fallout 4 it was the strongest all around, and also the last one to spawn, and if there is one thing I’ve learned from playing other online games... it’s that player love flaunting the “best” things.
---
The other glaring issue is how are they going to make shops easy to find? I do not necessarily want others to be able to fast travel to my base. It would seem the answer probably lies in making a centralized shopping area (similar to whitespring) or be able to place a shop like campsite (separate from your regular camp site) that people can fast travel to.
---
YES
---
Sounds like you need calibrated shocks
---
I do
---
Trapper boasts the largest Radiation resistance and a low weight. It’s great for people who don’t take a lot of damage but struggle with the environment and weight costs.
---
Not to mention, it’s much easier to find viable legendary trapper armor due to the fact that it spawns in only one sturdy variant. Perhaps they may change or buff this in the future.
---
Not to mention how slow it is collecting dirty water from a pump, even when hitting “drink” then spamming “collect”... if I want to make a stack of 8 soups plus alcohol for my build or doing a daily mission I’m going to be “playing” staring at the water pump for a while... seriously some of the daily make alcohol quests can take a hundred water to complete, before they were needed anyway.
---
Had two Scorched do the same at my camp southeast of Watoga. Destroyed most of my house.
---
Oh you like the good stuff.
---
Perfect Fallout
---
right? Makes me wonder where the screw drivers being stored.. As far as immersion goes, It would be nice if you needed a pickaxe to mine ore, and a hatchet to collect wood. They could be stored in  a separate inventory tab to keep the pip boy clean.
---
Perhaps THIS is the event someone should nuke....
---
Might just be waiting for the patch in 2 days.
---
Thank you and I agree
---
4
---
Except for adhesive, for some reason
---
What item is pay to win? Repair kits? Or just anything from the shop?...
---
maybe some kind of reward if you are the conduit for so many minutes of the event? better shot at a rare drop or something?
---
Well if that’s your argument then wouldn’t marine armor be better considering it can weigh less than a pound with ultra-light, has radiation resistance, comes in one variant, and has better dr/er than trapper.
---
But you got a Fasnacht mask a few weeks ago, didn't you?
---
That, I don't know. I wondered if they would make icons for vendor sites, even though everyone will need to have them at their camps. It's a good idea for seperate, buildable, "stores" but, I suspect, that that would add to server instability. 
---
I'm gonna bet a box of doughnuts that they basically just make those camps visible for those that want to sell. Camp attack would just be part of the risk of wanting to be a vendor.
---
It's just a thermobaric reaction of the highly unstable uranium-231 contained in blood of glowing ghouls when it becomes exposed to the superheated air that results from the rapid decay of the released uranium-235 and plutonium-239 fallout particles of an atomic bomb.
---
What platform? I can sell u a level 50 fixer
---
They may add a recipe to convert purified water to boiled. That would prevent them from duplicating all recipes.
---
From what I've heard there isn't a "cap" per se, but it does time out after a few seconds. Whether that only applies to your last hit (as long as you keep hitting you keep increasing damage) or there's a timer for \*each\* hit (you can keep hitting but the boost from a few attacks ago times out, effectively creating a cap) idk. I do know my Furious/Swing Speed/+STR Pole Hook does visible damage to SBQ's health bar after a few hits, but unless people use enough strategy to cripple it I can't stack more than maybe 10-15 hits at a time.
---
Just go stand in a river and spam collect, you can easily get 300+ in a minute.
---
I did the quest and got the ultracite power armor. It was 0 carry weight until I pulled out to look at it when i recalled it bow its 10lbs. I was like WTF
---
In the last day of beta, i decided to run east till the servers went offline at level 10. I ran into a deathclaw at night and ran off a cliff but got saved by a rock halfway down as the deathclaw fell the whole way and died. In my excitement of potential loot and, i jumped down the rest of the way and lost my sliver of health.
---
Fought it 3 times, and every time it poofs out before it gets dropped.
---
I have the ultracite pa and I find it to be pretty durable and with the right perks not expensive to repair.
---
Lost so much scrap this way.
---
I solo'd a 3-star Behemoth, and all i got was a 1-star .44 :(
---
I like it. I wish I had a 1h I can use with power armour that was good at damage, but I really don't like all rise because of the 2h slowness. I normally stay outside PA because my mole rat gauntlet hits faster and does more damage every hit. But my Gatling is go-to as I'm pretty much invincible as I poke 'em from afar and chop them up as soon as they come near, and any poke I suffered is healed. I don't like low health bloodied weapons because I play on Xbox and I get lag spikes too much where I can't trust it enough to play that way
---
Was it the one of her ‘bleeding out’ at the hotel type thing?
---
It's ridiculous that the weapons in '76 are so restricted compared to FO4. The weapons system is also built entirely wrong for a PvP game.
---
No you did not.
---
I use https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
I have 2 heavy gun pals here's their build, CHR and END differ between the two and one goes higher INT for Batteries included

---
Ive completed the event twice, failed it twice, and had this happen to me four times.
---
Agreed. Youtuber content creators are glorified news casters an will spin anything for views. 
---
Granted some are not awful.
---
I like the T60, I got the plans for the BOS Knight paint so I went with it. I've spent most of my caps on mods for it.
---
yikes, just noticed this
---
There may be more? I've heard of the one in PA.
---
I wish my experience was that good.  I want that fedora but am 1 for 4 or 5 now.  Won my first one, failure every time after.
---
I've started 2 seen 4 others and only completed 1 due to this problem
---
My extended family is from a small town near pikeville in Kentucky. Same deal. Coal towns, and some homes that wouldn't look out of place 80 years ago. The only growth industries are walmart, and places treating black lung. 
---
So all the stuff I see in game, rings very true. It's heart wrenching if you been to the region. :(
---
West Tek cliff?
---
Troubleshoters weapons are great once its vulnerable
---
My friend jumped off the New River Gorge Bridge, so I did too :(
---
And I don't know how likely this would be but it would be awesome if they added in different containers with different lock picking mini games.
---
Not sure if the effort to improve lock picking would make them money though...
---
Depends on how many people are asking for it in the community.
---
If you play with a friend from time to time you can ask him to be the "middle man" between your character and your mule, been doing this since they revealed the leg-vendor. Probably have about 3-4k lbs of legendaries for the vendor stacked up across a few toons.
---
There’s no point in DR/ER if the player doesn’t get hit anyhow. It’s best to maximize the radiation.
---
Though marine is decent and good, it’s a hybrid of those normal armors, for people who want protection from all sources.
---
Radiation is the real concern for those who don’t need DR and ER, and trapper does that best. The weight is also quite low as well with trapper.
---
I got them, thank you though.
---
Transfer caps to spare/new character via a friend.
---
With the nerfing of the ballistic weapons, the game is basically The Elder Scrolls. So shields make perfect sense. I use mainly melee now, not because I want to, but because that's the only way to do the best damage.
---
How? Like I don’t think this game is anywhere near as bad as some reviewers made it out to be at launch, but what RPG elements besides character build does this game have? What quests allow for player choice to have a meaningful impact on the game?
---
Kinda depends upon where you would invest the point otherwise.
---
I do not use PA and have 1 pt assigned to it but I am commando with auto rifle and melee. If I had a melee focused build, perhaps I would add another at the expense of action boy or a VATS related perk.
---
It’s happening to a lot of people I love this game but I’m sad to say if Tuesday doesn’t fix it I’m gonna have to log a ticket and ask for some advice from Bethesda.
---
I’ve heard recently they told a friend when he logged a ticket to uninstall the game delete all saved data and then open his PS4 in safe mode and reconstruct the hard drive and then resinstall the game. 
---
This will take me literally like 8-10 hours due to horrible internet and I’m not sure I can be away from the game for that long ! Lol :-)
---
But hopefully Tuesdays update fixes it! Because the animation /input lag is literally ruining the game for me right now it’s close to unplayable especially in PvP :-( and I love survival :-( :-(
---
Fo76 is so much better for RP than any other Fallout, and they really set up the story so you could have been anyone. The only real story requirement is: you're from a vault, and you're considered the best of the best at whatever you did before the war
---
For a hunter character, I would go with camo weapons/armor and stick to the Mire. Be a Free-stater. Maybe a rifle, tracking big game like Scorchbeasts and hunkering down in a bunker you made
---
For a BoS player, I would try to use PA whenever you can, maybe energy weapons/big guns. and set up a fort in the Bog to pick up where the old guard left off, guarding the rest of the region from Scorchbeasts
---
Me too!
---
I don't waste my time or resources on her anymore. I go around and collect flux.
---
This is it, right here IMHO...best advice.
---
And it can all be fixed by simply reading.
---
The fights I get to in survival last about 1-5 seconds and in that time either I or the opponent drop dead. I can't see how people with end game gear could survive hard fighting for 30 minutes? What is your level and armors/weapons and what level the opponent was?
---
Banned.
---
Not to mention custom rounds. 
---
I miss hunting deathclaws.. it was so much more exciting and gratifying.
---
Yes! Best way 10/10
---
I get plenty of good drops off doing it. It’s also soloable. Did it last night. It took about 5 minutes but still did it.
---
Aye?
---
Party Girl, Magnetic Personality and Herd Mentality Mutation+strange in numbers, that's before Leg armor.
---
i have a base 13 Chr to share 5star perks with my team but all they want is Rad Sponge man :(
---
Fasnacht masks and crafting "vintage nuka shine" are much higher priorities than a stable game.
---
I repaired armor, played for 5-10 minutes longer....logged off to attend to something, logged back on and the armor was broken again....and you guessed it, the materials to repair were gone.
---
I have a spare outfit
---
As someone who currently lives in Huntington, I was super disappointed. I wanted to make my camp at my apartment off of Marshall’s campus ☹️
---
Right? It’s so much easier than placing each power armor frame and having to guess.
---
Solid colors should be free maybe tie them to a dumb quest with a paint bot like biv
---
1. These "leaving 76" posts are so annoying and unnecessary. Don't announce that you're leaving, just go. No one cares that much.
---
2. At level 35, you went after it WAY too early. That's meant for people, at a minimum, who are level 50. Everything maxes at either level 45 or 50, so you need to be level 50+ before you even think about going into a silo to drop a nuke.
---
Oops sorry though it was the imposter my bad
---
PSN? I’ll invite you
---
Indeed. The game really does feel like they took Fallout 4 and simply modded it for multiplayer. The result is a Fallout game that is lacking in both the single and multiplayer experience.
---
All they have to do for shields is have them give you another piece of armor with DR/ER on it that you can block with like the current system, dot have them negate damage just lessen it when you shield and passively from resistance. They can only be used with one handed weapons. It would be a great addition to one hand builds as the most people just run 2H melee or non-pistols. Balance features to make them not mandatory: make them heavy, can’t ADS while shield is up but you can hipfire with a small accuracy penalty, can’t shield while reloading.
---
I'm pretty sure for some reason when I have that caps perk on and use it it takes around 44 hours for them to come back. When I dont use the perk it sometimes refreshes in 22 hours but not dependably
---
You wouldn't expect anything less really tho anymore .
---
Or maybe unique, recognizable loot boxes, like in borderlands. They would be placed in hard to reach locations but you'd see them from a distance and it would encourage exploring.
---
Spawn at The Thorn. IMMEDIATELY run due North. There is a random encounter location just a few second's sprint in that direction. Occasionally it will spawn a single megasloth fighting 2 yao-guai and a dead baby megasloth. You better be quick and kill the sloth, because the two yao-guai generally tear it apart in a matter of seconds, especially if they spawn high level. Server hop till you get it.
---
They already removed slap damage and they're removing structure damage. Contesting workshops is the ONLY pvp activity left in the game and the only one that actually fits the "you have something I want" rationale for attacking another player. If you don't want to risk having to actually defend something then stop claiming workshops.
---
Lol... I get out. There's a ladder out.  Let a lady show you where sometime lol
---
Hm, may be an unpopular opinion but I like the coming concept of combat only if reciprocated (both players consent).
---
I think it’s dumb to be killable when minding your own business in a camp or workshop, but I do like Hunter/Hunted when others are good sports and playing for fun, as well as some good-hearted PVP once in a while, and I think the system of reciprocated consenting to battle can help that.
---
Supply and demand.
---
What value would a bot have with your junk?
---
PC? Running any mods?
---
Happens to me after a patch/update usually, need to amend the resource archive list.
---
Why is radiation a concern though, if you’re not getting hit then you shouldn’t be getting radiated. And the radiation resistance it provides is irrelevant when it comes to a nuke zone because regardless of how much it provides it will never be enough to survive in a nuke zone anyway. 
---
So you’re saying it’s better to sacrifice dr and er for rr when rr is the least relevant of the the three resistances no matter how you chalk it up. I’d rather have the dr/er.
---
Claiming workshops is asking for pvp interactions, I guess they could make it so you can just go lower their flag if the owner isn't in the direct vacinity, that wouldn't be terrible. That's basically the only still existing activity that you can get you pvp killed without consciously and directly engaging an enemy. Sure they can attack your base and try to goad you into it but you still have to fire on them. There's plenty of other ways to get resources so it just seems very easy to avoid if it's a negative experience for someone.
---
A explosive flamer shoots like this but it’s doesn’t feel right.
---
Ive looked and looked. Couldnt ever find one. Makes sense though..my wife has to show me where the ketchup is in the fridge after i looked 12 times too.
---
"You're being blind to the facts I'm trying to tell you"  
---
Proceeds to provide not a single fact.    
---
OK bro.  All I read is a person taking zero responsibility for themselves. Nobody lied to you. Nobody is obligated to hold your hand like a small child. And you even admit in your example that Wargame is "fair."  Something that is fair is literally, by definition, the opposite of trickery.   
---
So yeah I'm gonna stand by my statement that it's people like you who are the problem.
---
That sounds really boring to me.
---
Yes but it every camp is near a water source. I shouldn’t have to fast travel to have best dirty water when I have a pump pulling fresh clean water from my camps soil. Also I’m pretty sure my alcohol would taste better if it wasn’t made from polluted water.
---
i have the paddle ball
---
Is this the one in the[ pipe?](/spoiler) if so I found it on the top floor on the desk.
---
I think this is what it’s supposed to be, 2 player teams at each pylon keeping eachother alive while the rest of the group tried to take her down.  
---
I’ve never seen it work,  it i try each time! 
---
A better indication of who the conduits are might help, if they where glowing blue more people might realize to help them.
---
Interesting, I will keep an eye on a few of these for the next couple hours and see if I get a similar result. Should be approaching 44 on a couple pretty soon.
---
Lots of people play on WiFi (myself included) with no issues, I’d wager it’s something else, if not his personal WiFi network.
---
Good write up. I always try to hold on to mine until i get 3 or 4 for multiple locations.  I've gotten some pretty good plans from them
---
The best spot that i've found is the "Moonshiner's Shack" just south of V76. 99% of the time there's 4 ticks, one of which got that sweet crown. Whenever i get low on stims i just serverhop there for about an hour and i'll have enough stims for a month
---
I may have to start sticking up on these then thank you.
---
when’s the next one
---
Thank you I’ll check it out.
---
True. But it would become trivial if you could also sell ammo.
---
That spot works good and right next to it there’s the lumber mill that has some ticks too
---
Me.
---
I’ve noticed this is an issue with the half walls. I don’t tend to get the walls clipping into the ground unless I use those.
---
That is true, if I could make things out if purified water I'd love it. I have about 30 water purifiers at my base (yes it takes up a crap ton of electricity) that pumps out a load of water. But sadly it's not how the game works.. just letting you know that's the fastest way.
---
What platform are you at?
---
I believe it’s 50% but you could be right.
---
For info purposes, this doesn't seem to work for me. Drexxy23 pointed out that using the Cap Collector perk seems to double the reset timer, I should have a couple I looted about 2 days ago I can check, I'll report back on rough timer.
---
Huh? It’s trivial to play your own music, there is zero need for any integration.  It’s why we have multitasking operating systems.  Silly request.
---
Next Sunday. Time is not yet determined. I can IM you when it is if you'd like
---
Seriously? It's not all about AI missions/checks. Go role play with some friends.
---
Oh... guess i dont need to keep looking for them now....
---
Four? Dammit, I have only found three so far... and none in the shop itself...
---
Found the yao-guai and the wolf ones in Lewisburg train station and the one with the two girls in Grafton train station.
---
Which one is the fourth one?
---
I am from WV never heard of a perpetual mine fire in the state
---
I am a shotty/sniper build!  I rock the following SPECIALs:
---
Strength 12
---
Perception 15
---
Endurance 1
---
Charisma 1
---
Intelligence 4
---
Agility 12
---
Luck 12
---
Strength goes to Strong Back and Shotgunner
---
Perception goes to Rifleman, Tank Killer, and Concentrated Fire
---
Intelligence is for weapon crafting (I swap perks depending on what is being crafted)
---
Agility is for sneak related perks
---
Luck for critical hit / AP perks
---
Maybe this but I find it more fitting if it was like 200 for each bundle. For example, a pink paint job bundle for all the PA sets and the same for all the other colors.
---
Thank you I’ve slowly been working on this and killing those annoying things
---
This would be fine if you could have the ability to give up the workshop once contested without having to go into PvP. Also if you're not subject to being killed anywhere on the map. It should just be the zone around the workshop area since that's what the challenger supposedly wants.
---
Yeah, I’ve been reading posts about this all the time.  Here on Reddit, in this sub.
---
You can literally screw with random people like a raider or help them like a responder, wear clothes to suit a faction or style you want to emulate, share perks in a squad like a hybrid version of D&amp;D I played a while back. There is nobody you have to pledge service to, it’s just how you as a person would live in the Fallout Universe
---
Yeah I just found my new fav camp site. Lots of blight and glowing resin to make vodka/hard lemonade and blight soup for crits. Problem is there’s no water for some distance... miss my riverside moonshine camp.
---
Xb1. I don’t think it’s even possible for me to run mods
---
I find I use less stimpacks if I just grab all 3 of the damn pylons and let people get on with it.
---
Otherwise you're bleeding until the event fails.
---
So just spray and pray with an auto pipe weapon?
---
My bitch is louder then me with his music so I can't use the mic anyways unless I want everyone to hear Nicki Minaj and Christina Aguilera on blast and repeat.
---
Happened to me few times: you die, then fall through geometry, then respawn at nearest location just to ... immediately start falling through geometry again, die, respawn, repeat. 
---
Even if you jump to fast travel the moment you respawn, you will start falling the moment your new location is loaded. 
---
 The only cure is to respawn at Vault 76 (somehow few meters around the spawn has stable mesh, but don’t try to walk away from it), don’t move, restart game completely.

Well next time you're out doing an event see if you're near a river and just go to town.

Let me know if you need any, I’m doing trades instead of caps though.

Yeah,  that's my life.
---
rename your reshade dxgi.dll to d3d11.dll and it will still work.
---
I mean I'm not the one to throw the stone first, it happened that there were lowlevels who I killed before I realised their low level, but I generally let them be.

With 600+ hours on a crafting focused character, the only .50 mod I have for the hunting rifle is refined .50, and it's the same damage as a hardened receiver.
---
Fallout 76 hunting rifle hardened vs refined 50 cal https://imgur.com/a/MLeseRL
---
Darn. Wish it were something simple like that.
---
I meant, I save up 3 or 4 for the same location.
---
But... a few seconds at any pond or river will give you piles of water to boil. Unless you're short on wood it should be a non issue.
---
Can I buy it for a realistic amount? Not 7k.
---
Well excuse me for not seeing any :P
---
I just picked up a two-shot crossbow (thanks to another reddit user!) and I love using it. But, I wish there were some ways to modify it. I would like to see some sort of scope for it, b/c as it is, it's kinda difficult to aim from distances. Craft different types of arrows would be nice (explosive, poison-tipped, etc). Actually the poison-tipped reminds me of the dart gun from FO3, which was great for slowing down Deathclaws.
---
I unlocked 90% (give or take) of the mods in armor/weapons using treasure maps.
---
Depending on location you can get things like Ultracite Lasers/Marine Armor and other fairly 'expensive' to craft items.
---
Some of the mounds are even close to workbenches.
---
It is a good thing that people sell them.
---
PSA: if you dig with party members nearby they get some loot per dig too.
---
If you don't see a Fallout76Prefs.ini file then you are definitely not working in the correct folder. It should be C:\Users\{username}\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76xxx.ini
---
I have a brotherhood compound (it's as accurate as I can get it with the pieces currently in game) on the edge of the map, like right up against the border, and I'll usually spawn outside the border, so I can't move, just look at my camp.
---
I like the pirate idea.  Never used a blackpowder rifle but the pistol is brilliant on my build.  You might want to grab the blunderbuss if you're going for authenticity.
---
That being said I've only seen one person using a flamer so there's a huge novelty factor to that, and a lot of perk cards that work with fire.
---
I run perk loadout, better inventory, and save everything. I’ve been running them all since BETA. No issues.
---
Go back to taxidermy place and look on the billboards with strings and the map i think its on the second floor
---
Would make sense to remove auto-pvp in workshops since they're doing it everywhere else. Since people currently abuse the mechanics of Workshops by having one person activate the flag and their friend snipe you no matter where you are on the map. I don't think the intended function of Workshop PvP was to allow people to put you into PvP when you're not at the workshop.
---
It would be a fine mechanic to let me waltz onto you property and contest the ownership. I'd go into PvP mode and it would be up to you to either defend or leave. If you don't defend, you'll lose ownership. So it doesn't remove the PvP aspect of it, but it does remove forced PvP without warning and the exploit.
---
The person stealing it could or could not become wanted, I don't think a wanted flag would be necessary since the option to allow the ownership to change hands falls onto the current owner.
---
Yeah that's more a forgetting to get either problem lol. Besides I was mostly just curious as to why we can't do it.
---
Yeah WV is the pits. Why do you think they have an opioid epidemic over there? But hey, 45 says he’s gonna make it great again so we will see
---
They should also add dragons, magic, vampires and gods! I'd actually be totally happy if they cut and pasted the entirety of skyrim in for me to go stomp around in power armor... it could be an alcohol or chem hallucination.... actually sounds kinda fantastic.
---
Got mine on a queen fight luckily
---
Liar, girlz don’t play games &gt;~&lt; 
---
I’m being facetious, power armor is actually great for a few builds, especially heavy weapons and melee. I feel you on the anxiety part though, I wear a bunch of deep pocketed armor so if I get over encumbered I hop out, take my power armor, and fast travel back to camp before I get murdered
---
That sucks! Can you even take it down with 2? I’d think you’d spend half your time on adds
---
Yes. Keep searching and eventually a player nay use it.
---
 The Mothman blesses you with his presence, bröther
---
I believe they only drop from treasure maps and possibly events now. Specifically in the Toxic Valley. Bethesda has said they're adding them back to vendors at some point in the near future.
---
Thanks. Some resources indicate that replaying in a certain order will clear the quest. Good to know that's misleading.
---
That's the last one - yes.
---
I think a simple solution would be to add a prompt asking if you would like to initiate x event and then another prompt asking if you would like to request assistance (an event becon/flare would be let off and the event icon added to the map).
---
Did you sell head? Post was deleted so im not sure, not trying to poach someone elses trade.
---
dude literally spam a lake, get some wood with that wood gather perk, boil water, and make whatever u needed to make.
---
*The Brotherhood of Steel wants to know your location*
---
If you have 18 holotapes, yep you are done. For now.
---
Not sold yet, other post I believe might’ve been too new to comment
---
I don’t like how the mission doesn’t end then.
---
I'd probably be the dumbass that would use my vampires ripper to regen health in the sbq fight
---
Yeah yeah, I'm a Fucking unicorn. Insert eyeroll here.  
---
I play a tank build mostly, so I'm armored and beat the Shit out of everyone.
---
My apologies, didn’t mean to say that...
---
I got a drill on top of those, i must be special.
---
Not for me since I actually did the quest line and the one I activated was the first I saw that event, I also took my time to read the terminals and notes from the questline so I kinda knew what to expect, it was certainly a lot more dangerous than I thought it would be though
---
Or you could just, you know, check?  If it’s important to you.  You don’t need a prompt and it is not a good use of dev resources to add a feature like this.
---
Weird. I'm guessing it's a similar cause but it'd have to have been BGS bodging something during update. Funny, they never do that... :p
---
I think there will be more to come. She might appear in the dungeons, she might turn into a scorched... who knows.
---
Slightly off-topic but... is this a new thing?
---
Just last week I did a bit of good old fashioned post-nuke WS farming... well, the ~~nerfed to hell~~ 'rebalanced' version of it anyway and glowing ones were roaming the grounds as expected...
---
I have in the past on very rare occasions found robots spawning instead of glowing ones but they were max level, not lvl 1.
---
Get Gud!
---
You were Level 35 which is why you failed!
---
Bump.
---
Reverse Chris Brown?
---
Killing her will make my day.
---
I’m fairly sure crossbow gets dmg up with sharpshooter and what not so it’s good in that department but honestly if you could craft deadlier arrows or arrows do more damage to players or mobs then Id run in honestly but rn it’s eh to me
---
Ok, thanks! Just tell me this: is the password *in* the bunker somewhere?
---
This was the first thing I did for all my frames.  I haven't finished collecting all the pieces for each kind yet either, so I think I'm going to update the name to include the pieces I still need.  For example:
---
* PA - T-60 LL
---
Just need the Left Leg (LL) to complete this set.  Or if you still have a lower level piece you need to swap out for a higher level:
---
* PA - T-45 RL25, T15
---
Great suggestion! Also add the ability for accounts to go into debt to stop people off loading caps to alts or friends.
---
Radio beacons, they put out a channel you can tune to and it gives you a marker
---
The keypads of the console face inwards of the triangle the event takes place in. Not that hard to run by and click them quickly.
---
I have a friend that got a dog helmet, A HELMET FOR A COMPANION
---
Cheers :) will check it out tomorrow.
---
Same offer on ps4, happy to mod one for you.
---
Dude you’re pressing one extra button, it takes less than a second to do
---
&gt;My inventory weight dropped by about 30 lbs and my total carry capacity went up by 5 lbs.
---
Makes sense.   Both were deep pocketed but the new one has +1 str and your inventory weight drop depends on how much in weapons you were carrying.
---
I see robots cutting into ghouls and such all the time. 
---
I image if you went to a morgue and cut yourself with used equipment you'd probably catch something.
---
Seriously? Since when I'm the game does "activate" mean something other than stand by a control panel/button and press x. 
---
If you mean how it functions in the lore, maybe you should do the quest. 
---
Wait until you actually try to summon it yourself, then let's talk.
---
its been in game since beta
---
Lol you load faster than the buildings and would probably spawn in the foundation.... Maybe like a home plate or mat that had to be in dirt like plants so you could at least spawn inside your camps parameter. That wood be coo!
---
The nerf to survival is the reason why some many people are experiencing this more and more.
---
Probably glitches due to load times! You load faster than buildings!
---
We need an option to have our own customized robot vendor stand in for us when were offline.
---
Maybe even have a personal radio broadcast for your camp to attract  players.
---
Yes!
---
The Greenbrier wasn't built in 1778, it was built in 1913. The Greenbrier during that time was just a hotspot, while during the mid 1850s it was a different resort.
---
me too!
---
I have seen the same post almost once a week since launch and every time I will up vote it. 
---
 Definitely need to be able to cook with purified water.
---
Or the "lore" reason for about half of the things in the game...
---
Yeah. That's also a rough estimate from memory. 
---
The weapon weight reduction can be a definite plus if you want to use strength perks for something other than carry weight reduction like I do.
---
Sweet, thanks again! I didn't want to waste my time searching for something that was just for aesthetic.

I'll take the chance on evil traps if I can materialize in front of my crafting tables every time! Still odd how they really haven't identified why they won't implement this.
---
Is your gamertag the same? I'd like to partake in your offer.
---
X01 looks the best in my humble opinion, and I’m not a max-min-er so the stats are fine
---
When I tried that, it insta-killed me the second I placed ONE foot on the helmet of my power armor.  :(
---
That damned bag.. in the middle.. mocking me.
---
^ This.
---
I find that the whole 'ambushing the workshop owner anywhere on the map without warning' an exploitative abuse of the mechanic.
---
As it turns out however the devs disagree; they have done nothing about this in five months yet they were pretty much on the ball patching the whole 'fortifying the workbench' thing.
---
If actions speak louder than words that is a message that came through loud and clear.
---
Huh. I could have sworn I read a couple weeks ago that it was built in 1778 and then while reading Washington’s biography it mentioned the thing about the expensive colors. 
---
Must have been misremembering dates. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I wonder if the new backpack system will basically make power armor obsolete aside from hoarders in excavator suits trying to eke out every last ounce of carry capacity.  The advantages of conventional armor with sentinel/cavalier (just the third star effect, not the -player damage/-15% combo) enhancements is just so, so, so much better defensively if you're not using a sneak build (sentinel doesn't apply when crouched).  Granted, you can just go to your crafting station and whip up a few varieties of power armor that are much better than standard stuff, and getting a full sentinel/cavalier set takes considerable effort.
---
&gt;!Take the sheepsquatch impostor for example.  With five pieces of sentinel armor, assuming one piece has a troubleshooter's first effect, you're untouchable for that specific fight.  I have to assume there's a hard cap on how much outright damage negation you can stack, because 5 sentinel + 1 troubleshooter would be 105% and that seems wrong.  Then again, this is Fo76 where min/maxers discover new metas that seemingly never occurred to the dev team, goalposts are moved around constantly and "oopsie let's fix that" is normal.  I LOVE the game, but it's just a fact.!&lt;
---
In all my hours of farming I've found maybe two pieces of sentinel armor. To say it "Only" requires a full sentinel set is kinda dumb.
---
KnowledgeHound. Just in silo rn can craft them later
---
Ive never heard of one period
---
Sounds good. Thanks.
---
Thats more or less how it went, on the one occasion I managed to get there.  90% of the time though for me it goes like this:
---
"Oh an event!  Lets fast travel."
---
Click.
---
Click click.
---
Click click click.
---
Nothing happens.
---
I was a axed at how crappy the wiki was. Acid extractors aren't even described in the resources section. So there is a lot of work that needs to be done. I'd be happy to help, just need to figure out how to contribute.
---
If you're into heavy weapons, bear arms is a must. Can carry all your big boys for the same weight of a single rifle
---
Why are you able to get a companion helmet
---
Ah, you don’t care, but you needed to tell me you don’t care... sounds like you care bud.
---
I actually had a really good time with this the other night. I'm level 63ish. Went in not having done much of the questline. Had no idea what was going on. But i started shooting eyebombs, gutsies... did a little damage to the impostor. Got blown up once and no one helped, but no one stole my junk, either. Got back in, ran out of bullets, said what the hell and put on my clawing deathclaw claw and just jumped at the fakesquatch. Actually did some damage. Died right at the end, but someone DID revive me. I found someone else dead, and revived THEM. And somewhere along the line i earned a 'squatch costume, my first 3 star legendary ever (a weapon), and 2 and 1-star legendary armor pieces that really improved my badassness instead of being useless. Probably the 2nd or 3rd most fun time i've had in 76 so far.
---
A. How do you find exploration boring with only 55 hours in?
---
B. Level 35 is way too low of a level to even try to clear a silo. "Advanced gear" my arse 
---
C. No one cares your leaving
---
The game had some glaring issues that mostly were fixed. Still was a buggy hellscape and no excuse can make up for it, but I do give credit for fixing it, unlike most games nowadays.
---
If you have a camp in the mire get used to staying sick. And the diseases will stack so yeah... The Mire is a good place to loot but horrible to live. I know by experience
---
Also in the game world this region was being hit hard economically. All the strikes and riots and stuff. Jobs lost to automation from robotics etc. then massive polluting from the industries. It didn’t need the bombs to fall to look like that.
---
Keep flushing missles, fuel, and nukes from my inventory. Seems like it's always missles that keep showing up.
---
Yes, in many places it says it was built in 1778, while my presumption is that there was a hotel there, not as big as the resort now. I know for sure that the building that is the resort now was built in 1913.
---
Nah, gave everything a try again.  Restarted the PC, internet, launcher, and game itself.  No change, but thanks for the suggestion!
---
I have a ghoul head in a jar..just waiting for this to happen lol
---
Anybody know what the cost of using it is? There must be some kind of trade-off
---
That's a good idea about lighting up the conduits since they could really be anywhere in the event field.
---
I remember how excited everybody in West Virginia was when the game was announced to be set here cus we dont really get a lot of attention in movies or games so it was a big deal such a big deal that the West Virginia tourism twitter account was making posts about the game
---
West Virginia isn't the best place on earth but I love it here.  I haven't played much of the game but I'm grateful the fanbase has shown so much love and interest in the area.   If anyone has any questions or wants to know more about the real history/conditions of the state feel to ask them.
---
You could map a black powder weapon to every slot in the wheel. Shoot, swap, keep going until everything is dead.
---
I think this is coming. There have been mentions through datamines that static items will be able to be place in your camps and that weapon racks, magazine shelves, and bobblehead racks were coming. I believe this is why Bethesda mentioned in the last inside the vault article that items in your stash would now have icons by their names indicating what they were assigned to.
---
Yeah my real AR15 weighs 8 lbs.  That's loaded with 28 rounds, red dot, large Fenix flashlight and vertical grip pod.......mine in the game weighs 21 lbs with the same shit......
---
My real 870 with extended tube (+2 rounds), loaded, weighs 12 lbs less that the pump action legendary I have in the game.
---
This explains a lot!  Thanks so much for this.
---
For power armor, the lore makes it make sense. 
---
T-51b was military grade and used in war zones. The T-60 was developed for domestic use and based off the T-45 technology. So it probably wasn't as ruggedized or armored as the T51b.
---
The X01 was created just before the bombs dropped and probably not fully tested, which is why it's an X model.
---
21 lbs is 9.53 kg
---
Just looked today and there was 3 chickens here
---
I didn’t ask for repair kits specifically but a lot of people complained about upkeep and this helps out with that . It doesn’t make anyone superior to anyone else
---
I've just renamed mine to;
---
PA-T45
---
PA-T50b
---
PA-T60
---
PA-Ultra
---
PA-Excav
---
PA-X01
---
Which has made it much easier to get a set out and repair it to 200%
---
As a proud West Virginian DO NOT feel sorry for us, we don’t want your pity! We have our faults and differences, but will help a stranger as quick as we help each other. The drug epidemic has us by the jugular now but know this, we may falter but we will never fail! We will survive and flourish one day soon. We have by far the best people in this great land. "Montani Semper Liberi"!
---
Or change the factory into a workshop!!
---
People dont do them often anymore
---
honestly how i even managed to get 50 missiles and not realize it is beyond me
---
how much then?
---
I spent money in WV solely based on wanting to visit spots from the game. Hillbilly hotdogs and a few museums and gas. It worked.
---
could you message me then
---
A lot of weapons have weight reduction perk cards, but not rifles. Snipers have it hard there. I've got a tool kit of 4 rifles I keep with me for any particular job I'm on, and that's most of my carrying capacity right there.
---
It does feel a bit stagnant at the moment. Faction wars have been mentioned as in development, so that’s something to keep in mind.
---
I have input a lot of existing lore into the sub as a service, for information, entertainment, and guidance on both post formatting and potential directions for people posting their own original ideas and content.
---
Im on now, feel free to come pick it up.  I've put the best available mods I had on it, looking for pistol &amp; handmade probably for my back up weapons.. bloodied of course
---
Gt fookmiidum
---
I hope you don't think I was ragging on your state. Honestly was just looking to stir up a little conversation. I still think the level of decay is WAY out of wack regardless. 25 after the war shouldn't look as bad as almost 200 years after. Especially if you ever watched Life after people.
---
I don't want to be critical because I agree the disconnects need to be fixed but if you're using so many resources, outside of what's provided by the Workshop, that it's eating a ton into your personal stash, you need to rethink what you're doing with Workshops.
---
Can't say much different for Upstate NY. If it isn't heroin, its fenytal.
---
New events drawing everyone,  same thing during the parade event.
---
I have been to southern WV several times riding ATV/dirt bikes and it is some of the most beautiful country to explore. The people are truly amazing and if you open up to them and are real they treat you like family. Unfortunately the economy is nonexistent, there is literally NOTHING for miles and the little towns you do stop in will have one convince store that’s also a bar that’s also a little casino and a gas station and local hangout. My dad was a coal Miner but there were always other options where I live in Western Pennsylvania. The poverty down in some of the Hollows are debilitating, almost heart breaking.
---
Works about 25% of the time for me on PS4.  Sometimes it’s an atom bomb explosion.  Other times it is just a bunch of black and pink polygons.
---
I still haven't launched a single nuke... I have four cards now, maybe I'll start cuz I'm getting bored
---
I didn't want it to be too harsh but it didn't make sense. Why do the houses look they've been sitting 200 years. Because unlike Vegas/DC most of these houses were already worn down by 1950, let alone 2077 when the bombs fell. It took me traveling through the area for it to click.
---
I only had that issue in my CAMP. Using the Workstations at Whitesprings was fine.
---
I also haven't checked since I deleted my strings folder and reinstalled the inventory mod, so that might be it too.
---
I might try this out. Thanks!
---
Great idea! I'm only level 20 and everything in the beginning forest region does NOT provide a challenge. 
---
Hopefully the new game mode "Nuclear Winter" will be something like your imagining.
---
Spam make and scrap rippers. With the scrapper perk you get a fair amount per
---
What platform are you on?
---
Means someone beat you to them
---
It didn't feel fair? What the actual fuck lol... do you seriously want a game to be so easy you can power through the final event without good gear, weapons or even remotely optimized perk cards? I'm assuming it worked for you on other fallout games because you could switch your difficulty level on a whim. I try not to be a dick but this stands out as a particularly absurd and self involved bout of whinging. That said, if you want to reinstall I'd be happy to sweep the bunker for you if you are on PS4. If not i wish you well and hope your future online games provide little to no challenge in the pursuit of fairness.
---
My father worked at a USX mine in Green county PA That is on fire to this day from decades ago, it’s in a town called Kirby. Last exit before WV on 79.
---
If someone else picked up the plan before you on the server you are on you may not see it. Keep changing servers at the dome and check for the plan. If you have the key to get into the dome there's no need to do the earlier stuff over again, it will work on any server.
---
I have a question Mothman Cultist, if I spray “Off!” Insect Repellent on the mothman does he go away? Asking for a friend
---
Gonna take a lot of farming to get "the essence of seventeen different fruits"... if those fruits even exist anymore.
---
Just keep trying.  You will eventually find it unlooted.
---
I would pay $60 for this but most to all will disagree
---
Xbox One
---
Once you have the key to the TNT dome, just keep server hopping. You'll get it eventually.
---
I just kept leaving the game, reloading, running back to the tnt dome, and if it wasnt there i'd do it again. Took me like 5 tries, but it worked.
---
Go play survival. I have no interest in PvP whatsoever and want nothing to do with it.
---
I paid for it twice and I think it was worth it
---
It's in Centralia, PA.  Not WV.
---
Yes. He is immune to it, but he understands that some unbelievers cannot tolerate his amazing presence. So he’ll leave
---
Then he kills them later and steals their lamps.
---
Mutfruit, blackberries, melons, tomatoes should be enough flavors
---
 You make a good point.
---
Anything is a dildo if you try hard and believe in yourself
---
Boiled water is hot, purified water doesnt have to be hot, i guess there an idea
---
It's currently discounted on gamestop 10 to 20 dollars off
---
Or put up with the 2 seconds and extra button push lile the rest of us who dont care for survival mode.
---
Ive actually noticed an increase just recently. Well from my experience
---
Just hop servers a few times. It’ll be there for you once daily as long as someone else on that server hasn’t grabbed it. I get them daily and only have to hop servers like 3 times at most, but usually just once
---
In fairness, neither are the binoculars.
---
The servers would drop you ten times a session......
---
I defiantly think the rain catcher would be dope
---
I'm down, I really only play in adventure mode though.
---
The great collapse of coal crippled the economy.
---
Me too! Level 95 and I still haven't launched a nuke.
---
My biggest fear is that (even though Todd Howard said the game is a success, with millions playing) the servers will become less and less populated until they are ghost towns of 3 or 4 players.
---
It doesnt matter if you can get atoms without paying. The point is that you *can* pay to win, or at least you could in that instance.
---
I don’t play that much these days, and I certainly don’t do real work jumping through hoops to earn fake currency to buy fake items. So... I didn’t have enough atoms for any of those costumes. Could have spent money on them though, like other people did. And that’s super lame. 
---
So, to answer your question: 
---
&gt; Were we doing pay2win?
---
Yes, indirectly. You supported that business model by buying those costumes for the bonus, even though you earned the atoms in game. And not only that, but you supported the game itself by playing it and populating the world, which makes microtransactions more desirable for other players. Because, after all, nobody is going to buy atoms for a dead game.
---
The only reason something like the atom shop is acceptable is because you can earn atoms in game. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not pay2win when they allow you to pay money for power. If you can literally pay money to make yourself more powerful, that’s pay2win.
---
You could argue that the costume health bonus wasn’t significant enough to matter, and you’d be mostly right. But it’s still pay2win bullshit that hurts the game’s integrity.
---
Same here no spawn
---
I hope this happens, killed the SBQ just two times.

I have a handmade rifle that weighs 21.2 in game with a 35 round magazine.  I have a Czech-made AK in real life, chambered in the heavier 7.62mm with wood furniture that weighs about 10-12lb fully loaded with a 30 round mag.  Unless my in-game suppressor and reflex sight weigh an additional 10lb, I don't know how an AK could weigh over 20lb without a drum mag.  I have to assume BGS weight is measured in pounds because it's set in the United States, 21lb would be about 10kg, and there's no other real-world weight system that would convert a 10lb rifle into 21.2.  My uncle has a Winchester 94, which looks to be what the lever gun is modeled after, and it's *maybe* 10lb fully loaded with a 4x scope.  Also, a standardized, average sledgehammer that can be found in any hardware store in America is 8lb, not 12 as it is in-game.  It might be 9lb including a hickory handle, I guess.
---
Still, back when I had one (accidentally scrapped it) I was able to place it on my roof and I'd always load in on the roof (not falling or in the floor or anything). So that doesn't break it (plus same issue would happen with workshops, you could build a tower with a mat the top in one).

And if everyone hated it as much as I hear that, there would have to be some used ones.
---
I think i payed 69 or 79? Whatever tri centennial was at launch. Have definitely got my money's worth. It was 39 for a good while, just checked the store and it's back to $59.99. Target has it for 39.99, if you are on pc it's like 15.
---
Really mats wise it wouldnt need much. Plastic for the catcher and container, wood for supports thats it really.
---
I've knocked around my share of bitches, so maybe straight up Chris Brown.
---
Ah so while the game is rated M, your hands are rated E for everyone
---
i agree.
---
That was definitely my first experience but it is so much fun with the madness of it.
---
Played 8 times now, 1 failure as sheepsquatch just disappeared early, 1 blue screen during event (ps4)
---
The others all successful.
---
I'm claiming pylons&amp; running around like a lunatic so I don't  price people.just standing around.
---
Been revived or left to die several times, try my hardest to get to people to revive them.
---
When I started the event myself (after I had done 2 or 3) holy crap trying to keep away from the invisible sheepsquatch until the pylons are activated is intense.
---
I was on a server earlier today that had a nuke drop at White Springs and at Fissure Site Prime.
---
I would use it with my revolutionary sword.
---
You also have to remember environment plays a role. I live in Vegas and I work for a data center. Part of the reason the data center was built here was because Las Vegas is in a prime "disaster-free" zone. If humanity suddenly disappeared, it would take hundreds of years for the buildings to really fall apart (assuming no global disaster, obviously, but since nuclear plants wold melt down as soon as humans vanished... well that's getting meta).
---
I think the wildlife/animals of Appalachia are playing a serious part in it. The virus caused by the scorched outbreak seems to wreak havoc on EVERYTHING.
---
Didn't happen back before I accidentally scrapped mine. Even tested it on the roof of my house and it loaded properly.
---
Heck, here's a clip I took back when I had one in my house (not on roof, but I didn't spawn in foundation).
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/fallouthirteen/video/64826917
---
Yup. This mode needs an overhaul.
---
I don’t have any of the beginner achievements since I did them during beta, but I also am only level 17 or something
---
Yes. Been saying this to myself since the game launched. I dont get it - sorry bud, the recipe calls specifically for radiated water. Wat.
---
They are all lazy and don’t want to farm more stimpaks, my opinion
---
I'll buy it
---
Gauss does ballistic damage and AA works for it. The ammo is considered energy but not the gun/damage.
---
Wow, somehow I only realized that you don't need a hatchet for wood, but never a pickaxe or excavator armor for ore. IDK why I thought that, but my C.A.M.P. sits on a junk pile, so I never need ore anyways.
---
Well then they can only blame themselves when the event fails lol
---
My camp hardly ever gets attacked.
---
And my camp must be in an awkward location because strange men are always sneaking in my back door. Super mutants, robots, you name it.
---
I seem to find cores around the Ash Heap area. Lots of industrial ruins to rummage through. Usually can pull at least a couple in about 15 minutes at varying charge percentages. On a good run 5 is possible. 
---
This is if you do not want to take over a power plant like everyonevelse is suggesting.
---
The little bit I have played I thought the rate of decay was pretty much on par.  Some of the public buildings like schools, and government buildings yea maybe it's a bit over the top.  But I've been in houses, barns, and shacks IRL that have been worse than anything I've seen in 76.
---
Oh so you’ve met fisto?
---
do you think it would just be more legendaries? Cuz survival challenges reward those (don't know if there any good)
---
What about rewarding unique cosmetic items?
---
I'm not saying this is the end of the world, but this is on par with the messaging saying that your camp cannot be placed, and would you like to change worlds. You could manually drop out and find another server, but this makes it easier.
---
I am far from the only one in my friends group to go "Damn, I joined a random server! Be in in a few." And this is far from a huge ask.  I doubt Bethesda will actually read this, but I don't see the harm in asking...
---
Maybe its to help the cooking, like the food microwaves itself?
---
The tokens sell around 25 caps per piece. 50 tokens would be 1250 caps. I offer 1400 caps.
---
lol yes they are already working on this and has been talked about on inside the vault
---
Yeah , I have had the white world fedora, the imposter sheep mascot head and body, the imposter sheep helmet and suit, and the fixer plans. Nothing else has dropped for me either. I am annoyed, I want to know how to get the rest of those trophy heads! I couldn't care less about the other items. On that note, I also wish they'd keep the sheep squatch as a permanent boss because it's far better than the Queen.
---
Not gonna lie, I'd pay money for a atom cats flame paint for my power armor.
---
In a heart beat. Me too.
---
I've held all 3 from start to finish and used about 5 or 6 stims, it just needs the first aid perk and no problem. You'll use more fighting the sheep.
---
We've been over this, purified water has chlorine in it, it's safe but it tastes like crap.  
---
Sod making soup with something I could use to clean the toilet.
---
Same story here. Was impossible to get as soon as it became common knowledge. But during the Faschnat event it was surprisingly easy to get. Still slide past every time I'm over the west side of the map. 50% strike rate, but at least I get some quantum while I'm there
---
Time to move shop. Usually begins with Mole Rats or Rad Scorpions. Then a couple of robots. Then one day, 3 scorchbeasts are circling above your camp. 
---
At least that's how it happens for me.
---
Except, when I had a camp at top if Seneca Rocks, never had a problem there, except for other players, likely pissed their camp wouldn't spawn.
---
Yeah, I was looking in C:\Program Files (x86)\Bethesda.net Launcher\games\Fallout76... why are the Fallout76.ini file and Fallout76custom.ini file in 2 places?
---
I will trade you boiled water for purified water.
---
Is there really an overseer?
---
Out of .45 now, sorry.  Come get the rest!
---
The RNG Gawds blessed me with a 2 shot cryolator.
---
Thanks but I think I will just gather it when I next play. Besides I am offloading moat of it to a guy just starting.
---
I did 2 and jumped up on the shack and that worked, but when I finnaly dropped nobody would come get me :(
---
You will see more chainsaws if everyone on your server has one.... else they are even more rare..... Its just one of those things.
---
So what do the stars mean I've been looking everywhere for an answer and cant find shit
---
How about a hello kitty paint scheme?
---
Came to say I have the same issue. Customer support won’t help because I’m technically under minimum system requirements with my processor. They said the fix could damage my system. Anyone have the fix they give you if you meet minimum requirements or is it as I suspect just a canned answer because they have no idea what’s wrong and have no plans on fixing daily’s.
---
Wouldn't be true Nuka Cola if you could craft it. I say make the Nuka plant a workshop. Restart the machinery to produce Nuka Cola.
---
I’m from Northeastern Pennsylvania and we have the same problems. Former coal and manufacturing area largely gutted and decaying. I feel a real kinship with the setting in WV, it’s eerily similar.
---
Key here is "should"...there have been a few "should be easy" in the past were Bethesda managed to mess up sadly
---
AWESOME
---
The working class of WV have been fucked over for a very, very long time.  Likely one of the top states for poverty and massive disparity between income levels.
---
U start already
---
Boiled water doesnt mean it's hot, just means it was once hot.
---
Uh, then the repair kits are worthless. Gotta break shit to sell new shit.
---
I just want to craft Nuka Grape and Quantum.
---
I’m just asking, the mothman seems like a cool guy to be around with, just last week we went out for a Brahmin Steak, nice guy, we split the bill 50/50
---
Same problem
---
This one really pisses me off because I cant do the weekly challenges. This is game breaking 100%
---
100% - people keep spawning inside the foundations of my camp.
---
No, it would not. 
---
If you bought the Fallout 76 game through the Bethesda portal, it’s associated with a known Email/userid.
---
Is this your first time playing?
---
It's almost like the Fallout Lore is a critique of our society or something.
---
Oh wow
---
Totally agreed! Robots generally have less energy resist than ballistic, so technically they perform better vs a ballistic grenade, but I agree, hope they get their special robot-killing status back.
---
Buy a weapon worth 20k..then continue to earn more caps..serious post
---
Actually, yeah, I should remember their pedigree/history. Made a fool out of me, especially as I have played Daggerfall and later.
---
Ditto. If we can't have a mat, at least check to see they're not spawning into something.
---
I use a macro of R on my mouse to collect water when I need to. Easily collects 200 dirty water in 30 seconds or less. The real problem is wood.
---
Fist... “oh!”
---
Have you ever seen wv?
---
I got bored of xo1 and switched to t51b, now im going t60 because i found calibrated shocks. Cant wait for tuesday to put them on
---
You might be a master builder!
---
Who knows? Maybe they left in it for a little bit of immersion, or maybe it's just a leftover from Fo4 they forgot to remove.
---
BTW, one dog helmet spawns at the freak show on a dead dog inside a cage if you want one for your collection.
---
There are literally thousands of long burning coal and gas fires worldwide.  It is believed that  Burning Mountain in Australia has been going for around 6000 years.  There was also a natural nuclear reactor in Africa.  Talk about nature being lit!
---
Or have a third button option for a stable, consistent game experience.
---
I had about 200lbs of ammo in my stash.
---
With the right perk cards, carrying it around means it weighs almost nothing.
---
The LMG uses .308 ammo..
---
LMAO..I just said today that the event is a convoluted-mess
---
That's because it isn't 5 bottles per hour per purifier. It's just 5 per hour in general. Having more purifiers just makes it so you can hold more at once before they stop producing.
---
Pmed you.
---
The freezing is getting stupid lately. Try logging off windows then back on. Just hit windows key then log off. Log back on and windows reloads everything like you restarted without the wait.
---
Haven’t used much mini nukes but I’m always ditching the missiles.
---
Yet boiled water is 'hot' in a radioactive sense.
---
Can you explain the bone hammer then?
---
So it's no coincidence that the game is excessively depressing?  I mean even the pre-war holotapes are often a huge downer.
---
I tried ctrl alt delete but still stayed frozen , but I'll try that if it happens again . Thanks .
---
because most fallout players are alcoholics i’ve learned
---
Cool thought. I like it.
---
Lol sadly this Beta of a game requires one to explain the details of all the problems it has
---
It should actually be fliped seeing as how bmg stands for Browning Machine Gun, and was made specifically to be used in the Browning M3 which is the real world gun the in game mg is based on.
---
a dirty unwashed peice of metal has the same chance to give you a disease as anything else now imagine that peice of metal came up and attacked you covered in bloody rust. a robot wont die from a disease so they are a perfect carrier.
---
get herbivore and skip it all by just planting melons - 10 food (20 with herb) and 15 water 0 work
---
You've built on a spawn point. You should move.
---
now your playing with fire there champ
---
I was mostly joking. However, I do a ton of chem crafting so I never have enough purified water. Diluting stimpaks/radaway with the chemist perk makes 4 from 1, definitely worth looking into.
---
YES! Finally, one of the essential components of the game's back online! QOL +50%
---
I want a rain catcher for locations with out access to soil as well as it would give more options for camp locations
---
I wish you nothing but the best! I'm in upstate NY near the Canadian border as well. We also live in a land of heroin and Fentanyl. 
---
The people I dealt with in the state were lovely.
---
Yeah whatever makes the most sense, I just think the concept of a different .50 round for individual balancing would solve the problem with the .50 hunting rifle being weaker than hardened .308
---
PS4
---
I managed to get all location discovery ones except Grafton damn.
---
On 5 characters.  I sure hope it can eventually click.  40 atoms is 40 atoms!
---
Will do thanks.
---
you're not wrong. what is the point of the game? and the latest DLC took 1 hour to complete and was nothing more than a fast travel to read notes at each location. YAWN. it all feels like an incomplete mod for Fallout 4. Worst $60 ever spent. BUT fanboys gonna fanboy.
---
Whats the sole survivor? Isnt that the main character from fallout 4?
---
It still spawns me to the same location for me, doesn't matter where i put it.
---
I used to think the jingoism and whole war with China was far fetched, but these days the idea of a rabid government forcing us back to thw 1950s but retaining high tech like computers doesnt seem like such a leap.
---
&gt;and takes my workshop... why!?
---
Cause they wanted that free acid.  And some player kills for the trophy.
---
How do I get to start this quest??
---
Brain no work good.
---
If the game is so good why do you have to BEG for Wiki psots?
---
Btw- pole hooks are fantastic melee weapons since they’re so cheap to repair
---
That would possibly be the most pirate thing ever, the downside is legendaries.
---
More or less spot on, except that I have yet to actually succeed with finishing the event before the timer’s out...
---
Ya they got a ton! I dropped all the acid I had stored obviously, and said douche picked up my dropped loot... unbalanced PVP blows
---
Honestly shotguns is a good way to go. Explosive weaponary is hard to craft and carry, making ordnance express a necessity. Shotguns have some great perks as well, like Enforced, Scattershot, etc.
---
Play Silent Hill 1-3.
---
Weird cause the spawn point is directly related to where the camp module is. You may need to relog after you move it.
---
Friends or teammates that fast travel to your base will always spawn where the camp module was originally placed. But you should have the ability.
---
I'm sorry, my character cannot help himself &amp; licks every robot he finds to see if it is edible .....
---
Damn
---
Or your game freezes and you lose the the stuff but literally all I’ve gotten is white fedoras
---
Mis-post. Sorry.
---
Nah, they’re not any more difficult- I think people are just getting sick of fighting the Scorchbeast Queen and are largely too distracted to nuke Whitesprings.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6785a8c&amp;d=a71ar2ao0c71a41l40l32l92l21li0l71i44ic4c50cr0ei0eu0ek1em0eq0e00e60pp2ps0pf0sv1sc0ss1sf0&amp;w=&amp;n=Mistress%20of%20Mystery%20(VB)&amp;m=4c
---
Streaky. I hopped easily enough today; however, I did have a period where I landed in the same world 4 or 5 times this morning.
---
They probably high af just zoned out wailing on it lol.
---
Worse bit is that it's not just the lower level players, the level 100+ players are also doing it.
---
It's almost like these recently written games about our time are similar to our time. That's the whole thing dude.
---
Your girlfriend or your mom?
---
Don't be a little bitch dude, it's Fallout. Lil bitches don't play fallout.
---
Same problem here paints work fine but not pa mods thought it was just me
---
Ah good point! What kind of effective range does a well-perked well-modded shotgun have? Also if I equip the cripple perk (forgot its name) for the shotgun, will that still cripple enemies even if the shotgun only barely hits them at max range?
---
Pmed you
---
anyone tired of getting the fedora as a reward every time you do the event??? for fck sake i don't need 25 of these stupid things, i want a chance at the other rewards dammit!
---
I’m not sure it matters. It’s all about freezing it so everybody can do damage and it becomes harmless.
---
I sniped the robots from on top of the cabin wing a gauss rifle. Being low level, that was about all I could do. I hope it helped.
---
Missile turrets work wonders for that.  I've built my camp hanging off a ledge so it can only be attacked from one side, and that side has 8 missile turrets that kill any super mutant, liberators.. not sure about a scorch beast though. Maybe if they were spread out more, because they do decent damage to them, they just break easily
---
It just works.
---
It's a hammer made of bone.
---
Huntington was cut from the game because if Bethesda strived for realism, they would have to cover every square inch of the ground with empty syringes and Med-X for that part of the map./'s
---
I kid and I really have no idea why it wasn't included, but the point stands that Huntington (and WV as a whole) have definitely seen better days. You can't even take your kids to a park without someone overdosing on prescription painkillers while driving.
---
Never
---
&gt; Unyielding armor
---
Does it multiply for every piece that has that?
---
Especially when they're shining straight through the mountain.
---
Feh, that's definitely just service rep bullshit cause that would mean consoles don't meet minimum requirements, seeing as how I'm having the issue on PS4. Also there's no reason I can see that the mechanical components of your system would affect whether or not the game registers it's been 20 hours on the company server for you to do the quest again.
---
You're assuming that their internal closed testing with maybe a hundred or less users will yield the same results as their live open servers with many thousands of players.
---
I dont know the exact range of shotguns. Double barrels have got the worse accuarcy/range in my experience. Ive usually used combat shotguns instead and theyve worked well for medium range. Also each pellet has a chance to cripple/stagger from what I heard, so yes even if you barely clip them you’ll have a chance for it.
---
If the Burrows have any similar mechanics I can see people crying already..... just like a bunch of them did when the imposter fight came out.....
---
\-It's broken and bugged!!!
---
\-No.... you're simply to dumb to execute simple mechanics.....
---
No I don't think anyone has it, there's no videos on it, there any videos on the bone mace
---
Ok. If it's Ricky Ricardo's ass, I'll stare all day. I mean, I ain't gay or anything, but come on. It's Ricky Ricardo 😂😂
---
Mine either.  In the woods, near the Light House, I can sit on my balcony listen to the birds and watch the sunrise. Aside from the occasional low level scorched or radtoad it’s pretty peaceful.
---
Sadly even with that I still cant justify taking PA off.
---
Still going ?
---
It's a heavy weapon if you still needed to know.
---
Then dont? Your at the point in most MMOs when money isnt an problem, and you spend most your time grinding for legendary weapons and raiding.   Too bad raids are meh tho.
---
ive lost  close to 10k like this plus maybe another 15k trying to get any of the other rewards besides the dammed fedora. so far 20+ fedoras...
---
Yup.... just did the event and there was a level 300+ on the roof shooting at the imposter with the pillars inactive.... in the whole group of about 10 there were 2 players that knew what to do...… which means there were 2 people that can follow simple instructions..... this is very sad
---
Here's my recent experience.
---
Oops I just died. Gonna run back to get my bag. Oh nevermind some POS is hanging out on the sidelines dipping in to loot people's death bags.
---
They are on a 20 hour timer BUT you also have to spend "X" amount of hours in game as well. So they will not refresh until you have spent the required amount of hours playing the game. Not sure the required hours needed in game though.
---
I got me a good thing going. The way it is [Setup](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f136bb9&amp;d=sb2sg2pe0ei0i12e60em0ck0ce0ev0a72a80s72a42a00l20l71lt2lu2c80&amp;w=i44s50si0sj0ss2se2ih2ip2ic4s40sm0sn0sd0sp0so0su2s01sa0s30sq0sr0sx2s22pc0&amp;n=Heavy%20Shot%20Melee%203/14&amp;m=) it takes full advantage of high strength allowing you to wield Melee, Shotguns, or Heavy guns to your heart's content.
---
You can't be harmed, no, but... Recently I got a team invite from a rando lowbie, and I decided to accept.  I mean, they can't really harm me, and I get a stat boost from herd mentality.  Anyway, he FT'ed to my camp and apparently ran in before it was completely loaded, promptly getting stuck in the foundation.  I didn't have a mic ready so I couldn't tell him just to FT again, and it took him awhile to realize he could use a crafting station to pull himself out.
---
Well if you did, you would have heard of a perpetual underground fire.
---
Yah that was not a good move hope they fix it
---
Have you considered mulling your caps? Bring some enjoyment back into the game?
---
If they had any idea what they were talking about they would've described their connection.  For all we know they're trying to play on their neighbor's wifi.
---
And Lucky Break
---
They definitely need to rework the loot pools and percentages for things cos I'm tired of getting the same 4 things from the same event 6 times in a row
---
You're so innocent.
---
They probably do that because they couldn't hope to do any sort of meaningful damage anyways. No sense in wasting 1000 5.56 ammo to do 1% of its health.
---
It’s the whole country
---
Why exactly did you launch a nuke?
---
I think about 100 more DR isn't worth about 300 less ER.
---
But assholes do?
---
Thats fair I just scare easily so I tend to not fuck with horror stuff
---
To get the Flouresent flux needed to craft the assaultron recal keycard
---
thank you, Danny Tanner
---
Sorry to hear this.
---
Are you sure it was players and not critters?
---
Or, 
---
I made the decision early on not to invest time nor materials in camps.  Mine only consist of tinker, weapon, armor, chem benches.  A cook fire, stash, pump well, and bed.  All on the ground without foundation.  Easily moved, easily hidden, easily replaced.
---
Ohhhh...I see now! It is my job to provide the RPG elements and provide a richer context to the FO76 world. Here I thought that was supposed to be included for the dull retail price of a AAA game.
---
Geez is there really a cap limit? What would be the point of that? Also only 25,000caps??? It is quite easy to reach at least a thousand caps or more in a short amount of time if you play regularly...
---
If there is gonna be a limit at least make it to where it would take a very VERY long time to reach it. You can also be able to catch hackers easily if they reach this limit rather quickly.
---
So they’re excuse is to just stand there and do nothing to help? They could take out the enemies at least but no all they do is stand by in the house or chameleon doing nothing so they’ll get something.
---
Do u play pvp?
---
This is very helpful. Thank you
---
SO true to life.
---
Totally agree I’ve been at this for a while and too lazy to make a mule for more pointless caps
---
So now we can wait for PLM update! great news!
---
Time to move? I have never had assholes come over, but they visit
---
exactly.
---
As an added bonus, most people don't really know how to use mirvs, and just blow trying up with them anyway. Converting it to a normal Fatman makes it much simpler (safer) to use.
---
Press E or space while hovering over the event icon. That works for me when the mouse wont work.
---
Still the same
---
Uh.  He wanted the workshop for the same reasons as you. Nothing wrong with that. If you had no way to get a claimed workshop, that would suck.
---
yepppppp.
---
When the challenge of consumin 50 alchols came up,i comsumed my newly crafted fermentable beer without realizing they give massive rads. Died drunk and irradiated in front of my puzzled deathclaw.
---
Another time i died in a bear trap. They do like 1 damage but i wasn't paying attention at all.
---
I've never received a drill. ( not disappointed ).
---
Idk. I’m on PS4, but you can just go to a stream and collect 50+ dirty water in a minute.
---
Running around the stream button mashing collect picks it up fast. I think it might register as a new collection spot every few feet or something
---
Sentinel's with melee?
---
Uh, okay... I guess Cavalier's isn't a thing anymore.
---
“Appalachia Nuka-Cola”
---
So is everyone just grinding for 15 levels? That's what I'm asking about.
---
You can buy the plans at watoga and Harpers. I suppose since this new patch you could get at WS and enclave.
---
Is Hillbilly Hotdogs worth a trip? If the map went southeast for about 90 minutes (in real life, probably more like 4 minutes in game) I could find where I live in game, and I’ve been considering a trip to see some of these things IRL.
---
I can change up between shotguns and rifles by keeping enough strength for one point each of the three shotgunner cards and enough perception for one point each of the three rifleman cards and then just switch cards between Tank Killer and Skeet Shooter.
---
Then I have Ironfists and Incisor in strength for unarmed melee weapons.
---
Then I have 15 in Agility and have 11 in Luck where I pick up defensive and VATS/Crits respectively.
---
I'd love about 5 or 6 more points to make it perfect but it works well enough
---
No such thing as a legendary chainsaw.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but MIRV breaks into bomblets at the top of the projectile's arc, right?  And then they pretty much rain down in a small radius from there instead of following the same arc?
---
Better indication of who is a conduit would really help.
---
I try to revive people as soon as I can just because they may be the conduit.
---
2 player teams sounds good but I can't just stand around - my melee character has to be in the thick of it, gets the blood pumping!
---
Yeah - myself and some other dude had 2x pylons and no one would get the last one.
---
It's in valkenvania, starring chevy chase and demi moore.
---
I care that you know I don’t care, because if you did think I care then you might actually think your time was spent well.
---
I enjoy doing the treasure maps because I like the challenge of using environmental clues to find some loot. In other words, if you don’t want your treasure maps, I’ll buy ‘em!
---
Sent ya a message, FunkeTony. I've got 3200 rounds for ya, I just want whatever shotgun ammo ya got in your pocket. Or whatever plastic you want to part with.
---
It was people, 2 people I did an enclave event with joined my team, and then fast traveled to my camp and left, then they were both wanted with 100 cap bounties because they burned it to the ground
---
Yeah I am not happy with the repair screens now. Plus there’s a bug where your weapon stats disappear. So maddening.
---
Well they need to slowly build up the good stuff over time otherwise they will run out of top ideas to maximize profits as you buy the next best thing haha
---
Um no this is stupid. Pvp  does not need to leave adventure. Since survival I have had pvp  fun
---
YES and it is uber annoying.
---
There was a water collected. Seemed like a windmill with a tire the dirty water collects in the tire... At that farm we went to on the quest with the albino ragstags.  They shud definitely put that in game.
---
Will try to get a pic later for reference
---
I move every time I get greifed, I either have to move on top of a mountain that’s impossible to fast travel to or I have to move somewhere that is easily targeted by greifers
---
Nah she died
---
&gt; Is Hillbilly Hotdogs worth a trip?
---
If you like hot dogs, yes!  It's much more of a spectacle in real life than it is in the game.
---
hahaha I can actually imagine that
---
Or you could switch lobbies or go to survival... or come grab acid out of my extractors cuz I’d be happy to share... much better than being a dick and taking everything I have... I don’t PVP... it’s worthless in this game. Zero balance. If you attack a lower level you’re just a douche... plain and simple
---
Kill a Super Mutant?

Appreciate it. Never changed my difficulty before on another Fallout game. I think the main point I was trying to make here is I can get through most of the game on 35 but would just have to grind for 15 levels to finish my current quest? If there were several side missions I hadn't seen before pop up along the way, that would have been one thing. Fallout progression to me has always been about exploring, seeing/finding new things, and working through quests. It didn't feel fair that I would have to grind like that. Obviously we enjoyed the game for different reasons!
---
I guess you're right lol
---
This roughly matches with my testing, and it isn’t anecdotal. I was testing a furious pipe rifle against a second account alt and tracking damage per shot. Although my average was a bit higher - I started at 11/shot and went up to 18/shot by shot 10-11, but that was against a lightly armored target, the higher base damage might have been acting as a bit of an armor piercing effect and so the “true” damage increase is about 50%, but the effective is more like 60-70% due to the way the damage formulas works (to be clear, this is true of all damage increasing effects, and why they’re secretly a little bit better than you’d expect, compared to anti-armor)
---
It’s hard to tell because it doesn’t show up as a visible bonus anywhere, you have to see the actual damage taken, which is basically impossible without having another player involved. But I did just that!
---
I’m thinking shishkabob for melee flavor.
---
Dafuq?
---
You don't have OCD for that. Saying so is an insult to those who *actually suffer* from OCD. Don't be ignorant.
---
This is unfortunate, I haven't been in an event where it is just me on the pylons, I have had instances of where I have held 2 but it was either after someone died or after I died other people have taken the pylons.
---
It's hard to advertise you are going to start the event because we cannot guarantee when it can be initiated.
---
A timer on the pc would help a lot.
---
I love hot dogs. If I didn't care about staying alive I could eat nothing else!
---
I dont see why not
---
I bought a lot of plans from vendors lately due to this. Then I sold a rare melee weapon for 4K. I will say it makes me care less about picking up items. I need the legendary vendor to show up soon so I can vendor weird 3* stuff I'm hoarding.
---
I got another one from killing the imposter Sheepsquatch so I’m selling it
---
Tell me about it.
---
This is one of the truly ANNOYING parts of this game is the constant need to defend a place.
---
I still get blasted with the face laser even in melee range.  That is, until I punch them in the face with Enforcer.  Face, leg, leg, walk away, at least in silos.  LOL
---
If u save up ur caps u can buy the stimpack recipe from whitespring bunker. It cost abit but definitely worth the investment
---
A. 55 hours in a world with no NPC's?
---
B. Advanced relative to lv 35
---
C. Heartbreaking, but I guess pretty clear in these replies
---
Trying to stay alive sometimes pays off in the future.  Hot dogs always pay off immediately.  You know what you have to do.
---
Bethesda should extend pacifist mode to camp items. Meaning, unless you're in pvp, your camp should be bulletproof. Been having my camp destroyed by griefers lately and its mildly annoying.
---
I only got the wolf and ragstag what gave the other two?
---
Yo our dollar general population is booming tho
---
Sure, but I’m the one providing the RPG elements in your example, not the game.
---
It’s way more than double. It’s like 6x damage when it’s at 200%.
---
Full low-health build with an overrepaired curved-blade Bloody ripper... it’s like 150 damage.
---
No, but if you do, don't forget that they'll need an update almost every time the game itself gets a big update. 
---
I wish I had a nuka cap for everyone of those "I'm falling through the world!" posts.
---
I do hope that by “almighty father” you mean our lord and savior Mothman!
---
Yea, and the best plans don’t survive the first contact with the enemy so it’s never worked for me either, but man, it sounds good.
---
I guess I've been really fortunate.  I don't know how many times I've completed it at this point, but I'd say 95% of my starred loot from the boss has been 3 star of varying quality.  (best was a troubleshooter's/rad resist/sentinel leather leg \[*hell yeah I'm using it now with an ultra-light mod for the event and silos*\] or a furious/+50limb/+1str buzz blade that hobbles crickets and scorpions like nothing else for some reason.)
---
I do feel for players on a bad luck streak.  My good pal Kat hasn't gotten anything over one star so far, and she's done the event about as much as I have.  I feel like I got my due during a whitespring nuke today that yielded only one legendary enemy that was 3-star, and less than a handful of single stars.  Usually I see maybe 3-4x as much during a blast with someone in the team respawning the mobs.
---
Of course I got a nocturnal wooden leg once or twice, but the overwhelming majority of my drops have been ultra-light modded and stashed for the legendary vendor.  It's all just random luck.  My luck has been on a hot streak, so feel confident that the boss will eventually start giving you decent shit.
---
I usually do server hopping with 2-3 buddies on a discord channel until we find a terminal that will accept a keycard, and repeat until we run out of cards or get bored of the event.  I've crashed several times during, but I can just rejoin the server because I'm in party and my pals hold off on DPS until I can see the enemies again.  9 times out of 10, we're the ones that are doing chunky damage aside from maybe one other player.  Between 2-3 of my pals, we each take a pylon so if one person disconnects we just let the pylon damage kill us and jump on top of the cabin until our friend comes back.  Most of the time, everyone else runs around like headless chickens ignoring what the upper right corner of the screen is suggesting they do and getting back into the server isn't much of a problem.  We just take the pylons back and finish.  If nobody crashes, it takes maybe 2-3 minutes to complete.
---
I've never failed the event if I can maintain connection.  I have crashed twice and had other high levels with the ability to follow simple instructions take over the pylons and kill the boss before I could load back in.  If the disconnects and crashes are stabilized, it's a pretty easy chance for a max level 3-star.
---
One benefit to extending the event artificially (ie: you can do it in a few minutes but opt to draw it out) is that obviously more players are able to partake, and the sheer volume of robot trash almost guarantees an extra legendary or two.  As the sniper dude on the roof, I tend to focus on trash while stimming myself from pylon damage, and I have a good vantage.  If I see a starred Gutsy I'll run to it, hit it a couple times with my backup molerat knife that does pathetic damage, make a "come here" emote and usually at least 3-4 other players are able to get a hit on it before someone kills it outright.
---
So there's 50 BMG which was designed for the Browning machine gun and is used in heavy machine guns but also has long-range sniper applications. Same round, same devastating impact. The balancing should be that the rifle has higher accuracy and less rate of fire than the hmg, but similar damage as they use the same round.
---
That's just how the game works. You don't have to actually DO anything to get rewarded. That fact alone will encourage people who can't/won't do anything to show up. I'm not like that. I will break every weapon and use all my ammo to get any amount of DPS on a target. After that i will give em' the Mike Tyson business with my fists. Even if I only do 1% of it's health that's still 1% less that others have to do.
---
Not "yet"
---
There have been mentions in inside the Vaults, but no eta yet
---
That build is messed up and i wouldn’t waste that many perk points.
---
Mistress’s are meant to be heavy perception, stealth and agile not strength or luck.
---
Bummer dude.  Indeed crappy behavior.  
---
Um, at least you now have no restrictions on your new design?
---
Add in Ultracite too, as it clearly comes from the Brotherhood
---
Survival mode challenge lever action reward.
---
How about be a lad and make a creator with basic colors
---
I do quite enjoy My 600 lbs Life.
---
With a good shotgun build (9 perks to shotgun, bloody mess, scattershot, and enforcer - demo expert if it's explosive), you can force a SB to land by crippling it. Then laugh as you quickly chip away health. Adrenaline helps if he brings friends.
---
Browse market76 and buy a nice rolled item, go back to grinding, rinse and repeat.
---
Start a collection. I have a character solely designated to carry all my 3* AA, bloodied, instigating, explosives, etc weapons.
---
You can pickup a chainsaw in the outbuilding/garage at the Ranger Station N of watoga, but as someone already pointed out, currently there are no legendary chainsaws. However, there are mods for them.
---
I have to try this out.... if it’s true, all the upvotes to you sir
---
I never had anything spawn at my camp until this patch and now the enemies dont even spawn in right. I could deal with it if I had a regular group spawn but i get 1 mongrel then 2 min later get 2 super mutants. Then another super mutant shows up 1 min later... Then the next 2 times a spawn in nothing.
---
Yes thank you I needed this info!!
---
Enforcer is for crippling. Scattershot makes the pattern of pellets smaller.
---
Nice thanks
---
Don't be forgetting the famas that's so anime it was in metal gear solid :P 
---
Apparently, they also get really good MRE's and ration packs too which is nice for them.
---
I felt it was quite relieving once I hit the cap limit. Made my game more enjoyable without the little man in my head, telling me I have to do my vendor run before exploring.
---
I suppose from an in-game perspective, it wouldn't make sense to use purified water to cook. Your character is in a wasteland where purified water is a luxury to have, so you'd want to save as much of that as you can. Its to a point where there's a whole story arc revolving *around* water purification in other games.
---
On the other side, boiled water is abundant and can be made quite easily should you run out, so it would make more sense to use the abundant water for cooking purposes. Kind of in the same way that you wouldn't use the $60 bottle of shiraz in your cooking if you could use a $10 bottle instead.
---
is it not permanent?
---
It definitely is Bethesda's servers that are the major problem. I need to play with my VPN to see if there is a region where BSG servers are more stable or at least less used than the region I'm in (west coast).
---
I got the drill with no wood part. Felt really special indeed
---
My friend and I do this. One of us gets a bounty, shoot one another get caps.
---
Me too, was definitely worth it and especially now with all the new updates coming I don't see why not, but I could also see why some people don't want to pay $60
---
OMG YES. I had two huge hot dogs and fries. 
---
The first hot dog had chopped ham, pineapple, and BBQ sauce on it. Amazing.
---
The second one had Chili and Coleslaw on it. Very good but not as much as the first one only cause I love pineapple.
---
The fries were done perfectly crispy. None burnt, none soggy. Had a HUGE lunch for about 12.00. Can't go wrong.
---
Man I'm from WV originally and I'm working near Pikeville this summer and I feel for the people in both areas. They're not all that different and damn I wish things could be better.
---
Did you place a stash box?
---
That's when you start buying serum recipies and power armor mod plans lol
---
&gt;am I the only one
---
No, this literal suggestion has been made multiple times in just the past couple days.
---
yeah - I had a bad day yesterday. Played for hours. 
---
3x SBQ events and one Sheepshank ( or whatever ).
---
Every event the game froze mid stream. Came back a couple of times at the end. I got the loot from the SQB but practically did nothing during it cause I couldn't. With the Sheep event I could not find it's body afterwards though I got the other rewards etc. Crazy.
---
are you using that week's launch code?
---
I want to upvote but it's at 76... this post is too perfect
---
i guess its gonna be an Ice day outside
---
They bring it in. Does 45 damage (with the +60 from perks). Endless posts for Bethesda to fix the anti-material rifle.
---
Never thought of it that way.
---
Don't forget the funeral homes! Business is booming!
---
Your absolutely right. Negative news is more profitable no matter the platform. That's why all news sources focus on it.
---
I would pay 10,000 caps for a Nuka Grape maker...
---
Even valley galleria? That one has never unlocked on any of my characters.
---
Unintended consequence and no one tested it
---
THE FBI ARE ON THEIR WAY NOW YOU SICK FUCK
---
(if it doesnt give you an advantage its pobably fine to do)
---
How about loading the fucking game? 
---
PLAY
---
Roadmap - TAB to exit
---
Literally no skin-based market has EVER had to do this. People are fickle and like change. A wardrobe is something nearly all people appreciate. Even wardrobes of gun skins. You’re speaking in terms of, like, car sales or iphones. Skins don’t have that kind of competition.
---
I had lived in Southern West Virginia for 33 years ( minus 7 years in the military ). A lot of these small towns were coal mining towns, Fayetteville, Oak Hill, Beckley and Hinton. 
---
Fayetteville was adamant about not allowing a tudors biscuit world to get added in town saying it would destroy the small town feel and Oak Hill was crying because Wal-Mart and denied Lowe’s from building a store brought in to much traffic, until Fayetteville opened up a shopping center. 
---
Oak Hill and Fayetteville City Council don’t believe in progressing. Hell the Fayette County Commission launderers money from other entities underneath them then gives it back once they get the interest off of it. 
---
The only town progressing is Beckley but the violence is slowly ramping up.
---
If you drive to Hinton, it’s almost a ghost of it’s former self. 
---
I hope one day WVa will get better but it’s a poor state, and I feel as if it won’t never pull itself out.
---
It's one of those things you have to remind yourself on sometimes. Particularly if you happen to have a tonne of purified water due to med boxes and perks etc
---
And no Parkersburg, sadly.
---
I’m always confused when people say their camps get trashed multiple times.  I’ve been playing since beta and I have yet to have anyone wreck anything on purpose.  I’ve got a low level alt that I play occasionally and still no issues.  How this happens to someone multiple times I don’t understand... unless your at whitesprings
---
Yes when but I try to use my card, it beeps at me and won't let me do anything. I don't even get access to the keypad.
---
It’s got us all by the nuts right now. Ty for visiting my state!! If you’re ever back down this way and have a free day by all means shoot me a message. I’ll be more than happy to show you the highlights of the West and southern parts. After rereading my original comment I think I came off as a little crass, I apologize as that wasn’t my intent!
---
Dang!! I feel for you people only wanting your rad sponge lol. I still have so much to learn, thank you for the detailed infos!!
---
You buying the plans with your caps? Or you just accumulate the means and hoarding? I don't understand, do have everything already?
---
&gt;fast travel -&gt; see people shooting at the 3-star assaultron -&gt; sneak and start hitting it -&gt; huge text telling me to activate pylon -&gt; follow floating marker, activate pylon -&gt; repeat until dead
---
can not fathom how some people would find this kind of thing confusing, try playing wow in 2005 and looking for unmarked quest objectives all day with nothing but vague quest log descriptions as your guide, or playing runescape in the same year and doing basically any quest with no guides
---
Pirate build or no build.
---
Unfortunately not at that point. Since the release of survival I haven’t had 1 single issue with PVP at workshops in adventure... today I learned my lesson
---
I know right! Huntington is one of the few areas I've never been in personally but all around so I wanted to see how it was represented in game since it is the second most discussed city in WV second only to the capital. I know the scale of the land is so borked in 76, but still.
---
Edited post to include pictures
---
Unyielding armor's main perk doesn't active until low health. I've been saving these and Bloodied weapons because they're so op, but you have to have 20% health to max it out. Then you have to be sneaky or one-shotting everything. If you use PA, your armor doesn't do anything to your stats. If I'm out of PA, I like medium weapons like a DCG. PA forces you into 2H or knives.
---
That's the one
---
Had 4 nuke events yesterday. 2 at white springs both crashed the server. 2 SBQ events, 1 caused game to freeze the other went okay but lots of 'sever not responding' messages.  Until they fix the server issues, it seems like a waste of time to start gathering flux only to have the server crash and  then have to dump the raw flux as you can't count on another nuke event before it spoils.
---
Hmm.....
---
Stop trying to kill me.
---
It's working.
---
Anyone who whines about being attacked while claiming a workshop is a douche, plain and simple. Theres 2 yao guai that spawn at dolly sods wilderness. One on the path directly in front of the building where you fast travel to, the other a few paces south with a crown so you get bonus loot as well. This is incredibly faster than any workshop if you just server hop after kills, they are always there.
---
\*\* 1st world problems \*\*
---
Just be careful what day you launch... seems like there someone every week on here that forgot about the reset and is stuck waiting for the new codes
---
I'm playing on Ps4 :).
---
 Off, yeah  now that you mention it...fuck.
---
I'll give it a try since most of the the times I hear about it are random spawns but just have no idea where I could farm a spawn spot.
---
This got weird fast, eh.  What platform?
---
I carry two weapons, Suppressed Hardened Henry rifle and combat shotgun.
---
I get your frustration, servers have been wildly unstable today.
---
I've taken over two workshops to get waste acid and aluminum, just for the server to crash and me to lose everything I built there, and not even be able to reap the resources.
---
Mark 3 has been glitched forever, never seen a 2
---
I’ll be online around 2100 (9pm) PST.  I’ll be looking for you.  I tend to craft with super duper on and occasionally get extra serums.  If I have surplus for the ones your needing then it’s a freebie.  
---
I take donations for services but by no means required or expected.   The only thing I frequently need is 5.56 ammo for my rifleman alternate.  Looking forward to meeting you.
---
That’s helpful
---
Pretty sure it's being done to introduce the one button for workshop repair, another button for "repair kit" repairs. It's bullshit that they're already screwing us over with this nonsense and the kits aren't even in-game yet.
---
That gets you waste acid!? I would happily do that over and over to avoid PVP. I wouldn’t claim a workshop if I didn’t need the acid... I’m sorry but one shooting someone and stealing all their work is a douche move... no way around it
---
Explosive and two shot were nerfed
---
Simple answer: People are sheep, so they hate anything that other people appear to hate.
