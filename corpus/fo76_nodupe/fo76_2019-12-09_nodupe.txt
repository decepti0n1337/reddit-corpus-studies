Yes, with the Class Freak perk.

Slowing down while aiming in 3rd person really needs added too.

Not needed. The mods are already on damage control. The post has been deleted.

It saves them time if they don't want to do the quests, though...

Jump servers?

He finally did. Lol
---
Camp Venture has one in one of the porter potties. Borroughs has a handful.
---
I had a dream that when you play the game it virtually transported you inside of it and everything and everyone looked as real as reality. It was pretty awesome.
---
Lol, I remember when I was a foolhardy low level I literally tried to fight everyone and got my ass handed to me on many many occasions. Lol
---
welp, time for me to build my CAMP near Welsh so I can keep an eye out for this precious chonk.
---
What format do you play on?
---
He's not referring to the toilet paper... üôÑ

I just thought it was funny. He was trying so hard too.
---
I got white spring, white powder, and...something else in a single event once, months ago.
---
The mods are already on damage control. They deleted the other post about the video. This one will go too.

Grafton steel mill is a nice place to level up and get stuff to sell and craft. If you do it right. heading from the dam go in on the second opening on the Jersey barriers or wall on the left and their is a room with a belt leading up then it stops their is another like grate incline thing head up it you may have to jump or straddle the sides for some reason you cant step over the vertical braces or w/e anyway snipe all the mutants theirs usually over 20 around their I'm level 44 and the highest I have seen is 28 usually 22 but the rest are 10 even 5. You'll see a pipe on top of that tower with a guy who has the keys for the plant if you walk towards the pipe until you touch it. You can slightly extend your cover and just take your time you can kill most of them but some will remain in the plant theirs a few even sitting down I guess mutants even need a break sometimes lol. Just make sure you haul ass up to the top of that tower and stay low and only venture far enough to the edges so that you can see the ones furthest from you to help eliminate the hail of bullets coming your way. Now gradually peek further over the edges as you eliminate the further most mutants it's like an ogre said onions have layers from the inner layers of the tower you can eliminate the furthest enemies while minimizing your damage and then head further out to take the next layer and so on and so forth.

Completely understand OPs request.

On ps4, you can appear offline, but it does say (any given) game may ignore the PS4 level status.
---
  But - it does get around the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô of some players who are configured to notify them when someone on their friends list logs in.
---
IDK if BGS provides a similar feature - then said  persons would have to be on the same 76 server as you to actually see you on-line.
---
Look at the menu on the bottom. There‚Äôs an option to filter to only what‚Äôs in that machine.
---
Free caps.  Theyll learn eventually.
---
Probably around the time of the actual holiday, as in when winter ends in the US.
---
But this is even more info. You know that a 1 star Enemy will drop a 1 star item. You also know a two star enemy has a chance to drop something better. Most likely will be one star but there is a chance at getting something better. A three star enemy has the highest chance of giving you better than 1 star loot and may even be 3 stars!
---
I really don‚Äôt see the problem here.
---
Toggle your item view.  Its triangle on PS4

Why so cheap?

I do. But I‚Äôm to lazy to explain it to you. Is Sunday... :P

Eating uncooked food and drinking dirty water from the hand pump will give you rads (that are not removed by healing factor)

Nobody said he was smart he just knows the bots leave after he's back to get hunt down players to for arrest warrants. he spends the rest of his time being big bubba it's harder for him since nobody showers let alone drops the soap anymore.
---
Just trying to sell it before it gets patched.
---
 I had about 8 copies of every ultracite plan in my vending machine for about 2 months for 9 caps each and sold exactly 2 of them in that time. I finally dropped them all at a train station a few days ago.
---
If we were on the same system I'd help you out. I wanted a full set of t51b a while back and server hopped watoga a while back to get it.  At that point all the robots were hostile to me and it gave me a push to finally do mayor for a day.  Added something new to the game and gave me something to do.  It's really super easy to get both sets by server hopping and you will end up with tons of fusion cores from all the frames you are checking for parts.  It's up to you if you want to just find someone to give it to you or you want to earn it I suppose.
---
I understand you don‚Äôt want to be frustrated by a 3 star enemy dropping a 1 star weapon... but it‚Äôs still random. Reset your expectations and just get excited when it does drop something good.
---
Sounds good! I got a kid so I‚Äôm not on too much, but I‚Äôll help out while I‚Äôm on!
---
So are power armor frames different from other items in the world then? They won't be empty if you come back on a new server?
---
Yes you should be low on stuff. It‚Äôs the only real challenge early on. Switch to melee to conserve ammo. Also use something like a hunting rifle that uses less ammo.
---
Drop something good? They never do! Is just things to grind for script! You should know that by now. The only good stuff is with the purveyor
---
.....uh yeah.  It IS like that.  Good call lol.  Thanks for ruining FlapJack
---
I got a bloody FFR combat rifle last week off a deathclaw. Purveyor has same RNG.
---
We deleted the other one because theres no need for 2 posts of the same video.
---
Cool name tho
---
It won‚Äôt be so funny when Preston‚Äôs grandfather appears in wastelanders.
---
This is what I do. My wife hates it.
---
My Instigating +Power Attack +Str Super Sledge was a loot drop. 
---
The Purveyor uses the exact same RNG tables as the random drops. The **only** difference is you chose the star level of the ‚Äòdrop‚Äô with the Purveyor. 
---
Nothing else.
---
Did you get a 3 star drop from it? That would be new.
---

No

I don't think so. Despite 15 luck I can't overcome rng
---
Isn't it? I bought it for 2000 Atoms.
---
I remember seeing a lot of other posts being repeated though. I see a bunch of "didn't get my atoms" posts, a lot of "my scrap got deleted" posts show up as well if I do a search.
---
Funny how you didn't feel only one of them was required.
---
Also since when is it in the sub rules if two different people choose to post the same video one must be deleted?
---
Glad I took the advice! Pulled a AAE sub machine from her
---
I'm never going to forget how you scammed me, Beth. :) Everybody I know have completely lost faith in you, and would never pre-order anything (again) from you criminals. :)
---
To address your bitchy edit, people aren't downvoting for the word "Dupe" they're downvoting because you're being petty.
---
LOL
---
I..... Did not know these were a thing....
---
Quick YouTube shows, yeah... Something just like that, maybe a protection that can give you a terminal readout or whatever to keep it in lore..
---
He was 'testing his gun' lol
---
That's how I hang my TP
---
always has an easily grabbed tail.
---
When I hang it "over" it tends to not have a tail after being torn and I liken it to picking the end of a roll of tape
---
I think you nailed it, watched the whole thing on and off xD You don't notice how little is in the atom shop because it shows the items you have. Only 6 suits!
---
Yeah it makes sense. That guy died from E.coli because the TP was impossible to use. The nuke simply cremated his body.
---
When I first found Murgle I told my friend to come and look, then they killed Murgle and ate his flesh in front of me.
---
I smushed murgle with my hammer 20 mins ago
---
Real talk, this guy is an idiot. He doesn't understand how the challenges work with regards to the new vault raid. 
---
This also is nothing against the particular arguement in the video. Just him and his understanding of Fallout 76
---
They've been doing this since they introduced the C.C. in FO4 and Skyrim.  
---
As long as ppl enjoy the games and are willing to put up with this, they will continue to expand on these business principles.
---
How many math classes did you skip because your understanding of bell curves isn't very good.
---
Blame Zenimax and ProvidenceEquity - corporate on top, not the devs, Todd, and Uncle Pete. I highly doubt the devs at BGS like the monetization, but corporate demands it in order to increase profit: meet the quota or else.
---
Bubbles in My Beer is my favorite!

The first time you visit the overseer‚Äôs camp, there‚Äôs a bunch of materials in the red toolbox. If you haven‚Äôt taken it, yet, take all that - I think it includes enough leather to make a piece of armor.
---
Can someone explain the Creation Club to me?  Was it community created content that players paid for?  Did the money go to Bethesda and the creator, or just Bethesda?  Why do people love the CC so much vs the current atom shop?
---
Great :/
---
Because it *just works*.
---
I mean I give people free chems to get them started and the lifetime of addiction and financial problems comes included at no extra charge.
---
So, just leave it where it is and hope Bethesda fixes it, then.
---
Tamed animals count as turrets. There is currently a bug that makes your turrets become hostile to the rest of your CAMP turrets. Your rogue Turret sees your cow Turret as a threat üòÇ
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In my opinion Bethesda should have gone down the route of 76 being a free open source game like the monstrosity that is Fortnite.
---
No one would then have complained about micro-transactions to raise revenue.
---
Being economical with truth regards their plans has only worsened the situation.
---
From my own personnel perspective i dont really care.I have played the game enjoyed it for the most.I have only spent Atoms i have earned in game.
---
No one has anyone by the Throat demanding money.The Gamer has all the power,you can just walk away if you feel that strongly about it..
---
Sure the way Bethesda went about it was wrong.Sadly this is the future for gaming.I dont like it,but that is Capitalism for [you.Supply](https://you.Supply) and demand.
---
They will be if you get unlucky and end up back on the same server. Happens sometimes but not very often.  If you get a different server they will respawn even if you just looted them, assuming nobody else has looted them recently.  Most the time if people do loot them they only take the cores and not the parts anyways.  In watoga there is the one right in the middle of the city by AMS headquarters but there are also 2 on the rooftops that I know of and I've heard there are more somewhere?
---
Not sure if you've done mayor for a day or not.  If not the robots will attack you but either you can run past them of kill them for xp.  The raider will be a little harder to get since it is just one suit but server hop, see if you get anything and if not try again tomorrow.  Even if you are super unlucky you will find everything you need in a few days if you spend 10 minutes server hopping those places a day. There is a limited pool of servers you will spawn in while hopping but it's at least 10 from my experience.
---
 By the time I finished my t51 from watoga after 20 minutes I had about 20 fusion cores from all of the frames I had looted.
---
That explains it. Not just yesterday, I think it‚Äôs been doing that for awhile, at least occasionally. I‚Äôve had cases where I met two of the requirements, but ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù was also checked and I wasn‚Äôt.
---
Thats a damn rip off!
---
We already move repeat posts with Bethesda Plz, and the posts you mention, while similar, give different information. The other post for this video was just a link. You gain nothing for seeing one over another. This has always been our policy.
---
If you are involved, you are involved.
---
Only on private servers though
---
God roll fixers were duped to oblivion around October on PC. BE, Bffr, you name it. Heard dupers were intentionally limiting the supplies to regulate the weapon's value. About them dupes, there always is a way to dupe it's just that dupers with working methods are not sharing cause once it's spread around in the community, Bethesda is rather quick to hotfix it. But as long as they keep to themselves, Bethesda don't do anything. So there you have it
---
Us overencumbered types can still run, it just costs AP to do so.

No FT is only a PITA in certain situations.

Thats why I launched from Charlie and dropped on Toxic Valley.  I needed violet, lots of it in the Valley, and Charlie is a short walk run from Valley.  Got something like 200 violet out of that...and had enough of the other mats on hand to stabile most of it.
---
All that said -

I have been dropped 600# so I no longer \_have to\_ be in excavator,  (Which I am rather enjoying) I Just need to get the right Non PA armor and weapon combo so I‚Äôm not as squishy,

I‚Äôve been finding two in the live fire area recently. Both in the same building.

I accidently killed murgle once
---
Ah, yes I meant sprint
---
So if I add my own opinion piece to it, it should not count as a repeat post right?
---
Most of the time.
---
If you want to sell the Forest Scout Armour Mask for Caps i am interested.
---
I have a pool of friends i can server hop to in the end. And I know an easier way to farm fusion cores :P

I literally had 3 Rolling Pins drop today one after another,unreal :-(

Roy Cleveland Sullivan was a United States park ranger in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. Between 1942 and 1977, Sullivan was hit by lightning on seven different occasions and survived all of them. For this reason, he gained a nickname "Human Lightning Conductor" and "Human Lightning Rod". Wikipedia

Thank you! I remember the post and I try the same thing with the long barrel and it didn't work. Now my bloodied flamer vats might work properly
---
"I hate fun things, take them away from other players."
---
No. They might have encouraged it, but the buck stops with Bethesda. So, "the devs, Todd, and Uncle Pete" are liars and criminals.
---
Pretty sure Park Bench plans are sold by Grahm. What platform are you on?
---
Also, Shielded Marine Wetsuit is something you can get after you've learned the Protective plan - Cop a Squatter and Census Violence in the Cranberry Bog will both reward these. Census Violence is almost always going on in the Bog, but it doesn't always activate unless a player is in the Bog. I live in the Bog, so it's always active for me. Cop a Squatter is a Daily for the CB region, given out by a police Gutsy in Watoga if it doesn't automatically show up when you log in each day.
---
In order to isolate the variables you might do the following test:
---
1) On your high agility character equip your unyielfing armor and take your chameleon armor with you. Equip snesk rank 3
---
2) Find an NPC whicn is not moving and stealthily approach it close enough.
---
3) While crounching without moving, go into your pipboy and replace one of your unyielding pieces with a chameleon piece. Close the pipboy and note the change in your [ HIDDEN ] status if there is any.
---
4) Repeat step 3 until all of you armor is chameleon.
---
5) While crounching without moving go into your pipboy and unequip one of your chameleon pieces without replacing it with any armor. Close your pipboy and note the difference.
---
6) Repest step 5 until you have no armor at all.
---
7) During any of the steps you might also unequip your sneak card and note the difference. But don't forget to reequip it otherwise the results will be not adequate.
---
I am absolutely sure that such a test will change your ooinion about "chameleon armor having 0 impact" in PVE.

Insightful video, strong work on the overall historical presentation.  I am curious as well where this goes.  I continue to play since day one, and subscribe.  Oddly, these tactics seem focused on milking money out of people with impulse buys.  Almost as if they prey on those who spend and suspect they will spend even more.  
---
I stopped buying Atoms when I subscribed, but I am curious how many continue to spend.
---
Unforgivable.
---
I'm on PS4. I appreciate the info. Didn't know i could get it from squatter too. I'll have to start grinding that one as well! Thanks!
---
I bet you did it
---
Hundreds of hours in the game and no idea how to get the weapon.

TSE combat rifle with long barrel and suppressor makes a nifty sniper rifle

They tend to hang out around/in the bungalows and the white springs clubhouse.  You can lure them to the bots guarding the gates.  As long as you get some damage in, the bot kills will count.
---
MATN is most certainly not an idiot.
---
But I would say that if you ever watched the video where he tried to do the Vault Raid, you could immediately tell that he and the rest of his YouTube squad were in-over-their-head.  I'm not sure the gun he brought was even Legendary.  Their whole group basically got wrecked by the enemies alone because they waltzed in thinking it would be another day at the office, and they aren't nearly as experienced or familiar with the game as the target audience for the Vault Raids.
---
If you get good and familiar with the Vault Raids, you don't really need to repair anything.  And even if you did, one of the rewards you get from the Vault Raid is, in fact, the Improved Repair Kit.  Several of them.  Which is something MATN totally left out of this video - you earn quite a few Repair Kits doing endgame content.  It's not some Atomic Shop-exclusive thing.
---
That's going to be tricky. With all the time you would spend doing that it would be easier to just run them I'm circles and VATS their heads.
---
Absolutely not true.
---
That guy on the toilet. He did it. He must be a synth!
---
I'm not referring to his skill on 76. Just his understanding of the game's mechanics. And he didn't know them...
---
Had that happen myself.  I forget which mod it was but taking the mods off and reapplying them both should work.  Want to say it was the material mod.
---
You get it from the Camden Park vendor with Mr Fuzzy Tokens
---
Honestly,  almost all the friends I made was while in game. You can also join some fb groups with like styled players and find people to play with. Or, just ask for someone to group with on here. What platform?
---
I didn‚Äôt even think of Facebook. I‚Äôm on PC, there‚Äôs no text option in the game is there?
---
I've had that before, and i was nowhere near my weight limit. Usually changing servers is enough to fix it.
---
When 76 has had too many nice things lately so you gotta drum up some hate clicks.
---
better xp killing super mutants or mole miners at lower levels- Less risky too.  White springs is ok but West tek super mutants is better. Scorched beast in cranberry bog once you can drop them fast are really the best and efficient IMHO. Arty has a cool down- Tesla and grenades would be faster.  I leveled a new character over the last few days just doing Mr fuzzy carnival games and  capturing/defending workshops. All they have is a recon rifle lv 5 and leather armor lv 5.
---
Literally unwipeable.
---
Not currently., unfortunately
---
As a revolver lover, I would take an Instigating or a quadruple over the bloodied explosive. I have them all (maybe 30-40 max level revolvers) and effects like limb damage, love vats cost or extra hit percentage are the way to go.
---
Don't underestimate the unique revolver Somerset Special. Anti-armor is good in a revolver. 
---
Quadruple is good because you will probably be able to shoot 20 shots before running out of AP. If your build is good, that means 20 dead enemies. 
---
My favourite, however, is a hardened instigating western revolver, plus limb damage, plus reduced weight. 
---
Bloodied explosive revolvers look silly, but... It is all about tastes.
---
Nice things? What nice things?
---
The same point he made about mine could just as easily apply to his. 
---
I just want people to stop the us vs. them. Not everyone hates the game. Some people want it to do better.
---
EDIT: didnt realize it was a different poster. Even still.
---
And radworms
---
Good and bad, hits the mark on a lot of content but also 42 minutes long video that could be shortened to like 10-15 combined with some genuine tinfoil hat stuff. I give it a 6
---
Both tests were performed in daylight, one after another. The server was the same. After the first test, I killed the Deathclaw. Each time a new player appears in the area, the Deathclaw respawns, so this was a fresh Deathclaw. The tests were as identical as they could possibly be.
---
With the low-Agility character: When crouched, at a complete stop, with 5 Chameleon armor pieces on, the Deathclaw saw me and ran straight at me for an attack. When I was crouched and out of sight, the Caution status was bordering a switch to Danger status. When I moved just slightly and was out of sight, the Caution status immediately switched to Danger. Because the Deathclaw's Perception was enough to overpower any Agility I had, and because Chameleon is a visual effect only, the Deathclaw immediately sensed I was around with even the slightest movement. Even when I was invisible in front of the Deathclaw, it saw me.
---
With the high-Agility character: I could crouch-walk, jump, stand in front of the Deathclaw in plain sight, and even discharge my silenced weapon right next to it. No matter what I did or how close to it I got, it could not see me. My massive Agility and boosted Sneak achieved the desired invisibility effect.
---
Try your own test with the Deathclaw. Your earlier test with a Turret wouldn't achieve a clean result. Turrets are bugged and blind when it comes to players. I will see if I have a low-Agility character with both a full set of Chameleon AND a full set of Unyielding...
---
Which has nothing to do with the video being discussed. So why did you bring it up at all in this topic?
---
The gutsy would probably be a good option that way it could drill sargent you while doing so
---
I hate the game AND want it to do better. I hate it because it's bad and unfinished. I want it to do better because I enjoy the core gameplay loop. You can be both, it's fine.
---
Imagine getting so worked up over someone doing the thing every single subreddit does.
---
Some kids tend to do that, asking for your best items. Maybe they are new, maybe they are too young, who knows. 
---
Funny thing is they ask for EVERY good item you carry. They are not shy...
---
its ok, Murgle probably forgot about you the moment you left her.
---
Lore wise, I've always taken it that the cores are reusable and rechargeable because of the fusion generators. Effectively the core is a battery that contains energy that is tapped for whatever piece of technology requires it, such as the gatling laser and the fusion cells are the same thing on a smaller scale. 
---
Some folks look at it along the lines of the core being what powers the generator, but many of the generators we encounter haven't got one installed, yet they still pump out power. I look at it as the console being a recharger station for cores that syphon off energy from the main generator and if you leave one inside it, it acts as a sort of emergency power system. The idea that we could recharge cores is in interesting one, but how that would be balanced for gameplay, I'm not sure what method would work.
---
Oooh i like this
---
They had a note in Vault 76 about putting it the right way, looks like someone forgot to read it
---
A local radio station plays a newer but great version! It wakes me up lol
---
Very nice pictures!  Thought about doing the same thing,  glad to see it honestly.
---
Because it's a blatant lie. Type "Fallout 1st Atoms" and you'll see a bunch of posts that just say "I didn't get my atoms this month". No new info. The mods clearly hate anything that speaks up against their Bethesda overlords, that's all.
---
They even employed shills and bots to upvote their dumbass lie and downvote my comment, lol.
---
Ok I'm done with this game.
---
that means your already have that code
---
It‚Äôs obviously bugged, it might be that way for all marine armor.
---
Some high level players usually keep a character packed with perks and effects to make weapons really light. That helps a lot. 
---
I tried roleplaying a travelling merchant. With five pieces of weight reductions and shit, I was able to carry over 60 weapons comfortably, plus 30 armor pieces.
---
Mate if they were defending Bethesda don't you think they would have been removing those as well to save face when things went wrong? I can't tell if this is bait or you're genuinely that dumb but fuck if it is you hooked me good.
---
Literally unclean.
---
Tons of them.
---
That is my plan .. my budget is full so I can't replace 2 turrets of 4, so I am going to wait till patch 16 and if it doesn't work scrap my house . starting with the turrets to see if that fixes it.  I never was able to try scraping and then building a new turret while watching my build limit but that should work. I never tried scraping all items in my stored tab either to see if I get excessive build room back.  I just got to level 30 and armour piercing on my shotgun so I have been focused on xp and !evening, and hitting a couple of spots I missed in toxic valley to focus on the ash heap
---
learn to use conduits. You can have a virtually wireless camp. Except for the wire you hook up to your main generator. Turrets must be wired but there's Subs focused on CAMP building with videos and stuff to help you please the tricks.
---
The video is spot on. An excellent dissection of the scummy and underhanded tactics being utilized by Bethesda, and they've been doing it for FAR longer than many people seem to realize.
---
I think the thing that bothers me almost as much as Bethesda being scummy, greedy assholes, is that in a good game, many of the Atomic Shop items would be cool earnable in-game rewards for actually playing the game. Instead, give us more money for our broken game please. Our broken game that has remained broken for over a year, mind you.
---
Uhh...have you seen his other videos? He spends [two and a half hours](https://youtu.be/W31mxU9s6MI) detailing the mechanics of the game (as it stood at the time). And don‚Äôt even get me started on his series on F:NV and FO3. This man knows his Fallout.

New wastelanders screenshots, new Christmas event next week, free trial next week, double XP next week, Halloween challenges returning, new Christmas challenges, free santatron in the Atom Shop, promises of more wastelanders news after the new year, etc.

What was the one, I'm packin and wackin and smackin
---
Yeah, or give you like generic perk tips something like "**PUT MORE TRAINING IN WITH YOUR RIFLES, MAGGOT**"
---
I'm not trying to tell you that chameleon armor on a low agility character is as good as  unyielding armor on a high agility character. Absolutely not. I just disagree with your statement that "chameleon has 0 effect" in PVE. I think my arguments are logical enough, you just don't want to see my point and correct your statement.

A true bucket list

If it was easy, there would be no sense of accomplishment when you finally launch.

Try the Charleston Capitol building. Sometimes there‚Äôs no legendaries, but sometimes there are multiples, up to 4 3*. I‚Äôve gotten some great drops in there ‚Äî best thing I‚Äôve picked up was a BE 10mm submachine gun. Good luck!
---
Not saying it should be easy but I feel like they should scale it down I‚Äôm a level 40 fighting lvl 70 assaultrons like wtf
---
I don't use Teslas or handmades. I PvP 50% of my time in the wasteland. I watch workshops while I'm in adventure mode. If I see someone taking it; I sneak up and wait to strike. I don't care if it's a while squad of level 200 players. I've solo'd that before and gotten everyone's junk. I may get killed sure but the main thrill for me is bulk acid , fiber optics, steel, lead , screws and gears. it's like steal the bacon. My goal is to hit hard and fast, grab the junk and run away to stash it in my tent or in a box. I'll stick around to fight till I get killed twice or until they stop coming back.

I‚Äôm on PS4 yea

What exactly is special about what Bethesda is doing? Sure they deserve credit for the things you mentioned, but to a degree. They're not the greatest developer ever all of a sudden. They deserve a small "good job" and that's about it. Nothing more. Also, all this for a broken game that has now remained broken for over a year.
---
Aren‚Äôt those always low level legendaries?
---
I'm only a few hours in but I seen a yellow frame in my craft menu ? I needed the plan but its possible is it not ?
---
moving your camp will store all placed items, allowing you to replace them for free, but i do not recall if it will auto blueprint your pre-existing structures.
---
I would help
---
I love this. I‚Äôll look you up if I‚Äôm online during this time (working long hours currently). Happy to donate fully modded guns and armor, ammo, plans and food/water. What‚Äôs your IGN?
---
Veteran player playing monster hunter with some friends, at the moment but I‚Äôd you wanna launch a couple nukes I‚Äôll help you if you want it and your on in a bit.
---
No because the community managers' latest policy is to only cater to Fallout 1st related queries. Look at the Bethesda replied bot on the sub, in the last few weeks they have *only* replied to Fallout 1st customers, chiefly regarding atoms and the price of the second skin when it was originally released for 500 atoms. The mods follow a similar policy: there's no saving face going on here. It's simply trying to show that they "care" about their customers, as long as the customer ensures a steady source of income. Other people who bought the game can go fuck themselves. Any issue they raise is promptly deleted to make it look like there are no issues. Only praise posts are kept.
---
To min max beyond perks?  You want a low health build with gear.
---
only, and i mean only flamer i bother to use is the napalm tank
---
Im thinking very likely. Loading up all my characters and gonna use the 2xXP weekend to bring 2 more up to level 50 (hopefully) so I can blow 5K scrip - that's the aim anyway.
---
&gt;It drives me crazy that Bethesda employs some of the best environment artists and some of the industry's worst game and systems designers.
---
So true lol
---
No, when I was doing the DMV part of the main  quest at level 55 they were mostly 62 with some 42s as well. What level legendary creature do you want? SBQ is 95, that's pretty high level

Quit trolling, you aren't good at it.

I‚Äôm on rn

Oh no I do t mean the enemies levels, I mean the actual loots level, like I don‚Äôt want a legendary level 15 handmade

When Woodstock was going on, the number one song was The Archies "Sugar Sugar". Don't pretend that top 40 has ever been anything but a wasteland of vapid bullshit with the very occasional gem.

I will be so disappointed if he's not actually there.

Ok, I‚Äôve got that one jotted down, any other ones good for farming?
---
Beginning and end is a completely different thing then something having sides which it it has no up or down because it's round but as far as right or wrong way Guess that'd be sideways because corporate controls everything.
---
Me I prefer tp to sit on the counter since I'd rather not bat at like a kitty cat and wrapping my hand makes sure I don't get shit on it.
---
You're wrong because you've assumed that the mean falls on neutral. Look around the internet and you'll clearly see that is not the case. So this would be a skewed distribution with a maximum weight around hatred. So no, the most probable distribution is definitely not "neutral". Most people dislike the game to some degree.
---
Go read a probability and statistics book, you quoting Wikipedia does not trump my mathematics degree.
---
A little over a minute in and you state you accepted micro transactions would be needed to pay for the ongoing service.  Devs publicly stated that the service would remain free. You were being a realist I must presume, yet that very detail must be addressed (just a minor criticism). Good job with this, awesome job providing context with your facts as well.  These comments are for the author, no necessarily the poster.  Good post tho
---
Too much leftover turkey?
---
Flooded Trainyard has been kind to me, as well as the NAR Repair Yard. Both locations also have spawn points for plans, clothing, magazines, and mods.
---
I‚Äôm curious myself. Without trying I‚Äôve got almost 100 kills on this challenge and I‚Äôve never killed one without some kind of weapon equipped
---
Find where you want to move, open your pip boy and push the button for "move camp." ( L1 for PS4) 
---
Your camp will be auto-blue printed but its pretty unlikely that the terrain will let you place your former camp as is.
---
That's about how it is fir me. Occasionally I'll get 2 or 3 at west tek. Like once every couple weeks.
---
Also sideways would also compensate for being left handed so it's the politically correct way as well.
---
Yeah, certifiable, not doubt about it. You would be a great filthy casual though, just don't forget to use a Rad shower when you come across one. Happy WV trails mate and don't forget to boil your water.
---
When I first found Murgle I actually built a whole camp around the shed as well as a small garden behind it and a little area for Murgle out front. 
---
There‚Äôs a vendor right down the wooden steps just passed the shed too. 
---
Miss that old camp, and Murgle for taking away some of the emptiness the game has sometimes.
---
Been a hot minute,
---
But def not disappointed...
---
Dope as always Cowboy
---
Stay Blessed
---
Correct

Thanks!

Maybe power armor counts? Try using mines and nades
---
I gotta keep mine like that so the cat's don't have a three course meal of toilet paper at their disposal.
---
Okay PSN: AttackOnYuri Do you have a radiation suit or power armor?
---
What level are you?

A few remarks:
---
* He overlooks the various free things that are added on a fairly regular basis.  True, wallpaper wasn't initially offered for free, and *yes, people did complain about that*, but we've had a couple weeks of wallpaper freebies since then which he failed to mention despite being within the scope of his video.  He makes a big deal about the price of the Halloween bundles, but doesn't mention all the pumpkins, displays, and unique clothing that dropped in Mischief Night.
---
* He overlooks that Improved Repair Kits frequently drop from common endgame activities, like the Scorchbeast Queen, Encryptid, and Vault Raids.  They also drop, quietly, just for killing Scorchbeasts in general.  They are utility items you can earn in the game.  And unlike Atoms, that collection rate doesn't drop off either.
---
* I think by repeatedly highlighting the whole "The total cost of this week's content is X-thousand Atoms," he repeats one of the arguments I found so odd against Borderlands 2, which was that much of its microtransaction criticism was based on this hypothetical player who not only needed, but *expected* to own *everything* in the store.  That's a bit like going into a Wal-Mart and complaining that there is a million dollar's worth of inventory you can't own.  There's a lot in the Atomic Shop I don't own and never will because it doesn't appeal to me.  Have some bloody sales resistance.
---
* Once you understand the pattern of the Atomic Shop's Vaulting mechanism, FOMO isn't a thing.
---
* He overplays the Vault Suit in Nuclear Winter complaint.  Yeah, wearing a bright blue jumpsuit is a bad choice, but no, you don't need to buy "camouflage" in the Atomic Shop to counter this.  You just go naked.
---
* Seriously, are we still talking about that temporary +15 max health bonus from the Unstoppables bundle like it was a mass conspiracy?
---
* The current emptiness of the Atomic Shop kind of belies the idea that Bethesda are evil marketing geniuses, because I suspect it's quite difficult to convince people that 1st is worth it when you show them the 7 whole outfits they can currently buy.
---
* I'm not really into his whole "perceived value" argument.  What's the argument?  That it's wrong to put a value on data because it's not physical?  That it's disingenuous to have any kind of sale on said data because you have no physical stock to move?  This strikes me as a distinction without a difference.  Try applying the same logic to digital game sales in general... it doesn't really hold up.
---
* He remarks that the Vault Raids were made brutally difficult to sell Repair Kits.  Yeah, Jon, Oxhorn, et al, with all due respect, you ain't very good at the Vault Raid.  Oh yes, they are quite difficult - often for reasons they shouldn't be - but you guys went in with mediocre gear and got your butts handed to you.  Maybe you didn't notice, also, that the Vault Raid actually rewards Repair Kits.
---
What is he right about:
---
* The pattern of offering free things, and then selling the skins or variations of them, has fallen by the wayside on things like wallpapers, the Collectron, Refrigerator, etc.  This is disappointing.
---
* Last Christmas sale?  Sleazy af.  It's no wonder you don't see much Christmas stuff.
---
* The previously mentioned emptiness of the Atomic Shop is just silly at this point.
---
* Bethesda will continue pushing on things until they meet resistance.  Criticism is a healthy thing, but it has to be grounded in something real, instead of getting outraged over every perceived slight.
---

But then we'd miss some very, very interesting details, indeed.
---
You beat the game to get access to the silo? Sorry about all the question I‚Äôve had someone have this issue when tried to bring them into a silo
---
CC is Bethesda's second attempt to monetize mods. Modders make submissions and Bethesda vets the stuff (to what degree I don't know, but CC updates aren't that common). Both sides share the profit but I'm not sure what the split is.
---
I don't think anyone particularly loves CC, but it does look great compared to the Atom Shop. Mainly because you get more from CC content for less money. Atoms and CC credits are virtually the same value, so some examples include skin packs for 100 (normally like 300-500 for a single skin on AS), home decor workshop giving 85 items for 200 (compared to spending like 300-700 for one item on AS), and huge player housing updates like Shroud Manor, Neon Flats, and Noir Penthouse, which each unlock a full unique home you can customize + new assets for 400-600 creds.
---
CC is vastly superior to the Atom Shop in every way; quantity, quality, and epicness. They should have been working with FO4 modders to produce all of the Atom Shop content from the start, but it often seems like they're recycling assets for AS and thus probably not putting much effort in.
---
I can get inside the silos it‚Äôs just the radiation at bravo I can‚Äôt do it and plus assaulttrons attacking me
---
Uncle Sam approves this message
---
You are literally stating promises are a nice thing.  I truly mean no disrespect but just think about that statement.
---
It‚Äôs not hard if you‚Äôre over level 60 or so
---
*PTSD* Butcher Pete lol
---
Leader of the Pack is perfect for a lvl 10. It pops up frequently. Pick up some legendary melee weapons and save your ammo for a while.
---
What platform are you on? I or someone else would be more than happy to hook you up with some ammo and stim packs and water
---
Fort Defiance has a great variety of junk. Also stop by Big Al‚Äôs Tattoo Parlor once a day, it also has a good variety, just not a ton.
---
Ballistic Fiber is all over in the Cranberry Bog if you need that.
---
Workshops are the slowest and most inefficient way to get resources. Just pick up tons of junk and only use your search marker for stuff like lead, crystal, circuits, ballistic fiber, nuclear waste.

Ive been doing the same thing, sort of a wasteland photojournalist thing! I got some neat pics from a Scorched Earth event, as well as a group of super mutants taking on a deathclaw.
---
Nice work!
---
People talking cats. More important is spiders. This way you see them instead of them quietly dropping onto your hand when you pull down.
---
Trust me you will get better. Just memorize where and what to do for everything and do it fast. I can speedrun nukes solo by myself in about 10 minutes.
---
this happened to me once and i thought i was crazy after i stripped and re-modded my armor piece!

or we‚Äôre both crazy....

Cool me too. I‚Äôll be online in a few minutes I can hook you up with anything you‚Äôre running low on, I might have some level 10 or 15 weapons and armor. I can throw together a care package for you.
---
That‚Äôs exactly what a Sinth! Would say..
---
Ya‚Äôll some battered housewives. These things are in any game. Stop congratulating Bethesda for the bare minimum.
---
God I'd love a throwing weapons revamp....can you imagine throwing spears? So great
---
Until then fireproof 3 and daydreaming about throwing spears until they land
---
Bloodied Meathook build. 
---
Meathook is dual compatible with the unarmed and one handed perks.
---
I forgot one mine i had equipped, that counts as a weapon too unfortunately lol. It works now
---
I miss the fireball mod for it.
---
Not capitalism in the the least, it‚Äôs corporatism. Remember when Beth bought out a studio halting its game development?

Good grief! üëÄ I was honestly joking, what could that post possible have done to anyone, aren't people entitled to their opinion?

**"Sorry, this post was deleted by the person who originally posted it."**

But that could just be a form entry.
---
I scrip the pieces when it happens and I never kept track.
---
I won‚Äôt be able to play tonight I work second shift I play after 2am when I get off but weekends I play normal hours
---
Bethesda starts doing things right so the haters gotta bring up old news again, zzzzzzzz. the cult of bethesda bashing, still lingering
---
I just farm hordes, events, fort defiance and whitespring for legendaries.
---
Yeah I think I need to get heavy weapons but I am entirely perked out for a melee PA build. I recently got  a full unyeilding set, though, if I get a Bloodied Weapon I may switch.
---
sounds logical tho. i refused to give up cuz it‚Äôs weightless sentinel
---
oh god the thing is that could really happen and I both hate it and love it
---
Should blueprint what it considers "buildings". Everything else is stored. I use buildings loosely since I've had it blueprint water purifers... Basically though it'll blueprint anything attached to something else. And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. This is just what I've noticed lol
---
Don't engage anyone
---
I tend to run a medium regular scope on my rifles. I have a recon on my 10mm for that one event that calls for it. 
---
I haaate the "night vision" affect.
---
You can message me here or pm me on Xbox my gt is heathen yak. Especially if you see I‚Äôm already online I will definitely make some time to help a new player out.
---
I‚Äôve been doing it, bare fists is the only way, but no you cant use PA. You can have guns on you but you have to kill the bot with bare fists...
---
2 ways, drop the equipped gun you are using (and pick it up but don‚Äôt re-equip it) or ‚Äúbreak‚Äù it....
---
Best way i found is to farm WS when the nuke subsides at WS golf course and the robot eyebots spawn in...
---
Don‚Äôt know and other good mass low level robot locations....
---
False advertising is a crime, and John mentioned how the "50% off even though we've never sold it at full price!" thing is also a crime in a lot of markets. So yes, criminals.
---
Yeah. Not even NIGHT VISION. Lol
---
The air was gravid with heavy fact and info, it fair fell on my head.
---
I should of prefaced that diatribe with...
---
**In my opinion. üëç**
---
I‚Äôve done this a bunch of times, it‚Äôs stopped showing up for me. On private server you could do it at Violent Night, and almost always one at Freddy‚Äôs.
---
Ok definitely will do i always play solo so it will be nice to have company
---
Ouch
---
Keep an eye out for one tenth weight weapons; even w out perks they do okay.
---
You nailed it. They cashed in all of my good will, loyalty, and future purchases for a quick $60. I hope it was worth it, Bethesda, you scum bags.
---
Luckily I'm on PC so I can use Perf Loadout Manager from nexus, so I'll take your advice and make a Nuke Zone perk build to fast key into.
---
Seems I may need to, I just like running about in my leather armor.
---
What was his reddit account name also xb1 ps4 pc?
---
lol, I think about a dozen lines were crossed.
---
I cleared wendingo cave of everything and kept running around frustrated and it magically showed up. You could always server hop fort defiance a couple times, they spawn there quite a bit.
---
Freddy Fear's always seems to be lone ghouls or scorched for me. I'm guessing these Wendigos are scared of my bloodied DCG üòä
---
XB1 and idk the Reddit account wish I did
---
That's because it's basically an endgame quest, you can't expect it to be easy, especially for a lvl 40.
---
I mean i have a buddy whos 40+ and he enjoys it. I mean personally it has its ups and downs but i think ita going on sale very soon so you may wanna wait. Also if its suppose to be free to play temporarily here shortly so you can test it
---
Walk down the road from abbies bunker theres a chance for 3 wendigos to spawn just walk down the road and keep vatsing you‚Äôll see em.
---
For the free weekend I would definitely give it a try but it's not in the best state at the moment. I play on Xbox and started playing during the last free weekend. So you should try it and see if it's something you would want to play
---
Theyre in the trees
---
You could try the freeplay. What's tue harm, except for a few hours lost?
---
Although for a muxh better experience, I'd genuinely suggest Fallout 4. If you liked Fallout 3 then 4 will not disappoint you, 76 may. Try Fallout 4 and see how much you like the crafting and survival thing, and then try coming back to 76. 76 is a lot more grind focussed though, so that may or may not be your thing.
---
Yes, he does.  But he also has this habit of acting like he's speaking from a position of objectivity when he's just as opinionated as anyone else.
---
I disagree with much of that video, for example.  He loves Fallout 4's survival mode and laments that Bethesda missed the boat in making 76 a more hardcore survival game.  But that's one very specific take, isn't it?  The big appeal of the Bethesda open world is that you can impose your own rules and the game humors whatever you decide to do.  You can make the game as easy or hard as you want it to be.  Want a survival mode?  Go play with non-Legendary Wood Armor.  Take Speed Demon so you have to eat and drink constantly.  Don't get a backpack so inventory space is precious.
---
Did you meet him on reddit?
---
Sokka from the last air bender you mean? personally i think it is a reference.. too bad the weapon itself is kinda trash
---
Not true, PA works fine. My dumbass just missed one equipped granede on me and that was it I guess. My tip for a farming location is just inside whitesprings. The robots immediately respawn after destroying them and you‚Äôre getting respawned inside the building as well in seconds (no walking back in there which would be time consuming and no need to waste stims). I only destroy the maids and janitors, usually one punch them and getting around 7 down before the turrets and aussaltrons whip my ass.
---
&gt; Bethesda being scummy, greedy assholes
---
Do you work for a living?  Do you expect to get paid for working?
---
Meteoric steel swords are a thing in real life, probably a reference to those
---
The meat bombs that the Rose quest gives access to provoke landing.  Simply toss one, run around it for a few moments, and 90% of the time they land.
---
The main questline fizzled for me right away. Once you realize everyone was dead it seemed pointless.  Also back when the game first came out the enemies all scaled quickly and you would get stuck fighting a dozen max level mutants while you were at level 30. Lol
---
What did they never sell at full price?
---
I sold those ages ago. I know of this though, but I am looking for a weapon type that could take them out from air without modifying my build (much) currently.
---
I enjoy the game. I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs frustrating at times and I did take a 3 month vacation from it after putting in around 1500 hours. Coming back was very interesting because a lot had changed and the changes were very much for the better. The game has come a long way in the bug department but still has some issues. I‚Äôm in my early 30s and still play a lot of other games but fallout is tied with halo as my favorite franchises. I‚Äôd say play during the free trial period and see what you think. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll enjoy it.
---
Nailed it.
---
I do a novice and standard raid every day with a faster fire 50 cal.  3 gunsmith.  I don‚Äôt need repair kits.  There‚Äôs several weapons benches in the vault as well.
---
The agricultural center is where I farm robots. They're all very low level so a quick run through Fertile Soil can net 40+.
---
Neat!
---
Disagree strongly :) been in it for about 6 weeks. Explosive gat plasma will lag everyone nearby very badly, tse minigun too, it's just discourteous lol. Shotguns destroy, cuz every pellet gets the +50 acid damage, but in general anything with fast fire rate (rifles or heavy), especially anything anti armor. If lag bad, use non explosive weapon. Shoot anything a few times then stop and just watch the health keep falling. Tenderizer perk extends it. Vampire weapons keep healing you with the acid damage for looong time.
---
You‚Äôll get that on those big jobs!
---
Out of curiosity, did you watch the video? You realize there's a difference between having microtransactions, and having microtransactions that are being pushed as hard as they are on 76, right? Other developers have microtransactions in their games and people don't complain. Plus there's Bethesda promising cosmetic only microtransactions before launch, and then straight up changing their mind and not doing that, because money.
---
Also there's the issue of this being a full priced game at launch, with microtransactions. Hell, the microtransactions were available IN THE BETA. Not DLC. Not expansions. Microtransactions. Generally, microtransactions to this degree are seen in free to play games. Because how can you charge for more microtransactions on top of a full priced game? Not to mention the insanely high cost of so many of the microtransactions. Paint for your power armor is $18. That's insane. With the disaster of a launch this game had, and disaster of a first year, to be nickel and diming their customers to this magnitude while barely fixing the game, is incredibly scummy.
---
&gt;a free open source game like the monstrosity that is Fortnite.
---
You mean free-to-play.  Open source is something entirely different.
---
And I'd have to respectfully disagree.  One look at the mobile market tells you why.  I know MATN touches on this, but just to be clear, there is an undeniable incentive to cripple a game's mechanics if your business model relies on players buying a workaround.  Bethesda would have gone all-in on pay-to-win and never looked back, if that were the case.  You wouldn't be able to kill the Scorchbeast Queen or have Legendary gear without spending hundreds of dollars.
---
Instead, they inhabit this netherworld between cosmetics and "pay-for-convenience," in a game where you really don't need either, and that's about as far as I'd ever want to see them take it.
---
The story in 76 is kinda lame because everyone is dead. That said, I really enjoyed the voice work of the actress who played Abbie. Plus, the Brotherhood quest line was a lot of fun, did those after Free States. Belly of the Beast is a high point of the game.
---
No, simply because of your ability to return to adventure mode.
---
They've said its being added in a later update, i believe.
---
Workshops work the same as it would in public worlds, you get a certain number of free resources (represented in green). The only real difference is no one will attack you in your private world, else it it is the same. Just by design not really fair or unfair. And no it won't save if you leave just like it would in public worlds. The only exception I believe if you get disconnected and connect within 5 mins it should be the same world with the workshop intact.
---
The billboard is between Whitespring and The Top of the world on the right going north.
---
Give it a shot during the free trial.
---
Yeah also not bad but you have to server hop if you wanna do some more rounds. And they‚Äôre spread wildly apart from each other. I‚Äôve discovered that when you do it in the whitesprings building (destroying the mr handys only for the fists challenge) and you die, you‚Äôre getting respawned in seconds inside the building by the entrance. Meanwhile the robots just spawning in again. I get around 7 down before I die so it‚Äôs pretty efficient!
---
Btw, acid damage is similar but not quite the same as poison damage. Can't poison robots, but acid gets em good.
---
How hard are they being pushed? Are there pop up ads I‚Äôm missing or something?
---
Awesomesauce! Glad to hear that RNGebus was your wingman today
---
I seem to recall regularly getting jumped by one south of Abbie's bunker. Just follow the road.
---
Ty will try
---
It's just the universe telling you to start a Rolling Pin museum in your camp
---
I use an aa plasma rifle from time to time and haven‚Äôt had this issue during normal gameplay (last night was the latest). The only time I‚Äôve ever had the problem you describe was right before a server disconnect a couple weeks ago.
---
No problemo, probably plenty of videos around. I mostly just know from chatting with other players.
---
I do the same thing!  But you have way better photography skills.  Good work!
---
Like I said to the other guy, did you watch the video? Limited time items where you can not earn enough Atoms in-game to purchase them that creates a sense of urgency to buy Atoms to get said items before they're "vaulted." Just one example.
---
Also, there kind of are pop-up ads. Yea. What's the first thing that happens when you boot up the game? Well, after you sign in. It shows you what's new in the Atomic Shop. And also what items are leaving the shop soon. Literally the first thing you see. Yes there's also sometimes info about upcoming content and updates if you tab over, but that first screen, that pops up all by itself, is always Atomic Shop items.
---
Wait for the wastelanders DLC please... the game is good but the dev's are greedy and push atomic shop stuff wayyyy to much. But yeah, once wastelanders is out I would jump in man.
---
Edit: also lots of day 1 glitches
---
Explosive bait sounds like a weapon available without requiring modification of your current build. They can be a little tedious to make but are worth it.
---
Bro...you need to take a break. The fact that you have conjured up a conspiracy theory for a subreddit about a video game and managed to get yourself into such a negative space within that realm isn‚Äôt healthy. 
---
Take a break bro, you need it.
---
The Christmas bundle last year.  They introduced it under the guise of a discounted price, but it never actually sold at the non-discounted price.
---
They've never done it since, and corrected it the first time it happened, so one wonders if it was a genuine attempt to get-one-over on players, or a failure of communication behind-the-scenes.  They had a lot of those, you know. üòÇ
---
Older player here. Been playing since beta on PC. Would love to play on my nice living room setup, but I like PC too much. So I got a better chair and a much bigger monitor.
---
I think the game is much better. There's a LOT of little things I wish would be fixed, but it's nothing terribly annoying. Game breaking issues are much better, such as server stability. You can complete all the quests just fine. I have zero issues with the SBQ.
---
I've always been one to "try it for myself" if it ticks enough of my 'interest' boxes rather than rely on other people's (that I don't know) opinion. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's not perfect and it's a little frustrating why Bethesda let's the little things slide like they do, but it's more than playable with lots of things to do.
---
&gt;The mods clearly hate anything that speaks up against their Bethesda overlords, that's all.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;They even employed shills and bots to upvote their dumbass lie and downvote my comment, lol.
---
Man.
---
This takes me back to 2016.
---
I remember how we used to joke about all that sweet shill checks we cashed every month.
---
Shotguns and Enforcer Perk.
---
i do quite often, i think its people that are either crashing mid silo or they are mainframe core farming.
---
as far as robo's go, when you run solo the spawn is massively reduced.
---
Think of ‚Äòprivate worlds‚Äô as a shared desktop terminal.  When your using it, it is yours exclusively.  When you leave for over 25 minutes the client is then passed on to the next Fallout 1st user requesting a world.  
---
When you login again, if 25+ minutes have passed; assume you will get a new world.  I have personally had occurrences where I will get a new world regardless of time away from the client, at about 15 minutes.
---
Thanks I'll do that, found her bunker today actually.
---
Didn't know that either, thanks!
---
They're coming...
---
Will give it a try üëç
---
yeah lol i had no clue how to spell it and didnt fully remember
---
Yes.  It depends on world traffic.  If your on a public server and experience this, usually someone before you has destroyed them all.  
---
Regardless of circumstances, you are not alone.
---
Fo76 is filled with people who have so much time, they can explore a virtual nuclear simulation, to make observations about the TP roll, on the internet.    
---
   
---
Oh boy.
---
i think there is supposed to be an event that used them to lure down a scorch beast and kill it, but i have not see it in forever
---
It's for level 50+...
---
i had a hard time getting the wendigo to wear the clown suit
---
Ever used a Stimpak diffuser while your in the Whitesprings Enclave bunker? Spoiler : Don't do it.
---
Yes, the Free States questline was odd. Abbie was great, but at the end I was left thinking "Why did I do all this stuff when it doesn't matter?"
---
I really wish Sam Blackwell's character would have been fleshed out a little better and have more impact with respect to the Enclave questline. Speaking of which, I thought the Enclave questline should have been fleshed out better rather than "do all this for me and I'll let you into my club." Might be something to follow up on in a future update.
---
He's a nice guy and makes some good videos  But as far as the Atom Ship in general?  
---
Gonna get \*\*\*\* on for this, but, really?
---
This is how games are.  Not all of them, but lots of them.  They all eventually become Pay-2-win, they all involve microtransactions.  The moment it became possible to spend real  world money in a cosmetic store ,you all had to know this was coming, right?  
---
You can't have Fortnite all the time.
---
I've been gaming since the PONG machines in roadside cafes in the 70s.  Nothing surprises me any more.
---
Yup to the right when facing away from the door
---
It's a feature....
---
I think they'll make do without a couple angry redditors money
---
Unplayable.
---
&gt;Improved repair kits doesn't, in any fucking way, excuse paid repair kits.
---
Says who?  Drackar39 on Reddit?
---
I thought we were all okay with the whole "Earn Atoms just playing the game" idea.  It's the same deal.  You can earn tons of Repair Kits just showing up to endgame battles.  Even my alt has worked her way up to having 120 of them, from the SBQ, Encryptid, and killing Scorchbeasts in general.
---
And yes, I guess you could reach Lv. 86 and call it the endgame.  This is a generally easy game.  But the real endgame is about improving your character.  MATN never did a silo by himself.  He has very little Legendary equipment.  I'm sure if damage numbers were around when he fought the SBQ, we'd see a spray of 1s from his shotgun.  He struggled in the Vault Raid as a result of having inadequate equipment, then suggested it a conspiracy to sell more repair kits.  I doubt he understands the workings of a Bloodied build or a Junkie's one.
---
I don't dismiss what he has to say, because his general knowledge of Fallout is great, but I interpret this thoughts on 76's mechanics with a grain of salt because on that subject, I have a lot more experience than he does.
---
Good directions, thanks again, should be fun.
---
I've seen quite a few cats spawned around the wasteland. They're all only ever lvl 1 so yeah they drop dead pretty quickly. They respawn tho. Guaranteed, you will see murgle again.
---
So that's it, when it says no weapons equipped that also includes grenades/mines.
---
Play for free next weekend, what do you have to lose? It‚Äôs a pretty fun game. Not overly complicated by any means but map is massive and fun to explore.
---
Yeah this bug came with the collectron fix to them not despawning when players left a server. Mine also wanders around in the ground now too
---
Maybe it's time to start a new character?
---
I'm the same way with Bethesda games.  If I stay away from them for long enough, it's difficult to jump back in and remember what the heck I was doing.
---
Sounds like a 1ster.
---
Oh wow we got some screenshots. THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH BETHESDA OMG YOU PUT SO MUCH WORK INTO FIXING THIS GAME THAT HAS AN AMAZING COMMUNITY BEHIND IT THAT YOU KEEP FUCKING. Wastelanders screenshots probably took them about 5 fucking seconds dude. Anthem is probably getting a full fucking relaunch, where's the real content for 76?
---
Sorry i should have stated this but i have started a new character, 2 times actually but i still burn out
---
There is, ‚ÄúIts a trap‚Äù. But ya, it doesnt pop up very often compared to others.
---
I have a BUNCH of gripes with the store. But i think limited items complaint is sort of shit. After the first month or 3 of seeing limited items come and go. You could take the initiative and save up atoms for some of those pop ups.  Not to mention people have been data mining pretty much everything that is going to come out before hand. Also bethesda gives you a spreadsheet of sale dates. Hell a bunch of it has rotated back into the store for a second chance. But that's like spending your paycheck on day one and complaining you cant afford anything the following week.   I can agree with most of what else you have said though.
---
How about if youhate the game so much leave
---
Let's say you take a Gauss Rifle and shoot the side of a building. That would not give you a hit indicator at all. THAT would be missing a shot.
---
Now let's say you shoot another player dead in the chest and you get a hit marker of 180 damage. This is NOT missing a shot. 
---
Now let's say you shoot another player dead in the chest and you get a hit marker of 0 damage. This is NOT missing a shot. You got a hit marker because you hit the target. The fact that it caused 0 damage is a bug.
---
Advantage over who? The scorched? The amount of scrap in my storage has no effect on your game at all other than the fact that it makes you bitter. This subscription is 'pay for convenience'. If they gave us free scrip every month or a free 3* legendary then I could see it being considered 'pay to win'.  In the case of FO1st 'pay to win' is just a label internet trolls throw around in an attempt to bash something they want but don't want to pay for.
---
I would agree with you, if Atoms were earnable in-game at an acceptable rate. But after a short amount of time, your Atom gain slows down significantly. At that point, even if you bust your ass in the game to earn Atoms, you'll still only get around 500 pee week. Which is pathetic.
---
BURN THE WITCH
---
&gt;A year later, and an upcoming free play, will I be less disappointed, still disappointed, or happy?
---
I mean, there's only one way to find out for sure, right?
---
I'll be turning 40 in a couple years, and I've found that my general tastes in games have skewed away from hardcore action games and more toward experiences where I can sit there and endlessly tinker with things.  Games like Cities: Skylines, Skyrim, and The Sims 4 have constituted a large part of my gaming time for the past couple years for precisely that reason.  So, in a lot of ways, I was predisposed to like Fallout 76, which has a generally chill atmosphere of endless tinkering.  I get why a lot of people don't, but bugs and microtransactions aside, this is almost my dream Fallout.  The Fallout where you can just "live" in the wasteland and do whatever you want.
---
I don't know if the player base for 76 actually skews older, but in past attempts to chronicle it, there have been a number of older players involved.  I think the botched launch had a lot to do with that, because you needed (and in some ways, still need) the pragmatism to look past the issues.
---
When did I say I hate the game? Don't assume, otherwise you end up making yourself look like a fool.
---
And even if I do hate the game, who says I don't hate it in its current state, but still want it to get better?
---
Just collect everything you find. Fort Defiance is great for ballistic fiber. Mine ore at Hornwright Testing Site #3 (there's some lead there too) and smelt it. As for acid, running the Whitesprings 'loop' will net you quite a bit (at least 16 boxes off the top of my head), while Toxic Larry's Meat &amp; Go nets 3 snallygasters which provide acid. Any cave cricket horde should be done. But the best way is to hit up player vendors and buy all of it. Lucky hole mine is great for Lead &amp; Crystal. Crystal is expensive to smelt (need a lot of acid), but can make you a lot of money if you need caps.
---
Everything is easy to find, however, acid is probably the most scarce component vs how much is needed, followed by aluminum.
---
The most disappointing thing for me about FO4 was not being able to kill Preston. Dude got on my nerves.
---
When I gooify an enemy, the goo pile falls with the momentum of the kill. I used to try and loot from that pile, but then realized the actual goo pile ends up back where the enemy died. Just want to make sure thats not what youre doing.
---
Hey I‚Äôm pretty new, don‚Äôt worry about the level a friend just speed leveled me to 125, but I swear I‚Äôm new. It‚Äôs not like I have beat the entire story And have multiple heavy god roles I swear
---
I think you mean backwards.  Upside down would be a gravitational phenomena.
---
If you're Bloodied, you can make do with a basic Bloodied 10mm or Pipe weapon.  As others have said, shotguns combined with the Enforcer perk will easily cripple their wings and force them to come down, but then you have to lug around a heavy shotgun... and you're not going to find shotguns that useful if you're already melee.
---
You can also look into just avoiding them using stealth.  That's how I do it most of the time now.  The ammo and time expenditure often isn't worth it, and the game has a nasty habit lately of spawning Scorchbeast *swarms* rather than individuals, which only multiplies that problem.
---
No, there's really not. Neither way is right OR wrong.
---
Same thing happened to me but with a different user. I never trust 0 cap trade offs anymore
---
There is almost always one in fort defiance. I can always hear it breathing, but it doesnt always come out of wherever its hiding. 
---
Or downstairs at the whitespring clubhouse in the locker room.
---
The good news is, they're going to have to give us workshop persistence or face a lawsuit and/or an FTC complaint that I will file myself! The better news is, they've already explicitly promised exactly this!
---
"Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We‚Äôve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we‚Äôre excited to add to private worlds in the future."
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
I take the toilet paper and turn it around before I leave, no matter where i am, even at my friend‚Äôs house 
---
My friend‚Äôs aunt asked me why I do it. 
---
I told her it‚Äôs easier to swipe hand downward instead of upward
---
I don't really think it was meant to drum up hate (though, it's very foreseeable how it would/is) since around the end, he makes the conclusion that perhaps with the release of Fallout 1st that they could ease up on the monetization practices in the future since subscriptions are significantly more reliable than item shops.
---
The repair kits were never targeted at the long term players. Hell in a week i can earn enough repair kits to last me months. Even without it i kept 200 of every resource at my base and have a hard time not falling over resources i need because i can identify them. For me the idea is the new guy gets a bunch of atoms and spends it on the kits. Ballistic fiber was a unicorn for me when i started. I could barely keep up with repair costs. Dumping that atom cash to save time from server hoping a not picked clean camp mcclintock to repair a piece or 2 would have been a no brainer. Then later on when you get into it and want some unique items to knock the bland out of your system youd be more willing to dump a few bucks for a few skins.
---
You're really not in a position to do the silos.
---
A silo is going to be really hard at Lv. 40 unless you've got a great build, and you're likely not going to have one because some of the most useful perks don't unlock until the 40s, let alone the max level weapons and armor.
---
Thanks for the link dawg
---
i am sry,... i would but im in PC -.- \*but i feel with u,.. had have the same prob by my first try \^\^But now it is easy as F\*'√Ñk, cuz only the roach is spoiling fast.Don't try to collect all parts in a row,...u can go hunting for themtick blood sac  ,  bloadfly gland ,  Bloodbug proboscis and the  Stingwing barbone after the other. there is no need to hury anymore ;)    the tick , radroach and Bloodbug ar mostly near Treadly's location.at all loca's u can fasttravel. it cost some u caps and a maximum of 4-5min to complete!\*sry i forgot: how do u die by stingw's  at LvL 90 ?\^\^    no offense ;)
---
This right here. Whenever you‚Äôre planning on taking down a scorchbeast, just put on Enforcer and whip out any old shotgun. Don‚Äôt worry about swapping into the shotgunner damage perks or using a max-level weapon because the damage is irrelevant‚Äîyou‚Äôre just trying to cripple the wings. And since damage is totally useless, I‚Äôd recommend either a Vampire ‚Äòs or Suppressor‚Äôs shotgun for added utility.
---
Vampire‚Äôs will obviously help keep your health topped-up while you wait for your quarry to land. Or, perhaps you‚Äôre a Bloodied build or just want to lessen the damage you receive, the Suppressor‚Äôs is nice to have.
---
If you get a railway rifle with a decent legendary effect, put a prime receiver on it. If you scavenge every kill you make you will never run out of ammo. 
---
I take my TSE on queen fights and it never lets me down and I can run full health.
---
Agreed, on several solo runs sometimes I‚Äôll get 2 or 3 robots (max) spawn while defending the launch chiefs. As for turrets I usually chalk it up to people getting dc‚Äôd at some point during a run.
---
Beth devs seem the type to hang their TP the wrong way.
---
For stingwings, hit up Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse.  Bloatflies, New River Gorge resort.  Tick blood sacks, Moonshiners shack.  Blood bugs, I just go where the marker leads you or Aaronholdt Homestead.  Radroach, Aaronholdt or in the locked room at Dolly Sods.  Also, the parts don't spoil, hope this helps.
---
If its any consolation, I didnt finish that one until about L150,,,, (PS4)
---
Vampire weapons, healing factor, and PA helps
---
There‚Äôs alos some anti poison armor...
---
My mate's get 3*s all the time and you sound like  me , hard not to feel envious lol
---
Ya i think at Alpha is the easyest way to launch a Nuke MOSTLY no turrets  
---
and a 69'er ore higher enemy spawn is very rare too..  good for us, so nuke them all !!! ;)
---
not envious just annoyed . the only time i get a guaranteed 3* is the queen aha
---
Yeah, it's one of the dumber mechanics.
---
Sounds like you need to find people to play with, then.
---
Never argued that. I hate the rate of which they trickle out. Not to mention that huge stint of months worth of shit quests where i stopped doing them entirely. Bugs that autocomplete some but give no rewards. Id say 99% of my atoms spent are on building related items. That to me is the worst of it all. Most of the cool unique things introduced to the game aren't skins but unique build items. All of them locked behind large prices and included into some bundles with crap i have no interest in. Hell look at the halloween event. They tossed us a bone with the mislabled pumpkins already rehashed from the game. Then charged 800 atoms for black paint(couldnt bother to theme it) and orange turrets. 2 other bundles with unique assets for essentially 25 bucks plus more. I get the argument that it pays for the content. But boy was it a circus. Console players crashed. The pc crowd even had severe lag. It practically broke the game for a week...for pumpkins.  But i do save my pennies for a rainy weekend like this coming christmas update.
---
While I've enjoyed my time with the game, I'd recommend waiting the 1-3 months for Wastelanders to drop.
---
Ugh cities skylines.  Love that game. I guess getting older, as you said, your tastes ‚Äúimprove‚Äù
---
Can't argue those points. I agree.
---
I'm on the magazine and bobble head grind myself. I'm almost done with the bobbles I just need a small guns one
---
It's also been bugged for a bit now, where it'll either not lure anything, or somehow pull a Scorchbeast outside its effect zone. You'll see the beast landed, and unable to fly, but if you go to engage you wind up leaving the radius and don't get the quest credit.  
---
Still, good for meat at least.
---
Try a good game
---
The AWOL event at the RobCo building always has the chance of at least one 3\* legendary, plus even when there's no event there are sometimes 3\* ghouls or supermutants closeby too. There's also a random encounter further up the road past the General's Steakhouse that usually has a 6-8 supermutants/scorched fighting a sheepsquatch or anglers/gulpers, and a chance one of these is a 3\* legendary too.
---
Bloodied Unarmed. Stealth is highly recommended.
---
While the meat hook is the "ideal" weapon (until it gets patched, IF it gets patched), it doesn't provide that much of a boost when you can already one-shot 99% of the enemies in the game. Extreme damage is not a result of the meat hook, it's the result of chems, food, &amp; alcohol.
---
Come on man, not everythings perfect but no need to be like that
---
They‚Äôre still screwing up a lot. Just look at having to pay 1000 points in 4 for a damn creative mode. And for kicks look at how the only way to get Rage 2 dlc is to buy Bethesda funbucks (for well over what you‚Äôre actually getting) and then buy it from the in game store. Makes it impossible to properly refund or review said dlc
---
When I got my DCG (same attributes that you want) I think it cost me a TSE .50 cal and like 15k caps. Hard to find anyone selling them, and very pricey when you do.
---
Launching nukes is a joke lol u is a noob little bit no worries you‚Äôll get there
---
We're only giving out level 1 to 5 weapons. When we see Vault 76 suits walking our way, we're pretty sure they're new!
---
This is a buddy of mine. They're definitely real. His legacy collection is absolutely absurd. Then you should see all the god rolls he has on his mule. Blows my mind....
---
&gt; I think you're making some assumptions in your investigation, which will lead you to make and miss connections and skew your results. 
---
Always a possibility, I appreciate you raising it.
---
&gt; Assume that the Interloper followers, the Cult of the Mothman, the Cryptid Hunters, and the Alien conspiracy theorists are 4 separate groups. 
---
Oh, sure, but for the sake of this the game seems to treat the Cultist sites as being branches of the same root. For the sake of finding 'sites' it's so far been mostly a case of the limited assets making them generally look similar.
---
&gt; There's no need to assume any hostility between the Responders and the Cult of the Mothman. 
---
I can see what you are saying but will have to disagree. The alter is decorated with human bones and every single major cultist site is full of corpses and/or even scenes of sacrifice. I suspect even the Responders might be a bit squeamish helping active murderers do their thing (remember, the raiders weren't raiders in truth until the Responders turned them away, and after that all bets were off) since they are one third/half police officers who still arrest criminals.
---
&gt; I've come across several sites - the common items linking them is a chalk drawing of a turtle, the giant metal heads, crystal deposits, and those tree artifacts. 
---
I don't suppose you recall where by chance? If you are talking about the 'head' in Tanagra Town I know that one, but over all, I'm running a little dry at the moment.
---
You must be quite the charmer at dinner parties.
---
I have a BSS RW meat hook trade only
---
I use the weapon displays to hold pool cues for my pool room.
---
I love the game and have played for nearly its entirety but im well aware of the first 3 months and the constant uphill battle to get any new content or end game. Im running raids and making trades. But im certainly well aware when the scorchbeast raised into the sky at 10% health and flew off to greener pasture in narnia  as we watched the clock count down was well beyond acceptable. No ones screaming all hail todd...except me next time...thanks for that idea. Nor 30+ second delays in vault 96 on public servers but when we load into private its runs smoother than a new set of tires. Things need fixing and without any pushback wed just be sitting on a ea 2k sport  clone.
---
Should be easy to find at a player vendor. The melee bobble is the rarest as far as I know.
---
I laughed before reading ur apology sentence
---
Doing things right? What things?
---
Literally uncat
---
edit: I heard a cat person once say they have to hang the toilet paper backwards like this or else their cat wrecks the whole roll
---
That‚Äôs it but u can make a shotgun out of the plasma rifle, laser rifle, and harpoon gun
---
There's also pump action... and flechette harpoon gun!
---
Nice
---
Guess they didn't teach manners with that mathmatics degree. They didn't with my nursing degree either so don't feel bad. 
---
2,000 people on at any given time of this sub Reddit. 
---
If 5-10% hated the game, we'd see 100-200 hated filled posts. (Ironically, I see the same people post hate filled content over and over, not new people hating on the game).
---
If 5-10% loved the game, we'd see 100-200 love filled posts. (Same with hate, most die hard love people post over and over, not new ones)
---
If 80% of people just dont care, we'd see 1600 people just not caring. (This number is a lot higher than 1600, most people just don't care)
---
These are the numbers I see, so wouldn't that be the mean falling on neutral? Most people dont care, but the extremists (good and bad) talk the most.
---
Yeah i had forgotten to type pump fpr a sec lol
---
That's funny because I've found like 3 melee ones by now lol. I've been running perceptibobble and exploring
---
Same for me today
---
If you pull the whole clubhouse you can (assuming you have marsupial) jump onto the building beside the tennis court and they should mill around, toss grenades and watch the bodies fly.
---
I'm giving away free bullets, if you can catch them.
---
Expansion?
---
Whatever happened to ‚ÄúOne more tomorrow?‚Äù  That was my favorite and the instrumental piece in it was beautiful.  I think they removed it from fallout76 if they ever had it to begin with.
---
I ran into 3 in the Wendigo Cave this afternoon. Not the first time either.
---
Yeah, it's basically the missing half of the game. We get NPCs! Companions! Dialogue! Role playing in our role playing game!
---
As a bit of a different approach, I use a bloodied LMG. The ROF shreds even lvl 80 scorched beasts and I always have plenty of resources to craft ammo. Use escape artist to quickly crouch and enter stealth then light them up. Even with the base stealth buff it melts their health.
---
If its a 3* enemy it should be a guaranteed 2* at least
---
I've always suspected she might actually have survived, 'failed' her mission, and something along the way stopped her from returning. I always go by the tried and true rule of 'did you see the body?' from movies with games. 
---
In fact, there is generally one or two people from each faction that either disappear or we never hear/see die. Grant goes out to 'die' but I don't believe we ever find a body, and that one member of the Taggerdy's Thunder disappeared on a patrol if I recall right. Abbie goes off to do her mission; she clearly doesn't succeed but she is also never mentioned by Rose or found elsewhere as a named body. Melody Larkin's body is notably missing from Big Bend Tunnel. Now they might all be dead and they just didn't feel like adding the bodies, or they 'joined' the generic scorched we kill, but it's an open foor for these characters to actually be alive after all if Bethesda ever wants them to be.
---
I've been playing about 300 hours. Never got anything on the Atom Shop but I like doing the challenges, so in that time I've earned 4700 Atoms... My point is, prices are a little high, but they give you plenty of ways to reduce those costs with the daily, weekly and general challenges.
---
not even more or less difficult but some bother me more and other less .  
---
i would say Alpha is the easyest- then Charlie- and at last, and for me most anoyingis Bravo. there are not much turrets but they always in the most anoing spots.so they very often "like pain in the ass" for me \^\^  
---
\*long story short :  A - C - B \*
---
Same. I sell as many as I can craft for 40c per to friends.
---
Idk why they bothered make junk weapons legendary.
---
My buddy plays it often and he's almost 50 ;)
---
Dumb reddit must be broken because I read  [AnthonyMiqo](https://www.reddit.com/user/AnthonyMiqo/) comment but I don't see anywhere saying he hates the game [zerotheliger](https://www.reddit.com/user/zerotheliger/). Mind pasting where he says it?
---
No against the cabinet or wall is wrong.  Walls and cabinets are notoriously lined with vomit, feces and urine (Plus residue from dust and dander. )
---
Combat armor is a free states thing.  There is a vendor bot in whitesprings resort and one in harpers ferry if you want to try buying it.  
---
You can also scrap combat armor pieces for a chance to unlock mods.
---
Gotcha. Thank you.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

I would love to do stuff like this, but I need all the storage I have.

There's a reason we don't store a toothbrush in the toilet bowl and keep tp away from the wall.

They should bloody well drop what the stars say and if that means less three star enemies so be it.
---
Take over workshops and defend them
---
There are a total of zero guaranteed three star drops in the game. All chance.
---
Snack bar.
---
I don't understand the point of marking an enemy 3 stars if it doesnt drop 3 star loot...?
---
Where would I even get display cases
---
exactly!
---
You get generator plans from powering up the nuke plants or buy them from vendors.
---
When I started out, after gathering a reasonable amount of caps, camp vendors. But give yourself a cap limit because some folks overcharge, imo, on basic camp plans. Travel around to get an idea of what people charge, and decide from there. Also vendor bots once you have the bargaining perk.
---
It's a trap...
---
Tried search bar, only found some nukashine
---
LethalScientist if you keep up this attitude they won't give you the next free icon. Also while your in the atom shop to get the free icon maybe pick up a few more skins.
---
Trap bar?
---
Well now you can not only kill him, but kill his grandfather and stop him from ever being born
---
Taking/defending workshops gets you camp plans. You can buy them from robot vendors as well. You will get a different power supply plan every time you do a 'Powering up' event for one of the power plants. You can also find some camp plans in the various overseer stashes too like the industrial water purifier at Camp McClintock.
---
I completely agree! I‚Äôd also like buses, broken down cars, things along those lines.
---
While this looks amazing, if they added it into 76, it‚Äôd lose what makes it special, which would be the difficulty it was to make. On top of that I‚Äôm assuming it would be horrible in the 76 build menu, constantly forcing you to go outside and rug glitch stuff into your trailer home.
---
Pretty much this. I tend to stock up on each of these items. I get my bloodwing probs and sometimes bloatfly glands when I go grab my cranberries at Aaronholt. Also scan meatbags when in Super Mutant territory. The Stingwing barb is the hardest to come by, however. Make a habit of going to Bleeding Kate‚Äôs whenever you log in and you‚Äôll get at least one (barring extra bad RNG). Then hit that spot again before you log off.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to get killed doing this as all of the parts can be found in the Forest.
---
5\* on YELP from me.
---
Not too much has been added, but I‚Äôd say try and get into vault 94, find a group or even try it on novice solo, it‚Äôs a big learning curve-TOUGH, but it‚Äôs well worth the effort
---
I don't reccomend it. I tried getting into it a few times and just can't. It doesn't feel like a Fallout game and everything just seems dated and buggy to me.
---
We deserved the nukes
---
If you cant read between the lines and use stupid cop out arguments like this than im not debating you.
---
I‚Äôll give it a try
---
I've been getting most of my legendaries through events.  Since private servers came out, I've been loosely keeping track of my daily haul, and I typically net anywhere between 300-500 scrip a day.  I've had days where I max out my stash space with scrip fodder, and it's normally no higher than 400w.  I typically play about 3-4 hours a day, and all of that time is invested in acquiring scrip through one form or another.  If there's no chance of scrip or legendaries, I'm probably not interested.  It is my end game.
---
Daily quests will pay out scrip as a reward, minus Biv and the two Pioneer Scout quests.  The amount depends on location.  Dailies in the Forest pay out 3, while Cranberry Bog pays out 8.  It adds up if you make a habit of repeating dailies, and most can be done incredibly quickly.  The only two I dislike to any degree are Thrill of the Grill and Ecological Balance, just because they take longer, require you to bounce all over the map and don't pay out particularly well.  I do not miss Mire and Bog dailies.
---
Some servers spawn way more legendaries than others, so if you find a hot server, stay on it until you get booted or quit playing for the day.  I typically do a test at Harper's Ferry, since I'm usually there to make my 1400 caps anyways.  If I don't run into a legendary, I server hop.  Certain enemy types will be hotter than others on a given server.  Today, for example, I went mirelurk hunting because Highland Marsh had two legendaries while I was there for the Play Time daily.  (A three star king is probably the most damaging enemy outside of an event boss.  Good Lord.)  I checked around Grafton Lake, Lake Reynolds, Highland Marsh, Quarry X3, Cranberry Glade and Sunrise Field several times over four hours of play and did every Heart of the Swamp and Swarm of Suitors that popped up.  I walked away with about a dozen items just from mirelurks, including a pretty nice uny/end/weaponweight robot chest from the queen at Sunrise Field.
---
Legendary scorchbeasts make a couple previously tedious events an alright source for legendaries.  They seem to have a 50/50 chance of being legendary, but I haven't seen a scorchbeast with more than one star in a while.  I'm of the opinion that every little bit counts.
---
By far, horde bosses net me the most items.  They're always three star enemies, unless you get the rare instance where they aren't starred at all.  If that happens, move to another server.  I'll usually tag the boss and allow it to spawn more friends, but if I don't get an additional legendary in a couple waves, I just kill the boss and move on.  I've heard of people claiming to get dozens of legendaries this way, but it's certainly not the case after unstarred legendaries were removed.  If the boss is a scorched, mole miner or liberator, I just kill it immediately.  They almost never spawn in the wild with stars.
---
My favorite events for legendaries are AWOL Armaments, Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Guided Meditation, Scorched Earth, Encryptid, Leader of the Pack, Heart of the Swamp, Project Paradise, Line in the Sand, Surface to Air, Free Range, Irrational Fear and It's a Trap, in that order.  I typically don't do SBQ or Encryptid by myself, but I won't miss one if I see it appear on a public server.  Even if you fail Project Paradise, the boss is always three stars, and I never get through one without killing at least one legendary during the wave spawns or while clearing the biomes before starting.
---
If you're playing on a public server, please find a weak explosive weapon that you can use to get a little spritz of damage on a target.  I carry a suppressors/explosive/weightless auto pipe rifle just for this purpose.  It hits hard enough to count even if you just catch an enemy with the AoE explosion, but it won't kill a lvl 21 mole rat horde boss in one hit.  Sharing is caring.
---
Lastly, remember that it's not about luck.  If you put in the effort to continually and methodically acquire as many legendaries and gather as much scrip as you possibly can, the odds will inevitably bend to your tenacity.  Make your own luck.  If I can do it, anyone can.
---
Should see our skies of an afternoon on the East coast. Looks like a nuke went off due to the current intensity of bush fires. The smoke cloud makes the sky turn yellow/orange.

I have explained. its called L A G. now kindly go away. i will NOT repeat myself again to ignorant people. blocked. i mean shit. already explained it HOW many times now? its NOT a bug, its L A G.

What system u on cause im looking for that fireman outfit
---
Even giants bleed and will back off when they start to feel the pinch, example Elder Scrolls Blades. They removed the wait timers for chests.
---
How do I make sure I have all that before level 50

Charleston landfill has three junk piles you can put extractors on and you can build a collectron if you have it to get four junk sources going at once there. Then play the game as usual collecting and scrapping whatever you find. Whenever the defend the landfill event comes up go back there kick the crap out of whatever is attacking scrap all their weapons and armor, clear out all your junk collectors and then go back about your business. Get the scrapper perk as well, it makes a pretty sizable difference in the amount of stuff you get when scrapping weapons and armor.
---
Combat Armour is a BoS thing. That's why the BoS mod for it does so much. Both Phoenix and the Train Station vendor in Watoga carry that stuff.
---
I got mine 48 hours later no ticket
---
It‚Äôs for the new holiday event but it hasn‚Äôt yet started... sooooo is guess dev room. Look at the most recent inside the vault article for more info
---
So without any evidence whatsoever, your argument is that:
---
1) The problem is lag that causes a shot to miss, but the shot that missed also registered as a hit (meaning it didn't miss)
---
2) Even though lag would be common and should happen with all weapons it somehow only happens with the Gauss Rifle.
---
That's your unsubstantiated opinion? You're an idiot. Go get some evidence otherwise stop running your mouth with guesswork.
---
the purveyor after you have learned the plan for it
---
Where is this spreadsheet you speak of? I've never seen it.
---
It usually appears when you enter his room inside the cave and make noise like gunshots, grenades, etc. - always works for me!
---
Morgantown high school. Watoga high school has a decent amount but Morgantown is crazy for plastic.
---
Scrap laser rifles with scrapper perk on. Super mutants drop regularly
---
How do you learn the plan?
---
Responders in grafton has BOS paint for combat armor, as well as other mods, Harpers Ferry, Watoga and some whitesprings vendors have random combat armor plans. I server hopped grafton when I farmed most the plans for mods
---
You won't happen to know where I can farm the light machine gun/find plans and farm deathclew/plan?
---
One Badge away from getting the normal bag..  Once again thank you for help
---
Oh thank you. Guess that's why he was dropping camp to camp. Thank you
---
You get it as a v rare drop in the Encryptid event. I sold several before my group stopped playing for various reasons. I would buy keycards at stacks of 15-30 at a time and we would use them all the following week, then sell any Fixer plans to buy the next round. It was good fun, need to start doing it again
---
While I agree that this is unacceptable, is it really a surprise at this point? This is at least the third thread like this I've seen in the last week, and this is more or less par for the course thus far for 76 in general.
---
It‚Äôs even having an effect on the weather here in NZ apparently. Stay safe, hope some of our rains here makes it to you
---
Saved your comment, thank you friend!
---
Ah damn I really need to dig up my old copy paste message. Hurm... I'll do it later. It depends on when you left OP, the Purveyor was before vault raids I think?
---
Its asked everyday. I dont believe you.
---
Basic plans should be cheap. I sell most of my plans for 5 caps or less. If it's something that's harder to come by,  maybe 100 max.
---
Aside from a (very) few bug fixes and even fewer added quests, same as launch. That said, Wastelanders, the expansion that adds NPCs and player dialogue is dropping in 1-3 months, so that'll be a massive change.
---
Yeah man üëçüèª I mean, maybe he was a Bethesda employee who has access to these things already and he‚Äôs just sort of spreading Goodwill‚Ä¶ But that would likely still be against the rules and be a rogue employee I don‚Äôt really know but yeah if you read inside the vault new event has those plans dropping.
---
Actually inside the vault explains the event but an earlier data mine details the rewards of the event many of which being currently in accessible mounted plans
---
Oh ok , best of luck trying to get people to do the event though , I haven‚Äôt seen it be completed in ages
---
It‚Äôs called a joke, you know a bar
---
Scrap box, the ultimate feature to make this game complete. Imagine going back to your base and just dropping your junk off instead of playing resource management system and determine what needs to be deleted.
---
That's me in the last one! :D Good selections! I love taking photos in this game too. It's visually awesome.
---
Had some one drop me a list and yea just the raids have been added
---
Also the cat house not far from the Morgantown school.
---
Your subscription does get renewed 2 days before it runs out i think so theres a bit of overlap, this might be what you're seeing
---
It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôll pop on this reddit once and awhile and all I see are people complaining about the same stuff from post launch, but definitely excited for the wastelanders dlc, just was hoping there was enough new stuff to keep me busy till then
---
They're... Alright content, it depends on how you feel about nuke Silos because a lot of those objectives are similar
---
Super mutants from West Tek and Huntersville. Their laser rifles scrapped with Scrapper net 10 plaster per rifle.

That‚Äôs good to hear. I won‚Äôt speak down on those who decide to keep plans at the caps the game suggests, it‚Äôs just being aware there‚Äôs always another deal available, like yours! üëçüèΩ
---
I loved silos, granted I‚Äôm a glass cannon but solo wasn‚Äôt really that hard, I know my Armour was nerfed just before my leave
---
Oh it's harder than a silo, but that just ups enjoyment level for some people
---
So you're just wearing the one armor piece and nothing else?
---
Now my attention is grabbed
---
I don't think you can.
---
Live in California?
---
I would not pay that

Or, jump up on the awning in front, jump over the roof and onto the back awning.  Shoot them through the dining room windows.  You will have piles of dead Ghouls.  When all are dead go in the front door and loot them.
---
Xbox price mate. We have two different market prices on everything.
---
Ah, is it really that high? Regardless I dont think I would. Maybe for a BE with a good 3rd.
---
That handmade is ps4 only
---
Forget the Scorched. THIS is the real plague infesting Appalachia.
---
Yeah. On Xbox we have a common befr railway- it was a dupe but bffr would b more valuable in part cause of supply and demand but also just cause dps
---
I'm pretty sure there was a mod that changed the paper but I don't remember how it was in the first place.
---
Yea I get it. Thanks for the info. I dont keep up like I used to...obviously.
---
Lol ur good! Happy to talk shop it‚Äôs always fun
---
Oh also I‚Äôm on Xbox if you ever want to play
---
I got [this gun](https://imgur.com/BnhTkSX) the first time I completed Dead in the Water standard solo, fairly recently.  It took me a while, a lot of frustration and needing to step away from the keyboard, but I'd say the payoff was very generous and very lucky.
---
That raid on novice is actually quite good for legendaries.  It's quick and there's two guaranteed legendary bosses, with the box at the end being a guaranteed three star item.  Just watch out for the first legendary mirelurk king in the residential area, after you print out the codes.  It does an unholy amount of damage.  I bring a furious/explosive LMG and pop a psychobuff just for that creature.  I highly recommend Angry Turtle's walkthrough video if you're having trouble.
---
Just keep trying, give it everything you have, and seeing stuff like that pop up on your screen makes it all worthwhile.  It happens rarely, but once you have the item it's yours to keep.  I ground out 4000 scrip across four characters, plus Fixer plans for each to prepare for the Clean Appalachia Purveyor 50% off sale, and that work resulted in landing [this gun](https://imgur.com/tg2pP48) and [this one](https://imgur.com/b6rT95A).  Doing AWOL every time I see it paid off with [this meat hook](https://imgur.com/GG3S5Dd).
---
The stuff exists.  My luck is as good as yours.  I just roll the dice a lot.  Keep plugging away, because obviously I'm getting results from the work I put in.  I used to get crap, stepped up my game with focus on farming and hunting, and all of those weapons dropped within the past three months.
---
If you're on PC, I'd be more than happy to have a farming buddy.
---
Proof that synths are pre war
---
Turn on the search for plastic in crafting. Pick up everything you find with the spyglass. After an hour of exploring and killing, I came back with about a hundred plastic....
---
Oh I‚Äôm on Xbox :(, I‚Äôm always looking for farming buddies but they usually don‚Äôt stick around thru more than one session, that JE fixer looked nice and I‚Äôm trying to run a stealth commando build. Like I said I save your comment and I look forward to going thru it to hopefully rope as much dive as you do
---
Most of us, including me, are impulse buyers. I have surprised myself, this game has taught me that sometimes I can wait. Why? When I am happy with a game I like to reward myself and the creators. Not so happy and a little frustrated and then I tend to not reward the creators.
---
Still like the game enough to go along for the ride and see where it goes.
---
I have no idea. My guess is from level 3 locked safes in cranberry bog/savage divide and the mire.
---
I'm usually a lurker, but I do have something to say.. You're really trying to milk that karma aren't you? A lot of your posts could be said in the general chat of the subreddit's discord, this isn't even content, everything you have to say is in the title with no elaborative context, if it can be all said in the title then GENERALLY it's a rule of thumb that you don't need to make an entire post about it. You deleted a post today or yesterday saying something about being displeased about how you're not getting the same amount of 'attention' as a post you made that got all of your karma. Take it easy on the posting, by that I mean take it handy until you want to post something where you actually want other people's opinions, or to show something you yourself consider memorable.

Tbf Skyrim was more dumbed down than Oblivion it was mostly the quest markers and fast travel in OV the stat systems were mostly the same as MW but I'll freely admit I've spent more time in skirim just cuz of the additions it had dule weld Sprint better looking world ect I just don't get why they changed so much else same with fallout it had great gun play it's harder to play 3 or nv tho I wish it had kept player choice old perk system ect 
---
I'm fully in favor of adding new stuff but dislike removal of things no one complained about
---
I totally get adding new and I also get changing things for a more mass crowd so I kinda have mixed emotions
---
Workshops and events. Sometimes you can find a good deal at player vendors. Daily quests have a chance to drop plans too.
---
Best of luck to you.  Feel free to DM me if you ever have any questions or even just endure a string of bad luck and could use an encouraging word.  Last week I was landing almost exclusively one star items.  It happens, but you just have to move forward.  Peaks and valleys....Every dog has it's day....etc.
---
1. Crazy cat lady's house (cat bowls -just north of Bolton greens)
---
2. Helvetia (pool table full of balls)
---
3. Morgantown Highschool (plastic pumpkins in gym and all over the school, bowling pins, plastic plates, plastic knives &amp; forks in cafeteria, cafeteria trays, golf balls in gym)
---
4. AVR Medical Center (Cafeteria Trays mostly)
---
5. Plastic in Watoga HS.
---
6. Flatwoods area (plastic cutlery, bowls, trays by restaurant and cooking station area)
---
7. Whitespring (golf balls on mini golf course outside, inside from shopping baskets and other items like the nuka cola cup and straw or nuka cola cup pack in the theater area.
---
Plastic can also be scrapped aslong with acid from any coolant bottle (blue, red or red variants)
---
Well, there's the Pioneer Scout stuff, Sheepsquatch, and Nukashine in terms of content. There's also now brewing (part of Nukashine), backpacks (part of Pioneer Scouts), player vending (literally vending machines you can build in your CAMP and sell stuff out of), and the Purveyor, a Mole Miner NPC that let's you trade in legendary items you don't want in exchange for a random legendary item. You can google any of those for more details.
---
I'd be down, I've been thinking about doing a 2-3 car trailer park build for a minute, with scatterings of broken chairs and flamingos sprinkled about.
---
Oh! There's also the Vault 94 raids and the Barrows! Sorry, forgot about them.
---
Yea all that I‚Äôve played, minus the scouts part, probably gonna just wait till the wastelanders dlc drops
---
I'll FT to Watoga, and then hit the fissure sites. Usually a few 1* SB, maybe a 2*, and occasionally a 3*. But, in conjunction with West Tek and AWOL (and maybe a WS run), I'll take in 5-8 legendary items per server at least. Server hop maybe twice, and I've got enough to hit the Purveyor.
---
Watoga barely has any legendaries
---
EDIT: also please don‚Äôt hit murmugh
---
&gt;In my opinion Bethesda should have gone down the route of 76 being a free open source game like the monstrosity that is Fortnite.
---
How is Fortnite a monstrosity exactly? It's a well made game that is free to play and has a fair microtransaction model.
---
Watoga should have zero, but it does have easy access to the fissures.  ;)
---
A trailer complete with bed, sofa, and displays too.
---
I consider it to be RNGenius to just find a player vendor who charges reasonable prices for ALL the stuff I don't get on the drop tables.
---
There are other elements he simply does not understand and it's frustrating. For [instance](https://youtu.be/O5nhUXV4EiY) at the 1:01:10 mark, being in the main menu and seeing "waiting". The team leader can only start the game. They're all just waiting there for MATN to start it up.., for 5 mins. He simply doesn't understand the game. He complains about mechanics when he doesn't know how creating a group in the main menu works.
---
In the same video at 1:16:55 he doesn't understand the challenges mechanic/feature and proceeds to shit on Fo76 from his own lack of ignorance.
---
He wants to get those free fan points by shitting on fo76 because it's easy. It's sensational and disingenuous.
---
The only arguement for him would be the game industry now lacks instructional manuals.  Sure they're ingame, but it's not convenient. If someone's starting up a game, they're not going to check the instructions first. 
---
Another would be, as a YTer, he does need to diversify and can't be super deep in once particular video game for the health of his channel.  With that being said, he cannot be an ultimate authority on whether or not a video game is good. It's simply another person's opinion.
---
With all that, it's hard to listen to him criticize fo76 when he is ignorant of how fo76 works.
---
Railway rifles without explosive are garbage. They are bugged and don't get any bonus accuracy from the perk concentrated fire. If it's explosive it works normally. A BE railway is way more valuable than a BFFR for that reason
---
Care to explain how you think I‚Äôm being petty?
---
Jump over the wall after WS golf course when you finish a run, and check out the pool area. Usually a crown in the pool house, plus nuka cup stacks, singles, and cup with straw. A few plastic utensils as well.
---
To cap it (ha), usually between 2-5 nukas around, as well as 3-6 packaged foods.
---
I always check after a run, and at least get an extra crown and some snacks.
---
I don't doubt his niceness.  Just his ignorance of Fo76.
---
As far as game's becoming p2w, fo76 does not follow. Because it's not inherently competitive. There is no winning. So all it's simply paying for convenience.
---
And then the actual buying of items is left for the user. Nothing in the atom store is required to be purchased. The game can exist without spending any extra real world money.
---
I wouldn't say so, railway rifles are bugged because of the projectile type and they get no bonus accuracy from "concentrated fire" so they miss like crazy. Explosive railway rifles work normally so they are worth more.
---
Because to me personally, it's hard to accept criticism from someone who is ignorant on the game
---
Hell yes, was just having this conversation today with friends in game.  üá®üá¶
---
The repair kits are targeted at people who don't have _the time_ to do that. Not just new people.
---
Omg! Are you on PS4? I was just at your camp last night! My camp is downhill from here by the large power pylon.
---
It depends on what youre looking for.  Some things can be bought or found in the open world.  Some things are quest rewards.  
---
Check other players vending machines too
---
It‚Äôs not like it would be lore unfriendly that you could at least find other flags in game.
---
Much of the game takes place in America and from what I've seen,  Americans are very patriotic
---
If you purchased F1st via the launcher. You need to start the game via the launcher. Or if you purchased via the website you need to log into the website and again it should pop in.
---
Go away you silly Englishman. (if memory serves.)
---
This. Bethesda that note.
---
I know, and they‚Äôre welcome to be as patriotic as they want so long as players from other countries can be too.
---
I died
---
Sensible chuckle
---
Personally, patriotism to me is over rated.  Why would you have devotion towards people who you don't know on a piece of land?
---
Aw man, what happened to you out here in the waste? Used to be such a nice guy. Need a hug?
---
Nice.
---
Just need more psychotats make the molerats stop in my skull
---
No usually I wear more but when I took that all off and tried that armour piece it didn‚Äôt work!
---
The answer to number 4 is the Strange in Numbers perk. If you and a teammate are mutated, it makes your mutuations a lot stronger.

Incorrect. [This is how the actual patent for toilet paper displays.](https://patents.google.com/patent/US465588A/en)
---
Thank you. WOW you even gave explanations.  I'll have to save this, so I can read it again.
---
Chameleon only works if your weapon is drawn. Maybe you weren‚Äôt doing that?
---
Found a fusion core today!  Woot!
---
Enforcer and a Suppressor's shotgun with the hated 50% Limb Damage are very handy in this situation.
---
The worst is finding a cat, only for it to immediately be killed by a nearby enemy. And then the time loss from going into a blind rage and killing every enemy within a 1 mile radius.
---
Maybe they have cats.
---
I‚Äôve owned several cats during my life. Never once did they mess with the toilet paper. I‚Äôve always hung the toilet paper the correct way, [according to the patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US465588A/en), and the bathroom door was always open because that‚Äôs where the litter box was.
---
Within fallout 76 player vending machines I see bloodied railways with ffr modded for 8k caps and under 3k caps for unmodded. Fast travel and you will find the good stuff at players camps.
---
Vending outside of fallout 76 those 50k caps prices are a scam.
---
And the difference is?! And don‚Äôt try to explain that the paper rubs the wall cause you know you‚Äôre gonna wipe your A** with it, lol
---
You are aware that they are bugged.. Right? My qffr railway can woosh 30 shots in a row. It's absolutely awful without concentrated fire
---
I've been having a lot of luck in the Burrows under Harpers Ferry. One of the times I passed through, there were literally 2 3-star legendary ghouls standing beside each other at one point. It's also a good source of XP, since it's a ton of high-level ghouls. Would greatly recommend using a Vampire legendary though. Otherwise, you'll be in the market for stimpacks afterwards.
---
Maybe that's what killed him.
---
Wait what?! Just at work in the shiter and spinning that paper roll and yanking the hell out of it... down both ways. Why do you need to pull it upwards?!
---
Wrong. Vault raids have one every single time.
---
Should have been a roll of Duck tape. Then a little sign Bellow it saying " I want to play a game".

Explains how the guy died
---
Ranged bloodied commando vats crit sneak shadowed dense unyielding nopa. Its so much fun and i use be, aae, je, *ffr, handmades, combat rifles. Crafting ammo with excavator pa to get lead from lucky hole is easy. Prime modded rifles and crafting ultracite ammo is easier than ever.
---
This week December 12, 2019 is double xp weekend. Create a new character out of the vault and you can easily have both 1 mele build character and 1 ranged build character.
---
Go for both!
---
It will auto-blueprint what it considers structures, but if your CAMP is one large structure, you might experience problems rebuilding. In a recent move, the blueprint was created, and even showed up a placeable, but would never actually place. Ended up having to break the blueprint down and rebuild.
---
At least until they have Power Armor, then I think they'd be willing to wade on in.
---
Soap in a sock
---
Who knows, maybe we can get something like that in one of the new settlements.
---
Correct, Tesla benefits from Rifleman perks not shotgunner
---
I like this idea. There would be stalls for the players who have vendors open in camps. And maybe you could decorate it at the beginning of each session, like the workshops, to capture mire attention, or just for fun.
---
Oh my god! Amazing idea! Please,tell me that you are a pc player, i really want to come visit and take photos &lt;3
---
I would specialise as sneak/commando(*not* rifleman) using VATS criticals as the Fixer you have, along with maxing out Perception, Agility and Luck (each at 15) would give you a build where you wouldn't really need to use melee unless you get mobbed by an army of ghouls. A melee build wouldn't need Perception, and would be focused on Strength (along with Agility for sneak attacks). Mixing both limits your build. I would use:-
---
P: Tank Killer 3 / Concentrated Fire 3 / Commando perks 9
---
A: Action Boy 3 / Sneak 3 / Covert Operative 3 / Escape Artist / Adrenaline 1 / Gun Foo 1-2 /  + QoL perks
---
L: Starched Genes 2 / Class Freak 3 / **Four Leaf Clover 3** / **Critical Savvy 3** / Better Criticals 1-3 or Bloody Mess 1-3 (maybe with some QoL perks, or even Serendipity 1-3 for defence if you want to run adrenal reaction mutation and a bloodied-style build with 20% Health!)  
---
If you're using Unyielding armor to boost your stats so that you're *hidden* or *in caution* most of the time, aim for headshots and hold your critical attack button down when firing (to get crit attacks every 2-5 shots depending on your Luck stat, 27-30 is ideal, you can use food buffs to boost Luck by 3 points too) you should be able to kill pretty much anything apart from a sheepsquatch in a quick burst of shots as long as you have enough AP points left. 
---
Gun Foo swaps to your next target and gives you some bonus damage too (very useful for groups of enemies), Adrenaline 1 is good as it also increases damage per successive kill up to a maximum of 48% (30 secs period applies) without having to sacrifice more Perk points. 
---
You will use more ammo with an auto receiver on your Fixer but the amount of damage you'll get with the multiple VATS crits will blow you away. You can farm Lead to make bullets at Lucky Hole mine (about 300 lead ore per run in Excavator PA) and farm steel and gunpowder from supermutants when you need to restock your ammo. I hope this helps ;)
---
Havent had any issues with plasma goo piles. With my tesla though if I kill anything and it turns to ash its impossible to loot it
---
If you've got First, claiming nuke plant workshops is the way to go. My current build relies on power armor and ultracite fusion cores for my Vampires Prime Ultracite Gatling. Using ammosmith stretches out the ammo supply decently (2 fusion cores + violet = 3 ultracite fusion cores), but if I do a lot of scorched earth events, I have to rebuild my supply frequently.
---
the cats are synths
---
The chance for this event reward is 0.147% (1 in 6,800)
---
I'll def try checking them again. I can always find the plans for the ultracite laser gun and standard laser gatling there, just never the ultracite version of the gatling.
---
It's all subliminal, Riddler. Todd has the messages playing on all radios and juke boxes. "Buy. Buy. Buy. Obey the Todd"

I also felt awful when I read the journals of the ex-raiders who fled Thorpe's group after the Charlestown Dam, taking refuge and new life in the West Bend Tunnels, befriending the BoS contingent at East Bend, and then their realization the end was upon them when everyone in the BoS died.  It was like redemption had been so close, and then the chapter closed before their story had progressed.  
---
But the most depressing, most emotion-evoking (sadness and anger) was the Mistress of Mysteries plotline.  It's my favorite of the quests in all of 76.  But damn...  it's gut-wrenching to follow through the final end.  :-(
---
This bug has been around since launch, the railway rifle does not get the accuracy bonus from concentrated fire because of the projectile type. if it's explosive, it works fine. 
---
There is a different bug where if you fire a crit and keep firing, all the spikes the are midair before the crit lands will "count" as crits visually.
---
XB1 currently.
---
Actually they did drop in game as soon as the repair kits were released but at the time they only dropped from the sbq and maybe encryptid if that was around then.
---
Sorry, I only have it on ps4
---
Did the old bug cause stuff from your inventory to transfer into theirs? I still can't work out how my weapon ended up on a corpse. It normally gives you at least one 'are you sure' before you drop something favourited doesn't it?
---
Except that it would (roughly) be Preston's great great great great grandson, since Fallout 4 takes place about 180 years later than Fallout 76.
---
I think the location difference can reasonably be ignored, because, y'know... MacCready and Kellog.
---
Except the Rose part. This was the highlight in my opinion.
---
I don't think you understood what I was asking.
---
1. it gives you 140% weapon condition instead of 100%
---
2. AA should perform better because of her high armor
---
3. there is a perk that lets you repair weapons to 200% condition
---
4. be in a group and have "strange in numbers" equipped
---
Its not a visual glitch. I have many many railway rifles. Like I said, my quad ffr can miss 30 shots in a row. Even a Tse railway is more accurate than that
---
Listening to the overseers tapes in personal matters. Especially how she gave an engineer over her fianc√©, Evan, a position in the vault; believing it to be for the greater good. Then fast forward to the tape were she asks you to put a now scorched Evan down, quoting: ‚ÄúI already killed him once, I can‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù  üò≠

I actually did that quest just today. It's definitely up there on the list.
---
&gt; Mistress of Mysteries plotline
---
I really enjoyed this questline, especially if you read all the terminal entries in the mansion. One of my favorites of the game as well.
---
I like the burrows with an instigating meat hook.  I can usually funnel the hoards between the rails and deal with them individually.  And once one group is done, just hide for a minute and regen.  No stims necessary.
---
Order of mysteries.
---
Bro the whole quest is literally find tower and climb it and go to basement to get stuff and win. But I understand where you come from.
---
No.
---
Alright that‚Äôs annoying, thanks for informing me!
---
Yeah I one shorted the queen once easy as üôÑ
---
Logging in at level 180\~ and realizing there's nothing worthwhile to do almost each time...
---
You can buy the plan from player vendors from anywhere between 10k - 15k caps
---
Yeah, you can't get the UGL Plans from a Vendor.
---
About a week after traded for them I have the drop for me in Census Violence.
---
1. I have the plan, but I can't trade Caps for them as I'm at Max Caps
---
2. IF your GMT (or close) I can do MOST mods for you.

Since Canada is annexed then a Free States flag could be kind of a Canadian thing too. Not really in West Virginia, but further up north.

I had a dream I had a suit of power armor and I was just jumping off buildings having a great time. Then I woke up and was sad bc I realized I‚Äôll probably never have power armor
---
The happy anniversary holotape. Realizing those kids probably died too
---
Yeah, like I said, once I knew what to do it was quick.
---
But finding out this stuff was much more cryptic than it should have been...
---
No, I didn't. Haven't played in months. Switched over to RDO.
---
My  main 3 star deathclaw gauntlet disappearing from my inventory upon logging in last week and Zenimax Support letting me me know they didn't care.
---
Thanks for the clarification. Been a while for me
---
&gt;  they're going to have to give us workshop persistence or face a lawsuit and/or an FTC complaint that I will file myself!
---
lol good luck with that
---
Good luck with something I've already done more than once before?
---
This is how you protect your rights. You don't sit around making snarky comments. You get off your ass, man up, and do what needs to be done.
---
Don't need to.

NW, people are starting to really piss each other off lol

I didn‚Äôt even see a Chinese flag in the datamines of the upcoming Chinese bundle... So other countries will not be likely to have one

Set up shop near the golf shack, sell things.  Everytime someone pops in to see what you're selling they ghouls respawn.  Kill, rinse, repeat.
---
The Ella Ames holotypes are pretty sad.
---
Logging in 10 months after I've quit the game only to find out the game feels exactly the same way as it had when I left it.
---
The time I had to remove a game friend from the friends list... not because he wasn't friendly anymore, we had played together each day for a full month, but because he had in his friend list a guy I had blocked; and each time my friend joined me the other guy would appear on the server...
---
If i had a way to contact my game friend through chat or private message on Bethesda.Net I would tell him to remove the other bad player from his own list. But there is no way. I cannot explain that with emotes.
---
That is for me the saddest experience with the game.
---
Yeah, it's been pretty bad on PS4 the last few days.
---
so you have successfully sued and won a case against a multi million dollar company? i doubt it
---
Playing the game

Listening to the holotape of the woman locked in the closet of the airport as she recorded herself slowly starving to death. I actually cried. I need to find out who that actor is. She was amazing.

Same. But found a BOS rp group. Made a new character, I'm excited for the game again.
---
True value vs duped value. Duped weapons aren‚Äôt worth as much as legitimate weapons and I don‚Äôt want to over or under pay someone when I decide to go looking for one. Don‚Äôt be a dick.

We hold these truths to be self evident, that all AMERICANS are created equal!

I was thinking about that when I wrote that comment, and regretted sending it off almost immediately.  I did read a credible, peer-reviewed paper years ago that suggested a pseudo Monty Haul paradox of sorts regarding a statistical decrease in success after "hitting a jackpot" while gambling, which stuck in my brain enough to prompt my reply and loosely inform my approach to RNG.
---
In terms of odds of repeat success regarding event loot and Purveyor drops, I think you're absolutely right.  RNG seems to effect spawn rates in a strange way based on the server, but I've never gone to the Purveyor and had a streak of good or bad luck that fell outside tolerances of pure randomness.  I've rolled the exact same armor with the exact same effects twice in a row, but that's certainly within the realm of possibility.  I've had days where I've gotten five or more melee weapons with swing speed effects, but that doesn't really mean anything.
---
I'm too tired to track down an arcane paper I skimmed through over a decade ago that will undoubtedly go unread on a subreddit concerning a specific video game.  Lets just say that you're right and I was briefly under the spell of mild superstition.  A peer reviewed article is highly credible, not absolutely infallable.
---
If you live alone and have no guests and clean your cabinet/ wall from time to time then I guess it's okay (but not really) 
---
The amount of particulates that spray around in a bathroom is astounding so if you pee standing up, or have people that use they washroom that are not you, there is bound to get a lot more gunk on those surfaces then you'd expect.  
---
I was a rink supervisor for many years and washroom walls are something fierce.
---
And in the pic the toilet paper is drooping and touching the wall of the tp holder but also the wall of the cabin and if it happens to get unwound it will touch more wall.
---
Change toilet paper for hospitals and the like, you will quickly not face TP inward.
---
Suing is a last resort, when a company is completely unreasonable. However, off the top of my head, I threatened specific legal action against PayPal when they failed to comply with contract terms, federal law, state law and the terms of their license. They immediately reversed course on their previous refusal to cooperate. Since they had caused financial harm in their actions, I joined and received compensation through Zepeda v PayPal.
---
I haven't heard this one before. Where is the holotape located?

Rage quit

That injured super mutant gets me everytime...esp when he says "come back brothers, baa baa gone" :'(
---
I will have to disagree with you about the MOM. I'm sad for the mother and the other girls but the daughter acted like a selfish, spoilt brag and got what she deserved.
---
Well...it's a game. :) So just select the option you find the most fun.
---
Dyer chemical. On Duncan McKann is what the wiki says (so if it's wrong blame the wiki haha)
---
Oh yes this one. Yes I've listened to it. That quest was an interesting but sad one.
---
Huh, that sounds neat. Have fun man!
---
I would have quietly sobbed then went on a murder spree for thirty minutes in a straight line from the cats dead bodyüò§

I see your comment getting downvote, instead of them telling how they keep it interesting. This sub is like a Orwell book. You didn't tow the party line, now the thought police shall punish you with their downvotes.

The game
---
I got all of this plus urban mask after in one single Uranium Fever event with my new character at level 10. This was two days ago...
---
Well yeah, the cores from the frames aren't even 100 percent charged. Just saying it's a nice side effect of finding your armor pieces this way.  Fusion extractors are going to be better for sure.
---
I really liked the continuity of the story. In F3 I listened to the silver shroud, in F4 I pretended to be the silver shroud. And now I've learned about Mistress of Mysteries.

"  I wear a sheepsquatch fursuit " what has the waste done to you? You were one of the best the nation had to offer. 
---
I like the player icon idee. Bethesda take note.
---
They would needed to make each stall like a workshop. players come &amp; claim a stall. Then place down or already have a stash box so you access to your goods. Stock your machines. If you leave the stall for say more than ten minutes you lose ownership. This way others have a chance to sell as well.
---
Some one further down suggested player icon flags.
---
Honestly, this is just the same stuff every other microtransaction game does.  It's nothing new.  And I doubt the FO76 haters are going to be the ones to change the industry
---
Honestly I wish they got rid of quest markers all together, I feel like this game holds your hand more than it needs to
---
You don't absolutly need leather to complete this quest, you just need to craft one item from the armor workbench. So it can be a dress requiring fabric for instance.
---
I had to turn the voice audio off because this crap got super annoying.
---
Possibly, couldn't listen to that Holo a 2nd time...
---
I've been all around the U.S and never seen a foreign flag flying except a Canadian flag once. It just wouldn't make any sense.
---
I don't think this is the case because they said "NPCs will infest the map, not just a few key locations, and you will run into random encounters."
---
Would also be great as a skin next to other skins for the survival tent.
---
On release, when I loaded into the game and noticed it's pretty much a new Fallout 4 map with multiplayer slapped on top of it.
---
It's ok I got some morphine flavor ones
---
This could easily be implementable, the question is the nessecity. How many would take advantage of this, there are so many other implementations they could do that take priority.
---
They exist and I roam the map to wash and iron them all for you ! Don't thank me ^^ ^^
---
I like the depressing atmosphere of this game a lot. It is an important part of the game and makes it realistic. Same reason why I like the grayish overtone of the graphics. Vibrant colors like the Outer Worlds would destroy this game for me. The apocalypse is depressing, like it should be.
---
Acutally it's been one day. That's right, we've climed all the way to the rank of General, launched nukes, killed the queen, taken down a rogue imposter sheepsquatch Assaultron, completed old world experiments in Arktos Pharma, built and destroyed houses hundreds of times, cleaned out the sewers of Happers Fairy, restored three catastrophic failures in a vault we had never seen before, killed over 14,000,000 scorched, got drunk with a robobrain, gone on a photo frenzy because we found a dead person that happened to have a camera in their pocket, and much more all in less than 24 hours.
---
This. Melee has a lot of benefits but I don't like melee combat, so I have no melee characters.
---

---
Yeah it does u only have to make sure That one of u Hit the legendary ist extremely useful especially inspecific event with legendary at the end , But it doesnt work on the Level 100 Sheepsquatch from Projekt Paradise , Sheepsquatch imposter and SB Queen.
---
Wow, if only something like Market76 existed...
---
Nuka Shine should be a free one due to the fact that we've pretty much all done the quest line now
---
Once sold a TSE for 12000 caps. On PC. It was useless.
---
Something like this was mentioned and we got the vending machines it‚Äôs was a good step to the right direction. A addition would be a marketplace you mentioned and that we could sell items for less then a cap for example 308. ammo for 0.25. caps a piece. I‚Äôve got 5k+ stacks of any ammo types laying around and joined discord‚Äôs to trade them as fast as possible with this method sure i could sell them for 1 cap and make more profit but I really don‚Äôt care about money atm.
---
Obviously you don't understand a lot about the game. The queen has a flat 70% damage reduction before her armor is applied. She is a world boss so she is designed differently in general. Normal 3 star legendaries are no more difficult than 1 star legenedaries
---
Or wash that nurse dress with all the Abraxo you loot !

Works if you don't hit it however you have to be in a certain radius. Not sure exactly

The Appalchian branch of the Enclave was completely wiped out in the year 2086. 26 years before the Vault even opened. Now other branches of the Enclave could revisit the region but there is no communication between either the Oil Rig or Raven Rock, the main "hubs" of the Enclave. If any did it would be a small group at best.
---
Think it was a special event or atom shop purchase, but could be completely wrong.
---
300hours, 4700 atoms, many of which come from "one Time" challenge, like getting all mods for a weapon or scraping a given number of armors.
---
Those 4700 atoms aren't enough for three PA skins. 
---
Do you realize it's not just over priced, it's barely possible to buy even a tenth of the shop without playing full-time and spending hundreds of dollars?
---
Races. Not nationalities.
---
Could you maybe edit that info into your posting?
---
Money can buy everything in that shot lol.
---
But only from certain locations. They drop from more things now.
---
Potato tomato
---
But his ignorance of the game has nothing to do with the shop. Don't accept his criticism if he talks about game mechanics, that would make sense based on your issue with him. But his ability to play the game.has nothing to do with the shop. They're two completely different criticisms.
---
The games lore was built around the 90's headspace of Patriotism and Communism as a whole. It takes it to what is now a comical extreme at times because, well 90's American mentality.
---
MODUS is far from being shelved as a threat.  The Enclave I figure, doesn't get to where it is in the future without MODUS pulling the strings in the background.
---
Not sure what you mean fixed?? That was the fix!! Nobody asked for it but they fixed it. LOL

I mean, Curie.

Diluted rad is a third of radshiled efficiency, last only 10 mins instead of 15 mins, also radx isnt stackable in term of rad resistance

There are some ayomic shop ones but there is a basic lightbulb in the base game that allows you to change its color.
---
Fun Facts. 
---
1.) Even if you pay monthly you get 1650 atoms, $3.50 more in atoms than the subscription itself.
---
2.) If you pay for one year you get $198 in atoms for a $100 tag. $8.33 a month is more than reasonable.
---
3.) The Survival Tent gives you a third free fast travel point anywhere you'd place it. (All of mine are outside Camden for the token grind.)
---
The private server is a bonus. Honestly I'm a 1st member just because of the atoms.
---
Look, I'm in several PvP discord groups (not demon asylum, though), take a lot of workshops and fight almost daily; not once have I seen nor heard about targeted griefing with Strangler PA (and by griefing I mean targeted harrassment of non-pvp players). 
---
If it does indeed happen, it's an outlier problem when compared with many other bugs, exploits and glitches. There are people flying and oneshotting others in NW on PCs; infamous names with several accounts - and that *does* happen daily and with malicious intent.
---
You can use sneak at any level but you‚Äôll want to get covert operative and sneak from agility and the rifle cards from perception ASAP. Other perks like nerd rage, bloody mess etc are amazing but you won‚Äôt need them to begin with.
---
Make sure to be sneaking and have a suppressor on any ranges weapons you‚Äôll be using, otherwise only your first shot will be a sneak shot. If you‚Äôre on pc I can add a suppressor to any weapons you currently have that support it.
---
I've been griefed quite a bit. Often (violent) sexual stuff is said. I'm a girl, sadly that causes some immature types to run their mouths too. So I tend to avoid people &amp; don't have vending machines anymore
---
That isn't a bug exploit or glitch though that is straight up hacking.
---
Mele builds are some of the funnest things in nw and yes they are crazy op. The drawback is getting in range and hitting your target. 76 has terrible mele mechanics where you only hit a tiny single point as opposed to the weapon damaging anything in its path.
---
If you can't respond to someone after they offer a rebuttal to your comment, then why are you commenting at all?

---
Well said.
---
I'm not sure how the servers work, but if you're on PC I can craft you a Brotherhood recon rifle, should help out
---
Whenever I go to 76 I always go right to kill the Liberators and loot the ammo containers. I typically kill them with one punch. It's not a dedicated grind but everytime I'm in the area I'll chip away at the challenge.
---
It's going to be different for every player but it started working for me in my mid 20s and really took off in the 40s. You do need the perks and you definitely need a suppressor on that rifle. All the regular sneak perks of course, but I also found a few points in adrenaline are handy. You're trying to stack kills for added damage, and in order to do that well, you have to do it rather quickly. That all said, ghouls hear me coming a mile away, so the club house is usually a try to sneak in but fall back quickly thing for me, but I'm not totally min-max'ed and I don't run a bloody build.
---
Do people really struggle with acid? Never had any issue, its mostly screws for me...

I've also been using the stealth sniper build to devastating effect!! Scorchbeasts tremble before me! ü§£

Shit, that happens to me quite a bit. And I'm a dude that just happens to have a woman character.

It usually starts out with, "Damn, that armor set looks good on you!" And devolves from there.

How would it be his grandson if fallout 76 happens before fo4?
---
Oke, will check it out later
---
Idk what its called but its dingy lookn
---
Bloodied. Adrenal Reactions, Serendipity, Radicool, and Nerd rage. That's all you need. Pick your melee weapon of choice and you are noe an OP melee player. Bloodied weapons is just an added bonus.
---
Having my friend stop playing 76...it's lonely now.
---
Sure it does. 
---
Vault 76 was filled with the best and brightest humanity had to offer. Do you think that all the best and brightest would be American?
---
I'm american and I can tell you that's laughable 
---
Besides, the robot just inside the Vault door is saying good bye in multiple languages. Why would this be necessary if their wern't international residents?
---
As well you should.
---
That's absolutely horrid. I hope you're reporting those players. Really sucks that you gave up vending because of it.
---
&gt;My kind are repulsive assholes
---
I respectfully disagree :).

I don't buy into all this "toxic male" or "toxic white male" bigotry. I feel lucky to have been born into a Western country where I have equal rights. And I think for the most part blokes are are decent people

It's not as widespread as media stereotypes us to be. I know some VERY vocally unpatriotic americans.

New fallout game will be out by then.

I'm wandering near a nuclear plant that's near a nuke cola factory.  Have to check it out.

Seems like if I claim a workshop I get killed by a douche within seconds.

I was being melodramatic mostly. Frankly I've been harrassed by just as many females in my life.

But if you think that you hear some disgusting shit out of men, you should hear what they say about you to other men when they think it's only other disgusting assholes listening.
---
Yes, the radius is hard to describe but if you are doing Uranium fever and you are right by the panel that starts the extractors it reaches to extractor alpha and charlie but not bravo.
---
By 2021? You have Starfield and Elder Scrolls in line... Id say you wont see fallout until 2023-2024. My guess is 2020 early 2021 for Starfield, 2023 for Elder Scrolls
---
Yes, if you try to produce mass ammo, it will very quickly become the bottleneck
---
You havnt been looking as hard as you think than.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I am playing on PS4.
---
No its not you idiot
---
This is what I did. Just run around dense areas picking up everything, slap down a tent and scrap it all. It's way more efficient than workshops. You'll spend too much time defending them and the rewards aren't that great. Just be aware even after a month of scrapping everything you will still be running out of stuff pretty quick. Ballistic fiber and aluminum for example are pretty scarce unless you actively farm them. On the other hand it's nice not having to worry about steel, cloth, wood or glass taking up space in your stash.
---
Better
---
Been offline a bit.
---
I don't know how you can check directly from ps4.  There are a couple Web pages (fast.com is Netflix test) however Web on ps4 typically works bad for me.
---
Most of my serious testing was done from a PC or pulled off home networking hardware.  A quick one is to run a continuous ping (i.e. ping -t google.com) over your gaming period and check for lost packets or ping of +1k ms since not much can handle that anymore.
---
Fallout specific, expect nuked servers to eventually crash don't be afraid to swap instances if it's acting up.  They only get worse from what I've seen.  As for base, if it's not stupidly complex just move it a few feet, everything stored is returned to full health.  Personally I don't build near ranged spawns and tend to not bother with turrets anymore.
---
Frankly, reading your post I can just tell you that you need to work on your stealth techniques. And i don't mean the Stealth perks (though you should obviously use them)
---
I mean you need to use stuff like cover and shadows to conceal yourself. And ALWAYS keep your head on a swivel. You should be spotting everything before it sees you. Especially if it's big enough to hold a gun. 
---
Also, you are never forces into using mellee. The hunting rifle is one of the first guns you pick up and 308 ammo is everywhere. Besides, as a sniper you shouldn't be putting much of anything into Strength and that is really going to cripple your ability to do much with mellee
---

Oh i thought we were speculating on what ISN't happening.
---
Great shots. Like the one of Steelheart leaving Sanjay's shop.
---
Automatic rifles work better for general gameplay, if the same rifle has both a hardened and a powerful automatic receiver, then the former usually does only about 10-15% more damage per shot, but the latter fires much faster, and consumes only half the AP in VATS. There are also a number of good perks you will only get relatively late, after around level 40.
---
If you do want to use VATS, I recommend putting as many points into agility, perception, and luck as possible. Then get concentrated fire (especially useful with automatic rifles), tank killer, all the rifleman or commando perks, sneak related perks in agility, and bloody mess, grim reaper's sprint, critical savvy, and better criticals under luck.
---
Good luck running it
---
Did they buy the plans?
---
Would love something like this, too. Sometimes I just want to play by myself without getting party invites or having my friends join whatever public or private world I'm in. Nothing against them whatsoever, but lately I've been starting to enjoy playing alone more than with other people
---
Whiskey has worn off.
---
Having to kill rabbits for a quest or challenge. It sucked. They make a little sad noise...
---
Its nice they made the xmas one longer.  I grinded out the Halloween rewards.  It was miserable not my style but nice rewards.
---
Yea I mean the game constantly stalls on me when trying to switch weapons and use stimpacks so reating quick on my end just ceezes up.
---
They would of either lost their accent died or are too old, nah doesn't fit the lore they would of all been American
---
Well honestly, a rifle is where I find most of my DPS. Commando to be more specific. There are loads of great handmade and combat rifle options. Bloodied, AA, Vampires, Junkies, they all work very well. If you are feeling super nerfed then you may not be running the cards right.
---
Ah are you on psn by chance I have extra plans for those I could give you.
---
Happy cake day :)
---
Yea I luckily got all my Holloween rewards as well but it was a grind. 14K Overseer points is no joke. lol. So yea I'm happy to see we get a little longer &amp; can spread it out some some.

Alright thank you, i'll go check them out !

Yeahhhh, thats what you get when bethesda provides cheap ass amazon servers to pvp on. Its a bitch.

---
Nah I'm on PC but thanks for offer :))
---
I think the 2 top tiers would be bloodied and junkies. Bloodied being the best because of all the talor made perks, mutations, and armors. Then junkies probably does the next most damage and you can stay full health.
---
Ok so I‚Äôm just recently hearing about buying stuff on eBay. You buy, they meet you in game and drop it for you? I‚Äôm kind of weary about giving people money and then hoping they really deliver.  Is this legit?

Probably around 5k i see them in vending machines. On trading subs around 40k ( retarded )
---
Oh, you are going to have to explain that one in greater detail. 
---
And remember that Vault Tec's own head of scientific research was German (is German I guess at this point in the timeline)
---
Go to Welch Station in the SW corner of the map.  To the NE you'll see a staircase made of junk leading up the hill (towards Mt. Blair).  Follow it.
---
I would say even those are optimistic, modern AAA open world action-RPG lite games take several years of full production even by studios larger than BGS. It could easily be Starfield in Q4 2021, TES VI in 2025, then maybe Fallout 5 in 2029, if not later. And with such a long wait, it is understandable why the gap would be filled with a "live service" title that is planned to be updated with content for many years. Similarly to ESO between Skyrim and TES VI.
---
Regarding the original topic, I recall from one of the 2018 interviews that it was indeed the plan to release relatively frequent small content drops like Wild Appalachia, and occasional large updates, which in practice likely means one per year. Of course, the delay of Wastelanders changed that.
---
People underestimate a good vampire weapon though. It's like God Mode. AA is also a standard for PVP because it cuts through the armor. I get the appeal to the bloodied damage numbers, however, I lean towards Junkies and sacrifice some raw numbers for loads more survivability. Throw vampires in the mix and you dont have to worry about stims at all.
---
Camp fire tails..you get everything you need the go directly to dolly sods and turn it in
---
I completely agree with you.
---
Yeah, my main weapon is a hunting rifle with a long barrel and a reflex sight. Hit chance is quite good, as well as the damage and AP recovery.
---
Main issue is that I am forced into melee too often because of the lack of ammo and enemies that just swarm me‚Ä¶
---
For sure.
---
Yea for sure. üòî
---
I appreciate you are willing to admit that :)
---
Im surely one of them. I only want 1 of 2 vamps and thatd be a bb or a ripper. I hear a vamps heavy is the best way to go though if you were guna use one  like and explosive mini or something cus the explosion sets off a second heal.
---
Right o no worries, just check vendors for em youll get em for sure.  They have to directly be connected to a power supply though.  I find that lame but just an fyi.  They are neat regardless.
---
Good Grief.
---
Not sure who these ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù are.. Sorry but I really don‚Äôt see this as end game content at all &amp; have to some what agree with the first comment.
---
Personally I would like to see things like a horde mode arena, more dungeons and such
---
Not a great idea
---
The death monsters would be slightly bigger. 
---
Making them easier to see and therefore less dangerous. 
---
Your welcome Australia!
---
Id love to meet some vault 94 survivors.
---
With the right perks aaffr aae are still great rolls and builds for a handmade.
---
No doubt but they dont have perks to match up with aside from the weapon your using them on.
---
dude people would ask for leaderboards all the time did they just stop?
---
That is why it is good to have a weapon with high DPS, at least as a backup. The hunting rifle is indeed not effective when you are swarmed, the lever action is better, but still not great. If you prefer to stick with semi-auto, a handmade or even a combat rifle with the hardened receiver could help in those situations.
---
VE 50 cals are excellent but anything that fires fast is great. I use a VE handmade as one of my main guns. It rarely leaves my character. That and proper armor, can hold 2 pylons take aggro and stand firing on Impostor and not break a sweat about going down without 1 stim.
---
The nuclear apocalypse happens between the 1st and 2nd movies. 
---
And for the 2nd through 4th movies there isn't even too much radiation because they take place a little into the Outback where Max ran after his family was killed
---
People asked for a better fresh version for ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù when that was actually doing well, the only things I‚Äôve seen people want for adventure is a tab with all their stats, such as traveled by miles, enemies killed &amp; what not
---
I run melee and rifle builds for mobs. I have 15 strength and run 9 in commando for an AAE handmade. Not much I can‚Äôt kill. I don‚Äôt do bloodied or junkies. Too much work.
---
I'd like to meet some survivors whose stories we followed in the various quests.  I'd find it gratifying to know that even one person from the White Springs staff survived, or maybe one Responder from Flatwoods, or dare I dream...  one Mistress of Mysteries managed to escape the purge.  It's a pipe dream, I know...  but I'd love to imagine it's possible.
---
Please don't encourage them to release DLC, it will just split the playerbase further.  
---
They have currently stuck by the promise to release content as free updates, why not continue this idea?  
---
say  
---
\- 1 big update per year (like wastelanders has been continuously advertised as)  
---
\- 2 small content updates per year   (Like Nuclear Winter and Wild Appalachia were released as)
---
&gt;Well first, Fortnite is free-to-play and has much more content. Second, so because others are have awfull anti-consumer practises it makes it acceptable?
---
Ugh oh, you've got the taste for blood now! üòÅ
---
Nah, death is too easy. With the DLC you can give him a board and lock him in mortal combat with a deathclaw for all your settlers to watch, then you can put him in the pillory when you're not around. After that you can take all his precious settlements and convert them into raider outposts.
---
Or if you have an Nvidia card, use the Freestyle/Ansel filters for GeForce Experience, which are almost as nice as reshade and have almost no memory-overhead because it's all run through the gpu already.
---
Ok. Thx for the info.
---
I‚Äôd love to see contemporaneous flags from the American civil war.  The 35 star variant after the admission of West Virginia and the Stars and Bars or the Stainless Banner would be great additions, for completing Civil War related quests.
---
Never said it was paid... But id much rather pay and have much more content then these empty ass dlcs...
---
Leaderboards for what though?  Fastest SBQ kill?  I don't want those, to be blunt they are stupid.
---
All they prove is:
---
A.) who has the most time to play the game
---
B.) who has the most real world money to buy gear off the third party black markets, and/or
---
C.) Who has the most knowledge of how to exploit or how to hack the game.
---
Skill never becomes a factor in this.  If skill isn't important, why even measure it?  
---
Even if they tried to make something that was truly skill based (such as who can open the the most locks in a set time frame) it would still come down to hacking as people would simply create scripts that did it for them.
---
Ok thanks for the info.
---
Indeed, part of what drove me away from this game for months was the catering to PVPers and the complete dismissal of PVE and RP content, like the Wastelanders DLC.  So I don't think the game "*needs*" Leaderboards, nor is there a loud demand for it, since most of the competitive PVP crowd has long since moved on to greener pastures.
---
The entire US and China would have been lit up so I highly doubt it. 
---
Besides, wouldn't it have been mass produced prior to the war? 
---
It's probably a projection of where the likely major strike points would occur.
---
By perks I mean all damage, no qol perks. Aa is still awesome. I run a aae laser and aaffr handmade. If you want pvp and pve, it's my favorite.
---
Some are legit some aren't
---
Yeah, that would be really neat.  Hell, it'd be neat if you could be involved in rebooting the organization.
---
Have we forgotten about all the cool pre war ghouls we've met in the other games?
---
Vault Tec Rep
---
Raul Tejada 
---
Dean Domino
---
I like to think that the whitespring is our trading hub if you notice how many people set up shop there
---
NUKE IT
---
For what it's worth, there were babies born in the vault (I mean they were in there for 25 years, otherwise everyone would likely be at least 40 years old running around out there)
---
so the parents could have been the best and brightest, their kids, not necessarily so much
---
Hang vic for betraying his kind to hearsay stereotypical shite 
---
Only immature tards treat ppl this way prob still pubescent and lonely and it‚Äôs no excuse
---
I park a few of my builds on an acid seep northwest of Arktos Pharma and a few on various lead deposits. While juggling stuff between builds can be a pain in the ass, the method keeps me in ammo for the most part, even the heavy gun and commando builds.
---
Sounds like you need a brotherhood recon rifle and a fixer
---
Well since our fellow players are suppose to replace NPCs the saddest thing I've expierences was a new player who joined in the last free trial Bethesda had. The player got through enclave story right away and needed help to kill the queen so ran silo with him and helped him kill queen but he kept crashing in queen fight. He just kept crashing near end of the fight and couldn't join back due to server being full so we ran silos an additional 5 times and he just kept crashing during queen fight. The guy was so mad he just quit on the spot, really does suck for that to be his first expierence of end game content as I know myself using an Xbox X I still sometimes crash during queen fight but to have it happen to that poor guy 6 times would make any rational person quit.
---
There would also be another downside besides the lore reasons that others have mentioned. 
---
Imagine if someone uses a flag of country that is hated or not even recognized by (citizens of) another country. As an example I wouldn't like to hear a Isreal/Palestine discussion while playing FO76.
---
I never said you said paid, I was asking you (and people in general) to stop asking for DLC when they have said all content will be free updates.   
---
If you like i can drop the word free. Please don't ask for DLC when they have said we will get updates.   
---
DLC will split the playerbase further, why not stick to updates so we all play the same game?  
---
What empty ass dlcs are you referring too? So far everything has been released as an update (unless they snuck some extra content out without announcing it on their site.
---
holy shit. this is genius.
---
Say more things about this and how to do it please? It‚Äôs this only for 4K?
---
Thats unfortunate and sad you have to deal with that shit. Just curious if you are on PC or console?  I see a lot of complaints on here about griefers and from what I can tell it's way worse on console.  PC people seem to be pretty laid back.  Like I said after playing for almost 6 months now this is the first I've run into one on PC
---
This is an incredibly helpful comment.
---
DLC is Downloadable Content... Can be free or not... An update is DLC...
---
Nevermind. It says PC right in the title lol!
---
Embrace the melee.  Seriously.  Melee is good.  Just use it at the end.
---
Do we have any idea what‚Äôs in patch 16 yet? Best guesses?
---
There is??? Will have a look, thanks.
---
It's a difference between selling value for money and being a slimy, greedy, lieing conman trying to take advantage of people and extorting money from them.
---
Try to get a explosive Hunting riffle it helps when fighting  stuff that swarms as it has aoe so I find myself clearing waves fairly fast with a damage of 600-1100+ per shot with a bloodied Explosive
---
This. But they key is to keep wearing the vault underarmor and add armor but no outfits.
---
I have one level 350 junkie‚Äôs commando, and a level 90 bloodied commando. 
---
Trying to build a junkie‚Äôs shotgunner, but it‚Äôs a struggle early game.
---
We need someone to take over as a permanet mr fuzzy. Roam the park, kill scortched, FIX THE DROSS BOT
---
Not quite, by definition.  
---
An update is required to play the game, so everyone plays the same version of the game.   
---
DLC is optional extra content, that allows some players to do things other players can't.  
---
both can be downloaded but this does not make both DLC.
---
I have a vendor with a reasonable selection of Fixers if you‚Äôre looking for something specific? (PC)
---
I would honestly rather it NOT be a persistent world.  You get a quest to take over the workshop when you get within range of it, this is a pretty good source of XP, some mats, and plans for something that effectively costs just 25 (or 33 for a couple) caps.  The easy "defend such and such workshop" that usually shows up a few minutes after is an additional great resource.
---
So personally I'd rather not have the persistency (or at least the option to not have it) since I use it as a fast way to level up my alts and mules (especially during 2x Exp events like we have coming up)
---
I also think the mechanic should default to having Pacifist on.  That way the default behavior requires no action, and you have to actively choose to go into PvP, instead of "oh,I didn't know."
---
100% agreed.
---
This is not the case for any of the robot npcs walking around the map, so why just because they're human will this change? Only you hear their dialog and a speech prompt that changes what they say won't matter to anyone but you.
---
Haven't seen the bear head before.  Is that a vault reward, or what?
---
Atom shop
---
Start game. Find center. Hide in bush. Read book for 15 minutes. Die. Repeat.
---
Best part of this is dude watches 1 YouTube video and has all the answers.  I spend way to much time on Reddit and since survival servers went dark I haven't even seen leaderboard mentioned once.
---
Nah, they went straight for the thing that takes months of grinding every single day.
---
Try it. You won't regret it. Or maybe you will - tell us later!
---
I don't have a link but if you checkout the latest "Inside The Vault" it'll tell you what Patch 16 consists of. As far as exact items being brought to the Atom Shop or Nuclear Winter Christmas rewards I have no clue yet
---
Hooray!
---
It's called fomo. You may need to buy it now or wait until you get a second "chance" to buy it.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand what you are trying to say but it is a fact that dialogue will Be instanced. They already told us this at quake con. This means multiple people can all talk to the same NPC at the same time. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are human, super mutant or ghoul. The dialogue trees are what is new.
---
Yes I mean the dialogue is instanced, although they did say certain areas will Be instanced as well.
---
Welcome back to the Wasteland, foodbuild.
---
Don‚Äôt do it
---
He really did it. Impressive.
---
Ah, that would explain it.  Never seen it on a player, and I don't spend too much time in the shop :)
---
Thx :)
---
How many matches would it take to reach the required XP? I might try this! Cheers!!
---
*the minutemen have entered the chat*
---
There's a highway barracks near my base in Savage divide that puts out legendaries sometimes.   If you take the highway from top of the world train station NE towards Red Rocket rest stop, it's the first highway barracks you hit.
---
It's not hard at all, just level some more and get good gear. If on ps4 I'll help you out.
---
I'm pretty sure most of the new players we got from that time have quit anyway. It's not like the game doesn't give you any reasons.
---
Log in - check player vendors - see if there is an interesting Event - do a West Tek/Whitespring run - ??? - log out
---
The legendary spawn used to be tied to individual creatures. If the ghoul sleeps by the vehicle is a legendary, it will always respawn as a legendary, the number of stars can vary. That made it quite easy to farm, since you can just check the same creatures after a while and kill them over and over for Legendaries, and skip all the non Legendaries. Since some smartass bragged how he could farm easy Legendaries this way, Bethesda changed the algo so now it‚Äôs all random. There‚Äôs no fixed ‚Äògood spot‚Äô so you pretty much just have to do all the areas and try your luck. Events are ok but many of them only drop low level rewards. Good for scrips though. Don‚Äôt fire at the boss while it‚Äôs still glowing green. I‚Äôve seen so many times the boss was insta killed by noobs wielding duped laser before they could morph into three star.
---
Its worth it to do the work to get the violet flux for Calibrated shocks.  
---
  No more worries about remembering to make sure its still on when you log out, or accidentally exiting (forcing the relog to get the carry weight back) etc.
---
True. I'f I see some one ingame with a silly outfit I just imagine the waste land broke them. You know, to make it fit the lore. But now I can also imagine, lets just say kids with less than ideal childhoods.
---
My main is a Junkie's power armored heavy gunner. I've been spending most of my time PvPing lately. My build is solid for PvE as well, but I usually just stick to Queens and Imposters as I see them. I haven't been doing the daily scrip/cap grind lately. Too lazy.
---
I've got a Bloodied Commando as well. Haven't been favoring him as much. Something about heavy guns just appeals more to me.
---
Occasionally I'll farm Stealth Boys as the need arises. Still need a good spot to farm Quantums. That's about it.
---
Not worth it. You will get bored anyway, like all of us.
---
That is the most logical, thought out, and great debate I've ever seen on the internet........BURN THE WITCH!!!!!!! Lol no great points.
---
Stealth and hazmat suit.
---
&gt;Atoms are an important motivator and the offer couldn't stand without them
---
While I understand your perspective, and believe that 1st is a great value if only purchased for the Atoms, the biggest appeal to me is the Tent and scrap box, so, considering the differing perspectives, I would call that brilliant marketing strategy on Bethesda's part, configuring the 1st package to appeal to a broad community.
---
I had previously purchased 2 Atom bundles for the outfit that came with them, I have everything from the Atom Shop that appeals to me and then some, I'm currently sitting on \~2K atoms, and earn 60-100 each day, it's easy.
---
Repair kits started dropping from the Scorched Earth event the same day they were added to the Atom Shop, and their drop rate is plentiful, in fact I have over 200 on each of 2 separate characters, and recently dropped (destroyed) 70 of them to get rid of the weight.
---
Although I agree that some items in the Atom shop are more than just cosmetic, I don't believe any of them provide any sort of competitive advantage over other players.
---
On the north edge of town along the road somewhere? Haven‚Äôt seen that!
---
I hated the Rose part because there was literally 0 choice in the matter. You just went around doing shitty things and being a shit person because the game said so and you HAD to do it because it was a main quest.
---
Trying to find the bastards though when need to and can‚Äôt, then next day tripping over hordes of the damn things seemingly everywhere more like! :)
---
It's the right way.
---
That is a re occurrence indeed!  Congrats!
---
If it only was a couple. Judging by the state of the playerbase, I'd say there are more people angry than playing the game.
---
As somebody points out upthread, where do *you* put the litterbox?
---
Okay so we get other countries but what about countries that exist IRL but don't exist because of lore? for example canada. great big mess if you ask me.
---
how does one know if girl or boy gamer?  i assume lots of pent up closet cross dressers in fo76 by all the girl toons i come across.  like almost everyone is hot chick in this game.
---
There has to be a cult of Bethesda bashing to counter your cult of Bethesda bootlicking!
---
Porter Gage disliked that.
---
Thanks I was very surprised! Never had a 3 star level 1 drop before either..
---
I wish they did db xp weekend for xmas challenge as well üòî
---
This would be too op. It needs to be maybe 5 pct per mutation capped at 6 or 7. Once you get class freak there really isn't a downside to mutations.  Bloodied and junkies gives you a nice boost but does have drawbacks.
---
Vampires is still bugged. I stopped using them a while back. Yesterday I thought I‚Äôd test to see if they fixed it. Pulled out a Vampires FFR gat laser, a VSS assaultron blade, then a VE Fixer to test. The first hit I land on the target would regen a little, then it would stop and no more regen.
---
even then, you can't trade vault steel
---
I am!!!
---
Yea me too. Would definitely help with the Christmas challenge
---
Its gonna be cool to see a non ghoul recount the time before the great war
---
Those are great characters don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I meant that we met those characters YEARS after the fact that the Great War happened, here every NPC you meet JUST experienced it
---
It‚Äôs fine as is
---
For fun
---
For some reason I was expecting someone fucking a synth
---
I'm Australian too, but this wouldn't work.  The game is so steeped in 1950's America that to add anything in that detracts from that just doesn't fit the entire theme/vibe they've built the Fallout universe around.
---
That said, I'd totally fly the Australian flag outside my Whitespring home.
---
Never had that issue unless the gun has +250 DRWR. Sorry about your luck.
---
I have the healing salve recipe but a stimpak recipe would be sweet. Im gonna look today
---
No keep politics out of this game.
---
They really need to concentrate on dlc that involves everyone.  I've never liked BOS or Enclave factions although the faction warfare could be compelling.  A huge variety of viable factions would be my preference.  Each faction should have different play mechanics and quests and potentially loose alliances with other factions.
---
Legit? Depends on your definition...
---
* It is possible, a friend got the PA yesterday by trading several Legacy weapons and lots of caps.
---
* Buying/Selling in game items for cash is a violation of the TOS agreement, and could result in a Permanent Ban, or temporary ban and loss of items, but there is definitely a market out there.
---
Ah yes, im on about after processing lead, ore is probably about what you said
---
Great idea!
---
You don‚Äôt know how hyped I was to hear the overseer in the teaser they released back in June, I wonder how she plays a role in wastelanders
---
I would say 3 mutations to stop people being walking nuclear bombs and to make more diverse builds and choices instead of all of them
---
Thanks for the feedback
---
I almost read Satantron instead of Santatron.
---
Thanks. Useful to know
---
Well i don't see it coming,but i would love to see the Greek flag on FO76!!!It would be awesome!
---
But it doesn't fit the lore...
---
I know that issue, but nope those don‚Äôt have that feature
---
Like I said I have never ran into that. Have a lot of vampire weapons and they all work quite well.
---
The ZAX mentioned in the terminal found in the bunker is actually Eden, hence his interest in US Presidents of the past.
---
This is an amazing idea, but my main goal was to bring players in a single location in a session.
---
Bloodied build.
---
I too am interested to know that. As an enclave member I don't see myself siding with either faction of the unwashed without an ulterior motive.
---
I think these new NPCs are from somewhere else, the trailer said they were coming to the wasteland but I suppose some could be coming back.
---
Okay that makes sense, an instance means an area, not speech that's why I was confused. And you used Graham as an example, which is an NPC that we do not communicate with at all.
---
Right. Imagine if you could fast travel there to shop and set up groups for vault raids, imposter fights, SBQ fights, etc. Would be much easier to locate like minded players.
---
Any sort of remnant of the Brotherhood but I doubt they'll be in the update but maybe one day
---
I confess ... I'm hella excited for this
---
Oh yea the quick wheel is tricky but that shouldn‚Äôt be the issue, my character has the wheel filled with pipe revolvers lol. The gat laser, assaultron blade and fixer were the only ones of their types I was carrying, just to test the vampiric effect. I had to switch to them via Pipboy. I‚Äôll test them on an alt today, if it works I‚Äôll just need to figure out what‚Äôs keeping it from working properly on my other character.
---
That's it. This is the one bad thing about Fallout 76.
---
Oh heck yes
---
My opinion, so some might not agree obviously. I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and 76 is a game I‚Äôd recommend, if the games you listed are things you enjoy. Even if the game was full price I‚Äôd recommend if right now. I say that because even if you play only to level 50 you‚Äôve put in a decent amount of hours doing so. A dollar an hour of entertainment I can justify, and I think a lot of older players can as well. 
---
There‚Äôs A LOT to explore, and collect. Building camp is fun, that in itself can be a 2-3 hour play session! If you want the most out of the game you‚Äôre not speed running all the quests, but even if you do there are so many side quests and activating them can be a challenge. With wastelanders coming there will be even more and after that release things will still be added. 
---
If you want to see, wait until after you try the free trial :)
---
Nope the true driving force is greed. Profit in today‚Äôs world. Religion has always been a tool and will always be.
---
Easier solution (that was requested a million times over) is to bulk ammo. Most ammo is just overpriced at 1c per, so creating bulks would solve this issue.
---
I would rather just play the game to get what I want plus I‚Äôm way too cheap to pay real money for it. Lol.
---
I have *** UY Marine
---
Ah ok got a 1060
---
It's the fallout universe - that's the correct way in that universe.
---
While I admit likes are cool. I personally never had anything blow up like my sbq post ANYWHERE. But i enjoy communication rather than likes. If i wouldve had a million likes and no comments. What have I to gain? Nothing. This acc. Is ten days old. I want to to talk to people who are passionate and enjoy the game as well.
---
&gt;Fallout games arent like that, your winning is getting everything and seeing everything.
---
Is it?  I'm pretty sure that's impossible on any given playthrough of 4 and New Vegas.  I'm not sure 76 has a tangible goal or even a win state.  Like 4's settlements, it just keeps tossing stuff at you until you decide you're done with it.
---
Sure, they are selling items that could have been in the base game.   I don't like it either.  But it's not like the base game is bereft of outfits to mess around with, or combinations of armor that complement each other.  The Halloween bundle was just one example.  Yes, there were two overpriced Halloween bundles, but if you wanted to decorate your CAMP, Mischief Night dropped pretty much everything you could ask for.  You don't get to turn around and dismiss the fact that there was free stuff because it's inconvenient for your narrative.  
---
&gt; The volume of the updates has been far too low in content because bug fixes are 97% of the updates. 
---
And when it's the other way around, people complain that bugs aren't getting fixed.
---
It does for most as long as you are in close proximity to a Team member that gets a hit.
---
The SBQ and a few others have a 5% minimum damage requirement in order to loot, for the SBQ this equates to approximately 2775 damage points, depending on when she regenerates..
---
I'm already doing that as soon as I see a 1-5 level player I travel give them screws, gears plans for water and pocketed armor. Oh yeah and a rocket baseball bat. I just keep telling them to pass it forward, that's it.
---
Regular griefing is bad enough but sexual stuff is not cool my wife's plays most nights and if flip if she experienced anything like this hope you reported the scum bags
---
Cool.  I was wondering if there was some section of the mine I hadn't yet discovered.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for early enclave and BoS, I think the wastelanders are settling from somewhere else so it‚Äôd be cool to see a detachment of enclave and a detachment of BoS sent over to check out what has happened
---
Someone give this man 5 more legacies!
---
Ok? You can‚Äôt buy them though. That‚Äôs the point.
---
Haha, I like that idea
---
r/IhadAStroke
---
You need start with the pipe guns. Craft some and then scrap them. You will get the mods needed to make a bolt action sniper rifle with silencer soon enough.
---
Also... Use light leather armor. I think you can buy the plan to craft shadowed leather armor from the responder bot in Grafton (not in the train station).
---
On level 20 a sneaky-sniper works without problem, even in the Ash Heap. I like change weapons, the normal pipe rifle is useful for fill criticals VATS in order to do a powerful impact with the bolt action rifle, the pipe revolver deals enough damage while the AP are recharging.
---
That's the thing though, junkie is less powerful than bloodied, so being equal to bloodied would be a good thing. Though that would probably mean 6 at most...
---
The purified water we're getting out of those purification machines isn't going to be nearly as clean as the water out of the vast majority of our taps.
---
An instance means unique to the user. Grahm is an example of an NPC without dialogue trees. That‚Äôs the point. Those will still exist. But there will also be instanced NPCs who you communicate with.
---
I ran into my first person griefing about a week ago.  Saw the nuke mine get thrown but it took to long to figure out what was going on and I died from radiation.  It was in my camp and I'd just dumped all my scrap so they got nothing.  I went to do Uranium Fever and they did the same thing to me there.  I ended up jumping servers.

Last night was a new experience though.  I was taking over a workshop for an achievement and start getting wailed on with a gatling laser.  I didn't engage (couldn't even if I wanted to because pacifist was enabled) but I ended up dying from that.  I wasn't taking radiation damage so I don't know how I actually died.  It was about time for me to quit for the night anyway so I just logged off.
---
I'm not at all, this is the biggest opportunity to screw up the lore permanently that Bethesda has ever had.
---
That would be extremely OP... basically a full health build with the damage of bloodied. The reason bloodied is so powerful is because if you get sneezed on you can die.
---
This would be too easy, and really wouldn‚Äôt be much different than bloodied. Everybody‚Äôs walking around with 7+ mutations already, many will still go low health to take advantage of Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage, so it‚Äôs going to be basically the same thing. Effectively all it would do is offer another choice of weapon for a low health build. 
---
An alternative build would be to add a Non-Mutant‚Äôs effect. Something like an extra 50-75% damage if you aren‚Äôt mutated, or 50% if not mutated, plus up to another 50% the fewer rads you have. That effect could offer a ton of damage because there‚Äôs nothing else to stack it with, plus it would offer a real difference in build.
---
There is no way they are leaving that bunker to come out here.
---
We can hope!
---
See the last ITV. Has patch highlights. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights
---
I recently did the same thing with my Improved Repair Kits.  I felt like a dork for doing it, but it was an ever-growing source of weight that had to be dealt with.  It's stupid that they can't be transferred to another character.  IMO, they should be held in a type of weightless shared inventory between all characters.
---
So, you get 1 point for every 4 seconds you live. Plus extra points for being in the Top 1-9.  You get some points for killing AI and other players. But, its minimal.
---
It just needs bumped to 15% - 20%.  It's only a good prefix for casual farming, not so much for nuking or high level content. 
---
Think of Troubleshooters, Zealots, Hunters, etc giving 30% for one enemy type. Mutants damage buffs against all, so it needs to be comparatively lower damage.  20% would be my max.  But 15% would make it significantly more viable and considered for more endgame use.
---
I wish people remembered these moments when they say - we need npc's - I swear I will find a way to end that stupid raider bot calling me and graftons mayor......
---
It helps to have a group to play with as if your with others they generally become cowards unable to say things when 3 or 4 guns are aimed in their direction.
---
You can turn on a Pacifist Mode to keep from having those pesky 'end of group quest' attacks do you any damage (or accidentally shooting someone yourself if you aim as bad as mine). I did so and it has drastically improved my time in the wasteland. You can always turn it back off should you want to get shooty with someone.
---
I'd love to meet some more quests honestly... This fallout game seems fucking empty.
---
Usually when you play a game you have so many side quests you never have time for the main story.
---
But in this game it's nothing but a main story, and that story line doesn't even end either... Just continues among you to follow the overseer's path and never completes.
---
The writers for this game should have been fired.
---
Wastelanders as you conceive it will not happen.  Prepare to be bitterly dissatisfied
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_dungeon
---
I'm looking forward to the update that was meant to soften the blow of Fallout First
---
lols a friend of mine has a super deep narrators voice and has a female character he made for his wife and its always really funny when hes leveling it up for her (she likes to explore) and someone walks up to the character and that voice comes out of it
---
Hey, I have to get sneezed on TWICE before i die as a bloodied, thank you!!
---
My real point with this though is that I'd like to have another weapon option with all these mutations i'm running as a bloodied build. I have 6 or 7, and using any other prefix weapon doesn't do nearly as much damage as a bloodied weapon, so it would be nice to have another option to go with all these mutations. As it sits right now Mutant's only benefits once no matter how many i have, so it's not as viable even though as a bloodied i have mutations...
---
Workshop Capture &amp; Defend Events are the most plentiful source, but that does come with risks.
---
If you're on Xbox, I have a Plan Vendor that has tons of plans with most at 50% of list price, and I'm also reasonable on rare plans as well.
---
What?
---
Dont get too hyped...you might get dissapointed, dlc:s are usually overhyped
---
Its not just dignity its standing up and showing there is no excuse for that behavior rather then apologizing for it. Any time we hear crap like that we mock that person till they point they don't speak again male female other we don't care you don't mess with fellow gamers.
---
So, better taking part in many, many matches but just waiting it out yeah? Any idea how much XP you're rewarded for top 9?
---
Ah yes Fallout First, everything right with the game for sure!
---
I've posted about this twice before. Same things been happening to me &amp; one of my teammates &amp; judging by the countless other times I've done the event over the past year I know I'm doing enough damage to her. It's been getting real annoying.
---
Maybe class freak could also reduce the magnitude of the mutant's effect, then it is a more interesting decision whether to use that perk if the numbers are balanced right.
---
There is allways a glowing one in the cabin at pylon ambush site ;)
---
But we COULD get a new transmission from Maxson, as his Scribes get a comm-sat online...
---
That's my point, we're already mutated, so why not have this prefix play off of us better? If there's people who want to run those perk combinations for more damage, fine, but personally i would welcome not having to juggle my health to run nerd rage and use the luck points in serendipity for something else. 
---
A Non-Mutant's prefix would be cool to, though, got to admit. "Hey, look at that pristine coifed dandy over there, probably hasn't spent a day in the wastela-Fffffffttt!! What did he just kill me with?!?"
---
lol :D
---
This whole thread feels like it is sponsored by bethesda pr
---
It did look like a BoS base in that fissure in the teaser trailer... Ad victoriam, brother!
---
No, they aren't a downside. Getting 50% damage literally for running meta mutations, which you would use anyway, is to much. 25-30% is good enough.
---
Sure. But then you can't pretend that "people can buy stuff in the shop thanks to the quests".
---
I get your point, though i run bloodied right now and i was leery of it at first because of that edge of death aspect. I agree there would need to be an offset.
---
Be sure to sign up for Wastelanders 1st and be able to speak to every NPC as often as you want - for $12.99 a month
---
In Fallout games (especially Bethesda Fallout games) I've always had this morbid fascination with stories about people dealing with the apocalypse. Or the notes/tapes from people right before the war. The stories tend to be sad and depressing, but it just makes the Fallout world more real to me. It shows the human side of the apocalypse. It's easy to hear the facts like that the nukes and the following fallout killed 90% (random number) of human population. But hearing "fuck, they've really done it" or other of their stories directly is completely different thing. I can still remember the holotape in F4 from the girl who got chased from her home for getting pregnant... just a few days before the nukes. And she died alone in some cabin.   
---
So I'm really interested in hearing the stories from the living, breathing people. And since the people will be there to tell us, they won't be as tragic. They can tell us about the collapse of society and first attempts at rebuilding. But I hope that not every NPC is a friendly survivor who is happy to see a Vault dweller. In the end, this isn't 2200+, where Vault dwellers have a legendary status. I'm sure that many people will get sour, because they've got to try to survive and rebuild, while we were sitting in a cozy Vault.
---
Im mostly expecting the npcs to be little more than quest givers with faces. Theres no radiant AI like in the SP games, all npcs will be instanced. Aside from a few fun encounters with other players, thus game has been a lesson in frustration and patience dotted by moments of satisfaction. I mean there were times were I was legit pissed at thus game, wanting so hard to enjoy it but every road has ended in a sputter or a straight up fail. I can honestly say that Id LOVE thus game if it were natively single player and functioned like a polished fo4. Id blow stupid money in the CC even. Unless wastelanders blows me away i dont suspect ill invest much more time in it.
---
The only other online mmo ive spent a lot of time in is Diablo 3. (Not exactly an mmo). And the choices for builds in that game are staggering! Perks and weapons and armor and gems and skills that are designed to synergize perfectly together. It makes the game so much better having choices, and being able to switch and try them all out at your leisure.  
---
I am surprised ive been playing fo76 as long as I have, with only the one really well working ‚Äúbuild‚Äù. (I dont mean weapon types). If there were more perk options and armor options to mesh with the Junkies/Berserkers/Mutants, etc...weapons, I would be much more inclined to try them. Berserkers needs legendary armor that has, ‚ÄúDR and ER does not affect Berserkers Effect on Weapon.‚Äù And Junkies needs armor that has, ‚ÄúDR and ER stacks with each addiction.‚Äù  But then they need perks as well, like serendipity and nerd rage, except for addictions, mutations, or low dr/er. 
---
The list could go on forever. I am really hoping that with wastelanders comes an overhaul to the legendary and perk list we currently have. NOT MORE NERFS THOUGH! Just more build options please.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
I'm excited to see what type of bots they can make. Like the robot the railroad had or the one that sells big weapons at good neighbor. They both had a personality. If they do the same but with new bots that would be amazing. Or even better a robot faction (extremely unlikely but still hopeful). Also if they bring back the robot crafting station from fallout 4 then they won't have to deal with the companion issues of seeing duplicates everywhere of the person you're standing next too. Plus i can bring back ed-e.
---
Wish I was then I wouldn't have died instantly. Lol
---
Bugthesda getting rid of survival mode and having non PVPers still complain
---
Maybe because everyone has a fuck ton of mutations's they don't...
---
No, it should max be more in line from the damage increase of AA and TS. 20-30 max based on number of mutations.  By the time a player has class freak 3 there is almost no downside to mutations outside of 5 perks.
---
That emote is so bad. We were massively disappointed when it turned out it wasn't a new version of a thumb up.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for some kid to say, ‚Äúsit down mungo, lemme tell you about them commie unions that built your vault‚Äù
---
Have they announced an exact date for the DLC‚Äôs release yet? I know they teased a few more pics the other day and ik they delayed the release to Q1 2020 but have they made an exact date yet?
---
Yes please, I'm banned from basically every trading reddit and discord.
---
A chair getting stuck in my camp that I can‚Äôt delete. It can‚Äôt be destroyed either so it just sits there mocking me and taking up my camp budget in the worst possible spot
---
Just a question, why is it so important to have it on steam, what am i missing ?
---
Do you get any special bonuses on steam or something ? i am lost, lol
---
It gets boring whatever you do. I have five endgame characters, all with different builds and styles/ perks.
---
Some days I feel like bloodied mutated unarmed, sometimes I am Doc Holiday, sometimes I am a BoS commando, sometimes I am a loner, Russian sniper. 
---
Nothing beats joining events with my explosives expert. Real chaos and fun.
---
I've spent some time thinking about this, and there's a few NPCs I'd like to see-
---
\-A survivor (or two) from the Mistresses of Mystery. They might try to recruit female player models to join the cause and offer "training".
---
\-Some of the Enclave agents that survived MODUS's purge of members. Might lead to an Enclave civil war...
---
\-A Firebreather squad that survived the Scorched as they had been sent "over the mountains" for help...
---
\-Non-mutated Miners that are STRONGLY opposed to robots and automation...
---
\-Some kind of BoS presence beyond a single Vendorbot...
---
Just bump it to 15% and it'd be fine. Almost everybody uses mutations, so it's basically a free bump in damage.
---
Nah not that i know of
---
Bloodied heavy primarily, with loadouts for bloodied melee (unarmed and two-handed) and a less-great loadout for bloodied rifles - I only have 4 PER so that on'e gonna be handicapped, but it still ain't bad. Heavies and both melees have absolutely silly DPS, a lot of which is also helped by a bunch of god rolls that were found, bought, or given. Still looking to finish out my dream set of armor, which is a lot of what keeps me coming back. Farming scorchbeasts for legendaries to scrip, too.
---
It takes about three weeks at most. If he claimed he lost junk, he gets 600 vault steel as well as what he had. Then if you grind novice, normal, and expert, you‚Äôll get all the plans in about 3 weeks, probably less. Other then that, he‚Äôd need to get legendary modules, which is pretty easy to do if you get some sort of scrip.
---
1) heavy gunner tank (main) -&gt; the strength from the heavy gunner perks keep it playable
---
2) bloodied commando (pvp oriented) -&gt; almost unplayable due to strict focus on PvP. If I pick up two guns, I'm overweight.
---
3) guerilla sprinter (to keep game challenging). Only strong back and traveling farmacy as functionality perks. Works because pistols are light  
---
First two are definitely end-game. The third build is viable but needs team mates to get more than a one star from the SBQ (at least that is what I notice, better loot in team). If I'm not focused on that one during the SBQ fight, I get no drops.
---
When does this update roll out? I haven't played in months but excited to play
---
That's a spelling error. He meant 16x times to monetization.
---
For them to post a calender of the month ahead with events, dlc releases, updates, etc on the last week of the previous month would be great.
---
Oh you are. And your junk and caps are too!
---
The "hidden" holotapes in Abbie's Bunker are sad. Same with Niraj's holos and Sam Blackwell's when he is describing his daughter dying.
---
Exactly.  Make it a choice.  Something where people do things with their character different from person to person, not where everything is an identical single path yes/no switch.
---
That would be cool.
---
What are they start to do right in your world?
---
That‚Äôs what o thought too. I thought it was people who saw activity happening in the area, so decided to scope it out and live there.
---
Would you say it just works then?
---
This is actually a great idea.
---
Variety is needed
---
Like that little kid who has the room in Fort McClintock or whatever. The one whose dad tells him how bad commies are, and his favorite holiday is the 4th of July.
---
I agree it needs a buff... 170% just seems like overkill.
---
Just having the armor isn‚Äôt impressive, what‚Äôs on it?
---
I was hype to hear her too. I can't wait to see how she's doing or what else she's been doing since we started blowing WV to hell.
---
yeah, some of us still finds this hard to believe, i have done a ton of SBQ's from beta until now, never had the problem except for some glitches form time to time...
---
One thing that strikes me, why do none of the players that complain about this make a video with dmg turned on ?
---
That way everyone would see the problem and Bethesda has more to go one..
---
Just a thought :)
---
Fun fact, a month back i took my level 6 mule to a SBQ fight, she broke all here weapons and used all here ammo (here high lv boss stocked her up on ammo before the fight) , but she did get loot and the reward, but from lv6 to 10 she got nothing for some strange reason :)
---
A huge offset like only being 10% damage bonus  because what you also just created was super bloodied build.  Mutants weapon with adrenal and nerd rage would have you at like 140% damage.
---
Yes... that is an instanced dungeon... I am talking about the word ‚Äúinstanced‚Äù broadly.
---
I can get much more than that with a bloodied and still be so tanky that I haven't died in weeks.
---
I would make it depend on the number of mutations and the rank of class freak perk, which would effectively make the player's character count as less mutated for the purpose of the legendary effect. For example, the percentage of extra damage could be something like mutations * (10 - class_freak_rank * 5 / 3), with the mutation count capped at 5.
---
But his body is at the top of the world? Madigan's anyways
---
Found the Bethesda employee in charge of balancing.
---
Thanks for the video. While i agree with some of the "what is he right about" part i mostly disagree with your remarks as it has been already pointed out by other posters. Things mentioned like Fomo isn't a thing or perceived value are very outlandish in my perception.
---
Tell us about this grind would ya?
---
It would be interesting to see if the humans who come back try to kind of take over the Whitespring as a way to "get their jobs back" and kind of try to get back to a more normal life. I mean I feel like there's some things bound to happen in the whitesrpings with the cottages being closed off with the hand key pads and the rooms inside the whitesprings as well.
---
Would it piss people off if you could only have 2 or 3 mutations at a time?  That would actually create a bit of choice and decision making when it comes to mutations.  Then you could give a 10 pct boost per mutation instead.  I think 30pct damage boost could be pretty nice.
---
Not a plan, but a mod.  Found at some vendors (random item) or in the world as a loot item.
---
Imho junkies is the perfect bar to balance it against as they both have pretty similar debuffs and buff perks to help it. 
---
Maybe increase the ceiling to 60% but not much further then that
---
Y'know I didn't think about this... Hearing a first person story about what someone was doing when the bombs dropped but not from your characters perspective is going to be interesting. I have a feeling some of the raiders will complain about the service at the top of the world ski resort because most of the raiders were the rich of Appalachia
---
how else could it bee than for money...
---
This. Especially due to how few details we have been given
---
It will release on steam when the game has improved enough to consider it a 2.0 re-release, like Wastelanders, to bring people back to give it another chance, what would be the point releasing it on steam now?
---
I hope those npcs arent generic preston garvey settlers that just do something when their event pops up :x that would be dissapointing
---
While I like your enthusiasm - I feel like fallout 76 has enough robots as it stands.
---
They're not
---
In this game, there are currently virtually no consequences to dying, though. No wonder so many players are running around at 19% health. And some of the numerous low health buffs include better damage mitigation (e.g. serendipity or emergency protocols).
---
Not totally accurate:
---
Your food and hunger decreases by the second.  
---
Speed demon still affects that and you still take more damage on a team. 
---
You are literally managing the survival stuff 2x as much as everyone else.
---
So?
---
Madigan has already returned. We chill out at The Top of the World together all the time!
---
&gt; The amount of energy this guy put I to this utterly useless video is so fucking laughable.
---
Not useless to him -- he's making money off it.
---
honestly I know this is going to get me some flak but I hate the idea of human npc's (there is already npc's in the game) its just the most boring way to add people to talk to. They had so many great new things to work with but instead give us the most vanilla of vanilla - need a bad guy drop in a human - need a good guy drop in a human - need (insert whatever) drop in a human - its just so over used.
---
Non Human alternatives.
---
1. Super mutant outpost who like grahm are merchants and scavengers trying to make their own in the world. I mean think if we had a entire town of grahms.
---
2. Mole miners - purveyor proves they aren't all evil - is there more of them? Who are they whats a mole miner town look like. Do they all dress in cool versions of the mole miner suit? So much design and cool ideas could have gone into making their outfits unique so you could recognize them from a distance.
---
3. Vaccine bomb - make a vaccine bomb from the quest line so we can bomb scorch with it - once say 1million players complete the quest we get half scorch who are not all human but not hostile to us and are trying to come to terms with their new forms
---
4. Ghouls - I mean this  is the simple one - they are just people - they talk like people they act like them but still are not standard human. Not to mention one of the saddest moments for me was listening to the tape of the non feral ghoul people trying to explain they were not scorch or monsters to people trying to kill them. So much depth and room to grow as they come to terms with who they are now.
---
I mean 4 solutions to add npc's with a unique flare letting players be the "only humans" and letting us really get to see a world of diversity and complexity that could have brought so many grey zone choices of morality and hard to debate what is right or wrong in this new world but nope we demanded vanilla and now we have to deal with it.
---
Maybe enemy robots and vendors. But none of them have personalitys. Sure you could argue about zax and modus but they're ai not robots. They don't have a physical body.
---
meltdown reactor room, while slow, is more efficient than washout solo in novice imo. the other benifit of solo is nobody sits there and nukes the ants on you before you can hit it.
---
  i spend about 30 min in total sitting in engineering and normally get ~20 ants per run. (by the time they stop repawning.
---
I mean, in my initial comment I actually said they can be used to reduce the cost... Don't think I ever said anything about using them just for full purchases.
---
Yes, be excited. Come up with great scenarios in your heads, of how cool it will be to see this and do that.
---
Then it will happen just as it did at launch.
---
Yeah but after a year of nothing but robots I think most of us can agree we'd rather have people / ghouls / mutants. Maybe a couple of interesting bots but honestly I could do without.
---
&gt;  Remember when Beth bought out a studio halting its game development?
---
You mean BattleCry Studios?
---
So you are doing something wrong with your build. Git gud scrub
---
I love the hell outta 76, I‚Äôm hyped for this new update. The only gripe about the game for me is the latency.
---
Hell of a lot of excitement and speculation here, well yes I would pretty much welcome all of that but, I‚Äôm pretty sure the wastelanders are all coming out of the vault at the top of the map in the cave entrance and there will be raider factions appearing, that will pretty much be it apart from quests to do with them, yes I play the game everyday and yes I really enjoy it, but don‚Äôt over hype what is to come or more people will get disappointed
---
Dont "start the mission" right away with the terminal. Stand in the cabin and wait for people before doing the terminal part. This starts the mission, notifies everyone and gives them a chance to get ready, all before the timer starts.
---
It could easily be written in that it's one of his firebreathers, Rose either lied or is mistaken. They've done a lot more obnoxious retcons for weaker reasons.
---
YES! Actual NPCs and factions is what this game needs the most. That and Gauss miniguns. Can't forget those.
---
I don't think we should really be asking for retcons tho lol
---
Oh, come on, MATN is a bit of a lowlife but calling him a "slimy greedy lying conman" is going too far.
---
Why exactly? Pretty much in the fallout universe, the only two countries left are America and China, at least those are the only ones with lore.
---
Well that's why i wanted them to have a personality. If they have a personality then it would seem a lot different from the normal robots we're used to. Or if not that then something like rose where a person had their personality put into a robot. And if there will be a robot companion and i can edit it. I can promise you they will all be drunk.
---
The holo tape from the mission you get the Pyrolyzer from - listening to people who were non feral ghouls begging their friends to stop shooting at them and them fighting friends and family was just so sad.
---
You could just hang out with Biv
---
Another effect that is in some ways the inverse of bloodied could also be interesting: better damage for long term survival. For example, +1.5-3% for every level since the last death, up to some reasonable maximum, but I am not sure about the best numbers.
---
FO76 is super fun if you had friends
---
exactly 
---
my main character is a vaultdweller
---
bloodied stealth guerilla with a bloodied handmade for bigger enemies
---
i have light leather armor with a heavy leather left arm and it looks so iconic i love it üòÅ
---
If I don't have any friends on I always check the map to make sure that there are some high level people in my server.  If not you might want to hop servers.  Also like the other poster said you can initiate the quest and then let the timer go for a bit so people can get ready and show up.  Most folks deposit all their junk and maybe switch out some armor and perk cards so you don't want to rush the start up sequence.  Good Luck!
---
This is definitely a more recent bug/glitch from what I can see. It only began happening in the last 2 weeks in my case. Me &amp; my team have run at least 1 Queen fight a day, sometimes up to 6 on weekends for nearly a year with never an issue. Even brought a lvl 2 straight out the vault once just for fun...even he got the rewards &amp; loot. But more &amp; more players are coming forward with the same issue.
---
I also found a lot of people like to get the Waterboy/watergirl perk (not sure of actual name) and they just sit in the water the whole match.
---
I already do. But imagine a drunken protectron or mr handy or heck an assaultron running into battle. It would be amazing! Also if an assaultron gets drunk i am kinda curious how it would act.
---
Probably like Biv. With guns.
---
strange, i do use the weapons with the highest dps in the game, maybe that is why i never see this glitch (plasma gat and lmg) ...
---
all the Fallout's have really sad stories to them, i was effected by a number of them.
---
the saddest one that really hit me was in Fallout 4. There is a junkyard with a bunch of old shipping containers (i can't remember the name of the place for the life of me) in the house beside the junkyard there is holotapes of the man who owns and operates the junkyard with his wife and two children (boy and girl) in the tapes he explains to his children how to get access to a makeshift bunker he made out of one of the containers, well once i got into the container i was heartbroken.... seeing the skeletons of the man and his wife, his arm wrapped around her. then the makeshift graves of his children, that one really hit me. his little boy had a baseball glove and his daughter had a teddy bear. just reminded me of my family. plus the incredible ambient background music playing at the same time. hell my wife loves its when i play Fallout 76 just before she goes to sleep cause the background music knocks her out, lol
---
Dont over hype yourself bud. Knowing bethesda they will add only few npcies with voice lines taken from fallout 4.
---
And probably a bit kinky. And biv has guns. Just they're too clogged up with shine to use.
---
The way I see that, I get zero points waiting to find a lobby, or while in the lobby. Only game time counts, so, staying alive in a bush makes more points faster than run and gunning and dying faster with more kills. 
---
Top 8 I think is 125. Not sure about the rest.
---
there is a floor in top of the world with a bunch of shops in it - would be easy to make this a player hub by just making the stalls all the same size and making 24 of them - then as a player joins he just takes the next free stall - this would let players go to 1 location check all the shops - then move on.
---
I second this
---
This is correct. Wait for people to show up. Be sure to start the event at a crowded server, check hours (some moments of the day are lonely) and don't start the event if you see people busy with something else (scorched Earth, uranium Fever, etc.)
---
You need medium/high level players. Heavy hitters hurt the bastard, tanks take the pylons and support should clean the minion robots and bombs. 
---
Also, try to befriend players who joined the event. Most of the time, they run the event regularly and you can join them.
---
Wastelanders is DLC... they have stated before all DLC will be free.
---
People are complaining about the lore, but honestly this was the biggest complaint i heard in the game.
---
Daisy? was pre war too if i remember correctly, also in Goodneighbour, theres a conversation you can have with her about the good ol days
---
I shared this elsewhere recently, but I found two other instances of blocks bringing the point home on an already powerful scene. 
---
One was in the prison where a skeleton in a bathtub was clutching a toaster in one arm and a fork in the other hand.  The blocks on the floor next to the tub spelled-out "Pwease".
---
The other was pair of skeletons that had clearly been newlyweds.  She was sitting in his lap &amp; they had been holding each other when they died.  The blocks on the table next to them spelled-out "hubba hubba", and was accompanied by a teddy bear, candles, and flowers. 
---
I missed the blocks on that grave, though.   I will have to revisit that one so I can get a picture to add to the morbid photo album I'm putting together on this trend.
---
If it's beneficial I see no problem, all franchises have retcons it's how they're written is what is important. Imagine if Interplay never retconned vaults in Fallout 2 to have all the social experiments?
---
Lol
---
I realize i wasn't giving much credit to the modifiers added by those 2, and didn't get how much they play into the bloodied damage numbers. I guess i'll have to try a mutant's weapon to see how it compares.
---
I haven't really noticed this happening on my SBQ fights.  I run a stealth sniper build and generally clear out the trash mobs so the heavy hitters can focus on the SBQ.  My strategy is to plink the little guys and use my vats criticals on the queen.  I always get rewards and am able to loot.
---
Does anyone remember back when the loot arrow would spin infinitely?  Or when we were getting drills and stuff? Lol
---
Picnic tables in Lewisburg...many plastic plates
---
...you heard what happened to the guy that tried to fuck the Imposter Sheepsquatch right? ..right?
---
Rotation pls
---
Me and my friend do something like this - He runs up to a new player and tells them some crazy guy is trying to get him (hes wearing a bomb collar and strait jacket) and I come running up in a Police uniform informing him he is sick and he needs to go back to his room. After a few mins people realize I'm the deranged ones cause I'm tranq darting anyone who tells me the apocalypse happened and the guy in the strait jacket is the sane one.
---
Then if they played long we give them some stims and a lvl 5 set of heavy leather armor and chat with them a bit wave and hunt down the next person.
---
That's excellent. I didn't realize that. Thanks!
---
I am actually pretty pumped to see some of the people that are mentioned in the holotapes.  I have a theory that there will be people from the various factions that left and survived.
---
What platform are you on?  I also just got to that part of the quest, and need people to do it with. I've done it before, and will take a pylon while wearing power armor.
---
He never tried to fuck it. Just dominate it by passing through some subroutines. Besides you remember new vegas. Sex robots are completely possible.
---
Good advice! Always looking for friends.
---
they really need to make the bulldozer ability (that is the name of the thing that knocks down trees rocks and such) so we can just set it to clear all in our places area.
---
Faction flags yes, country flags no.
---
The US flag in game isn't even the US flag because the lore of the fallout world is very different from our own.
---
&gt;o
---
Very good to note - drop all junk before beginning. I've got a few perk cards I can choose. If there is anything that you think would help, I can take those next...
---
There's gotta be at least a few free staters who stayed in their bunkers or went back underground
---
I just had to server hop one time looking for it in the Wendigo cave.
---
Options for more accessories would be nice / gloves / ability to change shoes etc. Just little things to make your character more personal.
---
these mods seem to appear frequently (enough) at Forward Station Delta
---
Im also hoping for a huge dlc , but also learned not to hype too much
---
Yes that the one. Don't claim this workshop if you are not ready to run because it can produce fusion cores and high level power armored players are addicted to that ;
---
Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
---
I joined late and kept seeing in game references to a mode that didn't exist.
---
Nice!
---
I think Rose refers to that as Madigan but I have a theory its actually not him.
---
truth - and gave me a hell of a laugh!
---
Oh yes the mole miner science labs are just chock filled with drunk sex robot loving mole rats. Me being with them of course.
---
I think that Melody Larkin (Fire Breather Chief) is still alive.  I have never located her body and I haven't found any info in game about her death or whereabouts.  
---
I definetly hope all the factions end up having survivors.  Faction play would be a huge draw for players.
---
This is also a great time to "recruit" conduits. Being a conduit requires a different card load out, so see if you cant get some help.  Also, after all this, dont be the guy on the roof, not if its your card. Being a conduit is "expensive"
---
From what I found a sniper build badly needs lots of luck perks to keep crits rolling or you don't have the dps.  
---
Beyond that be sure to reposition, if memory serves they know roughly where you shot from and will swarm to it.
---
The taxidermy quest line about the guy and his sick pupper. I stopped playing for the day and went to bed after that one...
---
At the end of the event we need to see a display of total of damage we each did.
---
During scorched earth waves and waves of scorched mobs kept coming. The timer ran out and we didn't kill the queen. The waves of scorched mobs still kept coming. Unusual.
---
Same happens with me to the random quest that starts just outside the Hornwright Headquarters - where that lady starts telling you about finding the church and you're suppposed to find some loot around there or something? I've crawled over every inch in the circle that it directs you to and killed all enemies in the area and still have never found what the heck that lady is talking about.
---
I am going to dump all my notes and holos and see if that helps too
---
Do u have the plan bro?
---
This has happened to me as well, as recently as last night. Not with the queen herself, but with some of the legendary adds that spawn around her. I can see that I've dealt damage to, let's say a legendary hermit crab, but when I make my way over to it to loot, there's nothing at all there. I suspect this is happening with more enemies than just the queen but it's most noticeable with her because she's sort of the center of attention, and that it's due to latency causing the tags to not be processed in time before the enemy dies. When this happens with the queen, is it in a really quick battle with a lot of participants and adds?
---
Wow that's a lot info!  I will totally try to start switching over to that, thanks so much!!
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the tip!
---
I'm on Xbox
---
They didn't want spiders in their assholes lol
---
...woosh
---
I know she led the ill-fated mission into the Big Bend tunnel, but beyond that....
---
It's not DLC, it's an update like all the content they have released so far.
---
The have never mentioned any DLC, but they constantly release information about updates. The last one was update 16.
---
Why is this so hard for people to grasp?
---
Nice album! It‚Äôs fun to hear stories of people having cool experiences in the game. I‚Äôve been playing since beta and love it (except for the nuclear winter grind)!
---
Cheers!
---
I think I'm more bored than disappointed, which is sad. Wastelanders needs to drop, a while ago.
---
That made me angry. Like I feel like she was doing her best to be all noble but it just made me feel like she was being willfully ignorant. Especially when she said she still believes in what Vault Tec was trying to do.
---
You can solo it if you launch a nuke and fast travel before it hits just start the sequence in time. You will die and unless your able to tank the conduits and get pot shots you will miss out on the legendary but it will complete the event.
---
Yeah this one was the worst one for me too.
---
This is what I found curious about the game.  They were adamant about player raiders (griefers) having a place on release.  Yet in game lore makes sure to hammer home that the mindset ruins everything for everyone else.
---
Colonel's holotape was pretty bad. But also the guy locked in the fridge in Flatwoods screaming for help hurts too. They sure tried to cram a lot of sad into one town.
---
I am so tired of the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave.
---
Stuff like this really makes me hope there will be some more good mutant's like Grahm with Wastelanders.
---
There is a large discord group called FO76 filthy casuals
---
There is only a small amount of Wastelanders related data mined information, as far as I know, not enough to really answer your questions. I would guess the update is developed as a separate "2.0" branch of the game, and for now only a few scraps of the new content end up in the files, perhaps with backported fixes.
---
But it should be free, because communism
---
My communist union leader cowboy rp character would love it
---
Thank you for this.  I was able to find him once so far. Though something of note I tried. If you don't have anyone holding him and you leave the server and come back in, he will despawn. :(
---
My reason is expressing my opinion sorry I hurt your feelings :]
---
Ah, PS4 for me. Good luck in your search!
---
Walk around with your mic on asking players you see
---
.308 probably better, easier for a lowbie to find.
---
Yeah - them calling them by name like "you know me" and still being gunned down.
---
I agree. I make my bases near resources, and sometimes there's fell trees and stupid shit like that. They're just in my way.
---
Hang out with better people. My friends and I never do that kind of shit!!
---
It can't be too difficult. If you take over a workbench like at the dirt racing track, you get to clear the cars and tires.
---
After you set matchmaking to solo, of course.
---
It appears I went full autopilot and missed this one? Could you tell me the name of this quest possibly?
---
Heck i cant even find enought people to do the sbq event with frequentlyüôÅ
---
My turrets count my walls as a threat. Walls are scary.
---
Yes. 
---
My name is the same on the bethesda service and discord as it is here. Send me a discord invite and you can hop in with us. 
---
We play pretty much every day (unless I work overtime) and usually from 5-10PM central time.
---
Personally I just prefer keeping all my games in one place. At this point I have so many different launchers, I refuse to get another, no badly how I want the games exclusive to it. It‚Äôs all personal preference I guess.
---
The cafeteria specifically is where you really wanna go. If you head around back you can get into it easily without having to go through the rest of the school. IIRC it's to the left side, and it's the only door lit up-- once there, you can pick up tons of golf balls, plastic pumpkins, and plastic plates. 
---
As someone who runs a shotgun build and bulks junk constantly, I know the pain. :) Good luck!
---
The last 2 battles we did were about 5 mins long with maybe 10 players...but that's normal for us and I've always be able to loot her &amp; get rewards. We've done it 100's of time. I even brought a mule down there with me who didnt hit the queen at all but because he is on our team he got to loot her.
---
True, but I can also craft up a TON of .50 to get them up and running and the .308 reciever is an easy switch for them to make if they need it down the road. I also remember that when I started my biggest problem was ammo.  If I get them 1k rounds to start, they'll have enough to get to a point where they half the ability to change up as needed.
---
Aye, I‚Äôm not saying it would coincide with the lore. I‚Äôm saying it would be fun and people would appreciate it.
---
It‚Äôs not politics. They‚Äôre just flags and skins.
---
Not really a sad one I guess it could be because we don't know what they were going thru but. In fallout 4 on the bridge across from the Corvega factory there's a drunk driving accident - the skeleton is thru what would have been the windshield - beer still in hand.
---
To be clear... Pacifist only stops you from doing damage. There are other means to end up in PVP but your pacifist setting does not effect anyone else.
---
Thank you!
---
Nice! Comrade
---
We fight her a lot. We're all heavy hitters. There's 8 of us total. 2 of my teamates run silo after silo then hop servers to do it again. Even I get burned out after the 6th fight. lol
---
From what we know of the burrows, not all the Appalachian BoS was there to defend Fort Defiance when it fell, so we can hope that some survived.
---
A lot of people assemble a set of troubleshooter armor for this and the silo runs. Pretty much any mismatched set will work.
---
Yikes! I haven't launched a nuke, yet, but it's on my bucket list. ;)
---
Right
---
Ah! That's brilliant!
---
A players camp. They wrote a whole thing on their wall about their husband who passed away. Il have to post it on the sub later today, I screenshotted it because it was pretty saddening
---
Personally I think you're just being nitpicky over wording //shrug
---
Depends on the weapon but when in doubt use explosives.
---
I used a machete till I was level 30, then I used a fire axe till level 60.
---
Agree and disagree... the brewing station is the legit reward for that questline.  As such... congrats, go make alcohol.  If we stick with the whole "Atom Shop is for cosmetics only", then this would fit as an addition.  Wanna make it free, have it as a reward for like a Daily or Weekly Challenge... but make the challenge an effort.  Gotta craft some serious stuff before getting it.  And I think this is something they could do with a lot of stuff... like what they did in Survival Mode... but on a much smaller scale.  Finish all the Daily Quests and get a free wall color or floor color or something.  Now that would be cool.  Current payout is equivalent to, what, $0.50.  I suppose something is better than nothing.
---
Basically you negate 75 pct of robot damage.  Works pretty good. This is why you want to wait to start the event so people have time to prepare.  It can be a nasty fight
---
I checked this out but I‚Äôm being told that I require a supported game to use freestyle. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôve used it yourself so it must be supported right?
---
Miserable.  Just as Christmas should be.
---
FFR for pvp since dense on chest negates non legacy exploding damage. Energy weapons that explode do not get blocked by dense
---
I hadn't started taking the workshop yet as I didn't think I had finished clearing out enemies.  I was probably wrong on the enemies and the other guy had probably started taking it and so PVP was enabled.  The more I know.
---
Best of Intentions
---
Yeah... Nuka Workbench.... more crafting!!!
---
If we go with ops method of the buff then it would be just as boring as junkies. Unoticable debuffs for a huge damage boost. At least bloodied changes your way of playing.
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware of that.
---
Fire rate is better. With a dense modded chest and fireproof I don‚Äôt even feel explosive. Definitely feel the full damage of extra bullets though. Even with sentinel assassins, serendipity, and dodgy ffr can be a problem.
---
Always glad when I find one üëç
---
With the exception of legacy weapons, FFR is almost always better in PvP. Explosive is still a decent alternative, but FFR is going to prove better. Dense chest + Fireproof pretty much eliminates the extra damage and that's pretty standard.
---
I use a JE .50 Cal and it does work. I'd switch to JFFR if I could find one, but it's serviceable enough.
---
Let us sell offline like in ESO! That would be amazing.
---
What does it look like?
---
Found the smoothskin
---
I just can say not before wastelanders due to data mining only Chinese bundle maybe next month
---
Also certain power armor pieces have plastic, you know those ones you leave in the PA chassis's .. scrap those at the station you steal them from, some of them have 1 plastic ..
---
At Roses at the top of the world has lots of plastic ..
---
Freds BBQ Shack
---
Watoga high school is a gold mine, but depends if someone has beat you to it and what enemies are there.
---
I forget the name, but on left side of the map just above Camden park, there is the boat place, has lots of life savers, each have plastic.
---
Get about 50 superstims, the CHR Perk  that makes them work quicker (I forgot its name) rank 3 first Aid, dodgy perk, T-51 PA, grab all 3 pylons and jump ontop of the hut, stim every 15-20seconds and shoot sheepsquatch üëç
---
Chinese bundle?
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be too hard. Optimisation was iffy in the beginning but it‚Äôs smooth now. I have a 1080 and i5 9400.
---
Yes just search reddit you can find pics
---
Ok, cheers.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say here...the CMs keep up here pretty regularly from what I've seen.  
---
As far as AWS, I don't see that there's an issue, you don't think that they know if there's an AWS outage?  I haven't seen one in ages, so not sure what you're referring to.
---
Where is this "endgame content" you speak of?
---
I'm fairly new to the game, the two times i've run this event I've had to be a conduit (at one point for all 3 pylons) as no one else will, I just sit in the cabin and stimpack myself.
---
How's that ? i havent played eso like 2 years.
---
I beat this dead horse all the time.....but here it goes anyway. üòÇ
---
I really want more fleshed out factions with radiant side quests and a ranking system.  Also a way to earn "commendation" badges that allow us to select rewards the same way the scout system currently works.
---
Lets say you are a Responder. You get missions that involve supply scavenging,  defense missions, weapon and armor crafting, etc. Doing this gives you commendations that you then use to purchase faction specific cosmetics,  weapons, camp items, etc.  This would add a bunch of grind and allow players to team up with like minded people.  This would allow Bethesda to add more and more quests, rewards, and events to keep things fresh.
---
Now multiply this idea times 10 for all the different factions and the amount of content would be immense. Think about all the possibilities here.
---
Mistress of Mysteries 
---
Raiders
---
Enclave
---
Free States
---
BOS
---
Responders 
---
Mothman Cult
---
Settlers
---
Vault Tec
---
Etc
---
&gt;Unoticable debuffs for a huge damage boost.
---
You could say the same thing about junkies weapons, but no one is calling for a nerf on those.
---
I am with you on that one.  I got that glowing skeleton outfit and am dreading grinding the Xmas rewards.  My anxiety!
---
It matters whether or not you fast traveled to the event octagon or if you fast traveled to a team mate that was in the area.
---
I thought some were ‚Äúcoming back ‚Äúto Flatwoods 
---
I‚Äôll have to look again
---
No, loot does not disappear being put into the box.
---
Yes mobs will spawn dead if you drop a nuke but all you have to do is logout login.
---
It‚Äôs working now but that‚Äôs will last for only so long till they mess it up in a future update
---
This guy (or girl) get's it!
---
There are unmutated cats, rabbits, possums, foxes and even a dog.
---
Interesting. Doesn't the private server stay available for 15 minutes or something?  So a crash is protected to get back in?
---
I'm permanently in pacifist mode. It does no stop people griefing unfortunately
---
Yes. I've had server disconnect once or twice on my own p server but it puts you back in the same one you were just in.
---
Explosive does more damage and uses less ammo. FFR does almost as much but a bit less damage and uses more ammo.
---
I have both, BFFR and BE weapons. I use them both for different situations, for example I don‚Äôt have the dense mod for my combat armour chest piece and I don‚Äôt want to waste peek points by equipping fireproof, so I use a BFFR handmade in vault raids where you‚Äôre constantly getting swarmed. I use BE out in the world where I‚Äôm rarely ganked so hard.
---
I know there's a thing in events if you die at the end, you don't get the reward. Looting sbq should be no problem. I did it a couple days back, came in at the end and still looted her. Could be a damage thing. Go bloodied or get a ffr weapon and roid rage with chems or junkies.
---
On a related topic ‚Ä¶ can we get some stuff for NON-mutants? I don't have mutations, I don't use Bloody, I don't use Junkie ‚Ä¶ I'm a clean, upstanding, non-radioactive member of the community. Can I get a little love to pull me somewhere on par with the powerhouse people? Some kind of "Paragon" gear that gives you a bonus while not mutated? More armor that works when you have high health instead of low? Some kind of "Clean living!" bonus when you're not on chems? Anything?
---
Doubt it. Reddit does not represent the playerbase as a whole. Fallout 76 sold 1.4 million digital copies, that's not counting physical. If even a just quarter of those people are still playing then that makes more than the people who are on this subreddit.
---
People have already done this themselves by placing there camps close together
---
Yes, no one seems to have an accurate time frame, but I trade stuff between my characters all the time. I keep it under a couple minutes between logging in and out and I‚Äôve never had trouble.
---
Same here, but it is hard for me to imagine that they can rock out something massive in a little under a year. Especially with the progress we've seen on other things, so I temper my expectations.
---
I mean if you don't want mutant animals go play Skyrim, imo a lot of them aren't mutated *enough*. Bored of the same old giant size or 2 heads.
---
Challenges. Do the daily and weekly challenges. Check the fixed challenges that are only partially completed and complete them. This will send you to new parts of the map and create new random gameplay opportunities.
---
Personally finding myself asking why I've quit too, turned in 2,000 scrip and got nothing but trash realizing this game only holding players who are hunting for their legendary OP gear hence why the odds compared to other games like Borderlands 3 where you can farm for your dream legendary and get a few variations in one day while me playing Fallout 76 since day one and still haven't found a bloodied explosive pistol.
---
It's an auction house system.
---
How does one get banned from all the trading reddits and discords exactly?
---
That's my idea at the moment
---
I just hope there's some real substance to the update and not just more fetch quests that end in rewards or static props. The mothman event was so painfully disappointing.
---
Grinding is pointless if they can't figure out how to stop duping.
---
What's the point in grinding if the stuff you're grinding for isn't even rare?
---
Fallout 76 1st private world, all of the workshops there are no players to contest and pvp you.
---
New characters out of the vault can levelup pretty fast in a private world this weekend during double xp.
---
Players can pop up the fallout 1st tent anywhere and it is free to fast travel to.
---
I have not had any issues with fallout 1st.
---
I was thinking about buying this game on PC this coming week since it was gonna be 50% off
---
Hope to see you guys!
---
its still TLDR, and didnt really shed any light on the discussion.
---
Good job for knowing about outdated technology and they way they did things 3 decades ago.
---
If you were trying to agree with me that these issues have been going on since the beginning, bravo.
---
If you were trying to make a counterpoint, I think you failed.
---
There are a couple good locations like that. Another one is in Lewisburg I believe, it's got 2 streets filled with tents, awnings, shops, and stalls. Another is near Top of the World, near the cabins, a whole street of shops and booths. Or use one of the Whitesprings interior locations, create a baazar, or flea market. 
---
Or, to keep it "lore friendly" have them populate one of their empty vaults with nothing but used Corvega salesmen, and just have the vault as 1 big market with all the sales guys going crazy trying to sell you junk.
---
700K wow you must have quite a number of characters. I have 3 but try and keep them loaded with caps.
---
"Ok, Vault Dweller."
---
Pro-tip, craft BOS recon rifles instead. It's basically a fully modded hunting rifle that requires significantly less crafting mats than building a standard a hunting rifle and then modding it.
---
Oh wow, I missed this. I'll have to go check it out. Thanks!
---
Im pretty sure i read duping is under control with maybe the exception of PC platform.
---
Yeah the best advice would to be to give it a shot during the free weekend. I'm on Xbox so if you wanna hit me up during free weekend when you're on I can give you a decent baseball bat / outfit and some stims and stuff to start you off if you want :)
---
The problem is that grinding for gear for specific builds is nearly impossible. Don't get me wrong, I am against duping but I am sure that a lot of the stuff I've traded for is duped, but I feel like I play enough to deserve good weapons.
---
While I know a lot of people are waiting for Wastelanders- for people who just want a feel of it I wouldn't tell them to skip a free weekend. I think it would be good for them to experience the game as is and know they have something to look forward too as well - that way they can at least try to get it for cheap too since it's going to be 50% off.
---
I don‚Äôt think so  I don‚Äôt think they actually make it to your stash when you pick them up.
---
Cool and I thought I was addicted to the game. Lol.
---
Oh wow, you solved a mystery for me. I was looking at the blocks from above, and they spelled "Aluuz Aluuz" and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what that meant! XD
---
...There's a dog? *WHERE?!*
---
But most importantly Bethesda, give us the horse Power Armor as a reward. 
---
Honnestly, everyone would be driven insane during Scorched Earth if people were all wearing this, the Liberty Prime PA, and if Moreno was saying "Knight Moreno to... no one I guess" over and over again, and thats what makes it fun.
---
Radiant side quests? You mean another settlement needs our help?
---
This particular quest, I agree only took me 15-20 min mostly because my quest markers were good. I have had quests though, were the info was vague and no quest markers appeared even after restarting.Those have taken me hours due to confusion and frustration so I get it.
---
You know the photo pose with the 94 flag? Well it's that ,animated. You take out the flag and plant it next to you.   There's is not a single situation in which that emote can be used,beside maybe right in front of the 94 cave.
---
I haven't seen anyone draw this conclusion yet, but I believe that BOS and Enclave stuff will be "Season 3" of FO76.  How else can they hope to keep people interested in the game long-term after Wastelanders?  They know everyone wants the BOS and Enclave stuff, but Wastelanders is going to be Settlers vs. Raiders.  I think that BOS and Enclave content is being intentionally held back.
---
All of this is good advice, but Chameleon doesn't actually hide you from NPCs, just other players.
---
HDMI your PC to your tv. I play PC on a 70" screen with a Xbox controller. It's pretty great. NW sucks with our precise control but I don't play that much anyways.
---
I would not personally wait til then - I feel like you should give the game a try now while you have the chance. I mean there's always a chance they might do a free weekend after wastelanders drops but you don't know for sure and the game will be 50% off too now so.
---
Yeah. Go take over one and then look at the cars or tires. There will be a button to "remove". It helps so you don't have that stuff in your way when defending.
---
Damn. Thats dissapointing. Would have liked something involving strangler vines or stuff
---
As for the events....There are a lot of people in your shoes.  Try just going to the event when it pops up. Dont do the first step of the event for a few minutes to let people have a chance to get there.  Most of the time I dont go to the more difficult events unless theres someone already there on the map.  But if I see someone else there I jump on it.
---
I dont have an issue soloing Free Range so if no one shows I just do it.  I find this works better for Encryptid than Project Paradise because you need at least 3 people to do PP easily.
---
Also sometimes people bail in the middle and leave you stranded or they're just there for the killing xp and could care less about the event itself, but it's what I do and it works sometimes.  It's not 100% but it does work sometimes.
---
Thanks for sharing this. I will have to do that.
---
On a cliff near Harper's farry. There are also tameable dogs at random spawns that you can send to your camp.
---
To tear off a sheet. What do you do?  Floss the entire roll across your bum crack in one go? LOL
---
Wastelanders will be cool and all but I‚Äôm hoping for survival to be added again, they said they‚Äôre revisiting it with the wastelanders update when they removed it
---
I've played this game everyday since beta. To me it's worth it since I have and most likely will continue to play it because I enjoy it. So 100 for a year isn't bad to me since I probably won't be buying a new game anytime soon anyway. Haven't had any issues with it and I use the secondary camp at Scorch Queen Events where everyone benefits from it to conveniently store their junk in a regular stashbox right after. Private servers will be a plus once wastelanders releases if you want that single player story experience or just to farm resources in peace.
---
Believe it or not, I don't care. But I'm pretty sure that Bethesda will stop supporting this game after Wastelanders - with such a low playerbase it just isn't profitable.
---
You don‚Äôt.
---
I miss the hope that survival mode was going to truly be a survival mode
---
It is a casual game not everyone is looking to min max. Bethesda has junkies and bloodied for min maxers and other effects for casuals. This isn't a competitive game
---
LOVE it! This is a great immersive content you've got here.
---
blooms appear when Heart of the Swamp appears. i generally find them where you just did but if they don‚Äôt appear there then they‚Äôre available at another spawn point.
---
So 0 source to back up any of your claims. Begone troll. Also even if it has such a low playerbase they will likely still support it, For Honor has a pretty low playerbase and it gets new shit every 3 months.
---
No thanks
---
I've had it since day 1 &amp; only issue I had was the dead spawns in Whitesprings after a nuke drop but they must have fixed it as no issues since. 
---
It's great for farming and the unlimited stash helps tremendously. Also you get use to having that survival tent that's free to place anywhere on the map &amp; a great fast travel option. 
---
The private worlds are also noticeable smoother than the public ones. 
---
Take whatever workshops you want &amp; enjoy knowing that no one will kill you for them after you've spent time setting them up.
---
I would say that having more viable builds is something even "casual" players would enjoy very much. A game doesn't have to be hardcore to deserve proper balancing, bro.
---
DO NOT USE SCRAPBOX WHEN YOUR CAMP COULD NOT BE PLACED
---
any junk you were placing in your vendor becomes fair game for scrap all!
---
sorry for yelling
---
Dedicated and not betray it meaning?
---
Could you explain MATN? I don't know what that means?
---
Can you reiterate? CAMP cant be placed?  Or an item?  What's this scenario look like
---
i think ffr is probably better for pvp is what it seems like to me. Does anyone use a gamma gun for pvp? if you do which one is best to get? quad or anti armor?
---
Don't join a nother one while in it
---
I've only found one. I've found rad toads, deathclaws, a sloth, a cat, a yao guai, a mirlurk, a dog, and I have a mole rat right now.  I've kept him alive for a day. The mirlurk, yao guai, and cat died before getting to my camp. üòï
---
Everyone would run this build. The negative effects of mutions are minuscule after class freak is on. Not to mention the power some of the mutations give. Disagree with you.
---
Like I said, believe it or not, I don't care.
---
Oh, For Honor? You mean the game that is consistently in the Top 30 most played games? 
---
It has far, far more players than F76, my man. Sowwy.
---
Gary!
---
I‚Äôm Xbox and absolutely no issues with it! I got it shortly after Bethesda addressed the disappearing scrap problem (but hadn‚Äôt yet refunded scrap) ‚Äînever seen one issue with it üëçüèª
---
Thanks! I'm on xbox too. So glad to hear this.
---
No, it doesn't. Sorry. Begone troll.
---
ok, so there‚Äôs a junk item you‚Äôre trying to keep but not scrap. let‚Äôs say Cooking Oil. then, you load into a world but your CAMP could not be placed. you‚Äôre playing per usual and have a ton of junk so you hit your Scrapbox. since your CAMP was not placed your Vendors were not placed, this your Cooking Oil now resides in Stash. when you scrap the junk on your character you also scrap ALL scrap in your STASH. poof, item you‚Äôre trying to save in Vendor is now scrapped.
---
in this instance you are ‚Äúsaving‚Äù items by placing them for like 25k in your vendor to avoid auto scrapping.
---
Yeah man. Since buying first I haven‚Äôt looked back and even as a broke college student I paid for another month. I don‚Äôt want to go back lol
---
No event right now but last time I checked they were all pods. I thought I was doing something wrong lol
---
Roger that! Thanks for info. Doesn't seem like a bug but just a victim of the new functions. Thanks, kind sir
---
https://www.trueachievements.com/n39916/gameplay-chart-december
---
Let me know if you find F76 in that list, where FH is number 29. 
---
I know how easy it is to be in denial, brother. But you will have to accept reality sooner or later.
---
Thankyou! I try to make my camps feel like you could stumble across them in any FO game! :D
---
it could be considered a bug because items in Stash should not be getting pulled into Scrapbox.  only items on your character should be getting scrapped into Scrapbox.
---
Lolol. Yeah I'm excited thinking of the opportunities. My friend is on board, too.  We always explore and farm as a tandem. So a world just the two of us seems so much fun. Farm insane amounts of junk just for fucks sake, really.
---
How do people even do that?
---
Well I‚Äôm very hopeful, don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this game ,  I literally play everyday after work .. BUT . Bethesda is probably reading all this and saying to themselves ‚ÄúSHIT WHY DIDNT WE THINK OF ANY OF THIS STUFF THESE PEOPLE ARE WANTING‚Äù lol but I hope not
---
everything that isn‚Äôt USA is Communism
---
I heard 15 minutes. But sounds like you have experience with this. So 5 minutes and servers die. Thanks!
---
Whatever, shill.
---
FYI... you can repair armor and weapons at workbenches without using repair kits. I hope you realized this, but if not please start using scrap to repair your gear!
---
Improved repair kits are rewarded from some high level quests later on. Again though I want to reiterate, you do NOT need repair kits of either sort to repair broken gear.
---
Yes sir üëçüèª tester it myself. 4minutes 45 seconds is too soon but 5 min exactly and ur good üëçüèªüëçüèª
---
Ok troll
---
Lol daammnnn love the commitment.
---
I'm excited about the exquisite wacky bugs that is bound to happen when it drops. What new unearthly craziness will I be subjected to in Bugout 76. NPCs stuck in random banter loops? NPCs this, NPCs that. Headless flying psycho NPCs. "We can't progress because NPC x (literally) lost his head". 
---
I'm a little excited about how obvious it will be that "Wastelanders" is just tiny lazy withheld content in the cashgrab that is fo76.
---
üôÇ boundaries must be tested! üòÖ
---
We never found Moreno's body!!!
---
What happened to Melody Larkin?
---
Jeff Nakamura?
---
Anti Armor would only benefit on the Energy and Ballstic Damage. Radiation Damage does not get any benefit from AA.
---
I have a Bloodied Automatic Gamma Gun that does insane Ballstic Damage in addition to the rads.
---
Is this the same game set in a different year?
---
I had an issue where my trophy for reaching level 50 didn‚Äôt register so I had to start a new character and re-level to finally get it.
---
I suggested in another comment the idea of a weapon effect that gives X% of extra damage per level survived, up to a maximum of Y (the optimal numbers are yet to be decided). This allows for a potentially significant buff without having to run on low health or with addictions, but the trade-off is that it is lost on death, and rebuilding the same level of advantage could take a fair amount of time. Good reason to stay alive, though.
---
I'll think about it.  But I don't want to put them in a position where anything they can find or craft before level ten or so would be a step down.  And I don't want to make it too easy for them.  Give them an advantage, yes but still have that element of challenge there.
---
While the concept is interesting - it's hardly feasible at high levels. If you're level 300+ - it takes some time between levels if you aren't grinding on purpose, and all benefit could be lost if game glitches out at the wrong moment.
---
DPS weapons that have a high rate of fire cause it.
---
Somehow I still have not found carhenge in 600+ hours. I know I could look it up, but that‚Äôs no fun.
---
How are you getting them to 500? My primed cores only get to 350 with 14 base int, and a full Unyielding set
---
This was a great read üòÑ
---
So the internet wasn‚Äôt invented as a tool by the US military but to ‚Äúpush our limits‚Äù lmao
---
Bloody isn‚Äôt good for PvP though from I can see
---
I wish theyd come back and kill all of us for hacking in and taking over their bos base. We literally cheated our way in without a single bos member approving in person. We faked our way into being military too.
---
You're correct, this is a horrible idea because it would be too OP. For example, Junkie's weapons boost you by up to 50% with 5 addictions, but those come at a cost of addictions. Those costs apply to players with or without mutations. Bloodied weapons give you a massive boost, at the expense of being a glass cannon, with or without mutations. 
---
Making a weapon that has no additional cost is too much. Mutations have very little cost as it is, so this is just a request for an OP weapon class. +10% is fine as it is.
---
I like when money buys hookers and cocaine
---
correct
---
Same
---
Back when choosing a mode actually meant something, I miss this screen so much:
---
https://i.imgur.com/2i9xSNv.jpg
---
Is it bad that I enjoyed that scene?
---
It does indeed work for both fusion cores and ultracite fusion cores  on my gatling laser
---
That is hilarious.  Nicely played too.
---
This is the first time that I read something like this, but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes. It's a shame really.
---
I think there is a little room for a boost but otherwise I totally agree.
---
And I think I have some older low level armor on an alt of mine.  I'll check when I get home.
---
only thing to remember is that your TS set will nix at the carry bonuses of other sets if you're hauling a fair amount of stuff. I'm often forced to tank encrypted well overweight and then I sit in the pool after to rerad up to my unyielding carry capacity.
---
Happened to me when the game first came out- I was level 20 and this level 25 kept shooting at me so I kept killing him and he just.. wouldn't stop coming back. So many free caps.
---
I was the last 2times the Conduit for all 3 pylons,... yeeeaahhhh i used 30 - 35 stims  
---
and an mix of 3 weapons : Vamp Ultracite gatling laser, Vamp+Explosiv minnigun  
---
and last but not least 2shot expl. cal50 ;)     every time i have to stop the fire, for reloading or an weapon switch i pumped the stims in me and all the other time hat the Vampire perk done the restto keep me allive !! ok it cost u some extra ammo but for me it worls better than this "stim-pack-marathon"  
---
* and one rly cool way to solve the quest is use an VAMP Cryolator whenn u be an/all conduits.  
---
Freese that Ba\*\*\*\*rt on the ground, the bot dosnt rly move so long u keep freeze them!  
---
\+ the VAMPperk keeps u allive very well ;)
---
Your camp is a masterpiece - such amazing attention to detail!s
---
Good point.  Forgot about it , but I'm only telling my opinion about patriotism not facts. So no point in getting butt hurt.
---
This. I'm glad for the dupers as the grind is insane to the point of hanving to play years for 1 piece lol. Id say most if not all end game players have a duped piece of gear. Those that strive for the best through trading anyway. Now if there were an easier way such as tiered rewards, a grind to get there even if it tooks months would be ok. Knowing that the reward was waiting for you. Or world bosses that dropped set gear or weapons at a low rate.
---
The bad part is, canon wise, whatever happens is going to fail. Either they will prep for a big time part of fallout 5 or itll be tragic as hell because we dont hear anything about this region 100 of years from now
---
Np
---
Amen to that
---
Two things are true at once. While national identity is important it‚Äôs important to not let it go wild. The Uber patriotism in the fallout universe is a satire of 50‚Äôs era McCarthyism and the dangers it can cause. I mean the world ended after all
---
this is what I came to post.. I'm glad to see its been covered
---
Is that a good idea? I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be very efficient?
---
I just hope they make they story original. Something new and interesting. They only get this chance once, let's make it something good, yeah?
---
nah he got what he deserved lol
---
that's normal then lol
---
Im not going back and forth with you like this troll, blocked.
---
If a casual wanted a viable build they would go to junkies/bloodied. You are looking for more effects that basically does the same thing. 
---
Look at hearthstone, they design cards that are bad, fun, and viable. They cater to the casual playerbase and not every card is viable nor should it be. Balancing does not make the game more fun.
---
In my experience, that very rarely happens, although it may be different for others. In any case, it would be useful to have legendaries with more interesting niche effects, or perks that are useful for different play styles, and/or to give some sort of incentive to stay alive for a long time.
---
If its any consolation, the few gamers in my office don't understand why I play 76 at all.
---
Thank you for the location!
---
I only recently stumbled across it after a few hundred hours of play time. I don't think many people will find it unless they're specifically exploring for locations like this, since it's on the fringes of the map. :/
---
Honestly I'm just excited to have some NPCs to actually interact with outside of shooting or being talked at. Audio logs are great but they don't provide the same kind of interactive storytelling I like from these games.
---
Okay, that's your opinion and I respect it, even if it's wrong.
---
76 and atoms= happiness for some of us lol
---
Understood. While you don‚Äôt have a choice in no chapter I guess the only reason I like the Rose part cause I actually got the feeling of interacting with an alive npc (bot).
---
Thanks! It's pretty rare that I can put this much time into details since the budget is such a challenge, but if you have a good preexisting place with no need to build foundations or roofs, you can really experiment. :)
---
Even as a die-hard fan, considering I'm paid around 10‚Ç¨/h, I don't want to loose 20‚Ç¨ for a free update. I update at night. Update 16 is not that big, if it was wastelanders... Maybe. But damn, 20‚Ç¨ for something free D: .
---
The whole "make event legendary enemies drop for everyone no matter what" suggestion gets tossed around every now and again especially since Events were updated.
---
Now is another good time for that suggestion.
---
Pretty impressive how you turned yourself into the villian in your own story.  Grats on your junk though.
---
I love my free atoms from challenge. Every time I play and check the store, it's like Christmas "wow, already 1k!"
---
A level 1 BOS rifle and a fully modded level 1 hunting rifle are identical (I think) in terms of DPS. It's not about giving them an advantage, just saving you some mats so you can craft more guns.
---
To back OP‚Äôs point I‚Äôm an American and my family has been here for 100s of years. I still have an Irish and Spanish flag because that‚Äôs my ancestry and a Mongolian Flag because Mongols are frickin sweet. Just because it‚Äôs in America doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs not flags from other countries around
---
Great read. Swap serendipity out for one gun army and you‚Äôre golden. Serendipity doesn‚Äôt work in PA.
---
i dont played it a lot, but when i was in these worlds, it was something diffrent.  
---
Allways in the fear to get shot and the challanges where fun and risky, and the rewards tasty ;)
---
I'm getting paid for those 2hrs so I lose nothing &amp; gain 2hrs I'd otherwise be at work to get home get the update &amp; play.
---
I haven‚Äôt gone for a nice walk in awhile!
---
It will be pretty cool, but also expecting trolls to come by and cause trouble while you‚Äôre talking to the NPCs.
---
That's actually pretty cool too, I wouldnt mind but hope for the former so people who dont want 1st can have it as well.
---
I go around the outskirts of Watoga to get Goo, Fungus, and other drug mats. I usually start at alpha, then start a circle starting north through the train yard and all the way around back to Alpha. In Watoga you'll hardly find any legendaries, but I usually find 2-5 on my route circling the city.
---
Have you considered becoming a Backstreet Alleyway 1st member? You get your own private alleyway and a Survival Dumpster with infinite corpse and drug storage!
---
Appalachia deserved to be nuked for crimes against loo rolls.... utter heathens. Seriously this is nearly as bad as the Cornish abuse of scones.
---
:(
---
Right after I posted this I was thinking the same. Have a little trailer trash spot covered in free state truck beds for anybody who wants to stay for a bit
---
For Wastelanders I'll be taking a full day. lol
---
Heavy gunner, Vats crit and or sneak build, pick your flavor.
---
he is right tho.
---
no he's not
---
Edit: nice alt
---
The enemies still are dead when you launch a nuke. It‚Äôs hit or miss when you log out and relog in. If your playing with friends, it‚Äôs better if all of you log out and come back in. Such a pain. There have also been times that relogging in didn‚Äôt take at all. 
---
As for the stash, that‚Äôs pretty awesome. I‚Äôm only doing it for a month so I‚Äôm just filling up my stash for the month which should hold me over for quite some time. 
---
My major benefit for the private world is the ease to transfer items between my characters. That it insanely useful. I just use the blue suitcases as the my can hold a lot of items. Just put everything in the suitcase then log out, switch characters, and rejoin the world. Absolutely amazing.
---
Thanks, glad you enjoyed!
---
Thanks a lot!
---
np, really any BoS/PA mod has a better chance of spawning at a military installation.
---
Yeah it rlly sucks, same with the cap limit
---
Well. That explains quite a bit. Haha! Thanks for the correction. :)
---
And we have the gall to paint up our power armor with their highest ranks! Disrespectful stolen valor vault dwellers.
---
Thanks for the info! I did not know that I have scraped a lot of items but wasn‚Äôt sure if I could use them like you can in Skyrim.
---
I made 8 different characters that i played to min. Level 100 with the best amount of damage in mind. Hmu with what kind of build you want, and i can put you an effective one together.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the comment!
---
No problem, would have been fun to watch.  I occasionally come across PVP battles and I find a perch to watch and enjoy the battle and not be in their way.
---
You mean like bonuses to play style?! What kind of odd request is that, this isn't an RPG.....oh wait..
---
But seriously yes we need bonuses for all play styles. I am always a power armored energy weapons user on my main, but I feel gimped cause pa is not able to be legendary and energy weapons still suck.
---
I use Vampire on my Bloodied Commando build when facing overwhelming enemies. Both Vampire firearms and melee weapons. They work as designed.
---
LITerally isn‚Äôt for hacking terminals.  It‚Äôs for reading magazines.  Sorry if I misread your statement.
---
No worries, after all the card doesn‚Äôt say no PA.  Again thanks for the read.
---
No, it's a normal dog with a bandana around his neck. He was called "attack dog" and was level 1. I have a picture somewhere, to bad I can't post pics on here. üòï
---
Why does it only negate non-legacy weapons? Is there anything actually different about them other than they shouldn't really have the explosive modifier?
---
Right, but it's much more practical.
---
It would have made a lot of sense to have some regular non-mutated versions of animals inhabiting the forest region and then the other areas would feature exclusively the mutant ones..
---
Don't know what to tell you man, my experience may not be the same as yours but my point stands. It wouldn't make sense lore wise.
---
Better than a lie
---
I only do solo. I feel guilty otherwise.
---
Usually people at my dinner parties are loyal
---
Ive wanted to keep the lunchbox qnd occult books since i first saw them havent found a way yet tho
---
Yup. Same with Rifleman and Commando. Spread 'em out. If you have unused other perks, then go back and start filling each one up.
---
I find a bloodied power armor hevay gunners to be the most fun. Wearing power armor frees up a lot of perk pounts to put into qol perks without sacrificing much. And my damage is still insane
---
Can if u know the right guy
---
Oh wait I can post a pic, I tweeted it. 
---
https://twitter.com/T0Raven/status/1166155483591262208?s=19
---
Without revealing too much so more people don't start doing this, you should look into energy weapons.
---
No problem. I believe you :) Must be super rare.
---
I farm queens all the time and have never seen heard of this personally.
---
Is it really old, cuz ive never heard of it
---
Wow. That‚Äôs like the dogs from FO4. Love those guys. üëçüëç
---
I remembered that I never bought any of the Christmas items because their price was too high, but I forgot the price. This video reminded me again and I was like oh yeah that's why, 2000 atoms for some christmas decor. 
---
I'm wondering if they'll bring all that back again this year at the same price or if they'll discount it, or just make a whole new cheaper bundle. Lately bundles have been ~1500 for a good chunk of items, unlike that christmas one üòÇ
---
Depends on the weapon and build. For rifles ffr fir sure but for heavy weapons, especially legacies like Explosive gatling plasma explosive is better.
---
Must be on PC, my Xboxes update automatically, so I'm ready to play as soon as I get home.
---
Ofc you didn't know that. You get your information from YouTube. Its only explained 10 mins after you leave the vault.
---
I started a pistol build for my most recent alt, it‚Äôs fun
---
Thanks for reminding me.  I need to put that PS4 remote thing on my phone so I can for it to update while I‚Äôm at lunch!
---
Not anymore, sold it last night. I believe I still have the prime recover plan for it though
---
I would like the option for that too, I've got skins on most of my main weapons but there's no skin for the Grognak's axe so people ask for it every time.
---
But honestly, it‚Äôs definitely nice to have and I personally will get it again when I run out of materials or get tired of asking people to transfer stuff to my mules.
---
&gt; I'd like to meet some survivors whose stories we followed in the various quests
---
The ones that usually either start or end with a dead body? That's not likely to happen.
---
That does sound cool- and yeah thats why I wanted to do shotgun cause I just think it‚Äôd be fun lol
---
Damage wise bloodied unarmed and bloodied commando are both very good
---
Hey, no problem, there's also a tool to help you mod your weapons called nukacrypt. You can do a search from Tools &gt; Item, but the Fixer URL is  [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle\_Fixer](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle_Fixer) and the handmade  [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04\_HandMadeGun](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04_HandMadeGun)
---
Since VATS (I believe) is classed as hip fire and not sighted, the best mods for VATS rifles would usually include Reflex Sight (for lowest AP cost, and best hip fire accuracy), Aligned Long Barrel or True Long Barrel, Aligned Stock or True Stock, Powerful Automatic Receiver (highest auto rifle base damage) or Tweaked Automatic Receiver (higher auto rifle VATS Critical damage). I would use Stinging Magazine for higher ammo capacity and armor penetration, although Perforating Magazine has higher armor pen but higher AP cost. You'll have to craft then scrap quite a few fixers to get some of these mods, if you don't already have them btw.
---
Finally, VATS can be a little buggy sometimes and hits at longer range (eg. when shooting down a scorchbeast) can be a problem, so I've found using Orange Mentats (which gives you +5 Perception and better gun accuracy) helps a lot in these situtaions.
---
I'm glad I didn't describe him, I remember the bandana being red. üòÇ I would have been wrong. I've been doing a lot of looking for pets to better understand the system. I use to find one every 4 months, but this week I've found at least 5. Pets can spawn anywhere Mr Messenger spawns apparently. I've been looking for Mr Messenger, and memorizing his locations. üòâ
---
I've stopped playing until wastelanders drops.
---
I'm looking for a rifle or auto rifle build. I'm not sure Pistol builds are any good even though I have a couple good roll pistols.
---
Rifles (semi and auto) with stealth is likely what I am looking for. I'm coming back to the game after a break as well (been back about a week) and that has also spurred the interest in changing it up.
---
I have some decent rifles, but most of my guns are from trading on the forums back in the day (TSE etc).  
---
  
---
Basically a good self sufficient rifle build that can play well.  Appreciate the help and while I can just make a build with perks for a particular weapon, I'd rather hear from someone who has use them so I don't waste points and perks since I need to grind levels to make the change.
---
Bethesda's system of 'free' content is stupid.
---
We shouldn't need to claim it in a limited window on the Atomic Shop, free content should just be available to all immediately.  You know, on our very limited CAMP item list that has seldom been updated with new items that aren't just from the Atomic Shop.  By now most players probably have nearly every single plan for furniture or other items, and we have yet to see additional plans added to that catalogue even for items that can be found on the game world, but aren't available for players to build.
---
This ties into one of Bethesda's bigger problems with the way they seem to be completely allergic to adding things to their game for ALL players to enjoy.  Not just those who go through the Atomic shop.  It's like Bethesda doesn't understand the concept of improving their game so that the experience is better and there's more content. Instead everything has to be a transaction first before they give something to you.
---
Unyielding armor talent increases the ammo count for cores????
---
"Farming's hard work. It worse now that the Raiders keep attacking our crops. Can you get them to stop?"
---
"The only thing sweeter than a fancy lad is a big bag of caps. I know just how to get more. Can you shake down those Settlers for all their caps?"
---
Also if you max one and have one point in the other two the difference between being maxed on all three isn't that great which can be helpful for more casual builds.
---
Yeah I would like the offline option. I can be offline on Xbox but if they're in game :/ they know
---
Idk, have never crafted them wo it. But I get 350 charge cores, so if you get less than that, yes?
---
I created a Plasma Core about 3 days ago 140% Charge. Not sure what the "Shot" count is, as I don't have a Plasma Gat, I did it as a thought experiment.
---
Here‚Äôs a map also. The red dots indicate where tameables can be found, if you‚Äôre not running into the messenger or the nanny, etc. üôÇ

It does. 999 out of a full core.
---
Melee is fun, are you looking for a damage build, a tank or an offtank?
---
A good thing that you can do is sharing your actual build with Nukesdragons.com .
---
From my point of view, if you want to be tanky, keep you STR, lower you AGI and PER for some INT and go for a Heavy Gunner PA  build, with emergency protocols, nerd rage, and shit like this. Keep some LCK for Bloody Mess, Stratched Genes and Class Freak. I don't know if Dodgy proc in PA but you'd like to use it as well since you don't need your AP that much. 
---
If your melee already have some stealth perk, go for a Bloodied stealth commando build with full UNY set, you don't need much STR but you do need LCK, AGI and PER for all the crazy vats damage perk, weapon perks, tank killer, etc. Don't forget serpendity and fireproof to counter SB even if you're 100% undetected. 
---
If you want to go offtank, you'll need to rise your BR/ER but not to much because at some point it's better to directly use Blocker, Dodgy and legendary damage reduction, use some combinaison of zealots/mutant slayer/ troubleshooter armor, use Junky or Furious weapons.
---
Hard to give you more advice without your actual build and the goal you're aiming.
---
Griefing
---
I'm sure it won't be shallow and disappointing at all lol
---
Explosive weapons have a chance to Stagger, which negates the Sentinel's effect, but this can also negated with Dense Mod on Chest, since damage is limited per round, the best choice is to deliver more rounds as fast as possible, my BFFR LMG is the best PvP weapon I've found, it melts all instantly, and has the range to stay away from those no skill, can't aim, Tesla Wielding Wanna-Bees.
---
Awesome pic
---
Wait you can do that? I'm on PS4 as well
---
If it's paid √©_√® enjoy your Christmas scorched.
---
I haven‚Äôt used any atoms since I bought the game a year ago. Just not a cosmetic player. I‚Äôm too busy wondering the map and really don‚Äôt spend much time at my camp. I‚Äôve got around 9300 saved up.
---
I am. It's a lonely game. No matter how promising the quest seems, everyone is already dead, or a bot. It'll be nice not to be alone.
---
PS4 actually. But there might be a way to get it updated while I'm at work as well.
---
The closest thing other than prewar ghouls so far in the series was the protagonist of Fallout 4 and they went right in when the bombs fell.

This is a big idea.

Don't get too excited, these people give you nowt for nowt.
---
Great around vampire builds
---
Bloodied sneak melee is funnier than shotgun for close range. Still, using a shotgun with enforcer is usefull.
---
Scaling up to 5 mutations wouldn't even be OP. It would just put it on par with junkies and the negative effects if withdrawal arent even as bad as mutations so it would make sense.
---
Yep, I use it to collect resources, make trades, and if there happens to be an SBQ fight, I'll jump in on that too
---
That‚Äôs me. Thanks :)
---
And I can tell you the moon is made of cheese. It just makes sense. 
---
At which point I would assume that you would ask for some sort of explanation for my reasoning.
---
Unyielding is still omitted from the v94 drop table. They know about it and haven't given a response. My group dropped our daily runs so damn fast.
---
Havent played in a while so not sure if things changed currently. Played when e-shotguns one shotted everything and also after nerf I played with a bloody explosive combat shotgun. It was still viable but more as a low perk invested secondary weapon complementing a bloody commando what have you build.
---
Super eerie, I love it
---
What damage numbers are displayed for your per shot damage?  How long did she live, seconds or 15 minutes?  If you get into a SBQ battle with a bunch of high dps builds who kill her quickly and are only doing nominal damage,  you don't register enough damage to gain a reward.
---
Junkies is exactly the same thing except that withdrawal effects arent half as bad as mutation negatives. Either junkies should be jerked or mutants should be buffed take your pick.
---
I have had 4 separate occasions over the weekend where I did not receive the Event Rewards, every time was when I launched the Nuke, and travelled to the site before the Event started, I was able to loot the SBQ each time though, there is a requirement that you do 5% damage to be able to loot her, which equates to about 2775 damage, depending on when she regens, it may require a little more.
---
I can easily achieve the minimum damage requirement with one good burst from my BFFR LMG, so as long as there are plenty of players at the event, I dump one mag on the SBQ, then concentrate on the mobs.
---
You really don't die at all, not compared to a bloodied build. Coming from an unyielding and vanguard user
---
I still gave high hopes for 76 to turn itself around. Gonna be interesting to se how they dealt with the war
---
the first battle lasted a good 5 - 10 minutes. How do I tell how much damage I did? I used a lot of ammo  
---
The second battle was over quickly, someone was way OP
---
Cool your jets friendo. I gotta see how Wastelanders is before I liquidate all my shit
---
i like to keep things simpler.  having multiple sets doesn't work for me, so i've tried to build out a general purpose that works out well for me.  one robot piece, 3 vanguard and 1 bolstering.  four with deep pockets, chest with dense ( i use explosive ammo), couple with weapon weight reduction, 1 with junk weight reduction, 2 with food reduction.  i swap in the 75% junk reduction perk card when the going gets heavy.
---
So if you have every piece of vanguard, that‚Äôs + 175 in damage resist? It‚Äôs worth it huh?
---
It's soon enough after the bombs fell that there could be a significant Enclave presence, provided there were survivors in or around Appalachia.
---
Survivors of the Great War would be interesting also. They have direct comparisons to pre-war and post-war society.
---
Just please, no more Brotherhood of Steel. They shouldn't even exist in the first place yet, let alone there being more BoS members in Appalachia than anywhere else at this point. Makes no sense. Fallout doesn't need the BoS to be a Fallout game. It's OK. They shouldn't exist yet, so don't keep forcing it.
---
Maybe have a set % for mutations individual based on their negative sides? For example marsupial could give 3% DMG boost but grounded could give you a 7% boost or maybe twisted muscle could give 5% boost just in case your melee weapon breaks. 
---
I haven't played the game in months so I can't remember how bothered I was when testing all the mutations but feel free to play with the idea of it's not too OP
---
Thanks for this! I hope that mini nuke dud is meant to be apart of the reward list.
---
Exploding is natively good on weapons with high fire rates. You want to "poke" with one to see if your pvp opponent has dense/fireproof. If they do, FFR is better.
---
Some legendary effects actually have downsides. Both TS and Explode negatively affect cone of fire and accuracy. Since condition decay is based on # of hits, a TSE will always break quickly. Splash damage counts as additional hits, as well.
---
FFR has no downsides other than reaching cone of fire exaggeration quicker. Of course, this won't apply in VATS.
---
Are you not welcomed on Twitter anymore?
---
I got the issue where they are all dead last night. But I just re-log with my other character and it fixes it. I cycle back to my main and it works. As whenever I launch a nuke I run it with all characters anyway, it isn‚Äôt a big deal at all.
---
you can launch a nuke and farm it with every single one of your characters, so who cares if you have to re-log one extra time?
---
We killed the SBQ. I think they could get over it.
---
Turn on the damage display for Adventure under the game settings. it will show you how much damage each shot does. With her DR it's shocking how little damage you really do.
---
I don't know about you, but it's oddly satisfying killing Mole Miners.
---
How many did you buy? ...
---
You can set you ps4's standby mode so that it downloads updates automatically. I think in energy settings
---
Strength first of all, only around 2 for Bandolier because of high ammo consumption of auto rifles. 
---
Then max perception of course, 9 Rifleman/Commando, 3 ranks in Tank Killer and the most effective for auto rifles is concentrated fire. You could also switch this up with ground pounder if you dont want to do vats.
---
Endurance id go with 3 for fireproof rank 3 cause you mentioned using some TSE's.
---
Charisma i mostly use only 2 for one rank of Lone Wanderer. If you are more of a team Player id say 3 for inspirational.
---
Intelligence id put in 10 to 13 points, comes down if you want to do bloodied. Demo Expert 5, gunsmith 5 and Nerd rage 3.
---
Agility needs to be as high as possible for sneaking and alot of AP. Id go 15, Adrenalin 5, Covert Operative 3, Sneak 3, Escape Artist 1 and Action Boy 3
---
Luck id go around 8, bloody mess 3, Starched Genes 2, Serendipity 3 for Bloodied if not id go Tormentor 3
---
Yep it's +175 when you are at 100% health and no rads. It does drop but I don't know the rates it does that based on your health bar. Have to say though, I started as a vanguard sentinel commando but I now mainly run unyielding sentinel/sneak commando and the bloodied damage on my b2525 combat rifle far outstrips my aa ffr handmade when fighting sbq, sheepsquatch etc
---
There seems to be a lot of people gathering groups to do that on the text chat mod.
---
Turrets are broken right now. I dont bother with them, as they seem to attract enimes, rather than deter them.
---
i also need this if you wanna trade
---
It was working on players few months ago, but I had no idea it was affecting npc too since it involved a resurrection from what I read back then.
---
If its above the minimum specs you should be able to run it on 40-60 fps consistent, but the quality of the game also depends on how much bandwidth you have
---
&gt;I want my own flag I can stick on top of my base.
---
Then your country can become a nuclear power and someone there can publish a fallout game.
---
The comments on Youtube are hilarious.
---
Nice, this will help a lot. üòÄ
---
Unrelated,  but that boat you‚Äôre on? Someone could probably make a great side quest involving going in the boat.
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of side quests in this game. They‚Äôve added more since release. Is it as dense as a single-player FO? No, but c‚Äômon, no side quests? That‚Äôs simply not true.  
---
FYI, every daily, event, and what not is also a side quest. In addition to the actual side quests. 
---
Check out the Toxic Valley for several and the Ash Heap for more.
---
I'm going to find somewhere so far in the sky so I don't have to worry
---
You can run out the back of the silo at the bottom and into the next one without any spawns.
---
Well thats the thing though, everything is in fact above minimum but I lack that extra VRAM as seen [here](https://i.imgur.com/1bJbqBX.png)
---
. If you are running Empath as a Bloodied player, that is just poor decision making.  I never said there are Vampire Bloodied weapons, there are not.
---
\- as far as Herbivore Make corn soup or carry melons, meats you dietary and fluid needs with just a bit more Water needed.
---
\- If they made it on par with Junkies, almost no one would run junkies, by end game how many players are not running without 5+ mutations? 
---
\- There is probably not enough downside to Mutations as is without making them even more worthwhile with a 60% damage buff.
---
üëç
---
\#Goals lol I really will go check out those perk cards when I get on tonight. TY!
---
Yea I googled it, I just need to put it in "Rest Mode" before I leave for work. I already have automatic updates set up.
---
Also, don't forgot mutations.
---
Cool. Thanks! üëçüëç
---
sounds like a plan to me, im online right now if you wanna add me
---
Holy s\*\*\*! What lvl are you??
---
Racist
---
Oh, I dont think it'll run then, even at the lowest settings
---
Aren't we all? I just think there's bigger priorities for beth to make Wastelanders great so this game doesn't die for good, you can bet the steam release will come with Wastelanders or shortly after if it is a success... I get having it on steam is nice but I only open the launcher once a week max to update the game.
---
What help do you need?
---
F
---
yeah pretty much as I expected. sucks I cannot demo it to be certain
---
And an AAE plasma always helps üòÇ
---
There's a magazine that reduces Heavy weapons ammo consumption.
---
All it does is boost capacity by 15% for FC and PC gatlings.
---
Beware: what is written for perk/item descriptions is actually wrong 33% of the time.
---
PA has a hidden % reduction to damage and radiation.
---
The only pro/cons would be the lack of legendary effects with PA.
---
I disagree but for a different reason - I really like climbing the mountains and things like that which some of it would not be possible without marsupial for those of us that don't wanna go clunking around in ugly, power armor all the time.
---
Melee and rifle builds are best right now, with heavy guns shortly behind, then pistols barely keeping up and being mediocre at best.
---
Then way down here is shotguns. Totally broken and a husk of their former selves. Vats exits after each shot, forcing you to use vats again to shoot the same enemy twice. Every time you shoot enemies their health bar goes down to empty but then jumps back up seemingly at random making you feel cheated and alone. The lack of armor penetration really hinders the shotgun on armored enemies as well, due to the relation between armor and the low damage of each pellet.
---
lol Thats not really great. I mean - great that you jump in and take that role, but it sounds like it comes at a cost...
---
No so hidden anymore
---
7% Per piece on DR
---
15% per piece on RR
---
ER I don't know
---
Thx ‚ô°
---
Me as well I try and run it with cavs and PR/RR it‚Äôs a good setup if you don‚Äôt like bloodied builds
---
Each quest has its own loopholes for getting those items out. Sometimes you can leave the quest, sometimes you can get them after the correct quest stage.
---
I'm not sure if those even get added to your inventory.
---
Is it too late to get it?
---
Because I was drunk when I wrote that and didn't think hard enough about it.
---
In other words, yeah, you're right, sorry.
---
Can‚Äôt bring myself to do a bloodied build. Thought/hoped this would be a nice alternative.
---
I have no regrets but the market is catching up to the VE vanguard stuff so it‚Äôs becoming pricey
---
I gave an explanation. I've been all over the U.S and never seen foreign flags flying so the likelyhood of seeing then all over the wastes of America is slim and also in the midst of the Great War in Fallout history it's not likely that people would by flying foreign flags all over the U.S either. Your "cheese moon" argument isnt comparable and you have no counter point. Its not that serious.
---
It works from level 1 to level 50.
---
At low levels, stay at maximum effective range and kill them as they walk towards you.
---
Max Covert Operative and Mister Sandman ASAP.
---
Grab Escape Artist to reapply stealth every 5 seconds (super op).
---
High Agility boosts your stealth without need for the perk card.
---
Tbh, you can kill most enemies in 1 shot without any %damage perks if you get that sweet x3.5 sneak attack bonus.
---
Hasn't released yet, the new update is tomorrow, but we don't know when it will go live, I assume on a Tuesday
---
Because you like it and are having fun, that is the only reason you need.
---
roflol not an alt .
---
Oh no! Thankfully I got a 2* vanguard +strength chest in an SBQ drop, or else I might not be trying to pursue this at all.
---
I'm pretty sure i read recently that they're having a free trial for people to check it out this weekend and running double XP at the same time.
---
Stolen valor! üëè
---
They pull up with some airships and then we‚Äôll have the audacity to claim cosplay. After sleeping in their bunks.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gamespot.com/amp-articles/fallout-76-update-16-hits-soon-with-solo-play-fest/1100-6471947/
---
You can't dodge the negatives of Junkies anywhere near as easily as you can almost fully negate the negatives of mutations.
---
Well heck that would be something to look out for, I'll see wheter its true come weekend
---
Like how? Burning down the competition with low, low prices?
---
Nice! That sounds like a pretty well rounded set!
---
they claimed to know that people want faction pvp, and insist the questline for Wastelanders will have genuine choice and consequence. so, a faction based pvp that uses the faction you chose to help (similar to WoW's "alliance vs horde" thing) would be pretty great.
---
also, love that pic.
---
I just assumed my wife turned all the TP over in game as she does in real life, because she's a psychopath.
---
Thetans.  I want to meet Thetans.
---
My last post has a link for info.
---
I hope they get it figured out. Im almost over hyped to be point Im nearly in disbelief. Im so used to the empty nothingness I dont know if Ill be able to survive WITH npc.
---
Yeah I've just checked free to play from 12th til 16th. Good news!
---
I have a junkies build. Sorry to burst your bubble but if you use the optimal 5 chems then the negative effects still arent as bad as the negatives with mutation even with class freak 3. I've compared them myself.
---
There's your chance then, hope it works for you.
---
IIRC there's at least 5
---
What other location?
---
They randomly bloom at night near Dyer Chemical, not always when heart of the Swamp event is happening, since the last update, the event sometimes pops in the middle of the day, and no blooms appear.
---
i mean so long as you aren't hurting anyone besides yourself
---
Heh, Puritan‚Äôs items sounds nice
---
Found last night at Lewis and Sons Farming Supply as a mod in the barn  with the power armor stand.
---
Well I‚Äôll be damned. I didn‚Äôt think about that. When I ran the event to finish my quest, someone nuked the event. I kinda got pissed cuz it crashed the server, but I completed the event (and landed the fixer plan). So I guess that guy was actually helping?
---
I have GTX 760 with 2 gb vram,  i5 4440, 8gb ddr3 ram
---
And I can run this game with steady fps on lowest
---
I always get combat pieces off her which doesn‚Äôt really fit in with my forest setup lol. I had to buy my stuff and the chest was the most costly at 10k but well worth it with limbs coming in around 2k. This was before the market had demand for it luckily.
---
go to map76 dot com and search: Swamp Pod
---
happy hunting!
---
I meam code cruncher i cant get it ive hacked over 50 terminals
---
Yeah, turrets seem really unreliable. It also takes like two shots and 1 swing to destroy them. They seem under-powered, and I wish we had wall turrets that can scan all directions. Not just a 60 degree view in front of them.
---
I have my camp in the Mire just to the right of a collapsed bridge... there's occasionally a super mutant or scorched conqueror that stands on it, sniping my camp. Turrets can't even engage them from that distance either, kind of obnoxious.
---
Place it in a box ASAP. 9/10 someone puts down their forward camp at the fight. Server hopping will prevent them from being destroyed on death.
---
I'm pretty sure the mechanic is to prevent people from farming Flux with afk lowbies. Not like it grants enough to make this viable, anyways.
---
On Xbox, there is a setting for Auto Update, but you will also need to leave your Console powered on, I never shut mine off unless it needs rebooted, and they are on a UPS, works every time.
---
Just say you have a head injury from an accident- that kind of covers it.
---
Yes, how dare they focus on releasing the Christmas event and working towards an immensely large overhaul of the game and our first major dlc instead of adding a relatively insignificant mod to a weapon almost no one in the game uses. 
---
Lol. The absolute laziness of people indeed.
---
 [https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri)
---
add in some challenges and that'd be perfect. "kill X scorchbeasts in one life before reset, get a power armor paintjob", "kill X players in one life, get a trophy for your camp", etc.
---
if you have played all the previous Fallout's then this one will be sure to please you even more, especially if you enjoyed the crafting aspect of it. I played 3, NV, 4 and now 76 and love them all
---
i'm 37 and like you have had my fill of COD's and Battlefield, I like playing games that have a "your own pace" feel to them. Fallout 76 is pretty much an online survival version of Fallout 4, with a map that is over 4x as big. There is no shortage of exploring. 
---
when i first starting playing, about a year ago, getting my character through the first 15-20 levels was making me pull my hair out, mind you i was not used to the survival aspect so some adjusting was required. my character is now level 13 and still loving it. The upcoming double XP weekend i'm thinking about making a second character.
---
PM if you want my gamertag
---
Yeah. Right now I just have all weightless and want to try something different... hopefully better. :)
---
vampire on the right weapon (faster swing speed on a meele for example) are great for ‚Äúclean living‚Äù build.
---
Idk energy explosions must count different. BE laser rifle will melt my foes and I kill myself with BE Gatling plasma all the time on SBQ people jump in front of me lol
---
A survival mode designed to be about survival, you are out of your mind my good sir! But yea sounds nice if it was a real survival experience.
---
Best of luck to you especially if your hunting for WR pieces.
---
It does. Every time you go to a new world or login it just resets
---
Me!!!!!!
---
I'm hoping to see "ghouls" in the making, not quite ghoul, but not quite human either.  No, not scorched, ghouls.  I'd love to see burnt humans, blind humans, and cancer-ridden humans.  I know that all sounds morbid, but let's face it, that is what we would likely be facing in reality (except for the ghouls).  I also want to hear how they survived, see their basements, or other hiding places which kept them alive.  I want to meet the crazies whose minds left them from knowing everyone they love is dead, I want to meet the psychopaths who are trying to force their version of law on people (early raiders), I just want to meet everyone!
---
Better idea: Give mutations a visual apperance so people can become ghouls and noone runs around like stupid superheroes :) People who hate ghouls never going to use mutations at all and everything is bingo bongo
---
I can answer the 2nd
---
CHA 20, prices won't getting better going higher OR by adding HB3
---
Thanks. No I‚Äôm good with weapon reduction because I have all reduced weight weapons üòâ
---
Thanks that is a good start.
---
i read the description up to 'we are all royalty' ..... and then left the group.
---
Yeah.  I wouldn't mind having the antlers from last year, or a Santa hat, but that's about it.
---
Icicle lights are going to be a rare drop from the presents, so those will probably look cool.
---
Glad to help, have a good one in the wasteland
---
Good question !
---
YES!
---
It's a cool little skipjack right off the field of Charleston train station.  Wish they would open up the cabin though.
---
I'm pretty much the same.  I hop in now and then, but the vast nothingness has gotten tedious.
---
This is a widespread delusion. It actually does hide you from NPCs, I did test it. 
---
I equipped 5 chameleon pieces, found a solitary high level turret and stealthily approached it very close (about 1-2 meters). Then, staying crounched, I started unequipping armor pieces one by one.
---
With every armor piece removed, brackets around my [ HIDDEN ] status were moving, and I went to [ CAUTION ] and then to [ DANGER ].
---
And no, it wasn't just "turret noticing me over time". I did the test several times, and while being in [ CAUTION ] already, when I reequipped the chamdleon armor pieces, I quickly moved to [ HIDDEN ] status again.
---
It is not a very difficult test, and you could do it on your own just to make sure.
---
Yes
---
What about blowing up cars in their vicinity?
---
And you have to do like 1500 in order to get loot from her
---
I hope they do come back so I can muder all of them like I allways do,lol
---
Thanks that‚Äôs good to know. Looks like maybe there‚Äôs something (like a combination of settings) not working with my particular character.
---
What‚Äôs on it?
---
i bought a single month of it, and i feel it was worth it. i don't plan on getting another month until they add more to it.
---
i like the "social" aspect of 76, so private worlds mean nothing to me. at most, it's nice to use them to quick do something without worrying about server stability. but i usually just go to adventure mode.
---
i tend to use my scrap almost immediately to make ammo or repair items. anything i can't use, i bulk and sell once i hit over 75. so the scrap box is worthless to me.
---
and since i have plenty of caps, the fast travel survival tent isn't worth much as i don't mind blowing the 20-30 caps going to the purveyor.
---
however, the 1650 atoms, ranger skin (plus the armored variant that was available this month), and dance emotes, i felt were worth a one-time 13 dollar purchase.
---
since after this, all the membership would give me is more atoms, more variations of the ranger outfit, and continued access to three things i don't really need, i don't see the reason to stay subscribed. but maybe for you, those things ARE worth the money.
---
TL;Dr- whether it's worth it or not depends on what you want out of 76, and if you'd be willing to pay for those things that it gives you. but i can say with confidence, everything has worked as advertised since i got it.
---
Dailies are trash. Repeatable quests are not what people want when playing fallout.
---
 Raiders and rose quests please
---
So we can always ask for a fix?
---
I haven't played FO76 in about 2 or 3 months. Are they seriously going to add "people" in the game play you can interact with? This would be awesome!
---
I'd have to get my mules out and find it. I have a full set.
---
Yeah doing nothing is always more fun with friends
---
The sneaky playstyle starts to work as soon as you get a silencer for your guns and take the sneakysniper perks.
---
You will need Covert Ops, and Escape Artist to really start being a sneak.   The perk Sneak helps, but is not required.  
---
Also get a surpressor for your rifle/pistol.  If you dont have a silent gun, you cant be a sneak.
---
I'm sure they're equally as tired of people demanding stuff be released just because it was data mined by someone poking their nose where it didn't belong.
---
I rock melon juice and the photosynthetic perk under END, so my health constantly replenishes keeping you nice and healthy for the Vanguard pieces. I rarely use stims, in fact I only carry about 5-10 on me at all times.
---
lol Kinda sounds that way... Esp if you got that plan. That would be awesome. That's on my Christmas list.
---
Free States!
---
There's actually a 9-sq option that pops up after you press the alt option when hovering over that item
---
Dude just look at your NW .44 skin then you can realize laziness of Bethesda
---
But wouldn‚Äôt the healing factor mutation take care of all that?
---
If you get the year sub, you get 19k atoms, fo wgat you would've paid for 10k.(over 12 months obv.
---
 That, and the stash box is a life changer
---
You see, Preston is obsessed with saving settlements and he couldn't just have the ones in the present, he needed to save the ones from the past too. Using institute technology, Preston time traveled to the past to save the settlements in that time too.
---
i keep forgetting about that room. what the hell, MODUS? you made me a general! let me in!
---
I started as a shotgunner on my main, morphed into a rifleman
---
Never is the time.  Go home Bethesda, your drunk again.
---
Is it a free trial character? There was an issue with some trophies not unlocking if you played the free trial, bought the game, and used the same character in the full game. Making a new character was the only fix for that. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case for you or if it was fixed.
---
Can't argue about laziness however your voice wont be received as constructive so I don't know what your trying to accomplish.
---
Oh thats conforting, I will see this weekend when the free trial happens!
---
Just go to whitesprings,  clubhouse, bottom floor, locker room.  Always one unless it‚Äôs been recently killed.
---
Also Freddy fears.  
---
Two easiest to find imo.
---
"who gave you the right to wear our colors!?"
---
"the scorchbeast queen, when i killed her for you after you almost all died out being terrible at your job."
---
"...fair enough."
---
No but it was made on launch day (full game)
---
I enjoy this sub on updates. All the angry internet edgelords come out from under a rock with essays about how bethesda is bad bc (insert content of newest update) and we as players are idiots, whales, and trash for playing a game we enjoy.
---
These ppl literaly never played or quit and only come on to spew hate and trash a game and player base. Updates are more of a drug to them than me it seem.
---
A lot of people want this. Not a bad idea. Imagine the camp possibilities, too. Like making a shooting range, or karate studio
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
and how would one do that
---
Healing from the mutation only takes place out of combat, I'm not sure about the juice or card
---
Welcome to our world.  
---
I think you'll find a lot of the internet outrage is just that.  Internet.  
---
Take it with a grain of salt.  While, yea, there are issues - I've never played a game that didn't have them.  For the most part, their effect is not as bad as one might think.
---
As a new player, you should likely stay in the forest (green area on the left side of the map) until at least L15-20.  Venturing outside of that will get you into places you are not yet equipped to be.
---
  The map is divide into different areas, with enemies geared to certain level ranges.  While you can go anywhere on the map at any time, you will likely be quicky overwhelmed if you are under leveled for the area - as you found out when you visited grafton.
---
In general, the center (savage divide) and east Mire and bog) side of the map are higher level areas (L45+).  The left side (Forest), is L1-20ish.  The north (toxic valley) is L20-30, and the south (ash heap) is L30-40.
---
For now, follow the overseers quest - it will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas, and lead you to the main questlines you'll need to complete.  Along the way, you will run across many side quests.
---
Most high levels will help you if you need it.  
---
  If you have a mic, use it.  Much easier for other players to figure out what help you may/may not need, and for you to help other players (don't worry, that day will come).
---
You're probably right.  After all, it came from Fallout 4 and it must have had some kind of effect on NPCs there.  I inferred that because it didn't alter detection or sneak properties that it didn't contribute to stealth, but that would logically be the case because it does nothing to help when you're in motion anyway.  If you're standing still, it should keep you in stealth.
---
Its worth it. I dont have hard facts. But being full health and knowing you can take a few extra hits before health stops dropping is nice. Just cant use Bloodied. So the vanguard strat is to stay alive and deal above average damage. Whereas bloodied is risk near death for highest damage output. 
---
If you're not worried about min maxing damage, vanguard is a cozy lifestyle outside Power Armor.
---
Good point
---
F76 is only money cow for Bethesda they don't have care about the game they don't even play it themselves otherwise we didn't have simple trade glitch after 2 months with no fix.its my right to be able play with any weapon or play style I like but I have to stick to my Handmade because other weapon types are shit.i like crossbow I like pistols but they are only joke in this game
---
I am overwhelmed with excitement! But I also have my concerns as well! 
---
I am hoping that Bethesda will add all the missing lore to the game surrounding the real history of west Virginia, in addition to adding some crazy ass rednecks at some of the distillerys locations around the map. 
---
Don't get me wrong they did do a fanominal job with the majority of the history, but after watching plenty of PBS Documentaries, there are personally a lot of missing links. 
---
My two biggest concerns  at this point are. Game stability, and  is Bethesda going to throw us another fast ball, and make us pay for the addition for the wastelanders? 
---
I know some will say, they are not going to bill us for this "DLC" but I do remember a time that someone said there will be no additional charges to us after purchasing the game, and we got nailed with fallout 1st memberships. 
---
In my opinion I could see the wastelanders being only for fallout 1st subscribers on private servers, to help with game stability. 
---
And if that is the case. I personally am not going to be to happy after buying this game for  $200 CAD power armor addition, not including supporting the Atomic shop from the beginning spending another $100 CAD  to being slapped in the face with the fallout 1st membership after what I have all ready spent, as well as others. Not to mention all the issues with the game from launch. 
---
I find it funny now, if I  would have waited until now to purchase the game for $20.00 CAD and then purchased  the Fallout 1st membership. I would have saved close  to $200 CAD and received twice the amount of atoms in one year, then purchasing the single amount of atoms at $ 49.99 CAD twice. The Fallout 1st membership gives you around 19,200 atoms a year for the same price. 
---
I ask what is wrong with that picture! I guess lessons learned. Lol. 
---
Nonetheless, I hope I am terribly wrong, I  really want to move forward from all the poor behaviors of Bethesda, and concentrate on a positive community connections. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
CAMP Megaton anyone?
---
Couple of months ago I picked up an explosive AA combat shotgun, and was prepared to rule the world. Really didn't work well for me, not enough damage, too easy to get swarmed. (I'm not in PA, so getting swarmed is a big deal to me).
---
Now I run unarmed melee, with an AA auto assault rifle unperked as a secondary weapon.
---
How cool would that be lol
---
What's your current build?
---
If they did this for atoms I'd use actual money for once. I have gotten bored so many times and just stood in my camp while on my phone and would love something like those 2 to potter about with.
---
Personally, I have little to sell anymore.  My characters are fairly satiated, so I don't have much of a reason to go Legendary hunting.
---
Stuff sits for a long time, too.  Buyers seem to want either cheap scrip or perfection, with nothing in between anymore.
---
Wow, yes. That sounds awesome.
---
Excellent. Thanks. That having been said, do you have any vanguard limbs to sell on PS4? üòÄüòÄ
---
This
---
The *date* or the *time*?
---
Lol nah I'm on xbox. But I run 4 vanguard pieces and 1 chameleon for a little stealth boost. üòÅ
---
Both. I'll get a screenshot to share with you next time I can get it to happen
---
Lots  took breaks also until Wastelanders comes out
---
It's your right to have not purchased or played the game at all that's about it. I'm not overly happy with the game but hey this game was developed in only a year what can you expect. Not defending Beth but not going to cry over it.
---
Yes, when you start moving, then it probably doesn't help you much with NPC detection. Then it is ptobably determined by your Agility, Sneak perk cards, "Hatder to detect while sneaking" legendary modifier (the tertiary one), your armor being Muffled and so on.
---
üëçüëç
---
Really?
---
That would indicate the player base has died finally.  
---
Nobody making alts or using nonperfect gear is a sure sign. 
---
I know , when I‚Äôm playing, I do alts, and you need low to mid tier gear to gradually level up.
---
Hell, my lvl 52 bloody commando is running around without anything but basic 1* unyielding pieces and a bloody 1* handmade because of that (well, been gathering dust but, yeah).
---
Yeah that's the reason I only get online for trading for 2 months
---
Ffxiv added simalar to this b4 i stopped playing. It was a object you hit that was scaled to a raid or trial.
---
 Basicly you whacked at it for a few minutes and if you took all its health it was a good sign you were ready for that challenge. If not, go work on rotation, gear, etc till you could.
---
I think Bethesda went the wrong direction with survival mode. Allowing folks to use existing characters was a mistake. Force people to have separate characters maybe even add a season mode to earn rewards for adventure mode.
---
Yup, when they decided to cap the damage, they basically were saying, "Bloodied shouldn't be in PVP, it's just PvE."
---
In all honesty, "legendary or Magic" weapons are the bane of PVP. I think a lot more people would be up for it, if we were all on a more even playing ground when it comes to weapons. If everyone just had regular shot weapons, it would be more fun and more "skill" based than who has the best "effect". 
---
Now, I don't want legendary weapons erased from the game, because they do provide some nice build varieties from them. But they should have programmed in some way to make it so that they are only "activated" on PvE attacks, and when it's against another player, it's just that base weapon class, with no extra effects. 
---
Armor can keep it's buffs and whatnot, as that would still make everyone want to go for whatever type, and could make PvP interesting and make you figure out your opponents weakness. But weapon effects, to me, sour the whole PvP experience.
---
Depends on the day.  Different people, different servers, different prices for different stuff.
---
Just like shopping IRL :)
---
Maybe you hit my camp over the weekend - it was a 2 day redesign and renovation project, done one piece at a time...  so much stuff scattered everywhere looked like a tornado went through.
---
This 100
---
I'd settle for being limited to a mere two turrets if they shot things at the range NPC-owned turrets do and used explosive bullets like NPC-owned turrets do. I guess we got the Bethesda-branded knock-off turrets instead of the genuine article used by the rest of the Wasteland.
---
My suggestion would be to make the reception room smaller, and make the studio, maybe 1 third smaller, then you will have more decoration budget, and less empty space.
---
Personally I have my reasons for not playing anymore. I will come back for Wastelanders if it isn't a pay wall that's about it
---
Is it new?  I used energy weapons on her all the time never encountered this. But I havent tried to fight her in a couple months. 
---
How does this happen?  Help cause I'm about to start trying to kill her again and I use plasma rifle almost exclusively on her lol
---
I found my executioner gamma melts bloody builds.
---
I would even be happy with something like that. Plus it would help debunk so myths about certain legendaries not working properly. An NPC that regenerates health when it gets to 0 would be pretty handy as long as you could give them legendary armor and adjust their level or base HP but intimate objects would be just as useful for non legendaries or something
---
so did at least one other member of the BoS. I doubt they'd do that after all there was no way to get approval and we gave them a lot of technical documents. The Appalachian chapter would approve I'd say, they're one of the most easy going of all chapters.
---
I miss my Nocturnal Drill drops.

"It caps out at a "Modified" to 25, including "Hard Bargain" bonuses.
---
In testing taking it to 39 did not change the Sell or Buy values of anything, regardless if the base price was 1 cap or 1,400 caps.
---
-Aten_Ra"
---
Two shot got nerfed a while back. I have a two shot lever but it's my back up to my instigating and my quad. You're probably better off with the junkies. The damage in your pip boy is probably correct for the two shot too.
---
Thanks ! Yeah going forward I'm gsnna scale back my ideas and start small so I can get idea of what costs what.
---
We are in a huge content drought atm, last content added was vault raid months ago(?). Seasonal events do not count bc they are just one event for a week.
---
 Everyone is ready for wastelanders, but it got delayed so many are playing new star wars or outer worlds till it comes out and pop in from time to time.
---
Maybe they could have been hunting a sea monster. The end of the quest would be similar to encryptid, trigger an event to fight a sea monster as hard as the SQB.
---
Tell us your platform....
---
You may find plans in player vendor machines for a lot less than you can buy the pieces.
---
Oh man, i thought i got myself a good deal, only 700 caps :( Oh well, thanks for your reply :D
---
Depends, u on pc?
---
That is an amazing shot. I'm eager to see what factions we get. Hopefully more than just "settlers vs raiders"
---
That would too, yes. There are many options you can employ. I also don‚Äôt want to lose effectiveness of radaway or radx
---
I was running the game on an HP Spectre with integrated I7 for quite a while. Just had to downscale the resolution to 640x400 and run the game in fullscreen mode

Lol they can be plentiful. Do they cap off at your level??

Same here
---
The way people on Reddit say get this or get that, makes it sound like you just go buy them somewhere like a burger, choose the \* you want and effect simples?
---
I've hardly seen anything decent in vendors, vendor bots or as drops, especially not the purveyor. I must be playing a different game
---
You should have feed them
---
That makes sense. I have been scrapping away and have yet to earn it so i was hoping to expedite the process. Oh well.  I'll keep at it then. Thank you.
---
Pc here.  Ty tho
---
Nobody is gonna say it ?Because the dupers are gone ( i miss em much) items become more and more rare, caps more worthless all the time.
---
You know its like that
---
The strangler heart cosmetic is just the base standard paint style on the armour
---
Also, deathclaw gauntlet, meat hook, no clunking, no fusion cores and most of all none of that sweaty jockstrap smell!
---
Did they actually ban them or does it seem like they just got bored and moved on?
---
Yeah, I quit for 8 months.  Dipped my toe back in recently, and it's maddening to think there's no way to fix this without grinding out dozens of levels.
---
A little of both i think
---
I use the same style hunting rifle 2 but I have a automatic shotgun for my quick switch backup seems to help a lot
---
Oh i doubt they even thought that far ahead but i push your sentiment to the top
---
Yup have that issue, i just scrapped mine and am now enjoying the freed up camp budget, its not the solution to a shitty bug but sure i take the gains from it where i can!
---
I actually love the way that story line ended. Not at all what I expected.
---
They went wrong in many aspects
---
Junkies. Two shot only does a 25% boost assuming both shots hit iirc
---
Underrated comment right here
---
Grafton, but don't even bother crafting anything until you're 50+. Waste of time.
---
That would be great
---
I want to find the asshat who keeps digging up that corpse in Grafton.
---
This isn't a time of year that I can play consistently.
---
Almost seems like Zax is really Todd
---
From the Christmas Event Rewards preview picture - We have Winter Metal Armor Paint, Presents (Stashbox or Death/drop bag?), Winter Cap (Beanie), Winter Jacket and Jeans variant, and the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree. That's 5. The Stash box the tree is on thats one of the normal rewards right? Did i miss anything? Wonder what the 6th reward will be.
---
Make Mistress of Mysteries a faction.
---
Fantastic work - thanks for sharing your efforts - very handy
---
Thats a good point to bring up. Most prewar npcs are ghoulified by the time we interact with them so having NPC‚Äôs that would have been around before the bombs dropped will add some interesting storyline. I hope Bethesda captures that by adding dialogue options that involve prewar facts.
---
I mean perk wise
---
My first build was melee, so I did a commando on my second build. I like the idea of having two opposite builds so I can make better use of the weapons I find instead of having both toons compete for the same kind of weapon. 
---
With the advent of private worlds you can also exchange items between characters much easier than before. The blue suitcase outside of Whitespring Station is a good place to offload items if you need to swap from one character to another. The private world needs to either be yours, or a friends (who will not exit it while you're exchanging items), and you'll have a few minutes to switch characters and be able to get back onto the same private world before it's terminated.
---
This works, temporarily.
---
I was thinking that it had something to do with turrets accidentally damaging each other when mobs were around, but having seen no shortage of other people's turrets attacking walls, resource miners, and other non-attacking camp parts, I'm kind of at a loss at this point to explain how it's happening.
---
Mine attacks my scrap bot. Poor little feller.
---
At the very least the overseer. A responder survivor like one who finally took cover from the scorched would be cool.
---
Even if they could just work in some kind of week long grind to respec it‚Äôd definitely increase participation
---
It's never officially declared that you're American. The entire point of Fallout is RPG. You decide on your character's backstory and why they ended up in 76. I made my own guy come from Europe before being conscripted into the US Army. Maybe he wants the flag of his home country in his camp?
---
I can help ya when your on if you‚Äôre on Xbox. I‚Äôve leveled up quite a few people. We can do my usual leveling routes which don‚Äôt take very long.
---
To add to this, I mean ghouls in previous fallout titles not in 76.
---
Pre-War Ghouls: Am I a joke to you?
---
I lthink initially it will be one big questline and a few side quests but they will add quests and random encounters as they go. I doubt it will be added all at once.
---
With rank 3 sneak and 8 agility I can almost touch a sleeping sheepsquatch without it notice me.. imo you should have something else benefiting you unless you wanna use Special point for something else instead of sneak :)
---
WV is landlocked though? How would a submariner get there?
---
I'd swear my shotgun now has a hidden "Enemy Healing" attribute on it... It's like gambling whenever I bring out my shotty. He's dead! Nope alive, and more health than before, WTF?
---
The elder scrolls online version is purchasable with in game currency?
---
Huh.
---
This is the only answer. Fuck em.
---
The Combat Rifle can also be a mean machine if you mod it up, and generally much cheaper than the Handmade or Fixer.  I have a JE variant with the Tweaked receiver and it certainly holds it's own.
---
Grahm carries the light combat armor plans.
---
I'm much more interested in three-star level one drops these days than max level drops. It's much rarer to find, and I already have enough high level stuff.
---
Entirely unnecessary.
---
What's the trade off for the % boost? You can't suppress the negative effects of the mutation?
---
It'd be interesting to meet an NPC like the survivalist from honest hearts in NV. Those holotapes or journals or whatever they were (it's been a while since ive played NV) were some of my favorite pieces of lore in any game ever. And now, I'd Bethesda does it right, we have potential to meet characters who were in a similar position... I really hope they don't screw it up.
---
I've wondered how well a combat rifle would work for that, I assumed it would be comparable, but haven't ever looked into it closely.  If I run across one of those, I'll pick it up and give it a try!
---
Sadly, the only time I see junkie's items for sale (outside my own vendors), it's on buzzblades or boxing gloves.  People seem to be hoarding them since they're becoming more acceptable.
---
Deadass
---
The problem is people only buy to flip anymore, so I stopped putting my good stuff in the vendor, no one buys it at reasonable prices. They say "15k caps for a JE shotgun??" Not realizing that that's a good price compared to the player market lol
---
Wait for the weekend and blow out with the double xp
---
Ah okay, thank you! :D
---
Is there an update today?
---
We‚Äôre not actually military. We‚Äôre in a lot of other clubs, which we help with bos level protected technology. We got in by stealing and lying. We‚Äôre literally blowing everything up with nukes. Major plot-holes, cats and dogs sleeping together.
---
 If they come back im sure they‚Äôll not care. Ill have fun playing it anyway. But i also have fun giving bethesda shit for this awful writing.
---
As someone who has taken multiple days off work in the past for gaming expansions, I wholeheartedly approve of your actions.
---
As long as I've been working (and that's a LONG time...) no one I've worked with would have ever understood the concept.  It wouldn't have been a problem, but I'd have gotten funny looks.
---
Then again, when I was young enough to pull it off, games were not in color :P  And now, I'm too old to get accepted as a 'gamer'.  So I just lie about it ;-)
---
Tomorrow. Update 16
---
Just curious, what's keeping you from trying your own?
---
Thanks
---
I'm still working on learning all the mods for it, but it has certainly worked out well so far. And .45 ammo hasn't been that hard to keep in stock by crafting or from folks vendors.
---
Ever since addictions became permanent there have been a lot of converts because it's easy to maintain once you get the addictions you want. I was on the fence until I read the Junkies guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs\_junkie\_guide\_or\_how\_i\_learned\_to\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/) (by /u/Yabvone)
---
Bush wookie method! I just hide in bushes and then hop out towards the end to steal last couple kills
---
I do t have the recipes for orange/grape Nuka Cola. Where do you get those?
---
Hacked seems like the most logical answer.  You can try putting in a ticket, but it will probably take a lot of pushing and yelling for them to do anything about it, if they even bother (and it can be done, but few people ever get that far).
---
How do you have all the perks before level 50 I have a learning disability I made a new level 4 trying to make a bloody commando build
---
You need to add lights. Construction lights are really good, spotlights might also do the trick, but the gist of it is that the game seems to use lighting when it calculates whether the turret AI can acquire a target; poor lighting, lower chance of turrets going pew pew pew.
---
I'd love to read it.
---
Junkies is the best build IMO. I‚Äôm rocking 5 addictions for that sweet 50% damage bonus
---
I am not sure if you can since many of them a gated by level.
---
This is my plan when double xp hits. Gonna get me at least one reward this time
---
Lol I can‚Äôt wait for it man! Going to grind for those rewards
---
No formula. You can buy them for about 30 caps each at the soda bar, 2nd floor white springs.
---
Awesome! Yeah, i think it‚Äôs great too, i was bloodied but got so fed up of dying, then trying to irradiate myself to get better damage. It wasn‚Äôt fun, but the damage output was insane. Junkie‚Äôs is so good, as you get full health and 50% extra damage. A lot more fun for sure :D
---
Kinda what I figured.. man talk about unfortunate
---
I actually tired that before and the light don't spot them unless they are like 2 feet away or when I'm being shot at
---
This!
---
Yeah that's a decent write up, saving that for future reference.
---
I have all the addictions set up (not ideal yet, but good enough).  It's not bad at all, I don't notice the negative stats at all.  
---
For now I'm running either a zealots or instigating handmade (whichever is appropriate) with the -25% AP effect to get a 0 AP setup (highly recommended by the way).  Until I get the junkie's one, then I'm pretty much all set.
---
XP gains for kills aren't much. focus on staying alive as long as possible, and hope you're in a team that is really good. if you want to feel useful, make yourself the team medic or something lol
---
Thank ye. This really helped
---
I just hope that their stories aren't boring. But I'm pretty exited.
---
I really CBA with the Nucleur winter mode but I bet I'll have to hide in bushes to get some camp items.
---
Ouch. I feel for you. Hope you find out!
---
If you are on Xbox I can give you some stuff
---
This \^\^ 
---
I hardly bother visiting player camps anymore, finally bit the bullet purchased 1st so now I play a single player version of FO76, I have a nice collection of gear and no longer need bother with other players.
---
I visit Adventure sometimes and may visit a nuke zone.
---
I‚Äôm restarting a bloodied pipe weapon build, currently level 25. I do lots of sneak damage, but get killed fairly easily. It‚Äôs a lot more difficult than my junkie build.
---
It will act as a new campaign for new characters right? I deleted mine after I got bored with the game.
---
The market dropped out of plans and ammo for me, reason I bought 1st, no point interacting with players anymore.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs hard man! Good luck with that :D
---
Merry Christmas on 25th? What‚Äôs next? Measuring distances in miles? Wait...
---
I saw some decent prices on legendaries all above my level though at one shop. Among about five others charging 100 for common trash off the floor. 
---
I even bought some of the lower level stuff that fits my odd builds.
---
Bit late maybe but did it anyways!
---
Bush hiding is fun. I had some matches when people where a foot away from me and didn‚Äôt see me. Or another person almost touched me and walked past me. 
---
I‚Äôm a bush ninja heh

I had a dream last night where some guy invaded one of my workshops, so I killed him and he dropped 1300 lbs of scrap. 
---
He came back after I had miraculously stashed it all, and then tried to glitch through the floor. He made it, so I sealed three layers of concrete on top of him and put keypad doors without power over the exits. 
---
What I'm trying to say is I miss murking people in Survival too.
---
Really appreciate that but I am on PC. I'll just have to grind it out
---
It dropped out a bit for me but once in a while my rare plans are bought or a new player comes and buys a bunch of camp and cheap plans.  The caps are still there but it does take time.
---
&gt; If everyone just had regular shot weapons, it would be more fun and more "skill" based than who has the best "effect"
---
You mean like in NW?
---
Thats right. Mutants be zip zoopin around in 3 dimensions. They‚Äôve got so many advantages. Sometimes you dont want to play god. You want to play steve the vault janitor. He overslept because he was up cleaning the night before reclamation. He also has asthma. Hes too claustrophobic for power armor.

Are they the basic machine gun turrets?  I had two that would attack each other. When I would repair the broken one, they would shoot at each other, but I never did figure out why. I scrapped one and replaced it with a different type of turret, a shotgun, and that seemed to fix it
---
Happy cake day also!
---
Hell yeah! I'm almost 49 and absolutely love playing FO76. I work EMS so my days are mostly 24hr shifts, that gives me plenty of off time to get into the game. You're never too old to game!
---
Can they not use Berry Mentats and see you glowing in NW?
---
I'll need to check, but I may still have a 1\* Junkies Handmade (max lvl) if you're interested (on PS4). Won't be in game until late this evening though...
---
Thanks buddy &lt;3

No respawn IRL.

I also encountered this... took me off guard and right in the feels..
---
Damn...cutting these radioactive onions are something else.

Thats my way of thinking my father in law is well into his 70s and still enjoys playing all his flight sims! Its a great way to relax from a stressful job I work shifts as well.
---
False. They currently are. Just drop the full chassie. They aren't supposed to be tradable though. Since people got the surplus of Vault Steel a bunch crafted a few sets to sell on Ebay.
---
Your Mom's not that bad, give her some respect.
---
You're on Xbox too then! Yeah, it took me off guard also. She was in her camp and I just dropped her some nice stuff because idk what else I could have done :(
---
Thanks, saved to phone so I can track the events as well... I'm not a Nuclear Winter player, but I'm digging the double exp üòÜ
---
Damn... that's really sad.  I hope the player who made this, found some solace and peace in it.
---
Exactly! And I‚Äôve had the same close calls. So thrilling! But twice the other night I won!! And one time it was me and another guy, two people remaining total and I literally had nothing. Saw him creeping in as the circle shrank but I found some corpses including meds and a stealth bot and like predator he saw my invisibility cloak shimmer. Right as he started to shoot I cranked a auto combat rifle mag on him and won üôÇ so gratifying

---
Berry mentats aren't in NW
---
I do too. It must have taken some work. But it's probably the sweetest thing I've seen in the wasteland so far.
---
I'm on PC, I appreciate the offer though.  I'll find one, I'm in no rush at all.  And honestly, as slick as the 0 AP setup is, I might not even end up switching over until I get a junkie's with -25% AP anyway, it might be hard to give that up.
---
Where did this come from?
---
Yep when Wastelanders comes out I will be taking a vacation day!
---
I don‚Äôt think berry mentats is in nuclear winter but I‚Äôm not sure
---
The ones I've seen are all basic turrets, but I have a missile and a basic next to each other, and the basic will go red frequently, but I have seen the missile one go red too.  They don't seem to attack anything on my base (maybe each other a little), but everywhere else I've seen it's the basic ones that seem to be the problem.
---
Honestly, I haven't given NW any try, as I just don't really dig battle royals. But if it's like that... I may one day lol
---
Damn that seriously hit hard.
---
You have to have the right perks to run bloodied and survive; serendipity, evasive, barbarian, dodgy, nerd rage. Unyielding armor to max out the armor bonuses, and sentinel for ranged builds, cavalier for melee builds. I run all this and I hardly ever die, from anything. Except rad damage üòÇ that's the only bane of my existence.

Without knowing more this could be considered cringe

If I remember correctly it's taken from a random note you find out in the wasteland.. beautiful setup tho!

That is really cool

No problem, and happy hunting.

\-25% AP does sound like a great way to go!

Don't bother with turrets, use the the extra build budget for a teddy bear collection that you can enjoy while being ass raped by mole rats.
---
Hm, interesting
---
Honestly i thought the negatives of the mutations would be enough themselves, so i never thought of further offsetting the extra damage. I realize Class Freak does negate a good portion of the negatives, but not all of them, esp for Speed Demon. I guess i'd have to think of something!
---
A lot of people are having their accounts hacked and sold so people can use them for shady stuff. Tell them how long it's been since you were last active and they may be able to give you a rollback save.
---
It can be purchased for [700 crowns](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Crown_Store/Utility/Respecs) (1 crown is worth about as much as 1 atom), not sure if there is an alternative to earn it with gameplay. Edit: it is apparently also possible to pay with gold, it costs 50 per point, depending on how many the player has in total, not the amount moved.
---
Oh, I've not played NW but may give it a go and hide in a bush.
---
I always felt like skins/cosmetics should cost around a buck.  Digital media prices for a large company seem pretty gougey.
---
My only character (besides a mule) is lvl 345. Can be turned into any combo of heavy gunner/shotgunner + commando/rifleman by switching cards.
---
Max strength for maxed heavy guns or shotgun perks. 12 perks in perception for maxed rifleman or commando damage perks. 3 in endurance for fireproof. 4 in charisma (lone wanderer and tenderizer). 8 in intelligence for maxed damage (nerd rage and demo expert). Maxed serendipity, bloody mess and starched genes in luck.
---
Armor is a mix of uny/sent, ass/sent and cham/sent. Also have full set of ass/sent for pvp.
---
Weapons are my main focus and I like big numbers. I carry these with me at all times (currently heavy gunner + rifleman):
---
B10 fixer
---
BE90 gatling gun
---
BE15 gatling plasma
---
BE90 lever action
---
BE gatling laser
---
TSE90 laser rifle
---
BE ultracite laser rifle
---
B25 tesla
---
BSS+1strength ski sword
---
I enjoy alot :)
---
Yeah I've definitely done it but my group rushed us through it so I don't remember reading any of the notes :( but I am going to go back on my alt and try it!
---
Honestly the best tactic. Crouch in a good bush, watch some TV, and wait until you get murdered
---
Fantastic build... I'm really digging the junkyard esthetics you have going! Bonus points for using old school generators and not cheeping out with a fusion reactor.
---
He is not yours any more. He belongs now, to the Flatwoods Monster [from the looks of it].
---
Bless the poor babies who down vote any mention of bloodied builds.. get a life lol!
---
It's all about you isn't it?
---
  If I were a Bethesda employee I wouldn't even read reddit because of ass hats demanding this and demanding that all the while calling them names.
---
Sadly there is no actual stealth mechanic in NW so mobs can easily see you too.
---
Probably because there ISN'T anything that runs counter to that view... the game is a cash-grabby pile of bug filled trash and you took the bait like flies to shit
---
How do you get all those perks. Before level 50 I started a level 5 and I have a learning disability
---
Aliens sure love to kidnap cows.
---
&gt; Presents (Stashbox or Death/drop bag?)
---
That's my hope. Plus [You‚Äôll also get some wrapping paper so that you can craft a few Holiday Gifts of your own to share with your fellow Dwellers.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights) Makes me think that dropbags that are presents will be a thing...but that seems separate from NW...
---
Yes because I paid for this game and im expecting true support from developer like other companies.for example Ubisoft added acog to bosg shotgun just because of one streamer request but Bethesda??lol I just ask complete game
---
Oh fuck I thought it was a ghost but it's just possessed
---
I payed for this game as well. I even bought the fallout 1st.
---
 Do you see me making childish posts demanding things from Bethesda?
---
I see substantially more consensus violence events in my near future. Thanks!

DON'T DRINK THE MILK!
---
No because you get used to incomplete game and ton of bugs but I didn't
---
Yes, it's Fallout 76. Spot on.
---
You can look up which perk unlocks at what level, for my first few characters i used nukes &amp; dragons. You can put together the build you want there.
---
Happy cake day! üç∞

So you think by making posts like these it's going to change anything?

 You come off like a spoiled brat having a temper tantrum.

Hey There, Would it be alright if I add this image to the home page of https://nukacrypt.com? (with credit of course!) Its really well done and gives a clear over-view of whats to come for the month!
---
Send them a support ticket and tell them you bought something by mistake. They'll refund the caps and let you keep whatever it was.
---
Maybe the next major update after wastelanders will have to do with the brotherhood and enclave. If it is, hopefully we‚Äôll get an explanation for those craters near fort defiance
---
My character was level 126 at the time this happened. :)

---
Well now, isn't that something. I now know what I'll be looking into once I'm back in game. Thanks!
---
That's great info thanks! Seems much more doable than I first thought. So, grind up-to 14k for the Halloween stuff. Has it been confirmed what the top XP amount is for the Chrimbo rewards? Prob the same? Cheers!
---
No until players like you support Bethesda
---
Ah that's a good idea mate thanks !
---
Led Zeppelin - Thank You
---
The way you added *upstanding* member of the community there... Makes me feel like my highly-irradiated, heavily mutated former Vault-Dweller *isn't* an upstanding member of the community.
---
I'll have you know good sir 
---
*Jumps ten feet into the air*
---
I am quite upstanding
---
*Takes ten minutes to land*
---
And I am quite offended
---
*Exudes radiation silently*
---
I mean, there's already legendary effects like furious, anti armor, instigating and 2 shot that don't require specific perks or mutations to leverage...
---
Thank you so very much!   I didn't even realize it was today!  How do you see it on a profile, I didn't see mine!?
---
Dataminers have revealed some things that lead many to the conclusion that they may have a presence. Also the Art for Wastelanders depicts someone in an X-01 PA suit with a Plasmacaster that just screams Enclave at first glance. We'll have to wait and see! Secret service being involved also kinda suggests it for the fact that the Oval Office is in the bunker controlled by the Enclave.
---
Hey we did all the necessary tests to become military. Maybe they shouldn't have made it so easy
---
Low and mid level stuff is torn to sell. If you price it anywhere closer to what it's worth it'll sit there taking up space because low level players can't afford it. If you make it cheap enough for them, some high level player will just buy it all for scrip.
---
Now I just scrip it all myself or give it to one of my low level alts.
---
Maybe it's time you took a break from the game for a while then.  You obviously aren't content with what you have so go find something else to play for a while.
---
 I have played since Beta. I have gotten well over my $60 out of this game. I have also gotten well over the 30 bucks I've spent on fall out 1st. 
---
 It may be missing stuff and have bugs but I don't focus on that. I focus on what there is to do and the fun I have doing it.
---
They definitely all stack.  I have the full uny/sneak suit and a Fixer.
---
Some enemies are more aware than others, and the burrowing mechanic of mole rats and radscorpions seems to make them omniscient.  You can have agility close to 40, all the sneak perks and effects, and you still go into danger immediately.
---
It's not hard to participate in, say, SBQ with said suit and never exit caution.  A lot of times when I'm hunting legendaries I just sneak by any enemy without a star.  You can walk right in front of a lvl 68 super mutant and your hidden bar might shrink a tiny bit, but for the most part you're not even there until you start shooting.
---
It's the bulletin board with the red string on it.  To the right, I think.
---
Great stuff, thanks for this.
---
It's next to your name above your comment
---
Lots of people sell trash legendaries just so others can get scrip. Once I'm capped out for the day I sell anything else I find for 15-20 caps per scrip, and it flies out of the machines faster than I can stock it.
---
All armor mods have less than 1% chance to learn which kinda sucks
---
I can do 11/14 Mods, of which Beam Focuser I believe is one of them.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
It's not ideal, but the petrified scorch people are good for this. You obviously only get one shot at each, but they have zero DR so you can see exactly what the full damage is.
---
AWESOME!!!!!!
---
I dont think committing fraud to trick robots was their intention.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. However, the USA of the Fallout timeline seems extremely nationalistic to me. I‚Äôd imagine that the government (and therefor Vault-Tec) would probably pass over a candidate who seems to feel the need to fly any flag other than that of the US.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs an RPG, but not everything is variable. Your character wasn‚Äôt a complete ignoramus, for instance, nor were they an average nobody, nor a cripple. The Residents were among the best and brightest‚Äîin the eyes of Vault-Tec‚Äîthat could be found.
---
Beat me to it.
---
No problem, good luck figuring out what it was üëç
---
But how do I make sure what order to do it In because I have 3 characters the bloddy I tried to do before I did not have enough points for all the perks that's why I have this level 5
---
We got the frame from the weekly challenge!  That was the latest grind.
---
Yes! I had all of that, but bolstering armour, and i would almost never die, apart from Radiation damage, and maintaining the health below 20% was quite difficult, because you would go too low, then take RadAway, which would make it go to high...It was frustrating to be honest, so i gave up haha :)
---
does harder
---
Yep. Go ahead. I can send you a uncompressed PNG as well if you would like.
---
 &gt;Is loot in unlimited stash still disappearing? 
---
No. 
---
 &gt;Are NPCs still spawning dead?  
---
Sometimes, but you can log out to the main menu and reload into the world to force a respawn. This means you can drop a nuke, kill the ghouls, and repeatedly relog to force them all to respawn.
---
No I mean the effects on the armor
---
Love it! Second best band of all time. ;)
---
Eh,  I could take it or leave it.   It will be interesting to see how they employ the new features,  hopefully don't break the game.
---
Dude is wrong, it's longer than 5 minutes, but shorter then 20, so 15 is the most likely timer.
---
By a longshot.
---
You have to put the Special points in first for a lot of these perks. Just make sure to have the special ready, the perks can all be chosen later on.
---
Haha, some of the comments here are cringe! It's a Led Zeppelin tune!
---
I'm sure they've been through some Good Times, Bad Times!
---
I roam the wasteland with my wife and occasionally my son. This game is SO good with common interests and teamwork. I'm a 100% disabled combat vet and this is what I do now lol. Everyday since open beta day 1.
---
I am lucky, tuesdays are my work from home days so get to downkoad beore I log off for the night. üëçüòÅ
---
Here's the song live - https://youtu.be/rAT36J9Htd8
---
I know the chance is very slim, but I would love to see Abigayle Singh alive
---
Serums, 5.56, bulk metal ( and bulk cloth for some reason)  screws, plans and balistic fiber is what I sell out of on a consistant basis. Weapons don't sell unless it has an explosive attribute. Armor sets sell like, unyielding and vanguard. I hold on to the pieces untill I have a set.
---
What are the special levels I need to have enough for the perks
---
I just hope that the NPCs will be all over the map, not just in certain areas and/or on a instanced basis.  That would be EXTREMELY disappointing.
---
Knowing that it's Bethesda's F team developing 76, I would set my expectations low, then set them all the way down to the bottom.
---
I wonder if we'll get any BoS or Responders that fled and are now coming back?
---
Another aspect that gets overlooked is that when we get new content, it's often has a quasi-Atomic Shop lock.  You can't sell Vault 94 Steel.  You can't sell Solar or Thorn Armor.  You can't sell Backpacks or Cameras.  There are too many arbitrary restrictions like that.
---
Lol true. Emotions before consideration was my first thought. If it is a Led Zeppelin quote, that's much less cringe to me.
---
Yo I was at this camp a few days ago, having read the LZ lyrics then saw the gt was widow something something, kinda hits ya. My deepest condolences fellow wastelander
---
Right.  The same is true if you have a shop that you want to aim at newcomers.  There's no way to stop a high-level from just buying up everything, and that kind of sucks because it's not intended for them.
---
If you want to do the build i mentioned, u need:
---
Strenght: 2
---
Perception: 15
---
Endurance: 3
---
Charisma: 2
---
Intelligence: 13
---
Agility: 15 
---
Luck: 8
---
Well most of them, the game is set 25 years after the great war, so there could be npcs in their early 20's born shortly after the war ( either inside or outside vaults), but it also would be interesting to meet the first generation of post war wastelanders
---
I love that attachment but recently realized commando perks don‚Äôt affect it. Surprisingly it is considered a rifleman gun (single shot rifle)
---
He wasnt an enemy! Idk what reality is anymore
---
I wont!
---
That's not 100% accurate. Stealth does exist in NW, but most people misunderstand the Fallout 76 Stealth mechanic in general. I use my understanding of the Stealth mechanic to manipulate the Scorchbeast to reveal enemies and ignore me. I recorded an interesting video in NW of the Scorchbeast seeing me running around with my Pip-Boy on, landing to attack me, then completely losing track of me because of a couple of Stealth tricks. Because the other 2 players in the server were also perfectly stealthed, neither the Scorchbeast nor the Radscorpion a few feet away from all of us could see us.
---
Ah, that's a detail i had forgot about! I took this maybe 2 months ago, forgot to post it. It really does hit you, she took a decent amount of time for that. She also had good vending prices, least back then
---
NEato FeetO, cool stuff!
---
I mean...it looks viable. 
---
A few personal preferences...ya know if it was me blah blah...I would ditch 3 points out of charisma.  Take hard bargain out and swap it in when you're selling then take it back out. Put them in luck for Class Freak. I'd also ditch Photosynthetic and get Healing factor. Yes I know, chem reduction...but class freak will minimize the negative.  And then you can move that point from endurance and give you another point in Demolition expert to get more damage from that explosive weapon.
---
The saddest thing I WILL experience in the game is waiting 7-8 months for Wastelanders only for it to be a huge letdown.
---
+karma haha the flatwoods monster invaded my camp, stole my cow, turned my own turrets against me, and attacked me with the local super mutants and snallygasters... it only happened once... but it was hell.
---
Have they said anything new about when Wastelanders will release? I know they said early 2020, but are we talking February, March?
---
Somebody needs a nap.
---
 Actually its Pistol Perks for mine as I have that grip. I took em' out and put em' back, to make sure. You put a rifle stock on it, and its a rifle. ;)
---
Lol sounds like an ass hole!
---
It could end in Thunder Mountain lake?
---
Yeah I hadn‚Äôt thought about that since I keep mine in rifle form... I‚Äôm curious does it count as a gunslinger or guerilla gun (single shot or auto) -which perks affect it?
---
Ive never spent a dime of real money in the atom shop. The game gives me everything i need to play it. The free stuff i snag up, i mean its free. If people stop buying stuff at full price, the price drops. Do that enough times and the price becomes standard. 
---
Stuff costs that much because people keep paying for it. Point blank.
---
Indeed.
---
Not the walls in my house.
---
I remember him sicking molerats in me now. I shoulda looked for him!
---
Nah, they all get invisisbility, plus that
---
They are amazing. I have a furious faster fire rate that I primed and it just chews through everything.
---
 Gunslinger is what works on it. Its not an automatic I guess.
---
I hav herd mentality mutation so Inalways need to be teamed up : add me as a friend, join my server and feel free to inv me every time u see me online... if you cant invite me because I‚Äôm already in a team message me and I ll invite u instead. 
---
My GT is R6 N0AH ( second letter is zero, not O )
---
Seems like good ol' Betsy got a psycho addiction
---
I run Vanguard as well; one piece has poison resistance, two have radiation. Add in photosynthetic and sunkissed, along with a Vampire gatling laser, and you won't need much healing items or radaway.  :)
---
And Kleenex was invented to remove makeup, not for blowing your nose...and of course you ALWAYS use something according to how the patent says it's to be used, right?
---
&gt;Crouch in a good bush, watch some TV, and wait until you get murdered
---
Sounds like real life üëÄ
---
lol :)
---
Thanks! I‚Äôll ask you though what I asked another responder: isn‚Äôt it enough to have the healing factor mutation so you can keep those perk card spaces free?
---
If u got the PTO use it.  U don‚Äôt need an excuse to enjoy life.
---
&gt;Stealth mechanic
---
but not stealth perk card or armor mods? wondering what you mean, love to go look at your video
---
Did he make that using build mods or did he actually go into the Creation Kit?
---
Live free, die free
---
I‚Äôve had no luck getting it to apply the update.  Download sure, so I‚Äôll start up at lunch so it should be applied by the time I get home (took a fair amount of time last few updates)
---
The Plasma Flamer was the single best pistol in FO4. If you can feed it in 76 it is the same case. In te case of FO4 it actually could have more range than the normal flamer.
---
There should definitely be some sort of arena area where the PVPers can trash each other while we munch irradiated popcorn in the stands.
---
I've put down that poor soul many times, knowing that if I didn't, something much worse would happen to him/her.
---
I run a vamp gat laser for fast hits if I'm on ground, and a vamp explosive flechette harpoon against mobs or up on a roof, etc.  The harpoon is great for healing in big chunks.
---
41 here I love it. A game my sons and I play together, (at least 1 yay!) I pay for fallout 1st. So I spend my time collecting junk and making ammo for my kids.  People forget the story and wonderful things that are hidden everywhere. I've taken so many pictures of funny things I find.
---
I wish I could keep it and raise it to be this games dog meat
---
Xmas should be miserable lol?
---
Do we have like a release date?
---
Ever upwards
---
It‚Äôs random when you create it. Mine is pretty good overall; 10% if mutated on a few, junk weighs less, etc. One piece sucks and I‚Äôve been rerolling but I keep getting less falling damage with two other crap attributes!  My set is Thorn btw, I think Solar is better.
---
It is that. ;) https://youtu.be/rAT36J9Htd8
---
I love that area!
---
just make a 2nd character for the rifles
---
I totally agree.
---
Whats that? Or should i find out myself?
---
Shotgun is now melee (range) but needs shells.  It's just terrible.
---
Yeah last night I was cruising through the airport and the workshop was claimed. I killed a few super mutants and was on my way out. I noticed 3 players and a contested bar going up? I just stood there and the 3 infant neck beards roasted me with pacifist on? I was just walking through but I guess when I'm in the boundary of a contested workshop it doesn't matter?
---
I wish Survival was back so the workshops would be more chill lol.. I was thinking about going all rage on them with ebay armor, stealthboys and jumping skills but I turned it off and watched football :)
---
Diluted radaway is the way to go, and plus you don't always need to be below 20%. You can stay ;between 20-30 and do well, and live longer. I save sube 20% for when I'm sneaking through somewhere or doing an event with others where I can avoid most of the damage. It takes a little practice, but once you get it, nothing compares to bloody. I hit for like 500-600 a shot in VATS, with me B2525 handmade.
---
Go to any train station a read the boy scout poster. Then you are ready to go
---
Since you have to be out of combat for HF to kick in, I took it off. I kept being randomly put into danger at odd times and it would stop any heals. (Then a week would go by with no problems).  HF was def useful (and fast), but I don't mind the extra points in END. The radiation heal is the biggest bonus, I think, over HF.
---
Or the Board Members
---
My camp is built into the monorail pylon west of the Monorail Elevator - I adore everything about it except the constant swarm of Super Mutants and Deathclaws that my turrets can't kill fast enough.
---
added it as is :) the compressed version works fine as I would likely compress it anyway.
---
Games been acting up for me too but the big update is tomorrow so yay.
---
Doing mobs in PA is easier ( I believe ) cause you are not being stunned as you would in body armor which delays the number of hits ( swings ) you can get in. Talking about close up melee combat.
---
OP needs armor before he gets there! Crafting armor earlier on is much better to do before L50. Why would you even craft your own gear at L50 when there's Legandaries? Is the label on your jumper at the front? ;)
---
-
---
Crafting and scrapping armor also unlocks mods, it's a must!! Xx
---
Your opinion stopped being an opinion when it devolved into shit talking.
---
Ah! I see. Sun-kissed removes rads?
---
Collect all the magazines.  I have had fun finding spawn locations.
---
The thing is, I don't think the government, and VT, were the big dumb jingos they seem to be. I think they just used it as a method to gain power, and they were extremely intelligent. VT would know that to fulfil their mission of securing nuclear sites, they'd need the best, which would include anyone, be they American or Chinese. I think it's viable to make your character ethnic/foreign. VT's best scientist was German. As long as it helped the Enclave, and helped fulfil their vision, they used anybody.
---
I have this conversation with my students, who all think FO76 is still what it was a year ago.
---
Or a nice topiary from the atom shop.
---
I've just started using a bloodied faster fire plasma flamer. I should really mod it to automatic but it's too fun. burns through ammo though
---
54, my wife is 55, we have over 700 hours total in this game, not to mention FO4.
---
We love it.
---
Well, that blows. I'll be at this for a while then i guess. Haha
---
Nvm. Got it literally the next piece i scrapped. :)
---
Id be down
---
I think of them like radiant quests but they‚Äôre not that great. Still, there are more than a few traditional side quests and at least one faction that‚Äôs optional.
---
Thanks and yes I agree every game has its good and bad. I‚Äôve been keeping to the overseers quest so far and down a few things on my own. But I like this game a lot and truly the outrage is just outrage for the sake of it. At the end of the day,  onones forcing anyone to play anything they don‚Äôt like. I like F76 and will play it.
---
Gt is capricious boi
---
Yep-- I think its 6am to 6 PM? So, during the day my health bar just fills right back up. Try this: equip sun and photo, and stand in a stream for a moment, then climb out and watch full health come back. It's been a while since I experimented but i think the regen time was pretty close to HF.
---
Pretty much. It‚Äôs just like how you prove to MODUS you can join its little enclave. Results are a great membership fee.
---
I was under the impression it was the best and brightest America had to offer. I may be wrong. 
---
And i would imagine that its multiple languages because there are multiple languages spoken in America. And we also know that a lot of our best and brightest in America ARE from other countries and speak different languages. 
---
I really see this like someone getting upset they cant put a murica flag on 117 in Halo CE.
---
üëçüòÄ
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hear what they have to say.
---
Yes, I have changed mine twice and back again.
---
While i see the validity in your argument i still disagree. We simply draw different lines in the sand.
---
 As for the whole not enough content to fix bugs argument its just flawed at the base. There should be almost no bugs from a title this high status at this point. They had more than enough time to fix the game. At this point its become insulting. There is no justification for bugs over content because there shouldnt be these bugs anymore. Yes they need to be fixed, but that doesnt validate a delay in content. In fact the opposite.
---
You're very welcome. I just wanted to make sure you would get loot from the 3\* as well! Just happy to help out! Fallout 76'ers gotta stick together :D
---
Yeah I always have a bloodied one in my hotbar. They are amazing weapons
---
Mostly the whole thing.  All those people who were earnest and trying to make it, and as we know, none of them did.
---
Plasma Flamer is the only way I use 'em! Absolutely great weapons! Add a Forceful Stock and they will break waaaay slower.
---
Try and find yourself a Vampire Plasma, with the Flamer mod it's great for whenever you get overwhelmed. Melt them before they can melt you! Also works with Anti-Armor perks so get Tank Killer slapped on your cards. You will fear Cave Crickets, Mirelurk Kings, Sgt Gutsy's no more!!
---
Comment @ 0 I'd imagine it's a downvote bot, but depends how many upvotes have been negated, Reddit is funny sometimes.
---
&gt;some of us are disappointed with how fallout‚Äôs been lately,
---
Lately.
---
Lol I was being facetious.
---
I agree it's a horrible grind if you don't like NW or pvp in this game.  Shouldn't be forced to do something you hate for a Christmas reward.  Dont get me wrong though, same thing though for the pvp guys, its lame making them grind pve events for rewards when they obviously would rather be pvping.
---
 Its like that. The Barrel is what makes em' auto or not with Energy Weapons and that Barrel is non auto. Just pukes green flame all over stuff, and it catches fire and dies. ;)
---
 Actually the Ammo is good as you don't need Gunpowder. My Heavy Guns just chew that up, Acid anyone? ;)
---
What perks do I get before those main perks and how do I get all the specials I'm level 7 now I have perception 4 str 2 and charisma 2 intglience 1 luck 2 agility 1 endurance 1
---
I didn't say you had to adhere to the patent, I was merely stating a fact.
---
I created a new character and slow playing it. I don‚Äôt remember a lot of what I did with my main character so it‚Äôs like playing the game from launch without all the bugs.
---
Tthe upgrade plans im guessing you mean. Yeah they are awesome. But the rest is very meh
---
My wife and I would hunt players for an hour in that mode. I miss it as well bethesda, please bring this back.
---
Try the NukaCola armour quest without using google.
---
Or the NukaCola locked locker quest without googling for help
---
Yeah the rest are, but the Backpack Plans themselves would keep you busy!
---
This isn't a bug at all. There are 2 versions of Royal Jelly. One is junk, the other is Aid.
---
There are 2 kinds of royal jelly if I remember correctly. One is a food item, one is a junk item. This one I have held off because of it.
---
This is a myth, scorchbeasts are not attracted to explosive bait. It only affects creatures on this list: https://imgur.com/gallery/DMc6AkY
---
Plasma Flamer is fantastic, especially as a "I f@#$ed up!" backup weapon for a sniper build. The only drawback is that it chews through ammo as fast as it chews through enemies.
---
I just had five wanks, then blinked. Tears all round. Great job! Great picture too!!

Because it‚Äôs a waste of time farming all the mats since you have no perks that reduce crafting costs, and you‚Äôll find everything you need from looting. 0-50 you should focus on leveling up, not gearing up. Once you have perks to reduce crafting costs, then you can spam craft to scrap for unlocks. You‚Äôre playing the game in reverse. Once you get a few more levels that armor will be worthless.

I already have the nukacola paint for the t51. Is the quantum for the X01 in the game?
---
It just works.  Try it.
---
You have to start it off right from the fusion generator to a big switched power pylon and then run your wires from what I have had to do via trial and error it never worked trying to do it after the fact but that‚Äôs just my experience.
---
Well I found some of the scorched corps (I found a cap on one of them) and stood there until I stopped getting rads then I ate some uncooked food to get my health low enough.   After the berry mentats my int was at 32.  I tried repairing one leg and it went back to its original durability.  So I though I would craft a new leg.  I was happy with the new durability but then I went to add calibrated shocks back on and it went back down to the same level as the ones I originally crafted with probably 10 int at the time.
---
to do such a thing ALL powered items must feed through the switch, example.
---
Generator -&gt; Switch -&gt; Everything else
---
Good point.
---
I created a new character and I'm actually reading all the terminals and picking all locks. Walked around Watoga and spends 2.5 hrs just exploring all the buildings.  I actually had a blast doing it. Better then the normal lvl grinding.
---
Fusion generator to switch to power connectors. Should work. But if power connectors are too close it‚Äôs been buggy for me sometimes.
---
If you want something cools yet difficult to collect, there's always those little robot models. I saw a CAMP the other day with all of them in a display, and it looked great.
---
The thing that's hit me the hardest so far in the game was a note I found at South Mountain Lookout. A guy left it before going out to get his dog, Rufus, who had been stolen by Raiders. As a man who has invested what might well be an unhealthy amount of emotion into my own dog, that really hit home. 
---
I'm told you can find the two of them, but I haven't tried yet. I can live with the fact that they'll both be dead, but not being able to kill the bastards who stole the dog just doesn't work for me.
---
Yes.
---
) very hard to figure out without googling 
---
Personally, I have no idea how they pieced it together
---
Yea well the unlocks and rewards are free and we can only make so many few atoms daily.  So if I can get it for free I will.  Itd be less miserable if you gained more xp and level up faster in nw.  I get cranky and salty playing it for too long.  No good team to play with and other players seem so damn selfish.  I try to help out they dont return the favor.  They have a mic but just breathe in then bitch at you for not doing something, etc.
---
I finally had a nuke drop on the server I was on so I rushed over to the fight.  I took my furious mini gun with 4k worth of ammo and let her have it.   It didn't seem to do anything in the way of damage and we actually failed the event.  I didn't have my furious plasma cannon on me but I will be giving that a try next.  I have the ultracite receiver on that one so that should help as well.
---
No issues at all. The tent camp is sometimes hard to place but that's no different than any regular camp. Scrap Box is essential and FO NV was my favorite game so it's cool to rock the ranger gear. üëçüèª a couple different ranger armor skins released since day 1 but that's about it for new content

Here's the video. Some context: only 3 people in the server were left. After I crouch down by the house, one person is crouched on top of the roof to my left. The other person is crouched behind the house to my right. The video starts off with me standing up with my Pip-Boy light active, making me incredibly visible to the SB. Once the SB spawned, it saw me. It could not see the other 2 players, because they had been perfectly stealthed from the start. In order to become equally invisible, I had to both crouch in the proper location and boost my Stealth by using the Stealth Boy (little known fact, this increases your Agility/Stealth temporarily in addition to applying the Chameleon effect). Since the Scorchbeasts I'm NW have nerfed stats (meaning lower Perception than their Adventure counterparts), a small amount of Stealth is enough to trick them. And, as you can see in the video, the Scorchbeast lost track of me, despite staring right at me. Neither it nor the Radscorpion could see the 3 players, despite all of us being extremely close. After the SB flew away, I planted a machine gun Turret to my right, which scared the guy by the house. He got up to run away, alerting bith the Turret and the SB. The girl on the roof got up to try to kill the guy running from the Turret. The SB saw both of them and the Turret and attacked. I looped around the house, killed both of the other players, and won the match with 14 kills :)

I should've specified, I did check before buying them that they were listed under the aid category in the vendor and the ones I had previously been unable to find were looted from honey beasts, which I had previously heard were of the aid variety. 
---
Is this bad information? I thought the ones that spawned in the random locations were junk and the ones coming from the honey beasts were aid?
---
I'm Playing sword and Shield Right now i'll come back when there's nothing left to do in that game hahaha
---
Missing your chance at a legendary doesn't excuse the last two sentences of your title. Keep your ableist rhetoric to yourself
---
Bob would be barely a sprout if we encountered them in 76!
---
People have no respect for other players
---
Remember, it's not just the player's fault here. Bethesda was releasing two updates to address events, and we only received one so far. The first slowed events down, the second adds participation rewards depending how you help out. Legendary enemies were lootable for all players at the event.
---
No, the game data doesn't lie. You're experiencing a placebo effect. Scorchbeasts will land with the same frequency whether you use it or not. 
---
Standing in an open area and taking a few shots does work. Try it.
---
If by "arena" you mean "selected areas of the regular map" and by "stands" you mean "hiding in a bush", then I have great news for you...
---
Once all of the dupers left the game or got banned, inventory dried out quickly. Demand for the now-finite number of duped God legendaries skyrocketed to absurd levels, and now many players are left to rely on legitimate drops or Purveyor finds, which are pretty crappy.
---
Well, damn...
---
Some alien lifeforms other than flat woods monster. Maybe an npc who can explain the cthulu tentacles in lucky hole mine and the metal faces.
---
You would need to run a wire to the switch from the generator  and then wire everything else out of the switch.
---
Middle Mountain Cabins East of Whitespring Station. Behind one of the cabins there is a picnic basket with a aid royal jelly inside.
---
Why in the hell this post is being downvoted to oblivion? Reddit is a funny place...
---
I feel this too, not too long ago I used to sell mid-level gear quite easily, but lately I just scrip whatever lvl5 to 45 stuff as soon as I get them because unless I price them for 8c per scrip, it will sit forever on my vendor and the stash space is gold...
---
It's shooting my cow in my case, but yeah. It's a bug introduced in the last update, and with any luck will be fixed tomorrow.
---
Well, you really only need to have enough Agility or Sneak to overpower the Perception of an enemy NPC... Deathclaws have a Perception of 10. I don't think anyone has data mined all of the creatures though.
---
I need a new place to build too. I have 3 characters with stores..
---
I have a bloodied ffr one. I love it
---
You risk nothing. Only thing that carries over is your perk points (NOT CARDS) and atom store cosmetics - which you open the store once in the lobby and click on which outfit you'd like to wear (applies on your next around)
---
You load in with a V76 jumpsuit and thats it. Have to find your weapons/armor/chems in the world.
---
Agreed, don't be nasty to other people you don't know.
