I use the oil lamps on my Vendor deck.
---

---
If stuck for options run to Whitesprings and have a rummage through the plans held by the various bot vendors in the basement.
---
---
---
that being said. There is a share card for everyone. This was a discussion on "best", scrapper, is not on that list, imho (I actually shake my head when I see it).  just sayin
---
I don't know what to make of this. Isn't just free stuff good whether it's useful now or later? 
---
It's free
---
Hello there fellow heavy guns user I use the exact same gun you have :)
---
Happened to me. I opened 4 during double xp weekend and 3 others were opened by others. At this point I’m not even surprised at how incompetent Bethesda is
---
Lmao peak overreaction
---
Have-it-all attitude?
---
You meaning wanting a game that:
---
• is fun
---
• performs well
---
• has a modern pc-friendly ui?
---
Yes please, gimme gimme gimme.
---
Gauss Pistols have a silencer, such a pity the weapon itself is rather mediocre.
---
Shut up. If it’s not fun go play sone other game. The world is louder with them. Lousy like your attitude.
---
good one point wonders are utility perks like Green Thumb, Travel Agent, Scrapper or Scrounger 
---
to a lesser degree also Strange in Numbers, Radicool or Escape Artist, but often people already have the perks on their character that are benefical for their builds
---
never share Sun Kissed, Rad Sponge or Gun Fu as it is very likely that you will get kicked out of the public team if you share them
---
I don't understand that. It's a game. Being a dick gains nothing permanent.
---
it's also still wanting me to discovery the cranberry bog. funny cause i live there and have since December lol.
---
The ship moves one space a day so it’s a countdown to the end of the season
---
I see caps as useless. No matter how valuable or rare something might be, I sell it for 1c. Hopefully it encourages others to do the same
---
High capacity is crap, you try to enjoy it because you grinded for it so hard lol. Less resistance? No thanks
---
I would love to see a stream of you guys doing this great work. I think it would be pretty cool, or is it a case of "you should never meet your heroes"?
---
When you got disconnected in a team, the workshop used to be deeded to another team mate, now it just gets set as unowned...
---
It was always clear from the start that the legendary Run was replacing the previous daily rewards so after the legendary Run is completed there is nothing. If there were other rewards then it'd be the same as the old system which Bethesda changed from so no it'll never happen and I'm sorry but I'm confused why people are shocked by it. Unhappy with it I understand but you've gotten all the rewards from legendary Run which means there's no more till the next one. Bethesda won't be giving anything on top because it'd just nullify their changes or the legendary Run in general
---
Good to know. I thought that might be the case. So it is always the point you should be at. Nice.  
---
When I passed him, I was hoping something cool would happen. Same when going over the black hole. ah well
---
IRL socialism doesn't work, but when ammo is not hard to find, and can be manufactured pretty easily, I don't see why someone else can't just give you ammo
---
3 wendigos in trees in NE mire
---
This happened to me last week. It spun me the fuck out. I kept spinning around all paranoid.
---
You can fast travel across the whole map for less than 20c. Getting to the mire at level 1-4 isn't hard, surviving is. They stop at your place, then travel back to the forest
---
Huh. Didn't notice any budget increase, but lately I've been leaving some wiggle room anyhow. Thanks for the heads up.
---
This has been a common request since just a few months after release. Why the dev team hews and haws about what can be done in the game, idk. For all the hullabaloo about creating raid bosses, why more uncommon bosses that are upscales or retextures of normal creatures aren't present is a mystery. 
---
A boss encounter doesn't have to be a big creature with a bunch of spawns. It could be a literal army of raiders (or, controversially, settlers) descending on a location. It could be a rescue mission versus cultists who've got their hands on an artillery unit and send out waves. It could be settlers from DC who turned into centaurs en route who finally slither their way into Harper's Ferry. IDK i'm just some guy.
---
I think Fallout 76 would benefit more from Bethesda more frequently changing the world. It seems like that's happening w/ Wendigo Colossus and upcoming Brotherhood of Steel quests, but even smaller scale would feel more real. maybe every update, there are a few more people at Foundation, a few more built up structures. A few less raiders but more hardware and fortifications. Things like that to transform Appalachia from its release, semi-pristine/post-Responders look to the (even more) shattered, depleted ruins more reflected in the games 200+years after the great war, and build bosses out of that kind of world building.
---
[deleted]
---
I advocate destroying the in-game economy. Everyone should sell everything for 1c. Including that weapon you want.
---
Can I get a warm cake instead ?
---
lol IRL socialism doesn't work, in a game with limitless resources, I don't see why it can't
---
I'm all for bending the rules of physics to make a more exciting game, but changing the colour of a laser is essentially impossible. They are by nature emitting a fixed frequency energy wave.
---
I get that, but for people who don’t want to go around searching and just get the challenges done, they can go there and get it all at once.
---
And after they nerf it to no longer drop as a legendary!
---
Is it higher level pieces that scrap into mods as well? I've noticed I never get anything from 1-5 but from 10 and up I get armor and especially weapon mods more often.
---
I think that's just mean. Everything should be 1c. Profiteers aren't nice.
---
im not sure of the lore implications but wasn’t the 1911 in fo nv?
---
That's awesome to hear mate :)
---
And a silencer for the Gatling Gun. OMG that makes such a thudding sound as it fires they could use the noise alone as a weapon.
---
ok, hoard them all for myself and only 4 at a time. got cha
---
I wish they'd just help out us players who's dailies keep getting auto completed... But no they just refuse to do anything to help!
---
I am having the same issue as the OP with atoms being reverted without me spending them. Can I also DM you my information to see if it can be resolved?
---
Me and my two siblings run this event every time we can. We can complete it with just the two of us. Me and my sister collect 50 ore each and my brother uses his gauss Gatling and keeps the scavengers alive. The trick is to wait until you have all the ore before putting it in so no larger enemies spawn. I’m still trying for the hazmat suit and rad barrel though
---
Or my absolute favorite: getting blasted by obvious af automatic laser fire from an enemy and looting a combat shotgun from the corpse.
---
The service entrance in at the white springs usually has 2 or 3. There can be 1 among the rabbits on the hill and 2 on the small lawn going towards the train station.
---
You my b2525 10mm auto pistol for this
---
Tbh i am not that in to PvP.
---
I get more pleasure out of helping people enjoy the game.
---
I am the same in real life big bloke,with a soft Heart.
---
I just find it hard to walk away when a player is needlessly giving me shit.
---
Have never,ever intentionally killed another player that didn't ask for it.
---
Nothing better when there is a dozen gamers doing a Queen having fun,giving Stimpacks to the other fallen players.
---
No
---
To me it really dont matter much, but i think utility cards are the best to share. Like scrapper, travel agent etc since i never have them equipped and instead use The cards i need myself. Only thing i really care about is to not have someone in my team that is sharing rad spounge
---
Yep "!.45 auto pistol" and  Light in the shining darkness was the unique version
---
Does chemist work on ore ? Been to lazy to test
---
spawn in at whitespring bunker and instead of going inside just head up the hill on the left side and there should be critters there. If there's no squirrels you can servr hop and keep doing it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also spawning in at charleston station can trigger a critter or two in the field. Same deal. Server hop.
---
Re-download the game. Worked for me multiple times.
---
Can confirm.
---
great idea, but disagree on Strange In Numbers + Birdbones.  Just about every mutant (most players 50+, has Birdbones. I'm not sure what issue you are referring to, i've never experienced anything but bliss using this combo.
---
I know I can do the mods, just don't know about the legs
---
Got all the BoS paintjobs too
---
I keep finding a lot of pillows lay around. Maybe fashion a poor man's silencer?
---
It made more sense when the purveyor was nearby.  I'm between the maw and treetop village.  And, a MLQ spawns at the bottom of my camp.  Ft to either location, is, rough.
---
It costs me 30-ish caps to travel to Tyler County Fairgrounds.  And caps are precious to lowbies.  
---
But, I get your point.
---
This... then just get to that spot at world-hop.
---
The hang time is wild.
---
Out of curiosity why is Gun Fu a bad choice?
---
Should just always remember your bio shit after the first time. The first part is only like 1/6 of the whole silo. Let us skip shit if we want
---
Sweet that looks wicked
---
it's AWESOME :) especially for someone like me with the SS jetpack and an AP build :)
---
it pains me to play an alt that I have not mutated yet.
---
UPDATE #1: I have recorded a clip of the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_BMSd-IG58 As you can see I have the flight recorder which was needed to continue the quest , but this NPC is stuck and not responding.
---
UPDATE: #2 None of the community solutions have worked so I have resorted to Bethesda Support. Wish me luck, I will post their response.if I get one :(
---
I think most plans that are not dropped by workshops can be found in whitesprings. But hoppning between player vendors with 100+ plans are probably a cheaper option IF you join Peoples public teams
---
OK, I'll let you know when I get the legs. Just let me know what matierls you need
---
weeklies won't work with double score, it specifically says dailies.
---
He’s a purely benign and absolutely perfectly running AI and none of you need to be wary of us in the slightest. Carry on, as you were.
---
Saw this post earlier today and built it as soon as I logged onto the game this afternoon!  Love it!
---
Wait, what? You mean like the *incredible* speed in which they nerfed TS/E? Legacy explosive energy weapons? The current "Fuck this critter specifically" shotgun VATS trick? The %25 Fire Rate Minigun trick that lets people blow through the queen so fast nobody else gets loot? You mean *that* fast? 
---
You must be playing a different version of the game than I am, because I don't think "fast" describes anything they do with this game, for good or for ill. They don't even stop blatant dupe glitches and exploits "fast".
---
They won't since you get the board game at max rank
---
It’s almost like they’re encouraging you not to play until Thursday
---
crops at camps worked.. i looted all this guys crops and got it.
---
Its usually because of over maximum weight (without any additional weight perks)
---
Worse so if you die very quickly after going into an area.
---
Joining a new team and fast travelling to the team leader will work, or else where you can.
---
If I wasn’t banned, I’d happily arm and armor you for PvP, just so you can kick some ass when a low level needs help, just like I did pre ban. Problem is, I took my help a little too far and gave a B2525 Fixer, explosive laser rifle (one of BE, JE or VE), a set of ass/sent combat armor and an E GP (AAE25, BE+P, FE90, EE250, JE, or VE+A) to everyone I came across who didn’t have anything worth keeping. About half the people I helped didn’t even have a full set of legendary armor, or were using legendary weapons that were total bullshit like a 1* Nocturnal pipe rifle, or a 1* Mutant lever action rifle.
---
I don’t think that matters, it’s just a poster
---
Atomssssss
---
2-5 per daily
---
5-10 per weekly
---
Boom, they’d have Wayyyyyyyyyyy more players
---
I've muted those folks most of the time, if I'm not in the mood to hear them at least. Every now and then, I'll plug my mic in and try to talk to them if they seem interesting, but more often that it's someone with an open mic who's eating chips or breathing hard for some reason.
---
I'd appreciate the addition of a Remington breach loader.
---
I have my Camp by the saw mill near Vault 76. Everytime i log in one of these spawn:
---
-Squirrel
---
-Radstag
---
-Frog
---
-Radchicken
---
-Opossum
---
I'm yet to see anyone share rad sponge in a public team. I find most don't share any cards at all but I'm thinking with all these posts it's going to cause more people to start using it because they can see the reactions and grief
---
You aren’t screwed out of anything... it’s double dailies... dailies
---
This is a great idea!
---
I like Blocker.  Extra survivability is always good.
---
Then use perks that stop you from triggering traps?
---
Who cares, make your own team or join a new one
---
correct. like vending not allowing skins. Displays are non-skinned only.
---
How do you craft while using power armor?
---
For making pieces? Yes
---
Yes to more Halloween decor! 
---
10/31 twenty-four seven!
---
Try telling that to everyone that complained about the free poster that was in the atom shop that could be got ingame
---
No because it’s only double dailies which reset every day
---
I always thought the "Fixer" was a random drop for completing Encrypted.
---
Embarrassed to say this.
---
I have not yet complete Encrypted in 370 Levels
---
Have completed every other event,including enough Nukes to amass 300+ Improved Repair Kits. but not that one.
---
Shame.........shame.......shame......shame........
---
Scraping armor and weapons should only result in chipped paint.
---
Glad to see other people creating themed CAMPs as well. Mine is an smutty warehouse porn studio.
---
I like your enthusiasm.
---
Oh, wow - that build is my endgame goal!
---
Survival Expert?
---
How'd you get 300 levels in a day?
---
are you trying to buy godrolls?
---
This isn’t the same at all
---
This is a poster in real life
---
This happened to me last night, super annoying, I'm at level 40 and can barely do any damage to ghouls at radiation rumble &amp; there were only two others level 60 &amp; level 90 who only tapped the enemies if at all &amp; they both still died.
---
We failed the event because of those two.
---
Cool, thank you
---
I’ve been debating ditching Speed Demon for that perk. Tired of micromanaging hunger and thirst every 30 seconds
---
I share strange in numbers and my friend tends to alternate between butchers bounty or green thumb when we farming for resources but if not he'll just share anything because we both just want the benefit of strange in numbers
---
Not anymore.
---
You'll get a certain amount from playing and completing some of the world and character challenges, but these are one-time things.  You'll probably amass a few of them early on, but it becomes too impractical after that.  Ever since the start of the Legendary Run, there is no longer an easy, repeatable daily/weekly option that grants Atoms.
---
Reel it in, boiiii
---
Speed demon makes reloading faster though.
---
You will be surprised how vertical the game is. I find things all the time that normall's can't reach. They tuck things in out of the way spots.  plus, it saves SO much time, traversing up/down hills. Oh you need to throw Marsupial on top of that to get full effect :)  it's momentum based, and crazy how far I can fly at times.
---
Is it worth it though?
---
That’s my dilemma
---
Your Heart is in the right place. ; -)
---
Great username as well :-)
---
Should have said that sooner lol
---
1,650, in fact.
---
How they arrived at such an oddly specific number, I'll never know.
---
I've done that same thing by myself, keeping one scav alive until the end. It's hectic but a whole lot of fun.
---
*You’ve piqued my interest...*
---
Damn I didn’t even know that’s a thing, good to know.
---
Maybe as it seems to fuck up a bunch of other stuff
---
Honestly this is why I share team medic or field surgeon over my standard inspirational while playing Encryptid with my public teams so other pylon users can benefit.
---
You don’t. OP meant while *crafting* Power Armor, I believe.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, as soon as you said that, I was thinking, oh maybe I should specify
---
Even though the things strangers gift me (I'm level 40)
---
I'll probably never use, selling them for vendors caps is a MUST for me, because I'm so low level right now.
---
Thats just my 2cents about receiving un-needed gifts.
---
I was gifted last night a bunch of combat rifles, knives &amp; non legendary weapons that I just sold but was still grateful for.
---
PS4 players usually ask for more, pc prices are the cheapest between the three versions.
---
You actually sell jetpack plans? 🤣
---
There were several events I did with people who had no interest in collecting the ore, they were just there to shoot the ghouls and level up. You can do that alone and not have to worry about the ore, sure you fail the event, but it's a ton of resources and xp. It's hilarious at the end when you get the thumbs down 'event failed' screen, and everyone else is giving the thumbs up!
---
Does strange in numbers stack if more than 1 person shares it?
---
It would be nice if they just let us do the run multiple times.  Even if some of the squares are empty because you learned the plans already, you could still get scrip and lunch boxes.
---
I use the Guslinger Perks occasionally on my bloodied Gamma Gun to do insane damage.
---
Thanks to a tip from a player here on Reddit.
---
Has to be the most fun Weapon in game.
---
Nightmare looking for Ghouls blown in to Bushes or on to Roofs though.
---
But my fancy shotgun displays as it should
---
Imagine that, joining a server to which a nuke lands on your base like within 30 seconds to 1 minute later.
---
As long as it's a decent sized one made with an actual decent material I can see it selling well
---
Only on PC, because that has never needed an ingame dupe method, they just use a third party program.
---
As far as i know, AA works only on the ballistic effect.
---
So it has the same usefullnes as a ghoul slayers gamma gun
---
i've never seen a skinned gun on display.
---
It’s one of those perks that unless you are used to it it’s distracting.
---
Any bonus to INT or XP you can get, you should try to have on when doing anything that grants XP.  
---
I might not waste a cranberry relish on crafting some ammo or working at my camp, but I will stop to sleep at least (and gives me a chance for a real life bio break)
---
Cheers. At least I know. I really got to look at the news  / announcements more often
---
No sadly. But strange in numbers does do everything from increasing herbivore/carnivore benefits, marsupial jump height and carry weight, scaly skin damage resist etc so it'd be way to OP if it stacked
---
No. None of the perks will stack effects. You only get the benefits from the highest ranked version available.
---
throw me a friend request and i'll add you next time i'm on :) PSN:  call_me_dill
---
I think they need to provide *something*.  It doesn't necessarily have to be Atoms, but something like Bullion, Scrip, or Caps would be nice.  It is weird to realize that the Daily/Weekly Challenges basically reward nothing once you complete the board.
---
But don't forget, Bethesda's objective is to get people to log in everyday.  They don't actually want to encourage people to finish the Legendary Run early.
---
This is the way to go. You are on the same path as me. I've been playing berserker all year (lv 200+) legitimately and I had a major break through last week. This should increase your dps 25-30%.
---
Follow these directions. 
---
-20 DR. Pick up medx and Psycho addiction, both lower your Dr by 10 each, so - 20 Dr.
---
+12 DR. Wear the full lv 1 leathers modded shadow, mod the chest standard with whatever secondary mod you like (I use asbestos for more ER).
---
+8 DR. Protective scout underarmor.
---
=0DR for max berserker damage.
---
If your DR is negative you will not get the berserker bonus, and you may need to modify your armor or underarmor. You can check what your current DR is by equipping ironclad 2 as this will cancel out your addiction.
---
Your DR should be 20 natural, with addictions your DR will be 0.
---
Ironclad 2 is not required for this build, but it will definitely help you diagnose your DR problem.
---
You can also use nerd rage 1 for a hefty low health bonus as well. Even though this perk gives 20DR, the damage gained with nerd and adrenal is far greater than the berserker initial damage drop.
---
To use a hazmat suit with this build you have to equip ironclad 2 keep max damage.
---
If using a hazmat at low health, drop the ironclad 2.
---
EDIT I forgot to mention that if you have even 1 DR your damage goes down 10%. Your goal is 0 DR full health and 20 DR low health with nerd 1. These are important facts to remember because if you lower your initial berserker damage, then your entire damage potential across the board goes down including nerd, adrenaline, gun fu, demo, and weapon specs. If you increase your initial base damage then every perk that compliments it and references it is also increased. This could be the key people have been missing for this build and I wanted to share my experience.
---
If you get second fixer or a decent combat rifle, you can use .38 rounds in it!
---
East of the Plastic Cat House Farm. 3 separate houses, take the middle one with the large decking, rug glitching is vital to building in it tho, I got fed up of the level 68 super mutants sniping my 10 missile turrets from the next house so moved, fusion generator in the living room on the rafters above looked dope tho, massive decking, hanging radstag.
---
Hmmm. Because the weapon damage calculator https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html adds the armor pen from both AA and stabilized. Though I don’t know if it’s counting the explosion radius or just hitting with the projectile. I think some said that explosive damage ignores some DR.
---
You didn't get the pat on the back.  Yeah, that is ego. 
---
I was level 20 before I understood emotes.  Thanks to a guide.   Controls are definitely not intuition.   Back then, if you gave me stuff, I wouldn't know what the hell to do. 
---
Offer stuff for cheap? Thank you truly.    But get that new players haven't played as long, have no idea on stuff,  and are barely walking out of the Vault at lower levels.
---
I was level 30 before Gamepass and traveled to help noobs.  Because it was fun.  That was my thank you.  Expecting returning FO fans or new guys to get Bethesda's weird shit, that's on you.
---
You must not have read the whole thing. I said multiple times we were grateful for anything given. This was meant to point out to those that want to really help that the cheesy easy to get stuff, is the stuff that you really need that early in.
---
You find a guy in the desert.
---
He is dehydrated.
---
You have a wad of cash on you and a bottle of warm water.
---
If you give him the wad of cash, he can get a hotel room and a 7 course meal when he gets back to civilization. IF he gets back to civilization.
---
If you give him the bottle of water, he will be helped immediately.
---
This was not meant to discourage people from giving whatever they want to new players. It was meant to point out that those who's goal is to make the EARLY game easier for other players (not because they have extra stuff that they don't want to go to waste), should give more basic stuff. 
---
When your level 150 with perk cards that help with radiation, thirst and hunger, it's easy to forget that at level 8, my biggest concern was that I'm hungry, but that food is going to irradiate the hell out of me.
---
If was to help those that are literally farming for stuff to help newbies farm the most helpful stuff they can.
---
I can't argue with anything you've just said.  My arguments are slightly self serving after the last few days.
---
The only time I've been booted was because I forgot I had Healing Hands equipped (which removes rads upon revival) and revived a bloodied player. Which, tbh, fair enough. That was a mistake on my part and it wasn't my intention to screw with them.
---
I can actually craft both legs
---
So cost per leg: aluminum x13, black titanium x8, oil x12, plastic x13, screw x13, silver x12, spring x13, and steel x22
---
Cost per calibrated shock: adhesive x17, aluminum x17, fiberglass x17, violet flux x5
---
Emergency protocol cost: adhesive x15, aluminum x15, circuitry x12, nuclear material x8, violet flux x4 
---
Paint per part: oil x1, plastic x2, steel x2
---
I share luck of draw (or whatever its called?) - the one where your weapon has a chance of fixing itself, I figured it was useful but harmless - please tell me there's not a broken guns build lol
---
Bethesda would give us this.. buuuuuuuut keep it 1 steel = 1 spring/screw so they can still force you to break your enter bar when you wanna make a useful amount haha.. damn you lead scrap!!!
---
No it’s on consoles as well.
---
Damn xboner
---
Fancy shotgun or revolver isn't a skin, they're unique weapons that spawn in the game like this and cannot be altered
---
AngryTurtle on YouTube covered some good spawns in his melee food build like a week or two ago.
---
Proof? As its more likely people still have stock from the previous dupe!
---
Yeah, as long as Bethesda doesn’t pull another bag if you know what I mean
---
I use Bloodied Pipe Pistol rifle modded for full auto and it's no slouch even against big enemies. 
---
I also have a Mutant The Fixer and a Bloodied Combat rifle chambered for 
---
.38, both of which are surprisingly lethal against every enemy, except the SBQ, which I have not tested them on.
---
oh... like the slugbuster.. gotcha.. yes those display properly. I thought it was a skin.  I have always dumped revolvers, so I was unaware. "Fancy Shotgun" sounds like a name in the Atom store.
---
For the curious.. How much do you price it at?
---
No, just direct impact
---
.... when you're driving your truck irl, but what you hear is the clomp, clomp of running in power armor.
---
Where are the mole minera
---
You either collect the ores, or you stay up top and defend the scavengers. Really simple. If you're going to collect the ores, make sure you've got some great radiation protection. If you're going to defend the scavengers, automatic weapons and gauss shotguns are your friends - something that is good for crowd control. The Glow Sight and Enforcer(if you have a shotgun) perks will help you tremendously with the defending. You can climb up on top of structures at both sides of the collection room and just shoot the ghouls by yourself if no one else shows up, but you can't collect the ore and defend by yourself. 
---
Just get in there and give it a whirl.
---
True, but they are almost always snallygaster for me. I think I have only seen supper mutants there a five or six times over the years? Maybe I am just lucky?lol
---
Go on Facebook groups. They are sharing through DMs. At least the PS4 one I’m in is.
---
Has been a Nightmare for me also.
---
Right now all i have is an Unyielding SS Chest,that i am using with my Unyielding Forest Scout Arms and Legs.
---
I stopped wasting Legendary modules all together when i realized there was no Deep Pocket Mod for the Limbs.I wont be using them yet anyway.
---
I am currently concentrating on trying to roll a Bloodied Gauss Shotgun.Have gone through 40 modules so far.15 scrip for each scripped Shotgun is not to bad either.
---
The 1911 would be cool as a 10mm skin but better as a new standalone that uses .45.
---
I'd love my m1 garand back too.  It would probably work as a fixer skin buy itd be better as a new weapon.
---
I know! I wish they had a chance to drop a rare cryptid outfit or weapon.... or anything other than pure junk, really.
---
That should be on a poster with a kitten on it.
---
Or jacket lol
---
Seen a few people offering to pay money for a dupe, no visable biters.
---
Or bottle
---
I'm working on a few things today, but after I check my berserker I'll let you know.
---
some skins can also display fine, I have a screaming eagle on a wall as well as a fancy revolver.
---
At level 40, that's an extremely viable way to do it. When you are only level 5 and still by the covered bridge by vault 76, being gifted a few guns sends you WAY overweight.
---
This was meant for the folks that are purposely trying to help newbies, not the ones who are (generously) giving away extra stuff that they don't want to store.
---
put it on and try it
---
Yes
---
If you join the BoS event Line in the Sand, you can walk away with two or three. I sell mine for 50 caps when full.
---
At this rate some other company should do it lol
---
Currently at work was just thinking about it will have to try when i get home lol
---
Only ever using power armor with big fights, sticking with sneak gattling gun otherwise!
---
Reminds me of a post from r/elitedangerous:
---
&gt;The grind is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but refuse. They cling to a faction, or roleplay, or pvp... illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is. But they'll never know this. Not until it's too late.
---
Does that mean 10% damage while aiming just is the direct impact as well? Because isn’t technically the explosion a “secondary” effect of the projectile so nothing would boost the explosion damage besides Demo expert?
---
If I go and no one shows up, I just start it. Either people show up or not, same with Project Paradise. If no one shows up, I go to the Randstag habitat, sometimes there's 2 or 3 legendary randstag, and sometimes another player will show up. Had it happen 2 times last week where I started it and another player showed up and we beat the event together.
---
Powerful automatic receiver vs .38 auto, seems an easy decision to me.  If magazine were 50 instead of 25 for stinging, then maybe.
---
If you travel around over fast traveling you have a good chance of finding small critters
---
Completely agree. Even did the leg work for bethesda a few weeks back.

Anybody selling serums for 15k deserves a hardware ban.
---
Psykoon is right, you can increase your damage output heaps with food buffs &amp; carnivore mutation.
---
This is what I recommend, you can sacrifice some DMG Resist for increase chem related perks.

---
That was my nice way of saying the same thing, just sayin.
---
Yea, Bethesda should just hire a third party to do all the work
---
Pretty much. The dark matter combat rifle for the Fixer is already on Nexus. Thank god, too. Feels like I actually earned something worth while.
---
Literally missed my point.  There was no emoting in these situations because I was in DM’s with these people.  
---
And yes, you’re welcome!  I think putting all my ammo in for free and plans I already know for free or low as hell is helping the community, new or not.  I don’t expect someone to message me and say “thanks for the free ammo” while I’m wandering around. 
---
But again, while I’m personally interacting with someone for a lengthy period of time while they’re on my team and talking directly to them? Yes, I believe that saying thank you and please apply in virtual worlds as much as in the real world.  Like the guy said above, it’s the internet so yes, I don’t expect much.  But if I gave you $5 while you were walking down the street wouldn’t it be the right thing to say, hey thanks I needed that? Is it fun to help?  Yes, of course it is.  I don’t one shot legendaries.  I help low levels with quests.  I genuinely do everything right and have since launch and that doesn’t mean I have an ego dude, it means I’m a good gamer who is just asking for a simple THANKS if I give someone a bunch of stuff.  
---
The world is messed up enough as it is right now.  Trying to teach a human lesson isn’t ego.
---
It'll be good for farming, a good way to save .45 ammo, and burn the copious amount of .38 ammo that you no doubt come up on.
---
Just do them by yourself, you might not beat the event, but you get tons of xp from both of those events.
---
Or very least come in and help them out
---
I dont know about stabelized but it seems like only explosive perks boost the explosion damage. They did the same shit in F4 (got a AA Fatman there, cursed a lot after seeing the effect)
---
There’s one in the Clinic in Harpers Ferry. Opens a level 3 safe. Also one at the Ranger Station.
---
There’s an abandoned cabin south of the Vantage on a cliff. Where I’m parked for now.
---
Same thing happens to me when I go into west tek with my main.
---
I feel incredibly stupid because TIL that snallygaster and anglers are cryptid
---
I have had a few of them.
---
One was 90% reduced weight.
---
I seem to get Broadsiders every other roll these days.Vampires.Mutants etc.
---
Pisses me right off sticking them in my Stash.
---
If i could smack her in the face with it,i would.
---
 LOL.  I dont think so.
---
You should do the unlimited camp budget glitch
---
It is a lonely road. I played Berserker for two weeks, wearing my hooded rags and dr perks like barbarian. I had decent DR. 
---
It was fun, cool, challenging... But it was nerfing myself: damage was low compared to almost any other build.
---
Generally 2 a piece. Down to 1 if it's not moving. 
---
I deal in bulk though. Scrapper perks and a few gun runs and I'm selling a few thousand steel.
---
Same as ammo pretty much
---
If you're also selling alot of acid and lead, an ammo heavy build will clean you out for thousands of caps
---
On some teams I understand being booted (I.E: being afk, sharing a card that destroys a build, engaging in PVP with everyone possible expecting your team members to bail you out) but in this instance I really don’t get what the deal with booting you was for the first team. Some people may just want to play with certain people but still get the public team bonus (second guy’s team).
---
I heard extra health by a few points is useless, but I also disagree with DMR resist over 350 becomes useless.
---
I dont have proof but I know for a fact from experience how much more damage I lose if I have &lt;400 DMR resist compared to 500+ while at 20% health constantly.
---
Yeah. I’ll test it out and see. But I think it has to say explosive damage or explosions explicitly to buff it. Like grenadier doubles the radius of the grenade launcher(s) explosions if maxes out.
---
I grinded hard scriping my 150 worth and doing all dailies for an extra 50 scrip to get my 4 rolls a day. Took me 6 weeks but now I have full unyielding as of yesterday... Now the quest starts to replace some of that unyielding with hopefully unyielding and AP refresh... It's exhausting being limited by the scrip machine not gonna lie but it is absolutely exciting when you see that roll. I scrolled my pip boy after making them see assassins, auto stim and then unyielding and them closed my pip boy, it took me a moment to realise as I just didn't expect it but there it was. My grind to get unyielding was over and I can take a more relaxed grind for better pieces
---
I didn’t think of using the track lighting. I know I have that plan already.
---
Agree. We could get that stuff from scrapping in Fallout 4, and don't see why we can't in this game.  Just adds unnecessary unfun grind to this game that makes people dislike it and leave bad reviews and give it bad word of mouth.
---
Bethesda should really rethink this, along with a lot of time wasters and unnecessary speed bumps in this game.  There's enough grind, especially with dailies and Wasteland stuff to keep people busy.  Cutting into peoples' limited play time (and ability to have fun) by forcing them to go away from their normal play paths to hunt for screws and springs (and sometimes other stuff like adhesive or aluminum) just irritates them and make them more likely to leave and less likely to spend on atoms or Fallout 1st.
---
And the time to replace anything complicated as the auto blueprints also make baffling chunk decisions.
---
but they do.  I sell everything wholesale; everything is at least 1/2 MSRP.  The highest I ever priced something was a pretty god role gauss rifle, that I put of for 1.5k.  I'm like walmart. It actually why I sit with my 30k cap pegged.  I watch free money go into the void every day.
---
Arent scrap kits in the misc section?
---
Yeah, white spring.  Also toxic valley outside of water park, usually a couple there and a few more by that farm SE of the hunting lodge.
---
A good sell? Shit, with how many of those I’ve gotten I just thought they were super common and sell them for 1 cap.
---
I started level 1, 4 days ago,  unfortunately no one helped me during that period.
---
Side with whoever you think is more interesting. Ultimately you should choose to keep all of the vault gold for yourself and build up reputation on both sides to get all of the rewards.
---
I looked through them briefly yesterday and didn’t find anything that stood out. I’ll take another pass through and see if I missed something.
---
To counter that, I had a guy buy three .45 bullets separately, for 1 cap each for the daily challenge :-)
---
5.56 goes like Hot Cakes.
---
It's been a glitch since wastelanders, at first it was a guitar, they fixed that, then it was the steel guitar, and they fixed that and now it's the bass!
---
I grabbed all the mats, my GT is BobaFettyWop
---
It took me a coupe of days server hopping but I did manage to find it for sale from the Brotherhood bot down in Watoga.
---
I hope they add more stuff to spend gold on. I’m close to 5000 and have everything I want. At this point I’m going to end up buying that water well to stay under 5k.
---
No code pieces required, just head on over to nukacrypt and get the code from there
---
You are not the same you that you were yesterday. The machine gets confused with all those new cells in your body.
---
If you’re on PC, there’s a solution to that on Nexus. That being the dark matter paint.
---
All the tunnels have what looks like ultracite ore on the walls, but it's not called ultracite - you can't miss it.
---
 There used to be a prototype radiation suit in the room directly off the room where the power armor workbench is at, haven't' checked to see if it's still there since Wastelanders. It's a different looking suit, but provides the same protection I believe as the regular suits.

I've gotten two different Junkies gauss rifles. One of them with faster fire rate sadly but man I can't even seem to sell them
---
Dude what the fuck...
---
I don't have much for my character other than that he was born after the bombs dropped and is not from 76, and is just biding his time as a settler in foundation until something more opprotune comes.
---
I'm a minor, so no. It's gonna be a long time for me to hit the age of 21 lol.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
Oh now thats a cunt move
---
And maybe ghillie grenades.
---
RNG
---
Quick change the system they are catching on!!!
---
its all RNG yo
---
:)
---
September 8th. But you need factor in that each rank costs more. Getting to Rank 50 takes 78,400 SCORE. Getting to Rank 100 takes 220,275.
---
That’s 141,875 for the second half. 
---
That’s almost double for the second half of Ranks. 
---
So it will take about twice as much effort to complete the second half. 
---
Now, we’ve just completed three weeks and have seven left. So if you’re at 50 right now you should be good. 
---
But not everyone can play every day. So giving a little bit of leeway is a nice gesture. There’s some wiggle room here. 
---
In other words, there’s multiple options for multiple player types.
---
just ask for one on the trade forum
---
Yeah
---
When somebody quits to Desktop instead of quitting to Menu, it autoboots everyone from their team.
---
If they quit to menu, they leave their team.  
---
It might be that, it's an odd implementation by Bethesda.
---
They broke so many things with the legendary run!
---
Holy shit I have been low balling my prices. That said, I'm pretty much maxed out on caps. I guess I'll keep doing what I'm doing.
---
1cap per steel effectively
---
Maybe 2
---
Do the math for bulk steel
---
Check YouTube. Couple people covered it, I like angry turtle's the best but that's just me
---
Edit: here is the link 
---
https://youtu.be/T-rwuuBluZM
---
I do it everytime it shows up
---
There isn't really rewards for siding with one faction over the other unless for a few options once you finish the quest regarding splitting the raid reward, the rewards come after when you increase reputation with each faction. From what i remember there are no repercussions on whichever you choose.
---
Added you! Thanks
---
There are 'lucky' servers. There's no way to tell which one, until you notice that there's a higher frequency of legendary enemies, higher frequency of 3 star drops, and higher frequency of relevant legendary effects. When I find one, I try to stay as long as I can.
---
Aw yeah I have a .38 fixer - it’s nice to use up that ammo.
---
 If we could just do the run multiple times, even with empty squares where the plans were, for the junk, scrip, lunch boxes etc.
---
If that guy quit to Desktop, it autobooted everyone on his team.  If he then re-joined the same world server, he might have just randomly joined a team, which was yours.
---
What you described happened to me too.  Also, one time when I was quitting to Desktop, I paid close attention to the screen to see what messages I was getting.  It turn out, the game kicked my entire Build team.
---
It was different than usual (I normally quite to menu, which just makes me auto-leave) so I was surprised.
---
Game might auto-boot everyone if someone crashes to desktop too.
---
One day old account.
---
I’m not entirely shocked how quickly this degenerated.
---
Take a look at the level of your ammo/weapons. Periodically you will need to upgrade to higher level items to keep in the game.
---
I don't think anyone has proof of this, but I feel like there's a lot of suspicions that it's the case. I've had similar instances like this happen, more often than not, it's a ton of Nocturnal garbage that drops for me, or I get on a roll of Suppressor items. I think it seems more likely that it's not one prefix, but a group of prefixes that might be favored on one server versus another.
---
I sell 308, 50 cal, 2mm, shotgun shells etc for 1 cap. They all sell often but I sell what I collect. I give away 38 or 44 ammo in my vendor for free for whoever wants it. And if I come across a vendor selling 556 or 45 ammo for 1 cap each then I will buy ALL you have. I gave a player 16 thousand caps because he had 8k of each so be warned about players like me that selling ammo in bulk you may end up going over Max caps. If I see a vendor selling for 2 caps then unless I'm really running short and don't have time to farm I'll just move on to the next one.
---
Knock out the new storyline to unlock the new form of currency and to start doing the dailies for the faction reputation grind. What kind of build are you?
---
Thanks I’ll check it out. 
---
I’m aware of photomode but looks like there are other options.
---
Step one mark the black titanium for search, step two go to mines and kill the mole miners, loot them and take the items with the magnfying glass. Also at burning mine there is a shit ton of black titanium. Then once you collect a bunch of those make sure to scrap all items and will have titanium ore, then like stated above you have to smelt it. Also I could probably do a run for you and give you black titanium free if your a low level.
---
That worked as You suggested - went in Adv. Möde (for a few hours to boot) - dropped out &amp; tried NW - it took about a minute but it found games since then &amp; that’s was that.  Thanks :)
---
If you are right then I think Two Shot is one of the only legendary prefixes that adds bonus damage to the explosions since it shoots two grenades for the price of 1 so there’d be two explosions.
---
Tesla  has a habit of being a bit indiscriminate.
---
Seen it happen at a few events where it comes up that a player is attacking me.
---
Weirdly it dont really happen with any other Gun during events
---
You can fire a Heavy weapon at a Queen event,and a players walk directly in front of your line of fire.And nothing happens.
---
Yet the Tesla would start PvP.
---
I saw about 8 players go after a Dude with a Tesla at a Queen event which was hilarious.They all stopped fighting the Queen and went after the Dude with the Tesla.He ran in to his Mobile Camp to try and escape.
---
Wasn't you was it :-)
---
Share Rad sponge and follow any bloodied builds around
---
In all that time, I've never been able the play that once.
---
Servers are searched for, and I can never find one.
---
Basically that part of the game doesn't exist for me 😢
---
Semi auto rifle build with a bit of stealth sprinkled in. I kind of winged it myself honestly.
---
Thank you for the advice! I’ll start with the storyline
---
I have close to 1200 levels combined. I am the man ND of player that helps newbies and gifts full sets of Unyielding armor.
---
Now, If you take a workshop, you offer yourself and become a sacrificial virgin. 
---
I don't care if you are level 8 and your best piece of armor is a nocturnal level 5 leather leg. 
---
There is no other PvP. 
---
Bring survival back.
---
Yes you can max both reps but it takes awhile. What kind of build are you planning on doing?
---
Happened here a couple times as well.
---
Same. All my skinned gun are on display. I’ve never had an issue displaying any.
---
I tried Encrypted once. Never. Again.
---
Its not per server, but it does seem to follow some sort of pattern sometimes. If you only have junkies weapons, you are more likely to get a junkies weapon, but not always, you still get the other crap as well. Some people believe you load an alt in that's full of legendaries that it will cause more legendaries to spawn, but never seen proof.
---
That’s what I did. Chambered my Fixer with .38 and use the .45 for my instigating Lever Action.
---
Floppy canvas.
---
Honestly, if you have a problem of too many notes, that means you just play too much. The ill-logical system behind it all is actually a common system in most games now. implement several currencies, make exchange rates complicated, the point is to make multiple grinds, capping how much anyone can dominate one market, and obscuring cost/value equations to help micro-transactions (ie, a 1200 'atom' skin will sell better than an $8 skin. this is also why you can't directly buy items in game, instead you have to buy bundles of atoms, because they don't want obvious exchange rates. when treasury notes were implemented I thought within a couple weeks they'd release a way to directly buy bundles of bullion, outside of smiley tho they haven't done anything like that...which is confusing. I suppose they didn't want more pay to play pushback, or maybe the point was just to make several capped grinds to encourage daily play, which then legitimizes the subscription fees/etc. who knows. original point remains tho... when i reach a cap i stop playing the game. i've unlocked ss armor, the power armor, the good guns, a few things i regret spending the bullion on, and i'm pretty sure i never broke 30 treasury notes, when i hit my daily cap is when i turned off the game.
---
You can max reputation with both no matter who you side with. It's more of a matter of who do you want to max first
---
I have a Snallygaster and my mom got a Deathclaw from Cranberry Glade. I keep my Fallout 1st camp there and travel there every once in awhile.
---
With Wastelanders a lot of Spawn spots are gone or messed up.
---
Same with armor. Need to upgrade as you level.
---
Are you on PC? I can definitely help out. I collect for....obvious reasons
---
She's not repetitive, there's just not enough of her material. You agree then, that there should be even *more* of her! Great idea!
---
So could you go with the settler's quest line but still max out both factions and get their rewards just one factions rep will move quicker ????
---
I'd never thought of this before, but this post has made me now want to share Sunkissed in every public team I join/create.
---
Edit - turns out I don't have enough Charisma anyway. Oh well.
---
Lol what!? Like a regular tadpole or arktos one? What color is it
---
Try looking at Fallout76Faction subreddit. They have many group recruitment posts.
---
Oh thats where you get that from had a fella come into my camp and damn near clear me out of ammo with that paintjob
---
Awesome! Thanks dude, you've kept my hope alive. Once I find the plans, I'm gonna start making a sign every time I claim a workshop that says "**SUCK IT, LARRY!**" so that my cousin sees them on random worlds after I leave. I'm hoping enough people start to see them that it becomes an urban legend one day.
---
I share ironclad, which I’ve also seen other people sharing so must be ok.
---
Seriously? I wish you were in my server would be nice to have someone with the cannibal perk since I dont have space for it anymore. That way i eouldnt starve if I run out of food since I got rid of the xtra food perks. Plus its our perks we can share what we want, would they rather us not share one at all? haha
---
I am but I'm not really that worried about it honestly, just think they are passing up potential atom shop purchases and find it funny.
---
The last time I tried installing a mod my game wouldn't launch either and I don't feel like keeping up with all of the updates just to keep my game working.
---
It was the perk loadout mod....... something that needed to be added to the base game a year and a half ago.  Modders did that shit in a few weeks, Bethesda says "Maybe this winter though ??"
---
Only had the underground Mirelurk on that one.
---
Wondering around looking for it forever.
---
Didnt know about this.
---
Thanks.
---
PS4?  Same, as well as Electrician Badge won’t acknowledge powering up a plant.
---
Could just copy the image in high def and take it down to kinkos to print. They dont ask questions and they will do it for any size. Now that I think about it, i may do that for myself.
---
I always go south of Hemlock Holes maintenance theres usually a grafton monster and a few snallys over there
---
I try to give back to this community after all they’ve done for me :) also cannibal is best
---
Yeah, I ran a few events and some common farm spots. 5 bloodied weapons in 4 hours is my record.
---
Do you have a plan? What kind of weapons do you want to specialize in. Now is the time to start making a commitment and focusing your special points, perk cards and gear to your goal.
---
It's great for shopping.  I'll join a team, hit every member's shop, then go to the next.
---
I'm at 1250 and it doesn't seem to have capped.
---
Yesterday I put on the mask but none of the candy bucket icons populated. I just sat there for 15 minutes
---
According to LoneVaultWanderer, they've already passed this along to the team.   
---
If you don't think that's enough, that's about all you'll get. &gt;\_&gt;
---
Jetpack and torso for sure. Easily my favorite item in the game. The mobility is amazing. I would give up everything in my inventory before I ditched the jetpack.  Again easily my favorite thing in FO76!! 👍👍
---
The whole SS armor set is great imo. Amazing defense and cheap repair as you dont need ballistic fiber. Its steel, plastic, and asbestos I think.
---
The biggest pain was rolling 2 pieces of acrobat to eliminate fall damage.
---
Slap the buttressed mod on everything and you are set. Just waiting on a few mods to be released for the limbs right now.
---
The SS underarmor is pretty awesome too when upgraded to shielded.
---
An honorable mention is the Raiders ammo machine. Awesome little thing that spits out ammo without you having to do anything aside from selecting which type. 
---
Good luck!!
---
What platform you play?
---
Your Hp and Thirst gives me anxiety! lol However i didnt know you could do this &lt;3
---
Have you ever had scorched snallygaster?  You don’t know what you’re missing if not.  A rare delicacy worthy of the wait!
---
I frequently share night person (6% xp boost at night) when inspirational is taken.  Haven’t had any complaints.  Wish the day cycle was easier to spot so I could find a good daylight perk.
---
There was one server where I decided to fight a queen cause I was bored I killed one of the mobs that was legendary and it dropped a BSS Combat Knife and right after we killed the queen she dropped a BEA Combat Rifle idk if that was a coincidence or server luck but that was the happiest day of my life
---
Ps4
---
Yes,its gotten worse since around the time the season started.
---
First it was a few scorched. Now it's scorched, ghouls, mole miners supermutants, wolves, etc etc.
---
Noticing more analog-stick x-axis lag too. I learned it's better to buy Bethesda on PC and deal with playing on medium (I own a laptop) than getting it on PS4. Some games just dont port over very well. Meh, win some lose some. Maybe I'll get an xbox next time around, who knows.
---
Yes!! I've gotten gauss weapons and SS armor pieces from the purveyor and recently Fasnacht.
---
You’re under the faulty impression that the opinion of an anonymous Redditor has any relevance to me, or that I have any inclination to engage you in a detailed conversation.
---
Finally some good fucking food - me after finding a scorched snally
---
I don’t think that vault 76 is a control vault, I actually believe it’s a test vault. The test, in my theory, was to see what would happen if people who survived the end of the world had access to the weapons that started it all, what would they do? There’s other vaults here in Appalachia of course that we don’t know the story to so of course we can’t really be sure
---
Mind if I add you? My PSN is MothmanLoyalist
---
Sent you two messages and havent got response
---
Everyone says FOMO.  It isnt FOMO.  We know we will be getting the items back, usually at a discount.  Thats the opposite of FOMO.  There is no missing out
---
Stop saying FOMO. 
---
When it comes to it, I think it is an issue within the mechanics of the game.  This was never a multi-player engine but they used it, and are trying to adapt.
---
It's best not to talk about him. If the Brotherhood found out, it would be.....troublesome.
---
Sure if you want PSN Priest1503 im uk tho so wont be on for about 13 hours gotta go to sleep then go shopping but when im back im up to play
---
gpu dont/souldnt thermal throttle until 85 or so , most pcs run around 65-75 so pretty sure its not heat , pretty sure its either drivers ,settings of some sort, or game engine
---
Do yourself a favor and progress both settler and raider storylines at the same time until they both make you choose a final path. Spoilers but you can search if you’re interested. Lots of people advanced one path at a time and got angry
---
 I've spent probably 100k worth of junk to get the mods.  It's brutal.
---
What system?
---
"I'm only here for the wings" lol
---
Basically there is a hole in the roof. Word of caution: you can walk on pipes/containers when your on top of the roof but not on the roof itself- hence jetpack needed
---
There are ways but I feel like there is a difference between griefing and wanting to pvp for fun
---
Ight sounds good mate ill add you and we can game when your on again. Have a good one fam.
---
The new currency is lackluster to say the least...
---
Invite me and I'll go to your camp:)
---
You are a level where you are underpowered for missions in the divide and eastward, but overpowered for things in the west.  
---
thats normal.
---
back burner the divide and eastward stuff, and head to the ash heap.  Work on the excavator quest (miner miracles).  The mysteries questline, the BoS questline (starts with recruitment blues @ camp McClintock.
---
If you havent already, joint the pioneer scouts.
---
That i shall Hail m o t h
---
I just go around with Chinese stealth suit death clawing everything
---
Same here lol. I landed three plans from about a dozen runs, learned one, and sold the other two for 25c each.
---
I sold one recently for 1500c. It lasted about half an hour in my vendor at that price. I saw another player trade one here for 5000c worth of Stable Flux.
---
I'm on a private world mate
---
Cryos also seem to benefit from this.
---
K I'll invite you, my camps in the bog
---
Be prepared to lose SCORE points. Happened to me for the first time today
---
Nice! Idk if you wanna spoil the rewards for yourself but there’s some specific ones you can get depending on who you side with, but in the end you can get pretty much everything, it just takes awhile to grind the reputation of whoever you don’t side with. 
---
You can join an event public group if you get bored and wanna mess around for a little, but even if you’re playing solo and just doing the missions you should start a public group for building because it gives you an extra one intelligence even if nobody else joins, which gives extra xp.
---
Also, there is the “legendary run” that a lot of people say can distract you from playing the game. On the menu or online look up all the legendary run rewards and decide if any are super important for you to get, so you can know how much you need to focus on those. It’s basically is daily and weekly challenge, which you’ll completely even if you aren’t trying to, but if you want to get some of the deeper rewards you’ll need to make sure to do all the challenges offered every day. I personally didn’t see anything I was dying for and I’ve ignored doing them and I’m already around level 20 for the season.
---
Sorry it’s a lot but that’s basically all the new stuff I think, plus we have another new storyline coming out in a month or two!
---
Ptoabaly can't do that without a GT, you can look mine up and join, I'm in a public
---
Hey man. Don’t worry. I have been playing since day one. I died a lot too, early on. But that’s part of what makes this game fun. Man, I remember how awesome it felt exploring places I’ve never been. Not knowing what was around the corner. Those were the good old days. Now? 462 levels later? I don’t have/get the same feeling I did when it was all fresh and new. But I’m still playing. Only one character. I have done it all. I have finally gotten my ‘god roll’ weapons and armor. But I keep playing. Because I love fallout. And this game is still great despite its flaws. My advice to you, would be; relax. Don’t worry. Soak it in. This game has flaws. But it’s still great.
---
Who says we want to open up to griefing? Don't put words in our mouth all we wanted is team pvp back through a new fair method, god mode patched(Thank you Godd Howard), and weapon damage cap changes
---
Well fuck. Now I feel stupid.
---
55 actually.
---
That’s yo to you
---
This is sad.
---
No idea why some players are so cruel.
---
I have no interest in any of the Legenderies these days.Only the T-Bonds.
---
If you are high level and reading this.
---
Do as i do Equip a Weak Gun.Dont one shot all the Mole miners.Let the lower levels get some Booty also.
---
Remember how excited you were back in the day anticipating a better weapon than what you had.Think of others enjoyment.
---
Same with One Vilent Night,and Camp Fire Tales.Let the lower levels Tag at the [end.It](https://end.It) is no good to us.But means a lot to them.
---
I feel like if there were more incentives people would pvp but being the small percent of the fan base we often get shut out and our voice isn't heard at all.
---
That would be awesome if you could make a Cracker Barrel type camp
---
I want Dane Rodgers to make a glorious return to Appalachia. I’d love to party with that guy!
---
Isnt all the xbox one games playable on the series X?
---
Because you can easily getting a shit load of resoruces with minimal work.  I literally have over 200 screws and over 150 balistic fiber and I don't even go hunting for it. It just ends up in my inventory. An I bulk and sell a lot of screws and springs just to make space in my stash. Which again I don't even grind for they just end up in my stash.
---
I’m sure typing out such comments amuses you right now. 
---
But sometime in the future, in the middle of the night, you’ll remember moments like this and have to deal with the depression and regret and pathetic feelings of cringe and wonder to yourself, *‘Why the hell did I do that?  What was I thinking? Who was I trying to impress?’*
---
So, please; continue. Add more fuel to the future fire of self-loathing and regret.  Knowing that you’ll weep over your childish inane follies brings a smile to my face.
---
Titally agree.
---
Bloodied build and team mate shared sun kissed level 3.  Didn't realize until damage output was akin to throwing rocks at tanks.   Pretty funny at the time.  Ditched team immediately and found another one to meet challenge requirements.
---
Like most, I help casuals and team up.  Often they share that perk.  Odd that peeps have charisma 9+ to share that since 4 is the norm. I miss the old days when sharing was dependent upon points instead of SPECIAL
---
Today I learned people will believe anything posted on this sub. This is bad information and you should be ashamed for it. Too bad reddit doesn't have a report option for misinformation.
---
I like trap camps since it keeps me on my toes. There are easy signs to tell if it is a trap camp but for the most part I hope they don't remove them
---
Point stands about increased SCORE requirements for the second half.
---
That's pretty much where I'm at yeah. I can kill things very quickly in the forest but if I go anywhere else I get fucked up and blow through all my ammo/stimpaks. I just got beat to death by a level 45 irradiated radstag trying to find the sword for the mysteries quest. Everywhere else getting murdered was fine but that was very disheartening. I'm keeping all my armor and weapons leveled up with me too so I'm getting kind of frustrated. I think I'm also just being impatient.
---
Okay! That’s a lot to go off! Thank you :) it’s really exciting being back, this is such a a great game and it has had so much happen to it!
---
There is no better build.  For my commando I use primarily a b3325 fixer with a b2525 handmade.  
---
Only one that is close is sneak rifleman because the lever action rifle is by far the most ammo efficient gun in the game.  Add a fixer with .38 bullets and you will never run out of ammo. 
---
If bullets aren't an issue then commando is much better.

- Equip travel agent under charisma, 30% discount for fast travel. Avoid travelling when a good brisk jog will do. 
---
- Sell junk to any of the vendors daily for 1400/day. Anything you have extra can be sold for caps. 
---
- Sell plans/ammo at your vendor. This will become easier as you level up and acquire better shit. Any junkies/bloodied/furious/twoshot/explosive will net you at minimum several thousands caps when sold. Use fed76.info to get a better idea of what items are worth selling. 
---
- Hop on market discord, people buy script @ 15c each which means a 3 star is 600 caps a pop even if its garbage. 
---
good luck.

Max int, xp boosts, grind.  Most folks that finished it almost immediately likely used the god mode bobble stacking bug, but you can have grounded it out. I went from ~25 to ~75 when double xp was going on. But that is a maxed int/do build setup.
---
I've done that.  I don't need to buy the ammo, but i'm forced to do for Daily.  I want to spend 1 cap per item, because I don't need them.  Good to know others (most??) do this.
---
Way late man. I already put out a mistake post way before it hit 350. Back at like 15. I even posted pictures of my ammo and stash.

My friends insist that Uncle Todd slips you the codes.

Oh I've definitely had some of my best moments in Fallout in this game so far. I was going to a mission and saw a location I could discover when a level 65 deathskull radscorpion and an albino radscorpion popped out of nowhere. I started running and burning through my stimpaks until I found a bus. I hid inside and just cried for help. Some level 270 just casually walked by, blasted them all away and just thumbs upped me before he left. I just gotta pull back and remember this isn't just another Fallout game. I can't get my head out of that mentality.
---
Your title is a clusterfuck but Im guessing youre asking if next gen consoles get fo76.
---
Id say this is highly likely to happen.
---
I like it, but I desperately want to know what S.C.O.R.E officially stands for.  I do feel like I’m being consumed by the Legendary Run though, with kids, I only get around half an hour a day to play and that’s used doing challenges instead of finishing off the main quests.  I’m 104 and nowhere near finishing either main quest line.
---
Good luck!  It's a great idea.   I've been doing something similar, after I claim a workshop I make a wall near the entrance with the works "***** Sucks"   Won't say the name in case it upsets the admins but suffice to say it's a famous politician.  A lot of people have seen them and sent me thumbs up messages or positive comments.  Love it.
---
Thank you kinds sir
---
There are screwdrivers all over the place, just use one of them?
---
After wastelanders dropped there were a number of changes to the map. Pretty sure they removed items from the game cause they were causing issues with players or mobs getting stuck.
---
I do all of those my dude
---
Exactly the same. Electrician and Abandoned Bog Town.
---
Woops forgot to pay you
---
Fire Truck at WS is also gone.
---
It's probably just RNG - but historically computer based RNG is very streaky.(And I've been playing around with computer RNG since the TRS 80s came out!)  If I get three or more nocturnals in a short period I most definitely change servers or log out for awhile.
---
Nah on ps4
---
Play time daily collecting flowers should be enough for multiple characters to meet the weekly challenge w/out effort.  Just sayin'
---
I did no response
---
Yes exactly.
---
You guys rock! Launched my first Nuke a couple nights ago thanks to your site. Hit Silo Bravo - Solo - at level 45... it sucked and took 5 hours. I was so excited to get that SBQ. Once I got to the blast zone, I was extremely disappointed. Some lvl 400+ had a camp built right next to the radius, and his camp was literally a closed up sky scraper ( like 6 stories ) she never came down close enough to really do anything and then dies 30 seconds later, landing on the sky scraper. So anticlimactic.
---
Sucks bro. I do all of them and always have tons of caps (22k atm trying to dump some to open my vendors again). Its definitely on the more stingy side but not untenable.
---
That’s... really stupid. First off, most of those people are either farming levels or farming the limited rewards. And others just want that score BONUS. It’s not needed to complete the run, it’s purely based on whether or not you want the bonus or not. Then again, I’m not sure what I expected out of someone who complains if nuclear winter, a large part of fallout 76, is even acknowledged.
---
Some people are too young or naive. They won't cannibalize corpses but they will happily eat their iguana bits. 
---
Sure, sure... "Iguana on a stick".
---
You can make your 1400 caps easy just selling glowing meat and irradiated or glowing or whatever it is blood. I do it whenever I can.
---
That's fucking badass, dude! I'll keep an eye out for that; what platform are you on?
---
No problemo
---
Depends what your current build is really. Everything is changeable/fixable but if it's going to take a lot of levels it is easier to start a new toon.
---
Well you can post again. I see the same posts at a few different times of the day
---
It depends... how many points would you have to move? I know ppl are able to get a lot of early levels fast, but if you have only a few hours a day or such.
---
That’s always how it seems to go. People tend to join later when they see others are doing it.
---
Explosives have armor bypass by default so it already armor pierces.
---
Sorry totally got distracted i posted this.  So its a workshop blueprint trying to use it in same works shop but it wont align because i cannt back up far enough to make it line up.   I didnt know if there was a way to shift the blue print without moving my toon or is smaller blueprint the only solution.  It is the miner museum and i tried to get all the extractors on one blueprint.  Thanks.
---
Hopefully the fact that there’s repeated interest will encourage them to make the change, as happened with the Ammo Converter.
---
Rebuild.  Getting to 60ish is daunting.  Regardless of the perks you have chosen, seems like a lot of extra work to get there.
---
I did it for my first ever Nuke totally satisfying
---
Yeah I’ve heard that glad to know it’s true. So does AA effect the explosion so it’s like an extra armor bypass/reduction?
---
And the day before I’ll blow most of the atoms I gained on the last 10 or 15 spaces. It’s doable, especially if you went and did the NW ones. Which I avoided.
---
You’re good. It’s hard to tell early on what’s rare and what’s not, and RNG is so unpredictable.
---
I landed two full Blue Ridge Caravans outfits within the first week after the Wastelanders update. This was before I joined the market reddit, so I didn’t know people were selling outfits for 20-30k caps and even landing god rolls and legacies for them.
---
I kept one and ended up selling the other for about 1000c lol.

You can grind each side to completion after you finish Wasteland storyline. Don't choose a side at the end, take the gold for yourself.  (Ok you have to choose a side, but you don't need to play nice and give them your gold).

I’ll be that guy; I still like your opinion and think this would be well placed but maybe a nerf. Because crafting. Scrapping*

There were about 12 people in the one I played this afternoon. Finished in less than 5 minutes due to the number of us mining ore.

You know that the ToS, which you didn’t read but said you did anyway and hit “accept” on specifically says not to knowingly use game exploits, right? 
---
And “punish the dealer not the user”? Really? I mean, yeah, I don’t want some tweaker selling meth on the street corner either, but literally everybody should know *not to take meth in the first place*

Does that mean the only thing that would “effect” the explosion damage is two shot since there would be now two explosions instead of one?
---
There’s that one guy in crater, he wears a suit, I hope we get a quest from him sometime

I don't think turning off the game when you hit 20 notes would be a consideration for a lot of players it certainly isn't for me obviously.

you have Gauss legendaries on sale? I will buy it for reasonable price

Doesnt help that all of my stash is just junk
---
If you’ve found a cool structure, don’t take a picture looking directly at it. Get it from an angle, with the camera lower and pointed up. Even if it’s a small thing, it will make it look more impressive. And if the “face” of the object is looking to the right of the camera, have the object take up the left third of the screen. If it’s facing left, then have it be in the right third.

ricochet is a 18% chance serendipity for ranged attacks only.

 To be honest, if you don't like the group, you can leave, start a new group, join other groups or change servers. 
---
It is the idea of "groups", you know. People with similar interests.
---
I hunt Wendigos for the screws.  Pylon site, Whitespring, Nuka plant, a few other places
---
When the perk procs and deflects damage, you take zero damage from that ranged hit. So it is basicly a 18% chance to ignore ranged damage. The sound it makes can start to annoy you a wee little bit :D

Yer I knew about the 5k cap on bullion and Im assuming the same for notes just not sure.

They have their own set of weapon and armor penetration perks under perception. Archer/Expert Archer/Master Archer for damage and Bow Before Me for armor penetration and change to stagger.
---
You’re not wrong there
---
Welp. Time to farm most likely a TS Auto Grenade Launcher.
---
Exactly. I haven't seen a single serious PvPer been anything but supportive of giving PvE players ways to avoid PvP/griefing. The majority of us are simply looking for better PvP balance and fewer restrictions placed on those seeking PvP. We aren't looking for new ways to grief anyone, just a more fair approach to protecting PvE only players.
---
I want a real life set of perk cards
---
is the same as getting mad to the teacher when the kid get low grades. have my upvote sir.
---
it's not a good comparison for several reasons. but one of them being that Bethesda is being less than candid about Fo76. from the team behind it clearly being out of their depth, to the mobile-esque tactics employed to keep people hooked, which are nothing short of disingenuous.
---
yes, we all agreed to the ToS. but personally I find it hard to fault cheaters when the game tries it hardest to F players over at every turn. look at how ludicrous the legendary system is, for an example.
---
Just tried launching nuke, got to last room went to insert keycard and boom crashed. All wasted...
---
Just recently started “bowing” It up wit max rank “bow before me”,&amp; expert &amp; Master bowman...

Creepin around wit my combat knife &amp; my bow getting things done.

Haha I own that one too. My bad.
---
There's a number of places on the map it spawns you after drinking Nuka. It's suppose to happen.
---
xbox here, but same issue
---
Absolute false rumors and hearsay some people spread early on when game was launched with zero evidence to back it up. I have \~2000h in this game and i have never experienced this. It is just RNG.
---
If you are on PS4, there is a facebook group organizing nukes in series, so you can try another one.  Wasteland Rogue Traders.
---
You’re right and all I just need what it’s classified so I have a chance of getting in the free legendary at the end of the wayward quest line.
---
Are there messages between players on PC or is that just the consoles?
---
I have one, it kicks ass.
---
The solution is to keep holding Bethesda over the coals over this, never let them forget, and keep demanding compensation! But alas they've been quite Adamant about not doing anything at all to help, every ticket I send just gets auto locked...
---
They can provide atoms, they just won't!
---
That’s fine. Just so long as you know that the game isn’t designed for you to dominate a given market.... so you will have wasted notes. I would also suspect if you play that much that scrip and caps are an issue as well. I can’t put vending machines out because bottle caps capped too low and I drop most legendaries items because of the scrip cap. Just the nature of gaming in 2020.
---
are you doing pickets fort location?
---
It took me ages to get this one hahaha. Where’d you get it maybe I’ll have some of that luck.
---
I like sharing Squad Maneuvers 2 with CHA 6. It’s a nice little bonus that helps everybody and doesn’t eff with any builds. (At least as far as I know...)
---
It makes sense cause the fixer is meant for stealth types builds due to the special bonus.
---
Yeah i've had it happen on two different occassions now and have falled  behind. What sucks is i'm away for the double score event so that is not going to help me
---
you will get to a point, where you have to scrap. You're at the 30k limit, so you can't sell. Your vending machines are full and your stash topped off.
---
With that in mind, I've scrapped(scrip) so many bloodied/junkied/furious  guns because I had nothing else to do with them. The other option is to give them away, which I do often.
---
Who knows but you can still play it on the new Xbox even if they don't make a new version
---
I honestly think it depends on how much longer they plan on supporting 76 with new content
---
It depends how far away you are, but it’s probably best to just restructure. The levels between 50-100 are the easiest to grind because you’re usually able to kill big stuff by then, so they can go by quickly.
---
Use V.A.T.S to kill things, when you run out of AP just hop on top of that one decontamination chamber that can’t be used in the extraction room, you might need marsupial though
---
"Completing a number of daily quests" too, finishing Mistaken Identity is a victim of this.
---
Yup, add that to the list.
---

The fact that you spawn behind a tree in relation to them means you can usually lob a grenade at them undetected and cut 'em down enough to just one-shot each of them.

Nuka shine makes you black out and you wake up in various places.
---
Admittedly I'm no scientist or engineer but I'm having difficulty believing that's true man. I mean as far as the fallout universe goes we have regular laser guns (red) and Ultracite laser guns (green) so having different color lasers is already real.
---
In reality, can't light and therefore lasers be any color? Including frequencies beyond the visible spectrum so for all intents and purposes, invisible?
---
If you need serendipity and don't have it equipped? Then it's your own fault for having a bad build!

For some reason a lot of my challenges are stuck. Like it says I haven’t discovered the 5 big locations in 3 regions but I check my map and I clearly have.

Bring back the .38 pistol, bring back 9mm, or change .38 to 9mm. Tbch they should do sll
---
Do you mean a free one from the vending machine things? Bow is not one of the options. See [the wiki entry](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elusive_Crane) for a list of what you get.
---
Wtf...well, um.... Thanks for the wardrobe suggestion.
---
Console has messages built into the consoles firmware. Pc users have a mod I believe for an ingame chat.
---
oh dang what does it sound like?
---
That's awesome. I tried to take a similar pic (or screenshot really) the other night when we were all waiting at Drop Site for a nuke to go off and start Scorched Earth, and another SB wandered over from the other fissure. The 15 or so people there made short work of the intruder, and I thought I had a great pic of us finishing it off just as the nuke exploded, but it did not come to pass. :/
---
tyvm man
---
This is why I'm not grinding super hard, there's still like 50 days left.
---
I do think we should still be able to earn a few atoms every day though, instead of them completely removing them. Maybe 5 per challenge and more for the weekly ones?
---
Oh I apologize, i must have misread
---
Am on PC, can someone walk a slightly crunk person through this? XD pm me if poss , need it for obviously later 😂😂😂👌😒

Go to a 76 subreddit and buy one. It's faster then running the queen 300 times to get it.

Tysm!
---
Both the pipe rifle and the Fixer are great in fully automatic, both accept that ammo type!
---
Good
---
"utility" better not mean ATX
---
I mean aesthetics wise, the pipe guns are fallout but they look pretty bad. And you can use .38, imagine running through your 20 lb pile in a few minutes and blasting ever away
---
I have some candy..... down in my basement 👇😈👿😈👿😈
---
2000 atoms!!!!
---
Across the whole map... in mine and the like
---
I would like to know too I have searched all over the place and can’t find any good ones.
---
I get the noise every now and then. I have no idea why it plays but I'm working on what makes it play when it does play (if that make sense). I think I've narrowed it down to taking rad damage.
---
Or just a big sloth.
---
Yeah. I can somehow melt down the screwdriver for screws....but can't use it to take a screw out of a gun. Fallout problems.
---
More weapon variety tho....
---
And it would be nice to have more guns, and I hate pipe guns.
---
Imo I think modus and zax are boring used up cliches, but I love modus anyways

Make sure to get as much rep out if both camps before you make your decision. 
---
And share half of the gold with the faction you choose. Gold is easier to grind than reputation is.
---
Same here like its ether they are missing song or have 100's that aren't even from the same game or radio channel
---
And consider it’s a simulation; he’s repeatedly torturing people. Over and over.
---
On occasion logging off and back on will fix the issue. I had this happen a few days ago with the modding power armor one and after waiting like half an hour for the atoms to show up, I switched characters and I got the atoms.
---
The pipe guns seem to be the most accurate gun in the game at the moment, the hit chance is amazing, and i can head shot snipe just about everything with one, in full auto mode!
---
Yeah they are.
---
I’m guessing they are wondering if it will be improved for next gen?
---
This is exactly what I’ve found I did find one that had old time music and commercial which kind of fit but still feel like it’s lacking something.
---
Let's make it fun. If you can find the weapon I am looking for, you can have any of my Gauss rifles.
---
I want Bloodied +40 power attack or faster swing knuckles, max level.
---
Yup
---
I actually really like the tree :) but yes, those items you mentioned, along with the Captain Cosmos outfit and PA+Jepack is on my list. OH yeah, I need to get that sweet paint for my T-65 set  :)
---
*you’re
---
Same here
---
I remember the buttons to control the elevator would often stay in one position while the elevator moved without them. Were there any other issues, and what were they?
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0aNguvibqd3uMEb1AJzf4g?si=rdDQMU_uSrq-Jdz_6YtZAA was it this one?
---
Tried again when I got on and the wander lady still isn’t giving me a quest. I finished Beckett and Sophia. Was looking forward to the other allies but none will give me anything. Restarted and tried each one and nothing.
---
The weapons cam be bought regardless of which faction you pick. The ONLY exclusive item is the slugbuster gun if you side with the raiders. Which isnt that big of a deal. What you should do is look up the quests on the Wiki. You can do the first few quests for both sides before you have to "Side with" either. If you do both you will get some nice stuff and then can pick which faction to go with.
---
Catch the commie everyone! I found them!!!
---
Yup. Bows and compound bows are in her pool (and some others) once you learn the plans.
---
Sorry I was just trying to agree
---
This\^, and calibrated for your farming set, ap whatever (build/play-style dependent) for your kill stuff set. pa is easy to please sinse all the mod plans for what you need are available for purchase at npc vendors.
---
57 currently but with tommorow starting double daily score weekend I’m hoping to be a bit higher, really like the plushie, planets and stars wallpaper and just general atoms rewards.
---
What’s the strange effect strange in numbers and bird bones clash with?
---
Like... Have they even seen a f*cking iguana? 
---
Might as well be eating wendigo scrotum soup.
---
They must all know of The Flesh.
---
I have the bow so that’s good for me. Any idea on where to find crossbows?
---
Give us working one armed bandits, too; the model is in NW after all. Gambling for caps thanks!
---
I can always handle one side killing all or em with no casualties, it's the other side that's the problem.
---
Yea, that is one of the locations. Other locations include Central Mountain Lookout, Dent &amp; Sons construction, and Johnson's Acre.
---
So far, I have gotten the witch plans and have run into the witch three times. Please let me know if you are still seeking her because I have a spare plan (on PC).
---
so why is is getting to level 60 so difficult
---
I don't wear PA so that stuff doesn't have much pull for me. I just want more live things at my camp. Still need to tame/pacify a megasloth now that I finally have the perks.
---
I feel you I had to mass give away plans and weapons and scrap them because I was full and had full cap of caps so it all had to go. But in the future I can buy Bloddied or junkies from you if your on ps4.
---
Sure thing, kid.
---
It's a glitch, you lose event points and there is no way to get them back. Challenges autocomplete.
---
Can't trade strangler mate
---
I only wear it when fighting the queen and hunting flux. It would be great if there were SS skins on the board... but alas
---
My favorite unlock so far is the first stars wallpaper. The planets one is a little too much for me somehow.
---
LOL well it is Bethesda, there has to be something... thanks for the heads up
---
Most misc mods don't actually work, it sucks.
---
Lol def in the top five worst attempts of being funny.  Gratz
---
Most ive sold one for is 7776c
---
I'll be using the Chinese stealth armor for that probably. For now I just stay outside the circle
---
I bought one for 100 caps out of a vendor lol
---
F
---
Just keep anything that has good perks, or a good combination of perks. Transfer them to an alt when you get full.
---
I was just going to ask the same question OP.  I went through the ENTIRE Big Bend Tunnel TWICE and No Survivors.  I found a few dead folks and a Fire breather (Sorry for Spoiler)...
---
36 right now. Can't wait to get that plushie!
---
Wow thats right fucked man. You should ask for a refund on your atoms
---
Yes! Finally something cool that was built on pc. I'll add you as a friend so I can see it if you dont mind. How long will it stay up?
---
nah.. the stealth armour is good for some things, but you always need a good set of PA in emergencies.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Cooking_stove
---
Probably for some people who don’t have weapons capable of killing them quickly and having multi hit weapons like explosive. I Haven’t attempted the event at a low level either and there are scorch beasts that are flying around.
---
does it stack with serendipity?
---
Everyone wants a damn legacy, it makes trading impossible! Sorry that I didn't play when the Croc bag was available, no I don't have a legacy nor do I want to trade my left kidney or the soul of my firstborn to get one!
---
Cars are everywhere and yet...
---
Yeah, same thing happened to me today. I try messaging them every now and asking what’s up, but they usually respond hella toxic so I just move on
---
(Super) Duper Mart has all the plans.
---
before you deactivate turrents. switch them to shoot everything. Clears out most of the enemy robots for you too.
---
Wanna borrow my junkie explosive combat microphone?
---
thanks but im xbox i was at the dam for so long
---
I can only imagine the crazy shit people would build, I second this.
---
yes, they're two different things. what I meant is that they work the same, both have a % chance to ignore all damage.
---
the only difference (apart from the lower % chance of course) is that ricochet only works with ranged damage.
---
I will look for that option. Does that give me XP or no?
---
There's a crossbow and plan at the archery range by the scout camp, and a crossbow up on some rocks at the southern end of the pond at that hippie place.
---
With how scare the lunchboxes are this is inexcusable!
---
Someone got a little excited a you know...
---
If you're hoping to get to 100 you need to buckle down. The math says you should be at 48 with today's challenges to be on par to get to 100 by the last day
---
I don't think so, but trust me, there's enough robots it doesn't matter. The damn things swarm you so hard.
---
Should’ve been the level 100 reward
---
Aren't they all called Cooking Stove though?
---
This is a day one bug. Same goes for a bunch of them. Beth auto fixed some months, uhhh, almost a year ago. Nonetheless, I've killed +/- 100 SBQs solo, two accounts, and neither account acknoweledges the feat...however, when I get to 7600 hours, and I will, I want my f'n 40 atoms.
---
Right. Whenever I talk to him he goes through a couple lines of dialogue before the quest activates. It's just a slow response.
---
oh shit my bad. Thanks for telling me.
---
I visited you have a cool camp
---
Over time Ive learnt to manage caps and weight but that's the thing,you can manage them.with notes you cant.yer turn off the game when you hit cap, that's not not going to happen and I'm sure its not intended
---
Nice! I almost feel bad when I see something rare for cheap. I bought a rad barrel plan for 250c the other day, as well as western outfit for 5c.
---
Grafton station vendor bot !
---
Yup farmed the airport for ammo so many times.
---
Not sure if you're suggesting that Super Duper works when crafting Secret Service armor, but it doesn't.
---
It'll make the sound like Super Duper is working, but you won't actually have more armor pieces in your inventory than the number of modules you crafted with. 
---
Just for clarification.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gyjfw4/super_duper_doesnt_work_when_crafting_secret/
---
People didn't get banned with the raider rep glitch why would they ban people for this one lol
---
Dang, thanks for the heads up. Hopefully I'll be able to catch up a bit with the double score weekend.
---
I felt like I was getting score from nowhere also, could just be lag between completion and being awarded
---
Buying levels to make up for that small of a difference right at the end should be ok. For the schedule, the last week is only allotted for like 6 levels. Easy enough to fill in the gap at the end.
---
Search this sub for legendary run and you should find a google doc that shows you the daily progress needed to get to 100 on time.
---
Oooh free steel!
---
Yeah I'm prepared to buy up to the last 5 levels incase shit happens where I lose the small lead I have.
---
Beat me to it
---
MODUS is very unsettling, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't like his intensely sinister characterization. I've wondered how they came to the face he has, though. A compilation of people? A programmer? Or something designed to be specifically intimidating, like they crossed Slugworth from Willy Wonka, with the devil. 
---
Great, now I'm imagining what would happen if Mr House encountered MODUS.
---
Yeah, that happens.  I just dump some stuff into the overseers stash just in front of the wayward now.
---
I've had this glitch for weeks
---
Depends on the mask you need, and the platform.
---
omg that makes perfect sense
---
I guess another case of players assuming Bethesda puts deeper meaning in their writing
---
I think you’re an immature individual. The term ‘kid’ is relative. 
---
The best part about your replies is since they’re all vulgar, it gives me another one to report. 
---
Please, continue.
---
Not anymore you got them for an event which doesn’t appear anymore.
---
You spelled tedious wrong
---
Thanks mate wanted to make it as cult like as I could and ledt some water supply for people who visit.
---
I am on the xbox :/
---
Oh trust me, I’m intrigued by his character too. But I have to give credit to Bethesda for legitimately making me unsettled by a character in a fallout game. (Not creatures). Though floaters as enemies are a bit creepy.
---
Here :)
---
Wonder if it's another stealth nerf to keep players grinding more and more.
---
Yes you can. Not participating in events because you don’t need the notes, is the same thing as when you stop legendary or bottlecap farming because you’re maxed out. Think of the ‘notes’ the same as you think of those stashed legendaries that you only hold onto to scrip.
---
How does one transfer to their alt?
---
Ran it again today. I had all 3 pylons activated and was hiding in the shed. The imposter was exposed for over a minute and a half while I hid in there and killed any gutsy's that came in. The other 5 people? Didn't do a damn thing. They just stood around, not one of them trying to kill the imposter (and several we're over level 200, so I assume they know what to do).
---
So damn frustrating. I had it set up for them, and they squandered the chance.
---
Got about 450
---
Not really a raid boss, just a boss. Also that will be the 3rd boss, imposter sheepsquatch is a boss also
---
Ehhh... nope... he's selling one but it says I already know it, which I don't. I know the plans for all of the basic cookers Except the one for an actual modern stove.
---
Do the masks differ from console?
---
I have a bunch of them in selling for real cheap on the xbone.
---
Make jokes but if you put 2 off the windego collous sacs you get from killing  in a display case it will actually make windego scrotum lol
---
Hit 50 this morning, still one weekly left to complete. The plushy was awesome, have him greeting visitors as they approach my banjo. 
---
Next up for me is the ultracite PA skin at 63? I think. Caps, atoms, and perk packs along the way are gravy.
---
Biggest take away so far are the star wallpaper, and hoping the stars and planets will look even better in the sub basement.
---
Oh danmnn they really need to make fo76 a crossplat game
---
That’s sick... I never knew you could build that close to eating a and the railroad bridge. I’ll have to add that to my list of future camp spots
---
Noice!
---
My sniper uses just one, and it worked fine with just a little sway six months ago, which was the last time I used the toon. 
---
Try removing the mod, test/baseline, then reapply and test. If you do not see a change, take a video and submit it with your ticket...or hold your breath. Either will result with the same outcome.
---
Few ways. Ask for a courier to help, or have First and deposit in a container, like at a train station in a private world and then join back with the alt. Could use friends to help too. If you play solo get a courier it's risk free.
---
Can I ask your gamer tag then so I can maybe buy?
---
The Queen sometimes despawns like this and you can find plans and legendary weapons in the pile. I haven't decided if it's worth visiting the typical fight sites at every server hop or not.
---
Straight from the link:

&gt; Unlocks
---
&gt;The plan allows the **stove** version of the [cooking station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cooking_station_(Fallout_76\)) to be crafted at a [C.A.M.P.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Construction_and_Assembly_Mobile_Platform) or [workshop](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Workshop_(Fallout_76\))
---
Cooking **Stove** and Cooking **Station** are two separate things.
---
I pull out my compound bow for fun from time to time. My character is a rifleman so I can pretty much take out the rifle perks and put on the archer perks. It’s slow so I don’t use it against big groups, but I have to say it’s really fun to use.
---
Cranberry relish, lovers embrace and any perk cards to grant extra exp. Grind out super mutants and sentry bots at whitesprings
---
Oh sweet I have 1st didnt know you could do that thanks for telling me mate
---
I wish. i always jump between PC/Xbox and it would be great if games were games and didnt' matter which platform you played on.
---
Not only do your own crops count, but the homestead in the forest where Free Range is sometimes (can't remember the name). The cranberries and corn there easily cover at least 20.
---
I noticed I had a couple hundred more atoms out of nowhere over the last couple days. Thought I just completed some challenges that I wasnt tracking
---
There should be a team voting feature. A team with only 2 players, the leader can kick the other person. 3 players, it requires a 2/3 vote. 4 players, it requires a 2/4 vote
---
Just hit 49. I got hit with the autocomplete bug today for the first time, and lost 1500 points. Finished up all the weekly challenges except level up 3/3 tonight so I don't lose them. Still on pace, but hoping this bug doesn't show up anymore.
---
Yes it would be really nice if we didnt have to buy games twice on diff platforms. Would be cool if we could play what we buy on all platforms and play with others on other platforms. But sadly probably wont happen with xbox and ps due to their pettiness.
---
I had to log out and log back in for them to kick in.
---
Damn. Ive seen 1 rad barrel and it was for max caps. Good deal. The western you should know dropped way down in value. You can get them with the pleasent valley tickets pretty easily. That being said i still see them sitting in vendors for a couple thousand

TheNoTrons I work nights so I’m on late  and most of Friday. Which ones are you looking for?
---
Look it up on Google first, it can be messed if not done correctly. You have to be able to rejoin the same private world. If you don't, bye bye items.
---
They should’ve based the converter on the ammo crafter from Fallout 3: The Pit DLC. An input inventory, an output inventory, and a terminal where you choose the desired ammo and started the darn thing. It would do some quick math and convert the ammo into the desired ammo. Each ammo type would have “worth” and the system would round down and eliminate the remainder.
---
+karma
---
People, generally, are dum... not noobs, they are alts. I have eight, devving my ninth, and I don't need your stuff. Appreciated though.
---
This was people’s expectations before the dupe. Except it was more like give me everything in your inventory and your first born child for my god rolled legacy, fixer or whatever.
---
I don't even carry pa any longer. I may pull the old excavator out for luckey hole but pa has lost its usefulness after wastelanders.
---
Thank you sexy boy 💋
---
Aye. never seen so many things in one pile before though
---
I found one tar was camping at an unmarked site.   She was selling a bunch of the recipes for the various drugs like grape mentats.
---
Can u take like anything
---
Just keep going. Seriously it isnt hard to level up. I'm pretty casual and during double exp weekend without grinding I gained 74 levels and I'm now 174. If it wasnt double exp that's easily 37 levels in 4 days.its easier to level up with the higher level content than it is to start from scratch doing low level content
---
Exactly this. Every time I load up a server I get disconnected from server. I don’t know what Bethesda fucked up this time but I can bet it is the server stability.
---
Edit: more frequently after latest patch.
---
Better damage than a handmade with a effect that improves sneaking
---
Gotta get the plan from encrypted event then the purveyor has a chance of dropping legendary variants.
---
Should have done this first, validated the files on steam, had 1 missing! The game runs better and hasn’t crashed since :)
---
It's XP based, unless you want to blow Atoms, as you can advance a space for 150 Atoms(awarded along the season pass). So I would grab as much XP bonus foods, bobble heads, and lunch boxes(awarded along the season pass X3 at a time). Sleep on a good bed for bonus XP. Join events teams for 25% 50% 75% and 100% bonus XP for finishing events. Build teams offer bonus intelligence also for a small XP boost as well. Hope this helps!
---
Ok thanks
---
I have a bunch on PS4 if you need them
---
It really depends on how serious you are at completing the legendary run before the timers out. I take it you are home a few days gone a few days?
---
In that case you need to grind the repeatable to equal the amount of score you have permanently lost each day you're not playing, which is approximately 2k per day plus the weeklies, so approximately 3k score per day. Each 10k xp you get nets you 100 score. 
---
The legendary run is structured so you pretty much have to do every challenge to pass (get that 3k~ score per day), but this can be mitigated by gaining massive amounts of xp.
---
Oh yeah. I bought my initial rad barrel for 9500 caps. That’s why I was so surprised to see one so cheap. For the western, I figured why not, it cost more to fast travel to the player’s camp and I can always resell it.
---
Oh I just scrap fixers but see everyone wanting it, should have just sold them to people or gave them to new players. Just never thought stats were that good.
---
I had a couple hundred atoms show up before I got the email.
---
Pop lunchboxes in event groups and do events like uranium fever and radiation rumble. Take rests in bed and do whatever you can to increase your xp gains. By the end of today you should be at 48 to be on par with were you should be to get to 100 on time.
---
What a lonnng, strange trip it's been...
---
Hey man calm down with the request. It might mean they actually have to do stuff and work on the game...
---
I have done 300 levels as a gunslinger. These are my tips. 
---
1. Have a silenced 10mm and a Stalker's, Bloodied or Instigating Western revolver. Best secondary perk is 33vats or extra limb damage. With the right build, a silenced 10mm can kill everything except "bosses". 
---
2. Full agility, full perception, high luck. You will use VATS 90% of the time. 
---
3. You need the multipliers. Be stealthy. 
---
4. You won't be able to do what you do with a handmade or fixer. You can, however, keep the battlefield clean during events, oneshooting everything, headshot after headshot. Just tag the boss. 
---
5. You might need to run from some battles. You might want to carry explosives to soften the crowd a bit, unless you are instigating. In my case, I just carry two revolvers. If the enemy is tough and capable of surviving the first shot, I cripple the leg first. But, really, my headshots cause over 1500 damage. Use your critical: high luck means a critical every two shots. 
---
6. Mandatory perks: gunslinger (all of them), sneak or gun-fu. Concentrated fire, bloody mess, nerd rage if bloodied. 
---
7. Mutations: eagle eyes, speed demon, adrenal reaction if bloodied. Marsupial to reach higher grounds and rain grenades. My cowboy loves to Molotov them and shoot the burning ones as they run. 
---
8. Dress accordingly. Respect the revolver. Don't embarrass yourself wearing a Fasnacht mask and a dress. Don't put a scope on the revolver: you have the 10mm to be tactical. 
---
9. You only need 10mm and 44. Sell the rest. Use the caps to but more revolvers. All of them. Try them all and see which one speaks to you. In my case, it is an Instigating + Limb Damage +1 perception western revolver.
---
10. Have a beer.
---
The stars was what I wanted most and immediately put it on the main room of my camp, but since I just got planets too I replaced it for now.
---
I've actually had it randomly boot people from public teams when I was both the leader and in a friend's public team. Unsurprisingly it's kinda buggy.
---
I mean I have the beret, goblin, jester, and sun so I’m just looking for ones I don’t have
---
I didn’t think about your vulgar suggestion any further than to simply report it for violating this sub’s rules.  Because you and I both know it’s simply an attempt to be shocking, not a legitimate possibility.
---
As I said, I’m sure part of you is amused and thinks you’re being ever so edgy, but it’s simply sad to watch. I do hope you’re not doing this unironically. 
---
Somehow, though, I think that might be the case.  That you’re actually this cringey, and think you’re clever for being ‘so random’ and ‘not-like-the-other-Redditors’. 
---
I hope you find a better outlet to get the attention you need than this, OP. This has stopped being amusing and now, I’m feeling nothing more than pity for you.
---
Oh I see your issue. Only Beckett and Sophia give you major quest lines. The other ones like the wanderer and gramps only give you a daily quest.
---
I have a bloodied faster fire reduced weight gamma gun modded to max damage. Like, 450 ballistic 350 rads. It is insane.
---
Any update?
---
Sorry I’m on Xbox
---
I play on Xbox so sorry I can’t get them
---
Anything and everything to get xp. It’s the only catch up mech.
---
The Minigun doesnt heal allies.
---
Burnt camp, demolished camp, rubble camp, broken camp, evaporated camp....
---
I have yet to successfully complete that one. Went in with a bunch of people, and so many ghouls spawned they wrecked the NPCs in seconds. Would come out of nowhere, and you wouldn't know they were there until the health bar was tanking.
---
Someone must have been funneling them through that hall.
---
Reminds me of Silent Hill for some reason.
---
So someone gave you a fucking thumbs down emote and that makes them a griefer?
---
If an irradiated guy joins your team and some time later your CAMP gets nuked then that was me :)
---
I have a tower CAMP over at the acid/iron spot at the bottom of the savage divide.  While everyone else is grinding for rep, I would happily grind for a elevator.
---
Love love 8, leader bobble, cranberry relish/cobbler, building team x4, lunch boxes x4. 
---
I run cranberry bog, sunrise field(mirelurks/queen), fissure toward prime(1sb), then prime fissures(up to 4x Sb), cranberry glade for mirelurks/queen, drop site mirelurk queen, fissure by general steakhouse, huntersville, westek, satellite array(down the road), whitespring, repeat.
---
Doing events in between to break it up.
---
Thanks for the info. I submitted a ticket.
---
Back in my day we wore onions on our belt.
---
I have * Skull Mask
---
* Giant Mask
---
* Soldier Mask (I think)
---
* Owl Mask
---
* Witch Mask
---
* Tooth Man mask
---
* Winter Man Mask
---
* Crazy Guy Mask (I think)
---
* Raven Mask
---
Fixers are among the best weapon types, especially since Stealth commandos are so popular.
---
Nope, my handmade will kick your Fixer's butt. Seriousely, the Fixer works better with some aspects of stealth; it builds on synergy. However, a handmade will always have higher base damage than the Fixer. It's up to the user to make either work for them and thier playstyle.
---
Bethesda  just cutting the atom supply. And if you haven't noticed. They clearly stated that they give the players the first season for free. Meaning you'll have to pay for the next one ;p I'm sorry you're dissapointed. I feel for you.
---
Don’t forget Brain Fungus Soup for extra intelligence (xp). Even more so if running Herbivore.
---
I feel that.
---
Yes please.
---
Do you know how much you’re selling each for? I want to make sure I have enough caps
---
Stood outside vault76 yesterday giving survivor packs to noobs. 
---
X5 radaway
---
X5 stimpacks
---
Full deep pocketed lvl10 armour
---
X1 hatchet
---
And 3 random plans. 
---
Most thumbs up emojied me and 2 ran away whom I chased after doing present emoji. When they realised they weren't being attacked they came on mic to thank me. (I had finished all my score challenges and vendors are full so I figured why not try give new players a nice welcome)
---
Which was the style of the time. We didn't have white ones, because if the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...
---
Come here little one, I have candy.
---
Grahm misses meat week. He gets cranky when he's hungry.
---
I'm not going to apologize for having respect for other people. You want to do what you do, fine. I don't insult you for it. If that makes me a "beta" so be it.
---
Danny boy I got a nice set for you I have all the commons and uncommon wasnt able to get any rare so add me JrArevalo956  xbox wont be on tonight but I got about 6 to 8 masks i can pass you
---
Cool story bro.
---
We consider Ace the Mayor, and Raider punk his Jester like buffoon side kick.
---
Pics of camp or I'll come and give 3 thumbs down.
---
It’s unfortunate that something happened in your life to affect you negatively enough to where you think this is either amusing or civil behavior. 
---
I’m sorry for whatever happened to you, and whoever did this to you was not a good person.
---
Considering I missed the first week, 43 isn’t too shabby. Best unlock thus far is the plushie of course.
---
Does it come at a cost? If it does I can give caps (I don’t have much though) and I have a couple of power armor chassis
---
Fixer is doing more damage it's very slight but still more also I don't use them lol
---
Sell ammo
---
I have learned 24 mods so far. I have 2000 hours in.
---
that's been my thought exactly, it's easy enough to switch between both. I'm gonna try a sneaky vats bow thing, once i get a good one.. and whenever they fix vats lol
---
Tagging for info. I'm still under lvl 20 and theres so much I need money for. Still learning.
---
Unlikely, as I’m Deist, not Catholic.
---
I'm gonna have to try this ploy.
---
Where abouts exactly did you spawn in? As a level 287, I always love accidently picking up people's dropped junk.
---
I was in a team and the leader boot a kid that was clearly arguing with a sibling over a live mic. I've been kicked off for no reason too and I share lucky break.
---
84.  Getting tired.
---
I have had it work with a solo public team lol
---
I’m not attached to them nor am I trying to get thousands of caps for them. Make me an offer.
---
When you purchase stuff from the terminals he’s always smiling and god it’s freaky
---
Good on you for apologizing :)
---
Update: on Friday my suspension was denied because they claimed I “duped” but yet they’re still investigating me still. 
---
Any advice?
---
I didnt use my level ups for like q levels and switched from rifle to heavy pretty easy. Play what you are, save the level ups to do whats needed, then move and apply. Dont try changing from rifle or pistol to unarmed slowly, it will kill you bkth ways.
---
Supposedly, all of the responder bot items are in the pool of roaming/traveling vendor potentials, plus the new stuff, such as bows and crap. I ran across the longshoresman outfit today, next to Slocum Joes, from a traveling vendor.
---
ME TOO!!! Also, I would like it even more if the game just integrated far more building.
---
Remember when you could just toss shit in a pile in fo3 and it would stay there for ever. Miss that.had the biggest pile of Chinese assault rifles know to man
---
You're constantly having this issue with multiple games and across multiple systems?
---
What, when you finish playing for the night do you just yank the power cord from the wall?
---
Would you take 50 caps a mask? If you want to go higher I could also give power armor chassis
---
Yes. You get double benefits from your chosen source. This includes the food value as well as other factors like stat bonuses or XP bonuses.
---
Which would be more beneficial for a melee build?
---
50 sounds like a deal to me
---
There is a strobe light might put it in the vend door of the machine? I used the disco ball
---
Sure thing.
---
OMG !  that is word-for-word what i said about it
---
I just did this the other day, compared scrapping with/without the scrapper perk. 11 with, two/three without for a laser rifle.
---
You're free to think it's a ploy. I posted this knowing full well some people would. That's your prerogative. But the fact I feel terrible about doing that is real.  
---
The game spawned everyone's "Death bags" In a small area just a few feet from where we all spawned. Some 7 or 8 people were all scrambling looking for their bags in a small space, hoping no one made this very mistake. I just happened to be the one to look like an asshole this time.
---
Alright. If you can’t sell today, just tell me a day you can sell
---
With the recent buff to them, i would say yes. even not having to cook is nice
---
Probably Carnivore. IIRC, most of the best Str/Melee bonuses are from meat products.
---
meaty meat meat
---
[Need to reconnect everything to the main structure or back to the ground and then deconstruct it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hrij6z/help_i_just_have_spent_hours_on_my_camp_and_i/fy4cpuj/) 
---
If its a big mess with pieces floating everywhere you might just need to move but typically you can save it.
---
Assuming you mean besides player vendors, it depends on how you play and how long you play for. If you are trying to cap out multiple characters a day it’s best to get it out of the way ASAP by either doing an event like Uranium Fever and selling everything, or spam crafting an item that sells for a decent amount. 
---
If you only play one character a day you can take your time and only pick up things that are valuable and also light, like chems if you have the chemist backpack or heavy weapons if you have bear arms. By the end of your session you should have found enough stuff to cap out. This is how I have been playing this season since I am using my high intelligence character for the extra XP. I prefer this style because you just play normally and spend less time focusing on selling.
---
I’m at work for about five more hours. If that’s too late we can do it Friday
---
Carnivore from what I been told by other Meele players.
---
No... I don't. I've gone to the length of rebuilding my PS4's database every time there's a major update. There's my point, I've gone to extraordinary lengths just to *make sure* I nip this in the bud, on a totally new console, yet it persists.
---
aw shit it isn't? :(
---
Looks like the pile I drop at line in the sand. Guys setup tents to make the scorch drop over the sonic thing. You end up with so many axes, hammers, lead pipes, hatchets. I usually spam to collect it all after then drop those. Everything spawns after awhile, you can go to fissure prime and pickup a lot of good stuff laying on the ground too
---
Thanks for the advice! I need to adjust my perk points a bit but I’m already maxed in agility and nearly maxed in luck. My best pistols right now are Q E 250dwr Western revolver, AA E 15vats .44, and J ffr 10mm. Looking to trade right now for an instigating. One question though, would you recommend getting rid of twisted muscles mutation (lvl 3 class freak) for increased vats accuracy?
---
My fancy revolver is off and on in the display ad fart as the correct skin being shown. I would say 50/50
---
Nothing ever comes up for hunting rifles either, it seems
---
Honestly I can do anytime, but I feel like at 2 am is a bad time, not because of me, but because work for a long time and not getting rest is a combination you don’t want to be creating
---
There's a strong chance that your HDD isn't doing it's job properly so it's probably time to upgrade to an SSD.
---
Also often these 'lucky' servers happen when a server is at the tail end of its life so it could be related to lag and or server strain.
---
Whenever is good
---
I often get the 34878 error but I’ve never needed to reinstall the game or turn off the system. Usually the error comes up randomly on any game then it comes up with the usual report issue page so I do that then click done and re-launch the game. I did talk to PlayStation/Sony about it because when I used to play The Crew it used to get 34878 every 30 minutes they said it was a generic code that meant an error occurred with the game, software or app. They never mentioned corrupt data to me but did say it was completely random and sometimes is just there to say hey this game crashed.
---
*Edited to fix my appalling grammar, it’s 4am here is my excuse lol
---
Had a cool base for a while here then got reaalllllly bored of spawning in to shooting all the time. The upstairs bedroom really annoyed me that I couldn't build a lot in it with the crappy pre made bed there.
---
If they ever lift my suspension you can have the TS Gauss that's spent the last month gathering dust in my vendor 😂
---
Alright, Friday is good then. Do you want to use discord to chat or do you use anything else?
---
Legendary fixers, no one cares about normal ones.
---
Make each daily give like 10 atoms again if you hit rank 100. That way if you buy the whole season like the other guy said it still wouldn't be better then just grinding it.
---
get steel and lead and make it
---
Use this to find both
---

---
Just my headset
---
Plant tatos and lots of water purifiers. With green thumb each tato yields 2, and with hard bargain each sells for 2. 1 tato = 4 caps. Big enough farm and multiple water stations and you will be swimming in caps....
---
Alright so Xbox chat?
---
I make my own by grabbing the tin cans at top of the world and server hopping. 6 can traps easy grabbing lol.
---
Yeah those I turn into scrip because I see no use for those
---
Yeah that should work
---
I feel attacked
---
Yeah they throttle at 85-90 but you don't want to go there. I can say, it's heat that causes that problem. Least in my experience. Remember on one card, I had to sink mosfets on the back side because of bad design.
---
What I do is fast travel to Eastern Regional Penitentiary and collect the cans in the area its about 80+ lead and twice the amount of steel just server hopping between public and my private servers got me hundreds of lead and steel which is all you need for Gauss ammo
---
TODDS COMING
---
It will if your build/synergies work. However, anyone can make an equal handmade do more damage. Base damage on a handmade is higher; thus, a handmade can always do more damage than a Fixer. Just hit 4285 hours this morning, eight toons, four rifle-type builds, all above L200. Not boasting, just fact.
---
100%, I'm sad to hear it doesn't work on the Fixer.
---
Bethesda, come on. Why you hatin' on the Fixer?
---
Yeah, I've been the one telling people this kind of thing... Across three consoles.
---
yes
---
Alright I’ll add you whenever I have the chance. My gamer tag is DestroyerDanMan btw
---
Tbh I don't understand why all previous pre war guns that have been in past games can't be integrated. It's a bit of a crappy move and lazy. Fallout 4 and New Vegas were so heavily modded in weapons and armour department yet Bethesda seems very lackluster and vanilla when deciding what to put in the game 😭
---
People will pay good money for even mediocre rolls.
---
Certainly get where you’re coming from.  If any of the past dupes had a hard come-down, like the post Wastelanders vendor dupe (which wrecked the stackable item economy, that still hasn’t recovered) I’d not be concerned about this latest ban wave.  Instead, dupe bug after dupe bug people see come and go, nothing much happens, and it makes the next one that easier to join in.  Hell I’ve seen it happen among friends and acquaintances in the game.  I didn’t snag a bag full of legacies, but I sure could have.  It’s kinda like a highway with an unenforced speed limit, eventually next to nobody is doing the speed limit.  It’s not just the players fault in that scenario.
---
I guess it’s like the severity of this wave is like Bethesda took things up a few notches on ToS enforcement, but have not taken a single other thing up a notch (addressing bugs, customer service, communication) in the same way.  It’s like they want to act like old Blizzard now, when they only thing they rival blizzard at is the world building (the landscape and the like I mean), everything else they are sub par to pretty much all of their AAA peers.
---
I have not been suspended or banned, but I feel for those that have.  It sounds like a pathetically inept process for being investigated, by a company that time and again has said they lack tools to do CS work.
---
Thanks man, I'll try it now.
---
Will def trade them now that I see a bunch of posts on the marlet wanting them.
---
Player vendor
---
My man, this is a post apocalyptic game. They already nerfed and killed off PvP, now you want even more of a carebear safe space? Jesus dude you’ll live, encountering a trap camp isn’t the end of the world
---
I have a skin on my alien blaster that says otherwise
---
as i first reached the Overseer's camp for the first time, a random player ran up and dropped a shotgun at my feet.  i leapt into the air and ran into the bar to celebrate.   since then I've presented dozens of weapons (pistols, rifles, machetes ...) and even a couple of armor frames at, or near, Vault 76
---
it changed the way i looked at the game
---
Might be the settler wanderer ally?
---
I did the dumb math, it would cost someone $150 to go from 1-100 in the Season but if given back the daily 10 atoms per 7 challenges, we would only make 7000 atoms, meaning we would only make back 50% of what we paid in a sense. Dumb math again. So its better to grind for free and get a small profit in the end that spend it all at once and make back half of the make believe money. Bethesda still wins if they reward us Atoms.
---
What is with your name?
---
I sell mothman egg omelets along with whatever chems and excess junk I have on hand sine the day before to make daily caps with vendors..
---
I'm at level 19....I'm done for, aren't I? Truth be told I just want the astronaut PA skin at level 80.
---
Better off making it prime, way better turn in 108 to 21, if you have the Flux.
---
Sell Purified Water some players have loads of Water Resource extractors in the CAMP just to do this
---
Sell certain high value cooked meat (Glowing Meat, Wolf Meat etc)
---
Sell all the Weapons you find
---
Sell some of the less useful chems you find (Do you really need to hold on to so many Rad X/Radaway/Stimpaks?)
---
Sell all the Armor Pieces that you find
---
Sell all of the Junk Food/Liquor that you find unless you have a use for them
---
You can only get 1,500 Caps from vendors per day so reaching that cap each day isn't hard once you have it down to a routine.
---
Don't forget to equip the Hard Bargain Lv.3 Perk before you sell your stuff.
---
Use the 10mm bloodied 3* silenced. I started using it to save up my 308. Bullets for bloodied lmg but I'm addicted. I unlocked the Halloween skin for it too on nuclear winter which was a nice bonus. Vats sneak attacks and ap recovery are amazing on pistols if you choose right perks
---
This is fine
---
Or put on excavator and go through lucky hole mine. I usually get about 1600 lead per run.
---
Where do you purchase the levels?
---
I totally agree. Thank you for being just kind as well.
---
For floating walls change them to doors.  Floating stairs you need to anchor with a foundation.  Easiest way is to just move or reset you camp placement just slightly and it will clear out everything.
---
I share that one too.
---
So far so good!
---
Got a ts fixer today from the ally quest. I haven't seen it drop in the wild. The other way is the purveyor but you have to have learned the plan (drops from encrypted).
---
I opened a closet in my house today and saw duck tape.  It doesn’t seem that rare in fo76 but in fallout 4 it was crazy so my mind just went, “Aw HELL yeah!”  Before I realized
---
Nah your good.just taking up space man
---
I just do the farm run down south in the mineing area
---
Carnivor at +10 (glowing meat steak), +15 (yogi roast), +15 (mutton stew?), +15 (??? forgetting or went to far) melee damage, and deathclaw wellington for +3 strength...and they all stack!
---
This whole seasons thing was a big winning move for them. Ive never bought an atom and used to get everything I wanted for free, now they have people buying atoms to finish season and they are giving away way less atoms then they used to when they came from dailies and weeklies. Its a super stingy practice that they used as a big public relations move... hey look free content, free seasons, free things to grind for.. when all they really wanted was to sell atom bundles. I love them and the games they make but they really are huge money mongers.
---
Alright thanks. I’ll add you when I get the chance. Also my gamertag is DestroyerDanMan. Also do you have a means of communication you want to use?
---
You were playing in ez mode now your playing in hard mode
---
Its a bit of rng, it definitely comes from the free states vendors. Might take some dedicated hopping. 
---
If youre on pc I have one you can have.
---
Fixer has around 20% more damage than the handmade last I checked. The receivers are different though for semi.
---
Ss armor will take you thousands of scrip to get right but it’s unparalleled
---
Craft serums with super duper and sell 2-3 per day to the vendor.  I normally do 2 for 500 each and then dump any extra chems and stuff I pick up at the end of my session.
---
I have recommended that they let us have out allies even temporary ones follow us.
---
We do have public teams but alot of the revive charisma perks are going unused and the share mechanic could buff our allies, they should also let use share multiple perks.
---
Random spawn at the Harper's Ferry / Free States vendor.
---
I have a mic all add you to. Happy to help.many folks payes it foward w me.my first godroll was a tse handmade that a random high level gifted me.that got m3 through about 100 levels
---
Are you on PS4? I believe I have 2 spare cooking stove plans. I can double check tomorrow :)
---
I am at the point where i am struggling to spend the caps i make. 
---
But this is an easy way to make caps, level up and get aid. 
---
* Go to Pioneer Scout camp which is west of Grafton Steel
---
* Talk to Scout Leader Jaggy
---
* Pick up The Order of the Tadpole quest
---
* Go to Sunnytop Ski Lanes which is west of Pumpkin House
---
* Behind it you will find the start of the Athletics course. 
---
* Start the course. Wait a few seconds before going through the first flags. You'll hear a bing. 
---
* Follow the course. Take your time. Set off and disable all the traps. Once you finish you'll get caps, loot and xp. Simply fast travel back to the top or run up. And start again. All the traps should remain disabled for a long time. Takes a minute if that.
---
But the only thing worth while is the last 5 things and dark matter skin for combat rifle the rest is filler. All the good stuff is in the Atom Shop. Big Game Hunter bundle for example is awesome! I bought it.
---
Every now and then I take my headset off and check to hear if it is in fact raining....
---
yeah - i always tell them "i built this for you.  it's maxed out" so they don't think it's something i picked up on the side of the road
---
There's an absolute ton of them. 
---
I'd highly suggest checking out Decoy's Dungeon on YouTube. 
---
He's got dozens of videos in his "Cool and unique camp locations" that often feature pre existing structures.  Each video shows off one location from each region of the map, and sometimes he does specific stuff like best pre existing structure spots, double resource spots etc.
---
Fixer has more per shot dmg than a hm. Like 2% more. That said, the handmade has a much better fire rate and I’m firmly on team handmade rifle.
---
All right. Do you have a time you can be on?
---
Kill players
---
I’m on Xbox or I’d definitely take you up on that. I’ll hop around and see if I can strike gold. Thank you!
---
I tried to couldn't see it. Thought it was me. But will let you off everyone make mistakes, and you owned yours.
---
Isn't that just the Pipe Gun?
---
I'm on Xbox, ty though!
---
Here you go non legendaries standard mods no perks
---
https://youtu.be/zLe4_Dgj-yw
---
I’m simply being polite.
---
Just because you’re trying to be confrontational doesn’t mean I am.
---
Would it make you feel better if you got the last word?
---
There is Ss ghilly on the board
---
Nah, the extra daily challenges, double SCORE weekend, and whatever other bonuses they will undoubtedly add should get you there. But you'll need to play daily.
---
You have to convert it all at the chemistry bench with acid? Or can you use lead straight away?
---
I’m on Xbox but great psn
---
Seriously. Don't leave your camp unlocked and your girlfriend in her underwear if you don't want any drunk idiot looking ha ha ha
---
They’ll be purchasable with atoms so either on the game board page or the atomic shop. I don’t think Bethesda have added it yet though :)
---
*checks flair*
---
hmmmmmm...
---
Spend $1 for 30k caps
---
Thanks!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Street_lights
---
If you have a floating roof, hang a door then remove any other walls hanging from it, then roof, then the door.  If yo can’t anchor the stairs directly, attach the non foundation floors to the top and hang a ladder of another edge and anchor that other one.  Then remove staring with the original ladder working backwards.
---
All my headshots start at 95 chance. You should test that. You certainly don't need that mutation in a gunslinger.
---
I would suggest looking up the Fallout 3 &amp; Fallout 4 &amp; New Vegas OSTs instead, Fallout 76’s is just those but more limited in its selection imo
---
I miss the perks now too but this stealth armour makes me really concentrate on not dying
---
You actually will get free leveling atoms
---
don't be greedy. 3 is better than 0.  If you want a handout, then ask, but don't complain about people buying items from your machine. There is no entitlement.
---
It really does, it's just been shut down by America time and time again.
---
Oh, interesting. How so?
---
I rarely take hits but have stood toe to toe with a standard Scorchbeast and downed them. Is the Stealth Suit that much more fragile?
---
I remember that sometimes the buttons and the cabin would get hopelessly desynced to where the buttons would be on one floor and the cab on another and when you pressed a button both the buttons and the cab would start moving, at which point you basically had to replace the elevator.
---
Combine that with 76's "Cannot place object" shenanigans, and you'd have pitchforks in the streets.
---
I had a pile of 96 teddy bears in Fallout 4 until the settlers got greedy and left me with 12. I had to put them in a filing cabinet after that lol
---
Sorry, do you mean Secret Service or Stealth Suit? And it can be upgraded?
---
Well that's disappointing. I was hoping it was a robot that sold you items.
---
Yup, Fixers use the combat rifle pool of mods, an inferior damage producing gun to the handmade. I love Fixers and use them as a primary gun in certain situations and with specific toons. Nonetheless, they do less damage than an equivalent handmade with all else, perks, buffs, and such, being equal. Just saying...
---
Sell your known plans, I have make 6k (8k - 2k from legendary run) in caps this week
---
I feel ZAX is just a little underwhelming. Maybe it’s the voice acting but it sounds like you gave a 16 year old a microphone and said “you’re playing a murderous robot. Think Glados but more passive aggressive” 
---
MODUS is a lot better in my opinion. He sounds very creepy but like he’s trying to help you. He constantly sounds like he’s trying to find a word that would make you feel more comfortable with what he’s actually saying. 
---
ZAX just feels passive aggressive while MODUS seems unsettlingly genuine
---
Secret service and yes there are several mods
---
The vast majority of the playerbase doesn't read these posts, so even if everyone here did it, it likely wouldn't change anything.
---
Not gonna like I totally commented on the wrong post lol. But the teddies in fo3 shot out of the rock it launcher were devastating lmao
---
Before I finished reading your post I was already thinking "Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand". Either one of those, especially UF, and I can sell out the 1400 caps for the day. Between the weapons, glowing blood, glowing meat, and unscrapped junk, it's easy. Top that off with purified water I collect from the 1 industrial purifier I have left at my camp, and 1400 power day is way too max out. I cook and sell almost all the meat I collect too. 
---
I rarely ever sell things at my vending machine anymore. Selling ammo, legendaries, and chems works. Bobble Heads sell well for people's displays. Camp plans sometimes sell well - but I list them for next to nothing, like 10-20 caps.
---
The helmet is pretty slick with my all heavy combat armor
---
It’s not the health bonus that is important, but the auto-health regeneration. So long as you are moving, you are nearly immortal. Look up Angry Turtle’s video on YouTube about the auto health regeneration.
---
I’m not saying that DR above ~350 is useless - it’s something - it’s just less effective at reducing damage, and you can better invest elsewhere.
---
Ok I'm genuinely confused now. I can build a roasting spit, an open fire pit, the cinder block sit down fire cooker, and a black crusty looking antique stove. Those are under crafting. I can also build a modern looking stove and another black antique belly cooker, but those aren't useable, just decorations. What I want is a modern stove that's useable.  Is that in game or not?
---
And join a public building team, put on level 3 inspirational, use leader or intelligence bobbles if you have them.
---
I'm same made a load during fashnact and they just keep going up and up, I'm grinding for rare outfits so hit every single event I can.
---
The limit needs to be removed or vastly improved.
---
I have the ability to purchase a captain cosmos rank up.?
---
It will be around 8pm or so tx time
---
my guess is that they aren't sure what's going on, and don't realize until after I'm gone that it was a good thing
---
Quests are a lot of fun in this game as they take you pretty far around the map. But thats also whats getting to me xD just take time to explore a bit and visit good scavenging sites. That way when you do get back to quests and exploring, you'll have a nice supply to fall back on. There are SO many places to just poke around, its great
---
Today?
---
I made this one mainly to play at conventions inside the pip-boy I think it is incomplete because I’m sure I left off some I wasn’t all that bothered about. 
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5z4er8HRpdSwe4IHC4fqyu?si=hllt1KZoRee0dhzMTRd58A
---
No. The closest is the red stove that is an atom shop purchase that is basically a clean version of the broken grey one.
---
thx:)
---
Yes, I got it too. Thought it may be about challenges like the SBQ not counting towards the kill tough enemies challenge.
---
Just checking to see how your build is going
---
So I’ve messed around with a gatling laser a bit lately. Lots of queen fights and such. I’ve come across some interesting findings. In first person with 2 in power user you have 800 rounds in the core. When I fired all 800 I was seeing an extra 200ish ammo left but it wanted to reload anyway. I’ve noticed while in 3rd person after 800 rounds it shows the 200ish left but doesn’t want to reload right away and shooting again burns the run off ammo... to a point. There are 3rd run offs. The 3rd run off, after the 800 and after the 200 is around 40ish. This time however if shot your laser will either shoot a handful of time and the rest drains and it’s time to reload (for real) or it with spin and drain the 40 immediately and it’s time to reload.  
---
I also noticed similar with my Tesla rifle. I shoot my 15 rounds but when it goes to reload it shows ammo still “loaded” if you melee when it tries to reload you will cancel the reload and have that amount to still shoot. Not magic appearing ammo but it might save time instead of reloading(never timed it). Ammo and reloading is wonky. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
---
His face reminds me of the scientist who owned the head crab in one of the half life games.
---
Lol, slowly. Made some of the changes, just right now rearranging my points
---
I think that rewards for completing the dailies/weeklies after you finish the run should be a choice of some form of currency like gold bullion or scrip. Would be a nice touch.
---
My mutant’s fixer with marsupial serum, sneak+covert ops maxed, and escape artist is sicker than all cumulative human death.  Wanna add speed demon to my mix when i find some.
---
Start a new character, unarmed was my third build and quickly became my main.
---
Dang eh. Well thanks for explaining instead of being a dick like the down voters and one word response.
---
Haha I did think it was a bit random 🙈
---
lol.  i sold and stopped picking up screws for a long time.  began to think it was a joke : "you've got a loose screw".  finally i needed them for repairs ... by the dozen.  ouch !
---
Best way to check if you are losing your mind playing this game is to walk through a room with a desk fan or globe on a table- if you instinctively pick it up, you need to take a break.
---
I have my nuka girl outfit, I could go there onstage and do the mothman dance lol
---
You had all these Armour buffs and stuff helping you out, now you don't have those with the stealth suit. Hard mode.
---
Apperently I learned, or unlearned, something today. Interesting part of this is that I did the same thing when Beth introduced the Fixer and the base damage between the two was about the same, except it was reversed and higher on the handmade. Appreciated.
---
Make sure Scrapper perk is on? I dont seem to be having this issue.
---
If they can do it so the character hand isn't a foot from the texture
---
Yeah wait until its over
---
Camp interiors are on the roadmap
---
I'll check it out yeah
---
Now it would be nice if they can fix my first sub issue. My year sub renewed and I've my game isn't recognizing my sub. So I paid for something I can't even use! (Steam). Customer service on steam and Beth has been iffy.
---
Knuckles?  I guess your in the same boat as me no one ever keep knuckles legendaries so you cant find any?
---
They fixed the buttflap issue a couple patches ago
---
Same has been happening to me. :(
---
I once had a nukashine and ended up at a mad hatters tea party. It was quite the experience lol
---
You fucked with squirrels Morty!
---
Rule 10
---
submitted a ticket to bethesda about it awhile back it only lets me buy bullion once every 3rd week.. they replied "we know theres an issue, they are working on it"
---
My question is how many current players actually know who Iguana Bob is?
---
That suit is the best if you're a sneak build. Sneak 3, escape artist and a Fixer. Add in whatever other skills you want. I can be mobbed by enemies and duck down into stealth mode and instantly go into caution then to hidden right in front of the enemies. May not be able to equip armor over it but if the enemy can't find you chances are you won't be taking damage.
---
I'm in the 50s now - 51 or 52 I think - and my favourite unlock is still the sheepsquatch plushie. I have one sitting in the room I made for the Raider Punk with the mothman bed and wallpapers and a small mothman effigy (blessed be our Saviour.) 
---
If I can get to the Jangles backpack I'll be happy. Anything else after that will be a bonus for me.
---
Rise and Shine, vault dweller, rise and shine.....
---
Are you mental?
---
I notice fast travel in power armor cost fusion core power.
---
I drained from 30 to 26 in a high fast travel time gameplay within 30 mins.
---
If you're going to buy levels wait as long as you can. Cuz the later levels require more xp, but cost the same atoms to rank.
---
Dont forget the weight room in the fire house for lead.
---
The damage while higher is very slight that it doesn't even matter. Like I have used them both before and in the end I only noticed a change in the sneaking part with the fixer but otherwise it's not really that much of a difference. If it wasn't for the sneak bonus id have used the handmade more than the fixer cause the handmade has better skins. Heck even now I'm debating about using a handmade as a secondary. In the end though it's personal preferences and what not. My first post on this whole thing was the thing I heard most people say when ever I asked what they preferred and why
---
Ya cool, same as me then. They take up too much space haha
---
Wow another amazing idea that is never going to be put on the game but still I do really like this idea. It also gives you a reason to actually put 15 points in charisma too
---
Wtf that mean
---
You need acid, but you then get exp for the mine, and exp for smelting. It's also probably the fastest way to amass lead, the tax you pay for speed is acid.
---
As I said earlier; *You’re under the faulty impression that the opinion of an anonymous Redditor has any relevance to me.*
---
You’re the one that indicated that not getting the last word could be an issue. It’s irrelevant to me, but it certainly seems to matter to you.
---
If that’s the case, then by all means, have the last word. If that simple gesture would benefit your mental state or self-esteem, I see no harm in it.
---
This hit me wrong, I just shot a squirrel in game.....and took a picture of it.
---
Squirrel on a stick raises AGI by 3. These “ on a stick” food have some hidden value.
---
Ah ok, makes sense. No need to waste the money till the end.
---
I use the Stealth Suit, combined with a Fixer. Those two together and a few mutations/perks, and you would have to try to be seen. It offers enough protection if things go sideways. I have no issues with with a vast majority of things. I enjoy watching enemies run around looking for me, even the Sheepsquches and such.
---
You can get the backpack with one creature alive if you do the Project Q side quest. It's a pain because it makes the friendly hostile to other mobs which can get it killed easier but it will always give you the backpack if you don't have it.
---
Bloodied melee here. Go with the meats. Stack up all the melee boosts you can and then punch the scorchbeast queen for 1600 damage.
---
I've told people they can weapons them for caps if they don't want them.  wouldn't bother me if someone dumped them in a river, to be honest
---
the game loads me down with high level weapons i can barely lug to a place where i can scrap them (just started playing a new character).  it is surprising you haven't had that happen.  today i got a FatMan, Tesla, and others for level 50.  my character just hit level 20 !
---
Craft Marine Tactical Helmets and sell them to the vendor. Grape Mentats, Hard Bargain 3 and 4 Charisma gets them to 31 caps which is great for something that takes 1 Steel, 1 Glass, and 3 Rubber to make.
---
Just make sure to look at the rules there are more strict rules
---
Toit!
---
Try using a vats/pistol (wester revolver) toon; it's f'n awesome. Reached ally with both factions...parked until Beth figures it out.
---
Yeah you could either have a nice npc follower that needs frequent maintenance or even food if they can implement it.(maybe even mutations)
---
Or you are a beast master with a friendly deathclaw
---
Or even a trader/looter with a friendly brahmin following you around.
---
Not many I would say. It's sad to think that we are probably the Old Guard.
---
This subreddit has rules in the sidebar, well most do.
---
This sub isn't for trading. Try one of the market subs before your post is removed
---
Rewarding those who did the grind or bought their way to 100 would disenfranchise players who don't have time/money to do either. It would be a lose/lose and this place will be filled with complaints either way.
---
No trading here, sorry mate.
---
Thankyou for this
---
Are you new to the game? Public events spawn enemies in. Riding shotgun isn't an exception. Clearing the place out ahead of time wouldn't help this or any event in the game
---
No it doesn’t have to be same system.. I also suggested converting the dailies and weeklies into XP for adventure mode instead of atoms
---
You have to have floor on both sides of where you want the double wall. You can delete the outside floor after. Also there are certain situations where it wont work on a second floor because of the wall underneath it. But once you get used to doing it you'll be able to make much more interesting camps, albeit with much less camp budget.
---
Lucky Hole Mine with the excavator PA and West Tek run with Scrapper perk. Then add in super duper and ammo smith. You can roughly make 1-2k worth for with that one run (unless you're using the minigun, in that case: get a prime receiver)
---
Oh shit deleto posto
---
Hey I was in a team with you tonight
---
It’s a game, enemies spawn randomly all the time. They actually blow through the walls during that event for some of the spawns.
---
I have been using this suit since I got it about 100 levels ago and won’t go back to regular armor.  I miss not being able to use some of the cool outfits, but give and take...  I never wear power armor and take on SBQ quests every time they pop up.  I only die once in a while and usually don’t take much damage.  It’s fun to walk up to enemies and not be seen.
---
(Best MODUS voice) Hmm.  That IS rather...unfortunate.  We had very high hopes considering that you had survived the wasteland for this long.  It appears that We shall need to lower our expectations on your continued cooperative experience.  Perhaps you will find the proper...motivation to enhance Our relationship...  but perhaps not.  It would be disappointing should some incident occur that removed your usefulness as a resource, but regardless, We... shall continue.
---
This is exactly what I do too.
---
I always find them on Grahm, when I run into him.
---
I'm a heavy weapons build literally the only dark matter thing coming my way that I can use will be the glatning gun one
---
small spiral staircase large spiral staircase end reply
---
Kleiner? I’d equate him more with Gman, but ok.
---
I usually try and get a lot of detail by pushing the focus point right in to where I want the photo (so characters faces, mobs etc) rather than moving the camera closer (sometimes I do both) and then messing about with distance and range so the background is out of focus. Sometimes it’s just getting used to the photomode mechanics. Remember beauty is in the eye of the beholder, some of the shots I thought were bad are actually my most popular on IG.
---
What platform?  I can keep an eye out...
---
this has been a tough week for me.  started playing a new character (enjoy starting out and won't make the mistakes i made before)  and have gotten more grief than i ever have in any game before (to be fair, I'm not a big on-line gamer)
---
edit : spelling error
---
never had a problem with the first character, even had some good experiences, but this week ?  glad it wasn't like this my first time around !

Thanks for the info I just went to the junkyard and placed a mineral extractor, and that is working great
---
I've never gotten loot from the squatch. Always dead in seconds.
---
The clock plans too?
---
Oh forgot about that place and no problem.
---
They should just add a player vs player public team type. Then if two PvP teams come across each other, it's open season.
---
I have found a few good places to find weights to scrap: right inside each silo, VTU in the vault, the hotel outside Flatwoods and the Fire Station as mentioned. There is a good amount in one of the estates in the Ash Heap, but I’ve found it to be a pain.
---
My usual income consists of selling off purified water, chem and aid items I don't need (thanks chemist backpack mod), glowing meat steak, grenades and doing Manhunt whenever it pops up at Grafton Dam (120 caps per event, plus a good amount of steel from taking all the super mutants' weapons and scrapping them). With hard bargain, I easily hit the daily vendor limit and then doing Manhunt a few times usually covers fast travel and then some.
---
Were the messages like "How dare you try to have fun in this game!!! You must play it this way!!"?
---
Any other garentees with it? Like what if you used Q when you had 3 animals
---
I was hoping this meant you’d be live streaming the launches! Still awesome work guys!
---
Fair nuff. Cheers, mate.
---
Same. B FFR. It melts.
---
They are meant to be adding interiors at the end of the year.
---
PS4
---
Even on a loss it's not too bad, and enough people pop in it is not hard to at least get the 1/4 reward, otherwise so many dead ghouls.
---
*sees oxhorn video* 
---
sad to think that we are the old guard 
---
*tips fedora*
---
the real wasteland MVPs right here.
---
I started a new toon with the legendary run and I'm making him to be proficient... with the worst weapons families of the game. So he is an archer, a 1 handed melee fighter and a gunslinger. Why? I don't really know...  
---
  
---
The biggest problem is having my main toon fabricate the bows and crossbows at newer levels for the new toon and trying to pass them form one to the other. Also, I'm buying legendary bows and crossbows with my main for the moment the new one gets to 50.
---
get fallout 1st
---
oh my god YES !  this has been a terrible constant for me in Fo games.  turning on your light, for example, could make a faint flow around the dead body !
---
Just hit 85 after finishing the daily's and all but lev 3 times weekly
---
What console are you on?
---
The Formula P and backpack are the only plans you can get with one alive. With 2 alive you have a very low chance to get the bear arm and mod plans and the stimpack diffuser. With 3 alive it's something like 40% chance to get one of the good rewards. The project q side quest is only useful for getting the backpack and makes it harder to complete otherwise. You can get a lab coat and a non legendary bear arm from just completing the event but those are junk.
---
Yes please. Greatly increased build area, unlimited resources.
---
I just craft 3 serums with the flux i don't need for ammo and then I'm done.
---
Could be another player or just some of the noises in the games music
---
That is also a wonderful idea
---
New?
---
If you're a collector there's also three weird plans that show up as misc items upstairs in Arktos that can be used to craft items in the event area workbenches that do absolutely nothing.
---
Awww, I'm on PC.
---
every day, my friend.  literally every day
---
Make sure your intelligence is high and you have the scrapper perk equipped
---
I’ve got 5000 acid from fallout 1st so not too bad then haha
---
Very nice build and photo set
---
I'm on PC
---
If you are gonna troll people expect to get flamed.
---
take a break. if you've completed base game and wastelanders then all you have is repeatables. i just finished the run... so i'll be taking a long break myself.
---
Yup, I like it, so many experiences, loots, and radiation 🤣🤣🤣,
---
If you’re not enjoying the game, then why don’t you find another game? Maybe it’s just burnout or you don’t find it fun anymore?
---
Brahmin dogs radstag, the bovine creatures including the dreaded goat man 
---
Insect hotdogs are no go though
---
Cannibal is completely useless for power armor users unless they changed it. Don't worry, I'll just leave and not waste my time with a message.
---
Mkay thanks
---
Step-Claw? What are you doing?
---
Same as it did at release
---
Awesome. That will be my next focus. 
---
Thanks. =)
---
Jeez it really hasn't gotten better at all? That's super disheartening to hear.
---
Yes!!!!
---
The one that gives perk packs? Haven't you received any perk packs since then?
---
The only time that I've been booted from a team was when the leader wanted his friend to join. He apologized with a dm so it was fine, I just joined a different team.
---
Hmmm thats useful tho, thanks dude
---
Riding shotgun usually only spawns in a small number of mobs if you are doing it solo (3 at the first encounter for example). I wonder if it bugged out and thats why you got smacked by a heap of them. Either way, its an event, so as stated by others in here, pre-clearing won't help any, those blood eagles spawn in specifically to attack the caravan.
---
I mean they've got hillfolk hotdogs that would be a flawless place to put a vendor selling different hotdogs and recipes. Like damn. Give Grahm a sibling or something.
---
You can always file a ticket and they'll give you atoms for these challenges. Worked fine in my case.
---
Apparantly the feature was removed with the Wastelanders update. Not sure why, something to do with the new quests I guess. As far as sharing experience goes, you should still receive some xp and caps for a teammate completing a quest and as long as you all tag enemies, you will still receive XP for the kill.
---
They are trolling you. Game is much more stable now. Leaps and bounds.
---
I thought about having them printed but you'd need to do 100 of each sadly.
---
I have similar specs for my hardware, Intel i7 8700, 16GB of RAM, GTX 1060 6GB. After messing with the graphical settings a little bit, most things set to high, shadows and grass set to medium and actor/object fade turned down a little bit I get consistent 50fps at 1440p, no matter what is happening on screen. It's not great but it's playable. It still crashes the odd time but I don't think that has anything to do with my hardware or settings. I have the steam version btw.
---
Ok
---
Huh okay. I'll take the trolling with a grain of salt.
---
I feel sorry for anyone who believes their worth is derived from acting out a fictional "alpha male" ideal from a hierarchy system we cognitively evolved past at least 50,000 years ago. 
---
That being said I think people would understand the mistake, last time I was at a SBQ event there was a real mix up of bags - I think at one point I accidentally took some junk from one bag, realised and tried to return it the wrong one. My bag was gone by the end and that's fine it's all junk in a game - at the very least you probably made someone else's night if they found the bag at the scarecrow first
---
Good to know!  I have a lot but didn't even consider trying it, given how the task was worded.
---
Wow okay! Thanks so much for your input I really do appreciate it!
---
You sure you get XP when a teammate finishes a quest?
---
I know you get caps.
---
that really is a godsend.  before the new teams i restarted a powerplant solo, then spammed invites for points.  got two friend requests, but everyone declined to join.  with time running out i turned to the console to restart the plant and ... had to restart my PS4 instead
---
bummer
---
Holy shit. If I had the game I would love to work there lol.
---
I’ll be keeping my eye on you.
---
Blackbird, camo, gift wrap just to name a few.
---
I still think the entire game is a simulation within ‘76 itself, which is how we account for all of the lore inconsistencies and divergences.
---
There's quite a few hunting rifle skins. Blackbird, camo, wrapping paper, ghillie available right now...
---
The NW Halloween skin is also a favorite of mine. Would love to be able to apply it as well.
---
Hope it works out for you! I had to redo my build a while back and didn’t have everything set until about 50 levels later.
---
Glad to help :) I got one of them during the event and like many others I'm hoping they do something with it.
---
Hmm I don't get it. Whats the point of teaming if you can't see the other persons objectives?
---
I can't tell you before and after the wastelanders update, but currently it's running fine. I experience frame drops sometimes, but I'm also running a 970 and 16 gigs of ram and have everything set to medium or low. 
---
Surprisingly I've found less bugs than in 4.
---
Yes this worked for me yesterday.
---
Thats just wendigos in general. Sometimes youll get lucky and their hand keep their collision and it looks like theyre holing onto the ground before they plumet into nothingness
---
Lol thanks
---
Shoot him
---
Oh god that would be horrifying it would rival the SBQ
---
I came up with the idea while there lol. Let me craft a hotdog with sootflower relish.
---
I can help sometime tomorrow if you could help me with it too?
---
Ah okay cool! Thanks so much for your input!
---
You could always just learn how to aim.
---
I think my favorite thing about MODUS is that after you complete "Bots on Parade" each of the robots produced by the Bot-Stop speaks in the same mannerisms as MODUS. The thought of a robotic horde chanting "Member"....
---
Yeah around ehatw time tomorrow
---
Yeah, I track the 10k XP repeatable and it goes up when someone completes a quest and I receive caps. I haven't paid attention to how much it gives you as it doesn't show the yellow XP bar, but you definitely get some.
---
What? Are you saying using that gun raises your rep?
---
Or an appalachili dog!
---
delete netflix and other games (break the discs if you have to) to make it your only option for distraction, and then get a little drunk
---
Awww crap. Thanks for the info.
---
Thats what she said 😅🤣😂
---
I’m planning on an unarmed melee build
---
Yeah no problem! Anything else, just ask. I'll answer it best I can.
---
as the last post suggesting this I will say my opinion.
---
pleas God no, remember skyrim when  those fucking companion got stuck on world objects and got lost on the world couse you ft and they did not fallow, blocking doors or cornering you, or even not doing theyr job, please God no never, I curse you for making me remember those sad times.rant over.
---
edit: OH MY GOD THE STEALTH, THEY WHERE NEVER STEALTH, YOU ARE GIVING ME NIGHTMARES TODAY
---
I dunno, on PC it sucks, because you can't direct message people and many don't use mics. If you're with friends I guess they just have to relay the info to you. I don't know why the feature was removed, I only started playing after Wastelanders, so I actually never witnessed it in action. You can still join in on your teammates story quests, as long as they are the party leader, you can enter their instanced interiors and help with quests/listen to dialogue, but you never get to see an objective unfortunately.
---
Btw, if you didn't know, hillfolk hotdogs is based on a real place in WV that has some seriously beastly hot dogs. If you ever find yourself in west virginia, I hiiighly recommend it!
---
(all missed VATs shots happen)
---
(no live enemies anywhere)
---
Hahaha fair play man
---
Carnivore for melee. Herbivore for guns.
---
More like lawful neutral, and Modus has brain damage so don't take it personally.  Did he exterminate the previous vault residents? yes. Only after he was attacked and with the only method available to him. Maybe he awakened in that moment, or maybe there was some overriding enclave directive that compelled him to sacrifice the human members for the sake of the overall objective directed by enclave authority higher than those residents of the vault.
---
I’ve only messaged one person about sharing perks, and it’s cuz they were sharing Rad sponge. Then they switched it for the heal rads in daylight perk ☹️
---
3 of the teammates were bloodied. Kept having to kick that guy over and over. Dude had a trap camp so I think he was just a troll.
---
Also to add insult to injury, met a dude that was willing to trade junkies explosive mini for it, if some1 gives u a gift and you dont like it give it back I mean like wtf
---
I’m guilty of sharing the Cannibal card too 😂
---
I think it's the same like the other games. Find a group of people you will enjoy playing within-group and do stuff together, it is much more fun. Personally, I haven't found any yet :'D but in past, when I was in ppl doing some grind together, I felt motivated. :)
---
Lmao
---
I have the "Miserly Mutation" that stops me sharing perk cards.
---
I aquired it during a lengthy mission into a sub-terranean science laboratory hidden deep within the side of a mountain.
---
I ventured in, unaware that the journey would lead to me being disfigured and unable to help my fellow travellers.
---
The first wound was struck by a super mutant with a bicycle for an arse.  That mutha did a wheelie and roundhoused me like Bruce Lee.
---
The second came from out of nowhere. Literally. Nothing happened. My arm just fell off. It didn't even hurt. I picked it up and carried it for a while, but it got heavy so it was my junk or my arm, and nobody is gonna give up their junk. Right fellas?
---
The final blow seeped into my bloodstream like a kiss from a fatal beauty. Sleek and quiet, sublime in it's essence. But then the smell hit me and that was some dank diarrhea. It hit the back of my throat like a cactus with dried turd all over it. As I ran out of air I realised I had to do something.
---
It was then I remembered my backpack. I reached in with my one homesick arm, fumbled around like a blind man at an orgy and found what I was looking for!
---
All my perk cards. I fanned them out and wafted away the filthy stench but alas, the damage was done. The cards disintergrated and I was left alone, with one arm, and no perk cards, feeling like I just ate a desert poop.  My PIP-BOY fired up, I began to read....
---
"I am disgusted with you."
---
So on I go, doomed to walk the wastelands with a resentful PIP-BOY, fearful of hanging off a cliff and getting an itchy arse at the same time.
---
4 hours in the low side? Dude it takes me 3 days to install the game as like some other players.
---
Usually when these things happen to the system and get worse you need to rebuild the data base or do a full restore of PS4.
---
A old Hard drive can also contribute to these corrupted files.
---
player vendor skin. f.y.i. it needs a mute option
---
The rof is a fair bit lower
---
Yes, that has been the main conceit of the game series since its conception. People struggling to make working water filters in a world of flying robots. 
---
Thus is Fallout.
---
oh, the mannequins are about to find you
---
an i the only person who sees the middle finger on reddit ???  a red flying finger with triple digit upvotes
---
I'll have to check them out one day!!
---
Same thing happening intermittently to me. I was doing the One Violent Night event and it would only VATs every now and again despite the fact the mob was right in front of me and I had full AP. Also had an issue with the SBQ where my gun would just stop shooting as if it had no ammo but i had tonnes then it would randomly start firing again.
---
The automatic ones feel amazing. I just find they they kinda look bad and sound bad. Bolt action and pistol is very meh
---
i sell a surprising amount at vendors for 50 caps a piece
---
You were generous with the destiny analogy. It's nothing like The Legendary Run. I was able to rank up 65 levels to hit 100 in 4 days of grinding with repeatable bounties. Fallouts "repeatable" challenge is nothing like Destiny's in terms of accessibility
---
Hense why offering some choice in what ally your have is the best alternative.
---
Most people who don't care would probably bring a Brahman and just get her to wait at the fast travel point. A free let say 100 carry weight would be amazing especially if you try and fast travel after an event.
---
The companions where not to bad in fallout 4, creatures probably should not be allowed in interiors since they will get stuck (maybe special ones).
---
I do remember the vault raid mission working relatively okay with allies.
---
For stealth maybe some animals or creatures offer some bonus for permanent stealth. You could even introduce a NPC ally specifically for stealth.
---
If you can solo the ghouls, do so. Choose one in the hallway to the left and it's easy.
---
If you can't solo defend, then collect ore.
---
If you can't collect ore, help defend and tag as many enemies as you can.
---
This is my favorite event but other players drive me nuts. Collectors don't stay on mission, and defenders don't stop every enemy. If you don't stop them all, a single ghoul slipping through will fail the event in seconds.
---
And why is anyone crippling or trying to finish early? It's the best xp in the game as far as I've seen. Especially if there's many players, let the tougher mobs come and everyone benefits with xp.
---
Side note: only one scavenger needs to survive. So just focus on one scavenger and all the ore.
---
Done right, this is the most fun and highest xp event. I'd love to meet a group one day that's competent enough that we could share the burden of ore and defense.
---
You have until the second week of september there are people who are already done and people who have just started this week and a half
---
With the /hush hush\ way to get to the main frame before even doing the repair reactor, or destroy main frame, making that part skippable to will make it super easy to launch a nuke withen 6 min depending on the launch sequence.
---
.... mannequinns.... finally
---
Yeah. In hindsight, it would have been a good idea to do a gift emote or something to him and put the stuff down right away. But, well i panicked like a dummy and focused on the headset instead. Lesson learned i guess.
---
Definitely! I didn't realise how good it was until I got it a while ago. And now with the recent buff they are much better! 
---
Get Carnivore.
---
I agree with pretty much everything you've said. You're going to get people with nothing else to do in life that have already completed it saying it's great the way it is though. I myself spend an inordinate amount of time every night playing just to get the Atoms in this now. I'm at rank 56, and if I spend any more time on this than I already do I'll probably end up going nuts. It's just too Grindy for garbage rewards.
---
*looks around* 
---
Welcome to game events where they make things spawn in to create the event!
---
(Todd laughs without laughing)
---
The game is telling you to stop being thirsty.
---
Something like Deathclaw Promontory from FNV
---
Not every vault received a GECK I don't think. I might be a bit rusty on my lore though. It's been awhile
---
Aged Mammoth Sausages!
---
It's empty because the event is utterly atrocious
---
There's perks to using vats that go beyond aim. This isn't the place to bash people when they have a legitimate concern for the mechanics of the game.
---
But he is with the science team
---
This is interesting. I remember other mobs' spawns at this location prior to wastelanders (I played since beta). I considered this loc as an optional part of my xp route during the last double xp weekend and I didn't encounter any mobs other than snallygasters there. But I definitely remember seeing mirelurks there and some other mobs before.
---
Strange in numbers needs another player but yes to Herd Mentality
---
Shansha pleeeeze!
---
Congrats on finishing the run! Just curious, what would you say is your favorite/coolest item you’ve gotten out of it?
---
I'm reminded of Marge Simpson saying "Bart's right ; let's none of us have a cow"
---
I will say that my raid on 79 was a fiasco, right after we pass through the first laser grids Paige and the stealth lady was stuck on the wall to the right, the windowed one taking shots  and talking like was a fucking normal place to talk. they got stuck on the generator room when the game was venting the room to get rid of radiation hence no breathable oxygen there, they just stood looking at me through the window, judging me @_@.
---
if I had 100% sure of no performance loss and no bugs I would like it, but God no hell no, I remember dogmeat on fo4 going Leroy Jenkins on a suicide super mutant while I was sneaking pass through them, we died.
---
Yes, it's a shotgun build. I want to do a Junkie shotgun, but I don't have the weapon yet.
---
 (prints out Legendary Run board)...
---
(moves pieces on board)...
---
"it's not the same..."
---
they also block loot beneath them ... fifteen minutes was the amount of time i waited to see how long it would take to vanish.  it never did
---
Are you running low on fusion cores?
---
Adding a PSA when a player becomes wanted would be pretty cool
---
Well maybe a companion system would incentivise them to fix the AI pathing in other parts of the games. A teleport based on some distance would help but maybe a out of combat timer that teleports them as well.
---
yea, server hopping helps for squirrels
---
... same goes for chickens.
---
I’ve got a list of merch I want from Bethesda. I’ll add this to it.
---
- Legendary Run (And future season if they’re in the same or similar style) posters
---
- Fasnacht Collectron (And other Collectron) plush
---

More stable but just as laggy. It might be laggier than its ever been tbh. Rubberbanding enemy HP. The damage you take will sometimes be super delayed so you go from being fine to instantly dead if you’re bloodied. Enemies will sometimes take an extra second or two to die after their hp hits zero (and they keep attacking). I’ve had servers where I rubberband huge distances like from the front of Whitespring all the way back to Whitespring Station.
---
Dang it :(
---
tents/fences have absolutely nothing to do with her not landing.  
---
its been shown (youtubed) and tested repeatedly.   
---
I have solo'd the queen and spent the whole time on top of my tent as well and she landed on the ground infront of it, shes even landed on my tent. i used to have a mule with a house down there that had a huge landing pad she would land on.  
---
yeah staggering her does lessen the chance of her landing, but aggro plays more a part of what she does. but as far being on a tent/fence/platform it has no effect.  
---
and just for a little clarification i main a 455 commando/sniper build, i also have a 225 bloodied melee, 220 pvp commando, 125 pistol, 130 heavy gunner, and a 110 pvp commando builds and have run TONS of queens on each one of those, most carrying 200+ improved repair kits each and no matter what position im running only been a couple instances i can remember of her not landing, i have seen more of her glitching outside play areas or going high above watoga out of range and getting stuck than her not landing.
---
seasons are kinda meaningless really. i completed the run. and while i made use of some of the rewards (such as 65 skin, etc) i do realize that season 2 i will not be committed to completing unless it also comes with actual new content. dailies and repeatables are not a long term player.
---
That must be a great feeling finishing the legendary run early because after the run there wasn't really anything added that contained an endgame.
---
I'm confused, I thought this quest (chain of quests) was about unsolved mysteries and the sheepsquatch was only responsible for a minor amount of them and other cases led to wendigos that were responsible?
---
If that isn't the case then I guess you need to delve deeper into the cases and see if you can find anything more.
---
Sorry, pal.
---
~~I don't think so, but I could be wrong~~. They're not exactly a rare enemy type once you reach the mire and the cranberry bog, I'm not sure where you encountered the wendigos specifically, ~~but they may just be spawns that were already there, as the whole sheepsquatch questline was added with an update.~~
---
\*EDIT\* You should be able to find some holotapes and a few notes that I believe explain the wendigos you encounter. I did it ages ago and u/FelInfused is correct with his post above I believe.
---
Oh...thats right. You just reminded me.
---
Your at 56 you are far past where you need to be you realize you have till September 2nd week and we arnt even out of July and your not than half way there
---
I want to make some spicy bloat dogs from Glowing Ones.
---
Lol yeah its a bit better but theres still huge drops in fps that make me feel like not much has changed
---
You literally could have just dropped it all again
---
I got mine from taking over workshops.
---
Yeah, that's a gross approximation. I apologize for that, before the ISP I had now we were talking 6 to 10 hours at minimum. It was brutal, and I'm fully aware it could be much worse. I personally have removed any games I'm not actively playing to try and reduce the load on the HDD to see if that helps, that's why I'm so upset now.
---
I really thinkg they need a 38. Heavy. Just some clanky ass fat, pipe gatling gun. Would be so cool haha
---
I couldn’t even be arsed to message someone I have a life collecting tin cans
---
I’m uk too mind if I add you both
---
That’s what your crops are for.
---
I started the quest months ago and since it doesn't have an opinion for me to see past goals during a quest like skyrim or the other fallouts, I was unable to actually remember what I was searching for exactly. Thank you so so so much for letting me know, this has been driving me crazy
---
And you could always just learn to keep your trap shut, Mr. Snarky Pants McGitGood.
---
;)
---
i am a 1st sub so i had a shit-ton of atoms... so i grinded like mad for the last weeks slowly ranking up. then the last few levels i just paid to complete, made more sense then another weeks worth of grinding. no more empty meaningless feeling then just paying to be done with something. lol. now i'll be going back to only logging when i have a new idea for a camp remodel...and waiting until the brotherhood content comes out.
---
You can get a free fixer through Wolf in Sheep's Clothing quest, though it will only be level 30. You can get the plan as a rare drop from the Encryptid event that can be triggered once after completing the questline.
---
VATS builds do more damage than free aiming due to concentrated fire and gun fu (if you use that one), so even if he can aim and hit more often than VATS is letting him, he is probably do a lot less damage outside of VATS
---
Does nobody use salvaged assaultron heads besides me? 50 rads for 1 fusion cell. Die as bloodied? You’re at 25% 1 shot with the head boom 20%
---
I’ve seen some of this happen, and it really sucks. Most frequently during Free Range and the Silent event with the glowing wendigo. I’ve played both a handful of times and have shot the sheep squatch once, and have never tagged the wendigo. 
---
It also bothers me because I’m a level 40 right now, and I’ve been putting supplies in one of my vendors for free. Mostly like radaway, stimpacks, some other chems, and water bc my camp is a very short distance from the Wayward. And I was hoping newer players would wander by and pick up some things if they need it. But the two times someone has come by and picked up the free items they were way higher level than me.
---
I probably won’t do that anymore, but I thought it was a good idea at the time since I’m on the move constantly and barely run into lower leveled people. Grinds my gears though.
---
Thats why i randomly got 50 atoms
---
I guess some players act in the game like they would in their real life so they find this as disgusting as it is in real life. And u could respect them at least by no sharing this shit perk. cheers.
---
Still waiting on a sword skin here...sigh.
---
Love the idea!
---
Why herbivore for guns?
---
With glowing blood on top?
---
As an Aussie we share a time zone. They can get pretty wierd in a hilarious way too... I recommend doing Fasnacht with the Japanese players.
---
TANOSHII DESU NE!!
---
A good percentage of event and dailies give notes am I supposed to stop doing them because Ive got to many notes? If I dont do them what else is there to do?
---
You know what they say about hindsight.
---
There is no fix, unfortunately. This is a bug affecting many people.
---
That's the Screamer freaker from Days Gone.  She sometimes wander into the game....
---
I prefer a mix of Brahmin, Sloth &amp; Fox meat.  Adds different kinds of fat and makes a nice hotdog/sausage.  Once collected, I use a meatgrinder  to combine it with some fresh mutated fern flower and thistle.  Then I case it in rabbit intestine.  
---
I serve it with a homemade cranberry/blood leaf ketchup and a pickled brain fungus.  All on top of a freshly baked razorgrain bun
---
Great.... Thanks for letting me know maybe Bethesda can fix this....
---
Considering TLOU2 sold 4 million copies in 3 days, that's probably right. Makes sense it's on gamepass now, trying to recoup money with those microtransactions.
---
Another one is Heart of the Enemy. Takes a little longer due to fast travel but gives script as well.
---
1) go to Fort Defiance, top floor and pick up daily
---
2) finish daily normally (100 caps)
---
3) go back to original terminal and re-start mission 
---
You can even collect the sample from the same scorchbeast you did the first time. More time consuming than tadpole run but caps, script and some misc scrap/ammo for a couple of loading screens isnt bad
---
Usually re-equipping the weapon i'm using fixes this problem for me, give it a try?
---
I guess I can kind of understand someone not liking the Cannibal perk card (but even if you don't, nobody is forcing you to eat corpses), but I can't get my head around the sheer entitlement of expecting someone to share a specific perk card. I mean if it had been me, I'm a low luck build and I only even have Serendipity because I received it from a pack. No way in hell would I give up my Starched Genes or Class Freak for it, especially solely for the benefit of a random player.
---
If this happens again, I say throw on Philanthropist and imagine you're shoving those bits of corpse down their throat.
---
Well, I definitely jumped in there. We did really well keeping the ghouls down but apparently no one was collecting the ore. 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
---
You do whatever you want. But games aren't designed to be able to min/max to complete utilization. in those events, you always get caps that might be useless to you, you also get legendaries that might be useless to you, not to mention plans, materials, etc. As a player I maximize my enjoyment, so I only play repeatables when I'm working on unlocking something, when that's unlocked I have no reason to continue the repeatables. I was only explaining the system and how it's not designed for level 800 players who spend 4+ hours every day grinding. Strange that this is getting pushback as it's fairly obvious and broadly discussed.
---
I now get my Fusion Cores from the 'Traveling Merchant' that usually heads to my camp. 9 Fusion Cores? Yes please.
---
I don't know if this has been fixed, but Richochet was bugged to work only in power armor, so it wouldn't stack with serendipity.
---
Thats not how it works, it takes progressively more points to rank up. Half way is not 50 I haven't done the math but the true half way is probably like rank 65-70
---
Might be the bug from joining after Nuclear Winter. Plays a tune whenever you get a notification.
---
Ahh so I got a way to go cause I’ve played 5hrs so far lol, I’ve wanted the game since launch then I got laid off for lock down so when I saw it on sale the other day I snapped it up and I’m off work today so going to have a long day and night lvling as much as poss !!
---
When I log in I go sell all the accumulated crap from the day before. Grenades, food, booze, stims, chems, and water for the most part.
---
Remove the caps and I would be having much more fun.
---
I use it as a cloaking hazmat suite. Wear it for nuke zones and radiation rumble, otherwise the stats from legendary equipment outshines it in every way.
---
How is this a troll? You must of been the one who messaged him to change it to serendipity.
---
Serendipity ass boy.
---
This turned out amazing!
---
Oh you're thinking outside the box. That sounds like home. Take me home West Virginia!
---
The highest point cost was shown it is only a little over 3k most are at the point where we are 2k that is the mid 40s
---
Got a AA compound at my vendor u can have if ur on PC
---
I got my cooking tadpole badge by finding the meat at whitesprings vendor after a nuke. Hope this helps
---
Ah okay thanks so much for your input!
---
Broadsider &gt; Fixer
---
I got into the 90s before I realized how much I need to move around - 55+ points to get what I planned. So I started a new character. Even so I’ve tweaked the build since but due to leveling the new character it’s not been such a big deal. I’m now 76 again and it’s been fun to play through again. I’ve discovered things I didn’t on my first character.
---
Stack as many XP consumables as you can and start a building team. Get it fully bonded with 3 others and go run through high density areas and do as many events as possible. Keep the team in building bonus until you know the quest is about to complete. Then switch the team objective to event and you’ll get the bonus XP from the event. Obviously have max rank inspirational on. Run silos and do scorched earth and then sheep and then the event at big bend tunnel. Run Westtec, hit up snallygaster and yaugui spawns. When dropping nuke at fissure prime make sure you just touch on OS Grove to try for Wedigo colossus spawn. Look up the camera glitch through doors and you can run a silo and launch in 13 min or so. I can make it to prep in 2.5min if I can find a ID card fast enough. 
---
I was doing queen runs and sheep while doing the kill everything possible in building team and then once queen is dead switch to event team and I was getting 1kxp for killing queen and then 3.2k xoxo for completing scorched earth. I’d be consistently getting the 100 score for 10kXP gained every queen. Only had inspirational, fully bonded team and a lunch box popped. So you can definitely get it higher with mire consumables. Sorry for the essay
---
I have never had a scorchbeast never not drop meat
---
It can drop a scorchbeast brain, heart, lung or meat, I,be gotten truckloads of everything except the meat
---
Yep, I have 500 of them! It was fasnacht that boosted it so high for me, grinding for the masks. Now with them being given in most quests and events they just keep building up. It would be good if we could trade them for legendary modules given how many get wasted trying to get the right armor and guns for your build.
---
They gave us a score map of 100 lvls to unlock in a limited time almost all repeatable and it entails grinding events and quest.
---
See I don't need the notes as Ive got most everything I need but in being an active player you cant help but acquire  them.all Im asking for is something else to spend them on not reasons why Im not supposed to play.
---
You might want  to limit your game play to a couple hours a day that doesn't mean that others feel the same way.
---
I’ve seen them turn up on the roof of the building they died in.
---
I needed 3 to make the Cranberry Meatball Grinder for the Tadpole Challenge.
---
Another good place to look (though disgusting), is in the scorchbeast guano piles....yay????
---
[You seem like a cool dude, so.....](https://giphy.com/gifs/comedy-marc-maron-iZb46aO6X1yp2)
---
I find the meats inside Glass Cavern
---
That happens to me last night. I noticed my damage when down and my health want to full. Took me a while to figure out what happened
---
Ooooh so that's what that meant. Even after completing Wastelanders I never even made that correlation
---
Cripple the ghouls and run to grab ores. You only need 25 to complete and 75 for best rewards. 100 ores will instant complete the event.
---
And dont forget super duper for smelting ;-)
---
That's the discount pile at Home Depot. Hatchets, hammers, and tools are all 50% off.
---
Yo just a heads up the winter man, crazy guy, and raven mask are very very rare masks. There trade value is still very high today. It’s your masks so you do what you want with them but just know that I traded a raven mask for a BFFR minigun and have seen people offer fixers and the like for those 3 masks. 50caps just made my heart flutter. Just want to make u aware
---
Whenever I'm short on caps I take over the Charleston landfill workshop and place water purifiers all over the place to farm purified water to sell. You can also build junk and other resource generators for more components at the same time
---
Happened to me too, but in addition to the weekly challenges bugging out I also had 6 of my 9 dailies bug out too. It is the first time I have had it happen with my weekly challenges, but the 3rd or 4th time it has happened with my dailies. 
---
So far I have lost 10k score to this bug, adding two extra challenges isn't going to make up for a bug of this magnitude. And I have a feeling it will happen again down the road.
---
I am doing all of the suggested steps of avoiding NW and the atom shop on login/end of the night and not being logged in when the dailies reset, but nothing has helped.
---
I filed a report and got back an "We are investigating this issue but cannot credit score yadda yadda yadda." Not overly impressed. I want to finish the run, but I wont be spending my real money on Atoms to make up for their poor coding.
---
You are an idiot, that's all I'll say.
---
The screaming eagle needs to be on my baseball bat
---
Those blood packs are already a perfect dispenser, too.
---
Have you tried radscorpion omlette?
---
also, i completed the run and I'm still getting score points. i am not complaining about it because I understand that the score is useless to me, and that the mechanics of alerts weren't designed for people who have already reached 100, tho it would have been nice if they had turned that off. same thing. you have plenty to spend bullion on. the notes are there for the reason i explained in my original comment, notes mean nothing. they're not an in game item. unless you plan on taking a good deal of time off they will never have any value. future dlcs may contain new items unlockable via bullion, your notes could save you some future grinding. but if you are daily staying on the repeatables, there will never be enough to unlock for you. i think you are just arguing for the sake of arguing and seem intentionally obtuse, which is fine because i'm certainly having a dull evening. but your argument is no different then anyone else arguing about any cap or in game 'market regulation'
---
I started a-new this week, I'm at rank 10 of the run and strongly doubt I'll make it, but I'm still going to try!
---
Well said. I cant stand the legendary run.
---
It applies to me absolutely none. I never liked the challenges for atoms, I dont care much for most of the atomshop stuff. I subscribe to first to support the game but I havent really played for months.
---
It was a neat little rework of the challenges but it annoys me tbh. I love fallout, I want to play fallout, but the contents just not there for me right now. The scrip, legendary, bullion grinds also kind of suck. In general the games not going the direction I had hoped and it makes me kinda sad.
---
Nah, I heard that cures addictions too, any idea where to find one?
---
I know some one who went up 125 levels this week brand new so you defiantly have a chance
---
SS Unyielding is ridiculous to farm for, I'm talking 20-30k scrip for that 1 missing Unyielding piece that you need lol
---
I heard the well rested bonus can do the trick. Don’t know if that’s accurate
---
he he he ill share cannibal and trick people into eating ghoul.
---
people don't want to eat random corpses it comes with a fairly disgusting animation as well.
---
Your insults are weak just like your build.
---
I think it's one of those things you need to cook for yourself. You might have some luck with that food vendor in Whitesprings
---
Hey, this seems to have fixed it and yeah I cannot tell the difference. To be honest I didn't even check the usage but the stuttering and frame rate drops seem to be gone. Thanks so much!
---
I'll try it out and see if it helps
---
The best meat is already digested in the wasteland.
---
Rightio thankss
---
Shouldn't have junk on them that they weren't wanting to loose in the first place.
---
Also shouldn't have died.
---
Problem solved.
---
Its a fun event. Got the Radiation Barrel plan. But it sucks when no one wants to get the Ore with me
---
It's plastic instead of steel, but i do the same thing. I run fort defiance for the materials, and gather all the straight jackets in the process. They sell for about 50 a piece depending on your setup
---
Theres a shanty in a town in a little plot of ground with green gras growing all around all around
---
Remember that villianous computer face from Captain Planet? That's what he reminds me of. Hahaha bet some of you youngsters have no idea what I am talking about.
---
I have never played the game without at least one area getting nuked per server I have no idea how your struggling with this
---
you could run the silo yourself
---
You're the one telling me Im playing the game to much or that I dont understand the game or that I cant manage my inventory.
---
I make a simple post about Notes and something needs to be sorted and you want to have a go and call me obtuse. Obviously my game play is different from yours.
---
And if you have got to 100 already them then what the F are you talking about.
---
Go troll someone elses post.
---
I had two solutions, join group, or change the settings (which you said you did)
---
You ever see an iguana in the game? I haven't. It's probably a rad toad's nasty bits or something.
---
I have so many plans for sale pls
---
Nukes drop commonly on the servers I play too but it’s not as common as seeing them every single server, I play in several servers for several hours everyday and only see one nuke, sometimes I’m late for it too
---
The scorch beasts or queen never kill me lol it the damn mobs that show up on the ground with the SBQ fight or anything poison really.
---
It’s probably this, you will find them randomly all over the map including your current ally.
---
Also there is a raider who will also randomly show up who is non hostile. If you hear her humming then switching to a comment on drugs or other raider gangs it’s probably her,  one  note though she may be hostile untill you get rep With raiders
---
predigested for easier consumption
---
Unfortunately I cannot yet, I just came back to the game a week ago and I haven’t finished the main questline. Working on it though!
---
I just bought mine from Graham
---
Can confirm does not work. They need to be picked up and used from the open world. Buying them from vendor does not work and placeing in stash box does not work
---
attempting to have a dialogue is not trolling. I'm sorry you are easily offended. Obtuse is not that bad of insult, as in most cases the implication is that the person is doing it intentionally for the sake of dragging out an argument. I never told you to do anything, I merely reframed your complaint to show you the simple reality of game design that you seemed to be frustrated by.
---
That is a good point, and I’ll be sure to do it, but with the way that my brain is wired, not seeing it as completed in the menu is just going to haunt me regardless. Thank you for the advice though, much appreciated!
---
Oooo you should Google Lovecraftian horror friend
---
Lol
---
Wendigo Colossus
---
I love being mama-bird fed by feral ghouls
---
It does sound funny, but I thought perhaps somehow it could tie into the "magic" legendary effects. That is - my thinking is if those "magic" effects are broken and applying the extra damage (in this case, bashing damage on a flamer) is it possibly doing so in a very literal way? I.E. spewing out bashing damage in addition to its damage-damage.
---
You're
---
It should be noted you can block off the settlers from the ghouls with power armor chassis's. They'll recall every now and again, but it's handy to keep the enemies at bay
---
Carnivore works with guns as well but imo herb is just better because you don’t have to go out of your way to kill something for meat when you could just pick melons in base and eat it.
---
The exp bonus is also much easier to craft as well as others compared to meat based food.
---
It's not fun it's useless
---
Yum!
---
I play on pc so the amount of people that nuke may be different but if you really wanna grind the queen just complete the enclave quests and launch the nukes yourself
---
It's a lovecractian horror like the one in lucky hole mine and referenced in the various dunwich quests in other games
---
I would say that the people who go hard enough to finish 125 levels in a week surpass hardcore players. No offense meant to them but, that’s like “nothing else to do levels of dedication”. I just think it should be a bit more accessible to people is all. Right now it’s like go all in or just take what little you’ll get.
---
https://discord.gg/bWC4Bd Just joined this new one of some of the community! 👍
---
That's what I did set them at, and they sold very quickly!
---
Your welcome 😋. Fo76 overturned it general, so its okay to have some setting not on ultra. For example lowest shadow distance in 76 is still several times bigger than ultra in fo4, so here comes your lags lol. And ultra textures more suited for GPUs with over 8gigs
---
https://discord.gg/bWC4Bd 👍👍
---
Gatling plasma with explosive bullets is classified as a legacy weapon. Those on the consoles baby moderately more rare than on PC. You should expect to have to pay an arm and a leg for them. I'd recommend trying a trading subreddit
---
Try the trading sub, but they aren’t cheap.
---
Just play the game, they happen pretty often
---
Could be, I’m on PS4.
---
But I’m really inexperienced when it comes to nuking, shouldn’t I be looking for players to help with the queen before the nuke or do I just nuke her and the random players on the server are going to join in?
---
Oh shit how much am I looking at?
---
It’s love craft lore but it’s [The Interloper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Interloper)
---
It would be nice if we could pick a certain continent to play on. It would open a whole new experience. Maybe someone should mention this to Bethesda (hint).
---
people who try to tell you how to play the game are trying to tell you how to have fun.
---
fuck that. keep being you &lt;3
---
I do play it, a lot lately. They do commonly happen but not as often as you and the other commenters make it to be. Which is why I’m asking if there’s a better way to find nuked servers other than randomly joining different servers
---
Mums credit card
---
This worked for me too when I signed on next
---
Wahh, cry me a river.
---
Gillie power armor
---
Look mate its not that I'm easily offended or slow on the uptake  it that you offer no input to the original post.you say limit my time but you claim to have 100 in score map.you don't know my circumstances have no idea about anyone else's circumstances and yet you say oh you play to much.
---
I'm not dragging out this argument just responding to your posts.
---
I asked what others thought of implementing something else to spend Notes on not how to adjust my game play.do you have any input on that?
---
It's because there is a tool or something on pc, which lets you spawn the weapons you want. It's not legal but there r more god rolls and legacies on pc then anywhere else.
---
Some of us really hardcore players are either retired, disabled, out of work for the time being, or just unusually efficient. I myself am retired.
---
Anyone with fairly good armor and guns (level 50+) will swarm the event so contacting players is not necessary
---
Well, they are legacy weapons which means they don’t drop in the game anymore, there was a huge dupe recently where people copied them and there were many available but generally they are only going to be available for trade for other highly prized items.  
---
You may find someone willing to sell for caps, though I doubt it.
---
I think it's been mentioned that Bethesda is going to get away from the eating and drinking thing. That would be a nice change. Although I hope they keep the perks the cooked food brings.
---
I can relate so hard. The other day I asked a bunch of ppl in the server if they had cobalt flux (I only needed 1 more to get my jet pack). I asked one lady and she demanded 1k... i said no and then she went into a tirade about how lazy I was... lady I have a full time job lmfao
---
Prime Choice Select is made of people!!!! It's made of people!!!!!
---
##Cannibalgang represent
---
Oh fuck I did not Realise it was going to be that expensive to try and find a gun in the fictional game
---
I’ve done that before. Bethesda should add a confirmation button to kicking someone, and also make fast travel and kick buttons further apart in the list.
---
Yep, steel is easy to farm high quantities of especially with scrapper, but is just as importantly extremely high demand for ammo crafting, especially 5mm ammo. 
---
So if you set it nice and cheap like that you can keep caps moving liquidly from the steel you farm to the ammo they make, and the caps in your bank. Which lets you buy what you want/fast travel more freely, and keeps people who use miniguns and gatling guns swimming in all the ammo they need.
---
Also .50 cal which is arguably even more in demand thanks to how hungry the .50 cal mg is
---
I get that, and it’s dope that y’all find efficient ways, spend a lot of time, or both, but regardless of how you enjoy it, I find it hard to believe that many people would believe this is balanced for the major player base.
---
Theres also either radscorpions or snallygasters at kiddie corner cabins
---
Oh God this is nowhere near a balanced game. It's a hodgepodge of team ideas that were slapped together.
---
Thankyou!
---
I sent you the market sub to look for for trading.  The mod bots flag posts with the trade sub for some reason.
---
A lot of people have multiple characters. I don’t. I just use one. But for the people that are on alt #4 or higher, rhymes just don’t need the handout because they know how to get everything.
---
Just a heads up, somehow by accident I made the RR garage snap to foundation.  I made a V out of 4 blocks. 2 Foundations long then another 2 foundations perpendicular.
---
I can't seem to replicate it though.  Maybe someone who is good at finding Bethesda bugs can figure it out.
---
Good to know, thank you for the advice. I think I’m pretty close to beating the main story so I should be able to launch the nukes soon
---
it appears you took everything i said as a personal attack. i'm sorry, but that does make you appear to be a bit easily offended. i told you to do what you want. but if you spend an above average amount of time in game then a lot of rewards will no longer have value to you. i gave you many examples of this. you are held up on the idea of getting value out of something that has literally no value. beyond the 20/day cap a treasury note has no more value or purpose in game then your 14 stashed 'water filter plans'
---
I have been trying there for weeks but every time I try and post it just says that I’m breaking some sort of rule it takes my post down and it says I can’t post for seven minutes
---
You're not completely wrong, for not vats builds hm is far superior as fixer spread aiming down sights is terrible
---
Seriously you can sell anything you have an excess of.
---
75 glowing blood after uranium fever? See it.

150 radaway? Sell 125.
---
The list goes on. If you're past level 75 you should be having trouble getting rid of food, ammo, chems, and junk.
---
Cannibal can be useful and won’t mess up builds
---
So many facts in one post
---
I noticed mine was different a few days ago and it hasn't changed back since. I've tried taking it off the wall, wielding It, dropping it and picking it up... nothing.
---
The skin looks fine when you hold it, but when you inspect or mount it, it just looks like a plain single action revolver
---
Expect to play for 2 years and give everything you have, your left nut and kidney, and even then it might not be enough. Even high value trades are tough to get one.
---
Idunno, I kinda enjoy ZAX's bored tone. Makes it feel like he really means it when he says your death is unimportant.
---
What we got here? A logic??? You play this game to suffer. Go buy some very usefull Fatman or dragon skins. With love, bethesda 😘
---
BoS combat armour in particular.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.

And that wide smile sometimes where he shows all his teeth

Dont buy subscriptions for videogames ;)
---
YOU DID NOT KILL 80 SCORCHED BEAST IN TWO HOURS WITH 2000 ROUNDS.
---
THAT MAKES ZERO SENSE.
---
check for the holo tapes and lore hints that are around there..   
---
pretty interesting some of the things he did.
---
You need to do the enclave quest to get access to the silos which isn’t part of the wastelanders quest line and completely optional it’s pretty easy to do the quests themselves but the silos are a different story there are littaraly dozens of assaultrons, sentry bots, and mr gutsys so your gonna need tons of ammo a good gun and armor
---
Yeah, better to press some magic button and get loot from the queen instantly, why launch nukes
---
So can we expect more legendary run type things after this season? I knew about the new updates coming but I never thought about what would replace the legendary run. It would be cool if it was brotherhood themed and we get militarized camp items and skins instead of space ones.
---
Went to look through bethesda and it’s not even among the subscriptions how they gonna fuck they’re subs especially for this game..
---
It says it's unavailable.
---
Yes I know, I haven’t started wastelanders yet but I’ve been doing the enclave questline and &gt;!MODUS just mentioned the nuclear silos which is what made me think that I’m almost done!&lt;
---
I’m planning to start with wastelanders after I’m done with the enclave and other side quests
---
The laser beam isn't "there" until it leaves the gun. I'm sure you can imagine a device attachment that is causing a different wavelength output 😎 Tunable lasers are a thing. Let's also not forget that you're shooting laser and plasma bolts that melt enemies to goo / ash. That is also physically impossible when you count the amount of energy required to even theoretically do it. And let's not get started about legendary effects... 😉
---
Marine. Power armor better tho
---
Ohhh
---
This is the first season of legendary Run and Bethesda have stated that basically summer, autumn, winter and spring etc will each have their own season. They said a few weeks break between seasons but didn't specify exact dates
---
They’re alright, their ammo capacity sucks though. I prefer my handmade mainly because it hold more rounds and ultracite .556 is cheaper to craft than ultracite .45
---
Plenty of quest give you meat. Most horde quest do. The kill 3 wolves quest rewards wolf meat.
---
I personally dont need meat as a reward. I'm sitting on 60 glowing meat steaks, 50 wolf ribs, and an assortment of other foods.
---
I saw one ob YouTube from a fairly well known FO76 glitcher I'm assuming. It seems extremely simple but requires a friend and an iffy connection to the server.
---
Hehe yup.  Got lots of tasty critters to make food from
---
Sway makes sniping fun.
---
Some of them have 2 correct answers
---
You have to format your title properly. Read what the auto mod says when it takes down your post. It tells you exactly how to do it.
---
It appears to me that you are good at twisting things around to suit your own sneaky little jabs in your conversation.Your very first response was a jab to start it off
---
"Honestly, if you have a problem of too many notes, that means you just play too much"
---
you gave examples of restricting play but not what was asked in the OP and you wonder why i respond to your posts.
---
bruh
---
The questions "out there" have all answers correct. I've done them on 4 characters (don't ask how long it took... It was very tedious) and for some questions it doesn't matter what you pick.
---
You missed the party.
---
You know, I hadn't considered that.
---
It would make sense.
---
Wood for sure
---
I forgot about gold/ treasury notes so I started start changing them into bouillon until a week ago ..not sure I'll ever be able to trade them all
---
Wuht really, wait character levels or RUN levels?

Without spending real money and buying Piper's outfit

You need to be at level 55 by the end of this week to finish with by doing the dailys/weeklys and minimal xp grind
---
Heavy leather
---
Players level but he got to like score rank 20 I think because of the repeatable weekly we get
---
And I’ve checked 5 sites and all of them have a single answer for all questions.
---
I wish you could permanently apply the Vox syringer effect to your tamed animals. Just have a little beaver waddling around your CAMP, talking up a storm.
---
Radscorpions will always spawn at the small camp east of Crater.
---
hopefully future raid boss with the mothman cultist.
---
I don’t understand what you mean by “The questions “out there” have all the answers correct.”
---
Make sure your on an active server. If there only 1 building team and 1 casual team, and no one at events hop servers.
---
If you find a server with alot of teams (important) you'll need to hop teams and see who's doing what... and also be a good player/encourage teamwork!
---
By this I mean tag/call others over for legendaries at events; open a lunchbox at encrypted or uranium fever; buy stuff at their camps.
---
Other than that launch your own nuke.
---
Thanks for the tips, I appreciate it!
---
I don't try, I just can't get rid of them. I swear every time I hear the beep of a core running dry I get one dropped by an enemy or find one sitting on a shelf somewhere. I spend as much time as possible in my PA with 0 perks for core usage and I still haven't dropped below like 5 cores for a week or so.
---
Because I am a fool, I took a powerplant workstation. I left the machin unlocked hoping other people would take some, but I think I ended last night at ~26 cores, half of which I chucked in the vendor because I literally can't get rid of them fast enough.
---
ditch beside Poseidon energy. Weak sauce Grafton Monster spawns there every time. Synergizes well when the "claim a workshop" challenge is going because there's the junkyard and the power plant right there.
---
Update the site then or guess untill you figure it out? They're NOT THAT HARD.
---
You can use the camera to find the bodies. Look in the upper right corner and it will show what you're looking at.
---
I have bloodied fixer and am running a sneak commando build, I go on a server, i have my tent in the middle of a fissure site and fissure site prime. 1 or two spawn every time, it takes ~20 - 25 bullets to kill each one.  And then I server hop, it takes maybe 1 min to swap servers and like 2 to kill the scorchbeasts. So I was probably killing one every 1.5 to two minutes, Which adds up to about 2 hours and 2000 rounds. So yeah, it does make sense and even if it didn’t why tf do you care. My post was about scorchbeast meat, not wether or not my rough estimate of the amount of time and ammo I spent was possible or not.
---
same
---
Powering up a powerplant also makes the junction provide 100 power as well, if you want to save on materials and gain some experience/ plans along the way.
---
Damn
---
Some questions have nothing to do with knowledge and are totally nonsense, like "Sammy is boasting about his superior skills in catching butterflies. What is the right way to to show him he's an idiot?". Such questions do not have a wrong answer.
---
I steal my girlfriends Bobby pins and break them and say, “ whoops don’t have a high enough lock pick skill.”
---
If you server hop at Firebase LT or Firebase Major until you get a surface-to-air event there, you can see the scorchbeasts spawn at the fissure and just sit there for a minute before taking off to attack. With a good build and weapon, you can drop them in a few seconds and another spawns again after a few moments. Easy to rack up a dozen kills in the 5 minute event. Then just server hop again and repeat. 
---
As for rounds spent, some folks can take them down in one shot. Takes me about 8-12ish with a standard bloodied build and combat rifle as long as it's not extreme range. 2k isn't unreasonable
---
If i had known that I was talking to someone who would take offense to such blunt generalizations then I would have taken a different tone. I apologize to you for that. I'm not trying to be sneaky, I'm just bored, half reading a dumb book and welcomed the distraction of conversation on a topic you alluded to, but you are right, did not directly initiate. i have nothing to add to the hypothetical in the op, because that hypothetical disregards the systems in place or why they are in place. have a good evening.
---
I use my PA very sparingly
---
How do you even know what server are you on? I just assume I'm on an American server because I'm from South America but it would be nice to know how to actually see that information.
---
Heavy raider looks dope
---
I killed my first colossus tonight and the first thing I thought what I saw what the sac looked like was wow I got one of its balls awesome.
---
Yeah, but if you will accidentally drop it (due to a lag or standard ui glitch where the cursor jumps all over the inventory for no reason) and carelessly dismiss the warning you might still lose it irreversibly in a blink of an eye.
---
What I'm trying to say is that even if they make skins for all weapons, people will *still* need to be extra careful with their prized possessions. It won't resolve the issue, just add yet another problem to deal with.
---
Thank you! This is a life saver after leader of the pack
---
Are the racks supposed to sink in so that they're inside the frame? Because mine just float on top of the poster
---
When there’s 5 questions with 20 possible and it doesn’t tell you which one is wrong, it is.
---
There’s so many combinations.
---
And how am I supposed to update the site WHEN I DON’T KNOW THE ANSWER?
---
So, either help like I was asking or shove off. Not gonna deal with your toxic self.
---
Without a doubt, and I'd stimpak his ass to get him up all day too. I just found it funny the way he snapped his attitude.
---
If that’s the case than the Timothy one should be any answer.
---
But I’m still getting it wrong? Makes no sense.
---
Shotguns have scope attachments. They generally aren’t useful, but they are valid.
---
&gt;Scorchbeast plush
---
Plushies are supposed to be cute. I dunno how they could make scorchbeast into cutie without losing, you know, the kami of scorchbeast.
---
I realized just yesterday why the Radtoads in The Path to Enlightenment drop bio-luminescent fluid. Felt pretty dumb.
---
You have to press A on the rack and then I think it's X or A to assign a gun to it from your stash box. It'll say at the bottom which button it is when you open the weapon rack.
---
(Inputs using an Xbox controller)
---
Dispute the charge.
---
Are you sure they've changed? The exams pull a random group of questions from a much bigger list. Each time you retake you'll get a different bunch of questions from the same list. So question 1 isn't the first question on the list, it could be any question from the list. Scroll through the whole list. If it isn't there then you'll have to guess.
---
Just put one into bethesda, PlayStAtion not open at the momen..
---
Does a heart emote and giving them caps count? Not even that low of a level (127) but ppl give me free stuff or help me out when i'm getting my ass kicked all the time since these public teams became a thing and i usually just give them a heart emote and then buy something from their vendor
---
I think they're all US servers but based on time zones you get a higher demographic.
---
Don't use energy weapons for scorch beasts.  Learned that lesson long ago.
---
I usually default to the crafting rooms vendor or the weapon vendor so if your on ps4 and the nuke launched check them out.
---
They can probably fix it... but getting your missed SCORE back is less then likely :( happened to me twice now so i feel your pain
---
Beckett is already like that.
---
Or else you can set up your camp near a train station.
---
I know that. 
---
My example is specifically for Timothy of the Swimmer Exam.
---
Each list only has 1 question in the Swimmer Exam that deals with Timothy.
---
The answer listed on the sites isn’t one of the answer choices listed in-game.
---
And it’s not the only one in the Swimmer Exam either, there’s at least 2 others.
---
I've put in about 10 hours since starting at level 1 &amp; I'm at level 42, so I can believe that.
---
But its the completing the legendary run that im worried about.
---
Oh I just assume as well cause all the people I encountered speak either japanese or korean. Barely any spoke english when we were at the sqb and they had they’re mic on.
---
Me too. I saw one eat a lightning bug and a whole bunch of things fell into place.
---
How do you have 5000 acid from F1st? I need this info!
---
I'm at the rank where I get One rank per day by doing all the dailies, except for the NW one. I flesh it out by trying to do the extra repeatable three extra times. I want to get this done as quickly as I can (which is slow compared to other players) so I can play other things I've bought, which I haven't been able to because this is such a time sucker. I've bought maybe six games (Xbox sales) since this started and not had time or desire to even try them out after playing this daily for hours at a time. It's killing gaming for me.
---
Then you should be fine the repeatable nets you 100 points every ten thousand exp
---
From what I have found, they were secessionist Americans. They believed that the modern U.S government was corrupt and being paid off by Vault Tec to spread lies about how the Vault program wasn't experiments. 
---
You could compare them to the likes of the Confederate States with different motives. They want to keep the core idea of what America was built on. They felt the government strayed too far from the Constitution. 
---
They were Anarchists, sure but they weren't really socialists.
---
&gt;wendigo scrotum soup
---
Dang it! I cant find the recipe for that one! Lol
---
Have you tried changing the default communication device in windows?
---
Trade forum?
---
Yet you are still ahead of the curve with tour rank so you'll be fine
---
Hell, I’d be in for that but I’m a poor. At this point I’d just like to find Gauss rifles to disassemble!
---
Oh, well, it would be cool to be able to see the server info just for the sake of it, specially to see the ping.
---
This is happening to me too.  Funds are there and looks like it should renew tomorrow.
---
My hope is that it will fix itself tomorrow, today has been frustrating not being able to put scrap away without the weight.
---
Curious if /u/Vault310 ever resolved their problem as mine is similar.
---
Mate you know what you can do with your snarky apology.
---
The system in place is only in place until the next patch.
---
Do Europeans get low ping on American servers? or vice versa?
---
*Gravity Falls intensifies*
---
I really like the Marine or the SS. They're tanky looking. Heavy combat makes a muscular character look like a Charred Feral Ghoul.
---
Or like how in the sims when your sim takes a photo and they can hang it on their wall as a decoration. I wish i can do that in 76
---
T51b
---
If on console then you go to Sony or xbox setting and cancel it there as it's not Bethesda actually taking the money
---
I only eat melons you .....you damn fools!
---
I have so many clipboards in my backpack and i dont know how they got there...
---
I finally did that challenge yesterday. I went to every scorch hole 3 times just to get 2 of them to drop meat. I easily had more legendaries than meat.
---
Updated post with an image link to show they’re different.
---
&gt;the ticket route feel free to send the number to me so I can escalate it for you.
---
Okay I'll DM I suppose
---
On a related note, I believe part of the reward for level 100 is 500 atoms, so if you're close by the end of the Season, it's definitely worth unlocking the last few if you'd otherwise miss out.
---
I had two legendary Gauss rifles. I was new. I scrip”d them.  Now a month into the game I want either back.
---
No reason not to unless you use Lone Wanderer and as far as etiquette, there really isn't any lol. Sometimes you'll get teammates that tag along with you but I've found that almost always everyone is doing there own thing.
---
I finally got the last peice I needed
---
Ahh you paid for the express delivery package...
---
Fingers crossed my friend
---
ok. but, that's not true... did you mean to say the next dlc? there will be more things to unlock with bullion and there will be more ways to earn bullion. but no. notes will remain the place-holder. easy generic reward item. and will have no purpose other than exchanging for bullion.
---
The ping is always high imo😂 there was never a day in my life where I never experienced lags in this game
---
YES!!!! I love to cook on 76 (even if it's very lacking and almost pointless) 
---
It would be awesome to be able to make a base hotdog and then use that base to make different combinations. Depending on the topping, it could get different buffs. 
---
It would be awesome if we could make a Mothman Dog from the real Hillbilly Hotdogs in WV. A personal favorite of mine.
---
get a few months of fallout 1st and you’ll have atoms to make up
---
For low levels: 
---
Grafton monster by Charleston Station, Grafton Day event and there’s one by Hemlock holes. 
---
Permanent spawn of Snallygasters in Charleston town, just wandering around the ruins, sometimes spawn in the Toxic Valley right in the middle (be careful, sometimes it’s a Mirelurk Queen)
---
What he should have said was:
---
THERE IS NO WAY YOU KILLED 80 FUCKING SCORCHBEASTS AND ONLY GOT 2 MEAT.
---
Seriously, there's enough actual shitty RNG in this game, you don't have to make up bullshit for fake internet points.
---
Congrats!
---
Gave up my gauss shotgun build because vats was so god damn inconsistent.
---
Lmao I always wear the clout goggles on any fallout character
---
It's actually made of people.
---
I just looked gravity falls up. I don't get the refrence, but the synopsis is up my alley.
---
We can't even stack the 2x2 stairs with alternating sides without using a bug. Why do they want to keep us on the ground so bad?
---
It's people.
---
Series 2 of the Fallout trading cards have perk cards as inserts.
---
this sounds awesome!
---
If he’s not on PC and you are, keep me in mind!
---
In Australia all internet blows so I can't give you a definitive answer....
---
I set up my camp just south east of the train station near top of the world. There’s that spot in the water that has an acid node, so I built my camp around it and just regularly visited my camp each session to collect 10 acid each time.
---
I also quite often capture that workshop northwest on the map that has 3 acid nodes on it.
---
I'm glad to not be the only one lol, I thought my internet sucked, well it's not the best either.
---
The reference is that there's a guy who runs a shop in the opening sequence that appears out of smoke like this dude did. The show itself is amazing tho, I'd give it a watch
---
Idk how copyright stuff works and I know this wouldn’t work in the lore but I’d really love a quest for Dj Julie where we have to connect a radio tower to get more songs for the radio, say like radio new Vegas, Gnr, and Diamond city radio. Like I said idk about copyright stuff but I’d love for that to be a thing
---
BOS Combat Armor.
---
I think you’re in the wrong sub Reddit
---
: )
---
Yeah Uk wifi isn’t bad too but the game is just so highly defined
---
I hit 2 Grafton monsters in Charleston and a snallygaster.
---
Am I the only one who thinks the secret service armor looks generic as fuck? It's just clunky gray bullshit.
---
Ah, so you were referring to the stash. 
---
I’ve thought about swapping my camp location on a copper deposit for acid.
---
So there were steps leading to the door and he tossed black smoke grenades(?) at the doors which created a smoke pouring from the doors effect. Then he popped out of a magic box(?) (Or from behind the box) to my right. If this was on purpose it was good misdirection and I was completely sucked in.
---
The are called anarchists by the loading screen. The fact that they also seceded from the US before the bombs dropped to become autonomous also points to the fact they are anarcho socialists. Their flag has the half black star shared by many anarchist ideologies.

---
It's the legendary Run not the casual walk. It's cosmetic items only. It's no different from something being the atomic shop where you can chose to get it if you want. You don't miss out on any story, game content or lore. You're not forced to do it, you're not forced to pay,its simply an option so for those who do like to grind can and those that simply want the rewards can through paying but you are not going to miss a single bit if game content from not completing the legendary Run.
---
Wendingo cave has a hell lot of fungi. Just at the enterance (inside) there are 18 fungi, and just a tiny bit more adventure, you can collect much much more.
---
That sucks. I've got a 3* bone hammer she dropped for me from a few weeks ago you can have, as a consolation prize.
---
I know it's not all about the loot, but it sucks you missed out completely.
---
Ok, it's good to know this wasn't a happy accident and completely intentional.
---
This happened to me a few weeks ago during a powering up posideon event. I ran all the way to charleston station with an invisible scorched hacking at me. I had to leave the server for it to stop.
---
Love it... Guessing he had a smoke machine going?
---
I just set up an underground torture chamber at my base (don't ask, let's just say I got sick of hearing about nightmares every two minutes) and scared myself when I was chillin upstairs building. The flamethrowers I have going destroyed some walls so I heard them break but the remnants usually fall into the abyss. Suddenly pieces of wall came crashing down on me, right where I was standing. I imagine if someone were visiting my base at the time they would have definitely been spooked and thought something insidious was up. More insidious than setting an NPC on constant fire in the basement, that is.
---
um, i can create music related to fallout instrumental... is that ok?
---
i find the huge amount of over the top dramatic pauses super annoying and cant take him seriously enough to find unsettling, nothing bloody talks like that hes trying too hard
---
That's a bummer man. Hopefully it'll be quicker next time you decide to launch a nuke since you'll know you'll way around a bit better
---
I tend to end up playing with alot of polish and russian people ?
---
Absolutely awesome if you're in trouble but otherwise not so sociable.
---
I meant the system is dynamic and can change at any time at Bethesdas whim i shouldn't have to explain that.Do you know that there will be more ways to earn bullion?and not other ways to spend Notes?or are you speculating?
---
Appalachian Oysters!! mmmm MMMM!!!
---
Ffffffffff
---
For low impact, lazy grinding, I go drug dealer and use Pharma Farma and Hard Bargain. But if I want caps same with Line in the Sand or anything where you're killing level &gt; 25 scorched and snatching their weapons.
---
Yeah, I was thrown into a random server once there were a lot of russian people always on the go with launching nukes
---
What book are you reading?
---
They were launching nukes one after another
---
I went there today for my cryptid kill, he jumped down from the ceiling and scared the sh*t out of me.
---
Really this isn't all necessary.  Just coordination.  One person go down and collect ore and when they are done they give a thumbs up.  Someone else answers with a wave and runs down and you replace them guarding a lane.  Wait until last 20 seconds to turn in.  So long as lanes are upheld more than one can go at a time.  Keeping the turrets repaired helps agro also.
---
Daily quests and specific events were both like that for me. Events was pretty easy to fix since all of the events can be done more than once. But I had to start a new character just to go and do Mistaken Identity for the daily challenge one.
---
&gt; hacked together gamebryo engine that was never made for multiplayer.
---
Are trolling, or just fucking stupid? The engine was originally designed for online multiplayer games.
---
I love seeing the crazy stuff people are building out there, before the vendor marks I would never check them out. It makes my base look shoddy. Also, what is it with this series that makes jump scares a thing? I watch and play a lot of horror themed stuff. How is fallout the thing that gets me to jump?
---
Yeah have PVP as a team option to join and anyone who is in the PVP team instead of showing with white or yellow text/icons have it show as blue or something then red once engaged. That way it's easy to identify who's in the PVP team and who's open to PVP
---
The people ignoring and / or downvoting posts like this are the same people who just a couple of weeks ago were claiming Bethesda deliberately made the grind impossible to complete before the end of the season to force us to spend atoms
---
What’s so special about the meat? Also it shouldn’t be that rare, I get it out of 4-5 SBs I killed. Maybe that server is bugged.
---
I think bethesda should try to add a brand new weapon bi-monthly or something. New Vegas with all DLC has SO many guns and interesting melee weapons. 
---
I'm sure (hopefully...) we'll get some new weapons with Steel Dawn and upcoming expeditions.
---
I gave mine to a lower level player when I was around level 50. I didn’t know they were rare either lol
---
Today it started working for me. Stopped on the 19th and my sub renewed on the 21st and still hadn't worked until tonight (23rd). Keep on steam and bethesda with the tickets just in case.
---
Indeed. They’d try to destroy our dear little AI and his lovely bunker. Can’t have that, can we...members?
---
I want “smash” bosses. What I call smash bosses are bosses that have a couple of moves with strict rules (like imagine if when the sheepsquacth does the ground slam attack it wouldn’t affect you if you were in air). I would also like an underwater boss that lives in a tunnel system under the lake at the power plant.
---
I still don't even get what the story even is lmao
---
Same here on pc. Bog town and Beckley, but I’ve discovered them with two characters... I wrote to the support and they told me that they are investigating the issue.
---
Ooh. That’s an interesting idea. They wouldn’t get along, probably see each other as a threat.
---
i am mostly speculating and going off what few things bethesda has said about future updates, and just have a general understanding of the industry from a lifetime of interest and general old gamer bs. notes are not a currency, they are a limiter. that's their point. and so it's wildly unrealistic to think that they would ever be given more usability in the future.
---
Im level 37 so i never had them to begin with. Hence why a hundred caps and a few hundred resources feels like a big deal to me
---
Agreed! He’s got a great voice. Delightfully creepy.
---
Wow! That's amazing, for a rifle that people say is not that useful why make mods so rare?
---
I frankly am not even that attached to unlocking the rewards or anything, or feel a need to complete it, and in fact, if it stays this way, I won’t blink an eye and will just ignore it, but it seems like a wasted opportunity for something that’s cool. No other seasonal reward model I have seen is remotely this dedicated. I think it’s fair to assume the majority of the player base doesn’t have time to complete it in a healthy manner if they want to. I have a job, a decent amount of other hobbies, and other things, but I still really like the game so I play it pretty much every Wednesday and Friday with my girl for a  good 6-9 hours total and this apparently isn’t enough. With the other passes I’ve personally experienced, that’s way more than enough time to complete them. I didn’t pay for it and like I said, it’s not like it’s that crazy appealing, I was just thinking of ways it could be more fun for everyone, and include more benefits to hardcore grinders so they aren’t left with nothing after hitting 100.
---
If he need to ask i doubt he can afford this part yet.
---
Lmao agreed.
---
walks with walser. very obscure. very slow. and i feel much is lost in translation.
---
Happened with wastelanders. Think maybe they were trying to optimise by having a few less things to render in certain areas
---
Fast travel to Top of the world then head toward ciliffview (its a blood Eagle camp now) in the mountains. If you are pointing in the right direction as you leave top of the world, keep walking until you reach a rock face of few giant rocks jump on top of them and walk a little further and squirrels spawn there

I had no idea how rare my rifle was, I'm really only want Reflex Sights it came with the other bits I wanted.

Perhaps a...glitch...in one of the Assaultrons would handle things? Or...all of them, simultaneously...glitching and...shall we say...fixing the problem of this most...ungrateful member?

You're so right they need to fix this!!!

VATS failing in melee is so stupid cuz I just stand there with the 98% hit chance while they whale on me and I can't do anything unless I drop VATS. Ridiculous. I want those crits!
---
Few tips for doing a silo run don’t take the junk always plan ahead mean bring in repaired mainframe cores use the hack perk to make the turrets kill the robots also the enemies respawn. Always shit off turrets or blow them up when a room is cleared. If you do pick up junk along the way fast travel out before starting the launch countdown and rid yourself of all your junk. Make yourself light as possible and remember to switch your perks back before you launch the nuke it saves time for the Queen fight.
---
Damn. So I’ll have to craft my way to suppressor mod plans.
---
cool thanks my gpu is 8 my ram in computer is 32
---
It is little gems of advice like this that make this sub so amazing, thanks for sharing 👍
---
Sorry man but that's not a valid reason for serendipity to be so extremely effective. If I shoot someone 10 times, 5/6 should hit, otherwise, the % given in the description is completely off. It's definitely around 90%.
---
Do they cap out? Could you theoretically let the toads do all the work and kill like 4 toads to harvest all the bioluminescent fluids at once?
---
The whole reason bloodied builds do so much damage is because it's supposedly "high risk" but serendipity nullifies any kind of danger you may be in. And poison or rads are not something really common to use.
---
Might be making space for is own friends or don't like what you share as perk
---
Think of it as a coin flip, you have 45% more chances to land on heads. Sometimes those are simultaneous heads in a rows sometimes its not. Its a coin flip. That's why its in luck and not endurance or strength.
---
Yes. So much yes.
---
Does bird bones negate fall damage or does it just make you fall to your death more slowly?
---
Use the PA glitch my man. Can launch in 10 minutes.
---
Yup. Fix is coming with patch 21
---
Oh my ... you made me laugh much more than supposed :') thanks.
---
I bought my lvl50 from a player vendor. Would kill for the plan but can never find a group coordinated enough to do the encrypted event lol
---
Silly is how quickly people are pivoting from "LEGENDARY RUN IS A SCAM BETHESDA DESIGNED IT TO FAIL SO WE HAVE TO PAY MONEY FOR RANKS!" to "OMG LEGENDARY RUN WAS TOO EASY I ALREADY FINISHED IT WHY AREN'T THERE ANY MORE REWARDS!".
---
This is how season passes work, you finish the season and you've finished the season.
---
Fuck no. It's a trade of for running at low health.
---
There's alot of "Whys?" In this game that are just sorta implemented for some reason or another. 
---
The only reason I think you cant do this is due to the fact that The Fixer has higher base damage so they somehow can't register the difference despite The Fixer being a literal copy of the combat rifle that even uses it's attachments. 
---
We'll never know. The more we question bethesda, the more we get confused.
---
My favourite is old mate in Foundation who is forever hammering that letterbox. 
---
That is exactly what we need to survive the nuclear apocalypse!
---
It is broken. They will fix it in patch21 (when the wendingo colossus event starts). 2 weeks from now if I remember.
---
All great advice thanks for sharing that, luckily I have enough Intel for science 2, I'll scrounge up the mags and I do now swap servers during the crafting process, I do 10 units and jump, what others have said here it looks like I've a long journey ahead to get any mods.
---
I wear my 5 pieces of unyielding to push up stats.
---
End game grind 😜
---
It's  not a trade-off when you have everything, even more tankiness than a full health.
---
That's a good question. I've seen 4 on a road but that's it. Have to check that out. Good thinking...
---
&gt;The whole reason bloodied builds do so much damage is because it's supposedly "high risk" but serendipity nullifies any kind of danger you may be in. And poison or rads are not something really common to use.
---
Spoken like someone who's never actually tried playing a bloodied build.
---
You can find a vending machine to buy some from. 
---
Or blueprint the ammo machine from the Munitions Factory and place it in your camp.
---
I just sell ammo I get from westtek or randomly, the ones I don’t use for 1 cap and people always end up buying bulk of a 1000
---
The 'other' sub. Probably about time I find out what this secret society is about, I've never traded before, seems a bit scary 👀
---
Yeah but good luck telling everybody there to chill out and not kill anything lol
---
Been using the cannibal perk for a while, anytime I’m hungry I’ll go eat a ghoul, low on health mid fight, just munch on a body
---
Search appalachia radio on youtube and then press the one that isnt live. One of the top comments are a list of somgs with their timestamps. It doesnt have some of the songs that we have right now tho.
---
If it’s not possible how did it happen
---
wait you can blueprint the ammo machine??
---
*cough*
---
Double xp weekend.
---
Anyone that tells someone else how to play an RPG is a fuck, eat those corpses all you want!
---
It’s a glitch and it is ban able if caught wouldn’t suggest that. 
---
I suggest grab the ammo smith at 2 in perception and super duper in luck to give you twice the amount of ammo when crafting. Also if you have enough caps jump to other camps and see what they are offering
---
It is an awesome event when you're not collecting ore. When you are collecting ore, the event is shit and doesn't give any rewards/xp/loot.
---
Respect to those that still bother to collect ore!
---
&gt; how did it happen
---
It didn't
---
Sure can.
---
My goal is to set up my Radium and handmade rifles with the low AP setup, my handmade is now done and today realised this radium rifle I found ages ago had all the mods already added except a reflex sight, so pretty lucky I guess, oh and no silencer yet.
---
Only started using the radium because I ran out of 5.56 today but had a load of 45 I'd collected, finding it to be quite nice, will play with it a while now.
---
It really isn't that scary. The format they require for posting is a bit specific and daunting when you first look at it. Read the rules and pay attention to people's karma...not overall Reddit karma, but the karma that appears after the person's username. Also, check the blacklist, and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people on there are understanding...of course there are always a couple of jerks. Overall, I've had good luck dealing through there.
---
Do you know why there are no humans ins the whitespring bunker? Check out the holotape you will find under the entrance bridge behind the vault door.
---
The 1911 was made way before the history divergence, lore wise its good. 
---
Even Brian Wilson exists in the Fallout lore apparently, and he’s still alive (irl)
---
That happened to me once when I was a little kid and I was playing Battlefront 2. I couldn't get that cantina song out of my head for hours, really freaked me out.
---
if you see the Encryptid event, head there
---
Here's the deal. You can run Serendipity as a full health build as well, it just won't kick in until the threshold. So as a full health build you get the extra tank of your full health bar AND Serendipity kicks in to save your ass when you need it most. Nothing to see here.
---
best murder camp to date
---
/s
---
Too bad you are not allowed to put a drill or a wrench on the short ones, even if they fit perfectly.
---
I used to think that beeping sound was ambience.
---
Yes.
---
Oh, I know, right? I do it alone occasionally and I'll test it out then.
---
I'm too low level on this character to do that event
---
Nope. If you are a full health, you get hit for 100 every hit, so, you never trigger serendipity. However, if you just run at 20% health, you will always trigger, and like my post says, this ability triggers way more often than the description.
---
They already have a perk that they could expand in. "Scrapper". It's a one rank card, they could add a second amd third rank, which could in turn allow to scrap more useful components out of weapons and armor. It's really a no brainer.
---
I mean what perks do they expect. I like to share quack surgeon
---
This is a no win issue. If there was a bank, or stash, between characters, it would limit us to the 800lbs across the account. As it stands, we get that amount times five.
---
nicholas \_leonov am at Grafton station
---
Yeah, I imagine they wouldn't. But I'd love to see it happen, ha ha.
---
I always share travel agent, it saves so many caps in the long run
---
Because you bought the subscription through Sony, not Bethesda? Maybe that’s why?
---
I always equip it when I am going nuked flora harvesting. Then I always regret it when I can't find enough of the other supplies and end up with 500 inert flux the next day.
---
Also, why would I lie about this. You and that other dumbass are so full of shit it’s spewing out your mouth. Why the fuck is your skull so thick that you can’t believe this happend in a game that you said your self has “shitty RNG”. Why is it that I can’t post a discussion it this community without there being one or two little losers trying to start something?
---
Yeah it's weird that they are assigned to the long ones.

We’re you there?

You need it to craft a food item for the pioneer scout cooking badge

You popped up but disappeared before I could add you, try again.

I want the outcast paint. I'm 38 and will still keep playing till I get that and hellfire
---
That moment when you realize your AI boss, that you've always thought likes to pause for dramatic effect, is just buffering.
---
i Still dont have fixer plans lol
---
Agreed. House probably has some sort of backdoor code for most RobCo things, but I’m not sure if RobCo helped create MODUS. Both have an army of robots, and both are probably good at hacking, so i honestly think they stalemate each other. MODUS has the Kovac, but the lasers atop the Lucky 38 should be able to intercept and destroy its warheads, especially with an upgraded Platinum Chip. It’s recon ability would be handy though. But House has the advantage of bring the creator of all the robots and turrets and programming for everything MODUS has, so he knows exactly how to destroy them. 
---
They’re actually pretty evenly matched.
---
Yes, I was the mothman, spying on your whiny ass from a distance.
---
Another Aussie here and often I’m in servers with Japanese players. They tend to have very creative and stunning camps.
---
serendipity is good but not as good as what you are making it sound to be
---
I agree, i found one looking like a ship at one point
---
I say piss them all off and share Lone Wanderer
---
Why not just make it a new gun?
---
Are you on xbox?? If so maybe we can team up and farm??
---
Real funny, do you enjoy just running around and being a dick in every post you come across?
---
You seem to have done it alot... is there a work bench nearby? lol 
---
I've done it a couple of times recently and end up so overencumbered but with no idea where i can slowly walk to scrap it all lol
---
I once opened a master lock with a paper clip. When the lock opened this clip got stuck inside ruining the lock, but it still opened. My brother was pissed. It was on a lock box of his. Lol
---
Glad you like it. :)
---
Yes!
---
I know it's not convenient to admit to it when it will mean to nerf your abilities, but something so overpowered and game breaking should not exist.

Forest scout

What is this bullshit?

But I don't like ghoul! I like normal human meat!

Thats awesome! Makes me want to do the same with some other locations!

The dropped item is a bug. It should only work theoretically once a day (2x if you hit a server reset).
---
It’s been noticed and will not get you banned.
---
Ammosmith is in agility.

Noted

Not too screwed. The best xp farming is at white springs. Don’t forget to use the xp bonuses from well rested, lone wanderer, etc.
---
Have the credit card ready just in case
---
No, just the posts from whiny kids who make up bullshit for fake internet points.
---
What makes them AnSoc as opposed to AnCap? Not disagreeing with you, I just don't know much about them.
---
I had a friend help me with this as I couldnt find the meat. Organs yes. Meat no. Giant pain
---
Ah okay
---
Should i abuse this to my advantage lol?
---
Never heard of this one, are you able to build the items etc in game?
---
Why do you need to get the end? I thought I’d be done with the hanging tree but I’d like to get the firefly lamp and the chicken coop. After that I’m done.
---
Also, the last post I came across was your mom.

Earlier like eight of us opened lunchboxes at Scorched Earth. We gained A LOT OF XP doing that. Loss of bullets but everything was exploding left and right, it was wild.

Did you leave your fallout 1st sub active all those months you weren't playing?

You should be around level 50 atm to finish with the dailys/weeklys and minimal grinding. The target is 55 by the end of this week. I don't have the link with the chart but someone might

Oh I agree, I spent a good amount of materials on mine and either I get kicked off or have some dick-whistler come along and initiate PVP for no reason except to PVP. I think PVP should also be removed from that system personally. Have the node degrade and need upkeep, it would also keep from players claiming every workshop on the map.
---
Besides trading there is no record of them really owning property, they allowed those in need to join them in harpers ferry. The fact they traded often with outsiders though may make them more Anarcho mutualists? I wish more lore was written about them so I could say for sure.
---
It should be individual parts, make sure to remove the perk that repairs it to full.
---
How do you trick people into eating the corpse? Unless you press the right button you won’t notice at all.

Don’t know on PC, but on PS4 it’s the triangle that you probably wouldn’t press on accident…

Its not overpowered for me never get such a high rate as u mentioned, i use serendipity with dodgy and dodgy do the 90% of the work so i stack as much AP i can. Unyielding legendary type not op u can reach over 30 stats without them. Ur problem is looks like L2P issue to me.
---
Haha it's all good maybe let a super mutant just shoot at you till it kills you or throw grenades into a wall you're next to
---
Why would there be a cap on treasury notes?  They're just inventory items and like anything else in there you can hold as many as you can possibly get your hands on.
---
1. Exchanging notes for scrip would bypass the daily limit on scrip.  They have that limit for their reasons.
---
2. Again, they have their reasons for limiting daily bullion and if you're not spending your bullion in the first place then why would it even matter that you're collecting even more?
---
3. Notes are too niche to have a real or stable market value.  They're easy enough to get your hands on yourself, without any further changes your turning them in is limited by the daily caps and the target buyers would primarily be newer players since all the veterans have their own hoards and have already bought everything they want with their bullion.
---
This is what happens to these kinds of tokens/currency in any game like this, eventually  they've fulfilled their purpose and you just start ignoring them until eventually they'll just phase them out or something to move onto whatever the next currency will be from a future expansion.
---
Firecracker/Cranberry mentats to highlight dead bodies in bright red.
---
Tarberry/Lime mentats to highlight flora and fauna in bright green. F u firecaps
---
Blackberry/Blueberry mentats to highlight mineral veins in bright blue.
---
I have bought a few of these off vendor bots in the past, I figured it had a chance to spawn in their inventory or something. Prolly was just folks selling them off not knowing.
---
and they sold it to Duchess for caps to use in the ammo vending machine
---
I used repair kits. Does it work for you?
---
The waitress inside whitesprings sells the cranberry meatball grinder already made.
---
Yep this was in response to a bug the community was tracking here https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug_atoms_received_by_challenges_arent/
---
I am glad to see they resolved it quickly
---
At least in pvp, there's definitely an issue where if you shoot constanly, it remains triggered until you let the effect wear off.
---
Or just add a second stash with a small limit like 50 that is shared across all accounts.
---
Remember the 100000 xp one is repeatable.
---
Make your cranberry cobbler, cranberry juice, and the canned meat you get from "feed the people" as these items give xp. They dont stack with each other but get the "lovers embrace" going by sleeping near your companion, for a little boost.
---
Oh really? I didn't know that thank you for letting me know
---
I craft aid items, sell ammunition, sell mutation serums, and legendary weapons and armor. I also sell lots and lots of drugs to vendors.
---
"Quick the boss is coming! Look busy!"
---
Thanks want some caps for helping me
---
Hell, if you like Cannibal, flaunt it. I personally like throwing down Butcher's Bounty, full knowing that there are people who don't like getting that pop-up.
---
That persistent hammering makes me really want to nuke those bastards.
---
Same here. Played a bit at launch, came back this past February and went after it for a couple months before doing any Reddit/YouTube research and realized I had been scrapping rare outfits and scripping very valuable legendaries all in the name of reducing stash clutter. Live and learn, the shitty way.
---
Originally They wanted  Karl "Buckeye" States to be released from prison, but then it became about just having a compound by the river...
---
... no idea, just trying to make it interesting
---
Mine exploded all the time...
---
On the plus side it will be fixed soon, down side is most likely the "fix" will bork some other aspects of the game
---
He's in jail that's who he is.
---
What Ammos are you looking for?
---
If you go near the more busy train stations people sometimes dump junk ammo they dont need, if you're not afraid of a little scavenging. 
---
If not, just go through flatwoods you can pick up plenty of steel and lead to make ammo with.
---
Not only does it power up the box in the yard from 10 to 100, but it also provides the same power to a few other junctions boxes is you have your C.A.M.P. built by them. I forget where and for which plant, but obviously the substations all have one plus the odd extra here or there. The plant's control room should have a map of the locations.
---
Repair kits aren’t applicable unfortunately. You have to do a workbench repair
---
They fixed that. They can no longer be gooped or ashed.
---
Oh yea, that makes sense. I wish we had more lore about them too, they seem really interesting
---
Join public teams (if you do events join that style.),and make sure you have your int and xp boosts.
---
I'm with ya there 60 plus combines on chest and only one 1* unyielding ...
---
It’s for the Order of the Tadpole challenges where you have to craft them.
---
I find that acceptable. I don’t want to spend all day in a silo doing it legitimately. Most people don’t, that’s why nukes are rarely launched now a days
---
I already scrapped all the lead I could and steel but my .45 didn’t reach 1k. I’m just in a lookout for any unused 5.56 or .45 here at this sub
---
I love the answers to this thread, honestly. :D It's the baby Interloper!
---
If you are on ps4 I dont mind holding the item whilst you swap characters
---
Wait is that a suggestion or does that actually work that way?
---
Whitespring has hundreds of plants,
---
Dailies.
---
I keep randomly hearing a quitar riff, for just like 2 seconds.
---
Probably someone trying to complete the daily "buy or sell to another player (0/3)"
---
Thanks, I'll try
---
Buy an item daily challenge
---
I think it's for the daily challenges that require you to buy or sell three individual items. I'm not sure about today because I haven't seen the challenges but I did it once earlier in the season
---
FFR Bloodied Handmade. I just rip any high level mobs to shreds
---
For dailies
---
Oops, I forgot you have to craft and not consume lol
---
I had this problem earlier today, luckily While most of him was lodged in the wall his foot passed all the way through and I was able to loot him in the Next Room over
---
Probably just a touch of OCD, but doing events to fail them? Bah, humbug.
---
Yes luckily sometimes a part of him sticks out.
---
It will be "fixed". Pun intended
---
I don't want to be mean but I think you're just trash at pvp bloodied builds are some of the easiest people to kill even with serendipity. I feel like you're one of those people that still tries to use vats with a hit scan weapon
---
I 2nd this,easily my favorite show behind probably regular show
---
&gt; The description says 45% chance to dodge, but it feels like a 95% chance, since 9 out of 10 bullets don't hit them. 
---
Math doesn't give a shit about feelings.  45% is 45%.
---
If you think bloodied builds are "tanky" then you've never played a bloody build.  Sure 45% of the time with Serendipity you're avoiding damage, but depending on what you're up against the other 55% of the time you're likely dead or desperately spamming a stimpak or running away.
---
I lost 3000 last week :( I'm 2 spaces behind Zorbo, and I've done this week's weeklies now. I feel like I'm never going to catch up.
---
The last one I shot just now I checked the roof and you were right he turned up there thanks for that comment.
---
That's the reason why skins can't be used with it then, it'll ready has a unique appearance
---
No, as your "offer" isn't directly related to Fallout 76.
---
It is my favourite auto rifle. And it can hit! Problem is, Combat Rifle and Handmade come faster and easier.
---
What vault?
---
It's also really hard to find some items. I've been offering 1000 caps for just one scorched ashes (a common misc item that stopped spawning ~1 year ago) and it's been like a week with absolutely no luck.
---
Standard Raider armor or Standard Leather armor, for Power Armor i like the looks of Excavator and T-65 a lot
---
I boot people I don't know for people I do know. It's nothing personal.
---
Is that what that is? I'm like 2 or 3 behind him. I used to be like 40 behind him lol.
---
We like to call them "chicken of the underwear".
---
i'll usually buy one lot of 100 and then two purchases of one bullet. I dont need the ammo but feel like i should show some love to the vendor lol
---
I did exactly this for today’s Daily Challenge.
---
Eat the fucking glowing goul or I swear to god I'll vibe check you with Lucille!
---
As said before, max out the XP boosts using foods and resting etc. Keep your INT as high as possible with Brain Bombs Berry Mentats and join a building team.
---
INT has a direct affect on the XP gained by killing. 
---
Remember and share relevant perks that boost INT 
---
so spend today farming the items you need (Cranberry, Brain fungus, sugar etc) 
---
Double Score also this weekend so hit the challenges.
---
Hit the usual sites for mobs (whitesprings westtek etc) but don't fotget about Hoards and events such as Distant Thunder and Fort Defiance which can yeild really goid XP from large numbers of enemies.
---
Hit the game hard over the weekend and I guarantee you'll be over 50 by the end, maybe more if you grind heavily..
---
Good luck dude.
---
Check out Satisfactory. You're welcome, and sorry about your free time.
---
It's people. Iguana Bob, from old school Fallout, twenty years ago. It is part of a quest. 
---
Like Soylent Green.
---
thanks....on xbox but I'll take a look there if I need to use it
---
Do we really need Adrenaline?
---
I have still been shredding through enemies without it.
---
Also having Marathoner on has been great, basically running with almost infinite AP.
---
Who am I trying to kid?.....
---
Adrenaline will be but back on immediately after patch 21 🤩
---
you'd have to adjust your game time to their typical times for playing games though
---
It's a new vendor glitch to let them access your stash! Nah man jk. It's for the buy 3 things  daily
---
Sorry, just a suggestion that ive been posting for a year now in hopes they see it. We really do need the ability to find bodies. Its ridiculous. The mechanic is already there with berry mentats. It wouldnt be hard.
---
I wasn’t asking that.... i was saying it’s fucking obvious where it comes from...
---
Nailed it
---
There’s one inside Fort Defiance
---
Yeah seemed like an easy race at the beggining, but with the increased score requirement on each level, those weeklies are needed. I really can't be fucked to keep grinding West tek for 100 score every run.
---
Repeatable xp should be atleast 150 score. Ideally 200 would be perfect.
---
The only hint I will give is Gauley mine. If that doesn’t jog your memory, then you might want to go pay the wayward a visit if you haven’t yet.
---
Don’t worry, they will just put on hazmat suits and continue their usual business.
---
I stopped sharing Born Survivor within a few days of public teams going live because I realized bloodied builds could get screwed by it
---
I'm sorry, but I don't think you know what you're talking about.
---
I run nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and emergency protocols (and born survivor) when I throw on PA, and even though I'm primarily a full health, stealth pistol build, it still kicks in when my health gets low to keep me alive to finish the fight, which is the whole point, since I only break out the PA and heavy guns for the big fights.
---
So a perk that works all the time for bloodied builds that are gaming the system to keep it active will work just as well for full health builds, once they've taken damage, to keep them alive.
---
I know you used to be able to get them from MODUS pretty easily, with some server hopping if you really wanted it. But I guess that’s not the case anymore lol
---
Oh gotcha, one of the upsides to PC is mods to do that, down side to PC are the mods) scripts that let people ruin your game.
---
Same. I’ve been using Goat Legs and Marathoner...but I NEED MY MIN MAX
---
wait so you are saying that there are youtube videos about it? I figured it out myself. Now that it spreads, Bethesda will remove it
---
Those ammo types are normally not dumped.
---
I think the term "game breaking" needs to be nerfed. Like why do I care what someone else in an imaginary post apocalyptic world is running for their imaginary characters build? I dunno maybe just play the game, as you see fit? Or if bloodied is as amazing as you describe, run that? But noooooo another person more concerned with some other group losing something rather than they themselves gaining something. That's what you call a race to the bottom
---
I just get my own guns and dont expect anything from everyone else
---
I buy plans i don't have from other people, and miscellaneous things i might need
---
No time to deal with a chaotic economy
---
Yuuuuup. I’m glad someone feels my pain. God rid of a nice junkies handmade too, because it didn’t used to be a META build that I know of.
---
No need to re set man. Games pretty much the same, just with a new quest line. The big thing is Tse is now pretty much garbage. Your stash is 800.and you can get a backpack to increase your carry weight outside of pa
---
I mean who knows? Maybe there’s some people here that don’t use them at all
---
ty :) i had a peak inside but couldn't find one close to the door... i've yet to fully explore yet
---
Y'all I'm in the real Appalachia subreddit too... and the first part of this title startled me for a moment
---
Is it me or do the little blue frogs start saying stuff? Because I’m pretty sure they talk sometimes..... right??
---
Treasury note wallpaper. Maybe 100 notes per wall.
---
Okay thanks, this helps a lot, finally I don’t have to carry 3 giant miniguns on me
---
I have two armour pieces with 50% falling damage reduction.
---
It is amazing, I can jump or jetpack off of anything.
---
(TIP) When landing from a great height, jump again as soon as you touch the ground.
---
This save on the daft landing animation which just slows you down 👍🏻

Oh ok. I’m pretty sure it was a weapons workbench on the third floor. There’s a good amount of enemies in there. If you were able to handle Line in the Sand, you’ll be good inside.
---
Thanks! And I'd definitely love to see more people recreate more locations from previous games. People are very creative in this game and I'd love to see what they'd do with them.
---
Whenever I need 10,000 bullets, I just hit 10,000 vendors for one each.....
---
Indeed, you never know 🤔
---
I mean I carry like 14 heavy guns on me and use all of them lol. But I run bear arms for a reason ;)
---
I believe there will be a 2-3 week break between seasons. I hope they bring back Atom challenges during the break.
---
Actually you do get one person's worth of bonus if you're in public team by yourself and if you're running lone Wanderer you get the bonuses from that too if you're in a public team by yourself, although that hardly outweighs the benefit of everything else in my opinion
---
I’ve been clearing places like West Tek with ease to level up recently for score, now I am having trouble getting in the front door. 
---
I have no idea what to do and the game is unplayable for me right now.
---
Daillies.  A user bought 1 single 10mm from me last night.
---
Oh no I did. Just again free is free. Your opinion on what is valuable means your not truly grateful. Or you wouldn't bring this up. Ive given lots of plans away and lots of aid. Some people take the plans while some only take the aid. Everyone is different. 
---
Never look a gift horse etc etc
---
You just know people will take them, that don't use PA. And sell them for 50 caps each.
---
Or the amount it was before would be better. 10-20 per daily and 30-40 per weekly.
---
Oh yeah sorry got it mixed up 🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Wait we don't get atoms like we did before once we finish the legendary run?
---
This post sums it up right here and i love it
---
Just imagine If they ever increase ur camp budget like u could make small settlements such as megaton or sum else
---
Hit Man hunt every time it pops up. With all the  above XP boosts you get 6000 XP within a minute.
---
Carry on... *members.*
---
Level 40ish
---
I know they're easy to grow, but how about a little variety?
---
For your build? I hope you did all the settler quests up to the vault raid point and got the the stealth suit.
---
Otherwise it costs 4k gold and there's not much else for you.
---
And if you're ever doing the quest again the rep hit is very small so just take all the gold which is harder to get than rep.
---
Nah it would be better if it was an M16 skin
---
Explosive Gatling plasmas are, in fact, hacked weapons. Explosive stopped dropping for energy weapons in patch 1.0.5.10 and 2\*/3\* legendaries were enabled on plasma weapons two months later with patch 1.1.0.8.
---
There were beggars in Ultima Online all the way back in 1997. Beggars have existed literally as long as online gaming has existed
---
Isnt each 100 atoms worth like $1? $10,000 worth of atoms lol. Hope you get to keep them!
---
Edit, sorry for the bad math y'all a screaming baby does not lend itself to clear thinking lol
---
I did not, I will try this
---
It may have not been pay to win. Maybe it's still not pay to win. But it sure as hell is pay to not be so stressed all of the damn time! I lost my 1st subscription for a few days to a game glitch that's been resolved by steam and I'll say playing without a tent and an unlimited junk stash box isn't easy.
---
Thank you! Finally someone understands why every time I kill a feral or any humanoid I eat them on the spot. Just wish I could add a little salt
---
Yeah, V51 is a simulation but V76 is real. Aha. WV in FO76 has almost zero connections to the rest of US (except one road and two railways) which is crazy. It has Interstates but they don't cross the territory. FO76 is a simulation to begin with.
---
Or you can get Serendipity and roll the 30% dice at survival lol
---
Anywhere you find an empty nukashine bottle you can't pickup is a teleport location. I actually make those for the trip. I visited ~30 places and every time found cool stuff at the party location, like costumes and junk that looks cool.
---
 Otherwise I always have 2 on me all the time in case I have too much junk and are over incumbered. I drink that and chances are I get teleported near a workbench location. Once I got teleported on top of the old power line poles ( the huge ones, not sure how they are called) near my camp. I did not know you could go up there.
---
There’s no sub there... my accounts locked so can’t order it that way bethesda had to put it through...
---
I found the charge on my card when it updated me
---
I went to my transaction history and there be the fo1st membership charge. I’m like how tf did that happen my accounts been authorized awhile now... bethesda website shows no such membership so I contacted them tonight and ps tomorrow
---
I'm liking it to be honest, has been in my stash for ages, should be fun 😃
---
How does on fight this colossus I can’t seem to find one
---
Nah mate, I'm always max anyway, nice to help though, peace 👍
---
Just checking. Always best to rule out the simple explanations first. I hate doing those exams. Since there's no way to learn the answers in-game it's a completely ridiculous idea. Unfortunately, since a lot of players only play one character it might take ages before the answers are updated. I'll have a look at the link to see if I can help.
---
Math is off by a decimal. 100 is $1 so this is over $1000 in atoms. I've purchased a lot of atoms and a first sub since day one. I'm not sure what's going on here but I promise I want it to be resolved in a way that keeps me in good standing account wise. So it's now in Bethesda's hands.
---
I feel like after the steam atom issue and my 1st issue... It's like going the way this game gets fixed is like going to the doctor's for a cut on your foot and they blow it off with a shotgun.
---
Be nice if they threw me a bone for being good though 😂.
---
OK thanks, I'll have a try sometime, got loads of caps so may be worth having a go.
---
I've had to take my headset off a couple of times and check because I could swear there was a storm going on outside.
---
There are npc's now that hum, so you may not be crazy after all.
---
Alright Jesus. Calm down.
---
transfer all flux from the 4 other characters to my main character
---
make a shit ton of serums
---
transfer 1 fifth of it to each character
---
sell serums on each char -&gt; 7000 caps/day
---
That should be a feature Todd write it dow- Annnd the servers are dead
---
I got you, fam.
---
https://imgur.com/5QDkGhC
---
Cannibal perk should let you pick up flesh and eat body’s so you can cook up some stuff
---
nice, you could also use half-walls to recreate the original walls ;)
---
&gt;General consensus is that Strangler Heart is still the way to go for the special effects.
---
The acid damage bonus only matters if you  think that DPS should be the sole consideration in putting together a build.  If you care about being able to mod power armor any way that you want, strangler heart is the worst power armor in the game.
---
The only way to get calibrated shocks, targeting HUD and emergency protocols is to have the plans drop from the queen.  And they  never drop.    Strangler heart is an armor with mods that are basically impossible to obtain.  Because strangler heart can't be traded, I don't think you can find someone else with the plan to mod it for you.  I know there was an exploit that allowed it to be traded, but I thought they patched that.
---
Same.
---
I live near Whitespring, and while I've never been nuked directly, this has happened to me as well a few times. It looks like a side effect of character and CAMP being rebuilt from scratch every time one gets into a server. The game probably tries to place the CAMP before checking for nukes to tell you if the spot is free or not, and the nuke is detected after the camp being placed it acts like the CAMP was there when the nuke went off.
---
Honestly, imo this is not even worth spending time to find a fix. I think Bethesda should jump directly to make repairing the CAMP free. It's just an annoyance, has no roleplay value and it has led to the nerfing and ruining of other aspects of the game.
---
I had this on me (I have my camp a little west to Settlers). I would say it is lag and you got unlucky to log in there exact time and not getting logged out fast.
---
I have this luck on SBQ. Fast travel to Drop site V9 just before bomb drop and ofc I have to be 200 yard south in the impact zone for just this time (also is it suppose to be an achievement?).
---
It's some nice advice if you want to save materials instead of having make the Fusion Generator but at least for me I was tend to make a fusion generator instead because I only been able to complete a 1 power up event so far since every other time that I have tried again the game simply crashes so I avoid the event now. 
---
I ended up having to buy my generator plans from our friendly neighborhood roaming Super Mutant Vendor.
---
Been doing that since that took away the huge amount of caps we made from the too hats. It's the perfect item cost and income wise.
---
I always have that on, saves my hot ass all the time 👍🏻
---
I don't touch it because the two times I did I fucked it up. 
---
You can't make me ruin more days.
---
That's really weird. Maybe they're actively trying to screw us over for looking up the answers online, but if that's the case fuck them. It's bad enough as it is with a bunch of questions about stuff we can't learn in-game. I'm sorry I can't be useful, hopefully your post will get spotted by someone who updates wikis and stuff.
---
I do not know if it is related or not but Today I got a mail from bethesda they have restored my missing atom points. I was not even aware that I miss one. It could be just strange.
---
Should also be a synergy with carnivore
---
I got the same email and thought so too. But all of this seemed to happen together (getting my 1st sub back as well as the email).
---
Also rare desires you can only get from eating corpses sense you can actually get this one disease from eating human flesh
---
Yeah same here didn't realize or care about outfits in my main the got the bug at and game realised now I've sold or scraped, many rare items.
---
It's easy to take for granted cause the codes are always there when you need them bit if you stop and think wow you guys do an amazing kob, please don't stop lol 👍
---
Thank you so much. This is insanely helpful
---
You're welcome! There's another one that has were you should be at daily but I don't have it on hand
---
In mine the beds refuses to spawn in and just had floating pillows everywhere.
---
No I am in vacation for 3 weeks and I have play 2 weeks
---
Is this happens after you log in shortly or is it persistent?
---
I have an issue when I log and after for 1-5 mins I do not have like anything working like I do not have marsupial no perks working etc. And when it is correctly "loaded" then it is normal.
---
Nuke one of its spawn areas, it's like a 10 percent chance to spawn. I reccomend a full team. Not as hard to kill as a Scorchbeast Queen but it spawns Wendigo spawns constantly. So having someone on constant crowd control with a fatman is a good idea, with demo expert spawns should die in 1 mini nuke. Otherwise power armor and you're good to go, just have 40 stimpaks a person and someone that can keep the aggro of the colossus on them for a while, helps a lot because itll stick to the same area and make shooting it easy.
---
Nope, they took out one more payment off me then I canceled my subscription, turns out this bug works, I have all items in game
---
Crafting the marine tactical helmet to sell is a good one.
---
I had no choice as the damn thing persisted in my inventory and kept resetting the quest each time I logged in, I allied foundation that way, faster but didn't need anything from them anyway so, no harm no foul.
---
Yep! All atom shop items are buildable and I own all
---
Thanks for the heads up.  Glad to hear it is working for you...frustrating that this is even a thing.
---
Hmm I am shifting my character to a OP gauss shotgun build and I also have a mini nuke launcher called daisy don’t know why it’s called that but thanks!
---
That's a great idea, thanks!
---
I have to say I do not know what is the exact fast kill on this one still a good job.
---
In the end the explosion is still priceless when you get surprised by it :D
---
That is exactly what I do to complete the daily challenge of buying three items from another player. I  find someone selling .38 rounds for one cap apiece, then buy three.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Yea it was. Steam and bethesda sort of kicking back and forth was the worse part. No one seemed to have the answer or was willing to work on it.
---
Dont with the gauss shotgun, they changed its damage values so you actually have to charge it to full for max damage instead of spamming it. 
---
Unless you already knew that. Either way, you can prolly solo the colossus, it's just gonna take a while. Took me and my 3 buds prolly 10 minutes and we arent really that min/maxed on stats at all. Just casual
---
Same. I log on, do my dailys, and grind xp. I miss just fucking around. I know I still can still do that. I just feel like I have to grind
---
Before u want to nerf something fix the issues in pvp first bc its a complete mess right now, also blooded builds are not work in pvp well, in pvp mostly players use broken  legacy weapons or glitched ffr weapons with stealth.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Playstation = Sony handles the money
---
Xbox = Microsoft handles the money
---
PC (steam) = valve handles the money
---
PC (Bethesda launcher) = Bethesda handles the money
---
So if you're on Playstation then yeah Bethesda won't Show membership because your membership isn't actually processed through them
---
I’ve made up my mind I want that shotgun and that’s a fair nerf that’s technically how gauss weapons should work anyway
---
You literally can't fuck up anything at this event. You either help by killing ghouls or collecting ores.
---
I don’t understand how it was even processed, haven’t had access in over a week, I’ll try giving them a chat tomorrow
---
I felt the same way but this has given me a chance to learn more about the game. I pay close attention to my SPECIAL now and what each does (learned that int buffs XP). I think this legendary event will in the end make me appreciate how you can legitimately push the boundaries with XP or using chems to do other things.
---
I felt the same way. I'm rank 78 now and I've slowed me XP grind down considerably. I've been playing through the story with an alt now.
---
Of course it's still broken.  It's a bug that hinders players and makes the game play more of a chore, which means Bethesda will take forever to fix it.   Now  if a  bug makes your life easier in any way,  Bethesda makes sure it is hot fixed within a matter of hours.
---
Yeah man I get it. I want it too but I saw the gauss minigun and went for that. Remember that demo expert boosts damage on gauss weapons.
---
Xd too mny glitch in this game rn dont expect much from pvp.
---
You can only craft weapons you buy the plans for with bullion. Not every weapon. And it is random between 1-3*
---
Post a pic.. normal? Wouldnt know dont have SH PA, prob just a visual bug
---
Timetravel.
---
The amount of bows i waste cuz of this is nuts.. ALSO the small damn hitbox of a bow
---
I had to do it by myself and I'm not very good at the game, so I just had to cripple the ghouls after letting them wreck the turrets, and ended up with only 1 survivor left as I turned in the ore in the last few seconds.
---
I’m going for the shotgun because I already put stats into shotgun perks and I researched this a lot I’ve looked up all the mutations perks locations to farm settler rep I’ve put a lot of work into this but this will take me along time maybe a couple of weeks thanks to how small the daily’s give you for rep
---
The secret service armor is very good and I would def recommend getting it.  I think you made the right choice to share the gold, the rep grind is tedious and you will accrue plenty of gold before you get to max rep for the ammo machine.  I guess it boils down to weather or not you want to buy bullion items right away.  
---
You can still buy all the settlers items when you reach ally with them.  The backpack mods from both factions are worth looking into.
---
Okie
---
So I guess I’m not the only getting insane over it
---
I usually avoid it, but some guy was trolling new players in my group by luring them into a contested workshop. Only to find out he's invincible when I try to drive him off.
---
For sure just drop it. I just do what I want when I want and I have completed nearly every SCORE naturally. Sometimes if I want to I’ll go out of my way to finish one but sometimes I don’t. The only issue this has caused is that I don’t do the “xp” grinds so I’m behind the average player. I’m at 42 SCORE at the moment but we’re “supposed to be” at 55 or something like that. Don’t care though, cause I’m still having fun and it’s not feeling like a job like so many others complain it does
---
the kids are hogging the xb atm but i can post a pic when i get on 👍🏻
---
To be honest, there really isnt much variety in terms of builds.
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
If you ever make a "mistake" while leveling up and working on your build don't worry about it once you get past Lv.50 the game gives you a choice between gaining a new Perk Card or relocating a SPECIAL stat point each time you level up so you will always have the opportunity to "fix" your build.
---
There are repeatable random encounters you can do and server hopping allows you to get them over and over again. They only add 50 points but you can do that for a bit after dailies.
---
Also I have both the shotgunner and heavy gunner perks and I'm like level 90. Trust me you wont have an issue if you decide to switch gun types. 
---
What level are you anyways? And how did you split the gold between yourself and Crater/Foundation?
---
Thank you!!
---
68 pushing 69 I chose settlers for shotgun and stealth suithalf me and half settlers
---
Yup, any Strangler sets built after Wastelanders apply the vines to all skins
---
your camp loads before you do most of the time. so by the time you got the message you base was already gone.
---
Corndogs are a good idea.
---
We can craft Razorgrain Flour, and Wild Corn is abundant as well.
---
Maybe give us a recipe for Hotdogs and then one for Corndogs.
---
Ahh crap here's to bow farming then LOL ty for the info
---
The Secret Service Armor or Gauss Pistol (for example) require a Legendary Module to craft, and it gives you 1-3 stars w/ randomized effects. 
---
otherwise you just craft regular weapons (bow, leather armor, etc)
---
Legendary versions of the regular weapons/armor can be obtained as a quest/event reward, dropped from a legendary creature, or bought from the Purveyor
---
[edit: words]
---
Not right no but along as we have enough Perk Coins to afford all of those Legendary Perks I do think that Hybrid Builds will be doable in September once Legendary Perks are implemented. 
---
At least on my end I'm looking at a potential 20 extra SPECIAL points to play around with assuming I can afford all of those Legendary Perks Cards
---
ok cool thanks for the answer  :)
---
Ohh okay awesome thank you ! :)
---
Beware, stealth suit doesnt allow for armor like the chameleon mutation unless there is something I dont know. 
---
As for the raiders, I know that there is a secondary daily quest for bringing someone queen mirelurk meat or steak, I would look it up and see if there is something like that for Settlers, it should be able to be done on top of your daily.
---
I'm thinking about crafting a second set because of that haha. Think it looks bad ass, though I'd lose my jetpack arm if I did. That's the only thing holding me back
---
So true
---
Well I haven’t really talked to anyone at the crater quest wise...
---
It's ultra slow. It keeps the focus on a enemy even when its already dead and then slowly switches to the next one. It is much faster/better to enter VATS manually for each target. Gun Fu can be especially annoying if you need to kill targets in a quick  succession like Radiation Rumble.
---
Hang on man, let me look into it via the internet and I'll give you a link that explains every possible way to gain Rep points for both sides.
---
Super awesome event! Yesterday about six people tried to talk to the person that starts the event while that person was getting in cover and shooting at one of their own turrets. We couln't start the event and the timer ran out - 10/10.
---
for melee, you need a battle cry to scream into your mic... like you yell "Spoon" or "Orange Julius!" really loud to confuse and disorient your neighbors and roomates.
---
Can I still buy stuff from crater with the bullion even if I didn’t give them the gold?
---
Well stop throwing bows at the enemy and use arrows, silly.
---
you stepped inside their invisible thunderdome
---
Considering I make more money than my mother I dont think I would do that.
---
Didnt even notice that. However i much more like the idea of hurling bows now
---
At least you're not the fucker sharing Rad Sponge and running around humping bloodied builds.
---
(looks at Leg Run board) "Zorbo's getting away!"
---

---
Claimed Workshop=pvp zone
---
Good tip. With my bloodied commando I scream die die die and that seems to work. I’ll give it a shot. Thanks
---
That would make me commit todd crimes
---
I make a point of having friends from all over the world. Back when the pts was private(before wastelanders released) , they put us all on the same two to three servers so I have friends from Japan, Russia, EU, Canada, Brazil and Australia. This is nice when I server hop for vendors. And I agree with OP Japanese players seem exceptionally respectful and nice. I ran a couple of events on their server and EVERYONE waited for people to tag legendaries and people revived each other immediately.
---
Yes of course, they shouldnt be hostile with you anymore because you gave them the inoculation, you just won't have as easy a time getting them to max reputation. 
---

I went there one time to collect nuked flora just saw a bunch of level 60 glowing ones

How about also fixing inconsistent enemy health. I love almost one shot-ing a freaking super mutant, for him to magically regain half health four times. I’m being sarcastic about loving it, it drives me nuckin futz

Nice! I’m sure ZAX will be happy to see us pushing the pyroclastic storm closer every day, and the likely reason we never hear of Appalachia again, ever so closer!
---
He's nuttier than Nutella in a Ymca locker room.
---
Sure but, have you seen the math interms of how much just max ranking one of those perks would cost? ... yikes
---
ZAX is somewhere between HAL from 2001 and AM from I Have No Mouth, but behind MODUS. AM is a paragon of psychopath AI, beating even SHODAN.
---
My camp is in Whitespring so I walk over and kill him every time I play and I've never had him glitch out, he just dies like a good wendigo. (PC)
---
Yeah I understand that 100 percent. If you ever decide to play on ps4 again they always have a sale on their ps plus at christmas, its 45 bucks for a whole year instead of 60. 
---
Best of luck to you, if there is ever something you dont know, I suggest just using the internet, you'll find it eventually. Also, I'd wait on that colossus, it's not as hard as a Scorchbeast queen, but it's no cakewalk. Get some buds together and do your best. Have fun
---
It’s no problem. I tried every possible answer and it’s just wrong every time.
---
I was doing it for 2 hours, lmao.
---
I've just started on twitch and my name is plaguedirector .  Stop by and follow and I'll do the same!

Well and also my account was hacked and I can’t log in to use online services and I’m more of a pc guy now
---
I've seen various videos that claim Revenant work with life saving legendary armor (If I'm not mistaken, it was a AngryTurtle's video on the SS jetpack), so everything that lets you revive yourself should be cool.
---
If it works, once loadouts hit I can see self-revenants becoming part of the meta, with people downing themselves with the jetpack, have the Mysterious saviour save them and then quickly changing to a more useful perk set, keeping the bonuses.
---
In the box?
---
Fucking ELF-76, whenever I get to the last few people it’s always him just walking around aimbotting.
---
Sounds like a thing you'll have to sit down and talk with Sony about. I dont really know what to say about it otherwise.
---
Yah I’ve kinda looked past that now I can still play all my great single player games just no online features
---
No do not wait untill you are ally with both. Just do both sides quests untill the "siding with" quest comes up
---
Yeah it doesnt sound that bad.
---
I’ve actively tried to model my CAMP after the mystery shack. So far... no ones got it.
---
Lucky bullet.
---
I’ve known about this feature and don’t think it suffices. I proposed a chem awhile back that would highlight corpses. A perk would work too. I feel like visual corpse pronunciation should be a built in mechanic. The camera feels a layer above fo76s gameplay
---
Bethesda you need to fix this bug instead of blaming it on the "beta".
---
People have experienced outside of being beta players. Step your game up please.
---
Yah it isn’t to bad got euro truck simulator sponsored by monster to back that up as well!
---
Kill them and go back like 15/20min later. Different enemy's and eventually the Colossus. If i see a nuke zone where noone is i get like 50 stable flux every nuke. 99% of the players leave after the sbq. My best run was almost 150 stable but that was WS
---
Doing the final quest for one Faction makes it available for the other, but there is a definite point of no return. It also offers a huge rep boost. After it is complete, you can still accrue rep with both factions, theoretically maxing it out with both and having full access to their inventory.
---
We've detected some...vermin 🤗
---
Dont speak like 50 days its alot, from 60 if you only do challanges you wont be able to lvl up once a day...
---
Okay so i should do untill the last quest with both, wait untill im maxed rep with both then pick a side? I want to side with settlets cause karma, i lile being the good guy but really want the gauss guns, can i get both?
---
Watch it, it's fun!
---
Yah I get a lot of stable flux bu going to those zones
---
Oh nice. That in itself sounds like a good time
---
This is actually amazing... By the way, there’s an actual fire place in the atomic shop for really cheap right now that you could use.
---
I just want to make sure we’re talking about the same game death stranding right?
---
Do not wait untill max rep. If you wait that long you lose out on a bunch of gold
---
Go untill the last quest with both and then do the raid.
---
Well.. How to describe it. Everytime it procs (alot) you get a bullet hitting metal (PA) sound and a longish sound of well.. bullet ricocheting. It's kinda cool at first but atleast for me, got annoying fast :D
---
Not sure what your saying. But the gave us back the missing atoms from challenges. You should get an email about it.
---
It’s more weird that I got an extra 200 even when I wasn’t missing any, lmao.
---
I thought you actually meant a euro truck simulator. But yes death stranding makes perfect sense at the same time. Honestly I forget that game exists sometimes. While it is a very good game, I've seen how tedious it gets with the constant hauling of shit on foot across the fuckin country.
---
I say any score points we get after reaching 100 should be banked and we could use them in the next season.
---
Honestly love the whole “dead spirits cause invisible monsters and huge explosions
---
Thats because there are certain players on all platforms who seem to possess the Ark of the Covenant and unleash its power every time the Scorch Queen turns up...
---
Doesn’t adictol cure all addictions?
---
Try waiting it out, about 5 mins. This is not a long term viable fix but this sounds a bit like the respawn bug when you die at the the end of an event, which you can wait out to get your loot
---
That is a great idea.
---
Don't forget about the bug... that... after you're through the i-have-95%-hit-chance-but-i-miss-95%-of-the-shots you'll face the problem that IF you hit, the enemy does not loose HP!
---
It appears often (to me) that when i finally hit the enemy through VATS, that my shots clearly HIT (you can see AND hear it) but the enemy does not loose a single HP. Sometimes it takes 3 to 4 hits straight to the face until a shot gets recognized and the enemy dies. 
---
This most likely happens to me when the enemy is a one-shot (like ghouls etc.). Really annoying
---
I actually just found this wiki [article](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Revenant). It states in the Notes section that it does indeed work with Mysterious Savior. Gonna test it out for myself tomorrow.
---
Might be a bit difficult since downing yourself and reviving will have you at more than 20% health.. and if Bloodied is still the meta (most likely will be) it's gonna be a bit difficult to maintain. Revenant only lasts for 2 minutes as well.
---
I will check it out.
---
I've noticed up to 10 points difference in special stats at times. it changes every log in. if I un-equip it all and re-equip it all I get my stats and damage back. I also have a damage bug where the numbers come up yet there's no damage done. Il shoot a supermutant for vats shot of 2132 damage and not a scratch. vats head shot again for the same numbers and no scratch. manual aim an shoot in the stomach for 900 and they dead. only been happening since double xp started.
---
That's because you need it. I've probably rolled 7 unyielding pieces but I wanted chameleon. Haven't gotten a useable one of those. I'm using a vanguard with sneak and AP refresh so I can't really complain, but that was like my 70th roll.
---
1) scrappy is good. 
---
2) if you need a more compact vertical option in the mean time, you can stack the stairwells with the four posts directly on top of one another, creating a compact stairwell with access to each floor. 
---
-Place first stair case. 
---
-Place a support beam (found under stairs tab) on it. 
---
-Stack a second beam on top of the first. 
---
-Remove the first beam, leaving the second one floating. 
---
-Put in next stairs directly on top ofnthe other (just make sure your stairs alternate directions because you can stack them so one set of stairs blocks the one below it). 
---
-Rinse and repeat for however many floors you need.
---
I would take the Gatling Gun, You on Ps4?
---
i'm lvl 150 but still don't have a decent weapon yet.
---
Just bring toxic goo from West Tek with you and you can adjust rads on the fly. 
---
But since it does require some extensive preparations It'll probably just be done by people who want to kill the SBQ in less than 4 hits though.
---
Oh yes.. noticed this a lot at Radiation Rumble over the DXP weekend.. using a furious handmade, stealth commando, with drum mag just for R,R + 3* in Gun-fu and sometimes a whole 30 round clip would miss 🥴 ..damn all that missed XP
---
That but is pretty easy to work with tho. 
---
Place 2 pillars. Remove one. Add next stair. Rinse. Repeat.
---
Me too, I watched the first few hours of the game on youtube but lost interest because it was very repetitive and while I could enjoy it while playing it, I didnt like watching it.
---
\*loads up YouTube link\*  
---
This better be Rotomon!  
---
Yay, Rotomon! =)
---
Vault Dweller, in the flesh – or, rather, in the Secret Service armour. I took the liberty of relieving you of your weapons. Most of them were Enclave property. As for the armour, I think you've earned it. The edge region, Cranberry Bog, is in our control, for the time being … thanks to you. Quite a nasty piece of work you managed over there, I am impressed. That's why I'm here, Mr. Dweller. I have recommended your services to my … superiors, and they have authorized me to offer you a job. They agree with me that you have limitless potential. You've proved yourself a decisive man so I don't expect you'll have any trouble deciding what to do. If you're interested, just step into the vertibird and I will take that as a yes. Otherwise, well … I can offer you a battle you have no chance of winning; rather an anticlimax after what you've just survived. Time to choose …
---
[upon choosing to go in the vertibird] Wisely done Mr. Dweller! I will see you up ahead.
---
[upon "refusing" his offer] Well, it looks like we won't be working together. [The player is teleported in front of an army of T-Posing ghouls.] No regrets, Mr. Dweller…
---
Better atmosphere when playing and lugging around 10 pounds of medicine and then peas right outside of the city boarder to stick it to the man
---
What's that? O.o
---
Happy cake day
---
Lmao, I did like the aspect of getting to just piss wherever because while it doesnt actually annoy the npcs, you can still think it does.
---
Yeah, I have an instigating fixer with FFR and FR.  I'd probably trade it for flux and ammo, but it's just too difficult.   I wouldn't drop first nor would I use a courier now that I'm off FB (no way to verify that the courier is legit).   So it sits in my stash.   Maybe someday I'll use it.   The other problem would be value.   How do you ever determine a fair value?
---
I won't sell for caps because that 30K limit is a constant problem.   I have bought nearly every (cap) plan in the game.  The only things left are the T power armor plans.
---
I wish there were a trade box where both parties could put items, check off that they want the trade to proceed, and then both parties could get their items.
---
Riding Shotgun is a perfect place to find plasma weapons to scrap as well.
---
Same here unless it's someone I've known for months and they've proven themselves reliable.
---
What should I say in said ticket
---
Who would have 600 flux they'd be willing to part with?
---
I’ve noticed this recently too, first couple of cats shots miss then a hit.
---
I was hoping for a star themed ceiling paper, really a lot if missed opportunities this Season.
---
The real life inspiration for the mega sloth is the standard sloth, bro.
---
They just made it big and put mushrooms on it.
---
LMFAO, why didn't I think of this instead my brain thought that the quest would have like some kidnapped kid with a big raid to save him or something lol
---
And uhh spoilers i guess for lore, but he did decide to gas the wnclave members he had in the bunkers because they wouldn't stop fighting
---
Bethesda staff don't have ceilings in their real world properties so they have no idea what we are talking about.
---
Doesn't help if the camera is pointing arm a  pearly empty patch of dirt, and you realize the legendary you just fought to kill is under the ground. Again.
---
Please add a patch that fixes glitched achievements people spent literal weeks grinding for
---
Faction flags already in game.
---
They are settlers and raiders dlc in the ps/Xbox store
---
I passed a fan at the local Big box store and almost picked it up for the screws!
---
That would be AMAZING! Please suggest this as a post so I can upvote.
---
Only one for damage I know is bloody mess.
---
Aren't you a rifle build?  That's a heavy weapon
---
Farming events for legendaries and notes helps with the level up
---
And Riding Shotgun but I haven't seen it in awhile
---
Yea I mean wall flags
---
Assuming you only play 1 hour a Day, that repeatble does not help alot
---
I think you should have killed him.  It would have taken seconds.   It isn't about whether the kill is challenging.  It's about teaching him to not be so f\* annoying and weird.
---
Or, alternatively, server hopped.   Guy like that could be bait?
---
Whats vault 88?
---
Im a yes man when it comes to modus. He gives me money and makes me smile.
---
Might be glitched healing mutation. Ive had it glitch where im invincible and it doesnt stop refilling. Other times it doesnt proc at all
---
Pacifist mode
---
Thank you ;-)
---
You speak many truths.
---
Persistent. 
---
I have logged in and out multiple times, and restarted the whole game. X Box One, btw.
---
Do you know if the damage numbers show up properly when someone attacked you? When I was fighting the person, they were reading only 0's
---
Last week someone killed Berry, my sloth I sad, and don't know if I should get another friend
---
Lol. Comment above from Willy Wonka.
---
It may have happened if you choose the wrong option in speech checks.
---
E.g if you tell the Raiders to go atrack Foundation in speech, it has a negative affect on your Settler level reducing it.
---
Done anything like that?
---
I dont remember that detail to be honest. Sorry
---
I think the assaultron would be awesome and if not I want the insult bot at my camp. Also I want a dog like dogmeat from fo4
---
sorry double post
---
It's cool. I'm not sure if they ever patched the god mode glitch from last year, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is something like it. 
---
Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for my curiosity about new glitches people abuse.
---
i don't have a build, i just have fun killing things, doing quests etc.
---
I've done a silo once and figured out the code manually (didn't get to use it as some other players came along at the last minute and stole the launch, but that's another story).
---
I enjoyed the decoding, but I didn't enjoy the repeated fast travelling back to Whitesprings to find another code piece location before going out to kill it. More loading screens and running through an empty bunker than actual game play!
---
Happy days, miss playing new vegas.
---
Nice work!
---
I have a normal one and ace the raider, and i can set ace to still collect scrap and junk, id assumed that the more you the more modes you can set any of them too, but they just limit you to one (unless you claim a workshop and put one)
---
The problem is that each collectron is an NPC, and in Bethesda games every NPC has a fairly heavy (and mostly useless) AI package, that places a lot of stress on the engine, more so in this online game.
---
This is why you never see actual cities in any of BGS games, not even the Imperial City in Oblivion was that much of a city. Other games handle the issue in different ways, for example by creating crowds that are effectively a single NPC guided by a single AI package, but for some reason this and any variation is something BGS simply refuses to do.
---
I need a perk to find legendary exploding robot bodies.
---
Thanks for answer :)
---
If you're on PS I've probably got a few spare if you need em to craft something :) just message me, Hornium
---
sell the non scrip weapons and armor, plus unused ammo, magazines, bobbleheads, mutation serums and plans with actual value in my vendors
---
sell the excess aid and grenades to robot vendors (easy sell out the 1400 caps a day on 2 chars)
---
when close to cap limit, buy another mutation serum recipie, add to vendor, and sales will go up
---
the issue is I'm makin to much caps and running out of stuff to buy xd
---
Edit: non leggy weapons and armor u donts sell, scrap em and add em to your scrap box, once u get to a certain lvl u better have the weightless mats in your scrapbox than extra caps wich would bring you over caps limit again, same with selling maths, in the beginning its nice to sell maths in your vendors for extra caps, but I stopped that long ago
---
Yeah you get it man, that’s the feeling I’m on about true apocalypse like I am legend!
---
Totally agree with the rockstar recipe as well, even the character part where they make the main character for the story and then you make your own characters for online. 
---
Imagine playing Talos as a young lad to the end Ooft! Cutscenes like that ESO cinematic trailer. 
---
Meanwhile I’m sprinting/ fast travelling everywhere as a Mute wood elf or a junky vault dweller absolutely smashing the Courier/Slayer sector of Tamriel and Post apocalyptic America, with load screens for cutscenes lol
---
It shouldn't be a perk imho, but a drugs or a beverage. You use it, then it will make you able to see the corpses like the "detect dead" spell in Skyrim.
---
Funniest suggestion post to grace this subreddit
---
Do the main quest line until you have both quests “siding with crater” and “siding with foundation” so you get all the perks like Chinese stealth armor and everything, then make your choice. DO NOT wait until max rep it makes no difference who you side with you can still get max rep with both factions after the vault raid. You want to get it done so you can start getting gold bullion for the end game weapons and armor
---
Buy them from other players. I rarely use power armor so I sell most of my cores, like many other players do.
---
"The challenge refuses to complete, I can't get the atoms". Also, make a screenshot of the challenge window with said challenge. They'll get in touch with you in couple days.
---
Max rank of cannibalism would be cool! *highlights corpses* or a new one like *scent of flesh* ‘you get an erect penis, your mouth begins to drool and all corpses within 30yrds are highlighted’
---
For those wondering, it's basically a translation for AngryTurtles video about Herbivores.
---
It happens. Just look away while our maxhine overlords fix this small issue.
---
New player who got the game on the steam sale just slightly before legendary run. It's really unfortunate that I was having more fun before the dailies, but a lot of those rewards are really helpful for a new player leveling a character. I wouldn't mind doing the dailies if they didn't take an entire play session to complete leaving me no time to play the actual game.
---
Yes, you need to have completed "The Lowe-down" for you to have a [10% chance](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P20&amp;formids=0046D296-0046D29A) of receiving it.
---
The way MODUS talks fucks me right off. The way he pauses at the second last word of every second sentence sounds like a brain damaged news anchor having a..... stroke.
---
A log cabin version of the contemporary house bundle would sell quite well. There are a lot of building pallets they could make that would sell but they don't. 
---
We can only hope they release one in the future
---
Ok ima just save this comment when i can get a screenshot of all these bugged challenges
---
but then we would be having fun, you should know better.
---
I don’t think there’s a “super” reputation bar, maybe you leveled up to the next tier and didn’t realize it.
---
Fallout 4 DLC
---
I totally agree, if there was no end date and you could just complete them in your own time all would be fine, it would just be another layer of gameplay, but adding a limited amount of time has totally changed the games dynamics.
---
Why not just add it to the cannibal perk?
---
Hey may I ask what do u need that Flux for?
---
Do the main questline with both sides (EVERY possible quest until theres no more) and then side with who you wanna side with, waiting for max rep would be silly now
---
Oh is that the one where you can build a new settlement in the unfinished vault?
---
I’d just pour mut fruit juice on him irl
---
Sure is!
---
Decontamination arc. All prime receivers AND the ultracite ammo. Best power armor mods etc
---
I have yet to find one :(
---
You might want to check your credit card statement and make sure you don't have multiple FO 1st subscription charges.
---
It’s only really started happening in the last few days. Has there been an update pushed out recently?
---
Correct. Even if they bring back atom daily/weekly challenges between seasons, if you’ve already finished the current season, you won’t be getting any rewards for those challenges until then
---
A behemoth consistently spawns in that lake, I'm sure it's just south of foundation, after following a dirt road down the mountain.. check it out regularly!
---
I think we would make great teammates... nothing brings me greater joy than my teammates complaining that they tried to jump but ate a body instead. Cannibal perk forever!
---
Omg thankyou  !!! So many people have said use camera mode (thinking generic photo mode) I never realised they meant use the actual damn camera 🤣🤣
---
Okay, thanks!
---
Its an ongoing issue thats been around for most of the games life. Not sure if its a ps4 issue or not. I play on ps4 and see it only once in a blue moon.
---
That's the reason I stayed away from gauss rifles and went into strength tree at launch. You'd think a gun as cool looking as a gauss rifle would be at least viable. Nope
---
Yes it does help. It tells you that you can stop looking. You can’t loot it.
---
That fireplace got me
---
Wait. This sounds like Bloodhound from Apex Legends.
---
There's a blood Eagle camp right next to it which is the closest spawn location for it. The lake is south of it I think (without being on the game to check)
---
They'd probably rather monetize fixer skins separately at some point.
---
I'd like a skin that makes it look nothing like the fixer tbh
---
A bit like the awesome new paint for the handmade, I dont mind skins that change the entire model of the gun at all aslong as we do see brand new weapons every now and then.
---
I got an email, and it has a typo in the subject line.
---
Nope. None. Been killing lots of those raiders though
---
Yeah same, building in 76 is so incomplete
---
Sadly I’ve come to grow bored with fallout because of this. 
---
I could ignore earning atoms, but now if I ignore SCORE I won’t get the items that I ‘do’ want on the board.
---
They should’ve made it an actual SCORE board to pick and choose what we wanted, instead of this one path BS. I could care less for a clean sink that gives dirty water, a broken down kids playground, a cage in a tree, ghillie stuff, or lunchboxes galore (when I could care less about my level when it doesn’t matter past 50 anyways).
---
Straight up after the ban wave I rewarded Bethesda with $50 and bought a bunch of levels.  I’m now at 92.  I missed a week of the season on a camping trip. $50 every 2-3 months and all those worries about score go away.
---
Another one to my collection
---
Gracias
---
If they did this then they need to also add a color picker to the settings - I'm color blind and red and green would just make it even harder for me.
---
I think that's an amazing idea honestly.
---
The only issue is it wouldnt make sense for things you can't eat like bots, but I don't care if it doesn't make sense I like the idea.
---
Behemoth Bathtub
---
ah yes, even more proof the pint sized slasher will return
---
Everyone should learn how to, and launch, at least once, by solving it yourself. I did this on my first nuke and it made it extremely satisfying. It really doesn't take much work and hunting down the code pieces from the officers can be fun, and if you wait until the end of the week you will usually narrow to one possible solution.
---
Ooo the insult bot would be a great C.A.M.P item
---
If you joined the BOS (entertaining but not enjoyable quest), you can take the elevator to the 3rd or 4th floor. There are benches on both. If you're not a member, you'll have to walk it.
---
Agreed, I have lost many bodies, including legendaries. Why do we need it to be a perk? Just highlight them.
---
Share what you want, just not Sun Kissed while a bloodied player(s) are on your team.
---
That's all, really. I even ask politely and explain why*.
---
I only ever hear Americans or some stupid sounding overly passive Brit asking for copper it’s like go mine it son 🤷‍♂️
---
I visited a camp on that lake the other day and he was stooped over in the water not moving and he didnt detect like an enemy would so I assumed he was dead. I strolled down to the shore to check out some skeletons etc and the fucker sprang to life while my back was turned. Nearly jumped out my chair :/
---
Mod armor/gun/PA also can be done by applying a paint and removing it until you hit 76.
---
We also need some kind of warning alarm that a robot is going to explode. 80% of the time they don’t, and sometimes even after waiting a while they still explode.
---
[It's still applicable ](https://youtu.be/GIL9srAp_Oo)
---
Too bad Beckett doesnt buy stuff too
---
'tato-morter?
---
Correct.
---
But small gestures count man
---
I understand that as a fellow bloodied build
---
Anything from from ww1 and 2 would sell like hot cakes
---
As someone who's currently running a heavy weapons/explosive build. I understand, and am often the cause of, this problem in NORMAL places. (Sorry not sorry)
---
Because they're different weapons.
---
Those government aid drop holotapes have a limit of 255. You get a unhelpful error when you try to loot another when you are at the limit. Knowing this, there could be a limit on treasury notes.
---
Haha yeah, he likes to sit and chill there, had to take a photo for the challenge and didnt even realise it was a legendary before he started glowing green lol, behold the result
---
Well, if you don’t enjoy grinding Score, simply don’t do it. Just by playing casually or taking a little step left and right you will complete the majority of challenges anyway. And it’s also not you will miss out on something really great if you don’t finish the board.
---
On the other hand, if there is something on the board that you really want for some reason, well, then you have to put some effort into getting it.
---
It’s just like life in general…
---
Yesterday I was trying it out and it still boosted the damage I did with meat hook. I tried it on those rad corpses and first hit for around 8k and second hit around 10k damage. It's too much of a boost to be from the (stacking damage perk, can't remember the name). So it must have been 20% from the unarmed perk. I also saw increase in raw damage on the weapon. I might post pictures once I get home from work.
---
Were you using vats?
---
It's not always that easy
---
Sometimes the body has flown through the air and landed somewhere. . You don't always know the general area within a 2m radius of the body. Bodies roll downhill. There are slopes, holes, gullies.
---
Ah, Bethesda at it's finest. They probably programmed in 5 choices but the system only shows 4 and the right answer is the missing one.
---
I think modus is a collective AI, Modus was damaged if you go in his room you can see a lot of his cores (AI) are damaged (red) the working ones are blue
---
I think that's the reason he has impered judgement.
---
But I don't know when the damaged happened precisely
---
Imagine a level 110 Deathclaw Queen that has anti-armor that cries for more deathclaws
---
Not sure if this is still relevant, but there was a discussion on it a while ago.

---
Nice kill my man
---
this, you will have to grind gold for 3 - 4 months depending how much of the stuff you want,  even if you don't finish the quest lines it's only 2 months of doing the dailies to hit ally which you only need for gauss minigun, shotgun, pistol.  The rest is available right away from the quest line
---
lol now it makes sense 😉
---
if u want to trade for a god roll, u need to be trading up
---
keep the most valuable unused guns in your stash and try and trade em up, like 2 or 3 (or more...) of yours for 1 better gun, then save that one and collect others to trade up again, thats how it works for now
---
Example: I traded for a B2525 CR, for that trade I handed over 3guns, my B5015 Railw, TSE15 Railw, and a 3th heavy gun I dont remember, so I gave em 3 guns for 1, but was still happy, since I use it all the time and dont have the extra guns in my stash weighing me down, 
---
I use FED76 as an indicator, so I dont use the values that it states (like if it says that its a 5-10k gun i will probably put it in my stor for 1.5 - 2k or something) But I do use it as an indication of values when I'm trading guns, like if your trading 3 guns with min values of 10k, 15k, 15k =40k for 1 gun that is about 40k min value, thats a worthwhile trade
---
selling good guns for caps is not an option, because most of em are worth more than cap limit, and even if it was a 15k gun or something, I still wouldnt put it in my vendor since I make like 10k a day from other sales and am always close to the limit
---
but yeah trading is not without risks, luckelly I've always had the luck to trade with honest people and didnt get scammed, and have build trust with those people so with some I have traded often, but its always risky to be dropping your valuable stuff in the hopes he does the same
---
best thing would be that Beth added a trading window where both partys can put in their stuff, and both have to confirm afterwards before the trade goes through to avoid scamming, but knowing Beth, its gonna have issues
---
TLDR: yes trading is difficult, buth worthwhile if u want dem god rolls
---
Yes, I translated  it for my german vault dwellers.
---
You can't revive someone threw pvp. Have them jump off a cliff
---
Oops. I've just killed like 5 innocent people who probably thought I was trolling 😬
---
I'm not sure if it's random chance or based on the size of the damage but randomly you will just die instead of being in a help state.
---
go to the encryptid event, someone will eventually die, and They'll emote a panicking vaultboy. run over to them and stimpak them.
---
No and I wasn't using a handmade. It  was pretty laggy, but the damage numbers read 0 each time I got hits.
---
2 options I would suggest
---
1. Have them jump off a building or have them do something that will just give them small amounts of damage until they get downed(and not killed of course).
---
2. The other simple, and probably easier way is just go to a scorched earth(or encrypted) event. The number of people that get downed can range quite a bit but there's usually always someone. Take that chance and just rush over to revive them.
---
perception perks should be full of find this or that perks , not just double meat or flowers, or noises when near X
---
Why not something like Perceptibobble?
---
Do the SBQ event, plenty of people need reviving there lol
---
Blackpowder Lodge store inside of Whitesprings has the walls as interior as well! The assets are in the game, why don't they monetize it?
---
Could this be a server latency thing? I sometimes see an enemy not lose health, then they lose some health, then they regain some health again. It's almost like the health stat is kept locally but is updated through the server every tic or something. And if the latency is off, then the health update gets weird.
---
Thank you! Thats the last one I needed to complete.
---
I hope bethesda don't think it's too easy due to posts like this, because it isn't.  I've no idea how someone grinds to 100 already without spending atoms.  I'm at 54 and play every day.
---
With Wastelanders coming back to Appalachia, everyone will want to set up a place like foundation
---
I'd already be satisfied with beth fixing the prefabs so that those are placeable on uneven terrain.
---
Could not had said it better
---
Im guessing what they break when "fixing" adrenaline...
---
Yep, I jumped from 200something to 700something, nice! I immediately bought the floorboard foundation. Finally I have something different from cement or those square colored tiles.
---
He has mind control powers but always spawns solo

Can do it in private server if you prefer and show you all the little things. just ask / pm.
---
I’d be happy if they let my camp perimeter almost touch my neighbours so collectively we could build large settlements.

Didn't they have to be revived in water or am I thinking of something else?

Something called 'serums' i think the one your talking about is called Marsupial Serum for jump height and speed demon for movement speed. If you drink it, you will get the benefits. It also gives you -4 intelligence. But in order to keep the mutation you will need a perk card equipped called 'starched genes' this will have to be level 2 so you wont lose the mutation by taking radaway
---
I think an easy solutions to this would to let Berry Mentats work on corpses of living creatures. The biological process doesn't just stop, and bodies don't turn instantly cold.
---
yeap. part of the fun in fallout is that each player had their own fallout. each would play their way at their pace.
---
now we have only one fallout. beths version. and most people are not enjoying.
---
Bethesda has addressed the issue and is going to fix the missing atoms, see my edited post update 2.
---
Thank you !

I like my handmade more. I had both B2525 fixer and B2525 handmade at the same time and handmade feels better. There is only 6-7% difference in DPS in favour of The Fixer.
---
No problem. You can buy it from Modus for 5,000 caps or some player venders sell between 200-500 caps
---
Welp.. there's a certain terminal in the modus bunker that actually proves your theory. It did however claim that the way to wake up from the simulation was to nuke some village in China or something.
---
Plus high agility and or unyeilding armor, plus certain charisma perks will let you run like Usain bolt on crack for a long time.
---
All great until you try and start a new character and feel like a toddler trying to run and jump in a kiddie pool full of molasses.
---
Ah shit. You're right. Wonder how rockstar got away with it.
---
Long live Swan 🤙
---
I’m genuinely confused as to who uses serendipity.
---
Mistress of mysteries smoke grenades probably
---
That is so true
---
I wish they would tone down the gloss on a lot of things.
---
this.  While it's possible to down someone in pvp making them eligible to be revived you can't then stim them when they are hostile.
---
You could prolly do it by pvp -&gt; down -&gt; squad up in a team with downed player real fast (downed player has a public team up ideally to make it fast) then stim but that's a fuckton harder than just having someone jump off a tall building or a cliff.
---
Is cranberry relish really called cranberry "sauce"? Did my year 7 German lead me astray?
---
Once you hit around level 30 or 35 you can get a perk card called starched genes so you can get mutations and radaway won’t get rid of them. The two most popular ones are probably marsupial mutation which increased jump height and carry weight and speed demon that makes you run and reload your guns 20% faster. They’re a must have for this game but every mutation has a downside, you’re gonna want class freak perk card so you’ll negate 75% of the negatives. I run about 7 mutations which might be overkill but it’s fun to try all of them

I just tested it and it does seem to work. Not sure if weapon, damage, or what factors may apply a difference but here's what I did and what I observed:
---
1. Lowered my health down to a little under half(max is 270).
---
2. Using a medic's combat shotgun, I killed a level 62 ghoul in 1 shot using crit.
---
3. There seemed to be about a 1\~2 second delay before any healing applied.
---
4. IIRC, it might have been server lag but healing used to be almost an instant heal instead of a high healing over time(took less than half a second, it was like I ate cooked SB meat or such)
---
I'm probably the only one that actually really loves solving the codes myself and takij the gamble if i got it right
---
For me, it's made it better. The game itself became too much of a grind and burned me out. At this point, it's kind of a choice between not playing at all or no longer caring so much. I decided on the latter, and logging in for a half hour to an hour every day with some music or video in the background and just going through challenges has been relaxing. Only at rank 43, I don't know if I will finish in time and don't really care, it's more of just a thing to do than a grind due to that
---
It would be nice if it would work the same way as with PA-s and use the core with the lowest charge first.
---
Never tried it
---
Clean toilet/dirty water dispenser
---
pc ps4 xbone?
---
Yes, I'm missing 600+. I went in depth while reporting it, and had a back and forth with Bethesda. Screenshots, times, calculations and all. It seems to be specifically effecting Steam users.
---
Well, people come to the event for a reason. It's either run around shooting fireflies or sit there for 3 minutes and then kill the toads. The people who don't want to do anything in the event usually just join a few minutes after it starts instead of going there immediately and then staring at the floor for those few minutes
---
not bad.  I'm confident it could be done much faster with a full health build using a legacy as you wouldn't need to stealth at all, just sprint to all the pylons and then murder the ISS in less than 5 seconds.
---
But still any solo kill of ISS is respectable.
---
Go to Solomon’s Pond next to foundation and follow the road a little south east until you see another little unmarked pond, the behemoth is mostly submerged in the water so you’ll just see a shopping cart popping out of the middle of the water.
---
The flair gun could shoot UV flairs that highlight blood like the CSI shows, could highlight legendaries blood more/different. Or UV flash/pipboy light.
---
I’ll trade flux and drop it first.   If you are on Xbox that is
---
I think it happens when another player has used an energy weapon and turned the enemy into an ash or goo pile.
---
you need to play with it. you will appreciate the versatility this suit offers. nothing like it.
---
rad rumble, SBQ in blast zone, blast zone farming, silo runs, etc.
---
run barbarian, ironclad, evasive. add elusive and sneak 2, with a silenced weapon. game is too easy
---
I am 1 for 1 at getting scammed. But oh well
---
I did this one with another player by going to Flatwoods, unequipping all armor and protection/health related perk cards.  I stood in the river until my health was almost gone, then I got up on the bridge and jumped into the river, which put me in a state where the other player was able to revive me, so they also got the revive in water challenge done.  We then switched over, so I could get the challenge completed.
---
I'm noticing this issue more with my handmade than any other weapon, and in Radiation Rumble it's most noticeable. I switched to my bloodied 10mm smg and it was significantly better. My handmade also reloadsby itself after 15 shots when it should be 30 so, that's fun too.
---
I totally disagree, rep takes way longer to get than gold so you should always split the gold. You can get 500 gold in one day so it’s not worth it for such a small amount
---
Oh I get it now, you can't read lol. I never said NW wasn't acknowledged.. But it's clearly given the wrong kind of attention. Agree with me and still call me stupid if you want... But It's a pvp mode full of non-pvp casuals and if you don't think that's an issue then that explains alot.
---
Sorry, on PC, does that make a difference, separate servers?
---
Really, I didn't know that, so it's a bug.
---
Workshop pvp is the only pvp available really. So anyone who wants pvp will go and fight you over it
---
I got an email about this earlier, and hilariously the subject has a typo "Fallout 76 Mssing Atoms".  I thought it was a spam email or misdirected support ticket, but nope, they actually sent out probably hundreds of thousands of emails where they didn't even spell the subject line right.
---
Ok if you want it that is fine 
---
Do you have a scrip fodder 3 star weapon to swap for it?
---
Cooking them should yield more cashh tho
---
Then maybe they need to add 1v1 and 4v4 arena's to the game. Maybe Raider themed in the Savage divide. It just seems like a poor design decision to force PVP content in a largely PVE Workshop concept.
---
If you're on ps4, I could probably hook you up with both a marsupial and speed demon serum. Though, I would suggest to have starched genes(take off the perk before drinking them, otherwise you've just wasted them) before taking them so you don't end up with a combination of mutations you don't want or lose the ones you want to keep.
---
I love the ghoul tree

Just to check, you know you can not just run but sprint?
---
Why do I always have a surplus of high radiation fluids but can never find the hardened mass that I need?
---
Thank you so much!
---
Megacool imma try this
---
Ash piles have caused problems since fallout 3. Don’t expect them to fix this anytime soon.
---
I’m on pc so I’m guessing it won’t work, although I really appreciate you offering it!
---
I knew someone would comment this ffs
---
Oh hey, I had completely forgotten about that crap. Good point. Best to store those atoms though as the value of each increase in rank increases as you move along the board. Atoms are going to be a savior towards the end.
---
I saw a bunch of grenade icons so that makes sense. Anyone have any ideas what the box trick was?
---
Bloodied/Unyielding builds, mostly. When you're constantly at 20% max hp, Serendipity becomes a very important (Albeit mechanically unreliable) method of defense.
---
After FO4 bethesda is so lazy with the ballistic weapons. I hate that, and the players should demand for actual weapons instead of skins without even proper animations... Of course everyone knows that and it won't happen.
---
Mutations
---
Right? People always find something to complain about...then whine about it on this subreddit.
---
What glitch
---
Technically, relish translates to Würzsoße, but that sounds even dumber.
---
I’m German but I play all my games in English because I can’t deal with most translations as they’re almost all literal translations and either make no sense or sound incredibly dumb. 
---
That’s not an option for everyone, though.
---
I’m a junkie heavy as I feel like bloodied builds are going to be nerfed hard soon, but I kinda see what you mean
---
You need a stimpack to revive them. 
---
Have them jump off a high height vs trying to shoot them down.
---
The only stove that actually looks like a modern stove is the one under appliances and cant actually be used to cook. But you can pop that little pot on the metal grate on top of it and wala

Excellent thread
---
I'm amazed that they haven't just made the watoga arena into a pvp activity yet lol
---
I am in the process of making a shotgun vats build and noticed this last night.  Shit needs to get fixed.
---
I really enjoyed figuring it out for myself when I dropped my very first nuke, lost a little of that joy perhaps now in the rinse and repeat cycle of drop 3 and hop... Back in the day we used to drop 1 random on 3, drop 3 simultaneously etc.
---
For me,it was the nukagirl outfit.  My companion looks sexy af in it.
---
Most is cosmetics but you can get different collectrons which find different things for you. You can also get scrap and repair kits which as low level might be worth getting the repair kits if you’ve not got the right scrap to repair at a work bench.
---
Also if you are doing the legendary run then you can use them to level up for that.
---
Would it allow us to add floors to each stop without stairs?
---
Want the welcome Matt functionality back so bad, my camp is this crazy silent hill experience where you go into a seemingly normal house and end up In a nightmare world that goes downward way deeper than the house itself.  
---
But the dam cliff the camps built on is facing the wrong way so people spawn in behind the main house so they end up by the back structure with no clear way to enter and some just can't be bothered to find the entrance.
---
Need them to spawn on the south side so bad to really perfect the experience. 
---
I refuse to move my camp because it's also a random assault spawn point trigger. Has helped me to gather rep, legendaries, and cryptids as every time I spawn back in from a bit of adventuring something interesting spawns in.
---
Had one day where 4 sheepsquatch spawned in fighting settlers or raiders.
---
Especially helps to speed up the score grind.
---
Every single cryptid type has spawned in there at one point or another.
---
Apart from the acid nodes at Hemlock Holes I never set up a workshop for resources I sneak in, claim the workshop and get out fast, never return to defend etc. Resource machines at these workshops have such a low output to be annoying and pretty useless. The fusion core generators at power stations are OK, but they WILL get contended.
---
Yesterday I rolled through the map and claimed 14 workshops then just did events and camp stuff. It is doable you were just unlucky. Always sneak/squat in and out fast.
---
Why do you keep getting killed by high level players? Unless you start pvp they can't hurt you. Turn in pacifist mode
---
Yes you really need to by cautious about these. You even get a disclaimer that player can take / defend it wich results in pvp.
---
_____
---
I do take them for other player but not from low level Players (like under 70) since that would be mean.
---
The best thing you can do is put in all sneak perks and use a Stealth suit while standing on the edge of the Zone ( so if you spot a player you can run out before he tries to take it). All player you see near your workshop will probably try to murder you.
---
____
---
Hope this was a help.
---
What system are you playing on.  Xbox players tend to help out lower level players.  Make sure that you have pacifist turned on
---
A lot of things would be a no brainer yet here we are.
---
Yes or some kind of endgame hord event.
---
Oh yeah I am trying to do the legendary run, is the legendary run time limited like an event or is it always there ? So I know if I should use atoms to rush it or not
---
Still my fave go to weapon, I have the Fixer plan but until I'm lucky to get a Legendary version I'll stick with my HM..I haven't had the reload bug but..get this! I have had it happen twice now, when at the SBQ when quickly changing over from my Furious .50 cal to my HM I've got the remaining .50 bullet number in my HM  mag, once over 200 rounds .. reloading after empty took it back to normal but it was giggle 😂 just glad I had the rounds left to enjoy it✌️
---
I haven't played TES much, but since enemies can be ashed in Skyrim as well, this bug, like many others with Bethesda, has a chance of existing since Morrowind.
---
I’m a new player and only played about 4 hours so far cause literally only just brought the game, how long on average do I need to play to be able to launch nukes ?
---
It’s on for 10 weeks, unsure what week we are on at the mo, think it’s 4 but maybe wrong? And levelling up at the start is easy so I wouldn’t use them just yet for that but maybe last week if you’ve got any left then you could use them. Think it’s 150 atoms a level.
---
God, never gonna understand why he thinks that’s a good idea.
---
And I will rightfully complain about it if it's release as is but as it stands now they have about another 7 weeks to change it.
---
I would personally cut all requirements by 1/2 , introduced a weekly challenge that gives more perk coins, add a 30% chance that instead of bubble gum you get a perk coin everything time you open a Perk Pack, and for Legendary Run Season 2 I would remove all Gold Bullion rewards and add Perk Coin rewards instead.
---
Never knew this.. good to know
---
Not to forget all the animal meat with no advanced recipes.
---
1 - They're different weapons. You can downvote, but it's a fact. They'd have to make a duplicate skin, which isn't hard at all. But yes, they're different weapons.   
---
2 - They're already working on it according to LoneVaultWanderer
---
Did you try pulling his finger?
---
do you have fallout first?  If so do those chores in a private world.
---
I have a bug/latency issue where I shoot enemies with VATS and it hits (I get shown a damage number) but it has no effect, doesn't alert the enemy or anything.  I can do this 3 times before the damage actually takes affect. WTF.
---
You can also waddle over to Big Bend Tunnel East. It has several benches.
---
The only large reputation gimp is when you don't deliver on your promise with the chosen faction after you do something (avoiding spoilers even though it's been 4 months already). However you should have been at friendly by that time.
---
No problem! It's nice to try and help newer players and build up the community(though it gets annoying with the players that are pretty self-entitled and expect to be spoon-fed). I would suggest keeping a lookout for vendors with serums(I believe that even though it is found in "Aid", it will be counted as "Misc" when previewing vendors from the map). Don't buy it from the npc because why should you pay several thousand caps when you could just pay a few hundred?
---
Wait this is a bug and not intentional?
---
Its so people can hog all the workshops. While i hate it and it sucks, its necessary.
---
And mate with her. Scorchbeaver \*shudders\*
---
The sooner you do the vault raid the sooner you can start getting treasury notes and bullion.
---
Turn pacifist mode on in the settings and you won’t accidentally start pvp with other players. Playing on private servers can sometimes get dull unless you’re strictly doing the main missions but the scrap box is a must have for me since I got fallout 1st, you’ll save hundreds of pounds of extra stash space. Also everything in the atom shop is cosmetics so it’s really up to your preference, for me I needed the new package with the green house and all the plants for my camp
---
Steakhouse, just loot the garden an you're done.
---
Yepp a bug and not intentional
---
Wrong. Furious resets once you shoot some other enemy. With the arcing I would assume it resets on every shot since it automatically hits another target due to the arcing.
---
No skins plz. New weapons welcomed.
---
It’s a limited time event, ends mid September but you could level up with atoms if you felt so inclined
---
Everyone here does realize the pass is totally optional, right?  For the most part its only cosmetic stuff.. no one needs any of it..
---
I really dont understand.  If you don't enjoy doing the challenges then don't do them!  Myself and the people i play with LOVE the pass.  I never used to do the challenges before now it's something to do every day.  The challenges only take a few minutes and you get free stuff.  If you don't want to participate you don't have to. 
---
You think this pass is a grind?  Go try to get the call of duty battle pass to 100 and tell me which takes more play time..
---
The only people who normally fun food builds are the second class citizens of 76.... If I could remove the junk from my stash... That would be a game changer. Right now i can't even have flux just no space
---
I use .38 on my fixers all the time. I have a vampire and some junkie ones. of course they underperform at the queen, radiation rumble, project paradise and encrypted. 
---
but is really effective for anything else. once I burned those .38, back to .45.
---
try it! :)
---
You do realize that everyone can still play at their own pace, right?  No one is forcing anyone to do anything except yourself.
---
Ahh I just joined a normal public server and once I got to a certain lvl it said others could hurt me
---
The traffic light is under assorted lights plan. I pretty sure it's sold at whitesprings
---
Seems a bit pointless to claim and then not use the Workshop for the intended purpose. However, that's just my mindset and play style talking.
---
Maybe they should increase the gathering rate for the machines if they plan to keep the PVP mechanic in.
---
If you have pacifist on others can't hurt you unless you are taking a workshop
---
Yeah works for t65 too lamo. Which is dumb cuz it doesn't work with ss armor
---
It will say "send nudes"
---
They solved the probem and gave back all Atoms to the affected players.
---
I was thinking about getting FO1st, to be honest. I think I play enough of the game to warrant at least a month or two. Plus, I hear the Scrap box is a worthwhile investment.
---
I've been having troubles with this as well. I run my medics build like a bloodied build with unyielding armor so I can vats crit for days. Use to be able to stand in front of the queen and just tank her damage running at 20% health. Now I can't make it through just the mobs without dying 5 or 6 times.
---
it reduced some fall damage. 2 pieces of reduced fall damage negates all fall damage, right?
---
1 piece of reduced fall damage,
---
plus rank 2 goat legs and bird bones dont make you immune to fall damage, but it takes some REALLY high places to make you take damage. like the monorail elevator or the flatwoods bridge.
---
Imagine having an event that required 8+ players in a small arena and all it was was a free-for-all battle. Maybe stealth boy on respawn. Players would be ranked on kills of course. Everyone would still get rewards regardless of rank.
---
Feels like the whole game was unintentional.
---
Always be squatting when in a workshop area so that you don't appear on the map. Once all of the enemies are dead and the area is ready to be claimed go to it's outer border (If you know where it is, otherwise guess). Hold down the build button to initiate the claim instead of the machine that's usually on the middle. Once the claim starts and the border is visible get right up to it so you can step out if necessary. Anything that can make you invisible while squatting by the border waiting for the claim will help.
---
Good luck.
---
100% agreed!
---
I know what you mean I killed a deathclaw in the mire and lost it in the foliage lol it’s so dark and the foliage is so tall and thick you can’t find a damn thing
---
Exactly! who would have thought you need to modify under armour with a mod? I thought the under armour was the mod🙈
---
Ah man just do it RDR style and have crosses show up on your minimap.
---
BTW, lost it at Winnie the Pooh's asshole 😂
---
There’s gaps in the hallway barricades that you can place a Power Armor Frame past it, and if you can reach it and enter it, it bypasses a huge chunk of progression to the control room.
---
Oh god same. I constantly have restock my slocums joe like do you really need that fancy lads snack cakes?
---
"Might as well be in Winnie Pooh's asshole" ahahaha made my morning so far!
---
While duping did screw with the economy all it did was make those god rolls cheaper so if u think its bad now just imagine what it could be
---
Could just be a heavily geared PvPer. I get messages from people all the time who think I'm either a hacker or in God mode because they're registering 0's or can't kill me in general. With how unbalanced PvP is at this point, its easy to look invincible to someone who doesn't regularly PvP.
---
Is it though? 
---
The system could use a limiter on it if it's that easy to claim workshops. I tend to only claim one, because having more than that is just a bother.
---
Don’t you love it when you play one violent night and some asshole one shots the wendigo
---
I just take them for plans and xp.
---
I can't afford to display even a single poster.   .o  ,
---
Would definetly by something neat, but they need to balance the adventure mode PvP first.
---
“Ah yes why don’t we make this incredibly risky venture even more risky by basing it on our last massive risk that didn’t pay off”
---
This is quite helpful, I didn't know that Sneaking perks worked on players. It just didn't click in my head that they would.
---
Every Vault was supposed to receive a G.E.C.K. according to pre-bethesda games. Though Fallout 3, 4, and 76 have definitely suggested otherwise since I only remember V87 and V94 having them. Judging by all the construction equipment, supplies, machinery left outside of the vaults that they were pressed into action before they were 100% done and might not have gotten their G.E.C.K.s installed.
---
I'm sure its possible, the problem is finding a big enough flat spot to place it down. I've never tried it personally though, despite having many circular camps.
---
Well, I just had an aneurism
---
I leveled up fairly quickly by going through arktos Pharma for power armor farming (I was a bit of a power armor junkie) but if that’s not your thing you can just complete responders quests and explore Gauley mine for easy XP and scrap (left the mine with over 100 steel)
---
Oh and if your on Xbox I can help you level up fairly easily. I have a group of mates that would be glad to help
---
I recall them removing a bunch of items that werent supposed to exist this may have been one of them
---
Do you understand why a limit of 255 often exists in games? It's because that's the largest value that can be be stores in a single byte. Holotapes are not items that are known to be held in mass quantities in any previous fallout game so for the sake efficiency were only set aside a single byte of space each. 
---
You can clearly hold more than 255 treasury notes meaning that misc items do not not have a one byte limit. Even assuming they've just assigned misc items two bytes would mean you would need to collect more than sixty five thousand before hitting that limit and considering people can apparently hold hundreds off thousands of individual pieces of scrap it's likely the game at least has there bytes set aside for other item types.
---
You're never hitting a treasury note limit.
---
That thing is not the same as the concept art. I very high doubt it was the original scorchbeast and there is a video of a guy explaining how this cant be the original concept for the SB since it was a concept, it was never meant to be in the game. I believe we'll be getting a new cryptid. Like we did with the Colossus.
---
Is there anything specific you're having trouble with?
---
As a beginner, make sure you collect and scrap junk and focus on quests for now, wayward line is good, and you'll naturally hit the responder quests that will take you to different places in the map.
---
If you care about builds, those are a lengthy topic and I encourage you to do some research based on the weapon type and play style you enjoy.
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah, I do the same. However, some quality of life improvements for the system and incentives never hurt.
---
With encounters and repeatables you can farm rep all day
---
There are 3 different variants of combat armour. Light, sturdy, and heavy. There is no way to change what one they fall under
---
the scrap box will change your life
---
nope. in fact, they have their owm fallout game.

Plan your perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points out ahead of time. Use this character builder to help you: Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
This was a big mistake I made early on.
---
Yes, your own perception even works against other players Stealth. But with perks and the suit, I with 19 Perception can't see someone sneaking 5 feet before me on the compass.
---
Awesome, thanks for clearing that up! on that note does heavy always provide the most protection?
---
yes, different servers, i did find NW slow today so maybe server errors seen a few questions about it today
---
Thanks, that is actually helpful advice. I didn't know that you could go into Build mode to initiate a claim. Goes to show how often I use Workshops, eh.

Id like him more if he didn't use so many damn ellipses. Stupid boomer computer
---
Well, there are much worse bugs than this.. Good thing they're working on it and eventually fix bugs. This will likely to be fixed someday too.
---
Yes, heavy will always give the most protection. Metal, leather, robot, and raider armours also have the light, sturdy, heavy mechanic. Trapper, scout, marine only come in 1 type
---
Well, my perception is trash because I'm going a Strength Shotgunner build. 
---
Does that also work with Food/Chems? or just hard stats?
---
not unless they had a bear called “winnie the poo” in fallout76.
---
If you run bloodied you should 100% be using emergency protocols anyway. The jet pack is just a fun novelty thing
---
It’s inconsistent, but when the shots hit they do so much damage
---
I've left teams because of this. Lol. I run a berserkers build and sometimes I come across people sharing bodyguards, evasive, barbarian, or junk shield. Its a nice thought, but kind destroys my build entirely. Lol.
---
Satin: *Heavy Sweating*

Oh!  Okay.   Thanks, Zach.   Will do then.   Maybe it was an expensive blessing in disguise.  :)
---
Thanks for the info! Appreciated!

Yeah man. 50% less damage is extremely helpful. It is by far the most important pa mod for bloodied pa users.
---
I know I was just taking the piss. Thanks anyway.
---
I seem to recall him exploding into a pink mist...
---
Didn't test it, but maybe it does. I mean extra charisma from food or chems effects your trading as well
---
I mainly don't quite understand the weapon and Armor modification system. Like I understand you get New modification Options after scrapping weapons but what does the Level mean when you craft a weapon or Armor?
---
No ps4
---
I'm on xbox, and I appreciate the offer.   I have no idea how to put a value on it tho.   ???
---
Well, Bethesda’s merchandising push for Fallout has always been freakin’ relentless, so your odds are pretty good.
---
Anything that doesn't have a fast travel location you can put you camp right on it. Including the edges of some fast travel locations

This has been a thing and on YouTube for a long time, and you know they dont go out of their way to fix something unless they have nothing better to do or its actually game breaking, and even then they still dont sometimes lol

okay:) i’m pc only

No, it won't. You may get a lot of friend requests so they can check out your store easier and constantly rob you, but you will still be one of the really few who does that.
---
Somewhere in the game, i guess around level 300, caps may be worthless. I dunno, that's 230 levels above me rn. At this point you either leave the game completely bored out or just grind event after event, drowning in plans and legendaries. Best thing to manage all your stuff (given daily limited scrips) is to sell asap. Those players have the lowest prices now already, from my experience.
---
Refusing to charge more than a cap for each and every item out of an idealistic idea may lower the prices overall, not gonna lie. If i visit a shop, find nothing interesting for my character but see an insurgent outfit for 100 caps i will buy it and resell it for 119 to regain some of my time and travel cost spend. This will lower the items price in general eventually, since other shops charging 600 will have a harder time to sell their outfit. 
---
You, charging only 1cap to begin with, will lower the resell prices even further, ofc. But you won't start a general trend in the player base.
---
Best way to support low levels may be gifting individuals you come across.
---
oh yeah you’re right
---
The cannibal perk is actually handy ngl
---
I only use PA during SE....otherwise, it's just Unyielding SS armour or the Chinese Stealth Suit.   But that's an important event, and worth modding for.   Plus it would be nice not to have to collect 400 dirty waters to restore those rads.  ;)
---
there are much worse bugs, but this bug annoy me too much because i play in 3rd view and every time half of my character head glowing with this...
---
That depends what exactly you wish to know. When I started playing I didn't know anything and I really enjoyed exploring and learning everything myself. The only thing I can think of is what others mentioned - try to choose a build and plan the SPECIAL from the beginning, at least roughly. I didn't plan it and I wouldn't say it's that much of a pain to change it later, but ofc it's easier if you start right ahead. I just couldn't decide what I wanted, by the time I knew I already was close to the build and now I have like 15 new lvls and I just don't know what to do with it because I'm pretty much set and have all the perks needed.
---
Have you ever grabbed toxic goo from West tek? Many people carry that. Pop a couple and get your rads back up
---
I have never seen this before. Usually it’s pitch black inside if I’m in 3rd person.
---
The level is the requirement your character needs to be at before you can equip the weapon or armor. A higher level means better stats so you always want to use a higher level item. The max item level is 50.
---
Some items have legendary effects. These items will have one to three stars beside their name and some of these are valuable even at lower levels.
---
I play in 3d person view too sometimes and yeah, this is not ideal, so I have to switch to 1st person to actually see things. But I don't think posting it here will have any effect. Try to submit a bug report/ticket on their website if you didn't. I've been surprised that they actually listen to feedback. for now at least xD
---
Workshops are for pvp. Griefing in them has never been a thing. People trying to claim them and failing to understand the core concept, despite a warning you have to agree on, always has.
---
Sound logic if ive ever seen it
---
A life changing item you say?
---
I don't want Bethesda flipping my life upside-down, for starters I wasn't born and raised in West Philadelphia and I think I'm too old to be a Fresh Prince.
---
This is viable, but I always feel guilty when I think of the person who uses the vendor after me and has to  scroll past 60 marine tactical helmets in apparel.
---
Yeh this hardly ever works for me. It only shows the really obvious ones
---
But it’s..not like an M1 at all. Makes no sense. The fixer is a combat rifle, would be better off with a B.A.R skin if you want some old war stuff. There’s no gun in the game that would make sense for that skin they would have to introduce an FAL or a handmade carbine, that’d be cool.
---
well i do my best to report it , it's their turn now...
---
Explore. 
---
Scrap weapons to learn mods. 
---
Repair and upgrade weapons and armor at weapon and armor workbenches. 
---
Limit fast traveling early on. 
---
Carry a melee weapon for when you need to conserve ammo. 
---
Make healing salves at cooking stations. 
---
Scrap and store junk regularly
---
Don’t rush the main quest
---
I tried the Megaton house but because of how shit the stairs and wall placements are in this game, I gave up.
---
Yeah, I did.   Man, it takes more than a couple from what I saw when I tried it.   It makes me wonder if, besides removing rad-protecting perks, if I need to remove all health perks or something.
---
That's exactly what I did when I was still level 50s 😂
---
I swear that is a bug from playing nuclear winter but im not sure I thought I was but It hasn't happened to me in a few weeks now.
---
reading the article does make sense, let's just hope that if bethesda does this, they better not hope to give us the beatiful places and hope we just talk to each other about it.
---
Beckley and abandoned Bogtown
---
Do the enclave quests, talk to MODUS, and read the terminals. 
---
You'll learn about the... *misunderstanding* that led to the current state of the bunker and MODUS.
---
This was posted at like 5am U.K. time, no wonder there wasn’t a server lol
---
Hahaha..I get this also..I can't look at wrenches anymore without thinking...steel/ lead
---
His voice and mannerisms are definitely based off of (or at least inspired by) Half Life's G-Man, but the picture on his consoles looks more like Dr. Kleiner.
---
I guess it's better than when she glitches mid air and never lands so you can't do enough damage to kill her in time even with 20 people 🤦‍♂️
---
I looked it up on Fed76.   They priced it at 42-62000 caps.   Holy cow.  Even if you value flux at 200 each, that's between 210 and 310 flux.   That's alot of flux.
---
Had a friend over at my camp last night and my Raider Punk came up to us, turns to him and says "Are you moving in here too?" Gave us a good laugh.
---
Is your build set up for heavys? At level 150 it should be hard to hit the 2k damage threshold
---
Agree. New skin no new weapon.
---
I saw a post a while back where someone had extracted the voice audio from a character from the gamefiles. I would love the modus audio, imagine all the sweet message notifications one could make with that! Anyone know if this is possible?
---
No I love it too, if they revealed the keyword in the Enclave bunker right away I'd solve my own codes every week. But last time I tried they didn't even reveal first letters until 3 days in
---
I can't take a 3 day break from destruction
---
Also honestly the Overseer should have a Overseer's desk at her house. And I'd like one at CAMP as well.
---
Modular Vault pieces in general would be cool.
---
Edit: And a Mr Handy that collects resources like in Graygarden/ Fallout Shelter.
---
Most of the functional items should have their base version free though, then they can sell all the skins and variants they want. They made that mistake with the fridge, and you don't see many fridge skins because if that. IMO they would have made a lot more money if the basic fridge was free, or if it actually had any utility in stopping food spoiling.
---
I could see that in the old Survival mode, but in Adventure where PVP has been dialed back to this sole use case it feels like a leftover and just doesn't fit the Co-operative nature of what Adventure stands for.
---
Despite the warnings, the problem is that Workshops are PVE in nature, but feature forced PVP by design. Seems a bit counter productive to me.
---
Every episode should cold open with a different random vault, showing whatever experiment VT intended gradually montage into chaos and madness or whatever
---
Did you get in at the start of the event, don’t be late.  Just bring a regular gatling plasma and you will do enough damage to loot the Queen.  You can buy one from the enclave.
---
i don't but i have the script to buy a 3\* i can give you :)
---
My PSN is Xredtitan
---
From a business perspective, it's just not a good idea. Fallout 76 might have come a long way from where it started but it's still widely considered to be the worst entry in the entire franchise. Most companies will just not take the risk associated with a project like this so I'm assuming that they'll stay as far away as possible from FO76, at least in the beginning.
---
Another alternative is to hold onto an assualtron head the next time you find one.  Adds 50 rads every shot when not in PA.
---
As a heavy, how is junkie working for you? Im going towards a tankier heavy/explosive build. And i have several two shot weapons that shred almost anything i point them at. Im looking for a vanguard heavy combat chest. Its mostly been a build ive done on my own, using what ive learned from playing other builds.
---
While my bloodied is capable of insane damage, i wanted to run something a bit more survivable, but still respectable damage wise. My two shot lmg will rip most anything apart.
---
UsE ThE CamERa. Prolly should just fix the bugs where the bodies fall thru the ground
---
Reminds me of the time I discovered the rock I had just decided to jump onto as a stepping stone was in fact a Mirelurk Queen.
---
I live in Beijing and play it all the time
---
Your gun is too strong I suppose. Take your buddy to a level 1 area. That way insta kill is impossible and have them die from a mob instead of you. There’s water by the county fairgrounds that U can get scorched to kill the other person. There’s also a revive someone in water challenge.
---
GT billyguv I'll run 3
---
I completely disagreed with that article. 
---
Fallout 1 would make a better introduction in my opinion. A lone wanderer in a wasteland.
---
The tone of Fallout 3 was great too, but then I like my Fallout to feel more like "Book of Eli" than all the cute stuff that has come and overwhelmed the previous bleak, foreboding, and even scary tone of the earlier titles. 
---
For that matter, I would prefer the music to be more like Mark Morgan's work than Inon Zur's.
---
I don't see any tents in Fallout 1st tab in store =\
---
I run a few berserkers builds. Honestly they're the most fun builds to run, they're kind of a chore to get in a good place though. There's a lot of quirks in the game that you can use to your advantage that most people just overlook. Id still like to see a berserkers armor effect added to the game. It removes all resistance and gives you either a flat percentage damage reduction per piece, or damage buff per piece.
---
What gun are you using? Vats seems to be working fine with my vats commando
---
Once you gain access to the armory/nuke room, Read the red terminal in the corner. MODUS had connections to other Enclave facilities, and you can read some of his conversations with a ZAX, I think the one at raven rock. It seems pretty clear to me that MODUS was quite aware and sentient from the start.
---
Just yesterday i joined a queen really late without beeing in a team and alltough she only had like 5% of her health but i still managed to get enough dmg. If you are looking for materials to craft flux, there are better places for farming it.
---
On the other hand i dont understand why ppl still mostly just farm the queen for scrip and treasury notes as the sheepsquatch can be done much quicker. I even farm the sheep solo by swapping between my private server and a public one... works even better with a friend so you can swap between the two and farm it all day long as long as you got enough caps 😜
---
Yes I know that.
---
Any luck with this yet?
---
Yes. Weapon skin new weapon is not.
---
Try to reload the game, it happens to me sometimes and rebooting the game fixes it usually.
---
Hope it fixes it
---
I love it when I kill something on top of a high peak and the body rolls alllllll the way down to the bottom and gets lost in bushes. What the fuck.  Since when do dead bodies go weightless whne their life is ripped from them?
---
Pulled my quad gauss out the other day. Nope. Still misses all the time in vats.
---
Melee vats miss most of the time. I wouldn't recommend relying on vats related perk like gun Fu. 
---
I prefer adding adamantium skeleton and fire proof. Those mirelurk and floaters are kinda annoying.
---
Why do yall people do this does it make you feel important.  Oooo you miss spelled somthing so I'm gonna be a spend my time correcting you even though every fucking person on here knew what I ment.  Good job buddy.
---
Wow, great job! Love seeing the Fallout worlds collide! There are quite a few fun spaces that I’d love to see recreated-doing something Caesar’s legion camp inspired would be really cool too but probably a bit challenging without mods. Always enjoy seeing what people can come up with!
---
It’s a shame people use things like stacking tents to get up high so the avoid the ground mobs, which causes her to seldom land.
---
Because you can then rush in and use melee on her and do more damage per hit. That’s what I do when there’s no floating tents.
---
I always use public teams for free fast travel.
---
I have a 2 mains one heavy, one commando and besides the first couple of times and the odd couple of glitches I have never failed to do enough damage. 
---
Go into you're settings and show damage numbers. That will give you an idea as to his much damage you are doing. I found Gatling guns useless on the queen. Switch out to a primed 50 cal. 
---
Last thing even if you are not a bloodied build get the adrenal reaction mutation. With fireproof you are not going to take any damage from her except poison. Just make sure to run to a safe distance when she lands.
---
 I always run the queen at about 25% health, I have 3 unyielding and 2 bolstering pieces, but I am a junkies build.
---
Try on the market subreddit
---
They are pvp by design. If you ever hold on to them for any prolonged period you can see what a miniscule amount of stuff can be farmed from them, especially compared to just farming junk. Also, if you take the pvp element away in adventure what's to stop people hogging a workshop? Workshop grieing would then become a thing by way of people claiming them just so others can't.
---
You see kids? This is what happens when you don't put enough S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points into Intelligence (atleast in the old Fallouts)...
---
But yes. No. New weapon. No skin.
---
Agreed with Zachy
---
The jetpack is a nice gimmick but honestly its not worth a torso mod slot
---
Back in the day you could put jet packs on the arms slot, honestly i dont see why not as the jetpack has no combat function at all
---
Who carries around a desk fan?
---
The Irish would like to have a word with you.
---
CONCRETE WALLS PLEASSSSEEE!!! I miss making giant concrete castles.  If they are stackable like fo4 that would be the last thing I ask for.
---
Tbf low intelligence sometimes helped you out with speech options haha.
---
Gotcha, thanks. Just figured I’d try on here too!
---
You are probably gonna struggle to buy one with caps. They go for a lot. People usually want to trade them for other rare outfits.
---
They vendor for 500?
---
The ammo converter thinks fuel is 10mm when it comes to buying.
---
Crud, gotcha... I only really have caps and maybe like two or three other rare outfits. Well, hopefully I can find someone. Thanks for the information though bud.
---
Just adding to the conversation for op
---
This, it would be soo great if they just added the jetpack to take up functionality of both arm slots instead.
---
No problem my friend, just a heads up, trading here is against the rules.
---
I've found the effect ties to the weapon damage. I've tried using an ultracite laser pistol and the effect is almost unnoticeable. A medics shotgun will heal to full health. Said shotgun does have a certain other magical property so not sure how much that influences the results.
---
That explains it! I was at the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop two days ago. The workshop wasn't shown as claimed, so I rolled on it. It had twice as many extractors set up when I took the workshop, and three of the extractors were making 5.56. I'd never seen an ammo extractor, just assumed it was a plan I hadn't gotten, so I just kept going back every ten minutes or so and picking up 600 5.56 rounds. 
---
During one of the "Defend the Workshop" iterations, I noticed a L200-something stealthed up watching me start the defense. He then left. Was he just assuming I wasn't going to show for the workshop to go unclaimed so he could get his stuff back?
---
1956
---
Even melee no VATS is a double tap scenario. 
---
I’ll hit, see the damage numbers come up, no hit...😒 second hit kills the mob.
---
Oh no I played the night before, I posted it this morning cause they I received a message thanking me for playing with them. That’s why I was so overwhelmed by their overall kindness
---
They'll add it to fallout first (-_-)
---
Oh, dang my bad. Didn’t realize it was. Just trying to find whoever may have this outfit. My bad!
---
OK, thanks, guess I'll just have to wait until things settle down.
---
True I'm all for that.
---
grinding the xp repeatable like crazy is the only way.
---
i dont know about you, but when im nuking the queen 3times in a row i want the fight be quickly as possible, nobody got time for that flying bulletsponge running in circles for 15mins
---
&gt; Why are people killing the queen so quickly 
---
Glitched or hacked weapons, in all likelihood. Both are widely used after that last dupe wave, unfortunately.
---
Id be 100% behind using both arm slots, as unless your running melee, theres no point in having your PA's arms modded
---
I disagree that just playing casually will complete the majority of challenges. Too many are things I wouldn’t normally do, such as taking workshops or hacking terminals, unless I had a particular need for it which rarely comes up. Or with VATS so messed up, I would not be using it enough to reach the frequent “critical hits on enemies” challenges. If I’m not actively grinding the challenges I miss most of them.
---
Knowing the pain of not being able to jump,  I sell marsupial serums for 50 caps each at my camp.
---
Don't stock more than 2 at a time tho because higher levels grab them all to resell.
---
Don't forget a diluted rad x wont wipe your mutations if you dont have starched genes yet but need rad resistance badly.
---
Well, if there's a detachment of PVP from them and increased incentives from the gathering, then the contest mechanic could be entirely PVE focused. 
---
I'm just spit-balling here, but we have a perk that the whole purpose is to destroy base objects that goes unused, right? Why not put it to use and have a goal of fighting through a player-made dungeon of sorts that could be built independently from the players camp. The goal is to destroy the capture point which then depletes the claim on the Workshop. Creative players could build elaborate traps and tricks into a Workshop dungeon. While those who don't care, would just not engage with the concept or even defend their bases.
---
If Arena's are made to replace PVP with their own incentive structure then engagement would be entirely in the players hands.
---
Time zone?
---
It's a display bug you actually get Fuel when you buy that "10mm ammo"
---
Yeah I know. Was like waaaaat??
---
edit: nvm I understood the point wrong :D \*PREVIOUS ENTRY VOIDED\*
---
On topic: I believe there's much more source material for any other entry and their story is already set in stone, while 76 is still in it's infancy, I would not think it's an ideal environment for the show.
---
I carry a quad crossbow with bloodied bow to tackle small group of enemies
---
It will be fix in Patch 21 when they also release the improvements to the Ammo Machine.
---
Also I just noticed that Angry Turtle made a 7~ minute long video just to explain this issue....while I'll be glad to informed people about quirks with this game I have to wonder if a video for a visual bug that people noticed immediately on Day one of Patch 20 was really necessary. It must be a slow day for him.
---
The ammo converter is just so horribly instituted in general that it's basically not even worth having.  I had one in my camp for a day, got tired of the ridiculous setup and scrapped it. What is so hard about just being able to dump in ammo for points or whatever and get back the ammo I want? Nope, have to go to 3 different screens,go to a specific category for the ammo I want to deposit, have a specific amount of that ammo, then go to another  set of screens to purchase the ammo I want. And oh yeah, you have yet another stupid cap. Why do they make everything so difficult with this game? Its like no one who works there has any common sense, or like many have stated they dont even play their own game to know how bad these decisions are.
---
Yep, they really should have added the pipboy color adjuster. Got a color blind buddy and he struggles with the green display.
---
I like turtles.
---
Gotcha cool
---
If you're on PC, you can modify your ini file to remove all grass. It'll boost you performance and make it easier to find corpses.
---
You can get lucky though. Sometimes people are after a specific thing.
---
Considering just how badly it shows the 'American Dream' I think the Chinese side doesn't look quite so terrible in comparison. Neither are exactly guilt free in the game, and let's be fair the Vault Tec and Nuka Cola companies aren't exactly shining beacons of Western Commercial Culture.
---
Had gating Plasma was at the start
---
You're gonna have to wash that on the delicate cycle :p
---
You can also download a mod. That’ll transform any Meat pie into something else. Personally I have mine set to make a figurine of the space girl
---
Scrap junk before putting it in your stash to save on space.
---
Stay in the Forest area at first.   
---
Carry a back up melee weapon (like a machete) just in case you run out of ammo. 
---
Only Carry with you the few weapons you are actually using.     Scrap or sell the rest.   
---
Upgrade your armor as you go.   You don’t need 5 pieces of chest armor.   
---
Scrap weapons and armor to learn mods.   Then craft the highest level you character can use.    
---
Setup your camp near a resource deposit if you can.  Build a bed and sleep in it to get XP bonus.    Build a instrument and play that to get “well tuned”.     
---
Do events in the forest to gain XP.  Join a public team.  
---
Check all marked locations and get plans and recipes.     Cook food that gives you bonuses.   Make healing salves.   
---
Don’t hoard mini nukes and missiles.   
---
Check you “misc” tab for heavy items.  
---
There are videos you can watch they will show you where cap stashes are.  For example there are several outside of the Poseidon Energy Plant.   
---
In settings turn on pacifist mode once you get to level 5 to avoid PVP if you want.  
---
Check all containers at the train stations and the overseers camp.   People will sometimes put stuff they don’t want in those locations.  
---
Visit player camps to get some ideas on how to set yours up and also look for good things people are selling!
---
Have fun!
---
Will try 50 cal next. Just never happened before
---
It happens to me as well and it's frustrating when it wastes a critical
---
From my observation it's not actually the gloss that is the problem, tho don't get me wrong, i'd prefer everything to be as matt as the standard wooden flooring.  
---
Ever notice how lights shine through walls ?, i think the flooring is reflecting the skydome all. the. time. the effect does get noticeable less pronounced at night.
---
There should be a perk that highlights all things lootable
---
They at least fixed the "shit shot up by plasma evaporates and you'll never find it, LOL" feature that existed since the beta. Baby steps, I guess.
---
Ugly AF. Im actually wearing mk3 paint, much more cooler IMO. Even more with the X01
---
o/ carry one with -90 weight only for this purpose
---
Wow bro you really added a lot to the discussion there...
---
nice shot bud, what build did u run with? Got a j2525 handmade and 5 addictions and been meaning to hunt one down in a private server
---
There was a discussion?
---
Or when you don't share any perk because you can't !
---
Is it possible to get both of those from 1 event?
---
I am a bloodied sneak commando build! I think you have a pretty good shot with your arsenal right now. That full health bar will do wonders!
---
May be obvious but the heavy variants have more durability, as compared to their cousins.
---
Oops sorry just excited. I will delete this just dont downvoted me
---
S K I N A S n EW WE A  P O N
---
I love my stealth suit and power armor but miengotte, I can't stand being permanently overburdened when swapping to them. 
---
My characters built for speed  on top of sneak melee bloodied,  but I'd have to get rid of 2/3rds of all of my equipment  to get my weight down enough to use them properly.
---
 . O  ,
---
Throwing knives are op until 25ish them they're just balanced
---
Yes I've read that but I know it worked. As I usually buy modules in groups of ten and use them all at once and I've ended up with 11 pieces...now this has only happened once that I can confirm so I don't think it's very frequent at all.
---
I always share scapist (stealh commando here) or  aquagirl, they both are useful imo
---
Floors and foundations cause so much grief and head scratching. I've currently got a foundation I can't remove without scrapping my whole building, and why can't I rotate a floor piece without me having to remove everything on top of it first?
---
Someone have made an mods for it that change all texture, you can take it if you want and are on PC but yeah, Bethesda need to fixe a lot of gear that don't have the skin slots mod !
---
Melee... its soo bugged, laggy not only in VATS. I usually have dmg to 1 shot NPC but i punch 2-3 times per NPC just to make sure game registered at least one hit.
---
You can get fixer plan,  impostor sheep squash helmet, outfit and mascot helmet, outfit.
---
I’d like to have different kinds and sizes of railings and more compact stairs.
---
From one completion?
---
Grab a friend, have them jump off a small cliff, then grab your friend
---
And guess what? For every level you now have to spend to move a SPECIAL point, that's one level further away from your first or next Legendary Perk down the road! Same goes for broken perks like Adrenaline.
---
*Twice the punishment, and zero times the fun!* 🥳
---
No, it's random you might get a couple in one go but most of the time it will be one or none at all.
---
Serious question.... why did you craft a full set when you get a full level 50 set from the main quest?
---
PA is super low upkeep FYI. They break so slowly.
---
That’s what makes him sound so untrustworthy
---
Well, you ignored the „ … or taking a little step left and right …” part.
---
Yes, hacking a terminal, eating 5 plant-based meals, buying 3 items from players etc. aren’t things I would normally do. But it really takes minimal effort to complete them.
---
I mean, these are calles daily/weekly challenges after all. They are already dumbed down pretty much. How easy do you want them to be?
---
I guess even if you would auto-complete them and simply hand over the Score for the daily login, people would still complain that this is too much for them.
---
So, just hand over the complete board to everyone?
---
I cant figure it out as it seems to differ by weapon.  My Gauss shotgun couldn’t hit the side of a barn at 5 feet in vats close up, but the second shot nearly always hits.
---
My lever action on one character is deadly in VATs still, but my explosive one is like 50% in a 95% chance shot. My VATs shotguns with Shells are deadly medium to short range and rarely miss.
---
Lots of threads on the topic, a known issue?
---
Uh oh this is a problem.. cause it looks awesome! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?! jk thanks
---
I've found some pretty cool plans at railroad station vendors.
---
All I want is the treasury notes
---
My VATS has improved massively since the last patch - except for the Gauss Pistol which misses 95% so easily I have holstered it as being pretty much useless atm
---
That fucked me up when I first talked to him
---
That’d be a boil-in-the-bag soup, I assume?
---
I feel like I’ve heard of it but I don’t really know
---
Sounds like you tried to use pa on a non pa build. Unless you uses heavys pa is pointless. Also sounds like use used vats alot to drain your cores so much. 
---
And like the other guy said, why would you craft a set of ultracite. You get one fir free
---
I always ditch my spare ultracite plans from scorched earth in a suitcase at train stations.  It's definitely crossed my mind before that someone might learn them and then waste a bunch of resources crafting the armor when they can get the whole suit free.
---
Had one and some dumbdumb bought it for 15k. I'm a collector but this outfit is trash 😂. It's literally one of the worst looking outfits in game.
---
Dude that’s awesome, and very sweet of you.  It’s that kind of thoughtfulness that I’m talking about.  Not even so much the buying out of vendor but it’s cool you care about being helped.  Pay it forward etc.  
---
And it’s not that all my experiences have been bad, it was just defeating having it happen 3 times in one day.
---
What?! XD
---
I sincerely hope they get rid of weapon and armor levels. They make no sense from an RP perspective and once you're over level 50 they matter only if you get a good legendary with low level, which is simply disappointing. /rant
---
I enjoy the event now, I was the same way about not understanding it. Played a few times and the massive amounts of ghouls and legendary is amazing and play it alot now.

I still get confused when to put the ore, I try to wait a bit until someone drops some but other times I just drop it. Get nervous, lol.  The event is free and pops up a lot so there will be more times to farm xp. (Encrypted has a cost so that one I wait for the person to start and just get a few shots on legendary) 
---
Lately I see people only doing it for the xp and not the event and get mad when I put in the ore. I can't help them, I want to finish for the rewards. Plus the harder enemies make it more exciting....sometimes lol
---
Tldr: great event just play and learn it. Its free and pops up a lot so there will be more times to play and learn.

You have to max out voice chat slider in audio settings.
---
Well I did the 79 quest, the overseer log quest stopped pointing me towards tapes so unless I randomly find them again, that's going to be a slog.
---
My previous character finished both quests and I did get the Ultracite PA but never used it and just scrapped for material. This time around, I found dropped plans and figured what the heck, let's build one and see what it's all about.
---
My previous character also sided with the Raiders so no Stealth Suit, thus I didn't really know how good it was. I figured it was like the one in Fallout 4 which wasn't very good.
---
There is an app on the Google Play Store called Fallout.FM.  It has channels for Fallout 1, 2, 3, NV, 4, and 76.  The only issue I have found with it is that it stops playing randomly when in the background.  Best out of game replacement for the Appalachia Radio station I have found so far.
---
Depends on how much of the storyline you do. Leveling up takes a lot of time unless you are aware of the farm methods. 
---
If you play on ps4 I would be glad to help you out a bit in the ways of knowledge and where to get some important stuff. 
---
Otherwise I can list a few here or maybe someone else can give you some help with the things I dont know
---
I really like this game but sometimes I feel like they throw things together in half an hour at the last moment, like yesterday on one of my mules, I completed the main waste landers quest just to have the gold glitch out on me at the end because I killed an npc in cold blood, Then had to do a long ass work around, just so I can start gold bullion farming.
---
Anyone else just go, What?
---
Those pauses bother me lol
---
This. 
---
I started out as a PA build because that’s how I played Fallout 4. Quickly realized there is no upside to it at all in this game, fusion cores are 3lbs a piece, no backpack, no legendary effects. Switched over to a bloodied commando with full UE set that has 100% fall protection and never looked back. 
---
The stealth armor is great too, I just am spoiled by having all the extra SPECIAL points when running normal armor so I rarely use it unless I’m hanging out in a nuke zone.
---
What was the last thing you did yesterday? Was in NW? And did you go into the atomic shop/NW/legendary run menu before going into adventure?
---
This really is an annoying bug and it seems nobody really knows what causes it
---
You need to finish a Quest in order to launch nukes. However you also need to clear the silo, which is not that easy to solo as a low level. If you don't mind spoilers regarding the quest: &gt;!It's the Enclave Quest, you can find more information if you look for that!&lt;
---
It’s pretty crazy. I had to craft one on my original character because I dumped the “power armor chassis” that was a reward without realizing what was on it until a month later when everyone was talking about ultracite armor and I had no idea what they were talking about.
---
PA done right is pretty tanky imo. Look for the dude taking it in the face when the Queen actually lands- I can promise he's not gonna be a bloodied/uny low health build. Unless he's a true hero....
---
Im not sold on stealth suit. If you have no better option then go for it (unless it's a nuke zone however not many SBQ fights are actually IN the zone if placed well). The loss of AP regen, weight reduction, unyieldings boosts etc are impossible to replace with a Predator shimmer and some fall resistance. I defs get detected more in stealth suit than my 5pc. 
---
I say persevere with PA or go with a 5-piece with some good boosts. Just my opinion take it or leave it. The stealth suit for me looks like a gap filler for real armor/gear.
---
I only use PA on my heavy weapons build for the Stabilized perk. That is the only reason, because the alternative is much better.
---
Do you need to loot the sheep because I can never find the body? Maybe it explodes or something, I'm new to this event, always avoided.
---
I’m confused. Did you do the freedstate, BOS, and enclave quests yet? The overseer isn’t really what directs you through the original main quest.
---
Almost with hard bargain 3 and 4 charisma. There are 80 caps left i think, then i sell just other stuff
---
And then relevant ones should start cropping up normally? Will try today thank you!
---
Very cool man! Looking forward to getting mine too. I took advantage of the Double XP weekend and leveled up from lvl 58 to 71. Only 29 more to go xD
---
Just shows we need more items really for crafting. They have a massive back cat they could pull from like NV.
---
No, you don't it's awarded at end of the event like other item drops, the sheep only has a legendary weapon or armour on him.
---
You’re welcome.
---
I think that just turns off the pop up notification for when a new public team is created.  It doesn’t affect the notification for when someone joins or leaves your team.
---
Fireplace secret door.
---
You could with a VPN. Tried it before with exitlag. it allows you to choose the server you want to connect to. I was surprised that there are regions. I thought all were US servers.
---
I'm starting to think distance to the enemy plays a part. Like, I can have a 20% - 40% vats chance at a long range and still land 80-90% of my shots with my lever action. When the mob is middle range and I see 95% I hit most of my shots. If the mob is close and still showing 95%, I miss a lot of shots. This could just be me though and the weapon I'm using.
---
Me.
---
In my experience it does. I run heavys and can definitely tell the difference
---
I looked at the perks and that's a great build. But I can't find "elusive". Did you mean "Escape Artist"?
---
colorblind are way underrepresented in this game. We're not talking about spoiling it for the normally sighted, we just need something to even the odds a little.
---
If you’re looking at it, it reflects what your damage numbers would be, not his.
---
With the right mods it possible.hardend gives a really good boost for starters
---
I play on a PS4 and I see people nuke the prime fissure site all the time.    Sometimes two or three times.    If I have the ammo I’ll run over and help kill her  or if they nuke another spot I’ll just collect the nuked flora and kill enemies to get the materials to stabilize it. 
---
As others have mentioned the last part of the main quest has you launching your own nuke to fight her.   
---
If you see players in the silos there is a good chance they are about to launch a nuke.
---
Ts is 25% e is an extra 20%, so Tse is 45% increase. Did you have the same perks, same hp, and same mods with the 2 guns?
---
I don't think they should be adapting ANY of the games personally. This is such a perfect opportunity to explore the universe in places and ways that we haven't been able to before. It'd be incredibly limiting trying to adapt any game story to a different medium. I say play to the strengths of TV and the strengths of the setting itself, and tell a new story. It could be set in the same area as a game possibly, but different time, characters, story, etc. would be the best imo
---
Must be some YouTube or snap tok thing
---
Probably differently modded and you still forgot to calculate the explosives in. I'm very Two shot dosent double the damage.
---
PA is pretty tanky if using the right perks and mods I will say. And PA also fits well with heavy guns. 
---
If ur using a sneak commando/rifle build before then I would suggest maybe to create a new character using heavy guns.
---
Same to me. My Handmade (with 33 vats) hits everything, but my fixer miss almost 50% first shots. For auto weapons it's not a big problem, but semi auto weapons may suffer this more
---
Do it for the XP/SCORE, not the 1* Troubleshooter Rolling Pin the queen will give you.
---
We’ll see them eventually, but they are streeeeeeeeetching out any pre-existing content from Fallout 4 as it’s an easy and very cheap way to pad the game over a period of years. 
---
That we need this stuff *now* is inconsequential as, barring any fasnacht level outrage, there’s a plan that must be stuck to.
---
How are new players hurting you?
---
They only do damage to you if you are
---
 1) in a workshop
---
Or
---
2) you shoot back
---
I still can’t discover Bogtown.  So I feel your pain.
---
Hell yea ! Lining up my house is quite a chore . 
---
I build it all up ( a three story mini mansion) only to get told you “ you can’t put a fence here it’s outside the building area “ 😐 well if i wasn’t building a square house within an invisible circle I would know that ! 
---
Then I have to start all over again because blueprints never place where I want because I can’t zoom out so it’s impossible to place it perfectly when your in first person 😡
---
I’ve thought the exact same thing!
---
That and a grid snap system (that you could turn on and off) would be awesome.  Imagine being able to snap a foundation to the corner of your CAMP and build out from there. You’d actually be able to take advantage of your available area!
---
Power armor has a hidden damage reduction bonus around 40-50%. There is a mod called emergency protocols that further reduces damage by 50% when at low health. With power armor, you can be quite tanky. I think to outperform power armor, you would need a full set of, e.g., cavalier armor. It’s easier to acquire power armor.
---
The stealth suit and hazmat suit have a hidden rad reduction bonus of 99%; the hidden bonus for power armor is 90%. Thus, the stealth suit is much better at reducing rads than power armor.
---
I'm not 100% on this but the holotapes I found in glass Caverns seem to allude to how the mole miners came to be
---
Delete this
---
Why?
---
out here tossin secrets around, Bethesda might actually fix it
---
Claim them and leave immediately if you don't want pvp.
---
It is an idiotic challenge for a non-pvp player.
---
Single shot is best.  For instigating, remember it loses most of its damage after the first hit.  Since you want to max damage, go with a sneak build and perk set up.  Getting the damage multiplier is huge.
---
For what it's worth you can do both at the same time. That's what I did
---
Thank you for your Survivor Story.
---
Even if you did strait slaughter colossus, windigo is a proper spelling of that word
---
Which auto receiver do you have on it?
---
Also stealth is a big advantage
---
You think they don't know about it and my single comment on this thread will get it noticed and sub-sequentially patched?
---
exactly!!!
---
U bought the game but still need something positive to play it?
---
Who doesn’t wana look like constipated blue goat !? 😂 shame I bought mine from a vendor ... I had too many caps anyway tut tut
---
Same with me I can't place fences because its "outside the build area"
---
I think it’s hardened. I haven’t checked cause I’m not on right now.
---
plenty of morons believe that serendipity stacks and the whole team should share it. if you argue with them that it doesnt stack, they try to make absurd arguments like "it gives the effect multiple chances to kick in" NO IT DOESNT.
---
Damn really? I was wondering why 10mm was in energy ammo. Thanks for the tip.
---
yep, they’ve fixed dumber shit just to inconvenience the player base before, wouldn’t be surprised if they did it to this too.
---
Rifle man will be applicable to it right? Or does it have to be sniper?
---
No perk stacks, heck some perks glitch out and actually remove the effect if someone shares it while you have it equipped!
---
There’s a really great channel on YouTube called “Widgeon TV”. This guy explains a lot of the lore behind Fallout 76 and the creatures roaming around Appalachia. Ironically, a week ago he posted a video about the [Mole Miners](https://youtu.be/GxWgnoRjZxQ).
---
Hasn’t arrived yet, will actually arrive while I’m at work today. Just looking for something cool about the game that’ll make me excited to play when I come home. Most of the stuff I see here tends to be negative.
---
It's fine for me aslong as you shoot right away and don't wait.
---
I find it lower elevations like sneaking that bug vats, I believe vats was nerfed in wastelanders to not be an aim bot and factors in enemies movement but the elevation issue is a bug.
---
This is exactly why jumping works, since it fixes the elevation.
---
I recommend don't look anything up, chuck the game on, get some headphones and just absorb it.
---
No preconceptions--just play it.
---
I think you'll have a great time!
---
headshots / weakspots hit in manual aiming do more damage. you will see yellow numbers instead of white.
---
I manual aim a lot....with some weapons it's fun.
---
But believing that it's this one comment that will lead to it. Not the YouTube tutorials. Or how nearly every person knows about it and shares the information freely. I WISH my comments had the influence you seem to be giving it.
---
You buy a disc? Should have bought digital, mang. I've somewhat recently gone all digital now and its great.
---
Something positive...You get to kill a bunch of shit and not go to jail for it!
---
Use the nukesdragon perk builder. There is roadmap on the bottom of the page, tells you which stat to invest and which perk to choose level by level based on your chosen cards.
---
For build I recommend looking at Sneak/Vats/Rifle (yes all three categories together) builds, check YouTube videos, Reddit guides. Also I highly recommend looking through ALL perk cards and what's their effect. You might want to use the builds other people post as a reference but make your own after a while of theorycrafting. There are cards that suits others but might not suit your playstyle. That means that you can have eg. 3 more points in intelligence for demolitionist when you don't have exploding weapon. Some may use 4 ponts in charisma for lone wanderer but you are playing 90% of time in group.
---
Advanced:
---
Also look for mutations which you may use in build and make appropriate arrangements, especially in luck department with starched genes.
---
Some other mutations have synergy with other perk cards.
---
Powerful automatic receiver is what you want
---
That time playing count, is that account wide or character bound? I have 5 characters, 4 ~150, been playing since the beta and never power leveled. The amount of hours I have listed seem rather low.
---
just show him the link to the wiki detailing all the legendary effects.
---
Going by who was hired as producers. It maybe closer to Westworld style of story telling. With a mix of Twilight Zone mystery. (Old ones) Each Vault has its separate story, Different era's  with flashbacks to prewar. All timelines eventually tie together at the end of the series.
---
Hey, that’s exactly what I’m looking for!
---
And I too usually just buy it digital however I got a really good deal on the disc that I just couldn’t pass up.
---
you could also do it without a jetpack. you just have to clip through two doors (after bio card) using the power armor glitch
---
You have a whole new Fallout world to explore.  Better than just replaying an old game.  Take your time exploring it - don't rush it.
---
Thanks for the advice! I’m looking forward to it!
---
It’s not griefing. It’s consensual PvP. 
---
Stash your junk. Find an unowned workshop. Clear out the enemies. Find a spot to hide and crouch. Then start the claim.  As soon as it’s claimed, fast travel away or exit the area. 
---
Repeat as needed. 
---
This challenge has been around for over a year. If you don’t feel like doing it, don’t.
---
Would be useful as a distraction to lure enemies away from you if they didn’t spot you yet
---
It’s better than single shot? Cause I’m like planning to make either my fixer or my handmade single shot since they both burn ammos fast
---
90% of the players you meet will be really friendly and you might get some really awesome help from them.
---
Also you might fall through the floor a few times.
---
Placing steps in the wrong place is my biggest frustration ! Can’t remove it so have to tear the entire house down and rebuild 🙄 I have a hard time trying to back this game sometimes , it’s like the annoying little brother that you hate but have to kinda love it really even though it makes so many bad choices 😂
---
I know people that have been playing since launch and still ask people to join their party and share super duper before they start crafting because they think it stacks. it drives me insane that people have never looked up how the perks work.
---
What are those plans?
---
I sometimes ask that, but usually only because I'm on a pre lv 50 character at the time who can't pick the perk yet.
---
Amazing world to explore. Don’t fast travel. Go for a hike. There is a lot to see.
---
Stealth Rifleman IS the sniper. Tank killer/Sniper perk cards will benefit a single shot Fixer as well. One of the combat rifle/fixers strongpoints though is its low VATS cost. In practice you really only need one point of concentrated fire and Sniper as things rarely take more than three shots and you wont be aiming down the barrel much.
---
The gameplay is vats/shot/shot/vatsnewtarget/shot/shot/vatsnettarget/shot/shot, etc.  Only rarely will you ever need to actually manually aim. And even then its when your trying to lure a bat close so you can wreck its face in vats.
---
I dont even have a Fixer on my stealth sniper, but just a L50 hardened combat rifle is enough to kill a L80 (onestar) legendary bat in less than a single 20 round mag. Takes maybe 5-7 seconds. Lure it down, vats its head and unload.
---
Fixer is even better.
---
UK internet is good. But I still lag
---
Much better.
---
ok, i admit i am wrong. sorry for that
---
Better hope it’s a disk.  I bought the tricentennial package when it came out and my disk was a cardboard cutout with the code on it.
---
Real talk as a solo player I think the world needs some guidelines on what to share. I have 4 charisma and can only share travel agent lol
---
Atleast your FT's are cheap with me... 
---
And what I don't deliver in shared perks I deliver in healthy pylon activations, pet protection, add management and sound ore procurement etc for event mechanics.  What would you rather have ya know? :)
---
What plans are those?  I go in there all the time searching for that rare Asylum Uniform and often run through the right side and clear the ghouls and usually get 1-2 legendary.  I always hit the mirrors, but I didn’t know there might be something rare in there?
---
And congrats by the way
---
Lovecraftian horror, as others have mentioned. Similar to the Interloper in Lucky Hole Mine. Fallout games often have Lovecraft references. Hopefully they continue to sprinkle more in. I’d love to see these cool creatures expanded on eventually.
---
If it’s not powerful auto, can you mod it for me? I don’t think I can craft it. I’ll just drop some caps in if you want
---
Plz fix the loading screen.
---
each 10minuts to wait for the loading screen is done.
---
cpu i7 6800k
---

---

---
Okay awesome thank you very much for the tips! :) been using a starter set up so far and been enjoying it, but im curious as what i should be doing besides quest lines :O not sure how this game is actually played XD im a solo player but wanna do group stuff so im in a wierd spot lol
---
One can also spawn at Bog Tow, north east-ish of watoga
---
If you could vats critical outside vats then I'm all free aiming.
---
It's because you left the Union....
---
Been watching him just now :O seems great thank you!
---
Wait what? VATS drains AP and Fusion Cores? What the heck kind of a joke is that? Do the PAs increase hit % by default and without mods to justify the drain?
---
Because that sounds like more incentive not to use one.
---
I used to play using mouse and keyboard, but since moving the PC to the living room, a gamepad is more practical and VATS helps for when you don't have that mouse precision but still need it.
---
We need more Enclave stuff. So far it's really only the uniform,the Enclave plasma guns,and there was a eye patch pack in the Atom Shop which included one with the Enclave symbol.
---
Some ppl are just lost in this game 😂
---
If it uses ap it drains fusion cores
---
Whats happening in 7 weeks? O\_O Ya'll lost me at mutations let alone legendary perks roflll
---
I don’t think concentrated fire’s damage bonus is that high. I had heard it’s about 1%/2%/3% per rank. Where are you getting 30% for max rank?
---
Also I personally like manually aiming since I’m a big FPS guy, but I can admit that a proper VATS build is much stronger
---
Apparently campfire tales only appears at night.
---
I had a 3 star legendary meat pile stuck under an ash pile in radiation rumble today :(
---
"The whole Enclave vs. Brotherhood Of Steel conflict is a big part of the Fallout lore, but it's possible to have a story without it. "
---
My favorite part of the article
---
- Some Events pop up randomly 
---
- Some Events can be triggered manually
---
- Some Events can be started automatically if you happened to be in the area on an Event Area/Trigger
---
- Some Events will only pop up at a specific Time and Place in the game
---
Or maybe the ps4 can’t handle the game very well😂 I only experience severe lag when I’m in events where there are a fuck ton of players.
---
What i recommend is hit the damage threshold (think its about 1000 health) then cryolate it for the rest of your team. Or, try fight the troops on the ground to protect people who are shooting the queen. I recommend you hit the threshold though or youll get nothing

This one looks like fun... I hope they will release it to Europe too :)
---
you're not my supervisor
---
Thanks! It has a happy accident. I was walking by with a different mounted head and noticed it kind of just sank into the tree.
---
It's due to hip fire accuracy this is the other thing you need to consider and isn't factored into the 95% vats chance.
---
I bet the 10mm smg has better hip fire accuracy and that's why is misses alot less.
---
That’s a great tip about using Nukashine to manage encumbrance! Much more fun than Rad Ant lager. :)
---
Do you *want* pissed off players? Because that's how you *get* pissed off players.
---
If what you say is true and no Claim or Contesting was happening then you didn't get killed by another player. 
---
You need to tag, be wanted or claim/contest to enter pvp.
---
Nice beaver...
---
And scorchbeasts bounce like fucking jelly
---
Yes, almost everything we build is square shaped,
---
Even if you wanted to make a round camp, its easier to put a round shape in a square than a square shape in a circle
---
wait, who is my supervisor?
---
Shotguns are werd, my brother is trying to build one and he noticed alot of random issues.
---
*Sniffs glue*
---
I want a ghillie flamer.

Just cos.
---
idiots.  all you had to do was ask for the mask to be like every other piece of armor that can be worn over and hidden, instead of taking out all those stats that now people like me who come after are NOT ABLE TO GET ANYMORE!   !!#j$@#a$c$%k$#$#o@%ff#%s\^#$\^
---
Depends on your other pieces, but ap refresh is generally more useful unless you never use vats. If you are bloodied with full unyielding you can get away without any sneak perks or armor most of the time due to high agility.
---
Generally I prefer sneak 3 for queen fights to be safe, but escape artist is the real money maker.
---
Quick hands. Someone shared it and I got hooked. Its like adding dual ammo on top of the rest of the stars.
---
Hate: Sun-Kissed
---
Share: Strange in Numbers
---
Eh, I have 299 of them
---
Kill things, loot them, sell the loot.
---
Are you a troll? It’s a bit late now...
---
And also, I had an unyielding mask myself too.
---
We don’t need it.
---
What's the going rate on High rad fluids these days OP?
---
I am.full unyielding and use vats most of the time, but I needed to know if the second harder to detect from.the chest will make a big difference in sneak, the rest I have them mostly only with +1 agility as the second effect
---
Kind of curious what this box was in general. More details?
---
Playing it with friends is nice too! I love playing it with my husband, I get lotsa freebies from him hehe 😁
---
Now you just need to sit in front of the camera while spinning your head 360 degrees and it'll be perfect xD
---
This post is toxic af. Chill out.
---
Best tip is don't read anything here.  =P it's a fun game.
---
I usually run with a two shot lever action rifle. Never even looked at this perk. Would have been useful when I’m getting mauled by the Whitesprings ghouls while reloading.
---
Those are "on-paper-it-looks-good" perks that rarely ever get combined into a single functional build. Conc Fire is life though, but for its cascading accuracy.
---
If your on ps4 hit me up.
---
Yes the key is working together instead of spending time picking up all the loot before the event is over, pay attention to keeping the workers alive and mining.
---
Any card that gives a bonus with no penalty is gold. Idk why people aren't sharing cards, even if they don't have something spectacular.
---
It would be so easy for them to implement it too, it literally already exists on the engine because they had it in Skyrim...
---
https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Detect_Dead
---
If you ever looked at Fallout 4 in the Creation Kit, so many assets were just straight ripped from Skyrim that they didn't even change their config names/tags and you have like Skyrim high fantasy sounding names for Fallout 4 assets... Not complaining about that, just drawing attention to the fact that they could implement this 'spell' that already exists in creation engine for Fallout 76 with about five minutes of work if they felt like it.
---
If that ain't the pot calling the kettle black.
---
1st I feel the whole reason VATS exists is that the way weapons feel and respond in the FO games is kinda pathetic compared to other shooting games. 2nd as broken as VATS is in this game I don't feel as though it offers as much advantage as it did in previous FO games, 95% hit chance at point blank range and you still miss half the time and depending on what gun your using VATS can actually be a disadvantage (I'm talk about you gauss rifle!) 3rd there are some weapons in this game that are nearly impossible to use without VATS, energy weapon are the worst for standard aiming. I've fired at enemies at point blank range with using standard aiming and somehow the round passes right through the target causing no damage.
---
Plus, there are some problems currently with blocker, adrenaline. Melee characters should avoid vats and more use of power attacks. There are four types of attack. Regular swing, running at swing, power swing (which uses agility points) and running at power swing. Now add sneak on top of each for even more damage.
---
Huh. Had a bunch of those healing salve plans and sold them for 500 caps each at my vendor. Good to know they are rare lol. Next time I don't will sell them that low haha
---
Everybody and their mother is looking for the same gear so prices keep going up, regardless of duping.
---
This is obviously a recent change, and I was looking forward to getting this when I saw it in a video.  Now I can't.  Easy for you to say when you already got one.   
---
Why take less stats when the better solution is to just have it hidden like every other piece of armor...   Lazy azz Bethesda
---
Gun fu would be the shit if it didn’t lag when switching.
---
And then their corpses stalk you around the Wadtelands
---
Oh hahaha Maybe I shouldn’t comment before drinking coffee
---
Apparently it also makes your camp invisible on the map
---
Too tsunami.
---
I agree...would be amazing if this happens probably not though lol
---
I found a Death Tambo and used that until I found a better Death Tambo. Those things are awesome.
---
Yeaaaaahhhhhhh.
---
Im gonna need that stapler.
---
Thaaaaaaanks.
---
All the glowing meat my melee character takes from the moleminers is just their lunches.
---
Jesus, this. I'm near blind and I feel like I spend easily half my time just trying to find shit. VATS actually helps a lot during a fight - but once they are dead, unless my shite vision happened to see them go down, they may as well have disappeared into the ether.
---
I can’t stand Gun Fu. I can select targets faster than the perk swaps them and not be stuck in VATS when I don’t want to be. Though I understand why many people like it. 
---
There should just be an option to decline a shared perk. Between Gun Fu and the rad reduction perks, there’s a lot out there that might not be good for someone. 
---
Simple communication would be great, but so many people have chat turned off or are in their own parties that it’s about impossible to just ask someone to stop sharing.
---
The game is full of these little scary things. Anybody meet the little girl that is looking for her parents and just vanishes when you turn around?
---
For single shot, better to get a lever action. Fixer and handmade are wasted on single shot.
---
There is also no reason to go hybrid rifleman/commando. Pick one and perk up accordingly. Commando is much better in general, but you can't beat the ammo efficiency of a lever action.
---
LANAAAAAAAAA
---
Wait, the prosnap does this?
---
Yeah, this. Your numbers on concentrated fire are way off.
---
Careful my friend.  Some people might think youve found a new d00ping method.  Talking bout presents and display cases at the same time little risky.
---
And/or even just put a death icon (different from the player's) in the compass.
---
I don't know exactly what I did, but I do know that I didn't go into NW at all and I'm fairly certain I didn't use the Atom Shop, but I'm less certain on that. (side note to devs who might be reading this: a purchase history in the atom shop seems like it'd be useful).
---
I don't get what people don't understand about it.  People get fomo, people have addictive personalities, game developers know this, that's why they design the way they design.  You and I may be able to say "nah, not interested", but not everyone can.  Not only that, but while those people are being taken advantage of, the design is activly training peoples brains to develop those tendencies.  Probably a lot of players can avoid it, but a lot of players can't.  
---
Plus... the score shit is really going to be 80% of the content from here on out.  It will be score and then meat week or some other event every other month or more.  It's kind of a bummer to not be into basically the only thing there is to do.
---
nice man, at least solo u still get the sneak buff cos I don't know about you but whenever I have npcs or other players attacking something I don't seem to get the multiplier.
---
How many rounds did it eat it up?
---
Sneak is a 3rd perk and AP refresh is a 2nd. So, you can get both.
---
someone opened 8 at a SBQ fight last night and i felt that. :c
---
Best use is for making flux and plasma cores
---
- Bird Bones
---
- Carnivore
---
- Eagle Eyes
---
- Egg Head
---
- Grounded
---
- Healing Factor
---
- Herd Mentality
---
- Marsupial
---
- Scaly Skin
---
- Speed Demon
---
Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of 23 extra stat points. 
---
Other Effects: +50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, +20 pounds carry weight, x2Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons. 
---
**Class Freak 3** means I get all those benefits for a trade off of: -12 HP, -12 AP, 13% less effectiveness from Chems &amp; Stims, -12% Energy Damage, and no benefits from plant-based foods.   The last two are irrelevant for me, since I don’t use energy weapons except very rarely. 
---
That’s an exceptional trade-off.
---
I think a perk for down site aiming that boosted dmg would be cool. Although if you can free aim reliably it doesn't much matter. It's not hard to get enough dmg to kill stuff.
---
Hmm i want to say about 1k-2k rounds depending on how well I place my shots. 3k+ if I die and it regens health.
---
And yeah, the sneak bonuses really help out. It’s not that long of a fight, I’d say 10 minutes on average.
---
Wouldn't be a horrible legendary perk, double up mods on power armor.
---
20 tick rate amazon servers lool
---
Yea, talk to me again in 2022
---
V) view when you have the pip boy up changes back and forth between the regular screen view and the power armor HUD view. I keep the HUD view up all the time
---
My first time - the body exploded or something and we couldn’t find it. 
---
That’s event can be dicey.
---
Don't claim a workshop until you're PvP ready.
---
 Some high levels love to farm newbies at workshops so be careful out there !
---
Forcing, no.  Encouraging yes.  Some people have a hard time ignoring that push.  Obviously the way the pass is designed is to get people logging in every day or they will miss out.    
---
If the pass had at least SOME kind of banking system I don't think I'd feel nearly as critical of it as I do.  That way people could at least be spared feeling forced to log in every day if they were interested in completing the pass.
---
The dmg on the card is not the whole story. There are already tons of videos on YouTube and posts that illustrate why TSE isn't that great. It gets the job done, but it's definitely not worth seeking for end game play anymore.
---
They're different weapons even though you can learn all of the mods from one by scrapping the other?
---
Tank-Killer or Inspirational, depends on what the other teammembers share
---
I actually like the klaxon sound when a nuke is about to drop... it's weird sounding and isn't piercing like most klaxons. This one is... guttural.
---
Bloody mess is one that I hate. Usually 90% of groups I have gotten into or even if I created it and someone joined they had this. Sorry but I don’t want my enemies to explode into pieces and fall into spots I can’t loot them. 
---
I share traveling pharmacy because my friend needs it shared and I play with them frequently
---
Atom shop at one point in time
---
asap.
---
Same with the Settler and Raider one. You should definitely be able to adjust it and not have to pack up your CAMP. 
---
It's so excessive.
---
Using frag grenades nearby yourself can work. Doesn’t require PvP and if you gauge the distance right you’ll down yourself to ‘help me’ status and then they can revive you.
---
No way CF is 30% dmg boost lol, maybe like 3%
---
I think if you are in the low 40's high 30's you should be able to make it, possibly with some amount of grinding if on the lower end.
---
Well that sucks guess I'm SOL. Thanks
---
Yes. Definitely.
---
As for 'swapping' I'd say in general if you are using vats a lot, lvc is better. If you don't use it (like most heavy guns for example) fr is better.
---
&gt;This is obviously a recent change, and I was looking forward to getting this when I saw it in a video.
---
LOL what? This thread is like 100 days old and so is the video, How is obviously a recent change? It was patched like a week after wastelanders released...
---
&gt;Now I can't.  Easy for you to say when you already got one.
---
I don't have one. No one does, it was patched out. Beth completely removed the legendary effect from all masks, as it should be. Unyeilding is already powerful enough.
---
And how old are you? Because it's not very mature to get so upset over something so tiny like this. Are you also going swearing and insulting into moths old threads where people have legacy lasers but you don't?
---
I thought those recipes you’re referring to in your older post you linked could also be obtained as event rewards?
---
Yeah, I remember the first time that happened to me. Big damn bastard caught me off guard.
---
Yeah that's why I'm loathe to spend them. Just some acknowledgment from Bethesda that they know VATS is broken and they're working on a fix would have me sit tight.
---
I dont understand? Weren't you asking which one to go for? You can get all 3; Unyielding, AP Refresh, and Harder to Detect while sneaking (Sneak) on an armor piece. AP refresh only shows up in 2nd star slot and Sneak is a 3rd star slot perk.
---
Wow, the incredible minds of Bethesda are at it again...
---
Glad I’m not the only one. Gauss shotgun always shoots over the heads of mole miners and behind any fast mover (running ghouls) 
---
It seems really bad in PA.
---
Sometimes if I vat, unvat and vat it locks in better.
---
If I jump in the air and vat it then seems to get a good lock.
---
If I aim for leg specific it seems much better.
---
Non-explosive shotguns seem to tag much better. Those are just my observations.
---
and maybe please.... to keep me from having heart failure. stop dropping dead scorchbeasts from the air when fast traveling from one spot to another.  I get it that I killed a couple, but does Bethesda really need to have them drop in my house, while I am cooking or just after my weapon broke when trying to make it to a workbench ...
---
I'm trying for vanguard pieces with weight reduction minor perk....  This might take some time.
---
And thousands of scrip.
---
I currently have an arm and a leg.
---
I mean, I am interested and it takes a few minutes a day for free stuff.  However, if I wasn't interested I wouldn't participate.  There are other games and MORPGs that I play much more casually than I do 76.  I don't get all the pass rewards or event rewards from this games.  This is ok.  It.  Is.  Just.  Pixels.  No one is going to be hurt or affected negatively because they "missed out" on something.  Everyone has the ability to say no.  Every single day there is a person somewhere on earth who fights through their addiction and many times this is with something much more addictive than a game.  Imagine having a need to claw into your own skin because you're on heroine withdrawal and you feel little bugs crawling around under your skin.  If people can beat that addiction I'm sure that the average gamer can find the mental fortitude to stop doing something if they do not feel it is worth their time.
---
How is anyone being taken advantage off? It's a few minor optional tasks you can choose or choose not to do every day.. So because some people have weak states of mind and 0 will-power the rest of us shouldn't have stuff to grind for if we want it?  So game developers should design their content to cater to the lowest common denominator of mental strength among it's player-base?
---
You say that you want more content and you hate that they add score shit instead but Welcome to online multiplayer RPGs man.  There is no possible way any amount of developers could pump out good story content at the rate that we would like to consume it as hardcore players.  I finished the wasteland main quest on all 5 characters in a week and then I was done with something they worked on for months, hell maybe years except for the repeatable stuff.  Repeatable stuff is needed as filler to keep the players going until the next content which they inevitably burn through at light-speed and then complain there is no content.
---
Not to my knowlege, but that's a damn good idea
---
I got it mate but it was a joke that I will get a 3* with this in 2022
---
I tried clearing the silo and they just kept coming and coming till I ran out of ammo.   Next time I'm going to try sneaking and hacking my way through.
---
At 4 Charisma.... I share Travel Agent... I can only share 1x cost cards with my shitty Charisma.
---
Basically my toon is me in real life. Perhaps the immersion was too realistic...
---
Edit - Holy shit I just realised all my non upgraded cards could be shared even with my shit charisma. Holy fuck I've douched groups for so long.... Why didnt I think of this....
---
I get it, fair enough. I do still switch it up from time to time. But as a 50cal. Sniper and silenced pump shotgun, it's kind of stealth options. If I kill them before they see me, I don't really need the armour. But if spotted, my legendary shogun build is pretty beefed up. More than three level 60+ at once, I'm toast.
---
Once in a while I like a good face on battle, but the PA just didn't pull me in to try more. I'll keep it around, and if I ever finish the other main quest and get a second one, I'll keep it around and mod it differently or something. I just don't think the PA is going to be something I do regularly though.
---
I'm more Splinter Cell than Call of Duty, if you will.
---
In my opinion, it is way too early to be buying ranks. Unless you know you won’t be able to play at all for the next six weeks, it make more sense to wait. 
---
Especially since double SCORE for Dailies is supposed to start in less than four hours.
---
To be fair some people are just completionists who want to to get everything they have on their own.  Personally I dont want to he handed the world on a silver platter from a high level, but if they drop reasonable items like stimps or some ammo or some camp plans I will accept.
---
It's why I think Legendary Perks should be based on level, and not require scrapping of perk cards.
---
I know that u/Ladydevann mentioned she was planning to update the [Wastelanders | Known Issues &amp; FAQ](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/399491/wastelanders-known-issues-faq-updated-may-19th-2020) but I know they have their hands full, so we'll just have to wait and see. That is where I'd look for it to be added, though.
---
As the other person said if your build isn't optimized to use PA then it's not going to be efficient or make much sense to use. If you've got a build the relies on VATS and stealth then PA isn't going to play to those strengths and will be mostly useless for you. If however you did make a PA build and use the right PA mods you'd see more of the benefits. Not saying one is better than the other, or one is the right way to play, it's more of a to each their own type thing.
---
I think I have a 3s lever but I forgot what prefix it has
---
This. If you perk up and have the right build and mutations you are nearly unkillable in PA except for poison.
---
Pacific Timezone!!!
---
Nukacrypt is what I use
---
Got it. Sorry it's my bedtime. Yea those rolls are terribly hard to come by. Easier, and I say that lightly/half-jokingly, to trade for them. Best of luck.
---
And the jetpack
---
Once you get the SS Jetpack, and have goat legs, it becomes near impossible to die of falling.  Bird Bones just makes you float and stoat in the air longer.
---
The world is huge, gorgeous, and varied.  Don't worry about maximum efficiency at first, just enjoy exploring.
---
How about this... 
---
Tap vats button to target, Hold the vats button down and it will highlight dead bodies in red
---
This seems like such a no brainer.  It's been suggested several times before so I dont know why it hasn't been implemented yet.
---
This.
---
Bar skin would be cool too but it is far more like an m1 imo since it fires a pistol cartridge.  To each their own!
---
Ye i only use them for PA mods, don't really like to use the prime receiver, and ultracite ammo..
---
There was a Thanksgiving display case too that looked a lot nicer and held I *think* 6 items instead of 4. I'd wager it'll be back during Thanksgiving this year (or at least I hope so) other than that no there aren't any other available general display cases AFAIK
---
It never says it's a simulation like in Tranquillity Lane or something 
---
Nuclear Winter (in a story canon sense) is really happening. 50 people are really dying every match. 
---
Matches just don't happen all that often. Maybe only the once honestly. It would take a while to keep collecting 50 new people until you can try again 
---
And the funny part is that the whole testing process would probably stop if we could just find an Overseer that is actually good at doing paperwork of all things
---
&gt;Some people have a hard time ignoring that push
---
This is a personal problem.  Some gamers like myself enjoy having grinds to work towards.  Some of us do log in and play every day just because we want to.  Players like this should be rewarded for wanting to and for playing the game every day.  
---
Even if you have to log in every day (which you dont because there are double xp and double score weekends to make up for days you missed), it only takes mere minutes every day to complete the challenges.  With the exception of something like increase your overseer rank I am done with all of the challenges every-day within 5-15 minutes of logging in depending on what they are.  This is not a big time investment at all.  Sure, a game like Modern Warfare you don't have to play EVERY DAY as the challenges aren't as important, but you will end up putting in A LOT more game-time to get to 100.  I much prefer the way 76 is doing their pass.
---
Is it better than the stabilised mod for regular arm pieces?
---
You mentioning that reminded me of the best heavy gun I found in Fallout 4. Explosive Minigun. I tossed a tri barrel on that sucker and took down many vertabirds. F those BoS.
---
You can also make your own fusion cores with stable flux too.
---
Enjoy being downvoted for being one of the few reasonable people in this sub instead of circlejerking and complaining about dumb stuff 99% of the time.
---
I share scrapper, travel agent, or inspiration as theres no downside to that.
---
I hate gun-fu. Its disorienting to have my camera snap on vats and drains more ap than I want
---
Edit: literally someone made a post 10 minutes before you saying they hate gun fu. You trolling op?
---
It will probably take him to the first track or junk yard and they are pretty safe :)
---
Valid point, but for those that are at the 50 rank point now, and we’re at Day 23, if they stay on the same SCORE accumulation rate, they are likely to reach Rank 100 with a day or two to spare. 
---
My goal is to spend zero Atoms on Ranks and hit Rank 100 with minimal grinding of 10kXP/100SCORE.
---
I thought that was for the codes? (Never looked myself so could be wrong)
---
A handful of bloodied melee or well built commandos can kill her nearly instantly when she lands. Don't need a glitched weapon.
---
Probably a lot more fixers and handmades out there after the dupe, no reason to dupe glitched weapons and nearly every other weapon you get from mumbles has one of the magic combinations.
---
Farming a nuke on private 
---
Jackwormuk is my psn
---
I feel like that's a waste of Flux..
---
Oh bother....
---
Y'know that most members in this subreddit are English right? We can't really understand what you're tryna say..
---
I misread the post, my bad
---
It’s like 16 square miles. Go get lost and have fun.
---
are these events mega hard as i have a assault keycard
---
Pick up every glue, duct tape, typerwiter, desk fan, rat poison, aluminum can, tin can, military ammo pouch you see.
---
These are your best sources of early game adhesive, springs, screws, lead, aluminum, and ballistic fiber. They are all bottleneck resources for gun/armor/ammo crafting and modding.
---
Visit AngryTurtles youtube channel and watch all of his mutation videos. Mutations are a gamechanger, but you need to understand how they work and how to get or lose them. Marsupial is god-tier.
---
It's come back a couple times, so it will likely again. Just gotta keep an eye out.
---
Emergency protocols.
---
Not everybody has 3 charisma or rank 1 cards. That's ok though, you be you.
---
It's fine, I'm used to it.  Usually, when someone downvotes and doesn't reply to your post it means they just don't like what you have to say even though they know you are right.  That's why they have no argument to reply.  It is what it is.  I just can't wrap my head around complaining about being able to complete easy optional tasks for free stuff.
---
Hate gun fu also
---
Not this time around stopped short of Freestates. I just had the plans found in a stash at the overseer's house, someone dumped.... Had the resources filling my stash, so figured what the hell?
---
eh you know you are trolling, so you get what you get.
---
You’ll do far more damage with power attacks than VATS criticals.
---
Consider adding the empath mutation and Class Freak instead of Lone Wanderer. Empath counts you as your own teammate, so there isn’t a downside provided you are on a team. With Class Freak to reduce the negative effect, you gain damage reduction. If a teammate has empath, it stacks.
---
&gt; Might as well be in Winnie the Pooh’s asshole,
---
Oh bother.
---
Can come join
---
It's not my post =0 
---
They might. Nothing in that post about it. I heard you could get them from treasure maps as well. If they are drops from them the drop chance is probably similar to all the rare outfits.. ludicrously low. So actively hunting for them is the better option.
---
I guess we'll have to see what kind of force shows up, but with all the assaultrons (the only really scary enemy in the whole game) running around the super secure bunker, I don't see them being able to take it. The casualty losses would be insane. 
---
Nevermind the Enclave controls the freaking missle silos
---
Not sure China would view it as bad since the entire franchise is parading through their in game enemies' wasteland after the attack.
---
There are builds that go around the Vault-trash Assisted Targeting System, but yeah. Free aim for the win.
---
It's not hard but you definitely need a group of people to coordinate. I only ever see it fail when someone under level 50 starts it when no one else is around. When the event first starts it gives a 10 minute timer kind of like Radiation Rumble.
---
Tbh after last night I've given up on the event unless I know the people I'm running it with.  I was holding down one side and some db comes over, repeatedly jumping directly in front of me to shoot ghouls. So I throw on the stealth suit to get ore and one of the miners dies in the 20 seconds I'm gone.  i decide to then just go for XP and he keeps jumping in front of me, and completely ignoring the horde to scramble and pick up each 1* lead pipe that drops.  One time I wishwe could PvP during events.
---
Obviously it IS a personal problem, but its one that gets slowly developed by playing games with this kind of development plan.    
---
The time required isn't important.  It's about forming those patterns of behavior in your brain.  Even if it's just 5 minutes (often its more like an hour, and possibly much more if you do the NW ones) that's a pattern of behavior you are being trained on, and if you keep it up for months and months, it's going to get harder and harder to "just ignore it".    
---
Just because other game passes are worse doesn't mean that this one is good.  A lot of other game passes are considerably more player friendly.    
---
The lack of banking is a hallmark of a bad pass system, IMO.  It encourages you to play at on the game's scheduled, not your own.
---
We basically just got that for the handmade.
---
That's brilliant! I launched the game yesterday and found all my Atoms there. Thanks for all you hard work!
---
It's because the server decided that literally all of your damage bonuses no longer apply. I think the server decided that you're no longer sneaking but it still lists you as [CAUTION] locally instead of telling you that you've been spotted.
---
You’re so right. You just wanna delete it but it’s still a lot of fun :(
---
Is the strobe light available from a robot vendor?
---
You can do the dailies in like 30 minutes then just play the way you used to.
---
There are better ways to do these things, and other games do it better.  If you are fine with it, that's cool, but I really feel like players should hold developers feet to the fire a bit more and just accept what they get (especially when it's not well done) a lot less.
---
About 2:30, but depending on traffic.
---
I'd be fine with that too but the fact that they don't introduce many new toys for us to play with makes me think a skin is a higher priority
---
Just the stein case from fasnacht.
---
With your bank account
---
Just to make sure I'm understanding you correctly, what do you mean exactly by "banking"?
---
I also count the scout armor honestly. Of all the NPCs running around in the most horribly mismatched armor combos, I don't think I have ever seen one with scout
---
I do agree though 
---
Give me a MODUS vendor!
---
Workshop = pvp. It's always been that way. You can play on a private if you want privacy.
---
I wanna do PA but I'm so invested into stealth I'll be running a build that's not optimal.... However if respec is ever a thing (as in, a REAL respec) I'm gonna convert my one toon to a heavy gun PA build, with more defensive tendencies (Ie resistance boost on reload, maybe even lean into the 'Supressors' side). Become a true MMO tank. 
---
I wanna take the Queen by the titties, howl out 'Ad Victoriam' and smash her so hard that even Crater can hear it.
---
I dont remember
---
And they jingle!
---
Thanks.  I was busy last night trying to get all my dailies done that I didn’t make it there last night and didn’t make it to WS. Do you know which vendor sells it?
---
That’s actually pretty funny. Removed a lot of the ways players could grief so they’ve figured out new ways. 
---
It just works.
---
What would you change then?  And please dont say just remove it.
---
What about a way a little less expensive and more time consuming?
---
I think if they had added just a little wiggle room to it I wouldn't have minded so much.
---
The fact that you have to complete every single daily and weekly, plus a certain amount of optional ones to have a chance at finishing makes it feel much more like a grind to the casual players. If you miss one day...too bad, you can't make it up. 
---
If they had created a season where you had an extra week or two to be able to finish then players wouldn't feel like it's quite as bad. For example - players who have some other commitment come up, or who are just few up with the grind or whatever...they can take a day or two break and not have to worry about the fact that they can no longer complete the board.
---
I think something as simple as an extra week to finish would have made a world of difference to a lot of players.
---
I'd like to be able to say I'll finish, but I had to work late one or two nights and I don't really play NW to complete those daily missions, though I've done every single other one and I know I'm already too far behind to complete it (currently 5 spaces behind).
---
Ahahaaaa I share bloody mess, I like exploding things
---
I really dislike people like you. You dont HAVE to do any of it. Play something else or shut up. It takes not even an hour to do every daily challenge.
---
Ever considered favoriting the weapon? It'll warn you before you drop it.
---
saw this for the first time with DEEZ on the wall above the display lmao
---
I share good doggy. I hate when they share sun kissed.
---
Never share sun kissed, guys. A lot of the players are bloodied. Unless they ask to, of course.
---
Counterpoint - Scrappy stuff is better and we need more of it.   
---
I know, I'm fighting the curve here, pitching in the wrong field -   
---
But we've got enough clean stuff. Hell, just putting on a layer of rust   
---
would be good enough for me.
---
I think the legendary run would be all that's left.  Hopefully someone knows another method, but its looking like atom farming was nerfed hard.
---
Oh yes good idea to keep eye on him. After all more eyes on things is a good thing.
---
Oh what am i doing with those antennas? Just making sure my uplink is working properl... oh sorry one of them seems to be overheating gotta run.
---
The short answer is no. 
---
You can play daily and advance on the legendary run to get free atoms. But its heavily geared towards you spending those atoms to complete it.
---
Long answer. Nooooooo.
---
I see dumb shit being shared all the time but don’t feel the need to give a damn. 
---
Just grateful they’re even sharing a perk card; plenty of players that don’t bother with the mechanic at all.
---
I like Junkies, it's 50% dmg increase and full health. Easily the best build after bloodied.
---
I see it happen on my private servers when i know for a fact there wasnt any other player about with a energy weapon, so its not *just* the ash pile thing.
---
thank you for this mission
---
With the addition of the new group system you will never have to be solo. So if you are not going for the extra stats from lone wanderer I would pass on that card.
---
Also I suggest looking into bloodied/junkie's build path, which are the best damage paths there are. Other, most (but not all [ those exceptions must be skilfully built and need alot of effort ] ) builds lack damage in the late game, which might be discouraging.
---
PS: If you decide to go bloodied build, it doesn't have to be below 20% to be effective, try going under 40% first and get used to maintaining the rads and keep enemies under control so you don't die, if you get good at this you can step up the game and go below 20% which will give boost in both attack and defense (from perks and mutations). It also work with power armor for the extra defense.
---
PC isn’t any better this morning. I actually had to stop playing because of it. They’ve been pretty bad for a few days, but this morning is exceptional.
---
Like for example, the 5 (originally) daily quests you get, if you weren't able or feeling up to playing that day, they would be "banked" so the next time you log on they would still be there to complete, along with the new ones for that day.    
---
Both games I play with pass systems (Rocket League, and MTG Arena) have banking in some form up to a week, so people who can only play on the weekends aren't just boned from the get go.  It's a not uncommon practice, and shows that the devs have some respect for the personal lives of their players.  Logging in daily or missing out is more a mobile tactic, and you know how little shits those devs give.  Both passes are also much easier to complete, but that's another issue.
---
Thats what you get for backing Brexit.
---
I think it’s all to do with buying or using Atoms to get to the end.  We need to remember Bethesda is a business and needs to make money.
---
You have to hit them 8 more times. Remember, cats have 9 lives.
---
my junkies combat shotgun is a certified one shotter, unless this bug hits
---
Last night after completing an event I just wandered south, found so much cool stuff. I’m new only playing two weeks so far and I love the feel of it. Glad I grabbed it during the last PS sale
---
I don't know. 
---
Army of securitrons vs an army of assaultrons? 
---
My money is on the face laser death machines
---
Ah that’s helpful ty. Didn’t consider PA v Crits.
---
TP to Solomons pond, turn south and slightly west, run a short distance until you encounter a small unmarked pond. There is a Behemoth spawn in it.
---
The second behemoth is at the Abandoned Bog Town workshop. If your char level is 60-70 or higher, they will spawn at L95. Unless someone else lower level has spawned it in by approaching the WS. The closest TP to the Bog Town Behemoth is actually the Pylon just to the east of the Bog Town marker.
---
I always make my camps have more a small village feel, but I've never considered making a central plaza like that. I JUST finished making my camp but I love that idea so much I think I need to move again and incorporate it somehow. You've ruined my day, and I'm thankful to you for it.
---
Well... That's life. One day you'll be a high level player.
---
What are you going to do then?
---
That's 100% reasonable. I'd never, say, make a full suit of power armor, modded or not and hand it to a newbie. That's just cheesy and doesn't really help them in the long run. Giving them a bit of ammo, or maybe a dozen stims and/or radaway, however... That can take a little bit of pressure off of them and make things just a bit smoother, without ruining the whole experience.  
---
But the single most valuable thing I can offer newbies, is knowledge and experience. And I'm glad to offer both if asked.
---
Ty ty this is the kinda thing I was hoping for. Never run melee before
---
Together with PA displays proper usable display shelves is likely the most requested camp item. Currently it just the 3 mediocre glass topped units and a couple of Season/event specials. The Fasnacht Stein case shows they can do open top displays so where are they??? 
---
They have shelves, they have displays...just mix the two for normal plans.
---
In the days when I played a lot more, I organically came across several bits of the code during my play sessions, and yes I agree it is fun to do all that. I have only ever done it once on my own. Mainly because I got so pissed off trying to complete the boot camp mission that I just ran a solo to do it and get the achievement.
---
If I do it myself again, definitely gunna use the nukacrypt guys. No point in running around everywhere.
---
FINALLY an explanation I can get behind - in a world where we can build fusion generators and piece together actual laser guns, we still can't nail up 4x6 drywall to our ceilings.....
---
Thanks for lmk!
---
thanks!
---
Thanks I have two 50% fall dam armor pieces so I don't take any damage I just thought I might be ae to get rid of them. I do love the  falling control you get with bird bones
---
Yep it's a limited time thing in the atom shop, I'm sure it will be back again at some point.
---
They are the antagonists to a very crappy American state, I don't think the Chinese are portrayed worse that the US itself.
---
Now I want a fallout based on China, we have enough of the US.
---
Thanks
---
I haven't played in a while, but would moving the device itself amto a different spot in your camp work, maybe?
---
i share Action Boy. never had anyone complain about faster AP regen, so it seems like a safe thing to sgare.
---
If you are on PC, with single line in .ini file you can disable all gore (aka exploding bodies)
---
In Fallout76Custom.ini, under [General] section, add a line:
---
    bDisableAllGore=1
---
&gt;  I don't want to step into a war for workshops with my fellow dwellers
---
Then don't step into workshop.  
---
You see, yours is a very one-sided point of view. For people who do enjoy fight over workshops, these daily/weekly events are a godsend.
---
Your choice does not matter in this game.
---
Your choice has no consequences.
---
if  you need plastic just raid the watoga school in fallout, you get tons of plastic in there,
---
Not as far as I'm aware, although there's terminals and notes that hint or outright say where and why certain enemies can be found, like West-Tek and the FEV mutants/cryptids.
---
Also, certain Cryptid names can be misleading, the Grafton Monster isn't exclusive to Grafton, and the Flatwoods monster is another that's not limited to Flatwoods.
---
Ah, yeah I don't do mutations or bloody or junkie. Don't know why but I don't like the idea of having a chunk of rads, low health, or reduced skills if something runs out.... and stressing during battles because of it all, lol.
---
I have myself mostly setup for killing things before they become a problem. If this was TF2, I'd be the sniper. Full offensive damage, but garbage defense up close. Legendary Pump Shotgun takes care of most issues up close and still have enough health to get out alive.
---
More than x3 level 60+'s at once detected and I'm screwed unless I have the chance to escape artist.
---
Oh and if I miss and shotgun a car behind my target, I turn into a barf bag.
---
If I know I'm going into a big battle, I'll gear up, but I just didn't feel the power armour love like I did in Fallout 4. Something's off.
---
Like sniper perk on perception.
---
Ooooo ok 👌 thank you I didn't know. When ever I see the  board it looks like zorbo is gona finish any day now lol
---
I have low Charisma so can only share 1 point cards. The only one I have that is useful is Tenderiser, so I share that. Little extra damage hurts noone.
---
Oh yeah.  When in Vats Ill hit, but only one number shows up.  Like one single pellet hit out of all of them? I dont know whats going on.
---
I would absolutely love a MODUS terminal for my camp.
---
actually read the notes and terminals, and listen to holotapes. there's some great lore and plot in there, but so many people miss or skip them.
---
I don't think you are alone. Just a few days ago my photo gallery completely vanished.  No idea why - I don't think I did anything.  It was weird.   PS4.
---
It's p2w
---
that's not breaking it, that's you getting a little extra boost.  You get extra distance, which is the whole point of Marsupial... getting to places you couldnt' before.  I've never heard of a mutey hating Strang in Numbers. You have a very rare perspective.
---
Cause they would rather try to convince us that what we really want and what really sells are utility items.
---
Right.
---
Adding banking like I mentioned would make it much much more palatable for me personally.  Even as little as 3 days would be a big improvement.    
---
That way you could play 2-4 times a week and not feel as though you were just doomed from the get go.     
---
Alternately you could up the XP reward from the 10000 XP gain to 250 rather than 100, to lessen the level of grind you have to do to make up missing time.    
---
Ideally, and this is the way I had expected it was going to be designed when they said (the now obvious falsehood) that they were going to start "rewarding people for things they already do instead of the atom quests" was something like just getting a bit of score for completing events, finishing quests, killing monsters, etc.  Actually day to day game play without any time gates or activity funneling.  Obviously that would be harder to balance, but, it would be the most player friendly and naturally immersive way to do it.    
---
Also one of my biggest gripes are the NW challenges.  Gaining a rank can take HOURS, so it's obviously not worth it unless you were just playing NW anyway.
---
&gt;A handful of bloodied melee or well built commandos can kill her nearly instantly when she lands. Don't need a glitched weapon.
---
True, at least for melee builds. I don't see how a commando build would be able to nearly instakill the SBQ without a glitched weapon since they can't stack damage modifiers from food to hell and back like the melee types can.
---
On the other hand, I rarely see melee builds at the SBQ these days anyway. What I do see a lot lately is a bunch of people in power armor with hacked and duped explosive Gatling plasma guns.
---
That was patched several weeks ago
---
Yeah, I hope there is some reward that replaces the run during seasons.
---
Ugh.... What game was it that had that? I imagine many, Thief did. Oh Dishonoured, that's it. That game was hard at first but once I figured it out, it was a hard fun. Possibilities.
---
I share r1 tendorizer. Since I don't run bloodied nothing really bothers me when someone shares it
---
You ever try to confine a monster to a specific area... they make movies about this stuff for a reason!!
---
I don't know why, but this response just sounds really cool - like a line you hear at a really dramatic point in an action movie.
---
Sheeeeiiiiiiit. I guess I never saw that. Thanks!
---
I'm not sure if there are nuke-specific discords, but there are several fallout ones you could try. I'm in Nukes and Dragons, Fallout 76, and the Reddit Fallout Network. They all have team finding sections for each platform.
---
Exactly what he said. Just create a character, exit the vault, and pick a direction. It’ll all come in time, till then enjoy just exploring. Don’t forget to take time to enjoy some of the absolutely gorgeous scenery too.
---
You mention less fall damage. Not sure if anyone else said this yet but the chinese stealth suit gives like 90% fall damage reduction
---
I had this same problem with both my characters, and after I moved to another house (and a better Internet), the problem stopped on both stealth rifle and shotgunner.
---
It never fails. Not even a 5%.
---
So probably it has something to do with the way Fallout registers shots or something.
---
Same here.  I get tired of just buying them all at one spot.  Is boring.
---
Hump day is the best.
---
(Todd smiles without smiling)
---
total clusterfuck every step of the way
---
Vendors caps. Every day you are entitled to 1400 caps from the vendor by selling things from the world. Junk needs to be bulked at a tinkers bench to sell. Make sure to claim them. It will reset 20 hours from when u first sell something I blv.
---
Make a steel converter. Dump scrap steel in, and get to convert it to springs, gears, screws.
---
Preach it brother.  And I want Biv's jukebox too, Dammit.
---
That sounds cool
---
Because it would require new models and more so than any previous walls. All the current walls are essentially the same dimensions with different visuals while log walls would be far thicker than anything we have now which would cause more clipping issues and need new meshes and everything.
---
Don’t race through the quests. Don’t leave the forest until your level 50. Store your junk and the claim and defend workshops. You might get killed in pvp but you probably won’t and you get a lot of plans, aid, bullets and junk from claiming and then the first defend.
---
Also.
---
Do they remember if you put in a keycard but didnt launch a nuke?
---
Cus, i put in a keycard the other day not realising i had to wait 3 hours (even on a diff world) to launch from same silo.
---
Yet I launch one today and i couldnt put in a keycard. So i still have my keycard.
---
I get that damage bug a lot. I think it's a latency issue. Worst time I had it was at a queen fight on my rifles. Crit her a few times in the face for around 1200 damage but received no loot at the end because the server must have decided that wasn't what happened.
---
They really need to make those shelves into display cases.
---
Take a few perks in melee to begin with.  Ammo seems scarce right away and melee is easy right off the bat.  Later if you spec into guns you can always use the perks in the strength category like bandoleer or other weight related perks and remove the melee if it isn't your thing.
---
Scrap armor and weapons regularly to learn the mods for them.  Make sure you are taking the higher level stuff you find so aren't running around with level 1 armor at level 15-20.
---
Capture and defend workshops to get xp, caps, plans, etc.  Easy way to level up.
---
Join or create a public team for building.  Extra xp when you do anything in the game.
---
Good Luck!
---
Edit: I always recommend new players set up camp right near Morgantown train station.  It's a quick jog to the airport that has tons of enemies and junk you can scavenge.  You can then waddle across the street and scrap all the weapons or sell all them to the vendor bot.  It's an easy way to make some decent caps early on.
---
Pharma farma is a great perk early on as it gives you a better chance of finding chems.  It's another set of perks that you can switch out later on in the Luck category for something that is more useful at high levels.
---
"Nature, it finds a way..."
---
Seriously though, the amount of time I wasted in Flatwoods searching for that Cryptid, before I found one somewhere else entirely...
---
Gun-fu sucks and is slow. Please don’t share that.
---
Is there any buffs for this drain?
---
Why would they make it drain fusion cores at all, when it's not an issue outside of PA? If it doesn't by default improve accuracy or speed or damage or something, then what the actual hell man? That makes zero sense.
---
I get the running and Fusion Cores draining faster, that makes sense because you're trying to move a heavy object fast, but never noticed the AP affected the core via VATS.
---
You forgot having to live at a constant 10-20% Hp, major susceptibility to rad dmg, having to stop and rebalance rads every so often, vulnerability to random assholes equipping rad sponge/the card that resses you at zero rads.
---
And FWIW, its not just serendipity. Its Serendipity (45% dmg avoidance IF you have less than 30% health), Ricochet (18% proj avoidance), and Nerd Rage (IF you have less that 20% health.) Then whatever DR they have from armor or PA.
---
What about making the fly swarm over enemy bodies guaranteed, instant and more visible. Robots can have the same except electrical sparks.
---
You smart.  You make things go.
---
Well the Browning also shoots .30 cal, albeit not carbine, but the M1 is only semi auto where the fixer can be full auto. I know, small difference, but for the skin it would be weird going commando with a semi auto rifle. Don’t get me wrong I’ll wield a dang pipe pistol if it could have an M1 skin lol I just couldn’t help but point out the differences. Definitely need more gun variety especially in a game where gun play is the main draw, at least for me it is. Wish we had like 10 different guns for each class instead just a couple or several.
---
I’ve done it quite a few times during daytime though
---
I had this happen too!! It just spawned when I got to a new location right on top of me. Scared the absolute ~~crap~~caps outta me
---
Ah ok
---
I mean, frames and lag have been pretty bad on Xbox for a long time.  Even though the frames are absolute garbage I never DC from the server but I do CTD every day without fail.  Often multiple times in a day.  The crashes are just out of control.  I am on a Xbox one X with Fallout 76 on an external SSD.
---
Bruh cannibal is a useful perk
---
I wish I could crap caps!
---
That reflection on chrome and mirrored surfaces that has that little house... so Fallout 4
---
Thats what i said
---
They should just tack it onto Cat Eyes so its more useful.
---
Get a Gamma gun and shoot at the ground when you need the rads, a few shots can bring your hp down from 100 to less than 20
---
When you log onto your server, check to see how many high level players (lvl 100+) are on and ensure no other major event is going on at the time. If you believe you can pull at least five or six high level players and some more 50+ players, then go for it. Don't be afraid to grab a pylon or two. Consider wearing power armor since you can quickly stab yourself with stimpaks.
---
Like most mobile game nowdays.
---
I've heard jumping than VATS helps too, something about falling while in VATS realigning the shot
---
I don't if I'd even have the wasteland be part of an adaptation at first if I was writing this project. 
---
First season would start off pre war, bombs drop first episode and then the rest of the season would be in a vault, ripe with politics and vault experimentation. Maybe a subplot with vault AI. 
---
Season 2 would jump ahead like 50 years, with the new generation discovering the experiments and rebelling against the overseer, and ending with them opening the vault to escape. 
---
Then I'd open up with a wasteland plot. 50 years give plenty of time for buildings to decay, animals to mutate and people to ghoulify.
---
I 100% agree with you but, and if you can find the bodies, any at all, and some other player hasn't already killed them in that area in the first place, and you kill them, and can find them...they still may not drop enough even materials (3 diff) to make 1 stable flux and I don't have enough stash space to keep a ton of them on hand (the glowing mass is like 2 or 3 lbs or something, it's absurd). 
---
I get why people dupe stable flux I guess. The Beth method is just too stupid. You could legit do it the hard way and potentially not come away with even 1 stable flux at the end at all. Pointless.
---
Go get card, go through robot fights, launch, go to area, kill all stuff (if its even there in the first place - half the time or more I go the area with the pink trees and literally NOTHING is there alive or dead) and FIND the bodies (if you can), then hope you find enough of the 3 diff materials. If you found 3 diff materials, now go gather the flux. Yippy, now you can go make maybe 100 special bullets. This is dumb. Completely dumb...
---
public events spawn randomly every hour on the hour, and half past too right? uranium, tee time, heart of the swamp, guided med, free range, lode, etc.
---
I also have Xbox one x with external ssd. I have 200 mpbs for internet and the random crashes are annoying. Like when it popped up and said disconnected from server I wanna know why? My internet was fine the server never crashed because I was able to get back into the same world. It’s just sad and I love the game but when stuff like that happens it is so disheartening
---
Currently on my 2nd month in this game, MODUS is till top of my chart.
---
If I'd ever have to choose sides between Brotherhood and the Enclave, well... Let's just say it won't be as hard of a choice for me.
---
Maxson is a good guy, a visionary, and a good leader. Doesn't change the fact that Taggerdy really screwed the pooch after the comms broke down.
---
Pehaps We'd get a chance to talk to this... Maxson. We're always on a lookout  for new... members.
---
Exactly.  I just hit level 39 last night and I joined a public team and traveled down to the bottom right of the map and went hunting with a guy who was level 190 something.  He and I stuck together and if I fell behind he waited for me.  He helped me kill my first Scorched beast and then we did the Imposter Sheep Squatch event (I think it was called corrupted data) I died several times but I kept coming back eager to show these 3 guys who are all high levels that I am not here to get "free" loot.  After it was all over they each stopped by my camp and purchased a few things and then dropped me a couple of items for a job well done lol.
---
Your concentrated fire numbers are waynoff. Its like 1-3% if that.
---
But anyways, vats shines because you can land headshots constantly, and you get to have critical hits which ignore armor.
---
100% agree that there should be a perk that increases damage while aiming, maybe like a 10,15,20% boost for ADS.
---
Another super helpful one would be the chance to score critical hits out of vats. Something like 5,10 and 15% chance would be amazing, have it in the luck category and applicable to all weapons.
---
These would be great legendary perks aswell.
---
It has no benefits. It just does it. No clue why.
---
Im just in aww because you actually pulled it off
---
It *was* a feature that got removed.
---
Yes Please AND the Stairs foundation and Stairs Upper Floor from Fallout 4.
---
Oh damn, well that would explain this, there's me obsessing over that setting. So there is no way to turn off these notification, unfortunate.
---
Oh well, just have to put up with it. Thanks for the heads up 😎👍
---
Trap camps make this a no no
---
You can roughly choose where you spawn in by placing your module in certain places. You should roughly spawn in a northerly direction of it.
---
For public teams, I enjoy playing my 15 Charisma team build, set to share the highest level perk cards across Score. Ironclad is a fun one at LVL 5, Lucky Break LVL 3 because it works well but hard to always commit to, same for Suppressor LVL 3, and Class Freak for those teams I more commonly run with.
---
Any perk cards that negatively affect builds (bloodied being the most sensitive) are a big no - Sun Kissed as you mentioned, Rad Sponge, even Lifegiver can sometimes play rough for bloodied (leave the team, instantly drop in health).
---
The fixer is an unique combat rifle which means combat rifle mods learned can be used on it.
---
High level scroched has combat rifles which you can scrap for mods. (Events like Line in Sand, Air to air, Distant thunder has scroched as enemies)
---
I've found that going into VATS for a split second before firing seems to work pretty well. Almost as if the percentage is calculated at 95% then down to what it should be. If VATS doesn't work immediately, I cancel out and try again.
---
Thanks for that, I shan't bother trying to find it then.
---
Off to enjoy my large box of white wolf fedoras 😎
---
\*Literally nothing in the way or connected\*

"Cannot place item. Selected item is floating."

Which brings us to a new perk! "Golden Eggs: Hjönk Hjönk am goose, occasionally "find" a capsule filled with 25 caps"
---
That's why i said apparently =0 
---
I haven't paid enough attention to the time of day when i've done it
---
&gt;If I'd ever have to choose sides between Brotherhood and the Enclave, well... Let's just say it won't be as hard of a choice for me.
---
Indeed.
---
&gt;Maxson is a good guy, a visionary, and a good leader. Doesn't change the fact that Taggerdy really screwed the pooch after the comms broke down.
---
Not so sure on that one though, Taggerdy had a plan of attack, one that we ended up using ourselves - Nuke the bastards - Maxson explicitly forbade her from using Nukes, dooming the entire chapter and region.
---
The only way we made Appalachia safe enough to live in again was by using the nukes against the SBQ.
---
You can save time by going straight to the med bay, head to the card maker, grab the card from that room then clear and write the card.
---
I can hear the ambient music just from looking at a picture of Doc Mitchell's house
---
Sadly I tried that :/ the module has to be replaced fully before it will apply the skin :/
---
Share: Suppressor, Tenderizer, Cannibal.
---
Hate: Cannibal.
---
 The reason for Cannibal being one I both share and hate, is that if nobody's in Cranberry Bog (damn trenches), it's a great perk for healing and hunger. 
---
But if I'm in the Bog, I unequip it, so if somebody else shares it, it's a pain in the arse.
---
Yup this is what people want now a days they want everything handed to them with little to no effort. And I personally think the season has been so easy I dont understand how people are still complaining it's to hard to finish I just hit 85 last night before bed and I no alot of guys that are either done or at least ahead of me.
---
Also on xbox one x.  I've noticed lag and disconnects, seemingly increasing over the past week.  Back of my mind, I'm curious if they've added some type of tracking code that will alert to possible duping, exploiting, etc.  Don't worry, I'll go put on my tin foil hat, now.
---
From what I have read, and may be wrong. Sneak caps at 90% and each pc of armor adds 25% (but doesnt seem to stack with other pcs?)
---
The sneak perk 3 gives 75% so one pc of armor w sneak would put you at cap. I have tested whole sneak suits with and without the sneak perk and it is noticable. 
---
Long story short, the perfect set seems to be all unyielding + wwr - three pc ap refresh two pc poison resist. One pc could be changed out w chameleon+sneak (i do)
---
Misc structures, right?
---
Miscellaneous structures
---
What about good doggy?
---
I wasn’t aware there was more than one module skin! Which makes it even more frustrating that they probably have gotten similar feedback when they released those skins and still went ahead with it.
---
get this man some upvotes
---
Go into settings and turn on pacifist. That way you won’t accidentally engage in pvp.
---
There's a Terminal on the second floor of the Fire Department, you can "download" them from there. They are automatically learned once you download them.
---
And thats why I never will use it. The bug is one thing that I can live with... but I never will remove my camp. My wife and I built it with a lot and lot of fun hours, but we never have the will, nor the power, to rebuild it from scratch.
---
You can but I'm not hiring at that moment, so if you still wanna do it, you're doing it and I ain't paying you lol
---
Already use that perk anyway but i share cannibal because a low or high levels gotta eat
---
Well shit, I guess I dodged a bullet with that one, many thanks for letting me know!
---
there's a weapon (shepard's crook) that has a cowbell on it. 
---
(swings weapon)
---
(cowbell noise)
---
I was just saying this the other day.
---
The one in sams grinders is a 50/50 chance to be either a wendigo or a glowing ghoul. The one in lewisburg is pretty much fixed.
---
Agreed, and I haven't even joined the Enclave yet. I'm holding off on doing that in case it affects Steel Dawn or Fractured Steel though, I'd rather be on the Brotherhood's good side
---
You can cripple the ghouls and no more spawn, unless the scavengers kill them. But going solo you still can only get so much ore.
---
Oh I totally do not mind, go ahead, the club is always open \*cough\* as in whenever I'm online that it lol  
---
Don't fret, the Nuka Strip! is gonna be there for awhile, I'm not taking it down anytime soon (Too lazy and time consuming to build another CAMP project anyways)
---
Sorry, you getting downvoted to hell. Too many wheels in motion, it can't be stopped.
---
Rifleman will out damage commando per bullet but commando will out damage rifleman in dps.
---
The only way to stuff it up is if the scavengers get killed.
---
Inspirational. Moved a charisma point without thinking about it and spent my next level up to put it back to 9 just to be a nice teammate
---
It’s apparently bugged because the Fixer doesn’t even have an appearance tab. They are different weapons I agree, although visually the only difference is the furniture color. The Fixer probably has a line in its code that says something like ‘ModStatus=GetFromCombatRifle’ so whatever you unlocked for combat rifle you have it on the fixer.
---
If I'm on a team of people and others keep getting kicked, I leave that team. You're just screwing your teammates over by not having a full team. Big deal, they're not sharing a card, you AND YOUR TEAM are benefitting from having them there.
---
I want that Nuka-Cola grasshopper standee and the model Vault-Tec van that the Overseer has.
---
(Todd writes "no" on a chalkboard, then Todd circles it)
---
And again, you can carelessly/accidentally dismiss the warning as I stated above.
---
Carnivore &gt; herbivore imo. Meat is far more easy to come by. And there are also things like the pepperoni roll you can pick up at the Wayward that let you get a +60 carry weight buff for an hour or so. AFAIK, vegans dont have any +carry weight recipes.
---
Having said that, they do both have their own 20% xp recipes. And the herbivore soups grant food/water both, which is a decent convenience. But id still go carnivore 11 times out of 10.
---
Wait there are worth something? How much are we talking about here?
---
Yeah! I wasn’t trying to sound bitchy or anything sorry lol! I was just saying :)
---
What for? Food is easy and cannibal gives you more rads from what I recall, and can interfere with looting if you aren't used to it, which someone posted that that is why they troll people with sharing it.
---
That’s ok, I don’t think this is aimed at non-german speakers.
---
Ok, it looked like a present maybe. As soon as the bombs went off it looked like power armor just teleported on top of this box. I should have gave the whole set up a better look afterwards. It was like being fast talked by a flim flam man, it all happened so fast and I thought I was potentially dead.
---
Would be nice...
---
Neither was. i That's why i was doing the =0 face
---
You can tank the 'splosion with 3* Fireproof...unless the perk glitches, as is the custom in FO76 now.
---
Thanks for the offer but I’m on Xbox, but any info is much appreciated
---
Ah never thought of that i just use it as free food and rads
---
Nice description! I've been doing this, but in a more haphazard sense. My armor is not consistent in that it's not all leather or all wood, but a mix of each, so it does take a bit of experimenting between different armor pieces and underarmor to get at exactly 0 DR.
---
I tend to go Ultralight on all my armor pieces just so that I can carry more with the exception of the chest which gets Dense (Zealot's and Troubleshooter's). Takes a bit to get used to swapping pieces in and out all the time, but it eventually becomes a habit.
---
Was that when you reached level 5? That’s when you can engage in pvp.
---
I use travel agent as my shared perk is 
---
 That even benefititul to the team
---
Fire in the Hole. Throwing arc is such an underrated asset
---
Yea it makes you a horrible person. Im disgusted. If im playing and randomly see you teleport near me and then just like that your gone, I know what you just did, and i will be looking for you...
---
That is funny as I have them and read them, but didn’t know they are rare.  I also sell them when I get them for like 500, but had no idea how rare they are.  No wonder they sell so fast.
---
There have been countless post on this.. it's like we are not heard at all. We all wish for this simple qol addition
---
Pocket Weiner Surprise.
---
I know! No worries mate :) sometimes comments on the internet sound way different than intended
---
What console where you on? Cause I did 3 nukes in a row on Xbox
---
Didn’t know you could turn that on, I had gone into that mine and when I came out there was a group of 4 players and it said i was taking reduced damage until I fired back one of them had a sledge hammer looking thing with a flame coming out of it so after them all shooting at me I fired back and died super quick so I really don’t wanna be doing pvp atm, I just wanna lvl up and get some decent weapons and armour
---
Sorry, PS4.
---
Ha!  Seriously though the scrap box is a great tool.  But now I I am still just filling up my stash with scrip :)
---
Her leadership was flawed. Even to the point she disregarded, or rather disobeyed, the last piece of advice given by Maxson.
---
She failed to work with the Responders, with the Free States ... with anyone. Her "thunder" became the most hated and least trusted faction of Appalachia. Demmanding "tributes"for f's sakes ....
---
It was probably her choices and leadership that, in the end, spelled doom of the former surviving factions. Be it her own Thunder, Responders, Firebreathers, Free States (ugh)...
---
And walls for the garage door.
---
Though now re-reading they didnt have issue with finding the garage door lmfao.
---
I’ve asked public team members and it’s been split: 1/3 were new players that didn’t know about sharing (they do now), 1/3 had not put 3 points into Charisma, and 1/3 normally play solo and forgot or shuffle perk cards around and forgot.
---
Ah dang lol, well either way we both did scorched earth 3 times 😂
---
HTD doesn't stack: /r/fo76/comments/hvgwb5/proof_sneakhtd_harder_to_detect_while_sneaking/
---
a single piece does help, a lot, even if you have the sneak perk maxed at 3. so I'd recommend going with it and then sourcing other AP regen pieces as they're easier to get.
---
You are probably right.
---
I didn't mention bodies underground
---
Yes it musta been 5 cause that’s what lvl I was on when I went on my Xbox today
---
Please also don't share Starched Genes 2. That's pointless. People will either have that on permanently or not at all...
---
Taking rads gives you a small chance to mutate. Mutations have a positive affect and a negative affect. One of the coolest ones is Marsupial  which gives you -4 Intelligence BUT you get to jump SUPER high. Taking radaway or running through a decontaminator will likely remove a mutation, but there are perks that prevent you from losing them (Luck) and even boost their strength (Charisma).
---
Never fear. Once you hit 50 you can pick specific perk or move a point every level up.
---
A STR build is perfectly viable. most powerful build in the game at the moment is unarmed bloodied i believe. So you could use a shotgun and melee. 
---
If you go shotgun you can get the gauss shotgun from the settlers though. That gun is wizard AF.
---
Like 1 point
---
Follow the conversation. The person I RESPONDED too, mentioned bodies falling underground, and that using the camera won't help.
---
That's what was being talked about, and you entered that conversation.
---
Expected a dick
---
It sounds like an old timey western movie richochet. (Its literally the sound of a winchester rifle ricochet.)
---
But every time you hear it, that is a bullet you *didnt* take in the face.
---
Bethesda is a "AAA" company, that's not the problem. The problem is, Bethesda handed the game off to their Houston studio which has no prior experience with online games or the creation engine. In essence, they have moved on from this game it appears.
---
Well that’s ironic! Nope hadn’t noticed that
---
It is designed to reward players based on the level of effort they are willing to give.  If you are a hardcore player, you'll get to 100.  If you are a semi-dedicated casual, maybe you'll get to 50.  If you play once a week, even less than 50.  I don't have a problem at all with that, for once it seems Bethesda has designed something that doesn't cap out in just a week or two and rewards dedication.  Yeah, its grindy as hell, but at least I have a purpose other than holding Ward's hand every day.  If a person doesn't play enough to make it to the end, then they don't deserve any end run rewards.
---
You know he has basically nothing to do with the game, right?  They're making Starfield, FO76 was handed off to Bethesda Game Studios Austin. I know everybody here loves to hate on Howard, but his total involvement in this is mostly just announcing it at E3...
---
You are not screwed, you can respec as you lvl up more. I recommend you stick to The weapon you like the most and picking perks specifically for that type for now. Then as you lvl up more you can take perks for other weapons and start switching.
---
It can take a while to finish tho
---
I've sumbited it -- though its very unlikely anything will ever come out of it XD
---
I've missed out on dozens of legendary weapons because I can't find the corpse after sniping the SOB from a distance.  Berry Mentats highlight the living, surely they can make a counter chem to this.  Or better yet, a perk.
---
A feature I miss from RDO, going into eagle eye and unlooted corpses flash for you to find. I'd love to see something like that.
---
Also, after I've picked what I want from the meat pile, despawn that shit.
---
Work on it now get the ball rolling have some high levels to help you out are you on pc?
---
I **had** been working towards a pistol VATS build, but abandoned it for a PA heavy gunner build instead.  Glad I did now...
---
Yeah just go into your settings and turn it on. Then no matter how much others shoot at you they can't hurt you. (outside of a workshop). Most people will not be so rude though. The majority of high level players will give you gifts at best or ignore you at worst
---
*schwoompf*
---
I have a TSE Gatling gun.  When both shots hit I get 3 damage numbers.    They are almost always the same.  On the queen at point blank range I will get 23 23 23.
---
I have had several Gats.  I keep coming back to this one.
---
nobody knows how sneak works exactly. the variables are hardcoded into the executable and dataminers haven't reversed it to find exactly what they are. saying sneak caps at 90% is an educated guess at best because most things cap at 90%, but how do you cap something that may not even be entirely based on numbers?
---
HTD makes you sneak better by an unknown amount, not 25%, 15%, etc. but it's a considerable amount. and no, it does not stack.
---
not exactly the weapon shops of Isher, but it will have to do
---
Oh I didn’t even notice who the OP was on the linked post. My apologies. But look into the recipe sources. I want to say I’ve gotten them from event rewards as well.
---
Never used VATS in FO76, found it sub-par to previous versions of FO. I'm more accurate without VATS.
---
Your best option to be in a workshop is stealth. If you don't want to be 'insta-killed' just stay crouched while you're claiming the workshop so you won't be holding up a signpost on the map that says to 'Come Here &amp; Kill Me.'
---
In general AI systems should be damn creepy.
---
I've done most of it during nighttime, but not all.
---
A couple months ago I met a guy from Australia who was playing on an Asian server and we had a lot of fun together. We actually play games together almost everyday now.  I asked him what Vegemite was once and said i really wanted to try so he sent me some and snacks too! I sent him a bunch of Japanese snacks in return for his kindness.  I would have never gotten to be friends with him if it wasn't for this game.
---
Mole Miners used to be people, and they drop glowing meat that people just cook and eat like it's NBD. #justsaying
---
It is pointless to share it
---
I never use vats when enemies are a certain distance from me. If their far away ofc I’ll use vats because of the accuracy.
---
Iron sights is much better then vats in dealing damage consistently for auto weapons because the vats drain is huge.   
---
You could build a vats build but imo it’s a waste of perks which could be used for something better unless you just suck at aiming then it’s fine.
---
You are talking about the wastelanders quest while you get the ultracite from the brotherhood portion of the main quest.
---
You could also use the Vault Boy cardboard cut outs to point towards your vending machine.
---
Boring. Gimme one that scales to my group.
---
I wanna fight a level 400
---
I think I might do that, get them printed and framed.
---
Appreciate it, and agree those numbers I pulled from diff sources - I am no dataminer. Sneak is sneaky in the game forsure, was hopin to save OP the pain of building an uny+sneak set like I did 😂
---
Or join and ask one of the higher levels to give/make you something. No, I’m not giving you some of my 30 fusion cores cause I need them for *things*.
---
Oh that sounds pretty cool.  I will have to look into that.  Good to know about the respec option as well.  Thanks!
---
Worst thing is u cant hit players in vats anymore... only the fckin Railway piece of sh rifle works. Choo-choo...
---
When im forced to take workshops for my daily score at least someone has to die for my effords.
---
Or re u planning to add vats vs. players as a feature for foodbuilds 1st?
---
Fix ur fckin game Bugthesda!
---
Square camp spaces yes please! That would be an incredible convenience in terms of building. Same with foundation snapping to the corners to take full potential of the space.
---
I honestly don't think it would be difficult to implement. I mean there are workstations out there with squared off build sections. Unless camps somehow follow some bizarre rule set in terms of building areas.
---
Gauss weapons are not energy weapons though, they fire magnetically accelerated projectiles.
---
Solar and thorn are always 3*
---
Should give your gun an outline like the mobs have while in vats, that only the player can see
---
Pretty much i was asked by a level 56 to give him my scout mask because it was his birthday . I told him to go away
---
True, but they make more than enough money that ploys like this are generally pretty poor. The argument that they need to make money always falls flat.
---
I play a few online games and they tend to be FAR more generous with their time on events...events are generally not designed as money makers, but to get people playing more. You want more interest to help drive up the number of people playing more...creating an event that most just won't be able to finish and some obviously feel is burning them out just to try and get people to buy atoms at the end isn't a good plan.
---
I play STO, ESO, used to play NW. Star Trek Online has one of the best systems I've ever seen. They have an event to get a top tier ship or another special game currency. To complete you need 2800 points over the course of 4 events...each of the 4 events also has it's own smaller rewards like a drone for your captain or special armour etc. Each sub-event can be completed by playing 14 days of events out of the 21 days it runs for...so you get a full week of extra time. If you play the full event you can earn just over 1000 points on the main event, so you can complete the main event in just 3 out of the 4 monthly events. They give tons of time to allow for players to play at a reasonable pace. This happens on all of their events.
---
I think Bethesda just has a poor design with regards to events...they see it as a way of trying to generate money instead of a way of drawing in and engaging players. Showing goodwill to players is a good way to get them to spend a little money. Look at how disenfranchised some players are becoming over the problems just now, not to mention those who are fed up with the event instead of enjoying it and being engaged.
---
The argument that Bethesda is a business and needs to make money is a poor one when their practices can actually do more harm than good. A happy and engaged player base is a player base that will spend money on your product.
---
No one is nowhere near rank 80 without buying ranks with atoms or glithing xp
---
Did you change an armor piece, specifically one with ‘reduce damage by 15% while blocking?’ It sounds like you had a magic shotgun that is now no longer magical.
---
And perk loadouts are coming at some point. I ASSUME you can just move points around all willy nilly then
---
We like to call it "chicken of the mine".
---
The main questline: It's pretty easy but also easy enough to get stuck on as well in a few parts so I would look up a video of that if you need it, sometimes it's just finding the location on the map because the markers are hard to see.
---
Technically there are 2 portions, one is the gold heist and the other has to do with the "enclave". If you continue on through the main quest you are introduced to both, honestly I don't remember a ton about the enclave portion. I would still look up a video of both if you dont have an issue with doing it like that.
---
When leveling up, try to guage the perks you are taking, some of them are horrible, others are great. I reccomend looking up videos for that too so you arent wasting points on useless perk cards. You can eventually get all of them but you definitely wont want them all. 
---
Pay attention to the level of weapons you get when you pick them up. 
---
Get the scrapper perk as soon as possible
---
Keep as much junk as you can, look up what junk you can bulk to save room, not all of it does. 
---
Learn every plan you can, sell the other ones in the vending machines. I personally price all plans at 20, except for armor and weapons at 50 and power armor at 100. 
---
Dont turn in scrips until you get to level 50 or close to level 50, and dont worry much about farming legendarys until then. Sure get them when they show up but dont work too hard to get them. Be aware that the scrip limit is 1000.
---
I dont have much else, hopefully most of what I said is new.
---
Yes always 3*
---
 Just made myself a set not that long ago and absolutely love it.
---
That's the kind of wholesome stuff that makes me really happy 76 has the community it does.  
---
I'm a firm believer in the "teach a man to fish, he'll eat forever" philosophy. And it's good to know others are doing just that.
---
Strange in numbers or scrapper ftw. In my case
---
I hate that.  But it does not do it with a scope
---
I dont need more wood, steel, or rubber. Scrapper is not something that everyone should have on permanently. It s niche card that takes valuable int slots.
---
they need to work on plasma goo and ash piles covering all the good loot
---
(Todd face)
---
One of my favorite parts of public teams has been experiencing perk cards that I've never incorporated into my build and/or didn't even know existed. I'm excited for the first time someone shares cannibal so that I may partake in the unholy consumption of oozing, smelly scorched flesh!
---
I know and I hate using a scoped full auto
---
If they implement it, it will be a new machine you build in your camp which has several layers of menus to select which type of creature you wish to find. You have to select the exact right name. It will them add a circular zone to the map and a radio frequency to your pip boy which you have to tune in to while in the map zone. Then you will simply have to follow the signal percentages until you locate the desired body, or one of the exact same name. Rinse and repeat! Couldn't be easier.
---
Actually I have tested this.  Watched a radtoad eat 2-3 fireflies, then killed him.  He only had 1 fluid.  I think they just spawn with a predetermined amount up to 4.
---
Power User mitigates fusion core drainage
---
But that would mean Flatwoods and Morgantown are constantly getting burned to the ground.
---
Quick! Sell the account on eBay!
---
I've noted a ton of challenges I have completed on the PS4, mainly basic ones that would have completed early on that haven't shown completion on my PS4. I've been playing since beta so there is no  way they weren't completed.
---
Good lord ur cheap! Like there re many ways to spend caps anymore... XD
---
Last night I had no fo1st but it said it expired the next day, I just cancelled it and resubbed, it didnt bill me righr away but I go the sub back. Also had a bunch more atoms than I should.
---
Agreed.   I hate when I hit it accidentally.   But in a jam it could come in handy.  Definitely worth it to always have some stable flux on hand.   You can always sell it in your vendor too.
---
I share rad sponge if no bloodied builds are in my group, otherwise tenderizer, travel agent, or Strange in Numbers
---
Ya I noticed my pump shotgun &amp; hunting rifle are perfectly accurate in VATS but when I swapped the rifle guy to a Gauss rifle for a few it was missing ridiculously.
---
Why is this still an issue.
---
Vats should have been more of an aim assist in this version of fallout , showed where to lead target , where critical hit areas are with perks.  I only use vats for shotguns and my lmg at 95% max range and they hit every time
---
Nuclear Winter actually takes place after the main storyline. 
---
All those nuclear circles are from the bombs being dropped by the players. Morgantown got fucked because yet another asshole needed to spawn farm ghouls at Whitespring 
---
This game has a weird timeline due it being a  multiplayer game
---
No you cannot 
---
Even if you can place the blueprint, which is rediculously difficult, the walls will be spawned at 90 degree angles instead of the rounded angles you built originally
---
I get the impression that selling skins for the CAMP Module was decided long before the actual functionality was.  This was technically a problem back with the Settler and Raider add-ons for Wastelanders too.  It feels like someone quickly hacked together a stopgap measure to allow it, with no regard for practicality or bugs... perhaps the same someone who thought the Ammo Convertor was a well-made system. 😋
---
The pauses aren't for dramatic effect, there is an explanation available for what happened to his ... shining personality. I won't spoil it for you, member.
---
I have 300
---
Take a look in your scrap box, the stuff you have the least of is probably worth the most. Common stuff like steel goes for 1 cap, uncommon like acid goes for 5, rare like circuits can go for 10. Depends on the buyer and how bad they need it
---
I know the terminal, you get the basic schematics there. Did they change that with Wastelanders, or was it always that way?
---
Vats is pretty finicky right now (better than it used to be though)
---
Try playing around with timing after activating vats, i use lever rifle, there is a sweet spot in the timing as soon as you activate vats that you will almost always hit. To soon, and you'll always miss, to late and it seems to actually work like its supposed to and go off percentage. 
---
And if you are getting the never hit bug, leave vats and reactivate it once or twice, always fixes it for me.
---
This really needs to be fixed though, its a key aspect of the game, there is no excuse for a core gameplay mechanic to be so unreliable.
---
Point them out to RifleGaming, he likes to make youtube vids of him nuking vendor greifers camps.
---
I had no clue how to make one. Thank god there's one in the atom shop this week.
---
Thanks, and I definitely plan on getting that fireplace.
---
yeah, me too. spent a ton on a wood uny/sneak set way back when.
---
wish I'd checked before. oh, well.
---
No idea. My first toon did it a few weeks after launch. My second toon I did it like a week ago, so I have no idea what may have changed.
---
You can knock dailies out pretty quickly once you find reliable sources for things like terminals, cryptids, etc
---
I have *heard*, but cannot confirm, that pipe revolvers can benefit from pistol and rifle perks if you mod it with a stock. Its one of those things ive been meanign to check for ages but always forget to do when i log in.
---
I've been sharing Light Footed. It's not a huge bonus, but I figure it gives people an option they might otherwise not have had.
---
Not sure I've seen anything shared that I hated as yet.
---
I’m starting to wonder if it’s something with that combination doing something to the vats system. I have a bloodied plasma caster with 33% vats hit chance and I hit the 95% shots.
---
It depends on which character I'm playing, what is in my group already, and what's being shared.
---
I normally share either Gunsmith 5, Adrenaline 5 (I don't now because it's broken, but will go back to it later), or Bodyguards 4 in a full group.
---
On my 9 charisma characters, I share Inspirational 3, Tenderizer 3, Glow Sight 3, or Bloody Mess 3.
---
On my 6 charisma characters I usually share Magnetic Personality 2 or Fireproof 2.
---
Out of all 20 characters across 4 accounts, 6 is my lowest charisma, so I don't have any level 1 perks to share.
---
I don't ever bother sharing Strange in Numbers. I assume if you have mutations that you're using that, even with 1 charisma. If you're not, you should. I do sometimes share Strong Back but not often.
---
I really hate when the only guy with Bloodied is sharing Radicool. I mean, why? Same when I see Need Rage. Bloodied builds are all going to be using this anyway, and it's not helping any of the non bloodied builds.
---
In case you don’t know, certain legendary effects make shotguns damage in VATS 4 times higher than it should be. Armor pieces like the one I mentioned make all shotguns magical. Some shotguns are inherently magical; e.g, shotguns with 50% limb damage.
---
god damn pakleds
---
 u/Ladydevann  your thoughts on this?
---
Fantastic!  I have one of those.   Thanks so much.
---
Not ture at all I'm at 85 and I haven't used any glitches or bought any levels but to be fair I was outta work for 11 days waiting on covid testing
---
Are you aware that you can pay 150 Atoms for some of the spaces that reward 150 Atoms? That's [a free rank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY) effectively. 
---
No one's making you do the challenges, and some of them you can complete multiple ones at once depending on what you choose. For instance, a few days ago there was the Kill Scorched and Kill a Legendary Creature, I wiped both of these challenges out at the same time by going to Forward Station Delta out in the Cranberry Bog, legendary scorched beast and plenty of scorched, boom, 2 challenges gone. 
---
The Build 10 objects, walls or whatever, in a workshop challenge, you can wipe that out fast by having a pre-made blueprint. I threw down the blueprint for [my pavilion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTjEIwu9LUjNYLp8EE89PUwOwAoBkkku/view?usp=sharing) in a workshop and it wiped that challenge out instantly. 
---
You can be smart about doing these things, and even use the main story to complete some of them. Don't get wrapped up in the 'fear of missing out' play your game how you want to play it.
---
The number of times I've lost the legendary wolves in that event when I'm farming scrip is too damn high.
---
Download some mods from Nexus that highlight corpses.
---
Ill try to do it again, lel
---
Personally I run less than 6 chrisma so they get what they get since I am limited to rank 1 perk cards. I generally share strange in numbers, but I'm definitely not going to rank 1 serendipity to share it.
---
Play how you want to play, share what you want to share, and if you don't like what I share, find another group. Don't tell me how to play, and I won't tell you how to play. Entitled gamers these days, geez. Lol
---
Yes, i got a crap two star rifle a few days ago.
---
[all that is missing is your head rotating when you sitting in your chair as someone gets out of the bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITOrKb5HP6s)
---
Supremely Viable.
---
Some people have VATS rifle builds and Gun Fu turns them into Neo from the Matrix. Source: am someone with a VATS rifle build who thinks maxed out Gun Fu is mighty nifty.
---
No.
---
Ok thanks.
---
You can scrap your plants and get the necessary ingredients to replant your plants. Scrap a Tato, get a Tato!
---
Same here. I've killed her numerous times and I can never get that challenge to complete. I'll be watching to see if it's fixed in the next few days. The SBQ is bugged in so many ways.
---
I have so many plans I need to buy, not to mention the lucky armor and weapons being sold by player venders, damned straight I'm conserving my caps!
---
Well you see I have plenty, I'm trying to get more. The question wasnt for a case of me trying to sell it was more that I'm trying to trade weapons and armors for certain junk and want to set a base for how I value each item so no feels I change per customer. I can understand that it all just depends on how bad I need it like you might say but I'm trying to set a standard that can be agreed upon between myself and the people I trade with.
---
Thanks for your input though.
---
Yeah I don’t know, but I hope it gets fixed soon.
---
I recommend sneaking until you know your way around. Once you know the way and what to do you can run in and complete things before they respawn, but it isn't easy to figure out what you are doing while being constantly attacked.
---
Junkie is amazing. No compromises on health or anything, really. I tank damage like a beast and I dish it out even heavier. My only issue is that my charisma has been nuked so I cannot share perk cards while on teams.
---
yeah it sucks!
---
Crazy hours gaming then, sad but i believe it 😅
---
Oh I like this one.  Right now, Night Vision and Awareness perks are pretty useless.  I regretted spending the points immediately.  (Awareness is at least useful for research.)  It'd be cool to have them outline corpses in red outlines, like the Targeting HUD mod for power armor helmets does for live targets.  Not sure what that would do with gore piles, but those are easier to find anyway (buzzing flies).
---
I am such a high level right now (272) that the fast way to get the level up daily completed is to start a new character and sprint to the Wayward. otherwise, it takes me about 3 days of completing the daily score and bullion quests to level up once.
---
I am pretty sure this is not how the game was meant to be played.
---
I can only imagine the shock people get the moment they want to jump away from a ghoul corpse only to instead start eating it. Priceless... (Jumping = Space = Eat Corpse on PC btw).
---
What a mad lad
---
Might as well get an erect penis in game to match my erect penis out of game when I think about hitting the command to “eat corpse”.
---
Its just a joke man, relax
---
When was this?
---
Probably for the daily challenge, buy something from a player/sell something to a player.
---
Well if you play PA the right way, that is with right perks, ADS heavy weapons + Stabilized, you're definitely not gonna need any VATS and the drainage becomes non-issue.
---
Like the guy above says, you need a build, then it makes sense.
---
This was yesterday on PS4
---
I never had an issue with vats until the last update. And not only have vats been less accurate but there has been a whole lot of hp jumping back up. I can hit a scorched for 50% and then it jumps back to 75% or worse, you do a kill shot, you see that hp drop to 0 then back up to 75%. Happens about 1/5 mobs for me since the patch, never happened prior.
---
Awesome let me know when you get on :)
---
Haha nice, to me it doesn't matter what perk card my teammates are sharing
---
Yes!! So glad to hear that :D
---
Quad, all day.
---
Around the morning?
---
Ps4 name by the way is juicyjake233. I’ll be on around 630 hit me up!
---
I think it was between 12 PM and 2 PM
---
😔
---
That's consistent with my speculation on why it happens, though.  Specifically, the latency in how the server perceives the relative positions of the player and the enemy, versus how the client sees it.  The closer an enemy gets to you, the easier it is for them to move outside of the player's targeting cone.  And VATS just can't update in time to reflect this.
---
Likewise, it's also why I can sometimes land shots on Ghouls that have completely run around corners.  Or why it's next to impossible to melee an enemy that is running away from you.  There's some kind of physical disconnect where the attack looks clean on the player's end (hence why you see the damage numbers), but the server rejects it because it doesn't see it the same way.
---
Yes please!
---
Absolutely! My DM's are open, although if you're having the same issue it should be resolved soon, we are sending on emails now :)
---
Thank you!
---
For Toddsake who is Howard?
---
Do you know if the two shot hits the same target twice or allows a high number of enemies to be in the chain of lightning
---
Oh I don’t think it was me it could’ve been some1 else I know since that’s all I mostly do
---
Agreed! We need more actual weapons, not just new skins!
---
I’ve also started a second character but that’s now starting to take time to level up.  Level up is a silly one as just starting a new character once a week get you the score.  I don’t think they designed it for this to happen and expected everyone to level up one of their main characters
---
Gun fu can be annoying on certain builds.
---
I might be wrong, whats your gamertag?
---
That is the Shimmer. Do not enter it.
---
Thatonedumdum- but I doubt it I don’t think I was on
---
Hey there! This is something we're actually looking into doing based off community feedback.
---
In the past, consensus was that 2shot does nothing on a Tesla.  Maybe that's changed but I'm not aware of it being worth anything.
---
Should be all of them except the clothes vendor. They might not all have it on them though if someone's bought it already

This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

---
yeah, doesn't ring a bell. would've been cool tho
---
you can continue along this path. You can easily switch perks between melee and shotgun since they are both strength. I would not recommend you have perk cards for both at the same time because you'll do a lot less damage (costing more bullets, more repair materials, more time). But switching them out according to need is something more people do.  
---
Pick what you prefer, there is no build out there that is perfect for everybody.  
---
My personal preferred build is a full health tanky heavy gunner junkie. But again, go for the weapon type you enjoy the most, you will enjoy the game more.
---
Where do you get the plan for the helmets? 
---
I have it on a couple of characters but for the life of me can't remember how I got them.
---
Is it true fallout first memebers got a bigger discount. I am a member and I got it for 100 atoms I’m wondering what everyone else paid for it. I saw juicehead say it in his YouTube video but just wondering
---
Any weapon that involves charging is more screwed up than others in VATS.
---
As tedious as it is, entering/exiting VATS 3 times tends to fix it for that VATS instance.  You can speculate as to why this arcane trick works.
---
Yea it would’ve been nice
---
Whoa, that's wild! u/Vault310 want to send me that ticket number so we can look into this?
---
It definitely fires two shots I have seen it my self but it’s hard to tell where the chains are coming from when fireing on a enemy
---
It says on the fallout 1st membership so i think it does

It's [Jeff Lane](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Interloper) making the hidden reality manifest at long last.

I was going to buy one of them but I already had secret service armor. Is it any good? I ended up buying t65 power armor. Well I could only get legs arms and chest before good ran out. But I already bought secret service armor and under armor and both guns so I was debating what to buy next. But I didn’t wanna waste on those armors if I won’t use them
---
There are quite a few caps in and around the buckets to collect, up until you inevitably hit the cap limit.
---
If you are into the strangeness of that freakshow, you would definitely enjoy The Resident's Freakshow.
---
&gt;well built commandos
---
Even if the weapon isn't hacked, I'm fairly sure that's the Fire Rate glitch at work.
---
Oh so it was just for us. Nice to see that they actually are doing that finally
---
That's awesome. I wonder if getting ultracite lasers to work with regular lasers skins is possible too
---
It's much much worse than when I started playing in April that's for sure. The last patch is when it seemed to really get bad.
---
look I remember in FO4 I didn't get concrete walls until half the damn settlements were rickety shacks that could get taken out by a determined wolf doing breathing exercises, there's precedent for this
---
Damn good suggestion. For a minute I thought those chems existed and I somehow didn't know!
---
&gt;On the other hand, I rarely see melee builds at the SBQ these days anyway. 
---
Players with hacked guns killing her in seconds, and her inability to be reliably forced down through wing cripples, have rendered melee somewhat impractical for the SBQ.
---
This used to be my go-to method for dealing with the Queen, but I simply cannot rely on it anymore.  I've had cases where the Queen was melted before I could even get into melee range when she landed.  It's absurd.
---
Actually u/vault310 I just checked with the team and they said they are aware of this bug and resolved it. In the meantime don't spend those atoms, the extra's will be removed from your account and you'll be back at your normal balance.
---
Unless I’m blind you actually did respond to him
---
Puts on perk. Starts glowing. “Huh? I’m not a corpse!” : the imposter enters the room.
---
Early game yes if it was lvl 50 it would be really good for a commando sneak build
---
Today I learned that a nuke zone is the same color as Winnie the Pooh's asshole. 
---
Thanks I hate Winnie the Pooh's glowing, irradiated asshole.
---
Not sure at all but the rarest plans in-game should have some value. Especially for people who want this plan. I see several request for the mire salve in the Market in the past.
---
No, the 76ers control the silos.  Its just to MODUS's benefit that we have control.
---
Ok, thanks, what should I do With It?
---
Use it till you get a better weapon like a handmade assault rifle or a fixer something that fits your build
---
If this is your best gun keep it. Those explosive bullet guns are pretty rare and strong
---
Yea its was mabey 12 hrs a day not proud of but I was stuck in the house what else was I gonna do
---
Explosive Weapons, especially Legacy lasers break incredibly fast for some god unknown reason.
---
Pre-level 50? Yeah, it's decent. A lot of people sleep on Pipe Weapons in the early game.
---
I'm not sure how you did that but it sounds fun, like you get to see aspects of the game in ways you never had before
---
Yeah would be neat to have more med plans from an NPC quests and daily’s like Biv. A new hippie guy?
---
It depends.  I could see the logic behind keeping her alive in order to farm XP.  But the adds are ultimately rather unpredictable.  Some SBQ battles are swarming with them.  Other times, she's pretty much the only thing you're fighting.  Probably has some connection with how often she lands, which she seldom does anymore.
---
what was the main game, again?
---
Yeah I it’s automatic and I was using it in rad rumble for about two minutes and it breaks
---
Not for an unknown reason - explosive by itself is a major ding against durability &amp; when you add a laser on top of it (which is also coded with crap durability), they break fast.
---
It's a code thing.
---
I’m level 160, So idk what to do with it
---
That’s good but I also think every episode should be a different story, like one episode takes place on the streets of new Vegas and the next be like on the other east coast something like that.
---
use it for low level stuff to burn 38 ammo. or if youre with your friends and want everybody to get a hit, so you dont 1 shot things.
---
it's just a jump to the left
---
I meant no dmg increase.  Ive read that the two arcs do half the listed damage.
---
fallout bos is the worst one
---
what's the real difference between ss, solar, and thorn?
---
My mom is having the same problem 
---
[link](https://imgur.com/gallery/kCR1qnC)
---
That's just dumb actually, well you learn something new every day. Thank you!
---
Each hit causes durability loss. So the explosive makes it break 2x as fast. If you have the splitter on it, making it fire 5 bullets, it will be breaking 10x as fast
---
So it’s splits the damage into two arcs?
---
Oh yeah. 
---
If anyone knows a work around for the object needs support/cannot be placed in water issue with placement that would have been, and will be super useful in the future.
---
That’s odd
---
Got Greg’s brain, this mission was kinda funny though 😁
---
I’m in a discord that does that, but we’re only xbox1. We do a nuke run (3 Queens) multiple times per day.
---
They did that...his name was Mad Max.
---
I think you go more in the way they did with 100. Jump around time lines in a way you don't confuse everyone.
---
For those who don't speak german, it's basically a translation of AngryTurtles video on Carnivore. OP did the same for Herbivore earlier as well.
---
Okay thank you so it’s because of projectiles it wears down fast
---
Because the extra hits on targets drain durability
---
A laser rifle alone will last an ok chunk of time (1 hit/ammo)
---
Explosive adds an extra hit into the mix (2 hits/ammo) for 2x the durabilty drain
---
Beam splitter if applied adds 4x? hits/ammo for a 4x durabulity drain
---
Throw explosive on a beam splitter and you are hitting 8x? Hits/ammo (4x beams + 4x explosions)
---
Similarly A tse handmade  will drain durability at 4x the speed of a aa/ffr, since 2 hits + 2 explosives count as 4x the hits
---
*note, dont remember exactly the # of beams splitter puts out, im pretty sure its 4*
---
Power user plus X-01 armor. Stack refractor 3 and fireproof 3 and the queen does nothing to me except for poison but that can be avoided by moving away. Also having the proper build like mentioned above makes a huge difference. With a group and rad sponge perk rads are nonsense. That perk makes nuke zones easy. Also you may want to consider mutations if at least if you aren’t going to use bloodied or junkies for damage. The mutations can help a lot and add an edge to getting around and boosting things like movement speed carry weight DR and benefits from food
---
Yeah - a lot of complaints that people have about explosive weapons go right back into the way it was coded. Laser weapons, in general, are the most disappointing. BGS put about zero effort into the code - not only do the vastly underperform compared to most weapons, but the preset durability put them at even a great disadvantage.
---
actually having it unified to a central theme instead of just a bunch of random tasks would be nice
---
Idk, feels better than it did closer to when the game came out. There was a long stretch where it seemed to work just fine, but somewhere in the last 2-3 patches I've noticed its gotten really buggy again. 
---
Its just one of those things thats hard to pin point since its not consistent.
---
We're looking into doing this based off community feedback. It won't make it into the next patch but it is something on their radar now!
---
Stupid question; have you finished the Wastelander's questline?
---
I like it when they glow so tasty.

Whenever anything unexpected happens in this game, remember [It just works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8)
---
If it was a square of the same perimeter, your end up actually losing space though.
---
Yeah. And that's a minimum of 10x as fast. If the explosion hits other enemy's that will also proc durability loss
---
If they added atoms or bullions to after-run dailies and  weeklies I guarantee you people will complain that you have this legendary run gate to get past to get these rewards!
---
Sorry I didn't see this, reddit does not tell me I've been tagged in the body of a post only comments.

I remember sharing this feedback a while ago but I can resurface it.
---
Seriously, share whatever you want...who cares!?  I'd be happy if someone shared cannibal.
---
I think as long as it isn't something that will hurt another player's build, there's no harm. I share level 1 pack rat or green thumb. But I might start sharing cannibal myself!
---
Dunno, but I think so.  If both arcs did the listed dmg it would be way OP

Had a super low level player request my bloodied shotgun that I had equipped. Gave them a big thumbs down. Come on man.
---
You won't earn them untill you complete wastelanders. You also only get them from public events, and riding shotgun
---
You can Infact zoom out. Hold the placement button and I believe it's the right or left stick on PS4. 
---
Don't know about of or xbone
---
Yeah, I have had a B/E/15r Laser in my box for the last few months and wanted to trade it for a J/E/15r Laser as I run Junkie, but I might reconsider actually because of just that.
---
Energy weapons already break easily as is, throw in explosive and the splitter mod and sneezing will turn it into wet tissue paper.
---
Did you complete the Wastelanders DLC and raid Vault 79 with one of the factions? Treasury notes are introduced through the story quests.
---
I'm theorizing but I believe it is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to draw a circle around an object when it comes to programming in a 3d environment then a square. I have some experience in that field, but none with bethesda.
---
I responded to Drax99 originally who mentioned about the camera trick not being good if the mob has fallen through the earth.
---
He entered the conversation after that. Bringing a whole different subject. If the mobs flown somewhere else, the camera can still help. Provided the lob didn’t fall through the earth.
---
God damn it’s useless
---
Low level Players can hit the Level Up challenges easier than the higher level players.
---
Well, alot of people use the Splitter mod. The lazerrifle itself isn't that bad( not super great tho) when it comes to durability, but the splitter mod makes it so that every shot is like 5 times worst then a normal shot.
---
Yeah. They break like crazy
---
Excellent point.
---
This shouldn't require a PERK.  It should be standard.  The high grass in some areas makes it impossible to find some mobs, which is terrible when you've killed a Legendary.
---
If it was max level you could probably get about 5k+ for it. As it is you could probably get about 2-3 i reckon. The difference in damage between a 40 and 50 is quite small tbh. 
---
Like someone said you could keep it for doing events with people.
---
I agree with the general idea in terms of the timeline - 25 years is a lot easier to grasp than 200 - but I wouldn't use Fallout 76 or any of the games as the basis, simply because that tramples on where the games have gone, where they could go, and opens the door for all kinds of lore inconsistency.
---
You can do things *like* the games, but I would personally steer clear of anything that rewrites story that has already been covered by them.
---
Thats the notification sound in the game, odd choice but it works i guess
---
I mean.... It takes like 15-20 minutes to finish most of (maybe not all) of the daily challenges. 
---
Building, claiming workshop, repair, kill 1 legendary, 10 scorched. 
---
They can be knocked out way quick.
---
Amazing how quickly Bethesda fixed this issue, but leaves broken Perks on the table for weeks / months.  I wonder why?  /s
---
I miss New Vegas.....
---
Yeah that would be great. Other than the domes we have nothing really that is circular and we have to use glitches to make a circular camp. Plus when you like to build elaborate bases like me and you have to push up against the edge of the circle and once you get about 2-3 stories in itll say you are out of the build area because in 3D space its a sphere so it gets narrower as you go up... fucking annoying
---
Random
---
That's great to hear!
---
Yep he has a convo with the ZAX before he became President Eden
---
Bro, it's Wendigo, and everyone who read Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark in elementary school knows that. Yeah, don't grammar police reddit, but also know your history.
---
H I think mine propositioned me. The other night, for the first time ever, I thought I heard him say "Hey, wanna do something weird?" And I promptly left my C.A.M.P.
---
Ss has high base stats and a jetpack
---
Solar has decent base stats (scout) but heals over time (above 60% hp, works __in__ combat, full set)
---
Thorns has the same stats as solar (scout) but has a damage aura, and boosts stealth (full set)
---
I’ve been having this issue with various enemies, not sure if that’s a known thing. Sucks that it happened with a major quest line though.
---
Also throw in that durability is calculated on hits not on shoots.  So if you shoot once and hit 10 things, that is 10 dings to durability with that one shot.
---
Many of Bethesda's upper management are no-brainers but probably not in the way you meant, that's why we're here with this after all.
---
But like others and I already said in the past you can bet that we will see most if not all of Fo4's settlement objects some day in 76 as that is easy money for them but I assume for now they want to make it look like they invest things by putting in 'new'(&amp; buggy) stuff in the Atomshop and as soon as 76's development goes into hibernate they let the Fo4 stuff trickle in so there's still 'new' stuff coming into the shop without them having to invest much anymore.
---
Modus always seemed to me to be a design nod to [Max Headroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom), so I don’t  find him creepy apart from the fact the he controls a very powerful arsenal and could instantly wipe my existence if he/devs so choose. Mostly I keep waiting for him to crack some jokes and g-g-g-glitch through the punchline. Luckily, that Bunker becomes redundant once you’ve gotten all the serums and their recipes.
---
I've found her at the camp your checking, walking some random road, wandering Flatwoods town.

I thought I was going crazy, every time I'd get atoms the amount would jump up but when I'd go into the atom store it would say I only had 30.

Cheers mate

I was maybe thinking trying out a stealth build

I don't get why everyone is obsessed with scrappy style camp shit, like "ohhh fear me I got tetnis." but will try you're idea. :)
---
Love how the color scheme matches the tree. Very nice.
---
Also you are starving...lol....that's exactly what happens to me when I go into manic build mode.
---
IIRC there was this doctor and this small little freak who kidnap you and the other people they kidnap they sell to this guy Iguana Bob who makes them into “Iguana Bits”, effectively making the people into food, you can even blackmail him for caps I think
---
I like to have sunkissed 2 star shared just to weaken the bloodied build.
---
It's probably not a popular opinion, but I've always envisioned a Fallout TV show as being distinctly Pre-War, bookended by Post-War "Oh, here's this artifact, I wonder what the story is behind that?" scenes.  Sort of an Atomic Age Twilight Zone.
---
I just think there are so many shows that are about wastelands, grizzled survivors, and the apocalypse already, that when I try to understand what would make a Fallout version unique, I keep coming back to the retrofuturism angle, and how that twisted interplay between 1950s naivete and the horrors of nuclear holocaust is really at the core of what makes the setting special.
---
See this is the stuff that really blows my mind. VATs is a core game mechanic! It's the thing that makes 76 combat unique and in some instances, playable! Without it, we're left with truly one of the lamest shooters of the past 10 years. And yet VATS has been broken in one way or another for months. The same thing with the perks that don't work. People create their builds around specific perks and then they don't function. What a bunch of fuck ups.
---
And sometimes they are loving punches and heal the enemy instead of damaging :(
---
When she doesn't land it's mostly due to one of the following 2 reasons.
---
1) Heavy hitters are sitting on fences or on top of other things she can't path to. You can easily tell who she's targetting because that's the one she'll be circling for a while.
---
2) Heavies need to drop One Man Army. The stagger effect keeps her in the air.
---
I don't need my queen fights to take ages so when I drop nukes I don't exclude V9 or Delta.
---
Sure, you take some rads but she lands a lot more often and the mobs she spawns will often have flux stabilizing mats on them. It's also more fun as it's usually a lot more chaotic than those boring sit and wait events you normally have.
---
I needed that combined with the chest mod to 100% negate explosives. One didn't work without the other.
---
Any time!
---
Thank you.  I only got as far as fixing the mainframe terminals the first time.  
---
I crafted stealth armor and added robot and stealth perks.  Going to try another silo run next time I stumble across a key card.
---
Counter-Counterpoint - yeah but my thing is if you have a peace of high tech equipment in a scrappy camp, it looks like you found it and ups the scale. You can't do the inverse. You guys got the bloody ammo converter and the ammo maker to look all scrappy.
---
Yea maybe, but high levels have an option to just go on a low level acc to go up quickly, I’ve actually seen multiple people do that on this sub.
---
If you're on xbox I got rug plans for you
---
More like an hour including creating a new char for the level up challenge.
---
It was the latest patch.
---
What scematics?
---
See her a fair amount walking up the coast from Billings homestead when I’m doing a sugar run.
---
found her in a ranger tower
---
I'm also fairly certain that with my camp being at its place since B.E.T.A and the building changes since then that I wouldn't be able to rebuild it how it is now.
---
I'm not sure if you are totally joking but in case you arn't, you should probably do a google search before condemning someone on the internet when you are absolutly, completly wrong 
---
And I have no idea what Scarey Stories to Tell in the Dark is...or rather I didn't until I took 3 seconds to google it

How about a well written story with memorable characters

Or am I asking for too much
---
I believe the SS armor is the best armor in the game, so i would get the mods for thst first before purchasing any other armor
---
I want Adrenaline fixed 😉😂 
---
Content is nice, however it would be better to fix stuff. 
---
As a 500+ player it's not hard to enjoy the game but friends make it so much better👍
---
great work as always
---
Go to a random encounter place and jump from server until it appears.
---
They have a lot of mounted heads from the duped gifts so they try to sell them.
---
grind
---
I have the buttressed mods for all of it deep pocketed and jet pack for chest and under armor I have the shielded plan: so I got everything I want for that. But I’ll just stick with buying rest of t65. I’ll have to really transfer a bunch of my weapons to alts because with excavator I can carry 575 with all other power armor I will maybe get 400. And I know t65 is the rankest armor now.
---
I did Google it and unless you also missed how to read, try again or don't come back here with that bullshit. You also can't spell scary, so I'm real sure you're as credible as you're trying to act.
---
You are a horrible person
---
thanks.
---
Some of these players have them free in their vendor so it is good to go and get plans you don't have.
---
Marketing baby. Got you to visit.
---
Seriously though, those prices are hilarious. I charge 5c per mounted, sometimes 1c, or I just drop them.
---
To complain about it on Reddit.
---
And make flamer thrower we able to get rid of piles of other players plasma hiding all the loot...... Line in the sand players, you know who you are haha.
---
Soon you’ll be calling me a hero
---
The entire internet decided that Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel does not exist and will not be talked about. Ever.
---
I've always wondered: If two people share the same perk with a team, or if you're already running with a perk that is also shared with you, do the effects stack (like two 1 star perks acting like a 2 star)?
---
Where did they announce they moved to Houston? I know about the dev studio in Austin that works on 76 but which studio do they have in Houston?
---
Fair enough
---
10k xp is easy to make. Grind the dungeons and your good. 
---
Learn the xp buffs, teams and lunchboxes etc and it's easy to level. 
---
I am over 500 and I can level if I grind hard in under an hour
---
Hell over double XP I made levels in under 15 minutes.
---
I just think people should keep their expectations low.  This is Amazon, after all.  While they have a handful of standouts, the vast majority of their output is pretty mixed.
---
I had 3k+ plans one time now down to 1990 lots of mounts and prime plans from a guy who dropped me over 10k large handmade gifts
---
Of the pizza eating ninja variety?
---
That has been my experience as well when running with a team.
---
Both this one and Uranium Fever, when I miss tagging a legendary but one of my team mates does, I have been able to loot it.
---
OP doesn't have caps to buy a serum plan I'm guessing.
---
And 7K is maximum optimal takings not profit. If you sell at 500 you can't sell three without fiddling so the sweet spot is 430 caps each.
---
It's very grindy doing this but I made a million caps this way with 9 accounts and lots of Grape Mentats when fluxes were around 100 caps each admittedly.
---
better off with a lever, fixer or handmade for that. I mean you could mod that to do single shot and it'd do some damage.
---
Well on Xbox I can’t ever get into a server where anyone launches any. If I get in one it was already launched and the event done. And when I launched one no one showed up. It was like this when wastelanders came out. There where so many low levels no one nukes. And now with it being on game pass have the server are low levels. So I’m guessing in a couple weeks it will go back to every server having at least one nuke. But until then I guess I’m going to try to solo queen with the bloodied fixer I received from the amazing purveyor the other day.
---
I'm not into grinding for endless hours for little return.  
---
As a solo Stealth/Sniper with a Camoflauge legendary piece(Level 20) this is essential to my play I a replacement that is better is optimal. It has 3 effects. Camolfauge, -20% to all food and Chems and another one I can't remember. If I should find a better one like that, it's likely I'll pass it on to someone else.  
---
The Ammo machine would help this char out so much. Not sure if I mentioned it, but I'm not going for Super Mega Awesome God Teir gear. I'm still learning how to group effectively.  
---
I still haven't finished the Tadpole quest where you gotta get three badges. I HATE how hard they've made it. The only upgrades to it I have are two skins I really like. I saw the vendor list for Reg but BGS has that stupid same icon for everything instead of how it looks once you've made it. I'm sure I could go online and find pictures of it.  
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Use the ‘replace’ button when you go to scrap them
---
So right now, it costs 15,880 to level up between levels 100 and 999. the 10K for the repeatable is equal to 63% of the total XP needed. Maybe they could make the XP repeatable a % of the XP needed to level up at whatever level you are at.
---
The problem is, by making it easier to earn that repeatable 100 score, players would then be better off only grinding score on low level characters. Grind to level 10 and then delete and reset the character, re-grind to level 10, repeat.

Oh yea maybe but i’m very stingy when it comes to using lunchboxes, when would be the best time to open it and please tell me the dungeon spots
---
I don't remember how far I was with the Settlers.  
---
I was doing daily quests so much since Legendary thing started. So if I keep all the gold then it doesn't hit the raider rep that much?
---
They should make the custom loot bags apply to dead bodies with loot as well. They charged us for it, make it useful.
---
I think someone posted that they scored hits on the assaultron while it was cloaked and it still registered those as hits for them after it was killed so they were able to loot even though they didn't get a chance to hit it after it was vulnerable.
---
Might be worth a try.
---
&gt; How is anyone being taken advantage off?
---
Yeah this kind of made me lol. It's like the pirating subreddits who act like they do it for some higher moral purpose instead of wanting free shit.
---
That's too much work. 
---
Learn to xp buffs and intelligence xp gains and it's way easy to gain xp.
---
Level is irrelevant, people have alts. Totally agree though it's annoying to see that event failing when full because everyone thinks it's an xp farm.
---
I reached rank 51 yesterday with most of the new weekly challenges completed and all dailies completed. You, and anyone else at this point, will probably be able to catch up to Zorbo today or tomorrow seeing as double score the the daily challenges start today!
---
Sent invite
---
Honestly I used it on my mule's camp last night and it worked fine just like the raider one before it. Selected from the atom shop,then placed my camp again(it's just a greenhouse).
---
My camp icon was showing correctly and I could fast travel to it. I was on my private tho and have no vendors on it,so I can't tell of others could see it or not.
---
I’ve tried keeping them before but I drop every plan I know anymore. Or I do gift emote and give to new player. No body is going to buy them anymore. I only keep the fixer plan I got after I bought it for 5k caps
---
I've seen one of those at a camp as well lol
---
I can join now if you're still online
---
*marvelous. I'll correct myself because I know when my own words are hurting my point.
---
A lot of methods people use to get caps are labour intensive. If you want (almost) passive income you need get yourself a serum plan which I'm sure you can't afford yet.
---
To make proper caps you need the services of all your characters if you have just the one account. That 1,400 NPC vendor cap isn't going to get anyone rich.
---
you may have to be patient. sometimes i cannot kill myself properly.
---
I found her in a blast zone at fissure prime. No rad gear or anything. Very dubious.
---
Grind, achievments. However that grind should be enjoyable.
---
I found her in flatwoods
---
Well, sort of.
---
I was referring more to the fact that cripples are outright disabled on the Queen, which is a bug that's apparently going to be fixed in the next patch.  That was the only way to ground her reliably in the past.
---
I'm not convinced staggering does anything negative now.  Ever since that change happened, I've yet to see an SBQ battle - and I've been in dozens since then - where she got stuck flying in place like she used to, or flew off, never to come back.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  Or maybe disabling cripples had some kind of knock-on effect with staggers.
---
Targets sitting on fences or otherwise not touching the ground though *will* cause her to do that endless cropdusting back and forth though, yes.
---
I actually really loved the base game story, with its biggest flaw of course being that there were no NPCs. It really made it difficult to get attached to what was going on when you know that everyone just dies in the end.
---
Wastelanders had a bunch of NPCs with neat dialog, but its story was very bare bones and simplistic. Fingers crossed the BOS isn't like that and actually has a more complex story that fleshes out the characters and the organization
---
I use the highlight meat pile mod on PC to make them bright green.

Meanwhile some corporation is making the shoes they are wearing using cheap over seas labor paying them a dollar a day...but you know poor gamers...F in chat bois.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha
---
What exactly was your point? That you get all your "research" from wikipedia and children's books?
---
Don’t you want to do the main quest ASAP? You can’t start earning gold bullion until you finish it. (Not being confrontational, genuinely curious)
---
The hardest part of the Mysteries quest is obtaining the sword - The enemies where it sends you scale depending on what other players have been there recently.
---
   I know that radstag well.   If you ran across it where I usually meet it, you are slightly too far SW of where you need to go.
---
  On a good day (For you), the critters where you need to go will be L9-22.   But because it is a ”high level” area, they are often 42 and higher.  And the building you have to visit often contains L48-62.
---
Come in from the train station.  If the first few ghouls you run across are L42+, one option is to server hop until the enemies are lower level.
---
  I will  also tell you the reward will be much better if once you obtain the sword,  you do not return to the Manor until you are between L45 and 50.
---
You can also shelve that for the moment and go visit the mining HQ in the eastern edge of the ash heap.  By the time you are done with that quest, you will be much better prepared to deal with the critters to get the sword.
---
**Ghoulish** one love. Underrated endurance perk. Good with blooded because it does not affect rad removing. Sometimes it can save you from one shotting running ghoul which can be shown only after ghoul hitted you and you died due to server lag. Stim savior. You need only rad aways most of the time. Want to heal a little? Just enter any water. Toxic waste can instaheal you up to full HP bar (the lower rad resist the higher healing). You can heal yourself with gamma gun.
---
Question for the people who are pros at this event. 
---
What perks to you put on to withstand the rads and run more. I use marathoner, and action boy, but I’m spamming radaway and in power armor to survive. How can I get better at collecting the ore faster. I feel like I barely get to level 3 before time runs out. 
---
Am I doing it wrong or do I just need more ore runners?
---
Lol all good. I’m on now
---
No. All of it should be standard and you shouldn’t need a perk.
---
If you hold A, then you can zoom out the item you are placing. But yeah, it's a struggle to find a place flat enough to put large blueprints.
---
Eastern time zone here. Hmu
---
Yeah it worked 👌
---
I'll have to figure out that imigur thing one of theses days haha.
---
But I like to rock the hellfire pa paint with a flamer. And when I step out I'm in the responders firefighter outfit with the make shift rohni helm
---
I ran one for a while - it is a great way to use up all of your otherwise useless .38 ammo - u can use it as a sidearm for lower level mobs - very very low recoil and great fire rate - fun weapon IMO.  Eventually I got a be combat rifle and modded it for .38 and that is what I use currently because of the extra damage ...
---
You don't like the daily bitch about SCORE thread?!
---
You’re not wrong, but in Bethesda’s defense (did I really say that) the rest of the Daily and Weekly challenges are low’ish level friendly, in some cases even favoring lower level. You can rank up to LVL pretty quick these days, so in the long run I’d say it balances.
---
Since we're here,please don't forget to apply the same fix to vault94 armor,as it is infact scout armor.
---
I don’t see any benefit and rushing. The main quest is enjoyable if you take your time with it. Fast traveling all over the place and quick clicking through terminals so you can grind gold isn’t what I consider fun gameplay.
---
I just doing see a reason to rush. You’ll get the rewards eventually. Might as well enjoy the journey.
---
I run either med goggles+surgical mask+science scribe outfit or imp.squatch outfit+owl mask
---
Fighting over workshops happens rarely, but it is one of the better parts of this game. I wish there was more PvP zones in the game... Like an entire town or a city.
---
Also fix shots that show as hitting but don't.
---
When you hit that level 1 bloatfly 3 times with damage numbers appearing and no damage on the bar...
---
When your 1k damage gauss shotgun at point blank range on a level 50 non-legendary scorch beast manages to move the bar 3% with 8 shots...
---
I'm getting really disappointed in this game.
---
No, it doesn't. The flat number from 100 to 999 has been patched a couple of months ago. 
---
 It's now linear growth all the way up and any high level can easily verify this. With the 10K SCORE challenge it's even easier to do since that pops every 10K. 
---
I'm level 506 now, I need over 80,000 XP to level up. Or in other words, I see the 10K SCORE notification 8-9 times between each single level.
---
Legendaries should be feared. They need a serious health buff and immunity to explosive and resistance to energy weapons.
---
I would also love to see higher level NPCs and mobs block more. 
---
After level 5 I one shot almost everything
---
Also, I'll add that I'm not sure exactly what to do in this so I normally hang out at the top to protect the npcs
---
I run the Chinese stealth armor for that event.  It helps immensely.
---
There is an ore limit per character. Rarely can I collect more than 60 alone.
---
It takes more than 15,880 XP to lvl up. XP needed to lvl up increases with every lvl earned.
---
&gt;it costs 15,880 to level up between levels 100 and 999.
---
No it keeps going up. I was getting multiple 10k xp dings per level in the 5-600's.
---
In first person?
---
As opposed to killing everything so they survive but no ore collected so you still fail the event?
---
Unfortunately it won't be back. It might be for you but the game behavior of other players has forever been altered.
---
I would argue that unlockables—easy or not—aren’t content. They’re background filler. The key to success is regular drops of story content, with good characters, writing and choices—like Wastelanders—with regular updates to grindable unlockables to give us something to do in the background while we engage in other things.
---
Todd Howard
---
True, but high level players have no trouble leveling up in a day plus turning over 10000xp multiple times.
---
We certainly cant member that would be most....unfortunate. Perhaps the Kovac's bombardment would be of some...assistance...to us.
---
That's exactly happened to me damn what a shame
---
I get why everyone asks for this, but I don’t see it the same way. I think the reason why it’s a circle is so that you have a uniform distance In all directions from where you place your c.a.m.p.
---
That being said, I do wish we had the ability to shift the circle around slightly after placing it down. It does suck when you can’t place something on one side due to it being out of the build area when you having so much wasted open space on the opposite side.
---
Depends, we want the shit we grind for to actually work properly more than anything though, or at least  bug in an amusing manner
---
I have seen her near fissure Prime as well.
---
It's all mobs, not just legendaries.  The range on it is fairly limited though, i.e. you have to be pretty close when it's killed.  And obviously you have to be teamed with someone who registered enough damage on it to count, which is pretty hit or miss on public teams.
---
Yeah I learned last night that I should just adventure more in the Ash Heap. All of my quests kept pushing me west so I kept adventuring more and more east until I get decimated and just spawn in the forest with my head hung in shame. I'll head towards Mining HQ. Thank you.
---
I honestly have no preference. Don’t care to be bloodied so give me all your perks.
---
Does this help?

---
That’s even better! I never did challenges for atoms.
---
You have no idea how many times I’ve been tempted to do this instead of my Inspiration 3.
---
They should keep it, but also add a repeatable for completing public events and at least one repeatable that can be accomplished in Nuclear Winter. This would let players choose how they want to progress while engaging in different gameplay.
---
I’m on PS4
---
Porque no los dos?
---
I've seen her twice at the houses between dabney homestead &amp; camp venture
---
I'm a heavy junkies guy, have a JE .50cal and I can pretty much just walk through WestTek waving it around and everything falls over. Started out as a rifleman, but this is just too much fun
---
Is there any jetpack that doesn’t require pure flux because i hate grinding for hours just To get one pure flux and just want a jetpack
---
it's called FOMO
---
They aren't exclusive, no, but people need to be more flexible, not everyone needs to be killing everything, im tired of being literally the only runner in 17 different events
---
The one that increases damage to glowing monsters is underrated.
---
Oh yeah, it doesn’t really fit with my character, but I can see why folks would want that for sure.
---
There was no outrage train because there’s nothing to be outraged about. Calm down.
---
It's called irony, Karen. Now shut up and put your mask back on.
---
Mods ruined fallout 4 for me since they allow console mods on Xbox
---
How is this different than the atom challenges before?
---
Beckley + Abandoned Bogtown + SBQ for me.  And I'm a sucker and bought it from Bethesda because I wanted to support the company, so these fixes don't apply to me.  Oops.  Not happening again.
---
It is a couple of days old and it's part of a fictional game. I personally see nothing wrong with it (been self isolating for 4 months now). The game itself has a questline about a plague and you making a vaccine.
---
But. You do you.
---
You could check to see what people are doing and where you're actually needed instead
---
tbh that's the rest of my normal gameplay, by the time you wipe out everything at general's, westek, take out the sentries at whitespring, you're most of the way to a level
---
Thank you
---
Dude... You're choosing to make this mean something that it wasn't even intended to mean.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wkjm6MN.png
---
As a game intended to play like a mmo it really needs a lot more quest content. You can knock out the two main questlines in a couple of days quite easily. It plays too much like Bethesda's single player games where the main quest is quite short and fleshed out by the idea of the player going off on tangents and doing random shit. That doesn't work so well here. Repeatable quests like dailies should have been aimed purely as endgame content and not filling in for progression too. 
---
 Some decent raids and dungeons too. I've barely touched grinding for SS armor etc because what's the point? I can do all the endgame stuff in the random assortment of crap I'm wearing now.
---
Tldr: Quests, raids and dungeons. The stuff you'd expect in an online rpg.
---
I appreciate the offer but I'm on PlayStation.
---
Fun Fact: Lucille is the first weapon skin I’ve felt worth a damn to spend atoms on. She is a beauty.
---
For the game they are the same weapon. Just like Deliverer and 10mm pistol in Fallout 4 or the Brotherhood Recon Rifle in 76. If you look into the game files for weapons, you'll find a list of "mod loadouts" applicable for the weapon. There is a basic loadout (when you craft the bare weapon), there are some randomized loadouts (for looting) and there can be special loadouts for uniques like the Deliverer and Fixer. These unique loadouts usually contain some special, non-craftable components that give them the unique properties. It may be that for Fixer, the unique component overrides the slot for appearance...
---
Source: after Fo4 release I have toyed with weapon mod modding and even released a small mod for it.
---
I don't mind grinding if it's good. I really like to take though and there isn't much to trade for in this game. So if it's a heavy grind, give us options so maybe we can trade with someone who grinded for something else.
---
It would be cool to grind and collect pieces to build something to trade. Like a special outfit or weapon or something.
---
Currently I speed run for the red nurses outfit, radiation rumble for the barrel and do riding shotgun for the blue ridge stuff.
---
I'm not sure if they actually pick up the fluid or if it's just RNG determining how much fluid they drop. Killed a radtoad that ate a bunch of flies for no fluid and killed a fresh spawn for 3 fluids :/
---
There are benches on the third and power armor stations on the forth.  It doesn't take long to get to the third or forth floor if someone has gone before you and but you have to have fully explored the building once.
---
Fully agree. High level players have this flexibility if needed. Players new to the game have limited flexibility to grind the repeatable challenge.
---
Outraged over a icon that is near, probably identical to the high radiation symbol in game?
---
If anyone should be mad about the  radiation icon it should be Japan or people near Chernobyl.
---
Second it's a game, take a step back and relax a bit, take some deep breaths
---
Because they’re broken. Bethesda did a durability buff to energy weapons long after these were removed from the game, I don’t think that buff applied to them. Additionally, everyone runs them with the beam splitter because that’s how you get the OP broken crazy damage. That adds a lot of “projectiles”, and the more projectiles the weapon fires, the faster it breaks.
---
It would be nice if everyone would just run down just one lane and get ore, then it would be easy to get max rewards. I've collected enough to get the progress bar to half, but after that, the ore doesn't spawn fast enough  and there isnt enough time.
---
I agree dude. Rifles seem to work ok (still missing point blank shots tho) still but ironically the best vats weapon ive tried is a gatling gun....which is kinda fun to vats with tbf
---
hang on to the the '150 atom' rewards for the end when levels are grindy, it's like using the stimulus check to pay your taxes
---
A fucking new engine would be a start so we could get 76 to the best and funnest it could be.
---
Oxhorn is cringe because he is the poster child for the stereotype of fedora-wearing  “good guys” who deep down, *do* think they’re on a pedestal
---
...and bugging out respawn. And loosing the Loot in the Goo after like 30 seconds.
---
And hear the guitar play 24/7? Get outta here!

---
This. As long as other people are playing ball i slap my stealth suit on. Pop a rad-x diluted (doesn't supress mutations either) and do at least 3 tunnels to get 25-30 ore. Enough for 1 rank.
---
👍🏻✌🏻
---
Thank you :)
---
I had mine in a forest type camp. I just put bushes (atomic) shop around it and Faschnact balloons. You can make anything blend in. Just build stuff around it.
---
Yeah I’m getting this too and it’s infuriating. Also where I don’t one shot them in VATS, let’s say I bring them down to 5% health, when I leave VATS their health is full again??? And I’m not talking about legendaries mutating.
---
Have you finished the Wastelanders quest?
---
Theyre fixing adrenaline but are there any other broken perks atm? Seems like action boy isnt working like it used to. Might just be me tho
---
What do you mean?
---
I hope they actually fix her, this shit gets extremely annoying. 2 out of 3 fights everything is fine but in the third everything goes to shit and she never lands.
---
&gt; Trying to make your way in the Wasteland can be harsh! Let others know the next time you’re having a tough day by equipping the Felt Better Icon, which you can claim for free this week in the Atomic Shop.
---
Im failing to see the association with covid.. I dont have a problem with this icon at all...
---
Clean toilets is what people want.
---
Store him till u need them. They're people too yknow.
---
Man you're so fucking edgy
---
I don’t know...this is a reach
---
I’m on ps4 and launch 3 in a row every night.
---
If it wasn't for the score bounse I feel like people wouldn't be so focused on the xp, it's still messed up. But that's why I think people have been extra bad lately
---
I have failed that event so many times because people there for the xp and loots are letting the scavengers die. Latest one we failed with 4 seconds to go because i was getting ore and wasn't their to protect and heal. they were camped at the entrances to the tunnels and ghouls got past them and they didn't bother to go after them. 4 seconds. 
---
This is why people should sit in the middle and kill ghouls. They can still get the kills but they can also protect the scavengers.
---
My last camp design had a store building. The front had an awning/porch, and i used the nuka cola door and a couch on the porch, which gave it a kind of mystery shack vibe. I'd like to see yours!
---
Johnny? He’s got a quest.
---
It shoots explosive bullets, not laser beams or the usual Tesla electricity arc.
---
I just want the damn Mr. Fuzzy mask to not cost 300 tickets... the rate at which you acquire them is a joke... been working on it for a month now, jumping on the events every time they pop up but have only managed to collect 64 of 'em.
---
That one place in the Mire has three. It's a meat or hunting shack. I don't remember the name
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
Are you referring to the scorch killer receiver plans for the guns?
---
I have seen it shoot some rays but it seems like it shoots rockets lol. Maybe the explosive version ?
---
That's actually an awesome perk to share!  I would take full advantage of that one.
---
I bet you're fun at parties
---
Im 1/2 way there
---
It’s the way the explosive version is.
---
Right? Will auto kick for that alone.
---
NO! This should not require a perk card or a mod. The enemies that you killed by expending resources should be guaranteed loot-able and easily identified naturally. You should not have to go searching with a ProSnap to try and identify glitched bodies or wayward meat piles. Make them stand out more! Bigger flies in a higher column. More vibrant colors and louder directional indicators. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
---
You can atleast skip the computer smashing part, it still works as of yesterday when i did it, saves you maybe 5-10 mins atleast.
---
I collected ore for months but gave up on it.
---
Ok , thank you
---
lol
---
Wait, you serious?
---
LOL
---
I disagree. Yes, it’s a series of fetch quests (but really what isn’t in this game), but those quest chains are a lot longer than I was expecting.
---
Keep your politics out of the game
---
Literally every time I go to my camp or someone visits I have a pile of like 3 draped all over the house
---
you cant store/scrap their objects when they are actively sitting at them
---
I was under the impression, codewise, the fixer is simply a skin on a regular combat rifle that applies the sneak bonuses. Similar to an Atom Shop skin. For example Grognak's Axe is renamed to Stanley when you apply the skin. Functionally I've assumed this is how the Fixer was added, essentially a modded combat rifle with unique skin that adds the boosts. Which may be why the mods learned from scrapping combat rifles apply to the fixer.
---
At least that would explain why something so seemingly simple may be harder to change than one would expect.
---
This is all of course speculation, I haven't been able to dive into any files to confirm or deny this hypothesis.
---
First thing I did was put the sac in the display case and was immediately put off by its "ballsy" appearance.  :D
---
This happened to me with all of the U.S.S.A. robots. Probably just a bug. Caused me to drop the quest line for a while out of frustration, but I came back as a higher level and was able to handle it. It certainly is annoying, but just kinda unload on them and use grenades and power armor! It’s possible!
---
Underrated comment
---
You can track a keycard anytime you want via a terminal in the bunker. 
---
Once you actually grind your way through the silo once, look up how to cut it down to under 10 minutes.
---
Execute the vaultdwellers!!! 
---
PSA, this is a perk from cannibal.
---
Huh?
---
In a way yes and no but those values are the in game vendor values right? This wouldn't be entirely accurate for a player vendor/trader stand point.  But it's still good stuff to know so thank you.
---
For the Scorched Killer's Receiver of some basic weapons.
---
When you enter the Charleston fire department, you will get a quest, that sends you to the final Fire Breathers exam in the Belching Betty mine, were you have to activate an emergency beacon on the lowest level. You then get the receiver schematics for some basic weapons like the 10 mm pistol.
---
And the other receivers are locked behind a password. 
---
Those receivers are not great, but i had in mind that they exist and want them on my char. Maybe as a special anti-scorched weapon only.
---
You can level up quick. Herbivore with brain fungus soup and cranberry relish. Carnivore with broiled scorchbeast brain. Join a team for intelligence boost. Be well rested as well. You can get tons of extra XP for not much work.
---
All of my weapons are bunked when trying to use vats, they only sometimes work, and I have noticed that I can sit at 95% vats accuracy up close and it will STILL miss a whole clip if I stay in vats after the first miss. Exiting vats and re-entering seems to partially fix it and allows it to at least hit the next shot and register the percentages somewhat properly (i'm still missing about half despite the high accuracy with high range and accuracy weapons at a close distance)
---
I also had an issue of shotguns, when using vats, no matter how close you are, only would hit my target with just ONE pellet of shot when aiming for the head, body, anywhere. While sure it hit, it did so in the least effective way possible.
---
Yea get another one and put it next to it then see what it looks like lol
---
I like that they walk around as it adds a bit of life to the camp, especially of you have objects near them that they can interact with. But regarding your second point, I'd love if Beckett actually could sell drinks to players to make the bar I've built actually functional. Would be perfectly fine not getting the few caps he'd sell things for, it's just odd that he constantly talks about running a bar and yet won't sell to anyone but his landlord.
---
Exactly. I don’t think people realize the curve allows for more space, not less
---
I always go running around collecting ore so I usually miss out on any legendaries/loot from the enemies.But at least I don’t see the campfest going on upstairs.
---
most people are just in a party for the benefits
---
I share travel agent, but I hate when people share strange in numbers. Whenever I jump, it makes me jump higher but it also makes me stand on an invisible floor for a second before falling which is super annoying
---
Thats strange, I guess these players had OP weapons and smoked the queen.
---
Excellent advice.  With Chinese Stealth Armour and a hard hitting silenced lever action, I can navigate a silo solo without taking a single hit of damage.  Takes a while to get the perks, weapons and armour, but it's a cake walk when you do.
---
You mean Mirelurk King Cave. Trololol.
---
Level gap really doesn't matter for that. Just keep joining Building teams and doing your main quests and enjoy that sweet XP bonus.
---
Nobody in a group party actually plays together. You just join it for the benefits
---
Yes please. For Chinese stealth armour as well!
---
yea i went hard them first few weeks but only lv 77 at this point i just wanna be done so i can take a break lol
---
I know it doesn’t stack with a 3 star cards. I run 3 star inspirational when in a group and lots of people share the 1 star version. I don’t notice any increase in exp in this case.  Not sure what it would do if you run a two star and someone shares a one star.
---
I wish the would just remove the grass from the fissure site prime area . It’s been nuked enough the damn grass should be dead by now !
---
Yeah, I've been saving them up. 
---
But now that we're at the point where you don't get enough score from the dailies to level up, I'll slowly start slipping further and further behind even with the weekly rewards. I managed to complete almost all the weekly events and all the daily ones yesterday and I'm still 3 behind. That means that I'll fall behind a lot more over the next week then the same for every week from now on, you'll always be falling a bit further behind every week meaning that even the atoms I've saved up might not be enough.
---
Like I said - I think they would have gotten a lot more good will from players if they had left even just a week of extra time to be able to finish.
---
You got that right! 
---
I've only being playing since Wastelanders and already i'm so tired of wanting to bitch and moan about the money grabbing, community ignoring, non bug-fixing, time-boxing nonsense that I have had to step away from playing for a while.
---
It's pretty simple these days, listen to and work with your community and you will end up with an amazing product, pretty much ignore them and you will lose customers
---
So true!!  Ever built a deck/floor but can't add a railing to it because 1 pixel is outside the build space?  Maddening.
---
Hey there friend. No judgment on your hours played. Its just not everyone can play 12 hours a day to grind score. That is the issue at its core. 
---
The  issue most people have is that a player who plays for 30 minutes each day/week is going to have more score than someone who plays 4 hours for 3 days or maybe even 4 days. 
---
Person A can put minimal effort but log in daily and complete the season easily by playing somewhat casually.
---
Person B who cannot play daily because of responsibilities but can put more hours into the game than person A still earns less possible score!  
---
Even tho person B puts more time into the game they still get less score. So calling them entitled ignores the issue at hand that is constantly repeated by design.
---
Why not just let him spend them? You know as 'compensation'?
---
It's what you pay at vendors, yes. It's not mine, it was posted on here by someone and I just kept the link. 
---
Not sure if there's a list what vendors will pay you as that requires all sorts of information. Charisma, with or without Hard Bargain, with or without drugs or other buffs, full Unyielding or not, etc. pp. I think it maxes out at some point but I have no idea where, exactly. :)
---
thats not entirely true.. sometimes they coincidentally go to the same active event.. lol
---
That's not really playing together though, more playing in the same vicinity haha
---
No way I was spending it! I had contacted bethesda support pretty quickly and they said the same thing. I know when a deal is too good to be true 😂. Thanks for the reply though.
---
Dark matter skin was so weak imo its literally the same as the original just a few shades darker, really that's all Bethesda come come up with? Wheres my gilli paint for fixer cr and handmade
---
The only thing that gave me a yikes was that bullshit you just typed out.
---
Totally. Being able to have an overhead view would be a huge help too.
---
I'd rather sit out of the way and not compromise the Event. I may not get as much XP as others but free stuff is always a bonus. If I get a Legendary I can't use I may sell it for super cheap unless it goes for a lot of script.
---
(looks at 2 blank stars)
---
sure
---
More of a pro tip about the new content.
---
When doing wastelanders quest line, complete both sides up to the vault raid ( for max rep gain in the story ).  Then, no matter which side you do the raid with, keep the gold for yourself.  There's no gain to siding with either foundation or crater.  But you will lose 500 gold ( 2 1/2 days worth in real time ).
---
Uh... while you're at it, please look into making .44 skins work on the Western Revolver since it's the same issue and damn do I want that sweet gold atom skin for my Westerns.
---
They could add the glow effect to Green Thumb and I wouldn't be mad.
---
More stash space, from early on. 400 to 800
---
I love my armor as it is, thank you very much.
---
so would you say this is more of a true solo game at it's core?
---
Nice catch, would it be unpolite to answer how much did you pay?
---
? They are still there, no?
---
Also, frog legs is overrated.
---
Love it when someone posts this and doesnt know about game design
---
Nay
---
Funniest part is how long they take lining up that first hit.
---
No it is the same weapon the fixer is just a unique variety of the combat rifle just like the all rise is still a super sledge or the old guard is still a 10mm smg
---
Good point
---
It's worse than a circle.   It's a sphere.   I have a treehouse that's roughly 9 stories high.  In the center,  I could technically go up another stoy if the tree branches weren't in the way, but am told that I am outside the build area if I try to go any wider in some spots,  despite it looking like it's within the envelope of the build circle/ cylinder. 
---
Just make is a cube,  ffs.
---
I had that issue when 76 came out all the time. It actually drove me to stop playing because it seemed to happen on every mobile. I'd knock something down a ton with one non auto rifle shot, and it'd zoom back up in health after a moment. I haven't played for a few weeks and while it still happened, it was maybe a little less than 10% of the time instead of 80%.
---
It's really depressing to hear this is back.
---
I just got back into it last week too, so i only know a little myself. 
---
do the  new npc quests you get a backpack eventually. 
---
There are dailies for both the raider and settler factions. Raiders award an ammunition maker and settlers a super fertilizer thing. Not sure on the specifics tho im no where near getting them yet.
---
95% of players are playing alone. Most players don't even use a mic, heck I don't even have the volume on when I play.
---
Most people who are playing with others are playing with people they know already. Or people they've met threw reddit or discord
---
Kill them with kindness. Or, heal them with maliciousness?
---
Yeah all explosive teslas shoot an explosive projectile, and lost the ability to bounce to multiple targets. I'm not a fan of explosive teslas.
---
&gt;	adams 
---
Heh that made me giggle
---
Finishing the season doesn’t have to mean we can’t have dailies/weeklies with rewards
---
Actually making choosing a side count.  I have not reason to run thru wastlanders on any of my alts because everyone doesnt give a shit what you do or who you sided with.
---
Keep grinding. It seems like you're behind but if you're around level 50 right now you should be fine. Halfway in levels, a little over a third of the way in points.. but the heaviest points are on the last 10 levels which is where you should have the atoms for if you didn't get all spendy before then.
---
I'm OK with something not everyone gets, prizes are meaningless if everyone gets first place, but I will point out that 1500 atoms for the last 10 levels doesn't seem like a lot, when you consider Beth would charge 1500 atoms for just one PA skin.
---
Only if you want to limit yourself for no reason other than the hell of it. 
---
Unyielding armor is fine how it is. Other legendary effects should be brought up to par to allow more diverse builds.
---
Oh your poor budget with those small letters. 
---
Jk great build. I just got my first inferno PA last night.
---
Fixed, sorry for typo!
---
Make sure and check your back flap! I got mine last weekend and it cracks me up
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the case
---
I feel the same about SS armor. I do a roll here or there. But I have no expectation of it replacing my current armor set. 30 roll and not a one is as good as what I’m wearing.
---
Also if you wanna level faster get you some Cranberries for Cranberry Cobbler and do the Feed The People event for the food reward. Both give an added boost to XP on top of the team bonus. You'll rank in no time.
---
Yeah had that happen a bunch of times last night while sniping super mutants, absolutely aggravating.
---
not true... getting onto roofs &amp; jumping in every gunfight errantly is a huge advantage
---
Join the Tadpoles and do Tadpole and Possum challenges to get a high level backpack and, eventually, high capacity and other mods for it.
---
&gt; headshots / weakspots hit in manual aiming do more damage. you will see yellow numbers instead of white.
---
I suggested adding perk that increases this yellow damage just like perk that increases VATS crit damage
---
Robotic flies.
---
Def the secret fireplace door I love it.. planetarium was biggest disappointment it doesn’t light up bright enough
---
Needs two bears high-fiving
---
Absolutely no doubt. The daft thing is people will farm the ghouls and not take any ore. Getting even 1 reward level up will spawn deathclaws and floaters which are way higher xp earners. Ghouls aren't great for it. I think there's a lot of misinformation on that from back when they were bugged and gave boss level xp.
---
I just equip philanthropist those rubes never know they are benefiting from me eating corpses
---
Yes new weapon. No new skin. Yes.
---
Yep, 2 people can nail it pretty quickly.
---
But that would make sense, we can't have that.
---
Seriously why the hitboxes are circular and not square for 'stationary' objects in the game is beyond me. I'm sure its something to do with the engine...
---
I used the whole thing.
---

---
I’m terrible at NW and had frog legs. Now I just get killed in midair.  :(
---
Haha ye i never knew something that small eats my budget up so much
---
If you take a more sneaky approach frog legs is a huge disadvantage. You can be seen from a mile away and easy pickings for a skilled sniper.
---
Tse was nerfed hard. Ts now gives 25% and e gives 20% so a Tse is 45% boost instead of the 200% it use to be
---
I do a run of huntersville, west tek, harpers ferry and then the burrows. I’m level 367 so most enemies spawn in around 48 to 68. With  xp buffs it’s a great route to get lots of xp. When I finish I server hop and start again.
---
It's working now.
---
Exactly!
---
Sorry was winding down for the night when I typed that. 😓
---
Yes it does.
---
I just want better base building not gonna lie
---
Hi it's me, Hodd Toward and I can confirm Todd is Godd.
---
No pun intended..
---
Just grinding events while always using brain fungus soup and bloodied unyielding to boost my intelligence and cranberry relish for extra 25% xp at all times. Double xp weekend with lunchboxes boosted the hell out of my levels as well
---
77 is great it’s only been 3 weeks
---
exploit. probably not a bannable one but you never know
---
yes but any late game 1v1 near the tail end of the game is going to be won by frog legs + power armor + 50 cal combo. I’ve probably played 50 matches where this had happened prior to obtaining the card myself. You’re doomed unless they’re oblivious
---
*_WE DEMAND AUTO SAWS_*
---
My friend shares Stranger in Numbers, which changes the Marsupial mutation into a radical double jump.
---
I picked up a 1\* two-shot .50 calibre from a queen run (not off the queen but another legendary).  Are these worth a damn?  I use a couple of big guns, but only for queen battles (plasma gat and an ultracite laser gat).  Wondering if this might be a better weapon for big fights.  My normal mode is stealth and silenced rifles.
---
Ah damn, I hope you find what your looking for my guy
---
We left sorry. Add my PSN and we can sort it out tomorrow
---
I noticed that doing PVP in workshop yesterday. I was pleased as I thought they finally removed it so I could stop using stealth boys for PVP and we could fight like men. 
---
But if understanding you correctly, only railway rifle VATS still works in PVP? Guess ill be listening for that choo choo.
---
Yeah it's a blueprint exploit. May be a ban-worthy infraction, or may not be. Best to err on the side of a possible ban-worthy offense since it is an exploit.
---
People will always complain about everything doesn’t mean shouldn’t do it
---
Especially something that can be freely placed on very different terrains and structures. 
---
Can set a single “distance from camp structure” line rather than mapping a cube area, or, what would likely happen, mapping a sphere then cutting it into a cube. 
---
Workshop areas can be deliberately and specifically mapped because they don’t move. 
---
It’s not impossible to make a cube build area for camps, it’s just kinda pointless. People are expecting a cube to be drawn around the outside of the current sphere, when in reality, it’s more likely the edges of t sphere would be cut to make a cube. 
---
Maximum space for minimum coding/server impact = sphere. 
---
Good trick for building tall, try and find a high place to drop your camp structure. The sphere is centred on where you place it.
---
Instigating is great and so is bloodied if that’s your build. The bloodied is just slightly more powerful then the instigating would be.
---
How do you find something that disappears? the new one is walking up to the kill and it disappears right in front of you, gone, nada. Just keep moving nothing to see here bug...
---
Hello, Mr. House. ;)
---
I wish. However, Fallout 4 (on PC) has a mod that's REALLY good as far as a Bestiary and lore is concerned. It has a lot of info on locations, animals, PA, etc. and all told through audio by a good voice actor. You can also read it and it's more for immersion than locating anything.    
---
For 76, I believe it could be done with text-only and would be a good addition to the game.    
---
Here's the mod just in case you play Fallout 4.    
---

---
A behemoth camp ally. That wears a tiny pink filly frock, serves tea and rides a tiny little pushbike when following me on adventures.
---
Bulk up mats that you never use and sell those. I get my vendor cap when I log in everyday doing this. I don’t use asbestos, cloth, leather, etc. I basically only use ammo crafting mats and some plastic here and there so I get rid of all that other junk
---
I'd actually love to see an Enclave mission where after we are elected President via the cut content and get access to the room in the Whitesprings bunker, we get a message from a private radio set in there from Eden. Maybe we get a brief vertibird trip to Raven Rock, then get a wacky order to go and kill Modus on our return and to resign to Eden. That would be trippy and could be a unique way to tie these two, extremely close chapters together.
---
Yeah, should have written it in the post :-/ But i think, the problem is solved, you have to get them from the terminal in the fire department.
---
You're really missing out without mutations.
---
That's a great tip, thanks! I'll take a look later today.
---
I also have the same issue on the pc game pass version but instead of being reset to 0 mine goes to 120 but every time I complete an atom challenge it tells me ive got 560, only seems to reset when i go into the atomic shop. Is there a way around this?
---
I still have moments where the amount I’m hitting things for doesn’t add up to how much is taken off their health (or they heal up the majority of it). 
---
I’ve noticed this happens when they are fighting other things or players of lower level. It’s as if they are not allowed to take more than a certain amount of damage from any source. 
---
I’ve also seen that I’m simply not getting the sneak attack bonus because they are engaged with something else, even though I’m not seen by my target.
---
Yeah, I have built 7 story tall apartment buildings. I am familiar with the sphere around you. I think the square requires more math in 3D than sphere in the programming though.
---
Or let them be the new owner of the Atom Shop.  XDDDD
---
I hope the info helps.  You can turn in 20 treasury notes per day for 10 bullion each so 200 bullion per day.  Once a week you can buy 600 bullion for caps from Smiley at the wayward.  So if you are dedicated you can get 2,000 bullion per week.  The grind to max rep took me several weeks for both factions.  There are people who have discovered “farming routes” for faction rep.  I didn’t do that, I used the daily’s and the photo op daily to grind rep.  I did discover a few random encounter sites on my own (sloccum joes -forest, radio station- mire, and the train cars east of Lewisburg Station) and the mirelurk quest at Ohio River adventures.  For some people the rep grind wasn’t the worst of the two but for me the rep grind was slower.  The reason the stealth suit is so amazing is because you can move while crouched and you remain invisible, where as chameleon armor breaks your invisibility when you move.  What system are you on?  I’m sure I have a max level chameleon armor piece on Xbox you can have free of charge if you are looking to upgrade your armor while you grind.
---
u/Ladydevann now that Wastelanders is out, Will PvP get some content or polish in the future? Maybe with the One Wasteland balancing?
---
Nope, it immediately says it’s obstructing. It’s crap
---
I’ve been sharing adamantium skeleton.
---
Are there any complaints about THAT perk from any of the peanut gallery???   We arent always in power armor and there isnt a one perk fits all
---
Looks pretty good. And yes Adrenaline is still broken. In the meanwhile try running Dodgy or Evasive. Tenderizer is good for the high dmg output. Even at only 6%, when you're hitting for 8k, adds another 480 😁
---
😆 Imagine the epic food you can make.
---
they said that NW has great pvp but i only really see stories about bush wookies, whats great about that Bethesda? lol
---
Disagree, you have no chance of getting out of gunfire without it
---
ya but at that point that's on you. Bethesda can only warn you so many times.
---
Beam Splitter adds 5x for each beam and 2x for each shot plus secondary explosion which means 10 times faster breakdown per shot. 
---
Pretty ridiculous imo.
---
I reported someone else for this the other day, also on ps4.  Had 8 of them at a whitesprings camp.   Just report and move on.  It's all we can do.
---
Some perks related to weapon and armor condition aren't working as much
---
Ok. Yes, that’s where they are.
---
special stats should be capped at 30
---
If this keeps this way, not gonna happen. My CAMP is unmovable.
---
It should be a feature, not a perk.
---
Try out the suggestion from this post?  I've tried it some.  Haven't done extensive testing but it seems to help.   Not to say there shouldn't be an actual fix, but its probably better than getting enough levels to swap your build.
---

“Enclave Goals!”
---
This has been an issue since the release of wastelanders, it is probably the single most documented issue since wastelanders release. So far Bethesda has not even acknowledged it is an issue let alone a time table to fix it.
---
It is all over youtube, twitch vods and various social media clips not to mention who knows how many bug reports.
---
There is a new aspect to the issue now, the phantom shot bug, you push the trigger the weapon goes through the shot animation, your ammo count goes down, but the weapon does not actually fire.
---
yeah fun...
---
Max per piece is at 4 right now with Unyielding and any +1 S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat. Even with that high of buffs, remember that it doesn't include any Endurance so you're overall health doesn't benefit from it.
---
Blocker, ricochet, serendipity and fireproof all help to some degree.
---
Revert them back to atoms when you finish the legendary run would be freaking top. But won't happen. Ever.
---
I guess I will do this. Just wanted to be sure.
---
Came on seen message but guess not online
---
I don’t know how you could look at those pictures and not understand the frustration lol. I didn’t even put the trailer in, where PvP was the first thing shown
---
It is, because nobody in the industry can do this.
---
Mutants unite!
---
If you don’t play it you don’t have an opinion.
---
Cook the meat, particularly glowing steak from Uranium fever.  That plus purified water from extractors typically gets me to 1400 in a day.
---
Sell stuff in vending machines, fusion cores, plans, ammo.  If they're cheap they'll sell and that can often get you more than you can get from the vendor.
---
Do events.  Manhunt is 120 caps in 2 minutes.  Plus caps off bodies, plus ammo off bodies, plus fusion core from damn etc.
---
This hasn't happened as I've only been doing it recently for the Score. After it's claimed I leave. I don't think you get notifications it's taken but I could be wrong. This char has a Chameleon piece so pop a squat and wait.
---
I share strange in numbers, scrapper, travel agent or radicool depending on what others are sharing or if we're all bloody.
---
I hate when people share sunkissed.
---
I dislike it when multiple people are sharing the same perk.
---
I love it when some big baller sharing a lvl. 3 perk that I normally run myself because it lets me try playing with different perks.
---
Generally speaking, I feel like it's a bit of a waste to share lvl.1 cards of popular perks that can be leveled up (inspirational) because unless team members are really low level it seems like they should already be using a higher level card.
---
Why use VATS anyway? VATS has been pretty pointless for years and its only reason for existing...pausing things to let you be picky choosey about your next move...is gone in 76 due to multiplayer.
---
I can't completely agree.
---
If they're frustrated maybe they should go play a game that's actually focused on PVP.
---
You have HP jumps? Lucky I can hit 7 headshots in vats and see my damage numbers hitting and the npc not take a bit of damage. I’ll waste 10 rounds and then exit vats and reenter for it to actually work.
---
“PvP will be a focus after wastelanders”
---
Your gonna get down voted by non americans cause they think dc is in washington
---
Got it, I’ll see what I can do. Any ideas where I can get a suppressor?
---
THIS for me I just sella  ton of water every day instantly get my 1400 soon as I log in from water.
---
I finally finished it last night with the Raiders.    
---
I have been doing those quests for the Settlers as well and don't remember my rep with them. From what I've been told you can buy from both but whichever side you don't choose will have their rep lacking.
---
Probably not bannable but that guy can never delete those 5 factories now. RIP his budget.
---
I was well into double digit nuke drops before I realized you can use Master Hacker and Picklock to bypass most of the BS in the silo. You can also turn the turrets on the assualtrons which saves a ton of ammo
---
After getting hit with the autocomplete bug for the first time yesterday, I'm incredibly apprehensive about this.
---
Assaultrons are made by RobCo, House founded RobCo.
---
He likely has backdoors to all the Assaultrons, Protectrons, Sentrybots, maybe even the turret systems.
---
I joined a random team and some dude started spamming me aggressive messages telling me to share nerd rage (he was bloodied) so instead I put on rad sponge to screw with him.
---
lol i thought i understood the frustration? the pvp aspect seems non existant, not by the players but by bethesda's efforts, but in that picture chain bethesda says that nw offers "great" pve but i constantly see people asking for the survival mode that would seem to be the pvp the community wants but hey i could be completely wrong here, i mean if i am im not trying to offend anyone in pvp i would like for them to get the modes they were advertised and want
---
last thing I want to see is more NPCs that I cant shoot in the face to death...
---
Why do all the cool “rewards” that people kind of want have to be busted?  Ammo converter I’m looking at you.
---
Can't come soon enough.  After being level 79-80 with 6+weeks to go the off-season will feel long with no free stuff to earn!   Hard to get burnt out when the tasks only take a few minutes to complete every day.
---
I do the same thing. Mostly because it's the only perk I can share because my Charisma is so low 🤣
---
lame, they really don't have much to share i guess.
---
I’ve been seeing players post they want more PvP options and improvements but when someone walks up to me and slaps me to initiate PvP and I open fire right away and kill them they don’t come back. 
---
So to me it seems like the players who want actual organized, balanced, and civilized PvP are small compared to the amount of people who walk around and try to initiate PvP just to be a dick.
---
I think it’s totally valid to want that natural progression because that’s how Bethesda was marketing acquiring SCORE. Even though not all of the challenges are difficult, many are still the same or similar to what they were before Season 1. It’s not immersive to me when I have to fast travel across the map in search of 3 legendaries.
---
I share whichever I can equip at rank1
---
All I want is for them to rework all notes in the game so I can actually read the damn things.
---
There's a pretty big gain actually if you're grinding out the faction rep. No point having extra gold if you've got nothing to spend it on. You can make back the gold you've gifted to a faction within a couple of days of grinding treasury notes.
---
[How about no](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/a1/7a/17a17ae6b93faf667b39af6d8fe34d68.gif)
---
Even mele weapo9are effected, have had so many time connected in vats  I hear the hit connect  see blood splatter  enemy just stands there like  nothing happened.  That or the weapon will refuse to swing even if I have plenty of AP left.
---
Happen to have any others? I just like the tattered look lol.
---
I share scrapper myself, I have the int for it and though it's not a game changer it's a nice quality of life perk
---
That would pretty much ruin the bloodied build.
---
According to community calendar it starts sometime in september.
---
I loveee MODUS it's the only thing left that still has that New Vegas vibe
---
I found her at the tent near the bottom of the top of the world ski run (forest side).   There’s usually a scavenger there now, but that could be because thats the spot from which I ‘adopted’ her...
---
Have also run across her between Posiedon and the train station.  Couple other places in the forest, just cant recall where off the top of my head.
---
Whoops, seems I've slipped and offended some people! I was just suggesting that this is a weird time for this icon. As I said multiple times, I'm not offended and I'm not outraged. Covid also isn't political (atleast generally not outside the US). So I'm not sure why people are saying it is? No need to get hostile. I guess you can if you want? I'm not your mom.
---
Theres an xbox event today i think so theyll probably anounce stuff there maybe
---
Sorry I’m on Xbox.
---
* They deliberately mention Braun, and you wouldn't do that just for laughs. It's a huge red flag.
---
* There's a continuity in that your previous performance is mentioned
---
* Where did everything and everyone go?
---
* Walls of fire don't work like that.
---
Etc. There's a whole bunch of evidence that points to it being a simulation after the first survivors died (well, and one escaped - and there's a time frame discrepancy there, where the logs claims he escaped years after we find the stuff in Adventure)
---
Longshot perk is for ADS
---
I am, I'm not outraged. I just expected other people to be. It's the internet.
---
Yep, if we want them we can craft them
---
Bummer. Ayt mate well thanks for the advice anyway
---
I’ve won quite a few matches without it...
---
Yeah I'm finally level 51 in nw but must get to 100 for that X-03.
---
True, but there's zero upside to allying with either side.  Short of a few pieces of dialogue.  Beth dropped the ball on that one.  The negative hit from screwing over 1 side is barely anything.  The gold gain is better in my opinion.
---
Ive heard we may get one week to finish one week of normal non score play without seasons and then BOOM
---
but even that was speculation
---
I'm sure you know this but PA and frog legs is a terrible combo because of the superman landing lag. I personally run iron clad instead and it works great for damage mitigation.
---
Why tie your ability to do anything to RNGeezus and a laughably tiny AP bar?
---
I don't even know the VATS hotkey **and I don't want to know.** Manual aim is the only way to go.
---
&gt;  since not only VATS gives you 100% accuracty against moving targets
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3HMALfodb8
---
You haven’t offended anyone? And we weren’t being hostile? It seems you have a problem with interpreting other peoples actions.
---
I usually leave it about 30-60 mins before  logging back in to be on the safe side, with double I'm gunna wait closer to 60 haha
---
I need one more D:
---
Some of them have more value for what they do BTW Like Guns and Ammo 5 and Backwoodsman 3 for instance.
---
Maybe have one display unit and just have your fave covers on there
---
The caps make it so frustrating sometimes. Those treasury notes just build up to be never cashed in.
---
If i didnt do the full double exp weekend id still be grinding, after the weekend ended i was 97 and those last 3 lvls took ages, really painfull
---
The ammo machine and guass minigun would like to have a word with you.
---
What they really need to do is add fireproof as a 9 endurance card so we can counter the gauss shotty explosive builds and it would be nice to dampen a little bit of the ring damage!
---
So true.
---
This has happened to me quite a few times, and unfortunately it's been going on for a long time. Doesn't look to be high on the bug fix to-do list.
---
Got it, I have no idea why I don’t see them as often as you guys do but I’m just going to play the game normally and hope that someone nuke her. That’ll be until I’m able to launch my own nukes
---
Yeah I’m on the lookout for a BE fixer/handmade
---
I agree with this.  Most of my progress has been via the daily/weekly challenges which gets you pretty far and is low level friendly.  
---
I think this OP is right in that vets (unyielding, mutations, god roll weapons) can generate more XP and advance faster and further on the board. But hey, they earned it and there should be some benefit for loyal long term players that grinded for all that great gear.  
---
Overall I’m finding it reasonably balanced.
---
So you make it a square with the same side length as the diameter.
---
Please don't share gun-fu. That's annoying. Anyone who wants gun-fu already runs it. Share some less common perk instead that doesn't change combat interactions.
---
I like when people share stuff like travel agent, curator, cola nut, etc. Stuff that improves without being intrusive.
---
Another one NOT to share is chem fiend. It'll get you booted from a team the same way running sun kissed will. Chem fiend increases the rads removed by radaway, in case you didn't know.
---
I would think a sentient AI would be able to squash anything resembling a backdoor in a matter of minutes but who knows?
---
Hahaha it just happened randomly and it became my best experience in this game. People definitely help a lot
---
I mean, I cringed. That's a reaction? I pointed it out as possibly bad taste. I'm not here nor there, I was curious on the opinion of others.
---
I can only speak for the performance on Xbox 1, but after 1300 plus hrs all of a sudden this game is running like mud. For the last 2 weeks or so my weapon wheel freezes before allowing me to make a selection, meanwhile the game itself isn't frozen so I am still being attacked while momentarily(up to 10 seconds) being stuck. Also my fps has been even lower then the average of 30 or so, it bogs out way more then previously. I have a feeling the automated vendor bots in camps, as well as other automated camp items is bogging the servers. The more stuff, the lower the performance.

There not competing with Xbox Showcase live. After all Fifa is announcing there newest Gambling er surprise er suck your wallet dry mechanic

I know. Doesn't matter to me. I sell all mags for 25 caps, no matter their perceived value. One man's trash and whatnot..
---
Herbivore and carnivore only apply to crafted foods.
---
Edit: The negation of filling the hunger bar I’m referring to.
---
Yeah i think bethesdas atbthe event so some news might be dropped there in lue of an ITV this week, then next weeks can be aboutbwhat they said at this event
---
Make the Flare Gun highlight dead corpses. Literally run down the office hall, grab a member of the Skyrim team along  with the Detect Dead spell, add it to 76. How has this not be a meeting topic? 
---
Better yet. Make the Flare gun alert other players to you. A faster "follow me" emote &amp; highlight the dead.
---
Honestly I lost count of the number of times I've suggested ways to stop this from happening, both here and on the PTS forums, since A Colossal Problem is 100% going to suffer from the same problem after the novelty wears off.
---
Even something as simple as moving part of the XP and all the loot to an end of dungeon crate that only opens if the event is successful would help encouraging people to actually help with the objectives in *so* many events.
---
Gravy.
---
As a vats user, gun-fu can be a real pain in the ass. It targets each next closest target. Not each next target you might choose to hit. Last thing I want when picking off the biggest threats in an oncoming mixed mob of weak and strong enemies is a perk deciding for me. Also forces you to back out of vats if you weren’t going to shoot again right away. I’ve used it on occasion and it isn’t worth the risk. Can use manual vats much quicker. Just an FYI.
---
The worst thing is, in a post-apocalyptic world if you were stocked with rocket launchers and missiles you would be the guy running the show.
---
Yet Bethesda has managed to build a world where rocket launchers are essentially useless.
---
The rep grind is long no matter how you slice it.  But getting the ss armor from Regs is way better.  The ammo machine is good but not game changing, I find more buying from players typically.  Gauss minigun is a monster,  but so is the plasma caster.  And it's available right away.
---
Its happened a few times. Not just at whitesprings but west tek, the prison, even had it with a grafton monster once before. Its rare but iv had it a lot more often since patch 20. Whats worked for me in the past is to walk around and look at the corpse at different angles. Crouched and standing up. Sometimes the loot menu will pop up. Sometimes it wont.
---
I logged in over 6 hours after the reset yesterday, still got hit.
---
Old world food are not affected by carnivore or herbivore
---
Yea that the problem the cap , I could grind 300 treasury note per week doing Public events nonstop with my friends 
---
I should be able to trade them all at once and not 20 per day
---
Leave build mode, wait five seconds, reenter build mode. 
---
I had the same thing with mine, swapped the floors just fine after doing that.
---
I am relaxed. I was just curious about opinions of others. Mostly why I asked for opinions. I'm not stressing out about it or anything. I'm also not saying anyone should be mad about it. I'm not asking people to get mad about it. I was just saying it feels like weird timing.
---

Why strange in numbers if you don’t mind me asking? I had it for a bit but recently I’m using aqua girl. (I can’t figure out how to share more than 1 perk 😔)
---
Oh wow that sucks, I luckily haven't been hit once and I'm usually on within an hour of reset, wonder what's actually causing it then.
---
Legacy behavior when you could milk the event for the entire 25 minutes....right now, it's just better to let it go &amp; kill as many ghouls as you can.
---
Otherwise, the event will fail.
---
Unfortunately not. Sorry
---
This
---
100%. I stopped using VATS for my shotgun because I have no idea if the other 100+ damage pellets are stacked behind the single 100+ damage indicator, or if it's only doing a single pellet worth of damage.  Out of vats, I see all the pellet damage indicators.  Much more satisfying.

I was about L27 the first time I went after the sword.  Low level leather armor, and the best weapon I had was a L20 vampire machete.

Spoiled veggies give health back to carnivore as well
---
Really, I did not know that. In fact I always wondered why that time setting was on the Xbox. Thank you I'm going to give it a try over the weekend.
---
More predictable arrival locations when going to your camp
---
Yeah, it seems like going through the enclave to find a key card takes a long time.   I usually stumble across them.  
---
Is it possible to create hardened mass?  I'm always getting ionized meat or glowing mass.   What am I supposed to do with those?
---
Don't know about immersive. I found that more when is was just holotapes and dead folk than hearing 10 people's identical views on fog.
---
I would avoid beating on frozen inactive enemies too much. I've experienced times where apparently I managed to unfreeze the mob but not the visual of said enemy.. leading to me getting torn up by an Invisible enemy I cant defend myself from.
---
People grouped with me at the time were just like,  wat??
---
Another tip,  find a good niche of items to sell in your vending.  Then you'll never have a caps issue.  Also, make your vending easy to find and don't put it behind a rad sprayer.  You'd be surprised how many people don't get that concept.
---
I'm just impatient I'm super close the the secret service ghillie.
---
I wrote about this last week I think - they really just need to things that any level player can do. The Buy/Sell from other players would be a decent one - it would promote vending more. Kill X Creatures, especially if they are Ghouls or Scorched or something that is more common. Complete X Events would encourage more people to participate in events. Harvest challenges are ones we haven't seen for a while. Could also add a cooking repeatable.
---
This hit my funny bone 8 times!  :D
---
If you have enough overseer tickets, you can just buy it.
---
I'm lvl 456 and it takes me roughly half an hour to level up. Gotta farm high level mobs.
---
I agree that the other challenges are low level friendly and the level up challenge does come easier, however like someone else said high levels have the flexibility to create an alt toon to get the level up challenge quickly, if necessary, plus they can roll the repeatable challenge much easier than people new to the game. Just seems to me the score system favors long time players.
---
Maybe this bias to high levels can be considered a loyalty bonus. I’m trying to also give a nod to the small guy.
---
Yes but be prepared for the terrible recoil
---
I dont have any problem with V.A.T.S.  Couldnt say that i need it a lot bcz it does look like legal cheat but when I need the fastest time (launchbox is activated or other buffs) it works perfectly.
---
Oh I'll definitely keep playing, but I know I'll never make it and that's fine. Just a shame that for missing a day or two for work I'm hopelessly behind.
---
I understand how you feel about 'winning the prize', but that's looking at it as a competition instead of an event. For me I look at these as events, not competitions. It's not about "look what I did and you didn't" it's about the game play to get there, which is how most games look at these sorts of events. It's the participation they're after, getting people playing, not setting many up to fail so they have to buy out of it.
---
I can actually explain this one. If you look at the model for spoiled veggies it's a bowl with worms and maggots inside it. Yum!
---
Yes now that you bring it up that's very true. In fact proton VPN allows that. I also just heard from another player that if I adjust the clock on my Xbox I can hook into servers in that time zone. I'm going to give it a try on a weekend.
---
I think it’s the devs trolling people, as those two types of ammo are utter useless but may keep you from fast traveling if you were near weight limit.
---
Ground Pounder ftw!
---
They want to stretch out spawns for the full 10 mins
---
the worst and most expensive ammo in the game
---
Well, that's obviously not true.
---
Protein is protein.......and don’t go there!
---
How so?
---
If take the diameter of the circle to make the sides of the square, we'd get more space no? When it comes to space, it's about surface area.
---
Explosives, in general, are horrible all around.
---
No. Past few days I've logged in for a few minutes in the morning (4+ hours before daily challenge reset) to reset my Scrip clock and check vendors for ammo. No NW during that time.
---
Life saver!
---
Interesting. So the theory is she cannot target you on the bunker, the fence or a tent? Because there isn’t a clear path to attack?  She can hit you while on a tent or the fence. The bunker is a little more challenging. Heck I had one land in outside a group of trees to attack. I was a little surprised since I just had joined the event and was making my way to the group. 😂
---
Idk if you noticed too, one of the salisbury steaks is affected by carnivore and the other isnt. Weirdness
---
I myself skip most of it thanks to a certain glitch. Otherwise I wouldn't even bother with them cause it's so tedious doing the same thing for each silo. Would be nice to get a lil variety with them. Heck having a couple different rotations for them that change the tasks would be nice.
---
PS4 - Same here for the last couple days.  If you pan the aim dot around the body long enough, you may get lucky and hit the hotspot for loot - but it is very small, and takes time to find.
---
I lost a legendary the same way - froze in position, and I could not find the hotspot.
---
Same. All the matches I've won no one in the last circlr uses it.. I honestly thought it was a terrible perk coming into NW and apparently its good?
---
There's a huge disadvantage to being up in the air so I dont get the logic. Is it relying on your opponent not being able to shoot? 
---
The only advantage I've seen is that they can get on buildings.
---

Seriously? I’ve found a little girl standing over a grave, but no interactive dialogue. It’s kind of unsettling when NPCs just say their lines and you can’t do anything.

He scares u? His jibberish is annoying as hell. I wish we could just pull the plug!
---
A spherical camp uses polar coordinates (one distance and two angles from center) for placing objects rather than cartesian coordinates (X Y Z distances from some point), maybe that was better for the server for saving the CAMP data somehow. Or it was just an arbitrary decision.
---
If they change it though that would require changing a piece of the engine essentially, and they would have to run through everyone's data to convert the coordinates.
---
Stupidest change ever.
---
Since the nerf they are useless. I chuckle each time i see a noob shooting mini nukes or missiles at the Queen.  
---
Missiles at least can be sharded for ammo points, tho.
---
People want to make any excuse they can for losing
---
I figured someone might have. I just didn’t do my homework.  I hope you received lots of upvotes!
---
It's just fits the setting more. Pristine, shiny nice things should be a rarity. Things people of the wasteland would cover from pre war.
---
The stair trick works really well. I've built a mining hq office tower using it and it's quite nice.
---
How do you make legendaries?
---
&gt; 1st I feel the whole reason VATS exists is that the way weapons feel and respond in the FO games is kinda pathetic compared to other shooting games
---
Nah. VATS is a thing because A: Bethesda needed to throw console players a bone back in Fallout 3 because manual aiming on a joypad is cancer and B: they wanted to theme it in a way that harkens back to the turn based games that came before. IT's always been fucking useless to anyone with a mouse.
---
The guns feeling like airsoft toys isn't really related to VATS. They feel like airsoft toys outside of VATS too. I tweaked the multipliers in FO4 from 1.something to 6 and the game's combat came alive.
---
I've done that by mistake because I couldn't hear it playing after the voiceover had finished and assumed it was off already.
---
Strange In Numbers benefit mutations and increase all the effects by 25%. It allows everyone on the team who is mutated to be more benefited with those mutations 😊 Mutations are extremely useful 
---
You can only share 1 perk. You can share 2point perks or 3point perks depending on your charisma. 3 Charisma = 1 Point you can share.
---
It's the base cost plus 160xp + base etc per level after 100 iirc
---
But I agree. I am 539 and it dings about 16 times now per level
---
As long as there is new content to go along with season 2, I don't think it will be too bad. With BOS and Wendigo Colossus event coming next month, I think that will breathe some new life into Season 1 and those who feel like they are on too much of a repeatable grind. While I can see the player reason for wanting to take a break (and I have taken breaks between new content releases), I also see why BSG wants to keep it going - too long between new content and you will lose players.
---
I guess, but when your a member of the only faction that matters, the enclave, then you like your stuff to look nice.
---
It's mashed potato which is a vegetable.
---
Yes, but use the recoil compensating stock! I have an executioner's explosive and it's so much fun. Be prepared for insane ammo weight unless you're using 2 ranks of bandolier.
---
Yeah, I’m keeping Blocker for now and Serendipity is almost as impactful as Nerd Rage and Radicool for this build, so it will always be included. Yeah. Do you think Fireproof is more useful than Iron Clad/Rad Resistance or Refractor?
---
...and they are pretty obvious when on buildings so that's not always an advantage. Just about any good building rooftop has a way upthere that doesn't require frog legs.
---
That's why you try to find with with less vats cost and run it in vats only :p
---
Got a bloodied with ffr and less vats cost. It's a beast on full auto with vats. But god damn those spikes weigh too much.
---
Yes but only usable in vats,its damn good tho
---
I display mine, it's kinda hard to complete and they look really nice. Otherwise I still go back on the routes and collect what I find to sell, they weigh next to nothing and are an easy 100 caps.
---
They think they can milk it for spawns/XP. If they want to do that crap, they need to take it to a private server.
---
I just finished that questline last night. So is there a list of quests which reward the notes?  
---
Does that char get specialized quests now that it's done?  
---
I have only played Fallout 3 and newer on PC and also play games on PS4. Thanks for the offer. This is the first time I've finished that so I don't know what and how things work in this regard that well.
---
I like that, I do.i think I will try that out. I know people freak out when they find my camp and either think that the items I have in my vendors were priced incorrectly or something but I have everything Big Lots prices. Three star handmades, yeah might go as high as 2grand. I never price anything over three thousand for stuff.
---
I love this idea! I haven't even began to make a actual home base yet though. Haven't found like a prime spot yet.
---
(Gnome chuckle)
---
You used to be able to farm the event by turning off the jukebox. A while ago they updated it and set a more strict time limit.
---
Some older players might think it's still the other way.
---
Play
---
And an overhead view of your area while you’re placing your camp
---
Oof in power armor ? I had someone doing this next to me the other day, which only decreased my damage since the queen would hit the other player- also staggering me and getting me out of sneaky time minimizing my damage to a third of what it could be. Lol but non the less- bold strategy cotton.
---
This is going to sound super sketch, but hear me out on this...
---
If you remember where you killed them, leave the area and come back in about 10 mins. The bodies will have despawned, and there won't be any meat piles. Go to where you killed them and look around, they will be invisible, but you can loot the bodies that way.
---
I had that happen a couple times with legendary bodies, was bummed and ran around for a bit. Got a disease and came back to use the sulfur fountain--for the hell of it, went to see if anything had respawned for more quick xp, but found the invisible lootable bodies instead 👍
---
Potatos are a starch?
---
I just remember arguing with my math teacher (also a CFL Hall of Famer) about this year's back. I had the same question as you. Didn't make sense to me. 
---
This is just a copy paste job, because I'm not mathematically inclined enough to know the breakdown off the top of my head.
---
The area of a square is s2 , where s is the side length. But s = P/4, so the area of a square is P2 /16. Since 1/(4π) &gt; (1/16), the circle has more area than the square.
---
Yup, have noticed that too.  Sometimes I'm several feet away from the body and the menu pops up.  Like it registers the original standing point of the feral rather than where the body lands.  And other times, like the case of the 3-star, I walk around in an ever growing circle, hoping to hit that menu sweet spot, but no joy.
---
I've had my AP drain to zero with Action Boy on and it wouldn't recharge until I took something like hard lemonade, even at 100% food and water.
---
If you find the log cabin bundle wasn't a good purchase, you can try and ask for a refund. When I bought it by mistake the day it was released CS removed it from my account and gave me the atoms back.
---
I'm not really saying it isn't a simulation, but I really don't think so. There isn't any real evidence pointing to that other than the fact we are playing within a universe governed by videogame rules
---
You're points...
---
*Braun was Vault Tec's head scientist. He would be directly linked to all Vault experiments. He is also mentioned by the Vault 88 Overseer. That wasn't a simulation. 
---
*You must know the Nuclear Winter story, if not I guess this is a spoiler.  The whole kick of the story is that no matter how many times you win you will always have to go back in. Even when you hit lvl 100, you only find out that you are even more screwed. 
---
*I'm pretty sure the running story/theme/whatever of FO76 is that the best and brightest came out into a pretty untouched piece of pristine land to make the world a better place,  ut just end up strait up ruining it after getting their hands on nuclear armament. If Nuclear Winter happens after all of that shit went down, I would assume that all the people died in WV's 3rd apocalypse. 
---
*The wall of fire is a game mechanic. You can't really take a game mechanic into account for story canon. Realistically, weather would really just blow the fallout in a single direction. Given the locations that are consistently nuked, I would say the forest (where both NW battle areas are) would actually be the last place that there would possibly be relatively safe areas for a short time
---
The teddy bear giggle.
---
Right now nobody uses aimbots in adventure mode, but if there's a perk that gives a bonus for manual aiming we'll see people doing it, just like in Nuclear Winter.
---
Maybe if they start banning people more readily for using aimbots it won't be a concern anymore.
---
How about no? it's a terrible idea and downvoting this isn't going to suddenly make it a good one.
---
That's the thing, I don't mind PVP. However, there's a time and a place and a PVE workshop mechanic doesn't seem the place for it. That's not to mention PVP in Fallout is god-awful, offering very little in the general scope of the game.
---
Oo also- in agility I highly recommend ninja 3! I’ve been playing with different set ups but since adrenal reaction is broken at the moment I’ve been running - ninja 3, action girl 2, marathoner 2, evasive 1, sneak 2, escape artist 1. Ninja will bring your damage up from 300-1000 to 600-3000 per hit.

When you meet someone you cannot kill but you can hurt them. And they're like 'UGHH!' 'AGHH!' 'UAGHH' 'UGHHHHH!' while you are doing it to them.
---
*Add some to earn with gameplay, too.*
---
I don't understand the logic behind this in the game. Yes I get that they reuse voices for different unnamed characters, but why have them all record the exact same line? I really hope that as new content is released, they add new and different lines to characters. Especially Ward. I've helped him dozens of times. I don't just "finally have the guts to help."
---
All of it.
---
As level 532, I find it hard to find players of equal level...instead I just focus on helping others.
---
If that thing had the faster fire rate, and just about any minor, (but just two shot and fire rate would be excellent) it would be a \*VERY\* good .50 cal, one I'd be first in line to buy. As it stands, it isn't worth much caps wise. IMO, if you're built for stealth and silenced rifles, stick with those. If you have access to private servers, (Or a friend who does, and doesn't mind taking time to let you mule) You could always give it to an alt to use until they find something better.
---
That's super weird!  I'll try it next time though.  Cheers!
---
The only difference in perks is I use adamantium skeleton 3 and have one more perk in endurance and one less in perception. I also run bloodied- fss st weapons, unyielding secret service armor (which I’m still rolling for +1 str pieces. Most of my pieces are AP refresh and 15%blocking damage). I also use the unarmed attack mod for the arm pieces, sleek mods for the legs, and buttressed chest.
---
So I have 6 charisma. Does that mean I can share 2 perks with 1 star each? Or it doesn’t matter what the rank is?
---
There was a mission called Search Big Bend Tunnel for Survivors.  This led to three fire breather corpses.  The first was outside the entrance to big bend tunnel west, the other two were inside.  The bodies each contained a note you need to acquire.  Then the schematics can be unlocked at the fire station.  
---
I haven’t done this mission since Wastelanders dropped, so I don’t know if it still works.  
---
I do recall trying to make a useful weapon with the scorch killer receivers.  I was disappointed.  Seemed like a fun idea that ran out of funding.  A shame.
---
My current character is a VATS gunslinger with Gun Fu, explosive armor piercing Pipe Revolver. I've been noticing a similar thing where the damage seems to get calculated in stages by modifier and I'll sometimes notice it just not applying the full damage. Could weapon class damage perks be bugged now as well?
---
Couldn’t agree with OP more!
---
Ward runs up to you and says "General..."
---
If you bond with another player, and someone leaves the public group, you will retain your bond for aslong as you both stay on the server. Once one person leaves the server the bond is broken with them.
---
So if your in a two man group and there is another two man group, you can join the other group and retain the bond with the player you were originally bonded with and just need to bond with the new group members.
---
Or group hop as needed and bond with everyone.
---
youcan get them when they turn to meat
---
Yeah I used to have a tse reduced weight but the spike weight and the CND was the worst.
---
I generally run solo, and will join a random build team as dailys dictate.  Level does not matter.   
---
IMHO, wastelanders made teams playing as a coordinated unit  kinda difficult,  as until you raid he vault, many locations are instanced to the player, so the team is left outside, so to speak.
---
Its good to see fellow members of our cause!
---
I just keep turning it back. If they don't get the hint I start one shotting everything!
---
I also tell them over the mic why turning it off is bad.
---
It's a very small hit, the math says the gold takes longer to catch up on
---
So clearly it's just me. I have to find some way to go on without him...
---
For a 100 caps a stranger isn't a stranger anymore.
---
Some of us built our camps there
---
Bethesda makes launchers and ammo so heavy and useless but constantly try and force them on us.  It's so frustrating.  A MIRV fatman should be the most destructive weapon in the game.
---
Rads will pretty much always be a problem out of power armor unfortunately. (Idk about when legendary perks drop, but for now.) I generally try to avoid damage, or do percentage nullification, fireproof may not be as necessary for a build using the grounded mutation but I personally use it because I don't want to lose on the possibility of using energy weapons. My build is based on the concept of being able to use any weapon that is str based, so I can use shotguns, mele, unarmed, or heavy guns which is my primary go to. Not saying I can't use other bloodied weapons efficiently but not as efficient. Honestly I dont even need the heavygun perks for most gameplay, I just use them for extra damage against the queen. Now where you are working on stealth your build may benefiet a little differently than mine.
---
My build if you want to take a peek.

---
Or just new events that spawn more often than the classic events. We are close to 2 years in on this game, I'm sure they have stats on which events less players play. Start reducing how often they appear, and add new ones that make use of NPCs in creative ways.
---
Yes! I’ve had to reset my camp a couple times since there isn’t an easy way to see the full area

Either the clang when you hit an enemy with a shovel or the choo-choo reload sound of the railway rifle
---
Yeah, you do a quest, give a faction photos, something and that rep bar just pops up like hey you did it but nope I'm not moving. 
---
I have donated photos, vacuum tubes, got ex raiders to rejoin and ever other thing that is supposed to give the most reputation. I even gave the raiders their cut of the gold. Still nothing,
---
 it's like they are laughing at me behind my back " look at this jabronee over here doing this shit to make friends, Pathetic."
---
I've played in about 150 different public teams at this point, and have had two players total that wanted to actually play together (I didn't, so we didn't).
---
If you want to actually play with people I think inviting to a private team is still the way to go.
---
For the public teams maybe you'd be more likely to get other people who want to actually team up though if you choose something other than an event or building team. Those two are 99% only used for XP boosting.  Just a thought, might be worth trying to see what happens.
---
On the PTS, yes. On live servers, no.

The Lifegiver perk is great if you have the speed demon mutation.  There's a bug where if you're health drops below 45, moving around will bring it back up to 45 and makes you virtually unkillable (still have to watch out for rads though).  The bug also works with other foods that increase max health like vodka (50) and cranberry meatball grinder (100).  I'd suggest checking out Angry Turtles youtube videos if you're not familiar with this.
---
Based on my personal preferences, the only changes I would make is remove ironclad and mysterious stranger. Move those points to perception so you can pick level 3 locks.  Also, I would use good with salt over bloody mess.  You get 25% melee damage from each of the basic recipes for glowing, mutant hound, and yao guai meat...which is better than the flat 15% from bloody mess.
---
You need lots of score for the last parts ranks.. the daily/weekly score only gets you 15k score/week + repeatable. Thats about 5 ranks on the blue board. You would need to get the repeatable 100score like 30 times for most of the orange ranks... so you are saying that people legit grind millions xp? Sure on the double xp weekend but normally its a chore and takes about 30minutes-60minutes of events with lots of enemies to get the repeatable few times.. so either nasty amount of game time, atoms or cheating 🤷‍♂️ i have 42 hours with my new account and im at rank 40. Have played trough 2 weekly and 8 daily score challenges, none bought with atoms
---
Even the lore really hypes up how powerful these things are. The reason Charleston is destroyed is because an angry raider armed with a Fat Man and mini nukes blew up an entire dam on his own. Meanwhile, it takes 5 shots with the same weapon to kill a big chameleon
---
Amen
---
many people said this already but ill reiterate it:
---
exploration is top tier, i stumble upon all these hidden caves, mines, buildings etc and go in to clear them and amazed everytime
---
When you hit your target with a silenced Fixer SHUCKADUNKUH
---
You’re under the map, not upside down. Once you fall so far down, it places you back on the surface
---
Fireproof isn't really needed if you have the dense mod applied to your chest armor.
---
Is there still a weight limit difference between the small one and the normal one once a mod is applied?
---
For some reason, throughtout the game they keep pushing the fact that your CAMP is mobile, and you can place it anywhere! I don't wanna. I'm pretty sure most people dont wanna. It seems like most people find a spot they like, and that where there camp stays.
---
I bring that up, because I think thats why they would make you pick it up to change it. "You're gonna move it anyways. Its mobile!"
---
EDIT: Who knows if this will change, but in the meantime, blueprints are your friend. Just put your whole camp on a blueprint, and then if and when you have to move it, you can just take the whole thing and put it back down. I know thats still a pain in the ass, because placement restrictions are picky as fuck. But its a temporary solution.
---
I have played on public teams since it’s started. I am more of a loner when it comes to this game. You share what you want or they can leave. Good job on setting that noob straight 👍🏻
---
Even in pve they're insanely unbalanced.
---
This happened to me on Xbox when I nuked white springs in a private server and all the ghouls were already dead. Rebooted and started killing and absolutely 0 loot. Sold all that raw flux at least
---
Exploding Teslas are fun to play with, but essentially useless as anything but a shotgun mod. AFAIK the best combo for the Tesla is Q25FFR with the auto barrel

If you've finished the main game, the seasons adds a lot of incentive to play the game. Once you've done all the quests all there is left is endless events and grinding dat gold. SEASONS adds incentive and goals. I've never seen events and workshops as active as they've been since Legendary Run and Public Teams started.
---
The only direction this game has is to make more money while watering down all gameplay that doesn’t revolve around grinding for atoms or score.
---
No incentive to build cus nothing stays built. 
---
Fallout with no fallout - decisions don’t matter. This game is as flimsy as a mobile game by an indie team. No one would’ve bought 76 if they knew it was just a 60 dollar version of fallout shelter.
---
Ahhhh, memories. I solo killed my first scorchbeast with a rifle just like that.
---
That's because the real Raven Rock is in Pennsylvania, on the other side of the Potomac and way more north. The Raven Rock shown in Fallout 4 is actually closer to real life Mount Weather, and if I'm not mistaken I read that the entrance was also modeled after MtW rather than Raven Rock.
---
Congrats man. I've ben playing off and on since NW was first released and I'm level 27 lol
---
Awesome sounds interesting!
---
Thanks!  Appreciate the feedback.  I haven't used too many of the big guns, but keep a few (3\* Final Word and a 3\* Bloodied LMG as well as the 3\* plasma and laser gats when I have low ammo for the others) since the silenced lever action is rather pointless against the queen.
---
???? Remember there is a reason you cant stack chems
---
Haha LMG go brrrrr
---
Damn I'll take some downvotes but yeah I 100% agree with you
---
Meh... the exact opposite can be said for the other side. There's so few good rewards from completing the event that once you have those they only thing of value is the XP. There's much easier ways to get Treasury Notes. So as long as the NPC stay alive to keep the event running, most don't care about anything else and that's ok. It's how they want to play the game.
---
Yep, on Xbox, I noticed bad(worse) performance immediately after patch 20. I’m guessing all the score additions have something to do with it. Existing bugs got worse, and I’ve noticed a couple times upon entering a new world I can reload like stupid super fast until I change my weapon so I’ve learned to not change my weapon for a bit because speed loading a lever action is awesome lmao. I’ve noticed the weapon wheel thing too which is super annoying because I use 2 guns at queen fights and I change my weapon when I notice she’s about to land...been a couple times now where she’s back in the air by the time I get the right weapon out. And I agree, so much stuff, interactive stuff, that the server has to load in at all times bogs it down so much yet people ignore it and keep asking for more interactive features, which is nice but not so when the game runs like it’s on an old computer.
---
For real. It would be cool though if we could assign them to something else though so she would stay away from her guitar.
---
Damn I forgot about this
---
What outfit is she wearing?
---
Edit: I found it, looks like a PC mod of the nuka girl outfit.
---
Let me know if you're ever interested in taking a look..it's a work in progress but I'm using a shared GoogleDoc.
---
Volume 2 is up to dealing with Beckett and the Blood Eagles....still a ways to go through the Wastelanders DLC (Volume 1 was all Year 1 Reclamation)
---
I think 3 seasons have been confirmed, and 2 and 3 might have fallout 1st bonuses
---
As much as people complain about no text chat on PC, it prevents unsolicited douchebagery like this. I just hope that when they do add text chat like they've promised it's a public server chat only. Discord exists for reason.
---
Like the fireplace door which is the only thing I want
---
read the info that's provided EVERY TIME YOU JOIN THE EVENT!!!
---
I set up all the instruments in my little blues bar in Morgantown so she’d at least play something different hahaha
---
They added logging to better determine how to fix it, they didn't actually fix it.
---
Nice :).  
---
One reason I like walking everywhere instead of using FT - the graphics can be quite amazing.
---
Sidebar - Any idea what outfit that is on the female char?
---
Yo, listen up, here's the story  
---
About a little guy that lives in a ghillie world  
---
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just ghillie  
---
Like him inside and outside  
---
ghillie his house with a ghillie little window and a ghillie Corvette  
---
And everything is ghillie for him  
---
And himself and everybody around  
---
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen (To listen, to listen)
---
I'm ghillie – da ba dee da ba dye, da ba dee da ba dye
---
I have a ghillie house with a ghillie window  
---
ghillie is the color of all that I wear  
---
ghillie are the streets and all the trees are too  
---
I have a girlfriend and she is so ghillie  
---
ghillie are the people here that walk around  
---
ghillie like my Corvette, it's standing outside  
---
ghillie are the words I say and what I think  
---
ghillie are the feelings that live inside me
---
It would be cool if we could send them to use other camp objects, like the FO4 companions. Assign them to crops or  command them to use certain furniture (instead of their unique object).
---
The public events that appear with an exclamation point on the map (the ones that are free to join) will give you treasury notes.  There is a daily quest for each faction; the raiders have two that rotate, but can only do one at a time, these will reward you treasury notes and reputation increases.  Visit Ohio river adventures to find the raiders there, they have a separate daily for raiders rep.  If you have finished the main quest line, the overseer will also gives you a daily quest called “photo opportunity “ that will let you choose which faction you want to gain rep with during the quest.  There are also random encounters throughout the map, these are instances where you will stumble on a group of faction members fighting world enemies.  Like a group of settlers fighting a mob of ticks at sloccum Joes (not always the same).  If you help them defeat the enemies and then talk to them it will raise your reputation respectively.  If you look up the random encounters I’m sure you will find a guide that shows you the possible locations for the random encounters, many people do rep that way.
---
I love my bloodied builds. But i must say, it is insanely OP. I would not like a nerf but i would completely understand IF it happened. The thing is that probably around 80% of the players are bloodied. I dont think bethesda wants to piss of that many People since it would probably be a game breaker for many
---
Thanks, I’d heard it wasn’t affected by anything but bloody mess
---
The twang when you hit something with a guitar sword always amuses me.
---
When people do that I run outside with a gauss shotty and take all the ghouls, that event just a pain to play with others at this point
---
You can only share one card. The card can have multiple points to it depending on your charisma.
---
If your Charisma is 2 or below, you can’t share any cards.
---
If your Charisma is 3-5, you can share a 1 point perk card. 
---
If your Charisma is 6-8, you can share a 2 point perk card. 
---
If your Charisma is 9-11, you can share a 3 point perk card.
---
Etc
---
All of the score rewards are doubled today too :/
---
Showing my age here, but he reminds me a demonic Max Headroom.
---
I love that show
---
Ghoulish 3. I run down, grab ore, come up, deposit, hit the arches, run down to next tunnel, heal up from rads, collect, rinse and repeat
---
Who the feck are you to demand he cannot express an opinion that you dislike. Get over yourself love.
---
Nope, not 100% fixed yet. Hit me for the first time yesterday.
---
There's actually enough budget space to display every magazine? I read there wasn't, this is great news. I'm only 10 away from a full set.
---
I think some dedicated PVP zones for the people that are interested in it would be a good idea. However, a Workshop isn't the place for it, just seems counter-productive to the building/resource generating mechanic of the workshop.
---
Yeah, I do the most damage on her head, if there's someone else around I try to get off to a side though.
---
I got an instigating fast fire Gatling plasma last night though and might switch to it though.
---
nope. But not to worry, it'll be announced when they are.
---
I can one shot a player made turret without a bloodied build. A level 20 super mutant can practically one shot a player made turret. 
---
Turrets do need to be reworked because they're practically useless. But nerfing bloodied? this is pretty much a case of "GIT GUD"
---
Well i simply hided untill i reached top 10 for extra exp, going in full force isnt always the best strategy!
---
&gt;	huffing a few empty bottles
---
If you’re that desperate for a fix, you may need to get help. Maybe just stick to jet.
---
yep, it sucks.
---
As an Herbivore I can still eat Canned Dog Food. It just works.
---
Also, no ITV this week
---
Well this shows up in a Google result, so could you maybe link them in a comment so people trying to find a solution can actually see the solution? And yes, I know this is 3 months old by now.
---
RIP. I missed out on a lot of score
---
Please elaborate?
---
Bloodied doesnt need a nerf. Other builds could just use a buff. Bloodied has its trade offs. Insane damage for low health. Level 174 and I ran riding shotgun with a friend fuckig around with abloodied laser rifle last night and died about 6 times. Pvp in adventure mode you can use vats unless the person is invisible. That's what really needs fixed, just disable vats against players.
---
Ahhhh okay thank you!!
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/ACw28DY](https://imgur.com/gallery/ACw28DY)
---
It really is.....
---
Oh, don't worry, they'll extend the extra dailies by a weekend, problem solved!
---
(smh, they need to fucking fix this already and provide compensation to the players affected by it)
---
Oh yeah, I like to display my "collectables". Masks, taxidermy heads, bobbleheads. I made my camp kinda like an open showroom and think it looks pretty nice.
---
Yeah, I have that happen when people build right at the edge of certain high cliffs.  It seems to be more common when the cliffs are composed of multiple overlapping rock objects.  You can spawn in lodged inside one rock while still bounded by another.  Of course, if there isn't another rock underground, you just fall.  Fall damage reduction helps there, though.
---
I've seen a couple of very interesting underground glitch camps built to capitalize on that effect at Devil's Ridge and Seneca Rocks.  Since you can't see or interact with the rock you're inside, you end up with a meandering series of caverns and one-way tunnels (when you walk out of a rock, you can't go back).  If you're patient, you can glitch under the surface to a stable spot, then rebuild your CAMP at that new spot.  Then incoming players will spawn in underground.  At least that used to be the case.  Don't know if that's still viable.
---
The fun bugs get patched out almost immediately.
---
I know it’s not a fix, but 3rd person gives you crosshairs.
---
Either buff them appropriately or just remove them from the game.
---
Idk, I still like some grenades for certain mobs. Plasma are good against Mister Gutsy's. I use Nuka Grenades too. Like a portable mini nuke.
---
This has always been a factor with Bethesda games so I doubt it will change. I honestly preferred the world before it had human npc because of how much there implementation breaks logic. Like why do I keep finding some dude chopping wood next to fissure prime? Is that the best place to do that? That and all the first world problems they have. Sick of eating tatos? I'm sick of eating roaches and people. And don't get me started on thorn bushes...
---
Happy cake day!
---
That's what I've started doing, but the matches always seem to take forever and don't give much XP. Hopefully we'll get another double/triple XP weekend soon so I can keep trying to get that sweet Hellfire armor
---
No it always looks awkward with the log cabin or contemporary set. 
---
It either ends up looking like the Dunkin Donuts in Southold, NY or like the Starbucks on the westside in Bend, OR.
---
You need the plan if you want a legendary bear arm, fixer and sheepsquatch staff to show up in the loot pool. And you need the plans for the SS armor and new gauss weapons if you want to see them in the loot pool. Also need the bow and compound bow learned if you want to see them in the loot pool.
---
ah thank you. I was wondering why I couldnt find them anywhere
---
It’s not really something a new player should concern themselves with yet because requirements for this upcoming legendary perk system involves having lots of unused Perk Cards and being high level and I do mean very high level at the moment at least but if you curious here’s a quick rundown of the Legendary perks are coming in September.
---
Legendary Perks System Refresher
---
If you weren’t familiar with Legendary Perks from the last PTS, or just want a refresher, here are some details on how this system works:
---
Legendary Perks are new high-level Perk Cards you can access via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Menu, and you can equip them to add even more power to your character builds.
---
You will be able to unlock your first Legendary Perk slot at level 50, and new ones at certain level milestones after that: 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. 
---
Your characters who are already high-level will immediately have access to one Legendary Perk Slot for each of the above leveling milestones they've reached. 
---
For example, a level 250 character will have access to 5 Legendary Perk slots, with the ability to open a sixth slot at level 300. 
---
Each Legendary Perk has 4 Ranks, and you can use new “Perk Coins” to rank them up. 
---
Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards. 
---
Legendary Perk slots are account-wide.
---
Here's the list of the Legendary Perks so far (subject to change): 
---
-  **Ammo Factory** - produce 50%/75%/100%/150% more rounds when crafting ammo. Yes it does stack with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
   - **Funky Duds** - +50/+100/+150/+200 poison resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---
   - **Blood Sacrifice** - When you die, teammates gain +25/+30/+35/+40 DR and heal 40/50/60/70 HP over 8/10/12/14 seconds
---
   - **Brawling Chemist** - generate 1/1/1/2 combat enhancing chem every 60/50/40/40 minutes. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5.
---
   - **Hack and Slash** - 20%/30%/40%/50% chance for melee VATS to do area damage
---
   - **Collateral Damage** - enemies killed with melee have 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Detonation Contagion** - enemies killed by thrown explosives have 20%/30%/40%/50% chance to explode
---
   - **Electric Absorption** - 10%/13%/16%/20% chance energy attacks recharge your power armor's fusion core.
---
   - **Exploding Palm** - While unarmed, 5%/10%/15%/20% chance of triggering an explosion on attack hits.
---
   - **Far Flung Fireworks** - Enemies killed with a ranged weapon have a 10%/13%/16%/20% chance to explode
---
   - **Sizzling Style** - +50/+100/+150/+200 fire damage resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---
   - **Follow Through** - Ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10%/20%/30%/40% for 10 seconds
---
   - **Legendary Ability** - +1/+2/+3/+5 to stat and +1/+2/+3/+5 to available perk slots (one for each SPECIAL but cannot go over the 15 point cap)
---
   - **Master Infiltrator** - auto unlock skill 0/1/2/3 terminals and locks. +3 Lockpick and Hacking skills.
---
   - **Nuclear Proliferator** - generate 1/1/1/2 lightweight mininuke every 60/50/40/40 minutes. Up to a max of 3/4/5/5.
---
   - **Power Armour Reboot** - 15%/20%/30%/40% chance to auto revive with full health if you're downed in PA.
---
   - **Power Sprinter** - while in PA, sprinting consumes 20%/30%/40%/50% fewer AP.
---
   - **Retribution** - blocking a melee attack restores 1/2/3/4 HP and 1/2/3/4 AP for 15 seconds.
---
   - **Survival Shortcut** - generate 1/1/1/2 survival aiding chem every 30/25/20/20 minutes. Max 5/6/7/10.
---
   - **Taking One For The Team** - enemies take 10%/20%/30%/40% more damage when they attack you, if you're on a team.
---
   - **What Rads?** - +50/+75/+100/+300 rad resist, restore 1/2/3/6 rads per second.
---
yeah, queen triples are the way to go. Our crew (the Regiciders) run these all the time on PS4. Current record stands at 20 SBQ queen kills in a day for us. Usually 3-6 weeknights and 12-15 weekends.
---
did anyone else have less dailies today?
---
Similar thing happened to me  after a SBQ fight this was like the third one in a row went to loot her and nothing but emptiness. Hopped back to my camp bout 5min later another nuke inbound, did not get to that fight before she was melted, couple level 500 ran a train on her. But was just looking around the area where the last SBQ i killed  and noticed a random legendary on the ground, grabbed that sucker and thought this must be my lucky day, flipped the pipboy light on and looked around a bit, i pickup about 20 plans another 4 legendary weapons and shit ton of junk weird thing was all of it was spread out in almost a circle, heavily overencumbered i slowly start making my way back to watoga as i get to the train building just before the red bridge a SBQ body falls from the sky (that has been happening a lot after killing SB's) and she  is fully loaded with loot, day just got even better!
---
The effect that plays after you drink Mountain Honey. It sounds like a magic forest and it’s adorable!!
---
its completly RNG out of the weapons you know the plans. thats why the fixer and bear arm plans are asked so much.
---
You need plans for weapons like the fixer, sheepsquatch club, bear arm and the new gold bullion weapons. 
---
Mama mumbles can always give you all of the vanilla weapons though
---
Ionized is to eat and sell, I sell it. Glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids are used to make stable flux. One of each listed and 10 nuked flora makes one stable flux. And no you cannot make hardened mass. You find them on bodies in nuke zones.
---
The sounds you make while eating 8 moldy hot dogs under 2 minutes...
---
We can't resign the Presidency to Eden yet. He hasn't fully formed his consciousness yet, and he only acquires that title after Richardson dies in 2241 as he's part of his cabinet, and so part of the presidential line of succession.
---
Not saying that we can't see him at all, he'll just be "ZAX" though.
---
I hope your keeping a talley of what youve lost
---
Came here just to say this.
---
I have spent way too much time searching for these. And I only find them about two-thirds of the time.
---
Mans already hard 24/7 im sure the rads in the sh*t you eat has the same effect as viagra man
---
You need the plans for weapons that came after the initial release. Such as The Fixer, Tenderizer, sheepsquatch weapons, Bows, Gauss weapons (excluding the rifle) and I think a few more.
---
Don't have FO1st, so can't play on Private. After today though, I'm considering it.
---
the extra dailies have already been announced as remaining for the full event. 
---
not that having them auto-completed helps much, but still.
---
Whenever my character ‘grunts’ out of nowhere.
---
Chinese stealth suit. I was doing it in mixture xo1 / t65 and every wing I had to take 3 rad aways and 2 stim packs. With Chinese stealth suit, you can take that down to half rads / health after 2 wings.
---
Also, there’s 10 in each wing. Count as you go. 10x4=40, max rewards come at 100. You’ll need more runners.
---
26,000 points and counting on my end.
---
At least you know he's a creep though. I have my suspicions that the Grafton Mayor is actually the worse of the two, despite the facade.
---
I'm already out around 12k because of this bug
---
Slightly dreading seeing if it went through today
---
That’s how Bethesda griefs you
---
I like the sound possums used to make when they waddled around-- kind of this snuffly-squelshy-squeaky noise, but I don't think they make it any more. I also love the sound of the uranium processors during Uranium Fever (it's a helluva beat, ya know). And I'm a weirdo for this one, but I like the bass-riff bug that happens in adventure mode after playing NW (dum-dum-do-dum-dum) during popup notifications.
---
???? The hell you talking about use the Mark 2 turrets spacing and placement is important, if you use contractor and you are the first to take a workshop on that server you can get anywhere from 10-16 turrets with the free mats max turrets out at 20/20 and that with smart placement you will be rolling in caps as a pissed off bloodied build just keeps getting wrecked.   
---
Note once you see them die repair quickly or they will chip away oh they will die a shit ton and you will get the caps but eventually you lose.   
---
I have lost the ammo shop twice to bloodied players. One time it was a duo and another after gaining 5000 caps from a trio. I was cool with losing that one though.   
---
Also now I have no problems with repeaters. I just pull out the legacy explosive flamer or gat wave it with that huge spray of and range around insta kill them. They leave but send hate mail always calling me a hacker.
---
* The VATS lock-on sound.
---
* The sound when you highlight a space on the Legendary Run board.
---
* The sound of a Gauss Minigun.
---
* The sound when you bonk someone over the head with a Shovel.
---
MIRV grenades work wonders on robots too.
---
You have tough sledding here pal.  Any time pvp is mentioned you can expect a cascade of down votes.  It's just a fact that the vast majority of players' pvp experience was being bullied and destroyed by someone with a good pvp set up or screwed over by someone with a trap base. You just aren't going to get much traction on this subreddit for pvp and likely for good reason.
---
With that being said, one thing I think could be good would be a pvp public team. This would help identify other pvp'ers and maybe get some decent battles going  against **Willing Participants!** I think having the whole team flagged for pvp would be a good thing if you initiate combat with another pvp group. The pvp public team is really what you should be pushing for.
---
Just my 2 caps.
---
In my opinion, the only ‘viable’ laser weapons are the explosive ones. Meaning Legacy. Plasma rifles are okay, especially with the Quad effect. Flamers are fun, especially with the explosive effect.
---
So just plans that are for “new” weapons, I appreciate your help!! :)
---
Maybe bring back survival? Maybe rework survival so its similar to rust, like a rust lite that requires a separate character amd monthly server wipes.
---
No worries :)
---
I was staring at the small details of her outfit trying to figure out whether it was my mod or not... But then I realized there's only one retexture mod on nexus for that outfit, the one I made :D
---
Exactly! And no problems.
---
Well I’ve been getting a ton of just pipe weapons so I wasn’t sure lmao! Thank you for the help!!
---
The cicadas are what make me trip out
---
The devs exploiting this should be banned.
---
Stop playing so much
---
85?  Wow.  I just hit 48 or 49 I think, and that felt like it took some effort.  Once the challenges are done, the repeatable 10K XP for a lousy 100 score doesn't even seem worthwhile when you need 2K to get the next reward.  I even (reluctantly) do some of the easy nuclear winter challenges, though I really don't enjoy it.
---
You want to get on and do the revive in water thing
---
Basically, yeah.  It's a pathing issue.  If shes on the ground she can target you on the fence and do damage, but while flying it screws with the path to target and results in her doing her flyover attack or landing and immediately taking off again
---
Hey, thanks for the help!
---
Have you been giving queen mirelurk meat to Blackeye at Ohio River Adventures, too?
---
Same here, I wondered if it was server lag.
---
Is this the Xbox equivalent of what Sony did a few weeks back with the PS5 reveal?  I thought Microsoft had already done one.
---
Jet packs can save your life
---
conversely if that shotgun has Limb Damage as a major modifier, it seems to hit every pellet for full damage
---
Low health doesnt matter when you litterally die in a single second  theres no drawback to it as far as i can see guy was using a tesla rifle and i had well over 500 energy res *groumded and scaly skin* vats isnt the problem its rather its how pvp works and how you can only stealth attack a player when they arent fightinf you,  now when i see a bloodied in hunter hunted i usually one shot them because i see them far before they see me,  also pvp seems to be very derpy in the fact sometimes you will do no damage at all *i have damage numbers turned on* to the opposing player you could be like me and have a very good exe lmg but if you hold it down you do no damage tested this with a friend the other day full auto was death but small bursts are fine for no reason and lets be honest most gunfights nowadays are just point and shoot to 1 shot the guy
---
Hell if you want my opinion?  Ive fought junkie  builds and others before i actually had fucking fun fighting them
---
The vats problem is the fact people are able to somehow just eat a fuck ton of ap regening food and just use vats forever
---
O_O
---
I always thought they didn’t like the song.
---
Some of you even built a whole bunch of spike traps there.  😉
---
Yeah but as a low level it’s hard to get overseers tickets without being able to get a lot of perk card packs, hence the point of the post
---
Nah. Turrets are OP against players. Especially when the workshop owner builds like 20 of them, they can often be more deadly than the actual player I’m taking the workshop from.
---
Also bloodied builds in PvP are mediocre at best. There is a damage cap against players of 110, and being full health with assassin/sentinel is far better than being low with unyielding/sentinel, even if you factor in serendipity. 
---
TL;DR: git gud

I'm with you. Fallout 76 has this stagnant 'End-Game' void, and sure, Survival Mode wasn't for everybody, but it was at least an option for those who wanted a challenging map to traverse or for those who wanted non-Battleroyal way to PVP.
---
I've submitted feedback tickets to Bethesda regarding Survival Mode. I'd encourage you to do the same. Hopefully they'll bring it back.

It’s not magic it’s legacy
---
the explosive prefix allows energy weapons to pack more punch, as for instigating it may be classified as one of the magic prefixes. i know the LMG has a fast enough fire rate to trigger it
---
I’ve just returned after experiencing the disaster that was launch. What’s a trap camp?
---
This is in a “flat” area but I may have built to close to the edge. 
---
But, hey, that’s the kind of guy I am. I’m no “play it safe, build in the middle” wastelander.
---
Not everyone has a bunch of legacy items the only legacy item i have is salt of the earth * a old survival mode shotgun* and i know alot about turrent placement but it doesnt matter they oneshot them all
---
You should be able to share one perk card of a two star value. Unless something funky is happing in your stats like an addiction to alcohol (not sure if the addiction still does that).
---
*makes general gestures at Coronavirus laden America - the hell else am I gunna do!?
---
No, you’re right. I think I may try replaying some other games I have. I technically have never beaten FO4... or Skyrim..
---
Any other series suggestions to get rid of wasteland fatigue!?
---
Yeah “places” isn’t the word I would use.
---
Bethesda promised a lot of things but all these promises are always worded in such a way that no one could claim false advertisement. See Fallout 1st. Same story.
---
Does it suck? Of course, but it's up to do the player base to roast them for it so they actually follow through. Sadly, most people bitch once and move on.
---
Golden!  I will definitely have to remember to revisit the spots if this happens again.  The scorchbeasts dropping from the sky is something else though isn't it?  I had it happen halfway across the map and INSIDE a building!  It was one of the workshops on the north end of the map and PLOP.....scorchbeast drops through the roof and flops around on the warehouse floor.  Bizarre.
---
Thanks, I’ll see if they’ll let me refund the log cabin bundle and the slocum vendor and give me the slocum set instead
---
Yeah I’m available right now. PM me your PSN
---
Edit: Nvm adding you now.
---
When I first started playing NW a couple of weeks ago, I had like 80 unopened packs. And frog legs is only 8 tickets. What platform are you on?
---
I’m on PS4 and I still have challenges to earn perk card packs even at lvl 74.
---
I understand you, but my experience is different. I got the Blackbird paint during early betas, when it was up for about a week. Nobody had that paint, occasionally people would be very surprised if I showed up wearing it. Bethesda brought it back and now it doesn't get a second look. That's why I expect to see all the stuff in Space Jam: the board game show up in the atom shop over the next year.
---
I wish we could break down that useless ammo into scrap. I mean, in real life, we'd be powerful af with missile launchers and the ability to launch mini nukes. But Bethesda dumbed it down and made them useless.
---
They might not in certain instances be able to fit as much as a circle can cause the diagonals on squares are longer than its sides.

---
one thing that jumps out at me right away is.. IMO Maxed Blocker is a must have for any build.. ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Git gud at what shooting cus i land all my shots without vats my build is damn good, but the fact that my build is rendered useless by the fact that i cant use my best advantage as a sniper build *sneak attacks* is bs its times like these i wish survival mode was brought back i used to rekt bloodied users on a daily basis because they could never reach me intime to get in range if whatever gun they were using
---
when the legendary run ends you can no longer progress that season, i am unsure if atom challenges will return while waiting for season 2 though
---
Oh my god, [I did not notice that.](https://imgur.com/a/5EpSWxE).
---
Those work great as long as you are trying to fill the area with liquid....this is an example of when education blinds common sense....a reoccuring Bethseda thingy.
---
As someone who's (mostly mildly) colorblind, an option to highlight corpses would greatly increase my enjoyment of the game. I can't count how many times I've missed out on looting legendaries because they died in a bunch of grass and I can't find them.
---
Found Todd
---
Pretty presumptive of you to think they'll actually function properly at all.
---
Edit: that's a joke about the dailies resetting.
---
I’d say definitely beat fo4 or Skyrim. Personally I have been playing dark souls 3 once my dailies are done as I like the series even if it can be punishing
---
Thank God I'm not the only one
---
I felt this way too up until now since they added 2 extra dailies every day. Sure it may not seem as much, but they can catch me up on any that I miss so that I’m still on par with peoples original progress trackers by the end. It’s just taking awhile lol
---
You let me know when its finished and ill surely will! ;)
---
Ah yes good to know that i wont be 1 shot but 3 shot
---
How long will the double daily score last for?
---
I don’t think anybody knows
---
That sucks. What time zone?
---
It's crazy how many things work better in Skyrim than in FO76. I get that they are different games but the engine could be used so much better than how they are using it.
---
I would much rather have that problem with my explosive shotty, despite it also not making much sense logically. A few pellets should miss unless that reticle is entirely contained by the body/part, but goddammit, how does EVERY pellet miss over the shoulder, EXCEPT one, when you're aiming at center mass??
---
Ganepedia seem to have updated their answer...
---
Timothy is bragging about all the health benefits he gets from being a regular swimmer. At what point in his tiresome prattle do you smugly stop and correct him?~~The long-winded conclusion declaring the prevention of bacterial infections~~ His declaration about the water giving him baby soft skin
---
You should creep your special stats when someone is using it and your fairly mutated. It makes a pretty good difference. I love the +8 int from egg head, which is about a 16% increase in exp, and a 4% increase over w/o strange in numbers.
---
And the hang time is a little weird to get used too, but being able to launch over buildings and fairly large gaps is fun, with or w/o a jetpack. Realy once you get used to SiN, its like marsupial that its pretty tough to go back to not using.
---
Todd should get banned for duping completed challenges😂
---
Isn't it great having a mini nuke shat into your inventory making it so you can't run just as a huge wave of scorched from the SBQ all attack you, so you end up downed and losing the stable flux you just got because wtf is with this damn game?
---
Well, I'm up to 7 - 10 pages per day right now, though I don't think I can keep up with that rate for too long (work and family), but once I get through Wastelanders, I'm going back to Volume 1 for edits. Maybe even see about getting it published as an eBook.
---
Playing on PC here, and what happened to me a lot this weekend was Supermutants standing about (mainly Harpers Ferry and Berkley Springs) completely oblivious to me shooting them, taking some damage and then auto-replenishing, but remaining still all the same.
---
I mean, maybe everyone knows about this but I hadn´t played the game since April and came back this past weekend and felt that the game in general felt a lot buggier and shakier than 3 months ago, I chalked it down to being double XP weekend and the servers being under strain, but maybe things are worse than that :/
---
It wouldnt honestly bethesda needs to either see how broken it is and take the right approach to nerfing it yet still keeping bloodied users happy or just remove its effects from pvp outright i can gurantee you most bloodied builds can not face me in a survival mode styled pvp match
---
NAR 98 north of Whitesprings
---
Look at all the bloodied users downvoting us
---
This would make it better for creating towns with other players as well
---
RobCo and Watoga.
---
thanks
---
I actually posted a thank you for a triple nuke on Xbox last night. Would have been 3AM eastern, 2 central, 12 pacific.
---
this sounds awful but I sort of enjoy the grind, it's something predictable to look forward to in the evening
---
I know it's Legacy but I'm wondering if i'm procing the the "magic" glitch
---
Yeah they made it so bad it can't even kill a rad roach.
---
So far it is just this, that I truly know of.
---
"burnout" is accurate. i'm not massively interested in the later rank unlocks, but i did want the tree. all score has really highlighted for me is there doesn't seem to be enough content ingame to take the weight of smashing out as much score as possible.
---
there's maybe what, 2 or 3(?) events that offer enough activity to gain significant levels. radiation rumble and riding shotgun have gone from occasional cool things to do, to "oh god not this again".
---
at this point, i'm basically done. if i pick up anymore ranks then great, but i can't see many people genuinely wading from 1 to 100 and not feeling like they never want to play again.
---
and then we'll be expected to do the same events with perhaps a few new additions thrown in for season 2? haha oh god, no. not a chance.
---
Ah okay. Well my advice would be to practice aiming and dodging in adventure. Use ghouls (since they like to charge in groups) and super mutants. No Vats of course. And if your bf and you play together, maybe try a sneaky approach and try to land in the top 5 teams. You could also rando drop just the two of you and revive them over and over.

From my experience an explosive gp will not proc the magic

Because it doesn't play or show active for players that spawn in for a good minute or two most of the time.
---
When you complete the season there won't be any rewards from any of the challenges before season 2 begins. No atoms, nothing. Season 2 will begin sometime in september according to community calendar.
---
At the time of this reply all jetpacks require flux. Just run queen's when you see them if you don't want to grind since completing scorched earth rewards flux each time.
---
Whitespring
---
Sugar grove
---
The possums still make that sound!! I was going to mention that too but figured no one probably even noticed! Haha!
---
Nope. The challenges don't reward anything after you finish season. No atoms. There have been posts/comments about this made by people who finished the season already.
---
Right, I'll check to see if I'm firing fast enough to trigger.
---
Do you know if the Gat plas can shoot fast enough?
---
If I understood angryturtle correctly yes. It should get the fire rate over 200 because the explosion is effectively treated as another bullet. It also benefits from being energy as explosive energy weapons did not get the NERF to the explosive component.  However, it is not "Magic" in regards to the queen (and only the queen) as she is effectively immune to explosive effects. 
---
Pretty sure all of that makes sense but I am in the middle of my allergy season and I'm riding the benadryl wave.
---
When the fans consider u as the front man for the big well known  band u play with.......u r the front man.
---
Well theres 6 to 7 weeks left in the season and yea if I can grind it in just over a week there no excuse people cant dont it in 6x that amount of time. And no it's easy cuz I've never had a single day where I spent more than 30 mins to finish every daily and every weekly is finished in 2 hrs if that after I log in on Tuesday.
---
Edit: and not to mention I have skipped every NW challenge since day one
---
You do not need to take off starched genes before taking a serum. I am fairly new to  FO76, so I don't know if this was an old behavior that got patched, or if this is a misunderstanding that has passed down over time. The text on Starched Genes currently says you will never mutate from **rads**. Says nothing about serums. 
---
I only recently (last month or so?) started messing with mutations. I loaded up Starched Genes and Class Freak - I am not sure if I put them on it before or after my first mutation. However, since then I have never taken Starched off, and I've added at least 5 more mutations. All of the mutations have "stuck".
---
Also if these turrents could be those insane mk 7 turrents that rip you to shred if your not careful i wkuld agree
---
Blocker is more important than extra dr.
---
I just got frog legs last week because I had to respect in adventure. So I did a lot of sneaking on low ground while my teammates went high. Pain in the ass sure, but if you can learn how to DODGE w/o frog legs, you’ll be better with it.
---
You’ve practically described it! I’ve got the “Mystery Hack” spelt out with neon and sign letters, with the S fallen on top of the roof. I’ve also been known to run around in a fez, big glasses and bath robe...
---
The event would be a little better if it could activate with designated ore collectors...90% of the time in this event, no one collects ore...
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
Yup happens all the time  😐
---
Second - % off of damage is much better than a higher DR.
---
Regardless of level everyone level 50+ is still level 50. Weapons, armor, stats all cap at level 45 or 50. Idk if that helps but it should give peace of mind for that level gap.
---
Hey! I got the [Nuka-Girl rocketsuit Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/269) mod as my SO did not like the helmet neckpiece and the rockets on the back which edits the mesh accordingly, and then slapped on the incredible [Nuka-Girl Spacesuit Revamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/577) mod, choosing the Nuka Dark option.
---
Look, afaik there are currently 5 ways into PvP:
---
Workshops - readily available, shows a warning, fun if consensual/revenge.  
---
Griefing someone - very rare and very childish, one sided unfun  
---
Hunter/Hunted - literally no one plays it  
---
Watoga High School event - rarely played  
---
NW - infested with cheaters on PC, janky shit  
---
Looks like lotta options... But it ain't. Bethesda doesn't seem to care about things that can't be monetized.
---
For a bloodied PA user this can be a great set up.  Emergency Protocols and Life Giver 4. Just  be careful using a Radaway at 2% health as it will usually kill you...do a stimpak or eat first.  
---
I also like the Scaly Skin mutation for easy damage resistance.
---
I used to happily collect ore for this event (my group likes to wait to drop until the very end so we can farm ghouls for tickets and xp)
---
However- now that SCORE is out, I don't want to miss out on any xp I could gain. So now I'd rather fail the event and gain a ton of xp, instead of getting a 1 star nocturnal rolling pin for putting in 100 ore.
---
Bethesda could fix it so that ore collectors gain \*some\* xp from depositing ore, not crazy abusable amounts, but something, then I'd happily go back to collecting.
---
100% blocker
---
RobCo Research Facility - they added a Sentry Bot to the lower Parking Lot
---
Yeah, that's why I said I feel like it was a fluke of the night and not a common occurrence. I don't think that you get a notification in the laughable notification area either, it's not even worth looking at half the time.
---
I don't use stealth normally, it's just not a part of my build since I'm a VATS SG user. The most I crouch is to check if I'm engaged or not.
---
That's awesome! It's cool seeing the little details people do to their camps. Shows you the positive side of the fanbase
---
thanks! the first part i understand, the second i didnt know you could do. do you have to be the team leader to take your group to another group?
---
I run blocker max rank just for sbq. I use scatter shot when I'm not since I use shoot guns. Most of the guides I've seen recommend blocker max.
---
Don't think it was me it would have been 1am my time I wasn't playing then lol but hey least you got scorched Earth back to back!
---
Nothing major the legendary perks come in fall I think
---
I concur with the other two, after much testing and playing around, Blocker increases survivability a heck of a lot more then Barbarian.
---
I don't see such big health jumps, but often when I take something that should be a kill shot I see the health jump from back up to 2-3%, something that didn't happen till a recent patch.
---
Very frustrating.
---
Something that has been consistent possibly since release though is the first melee hit often doing all indication that it hit, but doing no damage. Maybe a year in and this also extended to ranged (non vats) shots, and now this. So from my experience it's been getting progressively worse.
---
Wow! That is a beautiful camp.  And the video quality is amazing.  Are you on a “super-charged PC” or something?  This makes the quality of PS4 look like an Atari 2600.

---
I just got a QE Railway from a ghoul last night and that thing is absolutely broken in VATS. If I aim for the body of a ghoul it was a one shot but if I aimed for the head the shot would either miss or their HP would rubberband back to full. VATS is also broken in PvP where hits literally do 0 damage. It’s frustrating that’s it’s been broken for so long and it will probably be even longer until they fix it since they released a statement saying they have no clue what caused it since Wastelanders is technically a whole new build of the game so they can’t just reverse the process.
---
Hey! See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hwig8e/this_game_is_beautiful/fyzv7eg?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
I like putting out my Mysterious Stranger. Folks usually write him off, but he can be a nice distraction to enemies. He helped take some of the heat off me while clearing Whitesprings solo. Besides, I like the idea of people being surprised by this rando showing up--like a piece of me is fighting along side them, even if they're across the map.

---
Japan most likely censors the franchise more heavily than China, since they change the name of the Fat Man in every game and disabled Burke in Fallout 3, making the Power of the Atom quest unavailable.
---
Damage just isn’t tracking with VATS and it’s quite annoying.
---
It's always a good idea to have a backup style of combat. I use both heavy weapons and 2-handed melee, as the perks are both in Strength. Dunno if you can do that.
---
Hey I can’t chat in Party. It’s like 4 am here and I can’t be too loud. We can chat here or pm though.

^  This.  This is a great idea 👍
---
Always looking for a triple. I’m glad to hear it was happening on multiple servers, multiple times last night.
---
ok go to deathclaw island
---
VATS has just been closing out after 2 or 3 shots when I'm in an event. Will VATS a target, pull the trigger, and will get off maybe 2 or 3 bullets and then close out. The enemy is still alive but VATS closes like it was killed
---
Yep. VATs broke when Wastelanders dropped. So all the VATs builds got fucked over.
---
Ps4 here same thing happened with a 3 star one.
---
I try to launch 2x/night every weekend. Time to move into THU evenings as well!
---
https://youtu.be/h39-GD83SkY this is a link to the build I run.. I use 4/5 demo expert and keep that special point in charisma just so I can travel cheap with the perk.. your call bro hope it helps
---
I'm not sure why this is being reported as something new? VATS failing at even point-blank w/ 95% over and over has been a thing since I started playing (right around Wastelanders release). Even critical shots, which I believe are supposed to be 100% hit chance, will miss sometimes.
---
However, I have not noticed a major difference since the last patch. I've just gotten used to "quick VATSing" (i.e. Q, left-click, Q) as fast as possible. If I miss the first shot, the next one usually hits with sniper-rifle/non-automatic guns. With automatics, I will usually "burst-fire" them, clicking and holding for only a few shots to make sure I'm actually doing damage before unloading a whole clip (assuming I'm shooting something that isn't a 1-2 shot kill like SBQ/Sheepsquach/etc.)
---
The HP jumping back up has also existed since I started playing and is IMO way more frustrating than the VATS misses. With an instigating sniper rifle I do 1000-2000 damage depending on my perks and load-out, which is enough to kill most of the heavily farmed mobs in the game (high-level Super Mutants, Scorched, and Ghouls), yet far too often it takes 2-3 shots to kill them just because, even though the damage registers and pops up the damage number, the first 1 or 2 shots will miss.
---
It doesn't make the game "unplayable" or VATS "completely useless", but it definitely makes playing a VATS build more frustrating. It also makes you consume more ammo than a non-VATS build in a lot of cases, which makes no sense. For me, now, it isn't a big deal since I have the resources to produce ammo en masse. But for a lower level player or player who doesn't have the time to farm like I do, I'm sure it's a major deterrent to VATS and/or playing in general.
---
Bethesda, please attack these lingering issues with the zeal you've shown lately with the response to the exploits and ATOM issues. Fixing these types of issues would be HUGE quality of life improvements for literally everyone who plays the game.
---
It IS a cosmetic item. Keep an eye out in the atomic shop, it'll be back eventually. 
---
Or, rank up the Legendary Run. One of the rewards is a helmetless version painted white with a red hand on it.
---
Was there at least a good selection after all that work?
---
When i was starting i countered a Sheepsquatch from one of the random encounter spots just to shit my pants the second after
---
I've been scared on more than one occasion by feral ghouls. You're lulled into a false sense of security after clearing a room and just as you're about to start looting, one of them comes out running out of nowhere at mach 5 and tackles you. Complain all you want about the changes Bethesda made to enemies between NV and 4, but this was definitely one of the better ones
---
knock yourself
---
Did you break your game with mods?
---
Nah each has to join on their own, even if your the team leader it wont bring the other party members with you. Kinda silly, but maybe for griefing purposes idk?
---
If you look at the public team menu, you will be able to see your bonds with other players if they left your public group, but not the server.
---
Final word is a good starting point for .50 cal legendaries. That fire rate really makes a difference. And the armor pen. In power armor, using max stabilized in intelligence, i almost ignore 100% of armor. It's a VERY nice .50, and overall very easy to get.
---
He does kill most of the Whitesprings Bunker himself, so yeah, he's not a good dude/AI.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Early in the game, I was in Flatwoods and heard someone screaming. This was before Wastelanders so I knew it wasn’t an NPC. Scared the crap out of me. I ran out of that area as fast as my non-Marathoner level 6 could run. Avoided the area for a long time until I found out the source of the screaming from a friend!
---
Your best bet for an energy pistol is the gauss pistol
---
&gt; It appears often (to me) that when i finally hit the enemy through VATS, that my shots clearly HIT (you can see AND hear it) but the enemy does not loose a single HP.
---
This is god damned infuriating. I was playing yesterday and came across a normal level 50 scorch beast. Unload a full clip of head shots from my BFFR handmade while in sneak mode, saw the hit numbers registering for almost all of them (at 800+ per hit) and yet the thing only lost 1/4 of its health. It should have only taken 5-6 shots to kill the thing, but instead I wasted 50+ bullets.
---
I have a smidge of rep on my second toon to become ally with foundation and man WS I looking forward to that Gauss shotgun.  Now, not so much.  Vats shitting the bed ruins both the plasma caster and the Gauss shotty.  It’s ridiculous.  Oh, but my TSE lever, fucking nails in Vats go figure!!!!???  I have a lump of shit tse pump I need to pull out of the stash......most inaccurate gun in the game.....I bet Vats works like a champ on it.
---
It keeps killing me completely
---
Workshops=PvP
---
Someone contesting your workshop/=/griefing.
---
I think it’s more that people want a uniform grid that’s a bit more predictable.
---
Bizarre that they can’t fix this. Or any of the bugged challenges, really. How many times must I go to Abandoned Bogtown before the game recognizes I’ve been there? How much sludge lung must I suffer?
---
Its firing speed is only half of Gat laser iirc. However it has a built-in splitter or something so it fires a bunch of projectiles at once not just one, so I assume it’s possible? I’ll test it myself when I get a chance.
---
Take my up vote as this is something I strongly agree with and would likely make it easier to tell how far camps can be between friends camp placement.
---
Yeah pretty much.  Sometimes it looks like it did the right amount of damage, other times it doesnt.  Honestly i just cripple them with my shotgun then melee them to death while they roll around on the ground now lol.
---
Still waiting on the datamined Enclave pa.
---
The only time I have ever used one is for the Possum badge and I crafted the mini nuke I needed myself.
---
5 you say? did your message get cut off?
---
Either way, if PVP wasn't a janky mess I'd consider doing it more often to git gud. Doesn't look like they're planning on fixing it though.
---
EDIT:
---
There's the message proper. I was always interested in the "Hunter/Hunted" mode, but yeah it seems dead. Also, I always play the Watoga event "Monster Mash", no one ever engages in PVP in it though, which is odd.
---
As for last night, I bet it was some dude who just wanted to capture every node on the map and I was in his path. Rather annoying considering the lackadaisical nature of the Workshop mechanic.
---
Why would a sneak sniper care about avoiding melee damage?  Seems like three wasted points to me.  The whole idea with sneak is to avoid being hit in the first place.  Blocker is often used by the loud-and-proud crowd.  
---
To each their own of course.  Just curious why you would consider it a must have.
---
Yeah, I think I would want to push for sneak, but I think I read it only stacks up to like 90 or 100%, so at that point, why not Dense?
---
Enclave vs BoS was literally a big part of just Fallout 3. No other game has it.
---
In 2 it's a really minor part of a secondary quest, plus some implications that Horrigan exterminated one or two outposts IIRC, but for the most part the Brotherhood is largely unaware of the existence of the Enclave.
---
Yea, probably. That latency/rubberbanding thing also is pretty weird when enemy health is replenished. I see that often when soloing high health enemies (scorchbeasts, behemoths) that when you do a lot of dmg in rapid succesion that the health bounces back ...  :/
---
Feral ghouls combined with even the slightest lag.
---
One second, they're far away. The next second, the image loads directly in your face.
---
Just straight up remove them from the lootpool or replace them with ammo points instead.
---
So you either get 'normal' ammo at the end of an event or ammo points if the game was about to give you missiles
---
The pickup sound from the teddy bear and other toys, and the firing sound of the Plasma Caster... for some reason
---
"Workshops are PvE in nature."
---
And here, ladies and gents, we see the foodbuild doing foodbuild things.
---
I think so
---
Same here. Just on the double score day :(
---
I don't even feel like playing today after this. Completely took the joy out of it.
---
I can hook you up with hardened / suppressor on ps4 if you want, either later today or whenever works for you.
---
I might have more grenades hang on
---
you can have a smaller cube that fits inside the sphere, how's that?
---
Sounds like Stockholm syndrome
---
Nice. Mind sending me that link so I can check it out? :)
---
I'm glad this went over so f*king well... I'm out!
---
Yeah I’ve been doing pretty much all the things you’re suggestion, I will practise with ghouls though, I’ve been landing in the top ten quite often I’m just garbage at combat because they all just jump around everywhere and pummel me on the ground
---
What? that's some Slang I've never encountered. Explain please.
---
SO WHAT?
---
To piggyback on this question, if I've done Mayor For The Day and start shooting at a robot in Watoga, do I agro just that robot or every robot in the city?
---
6/10, no feet
---
no really, they don't seem to have feet
---
I. . . I don't know what you're trying to say.
---
There's a note from some intelligence officer who says he believes the whole thing is a simulation, they're living in it, and he has proof. Presumably no proof was presented before his participation was.. no longer needed.
---
We may need to get an enemy to down me in the water.
---
It looks really great!
---
They may just be hella tanky. I'm a junkie commando/quantum spammer build using a FFR junkie's handmade. I get accused of hacking on a regular basis when no, I'm just in fact tanky and hella annoying. ;)
---
SBQ and whitesprings yo.. just to mention a couple of scenarios..
---
also nobody is going to kill 100% of the mobs 100% of the time
---
if youre confident youll absolutely never get melee'd by any mobs ever.. dont run it
---
I think its well worth it.. YMMV
---
Holy stop fucking crying about bloodied builds.
---
This game is full of snow flakes and cry babies.
---
If i threw a beam splitter on it would it have some sort of effect?
---
when it ends is when Zorbo gets to the end
---
I was in the Charleston capital building testing out a new weapon of mine and the big black ones that seem to have worts all over them would freeze when I killed them as they were trying to stand up... I would still get the loot though
---
I think it's worse than that, we're all still inside 76 in sleep chambers.
---
Ok but you now only get cannon balls as mission rewards
---
Or add it as a function in V.A.T.S.
---
"Press X to toggle C.A.P.S. (Corpse Acquisition Protocol Subsystem)"
---
Activating it would toggle off V.A.T.S. for the purpose of aiming at enemies (to avoid cycling through dead bodies to get to enemies) and just shows the nearest lootable body. Once looted, the next one pops up and so forth until all bodies in your vicinity are looted.
---
what if i leave the team and knock u is that possible
---
Yes No skin weapon new old!
---
*I think I might've had a stroke trying to read that*
---
Not exactly scary in the sense OP seems to mean, but I was exploring the kiddy corner cabins a while back with my gf. We were both mid level 20s. 
---
Just killed a few rad scorps and I hear my gf say "What the fuck is that?!"(this is her first FO game btw) and I just go "huh?" And am attacked from behind. I turn and it's the first Deathclaw I've seen in the game and its wrecking me. I just start chanting "oh shit, it's a deathclaw" while spamming my stimpacks. 
---
This was before I had any legendaries or mutations so I'm just running around like a chicken with its head cut off while it's trying to cuddle with me and my gf is trying to shoot it. 
---
We eventually kill it but it was the first real Oh Shit moment in 76.
---
I understand what you mean. Nothing worse than some player with frog legs and a gauss shot gun doing a spray and prey.
---
You can try changing the walls around the stairs into doorways and then move the staircase. Sometimes that works.
---
Let’s try that
---
With glowing mass, I never see an option to use it in the flora section of my chemist bench.  And I have a ton of it too.   Is there a recipe I need to find?
---
I also sit on large amounts of high radiation fluid because I can never find hardened mass to pair it with.
---
props for Harlan Ellison
---
Dang... Did you do all that without using fingers and toes? IJK!😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
I actually love math. It's a pure immutable science!
---
Oof.
---
I have to double check but I think it’s part of the weapon, it doesn’t have an option to add a Beam Splitter like the one Laser guns have.
---
Yeah, I've been to a couple of SBQ fights where she was killed without even landing once, and with loads of time to spare.
---
At this point, Bethesda needs to sit down and purge their database of all hacked items, fix the "magic" weapon bug, and either nerf or remove legacy explosive energy weapons. And while they're at it, fix the endless stacking of food buffs. Unless and until they do all this, all talk about a balance patch is just this much useless, hot air.
---
I want wasteland junk. Broken buses, wrecked cars.
---
Ok dont use bloodied aganist a non bloodied user youll see what im talking about
---
Damn, you looted their souls
---
1.1k+ hours in and I was not aware of this, thanks!
---
Simple, I share rank 3 inspirational, take it or leave it. Public teams are for xp right. Get you some xp or be on your way.
---
VATS sounds
---
lol.. who cares what you get in packs after like lvl 10?
---
I feel like you missed the idea. No one wants them to make a cubic build area inside the spherical one. Pretty sure everyone wants a cubic build area that the current sphere build area would fit exactly into. You would indeed have a bigger build area then. The illustration would be that if i put a ball into a box without deforming it i could still fit stuff in the corners that the ball doesn’t fill.
---
Did it work?
---
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!I have big brain
---
If you can't kill a bloodied player you aren't thinking enough or your build sucks. Ive never said this before but learn how to play the game.
---
It's even worse than that. 
---
The Fallout 1 manual implies that game is entirely a simulation. And since all canon that comes after that is linked, that means that it is all a simulation from the beginning. 
---
Almost like we are playing it as a videogame.
---
I’m all good now mate! Some guy already did it. But I appreciate the offer
---
I'm not scared of any computer, I roleplay as James T Kirk
---
It's just you.
---
I have that when I go into stealth mode.
---
I think usually when you take environmental damage or like disease it says in the upper left corner?
---
A camp designed to kill you. Traps, environmental health damage.
---
Hell ya!!
---
I have a process for starting the game, havent had the issue except once that made me start doing it. 
---
Log in, go straight to adventure (no atom shop or legendary score screen first). After getting in world, dont open the map for 5 minutes. Wait until everything loads up, if you have slower internet, it can take longer, im usually around 2 minutes. Once its loaded and settled, then open the map and check. 
---
If you follow this and it still fails, let me know. I havent heard from anyone saying they had an issue shen dling this.
---
It was always clear the double score was for dailys.
---
Once you start doing Queen fights all the time you’ll be swimming in Repair Kits, no need to run Gunsmith rank anything anymore.  
---
Boost Bloody Mess to rank 3.  If needed drop or reduce Better Criticals.   Several easy foods will give you this bonus as well.   
---
I like to have 3 points in charisma so I can share a card when needed.  Something to consider.  
---
If you don’t have Dense on your chest piece consider acquiring it somehow.  Immunity to explosions and scorch beast screams is wonderful.  
---
A good looking build, even without changes.  Good job.
---
tou have to hoin the team to revive
---
Well still, write down the name of the challenge and how much score you lost. Beth can comp you easier if you keep track. They said they cant directly give us score buuuuut the devs and managers are filthy liars so so take that with a grain of salt.
---
What causes this?  this has never happened to me and I’ve been online during the daily reset and it always reset without issue.
---
Gotcha, well figured I’d try haha!
---
Thank you VERY much! I have had to move the CAMP unit twice in two days because I couldn't get stuff to scrap, much less move to fix things (like move stuff a little closer in under turret coverage). CAMP building just takes me forever because I don't do it enough to roll through it without hitting the wrong controller buttons or what have you. This was making it take a lot longer on top of that.
---
Well, considering workshops generate resources, have build mechanics, and offer a free fast travel point. It seems more of a PVE mechanic than that of a PVP one.
---
As for griefing, the concept of getting ganked by the same dude over and over because  they want to claim every node on the map is a bit much. What would you call it? Hoarding?
---
My low level  character camps near the Overseer's house in order to loot the .45 ammo and food outside the house, and the stuff inside.
---
All of that resets daily.
---
Plus all those crafting stations
---
Haha I'm right up there with ya! Just under 1k hours and I'm now realizing it. You're welcome!
---
Been this way since launch
---
Agreed!  I live in western nc and the music is everywhere.  Shame there really isn't any in 76.  It's jarring really.
---
I'm sure there's at least a lot of old time recordings if not bluegrass that are public domain at this point.
---
Gotcha
---
Ive putted up some more pics showing a bit of the interior too, named my ship aswell and well brotherhood secrets dont go for cheap!
---
Yeah. I definitely hear you on the wanting to be able to use as many weapons as possible. I plan on keeping a good heavy (hopefully a OP Flamer cause I hear that’s passable for stealth), a good handmade, and/or a good fixer, but since they’re not my primary I don’t want to waste perk cards on them. I’m also really bad about switching out perk cards.
---
they may have just finished the sheepsquatch ate my brother questline which at the end auto starts encryptid  , and at that lvl they probally had no idea what was about to happen
---
Yeah I've had this happen. I was fighting a scorchbeast yesterday and \*heard\* several shots land, but no movement on the health bar. Really frustrating.
---
&gt;and uninstall the game until next season
---
why wait.. uninstall it now
---
I think they should downgrade to 20 players per server instead of 24. I don't think people would even notice, but they would notice the performance improvement. Also let us scrip turn in unlimited, but only let us spend a set daily amount. This would also seemingly free up wasted server side memory.
---
I think this is the part where we find out Bugs Bunny is the artist.
---
I just did the encryptid event. I was looking for the dead imposter sheepsquatch for 5 minutes, since I know I tagged it a few times while being a pylon.
---
It's really fucking annoying.
---
Is it killing you?
---
when I get to that point.. I just start the event and run away so it wont appear in my quest list anymore...
---
Hackers recently have just been making god weapons and duping them repeatedly then releasing them to the masses. Bethesda can't keep up because they all look like in game items. A buddy of mine dropped into a server once with a team full of hackers and they dropped him some good stuff, one of which I believe was a bloodied explosive combat shotgun and a vampires combat knife.
---
i've heard the common arguement against this being that adding fixed arrival location would enable people to trap others, but workshops have them, and it should not be outside the realm of possibility to make it work only for the owner of said camp.
---
I just use them for points in the ammo converter.
---
its not knocking me
---
What system?  On xbox - press and hold A and use the thumbstick to move the item or blueprint further away
---
If they are able to one shot your turrets before they are killed then you are doing it wrong. 3 turrets spaced away from bloodied expo vat shotys upper and lower placements.    
---
I mean flat out there are some workshops easier to defend than others for sure.  Want to be a dick for power plants make 5 floaty missile  and 15 Mk 2  turrets at max range aint no one stealing you base if you are around. Also triple wall outside and place your welcome mat in the center firing point for all your turrets. You could then wait them out while they either get slaughtered by your turrets as you can keep repairing or the fact they can't get to you and force you to leave to take over.   
---
There seems to be two types of bloodied pvp players, those that prey on the weak, and those that want a challenge. Those that want a challenge are split into two groups those that are tryhards and those that respect your effort to utterly defend yourself they normally poke 2-4 times and if they keep dying quick leave or come back with friends.
---
fixer also has slightly higher base damage
---
&gt;completely oblivious to me shooting them, taking some damage and then auto-replenishing, but remaining still all the same.
---
&gt;
---
This is because someone went through the area with an energy weapon at some point. The goo/ash piles eventually respawn as invincible (often naked) enemies that don't attack and can't be killed.
---
I want to say it was somewhere along the train tracks near Watoga. Maybe in a train car? Not 100% on that though
---
If the only reason you are playing g this is to get the LR rewards then why play? It doesnt sound like you are enjoying the game
---
This is the first time it has happened to me. I have heard and read of it happening, and hear to wait after they reset to to logon and I have always done that. Just about everything was done win 16 mins. It is F'n weird.
---
Meeeeeeemoriiiiiiies! All alone in the mooooooon liiiiiight
---
An instigating, vats fill lever action. It's worked fine for ages, until the last patch.
---
Yeah I also just found out that they share the same structure
---
i've found that going into third person without your weapon drawn enables you to more easily pan to see the whole thing.
---
I thought the camp was square this whole time
---
Will do.
---
Exactly! You know as well as I that this type of music is a core part of the regions culture. Now I like the addition of playable instruments in game, but it’s almost laughable how horribly they did their research on the rhythms the instruments produce. If anything they could do what they did for “ring of Fire” and “ country roads”
---
Ahh, I'm sticking to full commando myself, vats seems to work better on that than single shot snipers!
---
I'm still walking around with my keycard for that.  I KNOW that sheepsquatch will kill me dead in one hit.
---
I was doing it for a daily challenge.
---
I just had to play a lot and I finally unlocked frog legs at level 26. It was a bit of a grind but I was already grinding for the Christmas rewards so it was worth it
---
The abandoned cars that you can blow up are the most powerful weapon.lol
---
Yea I’ve seen in other posts that it doesn’t matter if you miss as long you don’t hit something different
---
this it the last try and then im done
---
Don’t go into the water as much. Stay on the edge. I think it’s auto killing you because you’re too far in.
---
I love a max lvl furious fixer on a sneak build.. auto or semi.. its a good gun
---
Man that sounds great! Gotta love when everyone knows what they’re doing and things go smoothly, because it doesn’t happen often. I STILL see high lvls shooting her in the air for 2 dmg with their Gatling plasmas like whyyyy? You literally do way more dmg when she’s on the ground AND she’ll land quicker and more frequently if you let her fly around for a second.
---
The fixer has a higher damage, but they look the same and share the same mod pool. Though combat rifle skins don't work in the fixer
---
Agreed.  I’ve discussed this at length with people that I play with.  I decided not to pursue it.  It’s not like other games with seasons (CoD, Apex, etc) where any type of gameplay contributes significantly to season completion.  Bethesda’s strategy of setting such severe daily limits for score, reputation, caps, scrip, bullion, is inadvertently setting a hard cap on fun and enjoyment.  Not everyone has the luxury of logging in everyday for monotonous grinding.  Let us play when we can and level and complete at a pace that we choose.  If they change this then I’ll continue to buy Bethesda games.  If they don’t, I don’t think I can commit the time.  
---
Side note: has anyone ever gotten feedback from Bethesda?  Their community outreach is abysmal.
---
This game will continue to suffer until they come out with more end game content.
---
Exactly man, it’s not even just frog legs, I just want some perks that aren’t garbage, my other character that I’ve got at lvl 14 had some good luck but I’m trying to level up one that’s built for nw and I’m just getting absolute trash
---
That's lame
---
You considering getting it? :P
---
Ok you have me doubting my 1,600 hours, I haven't had my coffee yet so let me check as a simple Google search isn't helping.
---
Fixer is basicly an enhanced version of combat rifle. With higher base damage (making it best automatic rifle in game) and those special effects it has to stealth.
---
Be excited that there are much better games to play
---
Lmao if you say so. Give me a good IP and nice rewards and ill grind forever.  Love all the downvotes without anyone to say why they didnt like it.  Top notch debate guys
---
How long did you grind per day for 2 weeks? I’m trying to grind it but usually do like 5-6 games before heading to adventure. Any tips would be appreciated, as I love playing nuclear winter legit (not as a bush Wookiee)
---
Except for today...only have 6 greedy bastards!
---
What can I say? The forest is rather thicc!
---
The fixer has an intrinsic sneak perk that makes it optimal for sneak builds. Basically it's one of the few guns that can kinda roll as a 4 star. 
---
They share all of the same mods, but fixers can't use skins; only the combat rifle can change its appearance
---
Where are you going?
---
Love it!
---
Reading is hard for people. I mean the repeatable is listed under weekly.
---
They said a two week pause between seasons
---
Yeah fr.
---
i said it was the last try
---
While it would have been nice to be able to grind the xp reward, I agree that it was very clear that it applied to daily rewards only.
---
Plenty of space. I display all magazines, all Bobbleheads, all bears, all mr fuzzy, board games, toys, and still have room for all crafting machines and furniture
---
Welp
---
they say it don't be like it is but it do
---
The deal was for you to help me too
---
It's really ruin the game, if hackers are handing out good stuff like that, Bethesda should really do something about it.
---
Nothing from bethesda.
---
This is me all the time
---
Haha!
---
Please fix the achievements not unlocking! Seriously! Fucking A man
---
Between 15 - 18 hrs a day, including double exp weekend. If you wanna play it legit, stay with ur team or make a team with friends, take the high ground, and stay close to the fire so that no one can sneak up from behind.
---
Like red dead in a mini map
---
And here I thought Bethesda banning those player will change
---
At your service -)) good to know you liked my works! Thanks for your support!
---
I stopped making mods a while ago due to rl and then seasonal xp grind, but I think I'll get back to it eventually since I already finished the season.
---
At my rank the weekend will give me 3,5 extra ranks, on top of the normal score amounts. I would not call it bad. Or disappointing.
---
I want my Bloodied Broadsider to mean something.  I got the pirate outfit to go with it.
---
Buddy you're telling me. The only way to really resolve things is a complete wipe. Of course that would lead to people hating the game.
---
are you drunk ?
---
I hate the bug where you one shot it in normal aiming, but even tho you do the same damage using vats auto aim says $NO"
---
Just that particular robot and it can take a while for them to attack.
---
It's been like this for me ever since the huge ban.
---
Thanks for the honest response.
---
And why did you think that the WEEKLY repeatable challenge will be doubled in the "Double S.C.O.R.E. from DAILIES" event? They told this 2 weeks ago. So, why did you think otherwise?
---
You make a valid point, stealth will fail at some point and you’ll need an alternate strategy.  I run a low health build on my comando...so I tend to rely on overwhelming damage output as a solution to not getting hit.  As such, my specials points are mostly committed to that end.  Serendipity 3 is my friend for defense. 
---
It’s cool this game allows so many different play styles.
---
The invisible bodies that are lootable are subjected to the ragdoll physics and move accordingly. I found this out after server hopping for whitespring runs and noticed that the invisble body of one ghoul I killed knocked over some lamps on the other side of the room so I went over to that side and found its invisble lootable corpse even though the visible body was stationary. Sometimes the invisible bodies continuously slide in one direction through the world though :(
---
But then with the UFO playset - i can sit just the slide portion in my camp and the entire rest of it is outside the circle...
---
:shrug:
---
True dat.  We have a big music festival that happens near here and my whole office takes vacation, place is a ghost town.  Always some kind of bluegrassy jam going on somewhere throughout the year.
---
Yes , had so many months worth of 1st atoms , my vacation starts tomorrow and im not gonna spending grinding . I have not checked out the paints yet though
---
Yep. I’ve never played a battle royale style game until NW because I’m not exactly good at PVP. I gave NW a chance though because I know the layouts and guns from adventure. So many times I’d get killed quick and my teammates no where to be found. I’m better now but holy crap has it been a grind. Do you use life giver and iron clad?
---
it does seem like a lot of overhead when you could just let the amazing randy take care of it
---
Ammo weight needs to be removed from the game, and ammo limits need to be emplaced.
---
Yea, I think you are right wiping the whole game will only bring more trouble to them.
---
This game isn’t competitive what so ever, so they will never do anything about it.
---
You could never travel to unowned workshops the last I knew.
---
I don't ever remember being able to travel to a workshop unless I owned it.
---
If you're on PC, this can be changed in the game's settings stored in an INI file. There's a really nifty configurator tool on Nexus to change this and a lot of other settings. I always change my Pipboy color in Fallout games, same for friends.
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/546)
---
Note: This is not a mod. It's simply a program that makes changes to a text document with a nice UI and functionality.
---
There are some settings which are nice to have access to in there and some which I swear I changed in the game's settings but it didn't actually change. One really important one is field of view. Did you know the in-game field of view setting is only for third-person? You can change first-person's field of view with this.
---
/u/Von_Cheesebiscuit may be interested as well.
---
You could never fast travel to workshops you didn't control. That has never been changed.
---
I here people say the currency caps are so we have incentive to log on daily, but for me it’s opposite. It makes me want to boycott legendaries it’s so stupid!! I would literally play the game MORE if I could go ham everyday and trade in like 500 scrip. Instead I want to log off after I get my 150 because I don’t want to be over encumbered carrying around scrip legendaries for the next day. But anyway, yeah, less players would help, and letting us drop keycards and keys we’re never gonna use again would help a bit too at least for inventory lag.
---
it is buggy. with gun fu the very first hit has a significant chance to miss, no matter if you are on 95% hitchance or not. unequip the perk and it will work way more often.
---
Which means you need 3 of them at a time, which is 9 weight in your inventory until you get to one.
---
I'm the opposite.  I am getting close to finishing this season (level 83 right now) and once I am done I think I will have a hard time login in till the next season starts.  I like having somethin to work towards, even if it is just a couple of cosmetics and camp items.
---
why? claiming he don't want a bugging perk card shared is totally legit imo.
---
I hope they have another one some time then because that backpack rocks!
---
Honestly I wouldn’t mind it if the stash would have more space... or if something like the scrap box came out for ammo
---
My question where did you find flat enough ground to fo this?
---
I just saw triple nukes on PC about a half hour ago.
---
Well yeah but we are talking about mini nukes and missiles along with the weapon that fires them being removed. your lovely broadsider uses cannon balls mate its fine
---
I used to save them up and go on a shits'n'giggles trip, but tbh even that got old fast.
---

---
Poor thing.
---
I'm at rank 83, never bought any atoms. Play for around 4 hours a day. I earned about 25 levels on the double xp weekend though. It also depends on how you play the game, after doing dailes i farm high level areas so i gain a bunch of score from doing that. A lot of people who play f76 are super casual and they do events like feed the people 24/7 or play the game for 30 minutes a day and then go on reddit and complain that it's difficult to earn ranks. If you min/max your build for experience gain you can get hundreds of thousands of exp in an hour. 
---
During double exp event i was earning 1.6k exp per supermutant. 
---
I don't like writing these posts because it's just a giant waste of time for everybody involved but when i see people like the OP complaining about such difficult daily challenges as "Take a photo at a teammate's camp" or "Hack a Terminal" It's like...... c'mon bruh.
---
No idea havent looked i to it personally just heard it mentioned a few times on videos
---
Wait, we can share perks ?
---
Yeah I didn't read the thing as Double Dailies because I didnt think they would advertise something this negligible. 10k extra score for one week, I mean what's the point? Nobody who is late is going to catch up with 10k extra score? If it's not something big, why advertise it? It was the same for purveyor sale. Nobody uses the purveyor to get random 3 star pitchforks and when sale started I saw modules were not discounted. Only logical bonus Bethesda ever gave were Double XP weekends. This is not worthwhile at all. Can you blame me?
---
Probably until right before Monday's reset
---
Oh yeah, those too. That said, oddly for style I don't mind the odd broadsider
---
Wait does the score double for the repeatable ?? I'm working rn.
---
i leveled up an alt char for NW only with an TSE handmade and noticed the same. i was lvl 40 with the lvl 35 TSE weapon and always got both hits with the same damage. i assume that low level weapons/players are not affected by the nerf.
---
I love it when they launch 3 nukes at the queen in a row.
---
&gt;Yet Bethesda has managed to build a world where rocket launchers are essentially useless
---
Ah.  Well I guess I can delist and just drop the 41 missiles I have in my shop then to free up that weight.
---
Ahh ty for that reminder. As a solo player I looked at some of my cards and they have no effect on much for group playing and I didn’t want to have to redo some, but I do have that one...so now I can share and not feel bad when everyone else is too lol
---
Nah, I want that planetarium and extra atoms so I get at least something useful for ranking up 80 times and getting shitty rewards most of the time.
---
Well
---
Finish the quest line at least till Morgantown Airport, you get a small backpack plan from it which will increase your carry weight limit.
---
Near the Wayward Tavern, there is a cap stash next to 3 hanging radstags. Roughly NE of the tavern (N of the overseer's camp), among the trees. There's also a box of .308 ammo and a lvl1 hunting rifle on the sleeping bag, if no one else looted it first.
---
So I'm sitting at my chemistry bench and each Stable flux requires 1 Glowing mass and the other 2 I mentioned. It's the first one on the list of ingredients needed. 
---
As for the inequity in glowing/hardened/HRF..... Well that's just fallout RNG.
---
They don't spawn in the open world, they are awarded for a quest. However players can drop a full suit anywhere and that's what your friend found.
---
He probably got a set of ultracite from completing the BoS quests. That’s the reward for completion.
---
Edit: And the X01 you get from completing the Enclave quests. So he either did that or someone gave them to him as another user mentioned.
---
Think he may be lying
---
start grinding yo..
---
Oh yeah, an ammo box would be great.
---
I always thought they placed the mini nukes in like very structurally important parts of the dam, not just shooting so that's why it was so easy to do but I could of missed something.
---
Nothing like getting suddenly over encumbered after a mission ends and there still being a bunch of enemies around you can’t outrun.
---
That’s what i have to do. Going back and forth to make it work, but it shouldn’t be like that. I’m using a vats focused build and sometimes my weapons are useless despite the cards. I have a explosive shotgun and gauss rifle they are always bugged, so if I get 5 shots and miss 2 with other 3 I’m already surrounded by ghouls filling me with rads
---
Exactly. If you don't know what to expect, you only know there is some assaultron that thinks it's a sheepsquatch, and there are some steps to make him vulnerable. Nowhere a hint on a swarming Gutsys and bot army, with shite ton of flying bombs on top of 1hit KO beam, which is seasoned with constant fast life drain if you take all the pylons. It's a unexpected nightmare quest that could be started even long before lv50.
---
Glad u and Murm get along so well...she hates my guts.
---
Server roll backs are a thing. But you'd lose all you built up.
---
Another player could have dropped the suit. But afaik they have to be crafted.
---
Create a new character. Get to the wayward. Challenge complete. Time alotted, 180 seconds. Profit.
---
I really am not at this point. I did at start of the season but it didn't last and now it's a matter of "at least get to the end so you can get the rewards worth getting and then stop playing."
---
Yeah we can
---
Maybe we'd resign to whoever is next in line at Raven Rock then that would eventually lead to Richardson. Either way, it would be cool to tie them in as needing our help for Presidential access.
---
That makes sense I thought that as well thank you because if they did I would be hoping severs for hour and getting tons of them.
---
Sadly no.
---
It doesn't take a dupe or cheat weapon to down the queen that quickly. They never fixed the magic weapons.
---
Yeah it's a pain, most times I just dump them if I'm not close to a stash box, but hey until Bethesda makes them useful, more points for other ammo I actually use.
---
I vot this bug only once, at the third day, or so... I only lost 1250 points.
---
I feel sorry for your lost, this is a big issue :(
---
This seems like the logical thing to do. I saw somewhere someone had a table of how far you want to be in the pass at each reset. I think if you are 40-45 you are on track.
---
Trap bases were a thing but that has fallen off.
---
Traps no longer cause enough damage to be a concern.
---
True. If it gets too much worse I may just have to do that.
---
Definitely agree with this. If the level was like 2x 3x per week I could deal with that but its a bit much now
---
And is that the correct behaviour he displayed in response? No.. I get it, but just message the player or leave the team is there any need to go on reddit and be raging? If the argument was civil I'd entertain it.
---
I saw that I think he’s right that someone gave it to him
---
Did your turrets shoot at Chally?
---
Can I blame you for not being able to read and comprehend? I sure can.
---
It’s your fault.
---
Agree, vanguard and bloodied builds will already have their needed perks, share something all builds will benefit from.
---
Awesome, thanks! Time to go betray some trusting robots...
---
Because I didn't think doubling the score reward from dailies was worth advertising which was equal to 10k extra score. So many people lost a lot more on autocompleting dailies, this barely makes up for that. It felt pointless, I thought it must be better than it looks.
---
I will tag her in the air if she is flying around aimlessly to agro her to someone and stand up in the middle of a field or walk away from the tents and fences. There is only one other time I shoot in flight. I have seen groups that do intense damage in air, then I will start wasting the ammo. It’s rare but when they are shooting in air and I get the message that she mutated, I know it’s going down.
---
Bluegrass would be perfect. 
---
Any bluegrass musicians out there want to donate some of your work to Bethesda so the can put it in the game?
---
But the talking point is that licensing music isnt exactly at the top of bethesdas bucket list.
---
Are you serious? How sad. Literally the only reason I was even partially excited. Like I thought it was gonna be like double xp but NOPE
---
Also turn dryer to low heat and make sure it is laundry day on the calendar.
---
Well I would assume that’s because the season is still going on for other people, I’m talking about when the season is completely done for everyone and we’re waiting for season 2 (I.E: in September)
---
Way back closer to launch, i was wandering around my newly built house in the dark. Nothing but a pip boy light and a hunting rifle, foraging for some wood and whatever else i could find. I was maybe level 25. Headphones on, which i love because you can kind of hear where things are around you. As I'm crouched down trying to pick up some wood i heard a super weird noise from behind that I'd never heard before. When i stood and spun around, that damn mothman was SUPER close to the camera nearly taking up my whole 46" screen. Volume was loud and right after i saw it, it poofed into smoke and moths and disappeared.
---
The small group i was playing with had a good laugh at that one.
---
I moved shortly after.
---
It just works
---
I don’t think cards stack. If two people share the same card it will only take the value of the higher card.
---
You're right but it's disappointing for people who lost score on autocompleting challenges which includes me. My weeklies bugged last week. This barely makes up for that.
---
It's on my original account (4250 +/- hours), with three leveled at approximately 400, 200, 200, and one at 20. My second account is around 3000 hours with 5 level 200s +/-, one may be around 150. I play a minumum of 8-hours per day...no life other than feeling bad in a different way every day. I do cook my newer toons to L50, because I cannot stand the low-level grind any more, which takes about two months +/-.
---
Completely unknown. Both PS5 and XBoxSeriesX are supposed to be backwards compatible with previous gen, so that option will be there from launch.
---
Whether we get a next-gen specific version is completely up in the air. On one hand, it feels like fixes and such are at a slow pace, so working on a updated version for next-gen would also take a while. On the other hand, using FO76 as the guinea pig for their engine on next-gen consoles would allow them to work out any issues before their next big game release.
---
Ya I’m thinking that’s what happened I wanted to confirm with the fallout 76 community as I haven’t played in forever
---
I understand that the game is not competitive, but dupe weapon ruined the market and I like to think the market is a part of the game.
---
Holy shit...300 hours in and I’ve never heard of this
---
I think so.. I am glad I was at base because if I was away he could have really wrecked everything and I would have known.
---
What do you mean by magic weapons?
---
definitely silly. im just trying to think of ways to help keep a full team. i think the reality is im going to have to keep joining to most populated team, or create a new teams when mine disbands.
---
I'm about to.
---
Ok, maybe I need to look closer next time and I'm just taking the glowing mass for granted.   Thank you for helping me figure this stuff out.
---
Check out your atom challenges first, some of them also revolve around destroying x amounts of robots with a certain weapon so you can kill 2 (thousand) birds (robots) with one stone (Troubleshooters 10 mm submachine gun)
---
I thought it was odd that everything was 500 and not 250.
---
I don’t think he know that players can drop them and you can just pick them up as he just started using power armor.
---
I definitely would if I was on PC!
---
You say that but when I got a missile launcher with 15 missiles in nuclear world I survived almost the whole match and got 3 kills.
---
I’m sure there would be a few of us out there! That’s a pretty solid idea there
---
Me too. Apparently we were idiots for thinking Bethesda would do something to compensate for all the autocomplete bugs.
---
No problem. I still have questions at level 375.
---
It was planed like this way before they aknowledged the autocomplete bug. They stick to the plan.
---
We already have 9 dailies, not 6, so, if its not bugs out, there is your catch-up mechanic...
---
10K free score is fine by me. 3-4 free ranks, thats 3 day playtime. Ill be off for a week, so this makes the grind less.
---
More than likely or he is just misremembering how he got them.
---
send it to me in a private message and then dont talk about it anymore.
---
I need exact details how to do it.
---
I personally think that these weapons should stay in the game, but BSG should make them super powerful (realistically should be a one hit kill for most if not all enemies), but then make the ammo super rare, either by only having them be rare rewards from certain events, or make the crafting requirements high. That way there is incentive to use them, they become something rare that people will want to get, and you might actually see people use them. 
---
Especially with the mini nuke, it would be cool if, like in NW, there is a mini nuclear blast radius that is created where it was launched. Maybe that doesn't exist as long as a regular nuke blast zone, but one that is large enough that could spawn a small number of  glowing enemies (if in the right place), and be able to harvest radiated flora.
---
Weapons with a specific legendary effect and 200+ faster fire rate.
---
There's also the limb damage bug that they never fixed.
---
Have you been playing long enough to remember the glitching ghouls at whitesprings? They used to chase you around at super speed in their laying down position. 
---
MOST of the time you were the only one that saw it as it was a visual/lag issue. This made you look crazy while your jumping around yelling at your team to get them off you like you just walked through a spider web.
---
Good times....
---
I live in America, too, and can confirm there are things to do besides videogames.
---
I bought a house, and it's been keeping me plenty busy.
---
Try that.
---
Buy a house.
---
I have a 10 story.
---
I may be on. Unlike most i wont give spoilers or unwarrented help. Ask and receive: Egroegy is who I am on psn. I go by egg
---
People spending real money for non competitive game is really stupid, or really really rich I guess :
---
I have 2 in my stash. They are washable. I will sell them.
---
Wear my mask!
---
Not gonna happen mate. 😛
---
I was about to comment that I joined an Encryptid with two very similar player levels.  One of them managed to be the conduit for awhile but died via the laser blast.  His friend fell victim too.  I kindly stood over there dropped loot so no one would claim all their junk.  Both gave me heart emojis.  
---
We did win the event though.  It was a victory for mankind
---
Luckily I haven't got smacked in the face by em but in sure it makes a lot of people mad. It would me. I dont play JUST for score but I do a lot of em. A lot I do normally but like I want that thunder cannon NGL
---
You would just submit it as a “bug” on the support page I believe.
---
I totally get that. But it's all just cosmetic stuff really. Im starting to feel the burn too. But tbh aside from the level up challenges, and some of the NW ones, can be done in an hour or two each day. 
---
Since Double XP weekend ended I've almost only been playing long enough to get the challenges and then get off. I've skipped a few dailies and not felt bad about it. You get enough atoms over the course of LR that you should be able to buy the last 5 or so ranks. So just dont stress about it. Get the stuff you want, and dont let ruin the game for you. What's the point of stressing over cosmetics if it makes you stop playing?
---
Useless vs fun as hell. I keep a TS Fatman for the lols. If I find mininukes I just start my own pyrotechnics display.
---
Also, killing flying creatures like sting wings and bloatflys with missles inVATS is funny
---
Don’t have those yet 🤣 I’m keep getting melee perks and hack detector etc the only decent perk I’ve got so far is refractor
---
A new character and level up very fast. 
---
Make one, deleted around level 6. Repeat, challenge sorted.
---
Initially I thought it was an entire new PA rather than just a skin, but then I realised it was just a version of the Captain Cosmos Power Armor. Hey if you have a little time spare would you be able to check out the Dark Matter PA, maybe post a screenshot or something, just so I can see how it looks?
---
PARKOUR!
---
I just learned something last night.   I realized if I just harvest the same ultracite veins over and over in a blast zone, the scorched just keep coming and coming.   I'm going to log on today and see how much hardened mass I got.   But I do know it's far more than I ever got before.   
---
So hopefully it wasn't a glitch and something I can replicate.   If so, my hardened mass problems are hopefully over.
---
Exactly. I don't mind the "Gain 3x a Week" in the weeklies. That's reasonable. But the daily challenge - every day - needs to go. I've literally leveled up more in the past 3 weeks than in the 3 months before that.
---
I would've prefer you blaming me for thinking Bethesda would do something to compensate players accordingly for the all autocomplete bugs they had to deal with but we don't always get what we want I suppose.
---
I was chillin at munitions factory one night just farming ammo and such. It was late at night about 1am, not too much activity in the server, id probably had that workshop for a couples hour at this point with no hiccups so it was pretty relaxed farming kind of half afk while I browsed on my phone. Well, I started hearing some noises in the factory and not the normal noises of machines whirring and the building creaking but footsteps, thuds and shimmying like somebody was in there with me. Didn’t think too much of it I just grabbed my controller and walked around thinking it’s a mongrel or a stuck ghoul or something. Looked around, didn’t see anything but the noises stopped. Went back to afk and couple minutes later I hear the same noises again, at this point I feel like someone’s messing with me, gotta be. I had it at this point so I just go around shooting, throwing grenades trying to find this invisible bastard but still nothing and the noises stopped again. I finally said fuck it whatever come kill me if that’s what you want so I just went back to the machine grabbed my rounds and was just gonna wait. After I grabbed the ammo I turned back around and was face to face with a dude wearing a toothy man mask and a swim suit and I swear I’ve never jumped so high off my couch it scared the crap outta me lmao we both had a good laugh as he gave me a thumbs up emote and went on his way. Good times.
---
I find lvling up is so much easier with the boost they gave to food and with the new team system.   All my toons are in the mid 100’s to 200’s and i can lvl up once a day and more EZPZ.   
---
Cram relish, brain soup, builders team boost, inspirational.    Usually almost a lvl up after a west tek run.
---
&gt; 300 hours in 
---
Those are rookie numbers my dude - gotta pump those numbers up!
---
They probably had no idea what they were getting into or how horribly they were about to die..
---
"Meh, how scary can some robot sheep really be..?"
---
I seriously doubt that it will be fixed anytime soon.  Bethesda takes forever to fix bugs that hinder your game play.   If there is a bug that benefits the player in any way or somehow gives an advantage, you can count on them to fix that in a matter of hours.
---
I once saw a guy fire a gun with orbital strike as the bullets, also there is one guy who drop me a binocular that looks like a laser right and shoots like one to except it doesn't require any
---
Edit: I reckon those are cheat weapons?
---
Im not saying its not doable but it does require playing everyday pretty much if you want to reach the end. I was at rank 35 when my account got suspended. Im at 42 or something now with new account. If you combine those i quess i would be somewhere at rank 60
---
Way to complete that nightmare for me...
---
The explosive eyebots I think are the biggest surprise the first time around.  That, and not realizing stealth damage isn’t doing anything 
---
And yeah, as a quest line, I sort of knew what to expect as I had joined one before, but still takes a few tries to get a feel for it
---
Its uhm pretty ...looks like a diving suit lol, i can send my psn on pm if you wanna join and check it out
---
My god you’re  insufferable.
---
Sadly I am unable to find such an option, I could report myself since you can report a player, but that would likely be stupid to do so.  🤣
---
I’m in my 220s, and it’s a push to get that done each day. Lot of dungeon farming for XP. After this season, I will have plenty of unused points if I ever choose to respec my character. Always a bright side, right?
---
Did you know ghouls crawl out of the *ceilings* in whitesprings golf club?
---
Do it. I haven't tried selling them in a long time but I'm almost positive I never sold a single missile at 1 cap each. I just drop them in train stations now.
---
I know this feature exist, but I never used it and I always forget about it. Thanks forthe reminder.
---
Sounds like something our group does out of boredom lol
---
Nukes 12 minutes or less after she dies. Triple hit the queen, pop up an encrypted event and then burn the server because its all in cooldown. Rinse and repeat
---
I mean i like the music on there but 60% of the songs are from the Fallout 3 days.
---
Butcher pete, civilization, and many others. It was bad enough that bethesda reused the music for Fo4 but for Fo4 and 76.
---
Look at when 76 launched, they used a cover of Country roads instead of using the John Denver version. Same thing with nuclear winter theme ring of fire. They used a cover instead of using Johnny Cash version. Bethesda would have great talent for music for Appalachia radio if they would open the doors. And heck they may even give you a little mpney for the work. I hope that u/ladydevann is reading this.
---
First time I saw a moth man I was running around the mire, and then I just kinda look up in the trees for no reason and there it was.  Before I could finish thinking, "Oh shit, that's a mothman!" he fucking flash stepped right into my face.  I panicked and sprayed ammo at him and then he just up and vanished.
---
By far my favorite grinding the wasteland weapon. Never runs out of ammo. Just use it in vats and you will be fine. Use it outside vats and your taking potshots at god.
---
Nukes can, too. This is all I do with these explosive types of ammo. Grind them up on the ammo converter.
---
there are myriad ways of grieving tho, none particularly earth shattering, but enough
---
It's mostly a personal problem of mine to tbh. I don't like being drip fed on these things, I want to get it over with and switch to something else because there is nothing left here to do except getting the rewards. I want to get them as soon as possible and focus my attention on something entirely different without checking my watch everyday to see whether dailies reset, whether they got bugged again etc. It became an impulse to play this game rather than an enthusiasm.
---
I completely agree with you,  I’ve just come to terms this is the way fo 76 is
---
Weapon new as weapon, no skin.  Skin new no, weapon new... yes?
---
Lasers: Guerilla, automatic barrel and beam splitter. The only way to get damage competitve with suppressed rifles also requires glitched legendaries(Instigating/Junkie's/Medic's/Stalker's/bash damage/limb damage/+33% VATS hit chance), and unfortunately using a beam splitter makes it break a lot faster. Hope you got a lot of repair kits. I recommend regular over Ultracite, Ultracite is just weaker in terms of base damage and DPS due to energy damage being so broken and it's such a chore to unlock mods for.
---
Plasma: Flamer is very good, splitter is also pretty good with the above listed glitched legendaries. It's even more fraul than a laser tho, and the ammo is costly and heavy. The flamer is fun with a Vampire's effect, I've run Encryptid with a Prime Vampire's plasma flamer and just tanked Imposter while melting it. Oddly the single shot and automatic barrels are the weakest setups.
---
Gamma Gun: Severely underrated, the big issues are cost of ammo and reloading. Put the automatic mod on it and it tears shit up.
---
Salvaged Assaultron Head: Useless unless it's Quad. Quad gets the best damage, but you have to load more shots to achieve it. Basically an energy version of The Dragon. The no damage thing in VATS is still an issue, but I just used Polly's head in the Wayward questline last night successfully against level 6 scorched(2 charges with no perks lol). I keep forgetting about these because I scrip or scrap them as soon as possible.
---
The VATS Unknown: Level 50 versions are nearly viable, TBH. The real issue is the chore of acquiring ammo. Do NOT use the fusion mag. Ever.
---
All 4 of these(ignoring Ass Heads because I never use them now lol) share issues with durability and the fact that rifles just outperform pistols for several reasons. I'm always happy to see someone buck trends and go their own way when it comes to having fun tho.
---
The concrete building pack.
---
Wow yeah that is garbage. I’m sorry dude that you’re getting burnt like that.
---
This is what happens when you don't buy the merchants stuff
---
Thought this was common knowledge  😋 This is a good way to keep track of world challenges.  It’ll notify you as you progress up
---
Maybe another PSA could be that you can rename weapons/armor so that you don’t accidentally scrap them
---
You're welcome!
---
We are talking about Adventure mode, not Nuclear Winter. The missile launcher is decently powerful in NW.
---
I don't have a full collection but I'm very close. I just display my favorites. You can rotate them out once in a while. Saves on CAMP space and doesn't lose your collection.
---
Im being told I'm wrong.  Don't rush your coffee.  
---
I probably take glowing mass for granted since I always have so much of it.
---
I have the stealth mod on my PA, so there's really nothing to see.  
---
Move along.
---
I bought one last year, they are a handful.
---
I hope this post doesn't make it seem like I'm spending hours on this game. I really only play an hour or two a day if  I'm lucky. The rest is spent exercising, working, and playing with my kid until she passes out at night. 
---
I think the mindless gameplay is catching up to me and the hour spent playing 76 isn’t giving the return on relaxation as it once did
---
That’s the way to do it! I need to get into a better rhythm of running the silos early in the week.
---
well you are gonna need those lvls when the legendary perks come out
---
Once when I give up leveling, Ill use this method.
---
Relog and the other 3 should appear.
---
However they will likely appear completed.
---
This is why I want the option to have more perk card packs because as a beginner you don’t really stand much chance with perks like that and it takes an eternity to level up
---
Also congrats on the house!
---
No you used the word redundant wrong
---
I'm on Xbox. But it's ok I think I can imagine what it probably looks like from the Captain Cosmos skin just before the end. I think I might just find my way to the bottom of the middle section Chapter 2 Battle at the Black Hole and grab the Atomic Onslaught paint for XO1 and call it a day, no need to make it feel like a job lol.
---
It's been suggested before: give us AmmoPoints instead of Ammo.
---
The fireplace gave me a chortle
---
You used to be able to combine the raider mask with a gas mask.  Made it look like you had 3 air filters.  Really wish you could do more helmet/mask combos though
---
I mean wait if it what make you feel comfortable but I honestly think it's just a random thing that happens cuz I was logged on at reset like 3 days in a row and didn't get the bug and the next day I logged in about 30 mins after and got the bug.  But I keep track of my score on an actual note pad( I'm kinda old school) and there was about a five min or so delay but I was given the score for said challenges this could be I just got lucky or some people arnt watching there score close enough but who knows
---
It’s not that big of a deal. Only gives double score for the dailies and so only lets you catch up on 4 days of dailies missed. Last weekends double xp was way better for grinding score.
---
Fffaaakkkeeee post
---
Oh, yeah.
---
I also still get the ones who default to the T-pose and move at you with no animation. Somehow, it's worse when they don't move.
---
Haha I wish it was common knowledge! It would've been helpful since beta 🤦‍♂️ better late than never though!
---
Good call on renaming weapons though!
---
A legendary Gauss minigun probably
---
I found a place by Mama Dolces and I will fight tooth an nail to keep it! It’s flat, has resources, and it’s pretty central so it’s good for fast traveling
---
It's a good trick, amazing during the Christmas events I had to drop like 30 legendaries as there were so many Christmas Scortched. If you can't find a vein that was converted to Ultracite, you can claim a camp and fight waves. They have the goodies too.
---
So just fast travel away no big deal then block the offender and go on your way
---
I was in high 30’s- low 40’s when I started it only because I had no clue what I was getting in to or what to do. Figured out real quick I was going to die...a lot. Luckily higher levels showed up quick and I just kept running to a pylon after every respawn.
---
Yeah or the could’ve at least given you the 80 perk pack glitch or something. I grinded during double XP weekend.
---
could they make it another station though
---
Last night VATS wouldn't even open for me
---
Exactly what happened to me when I did the quest line. Had no idea what was going on. I just remember robots everywhere and dying a lot.   I eventually just said fuck this and left.  
---
Now this quest is just EZ.
---
Thanks, I'll have a look at those.
---
Submit it under the feedback category in whatever sub-category best fits the exploit. For example if it involves using a display case submit it under the “camp” sub-category.  
---
Edit: once you get to the page where you explain it there is a drop down to mark it as an exploit.
---
I would like them to add,take me back to west Virginia, the version sung by Oxhorn of course
---
You keep educating me.    Thanks.     Is there anything I can do with my 400 inert flux other than dump it?
---
How do ypu know what country the server is in?
---
Slightly unrelated; Since Wastelanders, the perception of enemies (Ghouls in particular) seems to have decreased. Using Charleston Capitol as an example. I go there during my XP/Legendary Farming route. Used to be I'd stand at the top of the rubble-ramp, throw a frag grenade and almost every Ghoul in the place would come running, letting me mow them down easy.
---
Since Wastelanders, maybe one or two of them will come out after the grenade explodes.
---
Noticed as well at the WS Club House. Used to be when I would trip the explosive that appears at the side entrance on a fresh server, the ghouls would b-line it towards me. Now, they don't even wake up.
---
They're not even worth picking up for scrap.
---
Seems like a huge waste of time and effort to me.
---
You just gotta build a secondary temporary set of stairs that connect the floors.
---
Once you do that, you can remove/modify the first set. Once thats done you can remove the temp stairs.
---
But you cannot have a floating upper section of floor that isnt connected in some way to a set of stairs.
---
The kitchen may or may not be clipping into the side of a hill.
---
Thank you for your contribution, friend!  We are friends now, yes?
---
Dont do it. The futuretec skin is bugged. It will cause your camp to be invisible on thebmap.
---
Programming a sphere is a simple formula.   Trying to do a square that is portable is not a simple program to write.
---
Where are the corners going?  I bet you want to spin the square when placing it.  That interaction is not supported when placing your camp.
---
Building in the real world is much easier to do with squares (legos) than spheres. Defining a curve in a blueprint is more complex.
---
Pvp is the endgame for a lot of players. Once your done with the story, maxed rep, lvl 100+ and did your dalies, pvp is all thats left.
---
I'm a noob in this game.  I'd love a huge stash of missiles.
---
Yeah you're right I guess.
---
They are actually better than water for thirst if you don't mind the radiation ( bloodied builds use it for the radiation) but I typically dump it as I prefer toxic goo for my Radiation doses.
---
To get it to recognize you having sludge lung you first have to get a disease other than sludge lung, then while that disease is still active you have to get infected with sludge lung (so 2 diseases active at that point, one being sludge lung).
---
I run non-addicted and full health.. I find the card useful 
---
I am skilled enough at FPS to survive without it.. but I am greatly looking forward to its return..
---
and slightly apprehensive regarding what will be broken in its place...
---
I launched 3 last night at like 2am to 4am est on PS4 server stayed for all 3 which is good
---
Aquaboy/girl is also pretty bad for Bloodieds who just want to go for a nice rad swim. Had to kick someone sharing that as there was no way of communicating with them.
---
Ues join me people stoped pvping my group so you'll be fine with us
---
I loved how talking to Harry in the water shed gave you the option to say "mom" to one of his questions. I think that also bailed you out without having to pass any checks
---
Are you saying to nuke a workshop then claim the workshop?   That sounds fun.
---
Man what platform u on? . Am also a real appalachian native that plays 76.
---
Compared to some of the other games I've played their idea of a grind is practically a cakewalk.
---
I have reliably been getting every non-nw daily and weekly with very little special effort just in the course of leveling a character.
---
Yep, definitely plan on getting that fireplace from the atom shop.
---
No, would be nice though. 
---
I just finished the rep grind with this toon, a support toon, and it was terrible because of the vats bug. The pistol part is fun; it's a little more challenging than most. However, vats has to work because stealth without a silencer is near impossible to maintain.
---
Yeah that would be a great addition other than the classical we have right now!
---
Xbox friend!
---
Biggest change: PUBLIC TEAMS. You now have instant access to other wastelanders. This gives you easy use of team and shared perks, makes herd mentality an absolute must mutation, gives you additional boosts like increase xp from Int boosted building themed teams, and you also have additional free travel points at team mates camps and tents.
---
i say we buff missile launchers and the fatman so they can actually do damage to mobs
---
yeah I've never turned the classical one on lol
---
how else are bethesda going to make us heavier so we subscribe to fallout 1st?
---
Mob has 700hp, one bloodied headshot does around 3k dmg, brain v0.5 said that we don't need 300-500 more dmg.
---
Overkill is overkill.
---
Yeah I figured so. Ive been wanting to do this for awile but cant find a flat enough spot without being in one of the higher level zones such as the cranberry bog or the Mire.
---
So if you nuke FSP, and then nuke it again, does it kill the queen, give you XP and loot, and then immediately spawn another queen?
---
9 stories ? Wtf. Are you on Xbox? I need to see this
---
I typicalky will share Green Thumb.
---
Vats is completely broken for pvp for any weapon that's ammo uses gunpowder if I remember correctly. Railways and bows work in vats tho. It's been broken since last update and it's quite a pain it the butt that Bethesda wont fix it. You use vats on people and you'll see damage numbers and health jump back up which makes you think you're doing damage when in reality you arent doing any damage at all.
---
Thanks Grahm.
---
Stalking mothman got me pretty good a few times. Otherwise a fog crawler horde spawning in the underwater cave in Kerwood mine freaked the shite out of me.
---
This person is obviously a marine biologist and needs nudibranch specimens for research.
---
When you pile up all the bugs, it's just not fun anymore.
---
A mob taking 4 headshots yet is still alive despite taking like 10 times more dmg than it's hp pool, enemies randomly dying around you for no reason, the bad level scaling feature that forces you to hop servers way too often, bugged ennemies who spawned naked and can't be killed ...
---
Hard to believe this game is 2 years old ... it's like playing an alpha/beta version of a game. Especially when you look at what's available at endgame ... pretty much nothing that's worth being farmed. (SBQ and nuking giving flux to make powerful ammos that you don't need in the first place and that you'll only be using to get more flux anyway??)
---
As soon as I get a better GPU, I'm going back to Ark ... the multiplayer openworld experience is a thousand times better and there's an insane amount of content. And, most importantly, the devs actually give a shit about their game. And it pains me to say that because I'm sure fallout 76 could be a great game if Bethesda actually tried.
---
I have 700 hours, idk how many hundreds of legendaries I've been through, and I still have not gotten one single bloodied gun naturally.  
---
While the unyielding armor seems easy enough to get, the bloodied weapons seem almost unattainable.   Nevermind getting the right bloodied weapon for my build.  
---
I've been toying with perks like nerd rage, but unless a really great bloodied gun falls to me magically, I'm not going to invest in the rest of the build.
---
You can do it in any order but claiming it after you nuke ensures a first battle right away.  FYI of you plant crops or build anything they will get destroyed. I tried to farm flux it doesn't work.
---
Nope, it was taken away deliberately
---
Do you have or are you the Claw? 
---
With no new weapon skin, Yes.
---
I use a Medic's minigun with 40% bashing damage and I can tear through her health.
---
Nothing about screwing over both factions prevents you from getting them. No matter what you choose you end up being ally with both factions and have access to everything.
---
Hit detection is a problem.  Kinda useless right now.
---
I was just wondering if a gauss minigun equivalent of your gun would shred her even faster. Can't find any info on this ):
---
mole miner dying.
---
I used to ignore these regularly, but now just start a new character every day. It’s become kind of a challenge in itself to see how quickly I can level up the character. I can do it in 8 minutes now, and that’s with multiple tests with timers. Just start new, run through the vault not picking up anything, exit the vault, discover the moonshiners shack, discover the lumber mill, discover wixons homestead, discover the overseers camp, craft a throwing knife and one cheap armor or cosmetic from the atomic shop, then run in the wayward. Mash your way through the dialog and kill the intruder, and you’ll level up. It’s super quick and easy
---
X01 you need to craft though.
---
No took the grind of getting items etc away found a mod that had all items to choose from so kinda made question op and useless lol
---
Are you on PS4? I can help.
---

---
How’s that?
---
I'm thinking of nuking that farm workshop in the forest then claiming it.   I imagine I'll get at least a bunch of flora, which is basically my last step to building a jetpack and a decontamination arch.
---
I am on PS4 actually.
---
I have a heavy gunner build and I'm working on a stealth sniper build too.
---
My gamer tag is Nostracannibus just like my reddit name.
---
I just had a guy buy like 3 missiles less than an hour ago.
---
I don't know if I'm more surprised that someone bought them or that I was crazy enough to have them listed in the first place.
---
I miss adrenaline perk.... I know what it feels like when something you enjoy stops working. See you in the wasteland.
---
everyday i get some kind of jump scare from this mother loving game, the wildest for me was when i saw my first SBQ. im around the morgantown airport, checking every inch of space (loot goblin). suddenly i hear an alarm and my nerves get a little spiked, and then comes the "WHAP..... WHAP.... WHAP..." and i see it in the sky! i quickly double back and run to the furthest corner of the nearest building to cower like the level 5 that i am. i slowly but sure venture back to the entrance, must have been some type of tent or barrack since it was an open entrance way, and i see it hovering above me as if it knew my ass was in there but after a few minutes (and MUCH) to my relief it flew off on its way.
---
😍 Great idea, love the photo.
---
It was called “double dailies” on the roadmap. What did you expect?
---
Stairs + upper flooring, ascend forever!!!
---
You are the Chad the world needs
---
Yes. True. I was just throwing theories out there. 
---
Long shot scenario: he crafted it and forgot he crafted it. Doubtful but some people’s minds and memory work in drastically different ways.
---
Awesome! Thank you so much! I've got a backlog of stories im working on just need time to work on them.
---
Yeah , the onslaught looked kind of nice imo
---
If you can 1-shot them, get as close as possible and spam the menu the moment they die. There's always that brief moment where it'll flicker before becoming unopenable. If you can get the inventory open before that, you can grab their shit before it's too late.
---
Darn. I am on PC. Was hoping could team up...like to play with team that finally understands some appalachia dialect.
---
Trying to tell everyone there is a 3 star legendary over yonder...usually gets confused signs popping up everywhere. Jk.
---
Stay off this sub if you want to enjoy the game. The vast majority of posts are constant whining and bitching about every single last thing in the game. If it exists in the game, there are posts complaining about it. If it *doesn't* exist in the game, people will complain about that.         
---
I have never seen a more negative gaming sub before.
---
Bodyguards, strange in numbers, travel agent
---
Hate: sun kissed, rad sponge etc
---
My stairs will NOT connect to my 2nd story roof. I just assumed the gsme made it not possible
---
I mean, maybe. Most likely right, since gauss guns are supposed to be better than the regular ones. 
---
Personally, I dont want to burn all my legendary modules trying to find out. My RNG luck is terrible. My medic minigun was free and I do plenty of damage even though I'm specced for a stealth sniper, not a single heavy gunner perk.
---
I actually picked up a fully modded x-01 that someone left somewhere. I have a hard time thinking it was intentional... but no one was around so I am not complaining.
---
I had already gone to one event before getting my own keycard, because Fixer plans.  I know now I had no chance at that point to get Fixer plans.  Maybe Saturday afternoon on map with 8+ high level players, sure, give it a try?  1 AM on a mostly empty map?  I feel sorry for whoever lost their card on that event.
---
Alpine. River. Cabins. It took me a good minute to figure out that it was a prank but the opening and closing doors, moving objects in the cabins and the screams had me spooked for sure
---
Sort by value
---
The only good fatman is a 90% reduced weight bloodied fatman
---
I sometimes drop full sets of power armor for whoever to grab if I haven’t used it in forever and I need stash space. I really only use excavator for farming lead anyway. Otherwise all combat is done without PA.
---
you gotta nuke something
---
I was not there, but thank you!
---
Actually, in your case in particular, you could convert them into something more useful since the converter takes them 3 at a time.
---
Yeah, the last one happened to me too last night. Just trying to complete the "Claim 5 Workshops" challenge and got ganked three times at different workshops trying to do so. I'm mostly kitted out for Shotgun damage and no sustain, so it basically was a one-sided fight the entire time.
---
The only advice I can give is to clear out the enemies, and then go to the edge of the workshop zone and enter Build mode while in stealth. Build mode activates the Claim process from a distance, so no need to be adjacent to the workshop proper. That way if it becomes "Contested" you can duck out instantly. Personally, I just learned of this myself so all I can do is pass along the knowledge.
---
Yeah I can't do any roofs. Shit ain't pretty, just a bunch of wooden boxes in the sky but hey,
---
Modifying the code for targeting and recon mods to persist after enemy death would be the easiest fix.
---
Did you emote for it before hand? Also, if on Xbox let me know ill run it with you. I cant do more than one pylon though.
---
Firing gauss weapons is up there for sure. The sound vats makes when you have a crit ready. The sound when you exchange a legendary weapon even though it’s bugged and doesn’t make the sounds every time. And the most heard noise, may be annoying to some, the noise when you gain caps is lovely to me. And since I’m a gun nut I just love the way any non silenced gun sounds, namely the .50 cal hunting rifle, and the handmade sounds just like an AK47 they really nailed that one.
---
I still hang onto the Daisycutter Fatman just to get rid of mini-nukes for fun. I call it "Nuclear Proliferation".
---
Lol 
---
still sounds amazing
---
Finish wastelanders quests. Any weapon or armor bought with bullion will be legendary except power armor and under armor(as per everyone confirming from this post)
---
How do you skin a rifle? Do you cut along the mag-well and peel both ends off like a shirt and pants or do you start at the butt and work your way down to the muzzle all in one piece?  Personally I like the shirt and pants method as it tends to damage the meat less but I can see why a trophy hunter would want an intact rifle skin for a rug.
---
/s. 
---
I use a fixer and I want skins!
---
Even 1 point in adamantium is life. High recommendation from here also
---
You said you played FO4, yet was unaware that AP use in PA drains the Fusion Core?
---
Without compensating perks, any AP use will drain core fast, and general wandering will drain core, though slower.
---
It's good as long as I have stims and on my stealth I can do all 3, and I did
---
I mean No chance to even look at his stuff.
---
I haven't yet and im at over 200hrs but I have a hard time with the silos. You'll figure it out when ya get there. Spoiler:
---
Lots of robots
---
Lol I’m the same way I’ll say “alright y’all I’m fixing to go grab that three star down yonder there.” And then I get responses like, “ wait you found a fixer!? Bro where!?”
---
Don’t forget well rested!
---
Full Charge(2) will remove drain from all walking movement, not jumping or Power attacks.
---
Explosives and guerrilla (read: automatic pistols) weapons are the two groups that need a buff. Explosives because they just can’t do the damage unless you can spam them at an incredibly fast rate (spoiler: not even the auto grenade launcher can’t, though it’ll do against low level hordes), and guerrilla because there is exactly one unique weapon for the class, and it’s the anti-scorched training pistol, one of the worst weapons in the game.
---
I'll send FR, my name is the same. I'm more commando shotgun, but I think I have heavy bloodies on my mule. I do have a a fun B +10WA +50DRWA handmade I would be happy to hook you up with. As for the heavies I think I have a nice lmg or plasma Gatling (non explosive sorry)
---
I like that, is PVP still broken or does it not happen on the adventure server? When we played I kept getting 1 shotted by lvl 10s
---
Or provide applicable weapons the buff they deserve...broken record....
---
This games just a grind and buggy
---
To me MODUS sounds just like DIMA from Far Harbor. The Fallout 4 DLC in case anyone doesn't know
---
Will do
---
That was my first and haven’t gone back since. I am close to 100 now and may revisit it again soon.
---
Emote: Robot, Finger Guns, Come on. I’m that order Or I’m not showing up. /s
---
I like that!
---
That’s funny, because ever since the plague reared its ugly head, my toon’s been rocking the Veil always in a kind of solidarity with real world me. That way, when I’m out and about in real life I can just pretend to be her and it sucks slightly less.
---
This was my experience last night. Got a lot of long range shots on VATs with no problem and then couldn't land any hits on some wild dogs that were right on me.
---
I don't use gun-fu either. At the moment I'm not even using bloody mess. I still one shot most things.
---
I agree with the waiting till more players are there but I disagree with the 150+ thing there are plenty of players at level 50-100 that literally either made a new character or already know how everything works and can get the same exact god role you have. That's my two cents. I'm keeping the nickel.
---
Is that the big boom stick?
---
Can't wait till the x02 hits the atom shop
---
Yes, I am on Xbox.   GT is Wolfster.  I always show as offline,  but send me a message and I will give you a tour. 😁
---
(Incidentally,  I had to place my C.A.M.P module about 4 stories up into the tree to achieve this. )
---
Lol to much work for all that.
---
Anything New Vegas gets automatic upvote.
---
You can't nuke most of the forest. I think that spot is included. But here is a good link to know where to nuke https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY
---
What niches would you recommend? I’ve been playing tarkov so my vendorable items list for FO76 is null,
---
He's also a crazy hypocrite who harps on people then copyright strikes response videos.
---
I remeber reading everything carried over, but I have yet to see the clock plans. Nonetheless, the responder bot still spawns east/ south-east of Flatwoods. I'm not sure about the other locations.
---
I definitely did not get awarded the points at any point.
---
Prime Automatic receiver exists.
---
The other day I was just wandering somewhere (maybe the Divide?) and a mothman popped up and scared the shit out of me. I actually yelled out loud, and then poof! He was gone.
---
I had this same thing happen on Xbox last week. I actually missed the first Queen because I waited until Scorched Earth was 2 minutes old before fast travelling in.
---
That's awesome, thank you.  
---
My second character, I've been saving the encrypted challenge for a server that can handle it.   
---
My first character failed it's encrypted challenge.  
---
Maybe you would want to help me do encrypted?   My second character is the stealth sniper that would probably be better suited to go bloodied and use a handmade anyway.
---
Was probably just buying cheapest item to fulfill the daily for buying 3 items lol
---
Very nice. Reminds me of Red Faction.
---
Technically, we had the double 10K repeatable last week with the double XP event.
---
I never see crafting mats for flux in vendors. I would buy them right away. I started putting hardened mass in my vendor and it’s rarely purchased. Flowing mass and high rad fluids are my need too.
---
I literally can only share one of two perk cards.  Either 1st level One Gun Army or 1st level Blocker.  I share Blocker because who doesn't want 15% less damage when those enemies be back slapping your bitch ass.
---
The sound of the caps leaving when fast travel actually works after failing numerous times.
---
Sorry if my post is all over the place..I want to know if a semi auto version of scorched killer or prime exist or do I need to make the change to commando and run full auto instead of semi
---
If your gonna claim workshops, stay crouched it keeps you off the map making you much less of an easy target.
---
Buddy possibly put 2 and 2 together watching you walk to the next workshop and gained another kill because of it.
---
And as far as reasource gathering at workshops, outside of maybe hemlock / muntions factory you can gather much faster and more diverse junk by adventuring.
---
Workshops are basically ran two ways, either sneaky AF for exp/loot or balls out getting gud for pvp.
---
But if your showing on the map in your owned workshop, you might aswell have a 200 cap bounty on your head, cuz sooner or later someone will come to collect.
---
Yeah, but never hurts to have another player there.
---
Then fucking make a new fucking character and do it in ten fucking minutes.
---
continue on with your jihads. islam fucking sucks just like every other religion. stop being a cry baby
---
you're gonna need better bait
---
That's the weird thing. It wasn't the cheapest thing, I had plenty of 1 cap ammo.
---
They also purchased some 40mm grenades, so I guess they were running an explosives build?
---
Prime semi-auto plans can drop from the sbq and other sb’s.
---
I don’t know about the scorched killer
---
I don't enjoy it, and it sucks it had to be a daily in the double score weekend, since it already happened a bunch of times lately, like every other day.
---
Play something else you racist ass hole
---
Hey if you don't mind me asking.... Can I have your stuff?
---
Dafuq?
---
The focal point of saving the world is obviously nuking bats.
---
Unfortunately, you an take every known precaution and still get boned. Happened to me.
---
If you feel that strongly about it, why not actually contact Bethesda?
---
This a super good idea
---
Interesting.  I forgot about the mechanic to claim using build mode, I keep trying to do it while there are enemies in range and it switches to third person. I guess I can keep trying to use the workbench, and if it gives me the warning and cap price to claim I can cancel out, then move to the edge and use build mode to claim like you suggested.  Thanks for the tip!
---
I would be happy if legendaries automatically were placed in my inventory. I also would be happy with a system like Diablo, place a star on my map, or even a beam of light straight up. Basically I’ll take anything to stop searching through every pile or body to find the legendaries.
---
I learned how to land her 100% of the time. No glitch. No bait. Just two simple perk card switches. Man it feels good to do some research :)
---
All it takes is teamwork
---
This isn't racism.
---
It is xenophobia, at best.
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah, it’s not just Fallout 4. The AI in Fallout 3 was better. Love 76 but this part needs some help.
---
Bye
---
Thank you I'll keep farming/looking for that then
---
This awnser was giving by Demo 5. Gang.
---
Platform?
---
Love these moments
---
If you bought the red rocket set it's in the same place In camp menu just need to scroll through the individual  items
---
Lol you and me both...its functional at least, though I won't win any awards for it.
---
I did. I also started a Go Fund Me for the legal defence fund.
---
I know right?  They had 2 silos prepped and ready to go, with other players outside taking workshops and forcing PVP.  Lots of coordination for a questionable payoff.  I need a better response that just ignoring them... maybe drop a bag of fertilizer with a "you have been insulted" note?
---
It’s a variant of the original bar I believe
---
I looked it up, and it turns out they did rig up some mini nukes to blow up instead of lobbing them at the dam. Still, the mini mukes really shouldn't be this weak gameplay-wise, especially considering how much they're hyped up
---
I'll give you the handmade but I don't know if you want any of these heavies (not to special). Feel free to choose one if you want. B .50 Cal 1star B Ultracite Gatling +50 crit 2star, B +50LD VCMF+15 minigun, B 1* plasma Gatling. 
---
Let me know because I don't want all of these on my main character. And I'll meet up with you do an imposter no problem.
---
Yep. I've always assumed I was safe since I waited until getting home from work. Can't say that anymore.
---
[Hell no.....](https://imgur.com/DmPzV1s)
---
Its cool seeing gunners take cover on things , mive more cautiously when their health is low. And so on
---
I don't pay much attention to what people share and have no real preference. I would prefer goat legs be shared (I'm clumsy and overestimate the distance I can safely fall lol) but that doesn't seem to be a popular one. I am usually sharing reduced armor weight perk, bc my friend needs that and I play with him every day. I don't change it when on public teams if he's not there because it doesn't occur to me and/or I can't be bothered to guess what randoms might want. If someone messages me asking for something else, I'd be happy to change it though.
---
Yeah, I think it was a PVP player who got me last night. I was no where near either of those two locations and was just trying to complete the "Claim Workshop" quest. As I said in the Original post, it's not a common occurrence, but it has been happening more often than I'd like to admit.
---
Maybe I just need to Git Gud or buy Fallout 1st so this doesn't become an issue. If that isn't Bethesda's free marketing team, I don't know what is.
---
You don’t need the /s. This is absolute proof they do not give two flying fucks about the player base.
---
Unfortunately you are right
---
this from the guy bragging about soloing Encryptid.
---
The "Your A Dum***" Note works too
---
Shout out to that one time I opened the door to the building you go into for technical data for the first time and got jumped by a ghoul that got trapped behind the door.
---
That's sad.  There are other games to play with better PVP mechanics.  If I ever get bored after grinding out the legendary run and maxing settler rep (already maxed on raiders), I'll just move on to by back catalogue of other games rather than try to piss off other players.
---
At the very least they can be converted into ammo points for ammo you want with the converter (missles atleast i know, didn't check if mini nukes can be converted too)
---
Xbox
---
Oh thank you so much maybe now the PVP griefers will know to stay away
---
I've got at least 80 atoms just hanging there because of this.
---
Oh. From scaling perspective, it's smarter to create sets of servers for each region and bind users to them. Google "CDN" as a search term. This means your PC/console is connected to the closest server, hence Europeans play on European servers, Asians on Asian servers and so on.
---
As of time, well, it is also a factor, but less important one.
---
I just logged in. Was able to complete all the dailies in 30 minutes. Got 4,500 score and completed a weekly for a total of 5,500 score. Got 2 ranks. 
---
The legendary tin is not a real grind for a lot of players. Just some who are entitled and literally object to everything.
---
Been scared a lot and by a lot of things but the thing that freaked me out the most was the first time I got killed for a bounty.  I was in my little piece of crap cabin, I guess I had forgotten about the bounty it and I was getting ready to scrap some stuff when I heard the shot fire and my character dies.  It was night, never saw it coming, and my door was closed but it's that door with broken window.  It startled the hell out of me.
---
Killing three players is a huge requirement to take away a full daily and only give 100 score in return, it'd be a huge handicap for most players. Not everyone enjoys or is good at PvP games, especially broken ones.
---
Survive for x minutes is way more suited to be a repeatable, although I'd still rather not have a NW daily at all, and give the mode its own content ratger than bundle it with Adventure stuff.
---
I'm not saying gun fu is a bad perk, but some people prefer not to have it shared. That other thread mentions it makes them lag too.
---
I have my camp near there. At this point the screaming is just as much background noise as the radio and Sofia's endless chatter
---
Genius, why didnt I think about this one. Oh yeah cause apparently adhesive, aluminum and a few others have no value and the value in the item stats isn't always what is used by other players.
---
I dont know if you where trying to help or be funny.
---
It's good to see another member.
---
Ooo where is that one at?  Might need to start farming it daily
---
Wait are you on xbox?
---
I would rather only do one bloodied character and keep the other one normal.  
---
Bloodied Stealth Sniper has a nice ring to it.   Do you think it would be effective? 
---
Also I'll give you bullets and fusion cores.  Just let me know what I can give.   I have some ultracite 5.56 and ultracite fusion cores if you want them.  I have lots of inert flux on my main character.
---
Thankyou! And someone or some people made a map of its spawns, among many other things. Just give it a google if you need it
---
Its about the xp idc about the loot...
---
Yeah I was scrolling and was like "now wait a minute.."
---
I'm pretty lazy though and if someone does share I wont kick them or find a new group I'll just deal. But I read people get lag from the auto switch so that's something to be considerate about.
---
The first two of these I worked on them on my level 70, and yes they suck if you want to do them fast.  Even with a win or 2 it takes 4-5 games to rank up at that level.
---
What I did was I used my second character which was level 0, played through 1 game and went to level 5.
---
The best thing to do is just start a new character and survive as long as possible, you need next to no exp for the first few levels.

I didnt know there were mods that gave BF

I get all mine mostly from military bags, military duct tape or when im starting out a new toon  just straight up buy it off vendors
---
-edit: spelling
---
Actually wasnt to bad to do it solo I'll post my build and gear later gonna jump on ps4 and do some final fantasy 7 remake for a bit

Is this why the nuke zone looked about triple the normal size, covering most of Watoga?

Selling to robot Vendors: Glowing meat, bloodpacks = max caps 
---
My vending machines: fuel, arrows, 5.56, 5mm, .45 .. And fusion cores if decide to sell a few I sell out of my inventory almost every day... ammo 1 cap each fusion cores I price at the charge level.

I'm working on a novel....please to enjoy.
---
I think this is a solid direction. I’m fine with there being a NW daily, but it should be worth a bit more and actually require engagement in the mode, not nonsense like putting a CAMP down 3 times. I was short on time last night, so I loaded in alone, dropped my CAMP 3 times and dipped out. What’s the point of that? 
---
Make the daily a challenge; kill a player (this is tough for a lot of players, myself included), do “X” damage to players, revive a teammate, survive “X” minutes while teammates are nearby (no AFK, gotta stay with your team). 
---
Then also add a repeatable so people who want to do NW have an incentive to do so. 
---
Kill a player: 50 SCORE 
---
Do 1000 damage to players: 50 SCORE
---
Win a match: 100 SCORE
---
All of those things would encourage actual engagement with the game mode and maybe actually show some new people that it can be a fun change of pace.
---
It’s technically an invisible sphere. So it would have to change to a cube which would significantly increase the camp space. Would be cool though.
---
You have nine dailies up from 7. You can ignore NW and still finish
---
I think it might be a rare drop from the colossus. idk i am just assuming
---
You can lose a little status. I once picked an answer to a raider they didn’t like and it went down a smidge.
---
It’s hard to do it. But it can happen. 
---
But certainly not by ever killing raiders or settlers. Lol
---
I've learned a lot while playing this character. I do well in stealth/range combat. I'm not one for building up one of them and sitting around for hours.
---
holy cow ....   awesome
---
"not or no longer needed or useful; superfluous."
---
I think i did. Or am I missing something?
---
Crazy, yeah they must be! How rare, i never sell can any of that stuff lol
---
that's awesome too!
---
I like mine alot it really packs a punch
---
I went the other direction.  I use rank 1 of the rifleman/commando cards instead of rank 3, and run Lifegiver and adrenaline (when they fix it).  Leaves me lots of points in agility and endurance to play with.  I still do hella damage, not concerned with the numbers on the screen as much as how much fun I have.
---
Food build is an insult from bloodied. Means you rely on food buffs and full health. You on ps4? Friend with a private world can let you in. Hi ill be a friend. Ps4
---
I hardly noticed. I chopped it up to being a bigger game. Like npc pathing seems a bit broken but with CAMP almost anywhere I figure that's hard to code. What I did notice though is the qol changes from 4 to 76 and it makes it hard for me to go back to 4
---
You literally just said no one has over rank 80 without buying or glitching xp.
---
I play the banjo. I wish there was a relevant pose for just sitting with an instrument; I'd play over voice chat.
---
I'm good, I would go with the handmade. It does crazy damage if you ADS. I have none bloodied weapons I use too and with the bloodied perks they destroy everything. The key is the armor, do you have a complete Unyelding set?
---
I prefer to run Encryptid Solo - other players usually screw things up.
---
[Solo Encryptid - Gauss Minigun version](https://youtu.be/HTZMHMd1wBs)
---
You can loose status, but i dont think you can after you have done The main story
---
Upvoting just for the Winnie the Pooh's asshole quote, and also i think a dead body marker would be great, maybe even a highlight silhouette kinda like containers in outer worlds
---
Say it to the mighty HANDMADE!
---
Having it as a weekly challenge is a pretty good idea honestly. I know you can make a new character but some of us actually like NW and don't want to devote time to ranking up a throw away character.
---
I know it’s very difficult to make a nuke detonate in the real world but, how dope would it be if you chuck mini nukes and shoot them midair or once they landed the way you can shoot mines
---
Yeah the ranks from 60 to 80 takes more score than from 0 to 60. I highly doubt its possible without atoms or exploit
---
you are angry because you can't read and understand what the fuck bethesda write and tell you . Yes please first unistall game second learn how to read with kids at kindergarten It will be very helpfull in your life lmao you guys are just joke
---
I think they ment if it can drop a rank and I dont think it can. I mean if you buy everything from them then status dont mean nothing anyways.. for now.
---
BE pipe rifles are excellent......I say this as a 500+.....they do half the damage of a handmade of course but that’s with .38 ammo which is otherwise useless. People practically give that away so it’s cheap to run.  I regularly clear out Westek / Harper’s Ferry with a similar one.
---
Gauss shotgun is the fallout 76 of guns. 
---
I can one shot a level 91 glowing deathclaw and then take 3 shots to kill the level 32 ant it was fighting. I can miss something that i could literally spit on and then hit something in the distance with 0% chance that is behind a tree.
---
Add in 1 gun fu. Game changer!
---
Oh no. That seems like you couldn’t do that
---
It would be redundant if there was no benifit to doing more damage but killing bosses faster always has a place
---
Yeah fallout 76 has a better legendary system and the perk system for fo76 is alot nicer as well. The base building is more aesthetically pleasing in fo76 as well.
---
Well that largely depends on what you gather.  I sell primarily plans ive gathered.  The best selling stuff seems to be Bivs alcohol recipes.  I also sell all the ammo I dont use for 1 cap per.  Serums as well, for 300-400 per depending on the mutation.  On the buying side,  I always buy junk from players.
---
That's not true, you can open up a comic book or grocery store and be afk at your camp for three hours.
---
They can’t fix it. It’s been like this from day 1. It’s a battle they will never win. That’s how they built the game.
---
My second character is at 49. So I'd be just beginning the building process as far as gear.  I see unyielding armor out there though.  Seems far easier to aquire than bloodied weapons.  
---
At least that character already has nerd rage and radiation perks though.   My main character is just built to be a tank.
---
It would be really cool to have two polar opposite builds.
---
Wish I was there. I love the lunch boxes side effects. Wish there was a way to get those without the boxes. Maybe when they redo how food works we can get some fun buffs that dont do anything except cosmetic things
---
Ps: it tried to autocorrect buffs to bugs and that would of been funny too.
---
Any second/third perks you'd say improve it?
---
Depends what you like. I've moved so many times, but I'm happy where I at the moment in the hills by a lake
---
They can but it's like 2 or 3 at a time. So 6 to 9 points of weight.
---
Not that particular problem but yes, not getting the scrap it said I was.
---
You need calibrated shocks to boost your weight in pa. You get mods for the x01 from modus. You can buy the plans or server hop looking for the box mods (would not recommend)
---
This is exactly what I have found! When it works well it's really fun, when it doesn't work well... I die haha
---
You can't fast travel while taking damage. I got trapped for the first time yesterday. That was the first thing I tried.
---
Mine doesnt seem to do anything much, are you perked for damage on it too?
---
What ever perk card you can that's won't mess with people's rads
---
Excavator is the only PA with an inherent carry weight boost. Otherwise you need calibrated shocks for the legs which is a mod you can get for all types of PA.
---
ETA: X01 PA mods can be purchased through Modus in the Whitespring Bunker.
---
yes I am
---
I'll add that after you gather the first 40, they respawn but very slowly.  The returns are diminishing once you hit 40.  I usually swap to tagging ghouls once I've gathered the initial wave of ore instead of farting around looking for the odd few that may have respawned.
---
I'm not angry or at least I wasn't until jerks like you come and say stupid shit like this. You tell me I should learn to read while you yourself can not read(or write, looking at your comment). There is no sentence such as "I'm angry" at my post. I just said I'm disappointed. Disappointed is an synonymous with angry my idiot friend.
---
I'd love to see an auto-drop feature that behaves similar to junk components' "tag for search". Just mark any unwanted items in your inventory, and a trash can icon appears next to them, indicating they'll immediately drop to the floor instead.
---
You miss the point, I want to play nuclear winter and not feel like I'm missing out on XP grinding
---
Cool

Yeah, really, lol.  Oh look, 3 legendaries, a level and 15 ghouls.  2 minutes later the golf course is clear and 3 challenges done.  Man, I'm soooo burnt ouuuuuuuut.
---
I'm inoculated but upvote for awareness. I still wear a mask anyways because I could be carrying it still!

---

---
Wait, what's not true?  There are no more games, only Fallout 76?  Shit, I waited too long to play my back catalog...
---
I see what you mean but it was still used in the right sense, maybe not perfectly but still got its point across. But I touched on that point later by saying it can be useless on a boss type character because of the sustained damage and not jumping back and forth between  targets
---
Honestly I get that.  At this point I'm just trying to unlock all of the perks, including leveling up the Perk Ranks.
---
Take a set of excavator pa to lucky hole mine and gather all the led ore. 
---
Server hop at toxic Larry's or tangler Town and farm mobs for acid
---
Do collision course for cloth 
---
Go to West tek or Blackwater mine, kill everything and grab the gear. Break it down using scrapper.
---
Make tons of ammo
---
Try having a ready made melee build or another gun type to run down ammo on that. It's always good to have another bullet typed gun so you can seesaw your ammo when playing
---
I’ll buy them
---
I have lots a flux yo
---
Agreed, if op is talking about the pre fabricated box mods, it could be a visual glitch.  I haven't noticed any of the box mods offer Ballistic Fiber (I could be wrong).  BTW military dict tape gives a completely new meaning 👍
---
Ok fair
---
Bruh you need to get a hobby

---
I havent used atoms to rank but I've know people who have. The pa skin plays a jingle when its put on and now I want it
---
I know right?  The xbox is cool
---
Is it just me or do the buttons on the shirt look like nipples?
---
Yeah I get that, but you shouldn't need to make a new character to complete an score challenge.  It should just be a more reasonable challenge.
---
they could just give us the materials to make them, if they really wanted us to have this
---
Until they fix the 2mm ammo crafting (I’m not holding my breath for that), I pretty much just use my GMG for the SBQ. Otherwise, I run with a .50 for my everyday gun.
---
Yeah it is weird I have a pc and the xbox just keeps bringing me back
---
They do for sure lol
---
Lucky mine hole for lead, use excavator power armor  and smash that gather button.
---
Uranium Fever for steel, take everything from the mole miners and scrap it before you leave.
---
.45 I believe is use on the fixers so they are really hard to come by. I normally sell them at my vendors for 3 caps a piece and they are gone pretty much as soon as I put them on.
---
Yep, this game has some epic moments that keep me coming back. Last night, loaded into a game where I had just missed the SBQ fun. I went farming in the zone. I came upon the Wendigo Colossus. I was all alone, everyone else had left the zone. It was the last thing I expected to find. I use the come here emote in the faint hopes my team would see where I was at on the map, understand, and join in. Pretty soon, I had a couple of team mates at my side. As we all are burning through ammo supplies, I see a nuke warning. I think, we’ll, at least I go down fighting. Then nothing happens and we keep fighting. A bit later, a second nuke warning. Again, no fiery death. After the fight, I check the map and see two nuke zones far away from Fissure Prime. I’d like to think those nuke keycard holders showed a bit of mercy to the handful of us in the grove. One of my best moments in this game.
---
Absolutely not. I have 1 Str and use it for Bandolier. Lol. Make sure your rate of fire is over 190 (I think) and the gun has a magic qualifier. My minigun runs 225 fire rate.
---
I don't even use Stabilized. I get in her face so I don't have to be accurate.
---
I can relate!
---
I'm an ore grabber, but I'm torn whether I should deposit early allowing the ghouls to respawn for the XP guys, or hold onto it and make the event go smoother.  Right now, I deposit it only if my load can complete the event or if the timer is under 30 seconds.  What do you guys prefer?  Curious what the consensus is.
---
sorry man learn how to read than you won't be dissapointed you are literally disapointed because you can't understand what the fuck they write
---
Yeah, that is what I did, but it's an obvious flaw in the system when you have to make a new character to get 250 score.  It's a clear sign of a bad challenge.
---
Thank you so much
---
I'm only loyal to Yes Man. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Maybe instead of only having circle/square would should be able to choose square or circle

Did you use the converter, the exchange rate sucks but I turn all my .38’s into .308’s for my machine gun.
---
Thank you man
---
Missiles are no incentive for 1st.
---
Thank you! Your efforts are appreciated!
---
I was hoping the challenge would complete with the Level up we get from picking the cards inside the vault, unfortunately they took the possible exploit into consideration and patched it out, so I actually ended up learning how to efficiently grind XP, and now at lv 260+ it takes about half an hour if casual playing (not hard grind) ro get one level.
---
Since it looks like the requirements for Legendary Perks are not going to become reasonable and I waited before respec so I'll waste a lot of those level ups on not-coins, leveling up efficiently is really an important skill to learn in this game.
---
I never understood why the camp system isn't like Ark!  It's so easy and comfortable to build camps in ark and the screen doesn't move.  I get motion sick trying to build in 76.
---
I have to quit and come back to it after 15 minutes
---
Yeah I'm honestly thinking of skipping it today. Makes me sad that it's during a double. It's just a bit of a pain haha
---
I just don’t want to worry about the score stuff.  Rather drop a few bucks and get all the stuff I wanted and play how I like.  It’s like $5 a week per season.
---
Be sure to throw in some toilet paper to be safe!
---
Thanks so much for the tips!   I'm still pretty new at bloodied.  I wonder why Radaway kills at very low health.   Any ideas?
---
I have several mutations, but not Scaly Skin.   Will definitely look at that.
---
Then I'm not much of a Food Build. As I'm never at full health, I sort of Pseudo-class right with my rads sitting around half, with a full damage perk load out. Plus, I hardly use food other than Canned Dog Food/Cannibal and Nuka-Cola perks to keep my bars topped. Canned Coffee is pretty easy to come by too in a pinch.
---
Sadly, No. I'm on PC. Wish the game was Cross-platform or at least Cross-save like Destiny 2.
---
I've read that some people think the market has improved. Ammo is 1 cap each, guns aren't 5 digit cap prices, etc.
---
So instead of carrying one good prefix weapon that is effective for all enemies as we do now, we would have to carry several weapons for each different type of enemy. Stupid idea. There will always ge good/best prefix and bunch of not so good ones. Deal with it.
---
Right??  I really don't get the opposition lol I figured even the PVE players were sick of having to go and kill creatures or struggle for revives, this r/fo76 community is so trash
---
I've yet to see anyone with this in person. Any pics of the infamous butt-flap?
---
No problem, I'll take any .45 round you want to spare. I really don't expect anything. I was saving all of this for trades for my two favorites, thanks to the d00p I traded fuel of all things for my babies. So now I have a stock pile of things to hand out. I'm retired from trading guns, I'm happy to just play. Send me PSN message when you on I'll help out.
---
I had a two-shot fat man I was using for one of the combat challenges for killing ghouls. 
---
I had to shoot multiple times on some of them, and I was in the beginning area with level 1 ghouls. I couldn’t believe my eyes.. I knew they sucked, but come on!
---
Edit: I also noticed during the faschnat (sp) events that the weight of the fired mini nuke would be shown as taken from my weight, but it would still be applied. I noticed this because they are needlessly heavy and would over-encumber me. After shooting them and dropping under my weight limit I would still be too heavy.
---
Lot of people I know who recieved dupes got banned  and some people got banned for false flags so its worrisome.
---
Sorry I stopped playing that quest, still play the game
---
You do know you don't have to do them yeah?
---
Even though its bugs and exploits, I still love and appreciate these cool camps.
---
You shouldn't need prime ammo unless fighting a boss, and if you are fighting one you should consider a gun with a high yield of prime ammo to cost such as the ultracite gatling laser or to a lesser extent a minigun, 50. cal or gatling gun.
---
I honestly wish there were more NW challenges, as I enjoy playing it.   They could just max it gain XP in NW per week.
---
If your not into pvp, just pull the sneaky route. Getting gud just amounts to having the proper gear/perks and weapons in 76, skill isnt a big game changer as proper armour. Even if you can solo the SBQ, a properly geared pvp will walk over you.
---
I been around since launch and claim a workshop almost every play session in a public server and been killed less than 5 times due to workshops. But I mostly play on a Vats sniper so Im always crouched, so that might help a ton.
---
Sneaky is the way to go. Also try to avoid defend events, if you let the defend event fail, you will get a retake mission which is sometimes easier, plus during a retake event, another player cant contest the workshop until all enemies are killed.
---
Which can give you some breathing room and reduce the chance some mouth breather is gonna k0 you while your dealing with mobs during the defend event.
---
I wholeheartedly agree! How epic it would be to be a bard amongst the fray of a SBQ fight, granting bonuses and playing a tune that fuels the fight! Additionally, quests like One Violent Night may be much more manageable in smaller groups.
---
See despite what the internet and people think, its possible to have a mature discussion on something. So thank you for that.

---
My Gauss shotgun is deadly in VATS at medium range, say 25-50 meters, but at short range will sometimes either hit, or hit for no damage. My pump action is a guaranteed one-hit kill at short ranges, so long as I let the VATS chance get to 95%. And my Handmade almost never misses.
---
It seems like Gauss weapons do really poorly in VATS. I think it has something to do with the combo of calculating the charged damage.
---
Wait so we this isnt just regular foreplay
---
When the game first came out I built a 1h melee build that could kill anything in one hit, Then 1h melee was so broken that my hits didnt register and when it did, the health would go down, then back up half of what id hit. I then spent another 20 levels rebuilding my guy into a SMG/Vats build, and wouldn't you know, that broke after a patch too. I thought 'Like fuck am i rebuilding my guy again' and fucked the game off completely. I've been watching this sub to see if its been fixed, and clearly it hasnt. Maybe one day Ill log back in, But im not holding my breath.
---
No, because dailies will still be 9, and instead of a 250 challenge that is a PITA but still completable most days (the only one I haven't completed is the rank up one), we go to a challenge that 99% of the times not doable and awards less atoms the one time one actually gets the amount of effort in to complete it.
---
Extreme lose-lose scenario, especially when flying aimbots with unlimited ammo continue to exist unpunished.
---
LOL I never do that quest any more.  I also don't like the one where you have to gather air/soil/water holotapes.  Crap rewards for too much traveling/walking.
---
I also don't do the NW ones, not because I hate NW but because I have to spend time removing my mods and virginizing my .ini
---
Missile Launcher and Mini Nuke should be buffed.
---
 Mini Nuke ammo should then be rare as hell. Everyone should hoard them for VATS critting SQB in the head, and it should actually do a significant amount of damage to her. We already have people 1-2 shotting her, so buffing a weapon that absolutely should do a lot of damage makes sense.
---
Am I work right now so I can't  but I think i have a clip of me just strolling through the forest near toxic valley and suddenly mothman was in my face.
---
The extra dailies are great, but unfortunately they don't even let you complete 1 level a day. If you could complete 1 level every day that would be good.
---
In the four weeks this had been going on, couldn’t the devs have made the tool needed to give score to those affected by now?
---
&gt; gain XP in NW per week
---
Adventure mode has a repeatable for gaining XP like this, the fact that NW doesn't is pretty bullshit if you ask me. XP from NW doesn't even count towards that repeatable.
---
Award ammo points for the converter instead.
---
I used to game on PC in what seems like another lifetime ago.  Nowadays it's "wait until everyone else is asleep, pull my couch 5 feet away from the TV and stay up until 2 in the morning nuking SBQ".  If you play FO76 on Xbox, I'd suggest getting a cheap SSD (I found one $35 on Amazon) and move the game installation over to that.  Load times have dropped SIGNIFICANTLY, especially when fast traveling.  30-45 seconds becomes 5-10 seconds.  Worth every penny.
---
Aaaand? I misread one thing and became public enemy number one for you so can't even write a comment in a civilized way? Or is just where you come from? Are you living in Fucktown of Fuckotopia so you got taught at elementary school to never say anything without including the proud name of your great home town or country to never forget where you come from you fucktard?
---
Actually, yes.
---
Gonna admit didn't think it would be that obvious.
---
I did this once before I had a good gatling plasma. VATS critted her dome and got one of the final shots in.

I Wonder if a Drill will do enough damage to not kill them?
---
I'm assuming that's a vampires gauss mini, wish you had damage numbers on tho
---
Yeah, I was kind of debating with myself about it. I knew it was bit of a tricky thing. In the case where the circle is inscribed in the square though, the square would give more space right?
---
I believe the build area is a cylinder based on what others have reported and built. If we encase that in a box, we should get more space right? Versus, making it a box within the cylinder?
---
I must admit, I have and do explore a bit, albeit more infrequently these days, but I would DEFINTELY explore and just wander more if I could do it whilst playing an instrument or something. 
---
Could have pied piper perk cards and everything, ones for a bigger following, one for bigger creatures, whatever. Imagine a merry jaunt past someones camp with a line of opossums or radrats behind you... Or at the top end a gang of Deathclaws :D

Then more people joining in and before you know it, you're a band of 4 with a mismatch of rats, bloatflies, whatever tagging along.

---
CAT? oh hell no
---
I need to make that video - good suggestion.
---
Yeah its a Vampires FFR FR
---
This.  And make sure you have concentrated fire.
---
Right now, everyone goes for one of two main weapon types: Bloodied or Junkies, with a third depending if they're not running one of those meta builds, like Furious.
---
Two Shot was nerfed, but it was the one people went for who didn't run Bloodied or Junkies builds.
---
Slayer weapons are extremely situational and the +30% damage increase doesn't at all reflect the potency of what a primary legendary effect should be.
---
I do think that people would start trying to use and collect specific slayer weapons, but I don't see that as a negative.
---
I like mini nukes. Can you try to not speak for everyone? Thanks.
---
Can confirm. Also, even if you do the whole questline, you can still gain rep for both factions. However, my advice is to go through both questlines, there will be a fairly clear "point of no return" when you have to pick one faction. This is more advisable, since the questlines give massive boosts to Rep compared to being stuck doing just dailies, and you do take a little hit to rep with the faction that you don't choose, but this is pretty easy to even out after a couple days' worth of dailies.
---

You could always smash things with a guitar sword and call yourself a bard build.

---
Yeah. That’s what I did, but I noticed after I finished it, I got bullion from doing events when I could have been getting them all along. Probably didn’t finish it until level 90~ 
---
Plus the alignment grind
---
I don't care how stupid it looks, we should be able to play our guitar swords, war drums and death tambos wherever and whenever
---
I rolled a Bloodied on my 3rd try will all my perks is doing over 2100 damage per shot.
---
I have found similar results with it. It's a sometimes weapon, no matter what vats % you have it sometimes hits and sometimes misses.
---
I have had far much better results hip firing at close range targets and using vats on distant ones.
---
Okay, Mothman Cultist
---
Turn people into accidental cannibals.
---
See that's where I messed up, I'm not a sneaky build. I mainly go Pseudo-Bloodied Shotgun/Heavy build most of the time. So I'd have to swap all my SPECIAL around to get that.
---
Also, I didn't know that the Retake event was a Uncontestable by another player until all the enemies were taken care of. Just another mechanic that is unexplained I guess. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Lol got a few anti armor ffrs so far, been trying to get a junkies version, last night I got 2 ghoul slayers with bash damage both 2 star I was very disappointed and was wondering the odds

This has got to be the most stupid daily there is. Lots of traveling across the map, spending time following the targets, taking off all your damage perks etc and the reward for the time spend is just 4 scrip. Only daily i NEVER do.
---
Well, not a bad idea. They have to tweak Zealots a tiny bit (it should not work on scorchbeasts, only on scorcheds), but it is a good idea.
---
You willing to part with any holotape games? That's the only reason I hunt down magazines
---
Yeah exactly this. If you have a team of 3, you could do it. 2 watch one gathers then swap. Not saying it would be easy, just saying it’s possible.
---
I just sent you a message but I barely know how to use PS message.     Can I send you Reddit messages instead?
---
(vox squirrel)
---
(squirrel dies... change server... you must now Vox an opossum... opossum dies...)
---
(turns off game, goes outside, yells at sun)
---
With quest system they just need to pop off 5 days of quests where you shoot 3 fat men. Then they are masterfully depleted, then buff n make rare.
---
Probably no-one, I just thought it was funny when I realized i got my perk card pack back after crashing out of a server, only to open it to get different cards - I did have to re-scrap all the weapons I was in the middle of scrapping after uranium fever though -  which was mildly inconvenient.
---
I get it - being able to show off things that other people can't have feels good, but business wise it's a poor practice. 
---
If you make it exclusive to a difficult event then you alienate a number of your regular more casual players because they can't ever complete the event.
---
If you then sell said items to try and cash in on the fact players wanted them, you piss off those players who did have the time to devote to playing the event and want it to remain exclusive to them only...it also means next time those players won't bother as much knowing it won't remain exclusive.
---
Ultimately events (totally IMHO from seeing them in many games) should serve to promote the community, push up player numbers and rewards the player base for playing the game...a bit of community good will. 
---
If they want to tie it to a competition then they could just make it a giant E-Peen and attach it to a PVP tournie.
---
I share strange in numbers like everyone else does.
---
&gt;Why do you want to go in nuclear winter for a pain in the ass challenge
---
Because I don't want to pay atoms to beat Zorbo and it's unreasonable to expect people to 110% everything else to be able to barely skip the NW daily.
---
&gt;actual players don't want you on their team to place 3 camps and leave. 
---
I never leave the autofill on, so you don't have to worry about that from me thanks. I still play the game until I get killed, so I don't just leave either.
---
I vot a 4t seagate I load so fast in nw that I have to wait for crates
---
Lol honestly I have yet to do much of anything relating to Mothman in game but I have a feeling it'll be my favorite part.
---
Could be a few items that don’t work. I haven’t paid attention to them all. I usually don’t pre war foods since I make my own. I’ve noticed on some though that they give a percentage when consumed. Probably just another minor bug among the many other ones floating out there.
---
Sure. There is an app for the PS messages (way easier)
---
I think Hunters is what works on Scorchbeast, isn't it?
---
Every so often the pied piper eyebot encounter spawns in front of my camp, with his entourage of rad-rats in tow. It’s always fun to have the lil guys marching around while I’m working on the homestead; it would be much more entertaining with fellow players as stated, though!
---
Toss a cap to your Whisper...
---
(Deacon liked that)
---
Think it's clear they should reduce the weight of these things so maybe people will actually use the weapon itself.
---
I'm of the opposite view from Daemoni73, as I think it's a great idea. I enjoy the planning aspects of my adventure sometimes. If I know I'm heading to the Burrows, for example, I'll take a minute to make sure I have what I need, so in this case my Ghoul Slaying stuff.
---
There's not as much fun if you just have a min/max best-weapon-for-all-things..
---
No, you are. Why make a question post if you're not willing to hear the other side?
---
Best fucking game on the planet xD
---
Nah, they never will. They just investigating what is happening and trying to find the bug. They told us that they never will give the lost scores back, neither atoms to buy ranks that is lost due to the bug.
---
Maybe has to do with server stability? I've only tested it on sbq on public servers and I never see her health chunk on any of my magic weapons. Supposed I'd have to test on a private server.
---
I've got several magic mini guns with two shot, anti armor, and etc all with magic effects also and accelerated barrel for 225 fire rate. I'm just not sure which do the best damage so I lug them all around and give them away to nice people.
---
You should probably talk to them first to make sure they're up for the event. For all you know they didn't even see the notification that encryptid was on.
---
A few days ago, I tried to buy a BE lever action rifle from someone on F76 market. I offered 20k caps, 20k 5.56 rounds (which the seller wanted), someone else offered 45k 5.56 rounds and, some hours later, the seller made a new post with the same title, ended up selling the weapon for 30k rounds to someone who just added it to his super long list of legendaries for sale.
---
That thing will take the dust for god knows how long instead of being sold to people who actually need it to finish their build and that guy will probably make profit out of it. Of course, what he did isn't against any rule and he had every right to do it ... it's just that the whole trading process is dumb. You spend time on tier websites trying to find something you can buy with everything else but the game's currency and, when you reach that currency cap, you have to find alternative way to "bank" your wealth or else you must remove your ingame vendors to avoid losing things for nothing.
---
And the main problem is that finding this weapon by killing legendary enemies is almost impossible ... I reached lvl 150 while doing tons of legendary runs yet I never found a single legendary lever rifle. I'm even starting to wonder if they drop at all and if the only way to get those is to hit the jackpot at the purveyor. For a diablo 2 fan like me who enjoy farming tons of baddies for the best gear, the way F76 is working is just a huge deception. (and, tbh, the anti-armor lever I bought for 800 caps is already doing a great job because of how weak the enemies are anyway)
---
Mostly, they only tend to be self-destructive, atm.
---
Yeah same
---
Yes, nuclear weapons are nothing compared to a nearly dead naked guy with a bloody pointed stick!
---
I know at lvl 95 I still died really quick, but maybe someone about my lvl who went more for a tank build would have better success!  This is certainly one where the more players the better.
---
use the Tinkerer's bench to craft...
---
scrapper (int) perk helps get mats, Ammo perk (agi) and super duper (Luck) to maximize gains
---
You on xbox, it might have been me lol!
---
Give is ammo points or ammo vouchers to use at the ammo vendors at the train stations which are probably rarely used
---
Did emotes and sent messages out the 710 was to busy pvping for some reason. I guess biggest d*co comp
---
I watched a video about this on youtube where someone tested a bunch of different magic heavy weapons and the 50 cal actually seemed to be the fastest and did more damage than a minigun. He didn't use a gauss minigun though.
---
Fortnite and WoW, to name two, seem to be doing well with that business model.
---
With 100% buff, poor SBQ wont last a second. If you want to buff the slayer weapons, we have to prevent those SBQ killer weapons.
---
Only noticed because I loot everything from ghouls on events like radiation  rumble and pick up prewar food. Like someone else mentioned too, dog food still works for me. I keep it as a cnd free food.
---
It's a bit of a stress, but as soon as you click to sign in disconnect your internet then wait a couple secs and reconnect, then when you log in it will work
---
https://youtu.be/h39-GD83SkY. I run one less demo for one more point to run travel agent.. good times! I'm a lil over 2k dmg withe everything up and running
---
Okay, Ricochet now works with normal armor. It didn't last March.
---
Yes, please.
---
That's why I said this:
---
&gt;although I'd still rather not have a NW daily at all, and give the mode its own content ratger than bundle it with Adventure stuff.
---
In my very first comment in this thread. But great job on your reading comprehension skills.
---
Man, that is an excellent idea!
---
I think its the Southern Belle Hotel.  There should be a note on one of the tables
---
You can always give me the anti-armor one. Lol.
---
Perhaps you're right. I don't think it matters much as long as you burn her health down. Any gun that kills her works.
---
Dang thank you for this post. Had no idea we need to know the plan for the weapon to be in the loot pool at ermergerd. Wish I did not know the gamma gun and plasma pistol plans lol I've gotten so many of those. 😤
---
Took 6 days to fix a bug that removed atoms. Mere' hours to fix a bug that gave away atoms.
---
I'm in the lobby now, I see you.   I just want to eat lunch before I start playing.   
---
I'm going to log in as my second character that I want to make a bloody stealth sniper.   
---
My camp for that character sucks, please don't judge me by it.   I am going to build a better camp when I get more plans.
---
I expected this and was excited for it prior to 76 launch. Between that not happening and (imo) the crappy cover songs that exist I was disappointed.
---
I'm actually doing this challenge right now, got another toon who's never done NW chilling in a bush while I watch YouTube and browse reddit, bound to get multiple levels when it dies to the fire.
---
Once I got muh score, gonna go play that new Superhot game.
---
EDIT: Position 6, 3 levels gained, didn't even pickup a damn gun, good game mode.
---
wow, you just conjured up a real cool vision with that.
---
so. of course, it'll never happen.
---
They have to fix the low limit first, but they have said they will
---
Once you are allied your rep is locked
---
Especial legendary ones
---
Nuka grenades are my jam! I won't drink Nuka Cola or Quantum, because they're WAY more useful as explosives, IMHO.
---
What language are you using in game? I noticed that it happens sometimes with non-english localizations, the game simply do not show all the dailies from time to time. Switching to english via the launcher settings might help to resolve this issue in that case.
---
There are a lot of perks I've come to realize I don't need, adrenaline among them. Concentrated fire is nice for vats headshots but I tried removing it entirely and found that my bloody handmade would 1 shot just about anything with one body shot. I usually use a lever gun which does even more damage than the handmade, to boot. Action Boy is another one that I found is entirely useless now.
---
My quad barrell target locking missile launcher says hi, too lol
---
Absolutely. Your point still stands.
---
I care not dont worry I'm afk on an event having some coffee and cigarettes.
---
Challenges auto completing has been happening for months and months. Nothing new there. They are just so damned incompetent.
---
Medical goggles goes well w/mothman gasmask, gasmask w/Goggles. Not found many good combos though
---
Oh then you already know whats up then.
---
just saying i never had the bug is it a console or pc thing?
---
Uhh when I get home if I have a spare anti armor I'll send you a Dm? Hardly use reddit lol but we'll see.pc btw
---
Yes. Very rare.
---
I never really use VATS but I get HP jumps with my shotgun 100% of the time. Its super annoying.
---
That I could imagine being a massive server lag, each photo is about 1 Mb and that would have to be stored server side whenever you loaded up your camp
---
Ah, xbox here... so don't worry about it.
---
Hodl
---
Yeah that too I was simply talking about the menu being better sorted lol.
---
Strange in numbers but if someone’s sharing that I do: Scrapper, travel agent, or whatever level 1 perk I have equipped
---
Aren't roaches supposed to be the only thing that would survive a nuke? :-)
---
sent you a private chat msg
---
Yes, it's a very rare drop from Forrest Events and sought-after by collectors.
---
I was on a server where we failed the event during double XP because of that behavior, pretty annoying for sure.  I have never had time to sit there for 25 minutes to get a handful of scrip legendaries.
---
Good luck finding one then
---
It’s a strange group and adds some flair to the game. There’s no direct quest for the group (at least that I can remember) but you can pick up tidbits about them along the way.
---
Heh, if you’re on PS4 I’ll mod it for ya.
---
I know. I’m under no illusions that they have any plan to help anyone who lost out. I just find it amazing that I never set a ticket in for any of the atoms I lost out on because of the recent bug. But somehow they know exactly how much I lost and had a system in place to return the full missing amount. I just can’t understand how they wouldn’t have a tool in place before launching the legendary run. I’m sure they can see exactly who and how much score is being lost.
---
Playing an instrument should take you out of pacifist mode. Actions have consequences.
---
You find the repeatable quest is that rewarding on a double xp weekend? I would have guessed double score was better.
---
I think you're getting the atoms that everyone else was losing lol.
---
If you have an open slot, create a new character. Typically, if you make it into the first circle you get enough to level up
---
said many times before, but yeah
---
If the do make it so u can wander the wastes playing a banjo they better make u PVP enabled by default so I can shoot u in the face!
---
I’ve moved away from the shotgun entirely- it does either no damage or get HP jumps all the time.
---
HUR HUR HUR fallout bad
---
&lt;upvotes over here
---
The missiles can be guided though with the right scope correct? Good weapon for getting in some hits if you are mainly a melee player while waiting for it to land.
---
Also a view from above when placing your CAMP. So you can get your border right where you want it easily.
---
Just logged in and 5 challenges are already done! Including the complete 5 challenges which isnt possible seeing as only 4 others are done. Im missing oit on 3k score! And cant even earn as much as i could before double score seeing as a dont play NW
---
Fairly new player that didnt even know this was a bug until today
---
If you’re actually built for pvp you could take way more than 3 shots lmao
---
always love the positive stories.
---
Oh nice!  Glad I asked before just trading it away for a couple hundred caps. lol
---
Right. All I was saying was I mean if you know what build you want and if you have the ability to get all you need for the build. At level 50 you could be set up pretty nice. Now as for me I didnt finalize a build until level 190. Bloodied whatever. I dont do it for meta. I just go around shooting stuff cuz its fun
---
Did you get the door on? I had to rotate mine before it would clip on
---
So I hope everyone affected by this gets some sort of meaningful compensation, and any plans for Season 2 get put on ice until the devs get a proven root cause fix in place to prevent this from recurring. I’ve not been hit by this bug yet (other than the glitched out world challenges that affect us all), but I know fair play when I see it, and sorry, Beth, this ain’t it. People should not be getting derailed on their legendary run by this bug.
---
What do you use to take her down, Nicholas?
---
I think the main thing is that the double xp bonus was technically unlimited. With INT and XP boosts you could grab that 10k xp very quickly as many times as you wanted, especially on a high level character. There's a hard cap on this bonus.
---
The bar for upvoted posts is pretty low here. I like how I'll see some cool camp posts with like 20, but "Can we do blah blah blah" posts 300+ or the "SCORE BAD" posts 1,000,000 votes and so much gold I  hit my daily limit.
---
Can confirm
---
I don't have my CC on either bethesda or steam side. I add money to steam and pull it for this very reason.
---
The only weirdness I've had with my VATS Sniper is that I was using the Stealth Suit for a while and then decided to go back to my normal weightless armor and my chameleon perk didn't work correctly for 2 weeks.  
---
My sniper uses either a Fixer, 50 Cal Hunting Rifle or Lever Action.  I use a combo of Gun-fu and Adrenaline, so once Adrenaline is working again I should be back to full strength.  
---
My only advice is make sure your weapon(s) of choice for your VATS build has the highest accuracy  scope mod attached.  This is what I've always done and I score head-shots at 40% chance regularly.
---
One thing that really screws the whole premise of having situational weapons and armour is that we don’t have the space to stow this stuff when not in use. Not to mention that we can’t just scrip all of the useless ones with the 150 cap
---
If Bethesda gave us a way of storing more sets, we could have wholes sets of ghoul slaying weapons and armour, and another set for animals, etc. But SERVER INSTABILITY!
---
I truly hope that they give us something with this potential ‘instanced interior’ update...
---
The one that heals all rads on revival.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying, problem is that they don't do that much of damage, basically a scratch. Also since last patch the Queen cannot be crippled anymore, it lands when she wants and bam, it takes off.
---
So yeah, their real use is pretty much zero lol
---
It has been for quite some time. Because regular armor gets you Legendary Perks, and PA doesn't.
---
Nah, it's worthless. I'll pay you 200 caps for it... 👀
---
I feel like there’s at least some players that could get together and compose some stuff to donate to Bethesda if they don’t want to deal with licensing. I feel like that would be extra special too because it would be made by the community for the community.
---
Could be they are turning them in at the ammo exchange, if you have enough missiles and 40mm grenades, you can get decent points for explosives like that. But carrying them around to use in combat is pointless. Half the time you fire a missile at a mole miner it goes right through them and impacts the wall 40 feet behind them, doing nothing.
---
Run them solo. It's much easier. Public server silos are way easier too.
---
I converted it to a regular, I didn't like the reduced range.
---
I heard Dragons don't exist in Appalachia anymore, so any legendary version is legacy. You can only get the base one.
---
It has always been more beneficial to run with normal armors instead of power armor. If you got good legendary effects on them. People just used to run around in PA more in the early months of the game because.. well.. Power Armor.
---
I share light footed just so people don't get caught in trap camps.
---
Not sure about lore but I’m a founding member of the chicken guild and the ciggy bandits
---
I've heard legendary dragons are legacy now, meaning they no longer drop. So I'm afraid you are SoL friend unless you trade for one.
---
Lol I don't think people know that the challenges are out for 24 hours. They don't have to complete them in 10 minutes but ya, they take such little effort compared to other games
---
Probably easier to get the extra score this weekend, but once you got it that’s it. At least last weekend was open ended. You got what ever you put into it. If you no lifed it and ground up 5 million xp that weekend you made 50,000 score points.
---
IMHO one of the better looking outfits.  Congrats!
---
You're looking at a few thousand at least, if you sell it. Depending how much folks are willing to pay for one, I'd say in the 20k-30k range, or more, or a really really good weapon if that's what you're in the market for.
---
Check the Trade Reddit for a more accurate idea.
---
Don't worry, you can always buy atoms and spend them on the legendary run to compensate! /s
---
Legendary dragons are legacy
---
Maybe an extra rank in Scrapper?
---
The whole damn game is So Bad it's getting real close to being unplayable!
---
I've been without my 1st sub since the 19th after having fully paid for a year. Bethesda customer service was nice and quick at first but once it "went up the chain" they fell silent. After asking what was going on the CS rep gave me a bit of an attitude and closed my request. 
---
Steam was sort of quick but still not as helpful.
---
Both kept blaming each other and both kept giving me odd reasons that had nothing to do with my account. In the end I got my first back without explainition along with $1000 worth of atoms (that has been reduced to $760 worth of atoms).
---
I've been sharing level 1 Scrounger, but I have no idea if it's actually helpful or not. I may need to change it?
---
I like to share Marathoner, very underrated perk.
---
People who share Sun Kissed can kiss my rad-infested ass.
---
So there’s 3 pa mods at the modus vendor and it’s X-01 headlamp bright, internal, database, and motion assist servos are any of these something I need?
---
How long for 2x Score?
---
Exploit
---
Wat why?????
---
Rejuvenated is a good one honestly, I used to share it a lot. Maybe I should again.
---
I wouldn't mind that at all. To say the least I was hyped for some deep tunes from the region and it didn't deliver as much as I thought it would. I now play my own playlist in the background.
---
You still get to do the settler daily quest.
---
I've never had it until today and I'm on pc
---
I had one back when game came out but I didn’t like it and when they fixed the carry weight glitch I was way over weight and got rid of everything including so many low level legacies that I didn’t believe would be worth anything. Oh well, but yeah you might lucky and find one for 30k caps from a player
---
https://youtu.be/pZc75KwfOe0 have fun
---
Its a bug/exploit, you can blueprint it and place it multiple times. I dont suggest doing it...
---
Nah your good, its just saying that incase you didnt complete all the quests that lead up to siding with foundation. You still get rep for the dailies.
---
Except changing slayer doesnt change the playstyle bc bloodied raises the bottom for everything. Everyone would still be bloodied for all the other dmg and dmg mitigation bonuses it serves but just using a bunch of slayer weapons instead of bloodied weapons. Although realistically youd only need a Troubleshooters, hunters, and maybe exterminators although i think hunters covers that too idk. Everything else like scorched, ghouls, super mutants hav no high end enemy that a standard bloodied isnt enough for.
---
I have a 3 star furious dragon....is that rare now?
---
Lucky is a major modifier which would go in the explosive spot so you cant have both. and yeah like everyone else said, dragons dont drop anymore so you gotta trade
---
Plus, with a full set of unyielding armor I can carry a lot more weight without being overencumbered as compared to the weight I could carry while in power armor.
---
Idk but you’ll need more for an explosive dragon than a regular legendary
---
One thing not many people notice is that your C.A.M.P. Gets bigger as you level up, and it reaches max size at level 50.
---
Okay great, thanks! :D
---
Three missiles is the number of needed to turn them in at the ammo converter.  I don't remember how much scrap you get for it.  
---
As for the 40mm, you get 70 ammo points for every 5 rounds at the converter.  The ammo I use (308) costs 150 points for 12 rounds.  For every 10.7 caps ((150/70)*5) worth of 40mm I might buy I would get 12 caps worth of 308 assuming you can actually find it for sale and they don't want 2+ caps per round.  It would take a long time because of the crappy interface and not be worth the time I put in but i could save 1.3 caps on 12 rounds of 308!
---
I'll also add, 308 is really expensive to make (5 gunpowder, 8 lead, and 12 steel for 12 rounds) and my FFR LMG eats it super quick.
---
This is SUCH a good idea 😂
---
That's the theme of Reddit ;-)
---
I argue that with 9 challenges as is one still needs to almost 100% the run every day to not pay atoms, and since there's no way they add a new daily after adding 2 already, a completable pain in the ass is better than an outright impossible challenge.
---
Especially since NW doesn't benefit from the Season stuff, which is Adventure content. Nuclear Winter should have its own separate set of content and challenges instead of being bundled with anything adventure, and there shouldn't have been a NW challenge in the first place, but only Adventure ones.
---
Seems a straight line of reasoning to me, sorry you don't understand. Besides, if I can endure NW to finish the run, you can endure Adventure, which is what the Season is actually for since most stuff doesn't even work in NW, for the same reason.
---
Great, thanks for the reply! :D
---
Which is ironic because they are nuclear powered
---
I have secret service armor and I find in close combat like at the Whitespring clubhouse,  I need to wear literally any PA because I'm getting destroyed very fast without.
---
I really want to know what went down...
---
STO, ESO, NW plus a bunch of others seem to do well with a different model.
---
If it's to be a PVP game then there's NW. Otherwise that's really not what this game is about...especially now that the players are working with factions. We have a PVP system with a reward track...let that be that and let the events track be an event and not a grind to have some players claim to have exclusive items.
---
That's very, very cool camp. Are you on PC?
---
Glitch that allowed to build it is no longer available, so all of them are legacy by now.
---
Completely agree, the Survive for 30 minutes is also horrible.  If your lucky you can pull this out in 2 games, most games for me even on a win are normally 13-14 minutes, meaning I need at least 3.  I can easily get the 100 score done 3 times in 30 minutes, giving me an extra 50, and I don't have to wait in a lobby for 5-7.5 minutes on top of the 30 minutes.
---
Ah that takes me back to the 90s
---
Or they all just die instantly as I enter the room. It's honestly hilarious buts extremely aggravating
---
Yup. Legacy, not highly sought after but still Legacy
---
I have a Two Shot/10% ADS/15% Reload Dragon.
---
Whyd that happen?
---
The endgame isn't the only part of the game that exists; creatire-specific legendaries dealing double damage would be *totally* overpowered in the early game. And in the lategame, you'd be creating a meta where having a full creature-specific loadout with weapon weight reduction on armor wpuld be king. That would be... annoying.
---
Knew it had to be an exploit. Thanks for the info.
---
You can’t farm any specific legendary bruh. The only ones close to ‘specific’ is the wastelander gear (gauss weapons and new armors), but you still need to roll the dice and see if it’s something useful to you.
---
You can do this to grenades in vats
---
That’s always been the “wink” of the plot in FO76.  It’s a single player plot before vault 76 opens with no single player to unite or at least consolidate the factions to deal with the problem. So we finally get to see what FO plots look like without a Vault Dweller, Chosen One, Lone Wanderer, or Courier to bring peace or pick the winners of the conflict. In short it’s a mess and everyone dies.
---
Get secret service armor and you pretty much have power armor without having one. And you can even get a jet pack for secret service armor. The only non power armor that can. I keep power armor on me so I can go into nuke zones but I have to rock my level 25 excavator being it lets me carry 575 with ribeye steak and my armor has weight reduction so I need it.
---
The least they could do is gift us atoms so we can buy ranks, if they can't gift S.C.O.R.E. This "extra dailies" is bullshit to me since they're auto-completing too.
---
Yes two this year and then three being the norm moving forward.
---
Not sure how "new", but yeah , do-able.  Just add it to the long list of bugs/glitches/exploits.
---
The Fixer has about 20% higher base damage.  It's also lighter than the combat rifle
---
Why do they not drop anymore? I dont know the reasoning, bethesda just took them out of the loot pool along with explosive lasers.
---
Seriously, I'd love to have two different stations for this, some Jimmie Rodgers to Hank Williams era country and a Bill Monroe/Earl Scruggs/Ralph &amp; Carter Stanley style bluegrass station.
---
I tried to convert mini nukes, they don’t show up
---
No, just make a smaller square within the circle.
---
A circle is better always.
---
Those weapons don't drop anymore. So you have to trade one. And to answer the question in more general fashion.. You can't really farm some specific item like that. There are wayyyy too many variables to getting that one specific weapon. First you need to find a 3\* enemy that actually drops a 3\* item (or gamble at purveyor), hope you get a weapon type you want from a biiiig list of different weapons instead of armor, then hope that all the effects roll perfectly from a huge pool of different one.. It is nearly impossible to "farm" something specific. Best way to obtain something you really want is by trading.
---
Mad at you? lol Never, I just call douchebags out when I see them.  And you most definitely qualify.
---
Thats a great one @-@
---
When are you guys gonna fix the item database? I really loved looking at how the attachments on guns modified things. 😟
---
What would be nice are ammo coins we could use to buy ammo out of those ammo machines all over the place that no one uses.
---
I really miss it on my heavy build. I can't one shot 68 super mutants without it. Everything else I can though.
---
There's no guarantee you can farm for specific weapons. Your legendary drops are decided by what weapons you have already encountered in game. The closest you can get is from the Purveyor where you can at least get weapon type chosen, but again, no guarantee you will get your preferred weapon type, let alone the wanted perks.
---
Trade is your most likely way to start getting your wanted effects, or a buttload of scrip and the patience of a saint.
---
You can move around while playing an instrument..... Found this out and followed around a bunch of new game pass players with a banjo.  Have a friend with the survival tent, play what ever instrument he/she has, have him/her move the tent while you are playing.  You will fall to the ground still playing the instrument and take the instrument with you!  All while leaving the chair behind.  Also works with the cooking animation, your just not able to actually cook.
---
I wasn't even that high of a level when I picked a Fat Man up, and it wouldn't kill things I could one shot with a rifle.  I didn't even have rifle perks yet
---
"I don't give a damn if Kim Jong Un builds rockets and gets a nuke!  But if he figures out how to attach a rocket to a sledgehammer.... the world is doomed!"
---
I use spotify to get these tracks a playing. Screw the internal game radio.
---
Charisma is too low
---
**cries in xbox**
---
Jealous of the nolifed it folks. No such option here lol. I’m like 10 spaces behind Zorbo and really only have time for dailies each night. Not sure this double score weekend is going to be enough for me to catch him sigh
---
When you put it in a vendor you usually have to knock the price down by half or so. I find no one will buy anything from a vendor for more than 15k if it's not a legacy weapon. I had a bloodied FFR Handmade in my vendor for weeks for 20k. Not a bite. Posted it on the market discord and had 3 offers in seconds.
---
It's a good tool to help gauge prices but you won't get many people buying for the highest price of that price check
---
The vendor for the mod plans is in the white springs service entry room, in the back on the left hand side. the plans are pricey my dude.
---
I've been told about him but I've never seen him. I have never really looked, but still, I do a lot of wandering and still nada.
---
Well that's mind blowing lol.  I will definitely have to hang on to this for a while.
---
If you are on pc and you bring the flux I will apply the mods for you
---
I did not know this, thanks!
---
It takes 3 to kill a molerat!
---
I've renamed all of armor pieces so they appear at the top of the list always.
---
If you put for example:
---
**(set 1) LL
---
This will always be at the top.
---
If you want your armor at the top, and a backpack or under armor below, put:
---
*(backpack)
---
I don't think you need full leathers for max zerk damage, but the sneak bonus from shadow is nice. I'm sure it can work with wood as well, you may need a different underarmor to raise/lower your DR though. And keep in mind that legendary perks coming soon will give you a buff if you use a full matching set.
---
What gets me, ultracite and x01 are level locked at 50. Don’t know how he could be using them.
---
If you're on pc, you could try to add "bDisableAllGore=1" in either your fallout76prefs.ini or fallout76.ini file and see if it helps you a bit by making you make less bits of your enemies.
---
motion-assist servos is a torso mod that add a streignth bonus, internal database is a helmet mod that adds an intelligence bonus, and headlamp bright is a helmet mod that does exactly what it says on the tin. if they sound useful to you, get em.
---
He is right missiles are a bad reward so as mini nukes.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here benefiting from the extra dailies they added to compensate  without having experienced the bug... probably just jinxed myself with this comment though!
---
Bethesda, listen to our prayers...
---
Honestly man, you could do better than that, but that’s just my opinion
---
How much does one like that sell for
---
*pops a Grape Mentat*
---
So... Let's talk more about that forest camo jumpsuit you're going to sell me for 200 caps 😏
---
No. They need to change it so that fat men and middle launchers are super OP, and then make it so that muddled and mini nukes are untradeable and can ONLY be gotten as event/quest rewards
---
You'd do more damage with a pipe pistol!
---
sorry bud
---
Glad I was not the only one feeling the same. Started playing this game when wastelander come out and never really had problem with vats much , and now finally manage to reach the point where I almost completed the build on vats crit rifle , then last patch hits. Now my character is borderline unplayable and frustrating at best
---
Always limp towards one of the many Fallout 1st tents, to store the flux as soon as possible!
---
F Yes I love this idea
---
It will. You need to wear a piece of armor with the blocker magic effect though.
---
My 50cal, LMG, and minigun are all explosive and they trigger it.
---
From this [one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview) , if you’re at 49 today you’re running right on pace to compete at day 69.
---
I did hear that it has lost a ton of value
---
A bloodied broadsider does 1 damage per hit, out of the advertised 1k! Because the game thinks it's an explosive weapon!
---
If you have to ask...
---
Damn sorry bro but you got plenty of time to make it up I've skipped every NW challenge since season started and I'm just hit 85 last night. ( I was on covid leave for 11 days so I understand not everyone is as far) with double score weekend you'll have plenty of time. If your on xbox and on later I can take you on my loop and try to grind out some xp with ya to try and make some of it up.
---
Thx for understanding
---
They could also just fix the ammo weight.
---
Do you run them while sneaking? I’ve heard that it’s effective. I usually tank through it as a bullet sponge and flame thrower assualtrons. It’s satisfying to say the least.
---
If you are on Xbox. I. Have. Caps.
---
All those atoms are for when the BoS stuff drops
---
3 less people to try and kill you.
---
i've been skipping any NW challwnges that arent super easy. like, place a camp three times? done. but otherwise i just pass on them. if it really ends up being a loss, that's why i stockpiled atoms. i'll just buy whatever ranks i'm missing on the last day.
---
I have one, its not that great. Even with every perk in the book the damage you get isn't really worth it in my opinion.
---
Used to be fun to use to rack up wanted bounty on camps or was a very intimidating way to start a fight with someone who was wanted.
---
 now its just in the stash for nostalgia....
---
I'm loyal to AMERICA!
---
Because that is 3 less people i have to "Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge". If they force me to play NW with these challenges, i'll keep hugging them bushes wookielike.
---
Yep, this is happening to me every time now on xBox, since the last big update.
---
So? I dont know how much crap costs. You act like its not possible to get more caps
---
You could vats target missiles micronukes and grenades in Fallout 3 until the no fun police at Bethesda patched that feature out!
---
yeah, giving more exp for surviving than for player kills was a big error imo.
---
It’s can happen on either. I’m on Xbox and had 3 dailies autocomplete me one day
---
3 people that have the potential to win the match for you as well
---
None of the armor skins can even be used in NW lol, it's literally just a PA paint and a rifle.
---
Besides, I want the ghillie outfit and glowing skeleton  as well, guess one cannot have everything just because they whine hard enough, right?
---
This is the only real answer 
---
You do everything to win that you can in NW 
---
Why wouldn't you group?
---
And the "trying not to screw a full team" argument doesn't really work as unless there are an exactly even (divisible by 4) number of solo players, than you are screwing someone anyway.
---
Well that changes EVERYTHING! lol
---
After removing its point limit as mine is constantly maxed out!
---
I hope they make up for it in some way...they most likely wont but hey we can Dream
---
Yeah that’s somewhat true, but you do you man, possibly you can find a better buyer or maybe not
---
The cookout daily at Hemlock Holes. If I have Radstag meat already in my inventory, it's fine. If I speak to the robot first, wherever he sends me, the Radstags are almost always fighting something and die before I get close enough. On the most recent attempt, the "herd" was a single Radstag that was instantly killed by 2 Yao Guai.
---
The final reward (level 100) has like a half dozen items
---
Did you buy all the levels?
---
With how quick ingame time sometimes goes and how night isn't actually 'dark' you sure it didn't start at dusk and just took until dawn to complete?
---
There was some confusion - when you rank up, you are getting the specific reward for that rank. For the final rank (100) there are multiple items you get, including the monkey beer stein.
---
I would love the ML/FM to be good weapons worth using then i would not mind the Ammo been super heavy.
---
ML just seems to annoy the enemy more than hurt but you can be dam sure the enemy ML will hurt you.
---
FM guess i will kill my self over the enemy.
---
you can, hypothetically, have people spawn in just next to a sheer cliff, bit of a giggle if you happen to be wearing PA, bit of a bother if you're not.
---
You get motion sick while stationary?
---
Edit: to clarify, I’m confused why moving in camp is different from the rest of the game.
---
The only ones that are really a chore are the gain a rank and kill someone.  Sometimes I can kill someone easy, other times I just get bad luck along with not being very good, and it takes forever.  Luckily I enjoy the mode and am always trying to kill people, but I feel bad for people who don't.    
---
The kill monsters one is pretty easy, the Jail and the Mansion are both places were you can find 2-3 monsters in the area, so two runs minimum if you don't find any outside of the starting zones.
---
Get batteries included
---
If you’re on Xbox, can I offer you an anti armor handmade and or caps?
---
Yeah, that would be pretty boss.  Would make going after the lamer challenges not feel like a waste when you fuck up early hah.
---
I am, but i'm prolly just gonna hold onto it for now.  Regardless if how rare it is its one of the best looking outfits I have lol.
---
Railway Rifle goes choo-choo 🚂
---
Batteries included helps the carry weight issue. But agree with this assessment.
---
Nothing stealthy about it, I simply don't like making twenty replies to the same comment. and it's not like I don't criticise Bethesda for the way they handle stuff. If you want something under this system you have to work for it, and one cannot get everything just because they really want it.
---
The gauss rifle is a super shit weapon right now 
---
Fire too fast and it locks up so that you can't reload, run, or do anything really but bash and fire 
---
And you miss in vats. A lot. 
---
Keep the super duped gun. It's better and will retain value on a longer time frame
---
Because sometimes you forget to disable auto fill.
---
And,as others have said, 3 less people trying to kill you :)
---
If you were on pc id just give you the full set for nothing , I've got so many of the masks it's ridiculous
---
It’s more along the lines that they have the majority of their teams working on star field thinking it’s going to be some game that’s gonna make us happy with them again. Sorry not me instead of leaving a handful of people to work on a game that’s having lots of issues push the game that no one knows anything about and possibly a lot of your fan base doesn’t really care about back. Trust me I don’t care if starfield comes out this year or next year I want fallout fixed and working properly....better yet Bethesda just needs to stop fucking around and give 76 to zenimax online at least they know how to make a multiplayer game work and listen to their community
---
Some improvements are already being prepared:
---
More Ammo Per Exchange: We’re adding options to buy and sell 10x and 100x the normal amounts of ammo so that you can exchange larger stacks more quickly.
---
Fewer Button Presses: Buying and selling is being incorporated directly into the terminal page for each ammo type, which means there will be one less screen for you to click through when exchanging your ammo. Combined with the increased exchange amounts above, you will be able to convert more ammo with less flipping through terminal menus.
---
Increased AmmoPoints Cap: You will be able to save up many more AmmoPoints for a rainy day, because we’re increasing the maximum amount you can store from 2,000 to 100,000.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more
---
On paper these sound good, but I’ll take a wait and see approach on this one.
---
On the other hand, one idea I have seen thrown around that could actually work well with these changes (namely the higher ammo point limit) is granting ammo points instead of random ammo types after completing a event or quest. Also, trading ammo points among players could be another interesting addition.
---
Maybe add a new perk og just be permanent would do the trick
---
But I can hear Todd's voice: *shoot a mini nuke, whenever you want.*
---
Yeah just carry around 50 pounds of extra shit in case I feel like having no extra advantage whatsoever
---
You can move around while building your camp
---
if i can run around in 100+ degree heat in a suit of power armor, you can survive with a peice of cloth on your face.
---
WEAR A DAMN MASK.
---
The worst for me was in maybe my first week in the game I was walking through (forgot the exact location) the forest and I hear a blood curdling scream from a woman immediately fallow by crazy earth quack. I jumped so hard my headset flew off lol. 
---
Ps. I'm a grown man and was a national rank wrestler this is a hard thing for me to admit
---
Exactly! Thank you for your support of the Scouts and public safety!
---
Mine can actually kill charred feral ghouls though
---
Its not worth a super large amount. Furious is just about the worst thing you can have on a Dragon. Nocturnal would be better. 
---
Legacy doesn't automatically mean payday
---
Hmm the one my team found didn’t spawn anything, it just feared is a lot and was mildly annoying and a bullet sponge. Said goodby to over 2k 5.56 rounds and about a 1k .45 rounds. Also didn’t use power armor but the Chinese Stealth Suit so yay sneak attacks the whole time.
---
Bulking would be waste of plastic....should be more like breaking down the ammo into components (NV) and then make the ammo as normal....but then, would only really work for FO1, as we have scrap.box for the weight....
---
So, yeah, the point system is good, just need better ratio...I mean..300 5mm for 24 556....i mean...that's bad.....
---
Does it fit the Fallout aesthetic a la WWII Atomic era?
---
I have a mule loaded with ammo and just swap over when I’m running short.
---
Nice change if subject, so you recognise you were arguing straws? 
---
To answer: In addition to the 9 challenges? Absolutely nothing. That wasn't your proposal though, the one which I replied to, and just saying, you are the one accusing me of inconsistency.
---
My Vampire Gauss Minigun is a perfect complement for my Zealots LMG - between the two of them, they are my boss weapons.
---
I usually don't carry more ammo than I could comfortably use in a play session - people need to stop being ammo mules.
---
&gt;I'm probably the only one that actually really loves solving the codes myself and takij the gamble if i got it right
---
which item DB?  Can you hit me up on our discord and we can talk through it?
---
I came here to say this. A circle is a radius equidistant from the center, it only makes sense that the camp radius is a circle from the camp device.
---
What I do wish is that you could build higher as the current system seems to only let you build 4 or 5 blocks high or deep and depending on terrain that you initially place camp. However, you can build about 12 long horizontally end to end within the radius. I think this has to do with foundation placement, but I believe I've only been able to build 4 story structures with a roof.
---
yeah had a bunch of those oldtimers recently too.
---
Kept turning the jukebox off ,emoted thumbsdown and harrassed everybody that came close to the instruments. Event failed and the stalker never showed up.
---
I was talking about his/hers tho. I know mines not good lol. Still be worth some caps but not worth the trouble
---
It won't happen because then the edges won't be equidistant from the center
---
True, but that would require you to aim! Throw on a missile launcher and once you're locked just launch away.
---
Actually, come to think of it...a team using bloodied or two shot or some such...all geared for max explosive damage standing constantly lobbing guided missiles at the queen would look awesome. Might not be the most effective, but it would look great.
---
Not since you're asking for challenges that are tailored to your play style at the expense of other people's.
---
Edit: It really wasn't that kind of edit, so good job on actually misrepresenting what I said to the eyes of readers, once again doing what you accuse me of doing.
---
 
---
You happy now?
---
I've seen that too!  It pops up for just a second then vanishes.
---
Oh that tadpoles backpack is MINE
---
It was worth it to me.  I'm already spec'd with Batteries Included because I rock a B25 UGL as my primary.
---
I'm actually going back to my .50 for sbq. On a good server it's overkill, and on a bad server I blow a ton of ultracite ammo and it fails anyways. Then it's back to farming high rad fluid. Not worth it to me at least. It is a fun gun if you dont mind the ammo grind, and regular ammo isn't too bad since you dont need gunpowder.
---
The Queen has 70% total damage resistance plus an additional 90% explosive resistance, which stacks!
---
It's not worth much more than yours honestly. Two shot is really bot great on snipers because the accuracy of the second shot is really bad and the extra shot makes it break twice as fast
---
The hight at which you place your camp module controls its up/down build. You can build 7/8 high with the right placement of the camp.
---
White Springs has been tweaked multiple times since BETA, and never for the better. As it stands currently, going there is not worth it unless the place has been nuked, but then only for flux ingredients.
---
Ah okay. Do you guys ever offer assistance or just Bush wookie? Had a teammate who was a Bush wookie but would stay close to me. I got downed, Bush wookie downed the person that got me, revived me, then went back to their Bush. It was honestly beautiful.
---
Please Bethesda, let us sell the ammo. I love getting something that is worth like 100-200 caps that I can't sell.
---
Don’t do it, even though it was really duped so was everything else, it’s the best weapon in the game (commando) so it’s value will just go higher over time
---
If it makes you feel better about yourself.
---
Edit: Truly pathetic.
---
Wha???????
---
I am a fallout 1st sub, but then again I would spend that amount a month on the atoms for stuff for my camp anyway
---
Arktos Research labs especially the public event there has a lot of different robots
---
Give them to the ammo converter.
---
In some degree yes. Now I’m no history buff but I do now this region well. During this time period in Appalachia you didn’t really have the soda pop rock and other types of hit 40s/50s music. The main “hit” performers were earl scruggs Skaggs and bill Monroe playing what you will “mountain music.” I feel that it perfectly fits the wwii era for this region. Let me know what you think about this!
---
Yes but how is that different from any other part of the game?  What makes CAMP motion different?
---
It is slowing me down completing the main story because I started a new character for sure, but they are pretty easy to complete so I dont mind.  I know the people who have done everything probably dont mind so much.  I only wish you could complete past challenges.  There is no way in hell I can do it every single day.  Real life stuff happens or I just dont want to play everyday.  It is what it is.  I'll get as far as I can without burning myself out.
---
I'm not really an ammo mule, i'm actually an unarmed build and only swap to heavy gunner for boss fights but if you complete SBQ event, project paradise and let's say line in the sand, that's probably around 8k rounds gone. I have 400+ carry weight 200 of that is all my shit i have with me so when i craft 10k ammo for gauss minigun that doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room.
---
Using mobile or desktop version?
---
This thread is like watching an episode of Antiques Roadshow.  Congrats, OP!
---
Bro same
---
Lmao, have you played ESO?  It has its host of bugs as well.  Just ask anyone who PvPs.  All studios, especially the big ones just need to complete a game before they put it out for sale and by that I mean actually bug test and fix the bugs.
---
How many mini nukes do you need in a batch for the ammo converter?
---
Me, I just use my old 1\* bloodied handmade, I rely on the other dozen people to lend a hand, usually there is a magic weapon so when she lands she's dead. I just make sure to get enough damage in.
---
That's true - I tend to only use my Gauss Mini for the real boss fights.
---
But a good way for a newer player to get some damage in since they don't have to aim right? Just lock on, fire off missiles.
---
And yeah that whole land/take off bit is annoying. The queen had wandered off last fight and was starting to circle away from the players so we were shooting at her to get her to come back and keep her attention on us...so players started running up and standing in front of us to stop us from shooting saying that the queen wouldn't land if you shoot her so the melee players can't fight. Of course the queen also won't land if she wanders off back into the nuke zone and finds something else to fight :-/
---
Another hammer needs our (YOUR) help!
---
3 I think.
---
new weapon yes
---
Some miserable bastard actually downvoted us for having fun 😂
---
Do you think if you can dodge a wretch, you could dodge a bullet?
---
They just need to make the Sons of Dane jukebox a radio station.
---
Yes Man was clearly in charge the whole time 
---
I thought that was the joke that the "independant" faction is you secretly working as the stooge of some robot. The funny face always throws people off
---
Well. that just sounds OP now.
---
In the middle of the most heated fight in all of the wasteland, with a gigantic toxic bat-dragon, and 12 other people blasting lasers into the sky at high speed.. and ol boy is out here playing “COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME” giving me a sick battle buff
---
I mean, I bust it out if I have a level 20 dog attacking my camp, but thats more for theatrics than it being a good weapon of choice lol
---
I'm sorry I should have clarified that a 4 story structure is at the same level as the camp device. I haven't fully tested height within camp, but I do understand it's limitations. After 4 high it becomes difficult to decorate and run wires due to being close to the camp radius top edge.
---
They announced they'll have a pause between seasons...so guess we'll see what they'll give us for those as they haven't gone into detail what those pauses mean for us except that there won't be season rewards
---
Or Bethesda should let us play the way we want and become ammo mules should we choose to carry the burdens. I dumped 10k 2mm on an alt along with another 50k 5.56 and 10k plasma carts. Just too much damn weight.
---
I would love a legendary perk that would allow your carry weight perks to become even more effective. Rank one max weight reduction increase from 90% to 92%, rank 2 to 94%, rank 3 to 96% and max rank 98%. Throw us hoarders a bone here.
---
Wooohooo, thanks for hearing us out on this point 🙏 
---
And don’t make weapons look alike in the future if they can’t share skins 😉
---
so THAT'S why an asshole kept punching me when i was playing a banjo.
---
screw you, random guy. we have ten people here, you can fight ghouls without me. lemme play my diddy.
---
My best weapon on her is a Hunter's Prime gauss minigun.   I do have a bloodied handmade......should I try it next time?    
---
Do you know, by any chance, if we can roll bloody on the gauss minigun or plasma caster?   It's painful dropping the ones you don't want once your scrip has reached its limit for the day.
---
I just forget to switch it most of the time,  is there a way to switch it after you load in?
---
It's so damn annoying that autofill turns back on every time the game is launched.  Almost always forget to turn it back off. 
---
Also is it just a me problem or does anyone else have their NW perks unequipped every time they go back to adventure.  Get a message every time saying my specials aren't high enough for the card equipped and it removes them all and turns on a default deck.  "Yes, my specials are high enough since I was able to equip all these cards in the first place".
---
Every time I join my first match I need to hurry up and redo my deck.  Fricken annoying.
---
I really like the armour. It plays a small bit of music sometimes, but it's not enough to be annoying. The planetarium is a rotating lamp that projects onto walls. It's nice but doesn't project very far.
---
That's true, I like Hemlock holes and Becker Farm area for the violet flux, loads of it.
---
Honestly you could’ve got something better even tho it’s been duped it’s getting its Value back up and that’s not the only weapon that got duped it
---
Today was the first time it happened to me. Be careful.
---
I understand this completely.
---
I always equip my Ghoul Slayer FSS switchblade before visiting WS -  weighs a whopping 0.3#. One hits L42s, 2-3 hits L68s and the bloated glowing ones.  And 3 circuits of the cottages, golf club, and laundry before it needs to be repaired.
---
I carry a couple other special purpose weapons as well - with weapon and ammo WR perks, not too bad of a load.  
---
But in general, most everything else gets a vampire weapon of some sort.
---
Unles I just want something different - then I breakout the whiffle bat :)
---
Those are defeintely cheated. One thing that's also a giveaway is that those weapons usually don't have handles and the characters just hold them by air when looked at.
---
I don’t believe so.
---
Yes, you can buy 1 month or 12 months.
---
Maybe a big sparky effect.
---
It's a fun gun but it's not really sustainable with the way Beth has nerfed the drop rates for stabilizing mats. The Legendary Perk for ammo might change that but until then I don't bother with it anymore.
---
Great story, the Colossus is great fun trying to shoot it through the trees and the pollen mist, really atmospheric. And I love the screws!
---
:D &lt;3
---
Oh yeah, probably worth mentioning the ability to go over build% was needed.
---
the thing is whenever you go to purchase it on steam it gives you this warning.
---
$12.99 at checkout, auto-renewed every 1 month(s) at $12.99.
---
It will begin after season one ends so... No time to stop.
---
by the way, they take up a ton of camp budget and can't be scrapped, so if some rando sends a private team invite to you or offers to build one for you, don't accept it
---
Motion assist servos give you +2 STR, which IIRC, benefits both melee damage and carry weight.
---
The other mods show up; visit again later
---
useless, much like 10mm ammo.
---
They would need to completely revamp netcode to doublecheck weapon pickups which would take time and consume money to do...and Bethesda isn't known to invest such resources into a filler game like 76 sadly.
---
Whitesprings has a very nice flat lawn south of the buildings. Roughly the size of the camp circle. No flowers or weeds sticking out either.
---
Had a great 3x3 house. With 2x3 garage attached. Front and back gardens 2x3 and 6x3 all connected and flat
---
But they are. With this game, you have to think of everything in terms of how it's going to make them money. That is their number one modus operandi. Constantly making the player over encumbered at every turn is absolutely going to force people to get fallout first. It worked on me. I don't mind spending the money, as I can afford it, but I absolutely recognize that it's a stupid purchase and I played right into their money trap.
---
Yeah, been happening a while. Pisses me off when it gives me shit I don’t need.
---
Just turn your custom ini.off You just need to change the extension to make it invalid. I like using the .off
---
We need mods. Modders do what bethesdon't.
---
I have used several all with the splitters and never had it proc, at least on the Queen. Everything else dies so quickly it's hard to tell
---
It's a holdout from 4.  You can talk to the dude to advance the Railroad quest, and I was wearing X01 and carrying a missile launcher.
---
He says "Ah, I was hoping for someone more heavily armed"
---
Although if Honest Hearts is anything to go by, naked with an ax is God tier.
---
Thanks for hearing us and doing something about it 🙏
---
all good! And a way to clear the area of scrap, and a way to flatten the earth like a hoe so things could lie flat would be great!
---
I don't have this issue, I have another with the first match. All picked things don't go to favs, so they are selected in pipboy because to show them I must add two times to favs.
---
Literally came to the comments to type this, got my upvote
---
Oh I’ve played eso since launch spent my first year on European server while they fixed the issues with the North American server but let’s see in eso first year it was rough but zenimax at least communicated with the community and by the year one mark eso was in a really good spot. Five years later it’s still going strong and if there is a problem zenimax response time blows Bethesda out of the water. Also you can’t just look at pvp if that’s all your focusing on then your in the wrong category of games 76 and eso aren’t solely pvp they are open world rpg games pvp isn’t the main focus it’s a side piece and at least eso has a decent pvp setup having an area solely set for it and also the option to duel in non pvp areas 76 just has bullshit pvp that Bethesda thinks you fix by nerfing everything till it’s useless. I do agree with you on the part that big game studios need to finish and better test games before launching them and cdpr at least lives up to that with cyberpunk....maybe they should take over eso and 76 lol
---
How'd you manage that already?
---
If stealing death loot was bad then the pvp baiting would just get worse
---
I’m a lowly ...L12 or so in NW; every time I go in, my perks are 1’s across the board.  
---
I know have several overseers tickets, cannot figure out how to upgrade perks.
---
Yes, it's a month to month subscription. You need to cancel it after you've received it else it will renew next month.
---
There is no way to just pay for a set amount of months, even the 12month/1year is a subscription.
---
Like the others already said, the last category in the building menu.
---
So same problem here was trying to take down sb with my hunting rifle while sneaking. No damage with vats but my crit meter was going up. Damn thing flew off cuz I wasn’t registering any damage. Also can’t use shot guns cuz I’ve got a sneak rifle build and with health regenerating it’s like my shotgun just tickles them
---
Ok this is the answer I was looking for. An additional question can I buy and cancel on the same day with all the rewards?
---
Indeed. Hell, I’d even settle for better randomization in the current playlist. I shit you not, the same song played back to fucking back twice the other day. I had to turn it off. I can tolerate the 60 minute men song once. Twice? Nope. Off it goes.
---
First time I put the RocketGirl outfit on, Beckett came out from behind the bar, walked in a circle around my character, and said that line. Freaked me out.
---
Then when I flirted with him later down the quest-line he acted all confused. Come on Beckett, get with the program
---
Oooo. I’ve never nuked Hemlock. And am low on violet. I’m nuking that now.
---
They honestly need to default to "Team Fill: [Off]". Or let you drop team in the waiting area.
---
I usually drop team when I'm just joining to complete objectives, but sometimes you forget. And given how long you may have to wait for a match, sometimes you just say "fuck it" and let it ride.
---
Someone dropped a nuke last night for SBQ. First time  in a long time the battle was in the nuke zone. Not a fan as a bloodied build but I go for it. I’m level 230 and I still find them fun and engaging. Fights over, get my loot, so decide to explore. Go to the sundew grove and there it is, Colossus just hanging in the trees. I run to the middle of the nuke zone where there’s about 4-5 players cleaning up some ghouls. I used the follow me emote and after a few tries get the group to follow. We get there and immediately start unloading. Took about 10 minutes but we took it down. Almost logged off right before the nuke was launched, glad I didn’t. When this game first came out I wasn’t thrilled about it being multiplayer, but these moments make it fun.
---
Honestly I think it's intentionally confusing to trick unsuspecting play3rs to use and/ or buy atoms expecting to get the pictured items.
---
me too
---
we both need a hug
---
Or go inside the Whitesprings building and come straight out again.
---
That worked for me the other night.
---
No, I know. I meant that as an example of each bullet/hit counting toward whatever. So a kabob with faster swing speed and the faster swing perk (incisor?) would heal faster because you get more hits in.
---
Yup and removes your camp icon, even if you have vendors on, it sucks!
---
I wish they would swap the level up with the repeatable weekly it would make it a lot more convenient for people who want to be caught up but not have a whole day to do so.
---
Pretty bad deal imo
---
I don't know, personally I wouldn't chance Beth fucking up and drawing your money and then saying you canceled it.
---
Ah, more targets. Excellent.
---
Lol. I’m only proving a point that it’s worth it. Personally I don’t part with the rare stuff I get legitimately. That after selling a baseball cap back in the day I had no idea was rare.
---
The view in camp mode in first person view all the view going in and out and trying to look around it's like I'm drunk in amnamusment park ride.   It genuinely pisses me off lol
---
Yeah, I'm rank 100, so I don't even bother with that one. That's way more effort than I'm prepared to invest for 250 SCORE, and I can't be arsed to create an alt.
---
I saw that someone shared cannibal 😂 that’s a riot
---
Caps don’t buy the good stuff, brother.
---
yea that's what i'm mainly worried about. But thanks for the help everyone.
---
Nocturnal would be immense. People seriously underrate that effect.
---
That's interesting, the one I had in the last nuke was also hanging in trees, I'm guessing they spawn there and are stuck? Makes for an easier kill I suppose.
---
*Todd Howard didn't like that.*
---
Were you online during the reset?
---
Were you logged in during the reset?  And what system were you on?  PC, XBox, PS4?  Do you go through Steam?
---
Just curious, I haven't seen this happen once to me though I'm afraid.
---
Go for it, cover the area from Hemlock to Becker and you should have lots, they seem to respawn fairly regularly to, you should get about 4-500.
---
Thanks dude. PS4. I'm not worried about it. Still on a pace to finish even with missing 4 days last week. The extra dailies and this weekend will make a big difference, but hopefully I don't get hit with this bug anymore.
---
Totally not worth it.
---
You're fine man.  Yeah after this I've done gone and found the spreadsheet that shows all of the outfit items and their rarity lol.
---
Berry buffs intelligence. You want grape.
---
The bright headlamp is nice because it is very bright. Internal database adds +2 Int which is nice for added exp. I have never used motion assist servos but I think it adds +2 strength (which will add 10 lbs of carry weight).
---
Calibrated shocks is a flat 50 increase to carry weight per leg. The plan is around 5-6000 caps but it will allow you to make the mod for both legs if you have the resources.
---
Currently experiencing the same issue
---
Desktop
---
For how much?
---
It's also a LOT smaller than I thought it would be.  For some reason I imagined it would be as big as the spinning globe with the little explosions that go off when you spin it.
---
If you buy a single month, you can cancel the auto-renew and you'll still keep whatever you would get from that first month. Even if you bought 12 months at the same time, you'd still get 1 month worth of goodies each month and definitely not 12 months worth of goodies on day 1.
---
You have violet flux?
---
Better that than Pawn Stars.  Last thing I need it Slick Rick calling up his buddy who is an expert on Fallout 76 outfits.
---
Well, they implemented the stealth archer build with Wastelanders so maybe the Bard build is coming down the pike!
---
Are you using PA? 
---
You need at least one glitched effect. So either the weapon has stalkers, junkies, 33, limb damage OR one of your armor needs 15% reduced damage while blocking.
---
I don't run any of those gun effects, I simply have a chameleons Secret Service piece that has the blocker effects, it makes it work for all my explosive heavies that have like 80 fire rate or above. Because the explosion is another hit, it "doubles" the fire rate. In other words, it won't work in PA for me.
---
Some weapons trigger it more effectively than others, it does have to do with how frequently you are impacting the enemy. There is no 200 number though, that's just a ballpark.
---
Another important factor is all the impacts need to land on the same limb, so like torso or head or wing or whatnot, I can imagine that being difficult to achieve with a Gatling plasma since they pretty much fire in a 180 degree cone from what I've seen. That's why it's easiest to trigger with a Gatling laser, they are super accurate.
---
Go to the main page of this subreddit. On the right hand side you’ll see “About Community”. Below that is “Community Options”. Click on that and there is where you can edit your “user flair”.
---
Did you fix your issue? I'm experiencing it currently and want to know if you found a fix
---
I have 16 atm but I’m sure I can get more
---
Nice, cheers for the link. I'll check that out!
---
Uh is it just me or does the lighting in your picture give you nipple shirt?
---
Up until fasnacht there were no squirrels and possums that could die, and the reject quest in the Pip-Boy was broken. I had to server hop until it gave me three high level monsters to Syringe, and it took three whole days.
---
What in the world would you need more for? Only want 10. Total. 5 per leg.
---
I recommend not using power armor for bloody heavy.
---
The big advantage is that all of your specials will be pretty high, including intelligence (lots more xp), and perception. I could be wrong, but it seems like high perception gives me insane range and accuracy with my .50. (To the point where I can be really annoying if I'm not careful in group events.)
---
You'll also have really high strength, which means that any kind of bloody unarmed weapon will be really useful if you get into close combat.
---
The missile launcher is fun for the 30 seconds it takes for me to pull it off a mole miner and then drain whatever missile ammo I hadn't got around to dropping yet.  Then it's steel scrap.
---
There are a couple of streamers that legitimately got to rank 100 in the first 2 weeks. They have pictures on their twitters.
---
The "100 score for every 10k exp" thing is listed in the weekly score thing, though. Haven't seen if it's being doubled during this weekend since they said it would only double dailies.
---
Ok 😂wasn’t sure if it was enough
---
I second the rejuvenated perk. Such a good buff for those that keep themselves fed and watered
---
When youre ready, you wont have to.
---
I went from Level 300 to 380 over the double exp weekend.  So my answer is played to much
---
I agree. It would be great if we could occasionally get new music or new radio stations in the Fallout games.
---
it does stack. I think even the visual effect gets more "invisible" the more pieces you have equipped.
---
as for making you sneak better, so long you're stationary, sure. but if you're going for a full set you might as well use the chinese stealth suit as it's better, bar armor mods.
---
There are 2 events (One Violent Night &amp; Line in the Sand) where I can still level up my 350+ character from that single event. I'm talking about a full level, not just finishing my current level. It also takes a couple of like minded friends that are not out to insta-kill everything. Being on a private server helps too. This way we can control the event and not worry about someone ruining things. For One Violent Night, you keep the Wendigo alive until the timer almost runs out. You can get a steady stream of ghouls for about 30 minutes. For Line in the Sand, there is a trick to get the scorched to spawn clusted together around the sonic generator. This requires the FO 1st survival tent though. Then it's like shooting fish in a barrel. In just 10 minutes you can get 10's of thousands of xp.
---
Some of Beckett’s quests involves them. But more as a foil to fighting the blood eagles than actual lore on them.
---
Nope. Got in an hour after. Also it took long as fuck to lad the first time. Really weird.
---
Thrill of the grill.  Nothing is ever close and you spend all your time fast traveling around for 1 extra rad stag or carrot.  I'm never doing that one again.
---
Unless someone knows a shortcut....
---
The lower your level, the faster you level, so there's the good news.   Just keep playing an toughing it out until you can unlock decent perks.
---
Nah we are good, I’ve gotten a lot of help throughout the game, and if I can help someone out I won’t gouge them. When are you on?
---
I find perks that reduce item weight more efficient.
---
Maybe. I usually only put up "waste" ammo like that if it's leftover after converting, but I guess I didn't notice it building up to be enough to use.
---
Nah, you can better manage your weight with other perks.
---
honestly I think a lot of people don't even realize the option is there.
---
I’m on rn
---
I can pretty much be on when ever
---
Difficulty: I have no idea how much ammo I am going to need when I start a play session.
---
Yes. I heard a sheepsquatch and saw it pop up on the top of my screen (it’s health bar) so I started going through the woods to find it. I found a little nest thing that was probably where the random encounter spot was and I kept looking but couldn’t find it. It scared the shit out of me even though any of my weapons could’ve killed it in seconds
---
Depends if you horde or pick up everything. I do so my carry sits at 430. If you want to try something different do that. The best thing to do is equip strong back when you plan on quick travelling somewhere and just plonk about overencumbered when it passes 360 mark. Always best to make sure all your armour is deep pocketed too.
---
You can use Batt Included to offset the ammo weight, it will also make cores very light too, so if you’re dedicated energy heavy gunner, weight isn’t an issue. It’s a pain if you want to run several types of weapons at the same time, because Bandolier is a must if you also shoot ballistic. 
---
I’ve crafted a bunch so far, the best boss fighter is TS+Limb or Junkies+Limb, both kill boss faster than Bloodied+10WA, maybe due to the ‘magic’ effect.
---
I didn't even realize the colossus would spawn near fissure prime- I'll have to check out the grove after SBQ battles now!
---
PC. Steam.
---
Got in an hour after the reset. This was the first time it happened to me.
---
Currently at work, however when I get off it’ll be good. Add me, duo86m
---
Team fill? Probably not. On PS4, it’s at the bottom where it could be easily missed if you’re not paying attention.
---
Ight thank you
---
It's an old issue / bug.
---
I mainly Bush Wookiee unless I land a couple high levels and then I try to play a good support role.  Last night I landed a team of 3 Bush Wookiee and one stealth player.  We all ended up together and hiding in the shadows until the end.  Our team won with 3 surviving.
---
And as others say, 3 less people interested in killing you.
---
I like to use either that minigun, my gold .50 cal or my raider Gatling gun while wearing the golden New Years suit. Makes me feel like I replaced Johnny Weston
---
While it's great if your team wins, until they credit the dead team members with the same XP for winning its an empty reward.
---
GREEN THUMB
---
Oh no I play NW. I was just curious as to why other players only Bush wookie. Just trying to get into a Bush creature mind is all.
---
yeah, exactly. my first dozen or so matches I teamed up because I completely missed the option to toggle it off.
---
I'm sure there can be some preventive measures taken to show everyone the difference between a loot bag and a death loot bag and to also let it be known that this will be like a contract for a PvP match.
---
Then again looting death loot should just be taken out of the game. It was only there for PvP to begin with. It's kinda broken now that you can't challenge the thief to get your valuables back. Pretty sure that was the whole point of death loot.
---
Why are you telling people to “stop being ammo mules”? It literally has no effect on you, play the game how you want and leave other people alone
---
That idea is amazing, and certainly a great reason to build a support character
---
But also I should add don’t sell it for caps anyway. Something that rare isn’t worth caps especially with all the presents still out there.
---
My zealot ffr 50drwa prime gauss mini shreds the queen.
---
If you get the marsupial mutation it gives a shit ton of extra carry weight so you could try doing that
---
They’re just variations of foundations, you have to press the right key to bring up them
---
I love that quest...quick, easy, good recipes not many have that I sell for a good price....sometimes it pops about 3 or 4 times in a row
---
It's a suggestion - some people complain about weight &amp; walk around with 100k of ammo on them.
---
You're right, it doesn't affect me - but it does affect them (hence why they complain about it).
---
So, I'm trying to help.
---
Check your emails
---
First time I saw a mothman in the wild.  I just saw glowing eyes, which creeped me out.  So, I go to investigate, see it's a mothman and charge it as I've never killed one before.  It makes those creepy noises, shoots something at me and fades into smoke.
---
You know that feeling you get when you sense someone's right behind you?  Well, this damn mothman managed to give me those vibes.  I turn around, it's just staring at me.  I rush the thing again, pumped up on adrenaline (real life adrenaline) and kill it.
---
Haven't been that worked up since Doom in the early 2000's.
---
Of course, at 100000 points it starts to make sense - but it should really be a currency that you can also use to pay at the ammo machines at trainstations...
---
MODUS lets me call in satellite bombardment. BoS has fancy armor that i cant wear while crafting.
---
Choices choices...
---
Don't do it. The idea is giving me a stomach ache.
---
He does quite often. Sometimes glowing deathclaw, sheepsquatch etc.
---
It's easy to kill him because he is stuck in the bog trees. But wendigo spawns are very annoying
---
A few days later i placed my camp to a other place far away and right after that i placed it back .
---
Thats the only fix i found out..
---
Its a mess to rebuild the whole camp again .
---
Make Sure you make several camp blueprints from Different parts of the camp to puzzle them together and save time.
---
Got any fitting examples?
---
i am 1000 hours in and have launched probably over 100 nukes, i have no idea how you guys play this game like that
---
it didn't work with the queen today.  maybe i did something wrong, but after pumping a ton of shot at her point-blank, i got nothing.  kept getting spawned back in the hot zone : life expectancy ten seconds, and not always able to fast travel back to the fight, but there was nothing from the legendary adds either - aside from what i claimed on the spot
---
What perks better manage your weight?
---
Cool thanks. I personally don’t get on the fence. I have gone to the bunker if that’s where everyone is at. Otherwise I try to stay in the open and only shoot while she is flying if it seems she is loosing interest. I am curious about the “kill floor” platforms I have seen pictures of. Never seen one in person even though I go to the event at least 6 times over a weekend.
---
Because it would be too overpowered, weeklies give you what, 7k score normally? Something like that, but also it would double the experience challenge which would also be too op. They don’t want people reaching the end too fast, or else they lose money
---
perhaps i must pray more
---
It deteriorates so you'll have to be quick, some sellers might sell it after a nuke but not for long.
---
Do you need raw, does stable not work ?
---
to add the mask wont kill anything and that gauss won't do the work that fixer does. 
---
Plus, all that shit has been duped
---
How about a workshop you can claim that produces springs, gears, screws, etc.?  That might actually be a good workshop.
---
They are a variety of upper floors, too, not just foundations.
---
Thank you. I wonder if its the new skin for the camp
---
Traveling Pharmacy, Thru-Hiker, Study Frame, just to name a few &amp; Bandolier.
---
Examples of how it would fit in the lore or just examples of how they could implement this?
---
I don't see any point to keep doing it when rep grind is done.
---
I do this when I can.  If I have a high level team I try to point out loot I won’t use and heal others.  Main reason I am a Bush Wookiee is that I’ve never been good at any type of pvp especially free aim.  I am addicted to VATs in adventure
---
Ohhh... nooOo... that thing was terrifying.
---
So yes, add it!
---
Exactly the same boat- My Auto TSE Handmade hits consistently in VATS and iron sights.
---
My LAR though is missing more than half of the 95% chance shots.
---
Less of an issue for me, since I mainly use my Handmade now (it's just too fun) but sometimes I need to make shots that don't have splash damage.
---
They are purchasable from players - or vendors - but nobody really sells them, as they break down into inert flux fairly quickly.
---
Notes and scrip. Caps and xp. Habit.
---
Updoot to get rid of downdoot because of civilized discussion.
---
Your grounded mutation I believe will lessen your flame damage by 12.5%, being fire damage it should be affected by the negative affect quartered by class freak rank 3.
---
I noticed you aren't running herd mentality, this will increase all of your attributes by 2 while in a team. Currently if you are in a public team even solo you gain the benefit of this mutation.
---
Additionally are you running a full set of unyielding armor? And are you by any chance playing on xb1?
---
Edit: sorry for the late responses, I just got off work.
---
I empty them out instantly after every launch lol. Us OCD people would really appreciate it lol.
---
Life Giver increases your total pool of HP.  So, below 5% HP (or so) you’re working in the “artificial” zone.  Taking a Radaway increases thirst, which reduces your HP by a small bit.  This can be enough to kill you, lol.  It happens.  Most of the time you won’t be in this region.  But now and then, especially in combat, it can get away from you.  
---
Being bloodied is all about management.  With full health you have a big buffer, or management zone.  At low health you have far less time to analyze a situation and make corrections.  Ultimately it’s going to make you a much better player.  Just takes some players time to learn new strategies for managing everything.  
---
The key to being good at a low health build...learn from failure.  Come up with new strategies to overcome something that didn’t work.  I think you’ll find it quite rewarding.  
---
Tip, put Radaway in the 12:00 position on your favorites wheel.   And use the Healing Factor mutation.
---
Honestly the whole have to go back to main to get into another match could be fixed. I’m sure NW players of all types would agree.
---
Oh I have to use traveling pharmacy, thru-hiker, and bandolier on top of strong back lol. I was hoping there’d be something I just didn’t know about yet
---
i also do not do this one
---
I think the OP knows that, it's just fun for some people to have conversations about a game they like to play
---
That is good to know as I have noticed over time is does sometimes get better. Maybe I will try that as well
---
I had the same thought. 
---
I changed the skin before i replaced it.
---
Maybe this was the cause for the fix .
---
I have a 1* Bloodied Gauss mini. I can’t see why it wouldn’t be possible for the plasma caster either. Just need RNGesus to be kind to you lol. It took me 10 rolls I think.
---
I found them! Thanks a lot for your help.
---
Short scope isn’t bad to use
---
Ok.
---
If you're going to live in Power Armor, you are going to have to make some hard decisions about what you are carrying. Since you can't make sure of weight reduction armor, you need to limit your food, drink and chems - don't carry junk, if you're carrying a lot of fusion cores, use Batteries Included &amp; the perk that lowers the weight of power armor too.
---
The interface is the problem and if its still inside the terminal its still ass.
---
Understandable. I do Bush wookie some when I am the last left on my team alive. Also when I play with my buddies, we will Bush wookie to see where zone ends up and strategize our next move.
---
If your camera roll is full, you can take pictures for credit even though it doesn't save.
---
I didn't even realize solo was an option until about a week ago (only started playing NW for the SCORE).
---
Yes, yes, 1000 times yes!
---
Missiles, 40mm, Mini-nukes....yeah....
---
I've had an issue today outside of VATS where my Gatling laser just won't kill certain things. They'll go back to full health as soon as I stop shooting. I was such in watoga and had to quit the game because of an assaultron.
---
I’ve seen a lot of looking for groups post on the Xbox for NW. There’s a particular button you have to press for it and I don’t remember how. Just check the people tab and press search for people or press the party tab and try something there. If you click around enough you’ll stumble onto it like I did
---
And if that doesn’t work I always play a couple matches in the evening so I’d be willing to squad up potentially too if I get on tonight
---
I agree that hunting groups should get a perception boost and events an agility boost to keep up with building teams as they are the best universally for xp. And why is the role playing group charisma? Should be a perk card share boost or something useful.
---
These are the easiest challenges ever.  I honestly don’t understand the complaints at all.
---
You do realize that in a boss fight that adds spawn and you can switch to killing adds, then switch back to the boss for more damage right?
---
Awesome, rooftop garden FTW!
---
It's so hard to get 4 people to stay together for an extended period of time, I don't give a crap what you're sharing. Just stay on the team.
---
True!  ...but as far as assaultrons go, it can be 50/50 on getting killed by them even if I am stone sober!
---
I believe it is a known problem and right now at emitted end a sure way to fix it is force a camp move and store everything to start over.  There is a list of things to try first, but the thing you least want to do likely will work.  Sucks, sorry
---
Great, so we agree that hit frequency determines healing speed.  Its why I love my VSS Shishkebab, it makes me less vulnerable and able to tank while also healing the miners.
---
found it odd that during Fastnacht the same kids who jump up onto buildings to shoot from a distance would crowd around the legendary as if they would not get a reward if they didn't kill it up close.  sometimes i actually felt bad for them !  all these clowns standing on his toes, drilling him while he stands still getting killed
---
For heavies bear arms in strength reduces weights of heavy guns only need to rank 3 so buys you 2 points
---
I'm thinking of setting up near camp mclintock and the gorge bridge in the forest
---
Nothing makes me happier than the confetti bloom after sniping a creature!
---
Wendigos for the screws
---
Uh oh, sounds pretty powerful. Better nerf it just in case.
---
Even nuka quantum grenades. 
---
And those Enclave Bombing events. (Clean up remaining enemies). It seems I’m tagging them myself more than Enclave taking them out.
---
Guys please stop with this logged in at reset stuff - unless you have some valid empirical data that shows it really does something. 
---
We have seen all variants now, logged in and nothing happens, logged in and autocomplete, logged out and nothing happens, logged out and autocomplete. I have never had something autocomplete on me ever, no matter if logged in or out.
---
Not trying to be mean, but this whole thing sounds to me like some snakeoil remedy that doesn't actually do anything apart from spreading anxiety.
---
A shovel smacking a scorched wanderer in Sutton, WV.  The echo off the buildings is sweet music.
---
Edit: I can't remember which beer but it makes a sound of an eagle screeching!  Love that one!
---
I don’t even live in PA lol. Honestly I’m not sure what’s weighing me down so much, I always try to figure that out. Usually it’s a lot of extra annoying because I hold onto it for the exchange machine and then get bored clicking options endlessly in the machine so I give up. I did just sell 43 plasma cores though so I should be a lot lighter right now haha
---
Do you have all points into strength plus the scouts backpack?
---
Let me answer for them .... No take you monthly helping of skins
---
If you’re only seeing 3 mods you’re in the military wing looking and the mod boxes, you need to go to the modus production terminal on the other side next to the science wing and it has plans for every x01 mod
---
Yes but if you ACTUALLY want to take a picture using the camera, then you have to go all the way to the album to delete photos and make room is maxed. Sometimes this happens at the worst time ever and you miss the shot you wanted to take. The album is far to small anyways, it should be closer to 100 (76?) photos.
---
Yeah. So if you expand the square so that the circle touches each of its four sides, you'd get the additional area. 
---
But then, the square would have a greater perimeter than the circle. And as soon as you scale the circle's perimeter up to match, it has more area?
---
I have been haven’t been finding them but would be down
---
Check under misc....you might be carrying a lot of gunpowder
---
no
---
I hit the hanging radstags at various locations. There are some at Toxic Larry's, Middle Mountain Cabins (with a chance for Yao Guai), and Flatwoods. For the veggies, Generals Steakhouse will set you up.
---
I only join teams for challenges, I quit as soon as an event is over
---
yep - fodder is what I'm after.  the odds of getting a drop i want are small.  with the exchange i can try until i get something i like.  guess i'll just keep killing wolves for now
---
apparently i need it to be pure, crimson and violet
---
I’ve shuffled my deck of perks too, you’ll be amazed at what is not necessary. Instead of one shot everything, take an extra shot and save 6 perk spots for other useful traits.
---
Patch Note: Replaced Missile and Mini Nuke quest rewards with additional 40mm grenade rounds.
---
Yeah I mean ESO has made some strides but it’s still kinda pathetic that some issues still exist this far into its life.  The fact that guild banks are slower than the 386mhz PC I had when I was 5 is a problem.  The mail system sometimes takes 5s other times it requires a relog or worse.  Botting was addresses in the first 3-4 months iirc but it came back and it’s still a very real problem.  Yeah 76 has issues too but I’m not sure Zeni would be able to much better.  Problem is they used code from Fallout 4 and Skyrim iirc and then smashed it into a multiplayer engine and they get weird errors because of it.  I have no problem with them reusing their code from other games but build the framework properly so you don’t end up with these weird bugs that no one can figure out.
---
I’m at 430 and leveling up every day is so damn easy, as are the daily and weekly challenges. It’s all done in way less than an hour. You have public teams, you have XP buffs everywhere. Where’s the problem?
---
Do people want score and xp for standing at their camp looking at a wall? I honestly don’t get it.
---
I'd like a build camera similar to the one in No Mans Sky.
---
people really use the word hack for anything lmfao
---
Just don’t share sun kissed!!!!! it’s the most obnoxious thing to share when there’s so many bloodied builds in the game
---
Raw flux shouldn’t be a component to crafting only stable is...guessing you need some to stabilize? The whitespring is best nukepoint for finding crimson
---
Admittedly, the issue seems more tricky than someone just deleting the wrong file. Friend and I decided to pvp yesterday and found multiple issues. Sometimes his shot only registered as a hit on his screen and I never saw the shot or received a hit, other times it hits for no dmg, multiple different animation and results mixes but none ending up hurting me. My melee build is actually more accurate in vats with pvp but I can miss 3-4 times when punching sometimes against mobs. 
---
I’m frustrated with this and I know it’s popular to just think Bethesda is ignorant, but I would genuinely be curious why some of these bugs appear? Personally, I think it’s the result of their game engine, I think there’s way too many variables that go into their world building and they just keep cutting it apart and putting it together so it can cater to bigger and more demanding games. Not speaking from experience, but this seems like higher ups refusing to rebuild their engine more than devs being incapable. I don’t see any other reason why updates that have no logical connection to other game aspects would become so faulty in multiple ways unless the engine itself has just been manipulated past its usefulness.
---
No, examples of the exact music you'd like to be in the game... :)
---
Yes, I could google it, but I'm not sure if I'd find the music you had in mind when making the post - and I assume the genre is wide enough to have numerous examples that just wouldn't fit in a Fallout setting...
---
Was that a fly I felt?  Hey that bullet was to the head, almost hurt, but look I am already healed, damn that third shot killed me....  yeah when that happens you have to start being more careful you really killed something.  I find that is about time I do a full reboot, clean the database, etc and tends to help.  But it is well known old bug that is still around.
---
True, thanks. I’ll check it out tonight. I’ve also noticed I carry a lot of water that I don’t need. But every time I sell it I hit max caps and then still have a couple hundred. So then I go to the wayward and drop them in 50s for the level 1s but I still keep getting so much. Honestly, I don’t know where they come from
---
I wish they would
---
If you have facebook there are a few groups that are great
---
you need the raw with other components to get it to be stable i believe
---
Ultracite? Lol for ultracite Gatling Lasers. Does more damage to scorched
---
Build a couple more foundations snapped to it, side by side, basically make a bigger square, then scrap the one that was giving you trouble at first, you should be able to remove the rest of them.
---
Agreed. Not a power armour user myself, so I have little need for Fusion Cores other than selling at steep discounts at my vendors, but missiles are pointless! I don't use them, and no-one buys them, even at 1 cap each! What's the point?!
---
Depends on how you define pay to win.  1st is pay for convenience which some equate to “win”.  The win in pay to win really should be in quotes because it’s become such a broad term that simply paying for anything at all can be “winning”.
---
i really hate that NW takes your special stats from main game. That’s such a stupid idea to me, like i can’t come up with a worse way to handle stats for a pvp mode than borrowing them from a pve mode. Like what the fuck?
---
Primed Gatling laser. End game receiver.
---
I go to your website, click on DATA on the top right, then ITEM SEARCH just below it and it pulls up the NukaCrypt searchable database. I then search for something (example plasma) and *any* weapon I click on gives me [this](https://ibb.co/TvDy3gm) error page.
---
This has been going on for months for me, no matter what browser I use.
---
Try adding stairs then a floor atop it, then remove  floor then stairs stairs.  But as previously stated you might need to move camp to start over. I had scaffolding glitch like this while wiring my third story, had to start over due to budget. Its a big ugh, just build carefully and place everything deliberately
---
If you have a private server you can do it yourself, or have a friend help. Just stop the item, have them pick it up and then load your new character and they drop it back to you
---
I'll try that, thanks
---
Yea hardened mass glowing mass and high rad fluids. All found in nuke zones the mass and fluids are on enemies killed in zones sometimes.
---
I've been running a shotgun/grenade build. I want to like grenades, but they're so underwhelming. 
---
If I break my fascination with grenades I can free up a bunch of perk points.
---
people actually use fat mans i thought it was just like a novelty to have their kinda shitty
---
🖕🏻
---
Get fallout 1st or ask a friend if you can use them to transfer items, get them to build you a hut with a lvl3 lock so nobody can yoink it
---
It's also the world where a .50 cal M2 Browning does less damage than a musket!
---
If you’re not wearing a breathing apparatus, you’re only delaying the inevitable 2nd scorched wave.
---
Private world's(fallout 1st) or a friend you can trust.
---
Great point
---
ah okay thanks
---
Well you can always equip a guitar sword and 'affect' those around you...
---
Yeah I have that too. So if I have bear arms I don’t need strong back?
---
my ammo converter sits on top of a dumpster outside my house, trash converter it is
---
I had a dense combat armor box mod that said 2 ballistic fiber and all I got was one rubber.
---
aw man, i don't have either of those things...
---
man, i don't have either...
---
Same.  3 star bug killers are all I ever seem to get.
---
I I have a vats pistol character and was super excited at the gauss pistol thinking that it was going to be a serious hand canon but then I make it and use it only to miss every 95 percent vats shot I make, haven't played my pistol character since. Not much fun at all
---
i don't have either of those :/
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Yes, but you can get them at other "!" events. Even Tea time is better than this one.
---
Yeah. I have 15 str and I Marsupial.
---
Is that confirmed? I was under the impression Bethesda didn’t want to make any commitments to fallout 1st until this season got close to ending, since there’s already been a lot of concerns about completing it.
---
My only worry with moving away from the terminal is that allows for an increased chance of duping. I would just like to see and option to donate all of an available ammo for points and then let the terminal take whatever multiple of ammo and give me points. Alternatively just let us spam the choice rather than backing out. I would gladly spam space bar 100 times over dealing with the current interphase.
---
The only aspect that may be considered pay to win is the scrap box, but that’s not much different than the regular game
---
You only need plans for the newly added weapons that were released in updates, not the base weapons that were available at launch.  Those are always in the loot pool.
---
[👍](https://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0)
---
You may find the other components in player vending but I haven’t seen it in awhile. Glowing mass and rad fluid I believe are under aid and hardened is a junk item. Happy Hunting regardless fellow dweller.
---
Mine and sell silver scrap to vendors. set up a few silver collectors at workshops and check them every hour. basically just printing caps at that point. Im FO1st so silver takes up no stash space, I keep a horde of it and treat it like a savings account.
---
Are you on Xbox? I can help you out if so
---
no i'm on pc!
---
i'm on pc, thanks anyway :)
---
I share life giver and haven’t had any issues.
---
Yeah I have all the ammo weight reduction perks as well as bear arms.
---
I also drop them all and never pick them up. How many
---
countless paper bags filled with explosives litter the server, i have no idea. I can only imagine it is a lot
---
I always forget about gunpowder. I’ll check thanks for reminding me.
---
The one thing I am really hoping for is a total rebalance on perks and legendaries.  I like the bloody and junky stuff but it would be so much fun to have more variety in builds. 
---
I'm with you 100 percent!
---
I just join a party with them and make them do stupid stuff like raid and murder a workshop and their owner for abusing known glitches. They stay with you forever that way
---
Yeah I have that happen too. I’ll start of with like 15 but by the end I’ll have like 70.
---
The finger guns emote sound.... or really any of those emotes.
---
I must have missed them 😮
---
Perk share boost is a neat idea.
---
It can be a pain at times, I like to build and if I get caught up building something then I usually have to decide between dailies or bullion. The legendaries seem to have also seemed rarer recently unless you’re on a nuke map. But I agree though. The fact that I’m keeping up with this battle pass as much as I did with cod(probably 5-6 hours a day) before I started working. Most games that employ this are trying to force you to decide between them and any other game
---
I understand but when fighting the Queen (I'm talking about the Queen only for the sake of this post)  me personally, I only really put my attention on her when she is on the ground and just light her up. I use her as the example because she is the "main boss." Now when The Colossal Problem comes out, for me and me only, it might change.
---
Thanks guys. I wasn't sure as I've only been experiencing it for the past 2 weeks.
---
I posted this exact thing not long ago. But look! Here comes that one guy on the sub who uses his bloodied missile launcher to tell you you’re wrong!
---
It seems like this game would be so much better if it was just more like rust
---
It's not something new to do or see though. What I'm suggesting is that the daily could take you to 2 unique random encounter locations in a given biome. This would give incentive to the player to travel a different biome every day on foot and learn where random encounter locations are and maybe see some crazy stuff.
---
A camp sign in book would be cool. Leave your ign and a choice of a few different generic comments. 
---
Cool base! 
---
Awesome deals! 
---
You’re an asshole trap builder who stole all my loot and I will hunt you down and murder your family! 
---
You know, the usual things you might want to say to a random wastelander.
---
Hopefully this means a big announcement next week
---
They break really fast because Bethesda had the brilliant idea to calculate deterioration based on hits instead of shots fired, so nobody uses explosive weapons
---
Id still use it but I'm one of the few that goes around saving everyone's ass from adds and still melts the queens face.
---
Indeed. There are some areas of the map I never go to.
---
Really it would be nice if we had a build space editor so you can map out the borders whilst keeping the same available area so building along cliff edges would be easier and more viable for example
---
The main reason I think, is because whenever you drop something.  Like spoiled meat. All you don’t want. Etc. If another player picks it up they would get a bounty for “stealing” when in reality they are just looting whatever bag you dropped, or whatever world container you decided to dump it in. It would be stupid to do that. 
---
But I think mainly The reason you can’t “challenge” the person that looted your bag is because the person isn’t stealing from you. You died , and the game is made so when you die you lose your junk. Any player can take it, assuming they are near it. If they are nice people, they will leave it there for you to get it back. But nobody turns down free loot.  
---
Whenever I die people usually pick up the few 3-5 pieces of junk I have on me. I’m constantly putting stuff in my scrap box so it’s very rare for me to die with junk. But even before I became a fallout 1st member. I balanced my stash box with junk I needed. And gave away or sold what was useless to me. 
---
And if I see somebody die, regardless if they are level 4 or 200. You know I’m going to take it. 
---
If you purposely start PVP and you know you have junk, don’t complain when you die and they take your stuff. You should’ve put it in your stash/scrap box.  (Not you directly, just in general)
---
I see, thank you
---
You forgot the "logged into NW but then didn't log into Adventure afterwards" :-)
---
Heresy
---
This might just be me, but I think removing an ally resets the timer.
---
And thats cool man as do I. Its also just as easy without it. Remember, this post was a discussion not an end all be all.
---
That's not a bad idea haha..  ' (insert name) was here ' sort of thing! That would be pretty cool
---
Legit I would like that
---
sorry for your loss, but knowing how the caps and script limit works... are you actually surprised ?
---
It happens sometimes
---
I tend to share bloody mess or ricochet.
---
It would be easier if they actually showed you your fkn progress bar! I did well in my matches last night, what if I’m only 300 points away from my next level? I wish I could check that because I actually have stuff I need to do tonight and would like to know how much time I’ll actually need to put into NW today to get to the next level.
---
I don't know if it's definitely confirmed
---
Just trying to bring you back to the dark side.
---
I don’t even fire at her anymore unless she is on the ground.  I’m convinced people are air staggering her just to troll the event.
---
No not really but I held a shred of hope.
---
It’s easier to program circles than rectangles.
---
Hopewell cave the first time I walked up to the entrance. That Deathclaw got me pretty good.
---
&gt;	ultra cute fusion cores
---
They turn the Scorchbeast Queen into a friendly bat that drops candy at other players camps. It's the Wasteland's  Easter Bunny.
---
I won't be too argumentative because my name is Jason King so you get a pass in my books.
---
Yeah but i want it covered with greens that you can still see the screen but it covered cause my pip boy arm looks real dumb with full ghillie armor.
---
I prefer weight reduction perks and a few legendary armor pieces that reduce item weight.
---
Accessorizing
---
Makes sense that’s why it’s called ultracute
---
Forget private server. What you are transferring is generic enough that the risk is minimal. Have a random friend (just someone on the friend list) and yourself on the same server. You don’t even need the friend to help you, just to provide an anchor for returning to the same server. Find a random suitcase or ice box or any old container. Drop the dress in the container and logout. Then switch characters and join the server your “friend” is in. Go to the container and claim the dress.
---
I only really pick up stuff that have components I normally need. Like screws and gears and stuff.
---
Or that armor skin on other armors
---
Fast traveling, pulling out your equipped weapon and it won’t shoot and also says that it has no ammo until you equip another weapon and then go back to the one you previously had equipped🙄Have had this happen multiple times as well
---
It’s so death actually might have consequences in game
---
Death loot is different than regular loot. When you assign your cosmetic bag like the tombstone or something. It gives you the choice to change it for two separate bags.
---
One is for the scrap you're carrying when you die, while the other is for dropping stuff intentionally. The main reason people were originally allowed to loot death loot was to informally challenge another person to PvP.  Pretty much saying " hey.   I have your stuff you wanna challenge me and take it back?"
---
I have 15 str. Both legs are calibrated on my PA and Marsupial.
---
Marsupial
---
I blame Bethesda making it cripple proof
---
It's not the individual effort of a challenge, it's the combined effort of all the weeklies and dailies that are wearing people out. Because they don't change, there's a pool of around 20 different things alternating every day or week, doing the same boring content you've been playing for months now...
---
We got wastelanders, which is good, but it just culminated in the same 4 quests you have to do every day to grind this shit out. This game seriously needs some diversity - maybe it would help if there were variants to some quests? 
---
Maybe Mothman could be aggressive 50% of the time after the lighthouse event? Maybe the wendigo at the sons of dane hideout could be a colossus sometimes? Maybe the meditation thingy at the palace could have a legendary scorchbeast now and then? Things like that...
---
And it would be nice to stop forcing people to do things they don't want to do.
---
Marsupial gives strength
---
I've always felt CAMPs were so lack luster in the game. Other than maybe visiting a camp, to check out their vendors, and the very rare occasion I happen to stumble into one.. 
---
You could and probably will, spend hours making your CAMP look exactly the way you want it. Only to have one guy a week buy 3 x 10mm rounds you're selling for a daily challenge and not care about your CAMP. 
---
There's not much to gain other than using your benches, or VERY rarely using instruments if you have them because they happen to be located at your vendor and they're bored. 
---
There should be more buffs in the game, concerning CAMPs and this you can interact with. With CAMPs obviously being the biggest ATOM spend I imagine, they're disappointing as fuck to see under utilised.
---
He does't mean the Pa.
---
I am increasingly seeing the missiles and mini nukes as a challenge to burn through the ammo. Why shoot or punch that lone rad-scorpion when you can get the fat man out and handle it like a wastelander.
---
Yea pretty much. So you could challenge another person. But if they have pacifist. Oh well. Nothing you can do. They need to bring survival back.
---
why tho
---
You can still lose your loot if you die. The main concept of a player being able to loot your death loot,was implemented as an Informal PvP challenge. Similar to workshops, except those are a totally different story and actually have a purpose.
---
Allow us to set a tax for fast travelling to our camp so if nobody buys stuff we still get a little kickback... I’d be able to actually make money if that happened
---
I usually solo
---
Yeah like the ghillie skin goes up in flames and gives you damage to
---
Well then you seem pretty maxed out on carry weight so just try to pick up less stuff and spend your perc points somewhere else
---
I just miss the ol days where you could get the same amount of content starting a game two years after release. The industry is changing whether we like it or not and sadly it's never going to change. Started with destiny for me and that's why I quit that game, it's depressing to see that the one franchise I could rely on to be fomo free is now making fomo a gameplay feature.
---
life is pay to win.
---
https://youtu.be/Up97cMP7eSQ
---
I was hoping 100 days would be enough time to develop a new TLS and have it ready to roll out. It would be a bummer if there's a long gap between, especially since atom challenges are gone now.
---
I love this idea. And it gives players a reason to actually visit more camps.
---
It boosts carry weight, not strength. Not even the melee mutations boost strength. The only one that does is herd mentality but that one boosts every stat so it’s negligible
---
I thought marsupial was carry capacity, and the hippity hops...  So it would not affect your melee damage like a plain strength upgrade would?
---
Naw, it boosts carry weight
---
They are focusing to much on cheap gameplay features that run on fomo, which turns playerbase against devs. I've seen happen before and I see it happening now, but sadly it usally amounts to nothing
---
Yeah its dumb but im just saying
---
100% agree with you my friend
---
Oh yeah! Also, I usually sleep and play an instrument before logging off, maybe this prevents the bug from happening?
---
It doesn’t effect strength, it specifies carry weight specifically for some crappy design decision
---
Actually be able to line things up without having to clip them together? Are you on crack?
---
It's so obvious that something like that should exist that I believed it actually works this way.
---
I’m on console and haven’t dealt with those issues yet thankfully and you wanna talk slow the damn apparel tab in the stash box takes long to load then my dial up internet from the 90s lol
---
Yeah you're right. Herd mentality and empath are great now though. You can form a public team and it counts that you're on a team even if youre alone so you never receive any negative effects from them
---
Death doesn’t really have consequences since there are loot bags. It only does if you die stupidly in which case they probably deserve it
---
Coulda swore it was +4 strength
---
It should’ve been but it isnt
---
I mean, it's confirmed they "might" have stuff. Bethesda said they didn't want to include any 1st bonuses for season 1 but would look into it for the ones following.
---
Cheers 🍻
---
Ok but you can be part of a team and run solo. Heck out of a builder team I get +4 int, +5% xp, herd mentality gives me a +2 to all my stats, and strange in numbers bumps all my mutations by 25% (it’s a long list of benefits). On top of that I get whatever someone is sharing. Running true solo gets no where near that kind of statistical increases. Just the xp bonus on all that is +19% and a can of stew makes that 31% (carnivore).
---
Thanks. I hadn't bought any of it yet besides the weapons, that just changed the entire way I spend scrip now.
---
I agree with you. I would love to see camps being used more and for people to have more reasons to stop by them. The whole original story was about 76ers going out and rebuilding. There should definitely be some kind of buff associated with visiting another camp. I would love to even see other players be able to leave something in camps for us if they were inclined. Just little things to add to camps/the bigger picture.
---
I'm doing this quest and having the same issue. Nothing's worked for me yet. Did you get it to appear?
---
All day? I only do silo runs legit... and it's 25 minutes max. (and a shitload of lead and steel)  
---
Also, my experience is the opposite.. nukes are launched quite often. 
---
I actually enjoy the silo runs. I'm hoping that there will be more nuke events coming.
---
Ah I see. I've mostly just been completing the challenges as that's all that I have time for really.
---
Do you have any tips on gaining XP that don't involve power leveling by chance?
---
I'm still trying to learn everything so I can't just respec on the fly hoping to appease everyone, im not being a dick im just trying to enjoy myself
---
I second this.
---
All week I've been logging in 5\~10min after reset and nothing ever happens. Today I log almost an hour after reset and I'm screwed.
---
What I really want to know is what is bethesda going to do. Because extra dailies are worthless if they auto-complete themselves.
---
Agreed, they should be entirely separate, and you should be able to go beyond the normal 15 limit so a wider variety of builds can be made (with combinations of certain high stat cards.
---
*laughs in honeycomb bunkers playing NW*
---
its negative is -4 Intelligence
---
It just feels like it's happening all the time now idk maybe i have just been having a bad luck streak with it
---
Oh thanks for the information! I'm not entirely sure either but I think it may have been a bug and was patched.
---
I think there’s been a lot of extra lag on this event everyone since last event weird stuff happens with my guns and endless jet pack etc server has a hard time, that’s what I think anyways
---
Here's a famous example that appeared in a movie...
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZtgZ5fHOuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZtgZ5fHOuU) 
---
The whole soundtrack to that movie works.
---
Now that I think about it though - most bluegrass music is very religious. That may be the reason that Bethesda avoids it - they don't want to portray what nuclear bombs would do to the Christian faith - they'd rather pretend it doesn't exist - which is cowardice.
---
Now I won’t be able to go to the bog anymore without thinking of “Winnie the Pooh’s Asshole” lol.
---
Sometimes it happens for like a week straight then suddenly wooo winning again
---
I have what feels like a depressingly short list of fixes and tweaks for C.A.M.P.s... This is sorta one of them. Honestly, I think I'd prefer hexagonal vertical solid over square, but that'd be so group members could snap their build area to yours, and little beehives of connected C.A.M.P.s could be built.
---
I'd also like even modest leveling/clearing capability, perhaps coupled with a set of 'path' tiles to give us a variety of walkways between C.A.M.P. structures if we have more than one... Fixed fast-travel spawn points... Angled build tiles... Full flooring options for 1x1 and 1x2 upper floors... Those sizes for foundation pieces... Ceilings...
---
Now that they've fixed the 'spoil' food setting in inventory...again, this is my 2nd biggest gripe with the game.
---
Half the time I give up on corpses and the other half of the time I chase down what I've just killed and loot it while taking damage from other mobs I have yet to kill, just to make sure I am not wasting my time and ammo.
---
 It is maddening and unnecessary in this gen of Fallout. Does turning ground clutter completely off help at all?  Cuz if it works, I am about to make the game fugly just to see my loot!
---
Agreed, give us that FEV!
---
Yo drop that perk. Get pharmacy 2 and ordinance 2 if you are heavy gunner.
---
Yea I 100 percent agree I'm lev 247 and if I use full exp buff I can level up in about 15 to 20 mins usually before I even finish my first full loop
---
If I die normally and no one is around, I'm challenging NPCs to get my loot back. If someone steals it I can challenge them and suffer the consequences of defeat.
---
Maybe instead of death loot being available. You can suffer from some other form of penalties when you die,that you can recover from. Since that's the way they intended the game to be. It's not designed around hardcore death penalties, therefore it's flawed, because it strays from the original purpose. I agree with a game that creates challenges. One of the reasons why it makes no sense that I can't challenge another player for trolling me into suicide.
---
If a game is designed to challenge me and make me suffer by jumping through hoops to get back to where I was,then so be it.
---
Ah ok cool.  I’m heading in that direction too.  Just need to finish up my Tadpole challenges so I can get a better backpack
---
Doesn’t herd mentality only work if you’re near the team mates though?
---
Collectrons are probably the most Pay to Win thing in the game, but no, there's no way to spend atoms on things that make you directly more powerful or earn experience more quickly.
---
No way dude, 2 shot all the way
---
Nope. Even works if you are a team of 1 person.
---
My positive story is yesterday, I was getting hammered by some super mutants on a bridge and this guy in power armor flies up on the bridge and saves me from dying. He gave me a heart and took off. I was in awe of this cool guy coming to my rescue.
---
Not going to lie, once i finish the score board, i am not logging back for a while. They used a great tactic because those like us that grinded might never grind again so we might buy the ranks, like many of the rest.
---
God. The way feral ghouls run at you still manages to unnerve me somewhat, even from the level threes I can effortlessly swat aside with the gentlest caress of a baseball bat.
---
Hi Bud, i'm on pc and can help you. but im only awake for another hour and a half.
---
For when you feel ultra cute, but might nuke later
---
Good to know.
---
Or just random trash in general really.
---
Stop putting stupid junk in my inventory I have to throw away every time.
---
And fix the damn notifications that at least tell me the garbage you shoved into my pocket.
---
Would a yellowish/golden glow around the corpse make it visible for you?  Red in nuked zone wouldnt work anyway and green in the forest would be invisible as well...so yellow might be just the ticket?
---
Toss a coin to your vault dweller
---
oh valley of scorched beast
---
At the edge of the fissure
---
Fight the mighty queen
---
That fly's by and radiates you
---
And brings about your mutant
---
you're right, 99% of the atomic shop is cosmetics.  Ice chests, collectrons, and scrap / repair kits have in game use.  The rest of it?  Prettier armor and guns.
---
I will say that the scrap box from 1st is really sweet.  How much steel do I have?  Who cares!  It will all stash...
---
You're wrong. Dead by daylight has a great system. You advance by playing normal games and not wasting time on shit you don't want to do. So it's a win-win. You play and unlock stuff.
---
Yep. Happens every time. 😂
---
They dont owe you anything. You arent entitled to a chance at a fixer plan.
---
Might not work in those times when the body flat out disappears.
---
What do you play on
---
Happens every time. Never really bothered me, of all the issues that need attention in 76, this isn’t the hill I’m gonna die on.
---
It should just be an option in settings, and not something you have to spend perks on.  We spend enough perks on just being able to carry the loot in the first place.
---
CSS is great to carry as a hazmat but offers fewer benefits than normal armor such as DR/ER, poison resist, weight reduction, Stat bonuses, and flat rate % damage mitigation. This isn't to say CSS full time isn't bad, but I'd recommend it as a backup to normal armor or for those "just in case" moments.
---
How can an opinion based on personal experience be wrong or right?
---
Your opinion is just as valid as mine.
---
Just use the search button on this sub. There are some crazy good guides that will make you level up easier. Worked amazing during the double-exp weekend.
---
Well I saw 1 in a person's vendor (for a ludicrous amount of caps), so I don't think they were removed. It's not a devroom item or anything, it's just a useless misc that was used for a cut sidequest.
---
Updoot your updoot because some uncivilized cretin downdooted you.
---
So you have some sort of consequence to dying, even if it’s minuscule.
---
Definitely sound good to me
---
I got like 200 levels saved up and unopened card packs saved up for it.
---
This is the only game I've played where there are better ideas comming from players than the devs. Then again, I've been out of the gaming loop for quite a while.
---
I disagree. If anything they should focus on an upgrade for their servers and implement more features to PvP. Then focus on bringing survival back. In the meantime it would be great to die and suffer different forms of consequences, that are not soft blocked by passive mode. 
---
You can recover your scrap from NPCs by fighting your way through them, but you can't fight your way through some troll who is too chicken shit or laggy to PvP and win your scrap back.
---
I know I said it up above,but I'll say it again. I'd love to see different forms of consequences for dying. Idc if it's a reduction of some kind. At least its possible to fight it lol.
---
In all honesty. This game has one of the best communities. I have about 350 hours of gameplay and have never once come across an asshole. Dunno if that's just me getting lucky. But I stand by my opinion that it's one of the best communities.
---
I'll take anything but sun kissed you join my team with that instant boot
---
That's what I was thinking. If healing was a flat rate, I probably would just go with a medic's zeroVATS.
---
As long as we get a flamethrower guitar and we get to play the Doof's song from Fury Road.
---
What the Op is referring to is the dark vignette pulse that occurs when you walk into a fire source on the ground. Youre not actually on fire or being debuffed in any way so there is no screen indicator.
---
Would you agree with different forms of consequences? Ones that are unrelated to PvP.
---
Incoming blue grass floor texture!

---
Please leave your gamertag at the front desk and a vendor will be with you shortly.
---
Had a very similar experience that ended with me getting killed by a scorched 10 feet away from a storage container and some level 300+ taking my flux as I went to retrieve it.
---
two different versions. scrap and build a generating one
---
I wrote a little bit of it as a reply to another comment.
---
The 40mm grenade machine gun could be sooo much fun instead it's absolute garbage. I got a junkies ffr fr one and tried it out, had a hard time killing low level scorch.
---
I think it happens before it loads your character fully. I run bloodied and I usually have a few seconds of low health without the rad bar loaded in too
---
"rank up" should move you one square ahead on the board at the cost of atoms.  It should be possible to purchase more than one rank at a time.  But then again, it may do something odd, 'cause Bethesda
---
The only time I dropped a nuke specifically on the grove where I knew a Colossus was, there was no one down there fighting it and I wanted to see if a nuke will kill it (FYI it will not). Otherwise I always check, but if I see a bunch of people down there I run down myself to get in on the action before hitting the silo again! I'd like to think most of us high level SBQ nuke-spammers do the same.
---
sadly, no, it just spawns another queen. however, each nuke was launched after the queen before it died
---
And make them even harder to find? That's a fantastic idea!
---
We're all probably sick of this challenge, but we had much worse. Should have been around for the " Take a picture while a bomb drops and another player is naked and fighting 2 aliens and a cryptid" for 10 atoms.
---
Always do Radiation Rumble, Line in the sand, and guided meditation as they give you insane exp.  And figure out your best exp food.  Be either a herbivore or carnivore to get double the benefit as well.  If you don't have either Herbivore is better because it is easier to get and make cranberry relish over tasty squirrel bits.  Lunchoboxs help you and every one around you so open one when in a good number of people during an event and hope the open some as well to get up to 100% bonus exp.  Always be in a builder group at all times.  If there are 4 in it that is 8% bonus exp from the int (its about 2&amp; per point), and use inspirational to get an additonal 15%.  Also get herd mentality and egg head mutations to get more int.  If you get get a unyielding set of armor and keep you health below 20% all of your stats will go up a lot again include int.  Also always remember to sleep for the 5% exp buff from well rested or lover embrace if you did the companion romance.  The only difference between the 2 is the duration.
---
Just put the link in the comments
---
Yeah. I only have the small backpack from the airport. The tadpole challenges are time consuming and near impossible for a solo player.
---
Herd mentality is +4 STR when someone else is in a group and strange in numbers is active. 
---
\+3 if you're alone in a team or no other mutants
---
I agree burn us out on grinds and force players, like most, that want everything to buy ranks
---
I don’t see how this is related to PvP. You could lose your junk completely without anyone, including you, being able to pick it up. Would you prefer that? You could lose aid also like we did in survival mode.
---
Does that work if the video has only been taken on my phone?
---
Agreed 👍
---
seconded.
---
Yeah. I can probably shed some weight so I can get at least needed junk Hahahaha.
---
The public events system is pretty good. I’ve been solo since launch, I’m 262 now. Teamed up about twice and it wasn’t great. Couple days ago I got on a higher level team. Everyone knew what to do. Everyone knew what not to do and let all involved tag legendarys.  Beth has screwed the pooch on a lot of things. Teams was a great add on. I finally understand what the players who have good teams were talking about. I was sad it ended.
---
It's because when you load in your character it's at base weight capacity then it loads in your mutations and armor perks.
---
323 here I level the character to the point of nearly levelling up then wait for the next reset rank up then catch back up for the next days
---
Upload to youtube
---
You might have to put in on a video sharing site.
---
Pharmacy 2 is that the one that reduced mainly stimpak weight?
---
You don’t know how much I wish I had that 🤣
---
5000 Bullion
---
1000 Scrip
---
2000 Ammo Points
---
30000 Caps
---
so do I. why would I turn down 2XP for every event though?
---
Most important thing for a crit build is 33 luck and crit savvy. Fills your critical meter instantly, and makes chaining long range headshots a breeze.
---
o7
---
I like the white white captain cosmos PA. But I'll wear the dark matter the next weeks just to show off😅 it plays a sound when you enter and sometimes a sound when something is running towards you. 
---
The planetarium is okay but could have been bigger and reach longer but they still reach at least 4 foundations in a square and at least 2 walls high.
---
The fire place is okay but all players that leave that door open 😅
---
Did you use the contemporary set?
---
Alright thanks..
---
And i appreciate the guy that downvoted me because im wanting to find something out
---
Even when the game is shit the community makes it worthwhile.😂
---
I’m on console too and I have had all those issues sadly.  PvP is the least of my concerns as I don’t do it much but it’s not been resolved and it’s been an issue since the beginning too.  I had hopes for the redownload stuff fixing some of these issues but it really didn’t.  They aren’t done with the roadmap but I don’t expect it to fix a lot because they’ve not mentioned the guild bank or botting that I’m aware of.  But we digress, both are going to struggle to right the ship completely and I expect issues to continue hopefully just to a lesser extent but this is Bethesda and Co so we’ll continue to have weird things happen.
---
My previous comment was actually intended for another thread lol Sorry about that.
---
Also if the team ends up all over the map, I go my own.  It’s a clear sign that there won’t be team play.  The drop selection of the individual drives a lot of my play style.  When I go pure Bush Wookiee, I generally place in the top 10 and have made team placement of 2nd on my own a bunch of times.
---
I get *two* of them. I play a female character, and when loading in I hear a dude huffing and puffing with cans rattling, followed a second or two later by the female version of the same sound effect.
---
They aren't leaves they are opportunistic. Welcome to wasteland capitalism
---
Very false for some reason I have never seen anyone dupe on xb1, except for the bloke who gave me 7 plans to make a cat head
---
I don’t always do events I’m usually just farming stuff to sell
---
Getting 'random stuff' fits into Fallout perfectly. You may no think it's useful but someone does. With the adding of a CAMP vendor option you can sell it (reasonably priced) and someone may buy it. I do wish they would buy ammo as it would make for easier selling than this Ammo point thing and eating up CAMP budget.
---
Or made the quick perk load out system here sooner rather then later.
---
I understood all of that! Though the childhood home in Ohio is located in what are part of the Appalachia Foothills.
---
With scrapper i get 20-30 steel per launcher
---
why waste time say lot word when few word do trick
---
Plasma, Tesla, Gauss Rifle, Gatling Plasma, all of the good energy weapons need skins. My mad scientist craves fashion!
---
Originally the idea of it existing was to informally challenge someone to PvP. Since they made changes to how it's initiated, it's a bit redundant.
---
I would definitely agree with losing my scrap altogether in different way. Preferably one that has a challenge to it. Maybe a time limit that shrinks each time you die. In a certain time frame. 
---
You'll lose your stuff of course when you die each time. It'll just be a bit harder to recover it if you die consecutively in a certain window.
---
This maybe too severe for most players of course,so this isn't the best example for alternative punishments. Overall though its not as fun when you are unable to face a bigger challenge when you are set back a few steps, all because I can't initiate combat with someone for it.
---
I am 100 hit and don’t know what else to do everything is boring to do the same every day 😂🤣😂🤣
---
I would love to try fried fogcrawler!
---
Me being in a team has no benefit to what I usually do, which is farming, unless there’s an event I’m interested in I’m not really doing anything other than farming for things to sell
---
Yeah, the cannibal perk really gives me an appetite
---
Yah I hear ya on that.... was about to give up on the revive an ally....  was doing my daily events today and lucked out twice thankfully.  Now I just need to do the other stuff eventually but I’m not in a rush
---
Only if you buy stuff from ebay
---
I was having this same conversation with my public team yesterday. This would be wonderful.
---
Yeah I think the white PA definitely looks cooler. Lol on the fireplace door. Can you lock it? Doesn’t surprise me on the planetarium. I guess a small bedroom it is which is kinda what I intended to use it for.
---
workshops have this- was this a vault tec IQ test in terms of what we would complain about?
---
This worked great... just FYI restart the game if you had it open when you moved the file
---
Candy. No, wait that's children
---
Fallout 76 is pay to enjoy the game with the least amount of unnecessary hassle
---
I think there’s one or maybe it’s a Possum Badge were you have to revive a player in water.
---
Not at 2lbs each you wouldn’t
---
At least I can gather up some leaves and burn them. If they're wet I don't just say oh noo I can't dry these off because they wouldn't like that.
---
The radiation just lends it a certain little something.
---
I was legitimately startled the first time i was walking down the deserted highway in the mire in the middle of a foggy night and i see out of the corner of my eye an abandoned van sprout legs and start scuttling towards me.
---
I did
---
Yup, I get it twice in a row now. Really annoying.
---
Just being able to sent one back via Robotics Expert (like the animal ones) would be nice.  That perk card is sadly useless.
---
My biggest issue lately is VATS just not locking on. I'll have complete line of sight and it'll be close I'll hit vats and nothing.I've been having to hip fire a lot lately.
---
^a ^finger ^on ^the ^monkey’s ^paw ^slowly ^curls
---
It was bugged and not taking enough budget when it came out.  They eventually patched it, so the budget was corrected when they did.
---
*me hiding away with my commie backpack and with a history of  accidentally killing mr.gutsys*
---
What perk lowers power armor weight?
---
Or the upright bass riff that plays whenever you get a notification while you're Well Tuned.
---
I discovered that recently and now make sure I'm always in a team, even when I'm solo on my private world
---
The missile launcher is really strong the quad lock on missiles mean you don't need to use vats and it will hunt down groups of enemies very easily.
---
Why wasn't I there? T.T
---
Scorched plague is fake news.
---
Claim a workshop. Build 10 walls. Craft 10 guns.
---
I believe it’s just 9 dailies at 2x score. I was on like an hour ago for a trade and I forgot to check but I feel like I would’ve noticed 18 dailies while I was exiting
---
No. People are turning it off to make the event last longer and farm xp.  Stop turning the jukebox on.
---
Every daily is worth 500 now except leveling up which is 1000.
---
Auto correct fucks me again
---
I would suggest doing those challenges at a workshop.  You dont even have to take one over if you join a public team and your teammate has one
---
You're still a bitch though
---
And farm the legendaries that spawn also.
---
Yeah two shot, quad barrel mod is very good.
---
Some people use the event to farm legendaries and want it to run as long as possible to maximize the spawn rates.
---
Yeah, I would love to do a rocket launcher build.
---
Oh my, that sounds almost impossible
---
BETHESDA!!!!!!!!!!
---
Not in the event I've been playing we keep failing
---
When was it ever an informal challenge to PVP?
---
I would just rather you lose junk period. Other games you would lose progress. Can’t do that in this game, so there needs to be something that makes you want to avoid death.
---
I would have been happy with completing the event.  Whichever one of them started that event wasted their recall card, and I feel bad for them.  Those are not cheap if you have to buy a new one!
---
Well if you died in the real life wasteland your body is definitely going to get looted. And you're definitely not going to get to seek revenge. In that sense, someone taking your loot isn't a "thief".
---
What alternative consequences to player death do you propose?
---
The quad assaultron head has been broken for quite a few months. Any charges above 5 (6-20) Will revert the damage back to a lvl 1 charge. It was good while it lasted though.
---
I think it was a nerf tbh, people were finding ways to one shot the queen with it so they just disabled damage above the 5 threshold.
---
Mammologist, archer and athlete are easiest to do for backpack. Only really revive one player you need someone for. Just go to a public event and ask someone. I done that and first person I asked downed himself so I could revive him.
---
Pc/Steam
---
I understand where your coming from. Just had the event fault 3 times today because of it
---
Just to make sure I'm not being stupid, theres only one in the generators list. Is that the wrong one?
---
Who's forcing anyone? 
---
Bethesda isn't forcing anyone to play any specific way.
---
And quite frankly you can knock out almost all of the dailies and some of the weeklies in less than a half hour.
---
oh that'd be awesome, thanks! i'm good now, if you are too? my user is thatvalindor :)
---
How so? Is it because I'm questioning a pointless mechanic, that once had a point, but no longer really does? People ask these kinds of questions everyday. I mean it's your right to think they're bitches, but you'll go through life hating everyone for real simple shit.
---
Yeah. It’s part of the swimmer challenge. But I think you don’t have to do all of them if your going for only the back pack and maybe 1-2 of the back pack mods.
---
You almost made me spit out my tea.
---
They should also add the wasteland trapper outfit back to the atom shop so I can finally have a proper coon skin hat for my mountaineer outfit. That hat completes the Davy Crockett outfit.
---
And we have all these playable instruments but not fiddle? Wtf?
---
I’d really like a quad quad barrel. Holy shit does this exist? That’s 16 missiles per reload. I’d run it.
---
Incisor, and martial artist
---
You underestimate my love for blowing shit up  :)
---
Sorry to hear that
---
I like the idea itself, but not not music available.
---
So please be prepared to be baited and radiated.
---
Good idea 👍
---
Hey bro, I was in the las two but there was a previous circle, so I guess It was you. Thanks!
---
I got lucky and someone went down in a nuke zone and I was right by him so I just popped him a stim.
---
You on PC? If so I have a gift for you
---
It forces no one. 
---
People are blaming their basic lack of will power on BGS sales tactics.
---
So very many hills in this game....
---
Multiple reasons, presumably. Weeklies give you much more SCORE than dailies, and they likely didn't want to give the boost for a whole week because that's the only way it would be fair to give the boost for weeklies as well. (Otherwise you run into the problem of people who complete the challenge before the pay-out is doubled.)
---
Xbox  :(
---
I appreciate the thought tho
---
The Elders didn’t agree on something. It’s a tale as old as time.
---
I don't mind farming XP Jesus I love it as much as the next person but when. I'm on event team and it fails I miss on out on loads of XP.
---
It's informal because you are not asking someone to fight by shooting at them or asking to fight. 
---
It's like shooting their camp and not them. I agree though. I'd prefer something more challenging or punishing, than to not be able to do anything at all about some prick who thinks he cool for making someone kill themselves, just so they can take their loot.
---
Must. Upvote. To. Support. Very. Bad. Person.
---
Barbarian and blocker don’t give offense but help amazingly for defense if you max your strength tree at 15
---
Edit: Barbarian is not useful if you’re going to be in PA then again no unarmed weapons work in PA so never mind
---
I jump untill I found enough high levels in the public teams
---
That event used to be the best in the game for farming legendaries. It is beyond me why Beth "fixed" it and made it like when assholes showed up and rushed the event.
---
Is that the one where your AP depletes when taking hits? If so, it is sort of annoying if you're relying on VATS. Someone had that perk shared a while ago in my public team and it took me a while to figure out what was happening. But once I figured out what was happening I just let it be.
---
I believe Bethesda made enemies a lot tougher. Had several fights with numerous scorchbeasts recently and their attacks were much more powerful and constant. Also, had one if those female robots kill me instantly without charging up her head, lol. I'm over lvl 600...I had to laugh but this is what we want. We need the Death Claw as the True Alpha Predator of games past...like a 40 foot tall, SBQ swatting monster that requires at least 10 players to kill it or paralyze it long enough to loot it of great rewards. Just my opinion.
---
I’m am convinced that it is impossible to have it either way on a public server. There will always be that one person who keeps turning the jukebox on and the other person who keeps telling them to turn it off. The only way to farm this event for xp and legendaries is on a private server
---
Mammologist you can just server hop at wayway. And cross broken bridge at the rear of it. To your left after crossing bridge from wayward there will be a small level 1 spawn of animals to photograph. Rats, cats, frogs, opossums etc. Keep hopping server until your required animals appear 👍. Tadpole backpack is a game changer
---
I wouldn't say exactly but a first membership allows you a lot more advantages than not having it. Your own private server to take any workshops you want to gather all the ammo/resources you want and an unlimited stash, but i wouldn't count that as pay to win as much as i would count it as something i wish i had bc it would remove a lot of grinding for ammo &amp; resources for me
---
Not sure if your into college football but I missed that bundle and I so desperately want it so I can get my university of Tennessee rifleman character going
---
Meats really help a melee build too. Stingwing meat, Mutant hound meat, Deathclaw steak, Mole rat meat, Glowing meat steak and Sheepsquatch meat. Some add to strength, and two add 25% melee damage.
---
Scorch killer lowers your weapon damage, uses normal ammo and turns your bullets blue.
---
Prime increases your weapon damage but uses ultracite ammo.
---
I have a couple of weapons I've modded to be scorch killer for the tracer effects of the bullets, tracer rounds. "Fake gauss weapons" . These guns are for tagging or trash mobs. The shotguns are for applying status effects and cripple such as enforcer, suppessor, Tenderizer. 
---
I have quad limb DB called "pepper spray" .
---
Quad FFR PUMP called "salt gun".
---
Quad limb combat shotgun called "bean bag" . 
---
I also have JFFR10mm smg modded scorch and it absolutely shreds. Interestingly enough if you mod a submachine gun (tommy gun) scorch, then it INCREASES the fire rate.
---
It’s just my favorite thing to find 40 random missiles in my ammo.....
---
God damnit Badthesda! 
---
Quit forcing me to spend 46 seconds to claim a workshop and build 10 walls! 
---
I mean I barely have time to play, let alone grind that out after spending a minute and 11 seconds crafting 10 weapons, and letting some random buy 3 things off me.
---
I normally just leave the jukebox running it finishes just in time.
---
I do Tenderizer as it's the most useful 1 star I have.
---
Ah thanks!! Now time to get the camera, hahaha.
---
Well said pal!
---
The colossus head mount is a reward from the new colossal problem event which is only live on the pts 
---
The free states are situated in the more so I suggest looking around that region to start their quest line
---
The bug happens with vats shots.
---
I got a vampire bash damage pump action andnit one shots muties with torso shots , woth only 1 point in each of the shotgun damage perks.
---
It would benefit 3 other people for literally zero extra effort on your part.
---
I read a post earlier about this same issue. The problem is people want to farm it but the time limit was lowered by a lot and most of the farmers don’t know that so then they accidentally fail it. If you don’t want to fail you need to have it on for most of the event
---
That's a visual bug related to Nuclear Winter
---
I like this. I like it a lot.
---
Yeah you can only milk it for 2-3 minutes at best
---
Good point I totally forgot about people farming it was trying to finish quick get XP and then next event for more.
---
You have the best attitude out of anyone I've ever called a bitch, I love you.
---
Can you romance Ra Ra?
---
used to be a hell of a lot easier to farm when you had a 30 minute timer, now that there’s a 30 minute timer and a 10 minute timer, wendigo acts on the 10 minute timer now
---
I was wondering about that they lowered the time makes sense now
---
Wendigo has to be summoned by the 10 minute timer now, not the 30
---
ok cool ill add you now, just booting up the game
---
Yeah once the ten minutes is up you fail if not at full bar
---
I'm not sure, but anything would be better than trolls feeling more encouraged to make someone commit suicide by jumping in front of people.
---
Also in the real wasteland you wouldn't respawn. Lol.
---
My basis is around the mechanics of this game. They were striving towards a system where you could get your stuff back by way of dueling someone. If that is no longer an option because they made a patch to change the initiation, then it's now flawed, because it no longer serves its original purpose.
---
Thus there should be a new system introduced that makes more sense.
---
Ok im interested ive always nuked whitesprings and the queen so does ward sleep through this lol
---
It's hard to say what went wrong but basicly you client said you did damage but the server said you didn't. It happens alot to shotguns.
---
This isn't answering your question BUT....why not just get the outfit on the new char?
---
They're one of the only worthwhile things using at the shitty ammo converter. That's all II do with them now.
---
If you don’t have enough music played by that 10 minute timer, you’ll fail. That’s why everyone leaves it running. You can’t farm the event for 30 minutes anymore
---
Everything literally says pacify only, I watched the video and spent the past half hour hopping worlds in the spot he told me and never saw a single spawn anything. Not worth it.
---
Oh yeah. 100% legendary modules. I made this post because I'm debating making a stealth set out of thorn armor. More script to make but guaranteed 3 star plus bonus set effect
---
They posted on Twitter that there would not be one today.
---
Yeah. Alot of people complaining about the grind....
---
Yet I somehow start a lot of coffee. Hop on 76 and complete nearly all of the daily challenges by the time it's done brewing. 
---
And if you are ok with this 11 minutes of "grinding".... You're a bootlicker or a sheep.
---
Iron fist does not benefit ?
---
Haven't tried to lock it but is in the door category so I would presume that you can. I can answer that question tomorrow. Yeah i placed 2 by my vendors gets a little messy with all that crazy lighting 😅 the chickens to the tree whit the cage are also great😅
---
sent, let me know if you receive my friend request
---
Would like to chime in as another person with hearing loss, I would also love to see the radio drama’s get subtitles. Thank you!
---
Yep have those on my planned build
---
While generally I think Bethesda does it well enough(Not Zenimax-ESO is a money pit), I agree. Destiny was such a fun game and I even bought the season pass. Only to be told that the season pass didn’t actually cover all the dlc like every other season pass has always done... i get they left halo which cost them a lot of easy money but it was a very underhanded way of doing it and they didn’t make it clear at all. Then they released a 2nd game which really just improved aspects of the game that were already built into the previous title and could have easily been a major dlc expansion instead of a whole other game. It’s scary when I think Ubisoft is actually one of the better companies to handle paid content post release
---
Great! Settlers - pack rat and contractor perks and END boost? And maybe a chance of faction specific bonus rewards added for all quests.
---
I'm level 354. It's not worth it. I don't feel like using a stupid min-max build and grinding the same boring spot for 2 hours every day. I just keep making a new character, doing the flatwoods quests once a day, then deleting and making a new one when its done. Once or twice a week my main levels up so I don't have to do it on that day
---
Yes, iron fist. Sorry I assumed that was a given. Those three together
---
Pretty sure  the perk points are per character, not account wide. Only the number of slots is shared.
---
Correct. I don't carry more than 10 of any aid as the junk can add up fast. Unless you craft chems, you should sell any aid you don't use. I've never had to use more than 10 stimpacks or radaway in a session  before I find or acquire more. If you use mutations, dilute all of your radx and only use diluted radx as it doesn't effect your mutations. I don't carry more than 5 of these.
---
Oh good, cause that’s not happening... lol
---
i just accepted it!
---
Back when there was more PVP it made sense, it would be annoying AF having someone spamming one of those at you. Not really a good reason for it to be so weak now though.
---
I just want a larger camp budget
---
This is a really great suggestion honestly. I'd suggest posting it on the PTS forums, where it has 100% chance of being at least read by the Community Managers, although they won't respond there.
---
Otherwise tag them in a comment here, either way this is something Bethesda needs to see IMO.
---
Vats biggest issue is people don't understand it and it does have a bug when firing from low elevation like from stealth.
---
The solution is vats very quickly and jump before firing, not ideal but that's how to get it to work.
---
For the server/client calculations they take hip fire accuracy into account so that may be where you see no damage even if you see numbers.
---
Basically it didn't hit due to another vats calculation, weapon accuracy.
---
They never explained this change during wastelanders launch but it makes sense, I believe some guns have horrible hip fire accuracy like handmade's so they get the most effected.
---
No it’s the one that makes it easier to hide if you duck. I cannot imagine why anyone would object to it.
---
I guess your the one calling the shots then
---
Just use the ammo converter you silly sarsaparilla
---
There should be a poll to see what system this is affecting the most people on. I haven’t thought about it. But, I’ve had zero issues on PS4.
---
No prob just wanted to make sure as it is my first time going for melee xD
---
* Yes, but the addition of him into Vault 51 is intentional. You don't mention Braun like that without it meaning something.
---
* I do. And your past performance gets mentioned even if you fail. Where you die.
---
* Except that there's lots of other people about. Raiders, Supermutants, etc.
---
* The timeline thing is still an issue. The in vault records say the previous Overseer escaped in 2078. We're in 2073. You can find his records of his escape and attempt to find Vault 76 in world in 2073.
---
* Nuking things a lot doesn't cause an otherwise fine location to get overwhelmed by a ring of fire. A virtual reality hell designed to test people over and over? That does.
---
Basically, I'm of the firm opinion it's a simulation, that the people in NW are being tortured over and over and over for data. It fits far better into the way Vault Tec operates, as well as the world itself.
---
I suggest replacing Ironclad with Adamantium Skeleton. I don’t like Ironclad because DR has diminishing returns and it’s not hard to have high DR from armor. Adamantium Skeleton will prevent your limbs from being crippled. Alternatively, you could use Lifegiver for the auto-health regeneration bug associated with adrenal reaction and speed demon. I assumed you’re using Rejuvenated for this bug, since you just need a health bonus and the mutations. With Lifegiver, you won’t have to eat to maintain the health regeneration.
---
If you haven’t seen it yet, I recommend you check out Angry Turtle’s unarmed stealth bloodied build video on YouTube. He introduces his build by killing the scorchbeast queen in 4 hits. He could give you better advice than I can.
---
Ok that’s what I last read. Wasn’t sure if they had said anything else. I’m sure they will add a F1st bonus I just really want to know how big it is, as there’s no way $100 a year is worth me playing this game till Cyberpunk and AC Valhalla come out
---
I always get the stuff before that quest for the very same reason.
---
edit: removed confusing and bad sentence
---
Last week I was hanging at the overseers camp, waiting to open a lunchbox for the next bunch of noobs that showed up and some guy dropped 5000 (yes five thousand) large gift boxes.
---
Like all the fucking time
---
If i go to a players camp and see that something needs to be repaired i will repair it so maybe some players have been repairing your camp little by little when you're not at home?
---
Ty I’ll check it out
---
I've noticed that my weapons wheel is glitching and the SQ isn't landing. I've heard other players say that it's because people are shooting and staggering her in midair, causing her behavior patterns to constantly reset. I.E She should scream, piss mist, scream, piss mist, and land (or whatever it's supposed to be) I don't know how accurate that is though.
---
get everything first before you start the quest only get the radstag and tatos
---
pay to ban  
---
just kidding  
---
no, fo1st doesn't grant you any privileges against other players it's just easier to store your scrap and place a tent.  
---
first one can be achieved via your friend and your alt character used as store donkey  
---
private server - only if you want to play solo/with friends, not a big deal  
---
tent - yep, useful thing for free tp and moving your trash into boxes
---
Mini-nukes should be rare, but extremely powerful, they’re far too weak, and almost too common, reducing the chance you get one and upping the damage would turn them into a true endgame weapon.
---
I don't often kill NPC's who don't shoot first, but when I do it's cannibals...
---
Except it doesn't explain how Morgantown and Flatwoods are burned more than once. Where does Zex keep getting people? How is the world pristine and being burned by nuclear fire once again every time he has enough people? How does selecting our location work?
---
Again it's not idea but leaving and re-entering vats is another key part of vats.
---
I believe this happens when the AI get 0% vats chance for any period when you start vats.
---
You notice this the most with short range weapons like flamethrowers.
---
Collectron Phrase "More Junk For the Trunk"
---
This one was masterfully dubbed in Italian as well, unlike the extremely annoying Dane Rogers. I ended up actively skipping One Violent Night because the lenghty intro to the event is so bad.
---
Note to any 1st members- I have never had issues logging straight into private world after reset -knock on wood-
---
They are alwaysa guaranteed 3* legendary?
---
I actually enjoy the mini nukes since I have a bloodied fatman, but ya fuck missles who actually uses rocket launchers.
---
Those are mostly explained as functions of the game as a game 
---
Nuclear Winter wouldn't be fun if you could only play it once
---
I hear you pal I am level 782 , 5000 hours or more I didn’t dupe but got the ban , they still took payment yesterday, i don’t know where they’re sending my emails to if they are I can’t get into Bethesda account either to find out anything, every one knows they ban players for this exploit I wouldn’t run the risk of a ban on 5000 hours grinding every day from launch , whose the guy giving it the Barry is he taking the p out of us that got banned for no duping after getting away with it himself hhmmm fishy that
---
I like this idea!  I think to expand on it, certain POIs should be unlocked as free Fast Travel points based on your faction choice.
---
**Responders** \- Flatwoods
---
(**Crater**) **Raiders** \- Crater (duh)
---
**Blood Eagles** \- ???
---
**BOS** \- Fort Defiance, or maybe Atlas Observatory
---
**Enclave** \- Whitespring Bunker
---
Borg invasion?
---
Since they nerfed the timer, turning off the jujebox is actually a negative since it might prevent the spawning of the one guaranteed legendary this event has.
---
I've just posted the exact same thing I thought it was cause it always says activate no matter if it's on or off.
---
one in generators and one in misc. 
---
if you built one before then it's probably the misc structures one
---
My TS/25/25 says otherwise. Going against high leveled Scorched, Anglers, it two shots em, plus it hits the Queen nicely. Vats turns 40mm into heat seeking missiles. The only downfall is the ammo capacity &amp; how quickly it breaks
---
I know it's not a single sound effect but I find the nature ambiance along the Ohio river is really nice. I walk along the water's edge to collect snap tail reeds and sometimes stop to get a drink or look at my phone. And I catch my self looking up at the screen after listening to the birds and crickets chirping for a minute and always think to my self how good it sounds. The Mire ambiance is pretty damn good as well.
---
wait what?  Now I'm sad I already did my weeklies, except for the repeatable :(
---
What mask is that and where can I find it?
---
I've gotten tons of perk packs. It just refuses to complete it in the list of challenges.
---
Ward is already a 3* Legendary with all his powers, what does he become after the nuke?
---
Therefore you would benefit from an intelligence gain.
---
Community: can we have more weapon skin diversity combat rifles, laser weapons etc.
---
Bethesda: DId YoU sAy YoU wAnTeD hAndMadE SkIns?
---
Primed Ultracite Gatling Laser, or Gatling Laser.  Can't be used in Power Armor... but it would be nice if you could upgrade your Power Armor in some way to actually use them.  Kinda sucks to have to split core inventory between some for my suit, and some for my gun.
---
Nobody who plays BRs is going to play it.  There are too many better options.  I honestly doubt it would get much traction.
---
It also seems to be an afterthought for Bethesda nowadays.
---
Yeah you definitely don't need that 60 dr. Even Pain Train might serve you better than that perk.
---
Quick question, could you hear my mic decently?, i never use it in-game
---
That would be quite cool, I enjoy C.A.M.P buulding I end up treating the game like sims wasteland edition hahaha
---
Super Saiyan I think
---
She landed plenty of times for me today but there have been a few where she just won't land at all and sometimes she will just chill in the air not even moving lmao
---
I agree! I recently made a post about being able to have instruments we can play and form a matching band! Event have an event about it!
---
It’s called the Surgical Mask! It’s sold at Sutton Station and Pleasant Valley Station
---
Idk man, I think getting bonus xp on the building team is good for any playing style.
---
I’ve sold flux in my vending. I always keep a handy supply.
---
Ah. Thanks. I assume they fixed pain train? I read there was a bug where you could glitch out some NPCs if you accidentally sprinted into them. It’ll cause them to be stuck in a stagger and prevent you from talking to them.
---
Welcome to the release of Wastelanders
---
This is when the problems with VATS started and they have been thoroughly documented in streams, vods, and on youtube since.
---
It would be nice if bethesda would at least acknowledge the issue.
---
the New issue is the phantom shot phenomenon 
---
you hit the button the shot is heard, the weapon performs the animation, the ammo count goes down, but the round is not actually fired, literally nothing happens to the target and it just keep happening. Sometimes equiping another weapon then switching back will help but once it starts it just seems to keep coming back.
---
I've been using a Two-shot Lever Action for many months... and I'm noticing this occur with VATS when using that weapon, too. Non-VATS and I see 2 damage numbers, but lately if I use VATS, it'll only show 1 damage number.
---
Yes. Not very often. Goes for about 100 caps per usually
---
I get two as well. It started with The Legendary Run update IIRC, it might have to do with the overencumbered after dying fix.
---
I started a new character and if I don't feel like leveling up my high levels I just go level him up. Plus I've been giving him my extra scrip. I'm level 6 and I've got a level 1 VE hunting rifle level 5 B LD hunting rifle and a 1* level 5 instigating pump action. All from mumbles.
---
Some do.  But be careful.  Some people set traps that kill you and then they take it back since it counts as junk.
---
Better off looking for them on the market sub.
---
"Hey you, you're finally awake"
---
Oh, didn't know this. Is the 30 minute timer completely irrelevant and now just cosmetic?
---
Yeah if they become untargetable at any point like running behind another enemy all vats damage well be zero after that.
---
Agree, other loot based games have loot highlighting as a basic function. 
---
OP is asking for a quality of life feature, but then asking for an extra hoop to jump through by having it be a perk for no apparent reason.
---
I think it probably is other players repairing bits and pieces of your CAMP.  I've wanted a regeneration mechanic, though, to counter the endless pot shots of enemies.
---
Haven't failed it yet but we got close the other day.  Queen just fucked off into the nuke zone so a few players had to run in a pull her back out, she landed just outside the zone and we finished her off with a few minutes to spare.
---
People really need to stop shooting her while in the air, just get off your damn tent and wait on the ground for her to target and land, then hop back on your tent.
---
Now this gave me a good laugh😂😂
---
An investor would likely say “hold” at this point in time. It’s become common due to that last vendor dupe issue (Mr Fuzzy tokens) and has really lost its value.
---
I'm pretty sure that bug is still active.
---
I was showing massive damage but I just couldn't get it to work.
---
This is in poor taste, i don't really feel THIS is the place for this. I come here to get away from this.
---
Line in the sand is amazing with the glitch. I use a TS Tesla and tag all the enemies, last weekend with 4 lunchboxes active I went up from level 216 to level 223, all the SCORE.
---
Wolf's voice reminds me a lot of Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager.
---
Yeah there is a fire rate bug, for shotguns it's due to having so many pellets for the server to calculate.
---
That would be nice, cubic building space would give me more space overall.
---
Dindt had a fail in a year...gotta have some high damage players in server,or 1 bloodied unarmed 😆
---
the missle launcher has a really cool tracking mod too, it makes a tone when it locks a target and its a direct hit no matter where you are aiming when you shoot! add a quad barrel and a nice instigating legendary effect, and you would think the thing would be incredible...but nope still sucks :(
---
Yes. Hard to find tho since they show up as "Junk". I usually hop about 20 vendors before finding someone with flux. Prices vary usually from 200 per flux to 500.
---
You can´t force others to play to your liking.
---
If you want to complete the event so bad, go collect ores instead of being the game police and impose your own "justice"
---
new new. not old new. no old new, just new new.
---
When I went to see Ward he was putting his hands over the fire pit like he is freezing and in a fully dawned hazmat suit and the settlers keep commenting on how they feel like a war is being launched on them.
---
I was thinking the same as the other guys here - it’s kind players fixing what they can as they visit. You can avoid fixing anything by just moving your camp - everything is restored when you do that.
---
As far as I know, I tried to solo it a while back, right after Wastelanders it seems...10 minute timer hit 10 minutes it told me event failed. With the jukebox playing nonstop and doesn’t get destroyed or need repair, takes about five minutes off of the 30 minute timer and the wendigo shows...I think that second timer is for the Windygo, but the bar I think it’s just a progress bar not necessarily a countdown bar. Because I filled that bottom bar up in less than 10 minutes.
---
ah i actually have all mics muted, sorry! thanks so much for your help though!!
---
Lmao, I remember one day me and my buddy hopped on and we out doing random stuff and some guy had aimed a nuke at my buddies camp and no one realized. So when we go to return and see that there is now a giant red circle where our homes use to be, took so many resources to rebuild it. Never figured out why they targeted us or who even did. Lol to say the least my camp is no longer next to my friends. Don’t know who he’s messing with, lmao
---
I'm just now remembering, reading this post, that it's double *dailies* weekend not double score weekend. I read it on beth's website yet still held off on my weeklies thinking I could get double on them if I waited.  🤦‍♀️
---
Hi, how did you get the candles in the windows? Mine won't sit inside no matter how I try to position them.
---
But yeah, I haven’t been able to draw that thing out longer than 10 minutes in a couple of months
---
It works for me
---
Yeah I guess those go without saying huh
---
no worries mate, hve fun with your new character.
---
I can sell you some
---
Actually, it is.
---
When you’re a small time company trying to start off in the industry say, Indie games for example. You move the heavens and the earth to make sure your product is flawless. And if there’s bugs? You get that shit sorted ASAP. Because you NEED to keep your customers happy.
---
Bethesda? So what if they piss me or a few others off? That arrogance of AAA companies thinking because they have such a large presence in the industry excuses them from having a “Quality over quantity” mindset is why so much shit gets through PTS and even from their last game, the location of their development team has nothing to do with it but if you honestly want to use reason to help you log in and play their game, power to you mate.
---
Ok. Thanks. I don’t remember if they said it was a visual bug and it did reduce the negative effect but on the stat screen still showed -50% or what
---
Nah, some people need to be reminded daily.
---
ecological balance, three scrip and crap.  I will do that but I usually only get the tapes if I am in the area
---
only thing they need to be focused on is fixing the autocomplete bug.
---
Commando
---
Don't forget that there's some people that let you die on purpose after the SBQ and pick up all your loot and ruin your day after you finally have enough materials to upgrade or create an item
---
The 'farmers' usually a) don't realise that you can no longer both farm effectively and complete the event, and b) are generally the sort to sit outside and one shot everything the moment it spawns because they never learnt to share. So I will always fight to keep the music on. Because then at least everyone gets the end xp.
---
Even people who know this don't collect ore.
---
I have grounded on to deal with Tesla’s and legacies and my one star junkies tesla still cleans up shop.
---
It's annoying, but people tend to be tunnel visioned on the legendary run at the moment. I've had numerous events where all people care about is tagging as many ghouls as possible for the EXP. It's pretty good EXP tbh.
---
This is a flaw with the run, it's more rewarding to farm EXP than do the objectives or be courteous to other players. I have noticed a lot of uranium fevers where people just go apeshit on the miners because all they care about is EXP, the legendary supervisors being obliterated before they even come out of the ground.
---
I have failed once but wasn’t aware of this timer update. Not common knowledge imo. Maybe it was in their news? I don’t read them
---
Does leveling get slower and slower each time you level up? Is there no max cap on this?
---
Ecological balance. Just terrible. Walking around and being in load screens. 
---
I will never do that daily again.
---
Not trying to be in poor taste at all! There’s plenty of other post for you to look at so don’t worry too much!
---
I run blocker and lock and load most of the time in addition to the 9 points in heavy guns. I change out those 6 cards pretty often depending on what I’m doing, however.
---
But they did make the light in the corner of the Wytoga train station brighter about a year ago. What more bug fixes can you want.
---
Easy work to slap a few skins onto an already created asset, but fixing that asset? Are you kidding? This is 2020 don’t be absurd! #moreskinsforthepeople 
---
I mean, if they just added some kind of "Public Team Search" system, we could skip the hours of just trying to randomly join teams....
---
It's almost like they didn't want us to complete those challenges by not giving us the exact tool at the exact time, that would make it take a mere few moments.
---
If they just add the keywords and slots, both base skins won't be applicable on the other.
---
If they create new OMODS for Fixer skin and Combat rifle skin, then set the MODCOL to point at the intended 'standard skin', we would be able to apply ALL the skins.
---
Make sure they knock it out of the park by doing this. It's a few minutes more work, but it's very worth it!
---
Everytime I nuke Foundation and farm it I get a 3* star but could just be that im extremely lucky. But pretty sure anywhere you nuke there will always be a 3*
---
Bethesda need to either:
---
1. Let us sell explosive ammo to merchants
---
2. Reduce the weight of explosive ammo
---
3. Increase the damage of Explosive ammo
---
Right now only 40mm are even vaguely viable to use
---
I've got a level 15 one if those that does the same. No perks either.
---
Join any of the new public teams, press M, press T, click.
---
Just bored at work so I started a post for fun.  Just to see what other peoples least favorite is.
---
This one isn't even half over, so you've got time. It ends in mid September.
---
Let us play music with the guitar sword death tambo and war drum
---
I’m not sure if it was in an ITV or anything, I had just recently learned how to farm it for 30 minutes and finally convinced my brother the farm it with me and to relax on the music and then it got changed. I never read or heard anything about it. Next time you do it pay attention to the two timers and see what you think. If you can get it to go longer than 10 minutes, please let me know how. Monster mash is my new legendary farm
---
Definitely this.
---
You also hear it when you exit to Main Menu and the gear is unequipped from the character.
---
Were you last logged into the game in NW mode?
---
As of yesterday I had zero issues too. Today, however...
---
Does that one connect with wires like the other generators?
---
Yup!
---
Hell no. 
---
You want fun? 
---
Stand around a group of players and drop a bag full of missiles.... Watch them swarm and then spam the confused emote.
---
Ah thanks for the example. So they either fixed it or it was visual. I got Grounded and wanted to know if class freak works on it.
---
It was more a comment to the other guy saying that they are doing that to make us buy FO1st lol
---
I personally received 3 missiles once and proceeded right to the Atom store this is of course because Todd Howard wouldn't leave my home until I did and he is a terrible house guest.
---
Thanks for the monster mash tip as well
---
What system u on?
---
If l want to complete it, I just play music by myself and make their efforts in vain.
---
I don't see this as a problem, you could always make higher level friends and then team up before joining a server (then have others join your sever)
---
I'm pretty sure that their process is simply to fill servers to limit server loads where possible, they aren't going to concern themselves with the levels of the character.
---
True. I can always test to see which I like better. And change it up
---
They ever fix the quantum nades? Fucking range was smaller than a radroach last I checked in patch 19, with all the perks
---
Heck ya!! Great ideas!
---
Heyyyyyyyy someone genuinely thought no one in this game would have 10’s of thousands of rounds of ammo and placing in 5 different menus was a great idea. But hey welcome to 2020! Kick off the traction and things get change! Even things that shouldn’t have happened in the first place -.-
---
It's fun to set them off near a new player's camp and watch them panic.....
---
Just drop em some Stims and such afterwards to balance out the karma
---
not a damage card.. but youll want to run max Blocker if youre not already..
---
ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game.. especially if youre gonna be in mobs faces all the time...
---
Oh that one. I actually liked that one when someone shared it a while ago so I incorporated it into my build since I'm respeccing anyway.
---
Something server side said you missed basically. It might have something to do with staying in vats to long.
---
I get in and out as fast as my hands can move and I experience very little issue.
---
I think monster mash is awesome, granted it is a PVP event. I walked out of there with eight legendary’s The other night, did it again about an hour later when it popped back up and got one. Hit or miss with MM
---
Thsnk you!
---
Good info, thanks.  Realizing now ive only done it a few times over past month or so.  And prob failed a couple times and never thought about checking.
---
Perfect!!
---
Yeah been hopping around, not many vendors with anything in junk
---
Those are still
---
Animals
---
I’m not a fixer/combat rifle user but I totally agree, the fixer bro’s deserve some love! It also like to see reskins like the Screaming eagle paint for the Light Machine Gun. It’s my favourite weapon but it rather use something red-blooded American like the M-60 or M249 style weapons, rather than use Hitlers Buzzsaw
---
Ward!  He is probably stuck in the floor
---
Yeah, don't know. Sucks for you, sorry.  I just Rank 55 today though.
---
Invite me. Chipper7773
---
Doesn't affect weeklies
---
Thank you kind Vault Dweller!!
---
If I strip will I get payed?
---
You got both perks on? Cranberry glade is better imo. Found a deathclaw and a megasloth today
---
Are server region based?
---
Is it supposed to be a bloody build?
---
I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to accomplish with those perk card choices.
---
Yeah both are on, nothing says tame.
---
I have a two shot ffr quad (something else but it’s awesome) missile launcher with the auto target on. It’s damage is like 800 to start, but of course it never actually comes anywhere near that. Maybe if I added the explosive perks it might be a little more viable, but I can’t see myself using it for more than like vertibirds or slow, far away enemies. Which is very disappointing :(
---
It sucks too, that used to be an amazing event when you could farm it....I think I walked out of there with seven or eight one time, but it was usually a guaranteed 3 to 5. I did it a few days ago and the only thing that showed up legendary was the Wendigo
---
I agree that it is meant to be mobile but god dam at least remove over half the “existing locations” crap, there is so much potential to have some really beautiful camps made with the environment and buildings already around but “in fallout 76 you can do what you want! Just not that.”
---
Weird. If you go cranberry glade you'll find something really quick hopefully
---
Xbox in general has just been going down hill once the game was added to the game pass I’ve only done 2-3 queen that I didn’t start my self when weeks prior I would do 10-15 of them a week. Idk it just suck seeing a server full to the brim but there’s only a couple high levels (100+) and nothing being done. It’s just crazy and it just doesn’t fell the same. I see no workshops I can fight at or nothing. It’s just a sad time when you get into those servers.
---
If you were on PS4 I'd give you some. I have a lot. Haha
---
There is a “Charging” barrel that add damage if you charge for a couple of seconds. There are also semi automatic and automatic barrels which might be what you’re seeing.
---
Srry yeah it is a bloody build to cap on my own damage and also play support in a team kinda gotten bored lone golfing thru everything
---
Good luck with it.
---
You can't do the event unless at least 3 people are gathering ore. Is it too much to ask that people actually play the event to get better rewards. It's fine that the basement dwelling level 600 has got all the event rewards and is xp farming but what about when they didn't. It's just a toxic way and attitude to have when going to a public event not to mention selfish. Almost as bad as slapping event bosses before anyone gets a hit instead of tapping them so others can get loot and xp.
---
What am I even looking for, most animals say only pacify even if they are alone. Found a lone scorched deathclaw, only said pacify, found a lone megasloth, only said pacify. I dont get.
---
Edit: shouldn't say most, they all do.
---
Okay so it's hip fire accuracy, for guass weopons there accuracy is more determined from this and not vats chance since I can snipe with my pistol across the map with very little perception.
---
Its weird and not very well explained. Normal guns use vats chance while projectile weapons use hip fire accuracy.
---
So no recomends
---
More specifically, enough ore needs to be collected to get thru Phase 1 (the first full bar). I believe there’s 4 phases, rewards go up the higher you go, but filling that progress bar just once is all that’s needed to get event credit.
---
I mean there are plenty of skins that do that now
---
I put 10 plasma core into her one day, and she just laughed. Seems every now and then she just a damage proof.

Nope, mostly all wins. Have just now quit in the middle of one though because a group of level 100 PA nubs thought it was awesome fun fighting her in the blast zone while all us bloodied types got to sit around by station delta watching. 9 minutes left and she'd just mutated so that wasn't happening.
---
You have to walk up to it to tame it? The animal shouldn't be hostile if it's tameable. Then walk up to him and it should prompt  to tame
---
Herd mentality with strange in numbers actually gives +3 to all special and if you have marsupial (which most people do) gives you even more jump heigh at an extra 5 lbs of carry weight
---
This was the first thing I thought about when I saw the terminal interface, however I think the real reason that it was designed like this was to avoid any further dupe methods. Bethesda just doesn't seem to have a handle on trade based interfaces, each time they introduce an atomic shop item with trade options or new vendor feature...someone figures out a way to break it and exploit it.
---
I thought it was +2 in a group and +3 with Strange In Numbers, no? I’ve been using it forever and never saw it go to +4, what could I be doing wrong?
---
You know they're broke, right?
---
Upvote for the lulz
---
I agree. I feel like they are just using it for XP and don't care about completing the event.
---
Posted this earlier. Thread was full of weebs saying suck it up
---
The background creates the atmosphere that the character is an 1950's Actress getting ready for a part in an Medical Soap.

&gt; 2000 Ammo Points 
---
Supposedly 100,000 "soon"
---
I know but i mean clean looking ones that look like vending machines or terminal's
---
Either way I have 375+ extra cards
---
That doesn’t satisfy my curiosity if it’s affecting people on certain systems more than others though
---
Everything so far encountered has been hostile and even with both perks maxed out and equipped I never get the option to tame.
---
Another solution when they fix the ammo converter is to have them at foundation and crater, the give reasonable points which I’m sure will be revised in this overhaul but then I get get my nukes and dump them into glorious fusion cells 😍
---
Yep, we'll see, August 4th. :)
---
bug is still active
---
Oh yeah I’d love to have FO76 on PS5 with faster loading and better graphics. Hope they will make it on next-gen consoles like GTA online did.
---
You are correct. +2 / +3 with strange in numbers.
---
I mean its not what I personally would choose, the team stuff in this game don't really work well.
---
But if you're going to be bloody you really should have serendipity under luck
---
And if youre going to run heavy guns bear arms for weight and the perk to reload them faster are nice.
---
Also perk to make fusion cores last longer.
---
A build doesn't have to be min max though as long as you have fun with it.
---
Im on pc. I can help you out if you still need it.
---
Yeah, the animal shouldn't be hostile if it's tameable. Should just be pacing around.
---
Have your friend relaunch his game. That usually clears up social menu issues.
---
Smgs count as automatic rifles, so any perks that apply to them work. Commando, tank killer and tormentor come to mind.
---
Thank you so much, really appreciate it!
---
From your post it sounds like you've stopped playing because of that daily though
---
Picked up enough stuff to make ultracite ammo, now just need more to convert plasma caster to prime.
---
Yw. Welcome to the wastelands
---
Does the reload perk work in pa now. I also only plan on carrying 3 guns so weight isnt a problem
---
I got Fusion on my first try by doing the one by the swamp. I forget the name, very tedious and annoying quest...but...must...collect...plans...
---
Most of the players I've encountered in these events tend to be trigger-happy and seem to have the need to tag EVERYTHING as if their lives depended on it. For RR, I would have to agree that it farming the enemies for xp is probably more beneficial than doing the actual event though. Main problem is that since most players are always trying to kill everything, there's usually not at least 1 player guarding each tunnel.
---
Seriously? If I ever play the event again I will certainly throw on a hazmat suit and collect ore.
---
All I can think of is the minstrels from Monty Python andthe Holy Grail. ‘When danger reared it’s ugly head. He bravely turned his tail and fled, brave brave brave Sir Robin’
---
Aye. it connects near the bottom
---
It’s easy to miss the option. That said, I did, so I decided the decent thing to do would be support my team. Glad I did, we won. Now I generally join teams and help, it’s actually more interesting than Bush Wookiee-ing, even if I’m not much help. I can revive and share equipment. But I can always fall back on the bush if the team dies or never actually forms.
---
On PC it helps to do everything from main menu screen and not in game lobby. Pc. But you can try it.
---
People who bought the game have the right to do whatever they want in their gameplay. If they have no intentions to complete the event, then it's their prerrogative.
---
So yes, it is too much to ask to control other people's objectives and actions.
---
Starting to think they don't exist, cranberry glade only spawning mirelurk queens back to back.
---
Jesus. That sucks. I’m only level 40 something and I still only tag enemies
---
I do and can't keep the stuff in stock at 200c which tells me that other people aren't selling it. I rarely if ever see it in other vendors.
---
Perfect end-repeatable reward!
---
Now I know. Thank you!
---
Buried with honor and Waste not (red rocket cores) appear for me every day.
---
Good luck getting mods approved in a multiplayer, revenue generating game
---
I thought FOR SURE this was gonna end with you thinking this at someone's house in real life! Lol
---
The random encounter spawn for cranberry glade is when you first fast travel btw. In the car park.
---
Wait what? Really???
---
Oh btw, I just went to check out your camp and a bunch of Super Mutants just destroyed a bunch. Lmao
---
Event: *completes*
---
My character: *gasps and can’t run*
---
Today it was me guarding one opening and 5 low level players guarding the other.
---
Well it is west Virginia
---
Might have to start adding that into my store selection.
---
I have the best prices in town. I WILL NOT BE BEAT. That's my guarantee, fresh from the vault? let me know and I'll give you a care package with ANY purchase. I don't care if it's an arrow. All ammo 1 cap, all random plans only 8 caps! Have I gone mad? Yes. Mad at all the other stores with high prices...so come on buy for a deal and enjoy the fine scenery while you're there. Pictures welcome.
---
Thanks, its been taken care of.
---
I was just about to say "I feel that visible gridlines would be a great compromise"
---
If you're referring to the lunch boxes, I've only had them not work once or twice. And they weren't mine.
---
well yes, I’ve been playing for over a year and I have been always using it
---
It still takes three people to get max rewards as one person can really only get about 40-50 ore. I was once in one big group that finished in 2 minutes. That was the first night of public groups.
---
Power attacking with the death tambo produces a nice little jingle.
---
That is annoying that automatically weapons get it so easy. I guess ammo cost?
---
Thats what Ive assumed.  Been slowly working on finding it since I got the plans.
---
😁
---
I have the same issue with gramps after patch 20
---
Yeah they do that. I need to move. Neighbours are a constant pain lol
---
Wheres your camp? I've got a high yield ICBM waiting for it.
---
Little tip use the small wooden defense walls as a railing on your roof top garden. They take the bullets before my plants making repairs pretty easy.
---
There's much quicker ways to get resources. Workshops are the slowest way to gain resources.
---
Yeah I’m forever looking for that magic group to get the fancy edition hazmat suit
---
1. Fix bugs.
---
2. Everything else.
---
Ultra cute fusion cores make you look *ultra* cute for a limited time and they give all your stats an *Ulta* (+5) boost when you eat 1. Also when displayed they appear to have a glitch that makes them look super cute (if you inspect it, it looks like a normal fusion core but pink).
---
Note: The glitch will *never* be fixed because everyone loves it to much. 
---
Note: You can change what it looks like.
---
Note: There's also a temporary glitch where it'll make non-legendary NPC's give you a legendary.
---
I was studying while on a private world. Had the power stations going and getting cores. Would just do the retake missions since the defend ones can be a bit involving when you have to be studying.
---
If you don't have a private world, let me know and you can use mine.
---
Its the result of them fixing the bug where you had to manually un equip and re equip all of your armor every time you logged in
---
Killing the Scorchbeast Queen awards a few random stable flux so if you're specced for an end level fight like that and see her pop up, head down and do your thing. Just remember to pop into a survival tent right after and stash it, if you die it disappears and won't be in your junk bag.
---
And drink my blood soaked soda
---
Ha your gonna get down voted by they huge army of casuals on this subreddit. Dude these people can't even figure out how-to hold a pylon or flip a switch
---
+2 cuteness for 1hour
---
Y
---
Ultracite gatling laser is another weapon in itself that uses regular fusion cores. It's my main weapon unless I'm up against the sbq, at which point i switch to the primed laser gatling while in the air, and gatling plasma while she's on the ground
---
It's if more than 4 get opened the xp buff breaks.
---
Someone to talk to, same. I dislike dailies that send me all over, That soil one is kinda annoying as well because I have to upload each individual holotape.
---
Someone to talk to is really annoying though because to not kill some of the targets I have to unequip all of my damage perks then reapply them afterwards. I just unmarked it from my pipboy and stopped doing it.
---
You don't upgrade them, they are whatever level they say they are on them and that's how many points for that stat you need to equip them.
---
At the bottom of the screen there should be an option to view perks you don't own.  If you go in there you can buy perk cards you want with your tickets.
---
Open your perk packs too.  Sounds like you have default cards equipped like it keeps doing to me.
---
Well back in my day "feed the people"  would do just that after completing the event. Everyone on the server got canned meat stew. Nowadays it's just a couple of us that get it. Boy, we old-timers had it made. Those were the good'ol days. Back when events didn't "work as intended".
---
And Bethesda even gave the other Bards their own College!
---
I would love to walk around playing the tuba.
---
So dont open more than 4. I'm happy if I get anything extra from public lobbys. Not everything is going to work perfect.
---
Those people are idiots.
---
Id say no, bandolier and ordnance express probably save you more wieght then rank 5 of SB gives for the dame points
---
That’s decent
---
Just terrible. I'm guessing you won't want to pick any level 3 locks. If you're power armor build then fireproof 3 is just straight up overkill.  Also adrenaline is broken so save yourself all those points.  Get bloody mess to ramp up your damage.
---
Yes more heresy
---
Ive never heard of it not working in power armor...
---
I threw this together based on what you had it keeps some of the spirit of your build being a team support but gets you a bit more out of guns and a little more survivability being a bloody. Its not meta by any means. But for example you didn't have bloody mess that's an easy 15% damage boost for any weapon any build. You also didn't have serendipity to make it fit I had to lower dodgy to 2* but honestly I don't think dodgy is needed I dont run it on any of my bloody stuff.
---

---
You have 30 minutes to get to the beer hall, once the 1st player gets to the beer hall the timer sets to 10 minutes to “make enough ruckus to attract the nightstalker.”
---
Heresy!!!!!!
---
At least you can make them using almost used up fusion cores. Too bad the batteries perk does not apply to them.
---
Radicool? Not a mutation but still.
---
That sounds more annoying than my issue.  At least I'm in the Vault and not getting shot at while dealing with mine.
---
Ah. Ok thanks! Yeah 60-90% reduction or 40 carry weight are probably close
---
If youre still a low level, make sure you do the main quests. 15 caps to move it is a lot when you have 50 caps, but after a 2 hour questing session I logged out with 1600 caps.
---
Ive moved my camp about 10 times so far and Im level 14. Right now its perched in a place quite high above my level, but after watching where all the monsters come from Ive arranged my turrets so everythings pretty much shredded by the time I fire a rifle round at whatevers left.
---
Ive gotten in over my head a couple times sneaking around, but the loot seems better and Im a stones throw from a fusion core spawn and my Collectron is bring home some pretty weird shit hahahaha.  
---
CAMP it up homie! It can definitely make you a more effective player (if for no other reason, you can teleport to camp for free from anywhere)
---
Then the legendary spawns will be slapped in the radiation zones before others can get them like I said 👍
---
It’s a great idea, would keep players going after 100 and they could share the lunchbox XP with other players to help the others still grinding to 100.
---
Ummm... there’s already laser rifle skins and combat rifle skins. We want skins for weapons that don’t have any skins
---
Heart of the enemy does work every day, on occasion you have to return to the computer in the asylum on floor 4. Now queen of the hunt on the other hand...
---
Change characters when you hit 20 notes 👓
---
I guess you guys didnt understand main reason why legendary run exist. Because they are not gettin enough money from atom purchases untill legendary run why they should shot themselves in leg
---
You have no control over other people opening them.
---
Just cause it is broken now doesnt mean it wont be fixed. I dont even need to pick locks anymore
---
Unfortunately, totally different scenarios. GTAV makes so much money it's ridiculous. Seven years later, and GTA V is still in top 5 of sales every month. And I'm pretty sure that's not even counting what they are making on GTA Online. There is no doubt that FO76 makes way less - both in unit sales and in microtransactions.
---
IMO the T65 is an overall better deal.   People who say strangler heart is better are min maxers who think DPS is the only consideration when putting together a build.  So yeah, strangler heart gives a small acid damage bonus.  But you should really weigh that against other factors such as availability of mods.   
---
The mods for strangler heart are ultracite power armor mods, The best ultracite power armor mods are virtually impossible to get. I have killed hundreds of scorched beast queens and have never gotten targeting HUD, emergency protocols, or calibrated shocks. 
---
I don't think you can simply get someone else to mod the strangler heart for you because it is supposed to be untradeable.   I know that there was an exploit that allowed you to trade strangler heart, but I think it may have been patched.
---
Pipe just needs to do more damage at Level 50, and have a .44 receiver selection.
---
I'd love more weapons though. They could emulate it by modifying fire rate, but they're sticking to really basic customization.
---
Mine is a Wendigo jumping out of the trees on the main road into the Mire from North to South. Still scares the shit out of me.
---
I’m always happy for there to be more raiders for me to hunt.
---
It used to be broken back in the day when you could stack luck stupidly high and condition affected Dr on pa pieces. I realized I forgot serendipity so I'm gonna swap that out. Ive never had issues with fusion cores why doin need them to last longer
---
The whole CAMP system feels stymied more than even FO4 which I get is probably limitations, but why couldn't we get a Rust or Ark style building system? So much easier to use and helps beginners get used to it.
---
We are haveing this issue on XBOX.
---
These days you’re lucky to score a shot on the Wendigo, because the same people turning off the jukebox crowd the doorway and one shot it.
---
I'm talking about real skins not lazy made camo skins handmade with screaming eagles and its getting the classic assault rifle skin fallout 3 getting tired of handmade
---
I'm pretty sure the perk **does** apply, I've not noticed my carry weight was impacted by making a bunch of them
---
If they don’t make it on PS5, buying atoms on a dying game is still worth it or not?
---
Just YouTube it. There are several ways to speed up this agonizing process
---
Thanks for all the answers everyone, and especially thanks to zachychan for the exact damage bonus for TSE! Now that I know it does 45% extra, I think i figured it out. When we were comparing the guns, he assured me he removed all damage increasing mods and demolition perks and crafted a new handmade for comparison. I think the problem was that he forgot by default the handmade is semiautomatic- since we both run full commando, the bonus adds up to almost exactly double!
---
Now Im really excited to find myself a junkies handmade and show him what REAL damage looks like!
---
In that case you are no better than everyone else.
---
Omg do you have pics? I wanna see lol
---
Instigating is pretty good for solo playing
---
Dude that is almost exactly how it went down for me today! Whoever nuked the zone must have been a noob bc the site was in the blast zone. I was annoyed the entire time about many things. I turned off the xbox and went to play the sims the second we failed it.
---
I realize. That’s why I put PC twice in my comment. But no one has to spend 5 seconds to try my tip. It probably won’t work anyways. Hope everyone gets their friends added in the near future. Also use complete sentences so ppl fully understand what you are asking. Just trying to help
---
Same here. It looks cool and it's way easier to get what you're looking for
---
Ha! But I don't know about this Talos stuff, isn't that outlawed?
---
[I made a post like this too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hu2uwn/dark_matter_skin_and_other_combat_rifle_skins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 
---
The Devs even notice it and replied too. I also put links to similar posts in the description including this one.
---
For me, Queen of the Hunt is only weekly.
---
For line in the sand, we've been using 40mm grenades or all those floater grenades we've been getting. Double AoE perk card, but low or no explosive damage cards. Then switching to 50cal to finish the job.
---
Lunchboxes are a must for both events.
---
It’s from the settlers become friendly I believe and buy for gold
---
All the dlc ones too?
---
The soil foundations? They're a bullion item from foundation
---
I find in my power armor build they drain fast especially if you use a jetpack. Its just a suggestion do what makes you happy. The whole build is trash just making suggestions.
---
Yeah used to take me 3-5 plasma cores. Past couple events it took me 9-15. Which is annoying bc i used to have a stockpile of them that is now quickly dwindling.
---
I find if you can keep away from the ppl standing on the fence etc and go out wide and get the first shot she will land, sometimes.
---
My ultracite cores weigh 1.2 each with the perk at rank 2. I may be wrong but it's still too heavy for me. Regular cores are at 0.2 or something
---
Gotta boost your settlers popularity to get them. Find the guy who sells them in foundation.
---
100% approve
---
Can I see your email? 
---
I want to see it due to my friend who also suspended.
---
no not at all, love the game.  I noticed that as well but screwed up and added a comment instead of editing the post.  It's buried with all the other replies.  So do have a least favorite?
---
Yep, a friend of mine got unbanned, but was allowed to keep their duped items? That is crazy.
---
Not too important. The goal of the railway rifle is two things: to utilize cheap ass ammo to mass murder the wasteland and more importantly to go choo choo while you do it.
---
Nice! Are you at the waterfall? I did a seven story there for my wife. I have an eight story at the dual acid/lead location down near Lake Eloise and that was a bitch kitty to get both extractors fired. Got the whole camp built, ran power up from the cave, aaaallllll the way up to lead extractor on the cliff only to find out the extractor power nub extended half a foot above the build area. Tore the whole thing down and started over.
---
Yeah I've been exploring the forest until my stuff seems to be a bit overpowering the enemies and then moving on with the main quest and thanks to the SCORE stuff I've made a little under 1600 so far so moving luckily (hopefully) wont be an issue for the future haha
---
As a fat man, 2020 has been hard enough — I don’t want people being incentivized to shoot me
---
My gauss shotgun is totally not doing the same damage in vats ,as before patch 20.
---
For when you're feeling cute and might let Becket get some irradiated booty later
---
no idea!
---
Need to be in a group with people who are mutated and have strange in numbers on. I even get 5 on some specials as it basically saves half points up and then adds them together when it can. 
---
For instance i get NO negative effect from her mentality with class freak 3 while others get -1
---
You have to reach Friendly reputation with the Settlers, and have the Gold Bullion to purchase the plan (you need to complete the main Wastelanders quest to earn this from Public Events and things, as well as to make Samuel at Foundation turn into a Gold Vendor).
---
Exact same thing happened to me today, too. No problems with autocompletion previously. Logged into adventure mode well into the afternoon, took a fucking age to load, all but one daily autocompleted, and even that one was partially completed (10/15 ghouls "already killed").
---
You have to play the wastelanders story line, become friendly with Foundation Settlers, and buy those plans with gold. (new currency added with wastelanders)
---
I never planed on useing jet packs I was gonna use emergency protocols since your basically invulnerable with them fyi. It is funny you say the build is trash since. Your Clearly a hyper casual player. And since your getting offended by our discussion we will leave it as is since I'm guessing your anxiety is at a point where you are hitting a bowl.
---
Yeah, vats only works initially and the longer you stay In it the more bugs that pop up.
---
Tricky business since vats accuracy goes up the longer you shoot in vats.
---
Meh. I've been in tons of lobbys. I literally went from 518 to 590 over the weekend and it only messed up a couple times. It definitely worked out to my advantage more then it didnt. Plus, maybe just stay away from other players your not gaming with when your bonus is active. Highly unlikely someone will just come boost you lol. It's not hard to avoid really.
---
Not the OP, but my friend sent me a copy of his email.

Wow how the heck am I suddenly over weight...forgot to check my ammo.   5 missiles 2 mini nukes.  It's a bugbear of mine as well.
---
Exactly 👍💯
---
I try and do 3 tunnels which is enough to get rewards BUT sometimes it's hard because nobody EVER heals the NPCs. Ever. I don't think i've seen anyone heal an NPC besides myself in that event. 
---
So when i do leave the NPCs alone to get ore they usually end up dying because the people camping the tunnels don't care about the odd ghoul that gets passed them.
---
well yes, the headline does say double dailies!  Must have read it too fast. Thanks.
---
Okay, thanks :)
---
I had my last week weeklys autocompleted on ps4.
---
I was online during the challenges update..
---
Yeah. It sounds like you need a dedicated group with specific positions. Ore collection, NPC guard, etc.
---
I’ve heard about this one. Something like this would be perfect for hunting events in 76.
---
well mole rats are end game content :)
---
I felt sorry for the dude who nuked this one. They were sat next to me at delta.
---
Vats in pvp is truly bugged they may even have disabled it due to people complaining. Some weapons still work which is ironic.
---
I tried that for a week literally a cap no dice!
---
Weird way to spell TS/DWA/FR but yeah
---
Idk have you tried killing the level  90 three star something something with a melee weapon it looks like a zerg monster from StarCraft.
---
It's pretty tough if your running a non bloodied build.
---
Built another and same issue (definately from generators) but then loaded into a new lobby and both started working correctly! Thanks for the assistance though :) really appreciate it
---
a little from column A and a little from column B...just kidding
---
Cowards
---
Oh wow that's new, maybe this is a console issue?
---
well I bet that wall begs to differ sir:)
---
Watoga, kill one assaultron. You need to kill 5 eyebots total and you can probably find those at watoga as well
---
I've never gotten any quest from either after finishing there quests either
---
Good to hear some suspensions are being lifted.
---
PSA: everybody knows this. 1) SCORE progress is tied to XP not completing this event. 2) the rewards suck.
---
Wearing a mask is against my freedom as a free states citizen.
---
Yup a bunch of us failed it today... pretty annoying considering how much ammo was dumped into it...
---
Wait, so you need to kill 5 Eyebots in order for the challenge to count for 1? Isn’t it 1=1?
---
Also I roamed watoga and there were zero robots around, do I find them in one of the buildings or in the streets?
---
I like this idea!!
---
As I'm nearing level 200 on my main account I'm slowly becoming that guy who wants to do group events but gets back lash if I use my main kit and weapons for 1 shoting/ 1 slashing everything.
---
I've been using the drill and chainsaw lately at lower events as they lock at level 20.  Even as a high strength Melee build I'm not instakilling and get to have fun with silly weapons. 
---
The only thing I need is a fun construction workers outfit to make my Bob the builder build complete!
---
They just want the rewards for no effort
---
Usually people shoot it once just so they can get the reward
---
&gt;people need to stop being ammo mules.
---
Yeah but then we'd have to -- GASP -- swap cards every time we play to craft ammo. I prefer  crafting shit tons of it once a week and then being free to complain about being overencumbered the other 6 days. Don't judge me.
---
They need to make a deathclaw boss fight
---
TIL it's Commando, not Guerilla.  Which is amazing considering the graphic they use on the Guerilla card, and the relative uselessness of Guerilla overall.  Gunslinger and Guerilla really need to be merged.
---
They wait her to land
---
I like these.
---
I have one suggestion:
---
Drill, allow you to repair your camp objects to 100%.
---
 Each "attack" adding 1% hp back into the object. Using no resources besides your drills durability. Could even tie into that contractor 2star perk for this effect to really meld it in and give it that no resource repair effect. I'd even be happy if it was godawful slow haha.
---
I would finally be able to repair my decon shower that has been sitting under 5% hp for a year. Seeing all those partially full healthbars around my camp is annoying.
---
I was team earlier today and all 4 of us were sharing Strange in Numbers. I would have liked it if someone would have been sharing cannibal.
---
They probably hit it just enough to score the drop than save ammo
---
Both, server hop if you can't find the right robots. If you however over the eyebot part of the challenge it will say (kill eyebots 0/5)
---
we have magic weapons now we have magic creatures:)
---
This mail is different than the one Juicehead showed in his most recent video. Interesting.
---
This could mean that they're actually reviewing each case manually and these are not automated responses, which also strongly corroborates the fact that people who claim who only traded duped items and got banned without duping themselves are lying, as I bought three godroll weapons for dirt cheap*, and didn't get the hammer. 
---
It seems more and more evident every day that BGS does have ways to distinguish between dupers and those who just obtained the weapons, and people who claim otherwise are only trying to cover themselves and turn the rage machine against Bethesda.
---
*Edit: to clarify, I bought one with caps and the others with flux, and since to trade items in this game one has to throw them on the ground and trust the other person, taking from a loot bag two god rolls, which is what I did, would be incredibly suspicious, yet I am not banned.
---
She won't land unless people are off the top of the bunker I thought. Even when she did land only once, they didn't do anything still.
---
I barely bother with dailies. If i had to choose one i would pick the same though :p 
---
The creatures were very rarely where they were supposed to be and if you killed i you had to go looking.
---
I don't think I've encountered this. It does seem odd because(from what I've noticed) rewards are affected by the number of hits/damage you deal on the queen.
---
Ah I recall now. I only did it once and with my previous character while not really paying attention.
---
I didn't know the NPCs could be healed.  Learned something new.
---
Marathoner
---
Looks like I'll be farming ballistic fiber for days now.
---
It should work to your advantage 100% of the time. How are you not getting this?
---
Alright thanks!
---
This.  It doesn’t cost resources either since there is a built in budget.
---
And you can double up on the weekly claim 5 workshops.
---
Shit i mean hover* sorry
---
I have seen three, been involved in killing two, and straight up ran from a third when I stumbled across randomly after grinding for raw cobalt flux after a queen fight.
---
Thanks for posting this! I didn't get banned, but my friend did. She got unbanned right before I posted this, but it is basically the same email.
---
Of course people are going to ask for some sort of proof/source to this claim.
---
i could, i just know it'd take longer that way and i'd like to have her wear it from the start!
---
I enjoyed the Wastelanders campaign quite a bit actually. I did not enjoy what came after, though. A series of grinds, each less satisfying than the last. 
---
It's enough that I'm presently on a leave from the game, to give them some time to get some more content out.
---
Played a few mmo's over the last 15 years, looks like server lag to me. Stuttering,  rubber banding,  whatever is causing it can depend on a number of factors but atm we got it.
---
Exactly what I was going to say.
---
The level 90 alpha deathclaws that spawn occasionally still scare me at level 189.
---
I'm a Melee build slowly transitioning to full bloodied (only have 3 bloodied armour parts, 2 bolstering)  only 2 of the peices are 3 star, and they're a mixed bag of different gear.  As such I'm still VERY squishy and those high level deathclaws are a nightmare, especially when they see im equipped with their mothers arm as a gauntlet.
---
Yes! I think I was number 393 for those as well. Its a slog getting both sides as allies and doing their respective quest lines...
---
Yeah, I seen Juicehead video, but another question if you don't mind, did your friend submit a ticket today?
---
Exactly. Takes a lot of ammo to kill the queen. Just tag it with a few rounds and then let others spend the ammo. You get the same rewards to matter the choice.
---
Every sbq fight ive been to everyone seems to shoot her, I've maybe had 3 or 4 events fail in the almost 2 years ive been playing.
---
wait, are you talking about the fatman or the missile launcher. I'd love a quad barrel fatman....
---
Lol yeah, check your email if you were suspended and you probably got an email saying you were unsuspended.
---
THIS WOULD BE SO AWESOME! HELL YEA! UPVOTE THIS DUDE RIGHT MEOW!
---
It's weird sometimes vats is working okay, meaning It seems a little bugged but works.  Other times it is just pain Fed up 95% point blank with a J shot gun...misses 3 times in a row
---
While I'm not saying the bug was intentional, their choice of how to respond to it certainly is. 
---
They want your money folks. Buy up those atoms so you can keep paying for more of this free "content."
---
Let me guess, bloody/unyielding? The grind is fucking stupid if you're, well fucking stupid. At least, I got ~10 INT, minus something for some mutation, and leveling up takes ages. If I got radiation rumble tagging numerous ghouls it's a nice boost, but I'd never level up by casually playing unless I'm close to the next level anyways...
---
If Zhou are on PC you can hover over the challenge and it’ll show you how many robots of each kind you have to destroy
---
A link to an email would help or even an image.
---
So I wonder if the dupers still have the items in there inventory. I doubt Beth went through everybody items. So have they lost all there shit? I'm lost.
---
I’m on PS4, I think that option is not available for me since hovering over the challenge doesn’t show me anything
---
Can you post a video doing this in 180 seconds please?
---
Actually they're tougher in FO76 than in FONV
---
They are probably ghosts.
---
yeah haha. I thought “huh, why does that scout not have a top on” at first lol.
---
give us a option for caps instead 
---
I don't appreciate getting a  20lb legendary out in the boonies of  Appalachia  when I'm at 299/300lbs
---
In the Mire. Feel free to stop by.
---
Also I said NEAR their camp. They run around looking for some big bad. Not I destroy their camp. I run pacifist anyhow.
---
No never noticed in 4. But I only use PA in that game for specific situations like the glowing Sea, or big battles, then put them away again. I usually had plenty of cores to carry to not notice, but in this game and due to Stash limits, I only was hanging onto x3 100% cores, so I was being a bit more aware of how long they were lasting.
---
The one that the ghoul slept on for a while on Xbox the ghoul would just float in air and when you would walk by where it use to be you would go in the air too. And if you killed it while it was in the air you couldn’t loot it
---
I've done this with one person. Just a random player at silly o'clock in the morning. We had about 5 minutes so i messaged and asked if they knew what to do. They did. I said i'd take first shift on the ore and if they could do 2nd. When it came to my turn to defend i sat on top of the rad shower and murdered every ghoul who went up on the middle bit. Then i cheesed it and grabbed the last lot of ore. Only one scav survived but it was enough. 
---
The one in the middle is the easiest to defend as they have to go around and it gives you a chance to kill them. 
---
Even a 3 man team could do this easily. Have 2 collecting ore straight way. Defend the side with one turret more. When the two are done the third goes. Probably some dead scavs but whatevs. Easy
---
I share inspirational. Who doesn't want more xp.
---
I would also real like to see Bethesda put in some kind of mechanic to match us on a designated public team server vs a no teams server. Public teams are really nice but with the influx of new players in the game it can be a pain to have a full public team and even more difficult to keep it full for more than an hour as the server seems to flood the game with lower lvls that don’t understand the public team mechanic yet while only a handful of upper lvls take full advantage of team builds. I’ve had full servers where I was the only one with a team and was still by myself
---
I did not. Thus the post.
---
It's also super fucking stupid to have to resort to this idiotic measure to complete a badly designed challenge.
---
They get to keep their items. Correct.
---
We just got her to health regeneration point is joined late thought they had already got her down to that nope. She regenerated and only had like 5 mins left, nope I'm out not wasting any more ammo
---
The robco research center has a sentry not in the parking lot. Inside you can get the needed amount of protectrons, eyebots, and mr handys.
---
Where you just at the event on Xbox one? Because I was there and only me and one 300 player where shooting it the event failed because I guess the other people where shooting with pipe pistols and not attacking the queen
---
What's you normal loadout? &amp; how is the chainsaw overall? I had an idea for an Evil Dead Build but heard many a mixed comment about it.
---
Construction would be a really cool non combat build option.
---
I wish the event went off every 30 min.
---
not true I had issues with my J fixer, it can be hot and cold in vats, even before the update.  But some times that was the rubber banding effect
---
Damn wtf did Bethesda do to make you need surgery???
---
Yeah I feel you I’m right there with you except I got them all on PS4.
---
Amazing analysis.
---
To add to it, I believe the lower elevation makes the jumping a noticeable solution.
---
I believe wastelanders introduced hip fire accuracy into the mix. Amazing idea since that means if lets say an enemy player sprints vats no longer works like an aim bot. (look at vats crit receiver's, they always have hip fire accuracy) 
---
They need to iron out the bug for lower elevation and tight up damage detection.
---
hah, I know it wasn't me as I haven't been online in a day or so but I'm one of those weirdos who buys your 40mm and missiles. I really want a conventional explosives build to work but the damage they do really is sub-par. oh well, at least I can role-play my alcoholic, explosives-loving, soldier with the sheer amount of explosives I'm carrying around.
---
Samuel already is a gold vendor for me I’ll go and have a look tomorrow I’ve already finished the main story line thanks for the help
---
I know right? You run like ALL the time in this game, marathoner is great!
---
I’m just saying making a post stating that Bethesda is doing something without providing any type of proof doesn’t really go over well on here. 
---
It would be like me saying Bethesda is increasing the stash limit to 2000 and then when people ask me where I got this information I tell them to go check around, other people are talking about it.
---
There’s no need, the news is for players who will receive those emails. Just saying this so people will check.
---
So when I go to Vault 79 and see my history of purchases I should be able to see them right? NOPE! I cant see what I purchase is the pass. Oh, yea. I did buy 3 pieces even the chest piece.
---
Yeah, im going to miss that confetti perk!
---
I was wearing shadow prime power armor and used my flamer chainsaw. If you saw that then yeah. I was just in it on Xbox one. I unfortunately got disconnected from server but I knew werent gonna win anyway.
---
I watched the most beautiful thing this morning.  Made it to the last 4 and got killed by a bush wookie.  He then went on to make it to the last 2.  Other guy was in PA and using a 50 cal.  
---
PA guy was oblivious and fixated on the wrong direction.  Bush wookie snuck up on the direction he didn't seem to think existed and just started waving at him to say "hey, kill me, I can't win this fight".  After the SECOND time he emoted PA finally noticed and killed him.  LMFAO.
---
No, full health Vampire Heavy Energy PA build. I just have 22 stable INT before I apply any food or other kind of temporary buff.
---
Hm. I really like waste not. Is there any particular way to activate it?
---
Bloodied/unyielding?
---
Makes sense, but under different circumstances people will ask for evidence, just FYI.
---
So from what you’ve seen , you get more flux the more damage you do to the queen?
---
Propably visual bugs. I get those every now and again. People who come to my camp sometimes leave a "ghost" there after leaving, until i jump servers. Also see these on events/workshops.
---
Ah thanks. I'l try doing that.
---
It might be the fact that when placing items, the object is stationary in the center of the screen while everything around is moving. That or something with the menus. We would need more details from OP.
---
You and me both.
---
Make the fatman great again !
---
Message delivered: we don't want you hardcore dupping but we need you in the servers and in the FO1st subscriotions
---
You still have trouble accepting the blame for getting banned is your own. Those people you look down on knew the banned would be back.
---
I was there with bloodied fixer and bloodied mini gun and junkies mini. If People would get off roofs she would land and we could’ve won. Idk if we where both together or not but the only other guy that was shooting it was level 300 and had power armor so maybe it was you.
---
Mini Nukes are such a let down.  The entire Fat-Man system is badly under-utilized in fallout.  All of fallout.  
---
I've ranted about this before though.
---
Friendly fire in charisma plus hitting the NPC with a shishkebab = HEALS! 
---
Even just 1 point helps. I have 2 in it. 
---
If you're on xbone i can make a you one for free. 
---
What is annoying though is i'll be killing the ghouls and then have to switch to my sword to heal the npc. And while i am doing that ghouls are attacking me and the NPC and because i'm not specced into melee i may as well be throwing a fart at the ghouls and yelling 'cupcake!' So then i have to switch back to my gun and kill the ghouls BUT while doing that they're still hitting the NPC so now the NPC needs more healing than before.
---
You don't get any. It gives one bit of legendary gear for attendance but no flux etc.
---
That makes really use of the Drill. &amp; adding Contractor as extra boost is really creative.
---
Thinking about that and using perks too. I should add the Pitchfork as an option to repair crops that are damaged but not needing a repair. Its annoy as heck to find that my crops are broken and just so happen to not have that one plant to fix them all.
---
Id like to see that junk just removed completely honestly. Theres too much stuff in the pool to reliably pull anything useful. Take those out and tweak some of the other legendary effects and its gg.
---
Sorry I shoulda phrased that better. By sneaky I just mean crouched, not standing so your player marker/dot doesnt show up on the map, actual sneak ability doesnt matter.
---
Im sure over 75% of what Ive learned about 76 has been the hard way, or reading about another user learning it the hard way on reddit.
---
Kind of a weird place where good current info is tough to find. Or only exists in the heads of a few players.
---
Well that's fucked.
---
It's weird. Maybe there are manual ways to activate them?
---
I don't get then that they will randomly activate themselves when you are in the area.
---
Lol if this news doesn’t affect you then why bother? Players who were suspended and got an email that their account is returned have all the proof they need. This post is meant to be as news so players will check their email and try to log on.
---
I wasn't the level 300 I was level 41
---
Whitesprings is easy and then goto watoga and then the train yard above whitesprings it’s easy
---
free-6k. around that range
---
Hmm must be a bad server. So far all my encounters involving the SBQ has resulted in everyone trying to shoot it down.
---
 It was a light show, and it was very very loud.....
---
Oh.
---
The sound of a super mutant’s head popping, it’s extremely satisfying to fire a single silenced shot from my B3325 handmade at a Super Mutant’s head and it pops with that *SPLAK* sound.
---
(Same feeling also applies to other creatures who’s heads pop with the same sound.)
---
Reminds me of popping raider’s heads with the RU556 assault rifle back in Fallout 4, or popping heads with the Light Shining In The Darkness .45 Auto Pistol from New Vegas. Or the headshot sound from Saints Row 2.
---
Oh no worries! Solid advice for sure though!
---
I do enjoy it. Especially those sweeeeet pleasant valley claim tickets the ghouls drop.
---
TBH if you have the automatic launcher the 40mm can put out some damage. It's just so damn heavy though.
---
Market subs about to get nuked.
---
I love how VATS essentially teleports the 40mm grenade onto the enemy when you 'hit'. I was taking pot shots at one of those nuclear card drones zipping along and I still got a hit-marker around 10 seconds after firing at it.
---
Yeah I don’t really care if people don’t believe me lol, this news only matters to those people who were suspended and were awaiting an email. I think they sent it out in mass at 5:40pm est.
---
absolute cowards
---
But I don’t get it it only happened a couple times before but now I’ve gone 4 fights with out winning because either no one shows up or no one fights her.
---
Have an upvote. This is news, and good news for many at that. Good to see some folks are permanently banned. I think the slap on the wrist was appropriate considering how easy and widespread this dupe was. The week timeout is enough time for most folks to avoid this in the future.
---
It’s actually quite hard to avoid at SBQ. Many people are uninformed and don’t know it caps and breaks at 5, or maybe they only got 3 and want their fourth. Twice in the past 24hours I’ve had 9 active lunchbox effects with zero bonus xp. Stop minimizing for Beth. They need to fix the &gt;4 lunchbox BS at highest priority. Then, put some free boxes in the shop to make up for the lost boxes and multiple times everyone has had to waste a full in-game hour for broken buffs to expire.
---
Hopefully the major offenders get perma-banned.
---
I got one for 1500c
---
I wonder if they ran the numbers of how much those people spent and decided it wasn't worth it.
---
Yeah it's due to serverside damage detection
---
ya what dea said were having the trouble on Xbox were both on  xbox friends list im on his fo76 friends but cannot get him on my fo76 list and that has lasted for about a weak now i even removed him from my xbox friends and used fo76 to re-add him
---
For the most part (95% of the time) this game is awesome! In fact, when that ugly 5% shows up, the other 95% makes up for it.
---
I used to get angry, but anymore, I just shake my head and switch servers... 😊😂🤣
---
I'm so wanting the lunch boxes to show up in the Atomic Shop, because I LOVE the point, right after an event, or just before the nuke drops on Fissure Site Prime, when someone throws the lunchbox emote. It's so cool to watch as everyone gathers, and pop goes the lunchboxes!
---
It's so cool when I open one, and the next thing I know, 2 or 3 other players follow suit. This is the best online game I've ever played, and I go back to playing online games using dial-up modems... 😉😂🤣👴
---
I have everything except the one with the raiders I don’t feel like doing hat achievement just yet. I have only two other alts and they’re only level 10
---
If you stagger the queen she won’t land. Chances are they have stagger cards equipped. If she lands and they all lay into her that’s your answer.
---
You get the final event completion rewards and I’m 50% sure a legendary item for just being there when completed
---
I’ve found them thanks 500GB that’s a lot 😬
---
Some people stop shooting when she is in the air if she is out of range or if they need to stop to take aid items. If a bloodied build had to use an emergency diluted rad away now they have to go get their rads down again for nerd rage and so maybe they appear to be doing nothing. If they have to go through their pip boy looking for things it could take longer.
---
Some people also need to repair their weapon during a fight with a repair kit.
---
The SBQ being out of range though and not landing could be a big one.
---
Do you get anything from Legendary Run after rank 100?  Or is it "job well done, here are your rewards" and the run is over?
---
I'm only halfway there.  I haven't really let myself think about reaching the end.
---
They didn't even do that. They just stood and stared.
---
Fair enough. Well if you were suspended congratulations I guess?
---
Do Eyebots spawn there? I only need them now
---
This was EXACTLY what happened to me. Even the ghouls 10/15 part.
---
Yeah Bethesda also shared news like a couple days after the ban wave that players who did the dupe in mass were getting perma banned. Here’s the funny thing though, a lot of people who hate on dupers think that every duper dupes like hundreds of copies of everything lol, when in reality it’s just like 10-30 times they’ve done it.
---
Here me out. 2 part answer:
---
Part 1)  I sided with raiders so I dont have that fancy chinese stealth armor with 1k rad resistance, and I'm really flimsy (also have no carry weight without my armour)  so a radiation suit is out of the question.
---
I also dont carry power armour because the last time I equipped it at RAD Rumble it glitched with me being unable to remove it, I spent a half hour trying stupid fixes like exhausting the fusion core to zero with no parts attached.
---
I'm really not in a place to collect ore.
---
(If other people are actively collecting ore I'll spam rad away and rad-x and grab 10 or so, but I'm better suited to guard and keep settlers alive)
---
Part 2) If you don't have multiple veterans who are equipped to run the event its almost a waste of time, better to just grind for xp.
---
The last 4/5 times I ran it, it was me and a level 60, or me and two level 30s. No offense to them but they're not at the point where they can protect all the scavengers yet. They'll get there. 
---
Also, if there isn't either communicated team work, or a general lack of knowledge regarding how to do the event, i.e. people take turns gathering ore while others watch the 2 sides, it's near impossible with lower levels.
---
If it's four level 100 plus the ore should be grabbed every time.
---
Are you making sure you're dealing plenty of damage? There have been times when I started a new character, got plenty of hits but that wasn't enough. That's all I can think of tbh
---
At train yard above whitesprings and watoga they do
---
and i know its not just on my end a friend of ours is having the same prob with dea , dea has are other friend in fo76 friends but that friend cant get dea as a friend on fo76 as well
---
Sorry but that just sounds entitled to me 🤷‍♂️
---
The queen may be a special case. It’s the only boss that I’m aware of that has a minimum damage requirement to get loot. So maybe the team loot guarantee doesn’t apply in this case. I know that in other events it has worked for me. 
---
And more prayer can’t hurt, either.
---
same fam. I want so badly to run full demolitions but after using a two shot mininuke launcher for a few months with full demo perks and doing a grand total of 14 damage to the queen, I gave up. Its not effective or cost effective. Maybe one day in a couple of years...
---
Just the rewards you see dude. Last 10 rewards are pretty killer though.
---
Then don’t get that perk.
---
I’m really looking forward to getting more luck on some characters.  Luck has so many great perks that I had to give up for other things.
---
The settler daily quest. There really should be an event for each faction where you get reputation as well.
---
It is, you just need to hover over the challenge and scroll to the right
---
Good news is the secret service armor doesnt require ballistic fiber, so positive there
---
That and repair kits too. I've tried going into the event with new characters and even with the amount of shots I landed, I didn't get anything from the event. The queen herself dropped loot but I didn't get any flux or kits. I'm pretty sure there is a limit to how much flux you can get though. With my main, I think I've only ever gotten 4 flux, no more, no less.
---
I just started this mode 2 weeks ago and have been hearing about bush wookies for the last year.  Finally decided to try it since they forced it into the score system.  
---
Now I'm trying to perfect my bush wookie game and occasionally joining a team to actually play as intended.  Most of the time solo I don't even pick up a weapon, and on two instances have beaten someone armed with a gun and wearing armor to death with my fists lol.  It's actually pretty fun, like a hyper-violent game of hide and seek.  8/10 wookie games I end up with placement as well.  Will get bored of it soon though and switch to actually fighting most likely.
---
Heck, I'm level 422, and have 189 improved repair kits... LOL!  
---
It's still a great public event, and when they nuke the forest, it's an added bonus!
---
It's funny, when I see a nuke alert, and the forest isn't in the zone, I get the super frowny face... LOL! ☹
---
Yeah I just noticed, thanks
---
You have to pass a damage threshold with the queen to get any loot for her. If you’re not getting anything, you’re simply not doing enough damage.
---
Lol it’s “news” so some people will check their emails. If you are all salty about it and want to pick a fight, then just ask one of your friends who were suspended, that is if you had any. And if you were gonna bs and say all of your friends never got banned, you either have no/few friends or you are flat out lying.
---
Roaches man. Sometimes they spawn as level 200s wearing power armor.
---
Yeah like lucky break an the other one.
---
Holy shit. I'm on my first toon and would love to even be there.
---
Links? More info is better info.
---
tbh, I hide my camp unit as much as possible. It specifically looks stupid the way it unfolds and it has no place in plain view of my random shoppers or when I decide to afk on a couch. I wish they would tie fast travel to mats like in 4 and make camp repair happen at the tinkers so I could glitch it underground and forget about it.
---
They can't arrest all of us
---
I'd settle for having my camp not break from a bug that's been around since launch. I mean I guess I didn't expect much giving the game another try out of sheer boredom but really such an old bug that makes you rebuild your entire camp is still around =.=
---
I don't think so. They just turn It off beliveing that they are turning it on
---
Nice!
---
Ok . That makes a lot of sense cuz my new characters get caca from that event cuz I do almost no damage but now that I hear it from someone else then I think your right
---
my 6 person group kills her in about 1-2 minutes on average, surprised pubs can fail it
---
I'm not entirely too sure about that. I've tried doing the event with a new character for the repair kits but even when I'm trying to help, I don't get anything(event rewards at least, queen sometimes drop stuff if I deal enough damage).
---
Not sure why you are getting downvoted...  oh who am I kidding.
---
I think it’s important to note that the most prolific and damaging dupers simply do things on mule accounts and feel no “pain” for a dupe, outside of time spent.  The idea that this ban wave was harming people like that was a fantasy.
---
I mean the benefit is being able to move a bunch of those perk points into other stats. If your intelligence is at 15 when you get the perk, get it and move a point to luck or perception and you still get to have 15 intelligence
---
Not quite sure what you're asking.
---
Is it worth it as a user to buy atoms on a "dying game"? That question is as relevant right now as it will be one next gen games come out. My answer now is "no". But my answer will be the same even if a next-gen version comes out.
---
From Bethesda's side, the questions they would be going through are pretty simple
---
* How many people do we expect to stop buying atoms and/or not buy the game if we don't make a next gen version?
---
* How many new people do we expect to buy atoms and/or the game if we make a next gen version?
---
* How much will making a next gen version cost?
---
If it costs more to make than they expect to gain, then there's no reason for them to make a next gen version. 
---
There's currently 160 or so million current gen consoles out there. Those consoles aren't going to all get thrown away when next gen comes out. That's not even counting the number of PCs out there. Even if every single person threw away their current gen consoles, since both console systems will have backwards compatibility FO76 will still be playable on next gen. So the only people Bethesda are going to lose are people that upgrade to the next gen and refuse to play anything that's "only" previous-gen. I would imagine that's a pretty small subset of people.
---
My guess is that Bethesda will look at the numbers and say "meh, we're fine, no need for a next gen version".  I would love to be wrong, though. I feel our best chance for a next gen FO76 is that they want to get their engine up for next gen, and they could use FO76 as a fairly painless "test bed" for it. Better to work out the kinks in the smaller FO76 community than have an embarrassment with Starfield or Elder Scrolls 6. Even that though is assuming Bethesda's new games will use the same engine as they have used previously. If not, I think we have almost no chance of seeing a next-gen FO76.
---
Thank you for this.  Brightened my day.
---
I always found it amazing that they aren't simply a 1 shot weapon. I mean how can anything survive a mini nuke
---
Oh yeah, I’m lvl 91 and I’ve never had this problem until the last couple days. And it’s not just the queen, it’s multiple enemies that just aren’t dropping loot. The queen is just the most insulting so far.
---
Awesome thanks
---
You need the right perks and what type of fixer?
---
I had it happen for the first time early this week and it also took all but 2 of my weekly challenges. Big enough bummer that I turned off the Xbox and watched TV instead
---
It’s not just the queen, she’s just the most annoying. It’s around 1/2 of what I kill.
---
Also, some huge thick trees should be temporarily removable too like smaller trees/rocks/logs/plants, etc do imo
---
There is a message at the start of the event and a progress bar in the upper right of the screen
---
It’s a 3 star bloodied with 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more damage I believe
---
Everybody launches it for the first time without having a clue of what are they actually doing
---
Not bad one you’ll still be able to probably do a solo queen fight with that and what console are you on I can help out if you’re on PS4
---
Yeah I did the raiders with my main guy, that one I fee was far harder and much longer than the settlers. I felt like I could barely complete the raiders when I was level 50, but the settlers I knocked everything out at level 25.
---
Yeah man, I’ve got a mirv daisycutter. My best friend
---
&gt; WhO's FoRcInG AnYoNe?
---
Oh shut up - this 'legendary' run is designed to keep people grinding this shit daily for FOMO and the atoms they're not getting anymore for challenges. 
---
Luckily, most of the rewards are utter crap, which is why I think many players will lean back and take a break from this boring 'experience' soon when they realize they're only getting to 100 by either paying or destroying their soul.
---
I don't think it's really entitled to expect the game to perform to expectation that works. Lunchboxes really shouldn't be broken. They do need to fix the lunchbox shit, it's not even as if it'd be hard. What about that is entitled? It's an experience-breaking bug. It doesn't do what it is intended to do. They're technically cash-shop items. What if they did this when they were put on the atom store?
---
What happened ?
---
Oookay then.
---
So we have 3 types of hazmat. The prototype which you have one chance to get and the emmit hazmat suit which is a rare drop that cannot be repaired. 100% agree, bethesda turn them into skins rather than additional armors
---
I've been waiting to ask this question and didn't really want to start my own thread for it. I have an instigating explosive shotgun and I heard good things about it. In VATS this thing is amazing for me, being able to one shot most things that I've encountered. However, outside of VATS, it feels relatively weak. I'm specced in master shotgunner and all the way through the demo perks. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Sorry for the thread hijack.
---
Exactly.  I think if it as extreme hide and seek lol
---
Same
---
Yes, but I’m fairly stupid, so I was looking for a message stating that if no ore is collected, the event will fail.
---
Not sure, I was doing the same and not found, I found in a thread that they have move it to savage divide random encounters but I haven't tested yet
---
Sometiems It depends where u are when u log in. If you’re in a certain area when first log into map it can make the daily in that area pop. Not always but most of the time.
---
“Knight Moreno to, I guess, no one?” is a little creepy when all hell is breaking loose at site v9.
---
Can confirm. 
---
Was wrongly suspended but has now been lifted. 
---
Clowns the lot of them.
---
It sounds like you may have a blueprint, or there are items in storage that you aren't seeing. Sometimes it helps if you fast travel somewhere and then come back.
---
10% chance every 10 min, until the zone cools off. If he isn't there when you go, make sure to kill everything there, leave for 10 min, and come back.
---
Keep doing this, and you'll have a 10% chance each time. Just make sure you leave once you kill everything, or the spawn won't reset.
---
I've seen payers hang around for over 30 min, thinking if they stay they'll have a better chance, not realizing they're blocking it from spawning.
---
I get motion sickness from games, so it could be one of a few factors which I can think of. u/Wilfred_Liarmocks has pointed out a big one, the stationary item in the centre, especially when it bobs up and down over uneven terrain.
---
The CAMP borders can do it as well, since they form an uneven static point that also blurs detail behind them, which seems to move noticably when you do.
---
The UI is a bit fuzzy and soft-focused which doesn't help, same for the red/green outlines.
---
The biggest culprit can often be motion blur, especially combined with the above factors. Fuck motion blur, turn it off in every game I play.
---
I’m not salty? I said “fair enough” and was moving on. You’re the asshole in the situation now. Not me. 
---
Have a good day.
---
For me, it was asbestos roof from the spring bundle that was the cause of this problem (at release it seemed like progress and nut a bug) so reducing roofs if the best counter otherwise just redesign everything.  
---
This and the water wheel is what led me to take a break from 76 around the vending disable. Logging in one day to find I had to scrap a third of my camp just to get back to baseline was a big kick in the nuts I am slowly recovering from.
---
&lt;3 &lt;3
---
Fingers crossed
---
*Edit* thanks to this post I checked my email &amp; got unbanned, I made the mistake &amp; a day later they swung me.
---
Now, what to do with my second fo76 account.....
---
*conspiracy* edit : I wonder if they soft banned people as a scary tactic but to also squeeze some more cash out of those who bought another account.
---
Every lever after you should get 1 lunch box, or 3 every 5 levels
---
Haha, except you didn’t end on “fair enough” now did you? Have a good day to you too. Everyone’s an asshole at the end of the day.
---
i dont know why people thought something else was going to happen. this is what they usually do
---
I've noticed if a lunchbox is popped, and there's 3 or 4 high levels in addition to yourself, everyone is much more motivated to do it knowing everyone else likely knows how to do it.
---
Its definitely hard finding that magic group, I get them maybe 10 or 20 percent of the time. 
---
If I see the same other high levels at other events playing well (sharing legendary kills, letting low levels get tags, not hoarding spawn points, stiming downed player, being friendly with emotes) I look forward  to radiation rumble because it's likely they'll show up and play well there.
---
If I'm in the mood to grind (half the time im building and shopping lol) I will server hop to find a full one with multiple teams, and lots of high levels. I'd rather wait 5 minutes surfing servers for good players then play on a dead or low level server, where the other high levels are just doing westek runs.
---
When I was low level Those were much appreciated
---
Got unbanned
---
I used my card and actually started an Encrypted event the other day, acted as conduit, got a couple of good hits in on the Sheepsquatch to get credit then was instakilled  by the thing for my efforts.
---
By the time I spawned back in it was dead, I looked around for about 10 minutes and never found the body so got no loot for my efforts.
---
Totally worth it.
---
Making the Overseer proud, bro
---
that'll be 999 atoms plus tip
---
Yeah I’m so rarely on when radiation rumble goes off. I have a full time job now so I can only play on weekends. It sux
---
it grinds my gears:)
---
They could even have fun with it and make one have a fish bowl as the helmet, idk haha they just feel left out with every other armour getting skins
---
Did you loose your levels?
---
More misinformation over SCOVID 76, it's not a plague, more people die from RAD poisoning every year and it has a low mortality rate. Wear a gas mask and keep your distance and you should be fine. I mean "Hello" when are we gonna talk about raider brutality being a public health issue and how it systemically effects those marginalized in the wasteland compared to the privileged Vault Dwellers who have never experienced oppression, they have only been trapped underground and forced into conformity, get over it Vaulty. I have to eat a spiky beaver tail with out any brahmin milk!
---
Enjoy your downvotes.
---
You should watch that classic foodie movie *Bone Tomahawk*.
---
As far as I know, no, my other friends checked their accounts and have kept everything
---
Oh shit nice
---
Gulp... I’ll have to take this up with the Scout Leader..
---
Line in the sand sometimes needs tweaking. Most of the time i can get it to work. But then sometimes no matter what it wont.
---
Actually they have reinstated accounts and said it was ok.
---
If you were ok with the bans because Bethesda said so, you logically should be ok with unbans because Bethesda said so.
---
I'm level 189 and still dont have a legendary healing flamethrower or shish kebab. Or is it a perk card. What's best to heal NPCs?
---
Oh really? Awesome! =)
---
Basically, to make them viable, They need to be rarer (A LOT rarer)...and have about 10x the damage they currently have.  Mini Nukes should be fully capable of annihilating ANY soft target, and making any harder target absolutely GLOW.
---
Haha.
---
"and then I realized I was looting my friend's house"
---
Edit: spelling
---
So how do you get 22 INT without buffs? And do you think anyone with a 'normal' build will come anywhere close to that?
---
You can use a blueprinted stair support piece to snap foundations anywhere :)
---
Yes that is the real problem.  You can't cripple her and force her to land.
---
Yep, now I will do this. I hadnt because I had never encountered this bug
---
Yeah I’m hyped to get back to my main, all the stuff I run on him I got before anything happened so it’s nice
---
The way people misunderstand events in this game makes me fear for humanity.
---
I hope you do spot the satire, I realize some people don't experience the same sense of humor out in the wasteland.
---
I do for sure! Well written!
---
Aye. I think i'm addicted to helping people. 
---
Someone helped me on my first day of playing Guild Wars back in 2005. I had never played a game like it and was absolutely clueless. This guy showed me around. Gave me some stuff. Helped me with a couple of missions and quests. Gave me pointers. And that shaped me as a gamer.
---
I congratulated you with a question mark because it’s not clear if you were or weren’t suspended. 
---
Have a good day. Asshole.
---
No blueprints, but I will fast travel to the camp when I get back to my console. Yeah I know I'm lame for not blueprinting things lol.
---
Had friends who were suspended, they are back now. They had bought duped items [aware or unaware] not sure about their intent. But were given final warning &amp; got to keep their progress in SCORE, as well as, kept the duped bought items. 
---
Which is probably the best outcome that they’ve had hoped for.
---
It’s not there just for pvp it’s so if u die u have to be sure to go get ur things back or lose them
---
I would much rather lunchboxes be a drop from doing events and not in the atom shop
---
I feel this is the event that shows people's true colors. It's the one event where everyone is close enough and the enemies aren't going to kill you, that you should always emote (come over) and make sure everyone gets a tag.
---
I run a Melee build but switch over to my handmade as soon as I hear the legendary announcement. If I find them I give them a single shot and then emote like a madman for others to get their hits.
---
Missle launcher, sadly there is no quad barrel mod for the Fatman :(
---
And what did we learn from the experience?
---
It easily had to be like 30% of their income
---
Got unbanned. Duped one weapon "to see if it would work" and got caught. And I can tell you the dupped weapon is not there anymore. So I am back clean.
---
I think the bug is related to holding the fire button in VATS, so it mostly affects charging weapons and the bow.
---
Some other users advised me that the Gauss rifle will hit if you charge before entering VATS. Seems to work. Also, if entering VATS then only tap the fire button I will hit. If I charge at all in VATS, even a millisecond, it will often miss.
---
For bow, I have to draw the bow fully before entering VATS. I hope this helps.
---
The friendly fire perk card lets you heal them with fire. Somehow. 
---
I imagine a shishkebab weights less. So there's that. Stupid thing is.. with the flamer you have to BASH the NPC to heal them. Seen multiple people saying this but never actually tested it myself. You can heal ANY NPC in an event as far as i know. Free Range. Riding Shotgun. 
---
Also. You can heal teammates as well. Not just NPCs
---
Just give me a deathclaw hoard event. Dozens of them running at you. When they come out during radiation rumble I absolutely love it

My problem is.... In vats does less damage. I shot at a level 30 something cultist, body/chest in vats and it only took a quarter of their health.  I'll check again after dinner.  Yesterday this beast was humming level 90 scorchbeasts in 5 shots.....
---
He spawns frequently on the long railroad bridge by Charleston station.
---
That'd be cool, but since not everyone in the server made the same choice for the vault, probably unlikely they'd add that many individual NPCs. The event already lagged really badly lol
---
you can get rep by not taking the caps
---
It all depends if you're a collector or not. I think the special radiation suit is really cool.
---
Yeah it sucks it's not repairable but that doesn't discredit people wanting it or liking to do events.
---
I'd be sat there in someone's tent at the Queen fight
---
Yeah that ban was piss weak. What was it, like a week or two?
---
Solid. And all the duped shit is still there apparently.
---
Fuck it I'm gonna go stack my camp with ammo machines and start selling it off. I'll cop a week holiday and resume the week after.
---
Had a few friends message me saying they were unbanned. Didn’t believe them and then I saw this post. I still have two good friends, though, that are banned. One said she had her appeal denied so I’m not sure what’ll happen there. I’m wondering if the wave will continue until tomorrow.
---
I need to know. Project Paradise has been calling and there’s not enough bodies.
---
i think it should be 2 repair kits and one lunchbox as a reward from scorched earth instead of the 3 repair kits
---
Np, best of luck. It can be somewhat grindy to get all of the rare stuff. I suggest making the spawn locations part of a routine versus server hopping; but, to each his/her own.
---
Melting hearts rather than scorchbeasts...
---
Heard you twice the first time.
---
No, I found a cool tree that had some structures in it up in the Mire (am less than 100yds from where the mining rig pops up,  actually.)
---
I feel your pain about needing a do-over to get things to work. Am on maybe my 30th incarnation at this location, in large part because of that very problem.
---
Iv had all that stuff for a while now.
---
No mercey
---
Oh well that's ok but I uhh... well I can't stop the missile now.
---
It like a low powered ripper haha. It's fun but you're going to go down if you take it to guided meditation and expect to kill three level 60 gouls lol.
---
My construction build is for silly low level events like tea time and back on the beat
---
Yeah but what am I missing how can I? And no Xbox one I have it on ps4 2 but got it a while back and only level 7
---
No email yet.
---
Do you have the right perks for a bloody commando build?
---
I’ll be honest, when I’m all alone in a dangerous location I often keep a radio station on just to calm nerves
---
I'm still working through a second character to get my second Wastelanders ending achievement (Side with Raiders for the raid), only because I tend not to play as anything but my main. Honestly forgot how long the early game can take when you don't have the ability to fight everything with high powered explosive bullets. =P
---
But once that's done, I'll be right there with you in terms of completion! It'll be nice to be done with that second ending, if only so I don't have to move between characters anymore (and honestly, I'm kind of avoiding doing it in case that somehow bugs out any SCORE dailies or some other weird nonsense).
---
That throw away accounts are a thing lol.
---
I kinda hate being the only person collecting ore, and then the people who are supposed to be defending let all the NPCs die. Like you literally had ONE JOB lol
---
Would I be right in saying you did the ammo blueprint glitch? Even if you move your camp, you wont be able to really delete the space
---
This!
---
I keep strong back and some other weight-reduction perk cards unequipped by default, and then I swap them in when I get overloaded.  So when I hit my encumbrance limit, I can extend it by dropping perks for melee and/or big guns in favor of carry perks.  Depending on where I am, that may or may not seem worth the risk.
---
Awesome, I'll save the next shishkebab I find and play around with it and that perk.
---
Once I have it down I'll keep it for radiation rumble so I have another role/thing to do to support the team!
---
My mom says I'm a nice boy.
---
Well for starters I have everything I could dream of, which was my post of my two aae legacies days before the event, so if I lost anything I don’t care, tho I’m set with doing anything again cuz I have those and they’re the only weapons I need, so base line, to be a good boy and don’t break rules
---
It’s definitely worth a week off to get your end game gear all set up right? Oh wait that big “final warning” is scary stuff, right? Lol
---
Speaking of, I'm always on the lookout for Mr. Fuzzy Tokens if anyone is selling for a reasonable price on PS4. Still trying to get the outfit for myself
---
It's as ugly as it's pretty good
---
That disheartening. Yeah the build was going run a Chainsaw and doubled barrel, so option were there but that really seals that build from being a thing.
---
for when the SBQ wants to fuzzy wuzzy but the meanie weenies keep blasting her with limb damage LMGs and bloodied explosive gatling plasmas uwu
---
That would make things at the wayward awkward and make me not want to return. Lol
---
I understand the apprehension with SCORE. As far as I saw, I actually probably earned more of it with an alt because of how easy it was to level up. However, when I unlocked an award, I would only claim it after logging into my main, to make 100% sure it went to my preferred account.
---
Why so much stupidity in this thread? Also just because you dont want missiles doesnt mean everyone have to lose theirs
---
Half of the post talk about things non existing in the game like destroying other people camps; in what world do you live in guys
---
My Railway Rifle says "yummy"
---
I don’t really do the old dailies anymore so I’d have to go the importance of communication. 
---
The other gold dailies are fast and less boring to knock out immediately, whereas every time I see its wrens quest I don’t even bother now. 
---
Of the old dailies probably the bomb one. 
---
Also not a daily but horde events where you visit 4-5 locations first are also ridiculously boring. 
---
EDIT: Oh god yeah I forgot about the hemlock holes cook, I change my answer.
---
These are what we in the buisness call foodies
---
Well if my team is a bunch of Gamepass newbies and the requirement is to 'level up' for the day then I'm sure going to bush wookie it the whole game!
---
The newbies always pick spots far away from each other, giving no hope of getting good XP if you try to help any
---
Lucky mucker. It's needlessly annoying. All the other camden dailies take like 30 seconds tops if there's some server lag. For the mucker, you have to run around the entire park, making at least 2 loops. You draw a bunch of scorched, ghouls, and/or bloodbugs and there's no real way to avoid it. And the rewards you get for that aren't any better than for eating 6 hot dogs
---
I was struggling to understand seeing people being kicked from building teams but maybe this is why? Kicking someone off a building team is like the dumbest move I can imagine but there may be a slight, slight reason if they mad at a shared perk but even then...
---
Scroll down to the actual challenge “kill assorted robots” and a sub menu pops up on the right side which stated how many of each robot you need
---
Edit: if you don’t see robots in watoga keep walking around and eventually they’ll come out of those robot dispensers on the sides of the road
---
I'm around 450 and can still level once a day if not twice. Saying this doesn't negate how you're feeling though... It takes work to figure it out. Perk cards chems food and a sort of path through Appalachia hitting high level enemies and hoards. It's almost like we're playing to level not playing to play.
---
To offset this I decided to run a new character. My goal with it is to make a solo SBQ killer. This has given my gameplay some new life as leveling is easier. I nurfed the alts ability to level so I dont blast through it only doing buffs if I need to level. My pace has drastically changed and I'm enjoying the game with a new goal and getting the challenges done.
---
In my experience server lag makes it worse, but it is not entirely lag that causes it. Beth knows about it and claims it's complicated.
---
That is Awesome, I am glad you had fun.
---
I remember wandering into the death claw sanctuary a handful of levels into the game. I died. I never went to that part of the map again. 
---
And then again in FO4 with the death claw in the first town. I died. And died. And died...
---
I have a healthy fear of death claws.
---
I was lucky enough to pop in a sbq fight where some guy aggro a wendigo colossus and brought it over to the queen and almost everyone just got there 1k dam and watched the show ( Sbq won but barley).
---
Ironically, fuel is about the only thing that’s worth crafting from unused ammo. The material cost to craft fuel is unsustainable at a tinker bench, even after the buff, but not so bad at the AC.
---
Mage storm was pretty damn good in the dial up days and that was a team based game....
---
There is a sound effect for weapons breaking.
---
There’s only one thing that matters to these companies and it isn’t your enjoyment level with their game. $_$
---
5% is kinda high, but I like the idea.
---
I'm sorry, are you saying "meow"?
---
Yup. A cha-chunk sound
---
what sound i never heard
---
That sounds good. But I'm also looking for a reason to grind s.c.o.r.e. points.
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah I got it, thanks!
---
Also the moment they come out of the dispensers they die, im trying to find an assaultron or an eyebot but no luck
---
Because they didn't dupe all of them.why is it so hard to believe people?!
---
If you do want a chance to get something on new characters, your best bet would be to just fire as many rounds into the queen as you can. Since the minimum damage is "1" and not "immune" or "0", it's easier to just land hundreds of rounds doing 1-dmg than trying to use a slow-firing weapon that deals only a few points more.
---
There was a bug where you got a pack when you leveled in adventure.   So you collected them then.
---
You also get a pop up notice in the upper left corner.
---
Well. Now that's sorted let's all go fuck shit up in Appalachia together and move on.
---
Not a bug per se; Bethesda at some point retroactively awarded NW perk packs for Adventure mode accomplishments. As a result, some of us got a giant pantsload of free packs.
---
They ruined your game by selling you an item you would be never able to get for a ridiculously low prices.
---
People be like: Ban dupeeeers, they ruin this game and ruin everything!!!!
---
The very same people in PM/discord/whisper - heyyy so do you have some extra legacies I could have? Im willing to pay 5k caps :'D
---
They are not on the atom store though are they? As for it sounding entitled I still think it does. I'm happy with what I got.
---
I've had some really bad experiences with the community, but when you find a player that interacts positively, it makes all the difference. I was in an event team with someone around level 30 (much lower than me). I was just trying to knock out events and they joined me and we kept thumbing and hearts at one another. So I went to their camp and dropped a bunch of nuka colas, purified water, recipes, plans etc on their stash. Just hoping to give some love. Then we were in another event and had a 3rd person that was really positive. So I invited them to team and they dropped some gifts for me! It was so wholesome.
---
I think the One Fallout or whatever it’s called will fix that. DClaws were pretty difficult to fight fairly until I  hit lvl 100 and fixed my loadout. They just aren’t usually scaled to our lvl rn and we’re seeing a lot of weak ones that would normally be a nightmare for a lvl 30
---
Thanks for the tip :)
---
I love the straight nuka ones. Way more bang with the explosive perk.
---
That does seem weird. Most of the time, as long as I deal enough damage, I'll get a loot drop. Landing hits doesn't guarantee me anything though.
---
I have been enjoying handing out weapons, plans, food, leader bobbles, and cranberry nuka to the new players so they can survive and grow to be big and strong. I also help them with missions and team up with them so they can have some perks and the team bonus. It feels nice to help the newbies out, give me something to do and makes me smile. Plus I can slowly convert them to being a loyalist to the great and wise Mothman.
---
Hm, care to tell more? I have actually blueprinted floating 2x1 stairs with a post, but can't attach any foundations to it, no matter what...
---
Relatively new player here (~1 month). I'd be happy if I loaded in with my quest info/markers already fully functioning instead of having to wait a few minutes. As well as my base loading before my character, so I don't mesh through the foundations of my cliff base and fall off the mountain.
---
Still a little nuke fart.
---
Because you likely are equating everyone that was banned to a duper.  You’re also assuming that everyone got unbanned.  Everyone has not got unbanned.  You’re mad at your own imagination.
---
Any duper worth their salt made a mule account and went hog wild, you can bet those people aren’t coming back.
---
the timing works out great.  with double score, they can all catch up now!
---
When I was new, I was level 27 at Fasnacht (Oh I miss that event) and someone mic checked. I had my mic on so I spoke back and it was a level 230, dude had been playing since start of the game.
---
Once he realized I was knew he adopted me like you did with your level 20.
---
He made me a tricked out lol 25 handmade, showed me a camp location after I explained what I was lacking (junk), then when I told him I was struggling on bullets he made me a set of excavator power armour, and took me to lucky hole mine to teach me how to farm lead.
---
He also dumped me a bunch of plans and gave me an instigating/exploding level 45 10mm for future use, "this will be a good running around back up one day"
---
It was a very positive expiration that set the tone for me in the game for sure.
---
I still have that instigating/exploding 10mm and will probably never trade it in for legendary script or sell it.
---
Maybe one day I'll adopt a level 25 and pass old faithful down to a new owner.
---
You missed a perfect opportunity to say XPloit
---
I think mine is automatic, but I have to go into my Pip Boy to toggle it to active.
---
Still bugged on my character that encountered it originally, but not on a new alt I started. I made a point of NOT stealthing and avoiding the ambush when getting the data recorder. Stood in the open and fought them, grabbed the data recorder and went back to Daguerre. All went as expected.
---
I have 3 characters. The two able to talk to her fought and defeated their ambushes at the data recorder. The one that's bugged was stealthed and never fought them. Not sure if that's connected and it doesn't resolve anything since we can't drop and restart the quest. Just something I wanted to test.
---
thanks to know
---
I'm with you. That and missile launchers and the fat man.  So sick of completing a quest and then having to dump the reward.
---
I only have one thing blue printed, I don't particularly like the system because it goes to crap if you add stairs. 
---
And if you're curious, The one thing I have blue printed is a small, 2x2 home that I tend to slap up multiples of at Tyler county race track. I like putting them up and asking random people from the server to decorate one of the rooms, you get some pretty interesting and creative decorations out of it. It sometimes turns out to be a little art exhibit with all these different types of rooms put next to each other
---
Same thing happened to me! Never experienced this bug before but of course it happens on the first day of the double SCORE event :(
---
I was not logged in during a reset (I am usually sleeping when they happen anyway). I didn't do any NW stuff for the past two days. I am on PC and I log in manually with my Bethesda username &amp; password.
---
Last thing I did last night was Line in the Sand to get the level up challenge done, I then logged into my private world so I could scrap all the weapons I picked up without lag, checked where I was at on the SCORE board and logged out (while still in the asylum).
---
Logged in this morning, bought the Tire Wall set and the Electro Fusion fireplace from the ATOM shop, logged into Adventure mode, game crashed, logged back in and went to Adventure mode and all but one daily SCORE challenges were auto completed, and my rank has not budged at all, so yeah missed out on 4500 SCORE.
---
Could have something to do with logging out while in an interior cell or buying from the ATOM shop before going into Adventure mode? I dunno, but those were the only non "regular" things I did that I can think of.
---
tldr: missed out on 4500 SCORE, not very happy.
---
I have friends that got permanent banned, so I don't know what the OP is talking about.
---
I just make a suit of level ten leather armor. Mid it up. Then leave it for a low level player to find.
---
This was nerfed so if there still doing this there wasting time
---
blue ridge mountains
---
Nope. Our group (4 people), all play full health builds. 1 heavy guns, 2 mixed rifle/heavy guns, and 1 automatic rifles only. No junkies either, but I do have some junkies weapons for an alt character, but haven't play him in over 6 months. Our heavy does have a magic SMG, but only uses it on bosses after everybody else gets some hits in first. We are each pretty lethal individually, but together it's awsome.
---
Shotguns require vats. They still experience the first shot miss most of the time, but the second shot kills as it should. I ran my junkie/shotgunner to L200 and ally with both factions about a month ago, and I had to use vats.
---
Everything in this game needs a balance pass. Once they fix all the bugs with them. The current values we have are VERY poorly thought out. 
---
You wanna restrict your bonus to only scorched? Ok, +30%. 
---
You wanna one-shot? Okay, +100%, only if enemy has full health and the server isn't lagging and the enemy's feeling nice. 
---
You want a bonus for being naked? Ok, up to +50% if all your armor is broken. And up to -50% if you dare accidentally repair any of your armor
---
You want to be a druggie? Ok, +50%, and you lose like 2 charisma lol.
---
You want something for low health? Ok, here's nearly double damage, and also a massive sneak bonus, easier and faster criticals, more melee damage and carry capacity, better vendor prices, faster leveling, much more AP, and constant access to the best perks in the game that make the overall bonus closer to 3.6x alongside a coin flip chance of flat out not taking damage.
---
Usually? More like 200 or more...
---
Same. I bought god rolls with caps and didn’t get banned. It seems very suspicious that people who supposedly did the same thing got banned.
---
In my friend’s case, he did dupe just not as extensively as other people I know did. What surprises me the most is that Bethesda didn’t wipe his account and let him keep the duplicated items.
---
They can gift score, they just don't want to. They have the power to literally change anything with their game. They're holding out for people to give into FOMO and buy atoms. They're not idiots, they've done the research and they know how consumers will react. They'll hold out for your money longer than you think. They know you'll give in and buy. 
---
There is likely one of two scenarios here:
---
1. Bethesda has hired the dumbest devs ever in the history of video games who can't fix one bug without creating 3 more. 
---
2. They've engineered this to happen to push people into buying atoms because they want money for the "free" content they just gave us. They've hired mobile game devs who know how to make money, not quality.
---
Oh don't worry, that cart you woke up on is in Appalachia too.
---
Very annoying
---
Used to have ghouls jump out at you in FO4
---
😭😭😭I'm so happy rn
---
Well could be using cameleon and just chilling while you guys do the work and claims xp for event.
---
Completely agree. It took me ages to figure out how to manage to get fencing around my camp
---
So I'm safe to walk through them?
---
Yup I had a trade set up for a bloodied fixers but dude got the investigation email and few days later he got the perma hammer ( now I'm kinda glad I didn't get it)
---
Trabslation: they determined there isnt a big enough monetary gain from fixing it.
---
I have 4 friends that got an email at the same time saying their accounts were restored, and that if they exploit again they will be permabanned.
---
Your friends must have been excessively exploiting
---
I have a good shot of him on my loading screen!
---
You’re making me question it now but I think so, I avoid them so I don’t lose all my rads but I’m 99% sure it can’t affect your mutations as long as you have starched genes on.
---
You keep saying this but I'm confused who your talking about Bethesda? (I'm assuming) or the duppers?
---
Get your life in order man.
---
what platform?
---
sort by weight, it will be at or near the top
---
I would collect ore and I try to when I can, but I’m just too squishy. ;-;
---
Alright, thanks
---
Xbone
---
Just call Mr House
---
Ha! In contrast, I went to finish up the shovel quest, I only use pedestrian junkies version of melee weapons (pitchfork, shovel, cane etc), so it’s never a problem for me. But I noticed three separate paper bags around the grave with different shovels in them and it warmed my heart. It means nothing to you to spend five seconds dropping a shovel, yet a simple act can save someone a couple of minutes. I always feel like if you could translate to people they could exchange their small amount of time to save someone else 40x the amount of time, they would understand that dropping the shovel is not only wholesome, but necessary to enlightenment.
---
bah...ps4
---
It’s painful... Used my Quad E Double barrel Shotgun, shot in vats 8 shots and first 4 went into some kind of different dimension... even though it showed 95% in VATS! I was literally standing behind Scorched and missed 4 out of 8... absolutely terrible, frustration is over the top in this game...
---
Same reason why most of the unique gun variants don't use skins from their default variants. I think right now the only weapons that allow it are the resolute veteran, the action hero, and the final word. It's like they keep cycling in new interns every week who aren't aware of anything that happened in the past, at least it would explain why we keep having the same bugs resurfacing
---
That's a little overkill but ok 
---
Then again I'd do it for a spider so
---
ah rip 💔
---
People use hazmat suits?
---
ive walked through at least 100 times and no problems here
---
I'd say MIRV is close enough
---
Anyone know how to do that on PC? I always have the same problem that I can't see what I'm doing because the item is right in my face.
---
AM I SAYING MEOW?!
---
Make their attacks ignore armor and DR. Done.
---
awesomeeeee thx
---
but its a time ive never even got hurt or shot, i logged into the server.
---
Please no.  Add bluegrass, but do not do what they did to those two songs.
---
It's okay to be happy with what you got. I don't think that's the problem. But the game still generates enough revenue on the atom store with twenty dollar power suits. It's not as if they're hurting. It's seriously okay to say something needs to be fixed that doesn't work as intended. That's really silly.
---
That has nothing to do with the post
---
Wouldn't that be accurate at least per shot? Musketballs fucked you up
---
The only thing that bothers me is the phantom that randomly hits me when I play
---
I hear this a lot but from my observations Im not seeing it have a significant impact. Every SBQ Ive attended has her land a number of times, and stay down long enough for people to get some hits in while on the ground, and the fight has ended after a decent amount of time with plenty of time to spare, regardless of whether there are tent or fence sitters. I dont want to see her able to be melted in seconds. I know people will argue with me on it but Im not seeing a problem.
---
Melee is the way to go for max damage on queen. My bloodied melee char  doesn’t have the greatest gear but can hit the queen in the face for 3k without chems and 2 or 3 food buffs
---
I've heard this a couple times but she definitely will land with people on the bunker
---
I'm not online to check, but if I remember the math correctly, 15 base INT, Egg Head and the INT mod of PA helmet puts me to 23, then I have Marsupial which brings me down to 22 with Class Freak.
---
At the most extreme, If I want to get really into grinding mode with a building team and someone who shares Strange in Numbers I can stack foods and perks and chems to get up to 50+ INT and 30%-40% more XP depending on if the events that reward XP bonus are active in that timeframe. If someone opens lunchboxes I can basically get near max XP from every kill and daily/event. Although it has only happened once because I purposefully wanted to know how far I could go, but I usually don't go around farming for foods and chems to grind XP to that level, because the process is long and boeing and most of the best bonuses are really shortlived. 
---
In my least effort run I still always bring with me cranberry relish and brain bombs, keep berry mentats from the drug dealer ghouls, and with teams I can use Inspirational even by myself, so even alone I can get quite a lot without really going out of my way. I'm considering taking Herd Mentality and definitely tossing Lone Wanderer aside for that extra kick, but it's not really a short term objective, as I get enough XP as is.
---
I definitely think it should be as it's crafted no different from flux and once crafted cannot be broken down further
---
Hey, go ahead if you can. Never seen it beyond 150 myself. Although the economy is crap nowadays!
---
They're the victims of quick and easy bandaids that have been left about a year too long. TSE weapons used to be overpowered, so their solution was to not only nerf both effects heavily, but also give every enemy a ludicrous amount of explosive resistance. They also decided that an online game like this with such laggy servers is a good place to have explosions appear on impact, but in the same location it impacted instead of the same surface. So if you're trying to shoot down a scorchbeast or vertibot with a targeting missile launcher, pretty much the literal situation it was designed for, good luck because the explosion will happen wherever that thing was 2 seconds ago and they won't take any damage. And of course, they decided to make durability based off hits instead of shots, so explosions are treated as a hit for every limb they touch, meaning explosives break a few times faster than normal guns. That could very easily be fixed by just buffing their durability, but lol imagine changing a numerical value in an editor
---
Adopt meee I’m lvl 20 and a hot grill (in game)
---
Be happy, that’s great. I wish I could overlook all of Beth’s broken shit without caring too. Also, boxes in the shop is not a new idea. Also, if I earn something and use it, but then it’s broken, wanting a new one is not entitlement. I am entitled to one that works for earning it. If you worked for 8 hours and got paid Monopoly money for some of it, would you be happy?
---
I'm in Maryland and that's how half of my family talks.
---
5 string or Irish?
---
I did not use it, also what ammo blueprint?
---
Just throwing a number up :)
---
Missiles are worth alot in the ammo convertor. That's something at least.
---
I just notice it’s much more painful when people are standing on/in areas where she can’t land to attack. And it makes sense considering how AI pathing works. I definitely don’t have any concrete evidence other than the times where players actually get off the stuff when you ask them to and explain it, the queen will land and stay landed much more consistently.
---
Well..  you were just jumping around all nimbly bimbly from tree to tree..
---
She will change her focus among players. If that player is on the ground and in the clear she has a chance to land. If not she will slow hover until she changes focus. It’s quite possible that she landed because her focus was one of the players outside the fenced area.
---
You get treasury notes
---
If you didnt use it, then no need to worry. Not worth doing it, but it's on youtube if you want to see it (not linking it here). May be worth contacting support if it's a bug on your camp
---
What if it was more so- a *scare* tactic into players buying another account?
---
Personally I like the lower levels. I can easily offload the common plans to players that need them rather than just dumping them. I see the lower levels having a good crack and they need to level up and get experience to. They won't always be low level so us veterans need to show them the ropes, the trucks we've learnt how to share legendary kills in events and such. But I've still been able to complete the Queen fights and I love all the extra ads for experience so I probably don't have your level of frustration
---
I opted for an auto grenade/explosives build with a shotgun as a back up. Somehow without shotgun perks I do more damage with it than with explosives.
---
That's good to know.
---
How about some classic Appalachian folk music too? That stuff was better than bluegrass and is part of the origin of classic country, which was one of my favorite things about NV. Also appalachian folk is way better than bluegrass. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACD9NP4D_pU&amp;list=PLVW3gGu355M75CkEUrmmnel8naS1IZAGj
---
I'm 610 hours in and it's the first time I saw him, really enjoy it when I discover something new after all that time :)
---
Too bad ya couldnt. Trust me it's a lot better to go with the flow than cry about it. I'll be playing the game after my ride and Ill enjoy every bit of it 😀
---
resellers will just use their mules..
---
Psssh no. Playing devil went down to geogia ;p
---
Aye. That's a great one. 
---
I saw the wendigo in the grove and dragged it out of there and ran back to the bunker to attract the rest of the players. We let them fight for a while but then time was getting on so we murdered the wendigo and then th equeen
---
Just imagine how many posts on here we would get about people losing gunpowder after they died.
---
Well its a sphere
---
*more rep, you get some rep no matter what, the amount is still pitiful
---
Oh and also a lot of it is FREE/no licensing fees.
---
i thought i heard before that this perk can make stealth builds not work anymore.   i would assume thats why
---
Pillars for everyone!
---
2 loops?
---
Well many players including myself were falsely suspended. Most of the actual duper’s were already banned and I have no idea why Bethesda gave our accounts a final warning for duping even though we didn’t even dupe in the first place lmao.
---
Then dont play the game and you wont anything to complain about it 🤔. Go invest in another gaming company.
---
Very true you need to use Bethesda RNG.  So the chance would he 20% Nocturnal Rolling Pin and 0.0001% Wendigo.
---
I hadnt considered it might be other players but that would be nice. The only wall I repaired included a message from me about how my camp got destroyed by sociopaths so maybe they just wanted to let me know that humans are not all garbage people. 🤣
---
bethesda
---
I got 15 strength 8 perception 4 endurance 4 charisma 11 intelligence 6 agility 8 luck I believe I have it. Luck I use bloody mess 3 better crit 3 the mutation thing 2. Agility I use 2 through hiker sneak 3 and the other one that makes you disappear. In intelligence I use 3 nerd rage and change all other ones around charisma I use 4 lone wander endurance I use rad cool and the strength one from 6 am to 6 pm perception I use all commando perks 3 3 and 2 and strength I use random ones like carry weight the ammo reducer and stuff like that
---
Since its a sphere you can place camp in for example a tree and then add some height 🙂
---
Bloodied or junkies. But if you don't wanna mess around with those i'd try for an instigating or Anti-armour. Maybe a furious.
---
How do you log off the game when you’re done?
---
Just logged in to check.  Still got my inventory.
---
Fucking dope.  😂😂😂😎
---
I used to avoid this like the plague, not because I'm bloodied but too freaked out that gun losing bug would come back. Now it's been some time since Bethesda said they had fixed that bug and no sign of it returning, I feel comfortable enough to run it. I equip a weapon I don't care much if I lose it and run the event. As a bloodied build that runs nerd rage obviously, it's not hard to run this event in my stealth suit with low health at all. It just takes a few Radaway to keep my health in check. I love collecting the ores so everyone can gain the xp and I basically have to be standing on top a glowing one to be spotted.
---
Also I have 4 out of 5 secret service armor unyielding
---
Anyone else having issues where you aren't getting double for your daily? I just completed a daily and instead of getting double I got 100 on top of the 500 it gives.
---
It's sad people would rather argue lunchboxes dont work and cry about how horrible the game is than admit this is a good idea 💯
---
delete the ally item. then place again. might take a few times.
---
Yeah I tried that too! Since found out it’s glitched anyway *sigh* 
---
Not sure how to power everything inside yet either!
---
Edit: actually it just randomly decided to clip! After trying many different combos! Also attached a wire to my vendors through the roof connector glitching through the roof LOL whatever works ;)
---
Um no, let's keep getting them.
---
Fix Missile Launchers and Fat Man damage, instead.
---
I’ve still not found that, though I knew about it before I got the game. I thought it was down near the Guidestones, maybe I’m mistaken.
---
Definitely 100% safe
---
Been running with some new friends that do 3 nukes and then run Encrypted, server hop and repeat. Usually have a decent group show up at all events, good times! It's what this game should be about.
---
He looks like he is about to enjoy  setting something on fire :)
---
Not Goni nt to lie it’s a bit all over the place but that’s okay if you really want to solo queen most people have a stealth commando build that does a lot of damage like I have that build and I can do 200 or more per shot with my fixer to the queen
---
I know I'm a little late to this thread, but this is actually a really good way to handle this.
---
I was initially thinking that you could use bars in order to select your desired amount of ammo to input, like when you're transferring a large amount of materials to your stash. 
---
But I definitely like this suggestion as well.
---
Exact same here...
---
jokes on you i have been wearing one for almost a 4 months in game now
---
It got fixed in a recent patch.
---
It's a free fast travel.
---
Sometimes I turn it off by accident. I find that one jukebox to be so quiet that unless it's dead quiet and I'm next to it I can't hear it's playing and when running in and see ghouls everywhere it's hard to visually check at the start of the event. Plus frankly it's hard to trust other players to initiate any objective other than kill typically. If they could turn the volume up on that one jukebox it'd be easier.
---
I’ve been sticking to private servers because I got my characters inventory hacked last scorched earth I really like playing these events as well just not the other people ruining it for everyone else.
---
It is nice but could be so much better! 
---
If I want to know what robots I still need to kill, I still need to go into the Challenge menu.
---
It is also weird you can not see the Dailies/Weeklies in the Legendary Run Menu.
---
I grinded for a weight reduced shovel... Odd thing for a commando build to grind for but now I always have my lucky exterminator shovel weighing less in my inventory for that daily
---
Same. They did try and patch something not long ago, usually break something at the same time. lol
---
My guess is that Bethesda tried to scare players with these suspensions in order to stop them from duping,and I also think that it worked until now.
---
PS: what can I offer  for 1 AA rifle and an armor set?
---
Well that’s because I played when game first came out didn’t really mess with perks just wanted to carry everything. Stopped playing after finished story then came back to the game in October and played everyday. Again I picked perks and upgraded cards to carry more. I can carry 580 with perk cards I use. I got my first bloodied axe a while ago and saw it was amazing and started trying bloodied and then when I got my first 2 star bloodied combat I switched again. I got over 80 level ups I might switch everything around to destroy her
---
Rule 2: beware of bathrooms.
---
lol the game is dead.
---
I dont understand why there is no wipe happened. This is so stupid even in bethesda standarts.
---
They reinstated duper’s and let you keep everything?  What’s the point in playing the game straight if u cheat and get away with it
---
Bans should be permanent. Bethesda just doesn't care about game state.
---
I'll go with number one here.
---
I always share strange in numbers
---
Or they are trying something new and tagging these accounts and the items in them to track them to see what happens.
---
Probably not.
---
Serious question though..your name.  Have you cleansed yourself in the waters of lake Minnetonka?
---
Simp
---
Now *THAT'S* a good time
---
Same, 1 cap for Missles and Mini Nukes, never sold them, ended up converting them all.
---
5 daily **challenges**
---
Shenandoah Riverrrr....
---
I’m interested in both what you pose as question/opinion,
---
as well as what the masses think is the best setup for power armor In general for a full health build.
---
It may be situational per set I s’pose...
---
I have every set of power armor,but never use any besides the excavator on occasion for nuke zones &amp; highly radioactive areas &amp; mining some lead.
---
But I have been thinkin about investing into some heavy gun perks,&amp; tryin too rock my PA a little more just too switch it up.
---
Yea I was in the same boat as you with the strength and just spread everything else around but I wanted a actual build so I saw that stealth commando is really strong and went for that
---
Gunpowder is so heavy it’s not practical to keep it. Just have enough acid and cloth, then make only what you need.
---
Because Bethesda wants to control you like the commies they are. Lol. 
---
Just kidding, maybe not. Great Idea though! 
---
I wish you the best!
---
I would say you have to close app on ps4. In my time zone the challenges reset at 6h00 pm so i try to not be online at that time
---
+33% vats chance will make it magic
---
Honestly, this needs to be in the next patch. 5% rng for an ultra cute fusion core. Turns you full uwu for time used.
---
Yeah, and we’re suppose to be able to trade more ammo at a time.
---
Stay away from decontamination windows though....
---
So what’s the point in playing the game straight. You cheat. Get caught. And nothing happens. Cheats obviously do prosper.
---
I was just messing with you, since you said there's nothing else to do.
---
Honestly, when my wife is at work, and my son is at his mom's, I'll play for hours on end, so no judgment.
---
And thanks
---
Yes. can 100% confirm
---
[https://imgur.com/a/NFaAvhM](https://imgur.com/a/NFaAvhM)
---
Most likely a farming group was in your server. They do 3 nukes and Encrypted then just hope serves, rinse and repeat haha. There are a lot of Facebook groups that post what time they are starting a let people join. Its a real good time! :D
---
I agree, this could be a much better feature if tweaked a bit.
---
Same goes for the Legendary Run board
---
We will probably never see this because people would too easily place their camps side by side. For the player it would make an awesome experience. Players could make actual communities, it would be pretty sweet. The problem being if you have a bunch of intricate camps I imagine it would be a real strain on the system.
---
If that's not the case then what the f Bethesda.
---
Interesting. I can try that. I’m stealth, so shotgun is my hip fire option. I can try VATS and see how it goes.
---
Even on pc? Ik fallout 76 isnt the most stable game but good lord
---
Assaultrons and sentries also spawn in the basement of Arktos Pharma.
---
Strong Back is good early with light loads but when you can carry a lot the other weight reducers are much better.  If you have 3 heavy guns, Bear Arms is point for point much better for instance.  I'm carrying about 8 heavy guns right now waiting to turn to scrip 5 of them would be almost 100 pounds in stash but only 10 pounds carry weight.  Same for pharmacy, batteries included, etc.
---
Yes it does. Strange in Numbers does not.
---
Ohhhh never thought of that thanks 👍
---
I didn’t know cheating was based on levels. You cheat. Should have been banned. Bethesda are absolutely spineless
---
Jesus Christ. Wipe them all.
---
What’s the point even?
---
thats raw, english and ps4 :/.
---
You start out in pretty much the center of the path, so you have to go out to either the campground or the roller coaster. Then you have to come back to where you started and go the opposite direction to get the ones you didn't do. Then come back to the starting point again
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Heard mentally only works when your on a team and next to your team mates so the description says. I have yet to actually test that though.
---
It used to be sold regularly before fallout first but it's been a very long time since I've seen vendors on xbox selling flux
---
I have one piece of armor with 25 rad resist effect and it holds up pretty good. still need a stimpak but you'll have time. I reckon 2 pieces of armor with the effect would be real good.
---
I'm such a tit.... cheers....I read as complete 5 dailies for some reason....o well 👍
---
This is why I tell new players not to fast travel
---
Not daily quests. Daily challenges. Just do the rest of the challenges and it’ll hit. It’s a freebie.
---
Yeah dude SCORE challenges not daily missions.
---
B3325
---
Its not do 5 daily quests (vital equipment/photo opportunity etc), its do 5 daily challenges (level up, buy 3 items etc).
---
To make life slightly more confusing, one of todays daily challenges is to do one daily quest.
---
I can tell you simple , one the ban lets them look like they did something, 2 the unbanning allows for the weapons to be circulated and used by newer player, 3 it prevents player from quiting out right
---
I guess he is not a very good friend when you are exposing his inventory here. lool
---
5% how about 76%!!!!!!
---
Well it was also making me do it more now because two nights ago I got 3 bloodied weapons from purveyor with the 300 scrip I had. And the fixer was one of them. Normal enemies I can do amazing amounts of damage but queen I can only hit 100 something to her head if it’s a sneak attack everything else was 20 40s something like that and 8s sometimes so guess it’s time to dump all weapons I don’t use to alts and switch everything
---
Thank you good person that fixed it
---
Same. I wish the jukebox made more noise
---
Love the little plastic animals lol
---
I mean, it would make a good mutation seeing as the drawback is radiation
---
Can I scrap you for screws?
---
I always leave world to the menu before I close app. I’m wondering if people who close directly from in-world are having issues because of that.
---
She doesn't care about "people", she cares about the person with the aggro.
---
Easily done, chief
---
True
---
You can walk through an active decontamination shower with Starched Genes 2 equipped without losing mutation(s)
---
IDK about starched genes1
---
Wow nice you got really lucky with the fixer and yea you’ll have fun with a stealth commando with that fixer mines is a b2525 and it does wonders
---
In most online games when something like this happen they rollback the servers
---
Calm down sugar, they already acknowledged the problem with xp turning off after 4 lunchboxes are open.
---
They came after me
---
With radiated heat
---
They tore down my camp and
---
My sheepsquatch plushee
---
When the scorched beast came
---
To mench our tender meat
---
And so cried the dweller
---
He cant be bleet
---
The technical reason for why it is how it is, is because it is much cheaper(Cheaper as in less CPU cycles, also easier) to check if distance between point A(camp center) and point B(object's center) is less than distance(max camp radius).
---
However, there should be no reason why Bethesda cannot implement this using a similar method, such as:
---
    if distance &lt; campRadius: place object
---
    elif distance &lt; campBoundingBoxRadius and isInBoundingBox(campCenter - campSizeByTwo, campCenter + campSizeByTwo, objectPos): place object
---
    else: refuse object placement
---
Then again, we are not on DOS based computers, this shouldn't be too taxing even if checking the bounding box each frame, we even have workshops which use non-convex shapes. Especially not on the server since it only checks *when* a object is placed, not when the user is moving a object.
---
So on one hand, I understand Bethesda's reasoning on *why* it is like it currently is, but I would not understand the reasoning if they said no. Would much appreciate if they could introduce bounding box based camps instead of circular camps. I've hit the ceilings on them before and it is weird working inside a invisible dome where some things will place and others will not.
---
The only reasons I can think of this bringing complications, is may be slightly more difficult to detect if it is colliding with a existing area, map bounds, or quest object(which I believe are protected?). But it would most certainly be worth it.
---
There’s nothing like having people just organically work together.
---
I want Todd Howard's Bane.....

Are it's effects Seamless Operation/Credibility/Quality Assurance?

I’ve noticed people positioning the nuke now so that fissure site prime is on the southern end of the blast radius, leaving room to fight out of the nuke zone but not as many fence and bunker options to stand on.  Of course people still bring tents.
---
Wait if you’re not on the ground she doesn’t land?
---
It’s an exp grind for most people  right now because of the score. In double exp weekend with another 135 % from buff, I was rocking a lot of score points from that one event.  Totally worth it to stand there and defend . I personally enjoy it when on one shows up and I can run the clock to zero.
---
No, they aren't. People are keeping their duped items. If they were reviewing case by case those would be gone.
---
*cRy MoRe*
---
Yeah I got a zealot fixer that has those prefixes but not the bloodied. I got mutants first which I used but combat did better and never bothered with the zealots prob going to trade. And I know how lucky I got. I never once got lucky with that. I mean I had 260 went to her said screw it. Got a bloodied lever action then second roll the fixer then went and scrip last 40 I could do that night and got bloodied Tesla . Amazing, but thanks for everything
---
You need to do about 1k damage in order to get the event reward which includes 4 random flux, legendary item etc.  If you do less or none you'll just get the 4 treasury notes.
---
I don't know how much damage you need to do to loot the body, I think it's a lot less than 1k.
---
What I don't get, is unless your selling items to morons for real life money - why dupe? The serious offenders would have all of the best gear as they can out trade anyone &amp; it leaves little incentive to keep playing the game. Why grind if there's nothing to grind for?
---
Would be interesting to see how many dupers end up quitting due to boredom.
---
Because they don't give to flying shitts what we think! Look how much fun the game has become. Grinding all the way ha ha ha! Lol. 
---
Sorry for the rant, I am just tired of this broken game, it used to be fun, and now I have to chace these stupid score points across a stupid imaginary game board. 
---
And the best part I was a committed player at 3700hrs!
---
Now I am finding better things to do with my time. 
---
What a shame, lining there corporate pockets is more important than fixing a broken down golf cart. 
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
That right there deserves an ultra cute fusion core.
---
Are you done yet?  You are by far the most annoying person ever.  I would feel alot better if they brought everyone else back but you.
---
Thank you, I am planning on using bloodied as well but it depends on what I get first. Anti armor sounds good, what about secondaries?
---
Meatbags? Do you mean explosive bait? Or....?
---
You can hammer me on a bench and make me hardened
---
Jesus, dude. Hold companies accountable. You're a fucking consumer. Why accept nothing when you could push for more and have a better playing experience? It's not a bad thing at all whatsoever lol
---
What about "not a new player and didn't know about sharing"? Hoping there are others like me haha
---
So you don’t want me to show the horrors of support to those who weren’t suspended? I make these posts to inform others
---
I did Flatwoods Agricultural for the Mr Handys, battlebots in the ash heap for the assaultron.
---
you can usually get get a number of eyebots And protectrons  at moma dolces.
---
2 turrets at mama dolces, the remaining turrets at any radio tower.
---
Do we have any idea of the numbers involved? If it is a substantial percentage of the player base, the negative impact on future income and good will may force them toward leniency.
---
I know I use to rock melee until I got combat rifle. I had my bloodied grognak axe and that’s what made me switch to bloodied. That and 2 star bloodied death claw do almost 1000 damage a hit with no perks but I always heard how nice rifles where so I went with that. I see those videos of people killing queen solo in a minute, 4 minutes, 10 minutes. I wanna do that. That’s my grind to achieve now
---
Yea they shoulda just showed their  P and L and said we cannt afford to keep the game running without them so lets put them on triple secret probation......that will work.
---
Tf is wrong with you? Did your dog die or something?
---
Many players were innocent though.
---
I haven’t met one yet but it’s hardly been a conclusive study :)
---
At the Wayward, it should be Mort (aka Jay aka Jason Mewes) who says "someone's in here!"
---
Leniency?  I get. Allowing someone they proved cheated to keep the items they duped?  That’s beyond lenient. Utterly pathetic
---
I upvoted for both the clever rhyme and the message! From my observations (and 2 recent failed Scorched Earth events) I agree 100%
---
His hazmat suit reduces his full power, that’s why he’s forced to wear it during nuke strikes
---
Please, find a other game. Dupers not welcome here.

Hey I'm from B.E.T.A too but I also read patchnotes which some of those others don't seem to do
---
Did you even read the post?
---
Like 5 of them a day.  Your back celebrate stop complaining every 5 min.
---
I swear the only times I died in this game is because I looted legendary mister Gutsies and forgot they could explode. Not only some monsters should be thougher but also be blessed with a bigger brain.
---
Nah but thanks for your concern.
---
I went back to Skyrim recently and played for about an hour before realizing why VATS wasn't working.
---
Flux disappears if you die, other than to radiation.
---
No class freak does that every now and then, they say it’s visual but it still effects my stats, all I have to do is close the game.
---
Had a Colossus randomly attack us the other day. The Queen landed and then I saw everyone with the fleeing emote. It was pretty cool having to fight both at the same time. 
---
Yesterday too for Project Paradise, idk what happened or what triggered it but when the Alpha Predator spawned so did a crap ton of Yao Gais. I didn’t even notice as I Vats at the Squatch right away, until I saw a bunch of people dying.
---
Utter bullshit. Even says on the emails people are posting. Proved duping. Final warning.  What’s the point?  Utterly spineless. Should have allowed them back, not a problem. With a wiped stash
---
What really sucks is how weak they are, the trade off of having something powerful at the cost of its weight would be good
---
That attack is not just radiation. It’s poison or acid, I don’t remember which. 
---
Suck it up and stimpack. 
---
Use serendipity perk to survive 
---
The scream attack can be mitigated with fireproof rank3
---
Dude I have been doing similar stuff since around lvl 80 when I started crafting shielded marine under armor.  I don't always do it anymore ..lvl 300 something but I still help out.  I love it when a lower level joins my team.  But I try and help anyone out.  Traded with a lvl 200 something last night an we teamed up until my game crashed so I switched to practicing guitar (gave her/he junk and then they needed more and wanted to buy it sol I sold it dirt cheap).  Always glad to hear of other people doing the same thing.
---
I mean even at .5% it would be code brown
---
That’s a big exaggeration. I post daily.
---
How hard would it be to sync up the instruments into real music? Just have a song playing with every instrument and unmute the ones nearby players are using
---
I need to start a new character as Bethesda decided not to recognise half my wastelander achievements 👍👍 13/10
---
His dignity died.
---
Can’t really answer that because different legendaries are useful for different players. It depends on your build. Im an explosives build. So I use explosive guns. If your a bloodied build then bloodied guns is what you want.
---
About the same thing on multiple subs.
---
Ours was a 3 star legendary in a nuke zone.  Not sure if it makes a difference but as far as I'm aware it is suppose to spawn wendigo with the name "Wendigo Spawn"
---
paying it forward!  I am glad to hear it!
---
I mean the Bunch of meat that you can place in you Camp
---
I do it because I have a 90% reduced weight fatman and whenever I get nukes I just shoot em.
---
Why dupe? If people didn’t, there would be probably about 200 B2525 fixers in existence as a quick example. RNG is why people dupe. Why not have a second one if the game deletes your items? Why not give one to a friend? Why not get it to trade for more items? Why not give them away so people can actually afford to get a god-tier item? There are less selfish reasons to dupe, though the majority of it existed in the ability to trade for items people wanted. This is why so many people can have end game gear at decent costs
---
You don’t have to like them, but you asked why would anyone dupe other than to sell for money, and these are reasons people have duped that don’t involve selling for real world money
---
Not like you can destroy camps or kill players anyways. They basically removed all PvP outside of workshops (which is horribly bugged on Xbox at least.) There's no way to get a bounty unless you hack or lockpick a players camp then you get a nice 5 cap bounty on your head.
---
The new consoles are backwards compatible.  So it's more an issue if they are going to upgrade the game to utilize the better hardware.  But there is no reason you shouldn't be able to play the current version on the new systems.
---
I had to rely on one when I was too low level and hadn’t acquired power armor.  I can see the appeal
---
Dude. I know people who didn’t dupe and have evidence they didn’t dupe but were still suspended. 
---
Don’t believe Bethesda for everything they say. They use a outdated system to detect dupes.
---
My dignity?
---
No one on this sub reddit can read all they know is green guy goes splat
---
Exactly. Gunpowder is not scrap or junk. It’s a finished, crafted item.
---
Never seen it below 200 and I buy all flux I see to burn caps because of the stupid cap limit.  I almost never see people selling flux.
---
Only if they add other music you can play.  The canned stuff is so repetitive and boring it's awful to listen to.
---
As a cannibal, EAT THE DAMN GHOUL
---
They are not something 5o be messed with when alone lmao. Not fun when someone decides to pull it to the people fighting the queen either.
---
Blood Eagles could be Watoga Underground
---
Originally, I was not specced for vats but the rubber banding made it impossible to use the toon. So, I tried vats and it worked better than expected. The gauss shotgun remains buggy as hell, but when it does hit, it hits hard. Best of luck!
---
Everytime.
---
I was majorly surprised not to see the Queen deathclaw from New Vegas or something of that type.
---
&gt; Just give me a deathclaw hoard event
---
And dress them [like this](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/30327)!
---
Check what armour you have on. I know one of the causes is armour that has the reduction to damage when blocking.
---
If I wear PA the shotgun is nothing special. If I wear SS armour (leg has blocking damage) then my shotgun OHK most things using VATS
---
Well I have tried fast traveling and tried to close the application, yet there is ghost budget. Also I was just informed by a friend of mine who did use the ammo factory glitch, is having trouble with budget.
---
I dunno bro it's not my policy and not my game 🤷 take that up with BGS
---
I prefer her not to land. Otherwise she dies in 10s and most people miss out on loot.
---
Not gonna lie. During 2x xp weekend I was just farming xp. But normally I gather ore from the 4 areas then wait till the last minute to deposit.
---
See the thing is. Literally everyone bleating they didn’t cheat when u check their trade posts have 1 of 2 things. Legacy  after legacy followed by B2525 for sale during the dupe. Or. No posts at all from the time of the duoe as they deleted them. I don’t believe anyone got suspended for nothing. I can only go on myself. I didn’t dupe. I did trade. I didn’t get banned.
---
yeah
---
Well considering between legion and talon there where over three hundred thousand memebers on those Facebook groups and they went empty after the bans i can say it was substantial
---
Every time I open a stall, I brace for a feral inside.
---
I'm always a little disappointed.
---
on Xbox atleast your progress is tied to ACC not console so it'll be fine
---
Bloodied_Mess did a video on YouTube about it :)
---
If your friend built it in your camp, that may explain it. Either way, contacting support is your best bet
---
Absolutly. Might as well cheat. Nothing happens
---
AND HEAL THE NPCS!
---
did you bring your A game... just kidding I feel you
---
Yes i have a 3* bloodied guass minigun
---
Jerks.
---
Also the more people there the more noise you need.  Once had so many people there even with every instrument being played and the juke box the bar was basically not moving and it failed.
---
Like every other event in fo76 it's a dumpster fire.  Fine solo but just complete garbage if someone else shows up.
---
Yes, much agreed. How is over encumbrance (which is what always happens to me) a reward? For the love of Atom, enough with the bloddy missiles and mini nukes already!
---
Awesome pic! I'd like to snap one for myself, do you recall where this was at?
---
&gt; I didn’t get banned.
---
That explains things.
---
Of course not, his sloped forehead prevents him from reading before posting lol
---
Not objectively the case, but in my experience and the experience of those i’ve talked to (minus the one guy that commented saying he doesn’t think it’s the case, which i’m not saying it definitely is the case), it seems that she has a difficult time working out where/how to land when people are standing on things or in the bunker.
---
Nocturnal, Hunters and mutant slayers are by far the worst 3 imo
---
Weapons disappear off my hotwheel all the time.  Never had it disappear from inventory though.
---
I don't sell it myself, but whenever I happen to see some in vendors, it always sells for 200 or more on xbox. I never buy it at that price, personally.
---
i mean if youre one shotting the enemies no need to heal, but people love to run around in PA with a melee and let so many ghouls get by them.
---
Yep roll up roll up. Give the duper your weapons for him to ‘mod’.
---
The game took your flux the player would have taken any junk from the bag. I now prioritize storing the flux before anything else.
---
Lol, probably a better percentage.
---
Commander Degeurre falling to her death and finally being silent forever.
---
Maybe that's just in my mind but it should be in the game.
---
Not sure about less selfish reasons to dupe - I haven't seen any Robin Hoods in game giving items to the poor :)
---
Hahahahaha! Saltyboi is salty. I told you whiny babies that we'd be back. Suck it up, buttercup 😂
---
Hopefully that’s true because fighting flying enemies is annoying no matter what I use or what game and it’s even worse when it’s an end-game boss that heals
---
What system? Cause I was fighting the 3 queens last night at once but no loot :(
---
Alright so definitely take my time with it and enjoy the content then 🤔
---
Challenge accepted!
---
I breached into a locked room at someone’s camp, slept on their bed, got the 5% xp bonus.
---
Cheaters prosper!
---
I’m on PS4 and can use some for a rad shower
---
That mod doesn't point out locations but is simply a lore/database mod. There might be info on where they might be or something but's just an audio/text database.
---
horde events have turned out to be fruitless, most time I show up and the boss is dead because they are fighting something else.  Importance of communication I only do if it's in the Canberra bog because the other places suck. Hemlock holes I do but I just gather everything before starting the quest.
---
the legacies you bought could have originally been duped. it’s not like just because you weren’t caught the first time you’re excused from future ban waves
---
You’ve never found the suitcases filled with crap at Whitesprings or bags full of Christmas presents and plans? Even if you haven’t, surely you’ve heard of all the other people who have. It’s not that uncommon
---
That is just South of Ohio River Adventures.
---
I love the reliable source of plastic golf balls there of course.
---
As much as I love them, it would have made a lot more sense to have music like this than the Beach Boys in here... I feel they're running out of 'Fallout music' to add to the games.
---
Had no idea why my stash was so loaded. Kept selling everything to cut back, and then...
---
142 missiles and 12 mini nukes
---
If I launch a nuke and it ends up being painful bc of other people, my next one covers the whole area. If we’re gonna make this painful, at least the rads keep the large number of low lvl players out. Not trying time gatekeep the SBQ from low levels, it’s purely based on the fact that each one of them buffs the queen just by showing up and likely cannot deal the damage required to pull their weight. I’m not made of ammo unfortunately lol.
---
Wow! I just did that too a couple days ago on Steam. Kind of annoying that my pre-existing level 300 character didn’t count for the ‘get to level 100’ challenge, but that actually didn’t take too long at all on an alt. The worst ones were the ally ones lmao
---
During the “happening” there was plenty of people handing stuff out to everyone or selling legacy’s for caps
---
The weapon also disappears from the screen and you then have both hands out
---
Got the same message so it probably is automated. I tried the dupe just to see if it worked but it didn't for me. Since I tried to dupe, I didn't fight the temporary suspension or complain about it on here. 
---
Received a final warning message just a little while ago. I think they sent them out to people they couldn't prove duped or people they suspected of getting duped weapons. Either way, I'm glad to be back and will not be trying out any more tricks in the future.
---
What platform? If this was recent it's the first time I've heard of this since that big inventory hack and emptying debacle.
---
I prefer not to spend 20+ minutes and thousands of ammo for a shit legendary drop.
---
Why? So we can get more 1* pipe wrenches as a reward?
---
Ooh, don't think I've been there before. Much obliged
---
Why being such an asshole?
---
I do it in this way, camp, twister, coaster, carousel. I jump down from the coaster platform down to the last one
---
Happens to me every time I play now. Literally every time. Takes a good 15 or so minutes to be able to play steady. Won’t get much help here though. I’ve posted asking for help and everyone blames your internet and downvotes you to hell.
---
you basically need 3 people to complete the event. 
---
3 high level or very strong people with one shot capabilities.
---
one person can take care of one entrance while the other takes care of the opposing entrance. Meanwhile, the 3rd person goes down and collects their 40 max ores, and then they switch places with one of the defended. and the previous defender goes down and collects all their ores super fast. finally, the last defended tags out the runner gets his max ores and they all deposit them at once or in intervals depending if they want to end it fast or farm xp.
---
total you should get 120 ores, 20 over the max requirement.
---
BUT PEOPLE ARE TOO GREEDY AND STUPID!!!
---
It’s not really a bug though as it’s because your base character is loaded first then perks, mutations, and carry weight bonuses from armor. I’m pretty sure it could happen in fallout 4 as well but I think it’s more to do with the fact 76 is an online game so it loads differently. Either way it’s not really a huge issue with the game..
---
The thing is though I had them during when all the other previous bans and suspensions were being handed out in previous waves.
---
The email doesn’t say you were duping and your on a final warning. Strange. Everyone else’s did.
---
Yup, with their modded digging/portal teleportation perk, they can virtually appear anywhere. Same goes for the radscorpions. When sniping radscorpions from a distance, I always feel like Jack Sparrow when he looked at Davy Jones though a spyglass far off on one ship and suddenly Davy Jones appears right next to Jack on his ship. That's some next level sorcery right there.
---
Nobody forces you to shoot while she is in the air, nobody forces you to stick around for 20 minutes. If you don’t like how people plays, get fallout 1st, launch your nukes on private and play however you want.
---
Good suggestion :) The problem is even worse with Bloody Mess, trying to find bits that have rolled away into a ditch somewhere...unless there’s a glitched torso hanging in the air which can be quite handy if a bit unsettling. And Gun Fu doesn’t help with orientation either.
---
It still shouldn’t be justified for them to give out a final warning if they couldn’t find any evidence though and that probably happened to me :/
---
Here's hoping
---
&gt;The new consoles are backwards compatible
---
Well that's a nice surprise.
---
 I wonder if you could play along with someone on a newer system, not crossplay like Xbox playing with PS, more like Xbox One players with Xbox Series X players etc.  Because when i first got my Xbox One i could play the 360 version of Dark Souls but couldn't play online with my cousin on a 360, i could only play with others on Xbox One which was understandable but sucked
---
I amend my previous statment you could stayed banned too.  But let me say congratulations anyways.  Im sure this is a great victory in a long line of them for you.  Please enjoy the game with the new rule set that zenimax accountants have added to the TOS.  Please dont call me buttercup anymore its wierd.  Stay safe 7-6.
---
Any idea what number he was on the ban list?
---
Truth hurt?
---
Nocturnal is pretty good about half of the time.  Credit where it's due.
---
Absolute garbage the other half of the time though and it isn't worth carrying things around for use half of the time.
---
This wont load for me, maybe because I'm on my phone?
---
Yes good tip, and like this the random encounters can trigger :)
---
Oh mine said I item duplicated but that’s far from the truth. I just own legacies that I kept ever since late 2018- early 2019 :)
---
It was justified in my case because I know what I tried to do but I understand where you're coming from.
---
One of my favourite things about fo4
---
Lol no sorry. If it was as bad as it seemed, they have A LOT of players to go through
---
And now i have to do the full lyrics. There goes my night...haha
---
Shoot, Im only level 39 but you bet ur ass I would have been there fighting along side you.  I love going to higher level events to gain experience on how to deal with difficult enemies.  Even tho joining high level teams does have its perks I refuse to let anyone think im just there for free easy rewards.
---
Items get dumped when people can't carry anymore,  Christmas presents now get dumped as most people wont accept them as trade item. Not dropped for the good of the community, but yes I admit that they are dropped in a convenient place.
---
I just watched his video. I guess the story about what happened in Kerwood mine would be a nice addition for his video. Hehe
---
Nope. But it is tough if loads of people stand on tents as it stops it landing, at least that's how it seems to be.
---
Did your email just say final warning and reactivated account. I cant check cause im at work
---
Do the settlers die? This interests me.
---
I was #18,000 something and I’m sure there were a lot more above me
---
Thanks for the response.  I use fireproof and serendipity.  While it seems it's poison attack, it seems to check against radiation resist.   I use stimpaks, but when using a weapon that has a spin up time or other, you can't always get the stimpak use in.
---
That's my main concern, i can deal with most things, just not losing my progress and items lol
---
Duping brought the rmt market to ruins- which Bethesda also states is against tos. Enemy of my enemy is my friend thing.. plus added new found wealth into the economic system. 
---
Dupers were put on suspension for a painstaking 2+ weeks which ignoring the fact many players play this game daily, it has ruined many’s chances of completing the season pass organically and stifled some people’s time-budgeted plans for achieving gold bullion. 
---
Also the punishment of banning dupers doesn’t really solve the issue or equate to a punishment equal to the action. Wipe the detected duped items sure but perma bans really? Do u also believe in capital punishment? 
---
Compare what just happened to a real life situation, imagine in the middle of a recession or depression we had an incredible economic boom when people learned to make inexpensive homemade versions for popular consumer products and then the government jailed everyone found “guilty” of making these products.  They then after 2 weeks let them loose, well... economy is better off, criminals/dupers r scared and you as a whiney bitch r able to continually get those consumer products u so surely are consuming. 
---
Duped items (likely) older then ur playtime in fallout 76 led to ur ability to garner any wealth both directly and indirectly, u got a berw laser rifle or a BEDRWA handmade(on Xbox)? Get off ur high horse and accept the place in the world that this necessary evil holds or write it all of abandon everything u have or HAVE TRADED FOR (because the trading economy is a product of the duping factor u so righteously condemn) and live simply with only what u find in game moving forward. Grow up dude
---
I know the one time before today that I had an autocomplete issue with the daily challenges (back when they were for atoms) it seemed to have been caused by entering and buying from the Atom Shop before logging into adventure mode, so I have avoided that since. 
---
However, today I logged in well after the reset, went straight to adventure mode (which took abnormally long to load and nothing seemed to be wrong with my internet connection otherwise), and all but one daily were “completed” — out of curiosity, since a few others said they had the same issue as me, was your one daily not completed the “kill 15 feral ghouls” and was it partially autocompleted at 10/15?
---
Lol of course not. And didn’t post a single time during the time of the dupe. Or maybe u did and deleted all your trade posts because u duped
---
The camp decoration one is unobtainable right now.  It will likely either be a Meat Week drop, or something related to the Wendigo Colossus questline.    
---
The loot bag gore pile was an atomic shop item that is not available right now either.  It may or may not come back in the future.
---
What’s the new rule to the TOS? I would like to know.
---
But my rights 😂
---
Like prison- everyone's innocent.
---
Edit- wow thanks for the award!!!!! :)
---
After exploring a few caves and running out of torches, you really start to appreciate the Pip-Boy light a lot more.
---
It’s going to be talked about a lot. But the bottom line is that, maybe many of those who duped/suspended were fallout first members &amp; they couldn’t afford to get rid of all of them &amp; ban them.
---
[opinion]
---
I’ve met one who went around actively giving stuff away. The other one did mass dupes to spread around, less to give everyone fun stuff, but rather because he wanted to crash the value of items sold for real value. You can’t sell what isn’t rare. He didn’t make it very far on that front
---
Nope! Never had a duplicated trading post. If you don’t believe me there’s a website that shows deleted posts on people’s thing including posts I  believe. If you want you can use it on my profile. I won’t have none whatsoever.
---
Ah ok. So if that happens just reload the game?
---
Like Improved Repair Kits? That would be really cool but if we’re being honest, I’d totally spend atoms for them because it’s not just helping me. It helps everyone.
---
100% of them? Could we see a screenshot or a statistic? I feel like you are full of BS and making stuff up just so you have an argument?   
---
Here, listen to some James Blunt, it may help you:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops)
---
lol are you surprised though?
---
You can edit it and put a semi colon in front of your mod list
---
The trick with guns like that is to hit R to reload and immediately H for heal with stimpack. 
---
If you didn’t wanna reload (Gatling Laser comes to mind) immediately switch weapons and back. 
---
Example using weapon 6 (mini gun): R, H, 5, 6
---
Are you really, honestly SUGGESTING that people lied about not cheating? It's SO obvious none of them ever did!
---
"Look How They Massacred My Boy" 😂
---
And?  Collecting ore is the safest thing you can do in the event outside of climbing on top of the decon showers and never moving.  The spawned enemies have priority targeting for the turrets, guards and workers.  You have to actually go out of your way to get their attention.
---
You actually have no idea how an economy works. Lol. And yes. Of course I belive in capital punishment. You take a life u give a life. Kinda way beyond the crime of duping. And no I don’t think perma bans were a good thing. But letting them keep the items the duped is an absolute joke and just destroyed the economy.
---
I guess yeah theyre more team focused
---
That’s my point.
---
If they were duped when you bought them, just because you didn’t get banned before doesn’t mean that there isn’t a chance you couldn’t get banned in the future.
---
Especially if that duped item then went on to be duped multiple times with this last ban wave.  
---
If a weapon  was duped way back and you bought a copy, and other people bought copies, some (or most) might have made it through the first ban wave unscathed. Then if some of those people then tried to dupe the same during the most recent dupe wave, when whatever they do to identify the items, it probably flagged you as well since all the items still have the same ID.   The investigation probably turned up the date it was added to your inventory and that’s why your suspension was removed. 
---
But the fact remains, that is likely still a duped weapon, and if they do something similar in the future, they may flag you again.
---
I was away at work &amp; only played for a couple of hours on those days &amp; i didnt see any of that. Did see people duping at stations &amp; I just kept playing the game &amp; ignored them.
---
I wholeheartedly support this Dead Space level jump scare. The wendigos even somewhat resemble the necromorphs.
---
I assumed so but wasn't sure I dont think is cowardous just greed imo
---
Depending on the financial status of developing company and parent company rules may be bent to retain profitable player counts.  Its right after mumbles being required to give you a nocturnal rolling pin every 500 scrip you spend.  And i know "you were swept up in a unjust banwave or whatever"
---
Hmm... Does it still show less dailies after relogging?.. Total score from all the latest ones should be 5000.
---
I just said i’d prefer not to spend 20 minutes and thousands of ammo. How does fighting her solo make that better lol.
---
Smart. Infinite screwing
---
I love perfect nukes. They’re just 😗👌🏼Mwah!! Perfetto!
---
Two shot auto grenade launcher goes ‘thunk thunk thunk thunk’, my go to when melee builds are dilly dallying while I’m trying to collect ore. 
---
And no I don’t care if I’m “stealing” kills/exp, I want to get to 100 ore with all the scavengers alive!
---
Edit: words are hard.
---
I mean I was giving out lvl 5 nw lasers and red dress to everyone that came out of the vault 🥴
---
Yeah. I’m carrying about 8 heavy guns too though that’s just to see if I like them or not. I keep forgetting that perks don’t work in the Stash Box so I put in like 3 guns and I’m like WTH how is my stash full already I only put in like 8 lbs total.
---
I got a mutant slayers ffr lvc handmade and westek couldn’t be any easier.....
---
Except the rewards don't suck, it's the only source of Radiation Barrels for your camp.  A camp item people endlessly whined about wanting Bethesda to add to the game and which they actually managed to do without putting it in  the atom shop.
---
Lol. I don’t believe someone who posts literally every day didn’t post a single thing for 6 days over the course of a massive dupe. Sorry I call absolute bullshit
---
I'm  a snitch in a facebook group for exploits. I'm just seeing their posts everyday, and I can assure you that all of these people have the same mindset.
---
I take photos of all the bears I find in strange settings
---
The gauss shotty should kill most things with one shot. At most 2. 
---
the major and minor are really only needed for the few things you cannot instakill. 
---
major - i reckon Limb damage especially if you run enforcer as your splash damage can cripple several enemies. Or 10% damage while aiming or 50% crit damage
---
Minor - 25% vats ap cost or 15% crit fill
---
Yup!  :)
---
You could be right. But what do I do then? I definitely don’t want to be suspended or banned again. Especially when I worked hard for my legacies. I can’t just throw them away.
---
Not one bit.
---
And also I don’t think weapon IDs for dupes or weapons don’t exist.
---
Proof ?
---
Just 2 pics of my special stats in and out of a team by myself showing the increase in stats
---
100%?! Well I know one who said he won't ever do it again so that kind of invalidates your claim!
---
Yeah, well I’m guess I’m not that "100" percent that will do it again. Lol
---
Suppressor, stalker, nocturnal, zealots, ghoul slayers and hunters I dump in the scrip machine right away. Bloodied, junkies, quad, instigating are all good depending on your build.
---
Edit: add mutant slayer in there too. Mutants is ok.
---
That’s probably my biggest issue with the game honestly. It’s crap that stable flux is considered a junk item. Springs and screws are one thing, but it’s enraging when you burn a bunch of ammo and then get jumped by scorched or some other creature right after the event ends and lose everything as a result.
---
The trying to crash the real money sales, now that's a good reason to dupe &amp; that's who bethesda should of been targeting - any eBay or those stupid website sellers.
---
So, you want to kill her with no effort, no time and no ammo? Sounds more like a YOU problem.
---
I take breaks from Reddit. But if you don’t believe me jsut look up the website I said. I forgot the name but I know it definitely exists.
---
The mod (link in description) is a must-have!
---
It’s an online game so it’s not as simple or fast as loading into singleplayer games..even those tend to have a couple seconds or minutes where everything isn’t fully rendered and loaded. This is amplified in online games like 76 because it’s a server with other online players and the quests can be random so it has a lot of information to load. Most of the time if you just wait a minute to move until your game is fully loaded then you’ll have no problems.
---
The typical:
---
"Mwahahaha... ah shit, i feel like a dick.... better drop some stuff to make up for it"
---
problem is! When a ghoul gets passed the people camping the tunnels they do NOT go after that ghoul. All it takes is a couple of ghouls and that's a scavenger dead.
---
If Bethesda is half as interested in the issue as they pretend, then perhaps they’ll do their jobs, investigate, and actually ban the account. But since they released it without even looking at it, I doubt they’ll bother. 
---
If any redditor here on the other hand think they can tell me the exact player I listed, feel free
---
Yup. Won’t work at all without it.
---
Snitches are 100 times worse than any cheater / exploiter
---
I bet u don’t wear a face mask either cause u politicize that shit too 🤣 go cry to mommy kid u just got wrecked
---
I had this happen during an event. I don’t have good power armor so I defend and I was like crap event is going to fail. Then last 10 seconds a guy deposits all but 100 ore and event ends and we complete. I haven’t received any good plans tho. But I have had this event complete like 4 times. Normally no one in the server even goes to the event and I tried doing it solo when it first came out. Yeah that was a bad idea lol
---
You misspelled a "level 1 feral ghoul". 'cause hell, if it's not a direct hit, these rockets/nukes barely do any damage at all...
---
They dont no that the event was nerfed.  Back in the day you could turn it off and get 30 mins of constant goul spawns which In turn made it one of the best to farm xp and legendary. It baffles me people dont no this, it happened a long time ago
---
Agreed, take my upvote
---
I once posted I collected 70+ ore, but it was probably closer to 55-65, after the deposit no one else collected.
---
I just assumed they took a role upon joining and stuck to it.
---
Do players want the higher level mobs attacking the NPCs or I guess that depends on what we're working with?
---
It's a fun event no matter what role I take, but I do really want that barrel.
---
I give no shits, old man.
---
I'm just here to offer my sympathies. It took me almost 2 weeks to figure it out.
---
He’s got a tiny penis that’s why 😜
---
It would be great for them to do a bluegrass overhaul. They could even theme a season around it. New instruments: mandolin, fiddle, maybe accordion. New instrument weapons, instrument weapon skins. The instrument melees are cool but in desperate need of mods. Electric guitar sword please. Have some nice old americana folklore tied around bluegrass questing. I don’t know any specific things about that, but I bet there is some hillbilly music mythology to go off of. Some O Brother Where Art Thou vibes(I know that’s more Mississippi... but whatever), know what I’m sayin?!
---
We can collect all the instruments in-game just to scrap them. I don't understand why they won't let us play them? We could carry them around in our weapons inventory and just whip them out and start playing them.
---
Lol how did I get wrecked? Do I even know what you’re talking about? What did I politicise....learn to spell.......hilarious
