For truth.

---
Shame we are unable to assign armor to a hot key, I could run all five pieces with my 1-5 keys as a quick fix. On PC.
---
Ive had a healthy mix which is weird because im fairly sure a few of them you were in. Obviously only the big ones if you havent played on a smaller map. 
---

---
I see you changed your gamertag as well. Props on the change. Made me laugh. 
---
Its absolute chaos for me when the small maps come. And i love every second of it. It reminds me of when NW came out and everything was pure panic.
---
From what I've seen so far, Dandy Boy Apples.
---
It's really just a scraptron with a beard.
---
There's negative vids about F76 made every day, man. It's not not that all of those youtubers want to report on negative things either. It's just broken bugs and so most news turns out negative
---
Yeah - those PC players are running riot and out of control. Though I wouldn't play on anything else.
---
Those lights were crap from the very beginning, I refunded mine long ago.
---
It was attractive at first but he like draws his voice out and over emphasizes lol.
---
Its chaos and i love it.
---
HAHA STUPID CAREBEAR FOOBUILD TRASH
---
Lmao yes.
---
Imo , and this is opinion is with cap , i just think that NW would be better if there was no perk system at all.
---
I tried to make it right, but im only one guy. Lol.
---
Lol. Might try that.
---
So it's the primed receiver that's causing it to happen. I couldn't figure out why it was happening to me yesterday.Have you tried it out of power armor to try and isolate it further?
---
Destroying.
---
Perhaps they should just get the game to a playable state and then leave it alone.
---
Yea, I know. I'm just curious what other people are using for the times when you actually have to fight, and not just run from part to part, dodging. I constantly have to knock things out of my way, get blocked, knocked out of the way, pinned in corners.
---
vats is my jam! with the right weapon mods they don't use hardly any AP... plus a portion of crit damage bypasses all DR/ER/RR. I was Melee build before I really got the gist of the vats/crits in 76. used them constantly in 4
---
That's what AAA generally means nowadays. A lot of the really high tier quality games are self published indie stuff from nerd who make games they themselves want to play.
---
&gt;All weapons reduce your movement speed when equipped. Some more than others.
---
This much is true. Holding a 28.8 lb. minigun costs 20% of your movement speed.  A 22.8 lb. handmade rifle and a 0.3 lb. pipe revolver (90% reduced weight) both slow you down by 12%.  You can verify this yourself with a stopwatch by running (not sprinting) a set distance with your weapons in-hand and then "holstering" them.
---
&gt;you only see these effects stacking on the heaviest of weapons. The change is barely noticeable because it's not by a large margin.
---
This part is false.  If you have Speed Demon, Gun Runner does not increase movement speed while holding a pistol.  Same for Squad Maneuvers and Strange in Numbers while holding any of the three weapons mentioned above.  I've confirmed all of this with a stopwatch while I was on a team.
---
Side note: Strange in Numbers works by multiplying your positive mutation effects by 25%.  The max movement speed buff is +20% ([found via datamining](https://i.imgur.com/IlkF9tO.png)) which happens to be the same amount given by Speed Demon.
---
I have to agree, what you say fits throughout business as they only act on $ incentives usually, unfortunately also the case with many charities.
---
I stand guilty as the other day purchased FO1st on a month sub, but I have to say as a predominantly solo player having the option to have the world all to myself is fantastic, all the doors are still shut and loot is still there in a pristine state. 
---
Taking workshops while standing and bumbling about is such a relief. I'm part of the problem, but my gaming time is limited so... needs must.
---
20c is too much for my needs atm, but I understand that others with more interests in the game (ebay sellers, dupers looking for god rolls to dupe...) can pay 20c or even more. They will have more return in any case...
---
Nah, if you don't want PC to have cross play, i don't want you to have it either
---
I don‚Äôt know either but I imagine they will be more abundant than the silo pieces.
---
Ummm, it's directly related to the LACK of damage missile/grenade launchers do though...
---
I can't imagine what's going on in Austin to allow such to go live in a AAA game, really just beggars belief.
---
Hugs right back at you üòò
---
yea i hope so.
---
Same for me.
---
üëçüòÜ fair enough
---
Well I use a bloodied ffr lmg or sometimes flamer, cryo or gatling gun . And if you always feel blocked, invest in pain train, a great perk to use. You can just sprint directly at them and they will be pushed aside.
---
Got one of those, and a boxing glove. Look out!
---
Lobby simulator winter edition
---
Not really, just seems miserable to hate a game but frequent a place that is all about the said game. Oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have a question about vault raids...
---
When I tried to do the raid I wasted soooo much ammo and chems. Is a melee build best for efficiency? Or should I expect to use alot of resources?
---
I get this too. For me it is only queen of the hunt. 
---
At login, I have the cryptid sample and have to turn in data. I get deposit sample (complete), amd wait for results (complete) but no reward, no exp., and upon reloging, I return to having the sample and quest to turn in. 
---
My pop a squatter is also bugged. Once a day, at login the mission is started with diamonds in their position. Just have to kill them. But for that I do get the reward. Next day event is half way done again.
---
I have a long way to go, I'm working on it.
---
Patch 17
---
there's certain perks that are amazingly good in there.  Blocker for example, the hoards of enemies down there are maybe 80% melee so this one perk can mitigate half of the damage you would otherwise have to deal with.    
---
But the real challenge is the puzzles.  Learning to efficiently get the tasks done that need to get done promptly is the difference between easy expert runs and failing on standard or even novice.  
---
You just need decent damage.  
---
PA is rather good for rad mitigation but it's not really mandatory for any of the missions outside of maybe the meltdown mission which has a lot more rads than the others.  This weeks mission for example you can get by with just aqua boy/girl to mitigate most of the rads.  
---
Lastly, for the missions with tons of insects exterminators is amazing and glow sight is a generally good perk down there.  Glow sight is a godsend when defending the GECK in meltdown for example.
---
It's broken in adventure too. A fully charged quad assaultron head does no little or damage.
---
Sorry looks like I lit the blue touch paper, I was agreeing with your comment, though I may have got it backwards ?
---
Probably not.
---
Well, this is different than normal bugs or Fallout 1st... Most of the gear system is broken right now... That's pretty massive.
---
I've been using a Vamps SS/S Grognaks and TSE Gatling. Been thinking of trying an Exterminators Ultracite Gatling
---
Ah got you , thanks 
---
I didn't know what was going on !
---
then why even play it.  There's better BR games that are just plain old fps games with little to no rpg elements.    
---
The perks, limited PvE element, and vast range of gear is what separates NW
---
We tested this yesterday. You can still go into the fire for a while, but visibility is very poor, and you do still take minor radiation and health damage. Assumedly, there are still loot boxes there that you can grab if you know where to find them (related note, there are also loot boxes in the fire on the full map).
---
We found that the best option was to get what loot we could find, divide it according to skill, and kill everyone else to equip the rest of the team. For example, I'm not great with sniper rifles. Someone on my team should get a sniper rifle and give me whatever they aren't good with. Working together, we can wipe out other squads and slowly get to our preferred gear.
---
&gt; zero vats
---
wut?
---
WTF?
---
Them giving stuff free increases their revenue?  Please explain.
---
Lmao thanks bud. You play NW on Xbox too?
---
Me personally, I use melee the majority of the time, but carry a heavy gun, for certain situations. I don't use a lot of chems. Just psychobuffx and lots of liquor with the Partyboy perk
---
Haha thanks, rarely ever show stuff I do just let others discover it for themselves
---
If deleting the affix (250DR) was the easiest solution then they should go for it.
---
Nice
---
There's nothing new there. They changed the code though. I believe it shifts constantly now? I can't remember.
---
Ive never heard of "lit the blue paper" before. 
---
Good choice of words there. Seriously. 
---
And i apologize. Its been a majority of hatred coming my way for simply repeating what Bethesda said. 
---
Like im the bad guy that fucked the game up. 
---
I saw the laughing and jumped to a conclusion that apparently wasnt there. For that, im sorry.
---
You sound like you run about the same as me
---
Ultracite gatling isn't a good weapon for a raid. I know from personal experience, you want weapons with high damage with decent fire rate  like that tse gatling. or an lmg. What you can do is upgrade the gatling gun with a speedy receiver
---
my legendaries range from 76-1000caps, all stars 
---
come by
---
im speechless i can only laugh at this clown fiesta
---
oh cool
---
[removed]
---
I would have sold the item to my friend, now my pipboy says I have around 10400 caps so I cant track how many I've earnt through scavenging. Should it matter?
---
Yea, I did that already. I also have a TSE LMG I'm thinking of using. The Exterminators Gatling laser was just a thought, I got it super cheap, just to play with in there
---
Yes, I've heard of it.  I've "bought" things from it also. Please explain how making the game "free to play" increase the revenue from the atom shop?
---
The achievement says to posses 10000 caps not to earn throughout the game i believe
---
I do. My gamertag is byellets x717x if anyone wants to play. My highest character is only mid to high 60s. Im not great. Possibly not even that good. I usually win twice a day or so if i spend all day playing. I really just jump on it to smoke a bit and have some fun before bed. 
---
Ive seen mook on a few times. Moreso towards launch. Dude housed me quite a bit. Lol.
---
English,  learn to speak it, bitch.
---
Like all things in life, you have to adapt. My team squad wiped a team that started off with a tube. Most of us had pistols and no armor. Keep trying different approaches until something works. I promise you, it's not impossible.
---
Zenimax isn't the issue its BGS management. BGS has always released broken and messy games since the beginning. They have rarely ever patched said broken games. This is the first time they have ever taken to fixing a game post launch fixes and it shows how inexperienced they are at this. Before fo76 they have always relied on unofficial patches and the modding community to fix their games.
---
Who knows.  I see lots of low level players, I suppose it's possible they're *all* alts, but they don't seem to behave like it
---
Expect it to be random like Legendary enemies, albeit more common.
---
Correct...it happened 8 times over about 2 hours.  Took a break and just before 7pm I finally was able to get past the ‚Äòloading‚Äô screen!
---
Where‚Äôs the point pleasant one?
---
They don't drop as explosive variants anymore.
---
Cool. Having fun is important too. Good luck
---
Since you spoiler tagged this already, do you want to know?
---
In this context? Battlecry studios, a startup that never released a game before they were bought by Bethesda Softworks^\* Not exactly what most people would call AAA (Whatever the fuck *that* means).
---
(\* Or some other part of the "Bethesda" empire).
---
Yea, running the novice ones to warm up. I like to go through and kill everything
---
Welcome to the brave new globalist hell \^\_\^
---
Don‚Äôt see why you got downvoted so much for this... just speaking facts
---
Sorry I didn‚Äôt clarify, I edited my original post.
---
So the setting for anyone on the friends list is broke?
---
Great so now if we want to find a rare spawn bot or anything I cant log without her getting kicked and lose the damn spawn. 
---
Great just another reason to cancel my sub Bethesda. Its bad enough you gimped all the cap stash/magazine/bobblehead and outfit spawns and dropped the enemy level on 3/4 the map. For fuck sakes get it together and show our game some proper love and support.
---
I didnt know it ever worked.
---
I think that it is called "Skeleton Crew" or something like that.
---
Please don't forget that Bethesda has other games in developing stage. Some of them are planned for ps5/xbox2.
---
There is a nuka cola staircase that leaked from new update
---
My take is that this is a bad update for the bottom 95% of players. Only the handful of players who can wreck with just about anything are coming out on top here. If you have good gear, we can take it with our crappy gear and use it on the next group. That's not really different than before, but I'd be pissed about it if I didn't have that advantage. 
---
The reality hasn't changed much... It's still the same core group of about 30 players winning almost every match on Xbox.
---
Very much so.
---
It‚Äôs unique to each person
---
Yes, there are better AOE options, which was the point
---
I understand that. But when you get to the endgame, boy are you gonna be dissapointed, well... most likely anyway. I still remember the early days of the game having such high hopes, seeing past most bugs because you know it's fallout after all and we have yet to see a fallout game without bugs and glitches. So i took it all with a grain of salt, but now... i'm covered in salt...
---
Can I get my camp to stop killing itself? Por favor?
---
Oh my God this is GREAT. Its like fucking history channel.
---
Thank you. To answer your revised question, no. Rad damage stays the same, but the ballastic damage increases. The TS modifier is supposed to be capped at +20% damage, I believe. Not sure if it's different for default explosive weapons.
---
If you find the rare bot just log out and go back in and it will still be where you left it...I do it all the time...It will reload its loot after you log back in...I can hit it about 5-7 times before it dies from timing out or some creature kills it
---
Silly person.  You know nothing about how badly Bethesda could fuck up something this complicated.
---
I have to adapt to nothing, the game was fun and the approaches were way more, now is a mess for automatics builds
---
You've gone as far as you can go, and you're one of the first to do so. This is just like the NW teaser quest that came out before NW.
---
There's a list all ready up on the reddit with a lot of ideas I'm guessing that's why you're getting down votes it's a retired topic I believe
---
You're very welcome !
---
Congrats buddy! Thanks for doing a video! I was too wrapped up in the excitement of it all to record!
---
Santatron is amazingly depressing.  I love him.
---
I caused close to 50.000 damage today, so I agree.
---
And severe depression.
---
Oh wow, that's tiny!! That's so lame.
---
See, im opposite on my personal take. I think this is largely good. I understand peoples frustration, i cant stress that enough. 
---
I think without shortening the amount of time we spend in pregame lobbies, it makes the shorter matches a little more rough. Constantly back at the main menu. 
---
Youre right though. In reality it hasnt changed much. And thats largely due to a lack of anticheat measures in my eyes. 
---
Im cautiously hopeful that some day itll all be okay again. 
---
On the whole though, i have zero issue with what they did in NW. Adventure mode is a diff story. Lol.
---
Ah, well that's a pity. Thank you for keeping me from scrambling around the vault entrance for the next three hours, though.
---
Here in Australia it is the 12th. Keep forgetting you guys are a day behind .
---
Fucking this. Why did they put this in ? What a MASSIVE waste for the people that made this, the people that played it, and the people that fucking paid the people that made it. DUUUUUUMB
---
Automatic builds don't have any advantage. Automatic weapons don't drop more frequently than the other weapons classes, and Automatic weapons run out of ammo faster. With a limited loot pool, that ammo isn't easily replenished.
---
I can win easily alone with commando, tank killer, tenderizer and bloody cuz automatic are the easiest to get and i promise u will die in 4 hits without armor with a normal combat rifle
---
wow, you need an explanation for that? Wow.
---
Congrats on solving the riddle!
---
Hopefully not comin off as a dingus...
---
But if ya just scroll around the front page fer a hot second,a lot of stuff Is jacked after the last patch,like massive amounts,more then anyone would care too re-list,&amp; literally everyone thinks it sucks.
---
Try N maybe steer toward more positive stuff until Beth stops ignoring us &amp; breaks the silence?
---
There‚Äôs a sorta ‚Äúnew‚Äù mini quest,&amp; Red Phantom stopped Into White Springs fer a nite too eat &amp; a pop...
---
Also building seems nearly uneffected besides some budget change issues.
---
Stay Blessed
---
Same. I also have the occasional laugh because people paid a subscription for hot garbage with a bow on it. I laughed my ass off when i saw a thread with someone saying that they lost all their hard earned flux in the premium scrap box.
---
Fallout 1st player: let me give in to this bullshit feature that should be free but was hidden behind a paywall. Wait where did all my scrap go?
---
Todd Howard: Taaadaaaa
---
Pretty much. Nobody complained about the next days reward arriving 6 hours early, or the event starting 6 hours early, only when it finished early (which was actually the right time due to the early start) then it was suddenly the end of the world.
---
This is why I always bring and eat cookies with me when I go shopping.
---
Thanks
---
Ofc keep dream my friend
---
I would certainly love some rustic wooden stairs, or perhaps a rickety set made out of junk!
---
Take a drink, while doing the drink animation you can spam collect, worked on sinks and water pumps pre patch
---
Is this still happening to you? I‚Äôve had this problem for about 3 months. Contacted Bethesda and tried solutions. Nothing. Clip below showing mine:
---
https://youtu.be/KQHQIgaWgi8
---
the problem is that the upcoming events are part of the patch.  So yeah reverting would fix the armor/reloading bug but then it would also remove the holiday event and the NW rewards.
---
Hey man, I think we're already friends on XB. I'm usually running with the same squad, but we're often looking for a 4th, feel free to hit me up.
---
Commando was the only automatic perk you mentioned there.
---
Landing 4 hits on me is extremely difficult for most players. Typically, they are dead before they get even 1 hit on me. Getting 4 hits on me would take probably 60-90 rounds for a single player. This isn't just exclusive to me. Many top players have learned how to move in combat to avoid being hit.
---
I just do it for the steel. You're right, it gets the gears moving.
---
As /u/nicholasleonov mentioned something in your setup is making you a outlier if you really have not gotten the broken legendary effect after reloading a ranged weapon.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'd be interested if you would do some tests to try and figure out why you don't have your effects break and what in your setup you change/remove to cause the legendary effects to start breaking on ranged weapon reload.
---
How to toggle private server setting?
---
We are. Earlier i complimented you on your name change. Lol. 
---
I am usually running with one other person, but if im playing solo anytime ill def shoot you a message.
---
No offense, but after the last two days I feel like this is the equivalent of complaining about the quality of the catering aboard the Titanic.
---
I bet they can't fix it and simply revert back to the old patch
---
the quad prefix only counts with a default clip, anything else is just added on top of the quad effect
---
Yesterday I went off by myself and killed a team of 4 with a crossbow and wood armor. They all had automatic weapons, except for the guy with a 50 cal. I ended up with 50HP remaining. This isn't impossible.
---
BTW, I'm an automatic build. Crossbows aren't automatics.
---
They can do math. They just nerfed the effect, just like two-shot (which is more like 1.25-shot). Back when there was more PvP, people complained multiple-shot effects were OP. 
---
So, here we are. Bad math and all.
---
Honestly, their only two viable option are to roll back the update, or cancel the free weekend. Anything else would be a total disaster, and could even be the final nail in 76's coffin.
---
Yep. My treehouse is about 8 stories tall I have enough "height" below where I placed my camp halfway up the tree to place a foundation but then the slightly decline on the ground means I can't place anything else on the ground level.
---
Seems like you get \~5 stories above and below the initial placement of the camp device.
---
Now that I think about it, I've never gotten a two-shot gamma gun. Wonder if it's in the drop or purveyor lists...
---
They're super fun, and they have *sniper* range, **791**. I tried taking them to end game before, but they only scratch marine, I had to run two to make up for the reloads, and you would be surprised how hard .38 is to come across at the end.
---
95 isn‚Äôt a multiple of 4. Unless you‚Äôre saying the the standard magazine has 23.75 rounds, it should be 80 if that was the case.
---
I think someone already said this, but team up like you would if you were going to play NW. Then join the private world. Should pull both of you.
---
It‚Äôs enough that I have to deal with Treadly, that condescending asshole.
---
I would love to be able to build robot defenders.

---
Your first mistake was believing they care.
---
Thanks :) 
---
Feels wierd when I see it, and people start calling me "bush", instead of "Mook", so I may change it back later, but I'm rockin' it for now
---
I‚Äôm high enough to love this idea.
---
Dude keep down voting me and keep dream
---
Or you could accept the potential consequences of losing your junk for dying outside the event
---
It's hard to rollback. Plus they need approval from Sony and Microsoft to push their potential update.. They should've done more testing before. I hope they'll take it as a lesson and open test servers quickly.
---
Thats alright. Thanks to ridre, im forever gonna be "bullets" now. Lol. Ive just accepted it.
---
Easy solution that should just be the way things work... Nothing auto scraps... Ever...  End of story.  You want components, you scrap it yourself.  Then it doesn't matter what order it pulls from where.
---
I grab a bunch of .38s at the beginning of each round but never use them. The way I see it, they weigh nothing, and I'd rather have them on my person than having that one random bush camper get the perfect shot on me. Better if he runs into a bunch of weapons and no ammo. I wonder how much damage they could do with full perks and a lucky bobble/magazine combo? Hmmmm...
---
The default handmade's magazine size is listed as 20 in the Nukapedia.  
---
So it's likely 20 x4 for 80 minimum, modified by the extra capacity bonus based on modded magazine size, which if your claim of Stinging Magazine holding 35, means a base increase of +15.  
---
Thus 80+15= 95.
---
Math.  It just works.
---
After nothing but bad experiences Ive stopped running it for now.
---
Someone bought a bloatfly or stinging part for 1600 caps? And I thought I was lazy...
---
Solar armor set with 3 pieces Sentinel's for the healing and damage reduction while I'm stuck on a terminal (before I completed the set I had 4 Sentinel's pieces on my Scout armor) , Junkie's plasma flamer for damage, and Blocker, Nerd Rage and Born Survivor to avoid being squished.
---
something is foul in Denmark and it is Zenimax who allocates funds(I know ID employees paycheck's say zenimax, i don't know if it's true for Bethesda as well)
---
I googled this today:  [https://jobs.zenimax.com/jobs?department=&amp;located=&amp;location=12](https://jobs.zenimax.com/jobs?department=&amp;located=&amp;location=12)  and something is clearly wrong with the overall situation there and Zenimax is green-lighting Bethesda's decisions(which would appear to be having a revolving door of employees working on a cobbled together antique engine b/c Zenimax was too cheap to splurge for modern tech) while the "A Team" who might actually know to work the Creation Engine have been Starfielding.
---
I just want those combined foundation/stairs from Fallout 4. Or just let staircases snap to one side. I hate having gaps in my stairwell and the steel mesh stairs look horribly out of place in most of my builds.
---
That said, variety rarely hurts.
---
Ok, I get it. Thank you. I still find I wired that the quad effect works like that, but it is what it is.
---
Nope.  I've gotten a Bloodied Gamma Gun and checked its stats on my Bloodied Build.  It enhances the ballistic damage, but not the Radiation Damage- which remains the base 50 rads.  So it seems that the multiplier is based purely on the physical damage of the weapon.
---
With commando, bloody mess, and a small guns, they list 54 dmg, still the worst auto rifle, lol.
---
I've actually seen this problem occasionally before the latest patch. Had people on my friends list that would join and get booted 1 minute later.
---
My vanguard armor and unyielding are breaking as well as chameleon pieces. It's a joke.
---
Completely agree
---
What went wrong with this patch? I played for a couple of hours yesterday and everything seemed fine to me.
---
Yes! Later on it becomes more of a story but theres still that extreme lore aspect of it
---
This is what the community asked for??? #classicbugthesda
---
Well, there's the nicer wrought iron stairs, the recent Vault-Tec Stairs, and the new data-mined Nuka Stairs.
---
This is me, my main defence is not getting hit in the first place which requires me to not be seen.
---
I also returned two days ago and was getting my feet back for the game.

The previous games were able to be 'fixed' with player made mods, can't do that with the 'live service' that is 76.

I'm pretty sure that all of this is actually for one of the main Wastelanders quests since if you go to the wiki page for Wastelanders all these items are listed and are listed as part of the quest 'Treasure Unknown'. Most likely dataminers found the items before they were added and found that they were linked to that quest.

BTW just ended up second against a team, manage to kill everyone alone with an assault rifle and a scout armor, but not the mr handmade guy last of the enemy team , i take 5 hits to kill a man with a marine armor with my build with an assault rifle, u thinking that fair? Not in my opinion we need balance not map based on how many have the patient to wait in the lobby
---
Yippee Kiyeah should also be included in his soundtrack.

Correct

The max is 9 stories. The building bubble is a sphere, so you have to place your camp, build up a few floors, place your camp module on a tree branch or some other elevated object, and then start your actual build.

They are investigating this issue. Lmao!!! #classicbugthesda

I'm not down voting you, bro. And it's not a dream, I get videos of my gameplay. I could post a video of a fight I had with 6 players at once. They all had automatics. You can count how many rounds they fired if you want. Just by moving intelligently, I managed to kill 3 of them and down the 4th before the others managed to stop me. You think they could manage a sustained firefight like that on a smaller map with limited ammo?
---
Melee builds:
---
RIP 85 round drums. Qe handmade use to be a brute.
---
I haven‚Äôt experienced any of those problems. I‚Äôve played since the beginning. And played for a couple of hours yesterday. Maybe it‚Äôs just easier to fix on console? Idk.
---
FWIW, the names glitch out sometimes and list a secondary effect like that, but fall damage isn't actually a primary effect so it doesn't break with the reload bug.
---
Thanks dude I love doing this stuff in fallout it intrigues me
---
Yes, they're all craftable skins and outfits. All are useable in Adventure Mode.
---
See! There you go! Here's what I'd suggest - the Assault Rifle doesn't do as much damage as a Handmade. You won't always have time for a headshot, but in a pinch, aim for the torso. As soon as the first shot connects, practice sweeping your cross hairs up ever so slightly to get easy headshots for double damage.
---
PS4. I hoping to find some generous souls as I‚Äôve just set up a new account and rolled a new toon so I am starting with nothing again.
---
Yes.  Plz.  And those metal stairs suck when you're trying to alter a construction.
---
Obsidian released The Outer Worlds which is considered a Double A game but did a better job then the supposed Triple A game 76. Funny considering I was able to get 76 on sale soon after it was released, that was a red flag.
---
Can be used on all your toons
---
if it has the less vats cost legendary, and it can swap between semi and auto receivers, you can make it consume zero AP in vats. basically pipe rifle, (not bolt-action) handmade, or combat rifle (includes fixer). reflex sight, any auto receiver, Swift magazine, aligned stock/grip, aligned barrel, legendary effect. nukacrypt breaks down how much each mod reduces AP cost in vats. then shoot through entire clips without leaving vats. concentrated fire increases accuracy after each hit.
---
Challenge section
---
Lol yeah sure I'll try to see what could be my 'fix' for this bug.. dunno where to start but I'll try to test :)
---
They should've taken it as a lesson a year ago.
---
find the plan for handmade.
---
Anyway thank you 
---
my steam  [https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecooldue/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecooldue/)  make it easier for help when i need it :)
---
How do I get hit once with a tesla rifle then die pvp fallout 76?
---
Agree.  in my first game I actually did grab it, and maxed it, and realized only too late that its garbage in 76.
---
FOR FREEEEEEEEEEE
---
Domino effect, hoping something bad happens to someone literally can lead to actually threatening someone. And the fact its over something like a game with means he is way too invested into it and needs to go outside take a chill pill. Reacting like that to somone trolling you in a game just shows how weak of a person he is and anyone who agrees with him. How about reacting like this: oh this guy is cheating that sucks, I guess I‚Äôll block him and leave his world maybe report to bethesda (not that they will do anything but its worth a shot, maybe get a screen shot and get others to report him, oh wait this sub doesn‚Äôt let you post links!!!). But at least its an action thats rational and might help instead of bitching like a crybaby and wishing they get a disease.
---
Please don't imply that Starfield/TES6 will be on creation, please.
---
First check the corpses outside of vault 76. On xbox its pretty standard to leave care packages for players leaving the vault on those bodies. 
---
I dont have a ps4, but do they have "looking for" groups like xbox does? Maybe put up a post asking if people have stuff for low levels. 
---
I know i keep one of my vending machines stocked with low level weapons and armor and some stims and chems. Food and water. Basic care package stuff thats all listed for free. 
---
Im just south of pleasant valley station on the bluffs. Just outside of the forrest region. I figure by the time level 15s or so get to that area that they could use some supplies. 
---
"It may be a wasteland, but its OUR wasteland."
---
According to the leaks, it's what's funding Wastelanders
---
Is there an actual quest your start or is it just a big scavenger hunt kind of thing?
---
Dude M9G7 on csgo steam account I've played csgo on global,1300 hours on it, i know how to use my cross hair, this game need to be balanced for everyone, if someone is shooting the sky is not my problem, i can't kill so fast with a weapon that has 30 ammos, this need to be a fun game it's not competitive.. More fun is not meaning endless lobbies
---
I'm pretty sure I bought mine from one of the vendors on Whitespring, I just can't remember which one.
---
I guess theres a bug where when you reload it causes all your legendary armor effects to no longer work
---
my steam  [https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecooldue/](https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecooldue/)  make it easier for help when I need it :) Almost done for a bag  just need do a nuke for codebreaker I almost did last night till some came in and it reset everything and uped the level of everything :/ Then i have medic for antibiotics and stimpak diffuser is underground raid.
---
Highly unlikely. There's still enough people who absolutely love fo76, that in spite of the the most recent inclusion of new bugs, they'll still fall all over themselves fawning over the game, expressing their undying love for it, and play it to their hearts content.
---
The corpse trick got patched out this week I think. I‚Äôll keep an eye open for your camp though :)
---
Alright thanks, just wanted to check before I wasted my time lol
---
They introduced new assets into the game.  How do you roll back the patch without rolling back the asset inventory?  I suspect a rollback of the patch would involve a rollback of all progress and the entire world to pre-patch.  And that's not going to happen.  Splitting the patch to roll back just the 250DR change might be possible and  that's probably what needs to happen.  Unless they're trying to 'fix the fix' in which case God help us all...
---
I think they are random spawns in the wastes. No vendor sells them. They are in the pool for the Christmas event though.
---
Hell yeH
---
I‚Äôm gonna have to look into that. I haven‚Äôt noticed anything with my crit meter filling slower. Still fills up super quick when using my legendary shotgun
---
If you can make your way to Fort Defiance, do the BoS quest that allows you access to the computers... I think once you unlock the system, then return to the exterior terminal right near doors where Line in the Sand is held, you can requisition the Brotherhood Recon Rifle Plans, which are baseline *AWESOME*.  Craftable from Level 1 through Level 50, with baseline Hardened Receivers, Recon Scopes, Suppressors, and Stabilized Barrels.  I make them at low levels and give them out to every new player I see when I am playing.
---
You will have more luck with YouTube search for a channel called newthinkable or search ‚Äúx minus one‚Äù. I got addicted to them too.
---
If that's the solution they go with, then I'm fine with that. As long as I can autoscrap in the scrap box still I'm good. I always remember to stash all the things I want to keep anyway before I go to the scrap box.
---
I‚Äôm an idiot...I overthought it and was looking for a ‚ÄòHalloween‚Äô section among the various others. Thx!!
---
even better is that some modder after launch claimed to have found code hooks similar to the voice chat config but without an adress for the game to connect to so maybe there was a textchat planned but got scrapped before launch
---
I havent been able to play since the update so cant comment personally. But some bugs only effect certain consoles
---
Not talking about how easy is find cheaters in this game
---
dammit I clicked on "OK" about 5 times before I remembered it's a picture... I play this game too frickin much
---
I am so sorry but it has been confirmed
---
Destiny literally doubled their playerbase when they went free to play. They were in the same boat as Bethesda with a dwindling playerbase. In fact they did not have at near as a rocky start or persistent problems like 76. The price of the Destiny 2 base game was being sold for as low as $3.99 for a physical copy, which is where 76 is right now. Once Destiny became FTP they doubled their playerbase and reenergized the game. Dou leaves the amount of players means double the chances that a player will purchase from their cosmetic store. 76 is dying, and I hate to say it but I really doubt Wastelanders will be the shot in the arm this game needs before Bethesda decides to pull the plug. It already has a FTP model with Nuclear Winter (like Fortnite) and the base game is literally $3.99. Yes Bethesda might lose a little income at $3.99 per copy they sell, but think of the millions gained from Atoms store purchases with a doubling or even tripling of the playerbase. Wastelanders would be the perfect time to make the game FTP and generate not only a new refreshed player base but also a new buxx around the game. Millions of new atoms store purchases will vastly outweigh the insignificant loss of revenue from people buying new copies (which frankly the public will not do anymore with the bad press and reputation of 76.) I hope that answers your question.
---
The first one eludes me to no end
---
I was wondering why scorchbeasts were going down slower after a little bit. Also my 50 cal has nowhere near that damage as an end game legendary, wat o.O
---
Did you actually check the amount at one of the pioneer scout vending machines or other place where these things are used, and not just under the collections tab? 
---
There's a glitch that sometimes shows 0 in the tab even if you still have them. The same thing might cause it to show values from a previous character you were just on, if you keep hopping back and forth.
---
one big scav hunt
---
It's sad that people are so dependant on legendary armor sets that they can't play without them
---
the school?
---
Its hilariuos that OP mentioned the berserk build is very strong now.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm gonna server hop one more time.
---
PC player here. I play NW pretty regularly iv only encountered 1 guy who was definitely cheating and 2 others i suspect were cheating. Its not as bad as pc reputation seems to be
---
The Grenade Launcher, Auto Grenade Launcher and Fatman, yes, conditional with Missile Launcher, with auto targeting mod it does full damage with one but 1-3 with the second and sometimes the first doesn't hit but the second does for 1-3 damage.
---
PS4?
---
You don't want them to fix it. They will break the whole game at this rate.
---
‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù seems to happen a lot with Bethesda
---
i would say it's still worth it fast travel to the quest "a line in the sand" when you can and snag it
---
No worries, the internet is hard sometimes,  subtlety in text chat is not easy without loads of emoticons.
---
Light the blue touch paper comes from fireworks, at least in the UK the fuse is always blue, was when I was a kid anyway üòÅ
---
Right now most weapons in 76 are bade of cardboard and balsa wood.
---
I'm sure I've been crit killed by Super Mutants, one shot and dead right through my armor like it wasn't there.
---
Yeah, i had to look it up on google. 
---
Like ive heard of flash paper and what not so i could see where you were taking it, it just kinda made me do a double take. Kudos again. I think i might snag that for personal use myself moving forward.
---
I played it right when it launched, enjoyed it. I've read they added a lot since then
---
Until they reduce the pricing of things, I certainly won‚Äôt buy stuff. Costumes for 900 atom points, not anytime soon.
---
They won‚Äôt lose anything the community hasn‚Äôt changed the people who have sunk 100$s into the game won‚Äôt walk away from something that‚Äôs now truly a investment.
---
Is that confirmed to work?
---
Everybody rushed to pay them a monthly fee for a broken game with no content.
---
They have no incentive to improve.
---
No offense taken, I learned a new word ;) tbh I almost run with same kind of mix of armor as jondeerryder so it's kinda intriguing to try and figure out what makes me not experience this bug.. do have plaguewalker mutation dunno if that affect anything,
---
OP is suffering from fucking stockholm syndrome.
---
All my armor is broken. My weapons have lost a ton of damage. 
---
Bethesda keeping up a wall of silence about the issue is really provoking. 
---
I‚Äôve spent over 700 hours building my characters and grinding for good gear. The state of the game as it is now, makes all of it pointless.
---
Do you even realize that adding assets to a cash shop is nothing like the complexity of patching gameplay?
---
The cash shop is a wart on the game but your lack of comprehension here is pretty staggering too.
---
I assume you have a full set of five Unyielding? Then you should be loosing 15 from each instead you lose 12 so four of the five effects break.
---
How DARE YOU ask Bethesda/Zenimax to enact a change that makes sense.
---
I noticed my liberty prime armor absolutely spans out voice lines when I reload now
---
A gun shouldn't be so good that using anything else is foolish.
---
typically if you log out and back in it will, it's actually a B.E.T.A. age bug that mostly went away that seems to have go nuclear during patch 15.0
---
I would disagree with that hoarding thing
---
Egoviking, Main Element and Sabahe. All on Twitch. 
---
Also Medic1556, but he‚Äôs a food build and kind of annoying to watch as he keeps complaing about being overencumbered, while lugging around 400 each of stims, superstims, water, nuka colas etc. Knowledgeable, though.
---
Thanks for the info, do you know if there‚Äôs any more stuff other than the 1 terminal near the vault door?
---
 I would be surprised if anyone didn't have horrible fps
---
ok,nice!!!
---
N-NANI!!! How do you carry shit? Do you pick it up somewhere? Get it from the tire toilet? Do you crap in your hands? I wanna carry shit, so I can fling it at other players when they get near üòâüòÜüòú
---
I hate the smaller maps!
---
I did for a while, but Instigating sledgehammer has it beat for weight
---
I agree ! I wish and hope for the fast return of the normal sized maps .
---
It feels like a death match instead of battle royale at the moment and i really dont like playing a mindless shooter with no strategy ( and no weapon half of the times) .
---
I am playing the NW mode daily since day 1 and never have i seen a lobby with less than 18 players . When that happens ,the lobby gets closed and we are all back to main menu .
---
This is on PC by the way .
---
Yeah this would be nice. I know it can take a long time for games to download for me on Xbox
---
Even the most super unluckiest player ever has a better 2h weapon. I keep mine in the stash, along with the outfits I don't wear, like fireman, pirate, etc. 
---
Most of those cool rare items are collector's pieces. Like bobbleheads.
---
We do have ‚Äúnews‚Äù if you can even call it that, a staff member replied to a post like this saying they‚Äôd had a hot fix out and they‚Äôre working as fast as possible
---
Also fallout first subscription should be extended
---
^this. DO WANT
---
Definitely. I feel bad for those paying a subscription fee at this time.
---
Confirmed ps4.  I thought it was just me being tired earlier. Just did berkley springs and boomer - quest disappeared like normal, no gear or xp
---
Stop
---
It depends. If you ask me, nothing beats explorer/scavenger. Looks like something people would do. Engineer comes second, drifter comes third. 
---
And of course, BoS, which always looks good.
---
Nah. They do it for the same reason Costco puts their $5 chickens in the back. You have to pass by all the expensive stuff
---
My junkie‚Äôs handmade has lost 30 damage points per bullet. That‚Äôs a lot for a commando build.
---
I had problems with vendors, which wouldn't regenerate their caps. Had to stop playing for three full days for them to reset.
---
I'm sorry you don't like literal puns...
---
I'm just enjoying myself üòè
---
I even upvoted the OP... But I thought it was funny üòú
---
Where can I see what all was data-mined?
---
Your welcome
---
I used it for like 2 hours and then it sat in my stash until we could mount them on the wall.
---
I'm new what do I do with my scrap
---
What country is that ?
---
Thanks... I bought it because of you saying it worked üòâ

I have 2.. 1 hangs above my bar the other I keep with me and use alot but there is definatly better out there.. I just like the way it looks
---
Exactly, paper bags disappear as soon as you log out. Use an in world container instead.
---
Especially a donut shop you wana make those fuc.. i mean customers smell the diabetic inducing goodness.
---
yeah i had this this morning but when i dc'd and reloaded it was fine and has been since
---
Fallout Fist is my cousin
---
As far as I know it‚Äôs completely random I‚Äôm level 130 and I‚Äôve only seen 2 however you can do the enlightenment event to see one
---
You get the plans by playing the game when you are around level five. When you are doing Responder stuff, bowling water, Cooking in Flatwoods, etc. BEFORE you go to Morgantown Airport. So, really early in the game.
---
Yeah, it started happening to me a WHILE ago. But when the grafton mayor bug came about, it stopped happening. This morning i played fine. But now its happening again.
---
Near a church where there is an inclined true trunk
---
It is not so bad... Not all players have problems.
---
Great find, man! Really cool!
---
I have a feeling he's doing something to my brahmin to get all this fertilizer.
---
Tell me more about this ‚Äúhidden room‚Äù
---
I laughed.
---
They will spawn on Legendary Scorched in places where Scorched normally spawn, with no daily limit.
---
I like those i used to have them but stupidly got rid of then to "free up space" they're only .1 lol not that heavy
---
Wrong sub your looking for market 76
---
Feral Todd Howard... Goes around shitting on all the players.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to do this once I get off work tonight!!! Love the detective and missing cases (missing person cases from van Lowe and harpers ferry, and the imposter sheepsquatch questline!) these are my favourite type of things!
---
Wrong sub, bro?
---
No it‚Äôs more fun hunting ... said no one ever
---
I too have a treehouse and I didn‚Äôt realize it had to do with where the camp device is placed! My camp device is now located on the third story so I bet I can go higher now, however I‚Äôm already at about 95% build limit so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Lol thank you, I‚Äôm glad someone found it funny! Seems like jokes are taken as personal attacks nowadays
---
As some one with both of those they are great. But the Stangler combined with an exploding plasma will make you crash if you spray her for more than about 3 seconds. You are better off not being in Stangler for the queen
---
Platforms cost so much lol. I built the frame for mine and without walls I was at like 50 percent. Hope it helped alittle tho!
---
Agreed. Very little sense of humor on this sub.
---
Bethesda should hire me as their Vault-Tec rep ;)
---
There's a cryptid daily in the mire that spawns him from time to time. I've seen him most often in the area between the savage divide and the eastern side of the map usually in the woods not really near anything.
---
It could at least have the weight reduction effect like the All Rise. It looks cool, but weighting that much and being no better than a couple of other 2H weapons, it's a pain to keep it in the stash with the daily struggle that is to keep mine below the limit.
---
It didn‚Äôt. Simply put you can‚Äôt drop below 1. That (-) shows your personal SPECIALS are higher than your current level, I.E. your intelligence is being hit by a negative effect. It‚Äôs not -9 dropped by 20, it‚Äôs 9 dropped by 2
---
I spent a good portion of yesterday running around naked... aka without my legendary armor perks...  it was a challenge. And it was great. Shit like this sucks but it wont stop me feom enjoying some sweet sweet lemonaid... also my armor didnt break my weapons still kill and im a damn dirty filthy casual so feel free to ignore me
---
I want a Free tab too
---
Get your cut!!! Claim it as a Fallout 76 influencer üòâ
---
I think full crossplay for the base game would be better and only console crossplay for NW
---
1) So us B.E.T.A. age players have baked in bugs that keep some Daily events from triggering, it's not known why (as far as I know) but which quests are broken seems different for each player.  
---
For me it was the Pumpkin collection and another I can't remember.  
---
Odd thing is some player report it carries over to NEW CHARACTERS on the same account.  
---
2) Thanks, documented and reported.  
---
3) Awesome, try maybe a vault suit and see if it happens still?  
---
4) Interesting, will document and report, added to the Patch 15.0 page, thanks!    
---
7-8)  Interesting, if you find more info or can narrow it down, let me know!
---
I swear for about 2 weeks straight it would spawn for me twice a day, maybe it was a bug or what but it became annoying, and before that i was saying exactly what u were saying so be careful what u ask for. I have seen it spawn from whitesprings over to Harper's ferry so just go wondering around and eventually u will run into it just make sure ur looking because it will show up and just stare at u until u engage it. Good luck hunting
---
Have you gotten your help yet?
---
What do you do after turning on the black light?
---
Happy to help and double thanks for the link!  
---
Will add to the page!
---
I fucking died at one of his lines. "Ho ho ho, where are my little elfs? No, seriously. I fear for their safety."
---
Nah I haven‚Äôt if you have PlayStation shoot me an invite and friend req
---
I haven't been crashing but my game freezes for a couple seconds when I try to aim down sights or use vats
---
Alright, gimme a minute and i'll be on
---
I agree, or throw some atoms our way, but would prefer extending double xp followed by a half off sale at the purveyor
---
Cool thanks so much man
---
A lot of people like me didn‚Äôt solve it, we just followed a tutorial like this for the map fragments lol
---
I might be wrong but believe the BOS under armor has the best protection but it doesnt have gloves, the officers BOS under armor i think
---
Was linked to your post, hope you don't mind, cited you as an example in the bug roundup for this patch.   
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 16.0 | December 10, 2019 or "The Grinch that Stole Unyielding Armor"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e90rer/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)

Exactly.  The subscription is literally charging people for quality of life features that should mostly be free.
---
Thanks, added to the list of issues!
---
I've dropped paper bags between characters many times on my private world.
---
Tommorow you gonna be on juicehead üò©üò©üò©üò©
---
Ouch and thanks for the followup!  
---
Last question, had his happened multiple times this patch?
---
A wall of silence?  For fuck sake it's been what, a day?  And they already had a community rep comment in multiple threads here that they're aware of the problems and trying to push out a fix asap.  Do you want fucking hourly updates?
---
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll......  
---
But seriously, yes some things did, just the new bugs introduced were fairly epic.
---
It would be the best 2h melee weapon if it could just gain legendary effects. But it can't, so it's one of the worst for now.
---
On PS4 I crashed twice in 10 min ive never crashed in like a month before
---
THERE'S A SINK?
---
Once, I was in pacifist mode trying to kill a wanted player, I kept snacking him with my sledge and nothing was happening. I though he was cheating so I reported him, realizing I'm a dumbass, I sent a ticket in to tell them I was dumb as f*ck and not to punish them lol
---
Ill look into it if I can get my hands on a set.
---
Let me know if it doesn‚Äôt work out. I can do it tomorrow evening
---
I like salting my yao gui mount with it
---
Agree loved making split stairs with the short stairs, and with the only place to snap stairs in is the middle really sucks, why cant they have all the same building mechanics as FO4?
---
I lag crash out of server right on boot up of the game so i let my self lag out exit game fully and boot up again and 90% of the time im good and dont lag out to hard but this is fucked up.spent a few days grinded ammo just to get a fuck you in the face rip day off.
---
Then we could put him on our roofs. Jingle on a shingle
---
That's a client crash, not a server crash.
---
Still sucks, and still an issue with the game (it's pretty widespread).
---
I prefer peppered myself.
---
only on legendary scorched? wheres all the places legendary scorched spawn. i know the civic center in watoga sometimee has one. maybe the ski resort lodges in the savage divide. any other ways.
---
There were some Nuka themed stairs in the recent datamine. They don't look v good. But too bad my Nuka saloon is one story lol
---
I love my santatron, and it loves me. However, the machine gun turrent I have placed watching my crops, does not. A band of super mutants attacked my camp. The turrent and I dispatched the band quickly but santatron either got in the way or tried to give a mutant some joy?? I dont know but whatever it was, it offended the turrent. It tried its hardest to murder my precious santatron,  luckily to no avail. I scrapped the turrent and placed a new one. If it happens again I'm just going to leave it. It's just jealousy I'm sure.
---
I used to play sniper, but I switched to PA hevy weapons build. This build is amazing
---
What do the map pieces look like i can find in senetor room
---
Powerfists actually do have higher DPS with ALL chem/food buffs, but for screwing around it actually is better
---
The green suitcase at WS Station is my go to
---
Not only is my armor not working... but the daily quests are not giving rewards?!?  Dailies keep me motivated....
---
this patch botch up takes all the fun out of the upcoming event tomorrow... I was really looking forward to this too.
---
Hopefully  they acknowledge and fix this... id even take a roll back and push the event back a week.
---
I usually get ambushed by one in the far north of the Savage Divide. North of Palace of the Winding Path but east of the munitions factory. A very eerie area with lost of unmarked locations.
---
wheres vault 79?
---
Does it do the same thing whith that mod?
---
Why the fuck do so many people think that rolling back the games build is just some magic switch they can just flip?
---
You can't just tell the game to undo all the shit the update did to it, reverting to an old build requires sending people everything from the old build that g ot replaced in a patch which while easy for PC would still require cert time for consoles.
---
Also even if they "quickly" reverted rather than taking the extra time fixing everything right now they'd STILL have to take the time to divorce the broken parts of the update from the things that can't be removed like all the new event assets otherwise Christmas is cancelled until they push out another patch later on.
---
Lol, I'm usually in pacifist because I don't want to pvp, bug I still think it's funny that people want to waste their ammo
---
Did Bethesda nerf the carrying capacity of the Excavator Power Armor? Pretty aggravating...
---
I know the difference lol. It just sucks ass
---
It‚Äôs north of the bailey family cabin, I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt care about spoilers since you looked at the post so I‚Äôll give you more info on it
---
Basically, you do a scavenger hunt to get 6 map fragments to get an elevator code. Previously anyone could get in with the code 000000, but the elevator didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Now, you get a personal code that works only for you and you can go down to the cave w/ vault 79, but other than a terminal there‚Äôs nothing of importance there. Also, you can‚Äôt actually get into the vault, just an underground cave with the vault door shut.
---
Just equip non legendary armor pit the mods u want on it then break the armor just dont unequip it
---
Yes at a power armor station. Same way you repair weapons or armor.
---
I've heard it breaks your armor too. And some guns simply break in a few shots. I read one report saying the harpoon gun broke in 15 shots from 200% durability
---
Yes at power armour stations mate you can repair and modify
---
I have been playing for the last 6 months and have yet to do a raid, mainly because i dont run with a team so hard to do solo. I will try it soon tho now that im level 190 with good gear and better skills. So im glad i ran across this post good info thanks
---
oi
---
No
---
Break it, will this remove the DR/ER/ etc resists then and keep the mods? Sorry I should probably know this already.
---
Wait, if underarmor has gloves they'll show up even when you wear an outfit?
---
You've listed the at least five exiting topics already covering this issue and yet decided we needed another because... reasons?
---
And you're whining about how Bethesda isn't doing anything or communicating with anyone when those threads you linked literally have responses from Bethesda in them?
---
YouTube is your best friend  for people new to game
---
Oh, that makes sense
---
It does more damage but the salty does give you the chance the cripple. But honestly though if you‚Äôre only using the Tenderizer as a wall piece they both look identical. It‚Äôs only when you actually use the weapon that you can actually see a cloud of salt or pepper when you swing it, which is a funny touch by the developers.
---
If you dont want it on pc then i dont want it for consoles sorry. If your not gonna support us then were not gonna support you.
---
Nope
---
I found a super mutant slider. Seen plenty of ghouls at the clubhouse doing that but never a super mutant.
---
How do you make a power armor station? I don‚Äôt see it under any options for building?
---
Yes they do. And before you ask any level two shot gamma gun does the same radiation. I‚Äôve got 4. Fantastic for Bloodied builds when you lose your rads. 4 shots and your back below 20%
---
Np!
---
Im not even sure anymore my game keeps glitching them on and off..
---
Bugs have been reported since Beta.
---
They do. Bloodied doesn‚Äôt affect Radiation. Two shot literally fires two shots. The radiation effect is doubled on them. Source? I have 4. Any level two shot does the same amount of radiation damage as well. They‚Äôre amazing for Bloodied builds because they can get you below 20% in 4 shots at max health
---
Sorry for the delayed response, Real Life got in the way, and thanks for the comment and I've got "A few" questions.    
---
**-Lagging/studdering player character movement.**  
---
New this patch?  Platform?    
---
**-Enemies warping around, in and out of combat.**    
---
As in changing locations? Might be related to the first.
---
**-Enemies randomly don't take damage.**  
---
Melee? This is sounding like a Lag / Sync issue (Not blaming you, but some players have reported similar things in the past, especially on console, linked to a lag on the platform / network connection.  
---
**-Enemies randomly damage me without doing their attack animation.**
---
Copy Pasta.  
---
This is sounding like a Lag / Sync issue (Not blaming you, but some players have reported similar things in the past, especially on console, linked to a lag on the platform / network connection.
---
**-Sound glitches, like my friend fires her gun and when she goes to  reload, the sound of it firing doesn't stop, so I just hear shooting  whenever I'm near her.**    
---
Not a new bug, but this is really sounding more and more like sync/connecting breakdown.   
---
**-Game studdering and lockups when I try to open the map or go to my Pip-Boy or use an item or open the favorite wheel.**   
---
Hmm... Platform again?  
---
**-Quests disappearing from my quest log, they don't show up unless I  reset the game. I also can't progress the quests until I reset the game.**   
---
Really REALLY sounding like a sync issue...   
---
**-I kill an enemy and the corpse just has no loot at all.**   
---
Did you check back 10 - 15 minutes later?   
---
With Sync/Lag issue you'll sometimes see it load much much later.     
---
**-My friend removing quests from her active list, but they don't  disappear from my screen. Or her adding quests to her active list and  they don't show up on my screen.** 
---
See Above     
---
\-**My little doggie bag not appearing after I die and respawn so I lose  all my scrap (yea losing scrap isn't just a problem for 1st members. And  this disappearing scrap bag bug has been a problem since launch by the  way).**   
---
Others with you at the time?    
---
No one sees the bag?  
---
**-Fast Travel just not working. It starts to count down and then stops and I can't fast travel.**  
---
Known Issue, documented and reported, but always post things like this, better to see the same issue 100 times then miss a critical one!  
---
**-Quest markers being in the wrong location or just not appearing at all.**   
---
Known Issue, documented and reported, but always post things like this, better to see the same issue 100 times then miss a critical one!    
---
**-I die and when I try to respawn, all the location markers have disappeared so I have to reset the game.**   
---
Known issue, documented on this page and previous, Vault 76 marker will still be there, unless you are in an event, then you have to wait until it ends.    
---
Hopefully it will be fixed soon.     
---
**-Dying during an event sometimes leaves you completely unable to respawn, forcing you to reset the game.**  
---
Known issue, documented on this page and previous.    
---
**-Being on a crafting table and when I quit out of the crafting, it puts  me right back in so I have to just keep trying to leave until it lets  me.**   
---
Again interested in Platform, many of your issues seem like a sync issue    
---
**-Getting disconnected from the server, this happens AT LEAST once per gameplay session.**  
---
Any Error messages?   
---
**-Turrets built at a CAMP or Workshop sometimes shoot at random nothings, or shoot at other parts of your CAMP.**  
---
Documented and reported on the Patch 15 round up, B.E.T.A. age issue that returned in force. :(   
---
**-When entering or exploring an area, enemies sometimes just die all on their own. You'll hear all their death animations play at once and you can't loot then and won't get XP because you didn't damage them.**  
---
B.E.T.A. Age issue, Actually FO4 legacy issue that has been documented and reported, we've (Datamining side) have not figured out a cause.
---
Yeah effects and mods still work but with the armor broken it has no DR/ER it actually does work same with legendary effects excluding vangaurd and bolestering just stand on an acid deposit till ur armor breaks
---
lol   
---
I respect positive positions, but it's important to be realistic!
---
I have four. It is
---
Thanks for the comment, and never be afraid to post an issue already covered, better to see the same thing 100 times vs missing a critical problem.  
---
1) Documented and reported, seems to be a common problem this patch :(  
---
2) Did you play NW before hand?  
---
3) Ick...  
---
4) Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Estados Unidos

Well......

---
Thanks for the follow up and details, please let me know if you do figure out how to replicate it, curious now!
---
It runs off AP. If you run out if AP it will switch off until it rechatges
---
Uh.  Oops?
---
Path of Enlightenment but you cant attack that one.
---
I would support crossplay.
---
Limited crossplay however..? Nope.
---
Todd Howard - It just works!!! Also I think this is a feature not a bug, Bethesda games are known for being feature packed.
---
I agree. I also use this philosophy
---
Politics, don't sweat it.
---
No, both are primary effects and thus can't be on the same weapon.
---
I'm on PlayStation 4.
---
Studdering player movement has been happening since launch.
---
Enemies warping around as in they appear in a new spot instantly instead of walking or running to the location.
---
I find it hard to believe that enemies randomly not taking damage or not performing their attack animation or sound glitches have anything to do with my connection, since I never experience these issues on any other games.
---
I have not tried checking an enemy 10-15 minutes later for loot. And quite frankly, I shouldn't have to anyway.
---
When my doggie bag disappears, no one can see it.
---
I do not get error messages when disconnected from the server, just the 'Disconnected from Server' message.
---
This is brilliant.... along with it comes crafting xp!
---
Scanning for good little boys and girls \*scanning\* \*scanning\* none can be found, Happy Holidays. Happy Holidays.
---
I am getting a lot of my own turrets attacking my own base
---
Salty has salt sprinkling out when on the wall. Not sure if peppered does this or not.
---
You won't get one for a while, but you can use anyone else's or any one out in the wild if you need to repair.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Whitespring has them inside.
---
It stopped.  Maybe event specific?  I'll keep an eye open.
---
Thanks so much for the advice, I'd no idea an acid node would do this, I'll go try, many thanks üëç
---
So long as people keep buying Atoms and 1st subscriptions, they'll continue to make a profit. And if they're making a profit, why would they bother fixing anything (serious question). You're already giving them your money.
---
Seems about the same.  Which is awful.
---
Just jump to a player's  base most player's have 1
---
Yes, bring the old patch make 250DR bugged again, its not worth it for loosing Legendary effects on weapon reload.
---
Anyways you guys are not able to handle your own coding...  ridiculous...
---
Do your employees suffer from dyslexia or mathematical discourse? You guys cant even spell reverse engineering. I mean, i need to ask that rude,  you guys need ages and weeks to bring out a fix in exchange for another bug, or bringing old  partially back...  Every Patch... Incredible, no wonder people are getting fed up with you and left the Game. That is very Sad.
---
I mean, just communicate with us, just tell us that you guys are not able to fix it man, whats the Problem? The game cant get even more worse then now.
---
We know it was a futile attempt to make money with Fallout 76,  nobody needs to make a secret of it,  but make the best out of it and do not try to retouch here and there, the game will be a building site for ever that way.
---
Sorry for the delayed response, life got in the way and thanks for the comments...      
---
**Food spoilage is randomly instant on fast traveling for me** 
---
Happened more than once?  Have you de-equipped "Good with Salt" or your backpack?    
---
Post patch it's sometimes required.  
---
**My camp objects break from full health much faster now.**   
---
Vs NPC's or?  
---
**Weapon duarbility is vadtly decreased for my nonenergy weapons.**  
---
Documented and reported, thanks for confirming all the reports!   
---
**My camp rocket turrets now kill each other in 1 rocket whereas before the patch, it took 3**  
---
Ouch and Ouch, Patch 15.0 issue is worse, wonder if there is an issue with DR processing properly   
---
**Green thumb still does not work all the time, for me its hit and miss even though it has not worked on some plants in particular spots since beta**   
---
Saw some reports of this with Patch 15.0, same as above, did you  de-equip and re-equip the perk card?    
---
**Goat legs, will also sometimes fail to prevent fall damage.**   
---
Interesting, new with Patch 16.0?
---
Sorry for the delay, RL got in the way and thanks for the comment, documented and reported!
---
Maybe a giant Yao Guai? I remember seeing one the other day and thinking it was way bigger than the others I‚Äôve always seen sadly it wasn‚Äôt though.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. You gave them money for a 1st subscription, even though the game is broken. Why would they fix anything if you're already giving them your money (serious question)?
---
Sorry for the delay, RL got in the way and thanks for the comment....  
---
Really? Scope on your weapon?
---
Sorry for the delayed response, RL got crazy again.  
---
No, but it's related to the 250 DR "fix"
---
Exactly what I've been saying.
---
I have it enabled always and have no interest in pvp.  That said I regularly and randomly just whack people with me melee.  It‚Äôs fun.  Just once or twice and move on.  If I‚Äôm at an event with an asshat one shitting everything do no one can tag anything I will unload multiple handmade clips of explosive rounds on said asshat just to annoy the shit out of him.

---
Thanks for the comment and sorry for the delay, rl got nuts.  
---
Question, some reports are suggesting the crouch / weapon swap only works for one salvo, seeing the same?
---
People don‚Äôt care about wasting their ammo, especially PvPers who typically have a lot of it. You shouldn‚Äôt get so upset that people whack you while you‚Äôre in pacifist mode(don‚Äôt see any other point in taking the time to post this besides complaining as it adds no meaningful discussion to the topic) PvP can at times be hard to come by so instead of getting upset and wondering why they‚Äôre attacking just realize that they will probably do this to anyone and everyone looking for somebody who isn‚Äôt completely scared/incapable of fighting back, and sometimes you find that person, and get really long, high quality fights and make a new friend/friends. Clearly you aren‚Äôt that person though lol. 
---
What‚Äôs the point of this post again? Lol
---
Tbh they need to bring back slap damage, this isn‚Äôt candyland, it‚Äôs the wasteland, doesn‚Äôt feel like a post apocalyptic game at all, but that‚Äôs an unpopular opinion here on this PvE based sub anyway üòÇ
---
Have you been good this year *scanning database* oh... my... no. Why did you do all those things
---
Just because the issues didn't bother or affect you, doesn't mean they don't exist at all.
---
Do you happen to know where the plans are located to build it?
---
If ya still need it Im on now
---
I want updates that don't further break the game in the first place. You know, like 99% of updates on 99% of games. Like, normal.
---
Same here.
---
I cancelled for a refund in full (I just bought a week ago). I'm not giving them another dime until it's fixed. All of it.
---
They are protecting another Vault Raid in which you have to repair pipes on a timer.
---
Kudos to you. Unfortunately, many people will continue to spend, which gives Bethesda no incentive to improve.
---
If that we‚Äôre true, then my +3 Intelligence unyielding armor when equipped would show as ‚Äú3‚Äùin my SPECIAL stats.  But it doesn‚Äôt. It shows my base level plus the additional. 11+3.
---
Yes.  Means I take a break.
---
You act like PS4 is so innocent lmao
---
You're right. I just hope more people follow suit. Because you're right, as long as the money is coming in nothing will change.
---
The foodbuilds are very sensitive creatures, and they cried and cried until daddy Todd decided to remove slap damage entirely.
---
r/cringe
---
Hunters long coat will come from the responder bot traveling vender.. sometimes he will spawn at Charleston station, but I have more luck down the road from janice soft serve towards the north west side of map.. also the outfits he has are random so you may have to find him a few times.. if you were on xbox I could help you out I have probably 10 or 12 of them
---
Responders traveling robot vendor it can spawn near Charleston station but no static spawn my rnjesus be with you
---
Look up the Random Encounters posts in this sub for details.
---
you can buy mine for 8K.
---
Take away God-gear weps and armor, and suddenly the game is "unplayable" . . . SMH
---
Looks like "food build" players aren't so limited after all
---
I like the brown one
---
You have so many different variations of your specials I honestly am having a hard time understanding in what scenario you‚Äôre talking about
---
So they only complained when they had an opportunity taken away from them?
---
Should be under the resources tab. Find it, then just place it where you want. 
---
Easy like Sunday morning.
---
Isn‚Äôt Vault 79 in the promo picture for wastelanders with a bunch of gold coins spilling out of the door?
---
I second Lady Janet‚Äôs. I found mine within a week by server hopping there. When you spawn in and run straight ahead, you should be facing the road with the main building to your right. Continue down the road past the tipped over shuttle bus and the vendor bot will spawn ahead of you. Good luck!
---
I will pay up to 500 caps per star depending on how desperate I am for scrip. I don‚Äôt have the weight allowance in my stash to really list some stuff I don‚Äôt think will sell.
---
I don't see a ton, but between hunting rifles, lever actions, combat rifles, and fixers, you should be able to get one if you keep at it.
---
If you're going sniper, instigating &gt; anything except maybe bloodied.  And don't waste money on an explosive one, not worth the caps.
---
Clipboards are everywhere though.
---
&gt; Easy like Sunday morning
---
How old are you? :P
---
(kidding, I got the reference instantly, though I *am* old :P )
---
You have to sell to vendor bots or pick them up in the wild not player to player
---
lmao, epic
---
oh y‚Äôall are hilarious üòÇ 
---
the world had been loaded for quite a while. i guess she saw me coming and was out of one ‚≠êÔ∏è assassin‚Äôs wood armor chests.
---
haha
---
You can try, but it won't be approved. And if you do a charge back they'll ban your account.
---
That song was released the year I was born, youngster.  ;)
---
One does not find the Mothman, he finds you.
---
Bethesda: More stairs you say? hmmm let's check section fuck at row you, right next to ifyouwantsomethingnewitwillbeintheatomshop.
---
Honestly
---
Thabks. Lionel. 
---
Hmm, I'm not seeing it.
---
Ugh I did try NW today. Figured I wouldnt rage at my armor not working. Is that what does it? It's happened to me before without playing NW but I guess I pressed my luck. 
---
Thanks again for all of this.
---
 I am a ~215 level player, only ever one character. I‚Äôve been playing since launch. 
---
I had a similar experience as you up until ~lvl 200. Then I started to get a very noticeable increase in very, very good legendary drops. 
---
It‚Äôs almost like RNGesus doesn‚Äôt bless you until you put in the time. 
---
The only logical thing I can think of is that I slowly built my full unyielding set up, and by the time I hit lvl200 I had really high Luck. But I don‚Äôt know how Luck lvl plays into legendary drops.
---
The other thing that I noticed is that once I had a few bloodied weapons, I started getting a lot more.
---
Yeah I was kind of making a joke. I dont k ow what's going on or why so I cant judge them to harshly. Some of the dev's probably really want to do better and know what needs to be done.
---
Ha!
---
Do you have a Colectron up and running by chance? I may be wrong but I think you can only have one or the other going?
---
I just did them today and got tokens. The wiest complete and rewards screen never sbowed though.
---
But it does tell you when you log into the game that there is another free thing in the shop
---
How much does the vendor charge for it? I see players charging 7k plus and assumed it's just because of rarity
---
It has been about a week and a half since I submitted the ticket. And what do you mean by restarting the console? If i'm playing on PC does that change anything?
---
As far as #4, I noticed it start over the past week, maybe less.  Given that the patch notes disabled the ability to put items back into enemy inventory, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs related to that.  Possibly an anti-duping fix.  Only the devs and the cheaters know.
---
When I played the game a few months back I would almost always play alone unless I met some random traveler along the way. I never duped but I remember when that whole charade was going around. Could it be possible that I got banned for maybe playing with a player who did dupe?
---
Its a damn shame too, game has so much potential, wouldn‚Äôt mind if somebody nuked this sub tbh. At least we still have nuke mines and nuka grenades üòÅ
---
Fair. 
---
I‚Äôll simplify. 
---
No armor:
---
S18 P14 E5 C4 I11 A5 L10
---
Power armor:
---
S19 P14 E3 C4 I -9 A5 L8
---
I will add that prior to this patch I ran PA often. I‚Äôve never had a negative SPECIAL stat until this latest patch.
---
There have been multiple reports of quests failing to give proper rewards. It's yet another feature the update broke.
---
Thanks guys, I‚Äôll try there. I‚Äôm almost level 200 and have never discovered that Lade Janet‚Äôs yet lol.
---
wait how much are those things worth
---
Great.
---
Pretty sure it's under 1k but I wouldn't swear to it.
---
Double.  For every day of the bug, add TWO DAYS!
---
Yeah...I remember when it was released.  Like, actually memories of it :P
---
People will find a way to cheat if they absolutely want to, heck, no matter how much you take things away fro someone, they will find a way, no matter what it is. You just gotta look at other games, especially shooter games, battlefield has plenty of cheaters on consoles. There's third party devices to negate recoil and aid aim, you can plug a keyboard and mouse on your console as well. Probably should inform yourself better before making a judgement.
---
as long as we get more i dont care if they are in the atomic shop. grinding dailies isn't that harddon't
---
First of all, why on Earth would you use the game's least effective weapon class? Gross. Secondly, it's legendary armor effects that are broken by reloading your gun, not weapon effects.
---
I assumed that those were the entries made on the day of the Great War, and that they ran into the conveniently located Vault rather than deleting record. As to *what* the treasure is, all we know is that it would be considered valuable in the pre-war economy, given the crazy (and ultimately deadly) Vegas weekend some of the AWOL guards had.
---
Absolutely it does.  Makes no sense, but probably some shortcoming in the code.
---
If you check your effects under stats you should find either one or two items negating intelligence. That will tell you why your intelligence has dropped. However, I can tell you with 100% accuracy, your stats are not negative. The easiest way to prove this is to give a serum (egg head for example) to a level 1. The strength stats should in theory then be (-) 2. They won‚Äôt. They‚Äôll still be 1. 1 is the lowest you can go. I thought the same thing for a long time in the early months. I don‚Äôt know what is causing the drop in your int but I can tell you it‚Äôs at 9, not -9
---
Uranium Fever has high lvl Mole Miners
---
Oh, I see. And shottys are bad now? Since when? I thought pistols were least effective?
---
Yeup, just completed Chow Line; nothin. Also didnt get any rewards/xp from Eco Balance
---
Floors only snap to other floors and must be snapped to a ladder on a foundation.
---
I saw you said you're ps4. If you'd like, I can swing by and help ya
---
Well shit
---
I suggest maximizing stealth with Unyielding armor at low health, The Fixer combat rifle, and all 3 Sneak perks. The sneak to lose enemies perk makes you turn invisible for 1 second when you crouch causing enemies to lose you in most cases. With all these perks and The Fixer, I can touch enemies without detection most of the time.
---
Forrest operative with some outfits gives you creepy dead monkey hands.
---
That was it! I had to change my collectron to get the event stuff. 
---
That's kind of lame. But whatever.
---
No, they're both primary effects. [Here's a list detailing how Legendary effects can go together.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/htmlview#)
---
I didnt know about those. were they limited stuff from the atom shop?
---
Apparantly, that is indeed the case. We start getting gifts tomorrow when the Christmas Scorched event starts.
---
Support is a two way street and exclusion only causes division.
---
thanks

I found three yesterday wandering around the Mire looking for a Sheepsquatch.

Growing up, my house was filled with 50/60s pop and Motown (Mom) and 60s/70s rock and old, OLD blues (Dad). 
---
When I got into hip-hop and electronica, I was well versed in the samples that were being used.
---
Check your token number before, then after you do them. I‚Äôll do that the next time I‚Äôm in game.
---
For whatever reason, the bp weapons cant have Quad. You dont want to spend an hour reloading that anyway
---
Around 10k caps
---
I honestly think that Bethesda built patch 16 off of an old version of the game, hence all of the "broken" fixes; the previous patches simply are no longer present in the code.
---
Actually I do go through just for the free stuff now, i got all I wanted with my atoms but if I really do want to spend my atoms I just wait for the specific item to go on sale.
---
No legendary so no point.
---
I agree, but it worked and that's what matters. Just keep it running until the end of the event and then switch back.
---
Glad it's working. :)
---
Well, this is certainly interesting... At first, I assumed you were just theorycrafting. I thought there was no way those effects were additive, rather than multiplicative.  A veteran dataminer even told me it shouldn't be possible, even though we could see in the code that they were additive.  I tested it myself (excluding the legendary effect) and it definitely adds up the way you said it does.  Looks like I'll be joining you in the market for a new weapon! Thanks for the info.
---
Yep just dont use PA or unequip ur armor
---
I switch between an sneaky sniper build and a heavy weapons power armor build, myself. They're both great fun.
---
Why is it worth so much jesus christ
---
the acid damage is working, the problem is the reload bug. it transferred over from the 250DR legendary to literally every armor, even PA.
---
as for the PA itself, you're sol. Bethesda won't do anything about it. I should know, I lost multiple items due to their horribly unstable servers.
---
they do have the tools but they're rudimentary. they essentially restore an older save of yours. but they have to do it manually.
---
yet another joke in this crap show that's Fo76.
---
It would be the only decent thing to do. So naturally, it won't even occur to Bethesda.
---
No.  First rule of Mothman Club.
---
It's amazing that Bethesda would remove quad from the pool for bp weapons but of course they still let you roll a useless perk like 25% fire rate.
---
And I want replies that have anything to do with what I just said, so I guess we're not both going to be disappointed.
---
The drop rate is very low, less than 1% of chance and in just a few events IIRC
---
I have one. And it's not that great. Takes forever to reload and doesn't have the one shot power one would expect!! I just display it.
---
I got one last year. Still loading it.
---
Why can't they just replace his vault steel? They gave a ton of it to people who haven't even stepped foot into the vault.
---
Well, fallout 2 let you do it, but maybe that was because it was those gold coins as currency
---
Well, all of the weapons had their durability massively reduced. Coincidentally, they introduced a "value" bundle of repair kits in the Atomic Shop at the exact same time...
---
No problem.
---
Ok. I‚Äôm just clueless I guess. I found the pawn shop, picked up three notes at the front door, and turned on a black light. I have zero idea what to do next. Everyone keeps talking about clues and packages, but I‚Äôve seen mention of neither in the game. What am I missing? Are the words on the wall supposed to mean something to me?
---
Go to the collectron and hit left on the d-pad
---
Does it? I didn‚Äôt know that lol. Maybe because the colour of salt (white) would be more noticeable than pepper.
---
Are we going to be compensated for all the repair kits some of have used due to said glitch? I was unaware of this issue, even thought I was suspicious. So I and several of other people have used a lot.
---
That would be very helpful to confirm that's the case. I didn't even think to check first.
---
I think each weight room gets you around 80 lead
---
Graham does. üòú

Yeah, not sure why a broadsider or crossbow would get Quad but not the bp weapons. But then my 90% reduced weight handmade is heavier than a broadsider so I'm not sure much thought was put into a lot of areas.
---
I believe with 3 star hard bargain I get them for maybe 750
---
No worries! Yes, I noticed it while I was running a series of tests on various armor pieces (on Xbox) to discover if there was any way to make the ‚Äúcrouch reload‚Äù act consistently (spoiler alert: I couldn‚Äôt.) I would Crouch, Fire, Reload, check my stats, and then take an action other than firing, check stats again, etc. My results were a little maddening, but I realize that my armor effects didn‚Äôt break during any series of actions that weren‚Äôt preceded by a crouch-reload.
---
So, like another fellow pointed out, crouching just appears to push off the breakage for a moment, but breakage can potentially happen after any other action, whether it be firing a weapon, weapon-swapping, aiming a gun, throwing a grenade, etc. 
---
But that‚Äôs just been my observation, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs affecting any other players in this way.

Agree
---
Just went to Grafton and of course Grafton Day works!
---
If you are on PS4 I have some for sale, maybe 50 caps.
---
The brotherhood of steel vendor inside whitespring should have it
---
What level should I be to join that guild and start doing their quests?
---
I cant even find out how to get screws you think I can cheat (yeah, I know there are alot of other people who cheat)
---
Dang that means you can make some serious profits from it (until everyone has em). Thank you
---
I checked. Marsupial is all that‚Äôs affecting Intelligence and only by -1. 
---
Simple fact is before the patch wearing PA didn‚Äôt show -9.  It showed a positive number. After the patch wearing PA shows -9. Nothing else changed.
---
well thanks? im apparently sitting on like 30k caps then? that seems so high
---
Are giving rewards but the list is not appearing at the end of the quests. Tested
---
Do any of your armor pieces grant plus 1 to intelligence by chance?
---
You are wrong.  It may affect you, and others, but NOT everyone.  I played last night after the patch with none of the issues you guys are talking about (Rifleman with 4 Vanguard 1 Chameleon).  The ONLY bug I noticed was that my thirst &amp; hunger drained much faster than normal.  Those affected have my sympathy, but please understand that it's not a universal bug for everyone and might be hard to pinpoint &amp; patch.
---
I didnt say that
---
I did it last week, easy to test, take a drink mash a button and watch rads, or check how much water you got before and after
---
Thank you so much Sage, I'd never have made it without your tips.
---
It's this damn crazy market, lol. The Urban Scout Mask usually sells for 10k and the Forest one goes for even more, around 15k
---
I am one of the members for this vault raid team and can vouch that someone in our group went to apply NW paint to his Strangler Heart power armor and the Strangler Heart armor is no longer on the chassis. We spent weeks grinding to get vault 94 steel. This is an unacceptable bug that occurred within the game along with the other plethora of issues also taking place at the moment.
---
The only Legendary armor not affected is weightless. I have a stealth junkies commando build and my weightless armor is not affected however my bloodied build with the Unyielding armor is completely broken at the moment. Thankfully with my gatling gun I don't have to reload very often.
---
Use it to craft weapons, armor, more scrap
---
And plenty of Yao Guai spawns throughout the map.  That‚Äôs how I farm springs and acid
---
Got this yesterday after completing two events at the same time, it was just a visual bug, fixed after restarting the game
---
Bring on the nukes!
---
I don't know man just walk in and pay the robot a few thousand caps
---
Happened to me but I received tokens.
---
Was that a stupid question..? Lol.
---
In before "s*ck my d*ck" holotapes.
---
Dont expect more than insults and swearing on tapes
---
I really hope the wastlanders isn‚Äôt this broken. If that doesn‚Äôt work this whole game is dead.
---
Nobody:
---
Me:
---
My Unyelding armor:
---
The crafting system is so broken
---
Nah I don't know too much about this game, I mostly just shoot things
---
Go heavy PA or stealth commando.  I started as a rifleman but once I saw some bloodied commando builds, I went with it and never looked back.
---
What weapon did you use?  Did 12 Queens today and saw no issues.
---
Before selecting private world there is now an option for all friends or teammates only. On PC it's changed with R, no idea on Xbox. My friend &amp; I were unable to play together until we both had it set to all friends.
---
I think scout leader Pompy is the worst for being condescending.   
---
"Are you still a tadpole???"   
---
NO ASSHOLE!!! I'M A POSSUM NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR MANY MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
---
Side note: cannot wait for squirrel to be added.
---
I haven't had a chance to fire up the game since the patch, but from the looks of this list it's almost like it will cause my laptop to burst into flames.
---
I guess Bethesda never learned the "Aw shit" / "Attaboy" rule.
---
Seems like certain bugs may or may show up depending on the console. May help if people sharing also state whether their on xbox, ps, or pc
---
May i ask which platform your on?
---
For truth. I'm xbox. Tested private and public and I got nothing. Havent run into anyone who has. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen to other peeps. Evidence is there, but yeah, some people need to do a little more explaining and do proper ticket submissions.
---
&gt; Serendipity doesn't work in Power Armor. 
---
Oh thats a big tip. Wondered why you missed it, thanks!
---
Interesting. I did not try it at a robovendor or vending machine. I‚Äôll try that later.
---
I think if things keep going the way they are even elder scrolls 6 will be dead shortly after it's released
---
Here's the link to the Imgur images
---

---
They're not going to help you. Bethesda literally could not care less about any of the bugs they've introduced.
---
"We want be sure we can fix the issue without indesiderable consequences":
---
If (player=reload every kind of weapon) 
---
{
---
Return=broke all the game;
---
}
---
It should work
---
You mean "we are looking into the issue and we'll get back to you as soon as possible"?
---
I‚Äôve got 5, but I forgot that the slugger/t51 is actually enjoyable.  I‚Äôve had him specced into heavy guns for months, swapped a few banked level ups and he‚Äôs killing things just fine.
---
Could have presets to keep it safe but it's a rated M game right?
---
I like it, very cool kanye
---
Pictures or no Deal.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks! Go ahead &amp; I'll add you back when I'm on again üëç
---
ralph pls go
---
This sucks. They need to make this right. They replaced all the "scrap" that was lost in the scrapbox. They can easily fix this by replacing this vault steel. Fix it, Bethesda.
---
Save Everything Mod for PC does this exactly
---
What sucks is this being an issue will probably ensure people don‚Äôt buy the game once the free weekend is over. Every time there‚Äôs ever potential, they do SOMETHING to screw it up.
---
Not really videos, but there are some Fallout podcasts I listen to while playing the Fallout games that are pretty relaxing to listen to while just running around the wasteland. Robot Radio‚Äôs Fallout Lorecast and the Cryptid Cast (formerly VaultBoysWV) have some pretty fun and and interesting stuff if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing.
---
Lol yeah thats what i was talking about
---
Took me 2 days!
---
You shouldn't have LocTited half of them and galled the rest.
---
Explosive vents transfer over directly to your computer or console's fans
---
The community isn't really that toxic. Sure, there are some toxic ppl but most likely they wouldn't participate in that because they're busy scamming ppl by killing them and taking their junk
---
I've been waiting so long for a god damn wooden ornate staircase like in a fancy cabin and indoor outdoor railings, so we can actually create things that don't just look like a clunky mess.
---
And how about some bloody tall bookcases, with different variants of filled books or nic nacs
---
cost would be the same as regular power lines. it would be an option.
---
Ha, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always got beer bottles. Didn‚Äôt know that. Take the upvote.
---
The voice lines are pretty top shelf.  He must be related to Insult Bot.  I thought I‚Äôd hate him, never  really liked ‚Äúcompanions‚Äù in Fallout, but I do enjoy his company while producing ammo.
---
If that was supposed to insult me, that's pretty laughable, I just don't feel like pvp because I haven't finished my build yet, nor do I have tons of ammo, I sometimes will try to kill a wanted player, I'm just more into the adventure aspect of the game
---
Given all the funny Christmas related lines he gives, I‚Äôm almost content with not having Christmas songs on the radio.
---
So excited about the sink! Now I can quit making bathtub gin and move my punch bowl out front where it belongs.
---
Is that the sink or the water fountain?
---
I don't have liberty prime armor but I was awarded with it's immortal words on my last logon. üêú
---
I don't disagree, slap damage was a good feature, but I agree it should feel like a wasteland, but at the same time, people also shouldn't be forced to pvp because someone else wants 2
---
Flatwoods is such a better map
---
Okay, I made a joke reply to someone yesterday that delete and reinstalling would fix something, and to try reformatting their hard drive if all else fails.
---
I didn't expect *Bethesda* to do the same thing 0\_o
---
Pretty sure its noon est tomorrow
---
What do you expect? It's about the only part of the game that's not hopelessly broken at the moment.
---
Vault tec stairs were basically un-usable because they didn't bother to scale it to 1 square, the iron stairs are ok, but again another metal, industrial looking object within an out of place home
---
And the Nuka stairs looks horrible. Like another ugly metal set with advertising just painted on. It's extremely niche, where as they havent thought about making some plain wooden stairs. Maybe a slightly deteariated white set for a normal house, a more ornate carved wooden 1 for those cabins or mansions
---
I played along just in case it worked. They just sent a generic answear
---
Documented and reported!
---
Will do, hope I don't unequip by mistake, my excavator will be a bind as I mine lead with it and then some queen fights.
---
Standing on an acid node seems very slow, I removed all my perk cards, I think I may need to suppress my mutations, the left arm I swear hasn't degraded in about an hour of acid damage? I'll keep trying.
---
ugh, fix once thing, break 3 more!
---
Yes, it's an unresolved bug from the introduction to NW, if you play NW before going into Adventure mode the Challenges break, huge PIA!
---
It's a light, there is no way it would be the same
---
lol.....  
---
You should video yourself downloading and logging into a world "just in case".... ;)
---
Yeah, im also interested in how shotguns are the least effective.
---
Blooded Commando build with full unyelding ap refresh set: this bug is affecting me. It happen if I reload my be handmade, my be fixer and every kind of weapon I have and I tested. Also prime receiver is not working and just my fixer seem nerfed in damage (200 dmage points less) and range (I can see because the damage is very reduced at really short distance). About conditions, my handmade and my laser rifle seem the most affected by the bug, not so much the fixer. The armor set is totally down. I can also see 20 fps less then my standard.
---
Ebin :D
---
Even bashing it into a rock would knock at least 2-3 screws loose.
---
It's probably the power cable that's breaking the electricity and corrupting the game, try a new cable.
---
just checked mine today closely again today.
---
Some how not all unyieilding effect were off after I reload,
---
It was down to like from 38 to 31 AGI.
---
But still, I can kill stuff with the B2525 handmade.
---
Hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Yeah, they clearly weren't listening to you. I suspect you could have reported that 76 turned your PS4 into a rabid monkey and they'd have sent the same canned response.
---
They must be feeling pretty sick at the moment. üòí
---
Let's team up, I'll follow you ahahah
---
If you were thinking of buying atoms, then it's cheaper to get it by just buying 1 month of fallout 1st. You'll atoms and the outfits, dances, etc.
---
What's a bricolagist and a brico thing?
---
Most likely. A rabid monkey would be more helpful
---
I can't believe they haven't announced a hotfix.  This last patch has made the game practically unplayable for many people.
---
We should also test the game for free? I can read a long list of testers on bethesda team. Check on fandom wiki...
---
Wow!
---
Did you test this. Because normally on public servers, if nobody remains within the region, all world containers seem to reset.
---
I've lost stuff on a couple of occasions due to this
---
Screws can be found in fans. I'd also recommend that you build you camp on a junk deposit so that you can place a junk extractor down. It's a source of unlimited rare materials, such as plastic and screws.
---
I literally lose 25% of my DR/ER when I reload now. Well, it was a fun day chatting with people and doing the daily challenges, I guess. 
---
How do you go from fixing +250 DRwR to messing up armor bonuses? Their code must be spaghetti.
---
I really feel at this point they really don't care unless it is something that makes money. Although I love the game and there is a time line for future content, I would not be surprised if Bethesda cut their losses and shut down the servers and just move on to other things.
---
It's pretty sad that people complain so much about it that it drives people away.
---
Imagine trying the free trial and seeing the broken mess that is this game right now!
---
Man, I play everyday but the past two days I maybe played for a about 2 hours total, if that, because of the bugs with the armor mainly. Kinda hard to want to sit down and remove and reapply all my armor everytime I reload. Man this is stupid shit!
---
Good luck man, sorry for your loss, I actually mean that.
---
I have the same problem with prime receiver and without... Bloody Commando build with be automatic weapons
---
So will you unban the account you let get stolen? Or is your team too incompetent to check ip addresses for logins to see it was obviously not me who was using the account?
---
So over the past year I've seen multiple reports of the following helping with the exact issues you're mentioning, it's why I asked about platform, then got more confident.    
---
# In this order:
---
**-Resetting your router and opening up some of the ports.**  
---
I know this sounds like BS, but I've spoken with players who told me it solved some of your listed issues.     
---
**-If on WiFi verify your strength, check your ping, and adjust channels to improve it.**  
---
Again this may not be an issue for most online games, but '76 seems touchy and just tweaking the wifi settings has helped with warping/stuttering.  
---
**-Force close the game and Clear Cache / local data**  
---
Heck this helps with some PC issues, especially with browsers, but again have seen this fix things.
---
**-Verifying your game files (not sure the exact wording on PS) twice.**  
---
Especially after Patch day I've seen reports of a partially flawed download causing issues, or so it seems.   
---
**-Delete your local save files and let them re-download.**  
---
Seen this reported a couple times, don't know if it's linked to the cache issues
---
  
---
 
---
**I have not tried checking an enemy 10-15 minutes later for loot. And quite frankly, I shouldn't have to anyway.** 
---
Don't Disagree with the loot, I mean it should be there, but it helps for troubleshooting / isolating problems.  
---
**When my doggie bag disappears, no one can see it.**    
---
Odd, will see if I can find similar reports.
---
**I do not get error messages when disconnected from the server, just the 'Disconnected from Server' message.**  
---
Again, the above steps I listed might sound like nonsense, and there is a chance it won't make a difference for you, but I've seen the same errors reported multiple times, mainly on consoles, and it's been linked to a latency/sync issue or problems with the local files.
---
Please no more flying baddies, it‚Äôs rough enough watching half the lobby stare at the Queen with melee weapons out!
---
Fissure sites, AVR Medical, Distant Thunder event in Cranberry Bog, Watoga Municipal Center, Watoga EMS, the Family Cabin near the Munitions Factory...
---
Yes, only on Legendary Scorched.
---
Can they do that though? What happens to everyone that purchased the game? What about Fallout 1st? I was stupid enough to purchase a year. Don't get me wrong, I love Fallout 76, but this has got to stop. I don't usually complain, but this is unacceptable.
---
Clearly you don't have 4 alts full of crap lol. Get busy slacker!
---
2k acid....cries in making .308 ammo
---
Yep and I'm an avid player of this game. At least a few hours a night/day. But the past two days I've only logged in for scrip, caps and dailies. I cant stomach the reloading bug that affects basically everything.
---
Thanks. I guess I'll just continue to help my friend with the raids. It's all I can do, I guess.
---
I don't. They're far, *far* too hard for me to attempt. The Ghoul swarms, or the Murloc Kings, end things pretty much instantly. I've never gotten even halfway through one.
---
.
---
As such, I'm done with 'em and I really wish there was a way I could replace them on my questlog for stuff I *can* do. Even 10 Atoms would be better than the gooseeggs.
---
Sad, but here we are.
---
So does my 1\* Stalkers pipe pistol...........err hang on - no it doesn't.
---
Bethesda, please don't. Just to annoy OP.
---
Damn im surprised you haven't been attacked by any Bethesda slaves yet.  Totally agree.  Lost scrap again after logging in after a week.  Sucks when it happens to tou but to other people your the bad guy for getting upset.  Ain't that some shit?
---
does it come with hand washing animation?
---
Yeh, I heared PA with noisyboy skin at SBQ, spamming and overlapping so much noise
---
What opportunity? They weren't going to be earning 14,000 XP in 6 hours you fucktard.
---
Private test servers? /s :)
---
Is that the guy who thought spit and salt would fix his controller?
---
NW has always been competitive. Melee builds are more than practical. There are some seriously deadly melee players. Just about every build is feasible. I've seen Rifleman, Commando, Shotgunner, Pistol, Demo, and Melee builds all expertly implemented to deadly effect.
---
They should atleast do it fast, 250dr is nothing compared to this mess
---
I'm just taking a break until they fix it. Glad I didn't re-up my fallout first subscription since I don't know when they plan to fix it.
---
I saw a few posts of people who were a few hundred xp off, and I've not seen anyone suggesting that they were doing the whole grind in one night. May I ask why you choose to use the word "fucktard"?
---
Sorry to hear you are having a rough time.
---
Fusion cores can be gotten from the power plants - once one is up and running there is a "extractor" you can use to have them made. 
---
What areas are you exploring. At level 15 you should still be sticking to the Forest and the area around Grafton.
---
Probably too busy thinking about ways to piss everyone off next month.
---
What questlines are you doing?  scavegning is key for me, as far as aid items.  never been big on crafting.  are you on pc?
---
Just kill stuff for food and make soot flower tea. Dont waste stimpacks that early in if you dont have to. Events usually gice me stimpacks
---
I run bloodied with my health bar half way, stealth commando, and unyielding.....but I can't anymore cuz of patch 16. Run blocker it's a must.
---
Hey Bethesda, saw this post on my Reddit feed and just wanted to say Fuck You and thanks for the continuous shitting you do to this game - starting with the lack of text chat and implementation of cartoony emotes.
---
Do events in the Forrest. Events usually give a hand full of them.
---
If you need healing you can make soup or drink purafier water. Both can be made at a camp easily.
---
If you have the pharma pharma perk, Morgantown airport is a food place to farm stimpacks. It's also a good place to make caps early on.
---
This would be pretty cool.
---
Also I think there should be some scorched with Santa hats.
---
It's not easy when you start out.  I'm level 200ish and recently started 2 alts and it's a bit if a struggle ( and I'm sending stuff over to them from my main ).
---
It will get easier as you progress - just need to keep at it. Get some cores from PA spawns or the power plant near Charlestown station. Most supplies come from enemies or overseer stashes when you're really low level.
---
I agree, I'm close to done with their fuckery. If wastelanders doesn't fix this game im out.  You won't get your armor back,  sorry. Bethesda could give a fuck.
---
If you cant afford the plans yet, there is a Power Armor station at the Gorge Junkyard and another in a rundown building down the hill from Mama Dolces in Morgantown. That second one has traps so be careful in there!
---
Yeah I think I kinda figured out what I should do right after I posted this. I forgot about healing Salves. And after reading some comments, they‚Äôre right I should stop worrying about the quests and just do more scavenging.
---
You can't have chameleon and unyielding on the same piece of armor.
---
Mods? Cheats? I thought you were on Xbox? What are you referring to? There are less than 10 exploiters in NW to my knowledge. If I see them using an exploit against me, I remind them once that I record every game.
---
Know any good spots for soot flowers?
---
All good - you might want to visit the [Filthy Casuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) as well - we are more relaxed bunch of players, who often help each other out to enjoy the game
---
It‚Äôs my forest scout chameleon that‚Äôs not working I‚Äôm wearing all forest scout I‚Äôm not mixing it
---
Are you on ps4? Because that might have been me lol. I was fighting the queen with a bunch of people and every time I reloaded it would play like 4 lines at once.
---
Take over the workshops in the lower areas. The game was really built on the fact that people would constantly be taking and holding workshops. Except the devs didn‚Äôt realize no one likes pvp in a online coop game. So in order to get aid items and plans as well as experience to level up you need to be taking workshops and defending them and building defenses with the provided resources. If some one comes to pvp take the 50 cap loss and go elsewhere.  Do not seek revenge just ignore them. You will find the games gets really easy. You take a workshop defend it get some aid items. Then go questing. Get an alert to defend and rinse repeat. That was the game play loop that the devs envisioned. Until you get to 50 you kinda have to play that way or struggle without any resources or aid.  Originally the workshops were really good and it made it so all the high level players taking all of them and the low level players couldn‚Äôt get them and couldn‚Äôt level up or get the resources they needed. So they nerfed them and now low level players can use them for their original purpose and high level players just use them to bully new players.
---
 pharma pharma is an amazing perk
---
The elevator pitch was one small team of juniors can make this work. It's based on existing assets, we only need to add making it work with 5 people on the same map, what can go wrong. And they are being held to the elevator pitch.
---
Should I store it all in my stash?
---
What platform? If your on pc I‚Äôll give you 50 stimpak diffusers
---
They tried their best, now lets try the rest.
---
Check the right side of the road from the overseers camp to flatwoods
---
This subreddit is fine too.  FC is not more relaxed if at all anything its more uptight.
---
Well those people should have just done the one or two more matches it would have taken instead of leaving it to the last minute. I choose to use it because I can, fucktard.
---
Purely use it for the Spicy mod. Leaves a nice puff of spicy cheeto dust in the face of any baddie that defies me.
---
Definitely store your junk in your stash bc it stacks up and weighs a ton. And dont keep weapons u dont plan on using you might as well just scrap it. If u play on ps4 i could help u Im lvl 72 or 73 cant remember
---
Did u win?
---
F\*&amp;k off idiot.
---
I like that it's less laggy than Morgantown, but the loot is far too sparse. It's a bad combo with the smaller maps.
---
If it makes the game unplayable for you, you need to git gud.
---
Difference is that Atom store team have their shit together. Wish the same could be said for the rest of the dev team.
---
No amount of skill is going to stop my armor from losing its effects everytime I reload. There are many less frustrating ways to enjoy my time while waiting for them to fix it.
---
its a fo1st perk
---
But then you wouldn‚Äôt look at the rest of the stuff and become less likely to buy anything..
---
A filter to hide owned items would rock
---
Why, of course he fell for ye ole Shakespeare trap... 
---
Get melted a lot, talk about it, improve. Friendly PvP does exist.
---
ok
---
It sounds like your playstyle is clashing with this game. How exactly are you playing the game? I'm actually baffled that you're so out of stimpacks already.
---
Are you spending any time looking around for loot or just treating this like a shooter? Though you shouldn't need to, are you spending any caps on stimpacks from robot or player vendors?
---
I got them for preordering the Tricentennial Ed., I think it was anyone who pre-ordered.
---
They can't unless your health is low. One shot will only do 110 damage to you. By default, you have 250hp or more.
---
I have a friend who is convinced there isn't a lot of "randomness" to the "R" of RNG in FO76.  Says if someone were to track the drops, it would be pretty clear to see "patterns" and prove the lack of randomness.  He's a forensic statistician for an economics firm.
---
I don't know anything about any of that.  All I know is, one week I got 4 Executioners, Swing Speed Chinese Officer's swords, another week I got 3 Troubleshooters Broadsiders within 30 minutes of game time (5 drops, 2 from Purveyor and a third 20 minutes later at Whitespring), this week I've gotten 3 lv 25 Instigating, bashing damage 10mm pistols.  That is some pretty sketch probability randomness.
---
But whatever.  The game is addictive and i've gotta get my farming for legendaries fix. l.o.l.
---
They're using armor and weapons with multiple legendary effects that heterodyne together, and more or less guarantee that whoever shoots first shoots last. Ironically, these same effects are currently bugged to high heaven; these kinds of players are probably weaker right now than they have been since launch.
---
Seriously? That‚Äôs evil.
---
The business model for this game has become borderline predatory.  Give it away for next to nothing and cater to the people who compulsively buy atom shop gear/will pay-to-win (FO1st).  At this point I don‚Äôt think they can fix the game the way it needs because they‚Äôll infuriate the people who sink hundreds into a game that costs like $11.
---
I got the most plans and xp and crafting items through workshops. It has to be in your level otherwise it is an impossible task keeping workshops in the Mire at low levels. Also, try building small in Camps and blueprint buildings in 2x2 or 2x3 so that you can quickly defend workshops and build onto it.
---
ITT: people who don‚Äôt understand why marketers give away free items in the first place; it‚Äôs to get you in the door to look at all the pricey stuff because maybe you spot something you like.
---
It seems either very creepy or a bit narrow to say that you know that they were leaving things until the last minute without any evidence of this claim. There are quite a lot of us playing this game in a few different countries, and I'm not sure that your generalization can cover everyone's situation. And yes, I see that you certainly can use words that lable you
---
fo1st is evil bwahahaha
---
Why do you have Barbarian? That lowers your damage, too. Is it a balancing thing?
---
Or do, just to annoy this\^ guy.
---
No, I'm on pc. I think the most of this kind of PA skin have this bug rn, no matter the platform. I was laughing so much: from noisy boy to VERY noisy boyüòÇ
---
Was Shakespeare really included? Lol. Could of went 10 paces turn a fire
---
Any half decent company would have rolled back the update before the day was out.
---
There's a mini quest hidden in the game that gives you some background.
---
I really don't care as to whether or not they admit fault, so long as the problem is fixed permanently.
---
Sadly, Bethesda has a tendency to do the quickest, hackiest fix without seemingly giving enough time to properly test it. I wish I thought otherwise, but I honestly don't ever see this pattern change without at least a change in management.
---
Haha I‚Äôm starting to get that
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give for this CAMP design.

I got the bug on video, I tryed to get a video where I could see the gloo by the top and bottom, but my pc couldn't continue to record video for too long xD this is the best one I've got.

I claimed a workshop but couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get the power going...
---
I was wondering about that. They must have found some great combos. I guess I‚Äôll have to search the web and see how people like me are able to compete.
---
What really annoys me is that one of the bethesda people on reddit was acting like they were helping. By asking for my ticket number
---
Welcome to RNG. Sucks that you didn't get what you wanted but I'm sure that someone is out there pissed that they're getting mostly rifles.
---
A test server would help prevent more from coming in
---
If you are in pacifist mode, that means YOU are harmless. It doesn't make you invincible. You can still be killed in a variety of clever ways.
---
You using a wireless headset?
---
West Virginia.
---
Hit me up, if you‚Äôre willing. I‚Äôm in dire need.
---
You‚Äôre saying that with all perks and whatever else these guys are doing, the most damage the can possibly deal with one shot is 110 damage?
---
It‚Äôs not just unyielding. Bolstering, vanguard, Chameleon... all of them stop working when you reload.It comes back if you remove and reinstall your armor but disappears as soon as you reload again.
---
That's like asking costco to put their free samples at the door and not placed throughout the store to expose you to the goods
---
Against other players, yes. They might cause 9000 damage to everything else, but they can only cause 110 damage per shot to another player.
---
I have only dobe it with a water pump, and a pre existing sink in the world
---
You will need to build a generator. The plans for generators get unlocked by completing the restore power quest to any of the power plants

It does this late at night. There are usually at least 5-6 full lobbies going on for console on a normal weeknight.
---
So far Pharma Pharma hasn‚Äôt done a single thing for me and it‚Äôs at rank 2...
---
There is no way to manipulate memory on console and on pc you can simply download cheat engine
---
Are you using the search function on the containers? It's the Y button if on xbone.
---
What‚Äôs the bug?
---
That‚Äôs good info thank you. I wish I stayed alive long enough to see what the most recent person killed me with. It seemed so fast I assumed it was one shot kill. I‚Äôll have to keep researching.
---
If you can't play without armor effects, you need to git gud.
---
Is it any container? I‚Äôm on ps4
---
I'm curious, what strategizing do you do on a big map that you can't do on a smaller map? Does the strategizing on the bigger map result in frequent 1st place finishes?
---
If you're on PC I might have some friendly PvP for ya.
---
Most likely just players with stacked weapons and armor. Some legendary effects when combined like Unyielding when combined with Sentinels can make some appear almost unkillable unless you know how to counter it, same thing applies to weapons. I‚Äôm not a fan of legendary effects in PvP situations since some people are just way more gears up then others, especially in situations like a workshop where lower level players get the snot kicked out of them like you mentioned...welcome to 76!
---
You on PC? I‚Äôve got a spare.
---
Preset notes like soulsborne, sure, and i can see what youre thinking with the holos but it would ultimately dwindle down to the vocal version of dick pics being spammed around Appalachia.
---
The best way to bypass the per-hit restriction is to use an automatic weapon that can deliver 110 damage several times over in rapid succession.
---
i just hate this idea that seems to be growing more popular these days that Bethesda is just some totally shitty developer and always has been apparently. Thats not how it works. They certainly have their, well, "unique" quirks, but they didn't get to where they are by being just all around bad at what they do. As for the bugs, well -personally I think bethesda for a long time has had a manpower problem. For years they operated with an extremely small team compared to most other AAA developers which I think is likely what contributed to the performance issues and odd quirks their games have always had. They are bigger now so we will just have to wait and see what their next actual core title holds in this regard
---
I have a sneak rifleman, commando, and pistol build on one character. I started with the sniper and was often frustrated with its shortcoming (especially with high level mobs). Now, after using the commando and having a blast with it, I‚Äôm back to my sniper build for everything except for running silos, fighting the SBQ, and vault raids, where I use the commando build. I feel like it takes some time and learning to get the benefits out of the rifleman build. Having the right weapons, armor, and really understanding the perk card layout makes all the difference. 
---
Also, maybe don‚Äôt hold yourself to just one build. Different situations call for different tactics and equipment. 
---
Learning mutations, armor perks being balanced with perk cards, and having a few badass weapons takes time. 
---
When I‚Äôm on the west side of the map I use a semi .38 Fixer. I put all three lock picking perks on. But once I cross over the savage divide, out comes the 3* lever action and my 3* Fixer (both in .45). No lock picking perks (unless I know I‚Äôm safe). 
---
When it‚Äôs time for a raid or a queen, my 3* Furious handmade in full auto comes out. Each time I have to change out my perk cards. Which isn‚Äôt the worst...Bethesda, perk loadouts please!
---
None of this happened quickly. It all takes time. But the time it takes is just as rewarding as where I‚Äôm at now in the game. 
---
If I were to suggest a starting place for a new player, a rifleman build is a great choice. Cheap on ammo, usually at a distance from mobs, and gives you time to learn. Learning to balance the perk cards is huge.
---
I could play but I choose not to do so while this shit is broken. I could drive my truck with a broken clutch too if I chose, or get it fixed. I prefer to avoid stupid frustrations if given a choice. Not playing for a few days or weeks isn't going to effect me negatively.  Playing with the current bugs isn't enjoyable on the character I've been playing lately since he has a full set of unyielding.
---
The most common build of this nature requires the player to be at extremely low health. They usually stay there by irradiating themselves within an inch of death. As a result radiation weaponry, like the Gama Gun, is a good bet. Failing that a Radium Rifle's almost as good.
---
It‚Äôs 3 shelves below the first aid kit behind his desk.

im on xbox now. playing division 2 but if you're on pm me heathen yak on xbox. I'm just farting around and can hop on fallout any time.
---
Amen. üôèüèª
---
Do both of you share an Xbox Gold subscription?
---
Well, yeah no shit. They're the community manager. They're not the support team. You expect them to magically know your exact ticket number out of dozens, if not *thousands,* of tickets?
---
No it is PS4‚Äôs with separate profiles and PS+ subs
---
Is that before or after buffs/perks/legendary effects?  110 would imply that literally any weapon can do the same damage to another player in a single shot/swing.  110 damage without a weapon at all wouldn't be too hard to achieve.
---
I want a huge grafton monster that leaves flammable oil puddles from its ranged attack that you have to ignite and drag it into to kill it.
---
Same street as train station.  There is a brightly lit deli/cafe next door.  The front door is kinda easy to miss as its nearly the same color as the generic boarded up doors on most of the buildings.
---
That‚Äôs so wild, and it makes sense. I think the idea of claiming workshops and fighting for them is really fun. Just wish it was on more level grounds, especially given the time you have to put into this game.
---
This guy is giving you inaccurate information. No matter how many combined damage boosts a player has, there is still a hard cap of 110 damage per hit. You are vulnerable when you are standing in a workshop, which is a PvP arena that you should never linger in if you don't want PvP.

Xbox. Thanks for the offer though.

Just chem/first aid containers
---
Any pictures of what each looks like?
---
i mean its not like those game will just be asset flips and what not. They are next generation and Beth is doing a lot of major upgrades to the engine so I think the tech leap will be larger than many are expecting. Plus they are singleplayer so they should negate a lot of performance issues that 76 has.
---
No, there's nothing about Fallout 1st that does this.
---

The full 76 story in one shot. I actually enjoyed it, mainly modus

tomorrow? didn't the website say it starts on the 12th?

So you need to git gud.

Melee build?
---
Its 12th for me my bad
---
Tomorrow is the 12th
---
Thanks dude I forget there based out of us sometimes it's 6am here
---
Yes I got a quad last month and it barely dented a mirelurk queen even though it said it did over 3000 damage on a full charge.
---
The honest ones of you are :p
---
Either lazy, or they were a newer player and thought it was rare. Either way, profit!
---
Why is this big whining going on again? What's up?
---
Me too. Highly original.
---
Not whining. I just think it‚Äôs about time they actually reward people for standing by the game through its various negative states.
---
Epic!
---
Wrong sub for Price checks r/market76 is where you need to go
---
I'm already good. You can repeat your shitposting mantra all you want, it won't change the fact that i have more enjoyable ways to waste my time instead of playing with the current bugs that make the game unenjoyable to me and many others.
---
I got a Santatron this week.
---
Believe me I know
---
My bad. I definitely saw PS4 and my brain still thought Xbox.
---
Massive media scandal?
---
Omfg
---
Whatever you say, scrub.
---
I wouldn't hope for anything more than 100 atoms lol.
---
In the future.
---
Pmsl when are you people going to get the message and stop playing? Do Bethesda need to come to your home and physically assault you before you quit this game? They are milking you, they do not care about bugs, glitches etc. The company is a disgrace and this game a total hot mess that needs deleting.
---
It's a hard cap.
---
Example. Player 1's weapon damage reads 500. Player 1 shoots Player 2 while in PvP. Player 2's armor and damage reduction perks block 150 damage from Player 1's attack, leaving Player 2 exposed to 350 damage. However, the PvP cap reduces that 350 damage to 110 damage. Total damage received by Player 2 is 110.
---
No idea on a price; but FFR on a Gauss might not be the best effect because of the charging mechanism.  Not sure though, I have a bloodied ffr 1a Gauss that sits in my stash.  The Quad I would think would be worth something just being quad, ld isn't the worst.
---
i‚Äôll buy them
---
There is another important perk card bug for unarmed weapons: "covert ops" adds another 0.5 sneak attack on all unarmed weapons except the meat hook.
---
The loot thing is inconvenient, but really just prompted me to use R to loot all when I‚Äôm in a hurry, then worry about being encumbered when I have a second to breathe.  Undoubtedly someone will have a fit about it eventually and claim they can no longer play because of it, but that‚Äôs the new normal going into 2020.
---
So? It doesn't change that people can Still cheat in some way or the other. Of course it's less of a problem on consoles, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still possible to some degree.
---
Fanboyism doesn't get you anywhere but to be ignorant, Same goes for PC Elitists. Just enjoy what you want and let others be lol. The hacking problem is on the devs/publisher. Plenty of small indie studios have much better anti cheat than this. Just look at Squad, Insurgency, etc. As much as I love Bethesda they really need to get some form of anti cheat. Plus they don't even need to go far, they just aren't being given the money by Zenimax to spend on something like easyanticheat.
---
I‚Äôve donated an upvote in your name to the cause. I‚Äôm doing my part.
---
Just downvote the idiotic shit squeezer and move on.
---
Fallout 76 is not a mainline Fallout game, to them this game and its players are free reign for testing new concepts and updates on as well as using to maximize the resources they gain from this project to fund other projects.
---
I know I‚Äôll be downvoted for this and that‚Äôs fair, but it‚Äôs the truth. Fallout 76 will never receive the type of attention or care other projects get. Anything we as players invest into this game is not guaranteed to be reinvested into patches, DLC, or updates. That‚Äôs the risk we‚Äôre taking by playing this game, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been getting. 
---
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I encourage these types of posts: they can only do good. However it‚Äôs important that everyone recognize that we are dealing with a company that doesn‚Äôt view us as particularly important to their end line goals, we should work to change that.
---
My gaming time is also limited, but I've gone back to fo4. I can't wait for fo4 1st to arrive so I can game properly.   
---
\[/sarcasm\]
---
Yes
---
Rebuild your database. Don't system reset. Rebuild it in safe mode. You can find a tutorial on youtube. It helped me but it took my 2tb drive about 5 hours to do lol
---
And that is absolutely okay imo
---
Nuclear Winter is a Battle Royale contest where up to 52 players enter a server and fight to eliminate all other players (except teammates). You can play alone or in teams of up to 4 players. It is a form of PvP. Some people choose to hide in a bush and hope that nothing bad happens for as long as possible, which is a very inefficient but easy way to get the XP required for the bonuses, assuming you have approximately 10-25 hours of real-life time to dedicate to getting those event rewards.
---
So you haven't lost anything to them
---
For? :) I'm on PC
---
I‚Äôve read about the rebuild but was hesitant to try without direct success stories (other than found on dr Google) - but if it sorted you out that gives me some direct feedback , thanks :)
---
I‚Äôd blame Bethesda more then zenimax. Zenimax shows they love their fans with how amazing ESO has been.
---
The spicy mod has fire damage and has a spice can strapped to the side of it. When you swing it, it produces a red swing trail
---
One thing's for sure; it will be full of microtransactions. Wonder what they will call it... "The Soul Forge"? That would be fitting.

Probably his alt account and he probably stacked his alt account with stuff from his main account. Probably has a really really nice low level Tesla
---
Maybe because it's on a bloodied build with good armor and weapon because it's a "second" account?

Thats bethesda‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúscrew you‚Äù to players :P
---
Xp
---
I was unaware they were broken.
---
I'd be shocked if we got that much.
---
Based on the fact their game was purchased and the subscriptions they get on a monthly basis so far/the year people have paid, they should feel appreciated. Any game company should. Especially with the drama surrounded this game. It‚Äôs the community sticking it out that keeps this game alive and I really don‚Äôt wanna see it fall any further down.

Interesting answer
---
Do not delete and do not respec a build character. Search for a vats crit sneak build that details which 8 mutations and armor to use. Keep your sniper build character.
---
Respec perk cards to a different build is pure hell and not worth it. Create a new character out of the vault and follow a build guide that details which mutations to use.
---
Hotfixes don't require approval.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt feel appreciated if I were a musician selling out shows but then hearing more negative reviews then positive, same logic could b applied. I also don‚Äôt think it would do much to quell problems. Sure it‚Äôd b nice and yeah I‚Äôd appreciate it but either way the game is what it is. It gets shat on more then a sidewalk in in past centuries India! It‚Äôs

You're most welcome!   Hope you make these and pass them along to every newbie you see as well!
---
I'm not 100% sure, but you might need a friend to help you there, because I think the plan are learned *after* getting into the BoS computer system, which requires the entire questline to get the military ID, go to the DMV, etc....
---
Zenimax management? It just works!
---
&gt;I've heard it breaks your armor too. And some guns simply break in a few shots. 
---
I played several hours yesterday and today and I did not see anything broken for me. My armors worked fine (vangard/chameleon/lifesaving), my weapons worked fine, no excessive wear (tse handmade, QE combat shotgun,  FE .50 Cal). None of it had a problem. If anything the QE shotty seemed more effective than before, but I have no hard numbers on it.
---
&gt; **you will have the entire gaming media making news and videos bashing Fallout 76 again. It's inevitable** 
---
Dude, they publish about posts people make on this sub that are entirely made up. Who fucking cares at this point about bad PR.   
---
Community managers have ALREADY COMMENTED that its being looked into and a hotfix is inevitable. So tired of keyboard warriors who can't even take the time to see what the devs are actually saying.
---
God forbid anyone look at this post.
---
If people keep giving them money it sends a signal, it means people enjoy it this way and are fine with it.

wait 20 min to get into  a match , last only 2 min because you got no guns or sihhty 1 bullet scoped hunter rifle, while other comes at you with best heavy gun! really fun times-.

Zenimax is a holding company they have nothing to do with video games they exist only to buy more companies and increase profits.
---
like surprise buttsecs love?
---
Zenimax is a holding company, they are not a publisher they are not in the "Video game business" they are in the "buying companies business"
---
Yeah, that 35% damage loss is noticable, makes the ammo consumption worse, especially on a longer fight like SBQ.
---
Got it, small backpack plans were in overseer stash morgantown airport
---
Agree. I wouldn't want to play against consoles it they force auto aim on me. I have no idea how F76 does it on console. But I played GTAV on xbox and the auto aim ruined the game for me, didn't even finish it. Got it on pc and couldn't put it down. Yes is suck with thumb sticks.

So the settlers will be down there

you play with a shotgun because you find it fun, clearly.

What about testing patches before they're released?

It makes too much sense.

I think you can switch back and forth if you have both, I don‚Äôt know how but they said something about it
---
Since a lot of people doesn't wander anymore is hard to do without.

Yess! A turtle enemy !!!!

Oh yes.  Yes it **IS**.  Trust me.  There's some psychotic mentally-ill people playing this game.

L40 bloodied super sledge with improved power attack.

But there was plenty of other players around helping out as well.

What platform are you on? I'm ps4.

They're just in-fucking-competent. Seriously, give us actual private servers with modding tools and watch the community fix every single bug within 2 weeks.
---
I've found it.  It's a static spawn.  Turns up in a single-item wall-mounted display case in one of the small bedrooms.  There is a pickaxe in a similar display case to the right of it.  
---
I also scrapped it nearly immediately afterwards, like an unbelievable idiot, but I'll grab it again tomorrow I guess. :)
---
I think they‚Äôd get even more flak for doing that. At the end of the day u can never please everybody but I can already here the headlines ‚ÄúBethesda thinks they can payoff players to deal with this turd of a game‚Äù. I think they need more communication and a better public representative if they can‚Äôt do better at making updates and fixes more successful. If ur trying and still failing at least let us feel like we‚Äôre in the loop and that we‚Äôre all on the same side
---
Xbox. Only issues we seen is no event loot from players not properly in the event.
---
Nice SpongeBob reference üòÇ
---
It's really not hard, especially if your target is in Power Armor instead of Legendary 'Personal Scale' Armor.  I've one-shot a clanmate wearing full Vanguard Sentinels with full defensive buffs stacked to ridiculous levels.  The meta of the game engine favors irresistible offense over stacking defense.  The best defensive builds are the ones built to just not get hit.
---
I respec'ed mine from heavy guns / melee to bloodied sneak melee a few days ago so I could have some fun trying to oneshot sb's and sheepsquatches, so I never noticed any problems, I just use a shotgun with enforcer to cripple limbs/wings if needed. Melee is great fun.
---
They did not replace all scrap lost. I did send in a ticket when I got aware there is compensation (about three weeks later since we are all well aware they don't do anything on lost items and this was just some scrap) and got a response were they told me they could not confirm this and so I did not get any compensation.
---
Unlike the people that wrote to them they were NOT affected and still got compensation.
---
Theres a perk for throwing farther and it gives you a guidline too. Other than that i think youd need 15 strength and unyeilding buffs to do more damage. Idk if thats true tho its just a gues
---
Two backpack versions, Mini backpack (free, no mods) and Standard backpack (Quest: Pioneer scouts - The order of the tadpole, has mods) The quest is easier than you think, maybe 2 to 7 days to complete. Hardest part is to revive someone.
---
Thanks ^
---
Don't do that. Don't get my hopes up.
---
Don't have it unlocked but have seen it. It's pretty much garbage. It is the flag photo pose, but animated of you putting it in the ground. With a blue vault door with 94 in yellow on it
---
I‚Äôm a long time Bethesda fan, all my friends know my love for TES and Fallout, but I can‚Äôt defend them anymore. It‚Äôs just getting embarrassing now, it‚Äôs heartbreaking
---
It's a good day for hunting down bloody unyielding build PVPers who have done you wrong.
---
This is amazing
---
Been playing for a year and not purchased one single atom. What is the point it makes no difference to the playability of the game and who cares what colour power armour I have?
---
That's great for console yeah. Unfortunately on PC we don't have such luxeries of getting a full lobby. Which is the reason why the map size is being cut constantly for us.
---
That is funny, I wonder what gems we would get for a Fo4 1st goty edition? 
---
I did a lot of soul searching before buying a months sub to 1st, but I have to say as a solo player, being able to have the world to myself and use workshops standing is quite a relief.
---
Took a workshop in adventure earlier just because I needed acid and was visiting vendor camps, ganked in first defend event by a 370ish PVP player. Never see it coming, stealth one shot jobby. Rebooted to 1st, nice üòÅüëç
---
Thanks! It's been driving me crazy because I want to see it!!
---
Thanks! I've wanted to see it for a while now
---
Currently nude under the Ranger outfit, very squishy but quite fun, loads of carry weight space now too. Only three weapons and no armor.
---
I have a couple of friends who were compensated that did not lose any scrap whatsoever. It sucks. I could careless about the scrap, but the vault steel was way too much. I also purchased Fallout 1st on the first day it was released. I didn't get anything.
---
Their software release process (especially to live) must be dire. QA have their own environment and these problems would have already been seen before the live release was built and deployed.
---
Media scandal lol
---
Thanks. :(
---
I like how this post will grow into...

Well spotted, post wrong build, I've so many now I get muddled.

Imagine you are an incompetent &amp; lazy worker or company and you provide terrible service or product. A horde of your customers rushes in and willingly pays a year ahead subscription to your service or product. What do you do for a year? The same you did before because you can't magically start being competent if you didn't in your long years of work, and there is no point in working hard if you're getting your money anyway. There I hope the great mystery is solved.   
---
For those who disagree paying more money for shitty service doesn't make it better, switch all of your services to the worst you can find in the area and pay double for them, and on your job, try promoting and raising salaries for the worst performing employees, then you'd definitely see those great changes.
---
Absolutely sure I didn't order Power Armor Edition. I saw something (here I think?) saying pre-order customers could grab the avatars and 76 theme prior to release, but it was a really small window to do so IIRC.
---
Oh whatever, you'll gobble anything up thrown at you. If you let the first 30 things slide (doxxed info, duffle bag, nuka rum, mods paywall, day 1 discounted emojis(very illegal), and about few dozen other things) then this isn't going to stop you or anyone else still swimming in this dumpster fire.
---
My mouse wheel can‚Äôt take it any more! üòÇ
---
I tried contacting them after I found out about the Vault Steel compensation as I got 1st the day the patch went out, but sadly they managed to Verify I didn't lose anything, so them saying otherwise is bullshit.

I hate that is does this. Use the scrap box first then I can save things in my stash. I‚Äôve had to put mine in my vendor for 25000c just do they don‚Äôt get scrapped. What a waste of 4 slots.
---
I'd bet money that they can't roll it back without also breaking the holiday events and shit, so they're probably just going to ignore it and hope that the low level people joining for free play won't notice an issue because they don't have legendary shit.

We need a Jackalope criptid to kick our asses.

Bloodied Mess. In Luck. Rank 3. Need it.

The slugger perks dont help you. I recommend blocker. I notice a huge difference between when I use it and when I dont.  You need all the sneak and stealth perks in agility. It will triple your damage.
---
Also get Talons and Twisted Muscles Mutations
---
jup it does the same. it seems like it is "rebooting" all effects (special, carry weight etc) with every reload. i am one second overencumbered then it resets to carrycapacity "with perks".
---
at least it doesn break all effects permanently.

Get rid of pharma pharma and get bloody mess. Lose white knight and get either sneak or ninja.

You're using a bloodied dcg but not running radicool. Are you running full unyielding armor?
---
What's your dmg look like?
---
i would also love one of them okdschool microphones :)
---
The max possible damage 1 player can deal to another in one shot is 110, and the base health players have is (iirc) 250 excluding perks, endurance ranks, chems, etc.  
---
Thus they cannot one shot you unless you are running a bloody build.
---
This is correct. The larger problem is there are a lot of rich assholes with more money than sense and they'll buy shit just to say they've bought it. Seen a lot of people on this sub admit they'll buy whatever bullshit is shoveled by bethesda simply because they have the money and nothing better to do with it than pat themselves on the back for being idiots.
---
Avoid media scandal? But this whole scandal is more like a free advertising. Bethesda should not avoid it. They should embrace it. Thrre is nothing better than a totally free social media buzz in the Festive season.
---
Also...the higher your strength, the higher your damage. Find armor pieces with +1 Strength and find a Shielded Forest Operative Underarmor, it will give you +3 to your strength all by itself.
---
Keep in mind that Awareness eats 2 points. I guess you could go with 1‚òÜ in each Rifleman and save the 6 points that you could invest in something else, like 3‚òÜ Long Shot (for 30% better range), 1‚òÜ (2p points) in Awareness, and 1‚òÜ in Glow Sight.
---
It may not be universal, but there's definitely a widespread issue with reloading breaking primary armor effects. Every time I reload it breaks the unyielding effect on my armor and my strength drops fro 33 to 18 until I unequip and reequip the pieces.
---
There isn't much variation with resistance levels. It's gonna be somewhere between 0 and 300. The main point is that the number you see is after armor penetration, you can equip tank killer and see the armor value go down. Once you memorize the armor numbers you don't need to run with awareness full time, it's just for testing.
---
You want this shit to stop? The solution is simple: cancel your sub if you have it and uninstall. In multiplayer games people are content too. Let their metrics sink across the board including daily logins and then they will notice. Personally i've uninstalled the game on the day sub was introduced and i will not reinstall it until they start releasing weekly patches that fix bugs and raid lags and we get alternative ways to get scrap box and secondary camp.
---
Take all of yes, I love cooking and brewing in this game and would welcome more recipes. Like maybe some egg nog, pudding and mulled wine?
---
Number don't matter; Stabilized definitely improves real accuracy and it's very easy to test - just shoot something far away with and without it...
---
&gt; It's not not that all of those youtubers want to report on negative things either.
---
Bullshit. Most of them are fucking salivating at the chance to make another video filled with faux outrage over a game they never play unless they need background video to accompany their 10 minute (no more no less, just enough to get it monetized) rants.

Where do you find him in the build menu? Do you have to scrap your existing Scraptron first? Needs to be a tab for just Atom Shop stuff.

What rewards can I get? Just costumes?
---
I'm going to check out of this game until they fix it.  I've had 7 HARD crashes since this patch (freezing on spawn), freezing drinking water, sudden crashes to desktop, all normal. NEVER HAPPENS with any other game except FO4 which is SUPER RARE and understandable with mods up the wazoo installed.  My laptop will crash to desktop (usually) so I'll keep collecting caps.  Just got Mechwarrior 5 and am going to see how much a time suck it will be.  If it's total, I'm cancelling 1st and coming back when things get fixed.
---
Owl_No is my psn
---
How accurate are they in VATS pvp? I use Q25 + QLimb, they're fun, but *very* difficult to actually hit smn outside of vats and even in...
---
Thanks man! I forgot to mention my mutations I do already have those ur a huge help
---
Well the fact that the studio who makes TES and the other non-Obsidian fallout games didn't make fo76 should be enough. The amount of hate being directed towards the wrong people is silly. I've seen a many times people screaming that Starfall and TES 6 are going to be trash because of how bad fo76 is. That makes no sense.
---
Ho Ho Ho... Now I have a machine gun
---
Idk how u can think that a pistol doing 8 damage per hit is more powerful than an auto rifle with 3 times the dps, melee deadly?? U need to play like a rat to die immediately after. U know what will be good? More maps to play decently various weapons, a only close quartier map with limited number of players, something different, we don't need to adapt, there are so many way to use nuclear winter but they have no interest in.
---
I cannot reproduce this. I used furious explosive 50cal and excavator pwr armor with rank 1 stabilized. It appeared to work just fine for me.
---
&gt;Why the fuck do so many people think that rolling back the games build is just some magic switch they can just flip?
---
Because it is a thing in MMOs.  People need to accept 76 is just a very shitty port of a first person game that lets you play barebones fallout with a few random people at a time and not an mmo
---
Wow okay I will definitely do all this, at half health of rads I‚Äôm hitting around 440 damage
---
And I only have two unyielding armours and rest are vanguards
---
Yea you should be at almost 5x that fully blooded with no food or chem buffs
---
Oh no, someone who paid us money is going to stop playing our game he paid money for. Maybe a video of you setting your computer on fire will help.
---
 Quad, +50% limb dmg  is scrip.
---
Trying to go against the 76 hate farmers is pointless.  Best to just ignore them and let the true fans play the game just fine.
---
I heard from a friend that survival is returning with wastelanders but I never heard that myself. Meaning it‚Äôs a secondary source and not a primary, also I do well to keep up with info releases from Bethesda but I never heard them mention it
---
The "weight" value for the weapon has no bearing whatsoever on the movespeed penalty. This is a hidden stat that can only be determined with Xedit or Creation Kit.
---
The movespeed penalty for Heavy Guns is the only one great enough to be affected by more than one buff.
---
"he'd race over"... It's a protectron.  Step... step... lean over... step... readjust direction... step...

Amazing

GTAs targeting system isn't used by many games. Most games just have a bit of aim assist, its not an auto lock.
---
Go to Morgantown and follow the river south to Flatwoods and then west through the dried lakebed until you hit the big river. Gather all the bloodleaf you find. Climb up to the road that leads back to Flatwoods and wander around the area gathering soot flower.
---
Collect some water, head to a cooking station, and make yourself a ton of healing salve which has the same potency as a diluted stim. If you have the green thumb perk you should be able to collect 100+ of each plant in a matter of 15 minutes, and there's nothing particularly dangerous in the area so you won't waste healing items in the process.
---
Ditch the vanguard. Invest in nerd rage and serendipity. But if you really want dmg resist, have a few bolstering pieces. 
---
I run 4 unyielding pieces and 1 lifesaving +1 strength. Just the armor and perks (no food or chem buffs) my dcg hits at around 1800. More than twice that once I start adding food and chems
---
PVP in PA is dope. People who say opposite have no idea or are too used to wreck foodbuilds in Excavator.  
---
If you want to take it a bit further, craft a X-01 torso with stealtboy and put both torsos on fav wheel, so you can swap in combat between stealthboy (to counter VATS crits) and Strangler protocols. Don't forget jetpack on arms. And also maybe look into superstim/nuka perks, to have an extra survivability with pvpers with explo lasers...
---
Allow full crossplay, but have an option to turn it off in the settings for the babys that think one platform provides an avantage over another
---
The problem with the shotguns isn't just the damage, it's your armor piercing...or I should say, LACK OF, as well as your crappy short range to the point it looks ridiculous wielding one. Anytime you're facing higher up critters with 300 DR, you're doing severely low damage, down to 97 or so. Shotguns need a piercing modification or piercing perk to make them useful, otherwise they're just simply tickling enemies. 
---
The only shotgun that has innate armor piercing is the combat shotgun with the perforating modification of 40%, Which can be useful with an armor piercing modification for run and gun playstyles. For some reason, the pump action and double barrel have modifiers that scream "USE ME IN VATS", but their AP usage is so high, it makes me wonder 'why bother'? 
---
Pistols overall are terrible because they lack firepower, and the revolvers are useless because of the lack of armor piercing modification and wonky fire rate that can only be buffed by sacrificing your damage greatly and getting a legendary modifier. They overall need a damage buff, and revolvers just honestly need a rework. Damage buff, armor piercing modifier, ability to fan the hammer for rapid, close range mayhem.  
---
Not everyone loves to be in VATS mode 24/7, Bethesda, sometimes people just wanna play as cowboys or covert ops by aiming down sights or firing from the hip without silly green all over their screen.
---
I am actually only 61 ants away from having it the emote and I can tell you it has been a long grind.
---
Maybe it has to do with two shot lowering accuracy.?
---
Very cool build! :)
---
Yeah - my thoughts exactly.  Used a couple recently to try out ( I normally use the perk card ) and it made no difference - no increase in caps. So I'll just flog them off ie sell.
---
Unless something changed recently, Tesla rifles only come in level 40 and 50 varieties.
---
What endgame?
---
Yes. Usually this sub is like an Orwell book, you don't tow the party line and the thought police shall punish you with their down votes. As specially if you say anything negative about 1st. This Orwell line has gotten me a lot of down votes.
---
&gt;and we both know, I'm one of those "whales" you don't want to lose. Consider me at this point endangered.*
---
I doubt you're a whale.  Unless you've bought everything in the Atom shop.  And if you were a real whale you'd have paid for the year sub, not do it monthly.
---
Take your empty threats somewhere else.
---
It does happen, though you have to look for it. I've seen you on server several times; if you had you *own* workshop, there would certainly be some PvP... Just take Hemlock Holes and smn will come to you - it's become a real raider magnet.
---
Nice one üòÇ
---
The Austin studio is under the umbrella of BGS, as are Montreal and Dallas.  Given that Dallas and Austin are both involved with 76, and Todd Howard is still credited as the director of the game and acts as the public face of the project, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that 76 is as much a Bethesda game as any other.
---
Yep.
---
Honestly do not believe SF or TES6 will have nearly the problems we have had nor the amount of controversy. Especially since Starfield is a brand new IP that I‚Äôm sure Bethesda wants to keep a good opinion of for as long as possible to ensure future sequels and spinoffs aren‚Äôt hurt by any poor decisions.
---
76 doesn‚Äôt get that luxury, that‚Äôs understandable. But there definitely needs to be more done for such a loyal fanbase.
---
I'm not sure about the exact numbers, so I can't tell you whether you've learned all the mods for that gun that can be learned by scrapping. But it's true that some mods can only be learned from actual plans you need to buy or find. In fact, a good rule of thumb is that if a plan exists for a mod (i.e. it drops from a quest/event or can be bought from a vendor) that mod can not be learned by scrapping. Case in point: the overwhelming majority of receivers which change the ammo type on a gun can only be learned from a plan.
---
Not just water. Now that you mention it, I distinctly remember filling my food gauge and then fast travelling to a location only to notice a couple minutes later that I was empty on food again. I didn't think nothing of it at the time though.
---
Perhaps.
---
The only issue I have with this is that Bethesda DID NOT make FO76. BattleCry studios made FO76 with a cameo appearance by Todd Howard at E3.
---
If its curious as to why a BGS studio would suddenly drop in all obserable experience and talent its because BattleCry studio is not the BGS studio that's earned its reputation, its just a re-brand of a weak/obsolete team. BGS Austin is not the same team/studio/standard/expectations/talent/results as BGS Maryland.
---
I think its time we stop referring to FO76 as a BGS game because frankly I won't ever consider BattleCry studio to be the same thing as BGS, no matter what they rename them.
---
Who was the department head or manager or whatever who OKed the patch to go live?
---
Someone take some responsibility - and then fall on your sword.
---
Thank you üòä
---
Yes! Green wallpapers and the Christmasstuff from last year would be great too.... and I hope for pretty new things like Outfits and weapon Skins \^\^
---
thank you for respecting that the mechanics are not accepted by many and acting accordingly.
---
You found a great way to phrase it as well.
---
the seldom occasion i take a WS i always get attacked (i guess because my high level is like a pvp invitation for players)
---
i only build underground for that reason so even if a triggerhappy dude that would be served better by a real pvp game doesnt get the clue and starts throwing atomic mines on the ground to somehow hit me i have enough space to either just travel away, keep on crafting till he gives up, or give em gammagunhell from down below.
---
I want to believe!
---
So an Update: 
---
After uninstalling and reinstalling completely on both consoles (finally completed an hour ago or so) it still blue screened on both immediately after app start. Moved game on husband‚Äôs console to the external to see if it would work from that hard drive and it still blue screened immediately. Even when plugged in to my console. Did the System rebuild from safe mode on Husband‚Äôs console then - didn‚Äôt take too long luckily -  it still instantly blue screened. 
---
Same with my console then as well.
---
We now had to as last resort re-initialize fully both consoles. 
---
My game is now once again downloading the update - reinstalling (I‚Äôm disc based and do not have my own backup external). Husband‚Äôs was backed up to external luckily and now after initializing his is working once again. 
---
It seems something in Patch 16 completely screwed something up on both our consoles completely which so far only a full initialize is fixing.
---
Or...hear me out. Give revolvers armor piercing and pistols in general a chance to crit outside of vats so people can have fun outside of VATS.
---
I hope it is or will somehow be separate in the future. I say this because the game is bad enough for me with things that make it almost unplayable somedays, and the fact that every time I log in and play for any amount of time I'm always being bothered by players trying to pvp me and I emote no but they are A holes and don't seem to get it.
---
With all the challenges (which is pretty much all I do these days) wanting you to wear a mask I would appreciate a few masks that isn't as weird as the fasnascht masks. Perhaps gasmasks could be masks? Could bandanas count as masks? It would make for a much better look when doing those challenges.
---
Thanks for sharing that. I had searched the whole place a couple times and came up empty handed. Oh, and the scrapping, well, that happens more often than not.
---
Oh ya I used to smack people with the ashead. I have a montage of some pretty crazy kills with it.
---
Damn that sucks but also good to know. Hopefully now that it's an issue in both game modes it'll get fixed faster.
---
I agree about the patch part. But I think with all the in game problems 1st should be free at least until Wastlanders. And if Wastlanders flops it should stay free.
---
The Paladin's armour could be covered in ultracite crystals, and the event completion had a chance to reward these crystals letting you eventually craft your own set of scorched power armour.
---
Not sure about what buffs it would have
---
The problem with PvP is that (in my experience) the aggressor is 200+ levels above their intended target and use legendary weapons that make single shot kill through armour. No challenge, just bullshit bullies that are too gutless too take on those of their own level. If Bethesda could fix this so that a griefer can only target an equal level the PvP would be a challenge and worth being a part of. However the only way I could see that working is reducing damage to lesser levels when in PvP, and that would cause issues with other creatures with lesser levels.
---
You should be able to 'open' your power armor as a storage when you have it placed down and you can go to your ammo and place whichever specific fusion core you want in it
---
Ultracite cores are only for ultracite plasmagatlings
---
You mean have it equipped for learning where you would get best results when you shoot at specific enemies? Usually I go for heads, or limbs to cripple stuff. For example I hit robots arms cos once they loose them they go into a self-detonate program and it's fun to watch.
---
Are the other pieces going down? what kind of armor is it?
---
PAs just love those yummy, delicious ultracite cores... So yes.
---
Good ideas. I know camp McClintock is great for clipboards &amp; i think a Yao Guai will give you 7 springs? Ive been crafting &amp; scrapping radiums &amp; go through them fast
---
Lmaooo 1 thing you can learn from this is to call them on their bs so you can get a more direct answer.
---
Well I can tell you for sure Ultracite gattling use normal fusion cores. Unless you prime them, then they use Ultracite fusion cores. Same with normal gattling lasers
---
How do you build underground? Through that chair-on-a-stairway glitch?
---
Yes this, and then he'll swing his arms where the enemy was a sec ago. I always find them quite comical.
---
I disagree with you there.  Ive been in there and had some bad experiences with the group.
---
Let's not kid ourselves.  99.9999% of the player made holotapes you'd find would be offensive, a rant about some triviality or 30 solid minutes of them burping, sniffling and eating chips into their mic.  At best we could hope for an audio version of Tik Tok, which is a pretty low bar to aspire to.
---
I'm sure there'd be the tiny fraction of role players that try to start their own narrative, but that would certainly be the exception to the rule.  There's no way I'd sit through 999 minutes of crap to potentially listen to 1 minute of something mildly entertaining.
---
I feel myself in BETA, again, the same old bugs and "server not responding" thing.
---
If you have normal fusion cores, the PA uses that first, after you run out, it starts using ultracite cores. If you lose 1% of condition from you ultracite fusion cores, your power armor converts it to standard fusion core.
---
&gt;The "weight" value for the weapon has no bearing whatsoever on the movespeed penalty.
---
Right, that's why I mentioned there was no difference between a weight of 0.3 and 22.8. 
---
&gt;The movespeed penalty for Heavy Guns is the only one great enough to be affected by more than one buff. 
---
I beg your pardon, but did you not read past the first sentence of my comment, or are you just ignoring it? Do you want video proof? 
---
Again, none of those perks stack with Speed Demon, period. And again, I invite you to test this on your own with a stopwatch.
---
on PS4 reloading definitely removes chameleon legendary effect.
---
You've been around other people, right?  Never underestimate human stupidity and cruelty.  If you give some players a new way to irritate you, they will take full advantage.  If they can use anonymity to be outrageously offensive, they'll really sink the claws in.
---
Behind the white spring trainstation on the mountain above the blackwater mine are a few billboard signs. One has a few black cats that spawn there.
---
Yeah I always assume it was cut because the effects would be too difficult to implement. Could be wrong though..
---
yes it works reliable (short desc: put foundation on ground level, stairs up in any direction, place floormat, place bass on floormat, put floormat with bass on it upon stairs so the head of the bass is just above the second-to-highest stair, place stairs with stuff on it so it goes down into the ground from foundation, play bass)
---
What a pathetic post. People begging a company to behave normal/orderly? PLeAse Avoid Scandal! LoooL
---
thank you. and they are tameable?
---
I checked each time. Nothing.
---
I am level 130 with X01 armour and had just finished an extended battle with 6 level 68 mutants, before I could rehealth some jerk level 320 shot me from behind, then as I  was bent over waving my arms fanatically  asking for help he/she stood there and watched. It was like he/she sat in the scrub watching until the battle was over then decided to swoop in and take my loot. But hey that is the game, I love the game, it has flaws but nothing that will stop me from playing a couple of hours each day.
---
I agree to some degree. Most of the lore worked ok when it was released. Hellfire in Vault 51 is very questionable. Liberty prime power armor, while not directly dependent on liberty prime is definately not in the possibility of the lore. All these big heads would really be a big no-no. Do you think there's not enough dangers in the wasteland? Then limit your visibility with this big Mr Fuzzy head.
---
Brotherhood is a pretty late questline. Have you done firebreather quests yet? Just follow the main storyline. 
---
You can find power armor stations all over the place, there are several in Morgantown I believe. I wouldn‚Äôt waste resources building it. I am pretty sure you will get plans for free eventually.
---
I love some more details on you build sounds great .. I have a 110 level sneak sniper a 90 level melee I‚Äôm trying to change to power armour heavy having started to go to commando and a newbie level 25 I‚Äôm working towards commando .. 
---
Sounds like I could do more with the 110 level with fewer changes
---
That's one way to look at it. I'm almost 300 and never engage folks under 100, but if I see a workshop taken by higher lvl (and the higher or more people, the better), I will go for it - players with that lvl should know and be prepared for pvp in workshop; that warning sign is quite prominent.
---
On the other hand, when owning multiple workshop (especially Hemlock, Ammo factory and Power plants), I get often attacked by players from 60-150, trying to perfect their own pvp builds... And why not? It's not like game punishes you for death anyway,
---
[Seriously, how nice would it be to have something like this? I'd happily shell out some atoms for a piece that looks something like these for my CAMPs.](https://superchoicecarpet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sc-768x512.jpg)
---
Why can screws be a craft able item, some steel and so forth, it would be op unless it was around 5-10 steel and some plastic to make one, solves the entire problem
---
Oh, I do, I posted on a thread where someone was excited about it a few minutes ago. It's probably downvoted now, ha.  
---
Actually, not yet...

How do you do the grafton pawn quest?
---
Honestly, I haven't seen much of anything on YouTube about this  JuiceHead had a neutral/positive slant on the patch.  This game is becoming irrelevant due to mediocrity.
---
Or an elevator
---
Ahhh... that'd explain why I didn't know, I avoid any of the PVP modes.
---
And there ya go!  The LP Power Armor could be a red herring.  Or misdirection.  Or just recycling the propaganda programming for morale purposes.  I think it still works in the lore, really.
---
Definitely both
---
Then you should already know about everything...
---
Anyway i use a powerfist for all the first and 3rd raid. In meltdown i use strangler PA with a instigatin,ss,+1strenght shark skinned pickaxe lol and a explosive combat shotgun for the geck where i cripple all ghouls and leave them there.
---
I guess it's both.
---
What you don't quite understand is that there could be multiple reasons those bugs are happening. They identified one or a few and fixed those
---
It's a display issue, you still get the rewards.
---
Got a base at acid node down the Pleasant Valley station, with a small cliff and a pond; will try it there...
---
Past evidence says that won't happen
---
Unfortunately but wishful thinking lol
---
You're wrong the more damage you do the better in Pvp, if a player has 500/500 damage resist and your pipboy says your weapon is doing let's say 100, then your gonna tickle the player(doing about 15 damage per hit), now if your pipboy says your weapons is doing 700 damage then you're gonna get the full cap of 110... Thats facts.
---
You're wrong and your statement barely makes sense, luckily I am sat with with my kids who were able to translate your Jibberish.
---
Why do you think the better PvPers run low health builds again now? A lot are still at full health but if you know how pvp works you will realise a low health build does the most damage in Pvp.
---
Test servers. Where are your test servers now?
---
Some mirror/medical cabinets above sinks, first aid containers and doctors bags will also give chems.
---
When you look inside the mirror or bag ect press triangle for your extra chems.
---
I can't see how at least one new end game event, ala Scorched Earth or Encryptid, wouldn't be included with Wastelanders.  Given that the DLC is being promoted as an entirely new main quest line, some sort of end game content is a given.
---
Scorched Earth and Encryptid are both very popular, at least with all the end gamers I associate with.  Project Paradise requires a little convincing, but I can drag people in and they seem much more enthusiastic after getting a Bear arm or mod plan.  I think Free Range was planned to appeal to end gamers, but like the Burrows, the devs underestimated what their players are capable of.  I think they compensated with Vault 94.  Initially I hated it, but I actually enjoy my week of Dead in the Water.  Washout is also ok.  It's definitely geared towards hardcore players.
---
I'm sure Bethesda tracks player data and reads what their fans say.  It'd be hard to believe they wouldn't use that information to inform future decisions regarding content.  Something more server/community based, like Scorched Earth or Encryptid, would be preferable to the instanced team/solo experience of V94.  Personally I'd like it to be difficult, but not impossible for a casual player to participate in.
---
I have a build for every class bar pistols. If you're doing rifleman then vats works superbly. Also instigating on just about any purely single shot rifle is fantastic, couple it with a sneak or critical and whatever you're shooting usually drops.
---
I love my heavy weapons character as well, feel like a walking tank and the dps is mad. Both are incredibly strong builds and fun to play as.
---
Oh man, I am addicted to those old sci-fi, horror, radio drama shows...some sound eerily familiar to Fallout .   If you are into that type...you are gonna love this ish.

---
Dmg go down with range thats why people go down with health... Most of them they are stupid they cant kill me without vats we your teories and pvp build and what you now about pvp in f76 in practise
---
It's actually far more likely there are two development versions, one with tons of fixes (wastelanders) and the version we have. Rather than push all changes to one version, this allows them to make huge changes quicker on the wastelanders edition. Since they are different builds though, merging or pulling fixes caused a lot of problems and needs to be fixed.
---
Xbox. What I said is a fact, why you think Junkies and Bloodied are the most valuable weapons to PvPers... Yes there is a damage cap, but there damage resist and later today I'll post a video, verifying this. You don't have a clue about Pvp judging from your statement.
---
I will not waste my time defending what I've said.
---
Hmm, Excavator PA? Related to Firefighters maybe? Would make the most sense to me.
---
Lol I think the guy you replied to gets it, just doesn't know how to word it correctly.  
---
Also it is quite possible to one shot player, e.g. with some pimped B/JE flechetted harpoon, as every flechette counts to that 110 cap separately. Even QEH in PA will two- or three-shot most unprepared folks.

Todd is also in there
---
Ah fair enough. Yeh you can definitely one shot certain builds, if they're weak or don't know how to set up a build but a meta PvPer build can't be one shot anymore. I agree with you though on what you say, and you can make an OP PA build if you know how things work. In PA you can negate 90% on incoming damage with perks, mutations and emergency protocols, though PA still seems weak asf in vats lol.
---
wtf
---
Who was talking to you?
---
Found the foodie!
---
The sniper needs stealth, perk multipliers, distance and a legendary silenced rifle. It is one of the most effective endgame builds, so maybe you are not doing something right. 
---
My sniper needs s THE mob controller at events. I one-shoot all high-level enemies except the typical deathclaws and queens or hunters. And it is not bloodied: just 9 points in rifleman, bloody mess, covert ops. 
---
Commando gives you better DPS, but the sniper can shine.
---
I imagine this is happens because lots of players have mules, so they can afford to keep 600 pounds in their stash of highly overpriced garbage.
---
Since I don't use mules, I only put in my vendor things I imagine somebody could want so no berserker, nocturnal, etc...
---
But as I'm far from whitespring where are located most of the camps, so I don't have a lot of customers, I put low prices. Most nocturnals in players' vendors are more expensive than my average weapons, and I saw the exact same item as the one I sell at 2 or 3 times my price
---
btw i'm on PS4, come to my camp, I still have a deep pocketed plan for 50 caps! lol
---
He is watching us from there
---
Seriously? This game is a fucking joke, man.
---
So when can we expect new RepairKit to hit the store so we can use our real money to fix this bug?
---
This is actually pretty cool.
---
Not when you think about *how* it has spawned in there.
---
It hurts to say this, but by the time Wastelanders is out, NPC's will be necessary due to many people leaving the game. Last bug of a patch is game-breaking.
---
The one developer working on the game is probably on his/her holiday leave alreasy. Perhaps in January there will be another patch.
---
Definitely both.
---
A horde of centaurs. I remember my first time seeing one in fallout 3, can‚Äôt ever forget it. Shit was disgusting to look at lol
---
No you get the rewards, they just don‚Äôt show on screen. I thought that yesterday and after doing a few I realised I was getting scrip etc. Even got a badge from stings and things.
---
Good Pvp is dead, for example 3 teams of four battling across Whitesprings, no sbs, no teslas just good old fashioned shootouts with ballistic weapons. Now everyone and their gran uses sbs and teslas, mixed with chems and quantums... Which I will admit can be fun... For 10 minutes. There are still people who pvp using handmades etc but it seems to be getting rarer. That was the best part about survival, you wouldn't get these OP tesla Sb builds because they couldn't carry around large quantities of the shit that kept them alive, they'd run the risk of losing it all and did do, so they stayed away from survival or came in to fight fair. Survival should of stayed the same, high risk, high reward... It was much better even if you didn't wanna pvp, as you never knew what you were gonna walk in to or who was following you vice versa.
---
It‚Äôs clearly that when Bethesda Games also formed into Bethesda Publishing Studios that this was the direction they were headed. It happened before Fallout 4 and they published a few bland titles, Fallout 4 went in the direction to appease other people rather than the fan base who made 3 and NV successful and unfortunately it worked and albeit being known as the lesser of the three, still sold a massive amount. Even the DLC bland. I‚Äôd rather Fallout was just branched off to another company now. Maybe that‚Äôs what they‚Äôll do when they buy companies. It‚Äôs clearly Bethesda Games Studios is just the Publishing Studio now. If they want the be EA etc, then just give the franchises to a sister company that‚Äôll handle it with care and give them good development time. (And have a better engine).
---
I only wear prime armor when i want to flex on some dwellers with my $18 worth of atoms. Even working normally, i get tired of hearing it.
---
Upvoted just for a fellow Paladins warrior :D  
---
Can't believe that I play Paladins more than 76 these days.
---
You don't have to accept the mechanics, but they are what they are.
---
I think this weekend.
---
I do not know why, but I think that's what they want, i have no idea why, they can not be that stupid on fixing their  game, i wont believe that...
---
What platform are you on? If it's PC, I made a mod that silences the audio:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/370
---
When Wastelanders flops*
---
I'd hope something drops today, but i doubt it. Won't really affect those starting with the free trial cause they won't have any of the legendary armor for awhile even with double xp.
---
Probably because he's just trying to get views on his shitty video when he could type his ideas instead, since this is a text-based forum.
---
Yes, you won't oneshot full SentAss ofc, that takes quite a lot of effort. Plenty of people show up horribly unprepared though - but that's the learning process.
---
And I do pvp in PA, it's fun, but whenever I meet vats-crit opponent, I have to switch to stealhtboy torso or straight SB mark III, or I'm dead in a second.
---
Do you even play 76? There‚Äôs a fucking year of proof right there with what he said. Mongoloid.
---
This is the worst fuck up i have known in this game yet since BETA (imo). I have even had to start playing other games, since i just cannot play this game atm. It appears as though the armour issue is affecting everyone, not just a handful like normal.
---
Its not the only bug thats there since launch, i can think for 10 seconds and remember at least 5.
---
Becouse dmg go down with range you are lucky you play on xbox you will be finish like ex enclave general from ps4
---
Seeing as new players probably aren‚Äôt using legendary armor I don‚Äôt think they will notice
---
Take off the chest piece and you won't hear it anymore
---
I'm starting to see the same players over and over, so yeah...
---
Bethesda can actually do this. They have said it themselves, they take various versions of the game update it. Say patch 12 of the game didn't have the bug armor resistance bug, they update that and roll it out. If it doesn't work they just downgrade it with a previous version of the game. There is no 1 version of fallout 76. They do a trial a error of fixes so if they fix a bug in patch 15, it could be a updated version of the game after patch 13. That's why so many new and old bugs reappear. They don't fix things like writing a book, page after page. They fix something currently and never go back and rewrite the previous pages and that leads to a incoherent story.
---
Well considering some people play games for an escape from dealing with shitty people, or as a way to deal with depression, or it's there only real form of socialising etc, it's probably hard on their mental health. Especially when you spend hours doing something in game only to have it undone by some asshole just to get his kicks.
---
imagine how much atoms you need to buy a prydwen model :D
---
I have realised now, that it is defaulting to a 'Team only' private world, hence the join option missing from the friends social menu. The text at the bottom of the screen when selecting a private world is a toggle, whatever it is currently displaying is the setting that is applied when the world is launched. Seems a little un-intuitive to me as it was displaying as "X - Team only" and I read that as needing to press X before the team only option was selected. But at least it works
---
Maybe not Prydwen, but an actual small placeable airship would be cool.
---
Gonna try this and this will probably change my life.
---
maybe a slightly bigger veryibot yeah i agree that would be cool üëçüèº
---
Yup, its just a bad move, 
---
And telling us in the patchnotes that it was moved to the light section but not telling us it got more budget is insulting.
---
Then the musician should stop breaking his instruments, and maybe he would get positive reviews.
---
You break everything. You are worth than the Goons.
---
Lol, said the guy that doesn't understand how pvp works. If you're referring to TehSandman on PS4, he's shit...
---
They‚Äôd have to provide a cap sink first.
---
So how many have you killed so far?
---
Undoing the patch would cancel Christmas. Do you really want to cancel Christmas?
---
Community Manager in here has already said they‚Äôre looking into it, yeah stock response, but that‚Äôs all there is too it right now..
---
It does, but it goes against what you said so you're dismissing/ignoring it.
---
100% agree. Perhaps make some legendary weps or armor available for purchase. Price them extremely high, but nonetheless a goal. A reason to save and spend. Rotate the selection. Increase travel costs
---
To craft Ultracite variants of any ammo type, you need the prime receiver plans drop from the SBQ, though you can also get these from time to time out of the regular scorchbeasts, albeit rarely.
---
In the case of the 45 ammo, there's a few different options that'll open it up (either the lever gun or combat rifle receiver for example), though you'll need the prime receiver added to the weapon to fire it of course, you can't use in a non-primed weapon.
---
Lots of hoops to jump through just to play a game. Especially when I don't have to do any of it to play ANY other game. But I'll give some of it a try.
---
Thanks. Yes I have a JE pipe revolver rifle with prime receiver. Thx
---
You need a prime receiver plan from the SBQ which will enable you to craft the ammo for it - in this case .45.
---
Then you use the tinkers bench - craft - bottom of the menu.
---
Too much!  Love it!  Thank you for posting!  (and building!)
---
It just works...
---
Enough...
---
What - have they made the game free to play? When did that happen?
---
If Wastelanders fails - which is more than likely seeing this last patch - they will probably stop supporting the game.
---
That someone knows this is amazing
---
Yep. Whales are the root problem with this game imo.
---
Their customer service is probably one of the worst in the industry, and that‚Äôs saying something.
---
Coward who run from servers on yt you have videos when he leave word when good players join in....
---
Yeh I've seen, well that's soemthing we agree on. üëç
---
&gt;It may not be universal, but there's definitely a widespread issue with reloading
---
Oh yeah, I didn't mean to imply that there isn't an issue,  just that it seems to be rather random on how and who it hits!
---
It is currently bugged. Also both helmet *and* torso are responsible for the voice.
---
Ya, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that it doesn't exist,  just that it's not universal... I'm on PC BTW
---
This is  Awesome, the first words out of my  mouth, WTF, Lmao! 
---
You have a very creative mind, keep up the great work. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
Merry Xmas Ya Filthy Animal, and a Happy New Year!

I think it kicks off tomorrow ( Sydney time ) Friday.

Here it is in the strangler pa
---
standard armor? odds are it is solar, but thorns is also an option
---
power armor? strangler heart
---
I was wondering this myself, I have the regular collectron (which I don't have) in resources, but Santa is nowhere to be seen.
---
So what does the strangler heart armor do? And the solar armor is what I was wondering about.
---
Im fine too, so are my ps4 brothers
---
Hey good to know!

If you‚Äôre on PS4 and need it still, I‚Äôm sure I have spare plans or can show you where to get them free (relatively easy). There is a quest to make Excavator Power Armor, but if you borrow someone‚Äôs and scan it, you get completion and obtain the plan for free.
---
I'm also playing on Ps4 but my chameleon armor effect isn't working sometimes. Luckily my build doesn't fully rely on legendary effects to function.
---
Paper bags themselves will stay if you do this.. BUT everything inside is gone. You need to place things in a container for them to stay.
---
I tested this last night when transferring items between all my characters
---
For this new ‚Äòquest‚Äô the post office is just a location, there‚Äôs a note for ‚Äò999‚Äô under the counter. The PO Boxes are for the ‚ÄòCold Case‚Äô quest and are unrelated to the new one.
---
They have. Assaultron recall cards are literally a cap sink.
---
Love it!
---
Acid damage armed attacks. Nearby enemies also get acid damage. I guess it's like electrically charged in that aspect
---
I'm fine too.
---
Good here too!!  
---
I‚Äôm not saying I won‚Äôt crash here and there, but 99% of the time I have no problem at all.
---
Solar armor -  Regenerates Health for you and nearby teammates while your Health is above 60% 
---
Thorn armor -  Melee targets and melee attackers bleed. Harder to detect while sneaking. 
---
Strangler PA Armor - Adds acid damage to all armed attacks and makes nearby enemies take acid damage. 
---
Note that the Strangler is Power Armor and the other two are standard armor.
---
Also note that you have to do the vault raids once per day at all three difficulties to farm the plans and steel needed to get these. The plans drop from the mid and highest difficulties, steel drops from all three.
---
If you're solo and can‚Äôt find her, check behind the cabin where she originally spawned. In a group, someone may have launched the body with the killing blow. Use confused emote and run around in circles, maybe someone will point her out.
---
Super cool
---
Haven't had her disappear, but I have a very hard time finding her after she dies most times. She really blends in with the ground, especially the little bit of vegetation just below the fire
---
My armor is broken since this patch. I have to unequip and requip it when I reload to get the armor to work. It seems to be random too. Please fix this ASAP!!!!!
---
It‚Äôs pretty common for that quest, reason being a lot of corpses in the cell that turn to meat piles all at once.  Nia doesn‚Äôt disappear, her meat pile just goes to the spawn point.  It‚Äôs behind the cabin with the terminal, but sometimes will clip into the ground and be unlootable.  After hunting for that one star lvl 20 loot a couple times, you‚Äôll learn where it is.  Five scrip is five scrip.
---
&gt;sbs 
---
What's sbs?
---
Can you trade strangler PA armor
---
No, you can't trade or drop the plans or pieces.
---
probably bloodied or junkies build
---
im suspicious as imo a tesla isnt good for oneshotting even at higher levels but with the right equipment you can get really powerfull in pve very early on
---
i guess hes powerlevelling his altaccount
---
a combination of chems legendary effects and certain aid items can make your character really powerfull and the teslarifle is perfect for levelling as you can tag pretty much all enemies before higher levels kill them so my theory is that he provided his new character with
---
energy weapon bobbleheads
---
psycho
---
bloodied tesla
---
unyielding armor to stay sneaky
---
and some xp boosting items
---
and now hes just farming ghouls over and over to level up
---
They definitely dropped the ball by giving players that lost junk more vault steel than they‚Äôll use in their lifetime.  What a bunch of assholes.
---
Stealthboys
---
At least you‚Äôre getting a reply...my last few tickets have been completely ignored. As a loyal fan since Beta, this shit is getting old.
---
If you have right thats next think what dont work.... Dmg suppost be locked on 110 dmg...game never show me biggers numbers when i shot to other player
---
Yes I understand completely,  but Im saying that the game community is mostly not toxic. I've haven't ran into another player thats really toxic yet, and I've been playing for about 200 hours
---
There are so many bugs they can't fix, add, or come back after patching and you want to add the complexity of cross play? NTY.
---
I said it before and i will say it again, do NOT use the reddit market, its a huge scam where everything is at least 500% overpriced!
---
PS4 here. Armor bug doesn't effect me, but I've had trouble with the dailies not working the past 2 days. Haven't noticed any problem with stuff breaking.
---
I‚Äôd prefer an extension on the holiday event.  XP is easy, but I‚Äôm not going to be playing my main character or two alts until their armor works again.  Active event days until a hotfix will be wasted.
---
Nice ‚Äúproclaim‚Äù part. People aren‚Äôt lying you dumb idiot. The people who post about the bugs are the ones who play the game so take your conspiracy elsewhere numb nuts.
---
Flatwoods has less bushes I believe but certain areas like from the airport to the center have very little cover. The brown ones are the best but sparsely located.
---
Flexing that you‚Äôre a mongoloid. Bravo.
---
This is how they handle all their support tickets. With all the money they save on support personnel you would think they could spend more on development and testing.
---
Do you still get sleepers?
---
They mentioned that feature in a long list of QoL improvements they were aiming to release in early 2020.
---
You heard that from no one.
---
It isn't a Bethesda patch unless they break the game. 2 steps forward 3 steps back every damn time. They need to fire their whole QA department and restaff the whole damn thing at this point. This shit needs to stop happening every goddamn patch.
---
They have already announced it is coming months ago....next year some time. No idea why it is taking so long considering modders released this for PC within weeks of the game coming out.
---
Unlike the mods, when Bethesda finally does release it it will end up not working right and probably break all of your perk cards so they no longer even work lol
---
well ive had all kinds of new bugs, but not the legendary breaks ( for longer than a few seconds max then it resets)
---
ive had the game turning completely dark, weird soundeffects from events (like uranium fever or impostor sheepsquatch) dont stop playing in background till you log out, the framerate during queenfights is abismal and vaultraids impossible as well. 
---
its all manageable, others have it way worse but still how these differences in performance are even possible is beyond me
---
I‚Äôm sorry. I didn‚Äôt mean to offend you. I know I‚Äôm not a super hard core player (I‚Äôm only level 114 and put in like 300ish hours when others I know have done triple that) and I never said anyone was lying. I just haven‚Äôt experienced them yet.
---
Well thank you for sharing. I haven‚Äôt done the raid in awhile so I‚Äôll see if that is problematic for me.
---
I can't find it in my inventory.  Where is it?
---
I got my tokens last night. Did two dailies at Camden. No pop up or anything at the end of either but I did get my Mr Fuzzy tokens. Check your tokens and see. Hopefully you got yours.
---
Wouldn't that make it a good place to sell?
---
If your friend doesn't have fo1st then they don't care enough about it to help. Bethesda will only replace items when it affects their precious fallout 1st members.
---
Yeah, no.
---
Look, the update bringing breaks is crap but unplayable? Come on...
---
Maybe it‚Äôs my gear or level, but players either ignore me or try to challenge me.  Very little in between.  Every tryhard on the server wants to throw nuke mines at a lvl 350+ holding a fixer and wearing a leather coat and scout mask.  I‚Äôve started wearing power armor to vend.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of perfectly pleasant players, but also a lot of bored players out there with bad attitudes, and they tend to be the ones looking for attention.  They‚Äôre much more likely to spend a lot more time being rude and disruptive, and leaving racist holotape rants everywhere sounds like something that would gain traction.
---
I would gues both. HQ does not give a shit anymore. All they care for is how much money they can squeeze out of that turd. And Austin. Well i guess inexperienced people and probably understaffed.
---
I would really like to know a bit how those decisions are made within Bethesda...
---
I hope that is not after you put it back together...
---
5 bullets clip, reload, switch every armor piece off and on, repeat.
---
Someone drank their Hater-ade this morning.
---
Man, did you pick a wrong game as an entry point to Fallout franchise.
---
Don‚Äôt apologize to that fucking idiot. You didn‚Äôt do or say anything wrong he‚Äôs just a piece of shit.
---
It's most likely your lvl, because other high levels probably think you're bored too, since pvp really is the last thing to do in this game
---
Well thanks for saying that. I appreciate it!
---
I dont believe so. Those are spawns in a group and the tameables have to be specific to a random event single spawn.
---
Unless that has changed in the last few weeks.
---
I ran into a cat in the forest at one of the random spawn points a while ago, but I didnt want to lose my deathclaw so I passed on it.
---
Are you both on the same platform? If so, you should be able to send him a friend request in the social menu. Once you‚Äôre friends you can join each other on the same server and create a team.
---
They are probably working hard on a fix. Bethesda isn't choosing to not fix bugs. They aren't trying to sabotage their game. Get your head out of your ass
---
They are hostile if you go there to solely complain/shit on the game, rather than play/try and help others. Guessing there's a reason you had a bad experience.   
---
No idea how you can say this sub is relaxed, every 3rd post is a person talking about either how frustrated or arbitrarily mad they are about whatever flavor of the week. Its exhausting and literally the reason r/fo76FilthyCasuals exists.
---
Make deathclaw gauntlets.
---
To firmly progress at low levels, you need:
---
- good armor
---
- good weapon/s
---
- to focus on a build (melee, rifles, auto...) and to get all the needed peks for that build as soon they are available.
---
Forget about to search for stimpaks, radaway, food, water,  mats, cores‚Ä¶ all that loot will come as a side effect of killing mobs, clearing areas and looting them, visting vendors‚Ä¶
---
When you are strong enough to handle the easy low level areas (lvl 10-20) like Grafton, New Gwad, Helvetia‚Ä¶ you will swim in resources, if you take the time and effort to properly loot the places after to clear them.
---
PC? In any case, I can pass you some level 15 gear to make your character more competitive if you want.
---
I'm sure insulting the devs and making a post that's entirely a title will *totally* get you that fix.
---
Haha, that was a good one.
---
Good to sell, but not to buy. Also most on the trade page only want top tier rare pieces. Not 99% of common drops
---
If anyone is on PC and wants some good, friendly PvP feel free to shoot me a message on reddit. I enjoy some good ol fashioned honest fighting and am happy to find people that do the same.
---
Make death law gauntlets
---
Clearly, PS4 is the superior gaming platform for 76.
---
(I‚Äôm being facetious Xbox and OC gamers be kind to my reply box).
---
And yeah it‚Äôs running fine with me as well.
---
How max do you want to go? at some point it becomes moot, 1 shotting at 800 is the same as 1 shotting at 8k.  If you really want to go for it, you can do insane damage -  [https://imgur.com/a/ggiJMg5](https://imgur.com/a/ggiJMg5)
---
It starts with Market and ends with 76.
---
Do u need the plan or do you scrap them to make the plan
---
You're insane buddy. If you thought support would be able to fix your problem, you're purposely wasting both your time and the bots. Congrats.
---
Yes?
---
PS4 also, my chameleon is definitely broken.  
---
Also my .50 cal breaks after 500 bullets (first repaired with improved repair kit)
---
haven't tested the unyielding yet because it would be unplayable (I need the strength for the carry weight)
---
For me it hit when I was at like 8500. It does factor in other characters and you don't need to have it all on you.  In the early days of the game I was saving almost every cap to get that achievement.
---
I didnt say this sub was relaxed I said there are chill people here as well is all I was saying.  
---
I bad experiences there for other reasons so your guesses are wrong.  Im done talking about it to.
---
Flatwoods actually has more bushes. They are everywhere.
---
It‚Äôs not overpriced at all.  It‚Äôs what two people will pay for an item in a free market.   
---
PS: If you are selling god roll items on the PC for 80% lower than on Reddit, I‚Äôm buying!  I‚Äôll buy every single one.
---
Right just because a update breaks other things a bunch of  people deserve to loose jobs right before Christmas? 
---
Get over yourself its a VIDEO GAME. This happens every patch one thing or another breaks either get use to it and patiently wait like most of us to fix it or leave 
---
Merry Christmas
---
&gt; No fallout1st
---
what?
---
You can only scrap weapons to get mods for it, not the plan for the actual weapon itself
---
This is exactly why I am asking :)
---
It would be difficult but amazing if the suggested price actually updated to an average of latest rates sold by players, a lot to ask but would be so useful.
---
I had the perk for a month before I realized I needed to hit a button to get the extra search in the medical containers.  
---
Make sure you are using the Search! u/Jda4190
---
I know, that‚Äôs the whole reason you can even get to the terminal outside
---
It's a recipe to the extremely rare Deathclaw Gauntlet plan. You can only find said plan, can't but it from a vendor.
---
Don‚Äôt mention it. I‚Äôm not having many issues myself, only thing I got hit with the was the Liberty Prime PA bug where the voice lines overlap and hinders the performance a little bit. I can understand why a lot of people are pissed off and rightly so, but it‚Äôs no excuse to act and treat people like that.
---
Imagine being this entitled and full of impotent rage that you'd make a post like the OP did. Incredible.
---
What are ‚Äúmats‚Äù?
---
where would you suggest instead?
---
Get prime receiver plan for a .45 weapon from SBQ, then craft at tinker workbench like any other ammo
---
Most of the time I jump around player vendors to find good items to buy. You would be shocked what people sell cheap. I've found a ton of good QE, B/FFR and B/SS items for less than 3-4k. On the trade page some of them would go for 15k or great trades
---
pvp in this game requires to be invested in it
---
no matter how well youre doing in pve youll get wrecked in pvp if you are not specialised in fighting players
---
your dr and therefore your powerarmor isnt really usefull as there is a damage cap a player can deal in one shot against another player (110)
---
and this damage can easily be achieved with good legendary effects such as bloodied or junkies
---
your best defense against attacks from other players isnt DR but rather perks and effects that reduce damage by a certain percentage like dodgy, sentinel effects serendipidy and so on
---
also unless both players are equipped with the best legendary armor and have all the necessary pvp effects, pvp will most likely be very onesided and usually the attacker wins
---
overall id say dont waste time with pvp unless you really invest in it it doesnt really require skill in most cases
---
Do you know where to find it
---
It ‚Äúliterally‚Äù is not
---
We don't have, or plan to, have a fallout1st sub. Plain old public servers...
---
Bethesda has never been able to fully fix their single player open world games so they're certainly not going to fully fix Fallout 76. What they need to do is allow mods so modders can make patches that actually work just like their other games.
---
You have to find it.  Safes in the Lewisburg cemetery are your best shot.
---
Ok thx
---
Until they fix the bug you are better off just taking the skin off. No way to mute the voice.
---
Im not raging though.. ? I‚Äôm enjoying the game &amp; having fun. I find rather sad and disgusting that people think others should loose a job over a video game because ‚Äúits broken‚Äù
---
Does Bethesds even do hotfixes? I swore they only did full patches.

---
Yeah, most of the masks make you look like a goon from Batman
---
Community managers already said the team is looking into it. They have no reason not to fix it asap (which is literally what they said they are doing).  
---
This post is both hyperbolic and impatient. I'm not saying its good, but the game is entirely playable without legendary effects. Obviously we want a fix soon but this post isn't helpful or enjoyable for anyone.

Oh yea, paying 80000 EIGHTY THOUSEND caps and needing like 3 characters for a BE handmade is totally normal, i forgot.
---
Well I‚Äôm an idiot lmao sorry üíô
---
You get it from one of the Flatwoods quests.  By the time you hit level 5 you should have the plan, if you did the early quests in Flatwoods. I did it just yesterday.
---
oh thats fair, just thought you were saying that you wouldn't play with fallout 1st players haha.
---
Me too lol. I remember taking some kind of acid damage or whatever they spit out, turning around and being disgusted.
---
Probably not. Better people than me just end up dying on a bigger mapüòÅ.
---
The problem is...people PAY for this game. There have been bugs and glitches that have been around since day one and they have not fixed them. Is it around Christmas? Yes. But that does not reduce the accountability that needs to be put on developers to quit rushing updates. Oooo we got a Santa bot, but the update fucked our armor stats. 
---
We STILL have trade glitch, our armor is hurting due to finally ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the +250 DWR but they couldn‚Äôt even test that!!! 
---
If these people worked for Toyota they would be shut down! 
---
‚ÄúOh we fixed yer windshield wiper motor but when you turn it on your radio is turned to XM Radio but only works from 330pm - 3:45pm and it‚Äôs the Chinese Business Channel AND don‚Äôt forget that if you hit the brakes your trunk open and your seat belts unfasten‚Äù.
---
And yes, it is JUST A VIDEO GAME, but it‚Äôs also a DEVELOPERS JOB that by now, quit releasing stuff if you have not tested it. QUALITY ASSURANCE.
---
I assume you have a job, if your work performance with lacking would your boss keep you just because it‚Äôs around the holidays? I‚Äôm not saying to fire people, I‚Äôm not in that role at Beth but it‚Äôs time to quit releasing untested bullshit. ACCOUNTABILITY. 
---
I would love to know how many people left FO76 for OutWorld for whatever it‚Äôs called.
---
Gamers would be MUCH more understanding and responsive to honesty. If they told us, we need to take more time developing a patch/update to make it right, people would understand. Just communicate with the community!
---
There‚Äôs one tactic I‚Äôve never seen anyone else use but me &amp; it works wonderfully! I don‚Äôt know wether to share or not cause you all will start looking haha
---
I would love to work for you.
---
On Xbox myself but I haven't experienced any issues since the patch. However when I heard about the reloading bug I've been using my DCG only lol. But yeah no issues, only crashed once so far and that was during nuclear winter on an already unstable game (lots of people had disconnected before me)
---
well im glad it works for some people at least, maybe someday we will all get to enjoy to play the game as it was intended :)
---
ps: arktos raid is definitely improved, was  able to finish it for first time w/o crash or such lag that i gave up :)
---
I recently paid 80K caps fora 3* B25 Fixer.  Totally worth it.  Caps are seriously easy to earn in this game, so I‚Äôm happy to spend them.  I make up to 100K a day selling stuff, so it isn‚Äôt a big deal.  It sounds to me that you just haven‚Äôt figured out how to work the economy to your advantage yet.  
---
The biggest problem to me is the cap limit.  I have issues because all 3 of my accounts (15 characters) get near the cap limit, and I have to go on spending sprees so I can continue selling in my in-game stores.
---
If you are referring to the bug where it would remove displayed items for crafting needs then yes, that is fixed.
---
üò•
---
im just using the helmet with other pa skins. its the helmet. some say torso gives voice as well havent tested that.
---
The response is from a cognitive engine, its just gone over the messages and looked at key words and bioler plated a reply.  A very poorly structured reply.  Will play another round of yhe game of disappointment with it and see.  
---
Starting to think of a refund for all i spent on tbe game.
---
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúquest‚Äù per se. But if you go to grafton pawn shop you will notice some clues to investigate
---
&lt;&lt;Insert "why not both" meme here&gt;&gt;
---
everytime you reload the powerarmor acts as if you just entered it, with the lines "libertyprime online" or similar
---
Went to bed...
---
I'm only wearing two arms, leather unyielding, right arm stuck at about 60% and left about 160% health, must be special indestructible armor.
---
Ok, got online this morning...and you're correct, it's not a quad...thought it was because the barrel looks like it has 4 chambers. Im trying to post a pic now.
---
They do hotfixes for serious issues they are able to fix quickly
---
So what are you doing now?
---
yeah, but, which option is stronger?
---
is it a new location ?
---
Not even heard of this new stuff, I'll go check out Grafton.
---
How the F do we post pics now??? Anyone have a hint that I'm missing?
---
I‚Äôve been soloing standard DitW with a t-51/heavy build using a b/ffr 50 cal.  1/2 health just to allow for poison damage.  I use an explosive shotgun with Enforcer to kneecap everything in the reactor and most of the trash at the end.
---
I skip Meltdown.
---
I use a bloody rifleman and commando in Washout.  Easy on novice, but I don‚Äôt think it can be soloed.
---
And what would happen if you store your acid component in the stash box instead of the recycler ? I guess the crafting would take the component before recycling the bug parts, right ?
---
They game is absolutely playable without legendary effects in end game. I played last night, ran a silo like normal. If you can‚Äôt play without legendary effects on armor you‚Äôre doing something wrong. 
---
Yes it needs to be fixed but it ‚Äúliterally‚Äù still is playable.
---
For Halloween. Themed Armor skin, weapon skins, outfit
---
For Christmas. 3 camp objects, a armor skin, weapon skin, outfit
---
Nuclear winter itself has its own reward list full of many weapon skins, many power armor paints, some costumes, some camp items, icons, photo frames and the final reward is a paint to turn your power armor into a brand new type (hellfire power armor)
---
Helllll yeahhhh
---
My weightless armor is not working and weighs the original amount and weapon durability at least for explosive weapons are reduced by at least half. My explosive harpoon gun last a recorded 8 shots at 200%.
---
This!
---
I mean I literally am afraid to buy the new xmas vendor because I dont want to spend another hour repricing my stuff
---
I lost the contents of one of my mules a couple of months ago (my ENTIRE armor collection starting since BETA).  They told me the same thing.
---
It pretty much killed my desire to keep playing.
---
Weird I played it for a few hours last night with no problems. Completely playable for me.
---
Levels mean nothing, only gear. AA, Two Shot, Explosive, and Bloodied are common in PVP (so many more perks to consider). Armor would be effects like Unyielding, Cavalier, Sentinel, or Assassin's. Concentrated Fire 3 alone is your death bed.
---
A pure PVP build takes investment and once it's perfected it's deadly.
---
A great refreshing fruit flavor üòú
---
Yeah, my unyeilding armor issue is maddening. My whole build is pretty screwed right now. But, this is just an easter egg for Wastelanders.  They did the same thing leading up to Nuclear winters release. I enjoyed it because I enjoy the easter eggs.
---
Killed there yesterday minutes after the defence event started, I just relogged the game into Fallout 1st, I forgot I was in Adventure mode LOL.
---
Umm, the Unreal engine is 21 years old, so your logic doesn't make sense.  Engine 1 is so old, so they should switch to an even older engine?
---
The reality is the age is irrelevant, it just depends on how they update it.  Windows is what, 40 years old, technically?
---
Luckyyyyy.
---
This guy plays the game like 10 hours a day and gets his panties in a bunch when people say negative things about it. Been doing it for months. He's completly dismissive about other's opinions but somehow thinks his are important. Just ignore
---
I hope so.
---
So leaving the rest of it on and removing the helmet/torso should remove the voice? I‚Äôll have to try it.
---
Look, gamers are often toxic, I get it. But in what universe has Bethesda not earned EVERY bit of this.
---
Yes I've done it a couple of times now without issue. Never with npaper bags thankfully according to everyone.
---
Not really, remember that developing is a language builded on different and often indipendent parts. The progress is saved on different files and used in a different part of the main developing text. Rollback of developing is not like windows rollback... XD
---
[I am Groot](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RMdIx228dBw)
---
Sigh - it was my first üò¢
---
Aaaah it‚Äôs the room above the chemistry room
---
No. I just know what the word ‚Äúliterally means‚Äù
---
Two.  One all in good fun with a legit PVP where we both died a few times, and one that I teamed for with a friend to help out.
---
It still ‚Äúliterally‚Äù is playable.
---
Interesting facts about me my internet friend. Did not even know this stuff before. Tank you for letting me know
---
I love buying the themed vendors and switching out or rebuilding my camp so it gets so tiring. I‚Äôll spend an hour rebuilding and then like you said another hour pricing and it wouldn‚Äôt be near as bad. Maybe they do it to keep it even with console but I have a keyboard damnit, let me use it!
---
Yeh, you're right üòÇ
---
Yes in that they‚Äôve added an instanced interior that‚Äôs the start of a mystery quest. All the details are on a thread here or juiceheads youtubes
---
Santatron‚Äôs lines are goddamn hilarious
---
100% random. Tier 3 Safes have a chance to spawn weapon plans an is the only place I've seen it spawn.
---
Then why don't u use It
---
Haven't played since the update, mainly because of all of the posts warning about this.
---
In the meantime, however, can I get a clarification on what 250drwr means? I'm not savvy on a lot of the acronyms being used on this forum.
---
See, I'm a Bloodied/Bolstering build, but haven't been going in bloodied. I've been running a melee/heavy gunner build in there, just not with my normal strength for melee. The shotgun sounds good. I have a TSE I might try.
---
You sly dog. Haha.
---
Plenty more to come, don't worry about it.
---
The only instance I recall of a quick fix was the like 1GB update after First launch. Guess they just don't list hotfixes in the weekly update post.
---
None of them, personally me and my crew will find and hunt all bush campers with no mercy. Just letting you know, JOSSISDEAD finds you and it will be a quick thirsty death.
---
YES.
---
No - Democracy never rests!
---
Puppet show, obviously.
---
Yeah good luck with that buddy...
---
Yea you won‚Äôt find them there. You will find them listed in the forums I think. They have done several that I can recall. My console updates automatically so I don‚Äôt notice most of the time. Most recent one was a few weeks ago.
---
You're fighting a losing battle. Theres so many people in the world who don't have any identity other than money and gaming. Fallout is very much an 'identity' now with the massive expansions to the merch and fashionable Fallout wear. Bethesda are trying to build a cult of personality.
---
The voice comes from both torso and helmet, if you have either equipped, it will talk. What this new bug does, is (I think) that after *every* reload activates both torso and helmet, twice..? I just know it talks way, way too much now.
---
I'm over 25 but I never found yet
---
Umm but humans ARE a plague like literally a cancer on earth
---
It has nothing to do with tree hugging liberals
---
We ransack an area kill off the native species use all the resources and move on to the next place
---
It's a simple fact...
---
And once upon a time conservatives used to care about the environment...let's remember who started the EPA Republican Jesus himself...
---
They need to bring back survival so the edgy kids can screw back off there to ‚Äòpvp‚Äô. 
---
It‚Äôs pvp, right? The constant hopping up and down while trying to hit each other with obviously duped legacy weapons while wearing obviously duped pvp armor sets?
---
Nah, that nonsense can go somewhere else.
---
I us√© better sneaking, but really, I dont know how much affect
---
Save up overseer tickets and buy it then?
---
*You‚Äôre trash, and also OP, you‚Äôre trash.
---
I prefer the term scuba steve
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt like it. It makes you stand out so much and an easy target for my sniper rifle.
---
Lol. No Sir, your trash. Gtfo.
---
Hahaha, that's brilliant
---
Yes. Two of my unyielding pieces. 
---
I‚Äôm going to try re-equipping my power armor pieces tonight.
---
It‚Äôs been stated in the past you can continue into Wastelanders with your current characters, I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôd be locked out of the DLC whilst a new one who hasn‚Äôt inoculated themselves from the scorched plague could go ahead
---
There have been people whose camps have become inaccessible since an update that changed something like the cave in the upper right of the map. I would guess there will be some of this but also they will likely use existing structures which can't often be built on.
---
like it does in the game? :)
---
When Maxon‚Äôs Battlecoat came out for limited time I wanted to get it but I ended up missing out on it because I wasn‚Äôt able to get on during the time it was released. When I did finally get on, it was gone. I didn‚Äôt think to myself hey the coat is gone so I‚Äôm just gonna spend this money on something else because I feel the need to buy something else in hopes that me purchasing it would bring the fucking battle coat back.
---
If you‚Äôre hungry and craving a hamburger, you‚Äôre not gonna go buy a hot dog.
---
Just watch Oxhorn but increase the video speed to 1.5x or something... my GF does this with university lectures, lol.
---
Apologizes for the civil war that was created here lol...BUT pc needs to sort some things out on their game security and stability before i can appreciate pc cross over.
---
You're**. That is all
---
If you have one, shoot down.
---
In automicshop?
---
Or after you get it (the Santatron) click the keyboard and put the setting on Christmas gift!
---
Hope that helps?
---
That doesn‚Äôt answer my question, also that‚Äôs not what the scarcity principle is saying. Scarcity is essentially people will buy things that are in limited quantity or available for a limited time. It doesn‚Äôt apply to every purchase, but collective as a whole. You not buying one thing doesn‚Äôt disprove the macro impacts of their strategy.
---
Did a few more this morning. Pop up with rewards showed for stings &amp; things.  No pop up with rewards for two others. Thanks!
---
Well I know it does an insane amount of damage, but why is the bloodied variant so much sought after than the other variants?
---
Because it does insane amounts of damage
---
Explosive Energy weapons ignore armor as the explosive effect is dealt as an energy explosion instead of the normal explosive. This means that fireproof and/or dense torso mods do not actually work with its damage type, effectively making almost everything act as if it has 0 armor. THIS is why it was removed as a weapon not because it "thematically" doesn't make sense. It is also why I stopped using them as I would get myself liquefied during every SBQ by every pop up scorched that ran screaming into me, instead get a normal explosive or climb higher if you wanna use one of these bad boys.
---
Thanks!  Tried again this morning with mixed results regarding the notifications, but the rewards were indeed there.
---
And the bloody explosive doesn‚Äôt drop anymore.
---
there is a questline for building a set of PA; the PA station plan is a reward for completing the quest.
---
It can occasionally be found at a bot vendor, but IIRC, it is not cheap.  I'd buy the plans for the fusion generator before I bought the plans for a PA station.
---
Lesson of this thread: No need to waste 180gb.
---
Commie detected.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs a legacy weapon which no longer can be dropped or looted anymore so what‚Äôs out there is it.
---
Haha, guess I was mistaken.  Glad the rewards are showing in inventory though.  Didn‚Äôt think I saw them yesterday.
---
You know you havent lost anything... just go check the ITV
---
I'll usually give them the gun shooting emote. I have no interest in PvP but it's fun to mess around sometimes.
---
I'll have no interest in taking a workshop but I'll go to one just to mess with people. Hey it's boring out there sometimes. Have to have to m some harmless fun.
---
What about Nuclear Winter?
---
The new holiday event and Nuclear winter items were attached to the patch.  You can‚Äôt take out the bad bits and leave the rest.
---
They‚Äôre going to have to extract the 250 bug and everything it affected and re-patch.  Either that or just revert to p15 status and scrap the holiday event and Nuclear winter rewards for a future date.  Given the scope of the 250 bug, I don‚Äôt see how they could put a fix together in time for event start later today.
---
I don‚Äôt like the explosive energy weapons because they break too fast...I traded mine for a regular bloodied ex gat, it hardly ever breaks, and don‚Äôt have to reload every 5 seconds
---
Joining BoS is a multi-step process.  Goto camp mcclintock.
---
As mentioned by someone else, the firebreathers quest is another you'll need to do - its startpoint is somewhere in Charleston.
---
Have you explored Riverside Manor?
---
I dont really care about you, I just want the points, nothing more.
---
They'll just have to move. Sucks for some but Wastelanders is the future of this game &amp; isn't gunna stop so a few players can stay living where they do. It might be upsetting but most of us that have played for as long as we have are use to moving our camps periodically.
---
I see them for so much in camps to. It's a blah weapon to me. A basic bitch compared to some out there.
---
Not everybody goes and buys things just because they are limited time and might never get the chance to buy them again. What he‚Äôs saying is that they are losing money because they remove items from the shop that people actually do want to buy. Them removing it doesn‚Äôt make you want to go and buy a bunch of other things instead.
---
So what's the exchange rate on that? We may have a hustle my friend.
---
Yeah I was convinced I didn‚Äôt get anything until I check my scrip. It seems to be the same events/dailies that aren‚Äôt given a notification.
---
Is exactly what I'm doing
---
If you are on PC and need normal cores I'm sitting on almost 200
---
Keep in mind: to learn the bayonet mod you either have to salvage the mod for it or a bpr with this mod attached
---
Probably a bad idea to make a political joke.  The internet doesn‚Äôt have a sense of humor.
---
Good luck with that.
---
Attention everyone we he a tryhard superstud here.
---
You make money faster if you create a false sense of urgency to buy the product. Nothing ever goes away forever.
---
Lol no just don‚Äôt appreciate being blown away with an m79 after taking 10 mins to load in.
---
Yawn. Your the second. Again. Don‚Äôt care.
---
occasionally, when I'm wandering around low level areas.
---
I'll eventually wall mount it, but stash space and camp budget....
---
Did I say anything about winning? I don‚Äôt play to win. I want a good fight, gun fight the way a battle royal should be.
---
I think he's referring to the stock of goids you'd find at Walmart stock vs the stock of goods you'd find at a Seasonal product store.  Walmart will draw more customers back due to having a higher selection of goods available anytime.
---
Nope, although I have the perk, it does not guarantee a win. Won 0 times with it, I have around 15 wins without it!  
---
And I do fight a lot of people with the perk.
---
Are you ok? Have you really been so brainwashed by Gretta you can't even see the humor in this post?
---
thats a good point I didnt read the description
---
Use a gun and I‚Äôm happy. Just warning the bush campers, we out there and we see you.
---
Nevermind i did. Lol still my comment stands
---
Id be happy with a spiral staircase.....
---
lmao xD
---
If you read my replies to OP you would already know the answer
---
Exactly
---
It works with the mysterious savior so maybe.
---
Technically true
---
If it isn't an Atom Shop bug then dont expect a fix.
---
if there only was a tab for items you own :(
---
OOPS nevermind it was a plan not a mod. fixed
---
Too much ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Gotta say you sound like an ignorant ass complaining about an art team doing their job instead of being coders.  
---
Also, *NONE* of the issues you mentioned about consumables  making you unresponsive are actual issues with this update.  It sounds more like you have corrupted files and need to run a file repair.
---
I just noticed last night that my unyielding set isnt working.
---
What are the other new bugs?
---
Dont like it, its like fortnite.
---
Uhhh nothing...... 
---
(covers deathclaw hand collection with salon quality manicures)
---
Beauticians are lame.  I like guns. And trucks.
---
Because Bloodied Builds with all the synergies can do over 300% more damage.  The second best prefix Junkies, caps at 50%.  So would you rather do 300%+ more damage?  I would.  That said, the damage that any legacy GP does is pretty insane, so you don‚Äôt really need the extra 300%+ except on the SBQ and a few other long fights
---
Dude I dont care about you, I will sit still until I reach top 5 and suicide if it comes to it. Im not playing for your pleasure, I want points.
---
Agreed! Loved exploring this new interior.  Very well done.
---
Yeah, but you are probably doing 25% of the damage you used to do.  That might be worth the trade off to you, but you are giving up a TON of DPS. There is no weapon in the game that does nearly the damage of a BE GP.
---
Dude, we don‚Äôt care about you either. The fact your admitting to disconnecting highlights the trashy behaviour I‚Äôm on about.
---
This is pretty cool. Very creative!
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
Heart ache and woe!
---
Good news: 250 drwa is fixed
---
Bad news: When you reload, all primary armor effects break
---
I happy to report I did two of these events last night and got the rewards from the event and the SBQ
---
Unfortunately, you‚Äôre probably right.  The 250 bug is super deep and I can‚Äôt see how they can take care of it with any confidence.
---
Thanks for all the info. If you want to get the info out and find any new missions let me know I'll make more videos to get the word out and help
---
No problem. That's so strange that there's no definitive cause. Neither me or my friend k play with have had any issues with losing effects. I have however had weapon condition deteriorate extremely quick and I've had around 5 3* enemies drop no loot since the patch
---
I like to joke, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the highest damage Commando weapon in the game?‚Äù  Answer- ‚ÄúBE Gatling Plasma‚Äù. 
---
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the highest damage Shotgun in the game?‚Äù Answer- ‚ÄúBE Gatling Plasma‚Äù. 
---
Name any other gun, and you know the answer. Even with zero perk cards, it does INSANE damage.
---
U can always back track into morgantown, plans are in overseer cache.  That's what I did.
---
Honestly my fave weapon I have is my primed bloodied ex faster vats LMG, which does about the same damage as that glass rifle, LOVE that thing, and ultracite 308 is easy to make
---
I mean, they aren't wrong....
---
I like it way better than I ever liked fortnight (only played 2 matches so my sample size is small vs NW is off as I've played a lot of NW)
---
It's laughable how stupid they are when it comes to the atom shop. Over priced bundles, armors and skins which often don't appeal to the average player. Then you big events like Halloween and they wait until a few days before to include decorations and outfits. It's Christmas now and imo a smartly run store would be stacked with Xmas decorations and outfits not just a large tree and some lights üòë
---
The downvotes can attest to that.
---
Stingwing Barb, Radroach meat...where's the Bloodbug Proboscis?? IT'S RIGHT HERE YOU FUCKIN CUNT!!
---
Lose again did we? üòÇ
---
Vanguard and bolstering are also busted in the same way....
---
Always bro
---
Hope private servers roll around any year now and rip everything off the atom shop to let their players it for free.
---
Why would you need to delete a character just to play the new quests?
---
The simple reason for this: Fear Of Missing Out or FOMO 
---
Its one of the driving forces in microtransactions these days.
---
They should remove it and replace it with 50DR while aiming. They removed Double and kept Quad.
---
Great time to be melee!! No reload causing bug for me...
---
** By the way just take your armor off and put it back on after each reload cures it, though annoying AF. **
---
Semi-auto builds are miles behind anything automatic I'm sad to say
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Yep. I've sold stingwing barbs for 1258 or whatever they end up at before. A whole stack of like 6 of em...I mean, thanks, I like caps and all, but dude. I kinda needed those! lol
---
Every time you reload it does this, fix is unequip then equip.
---
Don't feel bad I've only got fertilizer from him too
---
Either that or the testers need sacking.
---
It‚Äôs time to get jolly on your naughty asses!
---
Damn. Tha k you for the offer but I'm on xbox. Have about 20 atm, after making 10 ult cores
---
I check it and see 6 coal, 1 each of 3 other junk things, and 20, yes 20 fertilizer. Its like man what did I do ?
---
Well I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had that experience. I‚Äôve had nothing but good, and every time I‚Äôve been around when a new person has come around it‚Äôs been nothing but welcoming, and nice.
---
That would explain why my camp budget is so bonked right now after trying to remove some items to put this new water fountain in I got.
---
I have the atom shop light bulbs set in my camp, and I had removed my work tables and some other stuff, and my budget was still too much to put anything down! I guess this is directly cause of the lights which SECRETLY had their budget increased haha.
---
Now I can't even put down what I had before cause my budget was over 100% without my knowing me, and I'm without the previous decorations I had before. That's some foul shit ya'll!    &gt; : (
---
According to google 23 Aus dollars is a little under 16 USD.
---
I‚Äôm aware of how to fix this. Either you didn‚Äôt read the entire post, or you focused solely on one aspect of it, and still missed the fact that I said I specifically unequip and re-equip my Second WT sorted unyielding piece, more specifically a Right Arm. 
---
I know the fix is simple, but I‚Äôve been reading people removing all armor to fix, whereas I‚Äôve fixed it with one slot, not five.
---
Hmm...
---
I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs so easy, but I wouldn‚Äôt care if the effect was done away with.  It‚Äôs been nothing but trouble.
---
Oh and the massive sword shape appearing in front of you view every time you crouch seems to be happening more for me. Never had it before the patch...
---
Many quests don't show completion. Several of my dailies yesterday showed no reward/completion screen after finishing the last objective. Did I get exp? Did I get stuff, and if so, what kind of stuff? No idea, because I didn't think to check every tab of my inventory and my exp numbers before and after every quest. 
---
My Vanguard's set is also busted like everyone else, but for some reason this quest thing irked me the most...
---
If you didnt care about me you wouldnt make a Reddit post about it. Have a nice game.
---
As a 'dedicated' player with 4 different accounts affected by the bugs introduced in patch 16 I sincerely hope that you are wrong in your educated guess and they do in fact hotfix the issues with a surprise maintenance today ala the one they did when the artillery box dupe 'exploded' (pun intended).
---
Arguably there is little I can do if they don't; is not like I have the capability to turn off the servers until that time when a fix is implemented and they can be safely brought back online, but I still sincerely hope that they go ahead an get it patched anyway.
---
I'm just goofin man. I understand the sentiment. Happens in all PvP type games unfortunately.
---
If you feel so butt hurt about my thread you didn‚Äôt have to comment. GG‚Äôs though fr.
---
Killing your character will solve this. This bug is so old it was in Skyrim. Ridiculous that we‚Äôre still dealing with it.
---
ManyATrueNerd made an interesting [video](https://youtu.be/FaoFH-S2FXE) talking about this and other shady tactics being used for the atom shop. 
---
I personally agree with what you‚Äôre saying, but unfortunately these tactics are working as timed sales and bundles are being snapped up by many players. I doubt it will change any time soon.
---
Yeah. The range on this thing is crap. I found another one that's higher level that isn't legendary and it does fine.
---
Im not butt Hurt at all... Ill get points, and you Will still have to find all those People... Im always winning Here.
---
I disagree on the different artists part - I think one consistent thread with all of the post-launch content is that the art side of things is very well done.  The VTU dorms were all meticulously detailed, as were the Van Lowe interior, Burrows, Arktos, and the Vault Raid.  The new pawn shop is no exception.  The art side of things earns its keep. üòã
---
If they left everything in the store there would be no push to pay for atoms. Why buy a 1400 bundle when You can grind for it for a couple weeks.
---
Sorry dude read your comment with the initial wave of trolls and took it a bit rah. I agree with you whole heartedly just expressing my feelings which is allowed on a 76 sub reddit
---
Almost every legendary effect isn't staying applied. When you reload or switch weapons, for some reason it wipes them off your character. You then have to re-equip them, but it only works again until you reload or weapon swap again. Occasionally during normal gameplay it will resolve itself, but then it will break again.
---
I'm just speculating, but I think they tried to fix the 250DR while reloading bug, by forcing your character to reevaluate it's stats and bonuses during each reload/weapon swap, but these bonuses and stats aren't persisting past this new "check". It might be they did it this way to also try and fix the God mode glitch, but again I'm just speculating.
---
Sounds like you got the pro strats. Well done.

We're all entitled to our opinions (even though the internet seems to think otherwise.) I'm just a smartass so dont mind me, lmao.
---
If you had the bulb letters they were moved to lights and take up more budget now.
---
Agreed it isn't necessary to be successful. The ability to run away from an unfavourable fight is just as valuable as jumping high. Maybe more so IMO.
---
Really??  Thats good news....  Im more interested in the XP.  Camden Yards amusement park dailys were giving me around 900xp per each.  Hopefully we are still getting that upon completion.... I am getting no splash screen at all when I complete them.
---
crapper perk best clerk! Andi though i  need to equip it each time, guess not, WASTE OF POINTS!
---
Yup, I'm early, damn. Guess I will go grind on another game for a bit

As you were smart ass ;-)

---
Hate how you said it but I can't disagree... PTS with the possibility to launch private world for testing personal fix.
---
I think in all likelihood, it's unfortunately not going to happen this week now that the free weekend is a little under 3 hours away from starting.  It's too big a risk.
---
It is disappointing that it didn't happen yesterday, or for that matter, that we didn't get any meaningful update on it either.
---
I haven't tried it yet. This is my first character since I just started playing about two weeks ago. So honestly I'm just now getting it kind of fleshed out to see what I want to do. I have a lot of strength and perception, but that's because while I was leveling I kind of had to keep a lot of different guns/weapons because I couldn't always afford ammo. 
---
I'm honestly considering moving towards a heavy weapon build, but if it's feasible I'd like to be able to switch out my perks for a melee build on occasion. Both seem to be STR heavy, which is why I thought that. 
---
That would have me move some PER towards luck or something else I imagine though. I just don't know yet.
---
That will just kill the franchise and they'll abandon 76. Since FO1st hit, we're getting monthly updates and more robust patches. I understand your logic but these holding companies are just looking to make money, not release fantastic products.
---
Not always.
---
I run vanguard, and I haven't had any issues.  Not sure what the differentiating factor is, but my DR display doesn't change.
---
Mostly what I've been fighting is scorchbeasts, so I'm not really getting hit physically much, so it could be the display is wrong, but that doesn't match what I've seen elsewhere.  So it at least seems like I'm not being affected.
---
I don't know what the max is, but you can have multiple characters.
---
I make my cap totals every day from vendors, but I can't seem to save much for some reason. All the plans I want are for guns now and they're 2500+, but this ridiculous cap max a day thing is killing me.
---
Oh wow so that's why, thanks Bethesda for this important feature.
---
Put the beam splitter on it and watch things disappear!
---
Agreed, they can remove it from the pool as they did with double, what to do about legacy ones is where the pickle is.
---
I'm sure the sub where people close their eyes and plug their ears is a great way to learn about the overall stability of the game.
---
Yea i already have and there are very few things that have a chance of surviving
---
Its a known bug. Please consider reading a few threads before posting.
---
If you're running a gatling gun and only have to do that every few minutes, that's one thing.  My handmade has 25 rounds, and I reload several times a minute.  That's a LOT of work.
---
Sorry, yeah I may have just focused after seeing so many similiar posts. Interesting eating may also cause it. Are you carnivore, herbivore, none, or prewar? Maybe anything that adds effects (like carnivore and glowing meat can cause this bug?)
---
So in other words, reading through your comments - everyone else is trash if they don't play the way you want. 
---
You sound like the kind of person who tries to quantify adventure/workshop PVP by saying people can't use stealthboys.
---
I bought a Vampires +10 Aim 90% RW Minigun from a vendor last night for 1000 caps. Happy to find what I considered a hell of a great deal, I checked the other maching, and found a lvl 35 Nocturnal Bash Damage 250DR Reload Gauss Rifle for 7000. Like...what? Are you high bro? LOL
---
Is there any build that is worth bash damage? Like with perks and everything? Are there legendary black powder rifles with it?
---
I hope so. Because they'll ruin their reputation for the free WE
---
:( yeah I may have a core hoarding problem XD starting to try and spread the wealth XD I have 200 reg and 60 ultracite (thank god for batteries included)
---
You can get by if you get your weight down to the point where you aren't relying on Unyielding's bonus to carry weight, then you can reload with some impunity, but there's no doubt that it's quite disruptive to normal gameplay.  Everything feels a bit off because you aren't getting things like your Agility and Perception boosts either.  My character is out of breath frequently now.
---
Wtf are you talking about.
---
All legendary armor and related weapons now stored in stash.
---
Currently in Hooded Rags, Berserker's Handmade Explosive and a suppressors death tambo. Different but simple, just avoiding the big stuff and looting like crazy.
---
All weapons
---
I really enjoy F76 but it's too bad the game has so many problems they can report on lol. For most youtubers you're right, Yong tea for example will embellish issues, but youtubers like Juicehead reports the good with the bad, it's just that there's more bad than good
---
Yes, it's situational and does help depending on your build. But with limited perk slots, I prefer damage to hit hard and be able to run longer.
---
Damn that‚Äôs scuffed asf üôÅ
---
As I said, I dont care, I want points, not stats.
---
Sounds like someone needs to go back to Fortnite with the other children.
---
It doesn't effect everyone, though it looks like it effects a pretty hefty percentage of the population.
---
I have the herbivore mutation full-effect without suppression or Class Freak (if that even affects Herbivore/Carnivore) and haven‚Äôt come across any food affecting my Unyielding set other than the one Wild Blackberry. 
---
Generally speaking, reloading my Handmade usually doesn‚Äôt cause the effect to be removed, only my Hunting Rifle causes it.
---
I have the herbivore mutation full-effect without suppression or Class Freak (if that even affects Herbivore/Carnivore) and haven‚Äôt come across any food affecting my Unyielding set other than the one Wild Blackberry.
---
It's already making headlines. Well there is not a month without 76 doing something funny. Just wait til this game hit Steam and Steam reviews :-) It will be fun to read.
---
You're\*
---
The god mode glitch with lasers is much worse than before. Me and a mate were mucking about yesterday and it was putting us or others in GM a lot in the space of an hour...
---
Both my builds either run vanguard or Unyielding so Since I herd I‚Äôve only been using melee on my bloodied and switched of my junkie build for a while.. 
---
Guess it‚Äôs smacky smacky life till it‚Äôs fixed üôÅ ugh I just finally got my junkie fixer and was excited to play with it üòë
---
I just wish I could transfer caps this easily.
---
PS4: Vanguard armour broken on weapon reloading, chameleon is fine and I seem to be eating through food like nobodies business
---
Doesn't affect my lever/handmade, but dies affect my 50cal
---
Mr Pebbles is the hero of the Cosmos!
---
Oh no. Are you on Xbox?
---
At most it'd crash your game probably. UI stuff seemed kinda unstable last I looked into them but if worried about ToS no ones gonna care to ban you for UI QoL mods. It's not like Bethesda will ever give us a proper PC UI so honestly, they don't deserve the right to complain.
---
Yeah haha I had over 300 Ultracite plasma cores at one point. Still would have a ton of not for the fucking drain glitch
---
The only ‚Äúgood‚Äù build I‚Äôve put together with bash damage (and by good I mean funny and limitedly effective) uses a bloodied minigun with bash damage and a shredding mod (the damage of the shredding mod is based on your bash damage). When you fire it with no ammo the shredder spins up + bloodied + bash damage legendary effect + bash damage perk card allows this thing to do massive damage. It can kill a SB or almost anything in a few seconds. It‚Äôs a lot of fun to use, but worthwhile? No. The minigun breaks super fast since it counts as being bashed against the enemy repeatedly.
---
Jingle Jangle lol. I forget if that song is on the game or not..
---
Such a bizarre bug. How does all this coding intertwine on seemingly unrelated things.
---
Thanks for the tag! We're aware of this and working on a fix.
---
Pretty sure theyre doin that as part of the event that starts Today
---
Ill have to check it put when im home.
---
Physical seems really broken... I‚Äôm now super squishy...  i tried a heavy non legendary set of combat and its no worse than a full heavy vanguards set...
---
Its like the effects just stop getting evaluated and it becomes non legendary.
---
I thought it was funny.  Hold still so I can hug you.

I re-logged and still get it...
---
I had that problem with the excavator armor too. I jope not cuz I finally bought most the good plans for the x01 armor
---
Honestly i just missed the bridge lol anytime the final few rings went there it was a crazy snipe-off between the people up top and the ones on the ground.
---
Interesting, I've run 90%+ handmade since the patch (with a small spattering of 10mm for trash).  I didn't check after the 10mm, I may need to check that tonight, but it's interesting that the handmade may not be triggering the effect.
---
For sure. Skeet shootin.
---
I ain‚Äôt no tree! :)
---
This is such a weird game.
---
This is what i've run into. MY JFFR fixer broke before i got through the White Spring. It was nuked so it took a few more bullets than normal, but i'd say i was able to take out 20 glowing fatties before it died on me. My armor seems to be ok though.
---
thank goodness someone‚Äôs enjoying it somehow
---
Ah a kindred soul!
---
I cant even remember where I found mine..
---
Sorry, it's the wood armor.
---
They were so useful before too! I‚Äôve relied on them for signs forever now
---
Ive been doing that. Its quite helpful.
---
Do challenges to unlock  extra overseer tickets. My brother and I both saved up enough to get it in only a day or 2
---
Ive been playing since beta, and i can say ive met maybe three or four people who were actually "toxic".
---
Most others were just annoying or didn't know how pvp worked.
---
Im on xbox sadly.
---
It's not but I wish it was
---
Yeah. And that was before they buffed the crafting ammount lol
---
Tell me about it. The next time a teddy bear gets snatched im going to lose my s***.
---
Wow you are correct, that's the amount of openings I would expect to see when spinning up a new IP.
---
Did you kill the character or just relog? Relogging doesn‚Äôt work, you have to die and respawn.
---
Do you mean plan, or are you going to eat them?  because I'd like to watch.
---
I don‚Äôt believe that entry was there yesterday when I checked so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty new
---
I dont own the dome structure.. but I may have to get it next time it comes through the atomic shop... that's great!
---
For some, it is affecting the handmade...very strange bug.
---
The only part of the patch that I would guess could cause it, is the 250drwa.  I'll need to check that perk on my guns.
---
Yes me too ahahah you can see all 3 mr fuzzy tokens for each camden quest, the aids too, so the exp too üòÇ no worries about, at least this is working ü§™
---
It does not effect my Vanguard armor, LMGs and Tesla weapons.
---
I read in another post that a person wasn't seeing this problem when using a handmade, which is what I generally run.  I'm wondering if the weapon you're using might come into play.
---
I was working on rebuilding my camp most of last nights session.  Santatron was the first thing I placed.
---
I got raw fertilizer, coal, couple of baseballs, basketball....don't remember what else.
---
I have to give credit to whomever wrote its dialog.  I laughed a lot.
---
Umm...should we be worried about Santatron. That's some pretty genocidal language right there.
---
If they of to hide your thrash and there thrash. Or something.
---
Not very good. I use the same q25 when I‚Äôm actually trying. What you need is a TS33. The extra Vats hit chance makes a world of difference
---
Your loose definition of cheating is a joke tbh.
---
Very few ppl have the adapters unlike the easy accessibility of memory modifying software on pc
---
Level 16 here in NW. Got my first two wins in the last 24 hours, don't have frog legs. Not a guaranteed win, you just have to be good/better than your opponents
---
Happening to everyone, not just that power armor. Do a quick check in the sub here
---
Sounds like his eco-terrorism program just kicked in. Next, he‚Äôll move a remote cabin, type a 400-page diatribe and start mailing ‚Äúspecial‚Äù packages to corporate lawyers.
---
Most online games that operate as a service have some sort of test realm or server so that their dedicated fan base can test their changes before they're rolled out to the masses.
---
I don't see how this is such a hard concept to grasp. You don't have to participate if you don't want to. But this would make the game an overall better experience for you as well.
---
Yeah.  I guess best case scenario is a new class of undesirable, broken legacies or destroying the third star.  Personally, I‚Äôd rather have a two star weapon than a big paperweight.
---
yes
---
I agree-but with that kind of mentality, the game becomes unbalanced and one sided. It‚Äôs okay for something to be a staple, but when you can‚Äôt get kills without it (this isn‚Äôt the case with everybody) that‚Äôs a problem. I don‚Äôt use it because I personally think it unbalances the game, but can still get wins. It‚Äôs just extremely difficult sometimes when players spam frog legs/have explosive perks/have a grenade launcher. Especially when you are up against a whole team of them.
---
Why not beam focus mod.  I would think that would be better than scatter shots esp. For sbq.
---
Yeah sure takes its time doesn‚Äôt it
---
Thanks for all the nice messages y'all.  
---
A tip for trying out stuff - take a workshop with a big open area, like here at the one by Tyler County fairgrounds - you can do some test builds and play around without messing up your actual camp, and you use the workshop's materials instead of your own.  
---
Happy Holidays!
---
*The Truth is out there!*
---
Mine definitely don't have it, I don't have a gun that has that effect at all.
---
SBQ. Its not affecting you?
---
I'll need to check all my drwa guns.
---
Especially when you‚Äôre over-encumbered :)
---
Running unyeilding armor and a combat rifle and its affecting me
---
Any new news on the hot fix? Can I log in and play now?
---
Yes, it did.
---
I never really used it because it was useless in that game, but i did sync my game to the app to get the pip-boy games on my phone and play them whenever.
---
I can't wait for it to be adapted to 76, it'd be extremely useful and cool.

How do you get the emote anyway?

I wasn't being passive aggressive. I was openly trolling you the 1st time for asking a question within its own answer. 
---
Then you did it again while trying to deflect from the pointlessness of your question by being a bit of a smartass while implying a direct statement from the developer wasn't good enough and cite a completely unrelated bug (which I personally think you are just parroting because it is the current hot topic, not because you've experienced it yourself) even though THE VERY 1ST REPLY to the quote of the developer statement was an actual player clearly explaining that it worked as advertised... So I trolled you again. 
---
Now once again you try and deflect from the pointlessness of your question by claiming 'you were asking for a friend...' which I find hilarious because I have never seen that statement used in a serious way. So here I am to troll you once more. In case you're new to the internet is just code for 'I'm too embarrassed to admit this stupid question is my own'. Which BTW does nothing to change the fact that you asked it within the context of its own answer. 
---
Finally you accuse me of passive aggression while attempting to play the victim card which is the very definition of passive aggressive. Google it. 
---
Let me be clear, if you had asked you a questions anywhere else other than within their own answer, I would have just answered your question and given you the benefit of the doubt and assumed you had not seen the answer. Welcome to Reddit.
---
The only guns I used while checking my DR were handmades, both have that.  I also used a 10mm, but wasn't looking at that point (and only fighting trash).
---
I didn't run SBQ yesterday, but I always do that in PA anyway.
---
We'll see how things go through the day, I can check with other guns tonight (though none with the 250DR effect).  I'm sure more details will be worked out while I'm at work though, so kep an eye out.
---
No, I don‚Äôt expect everyone to be a run and gunner. Just can‚Äôt stand the noob tubers and the bush campers get frustrating. Quantify? I don‚Äôt get your last comment. Sorry.
---
No.
---
Source: I make mods.  I use mods.  Just don't cheat and you won't be banned.
---
But ‚Äúgetting high ground‚Äù and an ‚Äúinitial reactionary dodge‚Äù is everything in NW, especially in Morgantown, where elevation is everything. It gives the player using it an incredible strategic edge-to the point where players can spam the jump button and literally dodge bullets. Even after the nerf there have been times where my teammates and I have been shooting at someone who is spamming the jump button and even though we should be hitting them they can just dodge the bullets. Frog legs is a great perk but let‚Äôs not minimize how ridiculously useful it is.
---
Ooh, when does that start?
---
Any word on the hot fix fixing the reload bug? I don‚Äôt even want to play the event until they do.
---
Alright cool, I‚Äôll have to check it out!
---
I haven't heard of any bugs yet, what's goin on
---
The one that took place two months ago...
---
Don‚Äôt play fortshite I‚Äôm afraid. Sounds like your returning back from there.
---
Artificial scarcity tricks our stupid monkey brains into buying garbage. We are being manipulated.
---
I watched that video yesterday, a very good review of how the atomic shop has changed since launch and the tricks they use to make people buy stuff.
---
They will not abandon game at this point. Too much money and resources were put into it already and the PR nightmare that will follow will hit their pockets real hard. Worst thing that can happen is that they silently put game on life support and it ain't gonna be much worse that what we have rn.
---
Here's a link to the mod that was mentioned: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148
---
lol what?! You being serious? Ahh just filter hot posts on this sub and scroll around. The biggest bug ever to hit this game was just introduced.
---
Worked for me but playing on pc made it somewhat useless because favorites were bound to the number row and that's a much more instinctive thing. I mostly would fire it up and put the phone in my pip boy and wear it. Cool but not super comfortable long term
---
Well damn, I will check it out
---
The odds of there being servers not hosted by Bethesda is extremely small.
---
Just got a boxing glove in my santatron so he is giving weapons now.
---
The goal isn't to sell items the goal is to sell atom. It's not the same model as e-commerce. By limiting availability they force players to purchase atoms rather than earn atoms in-game.
---
I beg to differ. But fair play bro. Sounds like you have your shit on lock. Leave my thread now if it offends you.
---
They are a bit crunchy, but pack a lot of Iron.
---
Ps4 here, and my uny specials break after reloading my 50cal.
---
Odd to watch.
---
LUL
---
They should just remove increased durability damage on Bash or add bayonet slot that remove it or something.
---
PlayStation
---
Yes. I was great for having the map open while attempting to travel a long distance and not go off course (or indoors) I didn't use it for much else though TBH
---
I agree.  In the interim, the one thing I did was found a junk node, built my camp close to it and mine that.  I have hundreds of screws now.  It did take a while though.
---
Huh, that's actually quite a valuable and unexpected insight; thanks for that.
---
Shredder miniguns without ammo
---
Thank you for the info friend!
---
That‚Äôs the worst time ever when needing 2 drop some weight
---
I think so. But that defeats the purpose of the scrapbox.
---
For me it didn‚Äôt pop up on the screen with the rewards (tokens) or the XP. I tested it on a couple of my characters with the same result. I will have to check again to see if it is just a notification glitch and it registered (received tokens and XP) or didn‚Äôt.
---
Oh. Lol. I thought there‚Äôd be an xmas version coming soon.
---
Thats RAW fertilizer. I flushed some this morning.
---
Im not offended at all, you are the one that sound offended by my survival tactic.
---
I had been wondering about that, myself.
---
It's the same concept as the beam splitter for the explosive laser rifles. It multiplies the damage per particle instead of splitting it among them. If you manually aim with the beam splitter it focuses all of those particles into a central area so it will do more damage. A lot more damage.
---
It does, just hold the 3rd person key and zoom in/out with left stick. Or middle click and mouse up/down on pc. You must be standing still.
---
First, you need a dethclaw gauntlet (loot or craft) then you need to buy a third claw mod. Then you can craft a DG with three claws.
---
On xbox you hold the menu button or what ever the one that let's you switch from 1st to 3rd person
---
I found a 3* executioner Grognak off a random ghoul and it's been my primary weapon ever since.
---
I just haven't been able to play much this quarter.
---
Sure sound's good. I just don't get it we are people really suggesting to paywall another "feature" in Fallout Worst? Why the hell do people keep encouraging Bethesda to do this kind of BS?
---
Another problem would be that the Fallout 1st member would be the people who are most pissed about the bugs. They pay every month. Not that the state of the game and broken patchs should be acceptable for people how possibly "only" paid once 60 bucks for the game. Therefore i don't think this would be a good idea. A public test server would be better.
---
I'm just tired of the shenanigans BGS pulls. I ran out nice things to say about them awhile ago...
---
Waaaait. I can zoom in and out in 3rd person?
---
That's good to know xD
---
Isn't there only one level??
---
Jumpers have a static arc, you can't change direction until you land. Aim at at their feet, where they're going to land, and you'll down them before they land.
---
Post nerf, and now that everyone but low levels has access to it, it's not the insane advantage it used to be.
---
On pc there's a mod that allow you to zoom out far away. It looks like an mmorpg bossraid camera view.
---
Limb Damage&gt;Bash damage.
---
Ah ok a mod. That explains a lot ^^
---
Games dead. I loved it, but its dead now
---
Nah. It's not a mod. But there's a mod that allows you to zoom out far more.
---
Don't you think we need 1000 more threads about it?
---
Lateral movements, cover, and strafing are more effective at dodging fire, than jumping. Especially against 2+ players.
---
You‚Äôre on the right track.  Generally speaking, heavy weapons builds don‚Äôt have much use for perception.  Instead they go with intelligence and luck, sometimes endurance if that‚Äôs a priority.  
---
Good luck with the build!   Hope you have as much fun as I‚Äôve had.
---
Agreed. They have really missed a trick in only supplying a bare tree and a string of lights for christmas decorations. I was expecting lots of items to decorate my camp as I do in real life but was very disappointed with their offering.
---
I remember the 1st time I did it, I tested it on a mirelurk queen.  I barely pulled the trigger and she disappeared lol
---
holy balls, was unaware. you rock sir
---
At lower levels, you can ignore Stimpacks. Build yourself a little Crap shack starter camp along the river. I recommend looking for a spot between the Mothman Museum and Sunshin Meadows farm, and sit on a junk pile.
---
From there you have access to some very useful things for your level. Bloodleaf being one of them, and Soot Flower. You can then craft some Healing Salves, which will work fine until you start getting a surplus of Stimpacks.
---
Also, throw down an extractor on the junk pile. This will passively collect scrap for you. You won't be rolling in tons, but every little bit helps. A few screws and springs here and there will help you maintain your weapons.
---
Also, run any of the public events in that general area as well. Free Range, Camp fire Tales, and whatever else may pop up.
---
The "Horde" events are another one that will pan out some Legendary gear as well.
---
That's been a thing since it's release a few days ago. That's not a special thing it gives lol.
---
Yeah I think in their attempt to fix all these things, they just ended up making it worse
---
Will it let you create R5, R4, R3, R2?
---
To expand on this answer, unlock but don't take anything out of the safes unless it has the DCG plan.  Once you remove something from container like a safe, it's 20 hours for you to see anything in it again.  If you don't get it, server hop and try it again.
---
Frog Legs isn't even that good after a couple jumps you get a cooldown before you can jump higher again.
---
Keep calm man, it's not hard concept to grasp if I just think different by you. As I said, they have a long list of tester and they're paid for do this.
---
Im...  not entirely sure to be honest lol I never looked
---
I'm assuming it will want to upgrade the higher rank cards, so if I made the r3 into r4 I'd end up having the same problem with it wanting to then turn the r4 into a r5
---
I'm not 100% on whether it applies to everything that's come to the store, but it appears that everything eventually gets cycled back and usually with an attached discount. If you can resist the initial temptation to buy, you can seemingly get it cheaper by waiting.
---
Wait until the circle closes between sutton and McClintock. That whole area is a single, giant bush.
---
You are right, but I feel that may be the repercussions of pushing wastelanders back and having to rejig the release schedule.
---
Maybe. But I don't think so. You can't have duplicates (2 r5).
---
&gt;It‚Äôs not the same model as e-commerce.
---
**eCommerce**: commercial transactions conducted electronically on the Internet.

---
Such a good map. I'm glad we have access to both now, rather than being locked to a single map.
---
That's what I was thinking, but I'm AFK.
---
Santatron couldn‚Äôt be places until I removed a bunch of stuff. Gonna have to rework my camp now. My camp isn‚Äôt even very big but I can‚Äôt use the rocket, airstream trailer thing, or greenhouse that I paid for. Granted I knew those took a bunch of space so I‚Äôm not complaining. I‚Äôve just gotta redo it so I can fit things.
---
*should've done testing* fixed it for you
---
Can confirm
---
You can zoom without a mod, it basically doubles or triples the distance.
---
Ya, I might of came off wrong too. I wasn't demanding you do tests for us to figure out why you wasn't getting the bug, sorry if I came off as such! 
---
I was just hoping to identity why you don't so I can look to mimic it and go back to enjoying a bloodied build! Thanks!
---
Gee thanksü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Artificial scarcity and FOMO works. People are easier to manipulate than you think.
---
Dude who gives a shit? Just adapt and counter them, you can easily tank teslas if you make an actual good build.
---
It affects all versions of this paint and Beth is [Aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8up80/liberty_prime_power_armor_is_broken_after_patch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Hm well if no one else knows for sure before I get back on I'll give it a shot. Think I've got like 40 banked lvls lol
---
Literally the first thing I did was go find jangles to display after they introduced the cases. It was an "of course bethesda would do this" moment...
---
I might have enough steel for another set. Let me check when I get home. I was one of the people that received the extra steel even though I had already crafted my armor
---
Yeah
---
Nah it's all good ;) actually on top of my head.. it could maybe be because people use either bloodied/junkie weapons? I'm only using medic therefore I don't have the greatest chance at testing that.. but I'll def try other things ;)
---
You still can. You don't *need* 20+ of every special. I have a full health commando and it's not so bad.
---
I don't think the game itself is worth that price right now, but it's your decision.
---
Yes, and it never hurts to have many more eyeballs on issues before rolling out to general public. I can guarantee you that their in-house test team are all running the exact same spec systems to run this game. That leaves out a ton of issues that won't be caught during testing because of the vast array of components that the general customer will be using.
---
Challenges for XP have always only counted base XP, before bonuses.
---
I run a full set of unyealding armor, an aae vats handmade and a aaffrrw handmade, and various bloody unarmed weapons, I have not seen an issue with the armor not working.
---
We are actively working to address the reload issue as soon as we possibly can. Currently, we are looking to revert the original Patch 16 change that was intended to fix the +250 Damage Resist While Reloading issue, which as some of you have already mentioned, is the source for this new bug. Today's Inside the Vault will also have information on this, and we will have more details to share on our timing for reverting the fix soon--likely today.

---
Once BGS felt the game was 'baked', they handed it off to a smaller 'maintenance' team to keep the game up and running.  I'm guessing a lot of issues are just beyond the smaller staff's capabilities (and budget).
---
The 1650 atoms alone makes it worth it. The scrap box alone makes it worth it. The survival tent alone makes it worth it. The private servers alone make it worth it. Put it all together it‚Äôs very worth it
---
You do realize that a well equipped level 75 is just as dangerous as a level 200+? 
---
I got into some PvP this morning and a level 105 took me down a couple of times and I‚Äôm close to level 300 with many god tier weapons.  
---
The good news is my opponent didn‚Äôt go Tesla or Stealth Boy mode (neither did I) but their teammate joined in the fray and that made it a bit more entertaining.
---
Really? Damn. I could have sworn that the Morgantown ones counted the double XP
---
She is somewhere. I used to look for her, but sometimes it is not worth the effort. She can be behind a cabin as a pile or still as a corpse. For a corpse, she is great at stealthing.
---
Yes, having an unlimited scrap container is fantastic. After the subscription ends, you can't add anything else to it though, you can just use what's there. I wish all crafting components were able to be placed inside, but the junk alone really helps with inventory management.
---
Like the other guy said though, the current state of the game is ridiculous; in an effort to fix some issues with legendary effects not working as intended, they've essentially broken the legendary effects completely.
---
Nice! We'll have double xp event for months!
---
That's up to you. 
---
Personally, I bought a month just for the armor and the atoms. Not a bad deal for 12 bucks. 
---
However, the whole private server and extra stash were whatever. It's up to you tho
---
I'm going based off of my personal experience, but I could be wrong, it's happened before.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it either 
---
I just don‚Äôt PvP at my camp for the obvious reasons
---
Unlikely, they will keep the bug till after New Years.
---
I'd tell ya, but then I'd have to nuke ya.
---
Remember they took a year to fix it and this is their fix.
---
does bash damage affect chainsaw?
---
This is false. The explosion is ballistic damage that's why an explosive variant next to any other will both day 75 energy damage, because the ballistic isn't being accounted for. I have tested this and fireproof and dense mod definitely help
---
It‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre getting cosmetics and ptw stuff, a lot of people on this sub have started defending it as if it is a good thing, however it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm live in the U.S., so I‚Äôm not sure how it translates where you live, but every 4 months that you have first, you‚Äôve bought the game again. So if you want to buy this game again over and over for no extra content, be my guest, but no, it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
I don't see why a big company like bethesta should get breaks on having game breaking bugs because they are "making another game"
---
Yes! Glad it wasn't just me!
---
Something about the interior seemed to just look.. clearer than the rest of the game? It looks really good even though we've seen that same kind of dilapidated interior many times before. Maybe because it's behind a loading screen they can make it look nicer?
---
I also find the same thing in outside parts of the Toxic Valley when it's sunny. The areas around the farms. It just looks better to me than other parts of the game and I'm not sure why.
---
Yeah, im hesitant to disagree with you, but it was a long time ago, so im not sure.
---
I still wish we had √ó2 though
---
Until everyone finds out the berserker effect is broken too! Lol
---
Bethesda sent them demanding payment
---
Yeah.. its been a couple of days and they haven‚Äôt even acknowledged it or annouced anything, if they leave that bug on for the holidays they fuck up real bad. The game is pretty much unplayable now.
---
Most definitely, but it‚Äôs pretty confirmed that Harold had been in the west coast for a long time
---
I have one of each number. Same with sneak and concentrated fire, and action boy. It adds variety and allows you to move a point here and there to try new things. For example, when you don't need extreme damage, you can go for three one star qol perks.
---
That is what i had learned too, even when workin in a sales position. They were always saying get them to buy when interested or excited cause if they think on it they will not buy. 
---
I, however, do think on thinks prior to purchase, the time constraint does not get me. They just loose a sale.
---
Hey look, it's some guy raging because he loses NW. That's weird... /s
---
Others have suggested it but have you considered changing that prefix to something else for the time being then re0introducing that later on when its in working order?
---
Shouldn't be too difficult to fire and then hire two people.
---
Alright, is its only r1 cards that stack? So I can make r1-5 just have to make 1 of each
---
Looks like im getting it then 
---
Thanks for the info
---
I have this happen a lot too, but only to camps in the bog and the mire, which are supposed to be high level areas so I can‚Äôt complain. Once it happened in the savage divide and I can‚Äôt say I was thrilled...
---
I've put in the time. Lvl 460, and my best drop ever was was a 2* lvl 35 be lever when I was around lvl 150.  Also, one man's junk etc...I've had to trade/buy  everything I have.
---
Crazy part we had other bugs that are selective on who it effects like the players who couldn't do mire dailies before being fixed middle of this year.
---
Except it isn't just legendary armor that's effected.  Weapon durability has tanked as well.
---
Then how will they charge for skins?
---
Are you talking about the Christmas rewards? Cause the halloween rewards are back until Monday to get, and double XP starts at 11 am EST today. Also the Christmas rewards are gonna be around for like, two weeks I think it was?
---
This doesn't make sense. Zenimax is more than just BGS games.
---
Flood the shop with lots of cheap stuff that people will buy atoms for.  I can earn a hundred per day.....but I want 3 things so I drop 5 bucks to get them.  Kind of the whole Dollar Store idea. VOLUME!!
---
Feel for the OP.   
---
Had the same thing happen, my scrap mule had over  14, 000 pounds of scrap collected since day one of the B.E.T.A.(perks and armor reducing it to 1,500 pounds).  He was moved by Bethesda during the PA ‚Äúfix‚Äù to a dangerous train station and of course promptly died when I logged in.   
---
Due to a change in how they handle ‚Äújunk‚Äù it failed to take into account perks and legendary effects and destroyed almost everything, including ‚ÄúJunk‚Äù that can‚Äôt be obtained any more.  
---
Placed a ticket, with details of the bug, how to reproduce it, the exact date and time of the occurrence and didn‚Äôt log that character in again.  
---
Was effectively told to pound sand as they lied and told me ‚Äúthere was no way to restore lost inventory like this‚Äù, weeks after the Vault raids fix was made public for those characters that got wiped.
---
They should add NW rewards to adventure the same time they add strangler heart plans &amp; materials to NW.
---
Where is your base?
---
I think you‚Äôre right, it was supposed to set you and enemies on fire, but with all the bugs related to characters becoming invulnerable due to dying while on fire or else being permanently on fire...they probably decided this wasn‚Äôt worth trying
---
FOMO. Fear of missing out.
---
Probably the speed of fire more than anything i guess...
---
Iv seen a few posts saying it works but who knows I‚Äôm working on using life saving and revenant also.
---
I won an Microsoft gift card on a contest, used it for 1st.   Its 1000x's worth it... pull weapons you never even see except on the market, pull things from the Purveyor that you would never get otherwise. Better graphics, faster load time, and unlimited junk.  I don't even need to have any junk on my character when hitting up benches anywhere...i guess it just pulls from the unlimited stash, there is no reason to keep any on you.
---
I like it but let's be clear I wouldn't purchase at this point with the patch 16 fiasco. also I am in the process of having to fight with bethesda as they have not sent me my atoms for the month, this is another concern to be aware of.
---
Died then re-logged...
---
I mean yes it adds up to ¬£100 a year but you don't need to keep it active to keep most of the benefits 
---
You keep the scrap box but can't deposit
---
You keep the oulfits
---
You keep the emotes 
---
You get ¬£18 worth of atoms
---
What's special about the Enclave and the Brotherhood: their flavour and attitude. It's not the gear that makes a knight, it's an individual's willpower and discipline
---
How has your power armor protected you against Rad Worms? It definitely doesn't for me, I need to equip perks to be immune to diseases. Why do you think that a suit of power armor would protect people from a plague when they might routinely take it off to sleep/wash/eat/use a crafting bench?
---
I'm sure there will be a mole-miner themed paint in the Atom Shop day. If this happens I hope that it doesn't bother players too badly as they run around in their Elder Maxon's Battlecoat fighting Swan the behemoth from Fallout 4 :-p
---
Fantastic now prime effect is fucked up as well?  
---
Good to know that 2 of my 5 best weapons are basically average now
---
this is incorrect, the value of the damage shown is 110, however the damage inflicted depends on the weapon, it can make you a oneshot and you will still see 110 on the screen
---
Bethesda knows these new players won't have legendary thus aren't effected.
---
Feel for you, more or less had the same thing happen.  
---
Regarding the Acid damage not working, it‚Äôs related to the ‚Äú250 DR while reloading‚Äù fix that was released in patch 16.0 and broke how the game is handling many things including Legendary armor effects.  
---
Hopefully it will be fixed soon
---
It will be a nuisance for some but I don't see any way around it? 
---
I would rather have new content and just move my CAMP than for the map to stay the same forever.
---
Short answer: It's a Legacy weapon that does good damage (Bloodied in general is one of the best Buffs in the game).
---
Reality answer: Good question, I had one and wasn't impressed for several reasons;
---
* BE &amp; BFFR 50 Cals and LMGs do more damage, (Mainly because of spin-up time &amp; accuracy)
---
* The issue with empty cores remaining in your inventory &amp; being repeatedly reloaded was intolerable.
---
* Accuracy is terrible, it's what I consider a "Spray and Pray" weapon.
---
* The DPS from my BFFR LMG far exceeds the Gatling Plasma.
---
I haven't tested anything, because that doesn't feel like playing. I just went hooded rags and unarmed. So far, no problems.
---
I suspect there could be a problem with stash weight and other things related to weight, because all my 5 stashes are full even when people buy stuff which SHOULD give me some free space. Like... I was at 800 and someone bought lots of gold and lead, plus some fluxes. Went to put some junk in the stash (I was right there) and it was still at 800. 
---
This game is an enigma.
---
You could consider it a badge of....well, something.  Sort of a, "Welcome to the Big Leagues!"  At least you got scorchbeasts.  That's kind of like going out in a blaze of glory.  So much better than cave crickets wrecking everything.  That's what leaves me feeling totaly defeated, lol.
---
Thats what I do: 500 per star for weapon, 400 per star for armor, unless they're hot items.
---
Did you switch TVs recently? I was playing on a smaller, older LCD and recently switched to a big 4k TV after wr upgraded the one in the living room, and MAN O MAN. The difference is amazing.
---
I got to "OHLALA" when I used the black light, so... XD
---
No man, I think the in game light is just better
---
Yes, that would definitely be nice.
---
I haven't noticed a difference personally, but maybe I wasn't looking for one.
---
I know, this is just a temporary workaround.... before starting to smelt ore, make sure you have 100 acids in the stash box. No need to store ALL your acid in the stash box.
---
Really happy to see this getting addressed ASAP and not linger like some past stuff
---
Why what happened to Explosives?
---
Could probably get the vault stairs to line right up to the greenhouse stairs as well. Would look kinda like big futuristic alien fold-up techno magic from movies.
---
I can see it happening once Bethesda eventually shuts down the Fallout 76 servers, but I agree that as long as 76 is online that this will probably never happen
---
I love it, though maybe you can attach some lights to the concrete sides of the greenhouse for engines?
---
Cool af!
---
Ahah
---
Did you sipped some NukaBomb ?
---
1sy does not give you an advantage on drops or graphics..and sry but you never needed to have any junk on you character before. Benches always pull from stash.
---
They still have some of the devs in the 'main' team in Maryland doing things like level design. 
---
We'll have to wait and see what Wastelanders actually ends up being but with the way they have talked about it, it certainly doesn't sound like something that would come from a game that's just in 'maintenance' mode.
---
&gt;the time constraint does not get me. They just loose a sale.
---
This \^ a thousand times. Their loss not mine if I don't buy anything.
---
Fuck scorchbeasts
---
Next christmas.
---
Latest patch, everything is in 8K now.......
---
The DCG Plan also dropped from events, and could be found in treasure digs previously, but I have not heard of anyone finding it that way for quite some time.
---
Much earlier in the game it was also possible to get the Plan for adding the Third Claw Mod, it was extremely rare, and seems to have disappeared at some point.
---
We need someone to make their own server source for the game. Kinda like FiveM in a way.
---
that's what I was thinking too, Im finishing Archer now ( not sure if that's what its called ) only have to repair my  crossbow once to finish it. Which one do you recommend as the second one ?
---
I'm using a Sony Surround Sound system with Dolby, I haven't noticed any issues, but mostly play with a headset.
---
Yea i used to have my camp in the mountain by whitesprings and had 2 show up often had 3 probably twice. I eventually just moved to the forest. Only have low level mole rats to deal with now.
---
How bout now...?
---
You're a savage beast. Takes me a while to kill a regular 50. I have good explosion/radiation resist, so usually don't get so beat up but three....and one was an 80.
---
Oh no....the gifts....
---
Sounds good
---
It it off for a couple days
---
They are fixing it so fast because it's the first new game breaking bug since people started giving them $13 a month. People are threatening to cancel that so they are invested in fixing it now.
---
Yeah, I'm not too far east of Whitesprings Station. I found this perfect little pond, scenery is awesome. Made a weird, modern-looking three level. They blew it to bits.
---
This is it exactly.
---
While I don't pay money for atoms, I've seen friends buy atoms so they can get an outfit they saw me wearing.  Leaves me feeling awkward.  Although I don't condone paying cash for atoms, I am a walking billboard for the atom store.  Hmmmm.
---
It works on the sink too I can confirm
---
I did the archer, hunter, and athlete.
---
In the real world you can just wait a week or so and buy it almost anywhere else and there's a hundred different options. In game there is one option and that is get it now or wait until who-knows-when to buy it. Maybe you're like me and fomo doesn't really bother you, but it works on most everyone else
---
Now where's that alien, so I can shoot him for the challenge.
---
Do they spawn as legendary now, or was this a horde leader?
---
Got a small holiday gift
---
What was the gift?
---
You can drop the frames with pieces on them. If you take it off the original frame your fucked am can‚Äôt put it back on, or scrap, drop
---
Yep. :)
---
I really dont know. I hate NW. It was fun for about a day and to have so many rewards tied to it is BS. Especially considering the insane amount of time the average player needs to put into it for those rewards.
---
I find the quirk is that there are some things that get Vaulted that really should just always be there.  Really basic stuff, like hardwood floors, the black shovel backpack, succulents - stuff that doesn't really go out of season and is versatile for any kind of setup.
---
Maybe the Vaulting works, but I have to believe the abuse of this tactic causes them to lose out on the potential sales that come from users who find a cool outfit or something neat at a CAMP and instinctively open the Atomic Shop to buy it, only to find it's not there.
---
I'm not sure how to open it lol.
---
Yeah I'm gonna scale back on PER soon. But for the time being I've needed all of my guns. Hopefully I can break that cycle soon. I really appreciate all of your help.
---
This holiday scorched was a 3 star. Not sure if all of them are.
---
Venders are selling wrapping paper... just boughts some
---
When you pickup the gift it gives you nothing, how do you open it?
---
Stop playing games with us. Open the f*%%*&amp;! gift!!! Try inspecting it?
---
I know not.
---
It‚Äôs under aid. I got two in Sutton. Both one star legendaries. One gift was a mounted fox head and the other pocketed raider chest armor plan.
---
Did it go on your inventory?
---
Same here. I was playing on my alt since he doesn't use legendary armor yet, but the nocturnal effect on my pipe revolver and the AA on my handmade weren't functioning all the time when they should have been.
---
Cant find my 2 small gifts.
---
this! we had constant fights in the last map. of course there were the standard solo bush chillers from game to game. but you could fight nearly all the time, even with 20 people on the map.
---
You‚Äôre selling those yes?
---
Yep! Holiday Scorched should now start appearing. Also, the presents they drop will be called Small, Medium, or Large Holiday Gift, and they will appear in the Aid section of your Pip-Boy once you loot them.
---
Lol and a Ho HO to you

This is fantastic!

My other PC crashes without any mods so...its worth it using mods.
---
What causes the intense ignoring of blast defense. I can pointblank an tse shotgun as much as I want, but my TSE energy rifle will 2 shot myself at the same range, even with high energy resistance.
---
Currently showing me servers are down
---
Yeah I would not miss the 250dr at all since it hasn't worked properly anyways.
---
this! agree with 1000%. its just so freaking frustrating.
---
and then there are games like rust with one of the best anti cheat software banning hundreds of hackers and showing their account names via twitter. this is how it should be done.
---
Re-un-delete-unfix-adding.
---
This is the biggest fuck up for sure.  The game is now unplayable.  It probably was before and I just wanted to see it differently
---
üòÇüëçüèª
---
Don‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth. 
---
Didn‚Äôt happen to me
---
It's like the upsidedown all over again
---
Bethesda has such a loyal and dedicated fanbase that they don't deserve. Anymore it feels like a skeleton crew works on fo76.
---
üòÖ
---
At least they're reverting part of the update, thank god.
---
Too true hopefully this revert works !
---
All I get is junk (I'm OK with this) and Coal.  Is that it?  What is coal for?  I keep thinking World of War Ships with the Coal.  LOL
---
There is small, holiday gift (medium), and large.
---
I once ran into a flock of three legendary scorchbeasts near the northernmost mutated glade in the Cranberry Bog. There's a random event spawn point nearby and a fissure site, so maybe that's how they all ended up there. My main weapon is a bloodied +10% aim damage Gauss Rifle, and the whole point of my build is to take down scorchbeasts quickly and efficiently; when the stars align, I can one-shot a level 80 scorchbeast.
---
So that was a good day.
---
They are not rolling back all of the patch. 
---
They said they are just rolling back the ‚Äú+250 DR‚Äù fix till they fix the reload issue.
---
 I got it for a month for the scrap box and thought it was worth it. I figure I've got enough for 2 or 3 months before i get it again. At least that was my plan before the latest patch fiasco. Makes it hard to want to play when they break more than they fix with nearly every patch.
---
And you sir recieved an upvote!
---
It was
---
Mine was full too lol
---
I have not noticed this and I use an explosive CR, explosive handmade and explosive double barrel
---
Nice info, thanks
---
Will the gifts that the stantatron can occasionally give be in the collection box or he will give it to us himself?
---
They don't exist, and if they did, you probably couldn't get 4 shots off without it breaking anyway.
---
I have an IE FR The Dragon, it does an insane amount of damage, but breaks in 3 shots from 150%, and 4 from 200%, even running Gunsmith level 5.
---
Yea. Hopefully they can figure it out. I've been lucky from what I can see I haven't been effected. Is it just Legendary weapons with the +250 DRWR. That seems to be the culprit
---
Interesting. I just ran collision course as well and got nothing. Did get one both in and outside of the airport though.
---
It‚Äôs really duPe V duPe, dumb af.
---
I've seen three SB at whitespring and two multiple times at the station. It's random and infrequent but it happens. They were most likely attacking something else in the area and your turrets got hit. I don't know exactly where you are, but there are four fissure sites South / East of WS.
---
Whether or not it is worth it is a subjective opinion. 
---
But just for the Atoms alone, it‚Äôs the lowest price bundle of cost per Atoms outside of the past Con Bundles. 
---
That part isn‚Äôt subjective. That‚Äôs simple fact. 
---
And the armor doesn‚Äôt break lore. That armor existed before the War.
---
I hate you for that but you get an Upvote
---
Have you considered playing something else for a change?
---
I'm just saying it's the worst that can happen, not that it's going to happen.
---
I mean, just broadly speaking, the art team has ALWAYS been great. The new enemy designs for 76 are awesome. Even going back to Fallout 4, nobody can complain that the new models for the creatures / monsters aren't fucking amazing. 
---
Bethesda's programming team is the only department that's shitting the bed.
---
I mean, how else will force you to play a gamemode that nobody asked but they did anyway.
---
Opened a few so far already got a new mounted head for opossum!!
---
Show me the box, what was in the box?!
---
Not supposed to be out yet that‚Äôs probably a reason
---
Yes i keep swapping weapons pretend I‚Äôm about to respond, and that triggers them to keep wasting ammo shooting air, it‚Äôs a real entertainment to watch stupidity.
---
I really appreciate you all who are doing the dirty work to test this stuff out.  Trying to figure out what was new in my inventory was making me go cross-eyed.  Thanks for the explanation!
---
Pretty much anywhere with scorched. I've gotten some in the are around fissure sites, Morgantown airport, Berkely springs, and summerville docks
---
How did that happen?
---
And you trust them to do it right? History begs to differ.
---
I noticed right away. I usually only hafta drink  a 3-5 times in an hour, and yester day I was downing 5-6 waters every 10 minutes.
---
See edited post above
---
Mine is still broke
---
Stockings is what I really want, that I can leave little stuffers in for camps I visit
---
Doesn't bother me tbh. I want to see more exclusive outfits and stuff in the game. Granted I want to see them tied to in game activities.
---
Yes!!  Going through water like crazy
---
Very nice tip, thank you!
---
As far as OP, few things compare to a bloody commando build. Low health and constantly battling your radiation level is a challenge, one wrong decision and you're dead. The rewards are great though, there's absolutely nothing you can't kill by yourself.
---
3 Scorchbeasts!? Grab me Railway Rifle and it be Scorchbeast for dinner!
---
And how much do you trust them to do it right?
---
You can downvote me out of spite, but the truth is that Fallout 76's bug list has gotten *longer* over time.
---
Lol some gift horse, I didn't even get the atoms...
---
Well, yes but there are no nails to cause damage when it breaks
---
I was going to say that I hope they fire the guy responsible for this fuck up, but then there wouldn't be any devs left.
---
Ouch. That's rough. Glad it was just a few dailys for me.
---
You've worked in ecommerce but have you worked in microtransactions?
---
Because those are a whole nother level of manipulation.
---
Who would believe that the community would be pleased to return to an old bug, these folks are simply incompetent.
---
Oküò¢üòÇ
---
they're not rolling back the patch as a whole?
---
you can be 99% sure something else is gonna break, then.
---
He wasn‚Äôt talking about you. He was talking about
---
These bugs are the nature of the engine being used. On the other side of that, there are no other engines that can provide the same experience. I can't remember a single Bethesda game that wasn't riddled with bugs, but the overall experience has always been a positive one.
---
To do the rollback? I think they'll manage that just fine. I'm just glad to see some public response and action. Part of me seriously thought there would be no ITV today and they would just roll with it.
---
Idiots they are
---
I agree with you 100% nor do I have a degree but I‚Äôm smart enough to have the same thought process as you. Also why make separate items for sale than up to months later bundle the same things along with a few things you didn‚Äôt want for double the atoms it‚Äôs actually worth?
---
Yeah, I'm having the same issue. I played for about 2 hours last night, not only did I go through 30 +/- razorgrain soups, I also used a dozen purified water. I do run speed demon, rarely use any chems aside from stimpaks, but it was noticeable.
---
Hopefully they drop legendary bear arms too :D
---
except they're not. it's essentially a new patch. they're only rolling back the 250DR portion.
---
and you can be sure other flags now rely on those changes. except they most definitely won't bother checking them.
---
Looks like this was mentioned before. Revert the change and get rid of the .250 DRWR. Change it it to DRWA or RW or whatever.
---
Ohh thanks for the tip, I'll try that now.
---
One of them is the Ranger Armor.
---
Level 1 legendaries actually retain a little.more value than you would think, people go nuts over them for alts. A full set of vangaurd makes you almost invincible.
---
The high quality paper at the lowest can be 1400 caps. Just throwing that out there.
---
One item lol every avid ‚Äòpvper‚Äô have a full set and knowingly take advantage of them against other players. Big difference than a foodbuild who bought a duped TSE in a vending machine and just wanted to makes his own life easier in PVE. Most pvpers won‚Äôt go to NW for honest pvp because without full set of duped shenanigans they don‚Äôt have a chance. No they don‚Äôt have to be dupers to be dishonest.
---
Yeah glad it‚Äôs not just me.
---
I did. I bought 2 Small, 2 Medium and 2 High. This is what I got:
---
\- Plasma Grenade Plan (this was the first thing I got lol)
---
\- Raider PA Torso Plan
---
\- Grognak's Axe Plan
---
\- Different taxidermy plans: Fox, Mirelurk Claw, Possum &amp; Mole Rat
---
\- Alcohol, coal and different kind of toys/junk items
---
The rollback hasn't happened yet.
---
The engine doesn't spout bugs by itself. People who have no idea about coding always blame the engine for this and that. The truth is that the devs are incompetent. Give them any engine and they'll still fuck it up. The kind of bugs they put it has nothing to do with what the engine does. The fact that they are janky with coding is evident when their patches revert old bugs, which is universally a symptom pathetic version control.
---
that's categorically untrue. any engine can be buggy or... not? it's up to the devs. in this case, they clearly don't care.
---
and even then, literally every past Bethesda game has proven that modders are clearly more competent than the people the source code.
---
Oh good point! I don‚Äôt have good perks for itü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
What do you do with the gift wrap?
---
I wouldn't doubt tbf but that might be a bug haha
---
When was this added?
---
It‚Äôs never that simple. Who knows what they removed before putting in the bugged new code.
---
I'm pretty sure the "fix" was just to force our characters to do soft "resets", but instead of reapplying the effects it just wipes them. That would explain what's going on, and if that's the case then it's a really easy thing to roll back.
---
Any good locations for farming this Christmas scorched? I went to glassed cavern few times. Nothing there
---
Not too mention that nifty unyielding and weight reduction armor.  Those go for big bucks on the trade sub.
---
They could just get another H1-B visa for another $9 an hour programmer from Pakistan.
---
We trusted them to fix: jetpacks, fast travel, *sentry bot looping sound*. They claimed to fix those months ago. Except that they didn't.
---
Definitely took notice
---
What is the gift wrap even do?  I was confused about that reading the article.
---
&gt;im borderline ready to vomit
---
lmao
---
lots of things in Fo76 are easy to fix. I could put out lots of fixes within minutes through a CK.
---
except that's never the case with the devs themselves.
---
Try Camden park. Or any other location with a lot of scorched, really. Fissure sites may be a good idea too.
---
Same, opened up a few mounted heads and some caps. This was along with the usual legendary items too.
---
I‚Äôve gotten all weapons so far but I‚Äôll keep an eye out for anything half decent!
---
Upvote for you sir, because this comment made me spit milk out of my nose.
---
Yes. It even procs from Mysterious Savior.
---
There is always a struggle every day in every household, business or enterprise between these two concerns.  How much do we spend in a thing we are trying to do.
---
The box I believe
---
Was thinking of fissure sites now, thanks
---
Yeah, as someone that spends a ton of time camp building, I wish we could revert back to the good ol days with stackable foundations, making stairs out of roofs, and functioning indoor planters. Almost every update has introduced more limitations to camp building by either patching building strategies/workarounds or increasing the budget cost of items.
---
I hope your nose is ok tho
---
Seems smart to me.
---
Do nukes work for this?
---
How did you read my post and respond with this irrelevant nonsense?
---
It has nothing to do with putting a 'skilled intern' to work on anything. The atom shop is *incredibly simple* to upkeep and therefore no problems with it should be expected in the first place. It's stupid and disingenuous to pretend that because the atom shop is working, Bethesda is putting more resources into it. 
---
And it's not about excusing the problems or causes of the problems. It's about explaining something so fundamentally simple a child should be able to understand. Maintaining an incredibly simple function is obviously easier than maintaining a very complex function.
---
It's almost like developers use testing branches for a reason.  
---
Well... Except Bethesda.
---
Thanks for the heads up on this!! üéÖ
---
Nah, not worth buying in mass and selling in the US.
---
Those are quite a few crazy assumptions.
---
Agreed, I was wondering about this. ...At least it has the *sort of* big boom after.
---
All areas with Scorched have a chance to spawn, up to 5 small and 1 large gift atm thanks to it.
---
Tyler Springs, Pleasant Valley, Big bend etc
---
Had you been running around for a while before you stumbled upon him or was he one of the first things you encountered while playing today? I‚Äôm tryna figure out how common they are
---
Found them at Morgan Town Airport, Bolton Greens, and Valley Galleria so far.
---
There's no point in doing limited time stuff. Folks certainly shouldn't feel pressured into buying either, especially when everything seems to be offered again in a month or so. Buy if you want, but it's worth waiting for sales.
---
Not arguing that it wasn't a half assed way to fix it, but it's the only thing I can think of that would cause such a generic issue. Also, given that the more complex a fix is, the more likely it is to conflict with something else, it would make sense that they would go for the simplest fix.
---
I think what's happening is a lack of communication. I think that each person is assigned one bug, and they fix and teat the fix independently of all.the other fixes, and then when they all get the green light, they just roll them out together without actually testing all of them in unison. I know the company is split into several subsections now, and that's the simplest, most logical answer I can come up with.
---
At some point I believe the whiskey took over and you might have passed out and dreamt most of this.  At least that's what happens to me.
---
Bethesda, Please for the love of Dogmeat test it first!
---
I had three in Collision Course.
---
Wasteland fruitcake? Aren‚Äôt those the ones with the rainbow flag icon? teehee
---
Those too! I have a full set if level 1-5 vanguard, and a 3 piece of same level unyielding. Also have a level 5 furious explosive laser rifle, level 1 AA pipe rifle, level 1 instigating bolt action, level 1 two shot bolt action. My alts have always had it easy üòÇ
---
Cheers! So how does the wrapping paper work exactly? You buy it from a vendor, then what? Thanks again!
---
Just found one in Camden wearing holiday jammies lol
---
Yes, only modus has them now
---
Cheers!! How do they work? HeHe
---
Only thing you get is access to something that does nothing yet. No loot, xp, rewards..
---
Their rep is already ruined.
---
Right. I haven't reloaded this fucking game 20 times today. Okay.
---
I doubt they removed anything, this game is just layers and layers of code slapped over code, and that's the reason half of these bugs exist in the first place. 
---
I'm also going off of the language used above, which seems to imply that it should be that simple.
---
I read your subject in the voice of Kramer‚Äî‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you tell me the name of the movie you want to see‚Äù
---
I found a legendary Santa Scorched at the entrance of Big Bend Tunnel
---
except that's not the simplest fix. it's unnecessarily complex and was obviously gonna break something. the simplest fix is also the proper one: looking into the 250DR effect itself.
---
and again, assuming that your second paragraph is right, it only backs what I said: if they're not rolling back the patch as a whole, then they're definitely gonna break something else, because ain't no one testing this rollback in "unison".
---
Well nowadays it's two steps forward,  three steps back most of the time.
---
Last spring and summer it was great. There was a lot  of medium and big changes, additions and events (camera, backpack, Faschnacht, scouts, cryptid quest, brewing, vending, displays, Meat Week, survival, nuclear winter, the burrows, Vault 94, et cetera) and yeah there was a bug here and there and a few questionable decisions but the forward momentum greatly outweighed the occasional setback. 
---
But the last few months it seems the progress has been minimal and the missteps have been maximized. Now that can be forgiven,  to a point, because of the upcoming Wastelanders content. (To. A. Point.) But when things keep getting broken and with each update bringing new and unexpected bugs and with every other ITV introducing an increasing number of less-than-consumer-friendly monetizing tactics (repair kits, scrap kits, refrigerators, collectrons, premium monthly membership) it is, on the whole, not a great time to be a Fallout 76 fan.
---
Don't get me wrong, 76 has one of the least toxic communities both in all of video gaming. Heck, that might be the only reason I still play regularly. But even the friendliest most positive gaming community out there isn't going to keep playing or recommend it to out friends when things seem to be getting worse before they get better. Especially if the community is worried things might not get better at all, or at least not for a very long time.
---
Yep, that's right... I guess they will turn it into a proper mission later. But it's strange they opened up the Pawn Shop and enable all of these "features". Whichever the case a lot of people have done it already...
---
Nope, this entire post is extremely misleading. They aren‚Äôt rolling back the whole patch. They‚Äôre rolling back the ‚Äò250 dmg resistance fix‚Äô until they can actually fix it
---
Welp fair enough but they just announced they‚Äôre doing exactly what I said they should do xD
---
It‚Äôs been out for an hour dude have some patience
---
Yeah, the nose is ok.   It would not have been had I been drinking pepsi instead.   Pepsi in the nose is painful.
---
So this dude Traps on this thread is straight lying?
---
I've been hitting fissure sites. I've got 1 santa scorched per site so far.
---
You obviously have your opinions, and I have mine. There's not much either of us can really say for sure.
---
No he means the datamined drop list
---

---
&gt;getting a bit worried
---
Don't. You have no control of it and don't know if it will even happen. If something happens in the future, fix it then. Devoting energy to worry about these kinds of things is wasteful.
---
Dang. Gave SBQ a larger inclination towards a better loot pool. Oh well. Thanks for the answer! Now for the long grind of buying recipes since I bought most everything else.
---
Thanks for putting this together. Do you need to collect the map pieces first before the packages show up at their respective locations?
---
Yeah, sucks!
---
Corpse eating fat berserker. And drink only blood!
---
I'm honestly not even sure what you're talking about?
---
I just want them to make a new engine. The engine used by fallout 76 is the same engine starfield and TES6 will be using. 
---
It‚Äôs fucking 20 years old. What a joke.
---
You've allready done the OP stuff.  If you want a challenge, it seems you would be steering away from OP????
---
What about a No-Legendaries build?  That sounds challenging.
---
Or a Mistress of Mystery build.  Use the dress, the backpack (armored and extra capacity), chamelion mutation, and the Fixer.  Would certainly be challenging.  Perhaps throw some Junkies on top of it for a kick.
---
Berserkers??  I've not seen anyone master that as a build.
---
Because it's easiest fix the fix
---
Same for food and drink , also lower on log in then normal
---
The mounted head?
---
If and this is a big IF.. if I am correct both the SBQ head mount and SB head mount are the only head mounts unobtainable from this event! 
---
Could use clarification as that is the news I have herd.. hopefully I am wrong!
---
I used to mod Fo4 extensively. I'm familiar with the CK. this is not an opinion.
---
Just seconding that you don't have anything to worry about as long as you're not cheating. It's also super easy to install them. Several game changers on the Nexus, have fun!
---
Just the primary legendary effect. Everything else still applies.
---
Thanks for replying!
---
Just wanted to provide a quick update/workaround: Upon reading suggestions from other players, I was about to restore my missing budget by changing the appearance of my concrete foundations from the default stone-looking top to another (dark laminate, in my case), then relogging.
---
u/Aten_Ra In case you find this relevant as well.
---
Yes it does, T-60 was given to the east coast and ranger armor to the west, no matter how you look at it, it breaks the lore.
---
When will it happen?
---
Yea and the first one I kill the body despawns
---
There's a new section in the tinker's workbench called gifts. You need 1 paper gift and 2 adhesive to craft them. When you craft one it goes to your aid tab (to open a gift you just need to use it like an aid item). Haven't found any Holiday Scorched yet, but I suppose the gifts they drop work exactly the same
---
PS: Forgot to say that gifts gave me caps too. Some of them gave me 25/50/100 caps
---
Damn
---
Uh, I think the order doesn't matter. I did the map fragments first though in case you can't see the packages first.
---
it is easy but bugged, the thing that worked for me was going straight in line to the last buoy and doing so you go out of the water for a short period but you can complete the test
---
If you try to stay in the water to bypass the buoy it will fail
---
Hope you can complete it with this tip
---
Have not had that one yet but mine launched like a rocket once, it was amusing
---
They're pretty common. I reckon as common as legendaries.
---
I've found 4 so far.
---
does each loc give you, at least clues, to the next loc.  ?
---
They say as soon as possible but haven't put a time on it. So who knows!
---
I was going to post it
---
This video has opened my eyes, and saddened me
---
So when is this supposed to be happening? Having to reload my armor ever time I reload my gun is a pain in the ass.
---
It was probably easier and less likely to bug the game to just put a Santa suit on scorched and add a loot box to the loot pool.
---
For starters - no fast travel.
---
Wow, thanks! So we can buy, wrap and give ourselves presents? Woop! HeHe. Can't believe you got the Plasma Grenade Plan! HaHa that's mega!
---
So far the only ones I have seen have been at events two out of 50 scorched
---
Yes, normal scorched spawns
---
I just got a mounted mole rat head plan from one at Bolton greens
---
It hasn't been happening with any of my weapons.  Lucky, I guess.
---
Was probably thinking what I was thinking.... saddles, mounting that crazy bat and dive bombing super mutants
---
Mine seems to not wanna go down stairs. It also doesn't go far
---
Nope.
---
The writing team is taking a crap as well
---
Thanks! So if I put on a set a vanilla heavy combat armor i won‚Äôt benefit from berserker then, since I‚Äôm too well protected?
---
That was the first image that came into my head, yes lol.
---
Yes, I had to equip inert flux that I had stashed
---
Been broken.
---
üôÑ "Trust me, I used to be an astronaut"
---
Heavy turrets of any kind can simply disappear when damaged and not reappear upon repairing.  They count against your budget in this state as well.  You have to delete the item they are on or move your base to reappear.  In my case, I'd have to move my base.  The piece of material the turret sits on is floating according to CAMP rules.
---
Im thinking you do need to find the map pieces first. Last night I found only one map piece, then went to the senators office and there was nothing to be found. I server hopped and even checked a private server and still nothing.
---
The main issue was ~Finding~ the small backpack ~Plans~ on my lv 127, when he did morgantown there wasn't plans for it in the overseer stash there. None of the videos I watched stated where to get That, they all only mentioned the pioneer camp, which I know about. Currently doing the tadpole stuff by watching InnovSurvivalist's video, love her vids over others, that accent = love it &gt;;D
---
Thanks for all the info ^_^;
---
that's not an argument. besides, you can verify that you're wrong yourself. just download Fo4 and the CK.
---
It‚Äôs not in the presents. It and the SB don‚Äôt drop from presents.
---
Thanks.  Play every day and hadn't noticed.
---
Yep. The go-to berserker's armor meta is legendary with sentinels or cavalier's in the 3rd slot and nothing that effects DR on the first. Let it break and then never unequip it.
---
I just ran Glassed Cavern and did find one. It's all RNG.
---
Hopefully I can snap up the robot armor plans and that ever elusive plasma grenade plan!  A bunch of the mounted heads would be nice as well.
---
The just shut down TESL. They would no doubt love to do the same here, now they've milked the players.
---
Camp rules were probably my least favorite thing they added to this game.
---
Yes the new update add that ‚ÄúEaster egg‚Äù
---
Mine seems to go really far to where I can‚Äôt even see it anymore
---
I didn't have time to read, there are like 20+ lore files from what I remember, each package will give you like 3-5 lore entries. So, it is possible that they give you clues, but since we don't know the exact order... I don't know how effective these clues could work here. Several creators already made guides, so yeh, I just gathered all the info from Reddit and then confirmed it myself by finding everything.
---
I‚Äôm on PC... same. I did the Shooting Range targets, Strange Brew and Ecological Balance... nothing giv‚Äôn
---
You missed the band wagon a few days ago mate
---
No idea. This was their official statement they just released in the lasted Inside The Vault that came out this morning.
---
Don't bother mate. There's gonna be a big expansion out start of next year so I would wait till that's been launched, also there's a massive bug right now  that means basicly all weapons are broken.
---
I have no idea what the gift wrap even does?  I didn't really see much of an explanation in the notes.
---
Yeah^ I had to search the interwebz harder than usual to find where to get the plans xD
---
That was me pointing out that you modding fallout 4 doesn't suddenly make you an expert.
---
reloading weapons seems to turn off legendary armor effects :(
---
11 gifts down and I can safely say yes, depends on rng mind you but yes most common at scorched areas
---
Hmmmmm.
---
i was skeptical at first about 76 too but i just gave it a chance and loved it from the start, also dont let others opinions hinder you from trying it out
---
Yeah, seems like every update it got worse for me..fought a SB yesterday and as I was running towards it...my life was just draining...I‚Äôm level 256...it was as if I didn‚Äôt have it on at all...
---
I don't understand, either. Like do they automatically unwrap soon as you get them? Or did I just get screwed over?
---
I bet its gonna be like purple power armor with a twitch logo or something lame like that.
---
Just explore the map at your leisure and talk to people. The game is so much more fun when you play with others.
---
I really dont like the sound of this. Surely nothing can go wrong....right?
---
So the same thing that‚Äôs happening to bloodied is happening to all of the armor effects...really 76...really?!
---
Some people don't like the look of it.
---
It's under the Misc tab. Haven't figured out how to use it yet either.
---
Id guess you need to use a tinkers bench to make presents with the wrap.
---
I havnt been able to get on yet, so cant confirm
---
Well damn...
---
With a bloodied build won‚Äôt you die constantly because your health is always so low? Seems like that would be aggravating.
---
Or an other missed chance was not to have deathclaws with Santa hats on ( Santa claws)
---
Or sheepsquatch with antlers and a red glowing nose
---
Go to tinkers make a gift
---
I have a counter built for my vending machines that uses the light up letters to spell out "Need Caps Buy Moar Junk N Stuff" I'm boned if I ever want to change anything at camp aren't I?
---
It's about target audience. They aren't trying to sell to the cost conscious consumer who grinds out the atom challenges to buy stuff with an occasional atom purchase to fill it out. They are marketing to the people with lots of disposable income who don't think twice about a purchase. For them it's all about the rush of the limited time and getting that shiny new thing to show off.
---
Also keeping all the items in the atom shop all the time isn't effective because the store will just become hard to navigate as they get full of items. There are certain things they should never take out of there like wallpapers, hair and some other stuff but having limited time cosmetics just keeps the store fresh and constantly updated instead of  looking like a grocery store with a ton of old content that never changes.
---
You craft the gift using the Tinker Workbench, then it will appear in your Aid Tab. You can use it yourself or give it to another player.
---
Its a shame ... even for bugthesta
---
Just scroll around or google youll find all the info you need about the glitches from last patch
---
Ha that‚Äôs good to know, thanks a bunch üëçüèª
---
Every single patch since launch several people get on reddit and swear that the hunger and/or dehydration feature had been tampered with to our detriment. It's just going to happen, like people complaining that someone killed them at a workshop.
---
Follow directions until you reach Flatwoods then go where your heart desires. Generally stick to the forest areas of the map in the beginning. Going too far south or too far east of the forest too soon will get you killed.
---
Don‚Äôt read this sub for starters.
---
This.
---
OP says it doesn't work and points to Fortnite even though Fortnite has made a *shitton* of money, and given that it's free to play, that's coming through the storefront.
---
I think it's a "Doesn't work on me" mentality combined with that old psychology effect where once you know something it's hard to imagine not knowing it. If I know to look out for this stuff, everyone else must know too, right? *Right?*
---
I found power armor dup that been working since launch
---
Thank you!! This worked
---
This worked! Thank you
---
I think you're confused. I'm confident I could fix the 250DR bug if I had access to a Fo76 CK, which is essentially the same tool used by the devs. I say this based on my experience with Fo4 and its multitude of bugs.
---
except they also have access to the source code on top of that. so if I, a literal nobody playing with sticks and stones, could fix it, why can't they?
---
do the same as with the others - go find stuff. tip - leave the vault, go right, pick up the bang bang, then go behind the vault and look for a little shack. A bat or something works better than a bang bang at this stage. Apart from that , no spoilers.
---
Gets beat, calls hacks. Nice
---
Yes, pretty much. Bethesda has changed alot of the required space that some items take from the camp budget, it's frustrating.
---
merry crashmas
---
So I've been looking for the Robot armor arms plans for a few weeks. Literally got it on my first present drop. Also have been getting a lot of prime receivers, but I have all of them already lol
---
Haha yeah. Didn't expect to get a plasma grenade plan in my first gift. I don't know if I was extremely lucky, but was a small gift if that helps
---
Too bad that I've actually got it some months ago, but can't complain hehe
---
Merry Christmas!!
---
Are you sure? The senator room is a sneaky one, the envelope is among the mess behind the desk.
---
Try an Outer Worlds character
---
Coal, as I deserve üôÑ
---
Got 2 so far. Small gifts. Dog head and mongrel head plans. Just click on the item in your inventory. A sound effect plays
---
I thought maybe it was so you could wrap presents and leave them out like we do with the paper bags.  Idk so I will just have to check it out when I get home. Lol
---
How much do they weigh? Wonder if it‚Äôs better to open them or leave them packaged until I make more room in my stash.
---
What armor are you using because almost every armor primary effect is broken when you reload a weapon. also weapon durability was decreased some if not all weapons. My harpoon gun can only shoot 8 times at 200% repair.
---
I'm seeing a lot of broken. I was in burrows for the test and stealth broke at the end by the gutzy. It seems to break a lot, no reason any action. Enough to where it's hooded rags
---
Apparently when you buy it from the vendor, you have to craft it at a tinker work bench, then it pops up under aid!
---
Nice!
---
http://imgur.com/a/NRnzpKv
---
More then welcome :)
---
Nice one bud!!
---
thank you. I hate being let by the nose, but also by having to resort to looking it up somewhere. (would'nt be the first time ). cheers
---
Other than Morgantown and Charleston where else do these things spawn...can‚Äôt remember
---
The prices are vendor for the wrapping paper vary. 1600/800/500 from high to low end quality paper.
---
Everyone who isn‚Äôt melee
---
Then you can either open it yourself or drop it as a gift for someone else? That makes sense!  Thanks for the heads up.
---
\+karma
---
That's totally false. The bug affects primarily armor. They are usable, but a few OP builds stop working. It's only affects people who has a meta build. In every game, people with meta gear are a minority. But they are also the loudest.
---
Just use an Amazon prime free trial and cancel it right away for free stuff.
---
My weapons work fine and why should he wait months to try it when it's free now? Absolutely nothing to lose trying it now. I tried it during the NW free trail and have enjoyed 600+ hours of play since not to mention event rewards I would have missed out on if I'd waited.
---
The Gift Wraps are crafting materials required to make Handmade Holiday Gifts using the "GIFTS" section in the Tinker's bench. Based on the ones I made you'll also need a little adhesive.
---
You can open it yourself (which I definitely did *not* do...) or give it to someone else!
---
Better to ask who doesn't
---
I got mounted brahmin heads plan and tomahawk plan on my first two small gifts I found.
---
Which ones do you need?
---
wow, i've killed like 200 and only saw 1
---
Do you feel the same way about Hulu and Disney+, or AT&amp;T and Direct TV?
---
Its the same thing.  Companies partner with each other all the time to promote their services.
---
A lot of other games do this including the overly adored Warframe.

 &gt; The Gift Wraps are crafting materials required to make Handmade Holiday Gifts using the "GIFTS" section in the Tinker's bench. Based on the ones I mad...
---
I just looked and I can get a 1 month free trial.  I suppose I will wait until tomorrow and try to redeem it.  I wonder how exactly that works when you play on console.  I am a tech dummy and have no idea how that stuff works. Lol
---
what else in this game \*isn't\* a slipper slope? they've been pushing and pushing since forever now.
---
and it's partially your fault for eating it up. not talking about you specifically, op. unless you're one of those people, of course.
---
Zenimax aren't going to invest fuck all in your game, theres money to be made elsewhere, you're game is funding them quite nicely with very little input is what I'm talking about.
---
Time to server hop big bend.
---
This bring a holiday event I would have expected few more Christmas related items. Don't get me wrong I'm happy for the opportunity to get rare plans &amp; mounts as well.

The biggest thing in this game (I‚Äôve been in Spence BETA day 1) is for you to be you! You like solo? Covered. Rather team up? Don‚Äôt be shy. Want to explore, get serious level ups done, or are you the story line type? All of that is possible as well. You play the way YOU want to play.
---
Thank you! Got some cool plans :)
---
Like twitch prime rewards are basically available for every game out there now.. no this is not a bad thing üòÇ
---
Because they want to people to try it out and keep the population up throughout the day for the game mode. Just afk farm this, if you on PC easy auto click to start new match, for console either auto press A every few minutes.
---
Hahaha, my melee build finally works wonders!
---
I will check again
---
Yeah! like some kind of micro transactions.
---
No it‚Äôs just the primary one, you‚Äôre probably dying cause the nerf, which basically made them useless compared to how they were, however people who didn‚Äôt have the armor called it fair, so Bethesda thinks it‚Äôs a good change.
---
All of them :P
---
One could hope, sadly scorched can‚Äôt spawn legendary versions so not likely even as a bug.
---
Would like to play battle royale if it would let me equip frog legs perk but I can't since my build for the adventure doesn't have enough special to equip it.
---
no but thats what was implemented
---
Yeah! Also important to note. Prices also depend on perks, charisma, and drugs :)
---
Take my upvote friend. Best. Answer. Ever!
---
All of the santa scorched are legendary.
---
Its funny ESO isnt treated like this .
---
Awesome
---
Killed over 100 and only found 2 Xmas scorched so far. Doesn't really feel like an event when they spawn so infrequent. I'm playing in a private server also.
---
Since the items are unlocking one per day and you have to earn the previous reward before you can start working on the next I likely wait until Day 4 (2500XP to get Current and Previous Days Rewards) to get started. In order to get all the rewards before the end of the event i would need to get roughly 1700 NW XP per day until the end of the event (last one ended early so i am not going to count the last day just incase). With my average score in NW that would be roughly 9-10 rounds Per Day. Not sure I'm up to it i dont particularly like NW but damn i want that outfit (the normal Winter Jacket and Jeans is my go-to outfit).
---
Got three in less than half an hour XD
---
Bolstering &gt; vanguards for a bloody build
---
It does look a bit smoother
---
I wonder if super duper works with the gifts. Gonna try it now.
---
Well that‚Äôs a welcome bonus I suppose.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works
---
I don't use Hulu, or Disney+, or AT&amp;T, or Direct TV. So no I don't feel any particular way about any of them. :P 
---
I use Netflix and that's all I use, cause that's all I need to use. And I've never had Netflix offer me rewards for getting a sub with another company.
---
It's like beating a decaying horse. They just need to suck it up and hire you already.
---
Nothing is going to entice me to join or watch twitch. I am a completionist but not obsessive about it. 
---
Twitch just doesn‚Äôt have anything to offer me. I prefer to play the games rather than watch others play. It may be a play for those that like to stream their gaming. It‚Äôs just marketing
---
Well that's good to know at least. I've never played a game that's done this before, though I largely play the mainstream MMOs and single player RPG/strategy games.
---
This isn‚Äôt new for games to partner with Twitch Prime to reward subscribers.
---
No it‚Äôs fine just get the free trial or use your prime account. Every game has this.
---
Mounted cat, dog and Brahmin plans so far. Oh, and one gift just gave me a basketball
---
 but a few OP builds stop working.... that is totally false, It is certainly more than a few it affected unyielding builds, vanguard, bolstering etc
---
Hundred if not thousands of players were affected. Bethesda themselves acknowledge it is a major concern and are rolling back parts of the patch ie reverting to former bug. Brand ambassadors are always presnt and should have to identify themselves
---
Heck i was in a similar situation after trying out most builds. Out of everything i picked up my bloodied double barrel shotgun simply because it reminds me of good ol DOOM days. It‚Äôs got no range so I basically fight like a melee lol but when you‚Äôre up close you see the full glory of gory paste from ‚ÄòBloody mess‚Äô effect and that‚Äôs quite satisfying. Not much so when you shoot from 50 yards or more. End up dying way more than my heavy gunner build lol but that‚Äôs the last thing I worry about.
---
Most of the stuff isn't micro in the atom shop.  18 bucks for a power armor skin is insane.  I just can't fathom people buying atoms for 1 thing like that.  I bought the Pale Rider armor skin with atoms I earned in game and I thought that seemed pretty steep much less paying that much.
---
Are you actually employed by Bethesda though?
---
Care to expand further?
---
If there is a promotional week on a game and a good chance of a decent audience then streamers are more likely to take the game on for a bit during that time period are they not?
---
Do you mean Twitch Prime free trial? This isn't about Amazon, I feel I'm missing something. xD
---
If there's a free way to sign up for TP then this seems like a non-issue to me. I have no idea though!
---
Scroll down a bit.  Someone just posted it on another similar thread.
---
Bullshit, it effects everyone who uses legendary armor. Stop trying to cover up a massive flaw in the gameplay. This is the  worst time to come into the game, the OP will be left with a terrible first impression.
---
Bench point taken, but it has happened to me.  Go to fix a weapon and i have no mats, go to stash at camp..able to repair...so don't know what that can be. I used to believe like you did until i added 1st.  My evidence is the fact that i have played since beta...300+ levels and had one explosive weapon drop TOTAL in Adventure mode...never had 3 star unyielding or sentinel drop, never saw a quad or two-shot.   Had 1st for a total less than 7 days, played a total of 6 hours.  Now I have 2 3-star: quad teslas, TSE-handmade, TSE- fixer and TSE bloodied gatling.   For melee I have 3-star instigating MM gauntlet, Bloodied deathclaw with swing speed and strength. Armor:  full suit of 3 star unyielding with weight reduction, full 3 star weightless marine, and assassin sentinel.  I have never seen any of these except at vendors in Adventure mode. Blew through 10,000+  script previously of shit since beta.  Brought 300 and change over to 1st and in addition to the script i gathered that initial run grabbed 4 of those TSE's at one sitting. Then the rest in successive Purveyor visits...only scrapped 2 items during that time...TWO.  You know things that don't happen to you but happen to other people...actually happen, surprisingly.   I love people commenting to others with "That's not true" or "You are lying" because its not happening to them...that just shows the mindset and personality.
---
Last I checked if swapped your floors/foundations to a different paint job after placing it counts as double space taken and is reverted back by putting it back to what you placed it down as then requires you to log out and log back into server. Not sure if its still in game or not for this bug as last time I had to deal with it was about 2 months ago.
---
I‚Äôve made three and so far no doubles
---
Twitch prime is a subscription service that allows you to get extra stuff for games if you buy it. The good part about this is that it links to your amazon account‚Äôs amazon prime if you have it. Therefore if you have amazon prime, you can link your account and get everything on there for essentially free.
---
Not sure that's the only reason but there last part isn't untrue. I did seriously consider cancelling 1st till this was fixed because I'm not going to play with most of my armor malfunctioning. Thankfully they're right on it this time because if it lingered more than two weeks I'd have cancelled and resubbed after they fixed it.
---
I couldn't tell if it was the mothman noise or supposed to be the sounds of the tracks spinning
---
Fallout themed gift I see.
---
You have two options: A) Main, Secondary Quests &amp; Lore, B) Events, Misc Quest and the old "kill, loot, return".
---
A.) Do all the lore quest in the starting zone (The forest), read every note, listen every holotape. You probably finish the trial on level 20 with a good idea about the game.
---
B.) Kill enemies, loot everything and level up fast doing events. You probably finish the trial on level 30 with another good idea about the game.
---
I play several other games and none of them have this, so I would strongly disagree that 'every game' out there has it. :P 
---
But if it's a common thing in certain circles then that's good to know. It struck me as unusual.
---
I want those robot leg plans too!  Been hunting forever for them.  I just need those and the plasma grenade plan to get my last 2 possum badges!  The workday can't end soon enough!
---
Twitch is owned by Amazon. Amazon prime includes twitch prime
---
My graphics are also way better....and I HATE the idea of 1st.
---
have had really good luck at glasses caverns i get between 4-8 holiday scorched per run
---
I've had around 6 or 7 out of, idk, 40ish? It's RNG.
---
It would be cool if they would add some new stuff to her loot pool every once in awhile to mix things up.  Maybe add some rare cosmetics or some other rare plans.  I wish she still dropped mutation recipes.
---
You know which one??
---
Ok that changes things a bit. Will update OP, thanks.
---
Cos he will be left with the lasting impression that this game is terrible in my opinion. And your weapons may work fine as weapons, but they break the legendary effects of your armor.
---
I agree, lots of shills on here telling you everything is fucking tip top üëå
---
Even better.  Gift in Fallout.
---
Oh I get all of that - but I'm more referring to twitch prime rewards for prime members that view a streamer of a game taking part in a prime promotion.
---
If the viewers account is linked up correctly then in game rewards should unlock after a certain threshold of watching is reached - at least that's what I remember from Warframe in the past, ....i think...
---
Pebbles gang for life üòõ
---
Cat, Fox, Radstag and Brahmin heads with a T-45 leg plan

---
How is this any different than Fallout 1st?  You pay someone money, you get exclusive items that no one else can have.
---
Of course affects all legendary effects. But nobody uses armor for legendary effects on level 1. And my armor is still useful without legendary effects. I really don't like one shoot all and being invencible. Also, Bethesda is reverting the patch for the 250DR when reloading in order to avoid this bug.
---
No. I'm sorry. 
---
I'm not English native speaker. 
---
Justification of this kind of behaviour was not intended. 
---
I was trying to point out that every company has ongoing projects. New and not completely developed projects need a lot of man power to be completed on time. 
---
Bethesda thinks that Fo76 is game that is good enough atm. Peoples still playing and paying.
---
I hit up Tyler County Fairgrounds twice and got two each time, then found some more at the Morgantown airport and high school.
---
It will depend on your tolerance, it is a buggy mess and can be very frustrating. Bethesda support is non existent and the sub is full of brand ambassadors. I really enjoy the game and am a fallout first yearly subscriber, but you need to know that there is always something wrong with this game, crashes, server disconnect, pop in etc. When you are looking for answers to these kinds of issues the majority are helpful and empathetic, but you will run into the brand ambassadors who tell you that you are the only one experiencing that problem, it's your router, your isp server, it's your setup etc very frustrated having to navigate these folks. Still with all that said give it a try
---
Do you know how to search by "new".  Honest question because some people don't Reddit much.  Anyhow there is the link.
---
It was must where it was there hahaha its a pretty cluttered room
---
Where are the hints for the packages? The hints for the map fragments were pretty blatantly placed (if they took a little sniffing to decipher) but I haven't run across anything that tells me where to look for the packages. I did pick up that item from in front of the chalkboard but I can't really do anything with it that I can tell.
---
That is how it works, sometimes. In fallout 76‚Äôs case it‚Äôs probably just a thing you claim and you‚Äôre done, that‚Äôs how most of them work.
---
I suppose at level 1 this is a none issue yeah. Whered you hear that about them reverting it?
---
Big Bend Tunnel, popular farming spot
---
yeah I agree
---
But after the event, it's gonna suck real bad, since scorched never seem to spawn as legendary
---
Shame if that's the case - good opportunity to get some stresses involved, timing it with the free weekend on too would be the icing on the cake
---
Of course they were affected, but is not unplayable. They are saying the game is unplayable without the legendary perks. And that's not true. It seems unplayable for people who wanna one shoot everything and being invencible.
---
Glad to hear you're having better luck ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Damn!  Just ran over to Morgantown airport to find some hotdogs for the Possum challenge,  and started the event there.  Ended up with 7 (very low level) Legendaries (scrip is scrip, tho, amIright...üòâ), and foind several new plans within my gifts, including two different prime receivers!  
---
This event has gotten off to a very good start for me!
---
Oh... They said on the ITV. Go check it.
---
Terrible idea I already buy enough atoms and subscribe to fallout first now I have to pay more to get other cosmetics I may want....
---
I think it's payback for only finding one magazine and no bobbleheads for the first couple weeks I played the game. ;) I hope your luck improves soon!
---
I guess we‚Äôll see tomorrow
---
When you say "eCommerce" all I think if is Tai Lopez.
---
Will do, that's probably the best they can do right now. Shame, I just bought a couple 250 RELOAD weapons aswell.
---
Sad truth üòû
---
The word doesn‚Äôt change based on who uses it. 
---
Your *build* may be ‚Äòvirtually unplayable‚Äô.
---
I don't like it, it might be to huge (other games do it too) but its just aggravating to see this game ring out its fanbase for EVERY SINGLE PENNY THAT IT CAN. I would expect this from Rockstar or EA. If you would have told me everything going on now, when FO4 was about to realise I would have called you crazy
---
IMO, this is the same thing (albeit a crappier version) of Fallout 1st.
---
Do you have an example of this? I'll check with some of the more hardcore PvP players I know. If there's a way to bypass the damage cap, they would know. They would also typically ask me if I am selling the legendary gear required for any new meta.
---
500 caps and power armor plan üòÅ
---
Be gatling plasmas?
---
I can't even find scorched and the no holiday ones spawn
---
Does anyone know how the ones you receive from the santatron work? Do they just appear in your inventory or are they in the collection box?
---
I got two at Billings Homestead
---
While I've updated the OP to reflect my current opinion that this may be a good move, the two situations are clearly different. Asking someone to sign up for an external service from another company is not equivalent to buying some atoms from the shop and getting bonuses for it (which is what the subscription model here amounts to). For the Twitch thing I have to give my details to an entirely distinct company, which can have various consequences-- you've probably seen them in your spam folder. ;)
---
Apples and oranges, really. But again, I'm not as concerned as I was.
---
Found mine so far in fissure site prime both nuked/unnuked and at the line in the sand event.
---
ü§´ word is chemist perk does ü§´
---
And good lord, it's a junk hoarder's dream. I'm going to add it to my rounds on login. There's so much stuff there and since it seems to be instanced, you don't have to worry about someone else having snatched all the world-spawned junk.
---
Well, not never. I have seen two... in 1400 hours of gameplay. 
---
They are more rare than mythical flatwoods monsters however.
---
Marketing people always say it takes 6 cases of exposure to truly get someone interested in a product (or something similar), something I know works on me personally and on others as well. The only skins I've gotten in the shop have been things I see often, not the quick blink limited time stuff
---
Agreed that's what I been doing, just afk inside bushes, I hate battle royale but gotta do it for the outfits
---
I believe the smaller maps shave off about 5-6 minutes of gameplay. You can definitely run into the fire and loot up if you need, but be sure to spawn somewhere with lots of Stimpacks üòÇ
---
or made a deathclaw event named Santa Claws
---
Chemist perk seems to work on them to.
---
i didnt think it was actually in the game yet.
---
One of those gifts gave me a plan for a trophy cat head :(
---
It means the servers are up but they are in dev mode, only devs can connect so they can test.
---
Stupid question but how do I open a gift they have dropped ?
---
Huh, one of previous patches said it removed the greenhouse from being able to be built in workshops. I never got around to checking on it, but I'm glad it is still available.
---
Christmas came early..?
---
So?
---
Same thing happened to me, I went to the top of the world mezanine level and there were 5 legendaries in there alone so like 1 of 6 was a normal scorched.
---
I've had good luck at all the amusement parks as well, server hopping between adventure and private.
---
Means they are probably trying to fix the bugs or revert the game back.
---
Check under "aid" in the pipboy and activate it.
---
Oh then i have to wait, nice!
---
I gather so. 
---
Lucky me as I was away all weekend
---
The galleria
---
It's true it's playable, like a comatose person is alive. This is the problem I allude to, your argument is technical yes you can log in  yes you can run around with a diminished character, but I haven;t spent hours playing and paying to play a diminished experience
---
Forgot about that place!
---
You mean the hourly pay of their employees to do work rather than just sit and do nothing?...., i think they would do it
---
I've already set my heart on rolling the combat armor dense chest mod plan so that I will inevitably be disappointed when it doesn't happen.
---
Oh good one for sure!!
---
you can get that now ?  Ohh.... i see :/
---
You paid $60 (or whatever) for 76.  *After that*, they announced that there are things that you can get in 76, that weren't included in the base game.  You have to pay money to get them (to whomever), if you don't pay, you can't get them.
---
Leaving off what the exact rewards are (which is a different discussion), I see no difference between the two.
---
*IF* you want to dig, we can break out whether paying for cosmetics vs paying for game enhancements, that's a can of worms you *probably* don't want to get into, at least not with me ;-)
---
Yep now my weightless armor is not weightless and I can‚Äôt go chameleon.
---
Peter probably included a line ‚Äòsee Paul‚Äôs code‚Äô, and Paul‚Äôs code is everywhere üëå
---
Yeah, even us high levels would prefer cave crickets.  Acid is king....
---
Issue with the Christmas ones is you have to unlock the previous one before you can start working on the next one and the XP doesn't carry over. So to get all items (after they unlock) its going to take 27001 Total NW XP. Not to mention only one per day unlocks for the first 6-7 days.
---
[XP Costs](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8vtip/nuclear_winter_unlockschallenges_for_christmas/)
---
Because they believe that their customers *ARE* that stupid and will be easily manipulated. And enough of them have been, or they wouldn't keep the model going if it wasn't successful enough to maintain.
---
I haven't found Santa Scorched yet but I made my own gifts. Got the Icicle lights, I'm happy :D
---
Except you don't know if you could fix it or not. That's my point. You're making assumptions based on your experience with a different game in the series.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2C51LWengvFlYaIrq0bhiq/fallout-76-free-trial-double-xp-week
---
Download the launcher (or let it update if you haven't), and it should be there.
---
I'm guessing this isnt affecting everyone,  I'm in unyielding armor and ran around last night swapping between melee and guns and wasnt having any issues . I wonder what's causing it to affect some but not all players .
---
It's ok it was...a scorched cat.  Yeah, scorched.  Not a regular, cuddly lovable cat.
---
Yep, that's what I'm going with.
---
Yes, sort for new and scroll down
---
So be it. Virtually unplayable
---
Glassed cavern is another good one, as well as just any fissure sight.
---
That wouls be awesome.
---
The robot armor plans are relatively easy to get naturally, but I'm stoked for a chance to finally get the rest of the metal and raider armor plans! As well as finishing my power armor crafting recipes! That alone is worth the entire event to me.
---
Just travel from fissure site to fissure site. The SBs cause the Scorched to spawn pretty constantly. Stop by places like Mosstown, Bailey Family Cabin, AVR Medical, Distant Thunder event, Watoga Municipal Center, Watoga EMS, etc.
---
It's not available in-game yet.
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/sUNqplVFtsctW
---
Still nothing to deal with the hackers
---
Correct.
---
What‚Äôs new pussycat
---
I got the robot torso and arms, but not that pesky leg plan.
---
pc player,  I'm in unyielding armor and alternating between ranged and melee and have had no issues . so I'm wondering what's causing some but not all folks to glitch
---
I seemed that way to me too until last weekend where I ran into 4. One at the reststop in the Mire, two in Harper's Ferry (during one run) and one at the repair yard near Watoga. Three were 3 star and one was 2 star. There's also the one in the Civic Center that has been three star for me twice. I think they may have already upped their numbers prior to this event. But, of course, it may have just been totally random.
---
**Good luck in the ranks!**   
---
make sure you get the *easy XP* by claiming the workbenches ( Õ°‚ùõ‚ÄØÕú ñ Õ°‚ùõ)
---
The SBQ used to drop them, but they took that out in the same update that removed the legendary robots in Watoga.
---
And in fact that seems to be the case. So it‚Äôs just a display bug and I still have my possum badges on my scout-member characters. Thanks!
---
Awesome!! forgot those as well. Good lookin out!
---
Line in the Sand
---
Having everything always available would be a bit overwhelming for me unless they have a better way to scroll through everything.  I just with they would give an option for us to filter out stuff we have already purchased, or sort it to the bottom of all the lists hahah.
---
How many did you got?
---
Five
---
Yes, but a high enough Agility will overcome that, also Higher level enemies have higher level perception.
---
Escape Artist only works when you can break "Line of Sight", unfortunately hat seems to mean getting off their compass, not just behind something.
---
imbeciles
---
Heavy, light, or sturdy? I ended up getting all the robot plans, I'm missing the sturdy/heavy metal and raider, and some of the PA plans that are available during this event. The drop rates farming them are so low.
---
It's no diminished. I can one fight almost every enemy and win fast. The sheepsquash is the only one truly a bullet sponge. Also... The SBQ is no supposed to die in a minute!
---
I also have spent hours playing (like 150 if mind you). I really can't stand how people can have fun killing all with one single shot.
---
thank you.
---
Check workbenches, i haven‚Äôt tried it but I‚Äôd assume that would be it because it says to craft
---
I really just need any for that possum badge. Doesn't matter the type
---
Convention center in Watoga
---
My money's on "threw up their hands and started to work on the next project".
---
That's not even a reason.
---
I was moving armors via bag drop in my private world - like I had done dozens of times before without incident.  I loaded back in, and the bag gave me the spinny circle of despair.  I had some friends hop in, and the bag didn't even render on their end.
---
I am thinking that the bag contents hadn't finished updating from the client --&gt; server before I logged off, so it essentially corrupted the bag.
---
I filed a ticket, and they told me "blah blah blah... support tools limited... blah blah", and finished it with a "Kind Regards" closing.  It felt like a swift kick to the balls.
---
You need to be crouched right?
---
How about the 2nd floor of top of the world
---
huh. how do you get the quest??
---
Mr. Fuzzy is life.
---
Where are you reading this? Are we talking about the rewards that come out on the 17th?
---
"IF you want to dig, we can break out whether paying for cosmetics vs paying for game enhancements is different"
---
That's not what I was talking about though. :P  You're not taking into account my point that it's an external service, which differs from in-game, in-house deals. I'm not saying that's a make/break distinction, but it is a real distinction that undermines your point that they're the same because it requires different actions and different consequences to get the reward.
---
‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt killing them it‚Äôs your problem, not the games‚Äù. I am killing them-I would just like some other cards to balance everything out.
---
Yep. When I get home I might try &amp; map out an around Appalachia Scorched hunting route. So many locations.
---
Anyone else go into the Pawn Shop and hear the sound of metallic explosions after about 5-10 minutes? It scared the crap out of me when I was staring at the photos on the chalkboard. I couldn't find the source.
---
FOMO : Fear of Missing Out. Garbage tactic used to create artificial scarcity for something utterly devoid of value.
---
Oh which reminds me "Hunters Rest"
---
Ughhhh I can't wait to play lol
---
Ya, I was trying to think of spots that exclusively spawn scorched
---
I‚Äôve got some I‚Äôd trade/sell need flux
---
It‚Äôs not as bad as you think because there are perks/mutations that help you at low health. That said, it is definitely a more challenging play style and takes a little practice.   If you are using a legacy Gatling Plasma, you will die most often from blowing yourself up.  It‚Äôs a trade off that you need to accept and have a bit of a sense of humor about.  
---
The analogy I‚Äôd use is that a bloodied build is like playing a Wizard in another MMO.  The difference is that the wizard in this game is *way* more powerful than one in those other games.
---
Do those scale to your level? Every time I do collision course there were only low level scorched, i was quite puzzled.
---
640 ish hours now and yes I can still play the game but my experience is diminished. I am pleased for you that you are still enjoying the game. The only thing left for me to do is farm legendaries but if these are broken what is the point?
---
Found it, thanks bro
---
yes, im enjoying it myself
---
Clancey Manor I believe is usually scorched as well
---
I got the brahmin heads plan and the tomahawk plan so far. And a lump of coal.
---
Yes-but all those things are even more useful when you can jump 20 feet in the air at a whim. It‚Äôs strange to say the least when someone‚Äôs first reaction when being ambushed is to literally jump in the air.
---
The Ranger Armor was available throughout the country; it‚Äôs just tactical riot armor.
---
While the LAPD used it much more extensively than other departments, it was not manufactured **solely** for them. 
---
It was also used by the USMC as well. 
---
Just because it was *more predominant* in one area of the country doesn‚Äôt mean it was *exclusive* to that area.
---
I don‚Äôt think you mean a rollback.  A rollback would mean we‚Äôd lose all character progress since the patch launched.  Probably just an emergency fix.
---
for those of us still stuck at work....
---
 whats the cost of the gift wrap?
---
Pretty sure all legendary scorched are Santa scorched now. The one stars probably drop common boxes, 2 stars medium, 3 stars rare. And they‚Äôre just scorched with Santa costumes.
---
No idea if this is true btw I‚Äôm just guessing off of what others have said
---
Call me crazy, but doesnt dromedary only make aid items restore more thirst? I don't recall it mentioning lowering thirst rate.
---
Sidenote, wouldn't a perk to increased food buff  benefits duration be nice?
---
&gt;If it doesn't work for Fortnite's player base, what makes you think RPG players are going to fall for it?
---
It does work for Fortnite though.  They do limited time skins and everything as well.  Many games do because it works.  Vaulting is very effective
---
With hard bargain, grape mentats, and 9 charisma, for me it's a little over 1400 caps
---
Not true at all.  Read my replies above.
---
I have a little platform in my camp where I put holiday event camp items the santatron definitely brings it all together with the Easter eggs and the jack o lantern rack
---
Wavy willards
---
Good point... I have noticed that I‚Äôm going through a LOT of water. I just assumed I had some complex set of perks and issues that somehow increased my water consumption to the ‚Äúmy lover is working at 1% efficiency‚Äù level. :)
---
Good one!!
---
Actually I would say the programmers are doing an extremly good job, under the circumstances. We have to remember that this is a small team, that was bought up, given a Game Engine they never used before and told to make a multiplayer game in said Engine that is a single-player Game Engine. And then the game was released before it was ready by Zenimax so they had to work under the preassure of the Product already being used by customers.
---
Considering all that i think they are doing fuckin great. The game is still kind of a mess, but these programmers are doing great under the cicumstances. Had this been the Fallout 4 team, who helped update and make the Engine into what it currenlty is, well, then i would have been proper pissed if they did not do better.
---
That's absolutely untrue.
---
A gamma gun can shoot up through the terrain?  I've tried shooting crap from underground, and it never connects.
---
Just did the event @ Morgantown Airport a little while ago and encountered 2 per wave, plus ran across 2 of them on my jaunt between the spawn-point and the event trigger, so 12 in all.  Ended up with 7 new Legendaries, and 2 Prime Receiver plans in the process.   Not a bad haul at all.
---
The plasma grenade plan is also one I'm looking for :)
---
I was thinking fissure sights. Just dont kill the sb and let it keep spawning scorched. But I cant test until after work. 
---
I‚Äôll have to use melee though! My unyielding armor suffers from the reload bug. Please Bethesda, cure this reload sickness!!!
---
Kajiit has wares. If you‚Äôve got coin.
---
Then don't play it?  No one is holding a gun to your head and you'll still be able to play Adventure with no one making fun of you because you don't have a beanie with snowflakes on it.
---
My camp is on power transmission tower, with a flight of stairs up to the 1st level.
---
Put the Santratron on the ground next to one of the 4 base corners of the tower.
---
A few minutes later, it had made it to the other corner, did a 180, made it over the barrier at the bottom of the staircase, walked up, made another 180, and was just hanging out in the doorway talking to itself.
---
Almost anything is more fun with others/friends...
---
We are checking it now to determine how many wecan spawn on multiple atempts
---
I think this is an old bug. What happens is the game preemptively registers that the target is dead, but then the server doesn't register a hit or two, resulting in VATS releasing and the target still being alive.
---
I think I even saw some lead weights in there. Truly we have been blessed
---
I think they are completely aware of the state of game but as you said they got their money already, and people keep giving them it
---
Nope. That is the term they used and that is the correct term.
---
Well...it may have been removed at one point but every patch brings back a few "fixed" things, lol.  Dunno if that's the case here, but it sounds plausible.
---
&gt;Why not just leave items in the Atom store forever? You're leaving money on the table from a really common type of shopper
---
There's also large holiday gift, maybe a medium too, not sure
---
It's done to create pressure in the consumer. "I've got 24 hours left to get this...I better just buy it right now so I don't miss the chance."
---
CoD MW does this and it's even worse imo. They claim it's "Limited Exclusivity" content in their store that leaves in 24 hours, but it just rotates in and out with another set of 5 items.
---
that's a good idea i may have to play with that.
---
  Whew.  That's spendy to not know what you'll get (if you open it yourself), especially if you have a large number of the plans already.
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
They didn't nerf it but fixed a long lasting bug/exploit where you got an extra 100+ carry weight by relogging with the suit on. I have a suit with C. Shocks and it'd give me over 300 carry weight  by the two legitimate reasons and the bug
---
I think you are sort of missing the point.  
---
The concepts being employed are really only geared towards a small niche of player.  For all games with micro transaction based monetization models there's a very small % of the total players that make up a very large % of the actual real world money based purchases.    
---
If you are not one of the people buying close to EVERYTHING in the atom shop then you just simply are not one of the people the atom store is focused on.  The people running the store have analytics tools, and every decision is geared to get the players that have already spent $500+ to spend over $1000, all the $1000 people to $1500, and so on.  
---
Meanwhile players that have either never bought atoms, or have maybe spent $5-$10 since their initial purchase will always and forever feel left out and make posts like this one.

‚ÄúAN UPDATE ON PATCH 16
---
Following the release of Update 16 earlier this week, we began receiving community reports that effects granted by armor were being disabled after reloading. We have been actively investigating this issue and have confirmed it is related to a fix that we included in Update 16 to address an issue with the ‚Äú+250 Damage Resistance While Reloading‚Äù (+250 DR bug) legendary effect.
---
Getting this resolved is a priority for us, and the fastest way for us to address it is to roll back the fix for the ‚Äú+250 DR‚Äù bug. We are currently planning to do this as soon as possible, so keep an eye on the Fallout 76 forums and @Fallout on Twitter for more details as soon as they are available. Additionally, it‚Äôs still important to us to fix the +250 DR bug, but we want to make sure that fix completely addresses the issue and does not introduce anything new. We are currently aiming to fix this prior to Wastelanders, and we will let you know as soon as we have more concrete details to share.‚Äù
---
if anyone runs across a vats cost / chance rifle i wannit
---
Well then I‚Äôd say they used the wrong term. Unless they are just loading the prior game build and that‚Äôs what they mean by a ‚Äúrollback‚Äù.
---
Sell it for 50K ?
---
Just carry a bunch of corn and fertilizer.
---
That‚Äôs actually not true. Several of my favorite weapons were dropped by legendary scorched (TSE DB shotgun, Ex explosive mini, a BSS supersledge, etc).
---
I cant play right now but are their spawn rare ? Common, or is it just like the legendary and crowned enemy, not common yet not rare either ?
---
Nope, it's just a Water Pump but can be placed indoors.
---
I guess you can just either a) ignore it and move on with your life or b) only focus on earning some but not all of the rewards.  
---
Personally I set out to earn everything except the glowing skull outfit during the Haloween event, because I realized that I don't really care about that outfit and also that the other rewards were pretty easy to obtain.  I never felt like I was "grinding", I was just casually playing NW and eventually I earned the rewards.
---
Poseidon Energy Plant, that fairground where Leader of the Pack starts, Gauley Mine, Charleston Trainyard.
---
Tyler County Fairground
---
Ohhh just got a plasma grenade plan from a holiday gift....
---
I verified with one of the most active and skilled PvP players on Xbox. There's not so much as a rumor of a damage cap workaround. He'd definitely know about a one-hit kill option. His build is such that a one-hit kill would be absolutely apparent.
---
So many places. lol
---
Small gift, cool!  Thanks for letting us know.
---
I used it sorry:(
---
I can confirm it doesn't matter, my friend did the packages first, while I did the maps.
---
Either order works.
---
that would remove everything else in the patch including:
---
* holiday scorched event
---
* double xp weekend
---
* NW "nightmare before xmas" rewards
---
* NW xmas rewards
---
* every other fix and update from patch 16
---
Always crouch at your workshop.
---
I mean. I'm joking about the whole situation. I don't think anyone with the power at Bethesda is going to be like " yeah, I'll take that action" lol
---
nah i placed it worked fine and i didnt buy that
---
&gt;110 comments
---
Bro, he was joking. 
---
Chill.
---
The Point of the PvP is to take the other guy's junk, which is what that other guy did. So, yeah. 
---
Best protection is to not be out in the open, don't stay in the workshop area between junk collecting, lock all collectors up and constantly stay crouched so they don't see you on the map while in and around the workshop.
---
I had to run around a bit to spawn some. I stopped at the airport first, none. Then stopped at fissure prime, none. Traveled away to sell some stuff, then I traveled back and found 2 attacking a Deathclaw. Then a Scorchbeast came out and another Santa scorch spawned.
---
Not as common as I'd thought, but they drop a present and a legendary, so not bad :) Oh, and the big present dropped 500 caps too.
---
Fun
---
So from the list only thing worth it would be taxidermy plans, 2 Christmas plans, and the replica grog axe plan
---
I am sorry that you fell to my 10mm pistol, lots of people have that problem.
---
Dont take workshops if you dont want to PVP.  Its an open invite. 
---
After 250 levels, there is not much to do anymore other than Queenie, 94 and Encryptid.  So when those events are not up, we tend to farm workshops.  And by farming workshops I mean killing people at workshops for their junk.
---
Don't be sorry, you might get another one. But tbh I would keep the next one until after the event. They'll go back to being priceless
---
Well, it would be a massive PR disaster, so it's probably precisely what they'll do.
---
Fissure sits as well!
---
Too bad they can't be placed under the Christmas tree in atom shop would make for a neat feature
---
Don‚Äôt forget the benefits outside of unyielding, like nerd rage and serendipity, which allow you to survive at low health much more easily than people might expect. What I often hear is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable having so little health‚Äù, when in reality with those perks the bloodied build can take more punishment than some might expect.
---
Fear of missing out
---
the one I saw was a 2\* legendary
---
Its like Clean Appalachia but all over again ! I love it !
---
Copy that. I will avoid workshops. Thanks for the 50 cap lesson.
---
Weird it definitely wasn‚Äôt an option on the one of my three accounts that didn‚Äôt have the scrapbot.  Once I bought it, it was a option. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'll still hunt down animals and eat their delicious raw meat.
---
Ate a scortchbeasts heart and got radworms, though.
---
I made it through 220 levels before I tried it out. 
---
I will never go back. 
---
Once you go bloodied, you never go back.
---
Notes 100 % used the word rollback to patch.
---
Thanks Kanye.
---
Very cool.
---
They still have a .48% chance of being obtained. It's not like they're everywhere.
---
Essentially why Fortnite skins sell so well.
---
I did not know that. Like I said I havent played in a while. Apparently that's the only thing to keep people interested in the end game. Kind of sad, but lesson learned. Thanks for the reply. The staying crouched thing is actually a really good tip. I had noticed people weren't always showing up on the map. Now I understand why.
---
It's an unmarked quest. The words on the wall are clues.
---
Everyone is having the same issue or it‚Äôs only me?
---
I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm not playing now
---
I find that balancing rads is an annoying task that I don't enjoy at all, and also that the damage output is overkill for close to 100% of the situations outside of ISS, SBQ, and maybe a couple other cases like Arktos Alpha.  
---
So for me personally the juice isn't worth the squeeze.  
---
That said I agree bloodied is a good "intro" build for people who want to engage in endgame and don't have good equipment yet.  Everything the build relies is relatively easy to obtain.  A full 1\* unyielding and/or bolstering set and a basic 1\* bloody weapon are all relatively easy to obtain and once you have all of that you are gtg.  
---
By comparison other builds require better, harder to obtain gear to really make an endgame impact.
---
Enjoy it while you can because the end-game is utter garbage.  Don't rush.
---
So what is the correct term when a fix is removed from a build?
---
Well. I DO ‚ô° the holidays... just not that way.
---
This is so dope!!
---
[deleted]
---
ofc it's true, I havent seen a legendary scorched in 6 months
---
My assumption is they never took the time to write a regression test suite, which should run on every build. I dont think its a QA problem, since they are spending their time testing new features. It's a problem with an absurdly complicated and tightly coupled messaging/event bus, with no reliable mechanism to verify changes after the fact.
---
I think it is more niche than endgame, most people never touch PvP or workshops at all and only do occational PvP in Nuclear Winter when there is special rewards.
---
The only things I, personally, consider endgame is Imposter event, Project Paradise, Vault Raids and SBQ.
---
Be like steam. If you already have items in a bundle the bundle should much cheaper based on the number of items you aslready own.
---
Steam does this with games. Look up Cities Skylines for example. If you own the base game a 2 expansions, steam will reduce the cost of thed master bundle by prorating the items you already own. I can post an example when I get home.
---
Yes - it seemed to me that I was going through more than usual. No changes to my character or perks as I was just farming mats, but usually I never see the ‚Äòlow on water‚Äô sign because I‚Äôm pretty good at staying topped off, but last night I was getting it a lot.
---
I happened to get the plans from a Horde Event (Anglers) just outside Grafton the day after Patch 16.  
---
Guessing the overall chance was likely boosted.
---
Yeah my comment was a bit cheek in tongue. Cause back then it used to be micro transactions. Nowadays not so much anymore. They still call it that but yeah...
---
Had two spawn in Morgantown airport and high school
---
If they made it look like Murgle people would riot
---
Awesome gift!! I hope I‚Äôm as lucky.
---
Consume it like a foid or drink i suppose? Im at work rn so im not getting to enjoy DXP rn.
---
I sell all my mid tier rolls in my machines and I keep the epic stuff for trade on the trade site.  I generally keep any reduced weight stuff in my stash to use on days I don't have time to farm legendaries.  I usually sit at between 15 and 20k caps incase I find some awesome item in a machine.  Part of my endgame play loop involves shopping at all the vendors on the map.
---
I also stockpile rare plans and cosmetics since the weight on them is so low.  A 10k fixer plan is a lot easier on my stash weight than a 10k rifle.
---
Yeah, personal observation is insufficient here, particularly since this is something that would be quite easy to study, and I also doubt that the marketing/business side of Bethesda and its parent company have no idea what they‚Äôre doing with the atom shop. This is certainly something they would have looked into. Given what we‚Äôve been taught about this and the sheer number of games that do this and remain profitable without seeing the need to make a change, I‚Äôm certainly leaning towards the OP‚Äôs statement being false. 
---
I also disagree with calling temporarily-for-sale cosmetic items ‚Äúshady‚Äù. Feels like another case of righteousness porn against an easy target that people love to hate. I‚Äôd be the first to voice my disappointments and issues with Bethesda and some of the ways they‚Äôve handled the franchise, but this is absolutely not one of them.
---
I just got a medium quality gift. Got so excited, there is a jingle bell noise, the scortch is in a santa suit (no hat tho). I got the gift and a chameleon chest piece. The gift goes into aid and you click x to open, more christmas music then your prize! I got a prime hunting rifle reciever. I got caps and i think something else but so excited with everything happening did not catch it all. This is awesome!!!
---
Off to find another. I was in Helvetia
---
Tried to post pic of the gift but had difficulty, its cool though. Whybsonhard to post pics on here. Lol
---
Def grabbing a lottery ticket tonight lol
---
Yes, i have rough feeled about 30 - 40% faster Water consumption
---
That's why I keep my Zealots 90% wr on me at all times now.  Makes for a great scene when buyers come in and see three dead scorchbeasts and a guy with a minigun in X-01 blackbird power armor standing next to them.
---
There are a lot of things that are pretty rare on that list tbh.
---
If you are in the divide/mire/bog, or near a fissure, that would not really surprise me.
---
  I've had an L50 SB and and L47 vengeful mothman simultaneously, one attacking my acid extractor, the other my fusion generator.. 
---
Also had a pair of L80s SBs once, and a single L80 SB once.  
---
Odd part is I'm in the Forest (between bolton greens and monongah).   Granted, thats close to the divide, but still...
---
Got any emergency protocols?
---
Plan: Plasma Grenade 
---
Plan: The Fixer
---
Plan: Bear Arms
---
These three i hope are drops from the gifts we collect off scorched.
---
I dont see how getting 5 pieces of unyielding is so easy. In 80 levels i've only run pieces twice in drops
---
Someone‚Äôs salty
---
Probably not anymore. Mostly get the crap plans.
---
Oh!? That's a lot of time. Almost 2 hours per day after realese. I now understand, it was not my intention be a jerk. All of us play the game in different way.
---
I recently returned to the Forest because I don't explore all the zone. I equiped 1lv gear and store all aid. It was fun do low level exploration, but is not for everyone. I also create a easily movable camp, decorate it is fun. Farm the challenges to obtain atoms also is fun for me. I don't yet start the boyscout challenges nor farm the daily alcoholic recipe.
---
Few games last more than 100 hours. I cannot play Destiny 2 more than 200 hours, even with new content.
---
Deserved.
---
Ok is it bedtime for my son yet? üòÅ
---
*That's not terrible hush it*
---
Yeah that must be new, because in the past it was only confirmed to be dropped from ash heap events. It kind of bothers me they didn‚Äôt mention that in the patch notes. I know people are going to get ripped off buying them thinking they are still a 1 in a million drop.
---
I struggled with halo. Think church.
---
I got a plasma grenade plan
---
Has that ever happened with a game a developer shutdown?
---
What's her name ?
---
Damnit guess Bloodied builds are back huh?
---
Rosey Palmer
---
It's a potentially fun distraction for endgame players.  Really once you get to a certain stage all that's left to do is grind for legendary items, rare collectibles, Vault 94 armor, and PvP.  
---
Personally I don't take it super seriously and sweaty try hards will beat me but I wreck the average casual player and neither of those situations is very fun for me.  
---
But every so often I'll run into a player who has a similar mindset to me, and get into a fun, protracted and friendly PvP battle (often in groups) and it's a blast.    
---
Win some, lose some, and just enjoy the challenge of fighting the hardest enemy in the game :)  
---
As for suggestions generally you will want a fast fire rate build (commando is most common but I see people do work with heavy weapons) and a full set of ass/sent or cavs to properly engage with other dedicated builds.    
---
That's the basics but beyond that there's layers to it and the real hardcore leverage every last game mechanics to achieve close to immortality which is where I personally check out of the fight.
---
I disagree with that criticism. There are a lot of people on this sub with the same worries. It's not a matter of skill or hand eye coordination, but leveling and combinations. If someone can one shot kill you with no chance to fight back, it makes it much less enjoyable.
---
i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not easy or cheap to certify these updates all the time, seems like a good way to save money would be to actually launch the game first before turning it over.
---
better than playing the shell game with bugs over a year after launch.
---
not only does this cast major doubts on the ability to deliver wastelanders but it makes clear and obvious that bethesda is going to seriously harm the franchise and probably others as well
---
Valley Galaria had been good to me.
---
Maybe Bethesda should just give you everything, all rewards, infinite atoms, raise your XP, and send a hooker to your house to blow you while you play too?
---
Group members can assist in building camps, but the parts basically belong to the owner of the camp.  And once placed, unless the owner of the camp also knows the plans to make them, the pieces will have limited options for being moved, stored, re-positioned, etc.
---
For REAL fun try figuring out which locations have the highest numbers of static spawns!
---
You‚Äôre pretty limited in what you can build in Fallout 76, having to find plans for furniture and the various wall types, and the costs of getting those plans on top of getting resources can be daunting for some but if that‚Äôs your cup of tea I say go for it, otherwise you might be happier with Minecraft if you solely want to build
---
So you're saying there's a chance.
---
I found an accordion in the back of a bus the other day. Good condition, too. Could I display it anywhere? Nope!
---
The best thing bethesda could do is remove building limitations (Intetsects existing object, item is floating, nothing is selected, etc) and have just a nasic budget for camp items thats more than current.
---
Yh been getting that a while now annoying as shit
---
In the early days of player vending, Unyeilding was easy to acquire cheap.  It‚Äôs possible the market has changed.  I generally pick up 1* pieces priced under 1K if I might use them for another character later.  I don‚Äôt seem to come across them as often these days.
---
Thx alot for that disturbing image
---
Oh ok, nice for the help!
---
It would be hard, I have an alt nearly to 50 not bloodied, but the temptation is real, he still has a mix of Unyielding and bolstering since it is the best he has acquired so I tend to let my hp run low much of the time already.
---
when you only have a dozen items to rotate in and out it looks pretty pathetic, because it will be back in a few weeks
---
It still can happen but I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to do pvp not to be a jerk about it.  I had to deal with a pvp team a few days ago who were trying to goad people who were shopping at other players camps if not the camp owner to fight them just to cause grief.
---
With how easy these gift boxes are to get, and this event being live for almost 3 weeks, statistically speaking everyone should be able to get the plan without much trouble in that time.
---
I can mark that off my list. Any news on the other two?
---
Oh nice how long I have to wait?
---
Extremely
---
There's a free trial weekend, I think it already started. You can just try out if you both like it.
---
That would be expectable
---
I have the same problem when i eat spoiled food i think its related to the rads but im not sure
---
I enjoyed this last night - good fun!
---
Unmount and mount armor pieces. Till reload it should work again
---
Humans are a plague on this beautiful world. Ho Ho Ho
---
&gt;Do nukes work for this? If so I‚Äôm about to burn all my cards on the queen
---
You don't even need to bother with a nuke. A horde of them will spawn every time an SB climbs out of a fissure, so just hop between the 4 or 5 fissures in the bog.
---
Doesn't seem like it would be hard to do, since you already share atom purchases across characters.
---
I didn‚Äôt actually ask for anything tho so I don‚Äôt see your point. Just fyi
---
Someone needs a cookie and a nap.
---
Does anyone know how many can you buy ?
---
Stop trying to save an uncaring, greedy company, you naive psychopath. This sub is crazy.
---
Gods forbid people ENJOY hunting mysteries for no reward other than solving it themselves
---
What this man said is 100% the truth. There is literally no denying it.
---
Lol
---
Why do you think they're called **hot**fixes? They don't need to go through the long and tedious approval process. What, you think they're going to sit on their ass for 6 weeks to 3 months if there's a newly found security issue?
---
Wastelanders is supposed to be "Q1 2020" so could be as late as March... If this even takes until January to get fixed it would be insane. Holy hell, I don't even know what to say.
---
Is that what I was doing? Damn, thanks for the info.
---
The failing of the Atom Shop is definitely evident on these interactive pieces. What does it actually do?
---
LMAOOOOOOO
---
If y ou pick up the Adrenal Reaction serum it basically makes everything you own bloodied.  And stacks with Bloodied weapons once you get one.
---
Good. It might not be the best solution, but the problems introduced with patch 16 are far greater than the 250 DR bug patch 16 was meant to fix. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. A partial rollback as soon as humanly possible is the only way they should proceed. I actually cancelled my Fallout 1st subscription because of the patch 16 issues.
---
wrap gifts
---
Best advice is to just play the game.  Start the main quest to get a feel for it them do what you want to.  Just enjoy yourself and the game.
---
Why?
---
People still supporting Bethesda at this point, are already getting everything they deserve.
---
Ok
---
Yes! W00t!
---
...and *Finally*
---
Are they clues to lactations to check? What am I looking for?
---
Your down votes hurt my heart man. :/
---
Yeah, but wouldn't it be funny if they gave it new powers like the ability to walk super fast.
---
Aliens Ate My Buick
---
Me three.
---
How do you obtain the gift wrap?
---
I can get 19 agility where I‚Äôm at
---
It's a lot more limited than fo4 where you could build these massive settlements and mod the shit out of your game to make insanely detailed builds. It's more of a "build your own player home" than "build settlements".  Imagine being able to build like, home base from fo4 or megaton house from fo3 including the exterior but nothing larger than that.  
---
That said if you embrace the limitations you can make some awesome stuff.  I just recently started getting into camp building and I'm finding it a fun side game.    
---
My personally thing is "build stuff on top of other stuff that already exists".  So one of my camps is a tower that uses a ski area lift tower as one of the supports for the building on the top.  Another base I build sits perfectly on top of a building in Whitesprings, and a third base sits on top of some existing structures at an abandoned raider hideout.   
---
I have a 4th character looking for a 4th location but I've yet to find something I like :P
---
Any vendor misc section
---
IIRC, if you are on a team, any team member can build any given item at another team members camp.
---
The owner of the camp at which the item is built.... can move it just like any other camp object.  That item can be stored.  I know some things can also be blueprinted.  
---
But if the item is scrapped, and the owner of the camp does not have the plan, that item cannot be remade.
---
What you can do, though, is "share" plans.  
---
Once you learn a plan, you can drop/sell/gift it.  If you give each other every plan you find, then it doesn't matter who builds what, as you'll be able to rebuild it when you move your camp.
---
Were you playing NW? I believe there is a known bug of this if playing NW when the reset occurs.
---
Because it pressures people into buying it now, otherwise it'll be gone.
---
A lot of the cave spots used to be buildable, but have since had their areas made 'claimed' for future map additions, like new Vaults.
---
Freddys house is ghouls
---
Youre more innovative than those gravity bending nazis down in antarctica dang
---
Weirdly enough it was just Gwyneth Paltrow's severed head :\. Odd decision by the game designers on that one.
---
Two running exterior and cooling towers at posidon
---
I found one in the southern part of the map that allows it to be built in
---
Look at it like this - you savages run your phones at 10% battery life all the time so why not your game character?
---
Took me a little while to try it, but I won't play another way as the game currently stands. If I spin up a second character I'll focus on being low-health as soon as it's viable rather than waiting until the early 200s to make the jump. I thought being a melee tank was the easiest way for me, and I was wrong. Paradoxically, running super-low health is as close to god mode as there is in this game.  
---
You don't have to jump into the deep end and go from maniacally keeping your health at max to running 10%. I sure didn't. Started out with a couple of pieces of Unyielding and a Bloodied gat, staying around 40% or so, getting used to the added maintenance to stay alive, then 30% with better armor/weapon, then 20% with even better equipment, and finally 10-15% a couple of months ago and now I'm basically Dr. Manhattan vs. North Vietnam.
---
The spread from the gun will be a lot tighter when you go full rock and roll with it.  It does work, it just doesn't change the stats of the gun.
---
You can build a large amount at workshops but those are open to pvp.  A bunch of the posts in this thread have some great ideas you could try out.
---
They are in the box
---
Want!
---
Are the wrapping papers 1 time use
---
Wait, they're gonna have me hunting around for a bunch of things that lead to no loot?
---
The pvp players aren't doing anything that you can't do yourself if you choose to go down the rabbit hole :P
---
Downvote for the truth
---
Did they fix the reload bug yet? I want to play but not with the bug still active.
---
There are tons of locations on the map that have scorched. Maybe try walking around and seeing what you find.  Not sure how you took the event as a bad thing?
---
It's almost as if they're telling us not to play their game.
---
Is there a plan to create holiday gifts? Found the wrap, not sure how to make one.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvWfbIe4X_4
---
Glad I have a few perk cards available lol
---
This is good. Does their loot match the weapon they brandish?
---
That was lucky!  I have been running events for that damn plan since ever upwards came out. Lol. I'm pretty happy I actually having a decent chance of getting the drop or being able to buy it in someones machine.
---
Yeah, literally paying for private servers literally saved me literally 36 headaches literally just today.
---
No. Just go to any tinker's workbench and select the gift option. X1 wrapping paper and x2 adhesive for any of the three levels of gift
---
I tried that didn‚Äôt work I just put on the armor weight reduction perk so I could move.
---
Cheers!
---
Anywhere else like floor loot or anything?
---
Also how expensive are they
---
I‚Äôve literally spent the last three hours walking around and found 1 alive and three dead. The one area I found any, another guy was there hurrying as fast as he could to kill them before I could even get a shot in for the drop. I even went to high scorch spawn areas like Camden park and Morgantown. This event is a step in the wrong direction as usual. Thanks for the tips tho, I know your just trying to help.
---
Yes and standing stillm
---
Tinkers work bench
---
Ya I'm using bloodied shotgun and handmade. I'll try with something else tonight.
---
Thanks for making a lot of them legendary helps with the scripe farming also
---
Because if they are there forever there is no urgency to buy, if they are for a limited time people are more likely to buy now rather than procrastinate on the purchase.
---
What is the final reward? Do we know what the outfit looks like?
---
Probably exclusive for subscribers.
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted. This is true
---
I thought Chemist worked on the Chemistry bench, whereas Ammosmith worked on the Tinker's bench.
---
Both versions are fun to listen to. I can't wait for the Raider bot. üòÇ
---
Have fun you both
---
I said a year ago that the only way I'd found to safely play this game was as a naked forest dweller who has no Camp and fights with a baseball bat, because anything more complicated than that was just an endless maze of gun and inventory bugs, server kicks, broken Camp structures, and glitched armor effects.  Everyone will be in my backwards tribe eventually
---
I remember it working when I crouched only when I had it. And i don‚Äôt remember if it works when your shooting.
---
Can you open your own presents up?
---
Upvote for subject alone.
---
Well it's switching on AND off over and over again. Not just off
---
It‚Äôs back right now!
---
My god, they're useless.
---
/agree
---
And yes LoTRO and DDO(been awhile since I played)had shared storage for subscribers and people that bought slots of it off their store
---
You have to kill a certain amount of enemies in the vault. It is listed under challenges and then combat.
---
It was funny at first but after so long his voice is getting annoying with the ho ho ho lol
---
Shiiiiit ... kk even worse than what I saw
---
I have absolutely no issues with Rads and I hear this a lot as if you're just constantly looking at your health bar or something ? I wonder if a lot of the bloodied folks are using the High Capacity backpack or not using Dodgy or something else where it's a constant battle against all odds, like it's such a crazy challenging playstyle and all this. I run bloodied stealth commando and I die more often on my other characters than him, maybe the majority are playing a Bloodied heavy PA build or something I haven't experienced.
---
Still haven't had the bug happening for me.. and I've tried most types of legendary now :p even bloodied
---
This sounds like a nice and easy way to farm especially when I am quite low on ammo. Lead, steel and plastic for ammo and the screws are always nice addition.
---
Attacking me for saying literally because you know it‚Äôs the truth, and you have nothing else to say. Haha.
---
You can get shovels and pipe revolvers now though. Link needs an update.
---
My railway rifle is broken tho.. turns prime now and then without being primed :p
---
*DAMN IT*
---
Yeah I wasn't sure at first if they worked liked Scorched Officers who just show up randomly or if they worked like Legendary mobs who show up when the game generates a bunch of the same kind of mob.
---
So yeah they do essentially function as a Legendary+ Scorched mob. I tried a bunch of Scorched hangouts and got zip until I found my first ones at the fissure site by the pumpkin house and there I got 2. They make an unmistakable jingle bell sound and are wearing Santa costumes and are marked as legendary.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they got a little hard to find as people scour the regular scorched spawn areas. So happy hunting on that one.
---
Also don't forget your Santatron (supposedly) will fetch gifts for you and you can make your own gifts by buying paper from vendors (I bought mine from Graham). Paper's not cheap (~1500 for the good stuff!) but it makes 2 gifts and could be a good cap sink for when you're hitting your cap limit.
---
;) call me greedy but i like this idea more
---
Oh nice! I‚Äôm excited to collect some and hopefully get some plans for items I don‚Äôt yet have!
---
If it's an instance you have to load in/out of they can definitely use higher res textures and lighting effects without straining the console, I haven't seen it yet but it's very possible
---
Man, I really pissed off the folks on the discord trying to ask this. Their answers were basically ‚Äúuse the black light‚Äù (but that‚Äôs for the map pieces), ‚Äúhere‚Äôs all the locations‚Äù (thanks, but I was trying to figure it out on my own) and ‚Äúfollow the clues‚Äù (what clues!?!)
---
I think the clues for the packages are supposed to stay with the three notes in the floor by the front door, but I can‚Äôt figure anything out from them. I see people talking about the post office in Clarksburg, but I can‚Äôt tell if there‚Äôs some logical leap from the letters to that post office or if it‚Äôs just a location the data miners found.
---
I get the feeling the entire quest is incomplete and not really ready for us to do yet.
---
Sounds like it saves you roughly $10 a month on tylenol.
---
I was very close to buying private servers until i realized i have more than 150 K CAPS and i can simply buy the gifts and be done with it. The servers are super laggy in Europe, it's obvious they don't care about public servers anymore.
---
Nice, time to sink my 300k caps.
---
Why are you still playing if it causes you this much butthurt?
---
It's in a low level area and it's meant to be triggered by newbies wandering into Morgantown airport for the first time.
---
Oh good, I was concerned if actually want one of the higher tier rewards.
---
Yes, its a reskinned winter jacket and jeans
---
No, Im saying private servers are the answer, which means Bethesda does know what we want, literally.
---
I did these all yesterday on my day off from school and spent almost the whole day trying to track everything down and find everything. I hope everyone the best and an easier time now that we have so much info available
---
Every Santa scorched I've seen is a legendary, so Purveyor gets the real presents.
---
Solid question. Fo3 was my first rpg and the first game I ever really grinder. In other words, it was my first real game experience. Fallout is super sentimental to me and I want to stay with Bethesda. But it‚Äôs almost like a bad relationship at this point.
---
The clues are to locations. There is no lactation involved sadly
---
Yes they're clues for locations to check. youre looking for map fragments.
---
Thats a loaded question.  The price of your bloodied sledge depends on how many stars it has, and what the secondary and tertiary effects are. 
---
For just a 1\* you might get 2k from it from someone desperate for a bloodied melee. 
---
if its got 3\* and sits with Faster Swing Speed or 40% more Powert attack and +1Str you can probably get 15k for it.
---
Can't confirm with rock solid numbers and photo evidence, but I'm pretty sure for the Morgantown rewards I nabbed all the final ones in one fell swoop with a single victory, which wouldn't be possible if it was base exp only.
---
Idk where this need to be abused comes from with people. For some reason they enjoy this games bs. They even defend it. Smh.
---
You can craft gifts to give people?
---
I found 5 at Wavy Willards!!! They all gave me small gifts though
---
Just realized you can buy the gifts. I might get it too if i spend 50K caps on the paper :D
---
Yep, I got a couple plans as well. Molerat mounted head, and Lever Action Prime Receiver Plan (already knew that one though).
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll end up doing also. No way I‚Äôm dealing with this nonsense.
---
Maybe these are classified as chems?
---
I just know when I removed Chemist, I went back to just making one at a time instead of x2
---
[https://imgur.com/a/bywzyPK](https://imgur.com/a/bywzyPK) shows spawn points.  F1st members should be able to collect a bunch of presents and legendaries.
---
It‚Äôs a material for making holiday gifts.
---
For the Highschool the last floor is referring to where exactly? the Gym? I must be super blind or something I've looked at the school up and down and could not find it.
---
It's fun, but not really any reason for all 4 of my characters to be Bloodied just because it does the most damage and all that.
---
1 per Vendor although Whitespring Stn seems to sell me 2. Every Vendor on the Map sells them except the staff at the Whitespring. You can clean out a Server then hop servers to reset the gift wrap. I dropped 60k before I realised I could use Chemist to double my yield
---
The game didn't get any real new content for 6 months at least, the patches mostly break the game instead of fixing it and the events are pretty meh. And people downvote me for saying that you must be crazy to spend another dollar for this game.
---
The sweet spot for bloodied is generally around 19% health, enough to proc nerd rage but still not be completely flimsy and as you state, die a lot.  You actually deal more damage at even lower health but whatever.  
---
So for me my goal is to get to 19% and try to stay there but the environment throws rads at you constantly.  So eventually just playing the game normally I'll drop down to what I consider too low and feel compelled to boost back up to \~19%. This requires healing as few rads as possible as even a diluted radaway will usually get you over 20% so you then need to take on just enough rads to get back to around 19% or close.  
---
It's just a tiresome chore. Especially when my non bloodied characters can kill things almost as efficiently.  
---
That said I still run a stealth bloody and it's a fun character as stealth helps reduce incoming damage and rads but it's still a chore especially doing endgame stuff like silos, sbq, and Vault 94 as there's a fuckton of rads in all those situations.
---
yup.  been there since at least one patch ago, perhaps a bit longer.
---
Asking Bethesda to make any sort of reasonable decision this far into the games life span is probably the least likely thing to happen in 2018, 2019, or 2020.
---
When I got the reward I held it once....true story.
---
No, I have three kids, too
---
No lactation? I'm glad I don't have to milk a scorched.
---
I thought it might be the hum of its Nuclear engine but if it has the same sound as the Mothman, then it might be a bug
---
I prefer him and his voice over that of the regular collectron
---
One came at me with a bone hammer. It was a nice change
---
Ok cool. Thank you.
---
It looks cool, and when you interact with it, it fires its cannons. Pretty cool and detailed actually
---
Log off, you're drunk.
---
I've got 4 fingers 4 U !!!! ü§öüèΩ
---
Got 3 at Line In The Sand.
---
I have a feeling that those pieces are on characters whose players are not playing any more.  So if that's you please make them available in player vending or redditt fo76for sale.
---
I think we should have a shared storage that is separate from your stash. It‚Äôd make transferring things from one account to the next much easier
---
It's actually very good but too many players cleaning it
---
And I wasn't attacking you, just being a smartass
---
Nice! Feels like Wastelanders almost already!!
---
There any picture of it online? Want to see if it‚Äôs worth the grind or not.
---
You can search for the post if you remember the title
---
Maybe NW is different then? I don't play much in that mode
---
The event is just lazy trash. I've been around 4 locations and only found 2. People are saying it comes down to RNG that's fair enough for weapons etc but considering its an event it seems very lackluster. Having all the scorched in Xmas atire would have been much better with the odd one dropping presents.
---
Yes, check the wiki page for the winter jacket and jeans, it should be in a gallery at the bottom of the page
---
Ooh there‚Äôs mounted head plans? I‚Äôve wanted the mounted Scorchbeast queen head for months now. It‚Äôd really help finish my upstairs hallway in my camp
---
This is super cool! Even if not a constant, I love the fact we see some weapon variation.
---
Entirely possible. I'll be able test tonight with the Halloween things, still need the jammies.
---
How about super duper?
---
Post back and let us know! Inquiring minds want to know!
---
Not on right now but if i recall correctly it's 400/700/1400. And that was with Hard Bargain lvl 2 and Berry Mentats + Uny set
---
I did my first silo run solo, with a troubleshooters gatling.  Moved slow, sniped the turrets.  Wasn't too bad.  
---
I have heard, but cannot confirm, the more people in a silo, the more difficult it is.
---
As far as I can remember, I got 5, 4, 3 in that order, but you have to get lucky when opening packages, to have loose ones.
---
The high quality is upwards of 1500 to 1800 caps I believe. It's also a trick to make you buy the 500 atom shop present skin because dropping it on the floor it's a paper bag lol
---
I‚Äôve been playing all morning and I don‚Äôt know anything about the gifts other than buying them from the vendor.
---
This link?
---
Not seeing it in the gallery https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Winter_jacket_and_jeans_(Fallout_76)
---
Will do. As a scientist, it is my duty! Vault-Tec demands it!
---
I got mine for 10k but has all the works on it. The stars matter in price.
---
i recently bought exactly that 3\* for less than 2k, doubt the seller knew it's worth. But i'm happy
---
I'm playing on a private server and didn't find one there. It's apparently down to RNG
---
Thanks. Gilpo was kind enough to add the drop chances too
---
Not to mention that it instantly returns on your next visit...
---
Once the ap recharges it goes back on and starts draining again
---
I think it may depend on your intelligence too, sometimes I get 20 scrap from an assault rifle and sometimes I get 19. I got a bunch of uny armor.
---
I'm having no issues with big bend. Getting at least 1 if not more each hop
---
U can graft the gifts?
---
The Responders are also curious.
---
U can craft the gifts?
---
I'm trying to figure out how the light lines up with the ground like that
---
I found two there, ran it twice. Even had another one attack my CAMP that‚Äôs parked right outside. They seem to be fairly common spawns, I‚Äôve had at least one at every scorched related event or location so far.
---
KNOWLEDGE.
---
glassed cavern üëåüèª
---
All the Raider and Metal Armor, Laser Gun Medium Scope, Pipe Gun Auto Mod, Plasma Grenade and Mine. There are so many rare Plans on that list
---
Just got to flatwoods, its in the overseers cashe.
---
Sons of Dane compound, close to a fissure site that is also close to the pumpkin house.
---
Wait!?   They didn‚Äôt even bother to reskin these guys in Santa outfits????
---
You sure? Its right there for me. That is the correct link.
---
Rolling back the 250 damage resistance won't fix the other stuff they broke in this patch. Game is more unstable now and the multiple freezing issues haven't been addressed at all. Every patch damages something new and they are accumulating faster than they can fix them. Plus they keep stealth changing stuff (thirst, hunger, weapon durability) making it hard to tell if they want to sell more fridges or scrap kits or if it's a new bug. The whole development is opaque and  definitely not well managed.
---
There not easy to get
---
Tree fiddy
---
Sorry if this is the wrong spot for this. Was at Morgantown Airport and some holiday scorched were just chillin, not moving and didnt take any damage.
---
Helvetia is pretty good tho. Had one spawn there
---
Just did the event at the Morgantown Airport to protect the delivery from the waves of scorched (sorry, can't remember the name off the top of my head) and out of five waves of Scorched, Legendary Scorched spawned twice and both were holiday theme. Just my experience of course, ymmv but hopefully that helps someone.
---
Probably already been farmed recently, it's best done on a fresh private server if you have fo first
---
I found two at big bend and two near billings farm.
---
don't judge those mole rats where there, and you how i get without a woman in my life.
---
An upvote has been donated in your name to the hootling fund
---
Last floor is upwards, it's in one of the classrooms.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
id like to came across something like this in game lol
---
What's this? Facts and logic in my reddit? Can't have that.
---
Ah thanks fella!
---
Agreed, that would have been awesome!
---
It's like the mother of cRPG. In many ways like fo1/2 but much bigger.   
---
It took up half of my HD in '99 :D
---
Don't forget to mix it with the Super Duper perk!
---
I did it solo once but I‚Äôm still lower level and not a ton of good gear. It drained me of stims and ammo
---
I don‚Äôt sadly of I would have searched
---
It‚Äôs a Shit game run by a shit company 
---
That 2/3 of the unholy trifecta, unfortunately the last third is it‚Äôs a fallout game. 
---
The love for fallout has zero to do with shitthesda- troika made what we all love, the dame up with everything endearing, and anyone staying around this long or coming back is doing it as a testament to the greatness of that group.  Fuck Bethesda and the greedy ass way they‚Äôre trying to one up all of us ‚Äúcash cows‚Äù this time round. 
---
That‚Äôs the fing truth and everybody damn well knows it.  Can‚Äôt wait for this company to go under.
---
Found two just chillin at Camden Park, a one star and three star.
---
Why do I smell dupe exploit üò´
---
He's not hacking this is just how the game works since fo4.  
---
Protip: items that you can "use" like say, workbenches, chairs, beds, instruments etc - if you can click the use button, your character will do exactly that and use the item.  This includes teleporting through walls.    
---
The only way to prevent it is to either remove all your windows (this is how he got in your camp) or insure that there's nothing that can be interacted with anywhere close to a window.
---
Damnit, take my upvote you swine.
---
Thankfully, because those better be some hella expensive gifts to be wrapped in that expensive paper. Fat Man w/MIRV from Tiffany's???
---
UP voted. Yes, noticed this last night. Always just maintained a decent level of food/water meter but last night I was getting "red" several times and it wasn't just because I was caught up in battle and not paying attention. Something truly did change.
---
Alright so just a gun explosion sounds and smoke? No theme or other animation on it?
---
"I mean... how do you measure Luck?!" - Biv
---
Maybe I can‚Äôt see it on mobile? Not sure. I‚Äôll bookmark it and check it out when I get home.
---
I've been feeling events and workshops for em. 
---
Probably had about 12 in the last hour drop gifts.
---
I'm on a low level alt but have easily doubled the number of legendaries on that character due to it as well
---
Looks like you're the cuck, then.
---
My first gift gave me a mounted mole rat head.
---
And it only took you bending over to take it in the ass while supporting an unethical, malicious enterprise, that‚Äôs removed any ethics you might‚Äôve still had left. 
---
Gj bud, so worth it, right?
---
But they keep bringing these desirable items or item packages back to the store, if they were truly time limited then you would not see them in the atom store again. That kind of behaviour is a shady sales practice.
---
Hmm. Have you pressed the dropdown tab on gallery? It wont show up on mobile unless you drop it down.
---
Yeah wanted to do it without a guide as well. I got the Map Fragments locations form the Black Light for the most Part (havent got them all yet) but couldn't find the trail pointing the way to the other Packages from the "Clues" so eventually i just looked them up.
---
Shhhh dont tell people how to do it i find so many camps with venders behind locked doors its the only way to get in :( then after i look i buy 1 ammo at a time to spam them about it lol
---
There‚Äôs an animation. The gun recoils backwards like it would with a Tiger 1 or any modern tank, and there‚Äôs a red visual effect around the muzzle of the barrel for a few seconds after you fire it
---
Yeah, in a few areas I've been hit by the Three Batskateers now and then. Though I don't mind. I like killing Scorch Beasts
---
Also if you fast travel in the walls won‚Äôt load fast enough you can walk right thro them I do it all the time to get to venders faster but you risk getting stuck in foundations.
---
It's the splitter. It's bugged on normal GP and makes it a flame thrower. But with explosive the gun is bugged and fires bullets instead.
---
So what you end up with is a bugged gun with a bugged mod. And it ends up multiplying the number of bullets firednto be way higher than normal, like 4x as many shots. And then it does splash damage due to the explosions.
---
Tbh, most of these accounts are proxy Bethesda shills.  We‚Äôve established that ages ago.
---
350 caps a piece?
---
And how much are you going to sell it for? ;)
---
I‚Äôve got 10k caps and the only thing I ever spend them on are plans for camp items. I‚Äôm hoping to bring a little holiday joy this season to new players so I‚Äôm willing to spend some caps!
---
I got a mounted cat head thanks santa
---
Are these spawning in set locations or is it random locations of scorched
---
And maybe you should go back to your water cooler and come up with new rants with the other Bethesda douches, mr 80 post, 100 day old account.
---
Note that the plans are bound to your character for some reason.
---
üòè well played
---
ditto...I thought it was just me. That with unyeilding being broken...i cant even play atm
---
Yeah santatron is amazing! I actually go to my camp just to hear him talk haha
---
Roll back the fix. Not the entire patch.
---
Ok. I Will learn it. Thank you.
---
I gave it away
---
I couldn't find a bug list, is hunger and thirst an issue cause I'm going through it like crazy and I don't have a disease
---
Sorry to be "that guy," but what do you get from gifts? Random stuff?
---
Yes buy Wrapping Paper from Robot Vendors then Craft a Homemade version. Make sure to equip Chemist to get two.
---
I still need to go in there and check it out!
---
Yes.
---
Plus Grahm sells dif. Types of paper.
---
Theres a coffee shop down in the ash heap which has one cat. Its an unmarked location its at the little white looking building below the big red workshop
---
But I was saving up a live human baby for just this occasion... Now what am I gonna do with this thing?
---
Thanks for all this info!!
---
What‚Äôs so special about plasma grenades. I‚Äôm curious I didn‚Äôt think they were that effective or any grenades at that.
---
Had 3 at both Point Pleasant and inside Big Bend Tunnel
---
They said they hoped to rollback the problem today.
---
Still could.
---
Mounted heads do no good if I cant place them.
---
I was hoping that Plan: The Fixer would be included in these lists.
---
\[scratches your name off the naughty list\]
---
That's a really good point.
---
Plus, it's just kind of fun to open up a box rather than look at a list of items.
---
Read today‚Äôs ITV article.
---
I meant the "whale" thing as a joke.  Personally, IMO, anyone that spends a few bucks (even hundreds) on a game, shouldn't be labeled a "whale."  More like a tadpole or pufferfish for that matter.  I've worked on Wall St. my friend.  I've been in the presence of "whales."  Using that word to describe anyone spending money on games is a gross misrepresentation- believe me.  And empty threats? lol.. um yeah ok.  Telling a company to get their act together or not spending another dime?  That's not a threat, that's a promise.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Oh, good look there...will have to confirm!+1
---
Does it really matter what word they used?
---
I got mine from a liberator defending thunder mountain
---
It rotates between ghouls and scorched.
---
Used for a possum badge but they were extremely rare. Prior to this event you could get top tier weapons for the plan
---
I got 2 at Morgantown airport..
---
My favorite was when he was talking about cheer levels being critically low.
---
I don‚Äôt use Class Freak.  So Healing Factor reduces chem effects by 50% for me.  I find that perfect for a diluted radaway to bring me back up to par.  Keeping rads in the sweet spot is only a problem when friends leave rad sponge on by accident.  Also, I use AquaBoy if I‚Äôm going to be in the water....takes that out of the equation.
---
I have it, to good of a mutation not to on pretty much any character.

So broken game is broken. News at 11.

News break!!!   Bethesda to fix new broken ass guns if you pay 259$/year for ‚Äúunbroken gun‚Äù membership.
---
I don‚Äôt get this either. What‚Äôs the deal?
---
I would like to do a photoshoot and tour of your home! I will post the photos on different forums. I enjoy checking out awesome CAMP builds and seeing what creativity can be created‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I nearly bought them for 20k last week. Glad I waited.
---
Whatever, troll
---
Never gotten anything special from them. Normal junk.
---
Gotta think out of the box.   Find a cave type entrance and build ‚Äúunderground‚Äù with entrance into cave opening.  
---
Otherwise, they‚Äôve actually gone out if they‚Äôre way again to take things we liked from the game. 
---
Maybe if we ‚Äúask enough‚Äù, we can get to pay them $20/month for unrestricted building...lol
---
Is there a functional difference between the 3?
---
Me too
---
This game is becoming 3D Fallout Shelter.
---
Too funny bethesda.  As if I‚Äôd actually have to troll something this bad.
---
What do you do with these gifts?
---
Really glad you're enjoying the new event!
---
I have said it several times on here that the tent and stash box should be for everyone, but it is what it is. Going overboard with rhetoric on a sub that represents a fraction of the Fallout 76 gamers seems pointless, though. Maybe you all should bitch on the bethesda forums

Do you really dislike her that much dude?

I mean, if you wanted to hurt and anger her, you could‚Äôve just slept with her mom.
---
Seriously?  Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
---
They have things in them! Interact with them via your Pipboy!
---
We get it some of us are single no need to rub it in.
---
So you make them and they give you something? Do you don‚Äôt have to hunt down Santa-scorched?
---
At last, new weapons for them
---
Where Bethesda removes everything instantly.  Yeah, no.
---
Mods on here are already bad enough.
---
Outerworlds was over rated, short, poorly paced, ripped off firefly entirely, featured weak combat, a mediocre story and relied on quippy one liners as "good dialogue" and had a terribly shallow weapon/armour pool, with an even more shallow mod pool, and exploration was pointless. 
---
I've spent more time building camps than I did playing OW to its end.
---
Gifts can be small, medium, or large. Bigger gift = better "reward". So far, it's been random alcohol, junk item (or 2), and usually a plan. I've picked up (from Santa scorched) or bought/crafted a few gifts and the plans were: mounted feral ghoul head, mounted brahmin head, t-51 helm mod (forget which one), and prime receiver for .50 cal.
---
Or, put a Wanted ad on the Market.  Provided you have some caps stock piled, you‚Äôll likely have a full set by the end of the day.
---
O man, it‚Äôs all fucked up.
---
Thanks. That‚Äôs encouraging to read.
---
"Scanning for good lit-tle Boyz and Girlz ...... None could be found ;( " hahahahaha
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda.  They never say what they mean.
---
I found one in helvetia (sp?)
---
Nope. It will be "fixed sometime before Wastelanders", according to the vague as fuck response Bethesda is giving.
---
Tell that to McDonald‚Äôs and the McRib
---
Not really sure. Prize quality I guess?
---
How can the failing be evident if you didn't know what the piece does and you had to ask other people for information about it?
---
Royal fuck up.

Haha I like it

It‚Äôs to complete a possum badge. The plasma plans are super rare

Thanks for the info!

I paid between 470-15xx?  I run about 5 charisma, with hard bargain 3.
---
After crafting at tinker, gifts will be in AID tab.
---
The one i saw had a flaming sword, and jingle bells. It was awesome!!!
---
I hope if that works for anyone they post a confirmation here
---
And yet it could be a burning bag of dog shit , yet still be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than this broken ass, p2w mess. 
---
That‚Äôs the irony.
---
You're right, I should of used the word "negativity" instead of hate.  I certainly don't hate the co. or anyone specifically that works there, I just figured the majority on here would generally take the title's meaning as.. yet another angry customer.
---
As stated, they continue doing business this way, they won't see another dime out of me.  Didn't think of it as an ultimatium at the moment, another described it as a "threat", lol, it's just a promise.  One I do intend following up on, will my decision to not give them another cent hurt their bottom line?  No.  At this point we all know Wastelanders will be the make or break for them.
---
The secret is that you and most other people are not their target audience. They specifically want to target people like whales and impulse control issues. That‚Äôs why prices are high and ‚Äúsales‚Äù are limited in duration.
---
So some time in 2022, then.
---
This is the cap-sink method. ;)
---
They (Bethesda) are already aware and are, as of yet unannounced when, will be rolling back the +250DR reload fix that caused more issues than it solved.
---
That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing. All these posts are misleading
---
I‚Äôm looking for the stable server one, so I can regift it back to bethesda.
---
Spiral staircases. Or anything that fits in a 1x1 square.
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a dumpster fire at the moment.

Yeah, exactly.

Those you gotta pay cash for.  You know it.  Don‚Äôt act surprised.
---
It doesn't get easier. Normall get the camp defense perk and craft stronger turrets, but right now a bug has them either going aggro on your own camp, even your character, or mobs spawn in the ground directly under your camp so the turrets continue to try to shoot at them. Even if it means blowing up parts of your camp in the process. Just try moving your camp elsewhere and see if you have issues there.
---
Do the legendary scorched drop legendary items and the gifts?
---
Yep, it's an absolute gold mine.
---
I just figure out where the things spawn and just concentrate my turrets there
---
When I played on console and had a low FOV it would make my head hurt sometimes
---
They say they want to fix it "sometime before Wastelanders", which means they have until April, assuming they don't push back Wastelanders again.
---
That's not why they're called hotfixes. They're hotfixes because they don't need to bring the servers down. They still absolutely have to go through the approval process.
---
I play on high FOV on PC, that could be it too.
---
u/yabvone
---
mess with the FoV slider a bit, idk what else. I think someone had a post awhile back about there being two different types of Blur in the game and you can edit them in custom ini, ill see if I can find it.
---
What we really need is 1000 more posts about the same thing.
---
Me
---
Totally RNG. My plan is to try to figure out the highest density locations of static scorched spawns to have a pattern of running
---
Secret is max firepower, overlapping fire arcs and positioning the turrets at an elevated position so they engage the enemy at a greater distance from your camp. 
---
I have 4 middle launchers and 6 heavy lasers on the roofs of my buildings. From any given direction I have 4-5 turrets that engage the enemy when they spawn.
---
Genuinely didn't see one, but thanks for taking the time to respond so passive aggressively :)
---
Not to poo poo those that are hoping for the reloading dr fix, but, as a bloodied sniper, fixing that has no effect on my play but the new bugs do.
---
I swear... I'm exhausted *for* Bethesda.
---
I have been playing for a year and have never really figured out the best way to set turrets up to defend the camp.  I just figured someone might have a life hack I hadn't heard about. lol
---
No, it's $259 per *month*.
---
I play on 90. I have motion blur and dof off. Also I'm using reshade
---
That could help, thanks for the effort
---
Damn straight.  Dirty bastards.

I dunno how to zone in on a specific post, but just scroll down a bit and youll see it.
---
‚ÄúShould not‚Äù in Toddanease means ‚Äúyou definitely will‚Äù.
---
I guess being level 38 without any legendary armor has a benefit for now lol
---
I have the tier 2 turrets set up and I also put some mutfruit plants in front of them to "distract" the mongrels.  A month ago I bought the concrete tire set and stacked them to make a platform for the turret to set up on.  Would setting up a spotlight increase the range of the turrets?
---
"Have you seen my elves?.. No seriously.. I fear for their safety."
---
Right, while I think 76 is a prime example of how to royally f@#$ up a game, this is pure pandering, just like when EA got worst company of the year over BP, who was *literally killing people*, all because they botched the ending of Mass Effect 3. Fallout 1st doesn't even begin to compare to selling the promise of ships at some time in the future for hundreds of dollars each.
---
And Melodicmutiny immediately wins the ‚Äúunderstatement of the year‚Äù award
---
Did they touch your no-no hole? You seem to be obsessed over this.
---
You leave our IT dept (ok, Harry). You leave Harry alone!

He works his ass off 2 hours a day, 3, maybe 4 days a week trying to keep these hamsters running.

He deserves better!  Poor Harry.   *insert link to Harry‚Äôs Go fund me page*
---
This might not be the most helpful response but if you have a friend that knows the plan they can build it for you at your camp.
---
I know man it's annoying the biggest issue for me is the weight situation when unyeilding drops off with my bloodied commando which in turn affects my ap for vats I've been using my junkie commando although the bug effects vanguards as well which is what hes wearing it's only dr er so it's not as game breaking
---
That's not even mentioning the multiple game breaking bugs OW features including a few that literally stop you from completing the end of the game...
---
Or that wonderful prologue bug that instead of telling you a companions post game blurb.... Says the didn't survive....even though there are alive.... Even in game difficulties where it's literally impossible for them to die.
---
That game fell off the map quick. Go check how desolate their sub is. 
---
Plus your criticism lacks substance.
---
Play it at 80 fov in third person. You can use the middle mouse button (hold it) and pull back on the mouse to zoom out in third too.
---
Yeah...and if someone says they will but doesn‚Äôt that many times previously, what do you think you can expect from them this time?
---
If it's still giving you that message when trying to connect to a server then you need to exit the game and then verify game files in the Bethesda launcher.
---
 Before wastelanders refers to the 250 DR bug. They are going to roll back the patch so 250 doesn‚Äôt work again since that was caused the armor issue. They plan to fix the reload bug before wastelanders. I expect to see the armor fixed within the next few days
---
Tbh I don‚Äôt know if the spot light does anything for other turrets.
---
To the point, lol.
---
A lot of people are running around with duped legacy energy explosives. Not much you can do to defend against that. Apparently, they ignore explosive resist.
---
Your best defense is to max out the budget so it costs them 100 caps to contest. You should also stay crouched to hide on the minimap and be quick to grab resources. You don't want to stick around your workshop any longer than a minute. Blueprints can help to quickly setup a workshop. I usually just do the extractor with the generator sitting on top of it.
---
Most people won't take a workshop if nobody is home. Those that do usually leave the server when they get bored.
---
Yessss, thank you.
---
I've heard that cat actually tastes pretty rancid.
---
Omfg, the game lacks substance and everything I said is 100% true.  
---
Idiot.
---
*"Where are my little elves? No seriously I fear for their safety."*
---
They can just get the loot bag that looks like a present and place one
---
Mothman=war hero???  Can you really tell what‚Äôs in that pa?
---
Of them.   Of them.
---
I might have to try it out. Thanks for the replies though!
---
Piss people off and take your cash.
---
Motion blur, head bobbing, and DoF all do it to me. Copied a custom .ini file on day one to get rid of all that and it's all fine for me now. Don't use any mods at all, but if I couldn't use a custom .ini, I'd quit the game.
---
I got 4 at Morgantown airport in one trip, and zero at Point Pleasant. They are just random. So far, nothing good, but there's still time to get wowwed. Has anyone found Plasma Grenade plans yet? I wonder if the gift drop rate is like the regular one.
---
The ones that drop presents have xmas attire on
---
The trick is to not restart after you crash the game.  Your doing it wrong.
---
Do you know which custom ink you're using?
---
3 weeks? Is it not just 4 days.
---
For new players, an event called Leader of the Pack pops up frequently in the Northwest part of the map.  This event will drop 3 legendary items levels 5 and 10.  Do this event whenever you see it.  Sometimes the legendaries are crap, other times really good stuff.  For instance, a lvl 5 Regenerating armor piece is wonderful.  Level 5 bloodied pipe pistol, maybe not so much.  Still, the event is worth doing every time.  jmho
---
A few things - as u/sly_1 mentioned, the game likes to irradiate you. Food, Beverages, attacks, environment...it all adds up and suddenly your 19% health is more like 10% health. I've left Uranium Fever with a health pool of 2 HP. And while Rad-Away (diluted) can give you a quick boost, it comes with the painful drawback of -50% disease resist for a massive 2 hours. And in a game where disease is rampant, that's nasty.
---
There's also the fact that if you die (and you will), the game will reset you closer to 30%. Meaning you need to find more radiation sources to get back down to Nerd Rage range.
---
I love bloodied since I switched, and it's a lot of fun (when it's not broken by patches). However, it's an investment in terms of gear (several legendary items) and perks (a few of which aren't really useful outside this build) and it's not a low maintenance playstyle either.
---
"Shake like a wiggly bowl full of jelly" makes me laugh
---
The only reason I still play this game is because of all the reasons you stated.  I laugh when I see posts along the lines of; 'there's nothing left to do in this game, I'm uninstalling etc.'  For all of it's misgivings, it still is very entertaining, most of the time I am enjoying my time playing,.. the other day though inspired this post unfortunately.  I left out an important part of the story, see the part where I mentioned the body vanishing?  Have you ever killed a legendary to have the body disappear on you?  Have you ever walked up to it and saw what it was carrying before it happened??  This.  And it was a 'Bloodied Handmade'- those are the words I saw, and the gun I've been wanting for weeks now.  I haven't felt rage like that while playing a game in quite sometime.  I searched for that body for about an hour at least. =/ I'll never know whether it was a 1*, 3*, all I know is that- for me to read earlier in the day how this issue was fixed and then experience that^ later at night, yeah, beyond angry.
---
Stealth mode in water and don‚Äôt walk in shallow areas.  The last is the worst but if you go too far out of water it fails. 
---
Shit design as always.
---
Just answering the question you asked ;)
---
i got the ever elusive plans for plasma grenade from holiday gift box. Also got some mounted creature plans :)
---
This just goes to show you, no matter what Bethesda does, people are going to complain.
---
I've actually never had that happen to me.  But I can understand. Seeing the words come up then *poof*.  I have noticed when I kill stuff with plasma the body sort of shifts or teleports. But more than like 5 feet. Never fully disappeared on me.
---
I went to Tyler County Fair Grounds, got 2 there. Made my way down to point pleasant and got 3 more
---
I got 4 at Morgantown airport
---
Nice, now I uninstall the game and I‚Äôm downloading again!, so if the problem still I‚Äôm going to do that, thanks!!
---
Nope. The first Legendary Santa Scorched I took down came at me with a Bear Arm and when I looted his corpse it game me a 1/* Forest Scout Left Leg and a sledgehammer.
---
It's a "rare" spawn at vendors, if you go to most of the Responders vendors they'll have them
---
You are right there is always a post like this after every patch
---
Get handy with mrs deathclaw?
---
That's a different type of product, and you do have a choice of where you can go to eat. The atom store is the only place where you can buy those items.
---
If you did not know those items were coming back to the store in x weeks/months then you are being pressured into buying more atoms to make that purchase. Of course people like us that have been playing Fo76 for months do know they will come back, but think about all the others that don't know this.
---
Its tied to the new bugged durability decrease, basically put, they managed to patch in a older version of the game...or at least that is my most competent answer for this weeks...patch
---
I love that game
---
Console Master Race
---
I can see the Overseer's camp from mine and I'm attacked constantly, and it can from 3 different directions. Been in that spot for 130 levels. I have two turrets on the roof but they get fully destroyed sometimes. Anecdotally, I've noticed when I replace my turrets with new ones, they do a better job than the old ones for a while. I have absolutely no evidence to support this, but it makes me wonder whether condition is an issue with turrets like it is with regular weapons (less degraded, better performance).
---
You could be correct, I may have misinterpreted the verbiage when I read it.  I just looked on their site just now, there happens to be 4 different posts on patch 15 (and I'm not even sure I read it in that patch.)
---
I'm currently using four pieces of Unyeilding and one LifeSaving piece.  Originally I put on the life saving piece because it had AP refresh - but now I'm hooked on it.  50% chance to revive myself upon death.  And what's better, enemies generally walk away after "killing" you.  This gives you a chance to revive, return to caution, and ambush with a sneak attack.  I've been wanting to replace the LifeSaver with a Chameleon piece with weapon weight reduction...I just can't bring myself to do it; it works that good.
---
2 weeks. December 12 - 26.
---
Omg, mr 15 post, new Redditor straight out of Bethesda‚Äôs office starts a post like this?
---
Are you guys even trying anymore?
---
Fo76 is essentially just a modded Fo4. anything that applies to Fo4 also applies to Fo76.
---
You will cry and trade away your soul while you try to obtain good bloodied weapons and unyielding armor.  The bigger problem to bloodied is obtaining the gear.
---
Just happy I could help find it, had a hard time finding pieces myself lol
---
Oh I musta read it wrong. Whats the 4 day event then NW?
---
Shitty.
---
id rather play my pc but id also rather play a fair game?? common sense competive games on pc are the equivlant to putting your balls in a vendor complete dogshit
---
I wonder if the will start hiding the new mounted heads in weird or obscene situations much like they do with the teddy bears when wastelanders comes out.  I still want to see a mounted wendingo in a porta potty.
---
‚ÄúOnce I hit level 100‚Äù good lord I gave up around level 20 something
---
Hey lol I‚Äôve had reddit for almost a year now tbh but lol haha. My cake day is coming up lol
---
‚ÄúHo, ho, oh no what happened everyone has died!‚Äù Had me rolling
---
Exactly.  And how long has fo76 been out...math sir.  The maths against you. 
---
Don‚Äôt be so obvious next time.
---
That could be.  I might try the punji boards right around their spawn point and let the turrets shoot them up.  The problem I think is that they run up to the tires I have them on and then they can't be hit.  Thanks for the reply!
---
Games dead.
---
Maybe do some searches or get onto Reddit more often so you see stuff.
---
I'm up to a to of 8 now so id say keep going üëçüëçüëç

It was extended to the 31st per today‚Äôs inside the vault
---
Its only day 1 and i 2 hrs? In so im not stopping gf gonna be pissed calling iut of work sick too wish it started same day as up date tbh. When my days off started. Lol
---
Just found 4 Legendaries inside of Gauley Mine. Cat and Fox head plans. Three 1* and one 2* legendaries. This is a great event for scrip.
---
PS4. Thx anyway mate
---
Anyone know anything about gift wrap
---
I love this game, but jesus.  How embarrassing for Bethesda.
---
Oh haha yeah I get you lol, but if I was working for Bethesda (which i don‚Äôt, I operate a clothing store In San Antonio Texas) I‚Äôd push fallout first a whole lot more hehe
---
I'm not saying it's illogical, they're definitely going the right way about this.
---
the problem is that the Fo76 devs are likely too inept to pull it off.
---
I never said there was an excuse. You took me saying the solution for this issue should be simple, and turned that into a way to promote your imaginary expertise as a coding specialist/modder. 
---
Get over yourself dude.
---
Thanks for the info. Always been curious
---
Truly my fault for not browsing this subreddit as much as others do. Haven't been around lately and was pretty upset to see this (and other bugs) upon my return. Same old community though I see...
---
Just found 3 in there, definitely worth it!
---
Turret setup varies location to location. My first camp was by the junkyard south east of vault 76. It got regular raids of low level ghouls, super mutants, and scortch but typically did pretty well without much repair cost. They were not difficult to take out.
---
I kept concrete walls and blockades around my perimeter, and found that was typically targeted first. Wasnt difficult to repair because concrete deposit was at junkyard workshop so I was able to get more easy. I then set up a couple platforms with minigun turrets and spotlights. Someone said spotlights increase range and targeting ability of turrets, and they were correct.
---
I set them up north, south, east, and west in my camp and was pretty well protected with minimal regular repairs.
---
My worst spot was north of fort defiance on the mountain side. I had rockets all over my roof so I could farm on scortch and SBs, with occasional legendary spawns, plus be there for line in the sand event, and funny thing was repairs to the BoS missle launcher mounted there was cheaper than repairing my own rocket turrets, I could also build a catapult for myself, bramin, and scrapbot.
---
Stupidest idea ever. Lvl 68 scortch constantly spawn, and even before my own turret defenses would turn against me they would constantly aim down trying to shoot at the mob spawns and blow my camp to shit. It was awesome when I would get to use the location to farm legendaries but that got old and expensive really fast.
---
I recently located a couple different ore deposits in a single camp area by solomns pond, and not much spawns there. Plenty of junk resources in the area, already has one of every craft station close by, plus a behemoth spawn in the pond that can be legendary. It saves my budget space, lots of resources, and seems pretty ideal for my current needs.
---
Yeah.  I won't ding them for *lying* by saying that.  Just on a personal level, to me, lying is a big accusation so I won't normally accuse someone of that unless I'm sure they intended to deceive.  If they say "We fixed something that can lead to [x]" I'll take it at face value.
---
But anyway, what they SHOULD do when they fix something that can lead to [x] is play the shit out of the game afterward to make sure that nothing else is also producing that same unintended thing.  The amount of testing that they do is obviously inadequate, as this patch and past ones indicates.  I can't say how much effort they're making, but whatever it is clearly isn't enough.  
---
I love the game and I'm not on the Bethesda hate train, but man oh man do they not make sure something's right before pushing it out.  I've written a zillion lines of code in my career and I'm not going to lie and say I've never sent anything out incorrect.  But it's NEVER taken me more than a day or two to fix the biggest blunders I've ever made.  Mistakes happen, but when they stick around for months and then you finally "fix" it and the fix breaks other stuff...there's something wrong over there.
---
Now I'm ranting and it has little to do with your comment.  Sorry.
---
Wow really?? I know what I‚Äôm doing tonight!
---
I recomend starting off with the adrenal mutation.  It provides a low health damage boost to any weapon.  Three points into Nerd Rage as well.  If that's working for you, then start looking for everything else.
---
A bloodied handmade may take time to aquire, you're right about that, but there are plenty of other weapons less coveted and still very  powerful.  CaptainNoob just put up a video soloing the SBQ with a bloodied pipe pistol.
---
That‚Äôs called scarcity... it may be artificial but it‚Äôs the same concept. It‚Äôs pretty basic marketing. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúshady‚Äù. Limited time things return all the time in pretty much any industry outside of maybe high end fashion.
---
God, imagine being able to sell those Quest Reward Boxes.
---
I'm getting major Card Pack that MIGHT have the ultra rare card from 15 years ago vibes and I honestly kinda love it
---
I think sometimes ppl take a comment too personally or a way it was not intended and then accuse the commentor of jumping to a conclusion that they are lying.. anywho..1st does not give any advantage to drops or graphics. I am entitled to my opinion as you are to yours. But I call bullshit on you getting all of those drops in a month and a half.
---
its both actually, they are incompetent and they do not care
---
Wow. Cripplingly thorough critique.
---
The problem is that actually for bugs and broken balance u are forced to play in only a way making every other thing way less effective and frustrating to play; as always this forum is useless and full of sarcastic poor comments. Will keep me away from it.
---
Yeah you do... you have 800lbs x4, i'll admit it's easier for me since i can just trade with my wife, but it's doable. You're no hoarded if you have 5 sheds and only use 1 :P
---
2x exp weekend too... i bet you want to try another build.
---
Oof maybe patched idk ive tried breaking my armor with acid node before and it worked but that was a while back
---
Also the little farm between the overseer's camp and vault 76
---
I don't and and nowhere near my own pc right now. I know I found it here on reddit, but this was like the day after the game was released. I can say there's one you can get from nexus, that's just the file, not a mod:
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32?tab=files](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32?tab=files) 
---
A quick check here comes up with a post primarily about editing the specific fields we're talking about here (of course using a full copy of the regular .ini, editing the fields, and making that you custom one):
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wrx8g/how\_to\_turn\_off\_depth\_of\_field\_distant\_textures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wrx8g/how_to_turn_off_depth_of_field_distant_textures/) 
---
But there are all sorts of .ini file guides and cut/paste ones out there that can cover a lot more than that, like increasing the save interval timing, which I don't think the one I'm using has.
---
Alright thanks.
---
It‚Äôs an unmarked quest, look up ‚Äúfallout 76 grafton pawn shop opened‚Äù on google and you should find a post about it or a guide

Apparently the guy killed me with a 10mm pistol. In one shot. I dont know what Legacy means... but I am guessing ita different from Legendary? He could have been trolling but it just seems a little weird that you can be one shot so easily. I had literally zero chance. Ahh well. I'll just avoid flagging for pvp for now and figure out where to go from here.
---
Thanks for this post, I was on the fence. Now all I gotta do is find some bloodied 1 handed and bloodied rifles
---
the game is just trash hun, thats all it is
---
I have a camp there. It is just north of the train station. There are stairs that lead up to it. Cool spot to build but can be a little tough to place things but the little coffee shop and Murgle (the cats name) make it worth it.
---
Is it ANY fissure site...I went to the one southwest of whitespring and nothing!
---
I'm not too worried about folks getting another crack at the halloween rewards ...but I'm annoyed that when the christmas rewards come I wont have 2x exp to make grinding for the new stuff bearable .
---
There was a post about this like 2 hours ago search psa in the tab bunch of locations on that thread
---
you certainly come across as someone defending their ineptitude. and not just in this particular conversation, mind you. I'm simply calling it as I see it.
---
not to mention that, what you actually implied was that the backwards "fix" your perceived, to "force our characters to do soft "resets", was the simplest fix, which is wrong.
---
but hey, don't take my word for it. like I said multiple times by now, these tools and documentation are easily available to anyone. you can confirm the Fo76 devs are incompetent yourself.
---
Some can be downright nice.  It's encouraging when it happens.
---
Post is saved, thanks!!
---
Not bad Bethez, not bad! Sure beats the Halloween crash fest lol. But i still think you guys are using holidays to test things ;)  
---
Iv'e yet to come across a disappearing "Cinder Claws" but oh... i'm watchin for it!   
---
I'm.   
---
watchin.   
---
for it!
---
Inside the vault said as soon as possible. Never said today.
---
I know
---
Start with the Adrenal mutation and nerd rage - no cost damage multipliers!   And your quite welcome, as that was a big part of my motivation to start the post.   I hope you find Bloodied as rewarding as I have.
---
Hold The Line event. It's A Trap too.

Tamed animals need to get buffed or made immune... Such a pain to have them die when you're not around.
---
hun Todd just pumped out a big steaming ass log on your face and you have the audacity to complain!? you sniff that log and you lick it to please daddy todd
---
Yeah, it's not guaranteed they'll be there. But I'm getting at least one every fast travel. And have had upto 3, great way to farm scrip atm.
---
Or, people like you will except anything their given from Bethesda, no matter how poor the quality. But I guess we should support their business practices. Like the data breech. Canvas bags. Plastic cola. Broken games. Over priced atom shop. Lack of content. Sure, sounds good.
---
I like it kind of pendulums, with several Flatwoods being balanced out by a Morgantown or two. Terrific fun
---
How I do that?
---
It basically is. With FO1st you can put stuff in a world container, switch characters, and pick it up. I do it everyday. One of the best features, but it should be simpler and available to everyone.
---
Spotlight Turrets enhance the detection/engagement distance of existing turrets, so I always pair a turret with a spotlight.  The only issue is spotlights sometimes bug out when you fast travel away and return, so they have to be power-cycled to reset, so you should connect them to a switch circuit that you can turn off and on.
---
ESO does the same garbage. "gotsta gets it now suckas!"   
---
OH and if you want to talk SHADY... before a big roll out of new items, like say... Christmas, that they know everyone is saving for... they'll put sales on the stuff that's most popular lol, just to clear your atoms out so you reach for that wallet come Christmas time. HAPPY HOLIDAYS üòÅ
---
I'm not sure how it works but I imagine the licensing for some of these songs is actually ridiculous. The companies that own these songs have a stranglehold almost every place they might be used. You can't even have the radio on in some places without paying a SOCAN fee.
---
I can mod it for you in a half hour or so buddy. Just cooking supper. My gt is Fishing4halibut send me a message and I‚Äôll help you out when I get on
---
Now is working!!!!
---
If this was implemented I would leave messages outside the vault for new users telling them to uninstall the game and issue a chargeback against bethesda for fraud with their bank
---
Mod. Not nod
---
Only played during my lunch, like 30 minutes, but I only found 1, and it was from a location that normally I check for "tame-able" spawned creatures. 
---
Was that radio tower in the south, where normally a tame-able  deathclaw might spawn.
---
I feel like anything that old is either completely airtight or fully public domain
---
Zombie Santa Claus with a fire katana. Nice
---
Should have turned Pacifist off, collected that bounty.
---
Also the cheapest and most effective barrier for camp protection is Blackberry Bushes.  I plant them along my perimeter and they are more effective and nicer looking than having barricades and walls, cheaper to repair too.  The enemy AI will always rush the closest crop/power/water source, so the bushes act as both bait and a speedbump for my turrets to engage while the enemies attack the bushes.
---
Accurate
---
I want that snowflake suit...I hope it is in the atom shop soon.
---
Also mag not clip
---
Well I mean tbf they do have quite a bit of Bing/Bob Crosby songs, so I'd imagine the license to use them must not be all that expensive. Especially since we've had Civilization for the past 3 games.
---
Thank you... I'll message you now..
---
Yeah they seem to employ all of the shady methods to make cash, like sales on popular things just before a huge atom shop update... but then they don't do the SMART and NOBLE thing like you said, get people into the shop with low prices whatsitdoodles! I mean... they really are inept in several ways. I can't even really blame the ragebait youtubers because Bethez just gives them a massive target constantly.
---
have you tried the uninstall the piece of shit game build yet?
---
Plans or caps or booze or toys or or coal or all the above plus more.  Most of the plans are new/uncommon/rare/expensive. I've personally seen plans for new mounted heads, power armor mods and prime weapon mods.  I've heard of plasma grenade plans and new xmas themed camp plans but I haven't confirmed those.  I've also got beers,  coal,  a couple of moon monkeys and 500 and 50 cap rewards, plus some coal.
---
Friendly reminder that you can get gifts from holiday scorched wherever you find regular scorched or your Santatron plus you can make your own with holiday paper.  It costs a pretty penny tho (1500 caps for the good stuff) but it makes 2 presents with Chemist  equipped. (Don't think super duper works tho.  I've crafted 12 presents and no dupes yet.)
---
Use it to craft gifts at a Tinkers workbench
---
Oh it definitely works... it's just shitty lol. Ask Nintendo.
---
 If you use ammo smith or super duper when making plasma cores you will make 1 and a partial charge one
---
it was a box filled with Tards shit
---
Haha. Great point. Thanks.
---
All you're doing is quoting me, and then going off in left field, yanking your own pud. Did your mum not love you enough as a child? Do you need validation?
---
course its fucking broken this is bethesda
---
This!  x1000.  I eyeroll everytime someone calls a magazine a 'clip'.
---
Does that work tho? I crafted 9 presents with Chemist and Super Duper equipped and I got -0- dupes. Could be I'm just unlucky but I'm not sure that works.
---
Don't brag
---
We use "legacy" when we talk about explosive energy legendary weapons. The explosive effect was removed from legendary energy weapons a long time ago because it did not work as intended. The explosion is considered energy damage and thus ignores fireproof and dense chest mods. 
---
I had a guy give me an explanation. He shot the floor next to me with an explosive gatling gun. Fireproof and dense reduced the damage to zero. He did the same with a gatling plasma and it did full damage to me. We have an epidemic of these weapons thanks in part to duping items. It is an arms race mentality now. Everyone else has one, if I want to stand a chance, I will need one as well. That is what people think anyways. 
---
As for the pistol, you can totally kill someone so fast you would think you are being one shot by it. With faster fire rate legendary effect, an automatic 10mm fires about 9 rounds per second. If your damage build is sorted, you can hit that 110 PVP damage cap easily. Within one second, he can hit you for a total of 990 damage. In half a second, 495 damage. You can see how easy it is to incorrectly perceive that amount for damage so quickly as being one shot by something.
---
If you are playing this game you are either single or soon will be.
---
its when you hear the in game of audio of Todd shitting and masterbating into a shitty xbox microphone
---
Ohh, I know Murgle, I was hoping for one I could tame and take home. I'm rather attached to my camp location. Thanks though.
---
Do you actually put items in the gift box?  Or is it just a gag?
---
Or you could run Junkies - obtain weapons easier - not worry about dying so much and needing all the tanking perks.  Bloodied is nice but IMO overrated - too many people stuck wanting to play the same meta.
---
While I enjoy my one bloodied build I have 3 fully equipped Junkies builds - and it‚Äôs taken next to forever to get a single matching set of 3* Unyielding armor and it‚Äôs still not the perfect set yet.
---
Bloodied is a royal PITA build to gear up.
---
Clip. 
---
Clip
---
Yeah... We know... The event has started...
---
I haven't gotten on to play the new update yet (finals week!) But I'm hoping.
---
Hopefully I can come back later and confirm, or maybe someone else can.
---
Guy gets a pile of shit a year late for christmas and is happy there are some edible nuts in it.
---
Fabulous.
---
We also can't display the Jumbo Mr. Fuzzy that you can buy from Camden. I've been holding it in my vending machine for max caps, so that I don't scrap it...
---
Great to hear, hopefully this rollback happens sooner rather than later.
---
you dont need to know because the event will be broken and wont be completable, remember Todd is a tard
---
But do they drop those weapons when they die? If not, it's pointless (in my opinion).
---
i think he had it on
---
Yes.  The problem is the games fucjing broken on a fundamental level and obviously, very obviously, run by incompetent idiots.  
---
Post. Don‚Äôt post. Play. Don‚Äôt play.  It changes nothing.  The game will die soon enough.
---
Do they look different than normal scorched or have different name identifiers?
---
you would literally gain more worth out of that money by burning it for warmth
---
Whoa! Hey now... little kids play this game.
---
the PA acid is highly likely to be fixed as that seems to be the same issue - it works fine until you reload and breaks as soon as you reload, and exit/reenter armor fixes it until you reload again.  
---
Weapon deterioration is likely a separate issue so who knows if it will get a fix.  Best bet as cheesy as it sounds is to submit a bug report and follow along with the feedback so they can hopefully identify the issue.
---
It's okay i got downvoted for asking a question
---
uninstall the game and issue a chargeback through your bank
---
Because they're using the scummy marketing trick of "Put items in the shop for a limited time, and also don't let players be able to earn enough Atoms to be able to buy the item(s) before it's gone, so players will be more incentivized to buy Atoms."
---
Believe me, I've made this request before. Many times. I know it won't happen though, because it'll cut into their profits. Plenty of other devs just leave their items in their game's cash shops and they're not hurting for profit. But Bethesda says fuck us I guess.
---
fissures.
---
Are you the guy who walks up to someone stomping a flaming bag of dog shit , and says, sir your comment ‚Äúthis is bullshit‚Äù has no substance.  Please write a 100 page thesis on why this burning bag of dog excrement is ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù.
---
I bet you are, you special snowflake- not that you‚Äôd understand the paper afterwards. 
---
Some of us get the obvious though, and don‚Äôt feel the need to entertain those more simple minds.
---
Thanks I appreciate the advice!
---
hm. i bought a plasma grenade plans for 9k caps from player vendor last time, it's not really worth much lately somehow, even before the event.
---
Someone had one as a workshop last night and it just stood there while being pummeled by a horde of ghouls lol
---
After this event i sure am! Just called out of work xD
---
I found and tamed a cat at the random encounter point at the random encounter point south of Thunder Mountain - you can spawn in at Braxon's Quality Medical Supplies and hike North to the lake until you find a downed plane
---
Yep.   How many posts later for that?
---
Don't say that, they'll introduce loot boxes next...
---
Yeah, I learned that the hard way in the raid the other day.
---
Being a separate issue is what I'm trying to discern. Customer support will result in me speaking to 3 different people and getting 5 different answers, and given they've told me previously they get little information from the devs, I'm hoping a community manager might have more information
---
of course not... its bethesda asshole, it will never be fixed, infact the next patch is going to make it so that everytime you reload your gun Todd Howards penis will slowly creep toward the center of the screen and if you dont click on it before it touches your reticle all your armor, power armor and weapons will be set to 0 durability and you will be banned from the game permanently
---
I prefer MIRV frags anyway. Cheap and easy and quite effective
---
&gt; Where are the hints for the packages?
---
They're in the note at the front door, but the biggest hints are the objects sitting in front of the board.  The pile of Charleston Heralds means search the Charleston Herald building, etc.  They're not always direct cluses, and sometimes they're hints that lead to secondary and tertiary locations, but that's the starting point.
---
Nice beaver!
---
Same here - was talking to someone in another thread about it before - would be neat to get some static mannequins for free and then we could maybe use the poses like the ones we have for photomode?
---
Pro tip
---
If your not shooting an M1 Garand, then its not a clip.
---
Of all the marketing techniques, this is the least shifty imo. Adding exclusivity for something cosmetic is harmless and valuable at the same time.
---
Of my three bloodied builds, only one has a full set of heavy leather Unyeilding, and it isn‚Äôt 3*.  The others are just hodgepodge of whatever I could find. So, I know exactly what you mean.  
---
What armor do you like with your junkies builds?  My latest char is level 27 or so and has yet to be determined.   Perhaps I should try a junkies build.  Do you have to keep using the drugs to maintain the ‚Äústate‚Äù?   Or is it, use the drugs to get hooked and then go for hours?   I‚Äôve never been clear on that part.  And I guess some drugs are better for a rifle/comando build than others?  Thanks
---
I am convinced that Fallout 76 is a Vault-Tec experiment researching how much abuse a player base can tolerate
---
Unless its a Garand.  then its ok =)
---
you're the one resorting to namecalling, not me. that's how you know someone is out of arguments. not that you had any valid ones to begin with.
---
but addressing the only one in your comment, **you** said these things, not me:
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure the "fix" was just to force our characters to do soft "resets"
---
&gt;Also, given that the more complex a fix is, the more likely it is to conflict with something else, it would make sense that they would go for the simplest fix.
---
you also posted this absolutely hilarious tidbit:
---
&gt;These bugs are the nature of the engine being used.
---
but like I said, you're free to check what I'm saying for yourself. but of course you won't, since it goes against what you want to believe.
---
Yeah, I never said I accepted anything. Thanks for projecting your hostility onto me, though.
---
At gf.
---
This is the exact opposite of a compelling argument. It comes off as very immature and vulgar. Quite the opposite of a a post that would gets ppls attention and make them pause to rethink their opinions or idea.
---
Also im sorry that you dislike this game, playerbase, and bethesda so much it makes you go on rants. 
---
Perhaps instead of focusing all your efforts on hate you should branch out and find a game or developer you do like and find contentment. Either way best of luck.
---
LOL
---
Can anyone explain the purpose of it? Cheers
---
that is so dumb!
---
except a lot of caps, that i do not have
---
Most of us on here enjoy the game. If you think playing a game is abusing yourself that is subjective and suggests you should stop playing said game. But by all means, hang around this subreddit and talk shit about it, it's really helpful.
---
The cave where the door to vault 79 is also looks amazing. The mixture of lighting and fog is incredible
---
its to piss you off because when Todd hurts the people who trust him and give him money it causes his penis to become erect
---
I know i came from the military and i love hearing people now days say clip in my mind im judging them so hard lol üòÜ
---
This comment is hilarious. Thank you for this, honestly.
---
Well, yea!   Cause the Garand uses an 'en-bloc clip'.  SKS's use clips!  Most people just don't understand the difference between a clip and a magazine!
---
Yeah, it's insane. Good thing they released those sinks on the Atom Shop that re-hydrate you... :eyeroll:
---
Why would you wear non-legendary armor? Why make it?
---
Where the fuck did anyone kill a gorilla lol
---
I got the sloth :)
---
Confirmed...ish.  I have mine maxed out and went through about 10 and got nada.  Awesome knowing chemist works though!
---
I didn‚Äôt hear an explosion, but I definitely took some random damage while just standing there and that startled me a bit
---
Are the gifts actually in the boxes? If so how do you find the boxes (small gift for example) in your inventory?
---
Been good for me 2-5 per run.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Yes they‚Äôre in the boxes (three different sizes) which you loot from the Christmas Scorched!
---
Yeah, the santa ones are always legendary. Sometimes they're wearing a blue snowy suit though which looks cool.
---
I have good luck in the Glassed Cavern.
---
"except anything their given". Can't argue with that, cuz it makes no sense at all
---
uhhhh
---
Well, technically the SKS doesnt use a clip, it uses an internal magazine.  
---
But people use stripper clips to load as it speeds up the process.  The stripper clip is not the mechanism that feeds the gun unlike the Garand that houses the entire clip as its feed mechanism.   Stripper clips are basically speedloaders for internal box magazines.   
---
You can still load the internal magazine manually one at a time. 
---
A true clip fired gun has the entire clip mounted inside the gun.  Hense the PING that you hear when the garand is empty. its ejected automatically.  This doesnt happen with the SKS.
---
I own both, SKS is a stripper clip fed internal magazine.
---
I thought I could only build near my base?
---
It‚Äôs a material used in crafting your own holiday gift boxes
---
are you cooking the halibut?
---
I would talk to a therapist about these memories
---
Ah, so many memories!
---
Large, medium or small gift? Are you on PC?
---
I have a camp set up in whitesprings specifically where a bunch of ghouls spawn cos I regularly get legendaries from there. All my turrets are up high and concentrated mainly towards the spawn points. Now, my camp used to get wrecked alot so I've had to experiment. I've got concrete barriers set up all around my camp, in front of those I've got punji boards and in front of those I've got a few camp fires. 
---
Ghouls just run up and attack the fires then move through to the barriers. The whole time they're getting whumped by turrets and punji boards. and they're not damaging anything other than what I put there. 
---
Bottom line, create a kill zone, place something in that zone to slow them down and occupy them and have your turrets up high and looking in that zone. You're going to spend camp budget repairing but in my example, it's predominantly just concrete, steel and wood, something I can farm easily. 
---
Good luck.
---
Fair enough!   I've just always used SKS's with stripper clips, so it's hand-in-hand for me.  Terminology-wise, I'd never fault someone for saying 'clip' in reference to a SKS or a Garand.  But the number of people that ignorantly refer to magazine's as 'clips' makes me grimace and wince.
---
My question is whether anyone had found the Mounted Scorchbeast queen head yet
---
Wow great explanation. Thank you. I think I have a tse cryolator somewhere heh. I wonder if that counts for what you're describing above.
---
Jeez. 9 rounda a second. That's insane. Cool... but insane. Insane cool. But yeah when I meant one shot I assumed it was more than one hit... but I learned so much from that reply. Like a 110 pvp damage cap. So are you saying that if you had say... an instigating AP gauss rifle and you sneak attack headshot someone it would still only do 110 dmg?
---
I love specifics like this, yet people get all pissy when I point out things like **you're\***
---
Remember to lock your boy up if you want to keep your presents safe
---
Yeah just spent a couple hours doing it, got more legendarys and gifts than I can shake a stick at. Not to mention with the double xp right now even the scorched are worth decent xp.
---
What do you do with the gift boxes? Is it basically just to drop stuff for people?
---
I can mod it for you in 10-15 minutes if the other guy hasn‚Äôt helped you yet
---
You Craft it and then open it to get rewards from the same pool that the holiday scorched drop. Apparently large ones can drop rare plans.
---
It drives me nuts too.  As you can see, im not firearm illiterate.
---
Haha. This made me LOL
---
https://imgur.com/rEgp92I

You buy it and craft the gifts at a tinker work bench
---
Hey give my potato internet a chance .. living in the middle of nowhere takes its toll on its delicate little heart
---
I dont.. I'll put my hands up.
---
Not tn buddy lol
---
How has no one mentioned Poseidon in any of these posts? There 50+ low level scorched in the area, and the presents don't appear to be level dependent.
---
Great shot!   My favorite loading screens are always the quiet landscape pictures I've taken of the gorgeous environments.
---
It's kind of the point of the Armor though.
---
This guy gets it.
---
You want to fix the gaming industry? Stop giving the bad apes like Activision/Blizzard, Bethesda and EA your money. That's the ONLY way.
---
I get where you're coming from, I just doubt there will be any difference. I took a break from the game for about 5 months starting last spring, and I've returned to find that the game is better in a few ways, but the overall situation hasn't really changed. I'm ok with it for now, but who knows what will happen if Wastelanders goes wrong. xD
---
Belching Betty has a bunch too.
---
Camden Park has a few hanging about.
---
I'm like that with people who don't use commas LOL
---
The Mounted Scorchbeast Queen Head and Mounted Scorchbeast Head are not drops in the current Event. They aren't on any drop lists currently.
---
This should be fixed on the +250DR rollback planned for "soon"
---
But dont hold your breath.  Just use a different set of PA right now if the voices drive you nuts.  You could also change your skin until its fixed.
---
Dibs on the second plasma grenade plan you get üòú
---
Alright sounds good I‚Äôll be on that later!
---
I only bought mine to annoy my teammates.
---
I‚Äôm feeling there could have been a lot more clarity around how this was supposed to witk
---
Got mine from regular, though all gifts have a chance at obtaining a random head plan
---
Yeah. I just replayed it. You are right.
---
Hahahaha
---
  I was in L45 Excavator with a targeting HUD (the hud outlines enemies (including turrets) in red.))  For bots, either AA or troubleshooter weapon are very effective.
---
  It likely helped that I have healing factor mutation, so as soon as the bots in the room were eliminated, heath popped back to 100 without stimpacks.  
---
  My first was the one closest to toxic valley.  
---
FWIW, Tactics wise, I crouched, moved slow, and used corners/walls to block.  Peek around to locate the turret(s).  Pre-aim the weapon.  edge out from behind cover, take several shots, go back to cover.  Repeat until turret and bots are dead.  Move to the next room and repeat.  
---
The hardest room for me was repairing the reactor pipes (actually, finding all the leaks was the hardest part) while the repair bots were shooting at me.  Think that took 4 tries before I got it in the time limit.
---
Thanks.
---
Good to know thanks!
---
\*puts on my tinfoil hat\* pre war synth gorillas

True but It kinda get old after awhile

I asked about this a couple days ago.

Someone made a ref to FO4, and said there was a gorilla head on the wall at the hunting lodge in toxic valley.
---
Me too. Haha
---
I wish we could just turn them off.

Playing with no sound puts you at a serious disadvantage. A headset will give you an advantage. Even if you don't talk. I mute my tv and can still hear from my headset.

Care to reevaluate that comparison? Both are scams.

Well played.
---
Yes, an instigating AP Gauss still maxes at 110 damage.  Its impossible to one hit kill in PVP these days due to the damage cap.  Unless you are fighting someone with no endurance points, you will not kill them in one shot. 
---
Tis why I use a 10m BE pistol for PVP, because why waste expensive ammo when the pistol hits damage cap anyway.  Full auto make sure I land 3-5 shots at pretty much the same time.  10mm auto pistols have crazy fire rates.
---
I think it‚Äôs funny as hell. When I get tired of it, I‚Äôll just change skins
---
Make sure to equip chemist and super duper when you craft them for double the gifts
---
Is a one time use item or once I own it I can go crazy making presents
---
It's not lost on me.
---
But I do think this could be a creative solution to the problem of getting weighed down after a quest ends.
---
Same, went back to the prototype skin for the ultracite armor
---
One time thing, you'd have to buy more

Piddle sticks üò°. Thanks!

I got the frog!

Reality is often disappointing.
---
I liked the scorched in the powder blue snow suits. You should have those in the atomic shop!
---
Oh then I guess you can make the case that those Santa Scorched simply stole one from there
---
I'm not in a nuke clearing team as such but I do a hell of a lot of silos and queens, what do you need help with?

No. They don't.

I run into what could be cheaters on console but they probably just popped some chems before shooting me.

You can tame a cat however they spawn at really low level and die quickly - best to build your camp around Murgle-if they die they respawn at least!

Ya that would be cool. As soon as they said they were bringing in display cases I built a showroom to show off all of my asylum dresses and I'm very upset that they haven't dropped the mannequins yet.

This might be helpful, as a visual guide as well as explaining the difference.

I don't think youre comprehending what Im saying

 It's kind of like flipping a light switch on and off at 100 BPM. If you still dont get it I dont know what to tell you. It's not because of the AP I would clearly know the difference. I comprehend what you are saying. But its not doing it slowly like that it's just simply On-Off-On-Off.
---
So far its been good went from 37 to 45
---
Some beetle pretty nice.

Which is all the more reason why we should get cool options, like a toggle to turn off the intrusive audio spewed forth from this otherwise outstanding power armor in our video game.

Fallout 76 is actually the first game to receive developer love. 
---
Skyrim, and all the other single players games get a patch every few months. For a year or two.
---
By the time support ends, the games are still ridiculously buggy.
---
Fallout 76 has been getting patches every week or two and it will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
---
That being said, fallout 76 is still a sorry excuse for a game.
---
Certain events have a chance to spawn them but then you have many people trying to get em first. Running around randomly with a team was working well for me. 
---
Does everyone know ?? 
---
You can CRAFT the gifts with wrapping paper you buy at venders. Its time for all the Scrooges sitting on 30k caps to get vending. 
---
If you run out of caps.. sell some of that hoard. Some plans and clothing is about to get less rare. Offload it now and get those caps so you can get those GIFTS. This doesn't have to be a scavenger hunt. This is a shopping spree!!
---
Encountered two earlier today both were legendary
---
Happens to me all the time. Just switch to another gun and switch back and it'll correct the ammo issue
---
That's a really interesting post.
---
So, what kind of gun was it?  Was it Primed?  Does this happen on all your guns or just the one?
---
If you are going to tag your post with Bug, please provide the relevant info to reproduce, diagnose, and fix.
---
Did you send a ticket in? 
---
I have seen sentry bots walking when their wheels get too damaged. It still not as creepy as when an assaultron is crawling at you tho
---
It can happen to any gun, it does not matter, it has happened to me with a shotgun, a handmade and much more
---
Do the crafted ones have the same loot pool as the regular ones?
---
I tried that, it was the first thing I did but still nothing :(
---
Probably a bug then from recent patch :(
---
Pretty much this, but do check it out.
---
It's all my guns, I don't have any primed weapons.
---
Ok, I haven't had it stick like that. I keep another gun on my favorite wheel and switch to it and then right back and it fixes it
---
Yes but Bethesda's support is super confusing and none of my previous tickets have ever been responded to.
---
How many comments/threads on here have we seen with people not realizing the Red Rocket actually fires when its destroyed? When the Mothman came out i had no idea it did the whole scream/bat thing. The Atom shop doesn't animate the camp items that actually do something, which woefully undersells them. Why *would* i spent 500 Atom on a statue when i have lions and baseball players etc in the base game?  
---
I realized from the image that it must do something, but they suck so it doesn't show the effect well, and certainly can't convey any sounds for which this thread was originally created. I've seen the marine and other statues so i know they're likely going to do something. But the WHAT is totally absent - where's the *sell* ? Why am i having to find out more about a thing when the 'advertisement' in the Atom Shop should sell itself?
---
It doesn't, therefore its failed, it is evident only in that i may eventually realize it as a n00b player through the game but that may well be long after the item is no longer available in the Shop so when i see it and think WOW, MY GOD, MUST HAVE - i can't. So your average player is now going to be doubly mad.
---
Nah, Xbox :/
---
Nice! What set are you wearing?
---
Thanks for that! Dumb question but how do I access the box?
---
How did you manage to save up that many? I seem to end up spending a bunch when I get around 100k. We‚Äôre you just going for max or you‚Äôve already bought everything you might want?
---
The only one I've come across so far didn't make the noise at all, even when attacking me!
---
It‚Äôs in your Pip Boy ‚ÄúAid‚Äù tab. Happy hunting!
---
Yeah I'll just keep at it, hopefully it fixes itself or something
---
Lol damn!
---
You can definitely get gorilla head
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I think you can only get legendary dragon from vault raid box now, not in any other legendary drop pool. Didn't know you can't get a quad.
---
That would be nice. At least they make for good lures, since I don't think they can be destroyed. Every time I come back to camp, I see things trying to smash it to bits, and I just pick them off one by one.
---
From what I can tell yes.
---
It‚Äôs completely random spawn. Got 5 at a power plant. Including 3 from a wave defense. Two inside. Tried that tunnel with all the dead responders by cranberry bog and saw nothing. Tonight I‚Äôm gonna try that mine with ultracite.
---
That is incorrect. It will overcharge them and make the clip bigger with ammosmith. When you reloaded, it put in a core that was low on charge, so if you have reloaded when you had 18 shot left prior, it keeps that core. So if you are out of fully charged ones, it will load the partially used ones.
---
Thanks so much for helping. I really appreciate the help.
---
It is, but man is it loud. I kinda wish we could turn down their volume and adjust speech frequency in their terminal.
---
Now I wish I had caps, spent half of mine on a large and medium. Good luck to all the hoarders
---
The X-01 recon helmet, jetpack, hydrolic bracers &amp; kinetic servos, in camo paint, which I've appropriately renamed X 01 Mobile. Imay swap out the head mod or just make another one.
---
NW was the only part of this game what was not broken. It did not need fixing. And so they fixed it. Bethesda motto: :If it ain't broke, break it!"
---
I think you are supposed to give those presents to other people haha
---
27k might be a lot, but some ppl enjoy NW. Me, my gf, and our friends completed all content in adventure many many months ago. Fact of the matter is it‚Äôs a grindy game whether it‚Äôs adventures RNG lottery, or the long level to 100 in NW. It was clearly implemented that way to last, despite some ppl being lvl 300 or higher. If you‚Äôre a completionist and u want everything, it‚Äôs the basis of this game to make you grind for it. If you‚Äôre seriously afking or sitting in a bush, that‚Äôs your own fault you can‚Äôt find a way to enjoy it or take a pass on this modes rewards. Probably sucks even more your teammates that enjoy the mode and are trying, but stuck with afk dead weight only there for undeserved cosmetics. If you actually try you might notice you get more used to the variety of weapons and lose the reliance to vats. The mode has made me better at combat, but sitting in a bush is the true waste of time and enjoyment.
---
Where are they? Haven't seen on yet.
---
I found a workaround as well. When I changed wallpapers, the lights and power conduits on the other side of the wall were stored and I couldn't place them. I scrapped them all and scrapped maybe one extra thing in my camp and then I was able to place everything how I had it.
---
Hopefully that's relevant.
---
The Xmas gifts have a chance for these, and (I think) all other armors, including PA arms/ legs/ chest/ helmet.
---
I've gotten the plasma grenade, plasma mine, tons of armor parts and a few dense plans with a luck of 8.
---
Your welcome! I‚Äôm just happy to help people out!
---
I got highest quality gift from a lvl 6 scorched on my lvl 10 character, so no.
---
This game doesn't come with instructions, you pretty much have to figure it out yourself it seems.
---
I suspect copyright make‚Äôs it impossible
---
Whatever they do, I really hope it's soon....
---
I agree. It could be an interesting solution, if it's further looked into.
---
Yeah pretty much you have a bunch of mostly empty cores
---
Yeah kinda! But it works for me bc my goal this season is to spread cheer amongst new Fallout players!
---
This doesn‚Äôt answer your question but the best way to find a lot of scorched now is the fissure sites and the surface to air event, but I hope it helps
---
OK so High quality gift got me a Santa Crash plan üéÅüòÅ
---
Oh, dont get me wrong, i fucking love NW and play it regularly. But 27k XP in 20 days is just too much for any normal player.
---
Ill still grind for it and get it, but they really should have kept it around 14k
---
Seems like a fitting present from Bethesda
---
They spawn where scorched spawn I have found close to 3 of them by the the guided meditation event. 3 from the scorched earth event and one from a random spawn.
---
Love my Santa Crash ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÖ
---
I‚Äôm mounting a...TICK!!!
---
The gifts have a keyword that excludes super duper. Chemist working was an accident I'm sure but is even better than super duper.

Also guided meditation

Doesn‚Äôt that one do feral ghouls or did they change it
---
Look here to get the list of rewards  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e0gt72/christmas\_event\_rewards/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e0gt72/christmas_event_rewards/)
---
A third 'Protectron' version that collects ammo and defends itself would be a cool addition.
---
This is a great idea. Whenever I really appreciate somebody‚Äôs camp I usually just make sure buy stuff from their vendor and I give them a thumbs up, but I might do this while the event is running!
---
I agree, that would have been way more fitting. I believe that‚Äôs what halloween rewards capped at. My post was more so aimed at the ppl that think afking in the mode is the solution. If it‚Äôs that much of a chore, skip on the pixel rewards.
---
There is that one Super Mutant emote from the Xmas pack, I think, that probably channels the Grinch.
---
What is the rapist gonna do ?
---
Nah, amazon prime is a lot better than FalloutFuckYou First
---
i think he is making a joke and mocking the people who don't understand how game engines work
---
I got the winter icicle plan
---
all you need is Sent assasins or cav assasins and Action Boy, Dodgy, Evasive, Barbarian, Seredipity and Blocker, and you are nigh invulnerable.
---
It‚Äôs complete RNG. I got 1k from a small gift
---
they're not level-dependent but are legendary dependant
---
it happens to me also on ps4 changing weapons and firing one bullet and reload then swap usually works
---
Both versions?
---
I just wanna launch a nuke and kill the queen
---
And this is the box that's in the atomic store?  I feel like maybe I'm missing something here
---
I got 6 one time while clearing the Tyler County Fairgrounds
---
Honestly, move on from shotguns.
---
Shottys now only serve one purpose, to cripple flying enemies.
---
You will be much happier going to a rifles build, or a heavy/Melee build.  They are the current go to for meta.
---
There is hunter vs hunted. I know not many people use it but I'm sure if someone set up a subreddit about organising up some HvH games it might be a nice avenue for the pvp community to thrive a bit.
---
Ts got fixed so dmg is 50/52% so it not a full 100% 2 shots. 100/100
---
It's the same basic concept, but there are orders of magnitude of difference. It's like comparing a pond to an ocean.
---
This kind of thing is definitely a step in the right direction as far as loot goes
---
They can also spawn in with scorch beasts.
---
Belching betty+AVR medical center+watoga civic building
---
Good to know. I've already begun to move my strength points to perception. Thanks fur the input
---
Thanks! Good to know. I'm def moving on
---
The tripple whammy .... Shotguns, explosives, and two shots were all nerfed.
---
Not saying you cant use that until you find something better.  The perk loadout is still the same tho, shotgunner perks in strength, enforcer in agility, fireproof in endurance, demolition perks in int.  Scatter shot and skeet shooter perks are optional.  
---
Not saying you will overcome those nerfs even with the perk, but you should be able to kill still.
---
All of my toons have at least 2 sets on em. Excovator is standard on em and the other is always combat. 
---
My Bloodied 2h melee runs the t51 with the works. My Shotgunner and my Bloodied unarmed runs around with a modded t60. My Energy weapons and  my sniper run X01s. My 2 little guys arent big enough for PA yet, but Ill run an  Ultracite one to play with on my Heavy weapons and mixed for my Pistol guy.
---
Helvetia
---
You're not supposed to be able to get any caps from small gifts.
---
Where can you get it?
---
Were they actually firing? I've encountered several "immortal" enemies, but they just stand there, doing nothing.
---
True, but the plasma grenade plan demand isn‚Äôt because they‚Äôre super useful, it‚Äôs because the plan was just unobtainably rare which created insane demand
---
Most of them die in one hit my guy, personally wouldn't go anywhere there's other people
---
I wasnt these cunts came to me
---
I'm a little concerned since I've spent MANY hours tweaking my Camp. But, since I am using a pre-existing structure, a case of Eminent Domain is likely, lol. Oh, well. I'll just find a crappier spot to build. üòÅ
---
We are beyond supposed to's with this game.
---
Oh that's fucked
---
There are two perks that help with this and atleast for me make the damage to my shotgun not a huge factor. 
---
Gunsmith Max out - guns break down 50% slower
---
Luck of the draw Max out - chance your weapon greatly repairs itself when hitting an enemy.
---
A new sorta  fun is bloody meat hook build.
---
True, but there's a good market for low level legendary stuff for people to use on their alts.
---
It was a great way to do a small live test of the instancing tech.
---
I used to have a set of each.  I got rid of all of them except the X-01, Ultracite and Excavator
---
I keep on my person the X-01 in Shadow Prime skin and the Excavator in Garrahan Mining skin.
---
The X-01 has the Targeting Hud, Emergency Protocols, Optimized Bracers and Calibrated Shocks.
---
The Excavtor has Targeting Hud, Emergency Protocols, Optimized Bracers and Calibrated Shocks (see a theme here?)
---
My Ultracite is for playing with a jetpack,  Its using the Black Rider skin and I put the JP on the head slot, EP on the torso, Vents on the legs (because everything is so hard to find), and Rusty Knuckles on the arms.  I only take this set out when I want to play with a jetpack.  Otherwise it stays in the stash.
---
The first Collectron and now the Santatron.
---
You realize it's really the oily secretionfrom his.... moth nuts right?
---
I still think the weapon durability drop was intentional. The fact that they introduced the "value" bundle of repair kits in the same update is *highly* suspicious.
---
Yeeee hawww
---
Don't tell me they've introduced some sort of infrasound problem on top of everything else.
---
I've been having a invisible snallyghaster at toxic larrys for weeks. I will kill them do my rounds and when I return, been having one in God mode.  it died in a goo pile via a FE plasma gat.
---
If it doesn't crash the game, or make you terrified to reload its fine at this point.
---
The "beam" is those simple round ceiling lights.  You can place them on top of each other.
---
So that whole center part coming down to the brahmin is lit up, making it really bright.
---
And then I just sat there like a goof until the cow walked into the right spot, lol.
---
Chemist?
---
There's 3 new new wrapping paper items (small, medium, and large) available at the robo vendors. You buy them, use them to craft presents at the tinker bench, and then open the presents to unlock the gifts. Apparently using the chemist perk gives you double the results.
---
It can do scorched gouls or super mutants or a combination.
---
Giggitygiggitygoo
---
Do a build video so i can copy the heck out of this with love
---
Soon as I joined a private world I instantly got a "Disconnected from Server" message what
---
It's always automatically loading the next core with the lowest charge left. If that's an ultracite fusion core, the frame is gonna load that (and it will immediately change to a regular fusion core of you exit and view the frame).
---
I'll be on after work to check out the event. Heard of some what is happening from friends who took the day off to play... Must be nice. As a diesel tech at a dealership I'm not calling in to play a videogame... I will sacrifice sleep though ü§£
---
Every patch brings back a few old "fixed" bugs it seems, lol.
---
Yeah but the light is fully circling the post in the middle but on the ground the entire light is in front of the post. It doesn't make sense
---
Unfortunately no, it's the exact same as a water pump but you can spam-gather by "drinking and then mashing the collect button".
---
The map is huge just go to a different farming spot and take them all for yourself
---
Right. Like we need to come to a uranium fever type consensus where we stop using our most OP guns during this event when necessary.
---
distant thunder!
---
This should be resolved "soon" when they do the 250dr rollback.
---
Thanks so much, Reddit!  I know the game is controversial and buggy, but I am excited to give it a try.
---
everywhere you normally find Scorched. i‚Äôve been finding them with groups more than half the time. maybe 75%. they seem quite plentiful.
---
do you what events? I know collision course and some location spawns.
---
There is medium. I‚Äôve received one.
---
Oh i see, so even when the player is high level, the scorcheds‚Äô level is probably capped at very low
---
I'll give it a shot, no pun intended ;)
---
My 2nd favorite robot to Biv
---
Or Bethesda just grabbed the music from whatever free site let them along with the commercial
---
How do you change the gift you wrap
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is what I‚Äôm waiting for with this update üòÇ
---
I thought only ferals spawned there?
---
I feel ya. I work at a boat shop rollin fiberglass. Messy as hellüòÇ
---
The burrows is full of ghouls
---
Try the emergency center in Watoga, it was nerfed heavily but occasionally there are legendary scorched spawned there as boss (could also be SM, wendigo or glowing one so you just have to keep trying). I got a three star BSS war drum from one not long ago.
---
I‚Äôm at the Valley Galleria where the Scorched like to chill, as well. I was hoping for a mall Santa, but no such luck. Maybe on the next server. üòú
---
You apparently saw Silent Night, Deadly Night at age 7 too
---
Ah the memories!
---
Each shot of 2hot (if it hits) does 62.5% damage (thus 25% over base damage if bot shots connects).
---
It's odd.  I've never seen mine get attacked, only its base station.  I do know that the collectrons can take environmental damage, though.  My current camp has a short cliff off to one side.  I'd sometimes come back to find the bot with leg damage.  Was heartbreaking, seeing the poor guy cheerfully limping around on a gimpy leg, trailing sparks and smoke.  Finally figured out what was happening and installed a fence.
---
Now if I could just keep my cat from getting stuck inside my walls and foundations...
---
I think, because I accidentally blocked thinking i had my gun equipped and it didnt turn it off.
---
well, I guess this shows how much I go there.
---
well, I guess that shows how much I go there.
---
I hope they will in the future (sooner than later) especially since there was that Mannequin blowing the horn in the shop before.
---
Haven't played in a while, so some info might be out of date.
---
Excavator armor with calibrated shocks, for extra carryweight, while also using the glitch for starting in ex. PA which give me bonus carryweight, (this still active?) As well as the arm servos that give a small carryweight bonus, optimized?
---
I don't go there often as well. Just only ever seen just the one type of enemy.
---
Any pattern in where you got the big/medium/small gifts? Is it relayed to number of stars, or scorched level/location?
---
hopefully it cures your projectile disfunction
---
My mistake someone told me it was 50 52 sorry for the wrong info about dmg.
---
I actually think the normal Collectron was much louder.  I have to get real close to this guy to hear him.  Good thing for subtitles
---
No worries :)
---
Ah! That would kind of explain it, must have been patched or something, thanks for your kind help regardless. üëç
---
just edited that to be more clear.
---
seems random. i got small from 2star and medium from 1star. so far no large as loot. also found 1 legendary without costume or suit
---
To have fun.
---
[Location Map for the Mysterious Map Fragments](https://imgur.com/gallery/i4brXfZ)

Would be a great addition to the game.
---
üëçüòú
---
All of my toons have at least 2 sets on em. Excovator with shocks is standard on em and the other is always combat. 
---
My Bloodied 2h melee runs the Nuka Cola t51 with the work- Shocks, Emerg Prot and the one that increases strength on the arms(cant recal what it is called off the top of my head) and a targeting HUD. He has an Ultracite with shocks, but I dont use it.
---
 My Shotgunner and my Bloodied unarmed run around with t60s- both in the desert camo. Shocks for both and bright lights. These guys tend to not use PA unless they need to.
---
 My Energy weapons/commando and my sniper run X01s. Shocks of course and Emerg Proc on  the Energy/commando. The sniper doesnt have any other mods, as the X01 is usually just for Nukes. Energy/Commando has the Black Rider paint and the Sniper has the Quantum Nuka Cola.
---
 My 2 little guys arent big enough for PA yet, but Ill run an Ultracite to play with for my Heavy weapons and a mixed for my Pistol/Naked guy. Not sure what the paint will be on these guys, havent decided yet.
---
Super duper doesn‚Äôt appear to affect it. Didn‚Äôt have a single one double during crafting and I threw down 4 alts worth of caps on high quality wrapping paper.
---
Chemist will double the amount of gifts made, like it would for regular chem items.
---
Does a quest come up as soon as you get near?
---
Fersure i know theres some old threads that might help but like i said ive tried it and it works, u might just have to have a buddy shoot u or if u can tank damage from scorchbeasts their screech attack breaks armor pretty efficiently as well
---
They are more than 1400 for sure. With hard bargain and some grape I got it to 1500+
---
Bethesda will drop a hot fix on Chemist asap. forget all the broken stuff
---
Phrasing, boom!
---
I would prefer you just give someone 1800 caps lol. Seems like an expensive gift box lol
---
Or people could stop following me
---
Or you can open it yourself. It will give you a plan and so far it‚Äôs been plans that I haven‚Äôt learned yet.
---
they are already in the code
---
What is it?
---
Stash a few things so you aren't relying on the carry weight benefit of Unyielding.  It's not optimal, but given that you don't really need to be in high-level areas for this event, survival shouldn't be a problem with the missing effects.
---
Yup after bugs its my major complaint about it. Like where's the explanation for crafting flux, why how etc? Its a tough learning curve for new folks.
---
But that's how they roll F4 was no different
---
Does the level of the scorched seem to make a difference on what level gift you got?
---
He will never be as cool as Biv!! Lol yeah he's funny though.
---
I'm above ur level on my main but have some lower lvl characters. Idk how our time zones will go together but I'm on at 6-12pm eastern time.  Add me if youd like. GT RiskierElf337
---
High capacity backpack..
---
It doesn't seem to, but it does affect the level of the Legendary item that gets dropped.
---
You don't want your halls decked with mothman eggnog?! üòã
---
This!  Never been attacked by one before (even though he didn‚Äôt attack me due to me shooting his face)
---
I'll drop you a friends request.
---
I forgot to put my GT down.
---
You won‚Äôt find any Scorched down there, my friend.
---
So the plan just dropped for me. I'm just stoked to be able to finish that Pioneer Scout badge now. There will probably be a bunch after this event. The value will be dropping hard just like the Whitespring Jumpsuit did after the Haloween event.
---
Only tried a max lvl(68?) Location. But that was purely because it seemed a better spot to get legendaries and the ammount of ammo is the same
---
Ultracite is my main one. I‚Äôm still trying to get the stable flux components to add the jet pack. I also have a piecemail set that I add any extra pieces to. Mostly for a backup set.
---
How the fuck does a man moth lay eggs...  bullshit.
---
Not sure about dissarming unarmed weapons but sniping hands typically makes them dissarm their firearms
---
Been playing on a new character. UK. Level 48 rn but higher on my main. (That I don't really use) Regular player. GT: beadleHumphrey
---
Not enough coal for my naughty calculations
---
I think I‚Äôm gonna just collect them and give them out. I currently have found over 20 so it shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find more
---
You can only get into the main cavern. The Vault itself is not accessible.
---
Fissure sites are the best to find them as only legendary scorched are dressed up but some places with high density of scorched; Morgantown Airport, AVR Medical and Belching Betty will typically spawn at least one
---
Where do you find them. I‚Äôve been playing for several hours and haven‚Äôt seen one
---
Ah right, might explain it a bit more better.
---
Indeed. This is my main reason for asking, if it's a stealth nerf I'd really like to know
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered this. Just yesterday after I did an Enclave event with a ton of Mole Miners and had like 24 Mole Rat Teeth still in my Junk after scrapping all.
---
Surface To Air got me 3 earlier.. all two star, one of each gift.  I feel like I‚Äôm not going to open any of these for a while.  They‚Äôre basically weightless
---
Scorch Beasts will be next to try üëç
---
Kinda dumb to unlock it without any real reward. But actually lore is its own reward, like in NW
---
swap the armor off then on again and you will regain the effects.  You can rename the armor to make them all line up at the top of your apparel tab.  
---
Sucks but that's the best workaround for now.  Also, if you can swap to melee you avoid this issue by never reloading anything.
---
This is very effective. I just use 1 tato plant that happens to be in the direction of my usual mob spawns. My particular spot is very difficult to approach from 2 sides, so it's a bit easier that way. 
---
I also prioritized Turrets over decorations, so my camp is not as pretty as some others... but it also basically defends itself. (Maxed out turret budget - 6 Heavy Lasers, 3 Missile Launchers and 1 Heavy Machine Gun). Put the turrets up high on building roof corners or build them little ledges with one tile floors. Extra height extends their range and keeps molerats from spawning behind their little arc radius. It took me some time to tweak the fields of fire to eliminate gaps.
---
Explosive shotguns are amazing for crippling enemies and dealing with crowds - if you use Enforcer you can destroy robots in two shots by taking off their limbs, you can stop an assault from lazerfacing you with one hit to the head, you can help lower levels grind by knocking down ghouls for them - it's a good utility tool
---
It seems to be random for me, although I would really love an option to mark items as "do not scrap" because I collect unique junk items like the light house, robot models and stuff. About half the time I forget they're in my inventory and hit the scrap button.
---
I actually agree. They look nice without being too obnoxious.
---
The medium gift is just called "Holiday Gift", havent seen a large one yet though
---
FO1 and use tent.
---
üòÇ Yeah it didn't work but thanks for the idea, might just quit playing for couple weeks until Bethesda pulls a finger out and tries fixing it for once :)
---
I‚Äôve been alternating between the Bolton greens, the Tyler County Fairgrounds, and the Morgantown Airport
---
The other thing that's super simple is just dropping random sections of wooden fence. Mobs LOVE these. I do this a lot when I cap workshops. Just a few sections of fence at weird angles, a few turrets overhead nearby. Mobs go after the fences, get shredded by the turrets.
---
Same. I hadn't been getting any disconnects in months, but last night both me and my buddy had to cut our loses because the whole server crashed, and then the next 3 servers we joined all crashed within a minute of joining. I'm on PC.
---
Even inside the interior cell, there's nothing behind the door.
---
I'm a fairly new player my character is level 5 but I'm down to play with a group anytime really want to get into this GT: Brewskii91
---
How many staff work on this game currently. You seem to know.
---
üò≥
---
Random locations as long as there are other scorched.
---
It's a two day event. You should probably try and make do with it.
---
Oh fuck. That is a bummer.
---
It‚Äôs only two days?
---
So do we know for sure if higher luck affects the quality of the drop? If so i feel a temporary skill point shuffle coming
---
Licensed Plumber is for pipe weapons. 
---
If your weapon does not have Pipe in the name, its not a pipe weapon.
---
Gunsmith
---
Gunsmith for durability, commando perks for auto rifles
---
Yes. I was able to get [both Mounted Feral plans and Plasma Grenade plans](https://i.imgur.com/6tCaotw.png) from the first Large Handmade Gift that I made this afternoon. I got Santa Crash from another that I made just a few minutes ago.
---
Reload while crouching or just take the armor off and put it back on. Also the event was planned and the bug was not so it's not like they did this intentionally -\_-
---
Melee
---
Holy shit, nice score!
---
Probably same place as the Brahmen Noodles.
---
lol, sure thing bub, if you say so...
---
My santatron zapped some eyebots attacking my camp
---
Found another one :D If you are on PC and you want it it's all yours
---
We dont as far as i know. Just included the luck for reference. If it makes a difference at all, i doubt it is big.
---
Honestly if you want to make sure just get a trashy uny set and make sure it is actually not bugged for once while opening.
---
A set like that is useful for shopping anyway
---
Santa's butt sticking out of my wallüòÅ
---
I figured not, but a confirmation is good. Thanks!
---
hmm not working on my lead pipe, should I equip Makeshift Warrior?
---
Thanks!
---
Or the Firecracker Whiskey?
---
I sell them all on my main for 400 apiece.
---
I find this to be interesting. What was the issue related to, because it just shows removed at the top? 
---
It must have been something that they are trying to cover up. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
Unyielding effects broken AND we get an event.
---
What system?
---
Does it stack with super-duper? Interesting, thanks for sharing!
---
It was from last year. I'm sure it will come back.
---
Im sure it'll be a grind, I have 4 characters
---
No I got the packages from the farm and the herald didn't even know about the map piece's
---
Plasma grenade just dropped for me. Sounds like its gonna be a good Christmas.
---
It's probably doing that because the reload bug is simulating you entering your power armor üòÇ
---
I will sell them all for 299 caps each.
---
I was (still am I guess) hoping for a Rudolph outfit in the style of the Sheepsquatch Mascot outfit.
---
All the outfits the Scorched are using were in last year's Christmas update. Think of these scorched as old players who quit. It's an honor to put them out of their misery
---
- Depends what it picks up? It has a max of 10 weight so keep that in mind. 
---
- No, not that I've noticed. It does of course effect the legendary levels. I like to go to Camden Park and Morgan Town Airport for example.
---
I'm definitely going to hope for that one..
---
It varies. One toon got loads, one almost none so far. Plenty of noice toys to play with, but I have plenty of work to do.
---
&gt; sadly scorched can‚Äôt spawn legendary versions 
---
Not true, legendary scorched have just a really really small chance of showing up, but I regularly encountered some at Watoga EMS.
---
I wanted the feral for so long ever since I seen that hunting cabin.
---
I can finally display my diet!
---
I would be disappointed in their priorities, but unsurprised.
---
I hope you're having fun.  :)
---
300 each is a very fair price when you consider all of the mats and the cost of the recipes. But if you feel the need to undercut knock yourself out.
---
Pretty much, yes. But the name is different.
---
Yeah, that one is pretty cool. My buddy built a bunch of traps there, then I got a huge bounty in Survival, went to Adventure, and sat at the back of the death trap cave.
---
I will admit the Sanatron has saved my marriage. Lol. 
---
The wife has put up with me playing this game for over 2000+ hours, and it not that she would ever leave me, but she does busts my balls on occasion, just to get a rise out of me, from time to time. 
---
I was playing the other night, and she was coloring one of her adult coloring books, as she does, well I play the game, it gives us both an opportunity to spend time together but doing what we both like. 
---
So I set up the Santatron in my camp, and he whent on his merry little way, she was listening to him talking, and burst out laughing, and said are you kidding me, what is that, so I told her. She was so overwhelmed with joy, she ask to play the game, and wantted to interact with him, she said it truly made her day. Lmao! 
---
The best part, she hates video games go figure. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Have you heard the one about how everyone has been wiped out.?
---
It litterally kills it's self by rebooting itself.... This is like some morbid stuff lol
---
You know there's at least one programmer who is losing his fucking mind.  Just in time for the holidays.
---
Yes, but the Christmas catalog does well for most as time goes by, while the non-holiday songs are less well known by comparison. So I‚Äôd guess the licensing costs more.
---
298.
---
Trimmed as its a phone view.  Long list of issues on top of the commonly reported p16 ones.  Eg i using drum mags only gives me 30 rounds.  Having to try muntiple times to fast travel.  Standing still and the ap still going down.
---
Excellent! I'll have to sit and wait to see how mine reacts to enemies.
---
I mean, obviously mothman is a bug.
---
I aint finding shit at fissure sites.. definitely don't recommend if you run melee also.
---
I must play like shit, lol. I'm a dad with my own business and a side hustle, so honestly...I don't even know what prime FFR means. I'm level 74, rifle build...got a 3 star handmade that's pretty good, I think it does 120/shot, with 50% AP, and I've got that AP feat maxed as well. But as I mentioned above, with 3 hitting me, I only got 1 of them down to about 90% of the way down.
---
Could be the bugs from the last patch. Game is broken since this weeks patch
---
I am thinking about to sink like half-million caps in this too‚Ä¶ but not sure if it's a good idea. Probably all the rare items included in these boxes will become "not so rare" if they are over-crafted. 
---
btw, I've just opened a Grognak's Axe replica, among other goodies... :-)
---
Or scrip
---
This is the correct way to handle this.
---
I believe the chance for more rare loot is greater. Less chance for just getting junk.
