ANYTHING. They sit on top of the roof by the fire &amp; just watch... they won’t even shoot the enemies.. that’s just way too lazy for me I’d rather waste my time sitting there with them letting the event fail rather than give them free event completions for no work

Dude.. the bloodbugs are broken!! Matter of fact I made a post about it &amp; people must’ve not know about it then but flying enemies period are broken for melee. They all are 0% VATS chance no matter what! So I’ve had to take my Explosive handmade out of the stash, wipe the dust off of it &amp; begin using it as I grind the event.
---
this.  It's a mini game unto itself getting the  timing down.  
---
You can also just change weapons, usually a bit easier to time that and it's only 1 button press if you have something favorited.

17 items for the scrip machine in one trip through whitesprings clubhouse full of diseased liberators.

I havent played in about a month so I'm not sure if its the vendor update that messed it up for me, or something prior, but thanks for the info! So the "upstairs"area is safe, thats good to know. Do you also have foundations and stuff in that ground level dome area though?
---
You say that but for some players the stability issues make it feel that bad. I miss like patch 6 or 7 when the game ran smooth and i had none of these issues
---
I so love my area, it's close to Vault 76, not too far for those to walk to pick 0n towards the west and very minor mob spawns in general. My shop is set up with my Player Selling tucked nicely out of plain view, so Mobs don't trigger really and I've only had to repair a few walls at all.
---
If that's the case then yes blame is on Amazon.  Ancestry uses them for their Family Tree Maker and it has issues more than Fallout 76. Maybe take the money going to Bezos and use it for server upgrades.
---
I have the same problem with standing lamps. Love your camp, btw. Had house in that same archway.
---
PS4 and I've done all the things BGS suggests to fix issues when i submitted a ticket months ago
---
Plenty of games with better graphics and animations than fo76.  If that's your criteria pretty much every other AAA game released in the past 3 or 4 years is "better" than fo76.
---
erm have you even played survival. you can only spawn at train stations and camps. I'm not going to spawn in miles away while we're in the middle if a battle am I??
---
You're 100% right though it has been rough. Especially this last patch with vendors. 
---
It's funny patch 6 and 7 were a NIGHTMARE for me. I was being disconnected almost hourly restarting my xb1 would help but it sucked.
---
I'm on PC
---
I do remember disabling ambient occlusion that way, but it made some environments look a little uglier because there was a staggering amount of light in an area with a technical absence of it. There is also a side effect of it making going underwater impossible, because it makes underwater visuals brighter than the fucking sun for some reason.  
---
Not sure if there is a way to override it somehow with something outside the game.
---
Oh, a wise guy, huh? Look, I'm tracking you right now, pal...
---
I've had this happen once or twice where it seems like you get a "streak".  
---
I'm less worried about it with the purveyor coming in 2 days.  Already got around 1k scrip saved up :)
---
Off the west side of WS near the gate in the woods
---
Launched two today... server crashed just before impact on the first one, nothing more than 1* Legendaries at Whitesprings on the 2nd...
---
The ones I used were just north of Alpine River Cabins in the forest.  Not sure if it matters or not, but I know I was using the camera with the upgraded 105mm lens too.
---
I'm a prime member maybe I can get some PTW connect speeds.
---
Unfortunately not static.  Sorry guys
---
It's a router issue.
---
I have 3 xboxs all playing at the same time.
---
All 3 are gold sharing.
---
2 are game sharing as well with this game being 1 of them.
---
I had the exact same issue with 2 xboxs trying to play GTA at the same time..... Both would be booted or only 1 could connect at a time. No issue playing separate but couldn't play together.
---
Upgraded to a nighthawk router and have never had a connection issue again even with this game.
---
You can try rebooting the router and power cycling the Xbox (hold power button until light goes off then restart) but you may need to upgrade.
---
Thanks! I hope it's salvageable. I'm gonna try storing and replacing all the foundations later tonight, hopefully that'll be enough. Can I ask why &amp; where you moved to? The constant attacks and mutant spawns in the area do get on my nerves, and I've thought about moving before because of that, but I feel like its worth staying especially now with the camp vendor stuff and being close to watoga and the SBQ fissure site.
---
I Iearned by level 80 not to pick up anything until after it's all over and to go in with no junk. A free bag is a free bag man. It's happened to all of us so don't be salty. One day the free bag will end up in your stash. It just happens.
---
Yeah. I’ve seen a lot of legendaries on my visits to whitespring camps. I don’t know the reason for the frequency though. Enjoy.
---
I've got you, at Poseidon Oil, reactor number 5. Ah, well, why don't you just sit tight and I'll order up a little celebration for ya. Including fireworks.
---
But it's still a dick move.
---
No, just the roof issue, sorry.
---
I did notice that sleeping bags are fine, but anything else floor-based just 'ports to the roof.
---
There is a spot that you slide into that gets you stuck, but that's been there since before this update.
---
okie I'm on right now IGN Fynchie
---
I got this from reviving a player standing in the water at the Encryptid event
---
I have 1 stone foundation with 3 stairs going up to the inside. I'm also on Xbox so it may be a different platform glitch or isolated to a few people. Sometimes if stuff won't place I back out of the build menu and retry it and it fixes.
---
I agree WS has issues right now with their RNG. I've done multiple runs since update with no legendaries at all. Then I ran and got a 1 star from EVERY ghoul in the club house and apartments (what is that, like 30+ qtf)  Then another run again with 0 legendaries again. Rng is, if not outright broken then sideways.
---
They are rewards from the daily at dolly sod, the pioneer scout bot that has you collect bug parts
---
The door that requires a keycard also has stairs going down behind it. Go down to find the security guard looking person in a chair. The keycard is in their hand.
---
That and the sheepsquach has shown up like four times now.  That is one angry squach.
---
I move around to different extractor sights depending on my needs. You’re right. High level mutants, wolves, bugs got kind of tedious.
---
"Tea Time" at the Giant Teapot. The last/3rd wave usually has 1-2 wolfs the spawns.
---
Yes that’s the best price I’ve seen so far everyone is charging 500-100 Caps and no one buys them so I think 375 is perfectly reasonable.
---
Idiot
---
I'm not visually impaired and it's hard for me to read sometimes that i gotta find a dark background in order to read captions.

Example:  sun yellow. Building brown. So i look towards brown building and move camera til i can see words.

'cause everyone's dead.
---
I plan on putting the scorched peices in a jar from Morgantown airport in my cranberry bog laboratory!
---
Cheaper than most I've seen on ps4. 300 being cheapest.
---
Thanks friend
---
Really? Heehee. I Haven’t seen the sheepsquatch in whitesprings at all.
---
not sure i have never changed my hud color not to mention i didn't know it was a option too.
---
right, on PC. Probably not doable in a console, unless one is allowed access to the HDD using a PC, and that the data is saved in a compatible way (probable), and that one is able to find the location of those files. On PC there are folders named "photos" and "CharacterPics" for example, so one could try searching for those. Probably won't help with recovering lost printscreens, but in the case the console hasn't overwritten the data (unlikely) then it might in theory be recoverable. 
---
However, if the only way to access the drive from a PC is to take it out of the console, then it may void the warranty, and in case of there being some "security" of sorts (no idea how that'd work or if it exists) could brick it.
---
But yeah, on PC it takes 2 minutes to do :/ Sorry about your photos, losing savegames and such data is a true pain. F.
---
Love this suggestion, I would definitely listen to that.
---
I know the staircase you mean. I thought I looked thoroughly enough. I’ll check it out again. Thanks!
---
I hope you feel better soon
---
Ikr but I was hoping to see the better backpack skins😔
---
I bought the tricentennial package.. at 1st I was pissed that I dropped $80 on a $30 unfinished game. I made it to maybe lv 15 and stopped playing. I've been back on for 3 wks now. About to ding lv50, killed scorchbeasts and the queen. Havent launched a nuke yet.. point is. I'm glad I'm back. I regularly run solo but every once in awhile I group up with some irl friends. I've been enjoying myself this time around. Anyone on PC feel free to add me. Name is same as here
---
Dolly’s daily events
---
If you’re failing, and not lazy, then I apologise
---
Which would mean you were doing something wrong in keeping the fire lit
---
Try other things. You can do it yourself, even if others aren’t assisting
---
Not mention some of us mine for resources we need so we never move our camp so we can continue mining.
---
And you can revive them to get the challenge for the pioneer scout quest line
---
Seen him last night, not near workshop. Was excited to see his inventory after the new vendor changes bit he had nothing rare or new 😞.
---
More than one mount?
---
Yea, it always gets roudy when he shows up.  The sentry bot and him don't get along and then all of sentry bot's friends jump in and then I have to break it all up before the responders show up and start harassing people.
---
You are just bound by supply and demand.
---
But honestly? That is way too steep. I've seen people selling the plans for 1000c. It is up to you, but if you are selling them entire leg. 
---
If you are selling a single mod, I'd put that at 100 or less.
---
True that Flux is a bitch to come by. But you can find the T60 legs for free, and even if you pay the full price from an NPC vendor, you'd be better off crafting them and selling the leg with the mod.
---
Long story short, if someone is looking for it and pays you for it, then that person thought it was a good enough deal to spend the Caps on it.
---
Agreed, hopefully they come sooner rather than later. I saw the datamined ones and really want the shovel/bottle backpack that was shown in the mine.
---
Commie scum!
---
And I'm spent
---
How deep was the water, you need to be in water shallow enough to not swim in, if it's too deep you can't do it.
---
You can honestly do it in a puddle as deep as your toes, as long as the water is deep enough to cause radiation damage, cranberry bog's endless trenches tend to have a lot of water areas that work.
---
The new one with the shovel is actually not a "skin" per-se, it's a separate backpack on it's own. So you need to craft the Shop-backpack, and it probably requires to have the quest completed.
---
Can we trade? I get multiple scorchbeasts that spawn around my camp.
---

I saw the concept art ones and the mothman one looked great and the radioactive one with blood on it looked great aswell
---
Did you have much camp budget?
---
I had around 12% and only had WW3 without animal friend on and couldn't tame (several tries with different deathclaws)
---
Sure, show up when it's almost fixed...when 4398573498 of the 34958743098570493875 bugs are cleared up after 6 months...easy sailing now!
---
It's a mix of flashing lights and bright lights in concentrated areas. In this case the flashing lights is moving the camera and the concentrated light is the flash light, of course. In buts and pieces it's OK (I can handle the scorchbeats, for example) but having extended playtime like darker nights will trigger it :( Normally to prevent this I play with a higher gamma setting but 76 doesn't have that
---
And teach you about the scorched, and give you decent weapons, and introduce you to the brotherhood and the raiders. They are the main way into getting to know the other factions, and also they sell BOS combat armor plans and everyone likes that
---
Yeah, but that was a simulation.
---
It sounds like you referring to the WS gate entrance on the west side of the property, just south of the entrance to the Enclave Bunker. If so, that location has been notorious as a spawn location for Flatwoods Monster (3 times), Sheepsquatch (1 time) and different variations of Mothman (3-4 times) over the past 2-3 weeks. My C.A.M.P is located slightly southwest of that location (on the putting green for the first hole). I have had to battle 4-5 Scorchbeast the past 2 weeks as well.
---
There’s explanations. Can’t recall where you find them, but basically what 1-down said.
---
I've just been selling them like cups and bottles and crap. You clear out one area with stacks of plates or random trash everywhere and you max out suprisingly quick. I'd like a more calculated approach but it's not like it's hard, just gotta waste an hour scrounging and being over encumbered for a bit.
---
Lol. I did vote for Trump
---
Lol. That is one of the best parts of having camp on or near whitesprings golf course. The ‘BOTS watching over your shit. I don’t intervene though because I always inadvertently shoot a ‘bot then they turn on me.
---
And it's almost impossible to see against almost any wall besides the white of the brick-wall's whitewash backing. It almost requires a 2nd light pointed at it in order to read it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The individual letters based have the same issue. I have a street light downlighting them to make them readable.
---
I killed a legendary super mutant and reward was 3 star aae combat shotgun, the same weapon I used to kill it with. But it was a visual glitch that has happened more than once
---
Super duper and ammo Smith.  You can make it pretty reliably.  What types are you looking for?
---
Yeah same here. I can't seem to gather it all on my own
---
I suggest holding down the converted munitions factory it’s ammo maker goes pretty fast
---
You could also try using the bird bones mutation or get a jet pack mod and slow your self before getting the ground.
---
The other mounted heads come from quests gained during the sheepsquatch questline
---
That mongrel probably had a blooded bite :(
---
I think backpacks skins are gonna be huge for Bethesda. Here's hoping we might be able to get weapons appearing on our backs too. Miss seeing my weapons on my back in FO3 and NV.
---
[removed]
---
Guess that's my night sorted
---
Lucky hole mine in excavator armor
---
About 300 lead in a run crafting with supy doop assuming you have the acid
---
Then craft away with ammosmith on
---
Right? Like nobody likes the idea man, dont shove it in our face until we accept it.
---
The event breach and clear can give silver and a lot of other ores
---
Lol yeah true
---
OK I fess up to doing this...
---
But I dual box and park my mule on the roof.  Main account does more than his fair share collecting wood and squishing bugs.
---
I want to fill my home with treasure like in Skyrim, why is that so hard
---
Thanks, I would have missed it
---
It will happen.
---
It will be 3.5 hours before I can log in
---
Seems reasonable to me. I keep seeing them for 1000-2000 which is more than I would spend. I finally found them for 175 at a vendor full of amazing prices.
---
I get this bug now and then (typically when trying to find a server where my CAMP spot isn't occupied), but I'm able to shoot and kill them without any issues. Rifleman though, with CF.
---
Yes! And that would be awesome!
---
I mean, it doesn't tell you where to get the kindling during the feed the fire part of the quest, or at least I don't remember it doing so.
---
I always stock up on way more kindling than I need, so I don't have to move away from the fire. You can gather a lot of the stuff during your downtime, and I am pretty sure it can be carried over.
---
I've been randomly nuking player vendor areas. Found some cool flux locations and spawned killed a few vendors in the process. You know the ones that just let their player sit at their camp while they go do something else.
---
I don't think so. I've got 15 luck and all I get is 3* stalkers pickaxe and spear's.
---
Don't ruin it for me! I'm trying to picture a mongrel armed to the teeth(s) with firearms.
---
I’ve gotten the same bug where they’re dragging on the ground at you, but I’ve always been able to hit them. That really sucks.
---
I sell marsupial for 200caps
---
Just found out VATS is the only way I can kill them. I'm a heavy gunner build so this will take awhile lol
---
I have 6 but I don’t think I ever see 3 legends at West Tek anymore
---
I got marsupial for 250!
---
They can be moved with explosives
---
Yes, I needs it!
---
People didn't consider it a true game because of A) It's lack of NPCs B) The way the story was told. Generally, the negative press started at the beginning of the game and just snowballed, going so far as to say "The game is so buggy you can't play it" or "The responders are just a replacement minutemen". It's truly not fair to the devs who put multiple years into the game and are just getting harassed just because they wanted to do something different. It's like listening to music, you may listen to the same artist or album for a while, but then you eventually get bored and try something else. That's what the devs tried to do, and it split the community right down the middle.
---
It does, it puts markers on every tree that has kindling around it
---
A lot of camps jsut went from boring wood floors to orange carpet.  
---
And quite frankly it is an improvement.
---
I haven’t gotten them myself but I heard a good way was to go through the glasses caverns.
---
They did release the black shovel backpack today
---
I've done this. I'm aware it's a dick move but don't keep anything on you you're willing to lose. Even if you just got it 10 seconds ago.
---
Hmmm I hesitate to picture it litterally to the teeth (holding a gun with it's mouth) or with a mongrel with the humanoid animation...
---
Yep, no-leg runs became more frequent. And all of this started, from my expierence,when new uniform hit.
---
And they should have stuck with single player games if they fail this badly at multiplayer games. Also tons of online games have had online servers with millions of players without needing to do an in game shop. Diablo 2 is a prime example, they kept battle.net running for over a decade afted the game released and didn't have any microtransactions and had more people on their servers daily than fo76 sold in total.
---
Not to mention if the servers are too expensive for them then release the software and let private people run their own servers. Then no worries about them having to cover the cost of upkeep.
---
Holy shit really??? I didn't see it. *Starts game back up*
---
yup, you need to turn in possum badges to a possum vendor (at a scout camp) to get the plans for mods.  or buy off other players
---
Ditto. 
---
The only drawback I see is that the items on sale seem to be linked to the camp budget... but like framing, turrets and brahmin; it's a trade-off. And I don't see that it's something that will be changed in a patch.
---
No worries I'll hold it for you, I'll probably be sleeping by then.
---
Who didn't?
---
Just 10mm so just need Lead, Steel, and Gunpowder. So mainly Lead and Gunpowder since Steel is so plentiful I toss it first after I scrap weapons.
---
Haha yeah I've been keeping an eye specifically for the backpacks, if you'll scroll all the way over on the featured items it's there. I picked it up right away, I really like it
---
Wow didn't know about Lucky Hole having so much. Thanks for the info.
---
Me and my buddy from the beta just starting playing again a few days ago. We've been playing exclusively on survival the extra EXP. The constant threat of players coming for you when you're on top of the leader board gave the game some new life for us after leaving for months.
---
Priceless: All serum recipes; All dense armors—especially combat; Raider shielded lining.   Highly valuable:  BOS PA paints, minigun tribarrel
---
Theres a lot of lore, but it’s a bit surprising you never read the vault terminals in a fallout game. They opened up to help others, unarmed, and raiders walked in and took over. Tortured all of them. 94 dwellers are naive  missionaries so you’re seeing what happened when they got killed. Been there the whole time.
---
 Definitely one of the more interesting things to look out for. Nuclear winter will open the vault.
---
Love to do it but really hate pvp since I chose pistol build and that build is trash against other players with handmades.
---
Can you trade the backpack to another player? I have several characters and I’m wondering if it’s an item I can give
---
this is a good idea, suggestions to add:
---
* also dog can carry some items (not power armor or heavy weapons+heavy weapon ammo) to stash. this takes 30 minutes (max- depends on range) to return of fella and its exhausted ( no food,drink etc) when returns. Also has a 5 minute cooldown to rest a bit. 
---
* there are dog perks. you can enhance its senses (perception-to show enemies and/or intelligence to show traps), fighting skill-str, carry weight-end, find items(luck), revive you-chr
---
* dog is equal to your level
---
* its armor can craftable(via dog house?), although heavy armor makes it run speed slow. craftable weapon-spiked leach can improve combat effectiveness
---
* tamed tiger/jaguar etc for cat people like me :)
---
I wish I knew
---
&gt; Lore breaking as they've shown brotherhood and supermutants on the east coast far earlier than logically possible.
---
They provided an explanation for this, you can say you don't like the explanation, sure, but you can't say it's "unexplained or not possible"
---
Same, it annoys the hell out of me. I don't get the logic behind that. They just specifically spawn,  to munch on my Deathclaw Topiary, walls and Decon shower...it's just like "but why?"  Apparently Scarecrows mitigate this, as all spawned AI will go after it before the rest of your camp...but that's budget I'd rather put towards decorations I actually want.
---
Creatures shouldn't be able to open any doors, imo.
---
I have been doing this same thing. Hit the limit on custom names yesterday :(
---
I’ve had some not count. I took pics alive and dead of 3 different Yao Guai and none counted.  Fast travelled to Dolly Sods and took a pic of that Yao Guai there and it did count. Similar thing happened with Radtoads. I don’t know why it glitches but fast traveling and trying again worked for me. I have since completed the badge.
---
I have been trying to work out if the one in the atom shop today is the same as this one [https://i.imgur.com/zp3QTWn.png](https://i.imgur.com/zp3QTWn.png) (as that one looks cleaner)
---
Here is all of them that a dataminer posted recently  [https://imgur.com/a/256G2pM](https://imgur.com/a/256G2pM)
---
I found out a trick today. Pressing X (select) to connect the wire works every time.
---
Uncle Todd.
---
Yes, I have 5 so far
---
I used to run lvl 3 Lead Belly, along with the carnivore mutation, sometimes using cannibal. Then I wanted to use other endurance points. I went down to level 1 Lead Belly after I got sun kissed. Now I don't use Lead Belly or cannibal anymore. I usually have a ton of meat to eat. I can eat it raw with no disease. And if I cook it for the extra buffs, with super duper, I rarely run out. But, yeah, if you are trying to minimize what you carry, then cannibal will be more effective.
---
Np
---
It’s as ore though, hence the need for excavator, as it will pull around 4 ore(not scrap) per node
---
Well, this doesn’t really hold up, because with Pharma farma you get a ton of every chem. I made 120 Fury last night from scratch, and the thing I ran out of first was digested goo, not med-x or buffout. 
---
Heck, I find enough psychotats with pharma farma that I don’t even really need to craft them. But I would like to have more of them in my shop.
---
That should legit open you up for pvp.. One could gather a posse and hunt the bastards down. 
---
This should also happen to people who one shot event creatures. (one violent night im looking at you! We were two people you pos! And I had to play the fucking banjo for 5 min because you couldn't be bothered to! Man I hope your camp has an eternal glitch!)....
---
This is how I've been making caps since the beta.
---
It would be pretty unfair to non VATS builds if they made luck effect legendary drops. 
---
I still find them at West Tek occasionally. I'm a rifle build so I usually don't go inside because the reward isn't worth the effort. I basically fast travel around the map to areas that spawn lots of scorched, ghouls, mutants, or Gutsy's. I avoid mole miners because they can't drop max level gear.
---
It's not just a glitch though, I have it. It's the same effect but different mods.
---
Do you play in adventure or survival mode?
---
For real, I love that encounter. I had to save scum the perfect crits to get through it, but all those g11es at 8000 caps each got Sulik some very nice armor and weapons from san francisco...
---
Still bugged.
---
i did not know that. Thanks. Never thought of throwing explosives.  
---
I had always timed my jump then pressed A til i got it
---
&gt;And by definition a shadow currency is a non official intended ingame currency or am i wrong? 
---
I've never heard of some thing being called "shadow currency" up until this game no online game has had issue with players making their own "currency" in games. So why would anyone expect it to be any different or a bannable offense(even though it isn't against their rules in the ToS)?
---
&gt;Point is - the max cap level was not enough? Why? Because all want (mostly duped) god-tier weapons and the prices raised?
---
Because most traders were at max caps by selling things to vendors within the first 2 weeks of the game being out. Literally took like 5 minutes a day to make a bunch of Confederate hats to sell and cap out your caps easy as hell.
---
Had nothing to do with dupes, was traders trying to keep the economy healthy by using a currency that is much harder to grind than caps that are pretty much worthless and have been since launch due to how easy it is to get to max caps just by selling hats to vendors.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
I trying to find you to send freind request but u are not popping up in search. Can you send a request
---
Same here. This event and Free Range I've failed way more than I did them successfully as no one gets the kindling or protects the Brahmin.
---
 With three dog narrating it would be tight
---
I sell them for 500 all day every day.
---
I would like a slightly longer fall before I take damage. Just feels appropriate.
---
Bad bot
---
This. 
---
You did your work
---
Dang. I bet it's still a killer though. Nice roll
---
I guess next time we gotta get on the mic and direct a little
---
Preston got screwed when they stuck the radiant AI on his character and covered the story behind him. If you can get past the radiant mission crap and get down to the story missions you find out that Preston considers himself a total failure. He strongly hints that at the time you rescued him he was days away from committing suicide.
---
He grew up idolising the minutemen and joined them with dreams of re-building the commonwealth and then saw some break off and become raiders and gunners, some just give up and disappear like the old bat at the castle, and the few who stayed behind got massacred by ONE guy who quit and joined the gunners.
---
He took over and tried to lead one last mission to save the few remaining  minutemen and survivors of quincy only to lose most of them in one disaster after another. And then just as he is expecting to be killed in the last disaster the lone survivor wanders casually in, massacres the raiders who were about to kill him, and then take down a deathclaw like its nothing.
---
If you can ignore the auto generated procedural missions, Preston is a broken man who thinks he is a complete failure, and that you are an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction. He thinks that if he tries anything it will just fail like everything else he has ever done, but you succeed at everything you try.
---
But even at his un patched worst, Preston has never annoyed me as much as Sanjay. My greatest regret about fallout 76 is that I will never get to nuke him.
---
Good point and I did not know that about mole miners.
---
You cant
---
Not very much, sadly. I think I got 5 ore per run. And you have to smelt 4 or to get one “smelt” credit.
---
Had someone stuck yesterday under my foundation. They were giving the help emote, but I had other people at my CAMP, so I didn’t want to start removing the foundation. I hope this doesn’t always happen when someone fast travels to my CAMP!
---
I sell plenty at 400. 500 is even still a good deal, but serums are needed so infrequently that people know they can just wait for a better deal. 
---
I predict that you’ll sell a lot at that price, even if it’s just people buying to resell. Which is just fine as long as you max out your npc vendor cap limit. Otherwise you might as well take 3 of those serums and sell them to an npc yourself.
---
You can also earn badges from the scout events, Campfire tails or whatever its called and the two scout dailies.
---
(random whether it will give you badge or just caps)
---
Re-login. I had an issue with photos at the water park but that fixed it.
---
Cool, thank you! 😊
---
JFC what kind of asshole downvotes a post like this?  I did something nice and I wanted to share.  I wish I could poop on your face - I'm sharing something fun, and you have to try to ruin my day.  
---
Thanks asshole.  I hope you die in a car wreck, seriously because the world sucks because of people like you.
---
Why are you on this subreddit if you're saying shit like this? You clearly don't like or play the game.
---
And you're also making shit up saying Diablo 3 had more players daily than fallout 76 sold in total lmao. You've got no data on how many copies this game sold.
---
Diablo 3 also had a fucking expansion pack that **wasn't** free you mongoloid.
---
Thanks.  It's been like three days.  Can't milk Brahmin either.  Stuck on 8/10
---
Tyler County dirt track has at least 2 silver deposits.
---
I think.
---
Definitely one there, by the spawn point.
---
I kill them with my all rise. No vats.

---
Oof. But at least its a somewhat consistant way
---
Today I got a 3 star leather armor with weapon redux :) I was happy that I was level 50 as well such a keeper
---
thanks, u r the best
---
I was expecting somebody in the new foil outfit for the tinman and was curious to see what the rest of the team was going to use for the other three.
---
Yes, that would be the ticket.  Let us bulk ammo and sell it.
---
Thanks for the responses! I found that the Wendigo Cave has 5-6 ore deposits, so with the excavator armor I’m good!
---
Still... a god roll for some level 1 out there...
---
They already fixed this once, and then broke it again with the last patch.
---
For the Brotherhood you actually can say it is a direct contradiction to what is said in fallout 1 due to the Brotherhood at that time not calling themselves the Brotherhood until well past 20 years after the great war. At that time they were still holed up in the bunkers and were still considering themselves the US military.
---
Yes, the roadmap talks about content called “wastelanders” coming out in the future and it mentions that it’s a new main quest.
---
I’ve played it. I play differently apparently. It’s called survival not straight up pvp. Doesn’t seem the survival mechanics intended on extended battles. And it is basically alpha/beta. You are playing it to complain for them. Complain about mechanics of survival, not the nerf of armor that was too OP.
---
Thanks for the input. Cheers
---
If an enemy is a level 40 they will drop either 35 or 40 gear.
---
A level 48 Super Mutant can drop something that is max level at 45 but will drop as a level 40 for pieces that are divisible of 10. Handmade rifles max out at 45 so you could get a max level Handmade but a Radium rifle would drop as a level 40.
---
I found one y'all thank
---
I’m at the pond near there, and I’ve had 3 SB’s beat up on my camp twice since the patch.
---
So what happens when an archeologist excavates an ancient ruin and then finds out it was a dinosaur museum? Do you then have to have a duel to the death with the paleontologists to see who gets the dig site or is there some sort of dance contest?
---
That sucks! Hopefully they fix that.
---
Howdy neighbor!
---
Yeah, should get a bit more. I usually have cushioned legs, it's not as good as the perk or legendary but effective enough.
---
Damn, good point.
---
I like to share the luck I get, but loosing that much caps is stupid I guess...
---
I just figured out where to find tons of aluminum: go to Top of the World and grab all the ski poles. I had over 100 in one run and I didn't even go through the whole place.
---
same for me
---
Iv done it solo a few times and never failed or put wood on the fire. It. Completes once the wendingo is killed. I just run for that guy.
---
Does luck affect the chance of finding rare apparel in the known areas?
---
Where do I go to put these numbers in?
---
Which achievements?
---
All of them or the early ones like leaving a vault, reach lvl **, craft weapons....
---
It's not just flying enemies. I couldnt connect with mole miners or mole rats to save my life the past two days.
---
Solo is much easier than in a group
---
Thanks! - terminal locations.
---
Nah if you farm hard as fuck it’s easy to get a bunch of springs and thinks like that. Ultracite might be questionable but springs are easy
---
Inb4 snakes on a plane
---
I just bought the game a month ago and have been enjoying it greatly. I'll be honest I got it for 60% off and was going to roleplay a shop keep and diner camp, but Im really liking the big hunt missions and scorchbeast remind me so much of Monster Hunter wyverns. It has elements I love from so many different games. Im sure it was really rough in the beta days and such, but even with the bugs Ive encountered I cant say it is much different than the bug frequency in FO4, from my personal experience at least
---
I must be the smelly kid because nobody ever shows up.
---
Sadly I think it is the exact opposite, the longer you play the more the major bugs eat at what enjoyment you could have. After having the server crash multiple times on you every time you launch a nuke, crash to desktop after buying the recall board for almost 2k so lose those caps.
---
The constant lag that gets frustrating as you try to loot a mob and have to wait minutes just for the mobs inventory to update and show whats in it. Etc.
---
Sadly the reviews weren't wrong, it's just lots of people struggle to get past the "honeymoon phase" until they realize there is pretty much no end game, there are no choices in the story, and there is no change to the world no matter what you do unlike every other fallout game.
---
You should go to a streamer named Crayator's stream and try to tell him Indiana Jones wears a fedora (like the challenge alludes to). Spoiler alert: he doesn't and it's a point of great contention.
---
That could be possible but I doubt it. I believe world spawns are server based.
---
Adventure, sorry. Should have said that in the post.
---
Omfg i need this in my life so hard!!!
---
It’s not an exact location but if I’m thinking of the correct thing it’s southwest of Morgantown. Above Bolton greens a bit.
---
I need one I have yet to find one and hate server hopping alot
---
Please man thats awesome
---
Well at least it’s something that was on their radar then! Hopefully they fix it again soon.
---
Challenge or not, I toss on both perks anyways, regardless of what it is for.
---
I didn't say Diablo 3... I said Diablo TWO which had no microtransactions and had the online servers up for over a decade after it came out.
---
I do play the game, which is literally why I say this. Becsuse I want the game to be good, not continue to screw up everything they touch, break promises.
---
I don’t think it should be possible for them to do damage to your camp since the latest patch. Bug/exploit maybe?
---
Thanks
---
You cant give them away
---
You know those players let their character sit there so people can inspect what's in their vendor . You know, helping people.
---
Can you imagine PVP if there were dogs? No one with a dog would risk it, unless the dog was immortal.
---
I sell gears to vendors on a regular basis, it's easy as hell to get them because they aren't used for much but many sources of junk that supply rare parts (springs, gold, screws, etc) also have gears in them
---
This just isn't true. My survival character is a VATS pistol user and he regularly banks charcter 20 to 50 levels higher than him with a non-legendary pipe revolver. Heck, even a standard pipe pistol is beastly in PvP.
---
Speed and crits win PvP. Pistols have both in spades.
---
Yea you can't drop , trade , or sell those unfortunately
---
Which disposal site I'm looking now. There's one at the very south end of the map. One in Appalachia.
---
So t got the Atoms for that yet.
---
Ill buy it. I love collecting lvl 1 legendaries.
---
Don't got the atoms for that yet.
---
That happened to me during "hold the line" at fort defiance. I spawned back in and shotgunned the guy dead and took it all back. Dude was screaming on the microphone. I ran, then fast travelled out of there. 
---
Probably my most proud accomplishment in the game.
---
Thanks everyone for the helpful tips, finally got one to spawn. Took a ton of server hops. Finally got it at the whitesprings location that was mentioned.
---
Unless it was recently fixed I have rarely seen them go after a scarecrow I have built first.  Been a few weeks since I had one up but they would destroy every ear of corn around it before they destroyed it.  It helps to just pretend they ate your corn and didnt shoot the piss out of it with an automatic rifle I guess.
---
Makes sense to me the super mutants, scorched, mole men, and ghouls could open doors but I've watched a fox open a gate, round a corner, and go straight into my locked electrical room.  Make yourself at home I guess.
---
Great idea, I'm amazed no one has thought of this yet. (As far as I know)
---
They wont know unless its reported so
---
User name checks out
---
This is fantastic thank you sooooo much.
---
Do you have a list with all the correct answers to the different tests, or know where i can find them. Its getting soooo stressfull having to do all the tests again and again.
---
You are not entitled to anyone elses stuff. I dont get why people get so worked up over others prices. A price of an item is dictated by the value the seller places on it, not the buyers. So just dont buy and let them live in dreamland.
---
Dammmm thanks for this, didnt know you couldnt drop them.
---
Leader of the Pack event in the forest spawns a ton
---
Can confirm. Done it solo and done everything myself with others killing bugs and no fail. Harder but completely doable.
---
Do you know which ones? I'm trying to get them all for my den
---
Apologies, i just been informed that they cant be dropped or traded 😢😢. Sorry for messing you around.
---
Plastic is easier to get by killing super mutants and scrapping the laser rifles with scrapper on. You get 10 pieces per rifle.
---
Wooden Desks Plan has to be the most uncommon plan in the game. It took me 2 months to find this and I only have because I bought it from another player thanks to player vending.
---
Damn haha I can see y for the backpacks but they shouldnt have done that to the cameras
---
Bird bones cancelled this problem for me. The extra AP is nice too
---
Huh
---
Absolutely agree, such a shame as i keep seeing them everywhere.
---
Oh yeah a guy said I was cheating after the pvp and I said no I’m not and it got heated, I honestly thought his weapons just sucked
---
Invincible in PvP? You truly are the Lord of Appalachia
---
"You're listening to the adventures of me, Hebert Daring Dashwood, and my stalwart ghoul manservant, Argyll. Today's episode..."
---
If big jumps is such a big deal for you  then you should know that taking radx temporarily cancels mutation effects.
---
Classic Bethesda attention to detail...
---
That's what I'm thinking...he did it while giving me the heart emoji like a proper ass.
---
Yeah I've seen several camps with expensive gear their even selling simple boards for 25k. I hope they fix the exploit because it will slow down player vending or everyone having the same gear.
---
Have you moved your module? It’s “next” to where the module was first placed (which, naturally, is the center of your camp)
---
This is from 10 yards away.
---
I bought my marsupial for 500 caps, which was definitely alot, but worth it.
---
A trip through the glasses cavern in excavator will provide more ultra cute than you’ll need in a week
---
Southwest part of the map where the big excavator is theres a train station. Just north of it has a shack with a cat named Murgle
---
Cool. Thanks for the input. Cheers
---
So you're even citing an old as fuck game that was only on pc.
---
Not only were older games way cheaper to produce, but it was also on a single platform that just so happens to be the cheapest and easiest to host servers on?
---
Give me a break. Do you understand anything about development costs?
---
Try tyler county fairgrounds
---
Atlas Observatory is a good location too. I did everything on the list and then finally scrolled down and saw launch a nuke!
---
I get crafting 50 crossbow bolts or running and obstacle course for a badge but holy shit. I have launched a nuke with this character yet. I've switched to other "easier" challenges so I can unlock that damn backpack.
---
Well the bastard wont drop for me I've only killed a few and I'm feeling defeated lol
---
Must be a random spawn. I was just there, got all except for like three bears.
---
Nice to know thanks
---
Players ingame seem perfectly happy to pay a cap each!
---
I don’t even mark mine up. I get repeat plans so often I’m just glad I can actually get something for them instead of always dumping them off for free which I didn’t mind doing back then.
---
Did you check on the rides or the top of the slide?
---
Even in fallout 1 we get no real lore about stuff between the march to lost hills and fallout 1, its a large gap and having other military groups join under the brotherhhod before going dark and making the lost hills the only ones left makes their focus on staying underground.
---
We know the military was trying to keep everything in Boston together post bombs so i like the addition.
---
About time, long time over due. 
---
Ive lost count the amount of times ive lost weapons by accidently scrapping or selling them.
---
if you are on xbone check out my selection. GT is same as here without the underscore.
---
If they had a slider in game, then yes. My TV runs really dark for Bethesda games, if I'm indoors it's just pure black. O don't know why they took away the slider that exists in every other game in existence
---
Can they be dropped if they’re still broken?
---
Then, every time you're near someone, you'll be asking them to trade instead of jumping -- or while you're jumping.
---
I mean, we ARE getting new stuff once in a while, and without the monthly charge... both freebies from the store (carpet, punch bowl, posters, etc) and the content of the monthly patches (vending, packs, cameras, emotes, etc). 
---
I'm inherently against micro-transactions, particularity ones as large as the ones here... but I'll accept them as long as the free content keeps coming on a regular basis. Given the freebies, I'm happy to look at the atom shop as rewards for the in-game milestones. And to be fair there does seem to be a fair flow of Atoms - while it obviously slows down later on and the dailies at the moment are often rubbish, I still get a fair number each week.
---
My opinion would be much improved if the dailies were balanced out, and would quickly change for the worse if the flow of free content doesn't keep up.
---
It would be extremely easy to bring back the Responders as NPCs. Flatwoods was overrun by raiders and the surviving Responders had their last stand in Morgantown where most of them died out, but realistically, the Responders would have most also sent a party north to Pittsburgh (The Pitt) in search of help. 
---
There'd tons of survivors just to the north, and Pittsburgh is only about a day's walk from Morgantown (per Google Maps). It's entirely feasible that right before their fall at Morgantown they sent a party north in search of aid and to give a warning. If Morgantown fell to the Scorched the Pitt would be one of next potential targets to fall as the Scorched grew. It only makes sense they'd go north.
---
Heck, the Responders were down in in the Charlestown area, and that's almost twice as far as Pittsburgh.
---
I've seen a recent screenshot where a guy had vastly more bulk junk in his stash than would fit in 800lb. So yes, there's probably an exploit.
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate, but wait till you find out that the 10 deathclaw hides can't actually drop from deathclaws
---
That’s actually a good point. Just give us a slider and everyone can be happy
---
With that title I thought I thought maybe I had missed a Weekly challenge involving sniffing 50 irradiated flowers naked in a nuke zone while holding a musical instrument and being well fed and diseased on team.
---
I imagine the underlying code is already there. Just need to enable it and maybe make a few tweaks.
---
There aren't any cats at the cat lady house. It's just a plastic farm
---
Yep, bunch of bears I already had or ones that I needed, but not the Radbear
---
Why so expensive?
---
76 on Console &gt; 76 on pc, I have both.
---
Alloy is a material mod, and that's learned from scrapping. You can use my spreadsheet here to see what is learned from plans and what is learned from scrapping.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Then you get people buying them just to resell at a higher price
---
Huh? When you hover over someone you can't jump anymore.
---
Died right after looting SBQ and someone stole all my junk and stable flux, in a blink of the eye.
---
10 mm is everywhere! 
---
But if you must:
---
Go to lucky mines in your excavator armor and mine for lead ore. Supermutants usually have gunpowder. Also plentiful when looting. Go get some easy supermutants and junk in Summersville.
---
&gt; So you're even citing an old as fuck game that was only on pc.
---
I'm citing a game that still had over 10 million players over a decade after release, and still was one of the top selling games in 2007 eight years after it was released.
---
To act like it was a "small game" compared to fo76 is a joke and shows how little you know about the game.
---
&gt;Not only were older games way cheaper to produce, but it was also on a single platform that just so happens to be the cheapest and easiest to host servers on?
---
They all are the same difficulty to host servers for. I've run game servers and voice chat servers before. I know exactly how "hard" they are. (they aren't at all).
---
&gt;Give me a break. Do you understand anything about development costs?
---
Seeing that I'm a former game dev for a triple A studio? Yes I'm sure I do better than you do.
---
&gt;This is like saying games nowadays shouldn't have paid dlc because Gameboy colour games didn't.
---
No, this is comparing extremely popular games that had millions of players online on their servers at the same time, with a game that barely sold a quarter of what fallout NV did. Diablo 2 sold more 10 years after it came out than fo76 did the year it came out.
---
They're rare event drops, no other way to get them besides players and grinding hundreds of events
---
I'll watch this with interest, as I've been looking for plans for leaded + alloyed metal armor for ages now.  Shockingly good resistances for crafted armor.
---
Oh ok....yah usually has a radbear there...could just be random...lol...maybe camden park?
---
That WOULD make sense and be cool if the armour wasn't terribly worn. Its incredibly dirty and beat up so the "cleanness" doesn't apply. I expected it to be stark white but it's more like light grey.
---
Yeah but not worth stopping and taking a rad x just to make a occasional small jump
---
I use a controller on PC, best of both worlds
---
BOS combat Armor? Still looking for the chest piece.
---
Taxidermy...read the Sasquatch poster and then do those for a bit
---
I sell them at my CAMP for 500 caps each but If you want to know a secret there's a hidden teddy bear refuge at the northern most part of the map at a destroyed shack about halfway between Knife's Edge and Prickett's fort. It's a little hard to snap them up but it is possible.
---
You can buy it at Grafton for about a 100 caps
---
But they said in fallout 1 that they stayed hidden in the mariposa military base for over 20 years before even communicating with the outside world. So it literally contradicts fo76's lore where Maxson contacted taggerty only a few years after the great war ended.
---
Train station or city store? Thanks :)
---
It's implied to be Overseer, as the hair matches the hair she had in the introduction video.
---
Build better defenses. Its a game mechanic. You can build ten turrets. Incorporate security walls. Its fun.
---
Either one should have it
---
Thanks chum
---
Expect to be banned on Thursday bro, sorry.
---
Hahaha, I used to do the same early on bro, now I never miss them!
---
I agree. I expected it to be stark white and adorned with human skulls and possibly a hood-like helmet similar to Famine. Instead we got a bland and dirty set of white T-51 power armour.
---
Might have something to do with the lack of a decent size playerbase
---
I sell Speed Demon and Marsupial for 250 each. You can sell for more to vendors but only 2-3 per day, and I get more flux than that from queens.
---
There is one at the end of the silo before going into the launch room!  Found it today!
---
Sorry, but this is just false.
---
Yea, but just dont buy them from those people
---
🙄
---
they collapsed when they lost their central figure of leadership due to internal power struggle and are now reborn... under another central figure of leadership, i wonder what will happen when the sole survivor eventually dies...
---
The degree to which DMG(lvl 1) is less than DMG(lvl 50) becomes practically irrelevant when bloodied DMG is sort of like dividing by zero, and enemies' HP is finite.  It's still a hell of a nice gun if you run bloodied.
---
Gonna have to disagree even though missing a tiny hop is annoying.  Definitely need hold X to sit though.
---
The terrifying side effects of fast travel 😂
---
I would say it's definitely the most possible conclusion
---
Except that the agro range of super mutants and scorched is further an turrets and they will stand outside of turret range shooting your shit all day. Yes it's a mechanic, but it's an ineffective one.
---
Oof
---
Baby goku just went super
---
Yep, three-star bloodied blocking lightweight board coming through!
---
Found it. Got both the Radbear and the Grizzly I was looking for. You came up in clutch for me, my man! Thank you!
---
I have 2186 10mm rounds would you like some for free. I play on Xbox one.
---
The leader board is the exact reason why I wont play on survival.  I absolutely despise forced PVP.
---
 I am all for added danger, I just don't want to be forced into it.
---
Fucking lifesaver here, mate.
---
Thank you!
---
My first instigating hunting rifle was level 1 ;)
---
I can't help you with this so much but I did hook it up once back in November and I did try it out but it SUUUUUUUUUUCKED SOOOOOOOO HARRRRRD I gave up and haven't tried again since. Between the shit controls and the lag and the freezing it was _literally_ unplayable. Good luck to you if you can get it to work but I know I couldn't.
---
Reach level, The LITerally  achievement Bobblehead ones, mission ones all of them
---
As of this afternoon I think one of the silos hadn't been cracked yet, so that might account for today...
---
I know right?
---
The brotherhood said that, are they going to tell a wastelander about the old military satellite network and the chaos of the post war America and the brotherhoods various other groups and bunkers and how they are probably unguarded treasure troves of pre war tech?
---
Any chance the lag and freezing was just due to the game's state in November?
---
This is impossible if you're looting. You're going to have stuff on you, particularly if you just picked it up or received it from an event. That just sounds crazy to say something like that.
---
A group of them spawn everytime near Widow's Perch because they're involved with a quest. It doesn't matter if you'vedone the quest or not, they'll spawn there everytime. 
---
Go to window's perch and head towards clarksville and make a slight left going dow hill. They'll be amongst the trees near a cliff. If you hit the road, you've gone too far
---
This is why I never invite archaeologists to my parties...
---
I agree with the people saying "only with a slider." I already need to run around with my headlamp on 90% of the time because everything is so dark...
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
They were saying it to the main character of fallout 1 who was at that time a BoS member. So not just a wastelander, but the guy that saved their asses, and was part of their group.
---
You can still get ALOT for it. There are lots of high LVL players that like starting/lvling new characters and look for God roll min LVL weapons for it. You may be able to trade it for something similar or multiple weapons of a high lvl
---
O.o . . . any chance you mind sharing that your pistol build? Searched for days and never found a proper pvp pistol build and few random pve builds and really want to try it out.
---
I just mini nuked the inside of white springs as soon as they all started chasing me like 2 times and once outside
---
I put "Z" then whatever it is so all the good stuff guys to the bottom of the list. Lies likely to sell it accidentally down there
---
For a picture of a cat fast travel to Welch station in the ash pit then follow the path up the hill.  Murgle the cat is always there hanging out at a little booth.
---
For sure!!! GT RaymondMassey. The help is greatly appreciated!
---
I sell most for 500 all day and do a brisk business. Marsupial, healing factor, adrenal reaction, and scaly skin go for 550. I sell them as much or more.
---
It's. A. Joke.
---
... Sort of.
---
Could be the game. Could be my network. Could be a little from column A and a little from column B. Could be I'm an idiot.
---
But I will say if I did it again and my internet was flawless I'd use a Logitech controller (310/710) or an XB1/PS4 controller because that steam controller was hot garbage.
---
Thanks for the Silver! Btw if anyone wants to use this pic, you have my and Erin's permission
---
having this same exact problem now, ever find a solution?
---
\*Froggy.
---
yea even with markup most of the time those plans are a LOT cheaper than the vendors
---
Also, Just an FYI. Diablo 2's online servers are STILL up and running and currently have 40k active players right now.

Maybe he's not glowing because he's unhappy in the jar.
---
I picked one up off of a container the other night. I'm only level 29.
---
Wait a minute was there a guy named skylord in it with you when you launched it and what time
---
It absolutely will. They've used no other language but "display cases" repeatedly. Everyone is setting themselves up for huge disappointment.
---
Oh man I was so excited for Junk decoration, it really livens up camps to make them feel more real. Ah well, display item cases won't be too bad. Still have my fingers crosses though
---
I got the red raider one looks better and cheaper
---
&gt;40k active players right now
---
And you honestly think Fallout 76 doesn't have at least 40k players right now? across 3 platforms?
---
Good to know about the Steam controller. I'll borrow a controller and see how it works
---
Omw to your world. GT: SCVMcormick
---
Thanks for posting. I was thinking of getting. But not when it does this
---
No prince is fine. Maybe we could have a few different names on the jars though. I also wish we could capture and display more creatures in enclosures like this. I would love to have a live opossum  that hangs from the ceiling as a decoration. Just call it a “trained” opossum.
---
If they wanna work for the margins good for them.
---
It also could just be my expirince but no ones ever contested me for it
---
Will be interesting to see.  Seems like explosives are way too weak in this game
---
You dont get hunted down as much as you'd think.  Once you die it resets anyway and people are constantly moving up and down.
---
Bos arms plans, bos chest plans. Bos legs plans can be bought at Grafton train station for about 100 caps each plan. Some people like me craft 2 star and 3 star armor to its max because i learned most if not all by scrapping or from rewarded plans. Then i sell the armor for a reasonable price. I also stock/sell bos plans in my vending machine for 125 caps each.
---
Where did you find it? I still haven't..
---
Do you not realize you are trying to compare the numbers of a 20 year old game. That is how many players are active on the 20 year old servers FREE servers.
---
Also here since you seem to think fo76 sales did well compared to the others in the series:  https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/19/fallout-76-uk-launch-sales-are-over-80-down-compared-to-fallout-4/

Only bad thing about it is it can only be used on Excavator Power Armour otherwise I might've just bought that and claimed it was the true Death skin lol
---
Well done!
---
oops \*DLC, the Arktos Pharma DLC coming soon
---
And that sorta intel is very much need to know, and considering the vault dweller is a recently joined member its likely they would wait before giving hints towards other stuff out there.
---
Plus it may just be forbidden as moral would plummet if it was mentioned they are the only chapter left so quickly after the bombs.
---
That’s it I’m starting my unarmed guy and I’m going to make him into shao Kahn
---
Bethesda - We heard your suggestion and for the low price of 5000 atoms you can buy that option. You're welcome
---
Yeah it still doesn't really interest me at all though.
---
 To gimmicky and arcade like for my taste.
---
 Now if you give me a mode with no map markers, unrestricted PVP, locked characters and a better bounty system then I'm all for it.
---
Is Excavator not very good? i dont use power armor atm
---
It makes me wish their was a Vault-Tech version of Yelp so i could rate these people for terrible service. Met someone who was selling plans for a ridiculous price. He was selling a 50 cap plan for 300 caps. I think it was a wooden crate or something like that. Definitely not worth 300 caps. Woof.
---
That’s why you set up by a particular spawn.
---
Camp by a wendigo, then you get those sweet teeth all day er day
---
Hell yeah, I've been waiting for the skull totems since the datamine.
---
\*whistles a jaunty little tune while redecorating her shrine to the Almighty Mothman\*
---
So quickly after the bombs? You realize fallout 1 is many years after the bombs. 80 years I believe. Also why would they be mum on that information to him when Maxson himself was completely open with him in fo1 enough so that maxson even tells you info about the BoS you can use against him. 
---
So if he is willing to give you dirt on himself I don't see why he would lie about when they left the mariposa military base.
---
What exploit are you talking about?
---
Hell I had fun killing em with the nukes. I never use the thing so it was a decent change of pace. 1k damage with minimal perks heh
---
Gatlings are fun, although Suppressor's not necessarily the best legendary buff going...  I shredded mine into sparkly stars awaiting Mole Nana's arrival.
---
Mine came back yesterday.
---
Yeah, it’s like a whiteish, silver color.
---
You sir are my hero
---
What is the challenge for this week
---
I guess it’s all about what you’re looking for in a game. I’m over 820hrs in and love it now more than ever. It’s not a traditional fallout game, but that’s what makes it great. For me it’s just a looting and shopkeeping 2nd life kinda game with set in the fallout universe. Something I can just hop into for 5 minutes or 8hrs doing whatever. Visiting other camps, helping low level characters, giving away or selling items others want, farming events for plans, etc. Now I know I don’t speak for everyone at all, but for me at least its not about the most powerful weapons or toughest dungeons, just having fun. And that’s easy to do despite the bugs, glitches, and dupes
---
Nope. It will be destroyed.
---
I've heard about a junk dupe. But people have been seeing groups of people huddled over a container.
---
Ooooh Coquí
---
....yayyy
---
Pencils also don't contain lead
---
Yo, this is out of the blue, but can you make me a level 50 one? I'll give you the mats for it if I've got them all. Cheers.
---
This sounds like a lot of fun.
---
What also might be neat would be a feature where you could play holotapes you've collected as a playlist, including by quest or faction. Some of the recordings were really good.
---
Thats a fair point, but i mean the brotherhood in WV being gone only 25 years post bombs, thats not a good sign for your own survival.
---
Then all other sites go dark and you just swear discussion of the other chapters to secrecy as its killing moral and years later its just forgotten outside of some archieves and salvage sites.
---
All of mine say unyielding so no need to rename :)
---
I want to wood panel all my walls. And asbestos ceiling tiles with stains that look like jesus.
---
Yes please!
---
How exactly do you have fun when everytime you attempt to do something that could be fun, you either crash, the game glitches out somehow, something doesn't work, or the mob you worked hard to kills body just disappears without a chance to loot it? 
---
I just can't bring myself to say, "oh this is a good game" when there are this many issues. It just sucks the fun out of it for me, and makes me sad knowing that this game could have been amazing if bethesda actually gave a shit about this game instead of just pushed it out as a quick cash grab.
---
Excavator is great, more for carrying, less for defense
---
When they broke the game?
---
Is there a reason for not investing onto heavy weapons perks. The auto grenade launcher counts as both
---
Yeah I am aspiring (is that a good word to use in this case? Whatever I want to be) an archeologist, and whenever I tell someone, they always say “oh you want to dig up dinosaurs?” And I have to spend 10 minutes explaining to them what archaeologists do
---
There pictures are on the website some where don't complain because your stupid
---
Thats perfect for me as im always getting overencumbered haha
---
Fixing buzzblade damage should be #1
---
They need to make it so we can Se all the perks of legendaries that are placed in vending machines.
---
I also need maps for interiors because I waste 3 4th of the time being lost
---
The Watoga Station's Stash is very close to Site Prime.

---
But that is just it, if you read the archives, they WERE hidden for over 30 years in mariposa before stepping out and communicating with others. Also, if you are going by the fo76 lore, then Maxson has no clue that the wv chapter is dead, as they lost communications due to the satalites failing, not because the brotherhood died. So as far as Maxson knew there was still an active branch in Wv if he had actually communicated with them. 
---
Unfortunatly fallout 1's lore doesn't agree with that, and goes to say over and over, they hid in the bunker for many years, well past the time of fo76's reclamation day. Even if he did communicate with them, if you are following fo76's lore, he has no clue they are dead, so he would have talked about them in fallout 1.
---
It happened to me a couple of times actually after the SBQ fight. But whoever took all my junk was being nice as they left me with the stable fluxes that I got from the event.
---
The wiki shows it not being applicable towards any of the non-explosive damage perks. Even if that was the case, that would be eating up a lot of strength perks for a damage boost on one weapon, as I don't aim to use any of the non-explosive heavy guns.
---
At launch night time was dark as shit. It sucked, people complained, and they fixed it. Crazy to see people complaining about it the other way now.
---
Still, have it?
---
Well in fallout it’s in the past-future-things whatever you know fallout. Anywhoo I think that if their still using leather footbal helmets they’re still gonna be using lead in pencil and probably paint
---
July 4 will be one Ik that for sure but idk when the others are
---
Ever since I placed my camp in January, though I don't move the foundation as they get dropped under a different part of floor each time!
---
 So I just place down a chair to rescue them rather than ripping up the floorboards!
---
Ahhh okay thank you
---
It's different each time, nothing to do with my camp device!
---
Don't even have to change weapons, can just go into third person and then back to first person and it cancels the animation. Takes no timing at all, just do it right after landing.
---
Lucky, for me had a few attempts. You never realize how fast you run with running with pistol increase speed and speed demon mutation are on when your being chased down but people contesting it. To be fair they had someone teleport to me where I was at on the map and other guy attempted capture of workshop so it was so they could claim my caps on 4 different attempts and others were they wanted the workshop.
---
Where did you hear this?
---
The angel of death is pleased
---
I was thinking the "Organized Militia of Appalachia" or is that dumb 😅
---

Definitely right in line to what I was thinking. Thank you!

Trading is the long term, I dunno why more players don't trade. My entire time is spent in camps now. Trading is the only thing 76 does well, and they realized that. Still needs improvement
---
Add some Avocado green kitchen appliances and paisley bathroom wallpaper and we have design for living. :)
---
Srry bout that other than that I don’t have any other ammo locations but you could get full ammosmith farm mats and craft
---
I'll have to find that one myself first 😳🤣
---
It's like something you would see on r/shittyaquariums
---
I love the Skull Mask, but the only downside to it is that it hides my beard, which is a bummer.
---
To be sure you're safe, PM me exactly how you did it.  Step by step in great detail.
---
Go Figure, they tease backpacks like the Enclave skin but nope, Lets just add 5 rehashes of the same backpack and still ignore Enclave is a thing. Not even the enclave just the style conscept. Lazy
---
They're a great faction if you listen to the stories. The responders don't have a castle, which they then lost it during their demise, only to have you finally have to retake it for them. Their demise comprised of their leaders losing faith and turning against the minutemen in favor of being raiders, as they lost faith in their cause. The same thing could have happened to the responders if they lost faith after 200 fucking years of being proven time and time again that they can't change the world no matter what they do.
---
I didn’t know this and recently traded my son a 3* lvl 5 unyielding raider leg for a 3* lvl 45 something something flamer. I just wanted scrip!
---
Anyway, he said he’ll be right back, left to another server, and came back laughing about how he just sold it to his vender buddy for 5k caps 😳
---
tricked by a 12 yr old....it might be time for me to leave this world
---
And the vendor is an awesome in-cave camp I believe.  His set up was immersive.
---
I am a huge fan of the vendor system and am very glad Bethesda implemented it, unfortunately it doesn't address replay value (at least not to me).
---
What are the serums listed under in camps anyway? I’m never quite sure what I’m looking for when hovering over camps.
---
If you scrap your broken crops they provide the resources needed to plant a new one. No need to look for blackberries. Example, scrapping a broken corn plant gets you one corn and one fertilizer. So you can just plant a new corn with the resources.
---
Very noice!
---
I've been consistently selling Bird Bones, Healing Factor,  Marsupial, and Speed Demon for 300 caps
---
I’ve hopped around soo many vendors and have yet to see a TSE :( all this talk about duping but it appears I’m on the permanent poop servers
---
You can get more then that selling them to a vendor. 500 seems about right.
---
I’m doing the same - wolf head comes from main squatch quest.   Bear, owlet, and radstag come from a quest board at the squatch quest hub.  Wendigo from a quest at the southern bell motel in the mire. Not the event or the daily though there is a newsletter you have to read.  I’ve gotten two bugs from the dolly sods quest.  The rest I don’t know or aren’t obtainable yet.
---
I have my own den I’m decorating;)
---
What is the quest?
---
I did the basement one first too, which caused it to error. If I left the server and did the outside sign first, then it directed me appropriately to the monorail second.
---
Could have used the sheepsquatch imposters outfit for the lion, the conspiracy suit for the tin man and the farmhand clothes for scarecrow. Close enough.
---
Also good for harvesting ore.

If you can find a few teammates to share weight reduction cards with you, it might put you under the weight limit so you can move things around without destroying anything.

---
I know that what was the quest for it what did you have to do
---
I have seen a few, but never enough caps
---
All good, farming low lvl areas where most enemies are at and able to get quite a few chucks of lead and gunpowder. Plus RandomLettersMS gave me 2k of 10mm so should be good if anything intense comes along but checking out the methods on this thread so Im ready for next time.
---
Claim a workshop on team, complete quest on team, kill schorchbeast on team, and revive player while on team
---
Having fun, for me, isn’t just about the loot. Of course you want to get whatever all you can. But if it disappears, ehh, there’ll be more loot. And honestly in the extensive time I’ve played, rarely does the enemies body disappear. I know it was notorious with the imposter Sheepsquatch fight but it’s only happened to me once in the 20+ times I’ve completed it.
---
It is glitchy as all hell and crashes so often, there’s no arguing that. But for some reason, when it works it’s good. And the crashes nowadays are less than they used to be for sure. Sure they should have waited, but they didn’t. And it’s currently at good state to where if someone picked it up brand new, they would have many hours of content to explore.
---
This
---
What's tse
---
Yup. Running around in the mire after launch was fucking dark. All you could see was the narrow glow around your Pip-Boy/headlamp. You were listening hard for beast noises, or just hunkering down for the night. It was awesome.
---
I'm a bloody tank build and it kinda sucks having to wait for everyone to get a hit in before I can hit. Unfortunately I understand how this would cause power leveling.
---
&gt;you seem to think fo76 sales did well compared to the others in the series
---
Are all your comebacks going to involve telling me I said things I literally never said?
---
Actually though kinda sucks
---
Helps when overweight
---
Do you have adrenal reaction and strange in numbers? They finally fixed those two so that SiN properly boosts Adrenal damage.
---
Two shot explosive
---
It's a logical assumption. When they announced The Burrows they also mention Vaults and Arktos Pharma all coming soon.
---
Personally I see no problem with charging 500 caps for one, at the offering of some materials then I drop the price!
---
ROFL, so you removed your comment where you claimed that fo76 didn't do extremely poorly and sold less than a quarter of fo:NV...
---
Two shot explosive.
---
0 times... but I have 3x Acrobat armor anyway. (Yeah, the third piece is more by accident. I wanted the second effect.)
---
You must be new around here. It's short for two shot explosive
---
Good idea!
---
I'm not certain it's a "proper" build by any stretch. Heck, with the way damage is balanced in PvP, I don't even know if builds matter much. I was regularly killing level 60 - 80 characters at level 10. I'm only level 42 now, and still winning more fights than I lose.
---
The single most important perk is concentrated fire so you can aim for the head.
---
Eventual build as follows:
---
S - 8 - Bandolier 2, Blocker 3, Travelling Pharmacy 3
---
P - 7 - Concentrated Fire 3, Crack Shot 3, Fire in the Hole 1
---
E - 2 - Ironclad 2
---
C - 4 - Lone Wanderer 3
---
I - 5 - Gunsmith 5
---
A - 15 - Action Boy 3, Gunslinger 2, Expert Gunslinger 1, Master Gunslinger 1, Gun Runner 2, Gun fu 1, Adrenaline 5
---
L - 15 - Better Crits 3, Bloody Mess 3, Crit Savvy 3, 4-Leaf Clover 2, Grim Reaper's Sprint 2, Starched Genes 2
---
Mutations - I currently have adrenal reaction and carnivore. I could take or leave carnivore (preferably leave) but AR is super helpful for PVE. I'd love to get Marsupial and Speed Demon.
---
I mean what else am I supposed to do with them. I sell pretty much any CAMP plan for 35c and Armor plans for 100 usually. If they didn't have weight I'd probably just collect them for the fun of it but well..
---
Yeah I haven't seen it yet
---
I sell my serums for 375, and I just ran out tonight! 375 is perfectly reasonable, all things considered. I've been to too many camps where they were selling them starting at 1k and up, it's crazy. Only reason I sell mine for 375 is cause of that 10% tax; if the tax didn't exist, I'd sell for less, personally
---
*you’re
---
No I've been in fallout 76 since beta but never played much and created a new character with a better build

duh its the same as Fallout 4, they dont acknowedge them anymore as a thing. i was hoping for the backpack but clearly they just wann rehash the shovel backpack

It's an Asus would have to check the model. Its set up as a wireless repeater my actual internet is a Sprint mifi Device a fanklin 810.  The router is hard wired to and 16 port Ethernet switch. So it's a bit convoluted but living in the country this is the best internet I can get lol. 
---
I have a feeling it may have something to do with a port conflict. My short-term answer was too hot spot the second  Xbox to my phone. Going to look into it a bit more when I get some time but any suggestions are welcome.
---
Some helpful tips. Mammalist is easy to complete there are quite a few spawns for each mammal. Milking brahim is the worst part. (Build a brahim pen in your base for easiest collection. Kill the brahim then store and replant/repair), go to flatwoods, or the lake just east of pleasant valley station. North and down the hill east a bit for collection, three brahim spawn there. As people have said athlete and swimmer are easiest. For swimmer clear the lake before starting. There is a swimsuit next to the dock. If you are working on revive in water do not die to rads (you need to take enough damage to be downed but no damage afterward). Athlete is pretty straight forward. Im on xbox if you want a run through might cost yah some caps 😁
---
B-)
---
Weird when I built my friend camp I could move stuff around.
---
This made me cry lol
---
To be fair the actual Minute Men in the US Rev didn't have a centralized base and would swarm from the surrounding towns at a minutes notice. Until they were called you wouldn't know they were there
---
Twould be nice if they also just randomly came on the Appalachia radio station between songs, would cut the monotony of music i hear everybody complaining about, and i'm pretty sure Old Man Mose is very dead by now...
---
I checked all of them from the datamining.. As far as I'm concerned Famine is best..it should have been Death.
---
I've had my Whitepowder set at 5k since player vending came out. So far I've had people ask me to lower the price cause they didn't have enough/didn't want to pay 5k 🙃
---
&gt;only obtainable by paying additional money
---
Or, you know, challenges and saving.
---
Ehhh any melee player is using the melee weight reduction perk since it’s also a damage perk. So they aren’t that bad, relatively.

Different types of dogs should do different things. Ex. A small dog, such as a beagle should run faster, heal faster and attack faster. A larger dog such as a Husky should do more damage and be able to carry heavier loads, but heal slower and move slowly.
---
Also, having your dog guard your home would be cool.
---
I'm thinking there's a setting to change that, and the steam controller settings are some of the most in depth I've come across. It's just potentially a lot of work to get it just right.
---
They also allow people to share controller profiles so somebody by now has likely done the leg work.
---
I just frankly love the steam controller. Takes a moment to get used to &amp; set right, but once it is those touch pads are aaaaace
---
Thank you, I'll try there! Whitesprings is that white/green building on the map Southeastern, right?
---
It's super frustrating when that happens. I went to someone's camp two days ago, was stuck under their house, and they saw me emoting for help. Sent the guy a message telling him I was stuck...and all he did was respond back saying "I know lol" 🙃
---
I mean, you can run around Morganstown and kill the bots around mama dolce for very little fuel usage, too.
---
There can't be anything lore breaking in that game just because all that happend and happens here is a [spoiler cut]. It's written on a terminal @ WS bunker armory.
---
Nah, there are Two kinds of Royal ... Ones in Junk (yours), the others in Aid ... the one in Aid is needed for the recipe
---
sorry bro =(
---
Maybe you are on a different platform but disappearing bodies happens probably at least once every 20 minutes for me on PC. It has gotten so bad I try to "take all" before the body hits the ground because of how bad it is. To me that isn't fun, I shouldn't need to have to spam "take all" just because they can't code the game properly to keep bodies of dead enemies around long enough to loot. Or worse yet, the mobs you kill and you just get the endless "loading" spinner going for 5+ minutes and still get no response.
---
I wanted to love this game I was extremely excited for it as I have family and spent time in Wv, and loved all other fallout games. Unfortunately this game has killed any joy I had about this game. 
---
I just feel like bethesda slapped its players in the face with this game and basically told us to go f ourselves. Hell look at their response about the bags as an example of proof they don't give a fuck. It just pisses me off and makes me sad that a game that had this much promise and could have been absolutely amazing turns out to be a mediocre at best cash grab that bethesda only cares about getting as much money out of as possible.
---
If they truly cared about the player base, they wouldn't have left bugs in for weeks at a time, they could have put out hotfixes like every other modern developer that releases online games. Instead they left game breaking bugs in the game for months. Hell, they left a bug in the game that completely broke the end game due to them having the date on the nuke launch timer being an unsigned integer which ended up rolling over and making nukes unlaunchable for over a week, and instead of fixing it right away with a 2 lines of code to change it fron an unsigned to a signed integer, instead they just let it fester with the whole endgame being broken and impossible to reach due to their bugs.
---
So for me I think the problem with it for me is, knowing how good it could have been if it wasn't just a souless cash grab, and it feels like bethesda is basically trying to take advantage of their biggest supporters and that just doesn't sit right with me.
---
Just did that too, really hoping somebody's got it
---
This is NOT a popular opinion and I accept the downvotes, but marsupial mutation is absurd and unnecessary. Got it naturally once, got rid of it after two jumps.

Make the “tent” a special foundation with yes limit being what you can fit on he foundation.  
---
Need skilled stacking and space management.    But you could manage a small shop or scrap center
---
I currently have 210 plans in my camp even some event plans from faschnate on Xbox I probably have them set too high but honestly setting the price on that many items manually is such a pain in the ass I just have them set to whatever their default is.
---
It is.
---
stuff that you built you can move, that your friend built you can't

I jumped on a roof where two of my friends were. I might have stuttered on the button while I was airborne and the trade request window came up before I landed.

Anyway, I wouldn't want to long press to jump. 
---
If you're having trouble now, definitely don't be on a team with Strange in Numbers active.
---
I bought mine off Grahm.
---
Queen drops of serum plans got removed in... patch 8 I want to say. 
---
Sadly. And I know why but it sucks. Also part of the reason you’re seeing far fewer queen nukes lately- there’s just no good rewards.
---
In on now. GT Dookieinyourhat
---
I found that writing the sign from right to left(ie backwards) made snapping super easy. I couldn’t even place most of the time when doing left to right.
---
Why is this getting downvoted? It's genuinely annoying to have to scroll through dozens of plans every time you want to look for something as a high level player
---
That's correct. The perk explicitly doesn't work when sprinting. Should work for sneak movement though.
---
The main problem with these movement speed perks is that none of them stack, as the maximum movement speed boost is capped to either 20 or 25%.
---
Even some of the ones you can complete are just so damn irritating. For example, the Rail enthusiast badge tells you to kill 15 enemies at each train station, but it NEVER spawns 15 there. Always like 13. It feels bad to have to make 2 trips every time with as grindy as it is anyway.
---
It's possible only if those pictures will be visible exclusively to you.
---
Does X ever mark the spot?
---
That's my point when I say that when a Dog is downed without being revived, they just spawn back at your C.A.M.P
---
I don't know, I thought it was a simple and decent request..
---
*sad mortem*
---
My husband would also appreciate this too Bethesda
---
No, that’s just ruin pvp even more than it already is
---
Sometimes it’s not too bad.   Like if the mark up is still less than the the base value of the plans I think it’s still pretty good.
---
Hmm never had those mutations, will definitely try it especially that luck section but might try and find me one of those black powders to I can swap between when I got a crit ready.
---
Can you dm me please?
---
he gets what he's given
---
&gt;ROFL, so you removed your comment where you claimed that fo76 didn't do extremely poorly and sold less than a quarter of fo:NV...
---
No?
---
You are 100% wrong about it selling less than a quarter of NV. Because New Vegas didn't sell well for the most part. Fallout 76 undeniably sold more than NV thanks to Fallout being way more mainstream after 4.
---
I **never** said 76 sold well compared to others in the series. Just new vegas. It very obviously didn't sell as well as Fallout 4, which broke records for the entire series.
---
Fallout fan all my life too.
---
Pre-ordered fallout 76, played every beta test runs.
---
But that was mostly a hot mess of bluescreens, duping madness and not to forget A.i. gliding while shooting with  derp gun pointing visuals.
---
Still the only game I play at the moment.
---
Normally more a solo player, but this game changed that again.
---
(And benefits in teamplay with some perks, can change alot)
---
Just picked up a lvl 50 twoshot explosive 44 for 800 caps
---
I don't agree with the degree of absolute loathing the game got and, to some degree, still has, but I understand. It's largely the context and the fandom.
---
Fallout players have a love/hate relationship for new ideas. They love them when they work, but they hate them until they work. They hated Fallout 3 for being a FPS, they hated New Vegas for not changing enough from 3, and they hated Fallout 4 for the reduced RPG elements. All of them became liked if not loved in time, but at launch, it sounded almost exactly like 76.
---
Add to that the multiplayer element. For solo players, it was too much multiplayer in their solo sammich. For multiplayers, it was too much solo for their Multiplayer pie. Smashing them together is going to sound disgusting no matter how you explain it, and it did sound disgusting to both sides. In hind sight, it's actually delivered really well on both the multiplayer aspect (Fallout with Friends) and delivering the ideals of a post apocalyptic life (some of the voice acting is outright chilling on the audiotapes).
---
Then, they started to break convention. Slap damage? Uuuugh! PvP Workshops? Urrrrrgh! No FFA PvP mode? RABLLE RABBLE RABBLE! Again, this turns back on the solo/multiplayer mashup. Sounds bad to both, appeals to neither.
---
Then, there was the bugs. The bugs were real, and they were shitty. Problem is, some folks have this idea that the world of gaming development is full of House-level miracle workers with unlimited budgets, and every bug can, should, *must* be nabbed pre-release. This idea was impossible pre-internet and pre-40gig games, so it should be no surprise that 76 launched with a shit ton of bugs. Yes, it was more bugs than it should launch, they needed about 6 months of QA testing to get that shit sorted. But the absolute hate bethesda got over the bugs was astounding. It's a bethesda game, they are always buggy as fuck for the first six months or so. Every fucking time. If that's a problem, don't get the game for the first six months. And wouldn't you know, the game is fairly good, right on time.
---
And now, we come to the current problem. Personal investment.
---
You see, the haters (not reasonable critics, the *real* haters) now believe, truly believe, southern baptist believe, that this game is a flaming shitpile. They believe the game is shit, so it must be shit. And as the complaints are fixed one by one, they must cling to something, at least the memory of the complaints if nothing else. I guarantee that right now, someone is desperately pounding out about how they don't hate the game, they just want to "help the game grow", or "the company should be held responsible." Someone else is furiously typing "they should never have released the game as buggy as they did." Or "There is no end game", which I agreed with until the latest content update and the oncoming legendary vendor. And no matter what patches happen, no matter what bugs are fixed, no matter how well this is going compared to other online games in terms of content release, it will never be enough, because they *believe* the game is a flaming garbage heap.
---
All this ignored the gold mine of views to be had by posting twenty videos about why Fallout 76 is Teh Worst Fallout Franchise Killer! All this also ignores the reasonable ones, the people who made note of the problems and reported them and, sure, complained about them, but without the rancor of "you killed mah franchise." Not every criticism is unreasonable... just most of the self labeled "critics".
---
TL;DR: The game had (and has) problems, but the context meant that the reaction was explosive.

sure thing! I have stuff on spotify and itunes under the same name, my soundcloud just has most of it:

IMO the pale rider should be spotless. since in the description you are to cleanse the wasteland, why not keep your armor clean when you clean up the wasteland?
---
This is not entitlement. This is idiots like you who don't know how a market works. IF you place your price to high... no one will buy it.  
---
And I am quite frankly tired of heading to camp only to learn the idiot is a scalper trying ot over price everything.   
---
The ingame prices can be quite healthy. Think it is funny seriums are cheaper then a legendary weapon in soem camps.  
---
  
---
But I am just tired of idiots trying ot sell a 1 star for prices that make no sense. Would you ever buy a level 20 bloodied weapon for 4,000 caps? Because I saw that earlier. The guy was saying it is what he would pay and yellign at players for telling him he is over priced.  
---
Also I have offically sotlen sells for scalpers now. You are not getting 2,600 for a marine combat helmet when most camps are selling it for 250 or 150.   
---
Sorry for the rant it isn't aimed at you just tired of some idiots out there which is why this topic is here to help inform on market prices in the actual game.
---
Which is 25% of base value? Seem to remember from a guide on here...

I think the actual failing of the Minute Men was that Preston was alive and our only real source of identity for them.  The responders greatly benefit from not being tied to an obligatory NPC that our opinion of significantly impacts our opinion of the entire faction.  I wonder if the Responders are presented through multiple different accounts and individuals partially because of how polarizing Preston was regarding the general opinion of the Minute Men.
---
Got bad news, my friend. Like most games, they're written under George Lucas Rules. "The lore is what I say, not them." Largly everything pre-Fallout 3 can be considered non-canon in Fallout 3+. If it helps, pretend it's an alternate universe where not everything became a brown toned dirt for the sake of simplified graphics and overtures of traditional mad-maxian post apocalyptic style.

I'll offer **1** spoiled vegetable for the whole shebang!!!!!!!!!!!

Pop a rad-x to make it go away temporarily if you hate it, or turn off starched genes and pop a radaway.

We don't need another "press X instead of square to enter your stash" or "inspect item to repair it" fiasco. People are really, really bad at keeping up with all the changes. Half the time I'm yelling at people, "oh yeah, they patched that", "have you never heard of the burrows?", or "you know you can just bulk your scrap to make more stash room and sell your crap right right?" and people look at me like I'm wasteland yeezus. "Bro, like how do you know that bro?". 
---
Because of this fine sub. But prestigious as the brotherhood of us filthy synths are... we account for like 1% of the player base. Open your mics, spread the good word comrades.

I'd argue the \*main\* story (the Overseer's Journey) gets kinda ham-fisted near the end, when &gt;!the Overseer goes from "we need to keep the nukes in check" to "the only solution is... MORE NUKES! BY EX! NOOOOO!"!&lt; That said, the rest of the near-main story is fairly good, and the side stories are, as always, a delight to stumble upon.

Not trying to change your mind - just throwing in my 2c...    
---
I know the atoms are front-loaded, but I'm currently over 100, have 3 toons and have completed 90% of the achievements, and I still got about 400 atom this week while actively ignoring challenges.    
---
At an abstract level there isn't a lot of difference between earning tadpole-badges for blueprints and completing challenges for atom-blueprints. 
---
If you have zero atoms and want to get 1400 atoms for that armor right now, that's going to be a soul-breaking grind. But if you're storing up a few 
---
&gt; The challenges are very tedious for their reward. 
---
You just wrote several posts around how you wanted that reward...
---
You are not... I'd love to be able to read the screen... I am both visual impaired &amp; almost deaf... So echo location items like silo keys &amp; any of the perk finder sounds are impossible for me to hear. It adds an extra layer of challenge to the game for me lol
---
Deadass? That's one hell of an autocorrect lol.

Thabk you was wondering this

That looks awesome! And you can now cook s’mores without a cooking station 👍

Frog in a jar is very, very cruel. No frog is going to be content with a small glass jar with a couple sticks in it.

I wish to hell wearing chameleon armour didn't screw up my view in the pipboy, too.  It completely bollocks everything up.
---
     This is just my opinion so take it with a grain of salt but I feel like you could put the 5/5 ranks of gunsmith to better use. My experience in the current endgame/lategame is that repairing weapons is incredibly cheap and the majority of the scrap required will find its way into your stash across the course of a session of reasonable length. If you have five points invested in intelligence you can swap gunsmith in and out to mod weapons but your build is lacking damaging mitigating perks like dodgy and serendipity which are both extremely helpful in both PVE and PVP in my personal experience. If you’re using heavy explosive weapons you won’t have a lot of room to run and gun but will instead be trying to unleash as many shots as possible onto one spot until your target dies. If you re-invest your points from Gunsmith you can get more ranks in lone wanderer, tenderizer, suppressor or take dodgy or serendipity. Even with good gear high level Gui, Deathclaws and other players can deal huge amounts of burst damage. Perks like Lone Wanderer and Dodgy will both help you drastically reduce incoming damage when maxed out and 3/3 ranks in Dodgy means you have a 45% chance to ignore incoming damage when at low health. This is again my personal opinion but I feel like those five points could be reinvested elsewhere.
---
&gt;  Hell, they left a bug in the game that completely broke the end game due to them having the date on the nuke launch timer being an unsigned integer which ended up rolling over and making nukes unlaunchable for over a week, and instead of fixing it right away with a 2 lines of code to change it fron an unsigned to a signed integer, instead they just let it fester with the whole endgame being broken and impossible to reach due to their bugs.
---
Do you live in a separate plane of reality where this wasn't hot fixed in a single day?
---
Sure is.  Never noticed it there before until I had to take a pic of a fossil for the badge.  So much I have missed by looking but not seeing....
---
I would legitimately get this in the atom shop if it was sized properly for the critter within.
---
Maybe they misunderstood what was meant to be a the bottom of the list lol. Have an upvote for balance!
---
Yeah, random stuff disappearing is a bug that's been around forever which they've shown no signs of actually having any desire to fix. Out of your stash, out of your inventory...
---
You can just shoot it down, don't need explosive.
---
But it's a sheep though lol. I needed a lion.
---
Nice find!
---
Also drops the new mounted bugs plans for camps. I've gotten boatfly, firefly, and stingwing so far.
---
I found them at the Harpers Ferry vendor if they aren’t at WS.
---
The dailies are getting silly... I don't mind a silly tedious one, but there should be a better balance. 2 easy, 2 medium, 1 one hard.
---
How are you even supposed to go out and catch Grahm in a workshop? Seems insane.
---
True, but that does not make it any less upsetting to some of us, just like some of the more gruesome recordings can be. The virtual animal itself is not upsetting, so much as the realization that people actually do this sort of thing in real life.

My Mom was a teacher. The provincial teachers association has an advert that insists that teachers are "avocating" for all of us.

Also, I had an English professor who couldn't pronounce emeritus properly.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Yup....lost an intielding sentinel robot arm the other day.. Into the abyss i guess
---
to my knowledge this has not happened to me with an item important enough that I noticed..
---
You did miss the buggy phase by picking it up later, it is becoming a full fallout experience, it just wasnt at release.
---
Actually from beginning to end you do both. Not one or the other.
---
Agreed I am going to start putting my known plans that I find into my shop for sale- seems like a lot of higher level players are doing this. I finally hit level 60! It would be higher but I’m juggling 15 credits at school at 26 hours a week food service
---
bethesda wont ban you for this. in cases such as this, even someone recording video of it isnt valid proof, bc like a million different things could have happened in a pvp encounter. just a few, legendary armors + perks can make it seem like someone is invulnerable, the person's internet connection could be bad, leading to false positive hit markers (he thinks you are in one place, but the game thinks you are in another), disparity in level can cause some wonky things to happen, if one player is significantly higher level than their target, damage is scaled way down. etc, etc. literally the only things bethesda cares about is duping and breaking TOS/Harrasement. so unless you are caught duping, or break TOS by calling someone a N\* or a F\*G or whatever, then you are fine. the number of times ppl said i was "cheating" bc of sentinal assasin armor defense is ludicrous.
---
I'm willing to trade the high capacity backpack mod.
---
Indeed
---
Yeah, an item I had listed for sale once. It was there one login, gone the next. Felt like a dumbass when the guy showed up to buy, especially having just listed it.
---
I've legit had level 100+ players claiming in voice chat that when the meter falls the event doesn't fail so there is no reason to keep the fire going...
---
That’s complete bullshit. The event fails when the meter gets to zero
---
Yeah. Good call. I found a level 10 suppressor's black powder when I was level 12 or so, and still roll with it. Pistols are so dang light, you can carry a bunch.
---
How do I rename things?
---
Craft a Frog Jar too.
---
This is good to know. Ran out of silver today for the first time ever building multiple cameras to sell and also crafting film for the photography badge. 
---
I was even in there taking photos of the Wendigo!  Ooof.
---
Depending on if it's 2/3* but I'd say about 6-8k for a 2* maybe 10 depending on a 3rd *
---
How do you mean?
---
It’s when they chase you around but are sliding around on the ground it gets really weird lol.
---
Aww...but I’ll probably still get it but it hah.

 Thanks.

**What we do:** We've designed a ranking system and tracker to add faction features for cooperative gaming that we feel Fallout 76 is desperately lacking. We do this by offering weekly missions and bounties for our members to complete, and track their progression by moderating mission completions on discord and logging using a custom made tool. We offer a full rank structure using the Knight, Scribe, and Lancer paths, as well as Officer roles that unlock optional responsibilities as you progress. Join the discord to find out more!

Would also be nice to see the chance of badges drop from the daily and events go up. Must have ran that event 8 times this afternoon and the dailys since they went live and not 1 badge from them.
---
Yep, though my max lvl Dragon musket still wasn't able to be spared. Didn't hotbar it, just renamed it. Best high lvl mothman instant killer around (so it can't vanish on me anymore) with a bloodied sneak attack crit. Was so careful for so long, lost it two days ago
---
It was worth a shot. Sometimes on ps4 assets will fail to load for me due to a cache error and shutting down the console for a minute helps when I log back in.
---
MOHAWKS!!! FINALLY!!! Thank you so much!
---
I thought the vendor stopped selling them a month or so back.
---
I don't have trouble just would be a nice qol feature. I dislike strange in numbers, makes the character run un a invisible floor mid jump
---
Don't forget the pink tiles
---
The free one in the atom store.
---
I don't hate the high jump just would like more control over it and be able to normal jump as well.
---
As a fellow archaeologist, I rolled my eyes as well. I figured they should had us go look at all the weird steel heads that are hidden in a few spots or even Hopewell Cave instead of the Wendigo Cave given that it has a holotape recorded by an anthropologist in there.
---
That is so cool - you should submit it for the next edition of Around Appalachia

That's fucking genious!
---
If you mean the army uniform from BOS technical data turn ins, I have a few on xbone. GT is Harry Wagstaff
---
I mean...  the PS4 got a price cut a few months after it came out. Then the newer version came out and the price of the original dropped...     
---
It's not super crazy that the items in the atom store would behave the same way.
---
I definitely paid too much for mine. It was the week after the event had come out and I had only succeeded in getting a lvl25 fixer to drop so it was nagging me not having it max level. And I was at max caps so I bit when he wouldn't budge on price. I think 1,000 would be reasonable, considering the vendor price of some of the crappier weapon plans.
---
Fish?
---
Do the crab people count (can't remember how to spell there name)
---
Who knew, having a friend would have saved you *all that time*! 🤣
---
Got a tse shotty unwilling to part with on PS4 it'll be bout 10k though as it's the only one I have
---
From the top of my head, Mirelurk Variants, Fog Crawlers, Gulpers and Anglers.
---
Those are the ones that have triggered previous  "Aquatic Enemies" challenges for me before.
---
Frogs?
---
If you give me 5 to 10 minutes to get out of bed and grab toast I can help you.
---
But I used my last 2 nuke cards yesterday so someone else will have to have a card.
---
When there's like 6 guys you ever see it kinda diminishes the idea of you being a general.  Makes it hard to think of them, much less think of them as a full faction.
---
I believe mirelurks anglers and gulpers count, I can't think of anything else. I would imagine frogs also count
---
GT: mark error 404
---
How much do you guys want to bet that if one was alive, they would just be a radiant quest giver
---
Mirelurks?
---
I hate how much first-aid you lose in survival mode. If it wasn't for the fact that you lose almost all of your first-aid items, I would play survival more.
---
CAMP destruction is only supposed to be possible if you’re engaged in PvP with the other player. That should mean that they hit you, then you hit back with pacifist off. It could also mean that they were in PvP with someone you were teamed up with. 
---
Or it could be a bug. There haven’t been a lot of reports of this since the patch, but it could be.
---
There is absolutely a main quest and absolutely a bunch of side quests and absolutely a $60 game. The community just realized they can get the good stuff cheaper if they shout that its bad.
---
So two choices. As soon as you're able to. Jump and run away!!! Or two, pull out your PA and jump in it if it allows you to set it out.
---
There's a three if you're lucky enough to spawn in close to a work bench, chair, musical instrument. Just interact with said item. This option can also be used to get in and or out of someone's locked camp.
---
PSN yota151 I actually need to be the conduit for the possum badges.
---
It's better than the white one... the white one is almost unusable in anything more than a 2/1 area.
---
Theyre definetly my favorite
---
Same, I just stick them up for whatever the initial price is set at. My shop is nothing but plans/recipes.
---
Are you on Xbox? Man, I will buy the shit out of that! Lol, I'm a collector of low level OP weapons.
---
Aye, this is a great idea.
---
I got bad news my friend. Your reading sucks. I'm not arguing that the retcon is good or not. I'm STATING OTHERS COMPLAINTS about story,lore, etc...
---
Wrong...please keep respawning the Deathclaw and radants with free food and occasional legendaries. 
---
That's why my camp is there.
---
Don't remember where exactly but on a mountain ridge overlooking cranberry bog is a beautiful mam made stone arch and the sunset coming up behind it is truly awe-inspiring.
---
ok.
---
Heres the problem.  If player vendors sell serums for anything less then 460 caps, they are losing money. If you find a player selling serums cheap,  buy them all, and sell them at train vendors to get more caps
---
yea i figured that out the hard way haha
---
Thank you kind sir
---
You good with trading right now?
---
Unless you read it prior, it wouldn't say known. But still F
---
I tried WS (and was greeted by a ton of level 40-50 legendary ghouls that ate me alive) and no luck there. I guess time to venture into further dangerous territory. ;; I just want pretty bricks RNG.
---
I'll be there. And hopefully I can finally revive an ally haha. Psn: Elder\_Cabot\_76
---
Still need someone too - analogemo
---
I'm on right now. Join my world and check my vendor
---
Nah, it's just a bug right now. You learn it as soon as you buy the plan
---
Its worse with wood foundations. Concrete helps but not completely.
---
They came back to Grafton (at least), with the last patch.
---
Hmmm, I bought it, but never used it. I will have to look the next time I log back into the game. Thx.
---
T-51 Dog power armor
---
There is no fun killing just to get a bounty in yourself, the pvp servers are hot trash, you don’t make anything for caps 12c off a level 50 player. Who’s going to chase down a 12c bounty?
---
This makes me chuckle. 
---
While I'm over here using radiation emitters and eating spoiled food to get my health just right to get Adrenal, Nerd Rage and Unyielding to kick in..
---
Just let the jukebox play, you don't need to play your self. It would be interesting if you could initiate revenge if another player took your junk. It's after all stealing.
---
You can tag them with a level 1 pipe gun and turret kills will then give xp.
---
I come back from an outing and have 5 meat piles with 2 legendaries in them is still rewarding without the xp. Just because people visited camp and turrets always hit the spawns.
---
Oh ok never noticed with me lol thanks
---
For me it’s just the paints are expensive most cool paints are 14 dollars each :|
---
Sucks
---
\*checks reply chain\* Bad news, my friend. I didn't even respond to you. Your complaint about my bad reading is, in fact, a result of your own bad reading.
---
Aid
---
Damn that sucks
---
Yeah it's really six of one, or a half dozen of the other. It's effectly the same server load to boost camp budget or to add the second mini camp. Really, they could do both, by increasing camp budget by 10-20%, and allowing this same amount to be used as a mini camp for those that would prefer it. So the extra 10-20% budget amount would be shared between both.
---
If they made a mini camp, they could make it only cost 5 caps to move.
---
Mammal was the first I did, then something else that I forgot that was easy as well. My camp always has 3 brahmin that spawn near it so that and other players camp made it easy. I decided to grind archer and got it in like 30 minutes and finally got the backpack lmao
---
yikes 1 week and no replies. it must not be dropping.
---
It took me weeks to find the tourist, and I found the fucker 3 times between yesterday and today all in spots i had kept going to
---
Laser rifle. Entirely effective at long range. Effective for many, difficult to handle for a few.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Glad you got it. Some of those are a hard task.
---
But imagine you could get that one design (spikes, or bones, or plague) and then be able to customise the colours to your liking... would make you at least more likely to buy 1 skin than none?
---
That they've release Blood Raider after Bone Raider on what to me looks like the same model, and asking you to pay $10 for what is 'just' a different colour scheme is kinda hmm.
---
Yep. That's the range I called mine in.
---
Yup saw this guy too and couldn't find squat on how he got it
---
I just stand in the middle and shoot players with an automatic Tesla rifle. I can keep the fire going and kill the legendary in time even with a camp full of very silly people flailing around with assaultron swords or whatever.
---
Tip: If you hit nothing with the Tesla it doesn't chain. If you hit anything, even the friendly robot camp counselor, it will chain.
---
Now if you have any tips for shoving players into the pylons for Sheepsquatch..... Please let me know.
---
I wish that they'd bring back the limited edition paints/skins they have randomly, like one a day, to get people to check out the atomic shop more often, because I really like the nukashine pa paint, but I missed out on it
---
That's why you have people 'renting' the plan instead of selling it
---
lvl 3's: any "powering up" powe plant quest starts a lockdown when you enter the building, and it takes a lvl 3 hack challenge to get out. on each door.
---
Lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate!
---
I know I'm late to the game but if you do this again for people it would also be nice to know if it's just regular Graham or 2* legendary Graham.
---
Yea that’s is very true but I still won’t be motivated to spend 14 dollars for the power armor paint if it was 5 dollars then hell yea
---
Lol, this happened to me and I just fast traveled to the base again and I was free.
---
The best weapons and armor dont usually end up in the vending machines. I dont gave the cap space to sell a 10k+ weapon without either planning the trade or using a mule.
---
In fallout 4 when the build zone had a higher defense rating it would spawn more enemies.
---
Plenty of areas have enemies with paths or random spawns around the map, maybe when you placed the camp they weren't there but they pass regularly. I don't think stopping all respawns because widdle babies can't defend their camps is a good idea.
---
Oh wow thank you. I have been server hopping, killing assaultrons looking for a board. But with your advice, I just went and picked one up.
---
I must have not met any today... hmmpf. Thank you!

nuclear winter suggest enclave going apeshit

Ultracite Gatling Laser and Plasma Grenade.

That might just be me, though.
---
Upvote for support.
---
Its right below the octothorp.
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop had a pack of them I found
---
I've got 70 or so... all marked at less than 100 caps. I've seen people selling them for less too.
---
If you do Sbq enough to acquire a decent amount of repair kits I would suggest losing the 5 points in Int for weapon durability , I myself run a bloodied 2 hand build and have replaced my durability card with the explosive so when she flies my shitgun( since bug fix it is not a shotgun but a shitgun) has more of an impact ie my off Weapon a bloodied double barrel hits almost as hard as my main weapon I’m currently at 89 repair kits and haven’t spent a dime just sbq fights
---
Was at my camp selling my useless wares when all of a sudden scorched appeared. NBD right? Just kill them and move along. Except I hear this loud explosion coming from my fusion generator room, that’s behind 2 LEVEL 3 LOCKED DOORS! the bastard spawned inside the room and ate my generator....
---
I have the white helm. No outfit unfortunately. On xbox
---
Success!!!! I waited 48 hours without logging in to my main, and then when I tried it in again it worked fine. I also did a scan/repair a couple of times, but it didn't really seem to do anything. I think we have a winner here - it looks like the magic number is somewhere between 24 and 48 hours, and may vary by each player's situation, but it definitely works. For Google posterity - definitely try this fix if you encounter a similar problem in the future.
---
It sucked to be without my main, but on the plus side I made 25,000 caps RPing vendor bot on my alt. On the down side, now I have to remember how to actually play the game! LOL
---
Same. I found mine in a Gulper but spent hours farming Gulpers and no more luck. :\
---
Ever since latest patch I feel like the game has been more glitchy
---
This game should NEVER cause you to have to restart the operating system.
---
What system?
---
So what you’re asking is to make Fallout 76 camps closer to Animal Crossing? Cause I’m totally cool with it, just had to make sure
---
Yeah I do it too but I was bored and thought it was a good idea
---
Oh sorry I didn’t specify. I’m on xbox and my GT is EchoXeda. I am online and in a server rn :)
---
Agreed. I have a too with 800 plans on it. Scrolling through the whole list to get to the bottom to see what plans I don't know is challenging. The mouse wheel scrolls a bit faster than holding down the down button Putting the know plans last would be a great benefit. At least maybe implement a scollbar, and/or make the page up/down and home/end keys work!
---
Let me tell you about my friend Ultracite Gatling Laser....
---
Can’t help then. Sorry.
---
You're obviously a brainless victim for the sake of being the brainless victim. Get off your little soft baby ass and kill the shit attacking your home. You're the problem here.
---
That cannot be (and is not) true for plasma grenades.
---
Wow.
---
Things are considerably better, but you might be bored if you don't make your own fun.  There are a ton of events and quests to do, but  if you have to have NPCs then you are going to be dissapointed.  I think BSG did a lot to respond to player complaints and genrerally the game is, on the whole, more stable, but there are times the servers are overwhelmed and you'll get a lot of disconnects.
---
Serums can sell for up to 500 caps each.
---
You didn't already have it. It's just glitched.
---
Not a high level, but can take a pylon or 2?
---
Great write up.  I used the bones from the Mothman sacrifice at Point Pleasant and grabbed eggs while I was there, then collected the rest of the bones from the dumpsters near the Whitespring service entrance.  And yes, wear the White Wolf Fedora.  There is a whale skeleton in the Toxic Valley near Wavy Willards that counts as a fossil too.  It is big, you can't miss it, and relatively safe to get to.
---
But they DO use whips right?
---
I think there is a radbear in the UFO playground equipment in the southeast corner of the fairgrounds.
---
I can connect to anything with legs that walks😂 eyebots &amp; bugs that fly cannot be hit by me :-/
---
One thing that’s helped me is not moving for a second or two after grabbing the wire. After those couple seconds I connect it to whatever needs power. I think sometimes if you move too fast after grabbing the wire you will jump until you try again. At least on Xbox.
---
No you are correct this one is too tame this is probably the one I was looking forward to the most so that doesn't help I really wanted like a cloak or a hood or a sense of mystery... Maybe a skull  hanging from his belt area, or his face hidden I agree it did have to be flashy just more then a white painted suit of armor I was really let down.
---
You still need help killing her?
---
You're saying trying to exploit doesn't provide you a reward?
---
Pass it along to another player
---
Sure
---
I have went out of my way since the game came out to collect every tale and was really hoping they would have added a new one for the sheepsquatch when he was put in and I completely support this idea or even a way to load the tapes into your base so people can listen to them instead of the radios I have setup.
---
You're welcome!  I've been shoveling mine out the door for 2 caps each or less, regardless of rarity.  I just want them gone.  I don't even pick up the duplicates anymore, but I try to sell off quest reward plans if I already have them, for really cheap.
---
I actually do have a few Plasma plans I can put out there, thanks!
---
When someone asks if it’s worth returning I’ve been seeing people post a link here.
---
If they at least shot I wouldn’t care.. but there are kids who sit there &amp; just watch... they don’t do anything for the event &amp; nothing else is like that? When I do free range there isn’t a kid just walking around doing nothing. Only Campfire Tales..
---
Can you not get them in card form from amazon or something and redeem them on your Bethesda account in game/online?
---
So in your fix how many players lose weps/gear because dupes run through this game like all the whiners who are never happy about anything
---
If you're a PS4 User, a lot of the blame is on them rather than BGS. Look at any BGS release on PS4 and they're always either a couple patches behind, or buggy as all hell.  
---
Its also worth noting the reason we don't have cross platform is because of Sony and the PS4.  
---
Its not like its impossible for BGS to do better, but a big part of it is how hostile Sony can be sometimes to gave devs, especially BGS.
---
What did it drop for you? I haven’t beaten one yet!
---
BE Radium with less AP cost
---
I've always wondered this, then I thought about what would happen for items you where you don't have enough resources? If there are multiple items that require the same insufficient resource to be repaired, the game would have to prioritize one over the other with some kind of ranking system. Not that it can't be done, but it may not be as simple as it appears.
---
I still haven't completed Free Range yet because nobody defends the brahmin.
---
Every archaeologist I work with is responsible for the paleontology in the office also. So there's that...
---
The only dick move is blaming someone else. It’s not your stuff if you die. If you make it back it becomes yours again. Not before.
---
So don't fucking buy it.
---
I think it might have been fixed in the unscheduled maintenance last week? Don't really want to say much in case one of the 20 people in the world who still don't know how it works read this, but I was scouting around some vendors looking for nuka wild/grape for the possum challenge and noticed that the source of the dupe kept saying it was busy
---
This was my favorite read of the day! TY
---
Not much, I got 5 mysterious quills, a Sheepsquatch skull, its just a named bramin skull, and some mysterious fur, it stands like a Deathclaw but has the ass of barren of hell and that fucker is hard to kill so good luck
---
you are right a lot would but how ever they could implement the ids and the items before hand would not have them, and thus the issue is gone.
---
Lol this economy is so broken like any other online game.  I'm sure your friends have bought dupes knowingly or not. However they can not claim ignorance because anyone playing this game knows the stuff's out there.
---
You all have a problem with dupes yet you dont care that ppl by caps with real life money....  If this is the biggest problem in your life then I'd say your doing just fine....lmao everyone needs a soapbox at sometime I guess
---
Things I personally look for are: 
---
1. Dogfood (5-7c)
---
2. Cosmetics I don't have
---
3. Plans for new character
---
4. Stimpacks (5-8c) if I'm low
---
5. Weapons and Armor
---
20hrs
---
Plus a new holotape on tales from the West Virginia hills with a sheepsquatch story
---
How old are these tutorials? I ask since they took down servers last Tuesday/Wednesday to address some of them already. 
---
My advise, if you're aware of duping or something similar. Go to Bethesda site and open a case. Report the bug, include as much detail as possible. How you did it or where they can get that information, such as the specific youtube channel/video etc.... having all the details goes a long way, that way they can replicate the exploit and find a way to address it. Would also help in identifying known dupers and ban them.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks for the Info my man!
---
Bad bot.
---
Oh shit I seriously was just trying to buy it from another player. I didn’t know this! Thanks
---
The average price seems to be about 500. Serums are in high demand, as many mid level players don’t have enough caps to buy from the enclave, and don’t want to risk getting bad mutations.
---
So we would forgive the past infractions, and only punish those in the future so how is that fair? Lol
---
Before next time ctrl alt delete and bring up task manager. Make sure the "always on top" is selected. Now you can actually use this when fallout crashes.
---
I might trigger some people but that gun is trash for my character and I don't even know what kind of build I have I just randomly pick what I feel it's necessary so I've got a random build
---
well most were not forgiven and some where perma banned
---
Dude you can get all the nuke drinks at white springs I believe?
---
Tamed before patch 9 (used animal friends)
---
I have a lvl 21 deathclaw (daisy) she frolicks is my maze of water purifiers out back 👍
---
Since the patch I've ran some test
---
Key is stay in passive
---
-Tested random players trying to kill her (invincible) piad them no mind
---
-Teammate attacking her (invincible) piad no mind
---
How they can die (untested)
---
Passive off pvp entered everything is game
---
-Enemy spawn by base (If you catch this before game checkpoint there's a chance to sever hop and still be there.)
---
Daisy ran off one day a couple sever hops and i found her back home safe and sound Appalachia robotic Humane Society at its finest👍
---
You're welcome! Just glad to give them a home. I always visit camps with lots of plans too, gotta catch them all!
---
Being on the leaderboard and having a bounty are the same thing though, essentially if you kill you are on the leaderboard most of the time... I get your point about the value though and having to cut that in half is a problem.
---
And not getting caps for kills I’m
---
Not going to pvp for a bounty then pay off that and get caps, it’s stupid
---
Yeah whitesprings has a bar with all the nuka colas available.
---
I found her in Welsh and posted the vid!
---
I've found 3 so far.  Maybe Thursday they'll be a lil more common.  Also found out tonight the BlackBerry recipe is bugged :/
---
I got a Sheepsquatch Staff that is an okay, but literally huge melee weapon
---
The wolves and I [have reached an uneasy truce] (https://i.imgur.com/21Ux3s2.jpg) at my camp.
---
Are you really having that much trouble with it? You know you can kind of aim yourself to get through doorways right? If you use bird bones, you can kind of pull yourelf down to on the stick/keyboard to fall a little faster. You can also steer yourself in mid-air.
---
I just feel like we'd get a lot of "well the broke marsupial, guess I'm skipping this patch" types of comments. The less the core mechanics and controls get changed, the better. People have lives and don't read the changelogs on reddit. (Correct, I have no life). 
---
Sure I wish they'd re-balance weapons, but I think thats a lot less dangerous than a video coming out next patch by youtuber YongYeah, saying "Well guys, they broke marsupial, the game is utter garbage, uninstall it, and you should stop playing it like I have. Like I clearly don't play this game, at all".
---
Dead people have more personality that minute
---
Men
---
Decent legendaries at reasonable prices - furious or vampire's on a fast hitting weapon, two shot/bloodied/quad/double on pretty much anything, instigating on high damage weapons, explosive/swing speed secondary effects on any applicable weapon, etc.
---
Plans for pretty much anything. Many of them are rng-based, so high level players might still not know how to make an ultra light metal arm for example. People will buy many of your plans if you just leave them up. This doesn't really apply to recipes though unless it's for a rare chem
---
Rare or unique outfits
---
Holotape games sell strangely well, mine sold for a hundred caps each within a few hours
---
I haven't tried this but ammo at 1c each (maybe a bit more for fusion cores, mini nukes, etc) and commonly used junk are apparently top sellers too
---
A white fire helm😭 i got the clean red one, Captain.
---
I've tried that, and on **VERY** rare occasions, that works.
---
Yeah I think you’re right.  Beefy as those forelegs are, I imagine it was a real fight to get the poor little guy in the jar. That and the electric shocks.
---
I'll try that. Thanks!
---
Uhm there’s already data mining on it and it’s BR and team death match. A sadistic AI runs the whole thing and it’s not clear if it’s Vaulttec not Enclave
---
[deleted]
---
That's neat!
---
Rent it out while you still can. I paid 1k to barrow it from someone. For some reason just acquiring it makes you learn it. You can’t even read it
---
I also hope this gets fixed soon, all these arbitrary camp limitations make it so frustrating, and I just found out about this bug the hard way. :(
---
Mine usually will repair most of the stuff but not all if I am missing materials
---
But why sell them for 375 if you can get 500 from a vendor?
---
Dem’s good eatin’!
---
Yeah I understand that point to an extent. The main reason for it is to fix the broken suicide mechanic which is horrible.
---
Yeah, but you wouldn't believe how long it took me to find it. Had to find an old thread from a few months ago. Apparently I ran right past the small room with the soda vendor on my first pass through
---
Ahhh that’s my bad then. Apologies mr. giantpunda.
---
Yo thank you for this I already joined and that tracker is pretty neat as well
---
You're talking about having multiple accounts in a single app. This isn't having several accounts meeting online, this is several accounts using a single games files simultaneously, more of a multiple personality disorder than a group get together. It probably could be done but not without substantial re-working of the games underlying architecture, hell, probably substantial re-working of THE CONSOLE'S underlying architecture.
---
Scrap other syringers
---
I've sold every single magazine I put in, 25 to 50 caps.  Oddly, only one bobblehead at 50 to 75 caps.
---
Its sitting in my vendor. So if you're on xbox, come by. My GT is : BloodshotMikel. I'll be on in the morning
---
Fr that’s it
---
People also use real money to buy weapons and armor. None of that is okay. Its against terms of service, and in a generally co-op game like 76 its the worst part of the player base that's obsessed with this real money trading and duping.  
---
People get upset because not only can it force a majority of items to be only available for real money, it also absolutely ruins the servers, because all the duping methods involve abusing the "Checkpoint" system the game uses to save your character/inventory.   
---
There is no good reason to defend anyone doing real money trading or duping. People who have bought duped items are also victims, as there is no real way to tell if an item is duped. There are warning signs to be sure, however I think its unreasonable to blame the people at least trying to play the game legitimately rather than the people who are generally responsible for things like server stability loss, or the fact we don't get a punchbowl anymore.
---
And the chalky pepto-bismol pink or pale mint green bathroom sinks, tubs and toilets.
---
Heck yes, well negotiate tomorrow. I'll add ya
---
PLEASE. I feel terrible for this poor froggy.
---
I think it’s a skin, once you finish the tadpole quests
---
Unfortunately the collector badges don’t count vendor purchases. Just tried it with the unstoppable magazines for my alt.
---
You wouldn’t also happen to know why I can’t milk Brahmin I’d tried no hyperbole atleast 500 times and not once have o gotten any milk
---
Lol cry more bud, don’t bring junk next time
---
They are skins. If you havent finished the tadpole mission you cant use it.
---
I’m down, ps4 username kibbles_123g
---
I got the armor plan from the grafton train shop but I don’t see the option to build it
---
You have to be able to craft a regular backpack by doing the questline first
---
How do you craft legendary armor?
---
I love how all the food builds are down voting you
---
Yeah, it's a bit rare. The problem is it has like 20 different sights just in case you want to switch from a recon scope to a night vision scope on your extremely useful syringer
---
Or even better, get a good chunk of scrip for it.
---
I havent defended anybody other than state some simple facts and my opinion and to claim ignorance of not knowing, but seeing the warning signs is not a valid defense either.  We all know drop rates in this game are terrible yet there are countless amounts of Godroll armor and weps running around this game and ppl claim I didnt know it was duped I'm mean COME ON MAN
---
That's them.
---
Assuming I didn't have friends help me with this huh? That's cute. Next time, why don't you actually explore the game instead of being lazy. ;)
---
Thank-you for that, I'll check it out and add it to the list. :)
---
That sounds sooooo cool! But I don’t know how they’d feel about a ghoul joining there rank (canonically speaking). Would it be okay to use one of my alternate characters who may fit in more?
---
Added Scorch receiver to 3* combat rifle and it became 4*
---
Thank-you for that, I'll have a look and add them to the list. :) Cheers for the input.
---
I use the gold sharing thing and don’t have a issue connection wise
---
I'm getting on soon
---
If that was the case then I suppose they should just stop adding new features and balancing all together.
---
Bloodied + Born Surivival = god mode.
---
A tip? Maybe get on the mic and shout “THE SHEEPSQUATCH WILL NOT TAKE ANY DAMAGE UNTIL ALL THREE PYLONS ARE ACTIVATED!!!”
---
Coming from Destiny, you literally have to guide people through events. If you have a mic I would honestly suggest trying to do so.
---
I'm on PC, sorry. Mentioned that in the title
---
I usually set my prices at roughly 10% value. So a 200 cap item id sell for 20 caps. Im bot in it for the caps, i just want to help.
---
Thanks for the tip!  Wasn't looking forward to crafting all the fuel to complete this.
---
210 is likely very low. It’s an event that only takes place once a year (maybe), so those plans will be very highly sought after for new players and players, like myself, who didn’t earn all of them but earned extras. 
---
But I’d gladly buy any ones I’m missing for 210.
---
I think you get 1 shot at milking and its random. You cant spam the same cow. Id say its 50/50 but my odds are worse.
---
Player vending.
---
I can help on PS4, except for the SB...
---
Only level 20.
---
One of the clicks on the controller sorts the stuff differently. Does it move the stuff down?
---
It’s all good man , I probably should’ve payed more attention to the title
---
God bless you
---
I have quite a few 30+ for sale at my shop. Honestly why doesn’t everyone over lvl50 have 4 shops available/stocked/ and machines labeled with what they carry?
---
I’ve seen only one other that has their shop set up like fully like I do.
---
Wow. That's mega cheap. Would have thought you could do 10 each for weapons and stims.
---
Yeah, there’s way too many small things about camp decorating that should be different.
---
I’m waiting for the day that they add different styles of floors/roofs or make it so floors can be used without stairs.
---
I would like more blue Power Armour. Currently only my X-01 suits my style with the Quantum paint!
---
.308 and .50 Caliber Ball ammo.
---
I just wish I could find some more raider plans it's been hard as hell for me to try to make a raider set
---
Plans. Lots of plans. 
---
Only if it's well priced though. I've seen people sell some basic and camp plans for 100+. Not even the good stuff.
---
I noticed some players have more than 1 vending machine. I take it they have their own separate stash limits each?!
---
Nah to easy to make they have to be impulse buys. Price them how you feel but I don't know who's buying stims for more then 10c when they are easy to make.
---
I see them for like 40c and wonder how long they sit in the stash.
---
Just remember pink. its in the pink room.
---
.556 ammo
---
.50 ammo
---
Lead
---
Adhesive
---
Plastic 
---
Steel
---
Wood
---
I typically make the same route each day, hoping to land some legendaries at Harpers Ferry and Whitesprings. I’ll grab all loot(junk) that I come across, load it to my store and most of it sells while I explore Appalachia.
---
Easy to say when it's not your stuff isn't it? You seem like the kind of person that would do it. But that's all part of 'roleplaying as a raider' right?
---
Usually 200-300 is a good range. I make mine with relatively cheap materials that I buy/farm and sell at 170-190
---
Lol food build, don’t bring what you’re not willing to loose it’s as simple as this
---
What did the fox say?
---
And if you don't have stash space, have some junk that you're planning using asap, but still want to partake in the event?
---
How about you get good and manage your stash better
---
The weight is all shared with your stash.  Each of your four units can have 30 item groups listed each, 120 in total.
---
Pm’d
---
BEST QUESTION OF REDDIT Today my friend LOL.
---
I absolutely love it. XD
---
Approach it from the train station. The parking lot across the road usually has just mole rats although there might be higher level enemies but the WS robots will take care of them. Then just north of the parking lot will be an opening giving you access to the entrances to WS.
---
Thanks. Guess I need to start that
---
Just out of curiosity what is the glitch that prevents you from playing your main?
---
I been doing the same thing. The thrill of the hunt!
---
What do
---
You mean
---
Ahh, cool. I've got the password to break the lock-down on Poseidon Energy plant. And in all honesty, I haven't really been bothered with Monogah or Thunder Mountain. I'll scout around the power stations and suss that out. Cheers for that mate.
---
Yeah there are certainly many players who dont know a thing about trading, ive seen some sell stimpaks for 40 caps each and serums for 2000+. Whereas i bough a full suit of ultracite pa for 15 caps and many plans for &lt;10 caps
---
40 is just OTT agreed. I mean just 10. I've successfully sold both at 10, hence why I brought it up.
---
You're right about the impulse buy thing. I started out pricing competitive vs what vendor bots sell at e.g. 60% their cost but no one buys. 
---
Now I consider the vending to be stash removing with a little upside. Feels less bad about potential caps lost.
---
You'll need that razorgrain to repair your entire base
---
I believe the plans are vendor only but then again I don't do workshops. 
---
I also think they are rank locked. That they won't show up until you're a certain level.
---
the best thing to do with so many known plans is either 1 to sell them or 2 give them away. Once they're known you no longer really need to possess them.
---
I have almost 100 plans at my camp and 90% are discounted heavily lol.  Only ones I don't are ones I do the work for but even full price on a 50 cap recipe is not bad
---
It was something weird, whenever i tried to connect with my main, it would disconnect automaticlu, but i could play with my mules just fine
---
Haha full of solutions aren't you? It's just as easy as what you say it is, never mind the collectors or those who run shops I guess. Luckily it wasn't me that this happened to
---
PC
---
I mean I have 210 plans listed they range in price from 25 to 650 I think.
---
🤔
---
How did you buy a full suit of ultracite? It doesn't let you sell PA frames. Did the guy sell each individual part labeled "Ultracite Left Arm" etc for 2-3 caps each?
---
Yeah buddy I am, manage your weight better don’t bring things you don’t wanna lose and get gud at the game
---
Hahahahahahahahaha, i do that in real life. 
---
Aka getting a new TV so i sell my old one for the most amount possible, i coud not imagine mhself doing that in a videogame
---
Did you accomplish those while the game was in beta mode?
---
If so, then they are locked out and have to start a new character and complete them again.
---
If not, that's odd.
---
I saw you can get smores recipe from the camp fire event but haven't gotten it yet
---
He had two power armour frames both for 15 caps each
---
Yo what brainlet bought an AA exploding railway for 50k?
---
Also I'm hoping I get lucky and find good legendaries for sale, I have had no luck finding good ones m
---
That shouldn't be possible...
---
Lol hes being sarcastic
---
Why?
---
Randy Baby! Yeah!
---
Haha ok champ. Why doesn't everyone play the game exactly the same as you?? That would make it really interesting wouldn't it...
---
There is also something about number of locations looted.  Like you have to loot 61 boxes, before box 1 is refilled. Other stuff is time limited, and some seem tied to the server itself.  There may be other factors as well.
---
Or you know... have an easy way to access them out of game. I really want to post some screenshots but I can’t get them out of the game.
---
It would cut back on the people crying about loosing their junk
---
r/iamverysmart 
---
Lol, found the sophomore.
---
Actually my friend had just sold one for 50 k, a tse. So i sold it to him and he found a buyer real fast
---
Damage bug is gone on most weapons
---
TSE does not one shot scorchbeasts anymore
---
Sentinel assassin does not make you invincible anymore
---
Bobby pins don't weigh .1 pounds anymore
---
Between a handful of cap sinks and player vending, caps actually have value now
---
With exchange machines and tomorrow's purveyor update, low tier legendaries actually have value now
---
Most weapons are at least usable now
---
I'd not expect Bethesda to be versed in such things. Formally being in the military reading some terminals, see some poses, uniforms, and hearing some of the military lingo and language it often cringes me. Due diligence!
---
You are welcome. I have so many from being a hoarder, figure it'll help everyone out
---
Yea no I didn’t play the beta just noticed I haven’t been getting my achievements
---
And that's what's most important right? haha
---
I know that feeling.   It can be tough.     If you want to power level,  glasses cavern is okay, ghoul hordes are great.    You could set aside just 45 minutes with a base near white springs.   Eat drink sleep and play music, then rush the golf course, server hop and repeat.
---
Tbh would it matter? People will find a way a circumvent the system as we/they do now.
---
I saw a full excavator suit at 50 caps each pieces
---
1. You have to complete the tadpole quest to unlock the ability to craft backpacks first.
---
2. It is NOT a skin. It is a completely separate backpack that you have to craft.
---
I priced them at 20-30c and they sat for a day then some bought all of them.
---
Yep found 3 in the grill thanks
---
How sad is it that they can’t even kill the bugs well then?
---
Because if everyone focused on bugs then you’d clear each wave no problem still
---
The new system allows players to snap a foundation to an existing foundation.  So, if you place your purifier first (near a foundation), you can then snap a new foundation to the existing one on top of the same place where the purifier is and it will cover up the bottom portion of the purifier and allow a clean-ish looking interior purifier.
---
No apparently you guys loosing your junk is that’s why y’all are compiling on Reddit
---
Even better: each roll is the equivalent of killing an NPC with said star level, so you can still get 1* legendaries from the 3* roll
---
Did you look at enclavedb
---
I mean, the Responders are a logical faction, especially since most of them were probably members of some kind of public service (Firefighter, Police, Paramedic) so it would be reasonable to believe that they would continue their line of work after the nation fell to chaos. 
---
The Minutemen are like "Hey, remember these guys from 500 years ago? Let's be like them and morph whatever they did into an official-unofficial military force." Dunno who thought of the idea at first, but they must have loved reading an American school textbook in their post apocalyptic youth.
---
All...the...time...!
---
Fallout 76 is bad. Ily
---
Where can I read more about this I haven't experienced this at all. It's like 20h Everytime for me.
---
Vampire's won't do anything against a one shot. So if you can avoid all of the meta min-maxers, it will work out all right. You'd probably be better with a vampire's combat shotgun or gatling laser or something though
---
What would they look like to other players? They won't be able to see your pics.
---
K-9 Power Armor
---
Not updated yet.
---
Very early on they used the phrase "junk decoration" and I think that's what got folks (including myself) hoping for something OCD-like but ever since then, they've only used the "display" phrasing.
---
This comment made me lol. Have a cookie 🍪
---
I mark all my plans down, power armor station, 500 caps, power armor mods, 200 caps, etc
---
Yeah I did that last night. Also spent more caps fast travelling than I saved. I just love bargain hunting. And gawking at people’s houses.
---
Oh wow. Yeah that would be worse haha.
---
Look there or nukacrypt, I think that they have them once they are solved.
---
The s’mores are given to you by doing the camp fire tales quest. The catch is you cannot get them when you are alone. You have to compete the quest in a group because of how the rewards scales.
---
with a jet pack mod
---
we are creating truly terrifying stuff here
---
I can craft you a free witch costume if you want?
---
Btw what are you on, I know it doesn't matter for codes.
---
How would you accomplish this as a programmer in the current game engine?
---
Assuming that you could kill 3 waves worth of creatures before the kindling meter runs out. I don’t think that’s possible
---
Pinky promise you’re not lying?
---
Use the cat topiary
---
Dude swear! I’ve got a couple posts I could show ya.
---
3* random item roll
---
Here, have a cloaking wood arm
---
Xbox.
---
Rebuke taken. I apologize.
---
the campfire gave me nothing. no plans, no badges, no recipes. nothing. Just a little bit of exp, and im the one who triggered the event and did most of the work. This questline sucks.
---
If you want a free Bowie knife, grab one on the bench around the campfire at the campfire tales location
---
You are so lucky. I wish I could find a decon shower for anything under 1k. The people I’ve sound selling plans either have lots of cheap but known plans, cigarette machine plans (which I don’t care for no matter how cheap) or ridiculously expensive plans. 
---
One day I’ll get lucky
---
I know dogs are coming as I’ve found armour for them. I just hope you can name them like you can weapons. So you could possibly have a ‘Toto’.
---
have a medal my friend great post.
---
makes so much sense its not hard to collect kindling from around the trees :).
---
I could see gears being very easily accidentally used and thinking they were lost though.
---
DAMN u/bit-by-a-moose just drank a huge bucket of piss
---
Thanks. Tried it for like 20 mins before giving up. Pretty sure only one spawns per server, so the RNG is just ridiculous.
---
I’m just giving up trying to work around their dumb design decisions. No camera for me. Less atoms for me. As intended. Won’t ever spend a damn dollar now though, on principle.
---
.308 cal, .45 cal, and 5.56mm do. Not 10mm, 5mm and smaller rapid fire rounds though
---
Get the super duper card for sure. Keep it on whenever you craft Anything. It gives you a chance of making double ammo, chems, food, weapons.... pretty much everything. And the ammo smith card for extra ammo. I don't blame you for not wanting to take of the ammo factory cause a lot of people will fight for that one but you might have luck grabbing a few other workshops that have what you need. I usually hold a couple for a few hours at least and just let it go when someone else tries to grab it cause I'm not a fan of pvp.
---
Oh god LOL. The worst part is I can see that happening.
---
Right?? Lol
---
I wish it were incompetence, it would be less egregious than just trying to gate content and atoms behind RNG to slow us down.
---
Recently got a level 35 furious dragon from whitesprings. Haven't used it yet but curious, does the furious proc if you attack with a different weapon first? It says "damage increases after each consecutive hit on the same target, reduced weight by 90% and bashing increased by 40%". Depending on the answer I might just sell to the legendary vendor for scrips
---
I don't really trust anybody so I have mine for sale on my vendor machine.  Someone can buy it and rent it to others.
---
Yes! Anyone on PC have a neon letter plan to sell?
---
&gt; So instead of getting as many rolls as you want as long as you have the script, you're limited to only one roll of each type per day. 
---
I am actually going into this upcoming venture expecting to get just one choice of the four options ( one 3\* melee, one 3\* ranged weapon, one 3\* armor, or one mystery pick) per day.
---
PS4 ? Psn?
---
I picked that one up and then got a higher level cultist blade as a drop from Nia lol
---
Like in footlocker!?
---
Half the problem is that if you fast travel to the event it takes 30+ seconds for any of the quest items to load in. So if you arrive in the last stage of the event it's often impossible to collect any kindling because it hasn't spawned in yet.
---
Yes, same name on here.  I just logged off for the night about 1/2 hour ago, about to head to bed.
---
 I'll be back on tomorrow night.
---
Yeah, digested goo is way harder to come by, and you can autoscrap it if you're not careful.
---
yeah, got that bug too. had to grab a random bowie
---
That's interesting because I wasn't thinking that was going to be the case. But Im interested in what other people think how it will work.
---
Very nice! Looking like Domri Rade.
---
Unless they quick patched it, the meter resets after each wave. 
---
Also. If so much as one person has a Tesla rifle it’s doable without meter reset.
---
At least a few days
---
Umm on a similar note did I just miss the existence of the X01 military paint sold from the MODUS vendor or was that also recently added? I've been curious ever since I picked that up if  my rolls have just been shit until now or something else is going on.
---
If you do the free range event two of them spawn at the end! I want to say it’s 100% of the time (I’ve done it three times happened all three!)
---
No no. To hell with the scene kids... it’s not some old thing or generational thing.. it’s just objectively the worst group in the history of the US.     And that includes daughters of the confederacy, hipsters, and hippies
---
Don’t forget the screws and teeth
---
Buffout please. I can make a manportable cold fusion reactor at a tinkerers bench but I can't make anabolic steroids?
---
It **seems** to make a difference because you’re using plastic to bulk all that.
---
Some things actually weigh more bulked.
---
Agreed. This seems like very simple testing on Bethesda's part to me. Please give us a list of challenges that **DO** work.
---
I'll be happy when magic molerats no longer bypass all my turrets, pass through the air and destroy my fusion generator every time I'm away from my base.
---
It's on the second floor behind a keypad door with no windows.
---
The bugrats need to go.
---
Serums are really easy to make once you have the recipe, and you can only sell ~3 serums daily.
---
Same
---
Shhhhh you're gonna ruin my $1500 Tales from West Virginia scheme
---
Everytime someone comes to my camp I get to kill the grafton monster again and I make about 25 caps and some resources
---
I completed Hunter, Athlete and Archer.  Athlete is the easiest, as long as you have the stats.  Hunter isn’t too bad if you grab the required weapons and just use them for the kill-shot.  I got the “kill a Yao Guai with a Syringer” credit by bringing it’s HP down to a sliver and just bashing it with the Syringer.  Archer is also really easy if you actually have the crossbow and a decent amount of bolts (just one-shot low-level enemies).
---
I found there are some certain spot that will spawn things, I used had a few hostile animals that always appeared suddenly in my base and biting the same spot, at first I thought it's from the road, but then I finally found they were spawned and float up to the top of the foundation, instantly start their bite xD
---
Anyway, I then uncovered the place and made it roofless(was luck it's on the cornor of my building actually), now when that one or two animals pop up, my turrets will deal with it fast since it's in the middle of them
---
I'm not sure if turrets will be mad about radstags or tabbys though lol
---
I sell stims for like 20c and they usually all go when I’m on.
---
Lol yeah I haven’t needed junk in a long time so I don’t even loot her😂 once repair kits came out I just do the queen &amp; use those kits. Workbench is too clunky for me &amp; glitches out half of the time so I can’t even see the mods on the gun I’m looking at🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, I bought the remaining plans I needed and I believe I paid a bit more, but then again I have low charisma and didn't have hard bargain yet.
---
I'm on PC and was looking for the puncturing pole hook mod. This came up in Google. Pleasant Valley did indeed have the mod. Thanks for helping me find it!
---
Not saying that particular plan was worth more than 50 caps, but sometimes plans can have a low cost and be quite rare. So smart people will price it higher than the official price.
---
I feel good about one of my builds and then I see one that is so impossibly perfect I cry a little bit
---
Even at 1c per round? I’ve had ammo in my vendor forever and no one buys it.
---
View photo gallery, screenshot and save them via the Xbox app.
---
Is it sad that I wouldn’t even be surprised? I would honestly expect this from Bethesda
---
Congrats and you probably will. Just take it with a grain of salt, there are issues, but as you can probably tell from this last patch they have been continuously working on them.
---
If you're on PS4 give me a holler and I'll play with you some.
---
People always say they are easy to make but I have a hell of a time farming tick blood to make blood packs to craft stims. Is there something I don’t know or an easy source of tick blood and/or blood packs?
---
Marsupial is a choice, this heavy landing in PA is not.
---
Here’s what’s bullshit about 3 star legendaries, you can only see one of the three perks since you can’t examine the item as long as it’s in the machine. How am i supposed to know what 2/3 of the stars are for
---
Yes it does, I have done it
---
Yo I’m also looking for the plan, if anyone could help me out too, I’ll return it I just want the mod Psn: kibbles_123g
---
Yes, each new machine gives you an extra 30
---
This is the hard reality 80% of this sub is desperate to deny. The community is like 1/30th of what it was at release, and it didn’t even sell well then.
---
 For months you could not say a good thing about the game without getting downvoted to oblivion - but those people left, this is just the fraction that remains, for whatever reason.
---
This is the stone core of the playerbase, and between sky high prices and constant nerfs to earning atoms they are trying to wring what blood they can.
---
I’m pleased with mine to date, understated by cosy, but I’m certainly making notes :)
---
I would KILL to find someone selling plastic. I’m ALWAYS out of that shit
---
Not according to the planogram. Didn't you get one?
---
But he growled at me and I wasn't sure if he was up to date on his vaccinations
---
It’s about as buggy but with less disconnects. They recently brought an old duplication glitch back for a few days which really fucked the economy. Now everyone has explosive lasers.
---
Depends on what got you to drop the game that far back. If it's bugs and stability, then it's considerably better, though not perfect.
---
If it's due to a lack of deep and interesting quests, it's not THAT much different. Some modest additions.
---
If you weren't into the core gameplay loop back then, it hasn't really changed now.
---
The lookout tower just east of the Pumpkin House spawns wolves fairly often for me.
---
Take a picture of a [not in game] during a [almost never happens] with a camera (that players server hop for hours and cannot get because we hated it behind insane RNG).
---
20 Atoms.
---
How does setting prices in your vending machine feel? And buy/selling from the vendor robots? I've experienced nothing worse in this game than those two atm. My framerate slows down to like 5fps when im at a vendor bot, also similar with the new legendary scrip machines.
---
Oh sweet summer child, never let the world take your innocence away.
---
TL;DR if only your suggestion worked ;)
---
But K goes before P in the alphabet, you’re asking too much bud
---
PS4?
---
Imagination 🖐🌈🤚
---
Look at the comments on the other people who have asked this every damned day
---
It’s true.
---
And yes, holy shit the mandatory “buy shit you money pig” screen is fucking obnoxious.
---
Mines behind a 3,a keypad door, and on the second floor.
---
Every fucking time I come home there's a damn blown up fusion generator.
---
Then I have to store the door to get in to repair it and memorize a whole new code
---
FFS this has got to fucking stop I just came back to the game a week ago and it's happened so many times I have never been one to rage at a game but fucking cunts this is shit fucked annoying.
---
Yeah just server hop moonshiners cabin and Gilman lumber. Use buchers bounty, chemist and super duper. One run is like 20ish stimpacks.
---
My game locks up.  3 times.  Hit the 2, 3rd, or 4th bullesye and it just frezes. 
---
Can't complete it at the scout camp.  Can I do the challenge at wavy or willards?
---
Saw some people selling this, i was wondering where they got it. Is it a random spawn at modus?
---
i completed it, photos worked fine
---
Or. Better yet.
---
Ban all the fucking dupers. They deserve what they fucking get.
---
I sell plastic on xb1 from time to time 2c per scrap.
---
Ok I see I haven’t been utilizing all the cards. I’m going to screenshot this, thanks
---
Anyone else unable to do the shooting range challenge?  My game freezes
---
why was this removed?
---
I try it there, and the game freezes when I hit a bullseye?
---
Yes please. Anything to give me an extra scare is nice.
---
And their prey.
---
Glad I can help!
---
Watoga vendor
---
Did it work?  Mine freezes when I hit the target.  3 times this happened...
---
Someone earlier dumped a bunch in the trashcan at one of the train stations. As a super casual, low level, off-and-on player, I felt like I won the freaking lottery. 
---
There was also a camp selling serums for super cheap. People are being awesome right now.
---
I don’t know, they sent me a message saying I used a URL shortener, whatever that is, and removed my post without warning.
---
Yeah the last one behind the bush is lower than you think you have to hit the bullseye
---
i have had this issue , try hitting the reload (ammo) button even though the camera shows film sometimes it needs to be reloaded to register
---
Yeah man I picked it up for about 100 caps from vendor closest to the service entrance. It's all green though no US Army markings on it unfortunately
---
There is a glitch at least on the ps4 where the subtitles won't work for these. It just says something along the lines of "Radio Show Plays."
---
I am not the best of hearing so if i can't have subtitles, it'd be nice to have them all on repeat so maybe i can pick up the words
---
Sorry I’m on PS4
---
Recently Todd Howard accidentally spilt Monster © on the servers and deleted all our accounts. Other then that not much has changed.
---
"smaller, lighter weapons have less durability, make them have more durability".
---
No, I mean I hit the bullseye and the game locks up.  Eventually I get dumped to desktop (well... home... its an xbox)
---
Had no problems with that one.  Make sure your Prosnap is lined up to where the object your are taking a picture of name is showing on the right side of your screen.
---
It also seems to be a common spawn for the vendor I've seen it multiple times.
---
Still no walls tho
---
Found 3 in the nuka cola plant in containers might be random world loot but hope this helps.
---
Oh weird, I'm on PS4, worked fine for me. Maybe it's a bug with the new update
---
They won’t register as completed unless you see the animals name in the top right written in black and white. Even if the animals name is in bright red in the middle of your screen and the animal is literally taking up the entire frame lol.
---
They are aware and working on it. It is apparently a console limitations.
---
If you're on PC, pip boy light (and text) or can be changed by just tweaking an INI file - it's just stored as 3 values (red, green, blue). I've had mine cranked to white (255,255,255) since day 1.
---
Cross hair color might be in there too, but probably not shape.
---
Haha filthy casuals has a post making fun of how “is it time to come back/should I return” is like the most common post on this subreddit
---
Must not be legendary, must just be that BOS armor has the highest damage resistance. Or...that by crafting and scrapping a bunch of it you can learn the mods and improve your BOS armor you find, buy, or trade.
---
Well you essentially meet the Minutemen when they're basically already dead, Preston being the only one left. The only other one you meet is the old woman who gets you to the armory. You never get to see the rest of the Minutemen and all the apparent infighting and clashes of personality that caused people to lose faith in them, you only get Preston's account of it. The Minutemen basically amounts to an army you lead for the last few story quests, and not an actual faction that interacts significantly with the world.
---
mine worked fine, got the mammologist badge. tip: go to the challenge and track it(y on xbox) then you'll be notified you got the picture for the challenge and not have to go check later and only then find out it didn't work
---
Here's the problem with this question... The game doesn't actually begin until post level 50, and your looking at least level 75 before you actually have a halfway decent build that gives you free reign to do what you want. Whatever generalized reasons you dropped the game shortly after launch are completely moot. You haven't given the time required to understand this game in the first place, so nobody can tell you if "it's worth it" to you. And because you couldn't even be bothered to mention which specific glitches or issues drove you away it wreaks of "I watched some YouTube videos that said it was glitchy therefore it was to glitchy for to play" mindset.
---
Shit, mate, props for that. I half expected fury ;) Good on you.
---
I agree!! So frustrating with tiny or illegible print too.
---
Yeah, but they owed it. Credit where credit is due.
---
same here, hop for bargain &amp; campfire event :))
---
This man queries.
---
Also that would fix the problem with random defense ignoring molerats that destroy shit regardless of how defended it is
---
Appreciate all the feedback!
---
Yeah comunity found out, it is only random drop drom containers. I did 16badges from grinding event anyway....
---
Dropped from scorch queen
---
Anyone on ps4 down to lend me the plan, I’ll return it , I’m not an A hole that’ll take it, just want the high capacity mod
---
This woulda been super useful last week when I did all these.
---
But thanks for doing this!
---
I got that reference /cap
---
brilliant
---
Seemingly random symbol? Looks like a symbol of Atom, to me.
---
Typical enclave. "We had reasons"
---
Yeah that should be fine
---
Reminds me of my fo4 days in the mod that added a military infantry transport truck that had a bedroll and stove and storage boxes. Or the times in skyrim with the tent mod that had portable crafting and fire. All great memories
---
&gt;It is insane to act like you have to have video proof of a bug or it isn't a bug. 
---
Clearly there is a bug. The question is, *what* is the bug. The reason people ask for video proof is to figure out what actually is happening. u/Retartarder (OP) claims that things are selling and he isn't getting the right amount of caps. His video *seems* to indicate someone bought 7k cells and he got 2k caps. However, his video doesn't show how many cells he had before and after. Other people claim the bug is just that the notification of how many are being sold is wrong, and if you check your vendor stock, you will see that you are actually getting the right caps for how many actually sold. OP's video supports this claim just as well as it does his own, therefore it is useless for proving which is actually happening. He said he checked his stock after, but his video doesn't show this. It's a little weird that he would stop recording before checking, unless he edited that out because it didn't actually support his claim. 
---
https://streamable.com/6a1j3
---
My starting caps is 11507. I put 60 radaway on sale for 1 cap each. Customer buys some radaway. Notification says he purchased 23, but I only received 1 cap. Check the vendor, 59 remaining. He actually bought 1. Customer buys some more. This time, notification says he bought 53. I got 27 caps. 29 remaining in vendor, he actually bought 30. Customer buys some more. Notification says he bought 82, got 27 caps. 0 remaining in vendor, he actually bought 29. Ending caps 11562. Net gain of 55 caps, 5 caps lost to vendor tax.
---
So, clearly, the customer didn't buy 23 and then 53 and then 82, as I only put up the 60. What happened is he had 22 in his inventory at the beginning. Every time he bought some, the notification displayed the total number he had in his inventory after buying, rather than the number he bought. In other words, when op claimed he was checking his stock, that was a lie. Op's video didn't show a guy buy 7k ammo for 2k caps, it showed a guy buy *some unknown amount* of ammo for 2k caps resulting in a total of 7k in his inventory.
---
A quest where you help a visually impaired robot fix it's vision sensors and in return it gives you a chip that allows you to modify all text on your pip boy (size colour opacity etc) and a new feature when you pick up notes that you can scan it with your pip boy and convert it to text.
---
Also if you don't want to do the quest it gives you the option to get the chip straight away but for those who want to make it a bit fun and earn some caps on the way to getting the chip they can make a quest out of it 
---
That or it's a permanent bobble head collectible.
---
Servers are infinitely more stable and you don’t get kicked at all anymore. I haven’t been kicked in months and it used to happen like every half hour. everything else is still the same as far as I’m concerned. 
---
There is still terrible hit detection and currently impossible to VATS creatures in the air. Issues with weapons/thirst/hunger meters still there. Camps are still buggy as hell and take longer than ever to load in but good news is they removed all camp/slap damage so you never take damage at all unless you want to. All the griefers have moved onto survival mode which is separate from adventure mode (main game). Atom shop is still overpriced with power armor paints costing 14 dollars, more than the actual game itself can be bought for lol. Also new atoms are much harder to earn now but that won’t be an issue for you since you have all of the easy caps still yet to be earned. But a lot of the challenges are still bugged. Nothing major has been added except backpacks, player vending machines, and survival mode (which is an always PVP server) 
---
Feel like I’m forgetting something but oh well
---
I left FO76 about 6 months ago and just came back now. Why the hell is duping still a thing, and why has it not been patched yet?
---
Just finished mine today, biggest hurdle was milking brahmin
---
Sorry, don’t browse the Reddit, I’ll delete the post
---
Exactly, it depends why he left the game.
---
he does not look comfortable, i think we can all agree on that. it's more a question of 'does my house need an uncomfortable frog in it?', and the answer for me is no, it does not.
---
Awesome, gonna check it out!
---
Went from having a normal lvl 50 hunting rifle and a level 45 war drum as my only weapons to having an instigating dragon that can reach 1k damage and two grognaks; plus a ts crossbow in one day. just hopping around haggling and trading up lol.
---
It is most certainly not impossible to VATS enemies in the air.
---
Source: The unfortunate Scorched Beasts and Blood Bugs that have crossed my path.
---
And to add to this, the fact that at a certain elevation, trees start to merge and slide across the screen. Im not describing it well but you know what I mean
---
Sorry I meant VATS with melee. My bad
---
Enemies and flora stay glowing after a nuke.
---
Its fabulously appalling.
---
Found one at a random event with brahmin and a mr. Handy heardsmen in the cranberry bog and managed to get the plans for a flaming spiled sheepsquatch club
---
Cultist blade is a sword. I think cultist dagger might count
---
Theres no place like C.A.M.P.  
---
   
---
*Fast Travels*
---
They really need to separate the PVP and PVE nerfs.  The game got horrid for PVE with the latest patch.
---
It's like Bethesda want's to make sure the PVP nutters ruin it for everyone else, even now that they're on their own servers.
---
Screw you
---
Just so you know, the pictures save to your console. For PS4 they will stay in your pics folder regardless if you delete them in Fallout 76. So delete away, the only reason you might not want to delete a pic is if you want to use it for a loading screen
---
Damn you. Take my upvote lol
---
i'll help meet me in flatwoods....... mattola69
---
I can help too, if someone is willing to let me revive them in turn. Gotta do it for the weekly challenge.
---
I tend to have some bulk listed.
---
Thanks for the feedback, everyone! I don't know what it was, but all the challenges started being accurately recorded after I turned my PS4 back on and returned to the wonderful world of rabbit photography. At this point, I just need two more photos (a fox and a wolf) and then I'm done with the Mammalogist badge. After that, I'll just need to run the course at Camp Venture for the Athletics badge and I'll finally have the backpack. Woo hoo! Light at the end of the tunnel!
---
What’s born survivor again?
---
Guess you were screwed out of that one too.
---
There aren't living cats at the Cat lady house....
---
pffffff we lunatics and we don’t need no ... BACK. PACKS.
---
Yes, but I had also been on this server for about an hour before I moved my camp and there was no nuke before then. Unless they stay for over an hour after it dissipated.
---
I sell all of mine for less than 50 caps and no one buys them. I've had a vending machine full of plans since vending came out. I saved them all for this and it's super disappointing.
---
Technically there is but they are all dead and mounted.
---
It means someone in your team is sharing a perk, the number is the rank. You can see which perk they're sharing in your perk menu, it'll have a chain-link icon over it.
---
Look at them being snarky. Thought they went there to distance themselves from that.
---
All those posts though are an interesting sign. People really do want to like this game. I would have thought if you were done, you'd be done for good.
---
I was collecting them all, when i had too much, moved them on my mule. Since vending machine went out, I started fulfilling them, 4machines of +-200 plans all the time.
---
Already made over 30k caps from them. Currently 250plans in machines, all fasnacht plans in my inventory waiting for free room in machines and one mule with plans from time when we were farming SBQs, i belive egghead mutation recipe is there too. So yeah, collect them.
---
I wanna say it's like 1.5-2 hours.
---
ive still yet to spend any money on atoms... dang.
---
My idea is that they don't add it.
---
As a rifle build I have a .308 hunting sniper rifle I think? It's modded out and does like 140 is damage a shot, not bad but I want more. Also have a vampire radium rifle which is nice.
---
yes it works. easier to kill them and take pics of their corpses.
---
I feel you. Spent hours "fixing" my camp. Changed my house from an ugly box to a big ugly box with posters on it lol. Most of my budget is spent on crops, purifiers, and turrets.
---
The biggest change to gameplay imo is the server stability. I used to get kicked every 15 mins it seemed like, now it’s been months since I’ve been kicked. 
---
Second biggest is that they removed the ability for you and your camp to take any damage unless you choose to fight back. And they created a PVP mode for all the griefers to go harass each other in so with all these changes you never get fucked with anymore
---
Whoa, that's a while. I sir, am an uninformed pleb
---
I had some low level tryhards shooting my house for a good ten minutes and it did nothing. Except waste their bullets I guess. Not sure what to tell you.
---
I know that NOW....lol
---
Just trying to save people from making the same mistake
---
I'm 50 years young, lost my right eye 3 years ago. My remaining eye needs reeders...lol....my GT is KnucklesNCYclops; Knukles is my German Shepherd loyal bigbear that you ever did see. We live in NC thus the NC in the middle and Cyclops for me...lol. Anywho, I started playing Fallout back when I was using a docking station and a page would take 4-5 seconds to load...back in 98-99, twenty years ago and only one childat that point. Fast forward 20 years and Fallout Series continues to impress with the Fallout series. FO7 is by far my favorite as I went to college there and have driven 75% of their roads. So back to the display, for visually impaired people. I must pull my recliner about six foit away to see the writting. It's a pain in my butt, however, I love the game so much, I quit complaining about the things that make it hard and concentrate on taking a photo with my camera screen and emailing that until I find the quests in question.  Maybe a phot will ge a saving grace that you need. It just takes us longer to get the desired results. Good kuck from North Carolina......Joe a.ka. Cyclops
---
If you don’t have a bending machine that just sells chess boards I’ll be so disappointed
---
When I’m in the event I do all of the chore stuff then go back to the roof because it’s really easy to pick off the bugs with VATS from up there.
---
He’s screwing up
---
I've run out of camp budget :(
---
Yeah i feel like famine and pale rider should honestly of been reversed.
---
Where the creek starts?
---
Solid spot. I never want for tick blood and a quick hike to the “desk fan triangle”.
---
Same here. Maybe there’s a level limit? I’m only 38.
---
He’s being a real screwge
---
Yes but just logged off for the night, hit me up Tomorrow night👍
---
I should have specified. My bad.
---
Of course they do, they come from the pre war world, they didn’t grow up in a depressing area post war where people can get shot any minute and the water burns, they had hope  they knew how things used to be and what they could go back to being.
---
The minute men were just umm trying to not die or get eaten by supermutents lol
---
At my event someone was using a fat man!!! They kept doing thumbs up and I kept doing thumbs down. It was my first time doing the event to. Ruined it.
---
Fo76 bad. Pls upvote
---
I couldn’t read through all the comments but if it wasn’t said already I want to say that while yes the game is playable now. It launched in an absolute clusterfuck train wreck of a state. Full price, broke game. Ridiculous atom shop with and I still think over priced items. Spin it any way you want but that’s the truth and they spared every expense possible. Bad voice acting, unmemorable quests, bad RNG, broken mechanics, the game was literally unplayable. And I mean game breaking bugs unplayable. Also some very basic and obvious features were missing. Not to mention the hackers, the net code failure, people literally selling duped/hacked guns on eBay and still do. It was an absolute embarrassment, from proclaimed  “”AAA”” developers. That’s not how a real AAA should ever launch. They also lied multiple times in their marketing, for example the nylon bag debacle, which they eventually tried to rectify but like I said, spared every expense possible. There is also a rumor that the scum bag big time owner of Bethesda (not Todd Howard) had went off on all his employing saying why don’t we have a destiny/fortnite money milker.

Now look, I play the fuck out of this game with my friends, I’m in the end game, TSE guns lev 100+ but I had to stop playing at some point when it first launched because of how bad it was. A good comparison would be anthem right now. They released an unfinished game and it was simply unacceptable. 
---
Now with all that out of the way I think this game is very enjoyable (now), especially with friends and I hope you think so too. Cheers!
---
Umm.. Did you read it?
---
Well Bethesda is giving you an option, some of the challenges are terrible but others take a minute or two to do.  It's up to you if it is worth it.
---
I think it is stupid you can still get waterborne disease with it equipped, kind of making it half useless.
---
That is some of the challenges, but others are super easy.  Drinks alcohol and be over level 21 for 10 atoms today vs Grahm in a workshop yesterday.  Two opposite ends of the spectrum.
---
Umm yeah I was sure I did? Do you know why it isn’t showing up orrrr
---
Naa im just tryna piss u off
---
I did not know this! I have so many great pics from the first few weeks of 76, when everything was fresh and exciting still....
---
The Reconstituted US Army’s 5th Division is selling all known plans for zero caps, along with purified water and canned dog food.
---
Gen. Dawson
---
If you talk to the bot on the front desk they tell you.
---
This is what catches a lot of people up
---
LOL!
---
Same.
---
Everyone’s giving you a hard time, but really this was a really cool project, even without something amazing at the end, the teamwork and planning and control shows you can get shit done. 
---
Make up your own story. Let this be the day your squad sealed the fissures. And when the next step of the game comes, your make more stories.
---
Lol never showed up for me...i just didn't give a shit cause most stuff is broken
---
I didn’t send you to the country club, I gave you a direct map link to the train station east of it.
---
Unfortunately not on Xbox. Gotta open the pic then take a screenshot with Xbox to save it.
---
Can I interest you in a sweet instigating Dragon? Catch anything off guard with it and blows a Texas sized hole in them lol.
---
you make it sound like this is somehow a better way of telling a story (hint: it's not)
---
Yeah something should be stickied regarding this stuff. I’ve seen like 10 people already ask this
---
See that’d be awesome to have when I do the event like 20 times a day but I get 80% of the time THAT GUY who sits up on the roof &amp; just watches. He’ll only sit there &amp; emote back when you shake your head at him. That guy gets me mad :-/
---
Interesting
---
Billboard to the north of whitespring up above the road has several cats.
---
It's difficult to understand what exactly your asking, but Bloodied Meathooks are endgame weapons if that's what your asking. Especially if it has Swing Speed and/or Strength on it.
---
ok?
---
Sometimes when I'm playing, I'll look up old radio mysteries and have them playing on my phone
---
So you're saying it's normal for a Silver ore extractor to give scrap instead of ore? And that Silver ore only comes from an event, not the ground, like other ores? Okay.
---
You should probably spend your time learning basic reading and writing instead.
---
No, your idea is just bad. And to sell it for atoms, the fuck?
---
Block and report me, weirdo.
---
About the scrip prices (although clearly, subject to change): [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/ijNW4w42LXVzZqeLewCxJ/ef2c5768a41862b7c1b6599acc4ad04c/FO76\_PurveyorMenu\_1920x1080.jpg](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/ijNW4w42LXVzZqeLewCxJ/ef2c5768a41862b7c1b6599acc4ad04c/FO76_PurveyorMenu_1920x1080.jpg)
---
To clarify, I remembered that there was a soda vendor at whitesprings. I just thought it was on some edge of the building instead of a little side room. I also got sort of lost in the big dining room
---
You have to be really close. It's easy to do if you do the event near the airport with the cargo bot. It has to be almost landing on you to register.
---
Not if you read it, I don't. (Sorry, you could be a new player, for all I know) 
---
My only other guess is that it could be one of the many bugs introduced in the last patch.
---
Seconded
---
Exactly. I sell my ammo in bulk to someone who takes orders. I don’t have the patience for that.
---
I think their problem is they might be a little too basic...
---
A couple of them are prioritized, as they either display in the message instead of the prefix or they change the name of the item (like poisoner's). Either way, it is a bug that should have been fixed already, I get their system of pushing out updates consistently every few weeks but this is a pretty big issue with their latest feature that could be fixed with a very quick hotfix
---
i think you need to craft combat armor and then mod it as BOS
---
Check watoga shopping center and watoga Station
---
Usually only one will spawn, but there is a chance of two. Might be affected by number of players, but have seen two soloing and one with half dozen players.
---
sorry....NOT SORRY
---
I got mine at watoga shopping
---
The only NPCs not voiced in this game are the insects
---
nice of you to have joined us,
---
yes I do enjoy the game as well, it still has it bugs and stuff but it is a lot off fun to play. 
---
what system are you playing on?
---
Railway rifles are really strong since the last patch. Rifle perks work with them now. As no-one was bothering to dupe them before, it's a seller's market.
---
im on
---
Well explained. Upvote
---
She'll be here Thursday.
---
Boo.
---
Central US will not let me log in. "Vault Tec Engineers" message.
---
Go check Berkely :)
---
OMG I have wanted that weapon but never out in the hours for the farms
---
That's some next level edge there
---
I have a great suggestion for your next act of deviance, go up to your principal and tell him school is stupid and you're dropping out
---
As mentioned, I had it hovering about 10 feet in front of me, maybe less.
---
?? try and join me.  n1ckybeth82.  I dont know no Berkeley.
---
yup, that's what I did. I spent a lot of time chasing them through my lens before I realized dead bodies count too.
---
As mentioned, try the airport one. It lands on you :)
---
Hello i play fo76 since beta, i earned over 13k atoms over time by playing. Did I made $130.00 USD ??
---
Did you play the previous games?
---
That's pretty good damage,  but I've seen them get up to 2-3000 dps. Just play around with your perk cards a bit.  I bet you'll get it a little higher :)
---
Found it!

Level 0 inside the prison, you get to it through the solitary wing. You can also get to solitary from a level 3 terminal if you start in the main building.
---
Anti armor
---
Which makes plants taking damage completely pointless and unnecessary.
---
Every single one of them, and this game is very clearly not one of them
---
630hours here. Got over 13k atoms from challenges. L2P.
---
try it with film
---
Not energy weapons
---
Distance. Also if the mob is aggro'd you don't get sneak attack bonuses, even if they don't see you.
---
Do you play on xbox?
---
I just want to know how much damage everyone else is doing with it
---
My plans are actually below the value it says, still though no one buys
---
I think the easiest way to get this is do collision course event at Morgantown airport. The cargobot that appears in that will hover for a short time while it drops its cargo off, giving you good opportunity to take the picture.
---
Ps4
---
My point is they could make more constructive story lines than just picking up holo tapes and reading terminals all over the map.
---
I suppose you disagree.
---
*Insert sensible chuckle meme that I don’t have saved*
---
Have to be inside it basically
---
Call in an airdrop from a relay tower and watch for the bot landing
---
That's one way to make a gold farmers job easier.
---
Plasma rifles are really strong, laser is decent and lasts a while if you take off the splitter, gatling laser and plasma are really good and have decent durability, tesla was good from the start
---
Welcome! I think &amp; hope you will enjoy it.
---
its like 4000 or some shit at WS so your good..... but i have seen it for 250 or less and seen it more
---
Why if your a bloodied build do you do so little? My bloodied melee 3 Taps them and my legacy gat plasma heavy gunner build melts them in less then 4 seconds once I’m spun up
---
Why should we scrap it and craft a new one?
---
There were custom Radios for FO4 so I mean I don't think it's impossible to just take the holotape audio files and make one for FO76. I'm bored as hell and making a fake station would be cool but I don't have the knowhow.
---
Rip
---
Ok Tesla is over powered but this game is based off of defense not health and with out anti armor all energy guns suck and the only reason plasma is kind of good is half of the damage is ballistic and they also keep buffing it with out addressing the issue and the heavy weapons have never killed me in pvp and I pvp a lot
---
Super Muties also often have some armor that adds damage resistance in my experience.
---
I was in hidden status the whole time as he was shooting at my house...
---
No, they can't. This is a MMO. Nobody is going to be sitting around for half an hour talking to NPCs like in old world blues. They should have done a better job advertising what this game is, because even this many months after launch people still don't get it. Many of the things people keep asking for like this post are incompatible with the game. Stop trying to make it like the others, fallout 5 is coming eventually with all its single player glory
---
Also don't know why we are ignoring all of the voiced NPCs. For what's there, the characters like rose, biv, the grafton mayor, etc have some very detailed personalities. The only way they differ from other npcs like the king or amata is they are forced to offer mmo quests instead of world-changing choices
---
Dude, I've been noticing this all week. If some low level wolf, scorched, or super mutant can take a shell to the face from my level 50 TSE Hardened Pump and still keep coming at me, there's definitely a problem.
---
Must have just been distance, but I wasn't aware it was that severe. I was only about 125m from him.
---
I bought it from some vending machine at 1200caps, then saw it at modus where all X-01 plans are and oh my god, it is 350caps? or something like that, i am dumb.
---
Distance again, plus he was aggro'd against your camp, so you didn't get your sneak bonus.
---
I used to melt scorchbeasts so easily with my BE handmade, now it takes so many more shots. I suspect something has been changed.
---
It said 2.5x sneak attack when I fired both shots though... so...
---
Yes because if you are finishing a quest the npc will be like "thanks for repairing our water tank" or something then another player walks in and the NPC turns around and "Someone help, our water tank has been damaged for some time , we will run out of water soon"
---
Thanks a bunch really appreciate it. Which type would you recommend?
---
this looks really dope actually
---
Isn't pvp supposedly filled with be lasers right now? I don't pvp in this game but I keep seeing complaints about it
---
I actually took a video today of me shooting a sheepsquatch, doing basically no damage, scooting a tiny bit forward, and killing him like a quarter of the way per shot.
---
My main issue with the game is that I’ll be playing as a lvl 20 character , then all the sudden I start getting attacked by lvl 50 enemies because a lvl 120 player was near by . I wish they would populate the Maps with other players of similar lvl.
---
They don't want to do paid DLCs because they don't want to split the player-base. They've already confirmed more story DLC is on the way, including a "new main quest with choices and consequences". So I don't see what the problem is.
---
a r t
---
It's just a matter of preference I think. I use shadowed cause I play sneak sniper
---
"You are our only hope, please save us from the threat before it wipes us all out!"
---
then while you're walking out two other people hand in the quest
---
yeah, idk what people are expecting from a MMO
---
My habit is to look for servers where shoppers can easily hop from other shops to mine without paying a ton of caps. I know when I shop, I like to hit a bunch of vendors nearby each other.
---
That's what I did on both characters.
---
Lmao out of all the fucked up things in the Fallout Universe some folks are upset because of Prince the Captive frog...understandable. Jar isn’t small enough. Haha
---
That would be neat.
---
Is there a way to see what types do what?
---
Yeah that's what I've been checking, the animals name comes up in the top right of the screen in the camera.
---
I sold all mine for 100 caps. I’m thinking about changing the price to normal price because I don’t want people buying them to resell them, I would give these things away to people who need them.
---
Probably after the arktos pharma dungeon thing. I think that’s that’s the only thing beside the legendary vendor, since she’s coming this week the dungeon might be next week or the week after.
---
You know, a picture is better than words?
---
Well then I don’t know, but I can tell you I’ve personally finished that badge
---
Yes and that caught me out the first time. It would be awesome if a horde of them came after us
---
I just took a pic of the one that comes at the end of the event at Morgantown airport - worked perfectly, and you can get nice a close to it
---
Here’s my problem PICK A WEAPON TO SPECIALISE IN smh the Amount of people who can’t make builds and then wonder why you destroy them in pvp is stunning if you want help I got you
---
&gt;gulper lagoon
---
LOL that's nuts. You have to kill gulpers to get deathclaw hides. Not deathclaws.
---
The lv 1 accessibility does make it valuable on market
---
Archaeologist: Wow, look at this perfectly preserved specimen. 
---
Every one else at grandmas funeral: 😧
---
MAKE WALLS MANUALLY REVERSIBLE MWMR MWMR
---
That's what Ive been doing. Even the animals name shows in the top right corner but it doesn't mark as completed lol. It worked for taking a picture of a Brahmin.
---
Bro It’s been taking 2 shots with a TSE Handmade/gauss for me on weak level enemies and I have a 60%+ rifle dmg perks. It just makes no sense. Are some guns better then others? Are some weapon classes inherently better? The answer, probably. Certain weapons just have a better quality to them. The gauss rifle sucks something fierce right now compared to other guns, it’s really disappointing.
---
pioneer scout flag too
---
125m is a lot. Remember that two shot shoots two projectiles that deal a combined damage of 125%. At that range it most likely split far enough that only one bullet hit, dealing 62.5% damage (+receiver mod). That 62.5% damage probably also took a hit from range dropoff, which makes a big difference
---
Can multiple mods be placed on the bag?
---
That's good to know. I guess it's either operator error or I need to get help from Bethesda.
---
And at the end of the day, they own the content, so there is no licensing required
---
They sort of have that now with the banners you can learn from the machines
---
Not on the recipes book. Only when crafting them or by examining pieces you own/find
---
Yes please
---
yeaaaaaa but flags tho
---
lol
---
Nice
---
I dig the pale rider. It’s understated and not the overly done skull/flames you see on everything. I see skulls and I’m like cool, I must ride a Harley now and wear leather and eyeliner. 
---
Given the lore in fallout the atom on the torso works very well. The bombs dropped and lead to the four horsemen. 
---
Plague (referred to a Conquest or the white rider in Revelations) the planet is irradiated. Plants die radiation only makes the bad stuff huge. Water kills you. Plants kill you. Everything but Brahmin tries to kill you. 
---
War - people lose it trying to survive and engage in killing one another. ie Raiders, Watoga skynet and annoying daylight bats. 
---
Famine - Bethesda makes everyone good spoil too quick. You’re left wit prewar dog food and sodas to survive. But thank goodness alcohol will last!
---
Death - the old world is dead and in its wake is the hell created. It’s quiet(except for SBs) slow and unavoidable.
---
Thanks alot everyone i finally have the backpack
---
Remember, there's more junk in the sea~
---
No, do not have paid dlcs, that time has passed, the game launched horribly, it should have been free to play when it launched. Maybe then that woulda sailed but now? No fucking way. They put the rest of their stock in the atom shop and it better stay that way. All that shit is already over priced. I’d rather not pay for anything else they are going to screw up on expectation. Hence the burrows
---
Yeah all my wood disappeared one day
---
Well let’s not forget everything that was copy and pasted from fallout 4
---
Was it western or modern?
---
I'm not sure if I should apologize, or change it or do both.   
---
Lol but either way, I hope this guide has given you a bit of a hand.
---
Western
---
have made one more [https://imgur.com/a/E74qmWg](https://imgur.com/a/E74qmWg)
---
Use the spacebar to select/consume in the pipboy instead of mouse clicks.
---
Had the same freezes when selecting w/ the mouse and this has worked for me so far...
---
Sold a TSE 10mm for 3k today. Reading these comments makes me think I should’ve sold it for more
---
Appreciate it mate
---
You're welcome. I hope this helped. :)
---
and may Atom bless you as well, friend.
---
That means that they are extremely rare and also a potential exploit
---
That's normal for shotguns. For the explosive ones, the explosive part may not have suffered the falloff, but that was nerfed hard in the last patch.
---
Did it over 50times. I tryed to afk, because i wanted to get badges, but also i had chores to do in real life. I ended up doing it solo every time, because people around only fucked it up for me. Also i did 13badges in two day, and you need 8for backpack mod, so um, just to it and never go back.
---
Pipe rifles benefit from Rifleman or Commando depending on the receiver.
---
Ah. Sorry, I only thought of this over the weekend, and did a bit of research seeing if anyone had posted this, and it took a bit of time. As I manually check the locations to ensure that the information is 100% legit, as I don't want to waste anyone's time on an already partially tedious challenge.
---
Perhaps it is just the cynic in me that believes Bethesda will offer the least beneficial rewards.
---
Ah awesome as, I'll go check those out and add them to the list. Much appreciated friend for the information.
---
I get 1 hit when i try to google abraxo painting for F76. There is a guy who claims he found one [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wc6a8/have\_you\_found\_power\_armor\_flame\_paint\_job/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wc6a8/have_you_found_power_armor_flame_paint_job/)
---
And may Atom Bless you in his holy light, friend.
---
*kicks extractor under carpet*
---
Damn I don’t know why but I just got super sad for you. Wow, what are these emotions.
---
You're more than welcome, may lady-like luck smile upon you tonight friend.
---
When i read my notification my first thought was "When did i post in a starwars thread"
---
Ok, So now this is starting to make a bit of sense. Thanks.
---
God dammit I thought I was clever/funny selling this for 69 caps but clearly I'm not very original.
---
I think I will set it to 700ish I guess.
---
Maybe 660, so I get 600 after Bethestax.
---
Also pistol perks if you put the right handle on it
---
My friend did the same but with a load of water purifiers instead
---
Indubitably. I legitimately felt uncomfortable placing him in my camp. A habitat this is not.
---
Ok , i remember i read sometime they benefit from pistol perks also? Prob been fixed in thay case
---
Me too as we’ll, me down here
---
If there weren't dupers who duped recipes, you will be glad for 2k price. I did kill SBQ so many times, she is more excinted than white rhino, but  got only 4 mutation recipes. Anything under 500caps is damn good price!
---
I have my nuka colas ready
---
Do you have a link to a pic?
---
I've seen a camp with about 1000 cardboard vault boys. Utterly useless but still hilarious
---
I love hopping around looking for armor plans. I'm the resident crafter in my group and try to keep everyone as armored up as possible, including random dwellers I run across that need it. Right now I'm stuck with light armor which isn't *bad*, but more options are better. Being able to look for deals at my level is awesome. Haven't gotten any armor plans yet, but I have gotten new recipes and a few chem formulas. Also a cheap fusion reactor plan, which is nice.
---
Trying out that be pipe ? I kinda like it tbh
---
Teddy bears will be a definite thing in my camp
---
Yeah 😁
---
Unfortunately no, not even the wiki does. It is confirmed to be in the game however and is said to be a Charleston F.D.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6HdBplLmuU this doesn't seem exaggerated, given its all his own footage has enough to clear 3 hours of bugs.
---
Glad to hear all that has been smoothed out though.
---
Ah go to Grafton station as well, dude has BOS mods
---
Don't u dare, Bethesda!
---
Ah awesome as, I'll go check them out, and add them to the list. Thank-you for the input, much appreciated friend.
---
No, because all of my walls are concrete and foundations are always at the edges
---
Bolt Action pipe guns can benefit from both, not pipe rifles.
---
I, dropped the screw, in the tuna!
---
What the other guy said tho I think it has to do with the stock I’ll check tho I heard same thing seen someone doing 1 k with it lol
---
A lot of people are downvoting useful QOL changes and it baffles me. Do they not agree with the change or do they not want the change?
---
What? you need screws? why i am selling them to vendor bots to free stash space?
---
00 is good, but putting a - is better as its smaller
---
Sell it. Furious is probably the worst mod for a dragon. It only counts for the actual weapon you're attacking with and the dragon is so slow that it will never proc. Not to mention you're probably not going to need 5+ consecutive hits on something with a dragon.
---
I hate you, but I also have very much respect
---
much appreciated friend, will scout around Harper's and see what I can find, didn't even think of the general's Steakhouse, cheers for that one as well. Will go have a look.  
---
Thanks for the input, I appreciate that friend. :)
---
I end up selling all my plans for 50 caps no matter how high the actual cost is. I hate when I'm actually looking for something and someone's selling it for 2000 or more caps.
---
Yeah I figured. I've 2 more dragons that i dont even use because of the reload speed. If there was a way to clip the animation by swapping weapons I'd probably use them but otherwise they for sale currently
---
Great idea. Only downside is it's in the whitesprings nukezone.
---
What time?
---
yeah I do get why ppl used to look doors I did the same where my decon shower was but now it is pointless to have anything locked, specially when the camp spawn points are all messed up the way they are.
---
Same by jumping again
---
Nah. It works for this week’s legendary too haha
---
Damm , it feels nice . Small mag though
---
What bug? You were just unable to complete the event from what I just read. Just because you struggled with it does not mean broken.
---
Even with drum mag ?
---
Oh man now I have to rewatch that episode
---
Thanks a lot internet
---
How do you get it?
---
I lost Speed Demon twice in two days doing the challenges for the backpack. Never again... I've moved two Strength to Luck so I can leave Starched-Genes on permanently.
---
Thanks dude, I feel sad too, also cause my stash is full. I just ended up dropping a lot of the common ones at the overseers camp.
---
If you would sell it bulked, then it would cost more than 1caps = this wont happen and you will get your 90% of price.
---
Easy now. I went to the station. From the direction I went, I just so happened to cross the back of WS. None of the vendors have them today so I just need to wait.
---
The thing is... was: journalists (lol) not having time to play the game properly and youtubers playing the memes and grabbing their paychecks.
---
I swear to god, if I was a game developer I would dmca the crap of each and every one of them pathetic fucks. Don't trust youtube anymore, if you're having doubts about a game, watch twitch. That's how I came to realize the game is actually good after watching some of my favorite streamers playing it. They were having fun, I was having fun watching so... yeah the game must be fun.
---
The game is not great, but it is definitely good and... FUN!
---
Some people seem to get a Lvl 20 one as reward but mine was Lvl 50.
---
18 rounds with drum
---
Oh it definitely earned about 60% of the hate it received when it launched, but I still play.
---
athlete, rarcher, and codebraker are working.
---
all easy to do codebrake you have to lunch a nuke is the hardest part if you can say that it is hard. but I do agree it sucks they way it has played out.
---
Yup. Science goggles.
---
I was able to pick up the Fixer plan for 100 caps. I like to think it was a filthy looking out for me.
---
I think it would be cool to see other people's photos on my load screens, maybe players on the same server at the time.
---
Sleeping.
---
Intelectual property is kind of limited nowadays. If paparazzi can sue actors for using photos they took of said actors, we can claim screenshots of games.
---
Unless they changed it with the newer patches, you will have to buy them in order of light, sturdy, and then heavy.
---
Lazy YouTubers and salty dupers
---
Na not anymore they fixed it
---
What badges do you get by doing the event? Because I’ve done it close to 50 and I don’t have one possum badge done hahaha
---
Second paragraph. Didnt have my unyielding bonuses. And cant remember if nerd rage kicked in or I had forgot to swap back to my armor repair perk. Since I cant help with your reading, just imagine a thumbs up emote.
---
I sell my plans for half price and most ammo-types I find for 0 caps.. How am I supposed to ask money for a single 5mm bullet?
---
Heavy has the best dps, sturdy looks the coolest lol
---
It used to fix the half damaged items if you stored them and put them back up again, not sure if it still works though.
---
I think I have an instigating dragon which is pretty much the only one i'd consider using. It's a cool design but use it only to oneshot things. I think it has PvP purposes if you can one or twoshot people with it (carry two to 2shot).
---
I'm still waiting for this suggestion to be made a top priority.  A workshop that generates caps could be fun to fight over.
---
Fair enough 😂
---
Amazing sir take my upvote
---
Oh no ohhh no
---
Saw two vendor camps next to each other, with similar account names. One was selling three furious/explosive lever action and the other had four furious/exp lever action and they both wanted 9999 caps for each gun. Duping alarm went off.
---
Not just weapons. Look at FO76 Bazaar and the Old Man Winter Mask is a common sale item on consoles.
---
Quote from a recent Old Man Winter Mask thread:
---
&gt; facebook groups are dropping them by the thousands daily   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; vendor had like 20 of em. Bought one for 19 caps lol 
---
Still think the event never dropped Old Man Winter Masks and the only ones "found" were from the developer room which then got duped, apparently by thousands on consoles at least. They should do a maintenance and wipe them all.
---
I sell mine for half or less than the suggested price. If it tells me 350, I sell for 175.
---
I think he meant 210 plans not caps.
---
All the Slugger cards, Martial Artist is great, incisor is awesome when 3 star. Action Boy Girl and Gun Fu is dope when you have multiple enemies once you are stronger! Find armor(power or not) mods and atributes that help your strength! Always cook those Glowing Meat Steaks for melee damage!
---
Has it changed now or do laser mods still not carry over
---
Strength obviously needs to be 15, intelligence at 10 maybe as you need to add mods to the sledgehammer. Endurance increases your health so you can get up close... and agility so you can run quickly to the enemy
---
Since some people want it light and some want it dark - crazy idea - maybe lighting could be a per player option in the settings. 
---
Honestly I think the biggest problem is that the sky is so bright.  It looks like a cloudy afternoon when it is supposed to be midnight. Just darkening the night sky texture would be a great improvement.
---
I used a mod with FO4 that made the nights very dark and a headlamp mod that projected the beam more naturally, and it made nights a totally different experience; so I hope this idea gets some upvotes.
---
I’m not sure I understand the question. The backpack adds up to an additional 120 pounds to what you can already carry
---
help
---
Yea some weapons and armors can only be built above or below a certain level
---
its shagadelic baby
---
good to know.
---
Yes, I have completed this.
---
Which ones specifically are you stuck on? (As in which are still outstanding?)
---
I somewhat found a fix... not the best one tho. "bEnableEnlighten=1" in "Fallout.ini" need to be changed to "bEnableEnlighten=0". It does fix the fix but adds 3 more bugs instead - broken reflections on metal and some water issues on low distance. I think I will contact support about this finding.
---
I did bulk only lead and steel to sell it at camp (nobody fucking want to buy it 25caps each, that's less than 1caps per one junk). Are you telling me,that i should rather try it with screws and springs?
---
You read the plan to build the weapon. Then you need to scrap those weapons for a chance to learn the mods for that gun
---
Pockets.
---
if you are on PC I can beat anything the vendor bot gives you for them.
---
My man, if you're on PC, I will find you. And I will buy your junk
---
you drag around a paper bag with all your extra weight
---
No you are not the only one, by far. This is the number one posted issue of this sub currently. Before you snap a picture, you need to make sure that the animals name is displayed in the top right corner of the screen or it will not register. Even if the animals name is displayed in bright red in the center of your screen and it is both attacking you and filling up the whole frame it will not count unless it’s displayed in the top right as well
---
Fox, radstag, opossum, cat, and yao guai. I've taken so many pictures of them, but nothing. The names will be in the upper right corner when I take the photo but it doesn't register.
---
I found that, it's about "bEnableEnlighten" line in "Fallout76.ini". If you change it for "0" the bug disappears... both with metal reflections and water, lol.
---
Crafting and modding are separate.  To get mods, you have to scrap found or made weapons, it's RNG (chance) on if or what mods are learned. More you scrap the more you learn. Some (few) mods can be learned through plans.
---
Pockets
---
Well, it doesn't.
---
Exactly so it only carries 120 carry weight. Yet we can carry around 300-400 weights worth of items. Where does the other 180ish go?
---
Lol I was excited and forgot about my 3 unyielding pieces. Its instinctual to armor up before an unpredictable fight and it was just the wrong move. And insult to injury, couldnt use my 505 power fist in power armor so had to pull out something else. Dissappointed with the loot but that's what the Free Range is for I guess!
---
Black bird &gt; Plague skin &gt; any PA skin &gt; any PA paintjob
---
/Forrest Gump Voice: In the buttocks...
---
In other words, a douchebag database.
---
PS4. Hope there is your copy on my system. It is taking too much stash space :D
---
The BOS graveyard on the road south of Huntersville always has wolves.
---
I still don’t get what you’re asking. It doesn’t replace what you can carry, it adds to it. Say you can carry 200 pounds before you ever get the backpack, once you get it and put it on,  you can now carry 320 pounds
---
So many of the events are just variations of the same thing, that once you've done a few, you've done pretty much everything.  I would really like to see ideas to make events interesting and varied.
---
Yeah man I feel you, I literally made a post about this last week in prep because I was confused that death wasn’t the badass black armor set I was expecting, it was famine. As it turned out the PA armor sets were leaked so I saw the pale rider set b4 it got there. Disgusting. And to be honest, if we equate atoms to dollars they are selling this shit at 14 dollars. Fucking ripoff
---
Yeah but where do you carry that initial 200?
---
The same place you’ve always Carried it before the backpack, your body
---
Sometimes it works. I guess they're /trying/ to have it be helpful and not annoying.
---
 [Possum badges, check this. It have 25% chance to give you one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Knfe8TGlzps&amp;t=51s) Maybe you need to finish first quest and have backpack, i am not sure about that.
---
It's a game, don't take it seriously
---
Yes!!!
---
And some mods can only be learned by scrapping that mod that you find in the wild. Like the bayonet for black powder rifles.
---
The main question is if you want to do power armour build or regular armour with back pack, for pa 2 handed build is good, for regular armour fist weapons are superior. Basically there are two different paths based on that choice.
---
It will still tag, but doesn't really expand the distance it 'sees' somehow.
---
You still have to get close enough to be a dentist at times.
---
Yes!! That’d be so cool!!
---
Up your arse, like in GTA. Need a sniper to hit someone in sneak mode from afar? Pull it out ya arse. Need a .50 caliber machine gun to mow down a horde of enemies? Pull it out ya arse. Need a flamer and several thousand fuel to use over a few minutes? Pull it out ya arse.
---
I understand it to be that the sheep squatch and scout stuff is all persistent. If I’m wrong, please tell me so that I can bust through it.
---
in our thighs, like normal people.
---
weird, I never had an issue. I am on PC, what are you playing on? and have you rebooted?
---
Also, I found that to make sure things were ticking off correctly, I tagged all the pioneer scout challenges for tracking, which would pop up in bottom left when I succeeded. 
---
Though, at times, I did have to retake photos that 'should' have worked. Which is why I set them for tracking.
---
i play the game in german. i didnt need to use a fedora at all. neither i need to collect bones but need to craft "pemmican". i cant even craft it and have no idea where to get the recipe
---
&gt;Has anyone been able to complete the mammalogist challenge?
---
Ah, I only just found another person who posted about this! Sorry, I'm VERY new and still getting the hang of things. But yeah, I've taken multiple photos with the name of the animal displayed in black and white in the top corner... Still won't register unfortunately. I've tried sneaking up to animals to take a photo, taking a photo while it's attacking, or when it's dead. I'm at a loss.
---
I would much rather see a (free) main menu stash than mule accounts. I think that would be a great idea.
---
name needs to  
---
be shown before taking shot.  also, dead things count (duh).
---
This might be a new glitch that JUST started because originally the solution of making sure it’s displayed in top right was all it took to make it count. For me that was the tip that helped me make the photos register and get the mammologist challenge. Wonder how it could’ve changed without an additional patch.
---
What about a robot of some kind, preferably either an eyebot or a mr handy, which similarly to the dog you build a recharge pad, but instead of food it takes mr handy fuel, oil, fusion or plasma cores, customizable weapons, armor, paint, voice module and select from a variety of personalities, they could carry junk items for you, maybe it could act as your vendor, if at your camp it could be given the command to repair your camp while your not there or assign it to repair specific items, perhaps it can act as a mobile repair station for everything but it cost more than usual to repair to balance, then you could customize its name, and maybe you could put stimpaks in its inventory and have it revive you when you down, if anyone could think of anything else or a way to balance i would like ti hear it.
---
I found some at 200 the other day on Xbox.
---
Yup! Strangely enough, despite showing the name, it still won't register for me!  I've tried sneaking up to animals to take a photo, taking a photo while it's attacking, or when it's dead. Still won't work, but I'll keep trying! It's just a pain with the camera film.
---
I seen a thread earlier that said you can get it, if you take a picture of a deathclaw at a fissure site I'm not sure if it works.
---
Hm. I’ll try that. Thanks.
---
1 this morning 1 last night. both at whitespring. (im guessing for serum parts/legendary items for purveyor)
---
Outside of that, not really.
---
well ..hm. you ARE hitting the left trigger to focus, then right to take picture correct?  just making sure.
---
otherwise, have no idea...
---
at pc at whitesprings station? I saw them yesterday too.
---
It's at the train station vendor, every time. It's the only vendor there.
---
Read the plan to learn how to craft it. Then you can craft the gun itself but no mods. To craft mods onto the gun you must first either get one time use mods from vendors (the ones in the light wooden boxes) or you must learn the mod permanently by scrapping that gun. Each time you scrap a pump shotgun (for example) you have a chance of permanently learning a mod for it, though not every time. In Addition you will meet certain perk cards to be able to craft specific higher level mods even if you already learned them
---
Haha yeah I realized after playing some more there is a main story. Haven't even started tackling it though. Normally in Fallout games I play about a hundred hours before touching the main story.
---
I've honestly been having this problem since the camera came out, which is so strange. I know taking photos at the Waterpark was also super annoying, because (and I kid you not) it took me taking a photo of the gator like five times at various angles and distances for it to finally register! I'll just have to keep trying, I guess!
---
u/PeterM1970 its a mod, you apply it to combat armor.
---
Nope, getting it teaches you the mod, not reading it. Which leaves you with the mod plan to share. new people to get it will learn it on pickup allowing them to pass on the plans again.
---
Almost like real plans in real life. many people can read and use.
---
That must have been an awful experience :(
---
This is exactly my view here. I've encountered some annoying bugs sure like my Pipboy being off but stuck on open and some enemies spazzing out but the game is still super enjoyable.
---
Persistent? As in continues after WILD APPALACHIA is over? Yes. Pioneer scouts, sheepsquatch, brewing and all of the none time based events are going to be available after Wild App.
---
The reason i ask i because im excited about the nuclear winter.
---
 Taking knowledge of what is given about it, We get mmo like raids, a new mode (like survival but different), 5 star legendaries. And many other things. 
---
And thats just the face value. I wonder what else is brewing in bethesda's brain. Even little things like the camera are nice and welcomed additions. Cant wait to see more stuff.
---
They put the wrong person in charge then haha I'm already picking fights with robots and obsessively stealing fans and typewriters.
---
It definitely is a strange thing that they never thought of it. Lol
---
I will admit at the time of writing I only put an hour in so far. Now I've discovered there is one.
---
* Claim a Workshop while on a Team
---
* Complete a Quest while on a Team
---
* Kill a Scorchbeast while on a Team
---
* Revive a Player while on a Team
---
For those perks I guess you need lots... wanna come pour me a couple hundred water 😂
---
Wasn't it already said that that was a just a display issue and that you're actually getting the appropriate caps for them?
---
I wish I knew this for my Fallout 3 playthrough.
---
Figured it out, with pistol grip it benefits from rifle/commando + pistol perks
---
Yeah last week I got the reward while in adventure mode and it confused me.
---
You don’t necessarily need to use it mid game. Maybe you just want to organize your inventory but don’t want to use the controller to do so as a touchscreen is quicker and more efficient. That’s what I used the app for in FO4, felt great and immersive.
---
Np hope it works for you...
---
you can change it on PC (not console). in Fallout76Prefs.ini there's three values under \[Pipboy\]:
---
&gt;fPipboyEffectColorB=0.5000  
---
&gt;fPipboyEffectColorG=1.0000  
---
&gt;fPipboyEffectColorR=0.1000
---
experiment with these values to find a color you like. it's the RGB scale (red green blue - setting red to 1, blue and green to 0 will change it to red).
---
This is how I feel and I’m hoping we hear something at E3
---
I agree totally. I didn’t mean to come across as an ass, I’m tired and work bullshit. I was half worried that those quests wouldn’t be available.
---
Id even throw in silver shroud and capt cosmos etc. stories
---
Try in the tinker benches
---
So PC is unlimited?  I know where they save to on my drive, but don't know if there's a limit.
---
Oh you're on PC??? Then I have no idea. The pic limit was I thought exclusive to consoles.
---
Sheepsquatch club ftw eh?
---
I'm on Xbox. And I have been tracking the challenges I am currently trying to do. I'll do a hard reboot on my console later, hopefully it will work.
---
I didnt percieve you as an ass at all but work sucks sometimes i get. And yeah locking off the quests would be ridiculous as they are key components and would give veteran players a giant advantage.
---
Why are fist weapons best? They do more damage?
---
Craft the standard backpack at the armor bench.
---
Then switch to modify and you can turn it into a pioneer scout backpack.
---
That was the fossils I took a photo of to and I used the 105mm lens.
---
I'll log on later today to see if it works this time, the game can be wonky at times.
---
All it has is everything but a backpack in there.
---
I remember finding a Vim! Paint plan during the beta at one of the robot vendors and I want to say it was selling for around 800 caps or so. I couldn't buy it because I didn't have enough money obviously during the closed beta times, nor did I have any power armor to put it on. Proof it exists in the game files:  [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_T-51b\_Vim!\_Paint](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_T-51b_Vim!_Paint) 
---
Another reddit user reported that a friend gave them this same plan in game but that it didn't actually work and you couldn't learn it.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aamxuc/help\_with\_a\_plan\_t51b\_vim/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aamxuc/help_with_a_plan_t51b_vim/)  There are a few other plans like this in the game that say they are a plan but don't actually work yet. Hopefully this means they will come eventually though!
---
Got two yesterday on Xbox, one on Whitesprings and the other up North west of Grafton for some reason, two different servers.
---
I have never found one. I do have a red fireman hat that likely goes with that outfit. The outfit you are looking for seems rarer than the Responder fireman outfit that typically goes for 5k to 7k.
---
Do uou actually like fallout 76
---
I'll log in today and have another go and if that doesn't work I'll try the other places you listed, I need to go to them for the merit badges anywho so it's not a huge problem.
---
It's not QOL posts, it's all posts. People still don't like you playing this game. It's weird.
---
Wait, I didn't even get a standard backpack. Is that the bullshit tadpole quests I have to do before I can do this?
---
Says the one defending fallout 76
---
\^This. It's that lame...
---
Did she leave you because of your terrible jokes?
---
I like adrinaline for mob clean up, incisor, bloody mess. Can be used for most melee builds.  unarmed seems to be the most potent but not useful for power armor. Two handed is good for all occasions, one handed is meh. Getting a bloodied, instigating or anti-armor weapon can really push the damage  output up.
---
Says the one that thinks being called basic is a defense of 76. O.o
---
That’s why I put armor in one vendor bot and outfits in the other. I’ve seen some do the same. Although some don’t and some lock their doors and place vendor bots in inside said locked door. Take that as you will .....
---
Stimpacks and plans, hopefully X-01 armour parts and crimson flux if I can find it.
---
yeah, it's quite enjoyable
---
I had an issue the other day when I was taking pictures in the toxic Valley with my first character and then switched to my second, and the pictures stopped counting. When I switched back, they counted again. If you have more than one character, maybe try switching?
---
I wish these holotapes could be subtitled. IIRC the ones I got werent.
---
Its frustrating if you dont speak english fluently because sometimes you mishear a wyou and theres no going back without restarting the entire holotape :/
---
No trading in this sub bby, the mods get angry 🤷‍♂️
---
Plus you’ll probably have better results in the 76 bazaar subreddit, I think they’re dedicated to trading
---
You have to finish at least 3 tadpole quests to unlock the backpack. It will give you a lvl 30 one when you can move on to possum scout. You can then craft standard backpacks too upto lvl 50 with +60 carry weight.
---
Don't forget that it's even less than half because of how damage resistance works (which mutants have a lot of), since a higher percentage of your damage is blocked when you deal less damage
---
I just now realized I have 4 more points to spend...
---
I know what you mean and yes there's a weird effect that moves across them as you move the screen.
---
By that logic fallout 3 was the most innovative game in the series though
---
I don't really have a point in saying that, I know a good bit of the "generic" sounds were just carried over.
---
you must first unlock the standard backpack by joining the Pioneer Scouts and reaching the rank of "Possum”
---
That is lame. They make it seem like you can skip that by buying the pioneer backpack. The need better wording for the plans.
---
If you're using two shot, I've noticed that both shots seem to have an individual chance of hitting. I have a two shot tesla rifle and the beams make it really obvious at times - sometimes they split off in an obvious v shape and I don't hit jack.
---
I think I got mine from the sheepsquatch event
---
Who said it was, you called me basic because i insulted fallout 76
---
I called you basic because you are.
---
You tried to bring up Fallout. This thread is all about you and how ridiculously bland you are.
---
Yes, but I’ve noticed if you have an ingredient for sale in your stash you can’t use it for the recipe. It shows as you don’t have it. You have to delist it and then it’s available again.
---
there is a magazine that reduces the cost. can't remember the name.
---
missed it
---
How the fuck do you call that game enjoyable, i couldent bare 5 hours of that horrific game *but i kept it because im prepared to give it another chance in like a year or two*
---
I can hook you up. I need to revive someone too, and I'll help how I can against a scorchbeast. in-game name is "Hoon"
---
I can't even take them seriously with how many times they said "cash grab"   
---
they literally said they will be behind this game for years and all added DLC content will be free- yeah kinda goes counter to the notion of money grubbing  
---
And I am sick to death of hearing "end game"-- that is the point peeps, no end game until they decide to shelf it yeah?
---
It's not. If you turn off the *fe/male only* tag on the haircuts they will display on both models the same. No clipping issues.
---
Yep. I have a bunch of those helmets from Captain Kids in Whitesprings. Most people don’t even know of the uniforms existence.
---
I prefer the chameleon armor pieces.
---
got discord?
---
why Tesla?
---
The logo on the torso and colors of it remind me of steam
---
if you are on pc, you just found a buyer &lt;3
---
Where do you guys keep these records and what use do they have?
---
This thread is about how fallout 76 is shit, maybe the fact that it was posted here makes me basic to you
---
famous see-through PA
---
Lmao this thread
---
I love the "style" of this. It's hard to describe but I like it!
---
I was just gonna use the in-game chat for now
---
Many mods can be learned by finding the plans for those mods. Scrapping is required for only a handful of mods for each weapon. But if you can’t find the plan, scrap away!
---
Deep pockets
---
Another archaeologist here, I haven’t done the challenges yet but I commented on another post about being excited to see archaeology. 
---
The comments after we’re all about paleontology and I suddenly lost all hope.
---
I am gonna show my newb-ness here, but what is a two handed build? Is there a way to use one weapon in each hand, or does it mean something else? BTW, I bookmarked your build to use as a template for my own. I hope you don't mind!
---
And to the people selling mr handy buzz blade plans, please stop.
---
I've found 2 things that affect whether or not the photo registers.     
---
1. If you have more than 1 camera in your inventory, it might not register. I've run into that personally, and I've read others too.    
---
2. Have your photo collection full. You'll get the message that it can't save, but it will count towards the challenges. I had that problem at the water park. Things weren't registering until I filled my photo storage.    
---
I hope if not this, that something helps. Good luck out there.
---
Two-Shot rifles are insanely bad.... i just wish more people would realize it.
---
Instigating lvl 45 lever action one-shots lvl 68 mutants. No sneaking, just a regular headshot.
---
Two-shot misses most of the time, the accuracy is shit, you can hit with the 25% damage bullet... Two-shot is best for miniguns and stuff like that.
---
Look around for instigating rifles, they're cheap as heck on vendors. (under 1000).
---
Also hunting rifles are supperior to the lever rifles since the buff to the 50cal receivers. Waaay cheaper ammo, more damage, more armor penetration, recon scope, slightly lower fire rate.
---
Data says that it's not supposed to be in the game.  Definitely a dev room acquisition.
---
This thread on your post has nothing to do with Fallout.
---
It's all about you displaying your mediocrity in the best way that only you can.
---
Yeah, pretty much. Your level has no bearing on the level of enemies in missions. What matters is the level of the person before you who traveled through the area...with level 200+ people running around, good luck.
---
You didn't reply to my message in any way, so I guess the discussion has ended. Bye.
---
 I think it’s time to ask yourself; what do you *believe* in?
---
That's not a glitch, they're just a pain in the arse. They have something like an hour cooldown. I found spamming the milk button rather than just pressing it helps.
---
Throw me the idol; I’ll throw you the whip!
---
Yeah, that's how they get the bodies out of the ground. Just whip it
---
got discord
---
Oh yeah he KICKED THE BUCKEEEET
---
It’s because a decent amount of people, on this reddit are salty and don’t want to see other people’s post to flourish so they probably just scroll right wont the pages hitting downvotes on everything without probably even reading any of it.
---
It happens a lot unless your super lucky and hop onto a server with only low level players but after you pick up a good weapon or 2 it wont matter to much happy hunting
---
Thanks!
---
I expect this to be burried in down votes, but if you haven't followed the saga of fo76 then I feel I can give you a small amount of reasonable comment on the game. 
---
The marketing for the game was far more hype than the game deserves. The game lauched with more game breaking bugs than you could count, constant visual tearing and other minor bugs along with constant server crahes. Mind you this wasn't just the first week the game was out but for nearly 2 solid months of virtually unplayablility. 
---
The marketing for the helmet edition promoted a canvas bag to hold your helmet in, and came with a nylon bag. Minor you might say but the real problem here was that all the people the studio flew in to promote the game to all got rather nice canvas bags, and the explanation for why no one else got them was... Poorly explained at best, but many believe it to be flat out insulting. They offered those with the helmet edition 500 ($5) in atoms for the atom shop, and many many people pointed out instantly that the in game canvas bag was more than the allowance given. ($6 or 600 atoms)
---
There is ample evidence that came to light shortly after game release that the game was ment to be extremely microtranaction heavy, with loot boxes progression. You k ow that thing that blew up in EAs face when they did it to Star Wars BattFront? Well it was basically that, in code effidence that showed intention to make the game p2w or p2w. The problem with that, besides the obvious problems was the game was massively promoted as having only cosmetic items ever available in the atom shop. The dug up code for the loot boxes, and now the current repair boxes show that to be a lie. This is currently being put through the legal process with a class action lawsuits against Bethesda, and IAMAL so while I'm attempting to follow the case I suggest you look into that on your own, cuz I would mess up the explanation. 
---
Shortly after the games release, the amount of people that requested refunda was massive. Bethesdas response to this was to attempt to refuse a refund to anyone. Insert massive backlash and possibly legal issues and they we're forced to give refunds to just about everyone. This is also part of that lawsuits so, again, I suggest you look into that. 
---
I'm going to stop here, but basically the game released was far below the expectation of a AAA game, and as such angered lots of fans. While you are coming into the game later, you didn't have to deal with the absolute terrible opening to this game, lucky you. I hope you have fun playing the game, honestly I hope everyone playing it has fun, but this game is a massive black stain on Bethesda to many fans. Internet historian did a good video on it, fun and educational.
---
Fuck yeah, that looks great.
---
Thats fair enough but at the same time fallout 76 *IS* the worst game iv ever looked at.
---
"Ow quit hitting me!"
---
How is tesla meta?
---
And you're one of the most basic, drab, sad little people I've seen.
---
Seems fair.
---
Defending Dabney Workshop at night is like fighting at the battle of winterfell, shits dark af but fun
---
OP isn't talking about plans in their inventory but plans vending machines or robots have that you can buy.  Good advice though either way
---
 …*So do you.*
---
It's a reward from the campfire stories event. It happens at dusk and dawn. Best way to get it is just server hop. You also get badges from it.
---
I've listed ordinary plans for 5 c or so. I just scroll it down to 0 and then little back up. Better plans like decontamination shower I would list higher though.
---
And crabs shouldn’t be in with reptiles.... they are entomology not Herps
---
i need to land final blow
---
Underpants.
---
Sure sure
---
I started off with 700caps before vending and I now have over 20,000. 90% of that was plans and ammo. I try to sell both for cheap
---
Sorry about that, I didn't realize how low its health was
---
Had this happen last night but mine was a no star legendary so I was wondering if they have to have stars, like was the case with the first survival challenge?
---
I dont get the Tesla gun?? I was using it the other day to get rid of some unwanted ammo and its bloody awful takes forever to kill something and loud as hell cant see how that would be healthy on survival mode?
---
Yes unarmed is the highest dmg build in game
---
Thank you m8
---
Do you like the game, cos its pretty fucking basic drab and little too. Its funny, i would have thought you'd liked it
---
It's meant weapons that requires 2 hands to hold like super sledge
---
thank you too!
---
Tesla isnt the meta part the stealthboy is. But the tesla works perfect because it requires no aiming if its a non explosive it arcs to anything nearby.
---
I like your struggle to get out of being such a lame duck.
---
Keep trying. Remember, those who never fail can never succeed.
---
Thats all that i use
---
I like your struggle to defend your shitbucket of a game by using basic insults that relate more to you then me.
---
Keep trying, maybe one day you'll be smart enough to realise how bad it is. And that last statement makes about as much sense as your agenda.
---
Mine are 10 each lmao
---
I don't know about anyone else, but if I find ammo at 1 cap a piece, and I use a lot of it (like .308) then I buy it on the spot.
---
Yeah we can be bacon buddy's
---
The one you're after is a very rare drop so I doubt you'll get it for 1000c.
---
Finally
---
This isn't about any game. It's about you.
---
Practice harder and you'll some day be able to entertain people. Don't be afraid to fail again.
---
I agree I love collecting outfits. Whenever I see someone is selling armor I go to their CAMP and am pissed when it's stupid legendary armor, I just wanna look cool to heck with being good.
---
The bones you dig up are not dinosaur bones, they are bones chiseled into the shape of dinosaur bones by dinosaurs.
---
So my class last year had to do with volunteering with the US forest service and we were recovering sites that had been damaged by one of the fires here in California. We would go out with a paper sheet of descriptions of what was there and see if everything was still there and record any new findings. I’m proud to say I personally found a bunch of cool stuff like a hammer stone, a grinding stone, and some sharp flakes used to make cutting tools. Also some pottery pieces and other stuff. 
---
These records in this case were kept with the archaeological branch of the forest service and their use is basically better understanding the past and where people would occupy areas and what technologies they used. 
---
It was super fun! It’s just hiking and finding stuff. We didn’t have a chance to do a big dig but we did one in our classmate’s backyard and it was awesome. You never look at stuff the same haha.
---
Todd "The Rodd" Howard said the fall update will change things up.
---
How is this about me, wait i see iv offended you.
---
Go cry in your power armour helmet and stop embarrassing yourself.
---
Light is a reward from the Freestates quests. The others are from train vendors so just check at the Whitespring.
---
Welcome to the game. Many hate the game and it's because they are stupid to read or suck at the game.
---
Ye, all the time hehe
---
This isn't about me. It's about you.
---
I'm glad you're taking my advice about not being afraid to fail to heart. Cheers.
---
I even buy camp plans for 200c if there's any I don't have yet. And I don't build camp buildins, I've fine with just open space utility depo. I just like to mark all plans as known.
---
Occasinally there's no traffic for long time, and sometimes I see several players at there. Nearly always when I heard the vending sound, I quickly check the level of player.
---
Just be patient about it. 
---
Though of course some plans are so common everyone has them already. And I sure can't remember what is what. All I can remember tinkers, chemistry workbenches are just a joke every time I see someone wasting stash space for them, same as metal beds. But lets lots of others that are practically as common as them, but with such an insane amount of plans, how can I remember, having so many of them for so long, and particularly never been intrested in house building.
---
I've seen some really generous offers too, like &gt;100 silver of 1c. I think just normal charisma and hard bargain 3 allows you to sell it for 2c on vendor bot. And he was right next to station. Nearly grabbed them myself too, but I though Im a bit high level for that degree of greed, I can farm supermutants ect and sell their weapons like normally.
---
Some of the junk can be pushed a bit with high charisma. Like 2 caps for asbestos, antiseptic, titanium, and 3 for crystals and maybe one other.
---
Yes, I just ran into one. I was at whitespring station, went to the restroom, came back to my dead body and my junk gone. Killed by warota-AIM. I respawns regularly, as soon as I spawned in he killed me again, instantly. My friend I had just traded with opened up a trade window with him, he only has a 1 star Tesla rifle. Nothing else. I broke out my bloody powerfist that does 1500 a punch and hit him 5 times. Nothing. Again, killed instantly. I break out my BE 50 cal and dump half the clip into him. Again, nothing, I die instantly. I couldn't VATS him, my serendipity and dodgy didn't proc. Nothing.
---
Stash boxes are already magical, so let’s just say that it goes to your Stash. Backpacks are almost a step backwards, having to physically carry all of your junk actually on your person!
---
How is it about me?
---
And after taking a peep at your post history i see you dont have a life outside fallout 76, that's sad bro, go and see the sun again.
---
Yeah. I couldn't fix my camp that was nuked by a friend straight away simply because I didn't have a bloody melon...
---
This is post nerf of the sentinel assassin cavalier builds. I know how to break through those, I have stagger perks set up just to do so. This was utter BS.
---
Lava wolves ? :0...
---
I also have to figure out how the perks work for a tse bolt action pipe Rifle I got my hands on. I know they can do crazy damage with a good setup.
---
Not on XB1 so I can't help you, but if you call in a supply drop with a requisition holotape you should get a chance to snap a picture as it comes down to drop the box. That's how I got my picture.
---
Today i found out theres a script limit of 1000, i only started playing a month ago, i cant imagine people full of legendaries waiting for this.
---
you can do an event called collison course theres a cargo bot at the end its at morgan town air port
---
Ate without table -3
---
I agree. A certain weapon and a few stats will break the game for you at level 20.
---
100% Does, me and the wife completed it.
---
What about a bolt action pipe rifle? Can I change the grip and double dip on perks?
---
I can come down one. You need it killed right?
---
I was excited to see archaeology in this game but I’m  disappointed to see how it’s portrayed. 
---
I think it has more to do with us as archaeologists not having a better presence/there’s no real core to archaeology that could advertise or work to promote better understanding of our discipline. 
---
Hell, there are large groups of archaeologists that argue against archaeology being scientific and prevent us from having any sort of meaningful standards... that and overly traditional 90 year old excavation directors.
---
Capitalism is God's way of determining who is smart and who is poor.
---
That would be awesome. GT is Alaska Adam
---
Is this in adventure mode? And do you complete all 4 or just one?
---
There's lead in childrens toys. The lead is probably in excess in the paint, not the graphite you write with.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
np my dude
---
All four. Apparently it works in adventure mode as well for some reason.
---
Easy.
---
Lost legendary 2 star left leg armor, that I was wearing.
---
100% did not unequipped armor, and not dropped by mistake.
---
Always check my armor before fast traveling, knowing this bug is still around.
---
And double checking before and when fighting scorchbeast queen.
---
Because lost a legendary double shot pump action shotgun once, when fighting that overgrown mutated flying gremlin biatch..
---
Not selected as favourite or used at all while fighting
---
Can't seem to find ya. My Gt is WinterImmersion see if you can find me
---
You showed up with some sort of agenda that failed miserably and boringly... So you started to replying to a thread about you.
---
It's pretty obvious. Pretty basic.
---
I would be okay with tedious if it worked. I had to take like 30 photos of ticks and another 50 of bloodbugs before it finally got completed. Not mentioning I almost soloed a Yao Guai with shotgun with my unspecced character only for someone else to help me finish it which probably ruined the challange.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
I've had trouble selecting my own CAMP lately due to my vending items showing instead and when I traveled there I spawned at the very spot others usually spawn. I think things are changing.
---
All my known plans still go in the suitcases at the stations, as well as ammo I don't use  
---
it is sad how empty they were this week and I have already noticed that I have to craft more ammo than before
---
Sometimes the camera challenges glitch and don't registar but I found re-logging in fixed it.
---
Yeah I just got it from a 2 star ant
---
Its actually just outside of it!  ;)
---
good call!
---
Super duper also procs on smelting. So this is great value for lead.
---
Jesus christ you have used the word basic so many times... its pretty obvious that you are offended.
---
Mysterious quills, a Sheepsquatch skull, and mysterious fur....
---
And my  sheepsquatch  rng luck, is stuck on white fedoras.
---
Not a single weapon dropped yet, or whatever else they drop
---
Free range is even more of a let down
---
I know right. I have trouble building a door into doorway because game keeps telling me "item appears to be floating" as long as I try. but Ou my when I accidentally misclick and Simsalabim there's bed under water and three floating toilets and seven floors stacked upon each others... Bethesda really should fix camp building mechanics :(
---
It's a very applicable word for conversations with you.
---
I mean, just read what you've written. I don't know how you haven't put me into a coma. I have cotton socks with more personality and offensiveness in them than you do.
---
But, as mentioned, don't be afraid to fail like this. Someday you may be good at this or even something else entirely! Keep your chin up.
---
you can tame a cat already bud
---
I had the miner one glitch on taking a pic of a coal deposit after repeated attempts and different servers. The next day I was in the area and tried once more and it worked! Maybe just keep trying, seems like some are hard glitches while others are just .. intermittent. Good luck!
---
A new radio station in FO76 would sadly require modding tools, which we don't yet have :c
---
I have a two shot Tesla rifle. Time to stomp some noobies preying on noobs.
---
Can u tame a sloth?
---
yes
---
Bonus points for shooting Nazis. That's why the Wolfenstein games are so popular.
---
Well I know what I'm gonna be doing all day
---
Isn’t it like 40 caps? Is server hopping really easier than spending 40 caps?
---
it doesnt, little bit darker colour and some different picture on top but it's hardly recognizable. Definitely not worth 3 possum coins.
---
Wrong sub reddit btw
---
Team play is complicated because of communication issues. Most players either has no mic or they don't want to talk like I. I have severe social anxiety and phone calls and any conversation through voice without face to face contact makes me sometimes pass out. Text chat would be nice add to the game and it would make team play easier. Jumping and shooting ground doesn't tell much what one team member is up to...
---
wait till you get your third duplicate aquagirl in perk packs.
---
then you will be even more annoyed at it. ;-)
---
I think that's more of the 80ies...
---
I actually like the pastell. The dark greens, browns and orange of the 70ies - not so much.
---
i have a mirelurk king right now
---
Surprising. It alld depends on who places it. Some people place it too far north and it's sometimes hits that area.
---
I think the laser gun builds into a rifle if you scrap enough  of them..... that or I’ve been wasting two
---
Weeks of crafting
---
You can still get sneak bonus.
---
You can still get the bonus if you’re hidden or cautious.
---
Still haven't answered the question, you have just been adding fancier words to the same sentence, and im not being offensive because i am civil enough to have a regular argument with an intelligent individual unlike yourself.
---
so then you want to scroll through all your notes to see what known plans you have? Or that one you just got is known or not?  
---
I like em on top, that way it is easy to drop the excess weight after events and quests give me ones I know  
---
maybe they could just add a "reverse" sort selection
---
I think it's just any woman. The sihoulette doesn't leave a lot to make out the gender, so prominent hair will do.
---
no. only by value/weight/normal.  
---
so they can be at the top, mixed in, or mixed in.
---
Mix it with the hidious Whitesprings green pattern and you have a real... looser.
---
Don't worry, five minutes in, I died and couldn't respawn :( so I missed the whole thing again
---
Well, here's to hoping they fix that issue for y'all.
---
There is a Through-the-wall Power Conduit that can help you.
---
worst is when you realize you aren't in the notes section because you hit a bunch of aid items, or clothes and then have to re-scroll past the known plans again.
---
 On ps4 it saves them straight to the share gallery or whatever it's called I can't remember atm, not sure for pc or Xbox tho
---
and apparently ( goes above it all, which is why its above addictol and everything.
---
Was this mentiond somewhere?
---
Lol good point
---
and food and drugs should be seperate like in the better inventory mod, because when im looking for drinks I totally want to run into buffout and mentats.
---
Uh it's kind of real to be honest.. trample all over a blackberry Bush and it's ruined you might not want to eat it, but you can replant ?
---
Have my up.
---
And you are not. I'm not visual impaired but some of the handwritten notes are just a pain.
---
And -  i don't know it's a translation thing if so just ignore -  but since the challenges get more and more specific you can't read them at all.
---
This is still about you. Why defer?
---
You wanted someone to tell you how good or bad you were doing and I'm telling you that you're boring. Do you have a plan to correct that?
---
Isn't it Arctos Pharma? Don't blame Vault-tec! We saved the human race! (And learned a lot in the process...)
---
There have been times, on the same server obviously, after a nuke has cleared ar WS that the lingering aftereffects ( flora, fauna, and glowing legendary enemies) have lasted up to five or six hours.
---
I have gotten 8 possum from the campfire event ( that is a full expanded backpack )  They are rare though so maybe 1/10 or 1/15 will give it.
---
Have to be closer. Probably just another bug. Try that event, wait until it’s right next to you and snap.
---
Different areas have different levels. Here's good article explaining: https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076   If you encounter harder enemies on areas where they should not, there might be high level players lurking around. I often camp and stalk low level players from roofs in invisible sneak mode (you can't see any indicator that I am there, no map marker, no floating name tag nor even visible character (unless you happen to walk straight into me like happened once on survival mode). I have no ill intentions, I'm just looking if they need help and often if they beckon me to join I always try to craft well modded armor and weapons for them. Shame I don't have mic so often they end up eloping meanwhile I'm crafting :(
---
If you're still looking for help im here. IGN Vicarious+
---
I got 2 anti armor death claws and two instigating power fist. Was cool got to sell and keep one
---
is this all platforms or just for the PC platform?
---
Most of the negativity is just that, made up negativity.   Youtubers looking for more views for more money; 76-bashing.
---
It actually does feel like a Fallout game though. 
---
There were some valid points like the Bait-N-Switch Canvas bag.  
---
Multiplayer PVP system was originally lacking, but they addressed that and attempted to improve that with their Survival Mode.     Workshops are not ideal either, but they at least tried for a unique system/feature.
---
Players exploited the game severely for Xp (trap disabling) and Items (Duping).   They did come back and address those.   
---
Players can be griefing jerks to others in the game and the company has tried to address even that by adjusting slap damage/camp damage.
---
So I would say the most harmful thing about the game is other players IMO.  If this was a single player game, many of the problems with it would not exist really.  No one would care if someone modded or duped any of their single player weapons.
---
There was a lack of End-Game content sure... But I got 250 hours out of the game before I hit that wall.   I would say $60 was well worth paying, I did not feel cheated at all even when price dropped.  Because I felt 250 hours was great for $60.    I have many games that I beat, paid $60 and only got 40 hours out of it.
---
In the responder camp around Morgan Town Airport the terminal of the guy who repairs their robots mentions how they are reprogrammed Whitesprings robots.
---
Agreed.
---
Didn't they changed it two patches before? I think since the item rename was implemented it is messed up.
---
Yeah, it's the grip, change it to a stock.
---
It was never about me is was about how fallout 76 is trash this comment thread is about your idiocy. Do you have a plan to correct that?
---
i have the same problem with one of my doorways and i found there's a way to get around that (at least in one of the door sets): there's a single door that can be placed in doorways that are unreasonably counted as floated, the white iron door. place it and then use the "replace" option to switch it with any other door in that same building menu set.
---
if that doesnt work for you it's a good idea to test all other doors you can, just in case....
---
This was never about Fallout and, as much as you'd like to imply it, you have to be at least intelligent enough to sort that out.
---
It's easy to make a plan. Do you need someone to help you?
---
Yeah. There wasn't much real Minute Men and Preston was so much less up to it.
---
I wouldn’t bother speculating on the times of future releases or patches. Bethesda is so bad with keeping to a schedule that you’ll be off with all of them. Might be best to just say second half of June to first half of july and leave it at that for a while, for nuclear winters release.
---
Good post.
---
Agreed. Get the Advanced Power Connectors plan. I forget which vendor sells them (enclave?) But its like 200 caps. Has what this guy's talking about. No need to glitch wires through walls.
---
He only had warehouse plans for me. I don't know what else to say lol.
---
I got mine from Ghram and Chally...
---
I figure since its the summer roadmap theyll start it asap when summer officially happens. Its possible it will be in the 2nd half but so far they only missed 3 thing that were "important" but we still got them and now the legendary guy is sooner than expected.
---
You can have more than one?
---
Up with you sir!
---
Froger deserves better!
---
Addictol does not treat server hopper syndrome.
---
you idea will  work only after doping is out the game, right now it would change anything but adding more wood to the fire.
---
Well duh
---
Not forgetting the water leak which slowly built up a solid lump of limescale in the bath
---
&gt; kill schorchbeast on team
---
I'm guessing it's only the person doing the kill shot that it counts for?
---
I'd like a link to this post so I can ridicule the OP.
---
Well they were. Last one bombed. Hope next one is better.
---
I got a level 50 one of those last week, my first good rifle drop  
---
yours has better tertiary though, mine has +1 AG  
---
I don't run bloody though- but either way it is still a good roll for both of us since others want them- soon as I find someone with an instigating with secondary and tertiary stats I like it is gone
---
😂😂
---
Help me do what, and ok i shall make it an out Fallout.
---
Fallout 76 is a shit game, disagree?
---
Subbing because I want to know as well. I use emergency protocols as I have a bloodied build and it halves incoming damage.
---
I can build the Ultracite Laser Gun so it is/was definitely in there somewhere. A vendor sells the plans for mods. I want to say Watoga usually has the beta wave emitter(s) as plans.
---
There's a bug that lets people clear out your whole inventory, so people need to be careful about this if they have several identical items in stash and only want to offer a couple freebies.
---
Did you need help on how to do better at this next time?
---
I probably won't help you but you definitely should try to find someone who can.
---
I’ve unlocked almost every freaking barrel,  I was genuinely getting worried it didn’t have different grips for a second.
---
I’ve put a lot of time into rifle building this guy, and want to make my two shot Aim damage viable so I can solo free range
---
I mean, I rep the Responders unironically, I did the Minuteman route in F4 for the meme since I ignored them every time
---
So yes, yes I do indeed agree
---
That’s what I’m using, if you mean the black rods and such. They don’t actually go through walls as far as I can tell. Haven’t gone through walls since the beginning of the game with all my testing. (Besides the replacing wall with door frames trick)
---
This is not about that anymore
---
Found mine in scorchbeast poop
---
Please dont remove my radtoads or I'll have to change the name of my camp from Country Toads to something else! :( You should see mobs as another resource node and adjust your base appropriately!
---
About anything other than you?
---
You're right! You're getting there!
---
It's at 82% now, which is better. I think at the time I commented it was 25%
---
But those have their own unique problems where the target for the wire is nowhere near the connector and they're really tricky to keep straight ..... :\
---
Good job. Same time next week er'ry body. Lol
---
Whomever told you that you'd get both, is an asshat.
---
Or maybe they geniunly think this is nonsence (how much time do you really spend scrolling...  ) and don't want devs waste their time on this instead of more important things?
---
The new Ghost Rider looks so cool
---
man lay off eating the ghouls, and hit the athlete courses once in a while.  lol
---
Personally I set my prices low on purpose to make sure it sells.
---
I just want people to come see my camp and help me free up stash space. The caps I gain are a secondary bonus.
---
Probably the biggest thing is I didn't go into it expecting the game to be something it's clearly not. I want the free roam and gameplay loop, and that's what I got. Some people seem to have never actually read anything about the game before buying it because for some reason they expected it to be fallout 5 but with coop attached or something. It's frustrating when bugs or poor design impede it, but otherwise it's great fun. 
---
But if you don't like it, you should probably just uninstall it (or sell if you happened to get a physical disc copy) and stop wasting time with something you don't like. It's clearly not for you. And stop wasting time shit talking it online.
---
This post is proof of denial. You all made your headcanon into this great big thing to fill in for the fact that this game has nothing, and now convinces yourself that it is better than an actual something that does exist
---
Get aquaboy
---
Don’t just trust people, read the patch notes for yourself once in a while.
---
There’s a legendary **vending machine** at stations that you sell them to.
---
I don't say it's normal.i say that it's not bugged,that they are in the game. Maybe even personally mining a silver deposit yelds ores but i never tried.
---
Vendor bot Phoenix. You’re welcome (karma appreciated)
---
They do.
---
You need the verticle one, thats curved at the bottom and top, with the connection point pointing the opposite way.
---
The connection point is the bit that goes through walls.
---
If you are on xbox and availble in 12 hours from now, I can show you my CAMP as an example.
---
Yes this worked!forgot about the eggs,have them now to:) thanx mate!
---
Wow, you're such a genius!
---
 It's not like this same idea has already being posted here a thousand of times since the first day the game has been released!
---
The multidimensional pipboy ofc.
---
Great list, thanks for this !
---
I want to meet this guy lol
---
You'll be happy to hear that a plague doctor mask was datamined for upcoming atom shop updates
---
I have a few plans, I’m sure none of them are rare but I do mark them down. I don’t think any of them are as low as 50 though, I think I’ve got mine at 80. Someone bought one last night, first and only thing I’ve sold lol
---
Yes... but they're robots. It makes sense that they do that. It makes sense that robots in a very specific role, like security or store management, or woodcutting for that matter, would have a very limited set of instructions and a limited vocabulary.
---
Humans - not so much.
---
Get yourself the "all rise" its a super sledge down in watoga. 
---
I mainly use the 3 slugger perks. It does almost 300 damage. After that its up to you. But 9 points of strength is a necessity for this.
---
What? No! I love me some superhero landing
---
i saw tens of people fast-travel to my camp and they all appear in the exact same spot right outside of my home, never had a single person that got stuck inside (except when i forgot to leave the door open after giving them a tour inside)....
---
i'll gladly show people the interior when i'm around, but it's my own homely home and i dont want people to snoop around (or fertilize my bed) when i'm not there!
---
This is the reason I stop playing. 
---
I am lv32 and I keep seeing lv62 mobs around the quest location.
---
And I don't like to be forced to wear a PA to survive. (Repairing is expensive)
---
Besides, I cannot reset my skill points before lv50. (I put too much points into weight and survival, which means my dps is quite low)
---
Not a problem at all. At some point we'll spend all our script and we'll be able to buy one or 2 each day.
---
Nah, if that’s the case I understand. That’s really dumb that only the connector heads can poke through walls and not any of the other parts. Considering what you said, it gives me an idea for the next time I get on, although I’ll probably end up scrapping the whole building I made, anyway.
---
It's pretty damn good actually, quad auto tesla demolishes. I think with all relevant perks it slightly outdamages a powerful automatic handmade, except it also arcs to all enemies
---
T H I C C
---
yes but fuck reading.
---
Wait, you can learn to craft the bayonet by scrapping the mod?
---
Just got it doing AWOL from the last bot.
---
Next time you rebuild your camp place the CAMP device in a nice spot away from where your walls will be and don't build anything near it. Most people just build around it hence the problems.
---
Minor related rant: also, don't make me play hide and seek with your vending machine, it's the reason I'm visiting your camp.
---
Thank you blessed soul
---
You know I 100% back this.
---
All "gods" are bullsh\*t. Plain and simple.
---
Move camp?
---
I thought that was a quest drop?
---
You got punk'd
---
Sounds good, but I would settle for mannequins right now, to put my collectable armour/clothing on.
---
you are my hero
---
Totally. Please. But Temporary Enclosure from Natural Threats maybe? What does the height of the land have to do with anything? Unless it floats in which case, yeah.
---
First thing I thought when I saw them was the piper man that would lead all the rats out of the town with a flute. I think it’s a strong reference.
---
Hmmm, maybe, but I would rather have mannequins right now, to put my collectable armour/clothing on., especially the really cool gear obtained from events.
---
This might be hard to explain through text, so bear with me...
---
1: Lay down a door mat
---
2: Place an upward facing conduit on top of the mat
---
3: Attach all the wires from electronics in proximity to to the conduit on the mat. 
---
4:Select the mat and move it just a few inches in either direction &amp; then unselect. 
---
Now, you're able to move the mat with wires attached through absolutely anything you want. Walls, floors, roofs, furniture, anything. 
---
If I'm not explaining myself clearly, I apologize.  
---
I can try to explain further if you have any questions.  
---
Using this method, I was able to light up my entire camp without a single wire or conduit being exposed  :) 
---
http://imgur.com/YCmlzDc
---
And there was me expecting a "This changes EVERYTHING!!" reply.
---
Oh Well. 
---
Hope you find that it works for you.
---
It's only 40 caps unless you place it down then change your mind straight away and want to relocate. Then it is around 140 if I remember right.
---
Interesting, to say the least.
---
You skipped Fallout 76 because you chose to listen to the opinions of others, some very biased others, it's better to make your own opinion based on personal experience, I need not the opinions of others to decide what I Like or Dislike.  
---
Played it since launch, although I am currently distracted by Days Gone, (Sorry BGS!) but I always come back to Fallout, always.
---
Or cost more to save time and costs for traveling everywhere to find it.
---
Where’s this??
---
Give it a shot. The wires for light boxed that I built into the stairs are actually running underneath my house and into the generator room in the back (That's a complete mess of wires inside 🤣).
---
The "take a picture of a fossil" bit...I assumed it meant a skeleton, lol.
---
I wonder where QA was to let this huge error into Production.
---
Ignore internet reviewers and circlejerks.  We need to this a part of our subconscious mind.
---
Vendor bot? Yes you can have up to four.
---
Mine is deliberately out of the way. If you can't afford the fast travel fee then you can't afford my items :p
---
He looks very happy to me.
---
Hint: people enjoy different forms of storytelling. Shocking, I know.
---
Oh my god I'm so happy
---
It's not scamming. It's capitalism. It feeds upon laziness and ignorance. How many things are sold to crazy prices just because ppl are too lazy to farm or know where they are?
---
Level up and use sneak, sneak and more sneak.
---
I'll buy all day at 200, 250 less so. More? Forgeddaboutit.
---
Yes! This is real annoying and it came with a later update.
---
All they'd need to do is instead of the format " (Known) Plan: BoS Combat Armour Chest" have it as this "Plan: (Known) BoS Combat Armour Chest" 
---
Since the way the game categorizes/lists stuff, is by the first character, the Bracketed known stuff is always at the top by default.  putting it the other way, it'd have unknown plans at the top.
---
I actually prefer this. To have an eye bot playing the radio near me would be pretty cool and would actually make more sense then a puny dog
---
AFAIK the only 'bugged' one is HC.
---
However 'Refrigerated' worked 'as expected' for me, I had to actually 'read' it to unlock the mod.
---
Assuming they haven't hit the 1,400 cap limit and have access to all CHA perks. I have 150 in stock so that's enough to rinse the vendor 50 times.
---
/r/accidentalrennaissance
---
I know! I filled mine up during beta and those memories are hard to let go of. Having them as load screens rules.
---
Yeah, or "I left without finding your vending machine."
---
the riders were released in this order: plague (x-01), war (t-45), death (t-60) and famine (t-51). 
---
if any one missed the one they wanted, sorry. 
---
ya should have moved faster and been less cheap about it.
---
I sell all known plans and recipes for half the value or less in my shop. No point holding on to them, might as well make a few caps. Plus will always listen to offers if people ask about stuff in my shop. On Xbox if anyone wants to check it out. GT: Mint tea3000
---
All the plans are avaliable in watoga station now.
---
I've actually gotten a couple level 50 variants of Quest items from this....including a lvl 50 Stand Fast to replace my lvl 40..and a lvl 50 Perfect Storm to replace my lvl 40 one.
---
Bummer Ig its back to the server hop game, Thanks for the reply!
---
Was going to say the same thing
---
I did get a invite late last night lol, but was in the middle of a Queen run and was logging off after so didn't have time to accept. Ill do that this event.
---
Totally on board for this.
---
me too! bought it about a week ago and I freaking love it! I bought it for the lore, and IT'S PLENTIFUL
---
I’m having a clearance sale on old plans. They are useful if you don’t have them (obviously) and I don’t mind if they’re being bought to sell on. 
---
Each one of the slots in my machine has plans! I just want rid of them!
---
It's just a word ppl use here in California even idk quite what it means
---
I mean I know what it means, but I can't define it
---
Yep, me too. Plans, recipes and ammo. All set to the lowest price.
---
However, the plans for it was also in the Dev room, so it is equally likely it came from there in this case.
---
Ah, must have seen that long time ago, but forgotten.
---
Same here. I have plans for ten, twenty and thirty caps, with a few at fifty or a hundred. I might just lower the lot to ten caps and hope that someone clears it out. It’s really annoying, especially when people are selling single stimpacks at 100 caps or something...
---
Nah, those plans are in the Dev room, and datamining confirms there is no correct way to get it right now. Future content.
---
NP, pleasure.
---
Armor is definitely not bugged.
---
the possum one is still shorts but the neckerchief is blue and a dark brown shirt
---
I'm with you 100% on this one - I'm selling two full vending machines worth of cosmetic clothing and I feel like I'm cheating people when it says I'm selling 60 items of 'armour' :/
---
I'd love this.
---
I found the same thing. Killed some scorched and super mutants, peppered the damn thing with the guns they had. Takes a while but got it!
---
Hey dude, could I get your gamertag? I would be very interested in some of the Faschnat plans :)
---
Carcinology\* :)
---
Yeah if you're serious can we get your name and come by?
---
What's the difference between an anthropologist, a sociologist, and a historian?
---
Deathclaw is actually the belly.
---
Maybe something along the lines of an Order of the Tadpole radio station? Containing jolly hiking songs to keep you going on your adventures and spooky, scary stories for you to listen to around the campfire?
---
Yep this is shitty. I'm not visually impaired other than wearing glasses that probably need updated, but can never see stuff. I have to literally change where my character is looking (like finding a solid, dark background) before opening the menu just to see things.
---
Anytime you see the Sons of Dane Radio Alert it is active. It triggers quite frequently.
---
I don't disagree, but that's not a very Enclave way of thinking...
---
I agree 100%, Tesla rifles are the real counter to stealthboys though. 
---
The change that is necessary: Make attacking reveal you if Stealthboy’d. They should be vanishing tools, not offensive weapons.
---
I don't think he is tbh.
---
I use to server hop at sons of dane, it triggers at night if im not mistaking. I suggest you to do it with 3-4 friends, possibly a few without PA as u have to play instruments and need someone to shoot ghouls and defend the instruments
---
Because it is a MOD that you can apply to any combat armor.
---
craft normal combat armor, then mod it. it's an option there.
---
Should be stickied.
---
I’ve killed two at this point. Have run away from many.
---
I need to make some caps again before I go on another shopping spree. Do you play on PC?
---
Move your camp device.
---
BOS vendor sells the ultracite gun plan.
---
I put a piece of Perfectly Preserved Pie up for 666 caps.
---
Beat me to it.
---
You do not need instruments. Just hit the jukebox! :)
---
I was traveling to someone's camp and got spawned inside of the stairs
---
Haha i have 2 of those i kept for lucky charm since i was lv 22(currently lv 156) never figured out how it got into my inventory.
---
I broke down and paid 750 for healing factor. It hurt....but now it gets better on its own ;)
---
No sorry, xbox
---
Single action ivory mod for 500.
---
That's always been a thing. You should never accept random team invites from people.
---
The real question is why you would want to scrap such a magnificent work of art.
---
I got the t45 jetpack plans for a cap.still need to  make profit.
---
&gt; That's always been a thing. You should never accept random team invites from people.
---
I wasn't aware but I'd say it'll be more popular now to circumvent the new base damage patch.
---
After this patch the game will not stop crashing for me. I've crashed three times so far today and it's only 4:30 AM.
---
All you have to do is put a brahmin at your camp with the fertilizer thing. Milk the brahmin, store the fertilizer thing, and then put it back out. Milk the brahmin and rinse/repeat.
---
Definitelt agree. 
---
Armor [21)
---
Me: Damn! Let's go see!
---
Beer Hat 200 C
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet 2000 C
---
Me: Fuck this.
---
I've a thing for Lever Action rifles and have a quad, a furious and an anti-armor. The furious does actually seem to be the least effective of the three sadly. Not very scientific evidence but it's something! I'd guess 30% is the cap.
---
Given the chance, Prince would eat your head if he wasn’t so puny. Remember that
---
Indeed that is stupid. The other day, two scorchbeasts lvl 80 were rampaging my house. I have manage to kill them, however they destroyed quite a bit. I couldnt do the one time repair my house couse I didnt have some tato plants and corn in my resources. It took me some time to gather them and then repair it all.
---
Sold mine with vampire!
---
You can put up to 4 vending machines. I labeled mine 'ammo', 'plans', 'loot'(for junk) and then last one is weapons and armor (you can find the labels in the wall decor). I've spent more caps jumping around to camps that had 100 plus plans than I've spent at the actual vendors. With the new challenges wanting you to make/cook things it's awesome to find those plans at player vendors.
---
&gt;With the new legendary vendor nukes will be more important than ever
---
How so?
---
If you aren't near you camp then they can't damage it even if your team is in combat.
---
A ghoul slayer's gamma gun for 9999
---
It cant because it’s to op of an event
---
Legendary exchange, it can be difficult for some to reach that 150 daily limit, but nuke zones have a much higher legendary spawn
---
I just finished that this morning.... i let out a little sigh when i first looked at the requierments... and im a software dev....
---
Belive it or not, I sold mine for 6,666
---
How long do you think it will take the devs to change the default sorting method? Lmao, pipe down man.
---
If you look closely you'll see that other players will spawn in where you put down the camp the first time.
---
You haven't seen nothing until a super mutant snipes your crops with a minigun. With my level 57 melee alt with fairly bad 3 star armor, with no good sneaking or chameleon effects, I could sprint halfway to the super mutant from my camp, then approach rest of it while sneaking, directly from front, and I still could land sneak attack on it.
---
If that thing is so blind, how can it snipe so well with a minigun, from so long way.
---
It is!
---
Ah to that I say stock up on berry mentats. It turns them into a pinkish glowing ghost. Just unload in that general vicinity and you'll be alright. Did the tesla receive a buff when they did the laser/plasma stuff?
---
I've had one in my C.A.M.P. stored since the BETA, every update Ihopethey drop the ball and let me place it.
---
That's not that good though because sometimes you have to place it in a weird place to get the circle where you want it.
---
Nuclear Winter is battle royal mode infos already been data mined
---
That's wild. Why the hell did they take it out in the first place?
---
Funny you should say that as I was in my camp last night and heard gunfire outside, and not my turrets. 
---
Went outside with my axe drawn and there was a 250ish player in power armor stood there. He obviously wanted to come check out my shop and possibly mistook my bear for wild when he first spawned in.
---
Incidentally he nearly cleaned out all my junk stock!
---
Anyway, I didn't see if there was any contact since I was inside but there was no damage to the bear. So im hoping that it means he did at least hit him once and didn't do no damage.
---
I do always stay in passive regardless, as if I ever decide to take my gun out I always think ill end up shooting someone else by accident or hitting them when fighting for mobs in the nuke zones lol
---
The bear itself is mostly protected since the turrets will mow down all the spawns near the camp which are usually scorched. He just eats the Mole Rats :)
---
strange i just did it 2 times and got no badges.
---
Given game history i'd say between 4 to 6 months.
---
Cause I can only sell 2 serums a day to a vendor, whereas some people actually would use the serum by drinking it. Or, hell, maybe they'll turn around and either resell it or vendor it. Doesn't matter to me. If someone comes along and buys multiple serums, then that's money in my pocket, and I don't really care what they do with them after that
---
I smell a commie...
---
My opinion is it's no better than uranium fever. Top gear is lvl40. People go ape shit over these events and not sure why. Unless your looking for items for yourself to use then dont bother. Although in some cases legendary ghouls do appear. That's the only thing that makes it slightly better than uranium fever. I do it every now an then when I'm bored. It is one of the only few that alert you when it starts.
---
Yesterday i did little aggresive post asking for this, people don't have answer. I did play on same server for two hours, nothing, i was server hoping 30minutes at place where that fkin event happens, nothing. This shit is so anoying......
---
A new one's been added to the atomic shop today.
---
I’m not on much but sell all my plans for below ticket prices just glad to see people get use out of them. 
---
I do get the shits with some vendors who have 5-10x the actual price on things but hey each douche to their own eh. 
---
Can’t wait for the next update though I think it’s going to blow my little mind!
---
That might sell, I bet there are a few people who would love to heal the ghouls at the golf resort just to watch others die
---
I won’t be on until about 7:30gmt but I’m happy to help.
---
All my plans are 50 caps and all of my recipes are 10caps even the rare ones
---
Yeah perhaps. Maybe i'll reduce the price to 5k.
---
It's needed for one of the new possom badge challenges
---
The game had bugs, still does but its a lot better now days.
---
Its not a 10/10. Back then it was a 6/10, with the new content, fixes, balancing its a 7/10 for me. But at no point was it a 1 or 2. There is a story, its just not told in the conventional way rather environmebtal story telling which bethesda does well.
---
There was shit to hate with the bags and bottles, but thats merch, and it negatively reflected on the game when i looked at them as 2 seperate things.
---
Why is this? I have no idea nor am I selling them :)
---
There's a factions subreddit which you can go onto, I found a responder faction there that is starting up you could do the same. You could always post something yourself to see what you can get!
---
All lights r green.
---
I almost always accept team invites, I keep the junk I carry as low as possible.  Never been griefed this way, but if it does happen I have no real loss, I can replace junk pretty quickly and it actually (IRL) cost nothing to rebuild/repair my camp.  On the plus side - made quite a few friends and am having a great time in game.
---
View the game as a movie you get to star in, just keep in mind sometimes the hero dies...
---
O ok! I wasn't aware. Happy hunting friend.
---
this is good, however i also raise a similar point, in fallout 4 we had Travis miles as a host, and in 76 we dont have any, without a host its just an endless loop of songs(good songs though) and with no info for it, for e.g. in fo4 Travis actually gave credits to the creators and singers of the songs, just a small thing but i think it would make it more interesting and the host could even be a robot as well.
---
we should be getting the last 200lbs, sometime. 
---
this seemed to be the plan, 200lbs bumps until the max limit was reached, 1000lbs.
---
If this was New- which it isn't and has been mentioned on here a few times- why do you think  posting it here, where more people will read and therefore use this method more? 
---
Are people intentionally trying to drive this game into the ground? I can't even look at the game right now and I've played it pretty hard-core
---
ow can you help me out allso please. i only got 190 caps if i don't fast travel anymore. you can have them :D
---
Yeah, I'm leveled to the point it's no loss for me. Just made the post to make others aware.
---
I’m in the same boat but with robot chest. No one answered my post so they probably won’t answer yours
---
Because this method only works if someone accepts the invite to a team. If they don't know this is a thing they're more likely to accept it.
---
Ok thanks , should there be a hardened 50. Cal ?
---
i do exactly this, but my underarmor is                         MY UNDIES
---
Many thanks for the intel friend.
---
Dinosaur Bone Hunter. 
---
Que sexy music
---
Supermutants are now super sponges,I have a full set of unyielding armor and was standing still when I was attacking one and he went through me like butter.
---
Let me know if you still need help tonight, around 830 PM EST. Someone helped me yesterday, so I'm helping others in return.
---
SB’s have been taking my camp out too. Someone in this thread helpfully pointed out that you can scrap and replant crops rather than hunt down new ones to repair! (Would have saved myself a lot of trouble if I had realized sooner.) But I definitely won’t be bothering with Frog Prince again because he would still have held me up the last time my camp was destroyed. I’m not keeping spare frogs and blood leaf at all times.
---
Dang, I have one set at 999... guess I should try that instead!
---
I saw that note! Or at least someone else that was selling the same thing. I have a perfectly preserved pie for 25k
---
Ammo factory, Mount Blair for its ore, Poseidon also has steel lead and fusion cores. 
---
I'd also recommend setting your camp up on a lead spot! That's what I've done.
---
Steel and Gunpowder are pretty common, but once you get to crafting large amounts of ammo keep them!
---
I used to sell my excess steel and it meant I ran out!
---
Snallygaster spit explosive for a modest fee of 25k
---
OOTL you can rename armor and weapons now?
---
It is 109years since my born to FO76, I am not planing to live so long, why do i have to put this in my wallet?
---
How is it bugged?
---
Think for one minute: should I really post this PvP exploit in plaintext for anyone to read and utilise? 
---
Why would anyone with a brain do that?  
---
Karma farma needs his orange updoots obviously.
---
I been up for 6hrs+ server hopping doing other events on the servers, haven't seen it once and I seen 3 scorchbeast queens.
---
I loved listening to the Shadow in FO4
---
I caught some dupers a while back that even had 10s of thousands of bulk glass :p
---
🤦‍♀️ The time I could have saved.
---
I had to destroy and rebuild my entire camp just to move it, heh
---
Let me guess, he was above a certain level so you believed him?
---
I sell plans for all under 100 caps.
---
If you trade the HC Plan to a buddy as soon as they have it in their inventory they learn the plan, without consuming the plan. Probably gonna be patched tomorrow the 16th tho.
---
""BOS armor"  is a mod for combat armor
---
so any legendary combat armor can be made into BOS
---
I dont think so but the best 50 cal receiver does 171 damage with full perks and bloody mess.
---
Thanks, pass for me. More backpack variations should become available quicker, what the funk are they thinking? One per week is too slow.
---
I have an alt that has around 120 plans on sale whenever I can log her in. I try to keep up replacing them as each stack runs out. Most prices are default. Some above, some below. Travelling_merchant
---
If someone on the street asks...
---
what are you talking about server hopping is the spirit off the game. lol
---
Harper's ferry is the only place I know of where they drop in the world. You may also be able to still get them from events
---
You are not entitled to other peoples things. If they set the price high just dont buy it. People will naturally lower prices themselves over time when things dont sell.
---
&gt;The bullshit Tadpole quests
---
Glad to see you’re enjoying the new DLC
---
Hey, just got the chameleon mutation and it does work with the armored backpack on
---
?? This has always worked fine for me
---
Agreed. I sell a lot of plans at my camp, and I'd really love for buyers to see their unknown plans at the top instead of known.
---
use:
---
\-CH
---
\-AL
---
\-AR
---
\-LL
---
\-LR
---
this way its at the top, arms and legs are grouped together, and you have a prefix for left and right.
---
25% chance for badge, I collected 10 already
---
It can have high DPS and you only have to shoot the ground nearby other players for it to hit. It’ll arc around corners, behind cover, etc. so it can be amazing for cqc or hitting a well concealed player.
---
It's a damage Resistance thing. As far as I can tell, level doesn't effect DR on mobs, just hp. So you shot them in the chest, which has a lot of DR for super mutants. Next time head shot them and be done.
---
Would love for this to be the way it works.
---
As it is, I've just learned to check my plants first and scrap them. 
---
Then I go in the house and "Repair All"
---
:/
---
What platform are you on?   I'd buy plans I need no prob.  I'm on PC.
---
I bought one the other day for 76 caps
---
Shhh don't tell me we're from the past
---
It’s beautiful, but........my budget!!!
---
Totally depends on the country and what kind of laws/regulations is set up considering it's a subjective definition.
---
I’m really surprised “Dear Bethesda” is still being used unironically
---
Big mood
---
That’s not happening!
---
And the item showes shoulder straps that are definitely not present
---
If they plan to do this then it doesnt make sense to release the scripping machines the week before and have people hoard up to 1000 scrip for launch day. Reddit would explode!
---
It didn't get fixed inna single day. The broken nukes were left broken for a week. Do you not remember back in January when the nukes stopped working for a week?
---
You could just shorten it to “Only if they’re next to human remains.”
---
But that opens up another set of headache-inducing questions...
---
Swimsuit 10k caps.
---
Despite the inferiority of consoles when it comes to a fine tuned PC, consoles have the capabilities of storing more then 50 images.
---
It's an issue on the software side of things.
---
Friend and I took turns on the terminals while the other cleared the area. Swarm of Suitors started up every time too. xD
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
&gt;Beth literally said they will be behind this game for years and all added DLC content will be free- yeah kinda goes counter to the notion of money grubbing
---
They said the same about ESO all they did was start calling the dlc "chapters" instead so they could charge for it e en though they said the game woumd have free dlc just like they did with fo76.
---
That's where 90% of mine are.  A few rare ones are more, but not much.
---
But they’re usually the life of the party...
---
I think the cultist blade is actually a sword and cultist dagger is the knife.
---
just to clarify only random encounter creatures and animals can be tamed. nothing that’s set to a certain spawn point like the deathclaw at the power plant near watoga.
---
I bought several masks (including couple owl masks) and plans recently for 50-150 caps each. Totally missed the event and I was quite happy to find some generous player vendors to catch up on content I wouldn't get otherwise -))
---
xD I love this!
---
Im only lvl 25 and I've got quite a bit of stuff I need to get rid of so I might negotiate with a vendor and sell the high level loot for cheap as well as give people free power armor chassis
---
I literally only sell plans. Constantly restocking them is fun.
---
This is one of my biggest gripes (seriously) with 76. I hate the greenish glow of using the torch and in Fallout 3/NV/4 we could change it to any colour we wanted.
---
They should add The Thrilling Adventure Hour! Sparks Nevada Marshal on Mars![https://youtu.be/q0anIGNlne0](https://youtu.be/q0anIGNlne0)
---
Heroes never die.
---
I WOULD LOVE THIS. I'm a huge OTR fan and listen to the classics regularly.  The Flatwood Monster serial "The Strange Encounter in Flatwoods" was near flawless.  It sounds like a great Sci-Fi serial from the 50's.  If you like this kind of radio drama you should look for Dimension X and X minus 1 series.  They are classic sci-fi radio broadcasts that fit right in with the Fallout universe as they were prodcued in the 50's with all the campy cigarette ads, Soap ads, and J-e-l-l-o ads.
---
I'm guessing I killed my own..plenty of schorchbeast to go around lol
---
Some challenges are in english in the spanish version too, its not a problem, but it would be nice to read It correctly
---
Not so much plans, but comics and bobbleheads for me. I keep getting the same dupes -- Backwoodsman 5 or Astoundly Awesome Tales 11, or the god forsaken Luck Bobblehead.
---
Player vendors have been fantastic. Only need the Caps bobblehead now :)
---
i dont have any experience with this bug as i moved my camp away from there in prep for the vending update.... but do you know about the junk node between the national radio research center and US-13C bivouac? the node right next to an actual unmarked camp (that you can build in using your camp), potentially adds a pretty nice section to your camp for the cost of 0 budget
---
yeah i agree, that actually would be pretty cool.
---
Blank holotapes for 5 caps each.
---
Did you get shot in the head in 2281?
---
I disagree, it doesn't look that worn. It looks like galvanized steel.
---
i set a perfectly preserved pie at 420 caps a piece and someone threw a shitfit about it calling it "highway robbery".
---
You can’t tame a Sloth anymore. Read the patch notes...
---
My Tesla charging shotgun sets this off all the time, mutants minigun about half as often, also perfect storm and fatman, basically anything that does aoe damage or high enough dps. Switching to melee works, but guns at all stop working until logoff.
---
It’s because they spawn when other people travel there, when you aren’t around
---
Just search on Youtube for a guide
---
Good stuff.  I'll be farming for crimson then.  Big Mahalos!
---
They don't always spawn.
---
Ad victorium brother!
---
Are you guys on console? I repair all with broken plants when I don't have the crops and it repairs everything else. I'm on PC and what OP wants has been working for a long time now.
---
Good to know too.  I know Violet is essential for everyone in PA...  What's cobalt used for?
---
Let me take a guess, that’s a....spanking
---
Are you on console? Cause what you're asking for is how it works for me on PC. I routinely leave my crops broken while I repair all and the rest get repaired. Been working that way for a long while now.
---
This is far from new. Also some people are going around hitting players to see if they have the electrically charged mutation, if you have it you and your base be will be gone in seconds.
---
Not a bug, I can do it across all my toons. Have been able to for several patches.
---
Still works for me.
---
it's not exclusive to explosive weapons, my quad auto tesla rifle triggers this all the time
---
**THIS IS WHAT DEATH LOOKS LIKE UP CLOSE!!**
---
bit too much no? maybe something like a small swap meet with makeshift stands, some with few vendors and vacant ones.
---
It was informative. I didn’t realize this was a thing. So even if 100 new griefers learned this technique, I won’t be suckered by it.
---
This would still put them above other plans since the bracket comes first.
---
I second this
---
I sell the common ones I have duplicates of for 50c. They are all sold out.
---
Youtube outrage:
---
Bethesda monetizes Fallout 76 by releasing orange shag carpet for free, forcing players to buy disco balls, lava lamps and flared trouser suits.
---
Luckily we already have enough white fedoras.
---
the generally agreed-upon price in the biggest trading community is 400-500 caps, but i saw a decent amount of in-game people vending them for less
---
It’s never worked for me. 🤷‍♀️
---
You will balance it on your head, that’s why you are so slow when overencumbered 😂😂
---
And i always pass the ammunition for my Atom bomb while watching the bubbles in my beer, because i dont want to Set the World on Fire my fair weather friend.
---
PS4. A few people have said the same, but that’s never worked for me.
---
I've found that Treasure Maps are a good source for Power Armour plans. I've so far found the T-51b Helmet, and T-60 Torso from them!
---
I'm not sure if the plan drops are specific to certain areas though
---
Star Trek the original series falls between FO2 &amp; 3. Interesting to think the two ways humans can go.
---
Single star instigating weapons are game changers for pve new players, esp decent guns and 2h melee. I vend all I can find.
---
I just wish more new players understood that. It really will help them.
---
Please tell me you are on PC....
---
I've built with almost every kind of camp set and so far the only one that does this is brick. I have yet to use the industrial camp, but only because I think it's irredeemably ugly. If I could get the right kind of build theme to work with it then I'm down for it, but so far brick and barn are my sets of choice. Brick would be #1 uncontested, but it has so many bugs and problems that I just don't prefer it.
---
You realise this guy saying don't accept random team invites right? 
---
And trading in this game revolves around adding the person  to a team and travelling to them.
---
You realise this is going to be inconvient as fuck now? When you try invite people they won't accept incase it's PvP? 
---
Thanks for making a tedious game even worse...
---
I feel personally attacked New Vegas wasn't added to this list.
---
And people insist that drops are based on your level... can't wait to see what happens with the legendary vendor tomorrow.
---
One more day to Purveyor...
---
Easyer just to find the pieces and build one
---
If they invest in starships instead of nukes, i will be pissed!
---
Where did you get that skull mask?
---
Love them I would tune in for this
---
Players would exploit this like crazy in some way with some exploit and fall damage. At least thats why i think its not be done yet. Have a rug on a floor over lethal fall damage someone fast travels in and you delete the floor and they fall. You get loot, people pull stuff like that already it would just get worse.
---
I find i get excited if I spot a very close neighbor
---
I put in a toxic goo for 1000 caps.
---
I sell mine for 10% of their  value not more than 50 caps usually 10 -15, except for small letters and the ripper which I sell for 250. FOr the first 4 months of this game I was giving them away so I don't see the point in charging loads. I'm also thankful to the sellers who sell serums for under 500 caps.
---
&gt;Bethesda abandoning their "save single player" campaign.
---
They absolutely did not though? They announced both Starfield and TES VI, both single player RPGs (and they did that specifically to show that they were still focusing on single player titles, and 76 was nothing more than a spinoff title). As a publisher, they also announced RAGE 2 and DOOM which were also singleplayer titles.
---
There’s always vendors and shops now. And just use common sense. If someone you’re not even around is trying to friend you, maybe be wary.
---
I do this, but farming PA spawns gets old. xD
---
You can find the miners helmet and that changes the light to a brighter one
---
Treasure maps and the event distant thunder will sometimes drop one, I had a t51b arm plan drop on one of those
---
🤦‍♂️ oof! Lol, this is why I should stop looking at Reddit when I’m going to sleep.
---
Feelsbad, sorry. They pretty clearly prioritize things working properly on PC, which baffles me because from what I've seen it seems like ps4 has the biggest player population. Though that's just from what it seems like based on the fo76 market subreddits being filled to the brim with almost ps4 trades exclusively.
---
Yesssssss. Excellent. I have so many of these saved up, because they always seemed to give junk. Thanks!
---
Fair enough
---

---
I am very much a soloist as well.
---
What I did was head over to the flat woods area and found a lot level player looking for a body guard. I would watch their back while they went about their business and waited until they were overwhelmed. I let the bad guys get a few extra shots in before I started returning fire. They got downed, I revived them, helped them mop up the remaining enemies, and then we went our separate ways.
---
True, but I don’t like them, I’m a cap dude.
---
They're a pretty rare drop unfortunately, but there's always a chance!
---
Can someone explain me how I get the photos or Screenshots that I make from my ps4 into my smartphone? This would make it a lot easyer to show my best pics :)
---
if you're on consoles, try pressing the left bumper when the price bar appears, as this zeros the price on xbox.
---
Nice! This is a great idea. I'm there. xD
---
As the holder of an embarrassing amount of these,  don't pay more than 100
---
Oooh, thanks!
---
There are no plans for it, just some people who made it so they could craft it and cannot any more as far as i know
---
Hmmm.
---
I didn't try that, but it was pretty obvious you could click on the marker with mouse, after it was shown on the map.
---
I sell all plans for 49-99 caps minus a few Grahm plans :) I have 355 right now haha
---
Don't you mean show? You have to re-watch that show, can't go with just one, it's too good and they got canceled too much. they earned it
---
Personally not my thing but you may want to put what platform your on in for others
---
I'm still using my 1* instigating hunting rifle i got ~130+ levels ago. It's the best thing for general PVE.
---
For SBQ i have a bloodied prime rifle...
---
Both are way better than any Two-shots rifles i ever had
---
Yes, Armor isn't apparel. If I'm looking for outfits this adds a lot of looking. Good Call love the idea.
---
Ahh, this was a big part of why I built in a “ready built” location. I didn’t think the vendors took up that much space though. 
---
Honestly, I could use another 30 slots or so to vendor out the rest of the ammo categories.
---
Modern Couches for 150? 
---
Oh boy if that's a fair price then i should raise prices lol
---
&gt;No?
---
Uh, yeah you did...  https://i.imgur.com/HRYvXz5.png
---
&gt;You are 100% wrong about it selling less than a quarter of NV. Because New Vegas didn't sell well for the most part. Fallout 76 undeniably sold more than NV thanks to Fallout being way more mainstream after 4. Fallout 3 sold more than New Vegas did, and Fallout 76 probably sold either around the same or more than Fallout 3 based off the brand alone.
---
You definitely need to do some research on that, because every single metric anyone can find about the fo76 launch and subsequent sales were VERY poor even compared to NV and 3.
---
Also, NV outsold fallout 3... by a pretty big margin.
---
NV sold 12 million copies world wide:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas
---
While fallout 3 sold 4.7 million: https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-moves-4-7-million-copies-5078237
---
&gt;Also, considering new vegas has around 5000 players daily today on PC, I'd say Fallout 76 very clearly beats it in terms of sales and player count by a long shot. 76 has way more than 5000 players. I have sources to back my numbers up. You seem to have pulled "less than 1/4" out of your ass.
---
ROFL, you got to compare fo76 a new game with a game that came out a decade ago to compare the active players. Why not compare fo76's player base to NV's player numbers when it was just 6 months old? It would blow 76 out of the water.
---
As for source for that quarter number? I've got sources for that too! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/aksw3m/a_look_at_fallout_76s_sales_figures/
---
Also I just double checked and I misspoke, it isn't NV that it only sold a quarter of, it only sold a quarter of fo4, not NV. 
---
As for your other claims, I am sure they are as accurate as your claim that fo3 out sold NV, even though the numbers show that NV out sold fallout 3, by nearly double. LOL
---
I had to move camp to a higher traffic area, I was in the mire and get very little sales, I've moved nearer whitesprings (well away from the usual nuke zone) and I've had loads more trade. Sold all my magazines and loads of plans yesterday and as you're selling as cheap as mine you should start to see more sales.
---
yeah 50 caps sounds fine I don't have the time to sell them all for more I want the stash space and eventually the event will come back
---
Thanks,  I'll probably be on tonight,  so I'll send you an invite.
---
&gt;1000 - 2000 for serums
---
Serums sell for 200-250c that's high if those were recipes yeah cheap AF
---
you can use polished sturdy metal armor for tinman as with this filter it'll look like rusty metal ;)
---
or use the sheepsquatch plushy, looks very pooch like :D
---
I think, that‘s only when you already fired shots at each other (but not for sure)
---
The items you sell take up a miniscule amount per item, so if your budget is full you can't sell anything and if you budget is filled after putting things for sale it'll remove all your items for sale.
---
Console users could never get into the dev room.  That was a PC thing.
---
And just like how everyone called out that shit in the prequels people are calling this retcon as well. Did you forget the backlash Lucas got for adding christianson into the old movies?
---
I have an alt that is a plan store (355) but my main has a bunch of stuffed animals and super mutant body parts haha
---
I love outfits, just not under the category of armor haha.
---
You are ignoring the others that have said that it happened to them on single guns they sold as well. So even with that UI bug, when only selling an unstacked item you only have 1 of, there is no way to get confused by that UI bug. Yet those people are having it happen to them on single item sales as well.
---
they dont play the game, they sell the money on ebay
---
I put 30 plans of varying rarity in for 100c each and afk'd for 4 hours and not one sold. Made me pretty sad
---
&gt; The initial backlash was because of all the bugs present at launch, some even from Fallout 4
---
No.  That was the only rational part of the initial "backlash".
---
Other parts were the merch complaints, as you note, but also a huge amount of crap like "No NPCs!" (Bethesda: We told you that) and "Lootboxes!".
---
Some of the fanbase for the original games just couldn't get their head around the idea that the player wouldn't be the super-boss that the whole game turned around like in the single player games.
---
Maybe it could even give some Responder lore, since they're influenced by communism
---
Ah, makes sense, I don’t play survival so wasn’t sure, thanks.
---
thats what we wastelanders call a mutie-dip, you wont know what mutant it is till you are done
---
I get the highest damage (290) from the refined .50 receiver, I bought it at free states :)
---
On PC the tab key is used to "go back". When attempting to scrap your favourites, it leta you know this. The common instinct thing to do is back out by pressing tab.... but, tab in this menu scraps the favourited item, as opposed to tabbing back/out. This needs changing
---
There’s a Halloween store far north on the road that leads east into the Mire near the top of the savage divide, you’ll know it when you see it. The mask as well as costume is around inside there somewhere.
---
It’s also available for extortionate prices in many player shops 😏
---
Are speaking of budget or stash space? 
---
I haven’t run into these issues and my budget and stash are maxed out.
---
Same I have to mule some from my main I'm sick of scrolling through them in my stash..... also due to hoarding I haven't sold any
---
This is probably never going to happen as players will use the mat to trap or otherwise endanger travelers.
---
It’s at the pumpkin house in the northern part of the savage divide. Look for a skeleton in a wheelchair on the porch. It’s wearing it.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
Yeah. While I can control the way they are listed, I do separate armor into it's own vending machine. This way people looking for armor can go directly to just armor.
---
You could probably force people to spawn in a box full of punji boards and such. I imagine that's why it's taking so long to re-implement it. I can't see any solution to that problem sadly except reporting people who do it.
---
Uh... thank you for your research...
---
I actually sold some for 1k and fast
---
Or Meds (63), maybe they have Serums, fast travels there, 63 Beers, Ugh!
---
Not much research I assumed it worked this way but I wanted to be sure lol
---
r/76raiders
---
I’m about to post sticky platform roll calls
---
*Milk of human kindness intensifies*
---
kinky, if it does work, i'd love to test this out on PC, can die in water and revive to make badge progress as well
---
My base just has visits from the local sheepsquatch every so often and it forces me to dump a lot of rounds
---
Possum Badge stuff....smart. I guess I should get off my butt and finish the quests.
---
Yes. Your pictures are stored locally, to display them in frames they would need to be hosted on the server, which is an extra server processing overhead on already taxed servers, it's a nice idea but I don't see it happening
---
Level 1 Mutants Walking Cane 7,500 caps
---
Will this help me get friends?
---
Lmao is this some terrible troll? Wtf is he asking 😂
---
Thats how you play Fallout properly, at least IMO
---
I can get behind that
---
Atom shop new radio station - 1800 atoms
---
I'll happy to pay up to 500 but yeah I kindly see them for around 300 now
---
I laughed hard, yesterday.  I sell most recipes for 20 and other plans that get suggested prices over 50, I knock down to 30.  I want people's decision to buy plans to be whether they want them, not whether it's worth it.
---
I also brew any quantum I get into vintage nukashine in case anyone wants one.  Yesterday, somebody bought all eight I had for sale.  It brought me such joy thinking about someone loving nukashine's mechanic of getting blasted and waking up in random spots that much.  As [Santoka said...](https://longdream.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/sleeping-with-crickets-taneda-santoka-種田山頭火/)
---
&gt;酔ふてこほろぎと寝てゐたよ
---
&gt;drunk, I slept with the crickets
---
sounds like you camp is parked ontop of a critter spawn
---
Research for ancient duping methods? :D
---
&gt;  Bad voice acting,
---
?
---
&gt; bad RNG
---
&gt;  the game was literally unplayable.
---
Many people played it, so it clearly wasn't "literally unplayable".
---
&gt; There is also a rumor that the scum bag big time owner of Bethesda
---
Ah another person who is jealous of Mr Wonder Woman.  Suck it up, loser.
---
&gt;  A good comparison would be anthem right now.
---
A bad comparison.  All the signs are that EA is abandoning Anthem.  Bethesda is not abandoning FO76.
---
Must have been a convince then.  When I discovered it the first time there were a bunch in the yard outside of it.  Must have been serendipitous.
---
I believe it also staggers/moves players which makes it a counter to sentinel/cavilier armor but I may be mistake. I haven't actually used mine much for PVP but it's great for tagging and clearing trash mobs and PVE.
---
I do. since it is usually some broke arse low level wanting to fast travel across the map.
---
I have a two shot for 2K in my shop. Not sure if it's overpriced but it's the only one I've ever seen. What's the challenge? I may have to stock standard ones for cheap.
---
I just want to be able to snap floors to the outer edges of foundations.
---
Why did I get this post as a notification?
---
I was saving them for Halloween
---
It’s a community of Raiders.
---
I usually put mine at half the listed price. There are still a lot that I don't have and I'm hoping that I can build up some good karma and find another discount camp with everything I need.
---
couldnt the prices have gone down with the massive duping wave
---
So I guess your reselling them then? Otherwise why do you need more than 1 of each type
---
it’s a kill enemies with a railway rifle (50)
---
Same if there is one I don't have I'll pay 500. But vending I sell for 250 so players can still sell them to vendors for a profit.
---
sold some jetpack plans for 500 caps
---
as im sure nobody including me wants to pay 3000-5000 caps for one :-3
---
still looking for ultracite pa mod plans :3 
---
anyone have some on pc ?
---
is the 120 carry weight backpack worth it? 
---
-60 rad resistance seems really shitty.
---
Because if youre lvl 50 or higher, you can craft one with a higher carry weight.
---
There's caves in the bog that can be built in. Follow the road north from Watoga and you will find some. 
---
Sorry, I'm not on to give a more accurate description
---
I found a decontamination shower at someone's camp for 500 caps, this games community seems to be getting nicer/better every update.
---
That seems so obvious I’m not sure why anyone assumed otherwise
---
I pretty much sell all of the plans in the game for like 25 caps each.
---
I've been collecting them from the start, and well, I wish someone did that for me, so I do it for everyone else.
---
Distant thunder event occasionally drops them.
---
whatever it is dope as fuck on you &lt;3
---
I'm gonna need some Paisley print wallpaper to go with this
---
All green, if you are on pc i can send you a guid for changing the color.
---
just give players fasttravelling to a player camp a set amount of invulnerability this negating any kill potential, its not that hard.
---
The overall QoL benefit far outweighs the negative
---
Rolling Pin Mod -$2500 for all the Legendary Rolling Pins everyone is saying they're going to get on Thursday.
---
Thanks 😊 I have to start these missions I've been slacking. Shit I haven't even got a camera yet
---
It's fairly easy to solo. Just activate the jukebox and defend that, make sure to repair it when it breaks.
---
That's ok thanks man
---
I much prefer people who admit when they fucked up than those who pretend they never do.
---
If it is household stuff, then the plans are all 25 caps when I sell them.
---
I end up selling my 1400 caps of stuff to the vendors, and the rest I trade out for crazy cheap prices, because why not? I'd drop them otherwise.
---
I sell it based on the plan. Example chemstry workbench ill sell for like 3 caps vs somthing rare like the faschnat plans.
---
Does the fridge unit prevent spoiling?
---
You listened to the Overseer. I do the same and shut the doors. There is a down side to shutting doors. I spawned inside a house and when I left I shut the door to realize he had a lvl 3 lock on it. I guess the next person will have to fast travel away.
---
Deservedly.
---
There's one spot [here](https://imgur.com/a/6eudt8C)
---
It's small but kinda cool because it also has an entrance form the top.
---
I had a camp in one a few months back. Check YouTube. Some folks have showcased their cave camps there &amp; give exact locations
---
Exactly! Way too difficult to decide which ones to remove.
---
never found them that cheap. cheapest i've seen so far is 500, up to 5000
---
i was fine spending a 10th of my caps on a couple of serums just to avoid another day of server hoping at Emmet Mountain
---
I can make u one if that helps?
---
I think it depends on what you’re crafting. Grenades dupe a lot. Food too. Nuked Flux not so much. Might be wrong on that but it always felt like 30%base- and they tweak it a bit for certain items.
---
Geez.  I live up north by Vault 51.  I get zero anything in my area.  Nothing. No Molerates, radrats, radroaches... nothing.... Nice actually.  Peaceful.  But if I can find a spot dropping  legendaries I'd be interested in my alt character settling in a legendary farm. May I ask where you are living currently?
---
Sold all my 38 and 5mm in the vender!
---
Completely disagree, having them at the top is the best option, especially when moving them to the stash.
---
ah, ok
---
Nooooooo
---
How do I get the one that’s in aid then?
---
Step 1 is absolutely change the perk system so I don’t need to stop every five minutes and swap out thirty crafting/utility perks 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
Emmet mountain rewards serums? I didn't know this
---
Im on PC. What does the "left bumber" do in elsewhere? I'd imagine all controls have corresponding key on all version.
---
I sell most plans for 69c unless they're really common. 6 or 9 on the common ones. Maturity level of a 13yo.
---
I just popped the "learn 76 armor mods" reward for a not easy 80 atoms thanks to vending.
---
I might actually have one for sale right now, I just flooded my machine with plans and want paying much attention to what they were.
---
But they said not to sell them because they drop all the time when you kill a Mr. Handy. Pretty much everyone should have found one on their own by now.
---
If I were 250h into the game, not 800, and as a level 190 was starving for first good drop, then I'd more than enjoy the chances to stock up on dupe wave, purchasing stuff cheaply.
---
I did that then. I've been giving out the abundances of profits to other people. Training them, gearing them, helping them find likeminded groups. I took caps I worked hard for and finally was able to complete my build. Each time I managed to snack myself or a friend a good weapon for 10k was an event.
---
Two months after this dupewave people gonna complain there's nothing to buy with caps. This community will never be satisfied.
---
Budget. I just ran into a point where I couldn't put anything up for sale because of my budget or something
---
Nuh uh shut the front door
---
 I can't help but you might want to say what platform
---
It could mine my lucky hole *wink*
---
activates VATS
---
Lol it does
---
This happened to me a little while back about in december to January my friend left the team and 1v1 me and used a flamer i was in power armor and suddenly i saw i was on fire didnt take damahe couldnt deal damage so you know what i did? I took a picture of me plqying a guitar while on fire.
---
I dont have the recipe for stimpaks :(
---
It does not gain damage from heavy gunner.
---
Really I'll scrap my mod today good to know.
---
Will have a look for that one, and add it to the list. Thanks for the contribution friend. :)
---
Selling weapons, drugs, silver, and gold makes a player wealthy. Just like in real life ha ha.
---
&gt;I saw someone selling one yesterday for 2500, I've also seen 1 star Assassin, Instigating and bloodied going for 2500 and up.
---
Team up is great way to play. I have met 2 random players with mic during the 3 months I played the game . 1 player had a post on Reddit for a team up  and that night we played for the first time . 3 months later we still team up every time we login . 
---
The other guy was a fellow countryman . We were trading and spoke English . Suddenly he tells me , you can speak Dutch.... 😂😂
---
Team up is also great to share perk cards   . 
---
Yesterday I was running at WS during the drop zone. There was another player . I did invite him to team and he accepted  . He had rad sponge as a  shared perk. It did wonders ...  Did not have the need to take radaway,normally I need 20 or more radaway. So now I have radsponge shared as well...  You always learn from others players ...
---
If you are on PS4 and on GMT time zone , just come along for the ride .  We use mic, 
---
My first team up was with My mentor at fallout (I was level 20 he wAs level 125 ) .
---
I invited him to join .... He guided me until level 60 and I never spoke to him     .... We only did send messages ....
---
Yeah man, exploding is an awful sounding, obnoxious effect, I agree.
---
Hi, the way I do it:
---
-Set up a throwaway twitter account
---
-Link the new twitter account to your ps4
---
-Share my screenshots or videos to twitter via ps4
---
-open twitter on my phone, save pics
---
-done :)
---
May Atom bless you with his warm glow as well friend.
---
You're more than welcome, I hope it helped. :)
---
I love photos like this!
---
My friend and I caught this guy having an existential crisis. 
---
[Sigh](https://imgur.com/gallery/RFncrcb)
---
First it's hard to implement in this engine, second it would increase server and data usage by a LOT.   
---
Too much work and resource for a simple thing, they are not going to do it.
---
Fuck, you mean I need friends?
---
I'll buy it for 3k.
---
Yeah I know and TS are not likely duped mate
---
That would make sense to create a weapon to be ineffective so, I believe it would be a bug. 
---
     I also noticed my vending machines showing no items for sale the last time I was on. Hopefully this is a known issue and will be fixed on the 16th!
---
I think OP means what you see on the map.  It tells you that the person has 21 armor, but you spend caps and 5 min of your life to get there and discover it's a selection of tattered rags...
---
I love outfits, but if I'm looking for some nice armor I'm pissed
---
Should be for legendary and non legendary. Nothing worse then thinking “this person has 10 weapons for sale, maybe has some good legendaries” only to get there and see regular knuckles and pipe rifles filling a vendor.
---
That’s the mire. It’s fun to be immersed in darkness when I’m there. But I don’t want it pitch black everywhere. You already can’t see during the day half the time with the obscene amount of wash from the god rays.
---
That would be _extremely_ difficult to implement, as those photos would have to be converted from PNG to DDS and downloaded to the systems of other players: it would require not only the data conversion but a system to send P2P content to other players. 
---
Also considering that the PNG photo folder is not protected and files can be accessed and modified by the system owner, it would be incredibly difficult to prevent people from placing inappropriate or illegal images in their photo library.
---
I'm usually on around 10 PM Eastern time
---
Ash heap
---
I need all 1000 screws to sell at 3c each they sell well
---
I still have T posing feral ghouls
---
Nice one. What do I need to know to not mess it up again when it comes to that? Three player carry the pylons and rest shoot at the sheep?
---
Is Power Armor a must?
---
I always choose the camps to visit looking at the number of plans they sell. Thank you for selling serums.
---
yea totally! how long are you gonna be on? cause i’ll be on in a little
---
So is this talking good or bad because I can't determine what you are trying to say?
---
If it's positive feedback, then I'm happy to hear that.
---
For that it might be, but I hardly find myself putting loads of plans in the stash only a couple sometimes.
---
Also I don't have a huge load of random notes from quests and what not so my notes tab is usually empty.
---
At least give us an option to sort it in vendimg imterfaces.
---
good to know im not the only one. rock on brother lol
---
Never.
---
I can't sell ammo at 1c no one buys it. We need to be able to bulk ammo
---
I got booted from a server twice yesterday evening.  If that is common you are not going to see many launched until it is resolved.
---
Depending on the plan I list most for less.  All the recipes are at 50% of their supposed price.
---
Thanks for letting me know must have killed 40+ death claws so far but im having a problem with finding bones and crafting the frog habitat crafted 2 so far its not credited me.
---
I didn't realize this at first either.
---
But yes you can have 120 items for sale with 4 machines.
---
Don’t you get 10% for selling them to the vendor?
---
There are food builds.. and closet food builds.  Embrace the food.  Food is life!
---
Why would anyone carry junk around ?
---
WS, west tech, welch, anything with high lvls would do.  have him tag everything and you run around killing everything after he tagged it.
---
Yeah is like the tone of the message is referring to something negative but if you keep reading it seems to be something positive right?
---
Agree.  The default sort method is alphabetical and it makes sense that the parentheses is at the top. But I also agree that maybe there should be a sort reverse as one of the options that would put them at the bottom.
---
Christ that would be awesome.
---
Why do you say trading involves joining a team? I've been playing the game for months and I never join a team. Hasn't stopped anyting from working. Am I missing some part of the game without knowing?
---
They might just be the common ones, I sell all my plans for 25 caps, and ive only sold 4/30 of them so far. I figure I'll give it another week and just dump them off on a newbie
---
You can try and revive players during an event also.  That worked for me.
---
Pretty positive that the two shot only applies to the flame. As far as perks, fireproof seems a must and demolition expert?
---
This. Holy shit what entitlement. 
---
They arnt trying to sell
---
I think it's when your farts don't work or something...
---
that one is bugged too :D
---
Collision course event at the airport, call a supply drop, or just shoot down one, which is muchmore expensive on ammo.   
---
I am still stuck on not being able to start bucket list so cant do any events which require a camera.
---
WS golf club, theres a long wall of windows next to a patch of grass, to the left of the building when you fast travel to it. You can shoot into the windows and aggro most of the ghouls. They can't get through the window, and the retaining wall stops them from going around. It's my last farming approach when I'm bored
---
Fake news is everywhere. Even in the gaming industry. 
---
That is why I dont let others think and decide things for me.
---
Dont be a sheep that blindly follows the herd.
---
Oh and stop watching YouTubers. They are useless.
---
yeah bethesda take 10% of my sale price so if I sell for 10 caps I receive 9 caps from the transaction. 
---
When I first started selling I was charging the price Bethesda set the item at + 10%, but then realised this was futile as I really wanted to clear space and empty my stash, so I went in the opposite direction. All the legendaries I saved to sell I ended up scrapping as I'd prefer to have the scrip. I only have about 6 legendary weapons for sale.
---
I buy .45, 5.56 and .308 at 1 cap each. Keeps me off the cap ceiling.
---
Exactly. I only join a team in certain cases, I do not usually invite to team to trade. But I’m glad to know this now, I don’t want to have problems.
---
5.56
---
That’s how Mafia works
---
Blackboards would be pretty cool. Then I could have a "Todays Special" sale on spoiled meat lol
---
I can’t wait till they allow mods so we can get a mod that shows enemy hp and how much damage you do.
---
Sounds like research for curiosities sake to me :) Thanks!
---
It wouldn make sense at all. But its a Beth game. :)
---
The person who says this explains it like this:
---
The Explosion effect removes the ballistic damage status of the whole  weapon. He says, that its not like  a bullet hits and explodes. He says the explosion effect transforms the whole shot from the get go into a new damage type which isnt affected by the AA effect at all.
---
Nice!
---
I still prefer my lvl 1 tse pipe rifle!
---
Wait how did you know that it was a single one, maybe she was just depositing another she already had, yeah I’m a half glass full kind of guy
---
I've never heard that, I wonder how someone would even test it. I'd like to know myself. Its spelled "armor" btw.
---
Mutations.
---
What console if its xbox i will happily join u
---
Wish i could see it that way.
---
I won't be for another 2hrs but I'll be on all day
---
Or better yet, they could advance the world by letting the players reclaim a town in an event, then see that refurbished/walled off and let people setup shops in here.  
---
Create a player hub framework basically.
---
No way man. I bought it and it looks fantastic, it’s a classic T51 but... idk how to describe it. It’s like you went into the Glow and salvaged one of the lost paladin suits down there. In game, it looks great, and none of the slightly cartoony flair of the other 3. This is serious armor. I like it the best of all the armor skins in the atomshop so far, hands down.
---
Undetectable Extension Charm
---
Pc ....
---
Is it upgradable?
---
Which is why I said this before:
---
&gt;That's not how burden of proof works. He is the one making the claim that the system is broken.
---
The video he provided doesn't prove anything. If *he* wants to prove *his* claim, he needs to provide a video that shows the relevant details. **Even if I do make a video, he can still claim that it happens *to him.*** Even if there really is a bug where players aren't getting the right amount of caps, we already know it can't be happening to everybody, or there would be a million posts about it. If it's a bug that only affects certain players, it can only be proved to exist or not exist by the players that it allegedly happens to.
---
But you were insistent that op's video was plenty of proof, and it was on me to prove otherwise. So like I said, several times already, if you or u/retartarder or anyone else think something is going on beyond the bug that is clearly shown here to be just an incorrect quantity shown in the sale notification, then you need to provide a video that actually shows that
---
Candygram for Mongo...
---
Same lol ive been trying not to log on during the week but I need them scripts!
---
You ever make trades on reddit?
---
You’re acting like this is fucking CNN. Take a breather bro, one post isn’t going to ruin the fucking game.
---
They were sued for false advertising which is why they caved in and released the actual bags. They knew what they were doing and they wanted to save money aha. Can't blame them because that's the purpose of a company
---
They could use 21(3) to denote 3 legendaries in the category.  An easy fix Bethesda! 👍
---
yes I know, I'm sitting in front of a TV with a radio keyboard and I'm pretty nervous because this info totally shocked me. :)
---
Boy I sure hope someone got fired for that blunder
---
Spotify
---
Expert it's front page so it might as well be. 
---
You ever fucking play this game? Like get real into it? It's sweaty fuckstains Like You all over reddit ruining the game
---
In trade Reddit’s, generally 5.56 and shotgun go for 1:1. (Ammo:caps)
---
.45 and .308 rarely get a 1:1 more likely 2:1
---
Others 3:1 
---
But 5.56, .45, .308 and shotgun appear to be most popular unless trading in non vending machines allowing for higher bullet to cap ratios
---
This.
---
I noticed this last night too. It kind of makes the zoom pointless. 
---
The only reason I ever use the camera is for challenges.
---
Not being able to get stuff to tag with the zoom makes the zoom useless to me.
---
 Yes we understand it still tags if you get close. That completely defeats the purpose of a zoom.
---
sleep pattern you say, that has been really fu.. for 6 months, lol
---
Since i am Scandinavian it makes it even worse, to get on a server with some "action" i need to stay up late, very late, hahaha
---
Or like a weekly flea market in a parking lot. Just like a mini event for 4-6 hours would be fun.
---
that actually works perfect for me🙌🏻🙌🏻can you friend me and i’ll join on you when you get on?
---
what the, lol :D
---
Exactly! Stop making me waste caps just to find crap weapons almost no one will ever buy lol
---
I've tried with no success with only wasteland whisperer 3
---
Go to the water park. In the parking lot you will usually find a dead guy named Ansel (Adams). Just server hop a few times and he will show up. Take everything off him and then you can craft camera
---
So...is it good or bad?
---
Yeah specials would be cool, juat notes for anything really, even if we had to use chalk to write on them
---
NVM I see your changes. I'm glad you feel this way.
---
Thanks, but I’m on Xbox.
---
I dont get how people think a shotgun should be effective at 100+ meters distance.  
---
40/80 meters depending on the gun, but people have been known to hit targets at 120+ meters if you've got an accurate model and incredible shooting skills, mind you this was clay shooting, where the impact velocity doesnt really matter that much.
---
Most of the terminals also mention the big "renovation project" too, and some of them have personal entries on them from people of that time realizing in horror that they're going to be forced out in the wild. I believe that is in addition to the MISC quest for the holotapes.
---
This happens with ammo.
---
They have thousands of rounds, you make your way there and they either don’t have the ammo type you want or they have it priced too damn high.
---
Its 60 seconds its kind of a typo beyond that
---
Fast travel costs are already cheaper on a team of any size. 
---
One person fast travels. All others fast travel to that person.  
---
Teams also can spread their camps across the map.
---
Is that a JoJo reference?
---
Yea its weird, i think tommorow they will fix it with the legendary trader update
---
There’s a spot in the ash heap where you can build your camp with a respawning cat, it’s just a little north of the train station deep in the ash heap
---
Doesn’t reading it hurt your brain?
---
Especially the level 50 guns...  who wants those?  
---
Make a ton of level 5s and 10s and sell them by the overseers camp if that's your roleplay.
---
No I mean you get 10% of that price if you sell to the vendors at train stations thus putting plans in your vendor at 10% means you get less than if you just went to a train station.
---
A long way would go a little formatting...
---
Yeah I joined the event once, unsure of what was about to happen. Tried my best to keep up with what was going on to only receive plenty of death threats and violent messages hurled my way (and at the end the guy just kept shooting all his ammo into me even though passive was enabled and kept telling me how he was going to kill me, with much more swearing)
---
Not gonna join again, screw that.
---
&gt;I saw someone selling one yesterday for 2500
---
Someone was selling one for 10k a piece yesterday. I think i'm underselling them if anything. 
---
&gt;your average player is never going to spend that on one star legendaries.
---
Yeah, I'm surprised that shit's going for so much. I mean i'm selling my one stars for 500 a piece. If it's a three star i'll sell it for 1.5 or 2k depending on what it is. other than that, i like to think my prices are cheap.
---
It’s 50/50 I mean crabs and carcinology get combined with entomology due to all being Arthropoda... to save space, even though crustaceans and “bugs” broke off way down the family tree.
---
Still better then lumping it with herpentology
---
Ofc you'll love it. Takes a while to learn FO76 even if you played 4.
---
&gt; Once again I agree that youtubers then took the narrative of hate focusing on bugs and ramping that up x1000.
---
More like 10x, lets not make it sound like less of a giant pile of garbage than it was at launch. It was just barely playable and half the time it wasn't even that. They got the most major issues out of the way pretty quickly and worked on a ton of QoL changes pretty early on as well. The devs listened and worked towards creating a game that their dedicated players wanted. If fo76 had 3x longer beta period where they could have spent more time fixing it I think the shitstorm would have been avoided altogether. 
---
It's still often a buggy mess but it's our buggy mess and we love it.
---
Haha great photo!
---
“I am strongest super mutant! but... *why* am I strongest?”
---
Damn that’s unforgiving lol
---
To be fair, this could also fuck up things like ", *, c
---
'. Other marks could be affected by this and my you scroll through a bunch of items if you want to check your durability or something to see if you need to head back to camp
---
“Armour” if ure Canadian  lol 😜
---
Not entirely. I enjoy it.
---
Awhile. Things are certainly getting better, but it could also mess up names with other symbols at the start.
---
I'm pretty sure NO ONE duped these masks, since there are already so many of these in inventories. The rare masks were a different story
---
Oh fucking cry about it
---
it's not alphabetical, it's hardcoded to be on top with the default sorting
---
They just should add another sorting option along the existing ones so everybody will be happy
---
😄
---
Yea but she barely plays and had about 30 bulk from one day then 0 the next
---
The brick set always clips every where super annoying.
---
1k
---
Can't even get your own points straight.
---
Go check steam charts for player numbers.
---
...yeah I'm pretty sure that's not true lmao
---
How long it take you to come up with that
---
the amount off ghouls that comes out beat hands down uranium fever, but thats just me.
---
Actually you could forbid placing the mat within 10ft of any traps, and if you place traps near a mat it would remove it. (Or forbid placing the traps too.) That's the only way I can see it would work.
---
Honestly I’ve been a responder since beta, but the new atomic shop update is kind of calling me for a raider look, especially that blood excavator armor
---
I like that. Great thanks
---
I'm near Morgantown - really nice if you can find a spot near the opening quests, because you can sell your excess plans to people running second (or third, or fourth...) characters and newer folks that can use them. I mostly use the vending machines to put up stuff for sale that I can't bring to the train station - plans, ammo, mods and weapons they won't give proper caps for, etc. On a whim, I threw all the treasure maps I have on there for 10 caps each, to see if anyone is interested.
---
That’s a pretty sweet combo for legendary perks. I paid 1200 caps for a 1* TS Tesla and it puts in decent damage
---
You turn down effects or the like and you won’t hear it. That’s the sound of the motors and junk moving your armor.
---
18k for a vampires 40% ss mole miners gauntlet.
---
As someone who lived through the early days of the Destiny cryptarch, I know this feeling well.
---
I agree it is better.
---
Stack of toilet paper.
---
Plans have been my best selling item since player vending started, I have a dedicated Plan Vendor character that had over 400 plans when I started loading the machines. the first evening was off the hook with sales exceeding 15k in less than an hour, and most of my plans are priced at 50% of list price, I only sell the extremely rare ones for more.
---
I believe the request was intensed to ONLY effect the default placement of KNOWN plans at the top of the NOTES list. There shouldnt be any effect on sorting by durability/damage or otherwise for non plans.
---
Nice! I got this one off a vendor for only 1500, it does AWESOME. but I just got an AA Tesla with 50% limb damage and 250 damage resist while reloading off another vendor, so I'm looking to sell the quad now
---
Hey nerd. I get that I'm a photographer and it's annoying that camera clearly doesn't have a big enough sensor to take clear pictures in a mine but you still can in game I mean I must demand that they add an external flash mod to the camera immediately or it.... it's a fucking game man who cares.
---
I’m sorry bud but I’m kinda geeking that’s low key funny but I feel bad for you you should have saved it for the display cases
---
I have NONE of those plans :( level 98 too haven’t come across them. I hate to be forced to buy but it sounds like I’ll have too.
---
I agree... though now I've started assuming anybody with LARGE amounts of armor is likely a clothing vendor.
---
&gt;bgs randomly breaks alphabetic sorting in interfaces for seemingly no reason
---
&gt;We complain and report the bug
---
&gt;Bgs even more perplexingly manages to *only* fix it for the social interface
---
Why is reporting and tracking bugs such a chore?
---
I doubt it is a banable offense.
---
 But yes it is an exploit.  You are using it to gain something that the developers did not intend for you to do. So by definition yes it is an exploit.
---
it's just too bad it's not related to "footsteps", and that it's connected to "effects" because I like hearing gunshots and such.
---
 
---
I did try painting the legs to another paint and the sound disappeared, it's just ..too bad that this reallllly cool looking paint has this annoying sound and nobody else (atleast of the ones I play with) hears it even though they have the same paint applied :P
---
If they can pull it off, great, but who knows? something like that could go wrong and mess up the notes menu. Then again, this isn't Ubisoft where a bugfix for a gamebreaking bug introduces 3 more.
---
Im not gonna say that people didnt have bugs at launch... but I had none, and Fallout 76 has been a great gaming pleasure for me.
---
I want more found in game!  Like hide a nuka colo pack plan in the nuka cola plant. And stuff like that. I want to find them.
---
Thats the sound that paint adds, possibly if you change one piece (probably helmet) to a different paint it wouldnt still play them
---
So do concrete foundation and intractable camp items!
---
That’s fine.... you can always fast travel out.  It wouldn’t be game breaking at all.
---
Unrelated but yes. It's to do with your distance to an object. The shadows don't update when the frame is redrawn so you get this awful "painting" effect
---
This would fix an ugly workaround in my base!
---
Happens to me sometimes. What I've started doing is after I load and before the camp can load is run in whatever direction I'm facing. So far that works for me.
---
I second west tek, but stay outside.  There is a hole point where you can draw most of the super mutants outside through the gate to the south.  Have your buddy tag each one as they come through the gate and then finish them off.
---
What, how can you get a lvl 50 Perfect Storm?
---
Awww Look at him !
---
Ultimately not a huge deal, it definitely doesn’t ruin the experience for me or anything. I do hope they get it ironed out, though. In the mean time I’m happy that it’s working as it should on at least the one platform! 😊
---
Metal clips through floors since the last patch too!
---
This is important.  Have an upvote.
---
Slightly off topic but what perk set are Teslas affexted by, Heavy Weapons?
---
I hear you... I can easily make 10K of ammo (5mm) just having an acid farm and hitting the lead ore spots. Super Mutants and Mole Miners are the steel ore.
---
My psn is gofukyurslf326 I'll be on in 2hrs I have the ps app I can accept the request now
---
I just consider it 'taking the rough with the smooth'.
---
The latest patch introduced this glitch but it also - among other things - broke VATS on melee against flying enemies.
---
Both have been reported, they haven't rushed to fix either so if I have to 'suck it up cupcake' with the bugs that affect me negatively may as well reap the benefits of the ones that favour me.
---
Said that The Zenimax Overlords can do as they please so whatever you do is at your own discretion and peril.
---
Rifles, I believe
---
seems like they have given up on bans judging from the lack of them in the wake of the recent duping...
---
I grabbed 2 conduits until we beat it and it checked it for the electrician badge. So it’s 60 seconds
---
Same...same... I’m close to 1000 hours I think
---
Use it for a lvl 5 on a PvP server. Those lvl &gt;200's will piss their pants.
---
2 steps forward 1 step back...
---
Oh for god's sake, another post like this. You weren't there for eight months and didn't see the catastrophic start of the game.  By now Bethesda fixed tons of bugs and sure it's better now. It doesn't mean the community complained about the game for no reason. So stop these posts that pretend everything is fine and the community was to dumb to see the light in the first place.
---
Play it again, that's the only way for you to know if it's been fixed
---
*insert MODUS voice
---
This cave has great potential. My survival character had a nice camp in it for awhile. If you place the foundations just right, you can block the entrances, effectively making it impenetrable. Was particularly fun when the leaderboard was based on time spent alive.   Some people would message me complimenting the idea, others were VERY angry about it. One even accused me of hacking and being a cheater with “an unfair advantage” (still can’t figure out his logic. He couldn’t kill me, and I couldn’t kill him. Not sure where the advantage was)
---
100x this. So many wasted caps.
---
They need to go further though and expand this.
---
The original function of the favourite wheel was for quick access - NOT for protecting items.
---
You can't fit all your gear on the favourite wheel and as such I've already lost a 3* left arm because it wasn't protected by this feature.
---
LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
i don't want to break out of the immersive environment i want to put it INTO the game so that i'm more likely to not need to do this sort of thing.
---
All about the people that sell ammo at 0 caps
---
Yah most of the paints don’t make this noise but they are all suppose to make this noise from what the files appear.
---
I had a level 30 come into my camp yesterday and spend about 2000 caps on armor and a gun or two, he messages me and asks if there’s any deals for buy 10 get on free. I told him I’d give him a next to nothing deal on any weapon in my vending... kid says it doesn’t matter I’m just turning it to scrip 😂 lol I had some good shit in there
---
yep! it is funny in a sad kinda way.
---
&gt;blade of Bastat
---
Read that in a Scottish accent
---
Use it to power level an alt!
---
Maybe its a mod installed on any piece
---
I am absolutely down w/ joining up. What times do you play? I'm adding you.
---
A little spoiled...
---
If they nerf my tse tesla more than it already has been or remove it, for that matter, that will be the last straw for me. I've stood by this game since beta. The bugs, the nerfs, the broken challenges, &amp; the empty promises...  I don't see them ever being reintroduced to the game. However, removing them would cause a complete outrage. Especially to many, like myself, who have acquired 100% pure, non-duped EEWs.
---
I’d put it up for 1500 tbh It might take some time but I’m sure it will sell
---
Lol I used to love those stories, what was that lady’s name again? The one who works for paradise falls? And RIP Argyle I was so sad when I found him as a kid :(
---
I think opening up rentable spaces in the galleria would be awesome! 
---
Like a set amount of caps per session to rent out one of those vacant spaces in it
---
I sold my imposter set for about 750c. I didn't really like it as I prefer the Ritual binding and Owl Fasnacht mask
---
Are you on PC? If so I'd love to check out your store for any I need.
---
I like the new layout. It's more complex than the previous. We don't need the vendor bot in there, there's one across the road at the station.
---
Like it a lot. Kind of sad about the vendor but there are no shortages of ways and places to sell stuff now anyway
---
very true :)
---
I wish everyone knew this. Sadly the youtuber circlejerk is too loud
---
I got 2 perfectly preserved pies for 3k caps each.
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
I will do some testing and get back to you I have an aae and an aa weapon lmk if you think this test would give a good amount of feed back

Player in power armor vs. aa handmade

All handmades having same exact mods just different legendary effects. And posting how many hp where lost on each shot
---
Yes I remember back in January when Bethesda dropped a hot fix on THE 2ND OF JANUARY that brought the nukes back online.
---
I had to bridge a gap across a... bridge and it looks terrible from underneath with all the concrete foundation posts sticking out. Luckily it looks pretty nice from above but people spawn under the bridge at my camp so they'll see the shitty side of it not the nice part.
---
Careful, people seem to like down voting such warning posts into oblivion!
---
The joke ones you mentioned like metal bed, the workbenches and others I set to zero caps. 
---
My base is just near Vault 76 and it means new players can have them for free without me needing to be there to drop them.
---
There's nothing to be fixed. They used a game mechanic as it's intended but tricked him into joining joining a team to use it.m
---
You have to be lvl 5 to start pvp on your own but if on a team you're open.... Pretty sure that's intended.
---
Don't join randoms.
---
Thanks to you alle, so if anyone can help me out later today, let me know.
---
I have 2 xbox's so can bring 2 and 2 characters so it doesn't take much time :)
---
I hope they readd them but I doubt it. The problem is, no laser or energy projectile exists it just shoots explosion
---
added
---
The recent duping wasn't as serious as the previous dupers.  It was just an oversight that that vendor sold the same item back to multiple people.  You still had to spend caps to buy the items back. You could dupe  multiple items but only 1 at a time.
---
The previous dupe you had to abuse the server by creating a processing lag which in turn crashed you or the entire server.  You could dupe multiple stacks of items.
---
Hopefully! Would definitely like to get more than 1500 cause I'm pretty sure it's worth way more than that, but unfortunately duping is a thing again so unsure how many people would offer more. 🙃 also what is up with the downvotes on my comments tf
---
And sometimes give you best acid trip ever.

You make a valid complaint. It's like the other caliburs were put in for show only.
---
Because full stash!
---
While you are at it fix the brick wall clipping issue where the wall can "swallow" wall art placed on it.
---
Maybe, just maybe, they're allowing us to place letters as objects is a workaround for them to let us communicate without a lot of extra filtering, safety, logs etc.
---
Possibly same with text chat
---
I do it by being a super sneaky rifle build.
---
Even in a bright yellow suit the enemies still don't see me.
---
They can't hit you if they can't see you.
---
Hopefully they fix the fact that anti armor doesn't seem to affect energy weapons.
---
Unless that fact doesn't apply to tesla guns.
---
Pray
---
I figured it out. Stabilized was causing the issue for some reason. Once I took it off I was able to kill stuff again.
---
Upset because he got killed in a game... once? How old is your brother?
---
Personally a fan of that bucket, bucket, bucket, song. Always makes me think of [this song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unW7UYXSQNY)
---
25-50 caps per plan for about 90% of what I sell. Then a few exceptions (like decon shower) go for higher prices. I love getting tons of caps of small purchases and helping people finish their collections.
---
Im more meaning the guys that run around with gauntlets and powerfists in the hordes of glowies. Ranged builds I can understand, but the melee/unarmed ones I don't.
---
It's gonna be hype af. I can't wait for salty Obsidan shills to cry
---
They been doing this for months now. This is why I quit accepting invites in December.
---
Nobody is denying there was issues. What I'm confused about is why YouTubers are still after all the fixes calling the game completely broken and crap when it really isn't.
---
We really need the option to make armour invisible or under armour into outfits.
---
Yeah I'm currently trying to complete all of these but I'm also stuck as you are on those points. The chef one can go to hell also - those ingredients lists are awful
---
I see
---
Thanks for the info! Now the hunt begins...
---
i wasnt aware there was good duping and bad duping...
---
High damage melee to kill as quickly as possible, and Cannibal to heal off dead enemies. Just bring an extra suit because they break fast. And if you have space deposit your armor in your stash to save inv space.
---
The only one that will probably sell really well is the baby mothman backpack. I can't wait for it.
---
Or European.
---
I've been told that AA is really damn good for teslas and that explosive is the broken part that doesn't work right

They are downvoting because if you put (known) plans in your stash with this change, they'll be at the bottom of the 1000 notes you've collected for the lore, and they would take forever to list for sale in your camp.
---
It would be a few seconds quicker if you are looking to buy, and a minute slower if you are looking to sell.
---
Honestly I don’t think it’s worth more to most, while I love the Tesla rifle I don’t think it’s the most popular weapon... I had a 1* suppressors Tesla up for sale for 300 caps and it didn’t sell all week. Gave it to someone for 50 caps yesterday to trade for scrip
---
I link my PS4 to Facebook, and upload them to a private folder only I can see, so not to spam people!
---
One of my low level Vendor Characters had a level 5 TSE Pump SG with 90% reduced weight, and someone kept requesting it, since they didn't have a mic, I couldn't speak to them, so I sent a message, "Not for Sale", and got a reply "No English" and they then requested it again, so I just set the price at 10k to get the message across, but they bought it and gave me the thumbs up emote.
---
I sure do miss that great little Shotgun.
---
Vendors don't buy plans though
---
And you just watched.
---
No there's not a good or bad just a serious and not serious. 
---
 Either way you're a scumbag for doing it. But the current duping was completely BGS fault.
---
 Complete oversight by not realizing the vendor sold the same item back to multiple people.
---
I have a postman character. What do you want delivered. I mostly do bullets one at a time but I guess I can expand my business.
---
Ah damn, that sucks. Yeah I guess they're not very popular these days
---
Nah. Because I was uglier than her.
---
It's random, thus doesn't change fast travel spawns!
---
I don't charge a lot for stuff that didn't cost me anything to procure. Until they came up with these shops, I was just leaving stuff in containers at train stations.
---
Location. Location. Location.  White springs still serves as a hub of sorts, I had the same issue until I moved near the train station, I went from making hundreds of caps to thousands. I was actually almost always broke until now, lol.
---
I noticed they removed all but one of the doors - the quest pathfinder used to go absolutely nuts trying to decide which door to use
---
Maybe... But i would prefer just unfiltered chat to be honest, if anyone says some stupud shit just report them as you would with voice chat
---
Sent you a message :)
---
No. They got rid of it because it didn't make any sense. There may be some legacy weapons out there but I would be very surprised if they reintroduce that effect.
---
I just wish that there was some exclusive effect for energy weapons that ballistic weapons can't have. Seems only fair.
---
Try some... Disassembly.  If it won't register a torso, it might register a leg, or the head.  I had to do that for the Yao Guai and Radstag.
---
I think you do...
---
No I was on the other room
---
Max, but it might depend on your level
---
That’s hot.
---
Haha.
---
‘What did it cost?’
---
Don't tame a Sloth, they're noisy fuckers who roar every 2 seconds!
---
Imported Chinese Panda, 15000 caps. :)
---
     While I can see the vulnerability it makes for the person fast traveling (traps, fall damage, ect...), I would love to see this done! Every time I go to my own CAMP I load in staring at a rock I have to jump over to even see my camp: to a rando coming to check out the sweet deals in my vendor, not a big deal, to me, who goes home often, still not a big deal, but get it gets annoying.
---
     On the same topic, I have fast traveled to other camps to check out their sweet deals and have ended up loading into the inside of one locked up, fortified, and fully enclosed house... I am no burglar, but I'm sure he thought so when we bumped into each other coming around the corner. Communication was interesting trying to use the wheel to ask him to let me out of his house. (Yes I could have fast traveled out, but I reeealllly wanted to see what plans he had for sale, that is, without having to walk from the nearest fast travel to do so).
---
P.S. - placing the mat outside the front door gives excellent access to your own home without compromising your own security to a rando like me (A note to those who may argue the security of their collectors and purifiers).
---
TL:DR - I want to fast travel TO my house, not within the general vicinity. Your security is useless when I can fast travel behind all those locks/turrets.
---
If you and a guest have mics you could actually play
---
Thank god this problem went away for me in the last update for some reason. Super annoying!
---
If you were an unarmed melee build, it doesn't matter the level of enemy, they still go pop! ;p
---

---
Explosive on a tesla looks different, removing the lightning but works.
---
I must admit, as much as I loving Player Vending, I've found it hard to work out what to ask for, or how common some of the plans may or may not be. I know some of the *very* common, or *very* rare ones, but the rest I have no idea. I'd also like a "make an offer" feature, to allow for a bit of bartering, but other than that, this latest patch has a massive thumbs up from me. I think when I get in from work tonight, I'll revisit my prices and see if I can generate some trade.
---
Dude, why would anyone dupe 100 aluminum, nobody would dupe that little. And it would pointless. It's not like duped aluminum is worth less
---
Feel proud!
---
Resource nodes increase the cost as well iirc.
---
XB1
---
The creativity is impressive. Well done. If you were to actually play it I think youd need to be on a team and have the other player build their own pieces to be able to move them. The game within the game.
---
I don't know anyone with a load of notes in his stash..
---
Hahahahaha
---
Ah gotcha, thank you for linking this!
---
Gotcha the old fashioned way via radiation and RNG.
---
I've been hoarding extra plans since launch day, and player vending has been awesome. I love seeing the notification that someone's gotten a plan because I know how excited I always am to find a new one, or, even better, when a low level comes through and stocks up on a ton of 5 or 10 cap building plans. I even have a sign up letting people know I have more plans on me as well, and since those are mostly recipes I'll just give them away for 0 if they come trade with me. 
---
I've still got over 200 plans in my machines and I think the absolute most expensive thing is like the warehouse building set for 100 caps. It's so much easier to put everything up low rather than try to make a long list to put on a trade reddit.
---
3* Deathclaw Gauntlet is better than PA, who needs armor?!
---
I have so many left on my mule.... is over prepared a possum scout motto!?
---
Because of my wasteland grandma build, the fact that people do this made it so much easier for me to get a big collection of recipes early on.
---
You guys are the best.
---
Snallygaster spit explosion for 1 cap. It sold.
---
If you need screws hit up the abandoned bog town, the tall building with elevator on top. Drop down the shaft, big room with lots typewriters, globes, grab everything in that room. Scrap it good chunk of screws. If you need springs just go to the military camp north of the dried lakebed. Pick up all the clipboards, easy 33 springs
---
Sometimes a sheep just needs to be pushed through a fence!
---
Well maybe there is a reason for this? If you're short on wood, how does the game know you want to fix the wall as opposed to a workbench or fence? To add to that, let's say that you fix your camp 95%. Now you have invisible items in your camp that you'd have to manually go around looking for to delete (if you wanted to).
---
And I'm over here, too poor to even fast travel.
---
Yeah pretty sure it said so in the description.
---
Hm is that dragon going for?
---
And people say the game sucks and theres nothing to do lol. Your patter seems very familiar to me. I've been rocking no sleep since January
---
Something something activate pacifist mode if you don't want to be killed.
---
Voila, you can now accept invites without any fear of being killed/griefed ever because basically immune from pvp.
---
Never been an issue for me, all the griefing I saw was randos punching at me.  
---
Thanks for the warning tho.  My plan has always been to jump worlds (or just log off) the moment someone attacks me without waiting to see what happens next.  Warnings like this do help cut down on the delayed reaction though.
---
yes please. the steel letter use up a hug amount of the build space when using them for a specials board. I've made a brewery but haven't had space for tables and chairs etc. I'd love a specials board that you type 3-4 lines in and it uses an in-built font etc.
---
I came across robot arms plan last night in the burrows so I guess they can spawn out in the world. I'm in the same boat you are. Need those robot armor plans
---
Nah dude this is worth a lot heck I would pay 20k caps on pc
---
Good point
---
He’s doing the Kermit face scrunch
---
Dammit Man. Guess now there is scrip we might as well get it ourselves.
---
Then explain the deficit in my caps stash?

Suppressor sucks it's like the worst

i just die a lot, but there are some good perks for ppl not on power armor

We'll switch it and your right

Beat him up and take his caps
---
Actually, late 60s-Early 70s, the 80s saw the 14 shades of white stuff that was nearly impossible to match colors on.
---
Yes. but not good
---
No, I am. I looked over at his mom and said “that little shit got me...” but it was definitely a student has become the master situation
---
Yeah that’s it. I sell everything from Stash so I haven’t run into that problem. 
---
Seriously tho, I hope we go to a full 1000lbs soon.
---
No one should be selling them for less at this point, people who didn't do the event can't get one now. Letting them go for a measly hundred is shooting yourself in the foot and driving down the value altogether...
---
I'm having the same problem. Every time I get close to the buoy on the far right, the quest fails. 
---
The water around that buoy is so shallow that it doesn't seem possible to approach it while actually swimming. I've waded up to it, tried crouching while I approach it, tried marsupial jumping to it, tried approaching it from different sides. Fail fail fail.
---
I don't know what the deal is, because several of the other buoys are in shallow water also and walking to them is fine. Has anyone had the issue and then gotten it to work?
---
I want that bug to turn into a feature
---
Sorry I'm new to 76 what is the hc backpack..?? Sorry if it's a stupid question
---
The game is rated 18 isn’t it?
---
Praise the holy mooth
---
Its the damn government trying to hold you back is what it is
---
Mhh ok that sounds easyer then I thought haha thanks :)
---
Thanks :)
---
If only I could find one of them with 2H weapon plans.
---
Been playing a 2H build for months and can't find any plans to craft my own stuff.
---
I think 1k is still cheap. Probably 1 year until next Fastnacht.
---
I try to throw the common workshop quest/pick up plans and recipes up for 20 caps. Things like the T-Series jetpack plans, I'll throw up for 1k. It's a rare plan so I'd like some more caps for it, but it's still cheap enough to be reasonable and sell quickly.
---
Yeah delete blueprint and store all items, sucks but you’ll just have to place everything individually again
---
I saw that in someone's CAMP this morning, and it brought back bad memories of Obnoxious colored Shag Carpeting.
---
June 9 (Sunday): BE3 conference, a trailer for Nuclear Winter would make sense there, with the first update becoming available on the 11th, as patches are usually released on Tuesdays. Maybe some information on Wastelanders as well, not least since a new BR style mode could be somewhat controversial.
---
For Wild Appalachia, Project Paradise (May 21) is probably the last major bit of content, but there is enough time until E3 for at least one more patch with smaller changes and bug fixes.
---
Same for me. Caught the frog, made the jar, placed the camp item, but nothing.
---
If they did that the game would have no more players lol
---
First try to rotate the camp and everything, more than likely one of your foundations isn’t all the way on the ground
---
How could that be your problem? Just toss them som food and water from time to time.
---
One thing I loved about Nuka World was the guy telling us outrageous wasteland stories. I would love any radio stations filled with stories, or post-apocalyptic chat shows (like in New Vegas). Much more interesting than the same 15 song loop.
---
Probably get it by completing the associated quest while you’re level 50 or above, I’d assume.
---
The option to sort differently would be useful, on that I will agree.
---
Hover over the blueprint in the menu and press X/Square (Dunno What it is on PC), it should delete the blueprint and store the individual pieces instead, you can then either rebuild it how it was, rebuild it how you want, or scrap it all and start again!
---
Only if I can shoot out the speakers and add kighting.
---
Yep that was one of them, when I saw it there was another vendor Camp next door to it, account names same except for numbers on the end of the name.
---
I know. Lol. I almost did that too. They probably should’ve put a little bit more thought into that.
---
Lol, let's make sure the quests have critical bugs so there players can't finish them. Bethesda logic.
---
Same with me and Ive got an auto immune disease. I really should know better. Theres always just one more run of Whitespring to be done. I just hope the rolls at the purveyor smile upon me tomorrow.
---
Hahaha. You were Legendary-Zoned!
---
Heartless.
---
My bad, so they did drop during event.
---
Your standard backpack that you can get from the Scout event can hold an extra 60 lbs, but you can work and get possum bades , then you can buy a mod for the backpack that bring it up to 120lbs, but lowers you Damaged residence..
---
I got it like 2-3 weeks ago and have put in like 100 hours and have had very few issues the only noticable one is occaianlly a legendary enemy will despawn after you kill it and I crash maybe once a week. If you have friends to play with it's deffinitly worth it if you do get back on hit me up I'll help you out.
---
I found that it doesn’t work like that for me, people hit me and get shocked but it doesn’t instigate PvP
---
I'm on medical leave, so pretty much free all day every day. Lol
---
Definitely. They need to let you place a lock or something, completely separate from favorites.
---
I wish there was a t pose you could do in camera mode
---
Do u have anything else than plans? If not, your camp wouldnt seem attractive to buyers. Put some armor and weapons If you havent.
---
Ironclad/Scaly Skin, Rad-X/Shields and a melee that even without perks usually one shots the ghouls. :D
---
I never accept random invites - if you can't afford to pay fast travel costs, then just walk.
---
Yep this. I was stoked until I read its worn under armour. That just isnt going to relfect those Zetan mind control beams properly.
---
I would go to white springs and kill all of the sentry bots which give you about 800xp each then I would server hop and kill them again
---
What's your gamer tag?
---
Don’t fuel this troll my dude
---
Just hit store or scrap or whatever the button is and it'll tear it apart and store each individual piece. I build my camps in a way that they only fit the spot they are in 9 times out of ten, if there wasn't a button for this I would be screwed.
---
I certainly hope that is the case. Would be nice to get an auto-harvester for my home. I know it wouldn't be lore friendly, but imagine getting our hands on a Securitron.
---
Pretty sure that was a bug when repairing to 200% with the fix it good perk.
---
I put it in X-01 and it makes it look like ultracite... Why did they go through so much work on the others and Wang it on the last one. I just blew my atoms on it. 🙄
---
Not completely. Repaired crops can still have yields.
---
It's clearly part of the conspiracy
---
lol :)
---
sorry to hear it.. they should have mentioned it will replace facial hair..
---
i dont think this meets the definition of unplayable tho..
---
I'm one of those that uses hazmat suits for nuke zones even though I always have my PA in possession.
---
Basically I can only stay ranged for kills and position myself in places inaccessible unless on marsupial. If things get hairy and they do happen, I do get killed within like 3 hits from a glowing one. In any case I value my sneak advantage and not having the need to keep using radaways more so there's that
---
Yeah the event wont spawn when we need it. And it will spawn for tomorrow's daily when we don't need it. The other annoying event like this is the Lighthouse event to spawn the mothman.
---
Why can't they make it like the campfire event, it's a guarantee event at night.
---
Just a note to Bethesda game developers, server hopping over and over again just to find one specific event for hours isn't really playing the game.
---
Thats not your treat stupid human.
---
i thinking the plan vending took off- unexpected EASY way to earn caps i have several for sale now myself.

Published on Feb 13, 2019

I didn't count, but are there really 1001, or is he exaggerating.
---
95% of the reason to get this mutation.
---
It’s a great beverage for sure - doesn’t spoil and isn’t alcohol (unless you make it into Hard Lemonade)
---
So true. But yeah, they did mention "choices that carry weight". My theory on that is that the "wastelanders" update could operate similar to Warframe's Relays. By that I mean the community is notified of its presence, and it is up to the community as a whole to help bolster and defend it enough times for it to remain. With that idea in mind, I could see it as a way to bring in NPCs and some dynamic features too it. Say the initial junktown/settlement is defended and supplied long enough, it would become an official settlement/town. It could offer daily and fetch quests, new interactions, and (if we are lucky) bartering (similar to FO4's mechanic). Perhaps helping them could reward players with stimpacks, caps, new plans for unique weapons (if that Pitt idea was tossed in, the pick-saw would be awesome), plans for clothing making from a seamstress, etc. It would certainly be one way to see the world grow.
---
I finally got it. if you are looking at the lake from the speaker, don't approach the right buoy at the back (the problem buoy) from "infront" of it. go to close right, then over to the left, and around in a sort of circle. the problem buoy should be last, and you should approach it from the other direction.
---
ironically this path takes you way more above water, but isn't bugged.
---
That's a gulper, alright.
---
the two scout dailys have a small chance, then there are the world challenges as well (some are bugged)
---
This fella wants a belly rub :)
---
Report them to BGS
---
Same most plans are 5 to 25 caps.
---
Genius idea.  Glad it worked out and thank you for letting me know.
---
I really want to wear my brotherhood fatigues too, it annoys me that they’re under armour, so I just wear either normal army fatigues or the BOS lab coat
---
I believe there usually is also power armor skins are usually for a day or a week
---
Thanks, I'll try sneaking up on it from behind.
---
been there, done that....and still do.
---
Weekdays, I get up as the sun is coming up.
---
Weekends, I go to bed as the sun is coming up.....

I sell them for 10 x less their recommended price.

Omfg, lol!

Scout's Life #9. I had it in my vendor for a hot two seconds until I realized that nobody was going to pay 50 caps in order to save 30 caps to move C.A.M.P.
---
Mine hasn't.
---
I could see something like a Pre-war Ghoul who could be the host. He would reminisce between playlists about how things were before the war, his experiences after the bombs dropped, how it was becoming a ghoul. Even could see some "mock" call-ins from "players". Maybe some more serious ones, some goofy ones, etc.
---
I was dumping most plans I already knew back into my machine for like 50 caps. I just want them out of my inventory. I probably could have gotten more caps, sure. I'm just glad they're going. Just hopefully to proper who are going to use them, not just resell them.
---
This works. Coming from someone that puts serious time into their builds, this is the best method to neatly power your camp without seeing wires. It takes some time to get used to, but once you get it, you’ll always use it. 
---
The above comment explained it pretty well. Just know this works with floor mats/rugs and either the upwards facing conduit OR a pylon if you want them on the ground. If you want the conduit on the wall, place it on a sign (like the no smoking sign). You still do what was explained above, connecting power to the generator or other conduit, then moving the sign or rug just an inch to the side. You have to move it once to a spot that could still be connected, but after that you can move it anywhere at all that you want without the wires breaking. Use this method!
---
Being a super mutant, that's a paddlin. Complaining about paddlin, that it's a pole in the hole.
---
Plan envy.
---
&gt; You see, the haters (not reasonable critics, the real haters) now believe, truly believe, southern baptist believe, that this game is a flaming shitpile. They believe the game is shit, so it must be shit. And as the complaints are fixed one by one, they must cling to something, at least the memory of the complaints if nothing else. I guarantee that right now, someone is desperately pounding out about how they don't hate the game, they just want to "help the game grow", or "the company should be held responsible." Someone else is furiously typing "they should never have released the game as buggy as they did." Or "There is no end game", which I agreed with until the latest content update and the oncoming legendary vendor. And no matter what patches happen, no matter what bugs are fixed, no matter how well this is going compared to other online games in terms of content release, it will never be enough, because they believe the game is a flaming garbage heap.
---
When we told people we liked the game back in the dark ages of November 2018-April 2019 the main retort was "sunk cost fallacy", i.e. we had to love the game or we'd have to admit we'd wasted our time and money.
---
But it's pretty clear that that works two ways.  People who keep bringing up things that have been fixed for months are indulging in their own sunk cost fallacy -- they've invested so much in dissing the game and its players that it would cost them to admit that it has any worth at all.
---
I like the two shot better but on hoarded of ghouls the suppressor did great to keep my health up. I’d hit them all with a clip go to a secondary weapon and they’d drop like flies and barely deal me any damage! It depends on when and where you’re using it
---
There was a prior warning it would be removed from the store.
---
I just throw mine in the store for whatever they default to and drop the price every few days by around 10-30% until it sells. Gotta move those plans!
---
Don't forget that Kent Connolly is alive and more so had been mentioned in game during the Mistress of Mysteries quest. I won't lie, I would so love to be able to be pen-pals with him. To read his words about how happy he is to hear the Mistress of Mysteries legacy lives on through (insert name here), how there are survivors in Appalachia, maybe he could even have you hunt down comics for him. Could mail them via a unique Mr. Handy.
---
if you have any issues I can take a picture and draw over it if you like.
---
It literally says it’s a skin in the description.
---
I used to carry every know plan/recipe on my character and drop all other notes in my stash just in case I ran into a trade and they needed one. Now I have gladly placed them all (over 120 I believe) into my vendors and I couldn't be happier: they sell great, I mark them down so people get a good deal, and none have been (possibly) wasted dropping into a random container hoping someone would find and need them. I may not be able to use them, but by Atom I earned those and I will not see them go to waste!
---
The hidden truth of Fallout -- the world wasn't destroyed by nuclear war, it was actually ruined by too many desk fans and typewriters.  By collecting them and scrapping them we are helping to make the world livable again.
---
I think they mentioned with display cases will be coming weapon racks and stands, usable magazine stands, bobblehead cases, and mannequins. Honestly I wish they would just let us decorate with our junk items. Would so love to set up my kitchen to be more lively.
---
Oh right the bug parts one. Where is that again?
---
Wedding ring for 5000
---
While this seems reasonable, a good retailer knows one must accommodate the customer. Sales are life.
---
You want electricity back? Fresh purified Water? Turret protection?
---
Well better you fix the Mutfruit first or no repair at all!
---
How do people in the Mire and Cranberrybog even keep camps? I'm in the Forest with only lvl 1 to 5 mobs attacking my base and it seems like everytime I come back to it, half the base's defences have been destroyed.
---
I can't bring myself to sell ammo even for 1 a cap I'm really hoping for a bulk option 
---
that said I sell plans for initial cap value except ivory handles which are 1 cap or stuffed in a chest somewhere
---
Thank you buddy, will have to try and keep my eye out for the hc plan or someone with one either way
---
They should set up a prioritization system. Walls/roof/foundation&gt;power&gt;workbenches/stations&gt;turrets&gt;decoration should/furniture&gt;crops.
---
My sides
---
&gt;  Reviewers have a short amount of time to cram in game content and give their opinion.
---
Nope.  They have nothing to gain by cramming in game content and giving opinion.  They have everything to gain by keeping people watching.  Funny bugs and outrage work much better than reasoned criticism.
---
they took it off cuz no one wants that shit playa
---
Probably to unlock mods
---
That was a bug that gave extra resist with the fix it cards??
---
-_-
---
Thought it was a bug it wasn’t doing it anymore
---
Those used to be highly valued fir pvp—25k.  Interest has waned but still 10kish or more to the right buyer. You shoukd sell it on one of the subReddits and don’t just take the first offer.
---
So... a mask covered your character's face and now you can't play the game because the beard is under the mask?
---
This is why it was worth the post. Had I known about it I would have ignored the request or logged out as soon as some random coincidentally spawned in right after me and my new "team"  at my base. Information is not a bad thing.

Obviously the longshoreman, tattered, and leather coat look good. 
---
What I’m waiting on is the survivalist 2 outfit in the atom shop and the one with tire armor from the news pics.
---
It doesn't completely work that way, if you are on a team, and one member is in combat, then you are also automatically in Combat as well.
---
It's best to know who you are teaming up with, another common tactic is initiating a trade so they can see how you are equipped before deciding to attack, this is due to the fact most of them are pussies that can't handle survival mode.
---
&gt; How exactly do you have fun when everytime you attempt to do something that could be fun, you either crash, the game glitches out somehow, something doesn't work, or the mob you worked hard to kills body just disappears without a chance to loot it? 
---
Easily, because that doesn't happen to me.
---
The one serious problem that FO76 has is the incredibly variable experience people have of it.  Some people describe it as you do, some people just don't see that instability.  On a very, very bad week I get maybe one crash.
---
Which weapon? I'm bloodied and when my health goes up to around 50 my damage goes down quite a bit, I normally run glow site. Perhaps I should work on my blocking?
---
maybe the location? 
---
I have a little bit of everything and I sold almost all of my plans the first couple days for 10-15 caps and it's like a revolving door of sales sometimes. having most of the categories full and dirt cheap prices seems to help.
---
I’ll just tell you some of my fave outfits ouo it’s one of my fave parts of the game!
---
Currently : Black Spikehawk Hair + Hunters Longcoat + Atom shop black backpack + standard pipboy - looks really fresh - when I didn’t have this hair I used to wear the confederate hat and the color goes pretty well
---
Red dress + red and white pipboy + prisoner collar + cloche hat or red hair &lt;3 really cute 
---
Engineers uniform + newsboy cap or the welding helmet depending on your choice + standard pipboy and a drill for lols is cute af - love all the tools on this outfit 
---
Another of my faves rn is good with the new standard backpack - so winter jacket and jeans + standard or sticker pipboy + standard backpack + ushanka hat is really nice looking for like a wanderer look 
---
That’s all I can think of rn ^^

I like to Brotherhood of Steel role-play. I run around in a set of Black Officer’s Under-armor and mostly heavy BOS Combat Armor, finished off with the Black Military beret and dark sunglasses.
---
any non automatic rifle builds will love this.
---
The mask doesn’t cover the chin but the beard is still gone
---
This is the exact reason why i'm tired today
---
Is this still a thing after patch 9?
---
Did everyone forget about when they accidentally shared tons of peoples’ personal information because they were sending support tickets to random people?
---
I’ve been trying to get it myself and when googling it came across a lot of posts where people said there’s no plan in the game files, and that you learn it by scrapping the mod itself, like the marine assault helmet. Some people were saying that they learned it from scrapping the guns but more were saying it had to be the mod itself and I personally have scrapped so many black powder rifles and never gotten the bayonet. So it must be. I just can’t find any bayonets to scrap now.
---
Moving your camp device changes where you spawn. You just have to keep moving it until you're happy.
---
AA/Less dmg while power attacking Deathclaw Gauntlet, it usually hits their head which kills them or leaves them with a sliver for me.  Blocking helps a lot, try to use the perk that ensures your limb won't be broken by blocking those swings however.
---
Census violence
---
I e been wearing the ritual mask with the imposter sheepsquatch outfit. Have a long duster and a fedora otherwise. 
---
I swap my outfits around to mess with my teammates.
---
I have a mutants LMG set for 5000 caps, because I will never use it but down want to just scrip it. It'll never sell.
---
Nope, they spawn in or off to the side of a rock to the north of my camp.  Good news is they don't take rad damage from being in water until they leave and reenter said water; bad news is it can take a while to get out of the rock.  We really need fast travel mats back, and I'm unsure why they were removed.
---
&gt; Many of the bugs from Fallout 4 are still in game. 
---
Examples?
---
Whats your favorite? Im stuck on the bomber jacket and marine helmet
---
The different ones are only there for a week? I think that’s right
---
If I don't move it, it's different each time, if I do it's still different each time in the same way, moving the camp object do not make a difference!
---
Gristle, I love that paint scheme and have it on a couple of my armor sets. If you’re on PC, look me up and I’ll paint a set of armor pieces for for you.
---
IGN pretty much the same as here:

Had issues with it also about a month ago and never went back. He was stuck and wouldn't finish his job. And like you all I could do is kill and gain crap. I needed some reward if the event was being stingy.
---
Maybe the person that told them that was selling AA teslas.
---
Scraping power armor doesn't unlock mod does it?  I've scraped 75 to get the achievement and never unlocked one
---
something something... your post is bad and you should feel bad.
---
You can't give Atom Shop stuff to other players, including PA paint
---
This happened to me all the time at starting at level 20 or whenever I left the forest. I got real familiar with healing salve material locations and repairing my armor and weapons every 45 mins or so. The grind from 25 to 40 was by far the least fun part of the game and is a big part of why I haven't re-rolled another character.
---
Lol I getcha
---
Really?, Good to know as i was going to do this later to get X01 stuff. Thnx for the heads up.👍
---
Well unlike in other games they are easy to get apparently 1 spawns on top of westtec
---
Agreed. I am still prepping for a rage quit, for when i scrap my responder outfit!
---
ARHAHAAA! Thanks for the laugh my dude :D
---
Yeah I'm holding my breath more because I too notices a change with my scoped toon.
---
&gt;Proceeds to waste 6 hours of my time running across the map because Won't join any teams
---
If only there was some sort of system in place where you could fast travel to a location on the map and not just to teammates. 
---
Oh well, best walk 6 hours rather than meeting up at a train station or other landmark. Game ruined.
---
Yeah, random mutation roulette...   
---
Kind of think there should be a vendor / game for that..
---
Farmhand clothes with a cowboy hat and a pair of sunglasses. I also have a bunch of other outfits in my stash that I'm considering wearing at some point, haha.
---
I usually keep about a pound of junk on me at most, it's always in my Stash
---
And i am not willing to hold 5lbs items for less than 1000 caps in my stash.
---
sorry for late reply. so long as the space they occupied on the disk,has not been over written,then your files will still be there. The trick is to tell the file system that they exist and recover them. I unfortunatly,do not have an xb,but someone out there will tell you how. fallout is not the issue here,just file recovery.
---
poss if you plug the hd into a pc, you can use a veriaty of software recovery tools.
---
bethesda: "we nerfed licensed plumber because people were depending on pipe weapons too much" - adds pipe weapons to the legendary purveyor pool
---
In the last 24 hours I found 3 broken prosnap deluxe cameras in random containers. I wish I could sell them or do anything with them, because I already have my own camera upgraded.
---
Well I have a Yao Gui cave near my camp and never carry junk on me.
---
So no-one ever messes with me cuz they get no junk from it and if they get too close too my camp the 3 pacified lvl 76 Yao Gui’s kick em in the but.

You also get pemmican as a reward from finishing the Stings and Things daily quest that Scout Leader Treadly gives you at Dolly Sods
---
I have those 103/86 stats on my chest piece which is 1 \*  just heavy metal chest with BOS and Dense mod i believe.
---
I gave up on sent/cav/ass thing...never could get a drop or afford to buy the pieces...I just go with that dmg stats, and im pretty good...getting around 360 dmg resist...Non-PA, but its annoying to fix it all the time when my PA rarely needed repairs, BUT i always was looking for Fusion cores....ugh...like squeezing a balloon.
---
The mechanic jumpsuit collar cuts into my characters hair. [Literally unplayable](https://i0.wp.com/fo76.mmo-fashion.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/11/fallout-76-mechanic-jumpsuit-3.jpg?ssl=1).
---
Have done this many times and nada.  Same at orher spawns.  Been hoping to just buy it in the shop to end the fustration.
---
Raider for the win
---
Especially in Nuked Whitesprings a Hazmat Suit is pretty good because the Ghouls mainly deal Radiation Dmg and the Suit has higher Rad Res than Power Armor. 
---
With the Skills Blocker, Ironclad and Barbarian u can survive well there.
---
I just have the perfectly preserved pie for 9,999 caps. Waiting to see if someone will actually buy it lol
---
I can confirm from my observation that this event triggers around 6:21 PM in-game time (so basically as early as 6 PM in-game) and will trigger to spawn if the cool down has already been met for 1 hour and 15 minutes beforehand.
---
Bathrobe, officer hat, sunglasses. ALWAYS.
---
This makes me so sad for the people who just want to play without fighting. I allow my son to play with supervision and he likes to send team invites to anyone he finds just to run around with other players.
---
It's probably going to get worse, I'm going to do the enclave and BOS stuff in the next week or so. LV 122.
---
I've had Enclave scout armor since I hit level 50. I switch between Forest and Urban camo though.
---
Sometimes I'll wear my Enclave officer uniform over it. And since the player vending update, I've been rockin' the Sheepsquatch outfit. (Bethesda pls start selling real Sheepsquatch merch I'll buy the outfit and plush in a heartbeat)
---
I honestly DGAF about what it looks like.
---
But that's just one man's opinion.
---
I think I've seen this porno.
---
The last patch removed all the bonuses from over-repairing armor or weapons. Unclear if they considered it a bug or not because (as far as i know) it wasn’t listed in the patch notes.
---
Uh ok, someone is having a problem, is visibly upset by it so I'm trying to bring them a solution. A simple one, with that.
---
Why should I feel bad here ?
---
Never join randoms is one of the 1st things I tell new players. If you do, do so at your own risk.
---
Seriously? Oh that’s lame as hell. I’ve been holding on to a couple stabilized mods for my scout armor, hoping they’d fix it so i could apply them one day. Instead they just break stabilized? Blah.
---
A mix of heavy, medium and light leather (Whatever had the legendary effects I most wanted!) all with camo paint, military fatigues underneath, a camo bandana and a cowboy hat to complete the look.
---
Sometimes I'll change to the black military cap and add facial camo (with the 'Grime' options in the character creator) for that extra "I used to be in the military and I'm damned if a little apocalypse is going to make my uniform standards slip" goodness :)
---
Yeah no shit
---
Just leave the game if that happens
---
Whip it good!
---
Yea, I think the way mines and grenades behave has always been odd.  Maybe we can get the sticky grenades from COD.
---
&gt; I expect this to be burried in down votes, 
---
Have mine, partly for not being able to spell buried.
---
&gt; The marketing for the helmet edition promoted a canvas bag
---
Yawn.  Never give a sucker an even break.
---
&gt; There is ample evidence that came to light shortly after game release that the game was ment to be extremely microtranaction heavy, with loot boxes progression.
---
Great, you're going to blame Bethesda for things they *didn't* do.
---
&gt; This is currently being put through the legal process with a class action lawsuits against Bethesda, 
---
Citation needed.
---
&gt; Shortly after the games release, the amount of people that requested refunda was massive.
---
Massive means what?
---
&gt; Insert massive backlash and possibly legal issues and they we're forced to give refunds to just about everyone.
---
Were they?  What is your source for this?
---
&gt;  This is also part of that lawsuits so, again, I suggest you look into that. 
---
What lawsuits.  Where can we look?
---
&gt; I'm going to stop here, but basically the game released was far below the expectation of a AAA game
---
Of course it's an AAA game.  Using anti aircraft artillery is a vital part of some quests.
---
&gt; Internet historian did a ~~good video on it, fun and educational~~ *[ cheap cash grab]*.
---
confirmed..... 250 caps later...... collecting is collecting
---
Don't worry, I'm in the same situation as you. I see someone with like 50 plans for sale and they are in the Bog and I'm right near the Overseers camp? Well, I have a long walk ahead of me.
---
I want him to be my pet ! Who is a good boy :3
---
Lead and Steel are releatively common and easy to obtain, so most players aren't going to buy them.  Screws, Springs, Adhesive, Ballistic Fiber, Fiber Optics, Acid and Oil are the ones you should be selling.
---
My favorite look wise is probably the Enclave Officers outfit or the Sheepsquach skin outfit. I'm trying to get the Sheepsquach mascot head(because I have the body) and Sheepsquach skin outfit (because I have the head).
---
OOOOOHHHHH I hadn't even thought to check this yet! Thanks!
---
It blows my mind that people are still sniveling about duping.
---
I can't remember if its the Survivor or the Explorer...? The one with the green parka, but minus the hood? That also is a great colour match for the standard backpack :)
---
Buying a 60$ game and excepting unlimited free content forever is unreasonable they have to offset it some how the best bet is skins and cosmetics in atom shop
---
Oh wow guys didnt know that, I was struggling so much getting in and out from PA everytime... Thank you so much for the info and sorry for the bad explanation I gave. Cheers
---
impressive, I have a bridge you can sell
---
If the jar got bigger, I don't think he will fit in my punchbowl anymore
---
I really like how the bloodstained combat armor looks, so Ive  accumulated decent legendary heavy combat armor and slapped that paint on. I was surprised that you could put paint on the combat armor helmet as well, so it makes a pretty badass look.
---
I think it’s the explorer outfit!
---
Also, an option to at least 4x the font size.
---
Yep. Take turns who the lead man is, and on average everyone is cutting fast travel costs by 75% (with full team).
---
Alternatively, have the same person be lead man every time, with travel agent equipped, leaving rest of the team free to slot in more useful perks, everybody else can give the leader a few caps/bullets/stims or whatever to make up for one person paying for all the travel.
---
I have plenty of perk points saved up, so I'll try some different configurations now that I have a better idea of what I need to do.
---
Oh pipe wrench is a good addition to the engineer +1
---
Just invite randos to a team and do the challenges. It shouldn't be too hard
---
Black fisherman's outfit, fisherman's hat, black pipboy, and black backpack with shovel (the new one from the atom store).  I alternate between that, the Silver Shroud costume, and a black tuxedo with the White Wolf fedora.
---
I think my only request would be the ability to change the color of the Veil of Secrets.  I like to wear it to prevent disease, but it clashes with most costumes.
---
This ain't new
---
We definitely need more overarmor raider stuff 100%
---
I was about 5 yrs. old at the time.  It was one life lesson that I actually learned something from. Wish I could say the same about some of the others.
---
I think that’s part of what I’m loving about the “open market” right now. 
---
There was a huge discussion about pricing serums at under 400 I saw yesterday. I honestly don’t remember if it was here or elsewhere, or I’d link it. 
---
Person A makes serums and sells them cheap (200 caps apiece, I think?)  People were all “OMG WHY SELL SO CHEAP!?!” because vendors pay a minimum of 400, more if you’re perked etc. 
---
Person A was like 🤷🏼‍♀️. Because I can. Because I’m already at 25k caps. Go but mine, resell if you like and get yours.
---
Others were like “no one will but mine for 1000 if you sell yours so cheap!!”
---
I’m like - neat! Open Market Science!! This is an awesome discussion of what players “value.”   
---
Right now, I’ve decided I value Scrip. I try to get my 150 every day - however I can. I’m willing to pay up to 25 caps per Scrip, and this is the math for that. 😁  I’m not hurting for caps (thankfully) right now, and my stash space has at least a little bit of wiggle room.
---
ya I came across a little paper baggie at White springs, figured it was just plans or ammo... nope, a fully equipped and modded Ultracite power armor chassis. 
---
That was pretty exciting since I hadn't really used much PA until then.
---
problem now is that I have enough ultracite to repair it.
---
What are you using for a weapon? I primarily use a bloodied super sledge. Recently got a bloodied meat hook.
---
*tries to force it into the vender*
---
Because what you suggest isn't a thing. When you're on a team, if your "teammate" initiates/accepts PVP you are automatically in PVP by association.
---
Also, pacifist has never stopped you from being killed, it just stops you from doing damage to any player... even if you're in PVP. Before they removed slap damage, you being in pacifist mode didn't stop people from doing slap damage to you.
---
Finally "trying to bring them a solution" in a sarcastic I'm better than you style post is just a shitty way to go about it.
---
Peace :)
---
It looks really nice with the hunters long coat - the color matches pretty well
---
Well, you never see Super Mutant women... It's prison rules bitch! :D
---
You're probably right! Honestly, I lose track! Every time I think I have a new, absolute favourite attire they bring something out in the Atom Shop or I find some bloody hat that makes me want to change everything xD
---
Huh. I watched that again and discovered my character is sitting behind her.
---
Even with pacifist mode activated ?
---
If that's the case I was not aware of this.
---
Perks and mutations give you enough damage resistance to make you survivable if you can kill enemies quick enough. My unarmed melee builds can one shot most enemies in the game even without bloodied. Barbarian, evasive, ironclad, and scaly skin give enough DR to take quite a few hits from anything except supermutants with automatic weapons.
---
Hey, don't feel bad, I literally got a bloodied swing speed board yesterday
---
Travis was awesome in fo4, I loved hearing him as well as doing confidence man, and I also enjoyed when he mentioned things the sole survivor had done on the radio too.
---
I was as surprised as you were to see them in-game.  Up until that point, I thought the whole event was bugged.
---
It’s fantastic for out-of-combat activities. More charisma for buy/sell, more int for crafting, more luck for loot condition (and thus sell vale). My HW guy wears Unyielding +int/charisma gear and military fatigues (also in Casual group) because he fights in PA, and sells/crafts out of it.
---
I was hoping for 6k? That sound fair?
---
I happen to like cloaking wood armor :)
---
In this case though, it isn't on the 3* list - so you are safe.
---
Yep twice within the past week I tried and both times the rover was not even touched.  When the timer hit zero, failed on both.
---
If your CAMP is in a super popular place, it might be time to consider relocating? I found a nice spot with water, on Graham’s route that I’m only “conflicted” maybe 1-in-6 logins.
---
I know! Me too! I was rocking the winter jacket and jeans and my new backpack and that hair dropped and that backpack and I was like OH NO MY ATOMS!!! 
---
Honestly I love the outfits so much- we really need more raider type things or more creepy stuff like the cultist clothes
---
If only the turrets could actually kill stuff...
---
I'm glad it's 60 secs because after I saw 60 I said F that lol maybe next year
---
I too have a ridiculous number of these.  I was hoping that they'd end up as a small payout some day, but realizing that they're taking up a large percentage of my time updating my vendor list, I may just have a fire sale.
---
Too bad you can only list them one at a time, I'd love to see them grouped (though that would solve my initial problem).
---
I know as soon as I sell off the last of them, they'll announce that the next parade event has a completely new set of masks, and that the old ones are now unobtainable...
---
Absolutely unplayable, Bethesda plz fix
---
Welp broke ass me will not be getting any free teleports and time soon it seems
---
It's true you don't see many Super Mutant women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, that they are often mistaken for Mutant men.
---
And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no Super Mutant women, and that Mutants just spring out of holes in the ground!
---
Which is of course ridiculous
---
Which relay tower was it at?  I've had that happen at the one in the far southern area of the Savage Divide, but others have worked fine.
---
&gt; There was a lack of End-Game content sure
---
This I never got.  We're not at the end of the game, so how can there be end game content?
---
I think I bought one from you the other day xD
---
im a bloodied VATS rifle build...BE lever and lots of .45 and nothing stands in my way...I usually run at 30% HP and use perks like serendipity to avoid dmg. VATS is critical here.  need core assembly  on PA or AP refresh on non-PA. ActionBoy rank 3 is a must for me...with PA i add a VATS targeting matrix head.
---
PC has unlimited storage. There's no reason to limit it unless they decided to roll their own method for accessing files that would bog down when a large number of files are in a directory.
---
It's not easy being green
---
I love my NukaGirl, but also find delight in the Green Vintage Dress and Yellow Easter bonnet - while screaming like a banshee and swinging my axe. ❤️🤷🏼‍♀️
---
It could repair what you can and message you about what it can’t.
---
do you know if distant thunder is the only event that drops them? or is it just an event one happened to drop for you at?
---
There’s probably only a few available per region and if there’s space in one, you’ll be dropped there even if you’re looking for one you haven’t been in yet so you have better ping.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if it were only 5. They made like $100 million but insist they need to charge all that money for skins and add repair kits to keep the game going.
---
Also has +50% limb damage and +1 ag
---
Happened to me but just told me they wanted to trade junk, I grabbed what I could, he killed me with an assasin’s two shot explosive shotgun.
---
I was on pacifist.
---
The struggle is real!
---
I have to make myself hop off, whereas the game would usually decide for me with a hard lock or crash to dashboard.  Not so much anymore.  :(
---
yea, does bethesda honestly think that almost every player is gonna know all the answers? i think 90% of all players googled the answers
---
There’s already a mall in the mire! Would be awesome if we could use it
---
Great !
---
Yes, and being in pacifist keeps you from defending yourself
---
right now im a big fan of black overalls (AS, gone already) veil, sunglasses, and scribe hat.
---
hoping they bring out a scribe hat without attached goggles and a black tactical vest cosmetic (not underarmor)
---
I LOVE that the default is "no".  That helps the scrap spammers (such as myself) keep from obliterating the wrong things.
---
Yessss. I love the vintage dress too!  My sister got the easter bonnet I think, she seems to really like it as well as the Roadtripper!
---
Also, the **number of plans** should be the **number of unique plans.** There are people listing Mole Miners Gauntlets (#30) for 1,000 caps each, so their shop look more appealing to visit when viewed on the map for having 30-more plans.
---
Fomap76.com or mapalachia?
---
Yeah yeah yeah, parrot.
---
Yep, a big one. Like 2 weeks of a big 'buy these before they go' on the start screen big.
---
I already submitted feedback about this, makes sense to be top for our inventory and bottom for vendors.
---
My wife calls this game my crack addiction.  She's right.  I can't stop playing.  Up at 4 am play until 6 am, go to work, get home around 5 pm, play some more.  Play even more on the weekends.  I've been having a blast just fast traveling to all the camps and being completely amazed at the designs and level of detail put into each camp.  And I've discovered new areas doing this and I've been playing since launch.   One guy built his camp around a waterfall.  Amazing.
---
I'm still waiting for caits corset to come out, I wore it all through fallout 4

Yeah my friend was really excited for the aluminum outfit until it was under armor :/

And I know I would love the BOS Officer as a outfit because it’s cute af

If you’re around whitespring, it’s gonna be tough to find an open server. So many people moved there after the vending machines.

---
Because the whole point of their post is that this is an exploit that gets around you being in pacifist mode. Just like the old exploit where contesting a workshop you owned out you in combat, regardless of pacifist setting or how far you were from the workshop. 
---
The exploit being discussed here is that if someone on your team is in combat with another player, you automatically are too, regardless of pacifist setting. So Griefing Gary gets his friend to team up with you, then gets in combat with his friend, which opens you and your camp up to combat. 
---
Your suggestion to turn on pacifist doesn't prevent it, which is fine, but your post kinda came off a little condescending, which is probably why that other guy responded to you in a similar way.
---
All that precious Nuka world DLC stuff
---
 ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
Yes, we already have chalk
---
I usually sell those for like 20 caps at my store. I tend to price all the odds and ends like that pretty cheap so those players who don't know about them can get them easy- as a result I have tons of my space taken up by those kinds of things.
---
Don't understand those who charge 100+ though...that's just odd.
---
Try the Grafton train station vendor - got some BoS plans from there recently :)
---
Yes plz oml
---
I think we can safely say that Bethesda messed up the loot table for the deathclaw with patch 9.  Here's hoping they fix it in patch 9.5.
---
&gt; Because of the need for repair, I have to carry multiple weapons. 
---
You really shouldn't be needing this.
---
1. You do repair your weapons to 200%, don't you?
---
2. You have gunsmith 5 for your guns, the equivalent perk for your melee?
---
&gt; Because I chose shotguns, I have to grind plastic, which can take hours sometimes to really stock up,
---
I have a shotgun.  Every so often I hit Watoga High or Morgantown High for the plastic (over 100 in each place), but usually I don't need to, there's a a fair bit of plastic all over the world.
---
Yeah just started a new character - it's great - with all the player shops I can quickly traverse the map getting to zones faster (you can FT to a C.A.M.P. in an area you haven't explored yet).
---
Now I've already picked up some really hard to come by plans for very cheap. Kudos ladies and gentlemen!
---
I use the white New Years tux with the white wolf fedora or the regular New Years tux with the regular New Years fedora.
---
I wanna run the fallout mafia some day...
---
Archaeology is a lie because when you graduate you dont do the cool stuff that Indiana Jones did you dig in the dirt for a caveman tooth or read about peasant clothing of medieval Belarus.
---
Yeah I would appreciate that too - would be nice to have in black because black goes with everything or white because tattered field jacket needs alternatives to the awful wrapped cap
---
Thank you :)
---
Right.  It is stupid for Bethesda to make cool underarmor designs that get covered up.   It is doubly stupid to make them casual since casual cannot be made into a shielded version due to a game bug that has never been fixed.
---
A blackboard huh... ? *scratch nails on it*
---
Yes, there is a bug. There's a point in the mission right after he finishes repairs but before going inside that if he gets hit / killed the quest will bug and he won't continue inside and complete the quest. He will just wander around outside and fight the waves of enemies instead. There's always a spawn triggered right then too, so you have to kill that last spawn fast and don't let him take damage.
---
They want you to give them your milk of human kindness!
---
Aside from altruism, serums sales to players are cheaper than to robots because sales to other players are more desirable since they aren't limited by the robot vendor cap.
---
Welcome to every single Fallout game I’ve ever played.  Poor sleep sInce Fallout 1!!!

This ain't Alabama ( or Florida )

Thanks for the heads up. I was gonna purchase it tonight but no way I'm losing my sweet beard!
---
Maybe that's why he forgot to add it
---
Full set of assault marine armour (minus helmet), camo army underarmour, army helmet and camo bandana.
---
Pretty sure more than 120 are playing the game at any given time....
---
The game stability has been terrible sense that update. Trust me you’re not the only one dealing with the frustration right now.
---
Interesting conversion rate. Your rate results in a predetermined rate cost of 2500 caps for a 3 ⭐️ legendary weapon and 1500 caps cost for a 3 ⭐️ legendary armor. 
---
I, myself, predetermined that a random 3⭐️ legendary weapon should cost 2000 caps and a random 3⭐️ legendary armor should cost 1200 caps. Therefore, I set the price at my vendor at 20 caps per scrip. Each 1⭐️ legendary weapon I sell for 100 caps, while each 1⭐️ legendary armor sells for 60 caps. I set that price on any 1⭐️ legendary weapon or armor, regardless of the quality (with one exception for what I determined was a better quality 1⭐️ legendary weapon).
---
BTW, I am on PC.

Source?

Or you just think all police, firemen, ambulance workers and doctors are commie stooges?

Don't need to be on their team, just their friendlist to get on the same server.

I only have the 1st rank of the perk card. I know, I am trying to rebuild my perk cards, but levels come slow now and I have a lot of needs, I realized my build was fucked up at like level 75 and have been fixing it. I do have Gunsm5 though.

How can one run fill you up on plastic? Say you get 200 from both places, okay, that's 400 shells, plus maybe another 150 from Super duper. I can go through 550 shells in one queen battle or clear of West-tek (okay, maybe two clears). And I pick up every piece of plastic I see (and break down laser rifles and super sledges)and still constantly run out. Now, I only have a 1* two shot combat shotgun, but, I still am not doing enough damage that it doesn't take 5-6 shells per super mutant unless I get lucky with Bloody mess.
---
So much for playing as [the lord of bones](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=lord+of+bones+game+of+thrones) or [general kael](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=general+kael)
---
You can see all 3 when the owner is nearby.  If they're away doing things, you only see what's in the item name.
---
As a result, I will generally only sell 1 star items most of the time.  Seems like a waste to spend hours sitting at camp hoping someone comes by to shop.  Maybe if I spent the money to get an alt account, but then you have the issue of having to trade everything back and forth, or risk dropping things on the ground.
---
I'm sure it's just a bug that they want to fix, I just have no idea how easy or quick that fix could be.  SO, I'm not holding my breath.
---
The inventory needs to be much more granular in general, even if that results in more tabs to flip through. A hit worth taking, IMO.
---
Ahh I still need to get that coat!
---
Sent a message.  ^^'
---
Yeah, I don't even tell people about some of the battles I have had because they prolly wouldn't believe them.  It's hard to tell 3 scorchbeasts and their minions, a lvl. 91 Glowing Deathclaw, half the ghouls on bungalow row and 6 or 7 of the Whitespring robots to stop trying to kill you and pose for a picture.  My wife came in and stood behind me, watching all this and about halfway through it all, asked me if I could pause my game right quick and come help her get something down from the storage closet in the back bedroom.  I love my wife very much, so I said "Sure baby, just let me finish this one little thing here."
---
Not a dataminer but pretty shure it's not
---
I hope you find it! Honestly you might check at players vending machines! I have seen a few here and there - just don’t pay too much for it!
---
Obligatory “read that in MODUS’s voice”.
---
I keep finding the same plans over and over, its all common cooking recipes are basic stuff, I just want my raider plans
---
You're welcome although nobody is buying mine. Lol
---
There's been a bug lately, where it keeps trying to place you on the same world, and not on a new one. You have to quit FO76, and reenter.
---
this!
---
With Beijing Rose as the DJ.  (No relation to Raider Rose, until you discover later in the game that she's also a reprogrammed miss Nanny).
---
Easy solution, find a wife and then you automatically get reminders it's time to quit playing the game.
---
Automation!
---
I completed the badge requirement by being a conduit once, so it's likely that it's 60 seconds, not 6 times.
---
Can you not use that in PA? Not a melee user so I dont know.
---
what platform. I have 3 on ps4
---
Use fireproof perk for PA, does the same thing.
---
This one was in the forest region, near the border with ash heap and savage divide (just north of lewisburg)
---
I just sold an ivory handle I put in as a joke for 1000
---
Unarmed weapons cannot be used in PA, unfortunately.
---
I’m really hoping it’s available but you might be right sadly. I’ve seen no one else mention getting these paints.
---
The heyday of interior design.
---
We dropping Fissure Site Prime boi
---
Nah, we have the holotapes.
---
We can already listen to them whenever we want.
---
Fuck your laziness &amp; your crybaby radio anyhow!
---
Yeah mine too. I had a broken fence and a broken berry bush for which I was missing a repair berry. I did have the one wood for the fence though and it repaired it fine. The fucking berry bush is still broken though...
---
U mean like the same as in fo4?
---
Yes just the plain military green paint.
---
No, that's just what THEY want you to think.
---
Looks like BBQ-ready human. Hmmmm... human.
---
I'd say 2-3k on a good day at least
---
Just had to rebuild my camp from scratch because of this same reason. Total bullshit. Spent like 500 caps trying different spots and couldnt place it anywhere.... not even on the green at white spring which is totally flat.
---
People are saying it's not new but I can see it being used more to get around the new camp damage updates. It's just an exploit to force someone into PvP while in Adventure mode.
---
No pretty shure that's not available yet
---
From what I've been told and understand, the gist is that it does resemble West Virginia, squished into the shape of a square.  The actual state is a lot more diagonal.
---
There are a lot of asshole neckbeards who feel entitled to gatekeep what a “proper” Fallout game is supposed to be.
---
no kidding about the raider plans, saddly i do not think they exist
---
Gotcha. Makes sense due to the size of a PA hand.
---
Truth. It’s always kinda sad when I hit my cap limit at the vendor. I’m like”BUT I STILL HAVE ALL THIS PURIFIED WAAAAHH-TEERRR!!” 😂😂
---
Two handed weapons (fireaxe, grognax axe, sledge, pole hook, spear) do more per hit damage, but are generally slow(er) that one H weapons.
---
1H (machete, bowie/combat/switchblade knives, daggers, swords) do less damage per hit, but are generally faster - depending on perks and some other variables, may do more damage in the same time frame.
---
ex: a sledge (slow) may do 110 per hit, but only once every 2 seconds.
---
A fast switchblade may do 75 dmg, but in the same 2 second timespan, may hit 3 times...for 225 dmg total.
---
Gauntlets (mole miner, deahclaw, powerfist) can do 200+ per swing, but you cannot be in PA to use them.
---
You'll get better stuff as you level up - your weapon of choice will change.  As weapons lose effectiveness against stronger enemies, you have to change to keep up (and you'll find different weapons to be more effective against specific enemy types).
---
and 
---
You'll probably want to keep at least one semi-auto around - they come in handy for things like cargobots and SBs.
---
That’s a shame because X-01 has it so I don’t see why we can’t have the others yet.
---
Actually one of the things I liked about new Vegas was the story was about the world and your character was an excuse to go find the story, and influence which way it went. Now 76 being an mp game they can’t have your choices influence the story but they still write it that your character is influencing the game, it’s just set in stone how. But it also goes from the idea that the story is about the world and your character is a way to experience the story.
---
With how the weight exploit worked I honestly dont know. It could instantly kill you when exposed to rads, or make you invulnerable to them.
---
This is assuming that bsg still hasn't learned to handle negative numbers.
---
Amazing :D Gotta love the rag-doll physics ))
---
Grafton steel, and the Eastern Regional Penitentiary are both good options for lots of lower-level super mutants, who provide decent XP and won't completely murder your level 20 buddy.
---
Yeah I don’t know why it doesn’t work for others. My was once nuked and a pressed repair all and everything was repaired except my plants
---
Yeah, back in 3/NV unarmed with PA was stupid fun.
---
Bethesda: changes location a little.
---
Me: Let's nuke it
---
Hindsight is a great thing lol
---
Best.  Bug.  Ever.
---
Yeah saw somebody selling the skeleton mask for 499 caps. What a generous soul, altruism at its finest knocking off that one cap to make it a true deal. Makes me sad cause low levels who stumble across it might sink their entire early supply of hard earned caps thinking its a rare item
---
Absolutely.  If I'm paying that many Atoms for it, I want a choice.
---
Then you have ones like the Vintage Football Outfit which are classified as Underarmor, yet are never shown in the preview images as such.  There's a good reason for this.  It clips through pretty much every piece of armor you try to wear over it.
---
An opposite example is the VTU Track Suit.  The suit itself looks pretty cool, except for that stupid logo on the back.  So, that's one where I'm glad to have it as Underarmor.
---
My wife and I both play, and we both have shit sleep patterns.
---
I use to take 1 rad in water..with th hc pack i take 10
---
Hahaha exactly my thoughts xD I'd appreciate some source too
---
I was playing yesterday and did not experience this at all. I have both arms Stabilized ( bos combat ). 
---
Bummer you are not on xb1. I've got all ultracite pa plans for 100 caps per.
---
Looks like there's only 3 spawn points (wouldn't count enemy drops).

For most day-to-day stuff I typically run my Enclave forest armor with the matching undersuit, though I almost always wear a regular Gas Mask instead of the Enclave one. Sometimes I'll wear the Enclave officer uniform or a set of clean Army fatigues over the armor, or (less often) the Military Officer uniform from the Atom Shop. Other outfits I'll wear over the armor include the black Brotherhood Scribe Outfit or the Responders Police Uniform.
---
As for hair, I love the "Elegant" hairstyle but it doesn't feel quite right to have my hair down in most uniform-type outfits so I just stick with the "Wendy the Welder" most of the time.
---
Thats how i get Bethesdas attention
---
Seems they figured it out then. Shouldve been figured out from the begininning, but at least theyre learning.
---
That could potentially refrigerate so food doesn’t spoil too quickly
---
Ah, nice LOR reference!
---
Wow really? I found it like 3 times on accident while running from scorchbeasts at low levels
---
I'm not aware that the *plan* is available at all.  The mods used to sporadically show up at the inner Grafton vendor, but I haven't seen them since Patch 9.
---
Are you insane there is no playing from that point once the facial hair is gone.GAME OVER!
---
&gt; An option under 'Paint' like in ESO where I can make my armour invisible would be perfect for this.
---
Wouldn't that be bad for PvP? You can't accurately choose your target if you can't tell what armor types they have on.
---
There may be other BOS events that drop the armour pieces but I only remember one time doing distant thunder, seeing it drop and thinking “oh I didn’t know you could get t51 plans”  tbh I’ve maybe only done 2 or 3 distant thunders and a surface 2 air one just the once and I can’t remember what I got from surface 2 air. Sry I can’t be more help
---
that is pretty much what i meant
---
Whats the black fishermans outfit ? The one that was in as ?
---
I think thier DR is about 120.  
---
Takes 2 shots from a 110dmg sniper to take them out.  
---
First shot takes about 95%, 2nd shot does it.
---
Sneak/snipe with the same rifle one shots them.
---
Nice catch :)
---
(Added May 9) Repair: Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition no longer incorrectly provides an increase to some stats.
---
Dev Note: Condition should only affect how long an item lasts before it needs to be repaired. We found that overrepairing items resulted in small buffs to certain character stats, which was not intended. This was not originally noted during our initial patch notes process, but has been now added to the patch notes for clarity
---
Please inform yourself before commenting. You will save yourself the embarrassment.
---
I love fallout, I even know I'm sticking with this game for however long they've got it running... but Bethesda has never seemed embarrassed about anything they've done.
---
Uranium fever guarantees 3 legendaries in 10ish minutes for almost no effort, with a fair chance of at least one dropping a 3 star, and sometimes a fourth legendary on the way in. Even if they are only level 35/40, level doesn't matter when chipping then for scrip (not to mention a good roll 3 star level 40 weapon can be easily better than a level 50). One violent night is similar. Might not be guaranteed, but I don't think I've ever walked away without 3+ legendaries.
---
you think the raider vendors would have some or even the fact raider gear tends to be introductory gear even the power armor is made to start at a lower level but nope, can't find jack and I want to try a raider look
---
Sold mine for 12.000 caps. Had no idea it was worth that much but people were offering.
---
Think of what letters on frat houses look like. That’s the set. White and red I want to say. And if you do the drinking quest (sorry I forget the name) you get the plans. I wouldn’t buy these personally.
---
Mine makes a noise at me via WhatsApp around 8pm and that's the last I hear from her.  
---
I told her that video games were cheaper than other things but she didn't believe me, so we had an early night. And our final daughter is arriving in October.
---
Nobody is saying that. The launch Bethesda has only themselves to blame but the people complaining now about all kinds of nonsense that has been fixed already that is what I was addressing.
---
I'm dropping watoga

Hot water heater crapped out back in November.  I decided to install a tankless system to replace it.  It's about halfway done.
---
I have a camp in Cranberry Bog and nothing spawns near it.  I don't even have to worry about Scorchbeasts really.  I originally built it bullet proof by using the concrete foundation and campfire trick that was patched away but never really needed it.  I would like to move around and try new things, but I can't remake my pyramid cause they fixed campfire and foundation stacking.

How did you get it in weapon in the first place because I wanna know how you get it because that sounds amazing i would love to have that weapon for my little sister character she not confident in attacking that weapon would be great for her knowing it last till 50 Lvl she is  7 lvl PERFECT SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO GET IT
---
Is that the patriot paint?
---
try modding it up with hardend reciever etc, it will get quite respectable.
---
I managed too get the resolute veteran the other week. I love gattling guns and I’ve been using a 3 star vampiric one for a long time now. (Got it off a 3-star mr gutsy during a nuke run) idk what the challenges where for that week. But I somehow got them completed in adventure while in a team with some friends.
---
Only problem is the resolute veteran gattling gun sucked in comparison too my gattling and mine didn’t even have mods on it :/
---
I have Electrically charged and there is always some Bloodied Gauntlet build doing that and it never sets off PVP.
---
You backwards engineered my math exactly right. ❤️  Absolutely correct, nicely done!
---
Here’s the advantage for me - I’ve never actually paid these prices. They’re more to keep me in increased awareness of value if I’m crunched on time and just need to hit 150 before I log off.
---
I’ve been fortunate to find PLENTY of 3-star low level armor and weapons for as little as 100-150 caps apiece - if I’ve hit my “150 Scrip limit” and am still playing, then it becomes a game of “is this low enough price-per-Scrip-conversion” to make it worth making room in my stash box to sell tomorrow?
---
(Which I admit doing last night for a couple level 5 three star weapons at 59 caps each - Yay!!)
---
Yes, definitely. I'm hoping the hairstyles and those odd looking skull totems are the start of a more raider-like theme for releases.
---
I'm not living the Raider life or anything, but I love the cobbled together look of raider camps!
---
I dump mine in blue suitcases in railway stations. .along with ammo i dont use.
---
they still have a long way to go this isn't a no man's sky redemption yet, this game is at a state it should've been when it first came out.
---
Can you really do that anyway if we have cosmetic outfits? Doesn't seem like it would be much different.
---
#AH HA HA OH THATS HOT DAS HOT
---
So I am in a unique position here. I have hundreds of hours in Ark and Rust playing mainly solo. I am that guy that quietly builds his tower and then all of a sudden everybody fears getting close to it(at one point had close to 100 turrets in my base on Ark) I played about 150 hours of Fallout 4 without touching the main story. I will agree and say the grind is not for everyone but to me it's going to be a fun time.
---
I recently bought the X01 Military Paint from a player's vending machine, and I didn't know it existed. Where does it drop or spawn? Would like to farm and share the plans.
---
If you go into the build menu and go to wall decorations (I think they should be there under that tab) you can see them/preview them even though you can’t build them until you have the plan.
---
Ikr? On Xbox you can change the pipboy hud by hitting the double square button while viewing pipboy, but I'm not sure about anywhere else. It's MUCH better for chameleon build
---
Isn't it though?  Have a great day!
---
What level are you?
---
Agreed 
---
But I wold much rather be able to have the speakers work like radios in that you can tune it so that locally a specific station would play
---
Goes to party “I’ll only have one nuka shine”
---
You can't be revived from drowning.
---
Ah, you're using your shotgun exclusively.  I can see how you'd run low in ammo with that.  I usually only use my shotgun (Civil Unrest till last week, now a two shot combat shotgun like you) at close range, the Fixer or a hunting rifle at longer range.
---
I'm off to West-Tek tonight, I'll try and keep track of how much I use, but the only time I ever remember running out of ammo was in a Whitesprings nuke zone.
---
(The last Queen fight I was in (I don't do it very often) I used 1500 rounds of .50 cal from a good old-fashioned Browning M2.  Fun.)
---
Thank you! Definitely don't really want that lol.
---
Thanks! I tried poking around in there but I must have missed them.
---
Jesus lights 😂🤣😂
---
Hey man. Think you missed something. it's more like 0.0063% to get that exact one item you want if it's all random so I think it's better to just switch your builds around what you are offered or keep trading with other players until you get the item you want
---
You too
---
Cool well gl going forward
---
im cool with this as long as its realistic...anyone who walks through your camp with chalk can erase and write their own message...
---
Grahm doesn't have a route, he is a random encounter and can spawn all over the map. ;-)
---
Well, the nice part is, they are not done, not by a longshot. They keep coming out with these cool expansions that add to the game. So just when i get to my most bored, boom there is something new!
---
Also it looks priddy 😂
---
I wear a leather coat, can you tell me what armor i'm wearing underneath it now?
---
Also armor types don't matter in pvp, legendary effects and perks matter. And you cant see those.
---
with point 7, you failed to take into account that you can trade in the unwanted 3 star for 40 scrip.
---
so its 1.14 million total because you get 40% back after every attempt. thus 7600 days. or 20.8 years so we shaved of about 14 years. :P
---
personally i would have preferred it if it added a random legendary effect, or re-rolled an existing effect on a weapon. but since this random shit is what we got, i think they should have placed it into groups, slashing, bludgeoning, combat armor, wood armor, rifles, shotguns etc...
---
so let me go though my logic and how i think this should be used.
---
since i dont have a legendary weapon that i can use (anything for rifleman or commando vats build) ill be happy with almost anything that is a rifle. minus the pipe shit. so 6/44 then i have to miss all the shit prefixes and major and minor effects
---
8/23 for the prefix, or 9 if its the hunting rifle (instigating) that i would possibly like
---
5/7 for the major that i would be happy with
---
6/9 for the minor
---
so my chances are
---
13.6% to get a rifle
---
4.7% to get a rifle with a prefix 
---
3.4% to get a rifle with a prefix and major effect
---
2.3% to get a rifle with a prefix, major and minor effect 
---
so how do i most efficiently use my scrip? well because the major effects are pretty decent, there are prefixes that get added to my "happy with" list if they are paired together. for instance id be ok with +30% damage against super mutants if it is paired with an 25% increased fire rate (since it is an increase in dps). so thats a 6.4% chance for a weapon that i would accept. the cost is 50 scrip, and i get 15 back on each attempt.
---
it will theoretically require an average of 15.6 attempts, or 780 scrip, and since i get 30% back, the total expected scrip expenditure is 546.
---
this is back of the envelope calculations, in reality it is more complex because some combinations are better than others depending on what weapon they are on but it would not deviate too much so this is fine for a rough estimate.
---
this is how i think this should be used. not to get a specific weapon. but even if you want to use it like that, its still an extra roll for a 3 star item every once in a while. or if you are farming it hardcore, 1.5 times a day.
---
just to state again, i dont like it and prefer it to be a re-roll on existing items, but it is what it is. im just trying to make calculations to best utilize the shit that we got.
---
Yes, i've noticed that in November, last year. It's not really a secret. You discover that by exploring / doing objectives.
---
Hasn’t impacted me on PS4 aside from a slow initial load-in.
---
Ahhh that explains it. I read it on patch day, haven’t seen it since then.
---
Aww yeah its this one, thank you!
---
It would be awesome to have the radio plays mixed in with the music, even some advert "The all new and improved Chryslus Corvega, the freedom of the open road for only $87,000. Book your test drive today!"
---
Yeah same here- I’m more chaotic neutral than anything so idk of that would count for raiders but I love that look! There was an outfit that was datamined a while back that looked really neat so I hope we get that soon! 
---
And for sure- I’ve seen some really neat raider camps before!
---
You could also have sheet music that acted as a plan for new songs
---
He’s always been a legend
---
unless it got patched in 9, it would initiate PVP if the person hitting you is red, wanted.
---
I believe pacification mode disables this as well.
---
The diamond marker stopped happening for me in mid 30s level. Now I have to hope the compass marker stays. Thankfully I have a friend who's ability to find lost bags is bordering on uncanny, so that's helped lol

Can you kill Grahm?

I would have searched his wares and then clipped him to see what he dropped.

I believe it’s only from that event- if you are on Xbox I have an extra for you tho!

Makes it double disappointing when you read that you've been awarded the same recipe for the  10th time lol

Oh.  It's a team heavy one.  Bummer.

For me the best thing is people coming to visit my camp and visiting other peoples camps.

If this was a thing nobody would make their camp a store because nobody would spend camps fast traveling to it.

Modus in the production wing of the Enclave has it for sale along with all the plans for X-01 mods.
---
Yeah I was stompin around flatwoods and found a mailbox with a 10mm pistol, 200 or so ammo and some stimpaks. Being that I was lvl 3 using a pipe pistol it was like winning the sweepstakes.
---
It does for me on Xbox, great for when ur invis too, which sucked on fo4 the same.
---
Definitely, I can agree with that. It might have been better to start with that rather than calling it stupid and tedious.
---
My original build, i wanted to be a stealth sniper, and use the shotgun for up close. But as I progressed, what seemed to happen was i shoot at one enemy, do like 75% damage, then the whole place aggro'd on me. So I was using my "backup shotgun" almost the whole time after the first shot or two, unless I was fighting under leveled enemies. And with Rifles being around 20lbs, I finally just made the switch to full shotguns (at like 3 lbs each), But I had to redo all the perks I had in stealth rifle stuff. It is getting better. a lot of times I can down level 68 ghouls before they get to me if there are not to many, and with bloody mess perking, it really helps. Until I try to loot... damn it's hard to figure out which pieces still have loot in them when there is a pile.
---
Yes, especially loved trailing the story of the Firebreather recruits. Really excellent voice acting.
---
3 lbs is 1.36 kg
---
'Everything'
---
I’ll take your word for it .... Maybe I’m just super lucky then! 🍀I’m on a “main road” and near a workshop. I see Graham and sweet Chally near my camp much more often than I see them “in the wild.”
---
Happy pill
---
I’m on PS4. Can’t speak for all of us, but it definitely doesn’t work for me. 🤷‍♀️
---
&gt; Only problem is the resolute veteran gattling gun sucked in comparison too my gattling and mine didn’t even have mods on it :/
---
So trash it for that fine, fine scrip.  Maybe Purveyor Murmrgh will give you something better.
---
Next weeks challenge.
---
You can also earn them randomly from the dailies and the Campfire Tales event at camp Adams
---
Yesterday I traveled to someone's camp only to drop down a cliff. I didn't die but I didn't bother climbing up to the camp. Keep your stuff, I'm not that desperate.
---
Are you me? After the daylight savings time switch, I went from going to bed at 12-1 to 1-2. Like I told a friend last night, it's like I'm playing Civilization all over again. "Just one more turn." It was midnight last night before I was able to scrap, bulk, and sell enough of my junk that I could fast travel. Was able to finish off one badge before I had to go to bed and eventually, me and a friend had the entire server to ourselves. Guess everyone else was more responsible about going to bed on time than us.
---
this will be interesting!
---
That's kind of funny because I have a good half dozen Caps bobbleheads *if they havnt sold by now) but the only one I still need for the challenge is Luck.
---
Yep, although a lot of people are selling them, if your on Xbox I can chuck you one for free, I have 4 of them
---
Sold a few myself
---
It is ironic that much of the under armour looks better than many of the outfits lol.
---
Is there an outfit version of the bos camo under armour because that one looks awesome before you put armour over it.
---
I saw someone with the Enclave armor, all black with the circle of stars around the E, during beta. They were level 150+ during the first weeks. Not suspicious in and of itself, but I asked where they got it and the answer was a sketchy 'uhhhh ahhhh some event drop I think'.  You think?  I would have the date circled on the calendar. Dear diary, today I got Enclave paint for my PA. This was in the first month or so of beta, seems like. Wish I had been quicker to take a screenshot.
---
I assumed it was either a dev, or someone who glitched into the dev storage area without triggering any alarms. I wonder if that's what you just saw.
---
I have lvl 1, but cant squeeze more due to other perks I want.
---
Yea I was in white springs when the challenge magically completed itself.
---
Guess where my first stop was lol.
---
Ill be on about 6 hours from now since I don't know time zones etc, so you should see me on then :)
---
Mine's in a very remote place that you can't see from the road and I've had times when I've had to re-attemp like 4 times before the game would load it.  I can't believe there were people in that exact spot, that many times.  Makes me think the game tries repeatedly to load you back in the *same* server.
---
Now that you've brought up black boards, I want a billboard.  Don't know what'd I'd put on it, but I want one.
---
That'll keep those chem trails at bay!
---
Yeah it wouldn't be hard to implement given the existing systems in place could already be adapted
---
10K? Try 25-45K on PC.
---
I go days in between sales and then suddenly someone will come along and buy a lot. Someone bought a Fasnacht plan from me for 1000c last night. Someone else bought quite a few of the 50c plans I’ve received from defending workshops (I sell all plans at that price apart from a few super rare ones.) I figure that I just have to wait for the right person to come along, there’s someone out there who wants plans without having to do repetitive quests to get them.
---
So far the only thing I sell that is guaranteed to go within hours are recipes/plans from Biv. I had two copies of the Greek Letters set and someone bought both of them (certainly to resell at some stupid markup but I don’t care because it’s free caps and free space for me.) So I always do the Biv daily quest and am pretty happy when I get a recipe for something I already know.
---
I stop at every camp I am close to and buy any plans they have that I don’t know as long as the price isn’t crazy bananas.  Mostly I just want to buy 45 ammo because I hate grinding for supplies to make it. Shockingly few people sell it. But I will happily drop 1 c per bullet for 1000+ 45 ammo. I will fast travel to camps that show lots of ammo for sale out of the hope that they have 45.
---
This issue persists.  Still can't mod to Targeting HUD without a prefab (found/bought) mod.
---
Just spam inv on your server you can do them by yourself except for revive send a msg to who ever you get on team to jump from high point or get killed easy peasy I did while non of my friends were playing
---
Pistol grips will not apply Rifleman perks, one must craft a Forceful Stock (rifle stock) and that stock will benefit from both Gunslinger and Rifleman perks + Tank Killer, Bloody Mess, etc.
---
So ideally one should craft a Pipe Revolver-Rifle with a Hardened Receiver and a Forceful Stock with a Suppressor to reap the most rewards. Gun-fu rocks with this!
---
Yeah the listed cost for some of the camp plans are way too high most of these i list for around 50 caps.  Some weapon and armor plans ARE really useful and rare in which case they go for more than the listed cost. I feel like this is a fair approach,  good discount  on cosmetic plans but sometimes pay a bit more for plans that help you survive.
---
Yeah, I liked the Minutemen and all but they've got nothing on the Responders.
---
Just a tip if you're doing treasure maps - save up like 100 of them and team up with people. If you click on a mound while in a party with other people nearby, they also get loot.
---
If you see a wanted player close to you be careful
---
When all your shit is destroyed for the second time in 5 days by multiple SB’s while you were away, you start with stupid and tedious. 🤷‍♀️
---
I do, anyway.
---
I got a mouse that has a toggleable free-scroll on the scroll wheel. I can click a button and flick the scroll wheel and it'll keep spinning until it runs out of inertia. Really helps and you might look into one. Mine is the logitech g700s but I think that's discontinued. I'm sure there's others out there with the same feature.
---
BOS yes, just not dense for combat armor.  The dense plans are a mystery.
---
It was a drop I got from a legendary when I was a low level. Had to have been at WS when I was doing a quest that took you to the villages.  Can’t remember the quest but I do remember getting killed over and over by charred ghouls cause I was a low level.
---
Different eyepatches would be nice! We need more accessories like this to add more character
---
Yeah, I was hoping there would be roof access, at least as exit.
---
This game can blow my mind sometimes. 
---
Last night I was playing on PS4, looking around at shops, and thinking, "Damn there are a lot of ultrasite mods around tonight"
---
Yes, but RNG dependent. I did it 8 times, no badge
---
Scrip is a brilliant anchor for in game currency. Hadn’t thought about it like that before. Would def need fine tuning though.
---
T51 is my favorite too.
---
Thats fair for workbenches, but the metal bed is always on the overseer camp anyway.
---
Super mutants are hermaphrodites.
---
3 caps is too much. Ha!
---
For real? I didn't even know there *were* plans for anything but Excavator, Ultracite, and X-01. I'll have to get hunting, then.
---
I was trying to sell from stash so I don't know
---
They are supposedly making it so you can place items from your stash in the future. Not sure when though. It's been mentioned on inside the vault
---
The toxic waste barrels seem about right.  (I’m a smart-ass jerk and apologize but couldn’t resist.)
---
Life fact for those that don’t know. There are no Super Mutant women, or men for that matter. The virus that causes the mutation removes their reproductive organs entirely.
---
I'm richie Cunningham and this is my wife, oprah
---
Does the .50 Hunting Rifle actually deal more damage than .308 now?
---
fo4 went flat as a pancake after the main quest completed.
---
fo76  500hrs in, still dipping round the edges of the enclave.
---
SO many other things to do,if you take the time to do them,and a lot of it is enterwined.
---
havn't got even close to being bored with it
---
Well, here I go again looking like the weedy kid begging to hang around with the jocks...
---
Eh if you can't find it cheaper than tough.
---
Lead lined is not bugged. I had to read it.
---
I got super excited when I realized there was .45 plans for pipe pistols, because my one and only TSE is a pipe. Then I saw that they didn't actually improve damage and I was pretty bummed out.
---
IIRC, all of these caliber swap mods worked pretty well in FO4.  I wonder why they didn't get a clean carryover to 76.
---
Until a day or 2 ago when I finally got my hands on the hunters long coat I had mostly been wearing the ritual bindings outfit with civil war top hat and skull bandana since I first found it not long after the beta lol, but basically that with the spade backpack. I purchased the skull mask to complete the look of a voodoo wasteland witch doctor as I wanted to look like the guy that comes up out the grave in the bond film live and let die with the top hat and a white skull painted on his face. Unfortunately the skull mask clips through the top hat but if that ever gets fixed that will be the look I’m going for lol. Still collecting mr fuzzy tokens (il get there one day) and I love the Sheepsquatch mascot outfit and head so I wear that too when the mood takes me lol
---
My character is a tomboy who mostly goes with exposed armor, which is a bluish mishmash of things around a Marine Armor chest.  She wears a 76 Trucker Cap, Gridiron makeup, and no Underarmor.
---
If she's going into battle, then she wears the Marine Wetsuit and a Sentry Bot Helmet with that.
---
Her alternate outfit is Wildman Rags.
---
Wiat until you stumble across a legendary.  Those are tough.
---
I've run across a couple of them in the middle of nowhere Savage Divide.
---
Found another in the mire....fighting with mole miners, no less.
---
Or go to the tattoo shop, down in Biv's basement, some of the letters are on the wall.
---
Int increases exp, luck increases leg spawn rate, charisma increases group rewards.
---
Bomber Jacket and Flight Helmet are a really good match, and then Hunter's Long Coat and (I'll regret mentioning this ...) Traveler's Leather Coat with its own unique backpack plus Black Cowboy Hat.
---
I also love the Longshoreman outfit, but have yet to decide on fitting headwear.
---
I tried to spam the Campfire event last night and after the first two completions I didn't get any rewards or XP.  The event dinged as completed but I got nothing.  Not sure if its bugged or Bethesda secretly nerfed it to keep people from bypassing the challenges...
---
Fortunately no you monster.
---
When I looked the base level .50 was giving me the best damage (210), all the fancier ones were slightly worse.
---
I'll have another look tonight.
---
That’s where I got the ones classified as junk. This situation is some real BS.
---
I'm about to go to work and won't be on for about 10 hours from now. I live in the CDT, so that's about 6:40pm for me.
---
That's the port-a-diner. The eat-o-tronic is the wall mounted one that sometimes has moldy food inside.
---
I do it on the very rare chance of raider armor (not PA) plans. I got... sturdy raider arms I believe.. from it shortly after launch
---
100% agree, it'd be nice if we didn't have to pay for them though...
---
Yep. I did two runs of the Encrypted event last night because both times I was about to log off when I saw the event notification pop. I’m sleepy but I finally managed to revive someone for that Tadpole challenge AND I got some pretty awesome legendary armour/weapons that I actually want to keep. Totally worth it.
---
Thanks. That’s kinda what the husband and I were thinking when we started talking about it. Like ... what’s the “value” here? We started with asking ourselves :
---
“If it were in CAPS, what would you PAY for a random three star weapon, extrapolate that, knowing its 100 Scrip.”
---
And went from there...
---
Yes, no, maybe (I haven’t seen a clear proof/explanation of what that means.)
---
You get some photo challenges done.  Assuming you have a camera, of course.
---
Thank you I wasnt sure
---
it's on amazon for 30 bucks.
---
your prices sound right, I know your prices would be laughably cheap compared to prices on the external trading sites, but to be honest those markets are specialist as the majority of players won't go through all the hoops required to purchase stuff from them. 
---
Plus the majority of players don't have the caps some vendors are asking for items.
---
Hi There! I'm reading a lot of confusing information here so I'm going to relay my experience crafting these weapons.
---
A Pipe Revolver-Rifle with a Hardened Receiver and a Forceful Stock benefits from Both Gunslinger and Rifleman Perks as well as Gun-fu, Tank Killer, Tormentor etc.
---
This set up works with all Pipe varieties and can ALSO be crafted to use the Commando Perks with Gunslinger if one were to go fully Automatic. 
---
Personally I found the Pipe Revolver-Rifle to have the most stopping power in medium to close range.
---
There should be an automatic feature that bars sales if the cap limit is reached.
---
Yes!
---
Same!!
---
Thanks.
---
this is called the gamblers fallacy. its not understanding probability correctly. your chance of getting a bloodied weapon is 1/23. the chance of getting a bloodied weapon for your second legendary is... 1/23. and the third, 1/23.
---
the roll on the second is not dependent on the first. its the same if i flip a coin, falls heads... is the next flip guaranteed to be tails. nope. or notice that its not uncommon in lotto to have 2 numbers together like 16 and 17, or 31 and 32 to be drawn. but thats a different example because you are taking numbers out of the pool, but it works similar enough.
---
its not an even distribution, so some people will naturally get a certain effect more often. overall it evens out, but it requires a lot of samples.
---
Yeah that was pretty fun getting him into his first bar-fight 😂
---
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NEW VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I’m on PC, on the Canadian Amazon the cheapest for the pc standard edition is 60$
---
If you were to buy those Atoms in the shop, that's how much it would cost.
---
You can't anymore.  This was a side effect of how the Fix it Good perk used to buff stats on armor, in addition to over-repairing it past 100% condition.  You still get the condition bonus, but not the buff.
---
Thanks for those responses.  When I logged back in it was still showing the crazy amount but when I removed them this time it gave me the actual 24 in my personal inventory but still looks after 2 sign ins like the game thinks I have a couple hundred more in the stash which I think is just a UI bug since I can’t take them. Hoping it clears with the next update.
---
Check Walmart and the Microsoft store. I got mine for 20$
---
I bought them just so that I could be a Tri-Lam.  
---
Go Lambda Lamdba Lambda!
---
Yea that would be great, but he’s gotta say “damn all of u smoothskins!!” And always be high on Chems, 😂😂
---
You are not alone. The last update brought so many bugs and crashes it's incredible they are not doing anything about it.
---
On a related subject, has anybody figured out how to get Pi to stick the to the &amp;\*#\^$\* wall? When I can even place it the letter is floating like five feet out in the air.
---
Entomology only concerns insects ! but yeah
---
  I knew there was some reason I started collecting bears a couple months ago :)
---
Now the question is, do previously collected bears count?
---
Not correct :) I modded all varieties to benefit from both - it's all in the Receiver that's chosen.
---
Indubitably.
---
K well it does. Get an unyeilding set.
---
The thing about Sent/Cav/Ass is that by the time I learned about such a thing, I already had a couple pieces of Sent in my inventory.  I just wasn't aware that's what they were.  Since then, I've found a couple pieces of Sent and Cav just wandering around doing things.
---
It's an annoying thing to hunt down if you're actively hunting for it, but if you treat it as a surprise that might happen once a month, you'll probably have a set before you know it.
---
Did you feel attacked by my post ? If so I'm sorry it wasn't the point.
---
Anyway, I did not know that you could be engaged this way. Don't accept invites of people you don't trust, I guess.
---
What about those billboards in Watoga with rotating letters? Let us hook a terminal to those in our camp and change what they say.
---
Previous fallouts my favorite was the roving trader.... most realistic looking post apocalypse outfit in my opinion
---
Fallout 4 onwards I would use the harness outfit paired with the marine combat armor. I used macready's hat in 4 until I found that assaultron helmet. I also of course leave the arms bear. For 76 I swapped out the helmet for a cowboy hat and aviators
---
I've spent the last 10 level ups going from 1h melee to 10mm SMG, I've posted and had replies from BGS and still nothing. I totally got sick of doing no damage and re-did my build
---
I had to use a small one to get it to work
---
Wait..so you saying that you are sick of:
---
P....L...B (damn too soon, just let me delete this here you go) A....N.. (hmmm that is a bit off - should move it a little bit more lef...ohmagaaad pick the frickn letter not the shop yuch..ok good)...T...(oh boy - delete)...R (what the - delete...WHAT THE - NOT THE SHOP!!! I just stocked it up...TO HELL WITH IT)
---
Can't think of why...
---
Figure you can get a couple thousand for loaning it, that's a decent investment (as long as you get going before they fix it).
---
Future atomic shop content
---
oops my bad
---
Rifleman.
---
I would recommend moving camp and setting up in the forest or else you'll be constantly repairing. When people come to your shop, they'll also spawn enemies (which is an issue they should also fix).
---
Much appreciated.
---
Currently wearing the longshoreman outfit with the yellow slicker hat (pretty sure it's called that), the yellow atom shop backpack added last week. Might add the skull mask added yesterday to the look.
---
For sure!
---
you could bypass this dropping the frame. patched I guess?
---
Eh really
---
Personally I consider it a priority perk for PA as it stops scorchbeasts being a pain in the arse.
---
Yeah, if I was the one who said that, I was wrong.
---
I never tried buying something from the foreign site versions but can't you just buy it from the u.s. site? all it does is send you a code
---
A large geny worked for me
---
Atom store items, there are a couple of variants on there already. I’ve got the black backpack with the shovel and stuff. Looks really cool with the drifter coat.
---
I will enter the nuke zone with you Lord Beric! And we shall go forth with the rest of our Brothers!
---
Interesting. Then there's me, doing one or two sweeps of Whitesprings and having extras after cashing in 150 scrip. I will usually sell those extras to the WS station vendor or to the Bunker armory vendor, moreso now that I already maxed out on scrip. Dunno if vendor legendary sales price will fit into your hunting scheme, but be sure to check those places as well.
---
And I'll sometimes offer crap legendaries for zero caps in my camp, too.
---
Yup
---
I know some of them are going to be in atom store, hopefully not all of them. I can only hope some will be quest rewards and some might come from the last rank in pioneer scouts when it gets added. Noticing there isn't any Squirrel rank vending machines yet.
---
I sold a Fastnacht garland plan last night for 1000c. It had been listed for a week. I have a few masks listed for 1000c but so far no sales. At this point they are impossible to get otherwise and they take up almost no space in my stash so I’m not going to lower the price for now.
---
It clips something terrible through the civil war hat too, I’ve submitted a ticket so they are aware of that but they might not know about the disappearing beard, it’s also a lot dirtier looking that the atom shop photo shows so buyer beware.
---

&gt; cat skin makes the best Banjo heads, after all
---
Fat Freddy's cat is looking at a tramp sat on a stoop playing a violin.  The tramp says to Fat Freddy's cat: "Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast".  Fat Freddy's cat replies: "Maybe.  You do use nylon strings, right?"
---
Later on Fat Freddy's cat meets a raccoon.  Fat Freddy's cat asks him who he is.  The raccoon pulls out a silver bullet and says "Maybe this silver bullet will tell you".  The silver bullet says "He's the Lone Raccoon, stupid".
---
I'm on a roll, I can't stop.
---
Fat Freddy is reading a book about cats, it mentions that cats will often give dead mice and other small animals to their owners as symbolic gifts.  Fat Freddy says to his cat: "Don't you bring me any symbolic gifts, OK!".  Fat Freddy's cat looks crestfallen and slinks of to the cellar, saying to himself, "Oh, well, in that case I guess I'd better drink this bottle of 15 year old single malt I got for Fat Freddy's birthday".
---
I'll stop there before I get sued by Gilbert Shelton.
---
Yeah, I really miss the constant drops at WS and train stations. They are becoming rarer and rarer.
---
I sell mine for 50 caps because I’ve gotten so many of them. They can be fun.
---
Wait, there was a vendor bot in there?
---
[Strong liked that]
---
Charge for laziness is OK, it's charge for logistics
---
Charge for ignorance is NOT, it's robbing blind
---
Oh, that was you I kited the 20 glowing ghouls into?  Sorry.
---
Lol what.. just pay attention to it &amp; go buy random shit from vendors if it comes to it.. why would BSG block sales because you aren’t looking at your caps😂
---
And it's still too many buttons and clicks to see scout badge progress.

Bethesda, why did you repair X before Y?! This is so stupid. It shouldn’t repair at all if I don’t have enough components so I can choose what to repair first!

I have 34 luck on my sniper. What’s your proof? (I assume your comment is about luck and legendaries).
---
Because when I'm on the other side of the map doing quests, I shouldn't have to play money manager in the midst of a SBQ battle.
---
I wonder if everything has a legendary chance, maybe just a super slim one
---
I’ve had trouble getting it to register if I’m moving at all when taking the picture. I have to be absolutely still for it to work.
---
Also, one night randomly nothing I took pictures of was registering. It had worked the night before and it worked the next night. Might have just needed to restart the game, might have been truly random, I’m not sure.
---
New Colossus is good so far. Been playing through it actually. Also, gibe Blazco jacket and DoomSlayer armor in atomic shop.

How in the hell do you trigger it?

Why do you have an apostrophe in strangers?
---
When it was the fourth bullseye, that hurt, not gonna lie...  thought I was gonna make it.
---
Can I get in on that action later today?  I'll make it worth your trouble :)
---
I tried every generator I could find, big and small, and nothing worked until I snapped a pic of a windmill generator from the bottom looking up.
---
Cdkey stores are your best bet of getting it cheapest i think. There are lots of them and prices vary alot. Don't know North America region prices but i bought my eu ones (3 accounts)  with 8e each.
---
Is it bad that I laughed at this?  Maybe she was scraping her current legendary lvl 5 Stalkers Rolling Pin? :(
---
He has a route for each of those spawn locations (though some could be 'combined', I haven't seen anything mapped for him).  Sitting on one of those routes won't guarantee he'll show up, but if you find him in a particular location, he will show up there again at some point.
---
Wait, AA alone gives you flatout 28.9% damage boost? If so AAE and everything starting with AA is inferior to TSE? Well AAE is 53,9% damage boost total and TSE is 25%+20%+20%, because TS is triggering explosive twice.
---
Ooooh ok. I see the workaround they are using. That's a lazy implementation...
---
I think Bethesda did that to prevent a invulnerable mate in pacifist mode healing his pvp mate by spamming stimpacks or reviving him indefinitely.
---
But as always, that's lazy af. The logical course of action should be to not propagate pvp flag, but if the pacifist guy interacts in any way with his pvp mate THEN propagate the flag.
---
But hey that's far more complicated to implement so fuck it !
---
Include New Vegas or be crucified. Degenerate.
---
"Im sorry. That would put the seller over the cap limit. Purchaise denied" not a great experience.
---
This sounds like a you problem not a me problem.
---
If you expect items to sell when you are near the cap limit either remove the popular items from your store or even better spend your caps at another players store for something that you might be short on or fancy
---
Blunt is like a board, rolling pin or security baton. Improvised I think is the protest signs but I’m not too sure
---
I’m not completely sure, it depends on if the code is region locked to the U.S. or all of North America.
---
Having all serums isnt being a duper lol, theyre not hard to make for people who dedicate to it
---
I saw a hero selling egghead serums at 220 and had a sign saying BUY THEM TO RESELL on the store XD
---
Exacly. My female character does not have a beard so I've never been able to play the game. Is it any good?
---
If our vending machines banked the caps gained that would solve the issue.
---
Honestly I don't know, I'm not even sure if I made that change or the phone did!
---
I’ve been wearing a decent set of legendary Vangaurd/Chameleon Marine armor with a Bowler/BOS camouflage outfit, gentlemanly yet ready for the S—t to hit the fan.
---
That should stay forever.
---
He deserves it after all those miles and days.
---
I probably lost a good 5-6k because of this. A player went HAM at my vending machines the other day and I couldn't travel fast enough to other camps to find things to buy. Anymore when I get close to max caps, say 23.5k, I just go and shut 'er down until I get low enough. If someone finds my camp, then they can still buy stuff. Can't do anything about that. Just not being advertised to everyone will help alleviate the chance of hitting max.
---
If you don't know, you can now buy the plans for the mods. It's at the production vendor station and not the war room where the mods are sold.
---
Plans are free at my camp! They don't last long though. I started out with around 30 and now there's just a few left.
---
oh yeh there still there. less than trivial mostly.but still objects in mid air,bots not responding,game crash,quest markers in wrong place. all the little bugs in fo3/4 are still there.
---
but one does learn to live with them and happily co-exist.
---
personally, i blame the radiation glitching my harddrive
---
i think it actually means your stash was full, you didint have to delete those things, jsut free up some space in your stash
---
if you still get that message, restart the game, and it should be fixed hopefully
---
good luck!
---
I was gonna say it could be a bug because certain outfits have been appearing under my armor since the last patch, but the other comments indicate that it is indeed underarmor. Seems counterintuitive to make a detailed outfit and then have it be covered up...
---
I buy all 45 I see for 1 cap.  If you had a few thousand 45 for 1 cap each I would buy them all. At 2 caps each I might buy some (no more than 1000) depending on how close to the cap ceiling I was. So far I haven’t seen a lot of people selling 45 and 2/3 of the ones that have it price it at 2c, which feels like too much when I want to buy 1000+.
---
Sounds like you need a calculator.
---
Yes, because fuck games with good story.
---
An encounter spawn point might be close to your camp. But I forgot to mention that Grahm *does* indeed start to travel once spawned, especially if you follow him around, so he is pretty unique.
---
No issues here... but man I couldn’t aim for ANYTHING at number four. Seriously took way more time and bolts than I expected!
---
Too stupid, didn't listen.
---
I would love for a Chinese faction to be introduced into the game, so then I can fight some COMMIE SCUM
---
They will not ban people simply for having those plans.  But I would avoid exploiting the known bug that you are very aware of.  You know that’s the right choice.
---
I'd like to know where this is for uh scientific research
---
G2a?
---
Microsoft store is still selling at 79.99 for me, and I can only find console versions on the Walmart site.
---
Improvised *should* be something that performs a primary function that does not involve killing people.  The rolling pin, pipe wrench, protest signs, regular sledge, etc.  Knowing Beth, it could actually be anything.
---
Check your internet connectivity. Old networking gear? WiFi or Ethernet?
---
Power leveling is already a thing, I would rather stop punishing everyone else when this already happens all the time personally. And yeah it does suck when you have a mob just hitting you while you wait for your team to hit it.
---
Our Heroes :) I bought 3 replacement serums yesterday for 450 each, I'm so happy when vendors do this, they are affordable and if I see them again I'll always go and see if they have more so I can have some spares.
---
556 and shells are most popular right now. But if you're looking to sell 1:1 you're basically every other guy.
---
Since you can farm for materials, why not just do bulk ammo sales with 1k rounds for 750 caps and sell by volume with slightly lower price.
---
I can get behind this. I had about 2K caps shy and was not expecting someone to buy 3 hunter’s long-coats and 2 Mr Fuzzy outfits. Sure enough lost over 1200 caps into thin air.
---
I know I spotted the X01 jetpack but didn't have enough caps.
---
That would also be really cool
---
&gt; It would also be nice to be able to rejoin a server when I crash.
---
Pester people in the game to be your friends.  Join servers your "friends" are on.  If you're thrown off the server rejoin the same server as your "friend".
---
However, it's possible that it was the server that crashed, not you, and there is nothing to rejoin.
---
Hopefully they fix this when they introduce the Purveyour tomorrow. I keep a smg on me for the campfire event because of this.
---
Its godroll worth 50k, QFirerate best possible tesla
---
Good point, i too would like a huge customisable billboard
---
Having one wouldn't be a problem, anyone who buys the plan is holding one.
---
Trading it to other players, especially if you're trading it for caps and then trading it back, could easily be considered abusing a bug.  Whether they can track that, and are willing to do something about it, is another question.
---
I have one, and I've considered just selling it outright, but haven't really decided that's something I want to risk doing at this point.  I don't think it would cause a problem, but I've got quite a bit invested right now and I don't know if I'm willing to bet a few thousand caps on my character's continued existence.
---
The CD keys for North America are crazy expensive with the chance of getting a ban. Are they strict on using a VPN to enter the code? I could in theory but a European key and activate it using a VPN set to Europe.
---
Id like it if they gave us the option to enable the servers to not place you in a world if your CAMP cannot be placed, im ok with waiting a bit longer at  load screen if it means the game is looking for a world where my base CAN be loaded
---
Seems fair
---
I'm going to throw June 25th into the hat.
---
My guess is because players have to "see" your items. Even though there's no graphic for them, it probably helps with server stability. I really don't like it either though. 😔
---
This is unnecessary,  get better eyes or t.v. perhaps adjust ur picture or ur prescription.
---
I’ve got all the bos plans just no dense
---
Cap on scrip is 1000 just fyi
---
please dont hurt for not knowing but wouldnt archaeologists  work with humans fossils or since they work with human remains so can someone clear this up for me
---
I noticed some things with my brick CAMP. The edges of walls are constantly flickering when connecting to another wall/roof at a 45 degree angle because the game doesn't know which side of the wall to show. So its just constantly re-texturing. Is this what people are talking about? Are the people also having these issues on PC?
---
If I was to go buy I CD key it probably wouldn’t be G2A but it would have to be a out of region key. I may have to use a VPN to activate the code but I’m not sure how strict they are around banning people for that
---
Mind = blown. You're a hero among nerds
---
I actually ended up having to move away from the White Springs. All these nonlocals with their specialization shops has made it difficult to live for us locals.
---
It isn't an issue of laziness, people can actively be in a fight and still not land a hit for many reasons, not the least of which is their melee teammates blocking the shot.
---
Those people still took part in the fight, XP from an RPG perspective isn't just about what you kill and the abstraction can absolutely be applied to people who were present but didn't physically harm the target.
---
Thank you kind strange is ..???..what I have to know!!! What is strange
---
I had one when i became possum. Not sure if it was because of the quest or just the default.
---
I have since completed 1 camprire event. 2 bug repelants and 3 toxic waste quests. Didnt get a single one.
---
However i have heard that its a chance. And the idea that there is more total badges required to buy all the items than there are to be earned from the challenges requires another avenue of obtaining them.
---
Iirc Arktos Pharma dungeon is supposed to be part of Wild Appalachia. Could be wrong though.
---
I've experienced this with 670/800 stash weight and the item IN stash, had to go delete a few things from stored before I could list. Horseshit.
---
As a heavy weapon, it should benefit from heavy weapons perks. I picked up a suppressors explosive flamer from a vending machine for 10K. Quite a steal in my opinion, considering it's both legacy explosive and allows me to heal allies while reducing enemy damage by 20%. I'm curious if the explosive effect will make it heal in an aoe.
---
Not true. My CAMP is near full budget, having all four completely stocked did not raise my camp budget, nor did I get any kind of warning that I was at the limit.
---
get out of hair!
---
Kind of weird to claim that "game crash" is a "bug that was from Fallout 4".  Fallout 4 was not the only computer program to crash you know.
---
What do you mean by "bots not responding"?
---
Definately suggest doing it in daylight.  One of my tries I had the same problem, and I literally could not see the rings.
---
And then it crashed when I got it.  Ffffff
---
I mean it is the top class in the game by a lot atm.
---
It deserves a few bugs LOL
---
Sorry I didn’t have better news for you. We suffer together.
---
I haven’t done a single possum challenge and I have 7 - already spent 5 on a backpack mod- just from server hopping the Campfire Tales - I like I said it’s random and you don’t get one every time
---
Bethesda doesn't either.
---
They know. Their entire method of storytelling in this game relies on the same kinds of thinking Archaeologists do. Like most of the game it’s more about what a retro futuristic society thinks something is than its literal real world counterpart. Thus the very pulpy-gentleman adventurer idea of an archaeologist. 
---
But honestly, the majority of this game is archaeology and history as we piece together the story of a destroyed civilization based on artifacts left behind by the people.
---
All of the released underarmours are in the Casual category, which has been bugged since launch. At this point this is definitely a purposeful act on Bethesda's part :-p
---
Had that happen once.  Worked the next time I did it.
---
Check player vendors. I got mine for 50 caps. Thats worth a good few hours of grinding
---
I do get that I really do. It's just that I would never ever pay real money for anything on that shop.  Skins and that sort of stuff does not interest me in the slightest.
---
Everything I've purchased(which isnt much) from there is stuff for my camp and that was from the free Atoms I've received from playing the game. 
---
 I would love to help the game but I don't wanna buy things I will never use or don't care about.
---
I'm pretty sure that the 2 dailies have a chance at badges (Bug collection @ Dolly Sods, and Waste cleanup @ Kiddies Corner). . . But they may be tadpole, and not possum. Not real sure on that part.
---
I don’t feel embarrassed. Why would I feel embarrassed?
---
5.56 and shotgun shells, nothing else will sell in my experience, at least on PC. Alternatively, bulk that lead and sell it to me =)
---
\&gt;  We get 0% VATS chance against flying enemies
---
This stands to reason - you can't hit a SB, vertibird, or cargobot at altitude 100' when you are armed with a switchblade...I keep have an auto/semi-auto around for those things.
---
Stingwings, bees, bloatflies, etc....eh.  vats not required.  Just go get 'em.
---
It's just him showing what he really is. An absolute legend
---
I use a level 35 bloodied gauss (non explosive). I can hit around 620 at very low health using adrenal reaction mutation. All rifleman perks.
---
No Issues, I went for 100% Hit rate on my attempt, even the wife past on her 2nd try.
---
Considering it took me over 6 hours to complete 2.... i think your method is faster :)
---
I guess some people don't feel embarrassed when they say ridiculous things, yeah.
---
The 2 dailys bug parts and mutigenic waste, also have the \~25% chance to award a badge. The only one not restricted to once every 20/24 hours is the campfire tales @Camp Adams.
---
only 1 event with badges, campfiretales, the 2 dailles can give possum, no tadpole. the event can only give possum too.
---
Much faster
---
I didn’t say there wasn’t. If all the regions servers are full a player would be placed into a server in a different region, with the lowest ping.
---
And if I log out and then immediately log back in, chances are I’ll get dumped right back into the server I was in because the spot wasn’t taken yet, or into another server I’ve already been in because someone just left that server. Everyone’s server hopping even more with the vendors release. Think man. Thinking is free, make use of that.
---
Entirely this, the game message is miss-leading it's your Stash that is full, not CAMP budget
---
Oh yeah, it’s the main thing I look for at vendor or player vendor but have yet to see it. Damn shame all the ~~dupers~~ entrepreneurs out there hadn’t been on the case...
---
I Use one Bloodied gauss +25% fire rate, it does 650+ with 20% health
---
Clearly I am the only person who thought the same as you...
---
How long does the fall take though? I've thought about getting it but I already have a ton of mutations so I don't want to get it and then hate it.
---
I guess so but that doesn’t have anything to do with me. Read my post again and read my second one if it still manages to pass through both ears.
---
That’s massive damage output. I have an instigating explosive with all rifleman and 2x demolition and output is only around 280. Not home right now to double check but with your 2 shot damage it makes sense. I like instigating for double damage and I’m long range VATS so two shot isn’t as attractive to me, but if I had your gun I could change my ways.
---
No.
---
"Chef's surprise"
---
You might be a Disney princess.
---
I've been selling plans like gangbusters.  Maybe it's because I'm just barely north of Watoga, so low-level players fast travel over to get to the Cranberry Bog and they need plans when they check out my base.
---
Bethesdaaaaa! Your game is brokennnnn!
---
Nothing illegal about using them. If they were, Game companies would have sued these shops long ago. But they are on grey area :) I don't think its a good idea to use VPN to change region like that with games. Could work thought.. Don't know.
---
Aw fuck if this is true i might have to change my flair, i ain't no damn commie lol
---
That was the best fucking weekend of my life. Me and my little brother played allll weekend. We hit up nukezones, White Springs, The burrows, just went nuts.
---
If you are making signs with that many letters, rest assured that you have probably saved time - as you can't have that much budget left to build a house....
---
Nope, it uses build space. I got the exact same issue as OP. When I add items to sell on my vendor, it takes up build space. Had to delete some decorations.
---
That's nothing. I came across a guy who was selling, iirc, armour/outfits for 1000 caps. But if you hover over the item, the info about it said its value was 83 caps.
---
Or..... shut down shop when you're near max caps... maybe move some caps to a mule or go on a spending spree.... you know common sense math related answers. 
---
Lock your shop literally build a building around it power down the machine and lock the door.
---
Last thing I want is a "seller is at max caps purchase failed" 
---
Especially when it should say "Seller sucks at math and helped get rid of 24000 caps from the game"
---
And the reverse!  I want to armour up the spacesuit
---
Welcome to life in a tourists’ hotspot lol
---
that would be one hell of a fight...
---
haha... No, I didn't feel attacked, I was just returning the sarcastic tone.
---
how do you know he was duping? i have 4 machines totally full of great stuff, i have just grinded whitesprings and the burrows and westtec over and over
---
the only way id be truly suspicious is if he had more than one of each weapon/armor 
---
if he just had one of each, how do you know he is duping?
---
Iguana on a stick lol
---
If superman can wear his Y-fronts over his tights, why not a survivor of a nuclear appocalypse.
---
Am I missing something? Aren't those mutant hounds?
---
Make sure you don't kill them, otherwise the option doesn't appear.
---
I did this with a random, we both took off all our armor and let ourselves get downed by a regular mirelurk. The option appeared the first time we tried.
---
Vats should work like it’s supposed to, no worries if it’s not your gameplay style. It used to work most of the time on close flying bugs - now it never does. 
---
 I agree with op that the campfire thing is very difficult to someone who uses melee &amp; vats.
---
That's not what the rest of the replies I've gotten in this thread have said lol. Theyve mosTLy been along the lines of "WELL IF THEY FUCKED UP THAT HOW DO I KNOW PEOPLE ONLINE CANT JUST SEE MY CREDIT CARD INFO"
---
Yep.  I don't know if it's still in the store, but it's a reskin of the regular one, just black.
---
I can't get the pictures of the slide or wave to work.
---
i always bust out the telsa rifle for group events so everyone gets a chance to get a hit in
---
I'm also interested in your source on this. I've heard people say it about the legendary spawns and rewards but I haven't seen anyone provide proof.
---
This is mostly due to doing too much dps. I never had an issue with my 1\* bloodied .50 cal not being able to kill enemies, but when I upgraded to a 2\* B25 .50 cal, they started going immune at a sliver of health left. Switching to my gatling gun and killing 1 enemy fixes the issue until it happens again. I think the server caps you on how much dps you can do  for some stupid reason.
---
FWIW, after having my B25 .50 cal for a few days, the problem went away. It only was happening on the first day of using it.
---
Having the same  issue. I was trying to move mine because I didn't like the placement. Cannot move -  “one or more related items are in use” . Still blows up though.
---
Sorry, if I wanted to read stupid things I would go to kotaku or something.
---
Guess I’m going shopping today. Hell of a time doing campfire with the broken melee/vats thing.
---
If you get them, not all of the letters work for English words, and not all of the modern alphabet is there. 
---
Find an online anagram generator and look for anagrams of A B E Z H I K M N O P T Y. I used them to name my pirate ship camp the "Apex Enemity".
---
They seem to be releasing 1 every week, which is completely stupid.
---
&gt;"Im sorry. That would put the seller over the cap limit. Purchaise denied" not a great experience.
---
It's a better experience than losing 3,000 caps to a series of sales before I could even react to it.
---
Up until two weeks ago
---
Lvl 5 pvp king
---
What is scrip? Caps and atoms are obvious, but I don't understand the scrip
---
It's the griefers doing that.
---
Came across these two fighting the other day. The Mirelurk Queen DOMINATED the scorchbeast.
---
Yes, I am talking to the scout robot, but I still need to find the source of the noise.
---
I loved the silver shroud radio series channel in FO4, and The Who Goes There? holotapes are great. Getting a Cryptid ghost story station would be fantastic.
---
Nice. I would love to see a Deathclaw and Sheepsquatch go at it.
---
The first couple pictures would be perfect for wall posters IRL. Just saying lol
---
First, don't carry any junk with you since you'll likely die at least once.  The boys is invincible until all three pylons are activated (a message will pop up nothing it is vulnerable). Anyone who activates them starts taking damage, gotta keep popping stims. If the boss is chasing you, don't run like crazy since then it's hard to target for other players... just sidestep around it in a circle. 
---
Most players are experienced enough to do the fight without too much trouble and most of the server will gather when they see thr notification.
---
I don't keep notes..
---
Sadly, it's your Nukshine paint on your PA (Power Armor).  You have to repaint your PA to get rid of it if you don't want to turn down your sound.
---
I painted my T-51b and X-01 suits with Nukashine paint and just changed both to the Pale Rider paint.  The sound is gone now.  I'm not 100% sure if the sound is only on X-01 PA with Nukashine paint or if it's on all PA with that paint scheme.
---
I believe they stack the chance and the cooldown remains the same. Every time I got down wearing two LS pieces, I got up. I basically made an undownable build with two LS pieces and full Mysterious Savoir. I could be wrong, though.
---
How will that help when any combination of multiple sales might take me over the limit?
---
That sounds like me yesterday, except the queen bugged out and flew to Watoga and we couldn't drop her.  There went all the ammo I made after my trip to lucky hole mine for nothing.
---
Why wouldn't they though? They work with everything....
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  That's stone cold.
---
The negative press was deserved to some degree. A lot of people actually stopped playing and this sub is full of people like me who are fairly new (been playing 10 weeks) or the people who stuck it out during the hard times. The game use to be a mess and Bethesda IMHO treated their fans unfairly. There were blatant lies. 
---
Having said that, this game is the most fun Fallout I've ever played. I play nearly everyday and I love it. They really have put a lot of hard work into ironing the issues out and adding new content.
---
Ah those daily challenges have a chance of getting badges?
---
I believe they are all separate with their own cool down. But personally have not tested this only read.
---
Couple days ago. Got to the point where I was ready to have a teammate sit on the roof with a sniper scope as a “spotter” to tell me if I was high or low or whatever 🙄
---
Or maybe add where your able to draw things like in rust. *Draws smug Pepe face*
---
Well, good for a new alt starting.
---
Not until they introduce the dwarven female character model, then you and your beard will be all set.
---
I'll let you know.
---
Yea, I hadn't consider it might be the server crashing and not me.
---
Are you saying I should get 76? 
---
Cause man am I enjoying playing diablo 2 again.
---
The only time-sensitive part of Wild Appalachia was the Fasnacht Parade, which ended quite a while ago (and will presumably come back next year). The rest of it will ostensibly remain in the game as long as there's a game.
---
Instigating is by far the superior pick for a gauss rifle.
---
Other than the black powder rifles this is the slowest rifle. You need the highest initial damage possible so your target will die in one shot. So it can't catch you offguard while you're reloading. Your initial shot will have about 514 damage. This is even higher than a bloodied gauss (502 at 5%hp).
---
Now here are a couple of reasons why a Two-shot gauss is actually bad: The accuracy is terrible, it's unusable with vats for 2 reasons: 1. Two-shot + vats sucks, 2. Charging the gun before entering vats will make it miss, then there's this bit:
---
&gt; The projectile fired is wider than other ballistic bullets and will not be able to pass through some railings and other small spaces. 
---
This makes a two-shot even more finicky. 
---
Gauss is also a pretty meh weapon due to the sheer weight you need to dedicate. 20pounds just for the gun+fuckton of weight for ammo...
---
If you're out just for maximum pure damage,(5%HP, Adrenal reaction, 60% weapon boost, explosive weapon+demo5, nerd rage 3, adrenaline5) no chems the ranking will be:
---
1. Instigating: 1596 initial shot + 798 everything else
---
2. Bloodied: 1556
---
3. Executioner @ under 40%hp mob: 1197
---
4. Mob type 30% boost: 1037
---
5. Two shot: 996
---
My pick will always be instigating. I have no intention of bringing a gauss to a sbq/any other boss fight so the sustained damage won't matter, but if it does matter for you bloodied is always nice.
---
Agreed. This is my thought process every time I log on. Gotta change servers five times before I can have my camp
---
i bought mine at Watoga station, the plans are there but its rare. I've only seen them once so far, i think the Grafton station bot can sell them too since ive seen other dense plans there
---
Add up the total cost of everthing in your machines. If it brings you over 25K remove items or take a chance at losing caps.
---
Instigating mole miner and swap for AA Deathclaw both 1*
---
I use a 1* furious (extra damage per each consecutive shot. 
---
I think the base damage is 230, with max rifleman. It absolutely melts high HP mobs once you get going.
---
Also, I accepted your request.
---
Yup. Dont know what the chance is or if a pitty timer exists, but it has been confirmed by many players.
---
I only have a sample size of 6 completions and didnt get any si its not much to go on, i might have simply been unlucky.
---
I think think they could have been more inventive &amp; creative with it - compared to the previous three and even the bloody raider set - to me at least it looks like Yet Another Quick Reskin.
---
I have an AA that I don't use at the moment due to grounded mutation.
---
Adjusting how Travel Agent works (e.g. Bodyguards) we could totally have that with least amount of change or complications.
---
Bethesda wants to flush caps though so i don't see that happening any time soon
---
Right on! I usually am on from like 10-12 (EST) each day, with some stuff happening in the weekends. I'm lvl 13 right now.
---
For the slide we both stood at the other end of the pool, and the label came up.
---
For the Wave, we stood opposite the deepend and out of the "pool" and the Label came up, I even think my wife was in and labelled in my shot.
---
I do the same thing if the marine helmet was in the game I'd wear that armor instead also i like the sea captain hat for normal combat armor
---
Heart the sound of dying ghouls far away. There must be an extractor nearby
---
That’s good info. Thanks bud!
---
Train Stations have new machines where you can scrap Legendary Items in exchange for “Scrip”
---
(Scrip is a real life reference to mining scrip, if you’re interested in the historical reference https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_scrip )
---
Anyhow.. this Scrip can be exchanged at the new Legendary Vendor(s?) for Random Legendary weapons and armor. The Legendary Vendor is supposed to arrive later this month.

I've server hopped about 10 times so far and visited each of 4 locations in the north where he should spawn and haven't found him once yet. It's frustrating since I found him first visit on another character when it was first available.
---
If you let the machine bank caps you'd never run into "seller is at max caps" problems
---
The cap limit is arbitrary as fuck...people were maxed out well before vending came onto the scene.  Spending spree on what exactly?  I rarely ever run across plans I don't know.
---
Not going to spend caps for the sake of spending caps.
---
Move them to a mule - sure, give us an option that's easier than using a friend as a middleman or launching a 2nd instance of the game to go about moving shit to an alt.
---
I don't think the servers could handle that.
---
It finds a server then checks, not scan servers till it finds one
---
I think if they rise the cap limit to 50k would solve for now, then they will have time to think a better solution for the cap caps problems.
---
The MQ's acid spit is devastating... and it was nerfed.
---
I remember running away from them - in zig-zag, I did not attend the Prometheus a School of Running Away from Things - for dear life to in the 'early days'.
---
It uses stash space actually. Has nothing to do with camp budget. Each item you put for sale is technically in your stash till you take it off the shelve or sell it.
---
Do they have to be on your team or will reviving any player do?
---
Yeah. . . I got excited when I heard you could build a “frog habitat” - should have checked. 
---
You can’t even “let him out” which would make the claustrophobia of that tiny jar a little less intense
---
Someone else who took it slow like me =). I was the same - explored absolutely everything, all locations, all quests, farmed the hell out of all the workshops and found the most efficient ways to do everything. I think I launched my first nuke at 140 lol. 
---
If you're on PC and you have a beast of a computer, let me tell you.. having 2 accounts and running them at the same time opens up a whole new world of possibilities for making caps, farming, muling, etc. I'm level 380 now on my main, with 4 level 50+ mules, 4 viable end game characters, and 1 new toon that I'm leveling up (shotgunner, just found a bloody +25% combat shotty, seemed like fate wants me to make a shotgunner).  
---
I JUST now finally made a 'real' camp that wasn't just a basic 2x2 shack with all the workbenches, and man, the new camp is freaking amazing. I'm truly proud of it. Even made a covered bridge / tunnel going over the stream, which is directly attached to my house. Did I need to? Nope. But it looks cool as hell.
---
It's absolutely feasible, but it'll have unintended consequences to the servers and population spread. If you're having to load 5-6 times chances are you're in a popular spot, if the change you desire were implemented it would be 5-6 times the servers with 5-6 times less players populating those worlds (in extreme cases).
---
I’ve been looking for a Tesla to run and gun with. Any idea what the weight is and the max damage?
---
What I love are the people selling plans, like Gauss rifle or Gatling Plasma, for MORE than the NPC vendors.
---
I get that point but that’s a very SPECIFIC example lol but they would never freeze sales. If you’re close to max &amp; you know you are turn off your vending machine, problem fixed🤷🏻‍♂️ that’s the only advice, or constantly buy shit like I did when I was max. I dropped down to 5k faster than ever in this game server hopping a bit looking at vending machines (&amp; traveling to the stupid things)
---
Weight of mine right now is 10.4
---
I just want legendary forest scout armor.....
---
What do you want a video of me playing with a full set for an hour then another server hop and armor change and compare legendary drop rates? No way. It’s obvi anecdotal... but the fact that i can get 4 legendaries at awol then go get two at general stake house then get a few more walking north at radio tower when it’s me and 3 other full unyeilding builds... compared to  1 or 2 if I’m playing solo?
---
Agreed, I saw a player with like 40+ pieces of  "Armor". My thought was, surely they must have the leather piece I'm looking for. Nope, 40 straight jackets that they hoarded from Fort Defiance. \*Facepalm\*
---
Doesn’t make it better
---
I must build in less populated places.  This only occurs about every 1 in 20 logins for me.  The only time it has occurred twice in a row is when I'm loaded into the same world I just left.
---
If I wear my sweater and slacks you have no idea what I’m wearing... so why bother condemning us to wearing  some clothes as under armor only.
---
Awesome thank you. I hope to experience this fight soon.
---
White thing kill brothers

Only raider set I liked was the heavy operator from nuka world but I definitely hope they add things like the helmet cage armor

---
Between the main story and tracking down the overseer's personal logs, you'll get sent to or near most locations on the map. Use the story as a way to explore different areas, but once you're in an area, absolutely explore every nook and cranny. There's so much cool stuff tucked away in this game.
---
The "Uniform" should be a skirt. My female character was given a Tadpole Uniform which has a skirt instead of shorts at the beginning of the quest line so there's no reason the Possum version should work differently.
---
Can confirm that hunch on PS4
---
I personally doubt they will allow us to place static inventory items in our builds. They just want us to collect mags and bobble heads and put them in display shelves. This is what I want though. The camps feel bare because I cant fill a shelf with static items. I just want a box of sugar bombs in my kitchen at least.
---
What is so hard to figure out if you don't want to lose caps don't sell shit that'll put you over the limit. Smh I can't believe this need explaining. It's 3rd grade math
---
Lol this is a big problem for me too but if you get too close you can server hop or store your machine
---
 Too late, now it's on the "inter-webs".
---
yup
---
I'm on PS4 so I guess that's not a possibility.   I'm still struggling with another problem at the moment.  I keep getting the disconnected from server error for about a week now.  Anyway good luck with your search.
---
Gotta love the punctuation police.
---
I kept hopping to different friends worlds and had the same issue. Today I found out that the spot that I "found" on my own that I thought was such a cool hidden / out of the way spot, is in fact one of the most popular spots. It's over by Twin Lakes - the one up the hill on the plateau, not the one with the behemoth in it. No way in hell I'm moving though. I have a huge, very well decorate base set up with an awesome covered bridge crossing the stream. Took me like 6 hours last night.

---
I don't think there will be a patch on the 16th, so I believe this will be in place at least until the 21st.
---
It's possible for a mid-cycle patch of course, but bringing patches to the console side is a relatively long (and pretty costly) project because of the 3rd party processes.  And for fairly obvious reasons, they don't like to patch one system but not the others at the same time.  So it will likely still be in place until the patch gets through PS/XB quality review.
---
And that's assuming they put a priority on it.  With as many other things that are in need of attention, something like this could slip through a cycle or two (though I'd assume that it's a pretty simple thing to fix, so it should be a no-brainer to get it done).
---
To my knowledge, all the armor affixes work with one another and stack. What doesn't work is mixing affixes and perk cards, +50% vats crit +40% Better Critical's = 50% says Bethesda.

That makes sense. If it's flagged as for sale you wouldn't want to accidentally use it.
---
Omg finally some else found him
---
It should just be jump, just hold it down
---
Bethesda loves to remind players of their time in Tamriel about a decade ago. Thank you, Bethesda.
---
Huh...  must be me or coincidence....
---
Yeah, that was my first impression too.  But I honestly would have bought this skin even if it wasnt to complete the quartet.  O like the off white and I loooooove the T51 and this makes anything t51.
---
From what I gathered...I am pretty sure nothing in the shop is forever. Possibly some items but I think it will all be cycled out.
---
Yah but certain perk cards and playstyles get messed up if some people cannot vats chain things. It is easy to say "just don't use a game mechanic system" and do or play other ways instead, but that's not fixing the problem.
---
I mean, not on my end anyway but sure. 😊
---
Yep, found him and his fallen comrades at the random encounter spot a bit down the road from the church of the creepy organ in The Mire.
---
Put him out if his misery quickly and mercifully.
---
Well, not a hiker, but aren't backpacks supposed to sit higher than in the small of your back?  I like the design actually, bought it and wear it with one of my Brotherhood scribe outfits.
---
Hello there, what is your time zone?
---
Full Marine Combat Armor with either Combat Armor helmet or my new spiffy Opossum cap. Most of the time I'm running around in my Bone Raider Excavator PA because I like to carry my arsenal of heavy guns and all their ammo....and grenades.
---
I roll play as an army tank, lol.
---
Well I know exactly what I’m grinding for tomorrow
---
Did they ever confirm if Arktos would be instanced or not?
---
Quick tip for fossil photo - Go to Pleasant Valley Train Station, stand on the platform, look at Top of the World (space needle looking thing), snap your picture.
---
Don't wtf the fossil is, but the camera sees it, so that's all that matters lol. Good luck!
---
The longer you hold onto them the more they will be worth.
---
they should just flat out add a 'cosmetic' tab so we dont have to play the guessing game.
---
I'd want one for my stash I rarely keep power armor on me so to pull it out of my box would be nice
---
I as well am in search of a provider too
---
I get where you are coming from, but thats in your hands. Me being denied a purchaise is not in mine. Personally i plan to hover around the 15k mark.
---
You could make the argument of increasing the cap limit but the problem would persist.
---
Like with the sales tax the limit is there to balance the economy. Preventing inflation. This is why games often have gold sinks, storage limits and gold limits.
---
How do you "tame" things? I understand pacifying them with a perk card, but they don't follow you and won't go to your camp, so how would you manage that?
---
So if I'm at 22000 caps, I should predict what will randomly sell to multiple customers and remove all but 3000 caps of that merchandise?
---
That... is where you SHOULD wear a backpack, though. Especially a daypack with no frame.
---
Wearing it lower beats the shit out of your back over a long day hiking.
---
Hold down jump.  And you have to use it in short bursts.
---
I thought I could superman with a jetpack - it doesn't work that way.
---
Yes, 100% they are. Especially frameless day packs like that.
---
Yarr! A pirate's life for me!
---
Are you also running with the Pirate Hat and the Drifter outfit?
---
GT: strembrulie. Play with a group that is 40-51. I am your age. On every night pst. We do have younger people join from time to time.
---
Since this game is lacking on pistols (and i like'em), i would propably bring  [.223 pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.223_pistol_(Fallout)) or  [14mm pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/14mm_pistol_(Fallout)) (or both) from Fallout 1 &amp; 2 to have variety.
---
I feel your pain.  I've half destroyed my CAMP trying to put 1 on/off switch inside my house so I can turn off the lights at night.  Unless it's changed, you can change a wall to a door frame with the Replace option, put a wire through that door frame and then change that door frame back to a wall.  The wire won't snap.  I haven't tried it in a month or two, but it's worth a shot.  Hopefully it'll work and this helps.
---
As clunky and unforgiving as the Perk and SPECIAL system are, you would have thought Bethesda would have implemented a way to change specs.  SPECIAL points are capped at 50 and the only way to change a build is to level up if your new build requires  more points in a certain special. They need to get rid of this restriction as well as making most of the non combat perks passive. Do I really need to waste points just to find more meat? Something like that should become a passive once you've learned how to do it.
---
Same problem here. I just wanna move it, like.. two feet to the right. :(
---
War. War never changes.
---
6 hours for a base.. lmao how high were you
---
Yah that was disappointing for me to learn also. I hoped that the zoom features would let me tag creatures and get credit for them from further away. It made me feel more like a nature watcher trying to get photos of things in the wild, undisturbed. But naw I gotta be two steps in front of them and may as well kill them and then photo their corpses. A lot of corpse photos.
---
TIL, thank you very much, will keep that in mind... so at a 10% crit damage loss (and spending 3 perk points), you could roll something else in that weapon slot, like explosive or 25% FR.
---
alternating between clown outfit and prisoner collar w/ fascnacht man head

Seen him a few times, and always make sure to check his mutilated brothers for their loots :)

Its a shame really as they could have then spawned said Cryptid for a scare event to kill him lol

---
Yea I had something like this, they both ignored me because I was across a lake and they were fighting, the Queen was dominating the beast until the giant bat infected her, then the new scorched mirelurk queen turned to me and began spraying while the scorchbeast screamed at me loudly. I managed to kill the queen and the scorchbeast flew away with half health the coward, I still hunt him to this day with a harpoon gun in hand
---
They recenty stated that only the root foundation needs to conform to the floating rule.
---
I havent tried but maybe if you place down a foundation and try to snap the blueprint to it?
---
Its worth a shot...
---
LegendaryPapaD here. I usually play during that time. Hit me up. We could...ummm...do each other....hehehehe
---
I typically play solo but would definitely enjoy teaming up for some gameplay if you are interested, let me know
---
What were their levels just out of interest?
---
If they were pretty close together it just goes to show who the true Apex Predator is :)
---
The real problem is the cap limit of 25K. Cap inflation is still a thing, and there's absolutely no reason that I can think of to limit players to 25K. Maybe put the excess into an "escrow" account that has a 5% cap penalty or it or something? IDK.
---
I have not seen too much new mentioned about it yet. Figuring we should be getting some more info real soon though.
---
I hit 1000 script today can't receive anymore got a warning saying so
---
This comment is the best one I've seen
---
Yes, Exactly or spend some caps what's the point of accumulating caps if you have no intention of spending them.
---
I'de be hard pushed to find ANY game that dosn't crash, but fo3/4/76
---
does it a LOT. (still ).
---
quest marker on bot (for example). bot will ignore you or idle shit chat.
---
server lag and stuff, well thats just the internet.
---
there are still loads of little bugs present,as there will always be.
---
please don't pick me up wrong, I have 500hrs invested in fo76 and no intentions of stopping. I love this game, bugs and all
---
Whatever poeple might think,this is a very complex game in more ways than one,anyone thinking it will be bug free requires a reality check.
---
I'm 60 , and worked in the video game industry for years (yes ,ping pong,space invadors,galaxion.......) they had bugs.
---
cheers.
---
I had no problems. Other than hitting bullseye on #4. Took a few blots to get that one, but got it after half a dozen bolts went flying.
---
I'm 38 gt: vegitastorm add me if you'd like, I try to play when work and a pregnant wife allow lol
---
Like the other post said, I'd rather not worry about cap limits when I'm adventuring or in the midst of a boss battle / SBQ.
---
"Oh shit a nuke zone/SBQ!  Ok...let me make sure to either go back to camp to lock up shop in case people want to buy shit or go to a vendor and buy completely useless shit."
---
You are missing the point you basement dwelling cunt.
---
If its a mutated piece you get +10 damage and energy resist. Thats as good as it gets after the patch
---
Different strokes for different characters:
---
1) My "survival is serious business" character wears the flannel and jeans underarmour, with the grey toque, and all armour visible.
---
2) Sandy the Clown... well.. he wears a clown suit and the original vault party hat. 
---
3) Doc Geiger... always in the labcoat, with a surgical mask.
---
4) Sigrun… haven't spent much time with her... but she's either in the Grognak outfit, or nothing at all with raider armour... til I find a harness.
---
5) and then I have a new one I'm trying... a Ghoul Gunslinger. Duster, cowboy hat, and bandana.
---
I thought I was the only one! I’m on ps4 and I was doing the campfire tales and was getting so annoyed at the fact that my DC was not hitting shit in vats...not an issue for a few bugs but those sting wings tho....so I really hope they fix that in this next update...please don’t wait two weeks to address this!
---
I use an instigating gauss with a 25% increased rate of fire.
---
I use max rifleman x3, tank killer, max covert op. Not sure exactly how stats stack but it’s 258 base. Guessing it’s then X2 then X2.5? 
---
So total around 1290?
---
There are many here much more knowledgeable who might be kind enough to correct this if I’m wrong 👍
---
Awesome, I'll give you 1000 caps for helping me out. GT Blackout7197
---
BB gun 100%. You'll shoot yer eye out!
---
I run into this encounter with a friend last night then 10 minutes later RUN INTO A GOD DAMN SHEEPSQUATCH I was lvl 33 and my friend is lvl 50 up against lvl 70 FREAKIN SHEEPSQUATCH I actually got a jump scare
---
Any relation to Captain Ahab?
---
You could also read your own posts lmao. You’re a bit thick.
---
I've put 600+ into the game. I'm level 380 on my main with multiple level 50+ mules and 4 viable end game characters. This was the first time I really built a proper base. I spent as much as 40+ hours on a single settlement in Fallout 4. 99% of the time I'm a super efficient killing machine making mountains of caps and farming hundreds of legendaries per day, but once in a while it's just nice to chill out and make something cool for no other reason than to be proud of it.
---
It was add in Patch 9.  The plans are at the Enclave Production Vendor I think.
---
Damn. Kick on the ol chameleon armor and observe nature take its course.
---
ones that i know are rarer i'll put for like 50,  everything else is like 1 or 5 caps.   Some plans are just super common, so people don't need them!
---
I used to always just dump them in the oversear cache or random containers for free, so i figure this way it's still basically free, and people come visit my camp
---
You seem nice.
---
Hey, whatever makes you feel better, okay?
---
Keep digging!
---
You're welcome, now please come and buy them all so I can get rid of them and save some vendor space.
---
My word of advice to anyone still experiencing regular crashes is to test your system. Run memtest to verify your RAM, drop your GPU and CPU overclock to stock settings and see if it still crashes. I didn't have any problems with Fallout 4, but the online element in 76 seems to have revealed hidden stability issues.
---
I did have exactly these kinds of problems initially; it was a combination of the game, a poor internet connection, unstable RAM, and an overclock that was a little too aggressive. Frustrating, yes, but it didn't take all of the fun out of playing.
---
Fixed the things I could control, and with the recent patches it now happens very rarely.
---
I am currently having a problem with mirelurk queens disappearing when killed in water, but I'm guessing that's a bug that will be fixed soon.
---
Welp. I missed that one. My bad.
---
I'm pretty sure both were level 50, though I wonder how a level 80 Scorchbeast would fair. 
---
...probably not too much better
---
Joining you now
---
Yeah, I agree some of the underarmors are the best looking clothing items in the game. Yet when armored up to cant really see them. I wear the marine wetsuit and would love to be able for that to be all you see. The bos underamors are cool and the dark ops underarmor in the atom shop is awesome.
---
No, preferably something directly from Bethesda or data from the esm. What you've described is just as likely to be total RNG rather than anything caused by your character's stats.
---
Definitely wasn't weed 😂😂
---
Hey best friend all of a sudden like...must find your supply camp. I need to make ammo for Moo Moo's Revenge (my Supermutant Gatling gun)
---
People will buy them cheap and sell them with 10x price on their own camp.
---
I won’t be on until a little later, but if you haven’t found anyone, I can help. GT: RhymingFezzik
---
I don’t mean to get biblical on you, but I will die for your swims.
---
Lol hope it's not limited.  I doubt but still.
---
 In previous iterations of FO, and I almost always used guns as my primary weapon, and after IDK how long, finallly stated using VATS.
---
In 76, I'm a melee build - @L82, haven't used VATS at all.  
---
Havent done the campfire thing - my only point is anything more than a few feet away is out of range for a handheld weapon, so it makes sense VATS give you 0% chance of a hit if target is farther out.
---
&gt;Spending spree on what exactly? I rarely ever run across plans I don't know. Not going to spend caps for the sake of spending caps.
---
And yet you still intend on collecting them the only thing a bank will do it's raised the fuck out of the price of TSE's and other rare weapons. Damn you're dumb but I expect that from someone who can't math.
---
Bwahaha I must've hurt your feelz or your tiny brain by mentioning math you called me a cunt that's so edgy you're kewl.
---
It's like McDonalds up in here Bada ba da da I'm loving this
---
It's just that all of this stuff is so non-specific.  The initial claim was "Many of the bugs from Fallout 4 are still in game".  I was expecting examples of some well known bugs from Fallout 4, not just "there are bugs".
---
You can get 100% self-revive chance w maxxed out mysterious savior and one piece of life-saving armor. There is a 1 minute timer though so if you get killed again you'll just die.
---
I don't know if life-saving armor stacks though.
---
It would be nice if there was a little more granularity in what we can see from the map, just generally.  
---
If I'm in the market for, say, a serum, I'm doing a lot of jumping around with not a lot of idea what's in stock at each CAMP.
---
Good to know. You might’ve just freed up 3 perk points for me...
---
Found myself a great spot in the mire with my alt. Had it since launch.  Never had trouble once with players, not any real trouble with wildlife.  Water, flat portions and a view. I don’t trade with this characters cause I don’t want neighbors.
---
Seriously. The player vending has become a second full time job for me.
---
Preachhhhhhh
---
Sadly XB1 😔

I placed these in my wife's camp as soon as I got the Greek Letter set. Despite the exasperated sigh she gave me, she still hasn't taken them down. lol

---
When I am running around the wasteland casually and helping newbies, I'm usually wearing: Silver Shroud outfit, wedding ring, Veil of Secrets, Patrolman glasses, newsboy cap. 
---
When I'm doing lab quests, badges, science exploration sites, then I put on: BoS Lab Coat, wedding ring, surgical mask, welding goggles. 
---
With more skins coming out for the backpack, I'm hoping to get some related thematic matching packs for my usual suits. Medic one for my lab outfit, for example.
---
no as feasible as may think, they would need to re-write the whole log in system
---
currently you need to log in to a world before it can be determined where your camp is,and then what else is occuping that space .... ish.
---
 Don't hold the button down. Jump ... then as you start to fall jump again. You can get quite a long way and get on top of about a 2 story thing. 
---
 Holding down jump gets you not far.
---
I wish VATS worked with the camera for tagging.
---
Lol I hate how tiny they are the backpack I wear on my real life walk are way bigger than that tiny shovel one in atom shop lol
---
Thanks! This must be what was happening to me on Xbox One.
---
I agree I manage my vending machine the same way then you move your caps to a mule or spend them it's not that hard.
---
I bought the plan from the Possum vendor and had the same thing happen.  I went ahead and dumped the plan in my STASH.  I'm afraid of deleting it and losing the plan from my list of learned plans, so keep it so I can read it if they fix the bug and need to learn it again.  I would absolutely not give it to any other players as that would seem like something potentially having negative consequences.  Giving it to your own alts also seems questionable.
---
So ultimately, it's your account. Do you want to take the risk of being banned?  Your call.
---
You forget about the Nuka Cola packs, tbats my jam!
---
I keep trying to find awesome deals like this, but not seeing it very much.
---
I try to keep my plans affordable. Pretty much all plans ate the default 100caps (or dropped to 100).
---
Really common shit and lowbie food/drink recipes going in the vendor dedicated to free shit for 0 caps. It's labeled "Free! WOW!" haha
---
Always enjoy when I see people snagging a couple of recipes they didn't have yet.
---
Right on!
---
The game mechanics are designed to encourage spending caps.  When I approach the caps limit, I start buying plans and recipes (the player vending has opened up even more opportunities for this).  Not having a limit encourages hoarding and hyperinflation.
---
I wouldn’t need the VPN to play the game, just to activate the code and download it. And it’s not the key that would get me banned, I figured it would be using a key from a different region.
---
he's saying move to a new spot in the wrold which is unhelpful
---
Lol if this was any other fallout title I would've killed him for sure
---
I would have bought the tactical suit from the atomic shop, but what's the point if underneath armor it looks the exact same as the wetsuit
---
Gotcha
---
Yeah, except the path for this particular reward is very tedious and quite boring (in my opinion.) So like you said, it's a game and I want to enjoy it. Doing a quest that takes hours if not days to complete that is not enjoyable to me is not worth it. That doesn't mean I should not be able to have the plans. It's no different than someone selling g other items they have earned. Typically I would agree with this sentiment,  especially when it comes to duping, but I dont think this is the same, personally.  But I can see your point as well.
---
it's not that I'm getting rads as much but the fact I'm not in my house
---
You're telling me it makes more sense for me to shut down my store to ban all potential sales, or give away the store before I can react to shut it down from across the map, than it is to have an automatic system do it? Why are you even arguing this?
---
Amen. Add those badges to the collection plate.
---
Didn’t know this for the longest time and was wasting 40 caps each move while looking for the flattest land to place my camp.
---
we really need fast travel mats from fallout 4
---
Eastern
---
The cost to make them is no more than 170 caps, and that's really the very upper end, and if you get a super duper proc, that can be reduced by 30% overall if you're crafting many. Do keep in mind that they sell for 400-450 caps at vendors, though there's a cap on that obviously. I craft 100 or so per week and max out my vendor caps by selling 3x serums on all of my 10 characters every day. 14K caps per day easy. The extras go into my personal vendor for 350 each. Haven't had any issue selling them at that.
---
Yesyesyesyeeyesyyes give this man gold. Imagine if they added new perk cards specifically for pets and your pet starts at level 1, and there are some stats you can upgrade just like the special such as:
---
Strength (for attacking enemies)
---
Perception (for finding buried loot/high tier items in containers)
---
Intelligence (for tracking animals/enemies)
---
Endurance (more hp of course)
---
Agility (adds movement speed to your pet to make him move quicker in order to avoid attacks or close distances)
---
Luck (to find extra loot in containers)
---
And maybe Charisma? (Possibly for extra xp from interactions with players?)
---
Possibly the dog would grow older with it's levels and get bigger? Until about the size of an English mastiff or so. 
---
We'd need to be able to name them. 
---
This would add a real sense of bond with you and your pet. Like you raised it from a puppy. 
---
This would be so good.
---
Sneak build. However last night i had the idea of having a rad suit that you put over your armor. But i dont know how i would balance it.
---
After a while im starting to think its fine as it is.
---
Tesla is a looters best friend. No doubt.
---
Ohhh
---
Yup FYI build a room around your machines when you shut them down. If you don't include a door no one can get in.
---
A nice fellow gave me a lvl 35 AA Gauss rifle, it's my favorite "big" rifle at the moment. Still prefer lever action for everyday fights though
---
Agree super boring and grossly grindy.
---
Those are indeed hounds

I’m deleting this post, because most people here are obviously immature.
---
Wow.  Half this stuff expires super fast!

You’re right..

If you figure out a price I’ll buy this off you. 👍
---
Forgot to add my GT: Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
The two-shot's greatest sin is that it's unreliable and with the gauss's hit or miss tendency in VATS those effects get amplified to the fullest. A two shot gauss (or any two shot sniper rifle) sounds amazing. And sometimes it is. But many times it isn't. And that's why I much prefer anti-armor and instigating prefixes for my sniper rifles (the lever first, followed by the hunting rifle, followed by the gauss and only for big effers I can point and shoot without VATS). Much more reliablerifles with more consistent deadly damage.
---
You can use a baseball bat and the Sheepsquatch-related weapons, as well.
---
How long in real time until 76's timeline, with the speedy day/night cycle catches up to  Fallout 1?
---
I do a BE 10mm SMG and let me tell you it’s a lot of fun.
---
This is something I wanted. Like you know how PO Boxes are nested along a wall.... Only they're each player vendor kiosks that people can look into as a sort of online wares browser of everything each seller on a server has. Put that at Whitesprings or make an event to refurbish Top of the World's shopping center level.
---
Not just this, we should have 'Go there,' 'Help me,' 'Take this,' 'I'm so happy,' 'I'm sad,' 'I'll leaving' sort of emotes, the current emotes really didn't expressed much, the updating/release priority also seems super low as well, we basically can't express ourselves
---
My “priced as a joke” items are 76 caps
---
"what were you wearing?"
---
Same shit. Having to adapt to meet the demands of the lowest common denominator is bullshit.
---
I have loads of these in my vending machine &amp; no one buys my stuff :-/ all cheap stuff I just want it gone lol
---
Already sold it :/ from the looks of things I probably should have waited to sell it haha
---
Thx for helping out. Could you pls explain the *revive in water* a bit more? English is not my first language....is "downed" same as dead?
---
I have the opposite problem, I'm spending all my caps at other vendors and not getting any sales! And my stuff is reasonably priced if not below mkt value. I'm about to have a 1 cap sale so I can change my inventory!!!!
---
I'm not really a fan weed, never tried anything stronger, and don't want to - I'm pretty sure with my love of caffeine there are certain drugs I'd get addicted to and would ruin my life in a heartbeat. It's been ... 8+ years since I smoked? But yeah, I'm completely worthless after smoking. Can't think straight, my hand eye coordination goes to shit, just generally suck at video games. Not my thing. When I was in my 20s, the idea of spending 6 hours building a house in a video game would have sounded stupid, but now that I'm in my 30s with a stressful job? It's relaxing as hell, great way to unwind on a day off. Different stroke for different folks though - nothing against pot, it's just not something I enjoy all that much.
---
So we can get it back to our stash?
---
Are you able to keep survival mode items in adventure mode? Do they have higher stats?
---

Eastern time zone, definitely look me up it's nice playing with more mature people when life allows
---
I saw that happen before the queen's acid nerf, and it was even more one-sided.  Poor bat monster never had a chance.
---
I'll accept them if someone I can see on screen is inviting me. But the invites from dudes across the map? Yeah, screw you.
---
Maybe it has been fixed on the Tues update?
---
You just said you want the game to freeze your sales now you’re saying you don’t wanna shut down your machine so you don’t miss on sales?? Tf are you on dude.. anyway enjoy it, have a nice day I can’t with you hahaha
---
That's ok, I don't sleep very well and I'm up at all different hours. Ill look you up next time I'm on. I'm actually at work right now and don't get done until 5:00 EST.
---
You sound like you snort adderall lol

Those are the sorta toe beans that give you marsupial!
---
Grafton Steel, bring tissues
---
This was my first suggestion as well.
---
Yeah, I thought I'd switch to my instigating 40% SS super sledge for a bit, since I'm heavy guns and I have the special layout / melee perks already purchased, it's just a matter of swapping a few perks. But no. F that. It's awful.
---
I took a picture of a medium one at someone's workshop.

---
It might be miss.quest: kill 10 charred ghouls at golf club
---
Oh and then MQ proceed to acid me to death. From far away. I didn’t think she was hitting me so I was sniping her and then I was dead. Pretty fun!!
---
As the buyer, wouldn't you rather see everything I have available? It's not my fault somebody popped in just before you and spent 6000 caps, but at least you know where that stuff is so you can friend me to get after I get rid of some of those caps. Hell, who knows, you might have something to sell that I want.
---
This is the reason why we had nuclear war in the first place those damn fools
---
Or at the edge of a stream, so they push back.
---
Uhh, according to my friend...
---
What does adderall do? Helps with concentration or something?
---
Ive seen one on PS4 , tried to friend the guy but he left not seen any since
---
He’s gonna fuck em! It looks like he set em up so he could fuck em!
---
That’s about as blunt as I can be
---
Basically lolll
---
A lot of defense perks and a lot of offense perks and food and a lot of power fisting fast as possible. A lot of eating stims and rad-x and radaway like candy also.
---
I finished FO3 with that thing. Sure, ammo is heavy... but blowing off Super Mutant heads with 8-ball stealth kills is a joy like no other.
---
Absolutely
---
Sorry, UK Here
---
Some guys already bought it all. You gotta check luck hole mine.

GT: PickledSandwich, level 103
---
I'm on whenever I have free time.  This is my first real attempt at online play (excepting getting killed in GTA Online all the time on the old 360)
---
No they didn't. The nukes were down for almost a week. I think you might be thinking of a different thing. The only time I have seen them push out a hotfix was recently after they brought back the vendor dupe.
---
I'm on PC and can trade you one for a plan I dont have
---
I found a Sheepsquatch and Scorchbeast fighting once. Neither really did much to the other.
---
1000-2000 is very high for that standalone mutations. They usually go from 100-200. The recipients can go for around 2000.
---
I saw them up the road from Slocum Joe’s this morning.
---
Can't you just turn off the generators?
---
I’m not up to date on the abbreviations. What’s WS?
---
I want to see a Mirelurk Queen versus a Behemoth. 
---
That behemoth has such a powerful attack and I bet resistance to the Queens poison.
---
Lucky, I've been trying to get a decontamination shower for weeks.
---
You don't get the message that gives you the option to find a different world when loading in?
---
Well we just gotta nuke one side of the earth until the spin speeds up
---
I just picked up a lvl 35 TSE dragon over 600 damage with no perks invested. Great damage slow reload lol
---
Too bad he wasn't at a workshop... Doh
---
Probably not.  I hunt SB's when I'm bored for prime receivers.  Only discernable difference between a 50 and an 80 SB is 30 bullets.  Post nerf they are kind of a joke.  Worry more about the scorched they summon and I dont worry about them at all.
---
I hope that never happens  if we were meant to have more then 25k caps per character we would have more caps per character. There is actually a whole economy within the game giving more caps per player would only inflate prices then you complain more because your legendary item is costing  2x as much with more caps in the economy but really it's  worth the same. 
---
25,000 cap limit - 2-3k cost for legendary item
---
50,000 cap limit- 4-6k  cost for legendary item maybe even more due to caps losing value seeing there are more caps available within the economy.
---
You keep anything on your character nothing changes from mode to mode
---
Had an issue with the 4th bullseye - until I knocked off the corpse before my 2nd attempt. Definitely do it in the daytime.
---
Damn if that isnt the biggest dick move i dont know what is
---
No that just removes your shop from the map players can still stumble accross your camp and make purchases
---
That son of a bitch bot keeps spawning in my camp, the asshole just appears insults me and leaves. Well after the rage builds he dies in my pond.
---
So what's the point of survival mode? Does everything just have more health and do more damage?
---
How are people so concerned about saving like six caps.
---
I’ve got my TSE dragon up to 1100. It’s a beast!
---
No, it's not new at all, but it is good that you bring this up again, because you can tell from some of the replies here that many people don't realize this goes on.  You are  right about why it still goes on and is becoming more prevalent now. There are several types of players who do this for various reasons and each have completely different goals.  More players need to know that accepting team invites from unknowns can be risky.
---
Idk I saw some people offering the high capacity yesterday which confuses me
---
I bought it last week after being scared off for a long time. As far as I can tell it's just a fallout game. The lack of towns and stuff is too bad but not a huge deal. The problems I've had with this game are the same problems I've had with every fallout/elder scrolls game. I think it's really fun and occasionally running into other players is fun. Although I get spooked easily and have shot them a lot. Everyone has laughed it off so far
---
Maria 9mm from New Vegas
---
I ment nothing changes with your items have you never been in survival or even looked at the rules
---
Why not just take the items out of the vending machine?
---
I popped it down near where I wanted it to see if the terrain was even enough to support it, and when I went to move it into a better position it says my Hero of The Wastes is in use. 
---
Now my Hero of The Wastes is standing in the middle of the road next to my camp accosting anyone who wanders by.
---
No it scares me
---
Dude... find a better location.
---
yeah, they need to patch it so that if it doesn't have power, it doesn't work!
---
What are you trying to say? That people shouldn't put up a vending machine when they are at max cap? Yeah. Pretty obvious.
---
Lol I get it I'm not built for pvp
---
Sheepsquatch was here.
---
You only need to disconnect the generator from the vending machine. It dosnt work without power
---
How does firerate affect the gauss? Does it need less time to charge?
---
You'd have to put them in again and price everthing all over again. IMO This is easier no resetting the machine
---
Freeze sales at 25,000 caps to allow me maximum profit and still allow you to view all of my wares, friend me and come back after I spend off some caps. It's not my fault the guy just before you spent 6000 caps in my store taking me up to the limit. How am I supposed to predict that?
---
I have a keypad door and two garage doors on the front of my camp. Close the garage doors and the only way in the the keypad.
---
because it takes forever to put them back in, since you have to sit and price everything again.. especially if you have al 4 machines
---
Ok then just put the machine in the stash?
---
Swap out the just legs with another unpainted and it should work just fine. The ultracite legs look very close to this set already
---
yeah, but that just wastes time, why doesnt the game just not place us in a world until it can find us a one that our CAMP can actually be placed in?
---
my camp near overseers camp has been there for months, but after vending update it takes 5-6 tries to get a world my camp can be placed in
---
Powering it only puts you on the map players can still purchase goods if they find your camp.
---
I couldn't resist diving in. I have made it a goal to kill everything with my bare hands at least once.
---
As the others here said, I just have a switch in (series?) with the shops so I can toggle them on and off when I get close to max.
---
Thanks.  It has been a while since I launched the game.
---
Wrong, people can still buy things from you, even if the vending machine isn't connected to a generator.
---
Usually?  For one week?
---
Then you have to put everything back on and set prices again.
---
From my experience without power it did not function without power on ps4
---
There are 59 years between 76 and Fallout 1. 21,535 days, plus about 15 more for leap years. 
---
Bethesda has been using a 20:1 timescale in their games for a while, which means every real life minute is twenty minutes in game. 
---
This means that our 21,550 game days can be shortened to 1077.5 real life days, or 2 years 347 days.
---
This game release November 14, 2018, so expect to hit the time of Fallout 1 some time around September-October 2021. 
---
With all that being said, the actual date in fallout 76 seems to reset every day or few days, as it is almost always October 23 in game when you check it.
---
I think the OP was saying that, but also If you have vending machines already, then get near max caps afterwards, hide the machines or lock them down in a closed off room
---
No
---
Ok
---
WV State police.  Police uniform, campaign hat, patrolman glasses.
---
Yep but if I stumble accross your camp I can still make purchases.
---
Yea, I think that is what it was called.  White with the airforce like wing and stars.
---
Whitesprings.
---
That's ok. I'm up at all different hours. I think it would be cool to play with someone from the UK. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
I would love to list energy, ballistic, heavy, rifle, shotgun, etc on the weapons as well. I am only on the hunt for energy weapons atm (specifically Plasma Gatlings) would be nice if we could hit a search function and it would add a pip to the shops that currently have those in stock.
---
Well, I always love hearing a full, well thought out opinion once in a while. Thank you for this
---
Meh, it's both accurate and totally in accurate depending on your perspective.
---
Camden Park is at about the right spot, so are Charleston and Harper's Ferry.  Lewisburg and the Whitesprings are decently close in real life.  Welch is a southern WV town so it fits into the Ash Heap pretty well.  [Mount Blair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain) is a good fit there too.  Morgantown should probably be a little more north but fits. The radio observation towers are pretty good in location.  Hillfolk Hotdogs is accurately placed compared to the real life equivalent. 
---
The Mire's decently placed, part of the state actually has mountain top wetlands.  Might have moved it a little more south.  Dolly Sods is a nice hiking trail if you ever make it there.
---
Summerville and Summersville Lake are actually a lot farther away from Charleston. Beckley would have been better off in the Savage Divide, and turn the current Beckley into Logan or Matewan, since they fit in better with the miner strike theme.   
---
Kanawha (CAN - aw - WHA) County Ranger's Station in the Cranberry Bog is completely wrong, since that has the country stretching across the entire map since there is the Kanawha County cemetery in the Forest.
---
Things are stretched, compressed, and the like but I think they did a pretty decent job of capturing the state in a game friendly format.
---
Yikes. I should’ve known that one. Thank you
---
That Gun
---
Right? There is such a huge map, and if the location he's building his camp is that common to build in, why can't he just move?
---
Has this ever been tested? it says right in the description for the shops that players cannot buy while it is powered down
---
Blueprints you make, are just that: designs for a made structure. When a blueprint is in STORED it means everything within it is built, and stored. You can disconnect the items by scraping the blueprint, which will send all items to be stored individually.
---
I'll try it again tonight but I'm on PS4 and I was still able to make purchases at unpowered machines. I tested it.
---
I'll have to look you up. My Gt is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
Haha 😆
---
Marine wetsuit with marine helmet (actually a mask/hood), Enclave Urban Scout Armor. Call it my Snake Eyes build 😃
---
I think you need lv 3 in animal friend then you will get an option to "tame" instead or in addition to pacify
---
Gender non binary fluid demi unicorn fairy mutant. Don't you dare assume xe's  pronoun bigot!!
---
I am on the fence about it. It's nice to know if the person you're about to fight with is armed and armoured.
---
Ah that sucks
---
I tried it when vending first came out. Maybe it was hot fixed IDK
---
And in the meantime just hide most of my available merch? That's not how stores work! lol!
---
Hun we got another one stuck in the stairs, get the butter!
---
You're welcome
---
Me personaly no, due to my sporadic and limited play time. That being said, i could see others doing so. But the lack of a chat function makes this very hard. I would not accept random friend invites unless i know why, and on the buyers side i dont know if the friends list has a limit, and then managing that list thereafter.
---
Either way, if what you are saying is true, building the wall around it is a good idea.
---
Much faster to remove/ add a wall then to reset every price in the vending machine
---
Oh I'm definitely getting that skull mask, if not just for that sweet Ryuji from P5 cosplay.
---
The other day I couldnt get it to activate more than 1 in 10. Then yesterday it was like every other one hit Super Duper. Idk range is strange some times...
---
There’s a few caves you can build in. The one near Vault 76, there’s one North of the Ammo plant in the mountains, the acid Cave down south in by a fissure, the Watoga Highway Tunnels, one in the north of the Swamp with a bunch of dead Brahmin in it, and one more than ends up being more of a hole than a cave, but I forgot where it is.
---
Plz fix explosive vents tho. I wanna pain train people from space but the vents never proc side melee PA times
---
Rifles are quite a bit better than Heavy Guns atm due to crit/sneak headshot spam.
---
So be dumb and sell at max caps? Or spend caps then reopen shop? 🤔🤔 that's a tough one...
---
Harper's Ferry is your best bet. I'm missing the legs myself but just keep forgetting to look and server hop. When you spawn in, they can spawn in the display cases on every floor of the building with the hole in the wall and had a train car crashed into its side. 
---
Marine armor plans also can spawn in there, as well.
---
Sorry to bother, but what are the numbers on lead lined? Considering getting it myself
---
Isn't the last objective (1/4) to earn 3 tadpole badges 0/3?
---
Tis better to have beard and lost than to never have beard at all.
---
Exactly what is needed. When they announced they would give the option of staying or leaving a world I thought that it would be quicker. It just skips going back to main menu. So like 5 seconds?
---
I think you must of hurt the feelz or there mom brought a snack to them it's kinda hard to sip a juice box and eat a pb&amp;j cut into triangles no crust and type you really are mommies special someone aren't you OP.
---
I'll be sure to try this, thank you.
---
You can do them in any order
---
Good for you:) But I don't think that's the cause, I never used that perk and I have the same problem with my shotguns.
---
+90 rad resist, +30 carry weight
---
Can't you just unplug them?
---
Awwww SHIT why didn't I know about this???? I'm gonna need to start grinding the shit out levels because I think I only have a level 1 or 2 animal friend card and idk when it drops again
---
Did not know of this bug. Makes sense for how often it happens.
---
I def mark a lot down. Just never up!
---
That's the longest you have travelled?
---
Yeah get the milk last, and I don't need the extra 2 anymore, I still make the smores though
---
Without a veil, worn or the secret one, you can't get back into the basement.
---
PSA: If you lose your veil there is no way to get it back.  It won't be in the spawn points, either.
---
Explosive armor piercing 45 thompson.
---
Harpers ferry and burrows can have a chance to spawn plans for them. I’m sorry i can’t be of more help with exact locations but I’m sure a quick google search should tell you where armor plans can spawn there
---
I think I figured it out.  If it's continuously running it'll be just about 3 years to catch up to Fallout 1.   
---
 if   
---
\- 1 minute in Fo76 = 3 seconds  
---
\- 60 minutes in FO76 = 180 seconds  
---
\- 1 Day in FO76 = 4320 seconds  
---
\- 4320 seconds  = 72 Minutes real time/ Fallout 76 day.   
---
\- 365 FO76 Days  = 26280 Real time minutes  
---
\- 26280 Real time minutes = 438 hours real time / FO76 year  
---
59 years between  FO76 vaults opening, and Fallout 1
---
438\*59 = 25842 hours real-world time per 59 Fallout 76 years.  
---
25842/24 = 1076.75 real-world days days per 59 Fallout 76 years.  
---
1076.75 days/365 = 2.95 real world years per 59 Fallout 76 years.
---
There wouldn't be more caps... You'd still have a 25k cap per character... You spend 1000, to drop to 24k and then can take up to 1000 out of your vending bank.
---
You'd never be able to have more than 25k on your person at any time
---
Between 98 NAR and Beckwith farm, north of Whitespring, at the top of the mountain is a billboard. There's about a dozen cats that call it home. FT to Beckwith Farm and walk west to the edge of the mountain and you should see the billboard below you somewhere.
---
I like this idea. But will the doors always stay open when your not there? I know my camp doors seem to have a mind of thier own.
---
I know but I like my stream... :(
---
i guess if there is enough voices calling out on this that maybe they'll make it possible to convert underarmor into outfits but the other way round it wont work because it would lead to a lot of clipping issues
---
Same! I try to return the favor and sell my stuff pretty cheap. Hopefully more people will follow suit!
---
Well I've seen people asking 50c for a stimpak...and then 50 for fusion cores in the same machine
---
Not sure people know wtf they're doing
---
id say this goes beyond spanking.
---
this looks like the scene in pulp fiction when bruce willis comes back to save marcellus wallace from Zed and the Gimp.
---
Hell of a re-enactment
---
I'm confused, what's helpfulness? I assume it's one of the generic "go help unmarked NPC" of finding one of the 2 dailys offered by the line. 2 robots  1@dolly sods 1@ kiddie cabins.
---
Half way down the stairs, is a place where I’d sit..
---
You'd never have more than 25k to spend at a given time.
---
I had someone message me the other night telling me to accept their team invite so they could fast travel.  I had ignored it because I don't know the person, and when they messaged me they didn't ask, they told me to accept it.  Yeah no.  I didn't even bother to reply to them either.  If I don't know you, I won't accept your random invite.
---
I think the high capacity mod plan is the only one bugged/shareable
---
Dinosexuals?
---
I couldn't give less of a fuck what an internet nobody thinks of me
---
I took a far more roundabout way of arriving at nearly the same ends you did.
---
When they first introduced vending machines you could buy withoit it being powered (tested on launch PS4). I'm not sure if this has been patched I was under the impression the power just puts you on the map.
---
Nah you good you ain’t missing anything
---
So right there with you friend. It was after 1 am last night when I realized I'd drank all the coffee in the house again. I'd just finished hunting some Yao Guai  and was about to find some radstag to finish off my Hunter badge, but totally started falling asleep on my feet. 
---
Currently rushing through my work stuff so I can get back and rock some more Scout badges!
---
You do realize that the list price has nothing to do with the items actual value?  My 3* TSE combat shotgun shows something like 153 caps for its value. You're lucky if you can get it for 25K right now, assuming anyone would sell one for caps. 
---
The suggested value doesn't even take legendary stars into account. A good rule of thumb, though this will vary wildly depending on what the effect is, is around 500-750 caps per star.
---
Close to Berkley Springs?
---
I haven't had any issues yet and I've had this set up since player vending launched but you never know. I also set up the power to the doors and my vending machines on the same switch so if they get closed it cuts the power to the vendors just incase
---
Ok this is epic
---
The one in Appalachia?
---
Just go to Poseidon plant, repair the landing pad, take a picture
---
Or why humans are killing themselves and turning into cthulu im lucky hole mine.
---
I think I've finally found my forever home with one of my builds. Never get booted, hardly anyone visits (which fits with the whole point of this build) even with my vendor plugged in.
---
However, another of my builds almost always has to find another server. I picked a common spot with that one... So I'm gonna move him and rebuild his CAMP I think. It's time anyways.
---
Quad Western sitting in mine for 5k
---
I got you, but many of the wee bugs in fo4 were just that.non specific little glitchs. only when someone reports them, do we find and ident, a
---
more game serious fault and there work arounds.
---
 a well known fo4 bug was npc from old sewage works farm,wont engage after pump replacement (roger WAS a synth by the way,and all earmarked to be killed). cure - just keep coming back.....MOUNTHS !
---
fo 76 has loads of this as well.
---
can cause frustration yes,but its not the end of the world.
---
Yeah by flatwoods.
---
They should have fixed all duping methods and removed all TSE and said sorry you will have to get another it would suck if you got one off a drop but it would have avoided the whole nerf but then again why should 2 bullets that explode do lots of damage ohh I know they are f@cking exploding bullets dupers suck.
---
Got a link for any of that? 
---
Also, are you seriously trying to complain about comparing things from different times? Yet you have no problem trying to compare the active players that are on diablo 2's servers currently, even though the game is 20 years old, and the servers have been going for those 20 years.
---
I mean compare d2's player base numbers 6 months after release, and compare it to fo76's total sales. More were actively playing d2 on the servers than fo76 has sold.
---
&gt;Not sure how I could take anything you say seriously at this point. It's like you're trolling me or something
---
Says the dude who thinks fo3 sold better than NV, even though if you look up any information about them NV out sold fo3 and there isn't really anywhere making the claim otherwise, except you. Seems you just pulled it out of your ass.
---
White fluff bad
---
Already exists and is in the game since most of the data was copied over  from fallout 4 and was in Beta but I think they release it much later as free content. &gt;!Stated much later since we are slated to get mailboxes next if you check in datamined utility section.!&lt;
---
What store you find it in ?
---
He’s a Legend, Dary Grahm.
---
haha same here brother
---
Whoa, really? That’s fantastic. Thank you!!
---
A spanking! A spanking!
---
The Ballistic Fist.
---
You'd think it was obvious. Wouldn't ya.... but after seeing a plethora of whiny post on here I think not.
---
I was also trying to show an easy way to guarantee there are no unwanted sales
---
Not until next fasnacht and everyone is getting a shit load of toothy mans
---
Hi, I'm 65, semi-retired, on at all sorts of times, lvl 127. Central time zone. My sons tried to get me into all sorts of online Xbox games, but I wasn't interested until Fallout 76. And unfortunately it's a game they won't play! My gamertag is profshade2.
---
The only way the system could work is if Bethesda track all items, i am sure they must be thinking about it as they cannot keep letting the market get a hold of the mega rare items this easily this often!
---
No atom shop this since it was free on F04 and previous
---
Yea hurt feels, because fat boy makes it a math coherence problem.
---
This would in no way let people carry more than 25k caps at a given time. Thus, no one would ever be able to sell for more than 25k through vending machines. 
---
Limit the bank to 5-10k
---
Enough that if you have a decent sized sale you aren't fucked, but not so much that you can use it as a caps mule
---
Honestly I can't believe the negativity toward some ideas here. 
---
tHe EcOnOmY!!!!! 
---
Dupers fucked the economy plenty already.
---
I got lucky.  Campfire Tales popped up and a really strong crew was there.  All I did was kill bloodbugs and they did the rest of the work.  Got the plan.  Then ran around like a madman collecting ingredients.  That last bite that completed the badge and gave me the last badge I needed to buy one of the backpack mods...delicious!
---
I have the same sense of humor
---
cheers
---
Crazy thing most dont realize that you can change the spawn, depending where your stuff is placed it changes spawn. Give it a try when you move next time before you place stuff down then after making it often it changes spawn, good example is when I placed my base on sub station, before placing all base items it spawned be below cliff, after placing stuff down I was spawning on top.
---
My current outfit is:
---
Possum Hat
---
Fashionable Glasses
---
Prison Collar
---
Civil War Dress
---
Orange Pipboy paint
---
It was the Imposter Sheepsquatch hat before Possum.
---
I also really like the Ritual garb. That and the matching mask, then that and the imposter sheepsquatch hat.
---
It definitely happened when I first applied the mod. After relogging seemed to work. Will have to see if this is an actual issue or just a one-off bug.
---
No one has to show video of anything. That isn't the players job to take videos of every single bug they run into. This is literally the only game I've seen people literally argue against people trying to let people know about bugs, and say they have to show video proof.
---
No other game has had anything like that, no one has to give anyone video proof of a bug, that isn't how it works. I'm sure as hell not going to go and download a screen capture software just to prove something that tons of people are talking about. Everyone already knows about the UI bug, that is old news, this is something completely different. It is why it is even happening to people selling guns or armor, things that aren't stacked, and only have 1 of. So the UI bug wouldn't matter, likewise the guy who sold 25 stimpacks (which were all he had) for 25 caps each, yet only got 225 caps, from selling all 25 of them.
---
I did the same. I built the walls and stored them so I would reserve the CAMP budget for them. It's much easier than removing everything and relisting it again.
---
Even if armour was always visible, the type of armour means nothing in PvP as everyone who will pose any sort of challenge will have perks in armour penetration, it's the legendary effects which matter.
---
I want a max level in the worst way. But I'm happy with the lvl 35 I can also mule it to a low level alt when I find a replacement.
---
Saw a guy holding it for 25k
---
Unless its a locked room full of punji boards. Then when the invulnerability runs out they will die.
---
That's cool. I can help you out with the lower level stuff and get you caught up. I tend to kind of take my time with the fallout games and explore, wander around, collect scrap, etc. Also, I have C.A.M.P. ADD... Always moving my house and rebuilding it. Lol.
---
I'd be all for buying that :)
---
Tomorrow it will be available as the Purveyor stocks it, so I imagine it'll enter the loot tables as well.
---
That's what I thought that sucks
---
true
---
Are you on ps4 or xbox? Because I'm on PC and others I know who are also on PC have the same issue of corpses disappearing instantly after the mob dies. So my guess is this bug is a PC bug, not an xbox or ps4 bug.
---
IGN sounds like pc , GT. Xbox , ?
---
I had a modded minigun that shoots mini nukes.  That was fun.
---
 Well I did a leap from a cliff when helping some guys get the flying bot. It fell right in the middle of a pack of Muties right behind WesTech. 
---
 I leaped and flew quite a ways and dropped right in the middle of the pack. Maybe 20 stabs later they were dead.
---
I use a berserker gauss in nuke zones while in hazmat at 19% health and mine is around 440. Only 1 Star and not maxed on rifle perks. 3/1/1 for 40% increase.
---
I've been wearing the Atomic Shop bomber jacket for a while and whilst I like it a lot, that winter camo is much more stylish if a little pointless in Appalachia
---
Always believed it was due to bots, I literally can't see anyone in their right mind downvoting a request to send this back to the way it was.
---
What system do you play on?
---
It’s different. It’s just a mask with your mouth and chin exposed and no hood.
---
Platform?

It is pretty scummy, however if bethesda hadn't catered purely to the pve'rs (me) and diminishing pvp'rs (also me) options with every patch , they would have been able to be more open about it and just let it rip on your base without the scummy tactics.
---
I'm not sure how destructible bases would work now with player vending since people would just annihilate all of them on the map but maybe the pacifist option should only be toggle-able on the main menu and protects you from slap and camp damage
---
Survival was never good and only fun on the first few days when everyone had lots of aid and cap losses were intense but if you were high level you forced you to make a new char or run around with zero caps which ruins it for everyone, nowadays survival is just people with the actual best gear in the game and hackers/modders using anything they can for a advantage and for literally no gain since they limited cap loss a tad to low (should have been 76 for adventure and 101 for survival)
---
Until they add a proper survival mode that is actually survival and not just about pvp rules and no fast travel and also add a pure pvp mode to make everyone happy you are gonna keep seeing more grimy ways bored pvpers will drag you into it, being someone who likes pve and pvp it's getting harder with every patch to blame em for it.  Rant over think I'm gonna paste this onto every griefer post.
---
We can buy what the hell we want bro. I don't dupe, and I assume you don't, but I guarantee we both have duped gear. I suggest you drop half of your stash to stop promoting these evil duping scumbags.
---
You're acting like these people are harming you in some real life way. 
---
Your reddit endorsed outrage is hilarious. Get a grip.
---
Wait, there’s a winter camo variant for the fatigues?
---
That is beautiful lmao. Love it.
---
he plays pc
---
Well I’ll be. I didn’t even check, but yeah, mine was level 20. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Same, I dont think I have any plans over 150 caps I just want them out. Not to mention ammo for guns I dont use.
---
Sure but raise you int by 10 and your exp is increased for the same mob. Raise your charisma and you’ll see group rewards for ammo or purified water go up.  The ONLY time I’ve gotten multiple legendary spawns in the same location is from group play where combined luck is over 100.
---
Who said anything about a shotgun? My post said lever action.
---
I think if you enter trought the pullowski preservation things u dont need the veil
---
Been saying this since the 4th beta run
---
Honestly this gives me an idea that Bethesda should take on as a suggestion; whenever Grahm spawns as a Legendary, he should sell a couple randomized Legendary weapons or armor.
---
Dear people down voting: it uses both. It's stored in the stash but go ahead and try maxing out build space to confirm to yourself whether or not it uses build space. It will give you that message. Then delete some objects in camp and you'll find you can now store more in the vending machine.
---
That or an LMG or machine gun with decent stats. I'm a melee build and still use them when I want some distance between me and the big things that go smash.
---
I think it's an uncommon spawn in Defiance but not 100%, could be a reward from BoS events or quests
---
I think they do, one of my Brahmin in Free Range was Legendary once
---
Which one was helpfulness
---
I already go through radaway like candy in PA, I usually always use a diluted rad x and glowing blood pack. Lately it seems as if I take more rads than normal even though it shows less than 2 on the meter. That's partially why I'm looking into the suit instead.
---
PA + Emergency Protocol + Nerd Rage + Dodgy + Blocker =  No worry Bloody build. 
---
I use it for my Bloody Explosive Minigun/GatlingGun
---
I said have a good day. If you said this 20 minutes ago I’d have cared
---
This doesn’t even sound like duping. I swesr the word “duping” is just a buzzword nowadays and making these accusations make this subreddit look foolish. Like yeah real dupers should get instabanned but how does your reasoning make any sense?
---
1: “his camp was just a shop”
---
    So what? People have camps suited to their needs and interests. This could be part of the persons RP
---
2: “lots of stuff. TS and 3* but no TSE” 
---
      Buddy TS aren’t even worth duping. 3* weapons don’t mean shit if they aren’t good rolls. 
---
3: “he had every serum”
---
       Once again, how does this indicate duping? 
---
You’re grasping at straws here and should do a little research before accusing people
---
Operation tidy
---
I’m not sure there is a lvl 45 TSE dragon. But I’m very happy to be wrong!
---
Not sure exactly what your issue is, but I'll give you info that helped me. For the 4th objective, you have to earn Tadpole badges. The way you do that is NOT explained in the game. You need to pop open your map, then open the menu, and then select Challenges. Go to the World category, scroll all the way down to the end of the uncompleted ones and you'll see the Tadpole badge challenges. Complete 3 of them and you'll finish Tadpole. The easiest ones are swimmer, archer, athlete, hunter, and mammalogist. Cooking is very hard due to some rare ingredients. Also note that some of them are bugged and can't be completed yet: Medic and Herpetologist are the 2 that immediately come to mind. On my character, I had 2 finished and a 3rd one almost done when I got a quest marker to go back and talk to the scout leader and he gave me my backpack. Once you do this, you'll open up Possum badges that you find in the exact same place. These are harder and, again, a few are bugged, like Musician. You'll need these badges to buy backpack mods. But they can also be earned by doing Scout related daily quests and events. Cleaning up Kiddie Corner, the Dolly Sods insect one, and Campfire Tales at Camp Adams. Campfire Tales only happens at night and Camp Adams is just north of the Nuka Cola plant.
---
What would be cool, is if we can install a remote shut-down switch between the vending machines and their power source. It should create a new option in your pip-boy, that when you press the on/off button, the machines cut off, stop broadcasting location, and don't allow sales. 
---
I'd like this option, because I can't fast travel due to weight, and walk everywhere.. It's impossible to stop my machine from selling if I'm across the map.
---
I have had 4500 .45 in my vending shop for a week.. I just can’t get rid of anything anymore, which is the opposite of the first two days of vending.
---
You will need bethesda archive extractor and maybe multi xwm, both available on nexus. There are plenty of sound replacer tutorials on yt, even a skyrim one will do. It's not difficult, just a little time consuming. Good luck!
---
PS4 Pro^*.
---
The disappearing mobs happens from time to time on PS4.  What is usually happening is that the body has respawned where it originally came from.  It's not a big deal, I look around to find it, and if I can't I just kill another.
---
What I almost never see are all the crashes, huge lags and server disconnects that people often complain about.
---
(* Well, Sony call it a PS4 Pro, but nobody has ever offered to pay me for using it.)
---
When you can take this fusion cell from my hand, it will be time for you to go...
---
Plasma grenade plans are reward drops for Ash Pile events. Look on your map for anything in the southwest that says Breach and Clear, Lode Bearing, Fly Swatter and the like.
---
have you tried talking to the scoutmaster at the kiddie cabins?
---
I'm just saying, don't but items that are highly likely to be duped......Explosive Energy weapons do not exist, they were removed from spawning and only ballistic weapons have the explosive option. Therefore, all these 3* Explosive energy weapons are very unlikely to be legitimate items.
---
but you do what you want bro, if you feel you need one of these item....go to the dealer and get your fix. Im'm just saying that I will not have any sympathy to anyone who gets caught out
---
This is not the issue with me. My plasma Gatling reloads to 500 rounds not 250. Sometimes it doesn't even use the cores. If I change servers it refills to 500 and doesn't waste cores. Right now I have 8 full cores and they don't always use cnd after using a 500 round clip. 
---
Not exactly a bug to be complaining about but figured I would bring it some attention.
---
I don't understand why the suit doesn't go over existing armor like an outfit. Seems odd to make us give up and and all DR for RR.
---
My newborn ruined my sleeping pattern, so now when she wakes us up at 4 in the morning and my wife feeds her and goes back to bed, I just jump into the game until its 4 hours later and its time for work :D
---
Sounds like someones a communist, off to prison with you along with the people who didn't pay their parking tickets! (Actual cannon lore that prison was also filled with petty offenses and even mentioned how one guy with explosive collar had his head exploded was in prison because of parking tickets)
---
Spoiled meat, the main ingredient in the Fasnacht sausages actually.  Those sausages are the wurst.
---
Heck, my Instigating/Explosive pump action shotgun, aka "the Magic Boomstick", is level 25.  I still used the heck out of it long after leveling past, right up until the nerf.
---
that is an excellent idea. Can't believe I haven't thought of this already lol. Thank you! :)
---
You clearly didn't read what i said. Im stuck on helpfulness, it is the repeatable quest you get after called operation tidy...
---
There's the lighted letters in the Atom Shop, I don't remember the exact name. But it has all 26 English alphabet letters. Not quite what you're asking but maybe will suffice?
---
Various serums, ultracite ammo (.45 off the top of my head), several of the sheilded under armors, decon showers, etc.
---
Of course lol...
---
Really? I thought it was a low level weapon I bought it for like 3K in a machine. Good to know thanks
---
Some people can't get any better than crappy vision. Some people even with prescription eye glasses/contacts still have vision bad enough they are unable to drive, or even read these tiny notes.
---
I can't imagine how small the notes are on small monitors, I'm on a 34 inch ultrawide and have relatively good eyesight and some of the notes are still a pain in the ass to read.
---
One man's treasure is another persons trash... or was it the other way around?
---
I had issues with Grafton Dam last night as well, but was able to figure it out. If you go across the street from the building (where the super mutants hang out) there is a rock formation. Stand on that and point the camera towards the dam itself, that should do the trick. I'm not sure what the issue is with the Top of the World. I did have to get pretty close to it, but it worked without much trouble. Hope that helps!
---
Especially in such a mining rich area, you think you could find some just laying around, but no its all hand gernades, and landmines.
---
I wasn't that close to Max caps but I guess a group of people flash mobbed my camp and started buying everything up. I'm trying to stay below 20k caps from now on.
---
Mod hotswap?  Jetpack for strength boost, for example...
---
Magic underwear? That's crazy!
---
People can still buy from powered down machines.. they just can't see your camp on the map anymore
---
&gt;I want to have faith that Bethesda wants all their customers to enjoy basic functionality in their game without having to use mods.
---
If that were the case they wouldn't have forced voice chat down everyones throats. Because that basically tells deaf and hard of hearing people to kick rocks, you don't get to communicate with the other players.
---
The Striker from fo4, so you can murder your enemies with a catapulted bowling ball!
---
I kinda of understand where you are coming from  but the caps are still in the economy. Think about your bank accounts does the United States  just ignore the money in everyones bank accounts or do they count it towards total currency in circulation ? If you print more dollars they lose value.
---
Aw that bums me out, I was super excited to run around in that as an outfit.
---
There’s a daily event at the pumpkin house that rewards it.
---
I killed a Legendary Chicken last week.
---
Just place a chair, instrument, or crafting station above where it happens so people can free themselves.
---
I've spawned into locked houses or into foundations/walls and was able to escape using a nearby interactive object.
---
Excellent information. Thank you.
---
You get the pumpkin grenades from the quest at the pumpkin house.
---
I got my code for XBL on eBay for $25.
---
Great idea for atomic shop item, a larger aquarium for Prince. Or maybe a pond you can place with similar function of in home two headed cow where Prince will swim in pond or walk near by.
---
How is it immersive you can't zoom in on notes? If it were immersive you'd be able to zoom in on the note, just like you are taking the note and holding it closer to your face to read the fine print. The lack of that ability is actually hurting immersion.
---
Great find!
---
Not gonna sell much that way.
---
I've been playing since beta and I've only managed to see him one, and of course he was sold out of everything and had no caps so I could sell to him. Does he have any unique items?
---
Hell, I only managed to see the Flatwoods Monster for the first time this weekend, and he disappeared the second I started to approach him. I haven't even seen the Mothman in months.
---
Ooh, are we talking running two copies of the .exe at the same time?  
---
I'm #4k60ultrapcmr, and my mule account runs on a gt940m laptop, there is a slight difference is visual quality...
---
I mean I'm always around to help lighten your wallet if you want to help a brother out. I'm consistently under 5k caps because I'm trying to get as many plans as I can.
---
My point is, why do you have to close the store and hide away your good merch because you're 5,000-10,000 caps away from your cap limit? It's counter-intuitive to what a store is. If Bethesda insists on a cap limit then there should be a system in place that keeps all the merchandise viewable, but limits sales up to the cap.
---
I know and it makes me really sad :( from here on out it makes me not want to buy their games.
---
If you are on PC, there is a mod that makes paper bags glow, so you can find them even in tall grass or a bush.
---
That's actually pretty cool
---
Nah, that map marks the junk ones. There's one in a bathtub at Mosstown and another at Middle Mountian Cabins.
---
What I do is carry loads of weapons &amp; armor so I can store my junk. I have the weight reduction perks, and I don't lose my junk...
---
Or you could build in a more original location.....
---
You can still be sneaky as a melee character. Maxed Sneak, Escape Artist, and high Agility will make you nearly invisible to enemies. They can't hit you if they don't know where you are.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
Which part of helpfullness is bugged for you?
---
Ah I didn't want to shell out for the 4K monitor. Running 120hz (going higher seems to lock you up in FO76 for some reason) with 1440p and max settings. Oddly the graphical settings just don't seem to change much about performance with a 2080 ti, even running two of the game.
---
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE
---
I have one surrounding my junk vending machine  😈😈😈😈😈
---
So thaaaat’s why I suddenly have been getting randomly invited.
---
Trolls just itching to destroy my 7 story mansion on a mountain top. Good to know.
---
I just drop them free at the overeers camp.
---
I cant start it at all
---
Still have those stretching enemies. Man I miss those bugs lol
---

Lookig good, been talking for a couple days and after being moved up through a lot of people it seems like the devs will now know, and they should have a vid of me showing and explaining that it doesnt work and what happened woth getting the quest beforehand, so hopefully itll be fixed in the next few patches
---
I have a 3* bloodied one that does close to a 1000 with my setup. One of the effects is 25% faster fire rate, which adds nicely to DPS.
---
That makes even more sense. Sorry about that then!
---
I have 3 tiers of pricing: 1/2 or less of list value for things like recipes and common camp plans, list value for slightly less common things like deep pocketed leather limb plans, and whatever I think the market will bear for rare plans like civil war hats.
---
What happened after you talked to the scout master? Just nothing?
---
How do I know for sure? I don't, I made an assumption based on the evidence at hand, which honestly i covered pretty clearly in my post.
---
 "Dude had multiples of everything good"
---
"there's no way all the legendaries were genuine, especially when there were several of the same one " - like exactly the same
---
I'm happy to admit I could be wrong, and really I'm fine with them duping if they were, no one twisted my arm to buy, but you said yourself, more than one = suspicious
---
Oooohh, new skull mask? I took a break right before they introduced brewing and just got back.
---
Makes even more sense to me.  hopefully people will see this and then see what you posted and theyll be better off for it!
---
Nothing
---
No, I just don't concern myself with spending such small amounts of caps. Who cares.
---
Thanks! The only issue at the time they didn't have the codes up for the week yet.
---
The Perforator from Fallout 3 (The Pitt dlc add on)
---
It’s still really strong compared to some other ranged attacks from other animals.
---
That makes so much more sense. Thanks for responding. Like I said with the other post hopefully people will see this and then read your stuff and my purpose will have been met anyway!
---
Is operation tidy the one where you clean up the toxic waste? If so, then the other one is at Dolly Sods over in the mire. You have to collect bug parts. The third quest is to revive a downed player. There's no quest for this. Just find someone to kill themselves with a grenade and then stimpack them. Sitting here away from the game, I have no idea what helpfulness is and apparently neither do the other posters, so I posted the info of where most people get stuck.
---
Lol I've done this to my buddies. Just one toilet. It took them a few days to notice it
---
Ive kept trying everyday, it wont pop up for me. At first the dolly sods quest was doing that to me and then i logged in one day and it popped up. But this one just wont.
---
BOS lead lined Heavy combat armor. Drifter outfit, grey knit cap, sunglasses, sometimes suspenders and slacks.  The fasnacht witch mask looks cool. I am not wearing power armor as much but waiting for the spikey pa coming soon.
---
I wish I had more students like you in my Sociology class.
---
I really appreciate the PSA.  I was wondering where all these new team requests were coming from. I knew something was fishy. And it really does suck for new, or low level players that just wanna adventure and maybe get a leg up for a bit.
---
^^ This guy gets it. Though I'd still like my merchandise to be available to view for anyone who wants to come back for that rare 3* they can't fine anywhere else.
---
Xergiok?
---
Yeah well thats not what i asked so thanks for wasting ur time and mine lol nice effort tho
---
We need to be vigilant when entering a Venor Camp especially if there is not much to sell in the Vendor's map popup, that would ring alarm bells.
---
I now only approach Vendor Camps from the nearest map location so I don't spawn inside a trap or just stuck inside or in-between some camp infrastructure.
---
Wait, they reworked Morgantown Airport? When?
---
Erghh lvl 257 and i cant even get a backpack lmao sounds like im gonna have to delete this character if i really want it.
---
It could be legit requests... sometimes people add you to give you the wave signal asking you to come to your base so they can inspect items in your vending machines. Just be aware it's a risk.
---

---
Tooany people are taking this duping thing too Srsly, they have helped the market, there's no reason to be paying 40k caps for a gun or armor. That's way too rare. If the drop rate would be fixed there wouldn't be any need to dupe, but they keep nerfing the drop rates which is making people try harder to dupe the few that do drop.
---
A down vote I must of hurt a dupers feelz
---
Search for bolstering, auto stim, and life saving legendary armor, it makes a world of difference if you can keep enough stimpacks.
---
So stop going out of your way to tell me how little you care.
---
They do not have the resources to employ the staff, simple as that... I'd imagine.
---
Nah, it's good.  People are going to reply to this post too, just adding more answers to your question.
---
You can on XBOX by searching for "recent players".
---
The current dupe method doesn't work with plans. It involves buying and selling
---
It does eat into the budget slightly. It’s barely noticeable, but when you’re completely at max budget, the machine won’t let you place anything else for sale, even if it’s already in your stash. Happens to me all the time. Usually deleting just one decorative item let’s you place a bunch more stuff for sale.
---
No probably not, but as i said they had multiples of the exact same 3 star legendary weapons, 3 or 4 of maybe a dozen types, same for the armour. The game is more random than that.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
That is a good one.....lol
---
This guy gets it.
---
I am on PC good sir
---
I was expecting to see a radroach and ant going at it... was ready to laugh :)
---
The P to the C
---
It gives more resistance than pa. Pa removes all effects from armor and so does this, its just a pain to put it back on later. And pa uses a reource to use it while the suit does not.
---
An argument is there to be made for dedicated pa users get no down sides. But they have to invest into inteligence a bit more.
---
Beast!
---
Np I love mix matching sets. Helps give PA a personality and stand out when you don't have a crap ton of atoms to blow on paint jobs.
---
A friend of mine had a problem when we were doing the quest together where he wasn't told to grab the mutagenic waste, the quest didn't further after talking to the scout master. He came with me to where you are suppose to collect the waste because I had the quest correctly progressing. He Logged off and back on and the quest fixed itself? Does that maybe help at all?
---
I would do archer athlete and swimmer those are the easiest
---
Look it up online
---
Lol
---
That is probably why, I'm on PC and it happens nearly every mob group at least once in them. The issue is, a lot of the time, you kill it, and the body disappears and that's it, no others spawn in or anything. Just that body just disappears pretty much instantly without any others spawning. 
---
I know about the  body disappearing when it respawns, but this isn't them respawning. It happens without any new ones spawning in. Best example where it happens almost every single time for me is at the little building east of sugar grove with the 4 ticks in it. If I go and kill those 4 ticks, at least 2 of them will despawn before I get a chance to loot them.
---
With the ability to decorate our camps with items, this may be somewhat mitigated so long as they don't make each item eat up much, if any, CAMP space. 
---
Weapon racks, armor racks, and the ability to place other items on shelves and in display cases (cmon bobble-head display) would go such a long way to making our camps feel like a lived in space instead of a minimalist hellscape where the only thing to do is sit on a broken couch and stare at the wall.
---
This is an everyone problem if I'm expected to hide away my rare stuff from your view.
---
What about those of us that actually looted explosive energy weapons before they stopped dropping? 
---
Too bad for us?
---
Same. Full charge fusion cores at 90 caps? Not one gone yet, nobody visits my camp lol
---
I should probably move it nearer to whitespring
---
Ah, now I see why you can't complete helpfulness. You have no idea what it is...
---
&gt;Yea hurt feels, because fat boy makes it a math coherence problem
---
Glad to know I'm renting out a huge amount of your miniscule brain space. LMAO it is a math problem dum dum. 
---
Well maybe it's an electrical problem because there's clearly a short between the couch and your controller.
---
Monitor? I wish, I've lost all of my computer corners as each sprog appeared, now I'm stuck in the living room. Having to rough it with 55" 4k60 TV. Which is fun and all, but I can't get any play time till they all clear off to bed!
---
I just stopped playing tbh. The upkeep/grind of this game vs time actually playing the game is uneven. It's sad too because I was having a good time, but found myself logging on to farm springs for 3-6 hours a day and really started to question why I play. I hope it gets fixed but my hopes aren't exactly high either.
---
Unfortunate, I wish you luck.
---
Yeah maybe, but as i said they had multiples of the exact same 3 star legendary weapons, 3 or 4 of maybe a dozen types, same for the armour. The game is more random than that.
---
You’re still in my mentions kiddo.. I’m not going out of my way you’re still in my damn way, move along
---
No it’s budget. If you’re at max budget, even if the item you want to sell is in your stash, it won’t let you sell it. This has happened to me very often, just hours ago actually. Still had plenty of stash space and items to sell were in my stash, couldn’t sell them
---
Archer I need to kill 50 things but I need more resources to craft 50 bolts.  Athlete is completed Swimmer I failed 3 times due to the stupid creature.
---
You on ps4?
---
Yeah, it sucks.
---
I had a great experience once accepting a random invite (something I never do) after following this player around for a while. Something about him just projected ‘possibly helpless’, and it must have provoked something in me, despite having no kids. He invited me into a party and I joined (something I never do, after 20 years of dick pics and abuse). Sure enough, some little boy. I gave him an assaultron helmet and showed him how to use it, some utilitarian stuff, sone pointers, an eventually had to quit playing. Cute kid.
---
Getting my base trashed repeatedly killed accepting random invites. I’ll never do it again.
---
Have you done the new sheepsquatch and scouting stuff yet?
---
This- 
---
 You can get these done in a session and a half. Note: craft a low lvl crossbow so it breaks faster.
---
Mabey it's a feature.
---
Yeah I don’t get it &amp; if someone felt overcharged they could literally msg me &amp; barter but no one barters these days.. they see the price &amp; walk away if they don’t like it.. gimme an offer man I want rid of these things I won’t bite😓
---
Very true! but hes not talking about zooming in
---
haha. He probably went from "damn creepy stalker" to "ohshit my hero 'O'!". Now thanks to you, his one goal is to get the " **Mysterious Savior"** perk.
---
But PA in general has more downsides than no PA, especially with all the legendary armor running around these days. Idk, i understand the point though. I still want to try it out just because!
---
&gt;On a whim, I threw all the treasure maps I have on there for 10 caps each, to see if anyone is interested.
---
Two suggestions here: If you're on xbox, send me your gamer tag and I'll buy all your maps for 15 each.  If you're not on xbox you should raise your prices. I sell my maps for 20c for forest and TV, 25 for ash heap and divide, and 30 for mire and bog, and they sell nearly as fast as I can list them.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I'm an energy weapon rifle build so they're the only way my build is viable, I'm in the same boat my guy.   
---
The Tesla Rifle with explosive and a semi barrel just becomes a good rifle with high durability and decent damage
---
That might have been me buying the plan... as a builder I was really annoyed to be missing some of the fastnacht plans. 1000c is probably my upper limit of what I’d pay for a plan, if I was desperate and that’s the only one I’m missing... (but I’m still missing some...)
---
Wolf Horde event in forest can give you some low-level items if you keep an eye at map
---
teleport to the event near night time. Camp Adams. Tha tbeing said, we did ours during the daytime, so as long as its between dusk to dawn, i think it'll engage.
---
This man hasn't done a Whitesprings run.
---
If you're on xbox I have something like 1300 .45 available for 1c each right now. I'll probably be on in an hour or so.
---
There’s a lot of upvoted misinformation here. You’re right, items marked for sale eat into your build budget. So even if you have 200lbs left in your stash and the item you want to sell is in your stash, it won’t let you actually sell it if you’re at max budget. That’s just a fact, I have a shop in game and just hang out there player vending and vending in person all day long.
---
Oh, if I were you I'd try to get a Tse laser rifle, much better IMO. If you're on Xbox one we could possibly arrange a trade
---
It'd give all the instruments I'm trying to sell some actual value.
---
Found Trumpets, Guitars, Harmonicas, but we can't even turn them into Weapons.
---
Same, I doubt I'll ever buy another game from them after this. I no longer trust them after the numerous lies they've been caught in with this game. Why would I want to buy a game from a developer who doesn't respect me as a consumer? They don't care about making sure people with disabilities can play, no color blind mode, no text chat for deaf or those with speech impediments, no way to zoom in on small fonts for those that have bad vision.
---
This whole game has just left a very bitter taste in my mouth in regards to bethesda as a game studio. As someone who used to actually spend time in Wv I was actually looking forward to this game and was extremely excited for it. Now? I'm just sad, sad that a game that could have been amazing was just ruined through either sheer incompetence, or laziness. Either of which are not a good thing and makes bethesda look very bad, and rightfully so.
---
You actually can lock them in your camp - and trap "friends" in there
---
Same.  With the new addition of figuring out the most caps-efficient way to fast travel to all the available camps.
---
I bugged into a person's house before it fully loaded then used his vendor when it appeared.  I noticed the entrance was rigged when I tried to leave.  I agree: funny, but shitty.
---
You get a exclusive worthless Anti-armor roll so there's that
---
Lmao I wish I had this problem.
---
I've noticed this as well. I play on xbox
---
See, Nancy, if only you'd hush you wouldn't have this problem.
---
No I didn’t finish that one till I was a higher lvl. I think it might have been Blade of Bastet. I died so many times at the golf club I steered clear for quite awhile.

---
Personally using cdkeys and activating it thru a vpn would be the best choice imo. Got mine for 17 CAD that way.
---
Thats funny cuz you dont know how to be helpful 🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Probably, but I'd say it has as much to do with a lack of object tracking more than that.  I don't think they have an audit trail in place for transactions (including sales, drops, and 'poofs' (not that you can exactly track those).  I seriously doubt they have unique ID tracking to keep track of specific objects (which would help with duping, if implemented correctly).
---
Even if they had the manpower, I don't think they have the ability.

If you read his replies in here, he actually is talking about zooming in. He just didn't think about it, until someone else mentioned it.

---
That’s amazing
---
Because it's not feasable. 
---
Do you think it would be wise for any governent to add gps chips on all coins? So you can find them if/when you lose one? Nah, it's not, and that's why there's no tracker for items. It would end up taking way too many resources. 
---
As to why support won't help you with these issues it's simple, people lie. They lie a lot. 
---
If support would give items to every single person that opens a "missing item" ticket everyone will just send fake tickets.
---
Btw, it's kinda your fault if you lose items during trades now. Just put it in a vending machine...
---
Exactly. It's gear in a game and nothing else. If anything duping has helped the player base access cool items and lowered prices like you say. 90% of players I trade with have the classic 2* TSE handmade, and they're not even that good. My 1* bloodied is far, far better.
---
The self righteous reeeeeeeing is hilarious. It literally does not matter, and doesn't hurt Anyone or anything.
---
And when you lose half of your stash because those weapons are deemed to rare or your build gets nerfed because some random jackass on Reddit doesn't like it we won't have any sympathy for you :\^)
---
Hmmm so i think what ur sayin is that i need to team up with someone as they finish the quest maybe itll finish for me too because its glitched out and wont show me what i need to do but in reality its there? Lol its hella confusing ive tried everything but that and reinstalling my game. Ill give it a try, just need to find someone who hasn't done the quest
---
Last night me and a buddy encountered two Scorchbeasts fighting two legendary sheepsquatches when two glowing deep Kings decided to join in as well. Sheer chaos.
---
Are you on PC? Using mods?
---
10/10 would read again 😂
---
sorry man. I dont mean to, but i do have a couple thousand you could buy
---
Really? I've done Breach and Clear so many times and never got anything more than a Meteoric Sword. I'll have to work on that a bit more I guess, thanks.
---
please give us billboard items too. give us colored squares of paper that we can make pixel art
---
What system are you on? I think I have strengthed raider limbs plans that I'll sell cheap if you're on xbox.
---
Does it work with hats or helmets?
---
Sure this might happen but I enjoy helping others and you will miss people like me helping you out if all of you stop taking join requests. If this does happen.. immediately exit the game and that will stop damage to your stuff. Don't stop taking team requests, this kills the community.

put a conduit on a mat, attach wire, the wire will go through anything. youre welcome
---
I've read somewhere there a bug that is causing the game to try and place you in the same server you just left rather than a new one.
---
Apparently, when tour stuck in a loop (2-3 server hops and still can't place camp) you have to completely close the game and restart.
---
I can't confirm but have seen a few people post about this.
---
Then again, you may be in a popular spot and be better off moving to your camp.
---
Bone chimes literally hanging all over... lol
---
Yeah it does. It takes the lower face slot (bandanas, surgical mask) and the eyes.
---
these guys are right, the mat trick is one of the easiest things to deal with when handling power going through walls or to places that just dont want to 'just work'.
---
I need to test if a certain trick from FO4 that at least used to work in 76 still works...
---
I obsessively go to each camp with plans, only to find most selling low level cooking recipes or workshop rewards. Any level of differentiation would be a damn delight. I primarily sell harder to find or deprecated (Fasnacht) plans, so hopefully people stopping by aren't quite as disappointed.
---
I'd agree, although in my defense, I only sell quest-necessary apparel (chef hats, swimwear, clown hat/costume, beer hat, etc) so hopefully it's not as big a nuisance for people that travel to my CAMP looking for "armor".
---
Yeah, title is a bit off. Should have said maybe that the zoom feature doesn't appear to increase the distance you can tag creatures for credit.
---
I'm hoping to revive someone in water and kill two birds with one stone.
---
I did the sheepsquatch impostor stuff, I was still playing when the barrows opened up but didn't go when I read it wasn't instanced and filled with people clearing it out at all times. I just kind of lost interest. I played since beta, I do enjoy the game itself, but I am tired and uninspired with the constant grind. I was trying to get a silencer for lever action rifles from crafting and breaking the guns, and after about 30 or so with no luck I just gave up. It's crazy that the only way to learn it is to craft and scrap guns. No recipe, and hell, you can't even have someone craft and trade you the mod like they were in FO4. I'm going to pick it up again in the winter when I am tired of everything else I have been playing and see what's new. The backpack, scrip, and sheepsquatch stuff sounds fun, but not fun enough to jump back in right now. I want a backlog of content before I jump back in.
---
I think gas masks take both the head and face. It takes up the face slot, so you can wear hats but not bandanas or glasses.
---
Not if you are in pacifist mode. There's no reason to ever have it off in adventure mode, except for workshops.
---
I enclosed my acid extractor and sure enough people spawned in there...lol
---
This also works with wall signs last I checked.
---
same, and it was my first time. I got LITERALLY FUCKING NOTHING. 
---
The lack of any basic testing for this thing is pretty egregious. Just like the amount of things you have to do for regular possum badges. Its just not acceptable.
---
I admire the desire to give them away, but that seems like a waste of stash space. Personally, I sell .45, 5.56, 2mm EC, plasma rounds, and shells for 1 cap each, and everything else gets dumped at the train stations because I don't want to waste stash space (or vending machine slots) on something like .38 or 5mm.

Hey chief, the symbol is actually the symbol of chemical warfare, one of the chief killers in warfare throughout the past 120 years as well as one of the premier weapons of mass destruction. It makes perfect sense for it. Chemical weapons are terrifying and incredibly difficult to combat.

Gt: LordOfApalachia I’m 21 but play with a few older men. Aged like 40-60. We are very relaxed and high level 180-250
---
I'm on xbox a d my game does that thing in your pic. Also since the last patch random buildings just don't spawn in right. Usually a table or chair is missing or in bad cases entire walls or most of the building is missing.
---
I can make you one free of you're on PC
---
Last week I wanted to grind for the backpack,  Wednesday night and Thursday night I played to 4 am, and woke up at 7 am for work still each morning
---
😥
---
Maybe a requirement should be saying panda gang 5 times 😂
---
There's also locations that spawn a crossbow. I just grabbed them and repaired those.
---
Outstanding move.
---
I have one, but im interested in acquiring another. One is none and two is one after all, how much you looking to trade?
---
graphic rendering - had that for a few weeks,but only at my camp.have to go away a bit and then turn back -ok for rest of session.
---
freezing :- server connection. every movement has to transmitted to server,lose or momentarily drop - all stop.
---
remember , you aint plugged directly into server. there is a load of shit between you and it.
---
Yes, I my son put them on for me and they dont work
---
The standard and gas mask with goggles only takes up the face so you can wear a hat, so you never know with Beth
---
It gets cheaper the closer you get.
---
not the first time I give a heads up on this, but if you are on PC, this mod is a great help for this kind of situation (and even more) by adding icons in front of all items.

A Mirelurk Queen couldn't take him down even though I already took his legendary health bar away.
---
Is the hat attached or can it be worn independent of the suit and vice versa?
---
You can find a already half broken crossbow at that meditation event place in t hbe north of the savage divide. And another one at the Sons of Dane compound behind the locked door with the power armor.
---
Does it follow raider plans?
---
Not to mention most of the challenges are bugged, even ones from day one are STILL broken.  I've also noticed they haven't been adding new challenges to any of the other categories as of a few updates ago.  Just the Daily and Weekly now.  Combat challenges used to update but now they don't anymore.
---
I'd be interested in trades, but I'd gladly take 20k
---
This is such a ridiculous answer.  You really should be ashamed and think about what you're saying.  Put it in a vending machine for an item for item trade?  Please tell me how that works genius. Also I've played online games that did replace items.   I didn't exactly just dream it up.  Yours was such a dumb reply.  I can't believe I even answered it
---
Could say the same about another person in my mentions not leaving me alone
---
I say Winterspring FAR too often... 15 years of World of Warcraft has truly warped my brain.
---
Sick
---
Thanks to the dupers we have good stuff. That stuff never drops for the majority of us. I'm sure everything I have e has been duped at one time. I could care less. Dupe away I say. I need some better armor btw.

---
Not for me.   
---
I have anti armor, explosive gatling plasma. it cuts right through enemies like butter, including SBQ in 2-3 cores.  (since the energy update, my weapon has never broken during a SBQ, its more likely ill run out of cores) 
---
A standard Gat plasma is getting some AA properties (if im recalling) but not nearly as much as this one does. (i think the reduction with the normal plasma AA is something between 50%-75% DT reduction, as the legendary sets it to 50% reduction alone) 
---
The explosive just makes it even more devastating. 
---
This may be an isolated weapon type since its not a ballistic weapon.
---
Not to be that guy but I haven't many people mention it, the symbol on the chest and shoulders are the symbol for chemical warfare, one of the scariest weapons of the 20th century 
---
Fusion cores are pretty plentiful for a 90 cap price tag
---
I have a 2 star weapon with a third star perk as the second star.  That should be proof enough
---
just go try it?
---

---
Sounds like its time for a fresh install of the game.
---
No thanks, I like where my camp is at lol
---
They're working on it. Last patch notes say this will come in a few weeks.
---
So. . . If I have this right, when you complete one of the tadpole "world challenges" ( code breaker, athlete etc..), you are not getting credit for them i.e. stuck at 1/4? Or is it not popping up at all on the right hand side of screen for your tasks/objectives? And this is a really stupid question (so don't shoot me), but did you check under data and missions? Check it and then uncheck it? I had the kiddie corner daily bug out on me last night. It was telling me I had 4/5 messes to clean/collect. Even though I had done them all. Fortunately a server hop fixed that though.
---
Reason why my budget is always maxed. Had a friend who would just write penis all over peoples camps
---
check how vending machine works before you whine.
---
Obligatory reddit "gIt guuD" reply... CHECK!
---
What an especially useless Legendary. ;)
---
Thank you!!
---
I agree completely. I still love this game but it could have been so much better and much more accessible.
---
the accessibility really bothers me the most. anyone with disabilities has paid the same price yet doesn't even get to play the same game. it's not only unfair it just lacks basic compassion for fellow humans. I don't want to support a game company that CAN do better. (other game companies do so I know it's possible).
---
so yeah, they are *lazy, unable or unwilling*. I'll remember this and hard pass next time.
---
Ha, unfortunately, I'm on PS4. I've never really used them - I'm close to a filthy casual in this game, and there is soooo much other stuff to do, and I'm still only in the 80s for levels. I've only had them for sale for about 3 hours, so I'll definitely bump the price up if they sell quick.
---
Toilets? 
---
Na I build ashtray. They are smaller and harder to remove. You can also fit lots more.
---
Put it in a locked room with windows
---
I listed a perfectly preserved pie for 9999 the other day as a joke, and someone actually bought it. For every person out there who would call you out on silly prices there's an equal but opposite person who will laugh at your joke and buy them because they have more caps than they know what to do with.
---
The All American from Fallout New Vegas
---
Yeah that's definitely the problem. Mods will require changes for every update that Bethesda releases, or they'll cause problems like this, or falling through the ground. Your son should help you remove them.
---
Ive done all the objectives other than helpfulness (when you finish the quest its called repeatable operation tidy after). It just wont let me start the quest, i talked to one guy here and maybe its visually glitched out and if i can team up with someone and get them to finish the quest it might finish for me to. Other than that the other option i have is reinstalling my game i suppose
---
It doesn't look like it took too long. It was only from the mansion to the north of the lake.
---
Unless he was really scouring the area.
---
Nice list. I am reasonably sure though, that the Chemistry-Perk does not influence your output of stable flux, Super Duper does though.
---
Yeah, but I want the title lol
---
This isn't new. Just more complex that prior methods than were patched out.
---
Crap. This is the week to accept random invites, too to get the legendary challenge. I guess I'll just do my accept-then-immediately-disconnect move for my remaining 3.
---
If you can't find someone who hasn't finished the quest maybe just go to the location of where the mutagenic waste is and relog?
---
Many people forget to turn pacifist on after playing survival.
---
Ingenious and totally diabolical!  I don't think I would go into a room with a pressure plate I couldn't disarm, but hey, some people like to live on the edge.
---
For what it's worth I was unsure about the burrows but I went through solo when when I was the only one in the area and it was a refreshing "oh shit I could die" area (I don't like the "I died three times trying to kill this boss method of play, dying = losing for me), it's nicely laid out maze of locations and the end fight is a bit of a challenge if you don't have a 1 shot kill meta build.  
---
See you in a few months :)
---
I can confirm it doesn't work for me as well. But it will hit WS bots and cause a scene.
---
It looks like it still weighs nothing so maybe the effects still apply but the text is gone?
---
Eh, just go buy some high value plans for PA that you don't already own to knock down the caps you have, and get closer to knowing every plan.
---
The production terminal at the enclave bunker sells it for under 200c. I’ve been server hopping a bunch to buy tons of these plans to sell in my vending machine. People have paid between 500c-1000c for them not realizing they’ve been added. I sold a couple like this but felt bad for ripping people off. So now I give them away with bigger purchases.
---

Ive tried that before. Ive ran to multiple spots where its located and it wouldn't pop up. I couldn't see the mutagenic waste either.
---
But if they’re wearing an outfit anyway you can’t tell.
---
If you see me on a server, feel free to send a friend request or team invite.
---
Just completed the revive bit. It's easiest if you find someone to melee you to down, then join the team again and revive. They had to join the team or their only option offered was execute, but I had the option to revive them even when I wasn't on the team.
---
If you're in deep water it seems to be an instant kill, so beware and stick to the shallows.
---
I was in a queen fight yesterday. I'm only level 46 so I stood way far away and was taking pot shots with my sniper rifle. I definitely hit her many, many times. Got the EXP when she dropped. But she wasn't lootable? :(
---
Yes i heave this on xbox one x,verru irritating,have tried uninstall bit dous not work,its super laggy/stuttery
---
I'm not debating the intelligence thing, I'm aware of that. But I've seen garbage rewards with high charisma from unyielding gear and I've gotten multiple legendary spawns in a single location with middling Luck. So I'm inclined to believe it's still RNG with confirmation bias.
---
It's a deal friend, see you in WV
---
Plans, serum, ballistic fiber, screws.
---
Where are you located? I can't speak for everyone, but since I know 90% of the plans I'm not spending 30 caps traveling all the way to east bumblefuck in hopes of finding something I don't have, but I try to visit all the centrally located camps. 
---
That said, if I hover over you and I see dozens of things in addition to plans I'll gladly FT your way and take a look. Either relocate to somewhere closer to the center of the map, or put more stuff for sale to entice people to spend the caps FT'ing to your house.
---
So far I think I have only lost caps twice from maxs caps- Its interesting I think ammo will become something of the new currency.  When I am a near caps go our shopping for ammo always useful and with the bandoleer close to weightless,  556 or 308 or 45 may take over for caps
---
Why was this even downvoted like what?
---
Could also be that the weekly survival weapon challenge can be earned in pve again. 
---
Requires being in group to get.
---
Hmmm. . . Weird, must be a one off bug. Otherwise Reddit would be going crazy over this. I've already finished that part on my character. But my son's character (which sucks, and he hasnt touched in like 2 months) hasn't started any of it yet. If you see me on later and want to, I can try to start it for you on that character. His build sucks something awful though, I doubt I'd be much use trying to get through the challenges quickly lol.
---
That's very kind of you, but I don't want to waste your time since it's easy to find in the halloween store.
---
I'm happy for you. I on the other hand had the game crash to the point where I couldn't get out of the starting vault almost every time I tried for weeks. 
---
Experiences vary but I expected bugs at the beginning, just not as many as I had.
---
... A quick search of this subreddit alone lists multiple hot fixes, one for every patch basically and a quick scroll through twitter finds https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1080538994562289664?s=20
---
So again, either you're unaware of what you're talking about, or you're willfully making stuff up. 76 had enough shit issues, you don't need to fake them this much
---
How dumb are you? People are charging disgusting amounts of money for the good stuff because dupers had access to infinite caps. They would dupe nuka cola for infinite caps. The market is screwed up because of this. This is why bethesda has a 10% tax on player vending. They need to take money out of circulation in order to fix the market.
---
Hey, at least you don't have a ~20 hour circadian rhythm in accordance to store cap replenishment.
---
Do Archer, Hunter, and the Athlete ones. They were super easy. Did it in about 2hrs at most.
---
They likely wouldn't have to rewrite the whole thing. When you load into a world, there is a check done to see if your camp can be placed. This same check could easily happen when it matches you with a world. It just needs to pull your camp coords from the DB, then see if it conflicts with any user's existing camps on that world.
---
This won't prevent the issue from happening 100% of the time though. You and someone else who has a camp within your area could be loading into the same world around the same time you are. Or while you are loading into a world, a user moves their camp to within the area your camp would have been.
---
I don't see a foolproof method, but a check when it matches you with a world would definitely help reduce the number of instances where this happens.
---
ive started requesting team invites again, you can try that
---
This is an a genius idea. Brb I'm gonna make an incredibly unsubtle Death Room with warning signs everywhere and 'free candy' written over the entrance.
---
Pestilence has the biohazard symbol all over it too.  Will have to take a quick look at war and famine when I get home to see if they have any other markings I missed.  Theres a lot going on with their models.
---
So it would make sense if npcs come in the future 👍
---
All good! Friend request sent!
---
Agreed.  I sell both.  3 star armor and unique apparel.  But it would sure be nice to differentiate the two.
---
This is why communism will never work
---
I never repair. Just move your camp and it fixes everything back to 100%.
---
What the hell is a lava wolf?
---
What? If you were 2k away from max, what were you selling 3 Hunter's Long Coats for? Those can fetch 5k or more each...
---
Just sent you a friend request. Yeah the biggest problem is finding someone with voice on to explain what I need. We need a global chat
---
I can't even craft one cause it's bugged :(
---
No, I believe that renaming is only for what your character sees.  When you trade or vendor an item (and I'd assume it does this for dropped items as well), the custom name is removed.  I don't know for certain if another player sees your custom name when you're simply opening a trade window, that would be something to test, but I'd assume that even then it only shows the original name (to help prevent spoofing items).
---
Don't want to spend atoms on a item that I would never use
---
Same for me. I had to clear out decorative items/crops in order to list items, even though my stash had plenty of space and the items were already in the stash.
---
You're not alone. Menu lag is terrible but fortunately not on all servers.
---
&gt;  I'd also like a "make an offer" feature, to allow for a bit of bartering,
---
I used the little letters to make a sign on the wall next to my machines that says "Wanna haggle? msg me", and it seems to work pretty well. People will shoot me an offer for something, and I'll pull it out of the machine and sell it directly so that BGS doesn't get a 10% cut.
---
If you're on PC you might have to add your discord ID or something since there's no built in message service like consoles, but I'm sure you can figure something out.
---
Try placing all of them down. Perhaps that's just a visual bug?
---
Same.  People hit me but shock doesn’t start PvP.
---
Not faking anything, I distinctly remember the nukes not working for a week. You are acting like it happened on the new year, it didn't. It was an issue prior to the new year, that is why it was nearly a week without nukes: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aber4o/so_i_guess_nobodys_going_to_be_doing_scorched/
---
also kind, not a waste of time ;)
---
It's both. It's stored in your stash and uses stash space, but it's still "adding" an item to your camp and uses camp space.
---
Probably won't run into it if you're just close to max camp, cuz they use very little, but if you're at 0 camp space it will definitely not let you list items for sale, even if they're already in your stash AND your stash has plenty of free space.
---
Ummm...... No, that's not how it works, you're a special breed of stupid if you think that's how it works. Economics is basic supply and demand, now that there's more of this gear in the market, people can't charge ridiculous caps for it. Yes, Bethesda put in a cap sink, but that's not because of the dupers, that's to take caps out of circulation to keep them valuable. Charging 40k caps for a handmade was giving people infinate caps. When players have maxed caps over 6 characters from doing 1-2 deals, there's a problem.
---
I like that idea. Seems doable too. Just select which camp you'd like to load upon entering a server.
---
You go to the Gulag as well mate! You're just a bad person for using one.
---
I will look you up. Thank you for the reply. My GT is Atomic Punk 152.
---
Not to be "that guy" but rotating the earth faster doesn't get it to revolve around the sun faster. Unless..
---
I think the all of the instruments should play a different song depending on what region you are playing them in. Give us a different composition for the Mire than there is for the Forest. You could handle this via plans and let people build a Mire Banjo or a Forest Banjo and so on for each one. That system could then be further expanded upon for the creation of "solo" instruments where you could be playing leads and solos on the given instrument based on what the CAMP owner has constructed.
---
That's a great idea
---
If it is, it certainly isn't a common one. I googled Atomic Symbol and it showed up once as the 48th picture and I couldn't find another one after that.

I will have to look you up. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
ohhhhhh interesting ty
---
Haha sweet that would help, im on ps4 if you are too. Ive seen some post, rarely, about this but no one really addressing the issue. It probably only happens to 1/1000 people lol who knows. What i do know is that im fu*ked on this character lol
---
what if they dont?
---
My 2nd character had no problems
---
Exactly. If it WAS spotless I probably would have been pretty excited about it. I think the downer from seeing the current version kind of has me wanting more than I would have originally Bern happy with lol
---
I buy Serum Recipes then sell said serums I hope to eventually know them all.
---
Why not both?  I'd love to see people cussing at the claw game trying to fish out a nukashine.
---
You don't know how to be grateful for someone trying to help
---
I think it's fine at 800
---
Ok so what is this post for
---
Request sent
---
Currently not in use 3star suppressors faster reload and bashing damage. Yes I know it's a crap roll. But it's the only 3 star Gauss that I've looked. Currently with 1/1/1 rifle perks it sits at 204 damage. I've moved away from the Gauss and when shotguns/hvy pa build. But still keep the Gauss in my stash
---
If you could cram different flowers in the beak for different temporary stat increases that would be sweet.
---
 It is just gonna stay a problem for many people
---
I doubt that information is currently being fed to the map (to save on data loading).  Adding just the junk base count to the feed probably wouldn't be an awful lot of extra information (as opposed to loading all the stats for each individual weapon, armor, just item, map, etc. etc.).  Seems like something that could be done if enough people call for it.
---
Yeah, i'd rather not have my AAE Cryolator get deleted. 
---
It's only level 35, but like, deleting items from legit people doesn't anything besides piss off a big portion of the fanbase.
---
Especially since there's plenty of other nonlegacy high value items that people dupe.
---
Oh, yes. That started happening to me after the last patch. Had half a base built and placed something wrong and couldn’t take the mistake back. Had spend more caps and start over.
---
Give me a slate - I shall write my West Virginia Odyssey
---
I'll look you up as well. Looking to launch my first SBQ nuke and would like to have a team ready to go!
---
Same with the football uniform.  I would love to wear it around and look like an idiot but it's under armor.
---
Well, I certainly didn't want it to have hot rod flames or anything. I was thinking maybe a couple skulls as shoulder plates OR one on the faceplate. However I would have been pretty happy with it if it was actually clean and not just a dirty set of white power armour.
---
'Nerf mutations because I don't have any. Nerf bloodied because nasty man killed me. Nerf that perk because I choose not to use it'. 
---
These people are akin to the regressives that call for censorship and deplatforming. 
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
Yeah, I know a bit about networking, since I'm working as a devops. My ISP is pretty stable and I play a lot of online/multiplayer games and very rarely have lags or disconnect issues. It would be also first game where bad networking would halt all rendering :U.
---
He didnt try to help at all actually. He didnt even read what i said. All he read was 3/4 tadpole and started talking lol... sheeps
---
That would fix duping, but it would absolutely murder the entire market place. There are a lot of players who legitimately buy and trade rare items that would immediately leave the game.
---
What level are you, and where are you on the map? If you're in the starting area, walk up to Morgantown. Between the train yard and the airport (inside and out) there's probably 80+ scorched. Kill them all and gather all their shit weapons, and then drag your over encumbered ass to the airport vendor or the train station and sell them all. 
---
Sure, you'll only get 3-5 caps each for their pipe guns and crappy shotguns, but when you sell 50-100 of them at that price the money adds up.
---
If you're a high enough level to handle glowing mole miners, go to Blackwater Mine. There's 8-10 miners out front, and 20-30 inside. Kill them all, gather up all their crap, and trudge down the hill to the train station. You can get anywhere from 10-30 caps each for all the gauntlets, shotguns, and missile launchers they're carrying.
---
I used to wait until they were busy crafting, and then drop a wine bottle or two next to them and wall them off with brick walls. Shout " yes for the love of God!" And run away.
---
Cool, I'll be on in an hour, 2 tops. Have to do some light grocery shopping first
---
I'm failing to understand the comedy. Is it funny for someone to be interested in mythology and have a favourite character among a group?
---
I'm visiting vault 76 a lot more than I used to.
---
Bugged.
---
Good to know its not just me. I did notice that when I'm on my low lvl alts I dont have an issue really. Must be all the stuff in my inventory, even though I tried to fix that by dropping all my unnecessary notes and holotapes.
---
that I'm a duper and I found out what's gonna happen with me in hell
---
I got these weapons before the duping started and it cost me very much and i'd be extremely pissed if they just got removed
---
Is that a router?
---
***Insufficient camp budget***
---
Ini file changes?
---
Stealth boys?
---
Or load it up with teddy bears, that'd be amazing :D
---
That is... Exactly what was fixed... On January 2nd... One day after it broke... On Midnight of January 1st... That post was made on January 1st...
---
Where is your camp located? I have mine cheap but they rarely sell
---
What youre failing to understand, is that plenty of these were obtained legitimately.
---
You say, "very unlikely," but that's just bullshit. Sure, there are plenty of duped ones, but there's also plenty of legitimate ones too.
---
You just sound salty that you never got one when they were available, which was a longer amount of time than you seem to take into account.
---
Get a 2nd wife then maybe? :P
---
o.O Earth going around the sun is a year, not a day. We're talking about day cycle. Lol
---
That’s crazy because I’ve seen them fight a few times, there is a sheepsquatch spawn next to the fissure southwest of white springs and I usually let them go at each other, and then take them down when their health drops low. They do more damage to each their than I do...
---
You mean this one? :)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/boy7kb/something_was_here_and_took_them
---
Could be lots of stealth boys with the right perk card on. Could be another version of this invisibility glitch involving a certain perk card and the chameleon mutation. Not sure exactly
---
Fair enough - I can respect the choice / understand while still being critical of the artists decisions. It's not terrible and I can see it mixing well with the Black Rider one.
---
If there was a something gained by completing the quartet - I'd go for it - even if it was like a doomsday monument or something but I'm guessing they didn't want to piss people off for only buying one 1/4 skins and not getting something 'cool'.
---
Damn, you've missed quite a lot. Glad to have you back.
---
On a side note, is anyone selling Fasnacht plans at a reasonable price on PC? I'm looking for the balloons, hanging snowflakes, hanging ribbons and confetti.
---
Can I ask what you actually have in the stash to fill it up?
---
Are they implying that chemical warfare is hell? The bible says that hell followed the pale rider (Death). Some translations say Hades but that's just the translation. Are they saying the Pale Rider will arrive via chemical warfare? There's a lot going on. Someone at Bethesda got suuuuper into designing these things
---
So why did he take time out of his day to write that giant essay? Was just to piss you off? I think not
---
Also, I'd love a 20 series card, but I like being married and sleeping indoors.
---
There are possible solutions to this, including graphics settings (which you've at least played with some), draw distance, and significantly reducing the length of your friend list.
---
Something like that could also be caused by network 'buffering' for lack of a better term.  If your ping is high or the speed your connection is at fluctuates a lot, it could cause issues similar to that.
---
That should give you a couple more places to look.
---
well i'm not religious to some people that's an actual reality but I just find it weird to have a favorite of something that brings nothing but death and destruction. it's like having a favorite deadly disease. I guess it's just a macabre view.
---
Is there a way to fix it or is my game just doomed forever?
---
The chalkboard someone mentioned earlier seems like an interesting way to get around the issue.  Or, you know, voice comms :P
---
You can wear a hat. Just know that it clips through certain ones like the campaign and cowboy hat.
---
If he removes them all will that take care of my problem ? If I do a reinstall will I lose everything?
---
They're using stealthboys, and crouching/jumping to break VATS. It's gotten a bit too ridiculous for me, I haven't gone back to Survival in weeks.
---
From the most recent dupe method ?
---
Just get rid of all legendaries. Problem solved.
---
When I go to this post it's deleted?
---
I found this out last night. I have plenty of space in my Stash, but my build budget is maxed.
---
Got a message in top left corner that budget limit is maxed or would be exceeding limit. I'll have to take a screenshot of it for the naysayers. 
---
Doesn't make any sense on why it would eat both stash and budget.
---
It really is the worst of PVP and no pvp.
---
All the grief, none of the fun.
---
Yes, and cranberries for cranberry relish/cobbler. Also a new type or greenhouse wall would be cool, and it could maybe only grow specific plants...
---
So they are a fungus and reproduce via spores?
---
For us higher level peeps, it helps us drop or get rid of the plans we already know. I seldom come accross a plan that I don't already know. I love them at the top. I DO agree that when looking at them from the vending point of view the bottom makes sense. Sorting different here than there would make it confusing for those not understanding why.
---
There's a (imho) incredibly sad 'side story' found in one of the towns in the south (slightly southeast) section of the map. It's delivered via terminal
---
I can't remember which exactly (though I am headed there tonight again to do some questing) - but essentially I came down a mountain into a town and found a story that gave me the feels.
---
Usually I find myself impervious to the emotional play but this one got me for some reason. It just seemed so bleak.
---
&gt;!Spoilery extra info: It's about someone leaving for a 'brief trip', waiting for them to return, one's memories of them, and not being able to leave the second floor.!&lt;
---
Just pretend that she was depositing her previous crap legendary!
---
Oh, wow! That makes perfect sense then! You've definitely won me over on the symbol. I'm surprised that's never come up (or if it has, that I overlooked it) in all my years of playing Fallout games. I'm still pretty bummed the suit is just some dirty white T-51 but if it was cleaner then I'd probably be pretty happy with it.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll definitely redact that point.
---
That buzz when you see a new vendor pop up on the map and you rush to ft to them before anybody else. And you spawn in their floor.
---
Dont do this I love trading!
---
Oh calm down. Your list of my accusations are clearly just observations, yeah his camp was just a shop, i'm not accusing anyone of anything with that, it just was, but the set up seemed odd so I mentioned it. The only thing I said was actually dodgy were the weapons and armour.
---
I've not encountered another shop anything like this, what's on offer is always more random and yeah it could be how they want to play, but that doesn't account for the lack of randomness. They had a ton of 3 star legendary weapons and armour, and not one of them was a single unit, they had 3 to 6 of the exact same piece of everything, not variations of the same piece, the exact same 3 stars on all of them. The game is random, this was not, if these items were genuine there would have been some variation in their attributes. 
---
Sure I could be talking out of my ass, wouldn't be the first time, but it seemed off. But as I'm no expert on either the game or how people abuse it and I'm always up for learning something new, so when you say I should do a little research, like what?
---
Sadly I think it will be similar to this.
---
The item itself will be completely random but guaranteed to have the number of stars you purchased it at.
---
I'm with you on the too much stuff to do, so I don't bother with the maps either, but apparently there are some people who are really passionate about treasure hunting. A guy came by a couple nights ago and bought 50+ maps from me and then sent me a msg asking if I had any more.
---
A needed fix to be sure
---
I'd imagine the lag would probably be so bad you'd actually be at a disadvantage if you used it. Especially compared to someone with weapons and healing items hot keyed.
---
No, I was solo. That event is great because people drop like flies.
---
Good question. It’s been like that since I started playing in December. I’ve read that it’s been like that since the launch. People need to upvote anybody talking about this issue. Bethesda owes me some serious atoms.
---
Just delete all weapons.
---
Turn it into Mike Tyson’s Punch Out.
---
I’ll gladly uppercut a deathclaw.
---
Hit start: Boing-boing-BOING!
---
I just use chat and console messaging with no issues.
---
Kill Mole Miners, get two birds stoned with Uranium Fever.
---
I have some for sale in my vendor, &amp; saw another person selling some last night as well so it's worth it to check player shops.
---
You mean like the Easter bunny costume debacle?  Lol
---
And I'm a big fan of Apocalypse media that incorporates the four horsemen myth.  I couldn't help myself but get all 4.
---
Your save files are stored in the cloud, associated with your bethesda.net account. You might lose your photos, but shouldn't lose any save data.
---
A looooooooooooooooot of junk
---
Here’s an even simpler fix. Stop thinking about ‘duping’ ruining the game. Never in my 800+ hrs had another players weapons effected me in any sort of way. This fake outrage and preposterous solutions to non-issues IS the problem. Stop it
---
You want to talk economics? Lets talk about what happens when you just start printing infinite money? Post WWI Germany could not afford to pay reparations, so they just printed more money. As a result, their economy got obliterated by inflation. Dupers did the same thing with FO76. They had access to infinite caps due to duping infinite nuka colas. People are charging exorbitant amounts of caps for items because they know how broken the trading market currently is. They know people still have 100,000 caps across all five characters. That is why prices are the way they are.
---
Charging 40k for something is not giving someone infinite caps. Money is changing hands, not being created from nothing.
---
Im not pissed. Im just baffled that he wasted his time on absolutely nothing... like i said he didnt even read my question... he just started talking about other stuff related to the quest.
---
Because it's a game and we can do whatever the hell we want you utter child. #RAIDERLYF
---
&gt; Armour covers them up and for some reason the pieces become 300% more bulky, like my character is morbidly obese.
---
Gotta fatten up to take the cold.
---
Thank you, i laughed so much at this.
---
Honestly, this situation is incredibly rare. Let your son continue sending invites, 90% of us just want to run around and kill mobs, not other people.
---
The one on the lefts tail looks like a dick
---
Can you wear it with the BOS hood? Sounds like you can considering you can wear the goggle gas mask with the hood.
---
The codes expire at Monday at11:59 UTC, they had Alpha confirmed 21 minutes and bravo 57 minutes after the codes expired.  These Nukacrypt people are amazing.
---
Eh.. I have a bit of room to spare, I'll start culling when that inevitably stops. Besides, the ammo doesn't stay for long. :)
---
You're missing the point.
---
I forget the name of it. But there's a workshop you can mine it at. It's just south of the noobie town. Forget the name of that too. Haven't played the game in a month or so.
---
That's a paddin!
---
Not only that but I cant tell you how many times people refuse to put kindling on the fire. This is the easiest event to do but yesterday I ran out of what I had collected, signaled for the two other players to keep the fire lit and they just... didnt. So it failed. So damn frustrating.
---
Black cowboy hat, Brown asylum uniform, veil of secrets, cap glasses.
---
Patrolling whilst overweight makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
But it is Bethesda where in a release a normal player that REALLY plays the game can find 5 bugs in the FIRST 10 mins of the release.
---
Sorry Bethesda, but your QA department is really sleeping. Use cases they may have, but none of them are REALLY playing the games you make.
---
I have two characters. One is a tough and gruff survivalist that loves cryptids. She wears the Survivalist Outfit, Orange safety Hat, with the orange safety pip-boy paint. I also splurged for the Keep Out backpack, which looks pretty solid.  Her PA of choice is Raider. 
---
The second is a Brotherhood character who wears a BOS officer under armor, full Heavy BOS combat armor, and the BOS jumpsuit over all of that. He also has a F76 Trucker hat. Previously rocked the Red Rocket jumpsuit with matching pip-boy paint but now I use the black paint. His PA is the Ultracite Prototype.
---
Agreed. I even tried starting a new character because I thought maybe because I earned some of my challenges in the BETA it was bugged because of that, however even my new characters challenges don’t work either.  I’ve been playing since the BETA and have put tons of hours into this and where they have fixed other issues, I feel as if this is something that needs to be paid attention to.
---
Nothing says immersion like scorched bodies somersaulting across the map
---
How much do you need?
---
I just got one last night for completing Campfire Tales
---
Try searching my post's title.
---
Nothing should be done about them, they're the only items in the game with any real value and they're the only reason Energy weapons are useful compared to their ballistic brethren. Taking them from people or changing them would cause a mass exodus of the most dedicated players. This would be a move on par with outright insulting your player base. Grandfathering them was the right move and frankly they're the only really interesting weapons on the market because they have real scarcity and make an entire build viable.   
---
Pay 50k for that rifle that's your baby? Too bad we're taking it away   
---
That Gatling Plasma you saved for weeks to afford? Suck it up.
---
Are you still looking for this? I have one for sale.
---
I get the point. He tried to help. You're missing the point. He talked about nonsense. Everything he talked about had nothing to do with operation tidy lol i told him he wasted his time and y'all got butt hurt 😭😭😂😂
---
That's quite different, because it was on the end of a series of flashy garbage additions to a piece of media that was already complete and had been complete for some time. The equivalent would be if Bethesda went to those free copies of Fallout 1 and changed the water chip to a soda fountain.
---
Cry about it some more :\^)
---
[An existential crisis not even solved by death.](https://i.imgur.com/WtpNiso.png)
---
Go farm deathclaws at the dump in the Mire
---
None, I deleted the files to make sure.
---
I’m not saying that some were originally obtained by legitimate drops, but the mass increase in sales at the moment means they are most likely from dupes.....no more hating
---
Like, 25
---
All you had to do was say thanks but you seem to be very inexperienced when it comes to human interaction
---
Yup on PS4. More than likely your on my friends list too, as I believe we've traded a handful of times. Probably be another ~5 hours or so until I'm on though.
---
Another tactic is to join your team, then immediately start building crazy stuff at your camp.  I believe it uses their materials, but it applies to your build budget.     So you have to go through and manually scrap each of these things and hope that you find them all.
---
I do. His name is Buster Hymen.
---
What's your platform?
---
Would love to know as well!
---
I know... that's why I'm on the fence about it.
---
1AM. Wanting to sleep... filthy casual!
---
This can also be used through windows if you find yourself trapped inside a locked base
---
nope crafting 300 boards
---
Do they have to be floating or just standing in it?
---
Put one shot in each with a .38 just the tag them for the XP when they die.. then sit and watch.. :)
---
So who won?
---
I’m on player 3 now and it hasn’t completed for any of them. 
---
OH! Just got alert. Somebody’s nuking prime. Psn jafar_quenton_7 is you want to join.
---
The only fix. Make duping into the unforgivable. Dupe= your console/PC getting permanently banned via MAC address ban. If having an account ban was enough to make the cheaters rage quit before, wait until they can never play again without buying a new rig. Make it cost FAR more than it's worth.
---
the 1% of your player base that is actively engaged in duping and trading in duped items yes
---
yeah I disagree with this 1000%
---
Oh man, I rushed this out right before heady to bed so please fan boy over the game and refuse to admit that there are/were issues with the game.
---
As for the lawsuit, here's a link explanation for why it is a slow process. I had others to actual lawyers but, you aren't worth finding them. https://youtu.be/UeAF1InB0k8
---
Of you don't think knowing that Bethesda planned on using 76 as a pay to play or pay to win is useless info, well fine, but while this sub shows you aren't alone there was and is plenty of reasons that it bothers other people who bought the game. Buying a game at a full game price to only be made to pay to get full access to it ( I'm not talking dlc or expansions but base content) is a growing trend that not everyone is happy with. Many of the item shop items are direct rips from the original fo4 game, and the studio wants people to pay $3-7 for it's use. Like the mail courier suit. While you seem to be fine with it, it is still a point worth mentioning. The main reason I mentioned this is because Bethesda has been seen as a good guy in the gaming industry untill 76. Having the knowledge that BS is starting to emulate anticonsumer practices is something that should be know when discussing why people have issue with this game. If you want to bypass that and ignore it, be my guest, but that doesn't refute it as a point of interest when looking at why other people have a bad outlook towards 76. Just like the canvas bag. Maybe it's not an issue to you but it is an issue with others. OP asked why the game has such a bad reputation, that is a reason. 
---
I probably spelled stuff wrong all over the place as I did this on my phone right before work but most of this isn't for you, it's for OP. And again, if you're enjoying the game good, happy for you, but that doesn't mean there are no issues. Even if you want to ignore them.
---
Lol i had one upside down doing the spider crawl like in the exorcist!! Almost made me quit the game!! 😲😂
---
Good to know!
---
Haha sweet ill see you then!
---
Why would you get upset when your child is exposed to this sort of behaviour, when you're the one who is letting him play a game made for adults lol.
---
Leave nothing but commie whackers
---
Thanks a lot, i'll do more "experiments".
---
Just fast travel away in that situation
---
Got my revive finally last night fighting the cryptid, I was soooooo relieved
---
My god you have no idea how to treat people
---
I would join, unfortunately, I am on Xbox. :(
---
Definitely FO1 &amp; FO2's Plasma Rifle, aka the Plasma Caster from New Vegas. Heck, just give me a long barrel mod on the gatling plasma to do this.
---
Holy snap. Free stuff actually worked in Australia for once.
---
I found some up at Top of the World myself. Not a 100% chance though
---
Seen some northwest of Big Bs Truck Stop in the Mire, there is a small fence enclosed camp/shop that usually has a half dozen ticks there
---
I would be happy for just base weapon type, so I click search on any shotguns and it will have a pip for ALL shotguns, at least I know they have something similar in stock.
---
U need god lol ur delusional
---
You're welcome, and in defense of the coloring of the color it's based on the pale horse from the book of Revelations. Pale horses often mean they're sickly and their coats become spotted and matted and lose their pure white color

Was this in the mire?? I witnessed a four way fight myself! Those are always so exciting to watch and join in as the 5th team.
---
No matter how much u dupe, should be a perminate ban
---
Double reverse- under armor hazmat suit please Beth... Hate having to wear power armor in nuke zones
---
It would be hilarious if the goalie stick was melee but instead of block had a light ranged attack with a wind-up animation of you doing a snapshot.
---
Would have take a solid 3-5 seconds to complete and may not be all that great but the thought of a server in flannel &amp; jeans all attempting snapshotting a SB seems pretty funny.
---
So when a duper sells a weapon to an average person, that's not money changing hands? If you really want to get into it, everyone playing this game has access to infinite caps, if you walk everywhere and don't buy from vendors, the sinks are easy to avoid.
---
 The prices being charged is based on rarity, not the fact that people have alot of caps. Prime example, the AAE handmade, W weeks ago I seen offers for those guns topping 45k, now they are alot cheaper because there's more of them out there. Just that simple.
---
Realistically, if it wasn't for the dupers, there wouldn't be much of a market, considering how few variants of each weapon circulating the most.
---
There's a better market for buyers and sellers when there's more items to deal, the metas don't help either, ass/Sent etc etc.
---
Can you give us a pic as an example?
---
Farm deathclaws or go to the Uranium Fever event and kill moleminers. I honestly didn’t know that moleminers can drop black titanium.
---
I've found 3 naturally because I've played since BETA. Should I be punished because of that?
---
Do nothing about them — other than let them start dropping again.
---
This guys been to the Czech
---
Workaround: Snap stairs to foundation, floor, then stairs back down again and voila, floors in foundation height. You can then just wall off the stairs so they don't look out of place.
---
I miss Dogmeat.  :(
---
Didn't even know I missed that - damn.
---
Explain
---
I have a scale 1-100c 1 cap being common drops and 100 would be PA, weapons, etc.
---
This also explains why I'm constantly stocking my inventory.
---
Delete raznutz from the game.
---
Video? Or other evidence? I'm not saying you didn't get scammed it just merits proof of some sort.
---
Ditto, I move camp a few feet for a handful of caps.
---
So let’s punish those who got the weapons legibly by taking away their guns. Sure.
---
Nice write-up. Good with salt will help your raw flux spoilage for long gathering runs (if you need to farm more high rad fluid or masses) if you gathered flora first.
---
I am bummed the lady in the storage closet appears to be gone. That was a good, chilling thing to find.
---
That’s why the safe bet is to use the vending machine, even for direct sales.  
---
Negotiate a price them put it in the vending machine for that amount.   If they get antsy about doing it that way, then you know that they are more likely to be a Raider....
---
If not that, please fucking add the damn crop patches that they had in fallout 4. I need a level surface, or just some area that’s not 2 square feet that I can use to plant stuff.
---
this patch, I think.
---
I had to create a new character to discover the Cranberry Bog even though my 4 other characters had already discovered it.
---
No i do not have proof😢😢
---
Would not surprise me in the slightest lol.
---
It's in the damn description when you buy it from the shop
---
It was a trade
---
&gt; As for the lawsuit, here's a link explanation for why it is a slow process.
---
Video version of ambulance chasing lawyers bullshit from Jan 30, 2019.
---
Where are the lawsuits?
---
&gt; Of you don't think knowing that Bethesda planned on using 76 as a pay to play or pay to win is useless info,
---
So once again you're going to get buthurt about something they *didn't* do.
---
Please let me actually draw on it with a mouse

Building large buildings take so much "effort", and moving them is a risk like no other in this game. "This place is perfect! Look how flat and expansive it is.... nope. Literally nowhere is a legit spot... wait, it turned green... nope. Intersecting... wait! Whooo I can place it... shit my front door opens onto a cliff." My warehouse is 4x4... moving it cost me a couple hours of wandering and a couple hundred caps the other day.
---
Hell, moving a small camp is a crapshoot.
---
Same here. 800 hours and I still havent "discovered" grafton dam. Pretty sure I might have been there once or twice lol
---
Yeah I was shocked they weren’t in there... but yeah one of those options with the table planters or garden beds for FO4 would be great
---
Iv been blocked can somone message the person to come back an give my gun back
---
Yeah look me up also. I would be up for something like that.
---
Yea dude it was a trade but its turn into a scam
---
48yro lvl195 wasteland lubber here.
---
i'm a solo player to the core, but
---
when i launch my nuke aimed at
---
fissure prime and i'm alone in 
---
what is all of a sudden a huge red
---
dot filled with,
---
enemies,
---
it'd be great to have a crew.
---
all xbox
---
no mic
---
(dog ate it)
---
dont care so much anyway.
---
i camp just down the western slope
---
below the top of the world.
---
bumbullatti
---
       FREE relish...
---
I'm sorry I don't understand
---
Yeah I’d be happy with that, even if we have to have a special perk to use/build them etc
---
For the record it's an Urban pattern, not winter
---
They can’t reproduce at all. In order to propagate their species, they have to kidnap people and expose them to, usually slam dunk them into vats of, the F.E.V. (Forced Evolutionary Virus).
---
I put a post out for a gun the person mad a deal then took my gun
---
My bad, urban sounds cooler tbh
---
I've had it happen on glitchy servers too - even while solo with intelligence 9, luck 6. Ghouls with double drops.  Bodies you didn't even shoot having drops. 75% of non-legendary ghouls dropping... Mainly one star crap of course!
---
Yeah I loved that, why would they take it out?
---
Dude... there are very few of you out there getting 1400 caps a day.
---
What the hell... is this your job?
---
I only wanted a lvl 5 explosive shotgun so my friend can lvl up but nah
---
I’ve had players attempt to destroy my base with this stupid TSE shotguns, but nothing else really. What ticks me off though is the people that constantly try to push pvp because they know they can wipe you quick. I’m one for someone wasting ammo on me, mostly since I won’t attack if I know someone is using a TSE weapon. 
---
I also managed to piss off a few duper-merchants. I kept refusing to buy from them, so they kept trying to attack me. It took 3 of them do really do any sort of damage to me, even then, they still couldn’t do much. Thank goodness I didn’t retaliate.
---
Bummer. What system? If you're still playing You may still be able to get a vid on PS4 just open the share menu and then wait a sec and press square. It'll give you the last 10 minutes of play
---
Should you complain if Bethesda fixes what is an obvious glitch? No.
---
I find that if I place other pieces around it until I find that sweet spot where it will finally snap in place.
---
Fucked this dog if i ever find youbin real life your dead
---
I'm just looking for a feminine hairstyle that doesn't look like a radrat's ass. I get that it's the wasteland but lots of hair (irl) can look good even not combed and such
---
This is worse than the first reply.
---
Did you really down vote me? Bro you got some stones lol.
---
Yet their website never comes up when I do a quick search.. any chance you've got the link?
---
And thanks :D
---
Does anyone at Bethesda actually read these because great ideas like this seem to go in one ear and out the other.
---
Well there are only two genders after all.....
---
No prob. Enjoy the fight!  It gets pretty hectic, I forgot to mention you'll be surrounded by lvl 50+ Major Gutsys, protectrons, and exploding eyebots (don't kill those eye bastards next to yourself or other players)
---
Change that commie badge!
---
I haven't heard of any plans to increase it. But who knows.
---
They said its something to do with consoles and the beta period. Places we found then did not update after game release. Bethesda has said that the only fix at the moment is to make a new character (was a Bethesda response on a post on here a while back)
---
This is amazing. I almost want this to become a regular thing.
---
Edit: the stalking, taking pictures and making a documentary of sorts, not the revive quests.
---
It’s incredibly easy to get 1400 caps in the day. Sell 2-3 mutation serums and you’re pretty much maxed for the day
---
Gorge Junkyard workshop. Resource point is between the house and the workshop bench.  
---
I’ve seen a few folks C.A.M.P.-vending black titanium on PC but don’t recall names.
---
I mean they're sterile not boring.
---
He has a lot of weapon plans it usually seems
---
That would have been really scary!  Lol
---
Good tip. Also, the signs and letters plan steel letters can be placed on the vending machines themselves. I labeled all 4 of mine as Weapons; Armor/Clothing; Chems/Serums; and Junk/Scrap/Flux
---
Shouldve waited on me man. I have a bunch of low level weapons and im not a thief
---
Sure. Psn xPunkishx
---
Once again... dude... there are very few of you doing this. 
---
I would say the vast majority of players aren't.
---
I'm usually a solo player also but there a few challenges that need more than one player. I'd be more than happy to lend a hand to launch a nuke. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
they're very aerodynamic.
---
Welcome back.
---
Mole miners and deathclaws drop it.  The "Breach &amp; Clear" event will also give you a fair amount of ore, and the Gorge Junkyard workshop has an extractor.
---
There are also a handful of deposits of it scattered around, mostly in the Ash Heap.  [Mappalachia](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) can point you in the right direction.
---
45 hrs week plus the time I invest in being the best dad in the world so maybe an 1 hour a night when I can use my TV for something other then watching Pokemon. I craft serums and get 500 caps each at any faction vendor.
---
Again, not a lot of extra data, so that shouldn't be a huge deal.
---
O I'm on Xbox or I would of hooked you up. If you go just a little north east, more east of Superior sunset farm there is an ore spot there. you'll get a ton if you put your camp there. Don't put any turrets though because they're s a couple scorched beasts around. They're only attracted to turrets and generators. They don't always spawn though
---
Wow complicated
---
For sure... but I'd really like to be able to fill my CAMP with the mundane stuff, too. Make it look like it was "once used" for something, you know?
---
An old office building needs desks and chairs and waiting rooms and art on the walls...
---
a warehouse needs shelving and boxes and crates.
---
And so on. All the in-game locations "look like what they once were"... it'd be nice to be able to build something that fits the "feel" of the world.  After a certain level, all the CAMPs I encounter are all pristine and shiny .
---
...and don't get me started on the CAMPs that are supported by stairs alone. It's just kinda… "jarring" in context.
---
I can get 1400c of junk and weapons to sell in less than an half hour of play. I also can craft serums it only takes 3 and a little bit of junk for daily max caps.
---
What are you on about entitled? I never said or implied I was entitled their things or services. Simply that I wish I could rate them based on their services so other people don't waste their time traveling to someone selling 300 spoiled meats for 5000 caps a piece.
---
I couldn't place a pylon... a pylon of all things on a foundation because it was "floating". I found a spot it would drop then just moved it. That seemed to be a workaround on a few items. Didn't work for everything though.
---
Something they put in the game is an obvious glitch? Take your holier than thou bullshit elsewhere.  
---
They made a mistake, they realized that people would riot so they grandfathered them to be fair. Cry elsewhere because your Munitions factory got taken by a big bad man.
---
Totally!!! Hate that movie!! Lol creeped me right out!! And to see this thing coming at me gawd!! Haha
---
Yes, mine are on XB1. One challenge says 4/5 discovered and that I’m missing Valley Mall, even though I’ve discovered and cleared it of scorched MANY times.
---
thanks request was sent
---
It definitely crossed my mind. Melee builds are a bit lazy and annoying to me. Especially back in the old days with events. Would you fucks stop hoarding around everything so I can shoot this thing?
---
A devious revenge plot
---
Yes, being single with no children and having a good job that allows for disposable income is nice =). I paid for mine with donations / youtube earnings though, so there's that!
---
Yeah... Bethesda, this guy doesnt speak for us so please take away his 1400 caps per day please!
---
People complain about repeatedly seeing the same posts but it takes a lot of people mentioning said topic for things to change, hopefully more heads continue to post about this so Bethesda takes note
---
I just turned 40.  My character is level 55 or so?  I am from michigan, so eastern time zone.  CitrousRuby84 is my gamertag.

1400 caps isn't that hard.   One run around top of the world/ pleasant valley picking up and selling all the weapons dropped by enemies, various chems, and higher value junk well net you 800-1000 caps with hard bargain 3.

I like to put neon letters vertically on the left side of the machines spelling out what’s inside. I currently have my 4 labeled “Plans”, “loot”, “ammo” and “junk” since you can only fit about 5 letters in that space. I did have one labeled “shit” and one labeled “tips”, but stuff out of those just wasn’t selling for some reason
---
Done. 
---
ad victoriam
---
Yeah, I don't remember finding one since the first month or two of gameplay. I bought one from a player for 25 caps last week but I put it on my TSE dragon
---
Lol noob
---
As every indie dev, they are short on resources and manpower
---
Outfits already cover any up, and armour itself don't mean shit anyway. It's all about legendary effects, Assassin/Sentinel on Raider limbs would massively outclass non-legendary BoS Combat armour.
---
If youre a melee I have cavalier armor I can trade you on ps4, depending which sentinel you had
---
Standing. I’m not sure you can revive someone if they are floating. Can you??
---
The farther out thing isn’t the problem - it’s the things within range that are acting as if they aren’t.
---
Huh, did not know this, thanks for the heads up. I just assumed no power to them = no selling.
---
I don't think existing weapons should be altered.
---
I've got almost 200 hours in it... farming caps is NOT the main goal of the game to me... or to a lot of others.
---
I  am in the bog and I get super mutant, cave cricket and scorched spawns.
---
I usually kill them while my turrets sit there and do nothing. I also pay many a repair cost. That is how I deal with it
---
camp adams event, wet kindling.
---
I’ve only had it pass once - running around putting kindling on and get bogged down while others just stand and shoot. I just wanna make s’mores :(
---
Yeah, see? That's a build and focus on maxing caps. 
---
My entire point, louder for those who aren't getting it.. is that the OP assumes that every player is doing this. And it ain't so.
---
Hmm can't find the area, just 2 trucks together forming a makeshift camp. I'll keep searching, thanks.
---
The camp alone is the number one thing I would like to see opened up for mods but I don’t ever see that happening.
---
I'm glad to hear it's not just me. This has been SO frustrating!
---
When the "hmmm" meme goes too far and your head pops out of existence
---
I had a cave cricket spawn in my locked bedroom.  I was like wtf.
---
can i at least keep my paddleball?
---
I still don't understand what the word "meta" means in reddit context. Seems like it's used a lot but the meaning is never clear... It's just meta...
---
10/10 would nuke again
---
A couple things.
---
I was going to put up a particularly pricey piece of armor.  After doing the math and realizing it would put me *just* over the cap, I decided to wait a bit.  I could stand to lose a few caps going over, but if a couple other things sold first, that could get expensive.
---
Second, I've *heard* that if you go over on a sale, *you don't get any of the money at all*.  So if I sell a 10K item, and that puts me at 25,001 caps, I stay where I was at and lose the item - a 10K loss.  Now, I haven't verified that, and I've only sen it mentioned once or twice, but that's a *big* risk to take.
---
I'm top right ish, in the spot where you can harvest junk and lead in the same camp. Near the crashed space station
---
Bethesda listens
---
Bethesda: “no more vendor caps because OP wants it that way”
---
OP: “Bethesda sucks, now I can’t get any caps! Moooommy!”
---
will keep an eye too, but i've done it many times and never spawned scorched ones, but worth retrying, thanks.
---
I've completed it, thanks though ^^ enjoy
---
There wasn't a Tuesday update that I noticed, so I doubt that it's been fixed.
---
You can give me your caps lol
---
I do if I think I can fire up the pc, log into the game, get to a train station, ditch my excavator, pick out my set of +6 charisma armour &amp; under armour, sell everything, scrap my legendaries, back into my excavator, back to my camp, empty the lead extractor, collect all my water, then log out and give the pc a few minutes to dump the heat (water cooled) and shut it all down in the time it takes my wife to walk 300m down the street and back to collect our boys from school. Can bring my buying cycle forward a few hours rather than wait till everybody goes to bed.  
---
I can stop when ever I want though.
---
I'll roll the dice, thanks.
---
This has been my experience as well. They will iist snipe your razorgrain all day long. It's always the razorgrain....
---
Just over the ridge from the downed space station you'll find a post, one spawns near the couch.
---
Plus they have a good swing speed. 1h is fastest, unarmed is medium, and 2h is the slowest.

So far, yes. If you are on PS4 I can mod the black rider one if you want

So you’re saying now that you’ve got your system down and you’re rolling in all the caps they should remove a way for new or lesser experienced players to make caps?
---
yes, I understand that now, and agree that would be a problem for a number of players.
---
She might have just scrapped a crappier weapon she had in her inventory.
---
**NSFW** lmao... Oh Dear.
---
At first you had my curiosity but now you have my attention. Have my up!
---
Are there items players sell for more then $25k caps there are because the value of a cap has been diluted by the steady stream of worthless caps entering the economy.
---
I can't place more than one down at once. But even if I go through one by one placing them down they all match
---
Cant trade atom shop stuff

I took a bad shot of two staring each other down before fighting. This was in the middle of the Free Range event. [https://imgur.com/a/eV07Ve0](https://imgur.com/a/eV07Ve0)
---
Best to wait till lvl 50 to get it, because it scales with the lvl you are when you do the quest.
---
Ran into a guy who could've used it. I had started the Mirelurk spawning event as a level 46. Level 80+ guy shows up to help.
---
I got downed by the queen, as expected, and used the Help emote.
---
Guy came over and I thought he was gonna revive me, but he cannibalized me instead. It was a combo of "that is hilarious" and "wow, you're a real asshole", but immediately after I died he was yelling "Sorry friend! I misclicked! I was trying to revive you!".
---
It took so much restraint to get through finals with this latest update. Now that they're over there is nothing stopping me from staying up till 3 am!
---
Can't downvote this enough, sorry XD. As you have been told,   
---
\-" Most, if not all, of the stuff under that badge is tongue-in-cheek references to Indiana Jones, a very, very fictional archeologist. "

"The bones and teeth of animals are frequently collected in substantial quantities on archaeology excavation sites.""  
---
It's not like the game pursues realism, it's all sci-fi and parodies, so you are nipticking / having the wrong approach to the game. Some "lecturers" in biology, zoology etc could also go full ham like you pointing out the sheepsquatch has no sense etc, so I find this ubersilly.  
---
If you hadn't mentioned the devs in the thread I could care less, but as it is now, you are competing for devs attention against other, much more interesting and needed posts / requests.
---
Thank you for posting! I was wondering what was up when I couldn't VATS the bloodbugs!
---
You do realise you couldn’t give the armor back to him if you mod it with atom shop items, right?
---
Also on one of the defence platforms on the south side of grafton dam.

Nice. I tried telling my wife that there's money to be made from online video but she just sees it as me and the boys wanting to play more video games, which isn't *technically* wrong...

They will eventually come back, you just need to wait .. I can only imagine how much money they losing by doing it this way ..
---
You're lucky, I can get only half my CAMP in a blueprint... They broke the system MANY patches ago and have touched on CAMPs many times since then but never bothered to fix it....
---
You used to be able to simply click on the part of your CAMP and select all then individually select what didn't get mass selected already. Now it's a pain and a half and they don't even bother to put it in the known issues thread???
---
We can get caps by selling and buying items between players.
---
Dude. If you don't get the hint it's your fault. But anyway, i'll spell it out for you: trade for caps!
---
Btw, you never mentioned of any item to item trades in your first post.
---
Also you seem to have a history of failing to understand game mechanics and you seem to lack something called "common sense".

If your average player can’t get caps from vendors anymore, you wouldn’t be getting many sales cause they’re broke. Have you thought this through?
---
Applications Architect by trade.
---
Divide the map into macro quadrants of say enough space for 4 camps like a grid.
---
Add a DB entry when camp is placed for World Id and the macro quadrant.
---
upon login just look in DB for NOT IN (same Macro Quadrant and World Id)
---
you get a list of all possible worlds where no collision.
---
If this is "impossible to implement", then it was not written modular enough.
---
I heard it’s -60 all resistances
---
It's one perk, like the crafting/lock picking ones you can put it on and off when you go to sell.  I forgot, grab and cook all the meat dropped by enemies, really the entire aid tab minus alcohol is great vendor trash.  Vendor trash is everywhere once you have the right mind set.

I couldn't place a switched pylon on a foundation because of floating but the non switched one worked... But I wanted a switch.... Waaaaa

Are you kidding. I can clear 1200 caps with one clear out of Harper's ferry. I can clear all 1400 caps with a single westtek run sometimes. I can always clear 1400 caps with less than 30 minutes of game play.
---
Ohhh! How did I not think of that
---
Poseidon, Grafton both have landing pads, just fix it and snap a pic, had no issues last time ..  there is another that has one, but the workshop escapes me
---
Would a supply requisition holotape work? Call it near flatwood, you know where it will land.
---
With this last patch thing have been more problematic. I probably won’t move camp til the next when HOPEFULLY it will be fixed.
---
No thats where you are incorrect. It has everything to do with supply and demand. Explosive lasers go for insane prices because there is a high demand for them vs the actual availability. Explosive energy is no longer a drop therefore it is worth a lot more. Certain weapon and armor roll are highly sought after but if everyone had them, the price would be normal. This is why the price is insanely high. Basic game earnings have would not even come close to hurting the economy because with out an income, you have no economy. People have to have some kind of monetary way to earn currency otherwise there is no economy to destroy. 
---
This is simple business economics.

I started at first in the dry lake. I only started tooking picture when he saw me, as a contingency plan.

It technically was not 115% invincible per se since it works multiplicatively by some weird equation. I do agree though that the 75% thing is dumb, they shouldve just brought it down to 10% all the time

Try the port-a-diner if you find one, as I think the odds might have changed. I've received two in a week!

I’ve tested it too- I built a shop area near a busy area and intentionally didn’t power up the machines yet since I was just starting to stock them. All of a sudden I get the cash register ringing with sales- turns out people were totally able to buy out of my non-powered, not-showing-on-the-map vending machines if they found them in-world.

---
It _could_ be mods. I've never had anything like that happen but it's the easiest step to try first.
---
If you go into My Documents/My Games/Fallout 76 and rename or delete the Fallout76custom.ini it'll boot up without any mods activated &amp; default to base settings.
---
No need for a reinstall just yet, if that first step doesn't fix it I'd try a Scan &amp; Repair from the Bethesda Launcher. Can't hurt.
---
Can confirm.
---
Since player vending have you bought anything from a Faction vendor other then plans or recipes?
---
It would still need to load a very specific set of data to run the check against, and depending on how the whole 'load into the world' subroutine is written, that information may not be easily accessible outside that process.
---
I don't know how the creation engine handles those things (and it probably didn't until FO76 was developed...so I'll assume it was shoehorned in on a budget).  If it's coded/stored the right way, it should be relatively simple to pull the data from the other 23 players, map that to a virtual map, or more likely just check your camp against the other ones (simple coordinate distance function).  I can't really imagine a method of doing all that where at least the basic camp location *wasn't* stored as character data.
---
Your loading examples might be where the issue really lies currently, maybe they didn't want to check the camp location until the player actually loads to prevent that issue, but there should be a way to work around that.  It doesn't mean it will be really *easy* to do, but it should be possible.
---
I'll lock my fucking door if I want to. Why the hell would I find somewhere secluded just to let randoms in.
---
Expect nothing. This just doesn't seem to be a priority
---
They also said new factions are coming, too. My thought is they're going to make players choose a side, and then introduce faction-based content and wars. This would tie into both questing and PVP to pit people against one another.
---
Where are you getting that 5 star legendary thing from?
---
Lower level players rely on this until they reach an appropriate level to make decent caps from player vending and even then there are no guarantees. What is best for you isn’t necessarily what’s best for a level 8 player still finding their feet. At level 131 I still top up my caps from the faction vendors lol.
---
Oh man I can't even imagine playing this game as Snake
---
Absolutely! Psn Bellamicina

The coffee joint just north of the Welch Train Station. It’s where Murgle the cat lives and that’s the only resource I need.
---
I just like to see outposts of survivors it makes the world feel more alive and I know that sounds odd since the world is supposed to be kind of the opposite but I don’t think 1-3 of them could hurt
---
What's worse is in FO4 the absolute best way to deal with flying bugs is vats melee. So out of habit I always hit vats, can't even swing, back out of vats, swing again and still miss. The hit connect is absolute trash right now for all things melee
---
Just redid the investigation mission. 
---
It was forgettable before and I breezed through it - now the layout is more unique and complex.
---
If your own your own and low-level it can be a bit of a welcome challenge given the numbers of enemies in the basement loops.
---
Downvoted after reading first sentence, don't care about numbers. You wanna spend your time only trading, so do it. Convince some friends to do same so there is less inflation, and feel better for it.  
---
I will keep playing normally, thanks.
---
oh damn
---
Agreed
---
I had one of those floating camps only because the single foundation made it easy to relocate. It always bugged me that the supports in the "stairs" section never reached far enough and if you use like a short stacked on a long they'd clip into the ground and become unplaceable.    
---
With this last patch they seem to have fixed that so now my raised camp has much more believable support structure holding it up.
---
To add to this, you're limited to 4 machines, so mixing up 2 things, Guns + Ammo, Plans + Junk, etc, can make it simpler to find what you want (and what you need to make/use it).
---
I got lucky trying to do that part of the Pioneer Scouts quest. I was traveling around visiting peoples' camps to see what they had for sale in their vending machines and one guy happened to be at his camp who was also stuck on that part. He happened to message me and ask me if I'd down myself so he could revive me, and I told him I would if he would too. I wasn't even looking for someone to help with that, so that was a lucky break.
---
- Do you want a lot of foot traffic if you're vending?
---
- Do you want it hidden from the world if you're not vending?
---
- Do you want it on water?
---
- Do you want it near or on a mineral deposite?
---
- Do you want to be attacked by low-level spawns or high-level?
---
- Do you want it near places you regularly farm?
---
- What biome do you like/hate?
---
There's a lot of questions you'll need to ask yourself because there's no one perfect spot. There's only a perfect spot for you.
---
I get my 1400 caps my collecting junk and chems in about 30 minutes, this guy the OP just want to make caps his way which is fine but want his way forced on everyone else.
---
Sounds like a Communist accountant.
---
I thought the sheep was fake and had no friends.
---
Yeah I just took a closer look and all of them are technically completed but all of them are broken and haven’t registered. Was hoping to get the easy atoms to get a skin. Maybe a new character will work.
---
no problem joining game now
---
This Machine. There are too many Commies running around
---
It's my favourite and almost-only (have the QOL ones on generally) cosmetic F4 mod.
---
I can get close with the current armor / equipment - but I want that shard in my skull and an eyepatch for BA reasons.
---
Another helpful way to gauge time is to list notable historical events:

The Platinum Chip is recovered | 2281 | 204
---
The Brotherhood arrives in the Commonwealth | 2287 | 210
---
Hmm I’m on pc and didn’t play in the beta, just very soon after. Good to know a new character should fix it, thanks.
---
I built mine on or near the roads leading to Morgantown. I find that's the best location if you have a lot of crops to place down and want a place that is near a bunch of map markers that won't cost too many caps to fast travel to. Also the roads around Morgantown make not fast traveling easier because they branch off in many directions so you can create a variety of routes for yourself with less hassle of bumping into unclimbable mountains or rock structures. It is also a visually pleasing area if you build near the river.
---
And it does more damage to the Crossbow for the repairing challenge.
---
Uranium Fever is always a good choice for scrip.
---
Doesn't seem like they would be a rising threat then, their numbers would dwindle, especially as not all of them have access to the vats, and you can bet none are planning to meet the requirements of future expansion. Also don't most people just die from the FEV vats?
---
Yep. That should make it better.
---
hey op, i see your heartache here. are you on xbox? i have a lvl 50 3* vampires pole hook/40% faster swing speed/90% reduced weight that ill give you
---
The nerf melee needs
---
I totally agree with what your saying, but did you try going in and out of build mode to try again?
---
But you can't lock/shut yourself in... :(
---
That won't work if you know I'm here (and why) :)
---
No need to reinstall. Just remove the mods the same way you added them. Or update them!
---
Have you tried to server hop to see if that will change anything or did it stay the same.
---
sure i'll be on in about 30mins from this reply on PC :P
---
I suspect it can be worn independently, as with other Atomic Shop outfits. However, if you're after just the hat and don't care for the rest of it, [there's already a tinfoil hat in the game](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_foil_hat). It looks quite a bit different, but hey, it's free!
---
Ha actually same scenario. I wanted a switch for my vending machine but couldn’t get it to place anywhere. Used the non switch instead.
---
I've had some Chameleon, Masupial, Speed Demon, and Talons serums in my inventory for like a week. I don't think they spoil...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bozd0s/psa_traps_in_someones_camp_will_kill_you/
---
Very neat!!!
---
Cool, hope it's free and no a one use 50 atom thing
---
, Same goes for the thing in spoilers
---
Do Collision Course event - its the only way to get a good easy photo of a cargobot.
---
I got a photo of a Sheepsquatch fighting a Sentry Bot a few weeks ago, but it turned out too blurry to keep. The Sentry Bot won I think.
---
And once again... dude.. if you want caps it’s easy to get.
---
I would say according to the market sub a vast majority are because there’s plenty of caps trading there
---
No need to sound like a prick to someone telling you how to get caps, the ones who sell junk probably play very little. And who really buys anything but plans from the vendor
---
There is a level 45 TSE Dragon. People find a lot of 35s due to Uranium Fever.
---
Bite my shiny metal ass!
---
it's ok.. they broke the renaming to give it to us.
---
All my renamed weapons reverted back and we lost the ability to rename.
---
I used to rename all my desired keeper items with a first char of \*
---
What wiffle wo wou whink?
---
Yes. Absolutely. In and out, in total frustration. The only issue that going in and out resolved for me is when it says “nothing is selected”. Another annoyance, but resolvable.
---
They don't have means to track and validify. If you had footage that might help them figure out what happened and how. There are a million variables
---
Sheepsquatch stood tall over a mound of corpses. I could almost count myself as one until my girlfriend's barrage of 40mm grenades gave me breathing room. Still got the finishing punch.
---
Reminds me of the flame trap room and murder church
---
The distortion is real.
---
You're the best, thanks a ton!
---
If that's the case why don't we just print 20 or so trillion dollars and payoff the national debt ( this would be bad ) since dilution does not hurt value and if caps were not so easy to obtain the prices would not be so high.
---
P.S there are other ways to get caps besides faction  vendor's and players.
---
Basically Nukashine but white
---
I had to try out a few times myself. The only way I got it to work was doing that one last.
---
I can also help ya with the revive 
---
IGN: SemiPotent
---
Ill be on in a few min
---
Someone else reported that Instigating Explosive doesn't work. As though the explosive damage hits first and blocks the 2x.
---
 I am on xbox. Thanks, sounds like an awesome weapon.  Mine was only lvl10 that is why I gave it to a low lvl player. I had put the multi hook mod on it.
---
yea same here after a few back and forth emails they finally understand that it bugged out instead of me not knowing how to progress it.
---
I didn't until i saw this!!!! I want an Elle Driver eyepatch from killbill
---
This is super broken and should not just be left for a later update.
---
Same with the gray knit beanie and a handful of other hats. Looks awesome with the impostor sheep headpiece though.
---
I would like that as well. However I am not sure how that would work stability-wise since the PipBoy would have to track not only your current inventory but also everything in your stash at all times.
---
It’s doesn’t always work, the power armor has to be placeable. If you are stuck in the wrong spot you are just screwed. 
---
Happened to me yesterday
---
I had to stalk a low level player to get this done myself lol.
---
Ended up building a stairway to heaven, dropping a loot bag at the end, and removing the floor from underneath them.
---
Gave them like 50 or so different Nuka-Cola types to make up for it, but I felt awful about it.
---
At least, until I got my bag.
---
I think rebalancing armor would fix so many issues with weapon builds.
---
Armor should only be good at resisting one type of damage:  Ballistic or Melee or Energy or Radiation.  Metal is great vs ballistic but barely stops energy.  Leather blocks energy but bullets go right through it.  Trapper takes a beating with no problem but gets melted or perforated with ease.  Combat and Marine resist them all equally, but no where as good as specialized armor in its category.  If metal has a ballistic DR of 200, combat has a DR of 40 for each, marine gets 50 or 55.
---
Power Armor resists all damage types very well, with some variation between the models. T45 is weak against energy compared to T60 or X01, but is still stronger than Metal vs energy.
---
Stop balancing the weapons. Make ultra weapon specialization harder to justify.  It would be strange for me to spend 9 perk points on melee or ballistic damage when a decent portion of my opponents (pvp or PVE) are just going to resist it.  However, if I do spend those points, I should absolutely shred anything not kitted against me. 
---
This would make some of the Perception perks more valuable as well.
---
I believe my S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats are at:
---
* Strength - 15
---
* Perception - 4
---
* Endurance - 3
---
* Charisma - 4
---
* Intelligence - 9
---
* Agility - 13
---
* Luck - 8
---
So for my unarmed build, the relevant perks I use are:
---
* Incisor rank 3 (Strength)
---
* Martial Artist rank 3 (Strength)
---
* Iron Fist rank 3 (Strength)
---
* Adrenaline Rank 3 (Agility)
---
* Bloody Mess rank 3 (Luck)
---
* Enforcer rank 3 (Agility, I carry around a auto combat shotgun to cripple larger enemies that I cant one shot)
---
* Glow Sighted rank 3 (Perception, Only used in nuke zones because I have to run a hazmat suit while unarmed)
---
* Makeshift Warrior rank 5 (Intelligence, Keeps me from having to repair weapons so often)
---
* Stranger In Numbers (Charisma, I run on a team 90% of the time, and it increases the effectiveness of my mutations, increasing my damage output.)
---
Mutations:
---
* Talons
---
* Twisted Muscles
---
* Grounded
---
* Electrically Charged
---
* Healing Factor
---
* Herd Mentality (I play on a team and the extra 2 points helps up my damage, but not needed)
---
* Others that just make life easier, but are not necessary
---
When I have to go into PA I run 2H. Most perks stay the same except I take out all strength perks except Incisor, Martial Artist, a Traveling Pharmacy (I carry a ton of chems to sell). They get replaced with Slugger rank 2, Expert Slugger rank 2, and Master Slugger rank 2. I only have them at rank 2 because I run Traveling Pharmacy all the time, and it takes up the 3 slots needed to max rank the slugger cards.
---
I run a 2\* instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet most of the time. With a 2\* Furious Grognaks Axe when I am in PA.
---
I can one shot most enemies, at full health, with my build, but it is far from a Min/Max build, and I know I can up my damage even more, but there are QoL perks I want to run.
---
I believe it was. It's my favorite part of the map.
---
Games been out how long now with the same crashing issue?
---
Take a guess how likely it is to be fixed.
---
I'd copy the blackboard from the basement in the Agricultural Center in Flatwoods.

Thanks, i still need the revive player in water and the usual revive a player, the rest i can handle

Wait... making the 4th bullseye, or getting glitched out on the 4th bullseye?  Because if it the second, then you may have saved my butt.  Maybe I hit the skeleton and it is a bullseye but isn't a bullseye, so the program freaks out.
---
The airport north of Charleston (can't remember the name now either haha).
---
did you at least get the bot at dolly sods to activate , he did for me but the one at kiddie corner still won't trigger no matter what
---
Run Uranium Fever once or twice and you'll be set. There is even a handy weapons bench to scrap everything and an easy walk to a Stash box if you get over encumbered.
---
Nope neither
---
Last time I had a similar situation it's was my desktop firewall app writing to the log file every few mins and it took forever to figure out. Try closing every possible background app to see if that helps. 
---
Use Windows firewall and antivirus for a while.
---
Also you can try opening performance monitor on a second screen to keep an eye on things while playing. Don't forget to watch disk- sorry by total read/write to spot sudden spikes.
---
dont got no hotkeys on console (outside of the quick menu)
---
maybe like fixer, it can have hidden property;
---
So inflation is your friend or should I say hyperinflation do a quick Google search about online game economy's tanking due to hyperinflation then get back to me there was a time that 25k caps per character could buy anything in this game.
---
It clips through the civil war hat but I can’t comment on other headwear, looks like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/LA9FhZU

Flux is always required for the last two upgrades. So it depends on how high you want to upgrade it to.
---
I thought each piece was calculated sequentially?
---
Basically for sentinal/cav;
---
100 base dmg 
---
Piece 1 = -15% 
---
Piece 2 = -12.75% (15% of 85 dmg)
---
Piece 3 = -10.8% (15% of 72.25 dmg)
---
Piece 4 = -9.2% (15% of 61.4 dmg)
---
Piece 5 = -7.8% (15% of 52.2 dmg)
---
Equals 44 dmg taken?
---
There's so much confusion over so many basic calculations in the game. I wish they would explain this better.
---
well i didn't before player vending all i ever bought from the robots was plans or mods
---
 The Mire. I have become a creature of the Mire and happily live there.
---
I didn't glitch out, but I couldn't get the 4th before the timer ran out.  I didn't notice the corpse at first, I walked over to see if I could get the bolts back, saw draped over and I hit it off out of frustration.  The next attempt I got 4 in a row, no problems.
---
my gt is ilulz01 shoot me a game inv, it doesnt have the multi hook mod so youll have to hunt that down. but im sure your ganna really enjoy having a lvled up one
---
Nah, it's just glitches, I've been building one at every CAMP whose owner I team up with... wonder if it was me?
---
Enemy's drop caps plus various challenges give caps
---
" I didn't have a "I'm just following you until you're downed to revive you for a quest" emote..."   I just LOL'd at work
---
Try another door?
---
I've been having some issues with crops like this. There seems to be some kind of obstacle intersecting.
---
Underarmor as outfits would be nice it would also be nice to wear the hooded rags as a outfit and not have it completely remove everything else that i am wearing. Its like here you go a set of clothes that make you look like a person trying to survive in the wasteland but good luck surviving cause we are gonna remove everything when you wear this outfit.
---
Hard reset your console and clear cache.  It genuinely fixed most of the crashing issues for me.
---
Did you remove the wires?
---
If you still can’t kill people with this armor you need to rethink your build.
---
The PvP meta now is crouching, for a reason.
---
If I remember rightly, you can place AS Items with a replacement glitch.
---
Like you place the normal version, then your friend replaces it with the AS version.
---
Doesn't/Didn't work for everything though, and it's been a while since I've tried it.
---
Place a cooking station nearby where under house or wall spawns happen.  Then you don’t need PA.
---
Had trouble with the keypad pylon - you can only place it facing a wall, and the keypad itself teleports onto said wall rather than being on the post where it's supposed to be.
---
I can't even make a new character or play my current character, because when I try the game just crashes to the desktop.
---
I've uninstalled and reinstalled.
---
I've verified game files.
---
I've optimised the settings as low as possible.
---
I've updated drivers.
---
I've cleaned cache.
---
I've change drives.
---
I have more than enough RAM and am above minimum CPU spec.
---
I cannot figure out why this is happening.
---
It use to work, mostly without issues, since the BETA, up until around the end of November.
---
Bethesda support has been useless.
---
I think I'm done trying with this game.
---
At least F4 still works for me.
---
yea if i could get the one at kiddie corner to talk to me I could at least get my backpack even though i wouldnt have the frog jar unlockable , but the frog jar can be traded so i'm not too worried about it
---
Yep, it’s attached to nothing, still can’t place it.
---
Munitions has one
---
Yeah there are client-server issues with C.A.M.P. building. Green on my end, clearly not green to the server. Not really any rhyme or reason, turns green makes a claim "intersecting an existing object" or "object is floating" when the UI says it's good to place. 
---
Happens when I'm trying to snap walls to foundations a lot for some reason, have to slightly move the foundation for it to work.
---
None of those are things that can be affected by luck. Luck has a chance to increase the possibility that a group of mobs will have a legendary. Luck doesn’t increase chance of a 3 star from a 3 star or any influence of drops. It simply increases the chance of legendaries spawning.
---
Fair enough.
---
Again... some of us don't swap perks, some of us play the game differently. This isn't about judging a player on how they play the game, it's about saying that the original math is bad, because it assumes all players from Lvl 1, to Lvl 65,000 play the game in the same manner, making cap collection their focus. 
---
I don't spend all my time gathering vendor trash and scraping for caps. I use the mats I collect to craft and build and consume myself. I sell stuff for dirt cheap in my vending machines, and sell bulk stuff to vendor bots when I have too much of it. 
---
I'd be lucky to take home 200 caps a day... I think I maxed out at about 750 once, due to some lucky RNG, and a full Saturday of cold rain keeping me on the couch.
---
Ohhh... well, still good tip, but probably not my issue.  Maybe I just was trying while others were duping...
---
https://youtu.be/JP6zFIQOGI8
---
This was basically my bug report, ignore the lag, my cpu is garbage
---
will do. i wont be online till about 6:00pm EDT.
---
So your telling me that I would not earn any caps without selling to faction vendor's?
---
Does the counselor robot even acknowledge the quest or anything when you speak with him at Kiddies Corner?
---
Plan sellers are the true MVPs
---
yes!
---
Charisma would make the reward of 21 .45 rounds to 30 .45 rounds. It’s not going to increase the chance of a jumpsuit or anything like that. Just influences the number of what ever is awarded.
---
Just out of curiosity, where exactly does the tourist spawn? On the sidewalk leading up towards the memorial stone? Or somewhere off to the side?
---
I'll take either lol
---
Ahh. Gotcha. Well thats a bug I don't want fixed lol
---
I was able to see it happen. Deathclaw died with Sheepsquatch barely at 75% health and hadn't even healed yet.
---
o thatll be fine, ill hold onto it. just shoot me a message and if im not on ill hop on
---
Your rig should be fine for Fallout 76. I'm running an i7 980, 12GB, and GTX 980 ti and don't have any performance issues at 1080p on ultra.
---
Have you checked your GPU and CPU clocks and temperatures when the freezes are happening? Any overclocking? The color inversion is strange, and crashing to desktop for other Bethesda games suggests something is not quite right. Do you have any software installed that might affect network communication?
---
Man. Crops have become the worst. I try to put my crops in a line, you know, like CROPS! Lol. But depending on the terrain it’s really problematic. You basically need a 0% slope.
---
THIS
---
Tasty. I came into the game late and missed some stuff. Wonder if It works with the Nuka Stash box.
---
Nuka Dark Paint job is black and gold.  Actually looks pretty regal in game.
---
I get what you are saying though, you want paints without rust and aging that still has clear coat on it.  Aka it looks like it was painted yesterday, not 25 years ago.  Was hoping we would get some of those on the cheap.  Seems like a no brainer to make solid colors with no decals for like 400 to 600 atoms.  They dont have to all be different, just a quick flip from one color to the next.  Just go nuts on hues and colors but keep them cheap and people would buy a ton of em.  Especially purple black and red though I would love a pink one.
---
You can build inside most unmarked, sealed houses, and build a secret base inside!
---
😅 yeah, I kept looking around like what is intersecting? I think it's the air.
---
Yeah, I guess I overpaid as well. And I had been on that terminal to get the jet pack and shocks plans, so either the paint was added after that, or I have been blind. ;-)
---
I've been thinking of going pure melee build because I feel like the value I get out of perception and my lever action rifle isn't as good as it should be. I was doing a hybrid of melee/rifle but i'm considering going more into melee and PA.  
---
When it comes to power armor I just feel like t60 is the standard farm, it's easy to repair and has a higher damage resistance, so outside of aesthetics why would I ever use raider over it? this is why I feel they need to balance out the armors a little more. 
---
I like your ideas about the armor and makes sense in relation to the weapon balance problems minus that I still want weight reduction incorporated into the perks.
---
\&gt;.&lt;
---
Not what I wanted to hear...
---
Well just had someone nuke Campfire Tales and all the ticks were glowing but not scorched
---
I have a mutants explosive 10mm and an Executioners FFR to switch too. 
---
I wish I'd started with this build
---
Lol. That is some SOLID air.
---
No, I was pointing out that new players rely on it and I use it as a top up as I’m not usually at max caps. I often use them to help lower levels. I didn’t realise what I’d written was complicated lol.
---
They don't spoil.  Have serums on all five characters for 3 months.  What has happen though is I've accidentally consumed some because there is a latency glitch where you believe you are consuming one thing (meat in your case) but the cursor is actually on the serum.  I've done this too often so I now leave the serums in my stash and only place it in my inventory just before selling to the robot vendor.
---
You happen to have a discord so i can type, i don't own a mic
---
I look for spawn points and build my bases away from them.  It allows me to construct bases without the usual defenses, even when people port in to check at the vendor.
---
Dude.  You’re posting to the wrong group of people.  Try a different sub if you want to show off that you duped and might be able to play again.
---
How do you get inside of they are sealed?
---
You can’t pick up PA frames without “owning” them. And I’m pretty sure you can’t list them if you own them.
---
The single foundation dwellings always look terrible, though. :(
---
Question op do you play on PC?
---
Is... is it a food build?
---
Okay, we're back to bad math... of course the market sub is full of people who spend their time making caps... nobody else would visit it. That's like saying going to a Trump rally means that all Americans support Trump. 
---
I have never once "told anyone how to get caps".... geezuz H. I AM SAYING THAT OP's MATH IS BAD BECAUSE IT ASSUMES EVERYONE PLAYS THE GAME MAXING CAPS."
---
That is literally all I am saying.
---
There's the grid there that stops you, as well.  I've been trying for almost two months to get one with no luck.  You can't find a worn veil once you're over a certain level.  It's a quest item, so a low level player can't trade it to you.  They can't craft an additional at the fabricator or a fresh one at the armor station.  :(
---
I think you have to start the initial quest at or above level 50  and not just complete it at level 50.
---
get out of here with that common sense solution!
---
I play with a steam controller connected to my PC and I love it. I had to remap the buttons to send keyboard and mouse inputs because the game is very limiting on controller inputs.
---
To set it up, open up Steam and click on 'add a non-Steam game.'
---
Find the exe file of the game by going to the Bethesda.net folder.
---
Make sure to launch the game through Steam AFTER you connect or turn-on your Steam controller.
---
You will have to sign-in each time you launch the game, but it's worth it if you want to use a Steam controller.
---
Go to the in-game settings and DISABLE THE CONTROLLER OPTION (this is very important to avoid getting a soft-lock in the game).
---
Press the middle button on your controller and click on 'controller configuration' to remap your controller imputs you keyboard and mouse imputs.
---
You don't need the Bethesda.net launcher to play the game, but you need to open it when the game gets updated. I personally have it open up on its own on startup.
---
Now you can enjoy using your Steam controller!
---
(Note: the steps also work for other types of controllers)
---
I’m so sad this post died.  I just want it to live on.
---
Clip a banjo through the wall. Place it inside, with the back sticking out, when you activate it, you’ll phase through and sit in the chair
---
Right. Um, cold case I think.
---
My gt is OCRCustoms ga.
---
They do defy gravity a lot of times :)
---
Ok. Just wanted to check, so I knew what I was in for if you join me. So basically we should know within 10 minutes or less if it's going to fix you or not.
---
The biggest problem here is that the base builder will also never know where people will spawn in.
---
That's why wee NEED the spawn mats!
---
The player will spawn in one location.
---
and 1st team mate will spawn somewhere else.
---
2nd will spawn in somewhere else too (unless player 1 has moved off where they spawned in).
---
I did a lot of trial and error with this when I was building bases with the impenetrable concrete walls and ceilings back when you could build bases that could only be entered via fast travels.
---
Moving the CAMP item within your established base will move ALL of the spawn points and you have to test all over again.
---
So often I would spawn into a concrete wall and had to use the trick of deploying the power armor so that the animation would lift me out of a stuck point and move the character towards the power armor. trick works with exiting too.. Turn back towards desired direction and exit.
---
Bröther
---
Lol ya its real easy, just gotta ge the quest started, talk to the main guy get all the objectives started, then do helpfulness, once ur done if nine doesnt finish then it doesnt work :p its worth a shot. Thanks for ur time ill give u some caps or something
---
I had similar issues the last time I tried to move mine. It has weird collision mechanics if you're moving it a short diatance. I built a seperate foundation some distance away that I placed it on first, then was able to move it again to it's forever home.
---
Yep, and waited a day just to be sure, this happened yesterday and nothing changed.
---
Pistol builds are great. I have an instigating single action, with faster reload and +50% vats critical damage. Felt like a god roll for a vats pistol build....
---
the point you make is suburb, however, we are dealing with a very very old game engine ... however "updated" it is, it is still built on the bones of a very very old game engine unfortunately
---
id love it if they could do what you proposed hoever
---
I know they don't spoil... this is why I think this is a bug.
---
If you scrap a destroyed plant, you get all the resources you need to rebuild it. Ex. Scrap a destroyed corn, and you get 1 corn and 1 fertilizer, so you can just replant it.
---
Thanks a million!
---
If you ever need help i'd gladly return the favor, not that i can be much help since i'm kinda low level
---
Yeah, sometimes there's just no escape...
---
Yes, this should just be in the options under preferences. The HUD is too hard to see, the green light lights up everything except the tops to the table im looking. This should all be easy to change just like fo4
---
Trade for caps?? Thats your answer?  That's absurd.  90% of anyone with anything worth trading for wont trade for caps.  You obviously think you're smarter than you really are.   You obviously lack critical thinking. I can tell you think you are a critical thinker but its just so obvious from your arguements that you are not.  You have nothing productive to offer.   Your genius solution to trade for caps is garbage because it's not always an option.  You're right about one thing...its a waste of time
---
Makes sense
---
So which do you want?
---
free content over many years at the expense of expediency and perfection or to have to actually pay for content they have to pay people to make?
---
Seems like many of the people out there complaining want to make a self fulfilling prophecy- "the game isn't AAA, there is STILL a T-posing raider in the arena!!!" or sales are low because people overhyped the bad "They are now charging for updates!!" -or- ""They pulled the plug when they said it would be here for years!!"
---
and yeah, there was issues, but understanding what causes those is somewhat important, like the fact that no amount of beta testing would have prevented this from being a mess in the beginning- there are just too many computer configurations and not enough time or money to do it (meaning investors want a return, and the worst thing you can do for future investment is "delay")
---
on top of the above, in case you didn't know this whole project is a "beta" for future games- and no, they never said that outright, but it is pretty obvious
---
and they havent opened the vaults yet- nor do we even have 4 or 5 star legendaries yet- and peeps gonna complain about ""end game"
---
If you want to do it solo try Athlete, Archer and Hunter.  Cripple/lower the health of the yao guai first before you do the syringer kill. Mammologist is pretty doable too, I did it almost entirely by accident, only needed to actually go hunt down like 2 pictures.
---
Swimmer is easy but you need someone to revive so its not a solo option.
---
Don't build a vendor.
---
Haha its ok :)
---
That’s a great photo!
---
Id be ok with this if they changed both affects back to pre nerf status.
---
Yup now if only revelations was actually about the Apocalypse and not a diatribe speaking out against the persecution christians endured under Roman rule. ;)
---
And I'm pretty sure someone at Bethesda has been keeping up with Good Omens coming out in a couple of weeks =)
---
what is it with those guys?!?!? i always see the same build doing that crap, bloodied gauntlet build
---
Thank you, that is really good to know
---
I mean... maybe your serums sold.
---
i see a wanted player, i start bounty hunting
---
they should add robot dogs to fit with the whole automated thing. then you can mod the dog to do certain things without being a dog raciest. be cause they all be good boys and girls.
---
Game chat is generally unreliable.  Invite to a party.  Can always leave when done
---
Damn that has to suck. I think it's a bug. I wonder if this happend to other people.
---
Everyone can’t have the same base location, so why would anyone share their best base location- they’re encouraging competition for their space.
---
I know they don't spoil, this is why I think this is a bug.
---
I rarely consume something from the Pip-boy, for Hunger I have Ionized meat on a Hotkey, for thirst I have purified water on a hotkey too, I barely use the meat as I'm have the Cannibal perk. I don't see myself consuming the 8 of them by error...
---
Yeah I've started playing alternating days just to avoid that.
---
&gt;Everyone already knows about the UI bug, that is old news, this is something completely different.
---
No, that is the only bug that is happening in this post. This whole thread is about op thinking he sold 7000 rounds and not getting enough caps. He was told what happened, but rather than Amit he was wrong he, and now you, doubled down on it. What happened in his video is clearly the same thing that happened in my video, only I was about to repeat it and showed all the relevant details, so you could see what was really happening.
---
&gt;It is why it is even happening to people selling guns or armor, things that aren't stacked, and only have 1 of. So the UI bug wouldn't matter, likewise the guy who sold 25 stimpacks (which were all he had) for 25 caps each, yet only got 225 caps, from selling all 25 of them.
---
Where are these other people? The stimpack guy was the same guy as op, the 7000 ammo guy, and is easily explained as the same thing happening. **If there is another bug, then someone, anyone, show an example of it, so it can be figured out. Otherwise, stop spreading around false information because that is actively detrimental to the game.**
---
Fallout 76 has been out for about 5 months compared to the 7+ years of 3 and new vegas.
---
&gt;Says the dude who thinks fo3 sold better than NV, even though if you look up any information about them NV out sold fo3 and there isn't really anywhere making the claim otherwise, except you. Seems you just pulled it out of your ass.
---

* **By 2015 Fallout 3:  estimated that the game had sold 12.4 million copies worldwide.**
---
* **By 2015 Fallout New Vegas:  estimates that the game had sold 11.6 million copies worldwide by 2015**
---
The numbers you gave me explain your bullshit. You took the number of Fallout 3 sales in 2008, which were around 4.7 million. And then you used Fallout new vegas worldwide sales. 
---
&gt;From its release in October to the end of 2008, Fallout 3 shipped over 4.7 million units
---
Learn how to read sources properly you *dumbass*.
---
My camp is in that area. From memory, it's a bit more south (im pretty sure) from the truck camp. You'll have a giant tree on your left near the river and a bridge in front of you with some broken railcars. The tick shack is to the right, before you pass the bridge.
---
...?   It's underarmor from the shop, so... maybe the rules are different for plans and flux requirements?
---
Also curious what type of flux and what the bonus is.  Guessing helps max INT if they want to keep the joke going.
---
Yes it sucks... And I hope this doesn't happen to anyone
---
Yup suffer all the time now. 15 of us couldn't take down the Queen in the time we normally do because the first two hits missed. Same goes for the enemies we faced there as well.
---
Ok, lol. It didn't exactly click with me at 1st on the gist of what you needed. Originally thought it would involve the challenges etc. . ., and I had no problem with it, But I'm on the same page now, and remember the Tidy Up part being quick to get to and finish, as it's the very 1st thing I did after speaking to main counselor. No worries on the caps. I do have a lvl 3 toon that would gladly accept low lvl weapons/armor donations, but I'm not doing it for anything in return. If I hadn't recognized your name from the Market, I may not have even clicked on the thread lol. Pays to have +karma I guess lol.
---
ALL my bases are the one concrete piece and one stair to main floor. and when I move a base even when perfectly flat.. can't the blue print if creates. 
---
No I'm not trying to build a second instance under blueprints, I'm in the primary instance in "Stored" using the blueprint the system created but I can't place it. This section of the coding needs some real work.
---
May want to include platform, time requested, etc..
---
I think you've got that the wrong way around.
---
This sets a baseline of \~10,000 caps per week. So 25,000 caps is really about 2-3 weeks of caps.
---
Then you consider, would I sell such and such legendary drop for less than 3 weeks of caps? No, probably not. It's why sought after drops don't trade for caps, no matter how many you have.
---
The point is that caps don't buy legendary drops, so their usefulness is limited. Except now that there's player vending things are changing some. Player vending also introduced a 10% cap sink.
---
And on top of all that, the thing I've spent the most caps on by far is plans. At vendors. Where the caps disappear into the abyss from whence they came.
---
If you're on xbox I have the recipe, just need the materials which are a pain in the ass. If you need them made for the badge.
---
You’d think so, but that’s the canon lore. Fallout 1 spoiler: It’s actually a way to get a specific ending in fallout 1. You point out to the master that his perfect plan is flawed because Super Mutants can’t repopulate and are therefore entirely dependent on the humans around them.
---
/u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
Mr Handy Buzz Blades?
---
Strongly disagree. I use VATS (or did) against insects all the time because they move around so fast that it can be hard to make a slow weapon connect. Obviously you shouldn't be able to VATS a cargobot or anything at altitude, but close range flying enemies like insects should 100% be targetable. This 0% bug makes running across bloodbugs and bloatflies incredibly frustrating now.
---
I normally track when they do, and if that happened I'm missing a lot of caps and don't explain the Spoiled Meat :P
---
It works for me. I encountered him some time ago in the Cranberry Bog :)

The junk jet but so that it would work in 76 junk jet ammo in ammo crates that doesn’t say what it is till you fire it and then it might be desk fans, might be teddy bears or might be tin cans you just wouldn’t know till you pressed the trigger lol
---
Yeah, agreed. My game crashed like twice, which hardly ever happened to me in my 150+ hours of play. There was also some insane visual glitch where my map screen was bugging out with flashing rainbow colors.
---
Wait but even Mike had his Boxing Gloves!
---
Appreciated! But I’m on PS4.  Thanks though :)
---
I was crouching before it was meta!
---
It feels like someone’s... trying to SELL ME SOMETHING!
---
I am, but some of those quests are bullshit and bugged out. You would be lying to yourself if you think otherwise.
---
They should make a Complaint protectron at whitesprings so you can send a letter of your complaint hoping to get your spent resources back or some type of compensation for your troubles.
---
It's not complicated I do get what you are saying but there was a time when 25k could buy anything but now that caps are like litter on a city street they have lost buying power.
---
They will probably come back. Uneducated people without knowledge in marketing may say "I can only imagine how much money they losing but doing this way" but in fact, it's probably the best marketing strategy, as it creates a sensation of scarcity and the impulse to buy them if you have the opportunity.  
---
So you specially like one of the 1st horseman outfits they released, and missed the occasion to buy em. Now you wait months while you keep playing, and sometimes seeing people with that skin you desire.  
---
Next time you see it in atom shop, after long time, you know you have another opportunity, and how much will you regret it if you don't buy it now.
---
A youtuber by the name of JuiceHead had a smiliar freezing problem, and his viewers suggested that it's connected to the number of people on his friends list. Keeping it short fixed the problem for him. Maybe it's the same issue?
---
This just happened to me at the camp fire event, glad I'm not alone
---
Oh in that sense, yeah some of them are complete bullshit
---
I agree...people complaining they have a few misses when hitting mobs with 10k damage ffs
---
Add natebrum and I'll be on to tear up the wwasteland with ya
---
Any armor piece with a carry weight perk. E.g. weapons weigh 20% less.  
---
Aesthetically, I've been wearing drifter clothes and a pirate hat for a while now. Previously it was BOS engineer clothes because of the O2 tank attached to the back.
---
Then that sucks :(
---
Exactly, every playstyle should at least be possible. RIP crit melee builds with this bug.
---
I think melee should get a 30% damage nerf,as well as a MI or bloodied nerf
---
Tabitha and Lily disagree.
---
No, and no. They’re disabled and when they were not disabled only booze could go in it.
---
hey everyone has their kinks, even in post-apocalyptic west Virgina
---
you can try clearing the reserved space file , this will delete your pics but it generally fixes most issues i have on xbox
---
i find if that happens, sometimes spinning the object around and around while spamming the "place object" button helps get it set down
---
Damn you have to kill two birds with one stone? These challenges ARE ridiculous.
---
Encryptid event is probably your best bet. People going down left and right, and there's a pool of toxic water on the hill. People are too busy looking at the giant glowing murder bot to notice where they walk
---
I "move" my base about 5 times a day because I normally have it placed in or near Prime. This way it only costs 40 caps to "repair" my base every time it is nuked or destroyed by 5 scorched beasts. All items are repaired when you move your base. Have you ever tried to repair a radiation shower! good god! love the 40 caps cost!
---
Sorry
---
Lol, a quick google search? You know most of things, in addition to be googled without 0 knowledge, can also be studied?  
---
So in fact I could open my micro / macroeconomy books from university, and probably find out better than a google search. Or I just could make memory and still have better information than you.  
---
But to be honest, I hated that matter so much the books are probably lost, and I can hardly remember ANYTHING from that subject XDDD.  
---
But anyway, I know you are wrong. And not only that, but the fact that if inflation is any concern in this game's economy, you did probably suggest the worst suggestion possible out there, only thinking about yourself and how you play and like to play xD.  
---
Downvoting your answer as well, sorry XDD
---
Ugh. Bummer. I have water pumps in my camp for visitors to take but everyone is too polite. Was hoping the bowls would be an obvious way to give out free water.
---
Lol, I didn’t mean THAT kind of “next to”!

And it’s be Saurosexual, I think ;)

Tyrannosaurus Sex?

You're the one crying and whinging about it. I'm just pointing out the truth to you. If you don't want to hear the truth don't go whining and complaining to a discussion board. Tell your dog. He'll be much more sympathetic.

495 below 30%hp
---
That's nice.
---
Let me come steal your water
---
I use a full set of unyielding and with the backpack plus high capacity mod. I'm able to a good haul of loot and resources. I had a small issue because I was on low health my weight limit was capped at 400 and I've carried more then that. I think it was a glitch because after server hopping it was no longer capped at 400.
---
Feel free to send a friend invite. I'm online somewhat randomly, more on weekends.
---
What's your build?
---
Have to agree with you. I dont defend nor do i want any part in duping debating.  I bet its only a few of ppl complaining that actually is affected by dupers...how many of you have bought a weapon that probably is duped ? I have bought from the market that probably is a copy, no way to tell 
---
But im not gonna loose sleep over it
---
How is your carry weight at 460!?!
---
I have maxed strength, 3 pieces unyeilding armor and with low health and the unyeilding and a 60lbs backpack I'm at 390.
---
370 (I think) with full health.
---
How much does high capacity hold?
---
This thread is my poor deathclaw gauntlet to a T

Found it! And for some reason the vile ticks there counted for the challenge, thanks folks.
---
You’re the best!
---
Haha thanks my dude. Ill sort through my stuff and see if i have any low tier stuff. I should, i remember a furiois lead pipe lvl 10 with ss lol
---
That be awesome I’ll pay if you want! I won’t be on till tomorrow though
---
As someone who doesn't visit the market the price of legendaries in my vendor bothered me greatly. I was selling a furious 50. cal MG for 500; wondered if that was too high, then too low. I've heard people say the 50. cal is sought after and furious is pretty useful on it i'd think. 
---
Suffice to say it hasn't sold yet, but i've only had about 5 people visit my vendor in total.
---
 I have killed many Mothmen. I have lost count. ;)
---
Actually, you could also put miner keys in the bowl, too. (Probably fixed when they reactivate it)
---
Works for me on PC aswell.
---
Lookout for this dude at a Whitesprings Station near you! Free water and crafting stations in a convenient location!

Not pictured: Me on the front porch playing banjo.
---
Instead of building a wall do a powered door (without keypad).  They default to open when they have power. 
---
So what you do is build your room with the power door being the only access visitors can use.  Wire the door to your vending machine(s).  Now you need a power conduit, one that you can travel through walls.  Connect one side to your vending machines and the other side to a switch.  Place the switch in a place where you only access, adding additional conduits if you need to pass through more walls.
---
Now with a flip of the switch all the power goes off in that room, no longer broadcasting your location and closing the door.
---
Hidden damage reduction % with PA.
---
Yeah. Same thing happened to me as well. Hit me up anytime IGN Robofox5
---
awesome! I honestly had no idea that avatar stuff still existed lol
---
I swear I never saw Grahm ever when I leveled my first character.
---
Twice now he's saved my life and I was able to make a few caps, God bless Grahm
---
Works with a steady playerbase however this game has a pretty low one.
---
I noticed that as well and it made me go back to PA
---
Maybe the cameras were extremely early prototypes of the Institute teleported...
---
Hidden rad resistance as well...
---
i giggled at how you associated Harley riders with wearing eyeliner
---
IGN bentsteele81, we have a group that is on most evenings between 5-9 pm Central. Be of good humor and Discord is a plus.
---
It's gonna be a limb damage calculation I think. Are you using max Adamantium Skeleton?
---
Btw, how did you get to 543? Even with full raider buttressed and Iron Clad I think I only made it to about 430 or something around there
---
Just sounds like you're all buttmad ground babies.
---
It does, that's how I've been having to do it. Really earning the badges like a good Scout.
---
It's fixed. (At least for me)
---
In the past you could place a normal item.
---
Then store it.
---
Then go to stored items and change it's appearance.
---
It used to let you choose atomic skins even if you didn't purchase it but that was a glitch and was fixed.
---
If you have one already laid down (and haven't bought it) don't store it or it'll default back to the regular skin and lock out the atomic skin now.
---
No, no one else placed it. You did but didn't notice you changed appearance. No one can place atomic items at another person's camp.
---
You are looking at it individually how many people play FO76 that's a lot of caps entering the economy and diluting the value of caps why don't poor countries just print more money and give it to their citizens.
---
People use the currency as toilet paper because toilet paper is worth more due to hyperinflation just ask citizens of Venezuela and Zimbabwe
---
I like the way this guy thinks.. :) let's see the glowing green guys!! gear-up ... urup..
---
230 No PA no Backpack
---
So...many...penises
---
Also on ps4, I have purchased things from an unpowered, unmarked camp location that I stumbled across. 
---
It should be this way, but its not.
---
I'm pretty sure you cant have both Two shot and Assassin on the same item.
---
 I gave a level 35 3* Unyielding bit to a level 37 in the Whitespring. Seemed a shame to take it to the Station when so  many want that armour.
---
 He was pleased. ;)
---
Aahh! Thank you... Google didn't even know.
---
You make it sound like that is, somehow, less interesting...I hadn't given thought to peasant clothing of medieval Belarus, but now I'm curious damnit.
---
All perks, alot of vanguard's
---
Great, now I have the serums I want and my shops are full, I can go back to adventuring.
---
No skeleton because I read it only avoids chance of getting crippled
---
same applies to having em all always available, im sure even toybox pa skin would have sold much more if it was a timed exclusive than having it always there. Steady playerbase or not xD
---
I did athlete and mammologist, and after making this post I grinded archer out in like 30 minutes. I was gonna do swimmer but I run a bloodied build and I woulda died swimming lmao
---
I think mine is in the low 300 range.  The weight thing has always puzzled me.  I prefer to carry as few items as possible because I don't like having my inventory a cluttered mess.  At the same time the stash weight seems odd to me as well because you wouldn't actually be carrying it around so why have a limit at all?  If I use that logic though, a non-power armour person could really only haul around maybe 100 lbs. without having a beast of burden or cart of some sort.  Even Grahm has a beast of burden.
---
Call in an Orbital Strike.  Or three.
---
I feel you. I had this exact problem 2 months after the game came out. No matter how much armor you have outside of power armor, it will never actually be “Tanky”
---
I forget if you still take damage from most things when you’re in power armor, but I’ve realized that outside of power armor, you will always take, at the least, 1 dmg from anything that hits you. That may not seem like a lot, but when you character only has so much health, you notice it.
---
Thanks! Wish they would show up in the avatar editor after redeem these...cant find them
---
I don't think that was the case. Other legendary armor effects like weight reduction are additive (with a 90% cap in that case). Also saw plenty of videos and stories of people being outright invincible with sentinel and assassin's going above 100% resistance. Maybe that by itself was the bug
---
But that’s players inflating the value of items, you’re point was regarding the validity of faction vendors and the faction vending will always be essential for low level players.
---
Well, at least the Super Mutant I met had a [different idea of "fun"](https://i.imgur.com/PjOgB8Y.jpg)
---
Seems like they are just broken. I have had VERY low flying vertibots and cargobots (like so close I could almost melee it with marsupial) and even while jumping it would not count for the challenge. When I shot them down, about half the parts always disappear. The other half does not count for the challenge
---
What you said! This could be it’s own quest - maybe a “Cub Reporter” for Grafton’s mayor to drum up some positive PR!

So paleontologists work with dinosaur bones, archaeologists work with people bones, bones are bones, archaeologists work with dinosaur bones.  Got it.

Multi purpose build I use a TSE handmade, a TSE shotgun, and death claw depending on what I am doing. Level 180.  I swap out lock pick, hacking, crafting as needed.  My handmade puts out about 130 damage, combat shotgun about 240 and deathclaw is 260.

The aforementioned top of the world run takes like 30 minutes.  Harpers ferry and grafton(if youre low level) work great too because they're full of enemies who drop guns and have a vendor located in the middle.

If you dont care about caps, so be it.  All I'm saying is 1400c isn't difficult to generate at all.  Mostly responding to this idea that generating vendor trash needs to be "your job"

Unfortunately for those who use power armor, we are just stuck. Lol

This kind of thing sucks because I have a pair of pressure plates on either side my camps only unlocked door so people dont leave it open.  I have to regularly walk out and step on it myself in front of them because people are afraid I'm trying to kill them.  Like no bud, I want you to buy rediculous amounts plans and underarmor from me and make me rich, killing you is counterproductive. Lol
---
You will be able to play with people in different regions, yes.
---
As far as the region/VPN question, you should be able to do that too.  I'm in the US, but bought a code from some other country and redeemed it (via VPN) just fine.  Don't have to use the VPN to play it.

A lot of those military camps in the cranberry bog will have one either in a tent or in the back of a jeep
---
Oh you work for Bethesda?
---
Yeah but there’s one particular location where they were putting down riots - lots of military..
---
I can't even imagine how often people hear the word carcinology and assume you study cancer.  I'm fairly broadly educated and I've never heard the term before now.  Hell, my auto-correct fought me on it just now and insisted I meant carcinoma.
---
I think this also true for selling them to the vendors. I couldn't sell a painted weapon a few weeks ago, took the paint off and was able to sell it.
---
Lol duping has made prices drop dramatically... we know how dumb you are.
---
I’m equally annoyed by the fact we can use VATS to teleport into melee range from 15 feet away as long as there is a clear path, but god forbid there’s an open doorway or slight elevation change and it drops to 0% chance, even at point-blank range.
---
In regards to the short bursts: does it only last for bursts when a player is holding the jump key or is that for efficiency on power cores?
---
Yeah, they're all janky since the last update.  Sometimes they'll attack in a sitting position too.  Sometimes the charred ghouls will be labeled as ferals and vice versa.
---
Then too many people would be complaining that they got banned for drawing Deathclaws with penis-horns
---
Have an update. Wish I could do more than one!
---
Yup. Sometimes thing spawn under the world, too, and can still hit you through the ground, and you have to wait until a bottom of a foot pops up somewhere.
---
We can dream!
---
I didn’t see the third star but I knew it was a two shot explosive (let’s be honest everyone and their mother has one of those)
---
...jesus christ.
---
Could find the Sheepsquatch that destroyed him and his friends, but made sure to shank that green bastard.
---
All my questions answered easily, thanks!
---
Kill two bloatflies with one paddle ball string.
---
You can run from the Shitfuckening,
---
But you can't *hide* from the shitfuckening.  
---
Ps: If you're dumb enough to randomly accept team invites it's your own fault, blame the game all you want on this one, but you're the morons.
---
It's funny, I don't see any of these people coming out with their own 60 dollar game.
---
I have hundreds of hours on this game and maybe a handful or less would be considered "not fun." 
---
I'm playing. I'm having fun. People that love 76 are here and we don't like the people compaining either. I guess it's just trendy to be an asshole right now.
---
Just remember that when all is said and done, people are talking about the game. If it was TRULY bad and COMPLETELY dead nobody would be saying anything.
---
I have unyielding and mine jumps up to 485 when around 40%
---
I don't think you need the plans? They're in the resources tab with the other extractors.
---
Everyone has the same capability to use melee and do the same damage. If they choose not to thats on them. I have the ability to run both melee builds and heavy guns. Now I'm working on pistol build.
---
Its not too bad swimming you an just use a diluted rad-x and get up to around 50%...  the swimming part isn't underwater even.  Just clear the mirelurk queen if you're worried first, first time I did it I swam around her and she never got to me.  And its easier for you to die for someone to revive - we jumped from my bloodied character's roof into the river below, it was a lot of fun and laughs.  And one of my team mates kept healing because we didn't bother with a ladder to heaven, so it took 2-3 jumps to die (for most of us anyways)...  and that was after he took off his falling armor.
---
no, that value has been diluted through people duping thousands of tse handmades, tesla rifles, serum recipes, nuka grapes, assassin sentinel armor, x-01 jet packs, etc

 Its about 230 normally and 280 with my PA on. Yup I can run! ;)
---
 I have been playing Fallout 3D games for a long time. I got over taking everything many years ago. ;)
---
High capacity holds 120 
---
I also have deep pocketed for all my armor and some has +1 strength
---
Depends on my mood. Usually rock ritual bindings/mask for the creepy effect, but recently started a tin foil hat, straitjacket, welding goggles, surgical mask combo. Just picked up the fake Sheepsquatch outfit, so I'll start playing around with pieces for that.
---
Glad it wasn't just me!
---
I did a scan/repair before I posted this, I thought might fix it to
---
.. just moved a bunch of Strength points to Perception (am trying to reorganize to a vats rifle build) and am now rocking 215 carry weight..
---
..with my armor and weapons, that leaves me room to pick up one duct tape and perhaps a fuse.
---
I have some at my shop, but killing moleminers is the easiest way.
---
They are using stealth boys and using the perks that triple the duration of them
---
Every once in a great while that works for me. But, man, it shouldn’t be this difficult to build simple structures. Building, as in FO4, is one of my favorite parts of the game.
---
You want an extractor? I believe you can claim a workshop and then those are available for resource deposits as well.
---
Sentinel or specific enemy type legendary modifiers.
---
I have been hoarding plans for month for this exact reason. Knowledge is literally power in this game and players shouldn’t have to spend an arm and a leg just to buy plans from a robot vendor.
---
They turning it off and back on again.
---
Literally. I've found that exiting build mode and then going into build mode will clear so many placement issues.
---
I don't play PvP but is there a reason a dense armor mod or Fireproof aren't a reasonable defense against these? Seems like that should negate the explosive damage and from there it's just a laser rifle which aren't all that great.
---
 I have boost on mine and its about right.
---
Jump jet uses up your AP, when you run out of AP, bye bye jets.  If you don't burst, your flight time will be very limited.  Bursting extends your flight time a bit but you can't continuously fly around which is what I first thought jet packs would allow you to do.
---
If you’re still looking...or even playing I’ll help gt AmandaJ79
---
Also rock radicool to boost strength
---
That is the location but you still need plans to learn and build it.
---
No. But chainsaws are ok.
---
370 with a regular backpack haven’t gotten high capacity yet
---
I always just rebuild when I move. But I really enjoy building, and like to mix it up.
---
Vanguard resistances drop off quite quickly as you get damaged where the PA will remain consistent.
---
No, It's the game.. not your system. The client freezes you can't do anything but all others just see you standing there with health going down with hits and when they kill the attacker, your health goes back up if you have health factor.
---
I have Windows 7 Ultimate, all service packs/fixes, SSD C:, 24GB RAM, with Nvidia 970.

But thats how I lure people into my Vending Machine death trap on survival. 20 weapons for sale? Guess what they are all pipe pistols and you just triggered my rocket turrets.
---
He wants the Brahmin Pen Plan
---
It's my wife's biggest complaint, "Why sell fancy floors if there aren't matching walls?"
---
True
---
I have no clue what to rename it, there's several. I would show you a pic but I dont know how to do it
---
Look at your network. I get this when I'm on wifi when there's heavy wifi traffic. Plugging in reduces it, but if people on my network are streaming netflix or similar it will still cause stuttering. Playing when nobody else in the house is using streaming services gets rid of it almost entirely. I'm on a 75mbit connection.
---
One man's garbage is another person's ungarbage
---
Did everyone forget that everybody was screaming about 1000's of people compromised and then they had to apologize because it was only 63?
---
Cool thx
---
What are you searching for? Just wondering if your'e looking for "fertilizer producer" as that is not what it's called. Its "Brahmin Pen"...  could explain why you can't find it..
---
Even if the armor does not stack additively, luck-based PvP is not fun. I still think the legendary effects should be changed to guarantee a 7% or 8% damage reduction.
---
It's a huge missed opportunity for people who like decorating their camps.
---
yeah I've got a ton of spare unyielding that I put in my vendor for cheap, hope it's useful to somebody
---
You don't need tourist the broken cameras can be randomly found all over now . You can craft extra but can't give them away...
---
Vats critical head shot dont care what armor you have fix your perks
---
I used to just dump them whenever I run across low level players so now I sell all known plans for 10 caps each
---
I told you he was onto us!
---
Weight be weird sometimes. I’ve had where i would be “overweight” but wi wouldn’t be and only at 1 or 2 below my weight
---
Montressor!
---
I watched a teammate place my red stove and this was months ago, I'm still able to store and replace just the red stove.
---
A good trick is to hang walls down from the upper floors.  For whatever reason, wall collision is VERY generous.
---
So you can pretty reliably clip walls through the ground and hide that you're a single foundation build.  Nice bonus is that it lets you plant inside and protect your precious vegetable starch supply. 
---
The big exception is water.  The c.a.m.p. system does not like walls, or most anything EXCEPT foundations having collision with water.
---
Oh I get it now you're under the impression I ripped off your post? If that's the case I didn't even see your post.
---
My wife agrees with your wife. My wife wants a fancy cabin.
---
The [under-armors](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing#Underarmor) tend to fall into categories of Casual, Raider, Vault-Tec, BOS, or Enclave. These bonuses never change except from the categories. There are no other categories even for Atom Shop items. It'll increase INT if it coincidences with the Casual category.
---
Also TIL the marine under suit is independent from all other categories.
---
I have my strength at 15 and sure as Hell helps with weight lol
---
I love having deep picked too. High capacity will definitely help you once you get it
---
This is how I got it. You have to be very close to it also.
---
If we get rid of faction vendors, how is anyone going to caps if nobody wants to buy what they’re selling?
---
Say I put some bulk ceramic in the play vendor. It’s going to sit there for hours on end unless someone just happens to need ceramic.
---
I upvote you sir but please give a description of what “country roads” is for my reading pleasure.
---
How about we just don't have weapons, or ways to fight at all? Hmm, things would still get duped. Ok, how about we just have nothing at all, then nothing can be duped? Maybe we should just watch movies instead, cause no matter what, something is going to get duped. Could be water, could be food, could be anything someone would be willing to pay money for.
---
This. My husband is the one with the jacked up computer, and I'm just over here telling him that streaming could pay for a new gpu!
---
Ah for sure, didn't even think of Vanguard lol
---
I thought the Adamantium Skeleton did reduce HP loss, but it appears you are correct there. 
---
Instead it seems the PA reduces HP loss lol something to look into
---
It looks more Barbarian-ish with the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit.
---
JUST HAPPENED TO ME OMG
---
Sniper rifle or anti material rifle
---
The jumps weren't bad when you had a 200 cap limit per faction. I think they pooled it because a lot of the players were probably doing the daily jumps anyway. Now it's faster. Prices have stayed around the same since then so over reacting? The cap limit of 25k may have something to do with it too.
---
So what happens when countries keep printing money you must have studied this,
---
I like having plenty of extra weight so I can freely pick up weapons and armor to Decon once I’m able to get to a bench.
---
Hahahahahahaha, no-name. Great reference.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
😲 just random spawns line junk items or are they different items that trigger the quest?
---
True. I'm online and it says my weight limit is 390 and it's supposed to be 420
---
My hoarding days started with NV :*)
---
So far I tested it with Imposter Sheepsquatch Helmet, Welding Helmet, and Green Hood and it works with those.
---
It does not work with Wrapped Cap.
---
I get the MQ &amp; SB fights near my Camp regularly, and since the last patch, I'm also getting the SheepSquatch vs Gulpers, vs SuperMutants pretty often, the SheepSquatch totally Dominates the others, so I just try to tag them at range and wait til it's over, then kill the Squatch, and it's usually still at 80%+ health and not yet healed.
---
Your weight should be at 430 if I’m not wrong lol
---
i hate also when i want to move my building in my camp i cant hold down e to move everything that's touching each other like in fallout 4
---
I've found the tourist many times at Wavy Willards, in the parking lot against a car.
---
Be nice to have a wooden sign we could carve into also
---
so.. to show your poor victim you arent some weird creep you take out a camera and make pics of him. solid choice, suddenly a lot less creepy xD
---
Same issue.. I'm a PRE-Order person played since release.. I've discovered all places and challenges won't give me credit for my efforts.
---
I've been cheated the opportunity of these Atoms that others can earn.
---
Than Tses shouldn't have been nerfed either in that logic
---
Have any diseases ?
---
The auto-grenade launcher is my favorite street-sweeper.  It both suck and is hilarious when the first bodies to drop start flying a block or two away!
---
It's a glitch. Happened to me a couple times. 4 machines to refill
---
It will be when I get the mod ya
---
All my armor is deep pocketed leather armor. Mainly, I wear the Newsboy Cap and Field Scribe Armor, which adds to my packrat look. Only issue right now with the outfit is the backpack shows up clipping with the outfit backpacks. But the backpack is invisible with other outfits that have backpacks, such as the Union Outfit.
---
For fun, I sometimes run around in the Fasnacht Man Mask and Clown costume while wielding a puncturing fire axe.
---
Sounds good. I will have to look you up. My Gt is Atomic Punk 152. Thanks for the reply.
---
Um, no dude. Caps have no value already is what I'm saying. In real life money buys necessities. In 76 you find that shit on the ground and the necessary things are randomly dropped.
---
Yeah. I miss that too.
---
You sir, are doing Atom's work.  You can drink for free at my bar any time.
---
*As he peeks over rock*
---
Thanks, I'll add you &amp; come back on now
---
Also the bivouac just down the hill on the east side of West Tek.
---
I never said AS/AC was still OP, what I don't like is how instead of reducing the damage reduction, they added a chance to them. This negatively affects both the wearer and the attackers because it turns PvP more luck-based.
---
Also, any decent player knows how to make VATS basically useless against them.
---
Is that a better location to server hop? Maybe a higher spawn frequency?
---
Only after you've gotten your first one and the quest, not before.
---
Will have to look you up. My GT is Atomic Punk 152. I'm usually on after 6:00 or so EST. Thanks for the response.
---
Not sure, but that's deffinatly where I've found him the most.
---
David Attenborough would be proud! 
---
And here, we see the vault dweller, going about his daily grind. We’re almost sure he’s chosen the fireman’s helmet, as some kind of matting display. But alas, there are no females to be found, and the vault dweller moves on.
---
Me too, I play alone :( need some new friends and wants to compete the task too. I'm on PS4, drop your gtag and I'll add you (mine is a shitty tag)
---
It's not particularly feasible. While it could be done, it would likely require completely redoing how you load into the world. It can't check if your camp can be built until it has already loaded the world, because it needs the world loaded to know if someone else's camp is already placed where yours would go.
---
There’s a bug out rn where you can learn the plan without having to use the plan itself. It automatically becomes known once you touch it. Just learned it earlier by buying it for 10k than trading it back for 9k. So learned it for only 1k without having to do challenges
---
Its meth in pill form....so yeah it helps you concentrate lol
---
Civilization, Fallout (any of them), Skyrim...
---
Sleep is for the weak. 😄
---
Are these limited time?
---
Well that don't make any sense at all does it
---
I just checked and no diseases I might need to check my gear to see if I'm missing something.
---
You are right, but I still want a cow like Grahm has.  I think I got used to having Dogmeat around and I need a pet.
---
Players inflating the value of items are the economy. ( if caps were not so abundant they could not "inflate the price" because no one would have the caps to pay the asking price.
---
Generally, closing and reopening the build menu will clear a lot of placement problems for me.
---
Those types of people are immature d-bags that wouldn't have the balls to start something face to face. Their basically cowards in real life.
---
Ok thanks
---
Me!
---
Can you toss a Mirelurk queen a mentat for breath?
---
Awesome lol
---
Yeah, if this guy was high, I must be on crack. I've put 10s of hours into builds before!
---
I got it from the supply requisition drop. I did mine near Flatwoods. Called the drop and ran to the middle of the area circle with my camera ready.
---
TSE isnt even the best. Wouldnt change anything.
---
Theres mods and perk cards that reduce TSE damage down to almost nothing.
---
Also on another note, you can enter someones house if they locked the doors by clicking on a bench through a window lol
---
It solves the “nothing is selected” message for me but not the “intersecting” and “floating” problems.
---
And there should be fishing!
---
It looks so good
---
You know.. that thing that looks like lava and runs like dog?
---
They sometimes die right in front of you as well.
---
Next time fast travel somewhere with enemies.
---
Death fixes it without server hopping.
---
Assasin is not a big deal anymore. Sentinal is wanted by some, I think your Marine Armour is overpriced but I don't like Marine anyway.
---
 Why would anyone pay for a Drill? I could make one beastly but hey, its not as good as my knives, nothing really is. ;)
---
Once, yesterday or the day before.  Hadn't happened at all before that though.
---
Also be sure to have adamantium skeleton on or you will become crippled very easily outside of pa. Not sure if it increases the dmg you take, but is very annoying. I personally wear a full vanguard set, and use a Vamp ss mole gauntlet for close up. And a Vamp explosive 50 cal for ranged, keeping your hp up is huge with a vanguard set. (had a Vamp expl Gattling but 50 has a higher rate of fire)
---
Clapping cheeks
---
Just wait till next patch; they’ll probably re-break it...
---
I'm not being an asshole. You appear to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what "NPC" means. In any case, why do NPCs need to be human? I'd love to run into a ghoul settlement or something that actually makes sense canonically.  Living human NPCs wouldn't fit unless they expand into Ohio or PA.
---
I've got like 4 ppl in there :O
---
So why is there a 25k cap limit and cap sinks if "caps have no value" and Bethesda was not the least worried about the FO76 economy.
---
I appreciate the info, however I legitimately watched someone on my team place it for me because he didn’t like the look of the other one.
---
Yes there is always a counter ....
---
It wasn't my experience. I had 1 t-posing enemy and a crash during launch. The worse I experienced is the stash menu chugged horribly. 
---
Can we agree how disingenious it is for youtubers to put out a call for "funniest 76 glitches", putting out a compilation video of those and calling it a review. How can you call it a review when 90% of what you're showing is someone else's experience. Or different snippets of one clip? Or it's disingenuous to put out a review when you admit you haven't played the game long? Especially when in the review you rant about things that aren't an issue? (Talking about skill up ranting on being overencumbered and taking everything back to his camp to break down when there are workbenches and stash boxes all around) (note: the "compilation" quote isn't about skill up)
---
Why can't you place more than one at a time?
---
My pirate wears a monacle
---
My question is how many legendaries does a lvl 7 get to scrap? What will a lvl 7 get from the purveyor?
---
I did Archer, Hunter and Mammalogist. I had to look up a steady spot for cat spawns for the picture, and  I got lucky with milking the Brahmin, but worked out well for me.
---
Ikr
---
Some people still take workshops.  Or, ya know, don’t want to be inconvenienced by assholes
---
Which is funny considering this is probably the only one where hed come back if you kill him.
---
There are other ways to get caps then Player/ Faction vending.
---
Or have some pre-printed ones, like the letters. That would be awesome. And yes, I would spend the evil atom points for it too. lol.
---
It's more about the areas you seem to be moving to there are level maps for suggested levels of players. As an example, if you don't want to see level 69 attackers.. don't go into the Crimson Bog.
---
Sounds like he did it wrong. Delete your custom.ini file and it should fix it.
---
So far only 2 scout dailies
---
Yes only those 3 dailies show in terminal
---
Yes many of the badges are glitched or require something not in the game (stimpack defusser)
---
Which perks should I invest in for a pistol build ? I have a bloodied revolver that does 200damage without perks and I'd like it to do more
---
Depending on how many items they got dropped and same as a any other level.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/KdCRW5y
---
If I had my druthers, rare apparel claw machine.  I'd fill it with all the ones I come across so spending a cap or two per attempt was worth it and just as much rng as finding it out in the world.
---
Idk why but it won't let me. Like I've tried and it flashes up for a second and then disappears
---
If things go like they almost always have, there will be no update on Thursday (Tuesday is the normal maintenance day, and I don't think any patches are being applied today).  Assuming they have even figured out what's causing this (and I have my doubts), I don't think you'll see an update to this until next Tuesday at the earliest.
---
BGS powerless against duping clans
---
Its like the saying cash money but fallout 76
---
I'm wired directly to router. No one else is using connection except me (not that hard since there is only two potential users).
---
That sucks. Hopefully there will be a hotfix soon.
---
That’s just ridiculous. You’ve got an idea in your head and you’re not prepared to accept that people disagree with you. You’ve completely lost my interest.
---
Hate to break it to you, but no software update on Thursday, just the timed turn on of the Purveyor (like with the Sheepsquatch). Next patch will probably be when they release display cases.
---
Was that adventure or survival?  There hasn’t be a way to actually kill someone through pacifist since the bobbleheads’ stacking got fixed
---
Has to be the tourist to trigger the quest. After quest is triggered, if you accidentally scrap your new camera, they appear in junk containers after the quest has started.
---
Chairs , if theres not enough room to sit down it will show the error. Or portable toilets - not enough space for door to open
---
ED-E and Dogmeat or Rex? Sure, why not.
---
Agreed. Especially since it gives us the ability to stick to the man on them vendor bot prices. (minus fallout taxes of course lol)
---
Also I just run around with no armor well no clothes either just my action lever
---
Xbox is where I get my 76
---
People will hoard them cause they’re not as easy to obtain. Last think you need to worry about is the economy, just play the game
---
Survival.
---
Not true. 
---
The quest has to be triggered with the tourist before the pro snap cameras appear in the world.
---
Before the triggering the quest you'll only find broken cameras... Not broken PRO SNAP camera.
---
Have to activate the quest first.
---
Added. Let's get it!
---
Probably next patch, which would be the 21st.
---
Added!
---
It does. It's the letter in the tourist that triggers the quest, not the camera itself.
---
Maybe they are able to ban the copy of those Players.
---
From what I've been reading (and this could be totally wrong) its happening after server hopping for people (and once for myself). So hop less or just stay in one world to limit the chance of this happening. If that doesn't help then I don't know. Best of luck.
---
420 with the backpack.
---
My wife wants your wife lol
---
So we have this sweet 25k (17.5k) mutation serum recipes, that no longer drops from the SBQ, as a capsinks. Dont forget about other expensive recipes - PA mods for example. 
---
And I am 100% sure that number of players, who obtain 1400 caps from faction vendors every single day, is significantly lower than 184k.
---
10 hours lol wtffff. You on ps4? Let me come see ur castle.
---
I don't know where you spawn in relation to the tourist at Wavy Willards, but if it's much of a walk, I'd try server hopping at the Whitespring entrance.  The tourist is draped over the hood of a red car just a few yards from where you spawn there.  You should be able to check a respawn in &lt;1 minute there until you find him/her.
---
Yeah it's really frustrating. I feel like my bases aren't huge, and yet every time I rebuild, I'll have it almost how I want it and then run out of space. And the keep adding new things to decorate with, which means I have to delete other things.  
---
I understand that they don't want camps to be too detailed, for server stability reasons, but my little tiny camp isn't even as big as pretty much any location in the game. Someone mentioned the inter-activeness being part of the issue, ok fine. Make our bases undamageable. Being attacked by random creatures is stupid anyway. All it does is create minor damage, like every time I go home I have to fix a railing or a wall. Whoop de do. And the very rare time I need to repair more than that,  it was because other players destroyed it, and they can't even do that now.  Maybe make different rules for the Survival Server and the Adventure Server. You can have your smaller Survival CAMP, and your larger Adventure CAMP.
---
Ok I will make a post and ask how many players sell over 1400 caps daily to faction vendor's  I used a small number of players 184,000 to get my bad math.
---
ok thanks alot dude
---
Copy of what players? Are people duping entire accounts now? 
---
I think if they could detect duped items they'd do something about it but unfortunately they can't
---
Haha that’s great I saw one who’s hand had glued to a pipe he’d fallen off in the same place I took that shot, like he was hanging on for dear life
---
Great idea. Scenario: old-school duper wants to get someone banned. He drops 2 TSE pump shotguns at someone's feet. They pick them up. Instaban. Gotta think through how stuff can be abused ;)
---
Vanguard deteriorates quick - so your DR drops like a rock as health goes down.
---
Go on survival hunt solo players.
---
Ok sweet
---
Yes I did server hop, but it’s frustrating to have to stay in one world for hours just to keep my machines alive.  I just wanna cry when it happens cause it takes SO LONG to reprice everything.
---
Yeah, but if you're already maxed out, you have to delete stuff to put it in. We're either constantly having to rebuild smaller structures to have more stuff, or larger structures with less in it.
---
I missed it the first time looking too, don’t feel bad
---
230-240 depending on what ive had to eat..
---
HAHAHAHA THANK YOU
---
Harper's ferry to rhe left of the rail road bridge on the hill theres a resource pit with it
---
Wear it......
---
....profit
---
Nope. I don't even have the game installed anymore, sorry.
---
I hope you're just adding to my statement and not thinking I'm actually claiming they did. I am merely listing other complaints others had about the game. And how these were more prevalent than bug comments before the YouTube crowd got involved.
---
Wherever I hang my hat, that's my home. 😆
---
Not for me personally, but it looks good.
---
I  found mine at the Miners monument on the stairs.  It took me over a week to find it but I only would look at that one place and server hop for about 20 min.  Good luck hope you find it quickly
---
What system I just found ansel at the teapot
---
LOL I ran into this the other day. Annoying as hell.

Hmm... I think I'd prefer it as just a player initiated, shared on reddit thing. If you make it a quest, it would be depending on you having the camera. I still don't have it, because I can't find the time to server hop for an hour or two and I'm probably not alone in that. I'm already bummed out that I can't do a lot of the Scout challenges yet, so I'd prefer not to be locked out of more quests.
---
Unless the quest would be prefaced by a quest to find the tourist, including a handy map marker to his location. Than I'm all in and I want it in the game yesterday :p
---
yeah i checked that i bought the plan and i got the pistol not the rifle thanks i guess
---
I carry a big 2h instigating on all PA users. An instigating sledge, fire axe or siper sledge can breeze you through the Whitespring one shotting most things with no perks.
---
I love my flamer on my heavy spec'd character, but that instigating fire axe really helps save fuel. I can swap perks if I want (and do for silos) but really it is so handy for pve.

With my build I’m doing slightly over 1000 with a regular meat hook. My bloodied meat hook does 2500-2700.
---
I have found that accessing the Pip-Boy (in manual view mode, not the one from Power Armor) gets me unstuck.
---
My plan is similar but I'm going to start with a focus on 2 stars.  I have decent 1 star primary weapons that are working for my build, I also have 1 explosive 3 star lever but the other effects are sub optimal (zealots and +1 agi)
---
So my goal is to try to obtain upgrades to my existing loadout by hopefully getting comparable items with similar primary effects and a useful secondary.
---
I suspect that will take ages so once that's done only then will I worry about 3* gear.
---
I refuse to trade with players because I like the chase and if I had every item I wanted I'd probably stop playing :P
---
Also, the basic wooden door with the broken glass windows?
---
Yeah, you can interact with stuff through it.  Found a guy who had the presence of mind to close AND lock all his windows and I thought maybe I'd finally found an uncrackable base.  Then I saw the door, and just within reach of it...a Tinker's workbench.  I think, no...it can't work...but 'lo and behold, I stuck my hand right through and BAM! I'm in his house touching his stuff.
---
With changes to c.a.m.p. damage and the inability to steal things there's no real harm done.  But like a cat on a counter-top, it's turned into a game for me.  If you lock your house up I'll spend however long it takes to find a way in. 
---
Just to see if I can.
---
No, the vendor is in the game they are just waiting to release it because Bethesda.
---
I'm on ps4
---
oh sure, when it fits a Queen it lands.....
---
Love the guy, but that shit would have made me attack him on sight! Give me that legendary item!! (most likely a 1-star berserker switchblade)
---
You offer it as a sacrifice to godd howard
---
No OC. Temps are fine, about 62C on GPU and 45C on CPU, I would say that's pretty low while gaming. I'll check them again in a few hours just to be sure.
---
It's not like colors are inverted, it looks more like lightning isn't applied to chunk (how's that called in Beth engine, exterior cell?) of a map. It sometimes pops in after a while, sometimes not.
---
CTD with FO4/SSE is quite common in my country, it looks like something is geoblocked, because when I block that games in firewall or use a VPN from other country it works fine. It started after some Creators Club update. It was a [pretty big topic on Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/1618346571421475711/?ctp=14). So much time passed and no patch for it still :(.
---
I see the tourist on top of the light house everytime I go there
---
Then that's new because even 2 days ago, atomic items don't show in the build menu when at another person's camp.
---
Me and my son we're on a team and I tried to see if I could place the deathclaw plant... It doesn't even show in the menu unless I go to my camp.
---
I found my tourist at the base of the Mothman statue in Point Pleasant... Took about fifteen hops.
---
Dude you just shouldn't do this kind of thing lol
---
I have 2 weapons that I will never ever get rid of.... I got them both around level 50 and they were amazing.
---
1* instigating lever action.... One shots almost everything within reason.
---
2* executioners ski sword 40% more attack damage
---
I spent so long with them I just couldn't imagine giving them to someone else now. They'd still be perfectly fine for me to use now, but onwards and upwards.
---
I appreciate it. :D Yeah, the Wukd Appalachia quests re-hooked me, and they kept me around with promise of The Purveyor. I have a gambling problem.
---
Call a supply bot and stand under it as it lands.
---
I would've just come here, give my xbox name and ask someone if can kill me just to revive. And i do the same, then we Both completed that objective
---
😂
---
I have a Max budget base and can fill my vendors completely without using camp budget 
---
It's supposed to go off stash budget.
---
i'd love a story station, always loved the Daring Dashwood stories from 3.
---
Doesn't the chameleon mutation require no armor? So it would be a choice for those.
---
Also a choice for the people that sacrifice defense for weight be using the lighter variants of armor.
---
Yea I had 120 items to replace and re-price and it was a pain. I was just lucky enough it only happened to me once. I also don't server hop frequently so maybe that's why?
---
check the post here, it talks about changing the pipboy colors by editing the .ini file (down a little ways)

shut up drills are super valuable

what about Tactics and BoS?

I love building against a rock wall or two.  If I can find a crevice to build my camp into that's two less directions that enemies can come from.

This and near a resource node of my choosing :)
---
Dear god, don’t give them ideas!!
---
There was a duping exploit on Xbox a few days ago.
---
They patched it I believe.
---
But the damage was already done.
---
No ban waves at this time possibly because it was isolated, ate up the dupers caps and could only dupe 1 item/stack at a time and didn't cause server instability.
---
Grind for the armor mod and refrigerated mod to get maximum use in my opinion. My personal favorite is the armor mod.
---
Was there a megasloth in the area? Their area attack has huge range and blurs your vision.
---
Yes...but...we all know those descriptions are made up by the GOVERNMENT to cover up the TRUTH.
---
That’s clucking amazing!
---
That's a vertibot (looks like a helicopter), not a cargobot (quadcopter carrying a crate).
---
The Mothman light house?
---
It still kills the ghouls.
---
I do it every day and I am lvl. 139
---
I know they don't want to flood the store, but I hope for future releases like this they consider releasing the whole set at once instead of letting it trickle in. Would rather be able to buy the one I like immediately as opposed to wondering if the next one will be cooler and having to wait 4 weeks to avoid buyers remorse.
---
I am a unfortunate soul who bought one through reddit, and got an almost insta ban for 30 days as soon as I closed the post after buying it. To some people it might be cool and awesome to have, but at this point it's been sitting in my stash box for the last week, and I don't see the point in having it anymore. Super sucks
---
I sell serums for 400 at my shop so people come by daily, buy them, then flip them to vendors for a small profit lol
---
Or contrarily, all perks, alot of Bolstering. That's what I run currently. Full Bolstering Sentinel, I've seen it go as high as ~640 DR when everything is proc'd. Can't wait to mod my backpack soon to add to that number lol.
---
Yeah where the wise mothman quest is, right up the top I think it's Anne that spawns there
---
Rebuilding my Camp last night to make room for Vendors and holy shit is the Build options so convoluted. All stair options suck. Trying to build anything other than a square box and run into issues getting walls and roofs to snap. Have a large staircase (the one with the metal supports) good luck getting anything next to it or above it to place correctly. And that staircase only works on Foundations!
---
Take my survey I just posted i might be wrong on how many players max out daily caps also cheaper to buy serums I sell mine for 200 caps
---
Tesla rifle for the campfire event and then switch to melee at the very end ftw. Tesla is pretty much my go-to for low-level enemies or for tagging large groups (before swapping to melee to actually kill them) now.
---
I do it almost every day, 117.
---
The 25k limit is -&gt;per player at any given moment&lt;- not a limit on how many caps you can make/spend. The daily baseline is required to set prices, otherwise how would you know how much to charge for anything? The cap limits and sinks exist soley to keep the number of caps coutable I'm sure. Otherwise even a computer might freak out...
---
I’m lvl 239 and I still do daily vendor and cap runs. The only time I don’t do them is when I hit about 15-18k since I usually make around 5-10k a day from player vending.
---
Be sure to put a vendor in it with nothing but sugar bombs and gum drops set to 0 caps.  A reward for the clever ones who survive the obvious death trap.
---
1) reasonable prices
---
2) acid
---
3) vanity clothing
---
4) full fusion cores
---
Reasonable prices. 
---
Honestly though i browse plans, cheap dog food, etc. Strangely i have been buying 1-2 cap ammo for convienence.
---
Hard pass on your 2k 1 star medic rifle, or, 1.5 k on 1 star cloaking right leg.
---
You are a fascinating creature
---
You might be able to get around it by moving other objects out of the way, then putting down the furniture you want and moving the other things back into place. Kind of annoying, but order of operations has always been a thing in Fallout building.
---
Only thing i do daily is challenges, but last week i was able to do only one challenge every day. Bethesda guy who made those is kinda highschool studen probably. Alcohol, photography, stupid challenges.
---
And when i have time i sell spare aid at vendor, mostly +-400caps, but i do get thousands on vending machines which i spend later on any plans i don't know yet.
---
Spinning the earth around faster or making it go around the sun faster doesn't actually speed up the relative time. We will still be awake and sleep the same amount of time regardless of how fast the day cycle becomes. Our day/night pattern will get really fk'd tho.
---
Cheap plans and recipes to complete my collection
---
Generously priced Mutations (400 caps or less is good for me)
---
Serum plans (got electrically charged for 1,500 caps!!!!!)
---
Ammo for main weapons I use (5.56 and Shells atm)
---
Rare items that I may just want to collect (selling pie 9,999 lol)
---
Event cosmetics and items (in case I was busy and missed the event)
---
Then you were the extremely lucky exception.
---
Thank you, I'm laughing so hard.
---
Oh yes, I'm just clarifying why one of those complaints was a really dumb one anyway.
---
As much as I agree I dont see it happening, correct me if I'm wrong but all carpet is attached to a floor when placed......this works because there is only one floor, but there are multiple styles of wall styles so they would need to do every combination of inside/outside wall to make it happen
---
Y'know, we have a computer that we can stick at our base now, with the personal terminal.   
---
The vendors are all obviously computerized.  
---
Might as well ad-hoc internet this thing and give us a search function on our terminal. "Is anyone selling..." \*drop down menu\* ... select the thing you're looking for and get a list of who's selling them. Stimpack, Leather Left Arm, Handmade, BoS plan, whatever.  
---
Just search, ping," Item Not Found" or "The following vendors are stocked with (item) ... (name1) (name2)" etc.
---
Any plan i don't have. Shielded raider underarmor for example.
---
The colonel Kelly monument is a Spawn aswell, its just bellow philippi battlefield cemetary
---
yea the bad thing is one of the few people who got one had to let someone dupe it ...if i had something that rare no way would i let someone copy it
---
 Do you have any idea how strong they can be?
---
Could project purity be delayed indefinitely? I would argue Vault 101 opening is a better "event"

They were female before becoming a Super Mutant. Physically and biologically they have no gender. The FEV seeks to “even the scales”. It doesn’t matter what was going on before, everyone looks like a rounded up ken doll after the FEV does it’s thing.
---
i agree! its my endgame!
---
i had to convince my friend to let me tear down her existing CAMP just so I could build her a new one to get my building fix hehe
---
I saw that too at Grafton Steel mill.
---
No, the credit is per account not per character so that character will have issues too. Until Bethesda gives us the fix we will be denied the ability to earn the same Atoms that the others do.
---
I too Pre-Ordered my copy.
---
Go up to your little camp module and itll say repair all structures
---
People still use TSE weapons?
---
I’ve been seeing 1 star legendary items for 5k+ nearly fell over laughing! 🤣
---
Update my post to include clarifying info.
---
I only came here to say how VERY much better and cooler all the pics of the SB and the M Queen were than the Deathclaw v Sheepsquatch pics I got. It was a cool thing to see, I think the sheepsquatch was going to take it but I didn't want to wait so I killed them both. Over near the hotel where Boomer is, under a tree next to the road with the hotel in the distance was where I found them.
---
I hear that.  Unfortunately that's a sales tactic to encourage the impulse buy.  But, if you keep up with the data mining community, they had all of the PAs in this set datamined weeks ago.  I honestly thought the Pale Rider was just a placeholder though since it looks nothing like the other 3.
---
Go to the camp station and press space or on X-box, PS4 what ever it shows you!
---
Those pictures are awesome!
---
We had no idea.

BTW, I took [this photo of my character](https://i.imgur.com/lS7W7dJ.png) the other day.

How did you almost get an insta ban? How do you know? Just curious how they informed you

O... kay?

Moving it allows you to fix it without using resources.

Damn that’s crazy! Idk if I’d trust someone for that much caps! I’ll eventually get it. Plus I’m trying to get more unyielding armor pieces to help

And what would you be referring to???

yea, it really doesn't make sense. im sure this is something like the so many other overlooked things. probably just hasn't got enough complaints to get noticed

Just eat it.

Yeah the problem will be that I never can replace it course it is on a cliff wall 😅
---
From what I can tell, everything in your stash is directly tied to your character (which seems like a silly thing to have to point out, but it's not).  This is what allows you to access your stash from anywhere on the map (assuming someone put down a stash container, either a player, or one of the static ones like at the Red Rockets).
---
This, conversely, probably means that your stash isn't accessible from your base when you're *not* around, hence the issue with the vending machine only showing limited data when you're not there.
---
Viewing your stash from the pipboy shouldn't be a tough technical issue (though the UI *really* isn't built for it).
---
You'll feel the effect of this if you walk up on someone who is *way* over weight capacity sometimes, it takes a long time to load that information into your local game (though it doesn't seem like it always has to do that).  If you go to their camp, it's not an issue if they're not there, but just the presence of someone like that can cause a pretty hefty lag spike (sometimes).
---
tl;dr: shouldn't be a stability issue, though you may hate what your pipboy turns into if it can be done.
---
*tips fedora*
---
 Regular Armour has many ways to make it good. My BoS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the limbs ignores explosive damage for instance. I have to be careful as I often forget my X0-1 does take explosive damage.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Every day. 102.
---
I did an excite!
---
Shoot’em in the face and collect
---
One person would have been too many. How are you on the other side of this point?
---
Sorry for the beginner question, but if I sell/drop a plan marked as "(known)" will I still have the ability to build that object myself?
---
Have been afraid to sell my (known) plans until this point because of that reason even though I assume I will still be able to build them, would be very grateful for some confirmation
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Indeed
---
I’ll never understand people complaining about other people complaining. Yet here I am....wait...
---
Same here
---
I saw that one too! lol
---
Best of luck! Get that max caps in 1 shot would be hilarious.

Yup, every day since like November! Lvl 279

 Captinoob right?
---
...what console?
---
Sloppy typing, sloppy explanation, incomplete picture painted for the reader.  0/10.
---
I say almost insta cause I got some automated looking message from the "moderators" that I got a 30 day ban for, in their words, "selling a duped item" even though my post very obviously stated that I wanted to BUY the mask. After messaging the mods all day, finally heard back from the main guy saying they were "looking into it" and that was a couple of days ago. They banned me, but the guy who sold it to me didn't get banned. Super fucked up, in my opinion
---
I sell for 250c They are my best seller.
---
I will return. All WOOO's get upvote
---
I never had max and the guns i want cost 12k plus lol
---
People were originally grabbing from the developer room were they not?
---
Or were all those accounts locked in the banwave
---
Playstation
---
Doesn’t mean they’re anywhere near as efficient
---
Level 176 , tbh it’s easy getting vendor caps , just make some serums and sell em , I use Unyielding so they sell for 500 a pop take a piece or two off and 3 gives me my daily 1400 , resources are easy to get
---
If it happens again try unequipping and re-equipping the gun. This game has a habit of not applying those kinds of effects for some reason.
---
im lvl 360 still do my daily cap runs
---
Question/comment:
---
Does anyone know if raw flux has a chance to stabilize on its own?  Or to be gathered in a stable state? 
---
I ask because I have terrible luck getting the masses and fluids so I only rarely am able to craft stable flux.  Yet I always seem to walk away from a gathering session with at least one or two stable flux that I know I didn't make. 
---
I often will allow my flux to decay into inert flux since its almost ideal as a hydration source and I typically walk away from a nuke zone with 200-300 raw flux that I can't process.  And when I hit up my aid tab for a drink there will be one or two stable flux.
---
Just doing the world challenges (many are bugged and un-completable), and the repeatable scout quests. Mostly the Campfire Tales. 
---
(I've only received 3 badges after about 15 or so playthroughs, but have seen people posting about grinding up to 17 badges. I  only need one more!)
---
For reasons I cannot fathom, one roof piece refuses, just \*refuses\* to be placed over the top of my stairway. It lines up. It turns green. There's \*nothing\* around like a tree branch or whatever, but will it click?  
---
"This object cannot be placed due to intersecting with anotehr object."  
---
Wha?! What object, where?! There's nothing there! ARG!  
---
Hopefully we get a CAMP clean-up in the near future.
---
I do remember reading that it was patched, although I don't remember which patch it was.
---
This is as old as gaming itself. It's just group-based non-consensual PvP. The Division had this same issue back in '16, for example, where if anyone on your team goes rogue, the whole group also goes rogue, and you don't have any say in it, even if you didn't fire a shot. The developers pulled their head out of their ass and fixed it. Tthe game tells you your teammate just went rogue, and asks you to stay (and go rogue) or leave group with a keypress. Fairly easy solution. "Don't accept invites" is a horrible thing in a multiplayer setting.
---
How do you get anything back to your camp?
---
&lt;3 3 hops and there he was just laying on the hood. Thanks friend!
---
Not too rare, I get them quite often. The 3 star may be much more rare, can't say I ever got a 3 star plus players sell them.
---
Hey! Stop making black holes!
---
no i don't think there was any dev room access on xbox just on pc
---
Bethesda has them posted here as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bopjp9/can\_we\_get\_a\_radio\_station\_that\_contains\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bopjp9/can_we_get_a_radio_station_that_contains_the/)
---
Message came a couple of minutes after I left the seller's world
---
Oh so banned on the market, not in game by Bethesda. Once again, who cares. Create a new account or read over the subs rules first. It ain’t a big deal to get banned on a subreddit
---
Finally I might get my junkie’s pipegun with +1 sobriety and bash damage 😍
---
oh god
---
I buy for 200-250 and flip at my store for 400. People in turn flip to vendors. I like your pricing :P
---
Thank you for this. I need to take a photo hahaha
---
The pip boy freezing glitch is back, but out of the pip boy this time.
---
It's happened to me 3 times. I'm at the point where I deleted the vending machine until they fix it, I can use that CAMP budget for other stuff til they do.
---
Rare outfits and plans for my camp that I don’t know yet :3 (mostly those Asylum Worker outfits!!)
---
You on PS4 I'll gladly do a trade
---
If that’s what the purveyor wants you to have
---
This is a level 40 1 star nocturnal. It’s going in for scrip scrap.
---
I’ve noticed that when my game was on my spinning disc HD I was crashing like once per hour it felt like. When I moved it to my SSD i haven’t crashed since.
---
Also if you’re running any mods (text chat, better inventories etc) it might lead to crashing as well
---
Don’t know about others experience, but I found the tourist in about 3 fast travels and no server hops. I just hit one overlook and two monument sites and was done.
---
I been been having a little more heartburn with the Tadpole challenges since I play solo. A lot of the challenges seem to involve either rare circumstances or teammates.
---
👉🏻😎👉🏻
---
Almost every time i hop on i have to change my mic settings in audio settings of game menu. Seems to default my audio to mute.
---
Did you actually find this in game
---
I did say in my post this was a month ago. From what others are saying, it was a bug that has since been fixed. I just wasn’t sure since I’m fairly new to the game what was “allowed” lmao.
---
Highest cap count at 1 time I've had is 16K. I spend too fast to accrue max because I want to know every plan in the game, and I bought all the mutations from the Vendor for 3500 caps. couldn't bring myself to buy from players and inadvertently support the dupers.
---
I tried that. Lost my lovely pics and still didn’t work
---
I hope she doesn’t want everyone to have it
---
I hope we get the mat and the spoiler
---
Without knowing your level it's hard to say. There are places where mobs can't spawn above certain levels.
---
I always run any direction before anything loads to get out from under the base
---
Well then obviously no one saves their notes except me because I’m a weirdo and like having that junk for some reason :(
---
 You watched the bit in the Golf Club right? I did that a couple of days ago and took almost no damage at all. 
---
My Nocturnal 40% Speed 3* knife starts at about 250 and ramps to 300 real quick with Adrenaline in play. I just touch em' and they dead. The massive speed makes ghouls attacking in groups just fun.
---
 110 scrip at the Station from that event. ;)
---
Ah good point, I always assume no one else ever uses anything but PC ;-)
---
Unfortunately I don't know anything about consoles, except that a lot of the file information stored locally is often encrypted, and that they (at least Microsoft) seems hell-bent on keeping people from making local changes at will.  Not sure you're going to have much luck going that route.
---
IMO, since you have a *legitimate physical disability*, you may be able to appeal to Bethesda's benevolent side and ask for a reasonable accommodation to help you with that problem.  And I chose those words very carefully for a reason (hint!)
---
Oh this is priceless.  Thank you for being a creeper and providing us with this entertainment.
---
I got 1 to drop at around 300hours but that's the only one I've seen and none of my 3 buddies I play with regularly have gotten one to drop. I gave it away free to one of them.
---
Haha so true. I can’t tell you how many camp decorations I’ve gotten for fairly cheap
---
156 and I try to do it most days. I usually hit 1K+ if not max.
---
Demand a bigger backpack immediately 👌
---
What cpu exactly?
---
I know that, I'm saying that it'll probably enter the general legendary drop tables on the 21st, if they update the general legendary drop tables.
---
OMG, those Supply Req's DO have a purpose after all.
---
Even when the high level peeps are tossing them away..
---
Currently level 25
---
Ahh, a scorched mongrel.  Ok, I got everything else.
---
Cool psn is dutty2104
---
Lvl 157? Gotta get back to it, somehow. Used to just farm up a bunch of drugs and a few bulk things, but now I gotta at least double that. Gettin tough but I’ll find a way.
---
Nice!im @ 1000 also,cant wait :)
---
I saw the tourist at the top of the lighthouse.
---
Oops. Didn't catch that part. Ya a month ago it was bugged.
---
Moving my camp recently reset the skin though. Just look out when moving it now.
---
Just found Ansel at whitespring thanks friend!
---
You clearly broke a rule of that sub and deserved the temp ban
---
But it takes like 2 minutes to make a new account so it's really not gonna hurt you at all
---
--close
---
At least you didn’t post this in r/gaming - dodged a bullet!  ;)
---
I don't see those masks on pc. Guess consoles can get away with it since they can just make a new account to dupe that will get ban.
---
hmm if that didn't fix it then i have no clue ..have you also tried completly shutting down the xbox (not sleep mode)
---
We have this problem as well on Xbox One. My wife and i play together and it goes back and forth on who's not heard through the headset mic. One person can hear the other, it shows's voice on the indicator, but can't respond through the mic on the headset. The only thing that helps is that we are sitting right next to each other.
---
Wow! I may be doing it wrong but what do you put in your vending machines and where do you consistently get things to put in there that people want. Currently  I put my camp right by the vault (easy spawn point) and I fill it with things like gears and screws and building plans and ammo. I also have one machine dedicated to stims, food water and meds. Be my Yoda!
---
Never thought of that idea, but I really like it. Make a nice log cabin camp, it’s very fitting
---
I did the tadpole badges easy, but has been completely stuck in the Possum ranks (due to bugged quests.) I'm now about to buy my Possum backpack mod using nameless badges I acquired from the Campfire tales event. It doesn't drop every time, but it does indeed drop (watch for the badge symbol next to the caps gained when it shows you your quest rewards.) Grind it for a while and get badges.
---
I guess I’m never moving my camp every again. Good thing I like the spot.
---
Does it filter the air?
---
i7 6700k

Oh no, you stop right there, you thought that Bethesda would do stuff exactly how people want it? No no no my good sir, it’ll most certainly be a purveyor exclusive.
---
You said tons. How do you not see exaggerating numbers to generate clicks especially when it generates more hate is wrong? Yes 1 is bad. That wasn't what you were stating. You continuing to push this debunked TONS is garbage. If 1 is bad enough then state the true numbers or just admit that you're basing it off of what is bad reporting and you didn not know the number was retracted.
---
I guess i should start a new character
---
gotta love a bit of gambling
---
Not everyone runs those crazy builds ffs......
---
It makes even low level mobs almost impossible. It's a bug that needs to be fixed. Try going toe to toe with a mirelurk queen and tell me melee needs a Nerf.😂

I have a lvl 50 Vampire’s with the 90 percent weight reduction on it. I’ve kept that for a long time, and I recently came across a Berserker’s Grognak Axe that I put up for sale at my camp, but haven’t played in a few days to see if I can sell it.
---
Mr Handy buzzsaw is so much fun in the tales event
---
Refrigerate it for later.
---
I have thought of this too! It would be great!
---
Adding a voice saying its bugged for me as well
---
*sloshes bedpan*
---
I had a mirelurk queen, a sheepsquatch and three scorchbeasts all go at it once.  Sheepy was winning but since I didn't have all day, I called the match and killed all of them.
---
Might have been selling an old weapon because the pole replaced it
---
Soooo if me buying a presumed duped item is allegedly "breaking a rule", but selling duped items is definitely breaking a rule, theeeeeen why didn't the guy who sold it to me get banned?
---
It's funny you should say that. The guy was using a mic and my first thought when I heard this guys voice (even before the BS) was this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE6iAjEv9dQ
---
Does it filter the air? Doubt it just checking
---
nice! i will add you right now
---
I have one I’m selling in my vending if you’re on ps4
---
I get this all the time, was going to post about this today but never did. Will save your post :)
---
Isn't this due to some weird Japanese regulation regarding cryptocurrencies? I doubt it's just that Bethesda doesn't want to sell atoms to Japanese folks.
---
.85\^5 = .4437  ^^Hi, ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot ^^that ^^makes ^^math ^^calculations ^^more ^^complicated.
---
I have the wood floors from the atom shop. Every piece of wood floor in my camp goes in one direction except one piece. No matter what I do I can’t get it to turn and place in even if it green.
---
Lvl 311 , its easy to get the 1400. Harpers ferry /west tek a few times , sell all weapons collected . Or make serums if u can
---
If im over 23k i dont bother
---
I'm on right now, for about the next hour, if you still need this. Game name same as here.
---
i sell my extras in my vending machine they are one of my best sellers
---
Why not?!?!!?
---
I saw one last night, at a player vendor, for 500 caps. Five. Hundred. Caps. On Xbox.
---
Old man winter masks
---
Explosive lasers
---
My Mr.Fuzzy costume counts as costume right?
---
So it may be your location. Most high level types are going to already know the bulk of common plans and recipes.  I'd suggest that you have your vending in the forest near Flatwoods
---
Spread the word!
---
Same here.
---
Fuck yeah 👍👍 a log cabin in the dark mire
---
I think so, lets try it
---
Cool.  I didn't know they had released the details that it was not a new category, even though it is ATOM shop.
---
Surprised there isn't more outrage like there was for the repair kits...  would make sense for it to be in the VT class because then they could argue it isn'y pay to won because everyone gets a VT class underarmor at the beginning.
---
I have bought a BE dragon for 800 caps lol
---
Yup! Posted on the sub! Thanks again!!
---
If you have a costume can I make a picture of you too?
---
Make sure to do the 2 dailies every day they can sometimes give possum badges
---
The Free States developed the technology to fight the scorched and the BoS fought against them and gave their lives while the Responders just played doctor.
---
PS4? If so, what is your player tag?
---
haha that's awesome
---
Why are people asking for this so much? Genuinely don’t understand why people don’t want to play the game and earn these things lol.
---
You never know.
---
76 is my first online playing experience and I've been subject to some of this. I didn't even know what "griefing" meant...
---
I am currently playing with my level 30 character  in pacifist mode (adventure only) due to a prior bad encounter. Anyway, I was out scavenging near my base but far enough that it was out of sight, when  some creep walked up to me, gave a wave and a thumbs up, then out of nowhere slashed me and killed me with one hit with one of those claw things (sorry still new). I realized they were level 137 or so. In less than a few seconds, they became wanted and the wanted disappeared...I watched this as I was lying there in that 'call for help-give up-ignore' state. How does this happen? I'm on PS4. Of course they took my loot. When I respawned I went back to my camp and here they come walking up the road. I then just left the game but I have to admit it ruined my next few hours...I'd especially been having a lot more fun over the last few weeks with the new stuff and vending, etc., with no bad encounters at all.
---
What made me angry is that I'm level 30 and there was no reason for this, but also, how do they become wanted then unwanted without being killed?
---
Yeah... I bought the BOS plans from someone for 4k each before I realized they had them at Grafton. Had been hunting them for soooo long. Never even occurred to me to check. On the other hand, I think its possible the seller ALSO didn't know, as after a certain point, I stopped shopping in Grafton... ;) I made the caps back pretty quick with vending though. Buyer beware... ;)
---
Do they drop mad loot? Imagine after doing the queen you get some wood armo trash legwndary, but after the chicken you get like some tse...
---
Idk why, but it won't let me. Like I've tried and it flashes up for a second and then disappears.
---
Does it filter tge air like gas masks?
---
Get to Whitesprings and lurk behind the higher level people is one sure fire way to level quick. Not as good as it used to be but it will work.
---
We should be told before paying to move the CAMP if our previous buildings will fit.  Failing that we should have the ability to move it for free a small distance for a short period of time afterwards.
---
We have an ongoing joke in our faction with plastic lawn flamingos.  No one knows who’s placing them but they appear in everyone’s camp. It’s kind of entertaining.
---
Posted this in another thread about spawning a few days ago. Has been working great so far.  
---
"But you can control where you spawn to an extent. Did some testing the other day at my camp. Pretty much all I did was move the C.A.M.P machine thing around and looked where I spawned each time. Basically just fast traveled to vault 76 and back. How you move the camp machine is very small movements. I tried larger moves in order to narrow down where I wanted and I ended up further away than where I was at. After that I just did very small changes and have it down to spawning within a 5ft area. After that I watched where other players spawned when they came to my camp and it was pretty spot on to where I was spawning after doing the fast travel stuff. This took only a couple minutes to do and I now don't even have to worry about spawning some where dumb when I travel to my own camp."
---
However that's not necessarily true. Remember we haven't had this for very long and lots of players price things quite reasonably. 
---
The handful of players who are buying up low price items and selling them at inflated prices is not 'the economy' it's a select number of players over pricing things. It's entirely possible no one will buy those items and the prices will come back down or they will continue to be those outliers and others will price things more reasonably thus no inflation.
---
The in game economy isn't going to follow the rules of mass market real world economies. Why worry about it, if you're afraid your caps won't buy you as much stuff...then what is it you are trying to buy? Or you just like the idea of being in-game rich?
---
Don't look to ruin things for other players, let them do what they want and if you want to change you're style of play then by all means do so.
---
Oh no...a downvote...you sure showed me. Lol
---
Breaking a rule and whining about the consequences is pretty lame dude. The other guy deserved a ban too but that's not really the point
---
Do you want a pet cow...or do you want fertilizer. Because the pet cows neat but fertilizer is so easy to get in game its nuts.
---
PC and no, thanks, doesn’t work for my build
---
Well it doesnt count for me :(
---
Legit want a furious, swing speed, strength spear for the lolz
---
Is this quest bugged it did not work for me aswell
---
Yes, 6 rocket turrets are weak. The enemies agro range is further than turret agro range jackass.
---
i'm pretty hyped I can never get any damn ranged weapons at all, let alone anything with 3 stars
---
Level 223. Every day. Kill Mole Miners, walk to vendor, change servers, repeat.
---
It’s simple, just make it either-or, you either get the -8 while moving, or -15 while standing, no hopping allowed. F the 75% chance, what a joke. 
---
But they won’t. This dumbest idea, standing still to be unkillable, is like their crown jewel of this game and they simply don’t want to nerf it.
---
I have been experiencing this same bug every play session.
---
Lvl 115 and I run it  EVERY time I log on. My camp is at Pleasant Valley Station so I hit the raider camp to the west and the ski resort to the north, clear everything out and 1400 caps easy peasy in about 20 min. Most of the time its mole miners and super mutants so you cap out really fast but if its scorched and Mr Handy bots it takes some more effort.
---
###
---
Tbh i have stocked up multiple characters with ammo , food , water &amp; aid for many months. Junk i usually buy from vending machines .
---
Plans &amp; outfits
---
Uh, no, it kind of IS the point. Dude who sold it me definitely broke a rule, yet I was the one who got fucked over for it. They're not banning anyone else for BUYING duped items, so whatever point you're trying to make isn't getting anywhere
---
Idk about everyone else but I got classes through out the day, the essays they assign and I got to go work can’t really grind out all the challenges my guy
---
That can be done with a regular floor where you initially placed the camp itself. Implementing this system would change nothing.
---
Yeah, Warhammer 40k Greenskins, nice catch
---
maybe we have to try an other apparel and mask
---
I'm all for this idea! There are a few decent cabins around as well; Two Northeast of Bolton greens (I recommend the smaller one there, the middle one is larger, but you've got super mutants nearby to pester you)
---
I'll also suggest my last camp spot; while not a log cabin, there's a cozy lil prebuilt hunters shack Southwest of "The Vantage". It spawns two random critters/radstags on the road in front of it and has a few containers/wood piles/etc
---
The fancy gold one?
---
Yeah. I'm pretty sure that came and went months ago.
---
It's actually been brought up to one of the Bethesda peeps. They passed it on, so hopefully it will be available eventually. Meanwhile, the Raider cabins west of Top of the World work pretty nicely. Give or take those supermutant neighbors.
---
Same but because I always seem to get a drill or like a level 30 on a high level tough enemy.
---
Sad thing is even if they had footage, they would just tell the devs about the bug to prevent it in the future, but won't do anything to fix it for the submitter.
---
Ok maybe I find something in my stash
---
ive done a couple of the cabins, but its difficult when i cant control the interiors as much as id like :(
---
/u/jessbethesda how is it that this issue made it out of quality control/assurance to begin with? this seems to continue to be a major issue with Bethesda, and yet there is never any PR covering why Bethesda seems awful to the punch on not pre-checking any bugs on anything, server stability, anything what-so-ever.
---
awesome! glad it was brought up.
---
Don't know about selecting between two that doesn't sound doable. Don't think Fallout can handle saving 2 camps per player.  If we had a second temporary smaller sized camp that doesn't get auto blueprinted when logging off that would be ideal.
---
Yes!!! Thanks for bringing this up! Hope they see this.
---
Inventory should have a different category between armor and apparel. AID should have a different category between chems and food/water.
---
This was the only one I purchased.  It's a great skin, and it's much more subtle than the others.  I pulled my Nukacola off my X-01 for it. Way to go, Bethesda.
---
Sure just for you!
---
Don't sell items for such prices then and stay in the items limit. People would think if they cant have more than 25k caps it would be god damn obvious not pricing items that high and risk loss for absolutely no reason at all. Righ now i'm selling everything for 4-200 caps xD and people are actually buying that stuff. If Beth had the intention of raising the 25k cap it would have been happened already.
---
Found the communist
---
I’m just bummed that modding the backpack doesn’t change its appearance. I thought we were going to get to totally customize our packs, but seems like it’s just going to be Atom shop skins.
---
Almost same lol I have 480 above 30%. 15 str, radicool, 3 unyielding pieces an all armor has deep pocketed.
---
Yes. I assumed the drill would be useless. I was very wrong.
---
You made a post trying to buy an obiviously duped item. You are to blame for your actions.
---
Contact your doctor.
---
I told my wife that yesterday after she was complaining about not having enough resources to repair two of her walls and a turret because of a plant and she said: "that's so stupid...". I looked over at her tv to see her scrap her broken mutfruit plant and re-plant it. Couldn't help but laugh.
---
Maybe the halloween costume I try to get it
---
Yeah it is a real shame
---
Damn didnt think about that. I'm selling a ton of BOS outfits and no armor, much less legendaries. Could see someone being disappointed.
---
You could try Grafton Steel or WV Lumber CO.
---
Looking to buy items, duped or not, isn't against the rules. Selling them, however, is. The dude who sold it should have gotten banned, not me. Moving on.
---
I do barn on the outside and wood on the inside - it's a good compromise.  My workshop out back is warehouse.  You're right though - we desperately need more wall sets.  I don't think I'll ever pay 18$ for power armor paint - but 18$ for a full log cabin set or a more complete roof set to cover more angles?  Yeah I would pay for that.
---
I had 10 of them by time i was lvl 75.... they don't seem rare to me. At least not your typical 1 star or crappy roll. 3star are as rare as everything else.
---
If I unplug and replug my mic, it usually solves the issue.
---
Nah not them... Way bigger... Faster more yellow and orange less bloodied...
---
I though about doing that, picking up every plan/receipe i could to pad my numbers but decided against it. All the high Plan Camps ive visited have been crap usually.
---
So you want the game to do an extra step and think it'll  go any faster or save any time? Then you would chance being in a infinite loop of unsuitable worlds.
---
Just me then :)
---
Building in Workshops is so hard now, none of my blueprints that worked before the patch work anymore, and I can't seem to make new working ones.
---
Just doing electrical connections take so much time now, more then 1/2 of my time in a workshop is trying to get power from a generator to the resource miner sitting right next to it.
---
/u/Ladydevann I haven't seen this on any of the "we are aware lists" so I'm just pinging you the thread.
---
this!! i know i’ll catch flak for admitting i would be willing to buy wall plans but yes! not all of us are seeking major balance improvements some of us just want QOL or Aesthetic improvements!!
---
I lost probably 3k+ caps cause of this, and its easy to leave the server if you get max caps and someone on a buying spree, the problem is what if you are doing scorchbeast queen, imposter sheepsquatch, camden park daily or other daily you deem important, then you really can't leave until they are done........... I honestly wish they let us bank caps to our camps and then we have the option to pick up the caps, so if we are max and we pick up the caps without paying attention then it be our fault.
---
Or have a Showcase. A few items telling people why they should visit your shop when they mouse over it.
---
My god I can relate. I’m trying to build a house but it’s nearly impossible because the last square of roofing will not place! Like it’s connected to all the tiles and it’s green so “object is floating” my ass
---
You want to make sure you are not dieing due to water radiation. If you are downed in water while taking radiation you cannot be revived.
---
Those are the same ones I chose. They were pretty easy
---
I've seen creatures turn scorched.. basically, find  some stingwings, find a scorchbeast and lead it to the stingwing, let the scorchbeast scream hit the stingwing, and there you have it! It works on most creatures, and I've done it many times
---
Theire Game Copy
---
Yeah i was collecting them at first, before i knew how legendary vendor would work. Was hoping i could somehow merge them all into the god roll i wanted. But once news was released on how it would work, tossed them all.
---
Well you need to read the rules of that sub again because you clearly broke one and deserve the ban. Whatever other people do has absoulty nothing to do with it
---
Why is this already removed? What was against the rules? Voicing his opinion?! We can't have a say to @bethesda here as well?
---
thank you too :D
---
I'm just wondering why with higher damage reduction I always seem to take more damage than I do in power armour.
---
Could it be that the armour only applies to the part that it covers but power armour applies it's full protection to all areas?
---
For example, my regular armour provides say 30 armour to the arms, so that's how much DR I receive when I'm hit there. But, in my power armour it's applying the full DR of the armour set to all locations.
---
Could that be it? It would explain why I seem to get much higher protection from the PA when it has a lower DR rating.
---
Just pondering.
---
Lol, I did, it talks about SELLING, not BUYING. Learn how to read. Thanks for wasting my time.
---
Ye it was early, angry/sleepy posting makes for I'll thought out posts :P
---
Like the flip sign(s) at Watoga Train Station
---
Hey pal, still need those challenges, not sure when exactly is 8:30 est but according to google would be around 2:30 am here on Spain :P
---
I doubt i'll be around but thanks anyway.
---
Sheep! Why sheep?
---
AND clearly these are guides for junk legendaries...useful ones with a good mix that you would actually use id expect to go for more.
---
yikes sounds tricky for a first timer, will do my research, thanks for that :)
---
I'd like know how the owners of these camps travel there and don't get stuck themselves. Unless owner and guests of camps spawn in different spots.
---
I would also like this.
---
How would they drop two if they cant have more then one
---
How can you track like 5 quests at once... My OCD wouldn't let me...
---
Upvote because LOG CABIN.
---
Awhile ago I was reading a post discussing this and data miners, so I don't fully remember so take this with a grain of salt. Supposedly all pieces of PA have a hidden 7 percent damage reduction, which is why they are seemingly tankier.
---
Yup, right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b6q38p/tamed_a_cat_you_can_tame_cats_proof_in_the_post/).
---
Do you have a headphone socket or USB on your mic?
---
I just bought all the mutations i want from players. Pretty costly lol
---
Piggybacking off your post... We have single floor pieces. The 1x1s. Can we please get single piece walls (1x1) and 1x2 walls (stand up). We have 1x2 walls that are horizontal. I see no reason not to have the other pieces I mentioned
---
Idk about everyone else but I got classes through out the day, the essays they assign &amp; I got to go to work. I can’t grind through all the challenges so easily my guy
---
USB mic. I plug it into my keyboard.
---
Couldn't agree more. Upvotedd
---
So much for moving on...
---
What a joke you are. Calling yourself a "poor soul" for having to deal with the consequences of your own actions
---
Well, unless you would retroactively ban anyone who happens to possess two of the same item (which would have a lot of collateral damage)....
---
Oddly enough, I got two at the Overseer's Camp when I started. Both were 35+ though so I've never used them.
---
The 2 CAMPS would never be in-game at the same time. It's like having different characters as it is now (I think you're allowed 4 or 5).
---
It could be a memory issue. I was having the same thing happen (where the game stops for a few seconds at a time) running 1T command rate with aggressive timing. I took it down to 2T and changed some of the precharge numbers. It turned out to be one of the sticks went south, probably electromigration on a bad wafer. Ran memtest86 until it was good. I really need to replace that stick.
---
If you're on xmp profile, try taking it off and manually downclock it with memtest checking the results.
---
No worries.
---
Normally once you tame an animal I would just log out and log back in. The animal darts to your camp once you tame it. If you log out it appears upon the next load. But, recently I had to wait about an hour for the mongrel dog to be at my camp.
---
Of course! As always, one Vault Dwellers Junk is another Dwellers Treasure! 💰
---
Would be a cool skin!
---
Just the 1 will do, and a Bos jumpsuit
---
Not a tattoo person myself, but that's quite good. 
---
I'm far more impressed that you managed to do that yourself, TO yourself.
---
Lol. Preach. I'm not broke, and I don't buy a lot of games - I'm willing to spend money to make games I do buy more fun for me.  If I would spend 15$ on a toy I'd use for 100 hours in the real world, why would i should I get hung up about spending 15$ on a toy i'll use for 500 hours in the digital world?
---
Im not sure tbh but even spraying doesnt always work i run a semi auto rifle build and these guys are bouncing around and never stop moving
---
As far as I'm concerned you're lucky then. I've visited most places 4 or 5 times now whenever I was in the neighborhood and I've tried server hopping several places for about half an hour per place, but still no luck.
---
Still, I'm having a lot of fun with the other challenges. For the backpacking challenge I saw that some of the places I had to visit were fairly close so I visited them on foot. I saw some places I never would've seen with fast travelling everywhere.
---
Never done meth and never will... that shit is scary, cousin was in jail for 5 years after beating up a delivery guy and stealing his car towards the end of a 3 day meth bender. Just thought it made you like... ultra hyper.
---
It won't stabilize on its own. If you did the SBQ event or were in the area when it completed, you automatically are given a few stable flux.
---
Bethesda: Let's make a building system that requires flat ground.
---
Also Bethesda: Let's set the next game in the fucking Appalachian mountains.
---
Even getting 0% on alot of land based enemies too, not as big a problem as they are easier targets for manual aim.
---
Lol I know a few that would love that on pc
---
huh, so you gotta give up your +3 str to wear it from shielded enclave?
---
Not too worried about people showing up randomly without the machines turned on. Its not in an area where players would really pass through. Near a wooded cliff area. And ground level; not built off the cliff making people fall do their deaths in the off chance they miss-spawn. They'd only see it as something off in the distance if theyd come through.
---
Get more badges and buy mods for it.
---
Haha I guess. I’m actually a very friendly player in game, just so tired of these fake outrage posts. But it’s all good, everyone’s entitled to their opinions I guess
---
That would make much more sense. Thanks, I'll have to look for that.
---
Who said anything about banning? Must not of read the post.
---
They should just let us paint letters on our walls like you see all over the wastelands. 
---
They have been using the same font since fallout 3 lol, shouldn't be too hard to implement.
---
yea... 35k for my 10 and then i got my last 2 from a player for 300 each. But on the plus side I got the Electrically charged serum recipe for only 1,500 caps!
---
Broke my heart a little. Love the reload, love the limb damage...but I wear armor and PA regularly 😂
---
No ToT
---
@r/Ladydevann, can I get some sort of confirmation on this and will it ever make a return?
---
I think if you limit it on weapons and armor it maybe could work
---
I didnt buy the plans lol
---
Additional to use - do the Mama Dolce Event for canned meat stew +5%xp/hour or Farm Aaronholt for cranberrys, cranberry pie also grants you +5% add - even better - if you find the receipt at a player vendor maybe grants +10%
---
Swimming is super easy, as long as you've found a camera and beg 2 minutes of someone's time for the revive.
---
Hmm mines always on auto when I check, iv cycled throught the options and screamed down the mic for someone to thumbs up if they can hear me but to no avail.
---
It's weird because it worked when I first started playing a week or two ago
---
It's a slow day at work and I read a couple of posts on player vending and losing caps if you go over 25k then I started chasing this rabbit hole that's why I worry about it.
---
well, if you run around naked it will be quite shocking.
---
Does it show the extra parts when you just go over it in the list?
---
that is a "messed up" legendary, I feel like its a leftover from before they decided how to do multiple star legendaries, I wonder if in the cleaning of their data up for the legendary vendor they broke it?
---
I'll check mine when I can.
---
.....Oh man. I feel bad for people coming to my shop. Here is hoping they jump in time to not be stuck inside of a lake. D:
---
This. This is the best response
---
Yea I know my main is PA hvy weapons/shotguns. My alts a zerker. Just don't play it much
---
10/10 for you sir. Would read again.
---
My wife is your wife...
---
Yep, I hope is a one-time thing only.
---
Jump around to do "defend" events.  The workshop owner will appreciate the help, and you get a decent XP bonus and some plans on top of whatever you kill.
---
I've already shown you a couple scenarios that demonstrate why this is a terrible idea. Can you justify banning anyone who has ever gotten the same thing to drop twice? Anyone who has bought two copies of something from the market? I guess you wouldn't have much to worry about with all the empty servers.
---
&gt;when your mutant mom gets her hand stuck in the garbage disposal
---
All the time. Annoying as hell

you can't wear glasses or bandanas. it also deletes beards, and clips a little with the hats that I have tried. (black cowboy, crumpled trilby)
---
If we could plant silt bean, be nice.
---
Also, after re-reading some lore, FEV typically isn’t lethal. It’s lethal to the player character because plot, but generally the less radiation you’ve been exposed to, the less your IQ lowers. Other than that, people will become Super Mutants if exposed to the FEV. If people and animals are dunked together, they may become one of the many other monstrosities out there, like the Grafton Monster or Centaurs.
---
Ok we need MORE stalk and revive quests now!
---
Why do people send random invites anyways?  to use you as a fast travel point?
---
Yeah meth is no good, and it blows my mind that adderall isnt as taboo. I have plenty of friends who would never think of doing meth but take adderall when they are studying for college. Like there are sooo many college kids that use adderall all the time for their studies.
---
I normally use chairs, but unfortunately they get stuck under a different peice of floor each time..... So I can't really preempt it!
---
I hate the first idea. VATS crits are OP cheese right now, IMO. 
---
Disabling the sneak while jumping makes good sense though. Go ahead and apply that to Sentinel as well.
---
Just pay someone to do all your college work for you. Then you have more time to grind out challenges. Or you could do what any sane person does and do them little by little over time.
---
I'm guessing this is the mind set people have when they justify buying game currency, buying items, or generally supporting other RMT actions.
---
Yep.  And the creatures don't have to be alive for the pictures to count.
---
) every day on 4 characters

To be precise... I sell from one character whatever I scrounge that day.  The other 3 is crafting marine helmet, top hat and civil war garment
---
That might be a good lead, I'll check it out, thanks.
---
I legit just left a sign on the wall by my vending machine saying "msg me for scout revive challenges."
---
I'll leave it up for a while so us socially anxious/solo folks can help each other out...... Still no biters though
---
If you have the dodgy perk then definitely go with swing speed. Both dodgy and power attack use AP so you’re going to deplete often. Also, there seems to be a problem where many players are not connecting hits, so swing speed will allow for a quicker follow up.
---
Is sleeping at work morally or ethically wrong? If I didn't nap at work(when possible) then my wife find me dead with the controller still clutched in my quickly cooling hands.... (It's good to be the boss).
---
"Why Sheepie, why..."
---
Probably figured this out by now, but apparently bashing with the crossbow reduces durability much faster than firing with it. Which makes sense once you think about it, but isn't the most obvious thing from the get-go.
---
Oh PC this kinda works, at lest you don’t jump but it still has a low chance of actually making the connection, I’ve found I need to spam the action button until it connects and then the next press will pick up the object at that point and you can then cancel and it’ll go back,  try it a bunch one way and if it doesn’t go, try the same thing the other way
---
I either murder super mutants to sell their assault rifles, or murder players to bulk and sell their junk. I started making some serums out of their drops to free up some weight. I may have to try selling them to game vendors instead of player vendors.
---
Maybe some kind of blocker that you cant pick a secound up
---
It all depends on how you play.  Me - SS any day.  You're limited in how many PAs you can make, but it might lead to more 1 hit kills so that's not a bad choice either - me I just like swing speed cause its the most useful for boss fights.
---
I personally like a camp that is on the other corner if the map from vault 76 so my travel expenses are never too much no matter where i am cause i can travel to 76 first if its closer to it instead.
---
It had not occurred to me to stalk someone for this quest, I like it.
---
Like i said before, dupers ruined everything. For what really. Feel like a man for a few days or feel richer because of the easy caps and ebay bucks? It’s just stupid and extremely shortsighted. Without dupers there’s no need to nerf anything, because the game’s difficulty and legendary rare drop rate are balanced. With rampant duping they have to nerf everything repeatedly. All the time and efforts put into constant balancing the game is caused by duping. I hope Bethesda takes top offenders to court and let them pay. And delete all duped items. No more ‘balancing’ needed.
---
I wish we had a more variety of stuff so all our camps look different. I do feel like we are limited in the core materials. There are two stock floors for instance. One roof theme. Limited stair options that are actually usable. 
---
I'd like to see Cabin walls, The wooden siding that vinyl replicates with shutters on the windows, Glass walls would be sick maybe like California Flat style walls and stuff, maybe a few basic carpets, some wooden stairs, spiral staircases, Fireplaces in the wall, just some diff stuff. It feels very rudimentary right now.
---
Single action ivory grip mod for $9,999
---
I did Archer, Athlete, and Mammalologist (mostly just taking pictures of creatures).
---
its not really food if there is no risk of blowing your legs off if you are not careful
---
Legendaries for non-bloodied builds.  Everyone is selling bloodied build weapons and armor - which I get it, that's the meta - but sell some of your other stuff too.  I want executioners and instigating rifles - i want furious combat knives!  Give me some variety people.
---
[I agree](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8fnq/small_suggestion_for_map_preview_of_player_stores/) :|
---
Do you notice it also says 40 caps to move but costs more when you actually do?
---
If your character is making all these buildings/furniture from scratch it doesn't make sense for them to be building them broken, the smashed windows for example, you can get plenty of glass material.
---
no.
---
Directly from community rules...
---
"Exploits include the sale/solicitation of hacked or duped items."
---
You posting to buy the OMW mask is solicitation
---
Thanks for playing
---
Ok then I will take SS thank you :)
---
Nope
---
How does one tame death claw? No, It tames you.
---
Yep, Breach and Clear is an easy and quick way to get a bunch of steel and lead, and you get a small amount of most of the other ores. It's fast enough that I usually do it whenever I see it up.
---
Oh, glad I didn't buy it then. Why can't they just add option to craft it as either type?
---
Heard too many stories like this to ever friend randos. Doesn't seem worth it to me — alas!
---
i read his post as if he were wearing a tophat and a monocle
---
hi, im the broke ass low level wanting to fast travel
---
At the top right corne of the map, there can they spawn.
---

---
This is the Fallout 76 map with all the random spawn locations marked. I saved it a while back from another Redditer. I have had crap luck but maybe you will get lucky with it!
---
THIS 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
No problem, still have all four, just shout when online and I'll jump on if about, and no charge.
---
Sorry should have been more clear. Not chat option. At work and cant remembe for certain, but its called something like player volume or chat volume.
---
Took bud and i awhile to figure it out until we created a psn chat party and could communicate perfectly that it became apparent the problem was the games settings
---
Or paints for your outside walls. I mean... there's paint already in the game!
---
I believe after the last patch it was in the dev note  they can no longer be tame as well as megasloth.
---
Can always try anyways. The toxic valley always has a random one roaming if you go exploring
---
Rare plans at reasonable prices, mostly.  I hate going to a shop and it's all just common plans for the "recommended" prices.
---
well what did you expect?
---
Make sure to collect 50 raw cloth to soak up your tears before going on a Nukashine bender when the RNG turns out to be as good there as everywhere else.
---
Whenever this happens, I usually just store the things around it, place it, and then put everything back.
---
I have the same power attack gauntlet and it can 1 hit most enemies, and that's good enough for me. I do however also have a bloodied SS powerfist that destroys too and weighs less.
---
I got a week ago an 3* Handmade from a ghoul in cranberry bog. I didn't watch fast enough to check the effects only thing I saw was 90% Reduced weight. I checked my inventory and saw the Explosiv perifix and an B in front of all. B for Berserker...
---
I'm not sure but I think there was an tear in my eyes haha
---
That’s not been my experience. I’ve leveled up 3 characters to 50+, the last one within the last month and a half. That new one has been getting Atom rewards for things like location discoveries. Now, I’m on PC so I’m not talking about “achievements”, but the atom-reward challenges.
---
Nah people who do that want to enjoy playing a game and it not feel like a full time job going on RNG hunts/grinds and attempting glitched challenges. We like to relax with a game and attempt a challenge that can actually be completed not spend 3 hours looking for a mothman and still not get the 1 piece we need.
---
Sweet!
---
If you have multiple connected floor squares, you can attach a wall on each square, even if there is a wall in the area.
---
For example, I use the brick wall set and my house has rooms in it. When I place the internal brick walls, I place a wall on one square and then I place a wall on the adjacent square, but with the brick side facing the brick side of the previous wall. This way I end up with a nice white wall on both sides of an internal wall. Hanging things up on either side of a wall looks nice now and there are not bricks clipping through a poster or a picture.
---
The only downside to this method is that placing doors can be tricky if you want them to swing in a particular direction.
---
The above could probably work to some level with the barn set.
---
Looking for that “Milk” of human “Kindness”
---
Same.  I'm also hoping it'll eventually drop the Plasma Grenade plan.
---
Noooooo haha
---
The most fun I've had in survival mode was building a camp with a long stairway up into the satellite dish beside West-Tek, full of traps and most notably, after a bunch of punji boards at the very top, a springboard trap. Most people on survival do not wear power armor. Many PvPers got to the top... only to be sent down the hard way. So many kills that way.
---
You're most likely correct.  It's too bad it wasn't designed to incorporate this initially.
---
This. It is the most hilly map ever
---
Well, where are these pictures you necrophiliac?!
---
Is this a repost from 2018 or something?
---
I can confirm this is not the case. My non instigating fully charged shots do not deal as much damage.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. They just bring new buggy features to the game and left as they are. Many of the challenges have been broken since BETA and never fixed.
---
Ghooost Riders in the Skyyyyyy!
---
Low level items make more sense, I picked up some nice legendaries for cheap that make leveling easier.  Plus they get way more caps than they would just selling it to a vendor and most likely said player is also scrip capped.
---
Well the best thing to do is check your stock, if you have enough stuff for sale to put you over the limit, just put a limit on them...only sell a few things that won't put you over your limit.
---
And if you are at the limit then just remove the power and wall the vendor off until you need more caps.
---
I rather it just not make me naked and be an outfit. Or they can fix Radshield not giving the passive effect that makes "&lt;1" possible. Or make anti-rad masks... There's a lot of solutions but I never seen them acknowledge the requests or plan anything for us non PA users.
---
Awe not that bad! Think about it... all that power while running around naked!! The true power is being confident with one self 🤣
---
I try for everyday.  Level 103
---
I agree i also agree sentinel effects should not be activated if the player is jumping either. The text states (standing and not moving) so why is this a thing.
---
Thank you for this, one follow-up question I wondered about as I’m about to embark on playing with mutations. Does L2 Starched Genes also protect your mutations from Decontamination showers?
---
Sorry not for sale maybe if I grind for another one
---
Cultist Dagger doesn't work either. I didn't notice until I cleared to packs of wolves. I moved my camps to make a new knife to finish the quest, as my only knife was the cultist dagger.
---
Can you spare a Meteoric Sword? I think I only have 15 left.
---
I can’t imagine you were able to loot several identical explosive energy weapons? If not nothing to worry.
---
I sell them on PS4. It’s slim right now but I plan on grinding Free Range a few times tonight. I have all the plans so any I get are for sale. Alternatively, I can sell you any of them you want. Burning, barbed, burning barbed, electrified, poisoned, or heavy staffs or clubs. 200-450 caps depending on the weapon and mod. Add me if interested, same psn as my username
---
INB4 Git gud scrub
---
I completely agree though.
---
I have Sentinal and would hate to see that go but I agree. Both should be patched but not one before the other, both at the same time for PvP balances
---
Il give that a try, thank you.
---
Does it show when you are talking even when it's not working? Or does it just bot pick anything up?
---
people dont realize this! i justify buying a game like this, i can turn down going out drinking with friends ONCE a week and boom i can afford it. before you say anything yes maybe we do drink a little too much...
---
Level 199, and yes.  Between my excess, bulked scrap and various chems I don't use, I almost always hit the limit.
---
What is fair about having (reportedly, per OP) overpowered weapons that are no longer obtainable in game? Is it better to be fair to the .02% who have them (ignoring the effects of dupers, because then you’re no longer talking about people who “rightfully” got them) or to the 99.08% who can’t compete because these weapons don’t exist as drops anymore?
---
Lvl 208 and always near max caps. I've been doing this as well as buying all the plans that I dont have to break even on this 1400 cap a day. I try to always stay over the 20k mark and set that 5k aside to buy all the plans from vendors! =D
---
They do, generally. At my camp, I spawn right on the edge of my camp radius outside my gates. Other players spawn usually outside my front door
---
The game is sometimes weirdly predictable and I will explain why..
---
If you get a particular weapon of choice or near the perk build you want, I find another tends to follow a lot quicker. Often the weapon is a lesser star.
---
Today, in the space of 1hr, the rng returned with a vengeance, I got 2 x 3 ⭐️ instigating ski swords..both had swing speed too..
---
With regards to the grognak axe, I have played over 900 hrs and never got a 3 ⭐️ bloodied axe but I did a furious..and then the next day, I get a 1 ⭐️bloodied grognak axe..this is a game that just seems to know you..knows what you have and gives you the opposite lol.
---
Anyone else had similar experiences?
---
If you're ranged, you can lure the Grafton Monster to the outskirts and shoot from protection inside a shed in Grafton Days.  In Protest March in Grafton, theres another good place to hide behind some sandbags near the "square" where the event activates.
---
What goes around is all around.
---
Nope. I got a level 1 board. Can’t remember the Legendary modifier though. I gave it to a low level player. It made a great first weapon.
---
I'm lvl 104 and I do a daily cap run - I usually am selling meat.  Every few days I'll sell excess stimpacks and water as well.  Once a week I'll sell extra scrap.
---
500 on a max level furious .50 cal is about right...it'll sell. The only problem is that it's a specialized build that will want it. The reality is 1K would not be out of line to the right person/build. 
---
The other big deal is going to be location. If you're looking to sell high end armor/weapons you need to be E of the Devide and generally to the south half of the map. 
---
I mostly sell medium to high end plans, armor and  weapons.  I try to stay away from specific builds like bloodied or junkie. I've made probably 30k selling... and spent probably 20K on newer items for myself...you never can have enough backup explosive weapons! 👍 LOL. 
---
All of my lower level items went into the recycle bin for their star weight in scrip and I'm maxed out on that until tomorrow.  Wheeeeee!
---
So you got a legitimately decent 2 star weapon!  Just ignore that vestigial star there, it isn't important.
---
I’ll be on tonight, thanks!
---
I guess it's just the high capacity then oh well time to grind
---
Deathclaw Island. Northwestern by ferris wheel image on map.
---
There's usually a glowing one near the power station to the northwest of Watoga.
---
Make sure to clean up after yourself
---
I have some chameleon and i can jump while being invisible but i think it should be gone as well. Makes no sense but i hope bethesda catches on with some balancing changes.
---
God this, also make the smaller pieces available in all of these damned floor textures I own now.
---
It shows when I’m talking most of the time. I wait until the game is running then I cycle the plug on the mic. Once the mic is started back up I press the PTT key to test and see the “speaking” indication on the screen.
---
I HAVE had one weird issue with PA frames and naming, but I haven’t dug into it much, it’s just a bunch of full sets of various leveled ofT-series and raider armor stored on a mule. I keep ending up with an unnamed frame when i log in, so far it usually ends up being a level 15 raider suit, but I haven’t investigated.
---
There's a circulating theory that RNG seed is based on what you store and use. I don't have nearly enough datapoints to comment upon its validity.
---
If you have friends to run with get someone to craft you a Tesla for your level and go tagging enemies while your team mop up. Hit spots with high level super mutants.
---
All the issues we're having and this is what you're pushing? We can't be playing the same game.
---
Yeah, I have that with handmades.. had over 10 leg handmades in the course of this build, so far
---
I'm pretty sure that one's untameable since it's not a random spawn.
---
I do this on the regular just because it’s fun.
---
I don't judge :)  Sometimes's I RP my hillbilly hunter - drink a six pack IRL and go lurk huntin' in game.
---
Old Gauss rifle model as a skin for the gauss rifle
---
Having brick poke through posters and painting shouldn't be a problem on the inside, your putting the wall backwards
---
Can we get some fucking interior walls while they're at it?!
---
I thought it couldn't be a every day spawn
---
Haha that was also my first thought 😂 the reality was naked it does only 102 dmg. But that's because of my mutations I need for my unyielding Bloodied build 😅
---
Level 120
---
Was a bit of a struggle to do until i hit close to Lvl 70ish (didnt even discover Harper Fairy or Watoga until then) And most times i didn't bother (hit the Cap Limit) but once they added the Known tag to plans and fixed them showing up in the shops i almost went broke buying them so im trying to build back up. User Vendors have made that difficult so even more reason to Cap Out daily.
---
I load Up on all Junk throughout my nightly sessions so im fully loaded ready to sell the next time i log in. My Character lives off Grilled Radstag, Ribeye steak, Buffout and is loaded up with a ton of weight reducing legendaries and Carry Weight+ mods and Perks. If i find I'm low on stuff to sell ill go hit a 40-50 level area load up on guns and go sell those. They can fetch a pretty good price.
---
Lately since i started running with Thru Hiker instead of White Knight (have plenty of Ballistic Fiber, almost too much) I've been doing a lot of Food and Cooked Meat sales.
---
Run Pharma Farma 24/7 and get loaded with Stimpacks and other Chems usually as well (Traveling Pharmacy Helps with their added weight).
---
I'm starting to really believe there is truth in this...I really do
---
I wish we could tame the Sheepsquatch - get myself a lv 80 SSQ from Free Range.
---
What would be equally nice is if after choosing to go into a different server, the game didn't automatically put you back in the same server and ask the same question again
---
My camp is in a very uncommon place to build. I have had the notification maybe 3 times in total since the update that introduced it. Yesterday, I had it happen 4 times IN A ROW. There is no way the game was putting me in different servers
---
Then you will be depriving people of drops if they get something to roll the same stats twice. This is rare, but less rare than duping (according to Bethesda less than 1% of the playerbase is actively engaged in duping)
---
Bloodied the best way anyways lol 👍🏼
---
Say that to the 78 dmg per shot dude 😂
---
Damn near burst out laughing at my desk at work over that poster.
---
To be fair, so do I.
---
oh this was adventure mode.
---
I think that they just dont have any status for jumping and so ir doesnt affect anything. It doesnt affect Sentinal, Cavaliers, chameleon, or sneak.
---
Nah they realized they were giving too many Atoms Daily/Weekly so they made the challenges harder/impossible so people might spend real money.
---
Nerd rage and Radicool are all you need for perks. Then Adrenal Reaction and you’re good.
---
Depending on your build, you should be able to do a non-nuke WS run solo - and in a couple more levels, a nuke run ( I started doing them about L27).  
---
Its gonna be difficult, but it is not impossible.
---
or, try this route:
---
Grafton steel, Grafton Dam, Penetentary, WV Lumber, Wade Airport; all have a high super mutant count - as a bonus, all are PA spawn points.  Stop at the little places in between.   
---
Leave Wade and go to the Teapot.  Complete the challenge there.
---
Goto charlston train station to scrap/sell stuff.
---
LEave the train station, go across the red bridge to the mining HQ building, clear that, then go up and left to Riverside Manor and pick up the mysteries quest.  Then head to the SE corner of the ash heap and start the Miner Miracles quest.  Leave there and visit the 3 tall towers, then roam the Ash Heap area.
---
Thanks so much ill try this!
---
Some casuals only go off of in game value, paying no heed to the marketplace, or even aware of the rarity of some drops.
---
Good info.  Thanks!
---
Wait, if it was after fallout 2, how did we have the phaser in f2?
---
How high are you? On a scale from 1 to Snoop Dogg.
---
I moved everything inside on a foundation and it still happened again last night. Maybe it has something to do with max weight? Or the fact that I keep crashing every 10 minutes
---
I had 8 badges and was sweating over which one to get. Saw the damage reduction on the high capacity and said “no thanks”.
---
Armor all the way.
---
Kinda hoping for guys like you to clean out my bullet stash!
---
They did way more than play doctor. One of the loading screen texts calls them "Half government, half humanitarian aid". They took care of the settlers and controlled most of Appalachia, and even worked with the Charleston Emergency Government before the Charleston flood. They even arrested instead of killing raiders.
---
/s Yes because making a glass window is totally a dyi project.
---
Are you daft? Dupers have more control over the trade economy than Bethesda does. They've almost certainly halved the longevity of the game we all bought. It effects EVERYTHING.
---
We really need wood building sets that actually look good
---
Regardless of plans, I sell them at 50 caps each. I have soooo mannnnny fucking plans, I don't care how much I sell them for!
---

---
I'd myself tend to be in favor of this theory, but it's really really hard to research that without hundreds or thousands of people doing same stuff with same builds over and over again.
---
Came here to say this as well.
---
Pervs unite.
---
Then i dont know D:
---
Jup. I love it. I collect every Bloodied Melee with swing speed. Really amusing walking the way like One Punch Man with an BSS Glove that does 750 dmg per punch haha 😂
---
If you're having loading hiccoughs on an online game, chances are that the issue is the assets are taking a little too long to load when you enter a new 'zone'.  It could be a graphics issue (which you seem to have covered pretty well), but it could also be your connection.  If you're on wifi, *stop it now!*  If not, check your throughput, speed stability, and ping to see if any of those are sub-par.
---
Your specs seem fine, though I've heard more than a few times that this game will be a tough load on any system if you've got the graphics turned all the way up (especially related to the draw distance), so I guess it might just be something inherent.  But I think I'd take a pass on thinking about upgrading anything there, you *should* be able to get decent performance with what you have.
---
I built mine in a power line tower thing, so it looks supported
---
I noticed this as well, pretty sure it is character based, as it doesn't show up on other characters under challenges .
---
Yeah... I feel with you haha
---
I'm on PC and honestly its ridiculous.
---
Never ending doesnt exist in fo76 and it's a primary suffix so it could never be on a two shot weapon even if it was.
---
Honestly if Bethesda has skins for all weapons I will probably be broke from buying them. I enjoy using many different weapons and always wished I could give them a fresh look. I’m thankful that there are only four for ranged weapons in atom store and three of them I never use. Never would buy hairstyles either. Thousands of atoms but nowhere to spend, thank you beth.
---
Yeah, thanks, BEACH BOYS!
---
I know dude
---
A balanced version of that "Place Everywhere" mod from Fallout 4 still sits at the top of my wish list for this game, right by synchronized corpse/item physics and human NPCs. People already build janky floating camps that look like ass, but God forbid I try to move bottom level stairs without jumping through a million hoops, or try growing corn too close together.
---
Also,
---
&gt;Cannot place item: Nothing is selected
---
Never ending doesn't exist in this game
---
Quad and double, the two effects that replaced it, are primary effects. So they would replace two shot
---
Yup. It's a tough problem to fix because most solutions are unacceptable. They need to eradicate all methods then add another higher level of items. Then the only advantage dupers have is a large amount of caps to buy good stuff. And of course that solution dies the second a new dupe glitch surfaces.
---
A friend asked me to transfer a weapon for him. I gladly said I would help. Turns out, it was exactly same 3* shotgun, and I had two same weapons simultaneously. 
---
If you think the rule you proposed is fair and valid, you ain't Country Roads yourself :(
---
Was having this issue the other day, found that if i left build mode and came back it let me place them. Its a total pain in the ass to keep going in and out though because a green light says its floating or intersecting. Also, the powered doors are pretty kuch useless because you can only open them from 1 side.
---
Hi, where'd you pull those numbers from? Did you just make them up? Do you have any numbers to back that up? If not stop using made up numbers to reinforce your point. It makes you look like an ass.   
---
What's fair about taking someone's weapon they paid numerous amounts of caps for or grinded for hours for?   
---
What's fair about stripping tens of thousands of players of their guns based on the whining of a few assholes on reddit?   
---
What's fair about going back on your word that you would grandfather those weapons into the game?   
---
To give a concession to your argument laser rifles and gatling plasmas were super OP because the 100% explosive damage bonus still affected them with a beam splitter on. This is no longer the case and they've gone from God-Tier to Top-Tier with Patch 9. Bethesda has already done something about them along with explosive shotguns. Calling for further nerfs would be out of spite that you can't acquire one or aren't specced for them. They're now in line with every other gun in the game
---
took me 3-4 server hops at Whitesprings. Ansel spawns pretty much right in front of you so it's ideal.
---
I'm a solo player as well but I just pretty much hung out at Camp Adams and waited for other Pioneer Scout prospects to show up. teamed up with the first I found and revived each other
---
Yeah. I noticed from the start it cost 40, then if I want move it shortly thereafter then it’s 160 caps. Where was the rule it would cost 4x if you want to move too soon.
---
So by nightmare scenario you mean business as usual?
---
None of my critter/animal/other player doing x while wearing y pictures count for the daily/weekly/tadpole challenges and it's beyond frustrating. I want those atomic dollars and my badges!
---
I did Archer, Hunter and Mammalogist.
---
If you put tinfoil in a microwave oven it blows the thing up. Imagine what happens if you wear tinfoil in a radioactive wasteland, ever thought about that? didn't think so.
---
It's potentially a game changer...but as with everything with this amazing game, I'm ready for disappointment lol.
---
I really feel though that the purveyor offers the game excitement and opportunity and potentially levels out the playing field with legendary weapons, it flushes out the market a bit and offers massive rewards for lower levels too..imagine the low levels farming that 1000 scrip and then bashing out 3 star top weapons and in turn boosting their speed at levelling far quicker..
---
Except that you only get one 3 star a day with the current system only allowing you to gather 150 scrip a day. The fastest you can get them is four 3 stars in three days. It won't be a good "farm" it will just be an alright bonus to the current farming methods
---
I try to be fair with all my prices but the double edged sword of this whole player vending system is no matter how fair you price something someone will still be selling it lower lol .
---
I've gone to numerous people's camps to check out their vending machines only to see them selling stuff cheaper then the game has it valued at even lol . 
---
After 1000 plus hours invested into this game I'm in no hurry to sell a rare plan for 200 caps just because Bethesda suggests that's all it's worth on their cap value lol 
---
All in all love player vending though !!!
---
The lowest price for a serum recipe is 17,500!
---
So bling it out and put on the right perks, handmades are one of the more sought after weapons for a reason.
---
Unless you're trying to run bloodied, then just keep playing the lotto, you don't have much wiggle room in your drops if you're doing that.
---
Yeah Just weird.
---
Don’t think it’s my internet and I am hardwired. 
---
Do you get his issue by chance?
---
It’s a cool idea but I would probably run away if someone was talking to me like an old woman (unless you’re an old woman).
---
I’m afraid the most roleplaying I have done was to actually sit on the benches by the fire for the new campfire event.
---
Seems like a weird decision "lets put this in a section that is hard to reach, takes you out of the game, and works completely differently than everything else in that menu!","Brilliant!"
---
I have definitely noticed trends. I have found 5 anti-armor guns in a row at one point, and in the past few days about 60% of my legendary drops have been bloodied even though I don't run a bloodied build. I know there's a luck factor in everything, but a lot of this seems too consistent for luck. The problem is no individual person will be able to gather enough data to prove anything, and datamining doesn't help because it's generated server side
---
Happens to me CONSTANTLY. Since I usually travel solo, I assumed it was some sort of balancing mechanic: enemies too numerous or high-level dropping dead so they don't pose too much of a challenge.
---
Yesterday a three-star legendary glowing diseased wolf had a heart attack just as I was getting ready to rush him. I WAS SO PISSED.
---
The ugly green light is pretty much **the** reason I constantly wear a mining helmet with its own light. Modded that thing to bright and never looked back.
---
FOMO, baby!
---
Hahaha. Nothing is selected. I’m looking right at the THING I’M SELECTING!
---
AA L45 dropped from legendary bloated one at WS.
---
IIRC, under 200 hrs in and had not made L50 at the time.
---
L82 now, haven't seen another one.
---
Yes it does.
---
This is incorrect - I tamed one last night with level 3 Wasteland Whisperer
---
The Walking Dead fans would call that the [Hershel Gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P224BTri7RQ), but no, it's not possible in FO76. :-(
---
Some of the challenges are bugged
---
I bet he does, lol
---
Water in the game seems to cause FPS issues.
---
The pond with the crashed vertibird at the top of the mire is where I always get my deathclaws. Tamed one last night - you need level 3 wasteland whisperer
---
Yeah. Shouldn’t the keypad be on the outside? Ridiculous.
---
Salt for 25k
---
&gt; when the RNG turns out to be as good there as everywhere else
---
The drop chances should be exactly the same as getting a 3 star from any other (high level) source, I wouldn't expect it to be any different.  It's just that this week you get 10 lottery tickets instead of 1 (and ~1.5 per week going forward).
---
Still a whole 21 hours left
---
RIP
---
Still tomorrow at least
---
I know. I just hadn't seen anyone post about this one being bugged. I'll add it to my list of ones I can't finish yet
---
I believe they have nerfed this, my last Queen kill yeiled no flux reward!
---
I just realized the port a diner is a completely accurate portrayal of a real claw machine. perfectly aligned yet it randomly decides whether you will get a prize or not.
---
Got a bloodied and a instigating during a single run at white springs both 1star but I keep both on me and switch between the two.
---
I've carried three one star Grognaks and one one star handmade rifle with me for at least the last 350 hours. Since then, I've had maybe five more one star Grognaks drop and three handmaded. Two of the handmades dropped on the same WS run.
---
I'm waiting on a level 50 Mutant Slayers axe to drop, preferably with swing speed too but I doubt I'll ever see it. Today a Bloodied Crossbow showed up but it was only level 35.
---
"Leave me alone."
---
"Can't do, I'm roleplaying as a reporter. Could you get yourself killed so I can finish the article and stop following you?"
---
This is why they haven't yet added travel mats back in. Some people will use them to have you land in death traps.
---
Got my first bloodied/swing speed weapon this past weekend. It's a board 😑
---
https://i.imgur.com/6g4vfhv.jpg. this was a crazy fight, sheepsquatch vs 4 fog crawlers, I tag em then hid with chameleon armor to watch the fun
---
Put stuff in it.
---
I’m going to steal this and use it often. Just awesome!
---
Lots of streams in the Mire!
---
level 202 right now, it depends. Sometimes I clear out a vendor and have to buy plans in order to give them some more caps. Other times I leave them at maybe half. Grinding out caps is not a big priority for me because I'm getting so many of them from my vending machine, and I already have pretty much everything I want in the game. Everything I'm buying at this point is either a luxury or just for the sake of completionism
---
Yes, you can happy get rid of any plan that has the prefix (known)
---
Lol. You first “call me out” for making up numbers, and then turn right around make up your own numbers (“stripping 10’s of thousands of players...”)
---
You know what makes you look like even more of an ass? Hypocrisy. 
---
I’m on mobile and at work right now, and just based on the hypocrisy it’s not worth it for me to dissect the rest of your points.
---
The way I see it is: I don't want to earn anything, just make me more powerful and better than most everyone else; here is some of my actual money to make that happen.
---
Gaming companies love these kinds of people. These are why microtransactions and pay-to-win games are so profitable. This instant gratification mentality is fine for single player experiences, but FO76 is a cooperative/competitive experience. Not earning something, trying to buy the OP stuff, is an unfair advantage over others. I find it akin to hacking a game of counter-strike. I don't have the time to "get good" like everyone else, this is why I use aim bots and wall hacks! Same thing in my mind.
---
Edit: I should also mention this behavior is extremely selfish. Fuck your experience! Me! Only me!
---
Everything. The shop is a rip-off and even criminal.
---
On PC...sorry....
---
Easier to kill Mole Miners Welch usually has low level miners plus you can server hop and collect all the weapons for steel.
---
Contact customer support, they can refund your atoms!
---
The in game value is like 10 caps for the faschnacht masks, isnt it?
---
Porn.
---
Oh wait, did you mean in game?
---
Ah ok I'm on PC, we only get the option of on or off in game
---
Really that great to know. Might go try myself at some point. However wonder why it was in the notes 🤔.  
---
Prob same goof mistake they claim with backpacks with power-armours 
---
Thx man I’ll stand corrected
---
You have to be superclose to let the tag for cargobot appear before taking the photo.  Disabling the engines with vats targeting without destroying it helps greatly.
---
Used to be that redrocket in the ash heap had one next to a truck.  If the truck got destroyed the explosion blew the food straight out of the machine.  I mentally noted it in case I ever have to break into a RL claw machine.  Use a truck XD
---
When you are wanted other players won't show up on your map.
---
Or just use an AAE 10mm SMG, no perks with Speed Demon, Marsupial and Quick Reload mag. Jump and gun is so much fun
---
The ban wave was pretty delayed last time. I'm hoping it will happen now as well. The issue is since they're so conservative with the banning to minimize collateral damage, they're giving people time to spread the masks around to people who won't get punished
---
Fortunately - FTFY
---
Just go to whitespring or a nuked zone.
---
It’s not water though it’s when I load new areas
---
Mine took literally days to construct and get just right. You think im gonna give away where it is?   
---
NOPE
---
Silly question, perhaps. You know you can’t see others on the map when you’re wanted, right?
---
S9 I do need a level e wasteland whisperer:/
---
Let me guess. South of Whitespring near the Junk Pile?
---
Mike Tyson could 1 punch a SBQ or Mr. Dream depending on which game you have.
---
Yep that’s the place I went again today and it seems to be a Sheepsquatch zone because most of the time I find one here or in the cranberry bogs in the really big pink looking tree forest a lot of people say you can find a Sheepsquatch roaming around but it’s mostly a lvl 80  legendary or some variant of the Sheepsquatch but if you do the free range event you fight a Sheepsquatch at the end anyway so you can find him just like any cryptic in game just be aware of your surroundings his like to mothman FREAKIN POP UP FROM ANYWHERE 
---
Remember kids you hear a really loud howl near by RUN FOR THE HILLS ITS THR SHEEPSQUATCH
---
Wooooow. Lololololol
---
They do this and every camp will have DEEZ NUTS written all over its blackboards.   
---
I have.. that feeling lol
---
No, it effects nothing. Some people have gotten manipulated with bogus prices and are now pissed that others actually want to sell weapons at cheap prices. Decent prices. If dupers want to see low, whatever, I’m not pvp’ing everyone I see so I don’t care who has what. If they want to sell high, also who cares. Let them make caps off of suckers who buy gear at 27k caps. I won’t be buying from them. Dupers don’t regulate the trade economy. Neither does bethesda. They have slapped suggested prices on things and it’s up to individuals what they want to charge or buy. It’s like art. That two shot explosive shotgun I’ve had in my stash for months might be worth something major to someone, but to me it’s weight in my stash I just want to ditch, so I sell it for under 1k. It’s all just a video game man, we’re literally arguing over fake bottlecaps and digital items for bragging rights. It’s dumb

---
so right, not 2 hours ago I move my camp closer to water, and set up a nice area for my crops, fenced in, the whole thing, yeah, good luck trying to get those crop f'ers straight, green my ass, all it did was yell at me.
---
Even Rolling Pins
---
What if it had nothing to do with your character and your actions but you just played on a server that tended to drop AA at given moment?
---
No way to rule out conditions doing that on small scale.
---
Downvoted for spite only. &gt;:)
---
Well then, I've learned something today!  Honestly first time wanted and want someone to get me....

What's your GT

haha fair enough

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8u5q/ui_issue_post_patch_9/ It has been observed and put into a bug list by another member. I don't think there is a workaround or fix yet.
---
naww man you don't want that that shit is used up man lol
---
This was tremendous
---
Ahhh I see you've given up. Mine is based on copies of games sold. This game has sold millions of copies and we'll say theoretically 1% (the common number everyone uses) of one million of them have duped weapons. Whats that number? 10,000. I used your numbers for that and I'm a hypocrite? You're illiterate.
---
I RP as a clown either with the Fasnacht Man mask or with the Monster Mask. They both have their own personalities / different voices. But just for funsies, I LOVE sneaking up behind players and start breathing heavily. The reaction when they turn around is always priceless! Some dont react but the ones that do smack me with their one handed weapons or i hear screamings when they are on their mics.
---
I would like to stim him and have a mutie friend.
---
Bud..I will be on in 2 hrs, I can do this for you- no charge.
---
To be fair, we thought that as soon as we saw base building and multiplayer for this game
---
No risk with mutation loss in a decon shower with level 2 Startched Genes.
---
I have a personal shower at my base and run through it 50x a day.
---
I know it, who do you think used her up??
---
2h to late here 😥
---
Thanks my dude
---
Level 130.  Run once through West Tek and sell off everything.  Takes less than a half hour, do this every day.
---
Bummer..sorry can't do it sooner
---
Those plans are all available up at Top of the world, either at the train station or at the raider bot in the basement of the ski lodge just north of TOTW.
---
Are we a Grape Memtat popping junkie or an OMG high Charisma?
---
I am not super high level yet, so caps are scarce. I scan what is for sale at every camp I wander past. I am loving everyone that has good, inexpensive plans. If I ever see your place I am sure it would make my day!
---
Prices go down =/= healthy game economy.
---
My argument is that dupers have hurt the game economy. The only reason you see things priced for 40k is because they are trying to get the attention of duping buyers. They were printing money with nuka colas. They own the trading economy. They give no shits about the game or you. They are not doing you a favor. They want to profit of you all.
---
It’s getting to the point I don’t want to plant crops ‘cause it’s such an ass pain.
---
Whats max btw? Just hit 100 hope thats enough for something good.
---
I do the same thing
---
Wait, how do you leave notes?
---
I havent thaught this part
---
Yes, defeating the Schorched Queen will award some stable Flux types.
---
Had one wood wall that was flipped the wrong way (inside out). Could not get it to flip back. Tore everything down and built somewhere else. At least the walls are right now. Not the roofs though.
---
Do you put your caps on a mule?
---
At first a combo of beer, grape Mentats and magnetic personality, but since my bloodied/unyielding melee character, she can get it natively with no drugs as long as she's bleeding on Modus's nice clean floor!
---
I just drop them lol I don’t remember where I found that one
---
Well have you investigated on the hill behind Berkely Springs wink wink?
---
They dropped a note that was picked up in the world, not a custom note or anything.
---
This actually sounds like so much fun! As a vagabond in the game, it would be a dream to watch and spectate all of this and take photos! I hope this somehow gets recorded! I would love to watch it!
---
I thought about that myself, but how do you leave notes???
---
The toaster
---
I will have you know my good sir that there are absolutely no lights in the rest of my camp but it doesn’t say “summer sales event extravaganza” it says “serums guns plans junk everything must go” and “vsvxx” (my gamer tag) all in neon and it has all the crafting benches and what not so it’s just the essentials to a merchant camp build (side note the house behind it is 3 stories mostly fully furnished) i have 3 terminals stored though so if some of my friends need to do the tadpole scout hacking challenge I can help them out
---
So the Sheepsquatch can even pop in flatwoods oh my beginning players be shaking LITERALLY
---
max is 1000
---
Omnytrix
---
Does Perforating Mag do anything more for the AA or is it redundant?
---
I’ve considered switching from Bloodied to a full health/AA build, but the damage trade of just doesn’t seem worth it.
---
100 I'd enough for your choice of either one random 3 star armor peice, one random 3 star melee weapon, or one random 3 star ranged weapon. You dont get to pick the weapon or its affects, only how many stars and if its ranged or melee.
---
I did it twice Monday night and each time I got 1 violet and 1 crimson. I've gotten anywhere from 2-5. The only time I ever got none is when I fast traveled there right before it ended and server was really laggy. When that happened, I didn't get any loot, xp, or caps.
---
BOOM...Toasted!

---
The game sold 1.4 milion copies. 1400000\*.01=14,000 or we could used 99.08% (your exact number) of people who don't which mean .0092% of people do. 1400000\*.0092=12880.

Would you care to remove the foot from your mouth and read the rest of the points?

Might be online, time Will tell 🤣
---
There is no "other interpretation," lol... Butcher Pete is a sex addict and probably a rapist too.
---
Oh, it's not a custom note then?
---
It’s more of a You trust me, I’ll trust you type situation. I keep it? I lose out on 10k caps, and he loses out on a plan that’s worth a lot because of the bug. But it’s going to be patched soon, so can’t keep it for long. So there’s factors that go into it that helps us. 
---
Would’ve had 3k left over anyway. And I got a weapon sale tonight that will sell for 5k caps.
---
Great, hope to see you tonight..
---
My current base is just north of prime. Just above the and a tad to the right of where everyone nukes.
---
I have and have had a bunch on sentinal....but i cant get used to the idea of standing still while im getting shot at....and i dont care enough to change my habbits...its nice, but ever time i see people asking for sentinal armor, i imagine people lining up like colonial soldiers and shooting at each other
---
Got loot, xp and thr killing blow, alas no flux, this was before the hotfix though so might have been a bug!
---
I suggest playing a different game then.
---
What do you buy with all those caps
---
It enhances the tension the situation. You have no idea what’s about to happen as your assassin creeps up behind you...

Lol. That's why the other players arent liking it.

It’s not. I find a lot of funny labeled notes in the world that I hold on to for drop like this lol

We're talking about CAMP budget, not Stash. Or at least I thought we were. It says CAMP like 6 times in the OP, and stash not once?

Some level 250 dude came thru my camp and had the mask, was the first time I’ve ever seen it before. We traded thru our pipboys and I requested it. His inventory wasn’t anything wild soo I highly doubt he was a duper, I requested the mask and one of his god rolls and he declined and started to walk away... I’m sittin there sadly watching him wander away from my camp when he throws up the gift emote, I walk over and he dropped old man winter on the ground for me :) couldn’t be happier, thank u random dude who had a heart for a measly level 103
---
10s of hours lol as in more than 10!

Add me on PS4 man, same as my name here. I'm really into building, quite proud my latest place!

I want one. where are the plans for them?

I think it might stack, I've never tried. I personally suck at keeping my HP Up so I dont use Bloody, since I'll die.
---
Did you miss today being Wednesday?
---
I hate when I'm placing something on the ground and its green but the message says cannot place item need support. Or when trying to place something, its green and get the message connot place item, nothing selected. Well it sure the hell IS selected.
---
Having a deathclaw is awesome.....keep in mind, if u have a vendor box at ur camp, someone will kill ur deathclaw very quickly
---
It’s a note I found in the world
---
Exactly! Our mission is to rebuild society, for fucks sake! And yet no-one of the smart people able to build plasma gatlings and power armor from scrap should be smart enough to build straight standing houses that don't look like shit thrown at a wall and using what sticks
---
...and also let me remove it again
---
I only get crashes when fighting the SBQ and it glitches but then the whole server crashes had this happen twice. But when I return to the same server there's usually a bunch of people returning to the same server and the nuke zone dissapeared but all the dead bodies are there unlootable. And everyone putting up ? Mark emotes.
---
You know what else I want - buildable trailers.  This is WV damn it!
---
2750 caps? Thats actually pretty low. People sell that stuff already for 10k and wonder why they dont get any more caps because they already at 25k max caps xD
---
Thats my hope... its too bad you couldnt narrow your roll some more tho. People expecting tse or something gonna be disappointed when they find pipe rifles in the mix hahahaha
---
All People who got good weapons by fair methods  will suffer by this solution.
---
Drop it.
---
I really suck at this don't I...
---
Yeah, that would suck. Be funny though. 
---
Run 50 feet, no AP.
---
I dont know if they got cheaper with this new dupe epidemic, but the serum recipes go from 3k-5k caps depending on where you get them. I paid 4k for mine. They got a lot more rare after they were removed from the queens loot pool a couple patches back. Duping made them more common.
---
I'm just tired of replacing them. Anything that spawns around my camp immediately focuses on killing my crops and my brahmin (Beth) before my camp is even done loading in.
---
No Textchat no Roleplayers
---
Even 1* bloodied weapons can go for &gt; 2K if it's one of the preferred range or melee ones.
---
I use the label of clothing and armor from the metal letter set. :)
---
Whoa. I forgot about the “needs support” message. Very frustrating.
---
Added
---
The upgrades are plans within the game. This is solely cosmetic. There WOULD be outrage if atom shop items had their own catagory.
---
Not sure how rare, though I have: all level 50, Scorched, Furious, Mutant, Troubleshooter, Ghouls slayer and maybe 1 or 2 others, sold: Bloodied.  I've also gotten rid of a few lower level.
---
I have all three and would be happy to help, my friend.
---
I just play.   Casual.
---
Most sessions, my goal is to complete at least one piece of (whatever) quests/tasks are listed on the right side of my screen.  (Although my last couple of sesions have been dedicated to Camp - move, rebuild, set defense, and set up vending. Inventory/weight reduction being primary goal - caps are secondary - my prices are low.)
---
If I happen to be near a nuke zone, I may pause that goal to run the nuke zone, 
---
otherwise, I adventure on.  
---
Cap (and atom) collection happen in the process - but caps have never been my primary objective.
---
seems like they could just remove traps from being crafted. or not affect people, only npcs.
---
Got it! Won't be on until later, but if you see me on - I'll gladly show you :)
---
I was even trying to find a way to use the timer and optical triggers and stuff to make it openable from both sides. Havent figured it out. But i did find that if you place 2 foundations you can put the door in the middle of them either direction.
---
Cool
---
If it's a 3* yeah but if it's just a 1* no. Lol
---
This!!! 
---
I wish I could upvote twice.
---
You are a true lifesaver, if you wouldnt mind! :) 
---
Whenever you're free to meet up and have time, please let me know!
---
I think this along with maybe a folk channel would be a cool expansion. Right now I just use Spotify while playing and it's not quite the same.
---
Assume the backpack system allows you to manage your items more effectively, and distribute the weight more efficiently.
---
Back in the day, RPGs used a stat called "encumbrance," which wasn't EXACTLY weight, more like...how difficult is this item to manage.
---
So, if your backpack allows you to get to your kit faster, and it's less of a burden for you, it's effectively "reducing" the  weight.
---
Love it!
---
I think we need to keep everything as is for a while and let the whole economy settle with grouped faction vendor caps, player vending and the legendary vendor coming out.  Bethesda is making these great additions (all beit glitchy) and I think we need another month or two to see if there is anything that isn't working as intended.
---
Like a lot of folks have said here people like to play differently and have different priorities.  I thnk if we can have multiple ways for all players to make money, have more access to legendary gear and interact with each other in positive ways it will make this game better for everybody.Maybe even get to a point that we all hoped for last November.
---
Poor guy breaks my heart. *Why can't I help you*? ;\_;
---
If 1 is bad enough, 62 *is* tons! I wasn’t misleading anyone. A ton is a unit of weight. It’s also used to mean “a lot.” 62 is a lot. 
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions about my underlying knowledge and intentions, arguing semantics, and deflecting from a discussion of the actual problem... In service of what? Why is this a battle you’re choosing to fight in such an incongruous, poor way?
---
I placed one in front of a fusion generator and the keypad teleported onto the generator 
---
Dafuque?
---
A good way imo to resolve this is to make it so fire and electrical traps don't cause damage to friendly players kind of like turrets won't attack friendlies or if it does kill a friendly make the owner wanted.
---
Oh, right. And everything in your camp has a condition bar. So, after an attack, whatever you look at shows how jacked up everything is. Should be a way to repair to 100% so we don’t see that.
---
I bulked it w/ a fair margin of plastic and sold it all. It goes for like 11 caps a piece, so good deals
---
I'd drop 2k atoms on a prewar house set like Nate and Nora had in Fallout 4. I'd pay 10k atoms for an Institute set, even if it isn't canon lol. All that beautiful glass and polished steel...
---
I’m doing out wrong (right?) then. Usually set my prices below 200 caps
---
Yep got a 2shot faster reload and something else off it
---
Yeah I like the rustic look of cabins, but I'm getting bored of the default wood walls (either the shutters or the full wall). 
---
Perhaps just add more variants to the current wood set, just to liven it up a bit. I know there is only one type of "wood" junk, but it would be neat if there various materials: Oak, Cedar, Maple (now I'm not sure what's indigenous to Appalachia, but you get my idea).
---
Reminds me of an incident in Second Life about a decade ago. A colleague was scheduled to lead a seminar on web business in the virtual world. He was well prepared, the topics were on point, opportunities galore- but for some reason the audience just wasn’t very enthusiastic.
---
Discussed the situation with him and decided to meet online to review his presentation, to see what he could improve on. Of course, once we saw his avatar online, we knew exactly what was wrong.
---
Someone had hacked his character, and added a very large strap-on “member” to his equipment.
---
Wow. Where was that? I use Instagram to post things i find. Timmy30274
---
Extremely uninformed poster right here.
---
Or do you ever kill someone and leave the note from the insult bot. "You have been insulted." Lol
---
I'm pretty sure this is the one reason some of these notes are in the game.
---
I haven't seen that movie
---
Id also love to have 1/2 wall vertical pieces
---
we have 1/2 wall horizontal ones, and having the vertical ones would help fill gaps
---
thank you!
---
I recently found this out, it's great when you get disconnected while in a nuke zone. I only pray that someone else didn't replace my spot, if they did I can't get back in, until someone else quits or disconnects
---
Intact windows.  We're in dire need of them.  
---
WHY DO ALL BARN AND WAREHOUSE WINDOWS COME BROKEN?  WHY ARE BRICK 'WINDOWS' EMPTY FRAMES? WHY ARE WE BUILDING SOMETHING THAT ALREADY COMES BROKEN?

Sorry, just had to get that out.

I'm so fully stocked on unwanted legendary crap I  can be disappointed every week for the whole summer.

I have a 2080 and i7-9700 and 500 mb/s network. Pretty much top of the range. But even so I can't run this game on everything set to max. So most things are set to High. Every now and then I have hickups too. In my case the effect is minimal, from 60 down to say 50 and most of the time it just results in slower walking for a moment, but it is definitely noticable. Always when loading new surroundings. I have tried Metro Exodus with the same rig, which runs at &gt;170 fps all the time. So I suppose this is just a very demanding game.

Well since pacifist only prevented you from doing damage to another player, there has always been a way to kill someone through pacifist mode. Because it does not prevent you from taking damage.
---
Had the same issue. I found that if you place everything around (other walls and roofs) and after you store said staircase. It allows you to place the roof where it wouldn't allow you. Just place staircase back AFTER You places the roof

Not on a mic, but I role play a lovable NPC shopkeeper that has great deals on all items and gives lots of gifts for free. I’ve got a plethora of random “friends” that come by to shop fairly regularly. Some daily. Even some players that source new inventory for me. Never did I think this is what 76 would become for me, but I love it! [Heres a look at my shop](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U)
---
Sounds like you need to vacuum your fans, get the collected dust out....
---
Someone offered me a leather weightless weight reducing chest for 35k the other day. Am I completely out of the loop on weightless prices?  I would have expected to spend 35k on a high end full set. Not one piece.
---
and they arent able to fix any of the broken window panes, but we can mcguyver a fusion generator from screws and steel and stuff we find lying around
---
I need crimson and violet flux, shotgun shells, and cloth apparently (where did all my cloth go).
---
and making weapons and ammo from scratch is?
---
I bought it in the hopes that it was still awesome... Eh. The top upgrade on it wasn't very exciting either.
---
You could also just buy some stuff from other people's camps. Spend caps to get more caps. :)
---
I have a picture of a glowing hermit crab fighting a scorchbeast. That's a good one.
---
But also, I rarely have 2000 caps on me ever, whos getting 35k and how?
---
What does AAE stand for?
---
Just ran through pretty fast btw and I got 143 steel. That's just what I received off of the bodies. Very nice.
---
I have no clue where they came up with that price.
---
Y not? What happens there?
---
are those pc screenshots? they seem...better looking... than what i see on my ps4
---
Haha, when you only have 45 hp there’s not much to keep up. Being a sneaky bloodied build is about the only way to not die, or stack Sent or Cav armor.
---
I think they're trying to bring more players into viewing the challenges as objectives
---
I remember those notes. I think it’s in Ella’s bunker.
---
I would not mind some ploppable prebuilt houses, especially a mobile home or camper. The cabin build set would probably be my choice for a new one.
---
Its honestly alot more plausable than making glass out of glass shards. We have workbenches with the tools required to make weapons and ammo.
---
maybe
---
And that's why I have chameleon, lockpicking and auto stim, so I can run and hide.
---
It's a new bug since the patch for sure. I can exit build mode and wait a minute and then try the exact same thing again and it'll place. Then it's back to giving me the same illegitimate "no object selected" or "object unsupported" error in one or two more item placements. It's irritating if you're doing minor changes but downright awful if you're building something large. I really hope they fix it with the next update and it doesn't become persistent like the disappearing enemy glitch was (which seems to finally have been fixed thankfully).
---
Also my favorite, subtle is the right word. War looks kinda cool but they're all a little too gaudy in my taste, no offence to those who like them. This one is just the right amount of macabre.
---
All of it will be livestreamed via YouTube and Twitch.
---
I’m only 20 but I’m always looking for people to play with my GamerTag is BethesdaDaily
---
I can't imagine why anyone would do anything like this
---
There have been times when I would just put down 6 foundations and set my vault tec canopy on that and that's my camp. Fuxk it. I have room for work benches a cooking station , and a bed. That all I need.
---
You should have left out FNV to troll people and post it to the main fallout sub.
---
I just had to take half my camp deck apart to free a gentleman below it haha
---
ok ok ill lower my dirty pillow price to 15,000 caps
---
I expect they could have gotten a lot of irl money if they sold a few duped ones before everyone got one, if basically the only person who had one duped it
---
Or under it ;)
---
Ah sorry about that! Good luck! My IGN is Asully102. Add me, if I see you online and you still need help, let me know!
---
Weird
---
I’d honestly love to but I generally don’t because A: rarely does anybody talk to me, B: I think my mic is messed up bc my area chat doesnt usually seem to be working, and C: I don’t generally have a lot of privacy nor quiet in my home, which would ruin the experience by causing me to be interrupted by people wondering who the fuck i’m talking to/what I’m talking about.
---
Then when we favorite a challenge it should go into our pip-boy - right now it's too annoying to use regularly.
---
I had almost the exact same scenario with a random female character standing by my vending machines. A couple hours before someone was trying to sell me the mask for 10K which I declined politely. And hear this person was dropping it for free. Waving as they walk away. I did send a message saying thank you and the only response I got was spread the love.
---
ty very much
---
My wife no longer believes me when I say ‘I’ll literally be 5 minutes, I just need to set up this trade with a guy from Reddit’ 
---
It’s only reading this post that I realise i don’t even believe myself any longer!!!
---
When my little one wakes at 3am for a feed my first thought is ‘has the vendor reset? Shall I just jump on real quick and sell those 30mole miner gauntlets from last night?’
---
Air is real!
---
Yeah, Im on the fence as well. They should just release it on Steam, do a free weekend and I mihgt just buy it.
---
marty, we need to go back to the future!
---
Man. I have been SO tempted to do that on so many occasions. But lust build something epic wins out constantly.
---
Morgantown Airport event, "Collision Course"
---
So I shouldn't have scrapped all my bloodied gating guns, 50 cal machine guns and meat hooks :)
---
Careful, you're making too much sense there
---
Nah, instead there should be a way to mark armor pieces as visible or not. That would be easy to implement and would add a huge variety to your looks since you could hide or show each piece separately. And people could hide that one mismatching piece that they haven't found for a full set...
---
Personally I thought of this when I upgraded my favorite raider chest piece and it was the pipe style. I like the rebar spikes or the cage style, so it bugs me to look at it lol.
---
Maybe adding an \* to the armor name makes it not visible.
---
I was doing ok until player vending came out... now it's nonstop West Virginia Wasteland Fleamarket Simulator.  They put my favorite game inside my favorite game, and I haven't had a good night's sleep since.  My camp is now a mall, and Pioneer scouts can wait.  
---
I can quit whenever I want to.  I just don't want to.
---
Slightly curious where abouts in the world you are... however, I also know I'm far too broke to get a tattoo...
---
Kudos to ya on the work!
---
The trick with those stairs is to use the metal supports in the stair category, it'll snap to those in odd ways. Just be careful because sometimes you do finally get the second staircase above the first only to find it's now integral to the structure (even if there is no structure) and can't be removed at all. So you have to re-place your camp module or have a stupid staircase structure where you didn't mean to put it.
---
Damn hopefully they can fix it in the future
---
Do the Collision Course event at Morgantown airport. A cargobot lands at the end of it.
---
Easy-peasy.
---
I had that issue helping someone build a camp yesterday, specifically with half walls and roofs. Exactly the same error message you had.
---
I've encountered the floating or intersecting thing, often it can be fixed by exiting then reentering build mode. And it's always been abit touchy about removing things attached to staircases, abit annoying but not game killing in my opinion.
---
So this is a skin for existing underarmor?  Any type, or specific classes of underarmor?
---
Alt character
---
ive never been able to successfully move a camp once its been built
---
the game always tells me something is wrong with it and cant be placed
---
Yeah it's a huge pain
---
Known bug
---
2+* Heavy Combat armor &lt;1k caps
---
Plans I don't already know &lt;500 caps
---
Treasure Maps &lt;50 caps
---
Clothing I don't already have &lt;100 caps
---
I wonder if the same issue is shared between camp item placement errors and tadpole exam questions taking eons to load (or sometimes failing despite correct answers if you go very quickly).
---
Agreed.  Spending 14 hours on a build just to put broken pieces in it is kind of a buzz kill.
---
I'd also like to get the rounded walls building set they had in 4.  Was my favorite.
---
if you are on PS4, my machine has a supply of acid.  
---
Have been putting partial fusion cores in at 1cap per percent of charge, but I think someone bought the last couple I had loaded last night just before I logged off.
---
Need to restock.
---
Forest, a bit north of the bottom of top of the world ski run and down the street from the golf course.  Built on a power transmission tower.  Machine is on the 1st platform.
---
Wont be on again until late Saturday though.
---
 I thought the same way until I was informed + testing the other night. Automatic scatter laser weapons with burning mod and explosive make fireproof/dense a non-factor. Especially if you're getting focused by 2 or more players who know what's up. The laser to explosive conversion and sheer volume of these "projectiles" going downrange is fierce.
---
I love taking a few shots at it then jumping on the roof of the bus by the entrance to take photos of all the robot carnage.
---
You mean with that weird holotap from toxic Larry and him literally hurting the Sheepsquatch and Michael, Cindy camping out I yeah that’s what lead us to the Sheepsquatch it wasn’t even our plan BAAAA ITS THE SHEEPSQUATCH
---
They're not the only ones that work differently. The leveling ones that reward Perk Card packs work the same way as the Tadpole ones.
---
Dude this shit was five months ago. Check the date before you necropost, ffs.
---
its either too soon or to close to its previous location that ive noticed that it will cost 160. when ever i move it i make sure to relog to avoid the high cost and yeah if its green then let me place it too many caps spent moving my camp cause of that one centimeter of another object interfering. also whats with the floating corn?
---
Yeah, dodging the flying rocks lol
---
Vendor sales, choose a few key junk items you know people will need &amp; hammer down on farming them.
---
I haven't sold much, but the screws rarely stay long.
---
I just want to be able to use the keyboard to write with any kind of signage in the game rather than being forced to scroll through individual letters. Even with consoles you can plug in a USB keyboard or chat pad so it's not even just a PC thing.
---
And you *must* construct additional pylons.
---
Open up a vending machine at your camp. Sell your extra junk. You probably have like 2k steel saved up or something. People love that shit. Bulk it and sell them at 29 caps.
---
I'm actually online now, feel free to join my world, I'll make a party
---
Maybe he’s a pipe pistol wielding plumber? Post apocalyptic Mario?
---
Lol what? Are you a melee build, my dude?
---
I go through at least 1,000 of 5.56 every play session.
---
Welcome to one of the biggest issues with this game, the one that deadlocks your progress in totality when you run out of places to put anything because or artificial limits. Given a long enough timeline we will all face this.
---
I have had people with capped out accounts just literally give me caps for nothing because they have no where to put them.
---
just throw a grenade into the nearest chain restaurant
---
Funny story but how does this remind you of that?
---
will have to try that, thanks
---
solo player here do scorch beast or do sheep squatch for your revive 
---
athlete easy solo badge
---
archery I had 2 shot bow in stash and also have a sneak build so a trip to grafton steel mill and got most kills there 
---
hacker is pretty easy for solo all terminals necessary  are in the nuke silo for you 1, 2 and 3 all you needs is your zeros which can be found at the lighthouse by vault 76 (landing something) the house has a  zero teminal in it 
---
took me bout 5-6 hours but got it done
---
But, .38?
---
When it drops again? You just have to pick it next time you level up?
---
New player: *minding their own business*
---
Sheepsquatch: BAAAAAAAAAA
---
I left the standard fertilizer + TP + corn with the addition of a very sketchy specimen jar at a vendor last night. Them prices were crazy high something had to be done.
---
That first sentence is absolutely amazing and now I want to do a plumber build
---
I always just assumed it worked... but does it stack if multiple people do it? That would be bonkers good though.
---
The alternate interpretation of meat cleaver...
---
Nope. Not game killing. Still enjoy the game immensely. Exiting and re-entering doesn’t work for me except with “nothing is selected”. Hopefully they fix the problem.
---
I think that's what the purpose of the light boxes is.
---
Exactly
---
It's all good. I thought you had the high carry weight version that you could share, I read the body text wrong.
---
Explosive weapons were nerfed quite a few months ago
---
Ah. Well the old lady asking for Pete to chop her near the end of the song makes it clear what he is really doing.
---
If you're finding your location is frequently used, maybe start looking for a new location?
---
Explosive shotguns did 200% dmg instead of the intended 120% so yeah they got nerfed hard
---
As a tf2 player I must be really desensitized because it does not feel like that big of a problem to me. I just want to remind everyone that just because a bug is simple or obvious does not mean it can be easily fixed.
---
That's actually another really good question.  Do they stack?  Thank you.
---
Aye aye.
---
Word on the street is that none of the speed buffs stack.
---
/u/itsthebiggjohn
---
Some people mod their rifles to .38.  I would personally craft .38 if I used it because it's cheap balls to make, but maybe he just needed some on the fly?
---
What's your GT?
---
Never regretted taking Carnivore on 2 characters. Healing factor is great with Class Freak 3. Same with Bird Bones. And Adrenal Reaction is a must for bloodied (low HP) characters.
---
Starched genes 2 + class freak 3. Get all the mutations that make sense for your build.
---
I love showing up in the Nuka Cola Power Armor and dropping a new player some Nuka Cola Wild and a Blank Feedback Form.
---
I can pay 650 caps for it if you don’t want it
---
Haha. What. Haven’t you ever heard of Anti-gravity crops.
---
lol sorry. The Head Oreo
---
Jumpshots are important for certain playstyles in PvE, getting that last bit of height and distance when sniping or ~~making Free Range doable~~ targeting an enemy that's hiding behind a friendly NPC. Removing something that's used legitimately so much more often than it's used for griefing would be unacceptable collateral damage.
---
Agree with the VATS immunity, though, although I'm pretty sure it's a bug anyway.
---
Explosive weapons literally got 3 nerfs.
---
Is the purveyor just a vendor for legendaries?
---
The game is pretty cpu intensive, it'll drive my Strix laptop up to its upper limit super quickly, but I think it's thermal design isn't the best (what ya get for anything claiming "lightest" really).
---
Cleaning can't hurt it &amp; most gaming centric laptops are easy to open by design. An extreme may be replacing the thermal paste, I've seen some pretty decent improvements with that maneuver.
---
What make/model are we talkin?
---
I was late to the party too prob about lvl 100-150 but I couldn’t live without marsupial now lol
---
Oh, side note, is there an automatic .38 combat rifle? That would make the ammunition way more useful, but I haven't seen one yet
---
This shouldn’t be controversial.  Asking the devs to put something in the game that wasn’t there before, make it snap well, test it kinda sorta, is work, and I have no problem paying people for this extra work.
---
Though I admit I’m more partial to a diner set.  WV Waffle House!
---
That's a decent price for most ammo.
---
And yet the mutations dont change our apperence lol
---
Theres another one beside the Brahmin pen one.
---
The image in build mode is an upturned wheelbarrow with a pile of (whitish somehing) spilling from it.
---
Needed razorgrain and something else to build it.
---
I've had it as an option since I first noticed it in the build menu when I was sub L10, but I don't remember if it required a separate plan.
---
My single piece of Chameleon gear says hello.
---
The best defense is a good offense.
---
I don't haha. It's sitting in my vending machine priced at 6969 as a joke, no bites so far 😂 definitely would like to get rid of it
---
Sometimes when I'm connecting a powered object to a connector (selecting the powered object first), I'll jump when trying to connect the wire to the connector.  But if I cancel and then start at the connector and connect it to the powered item, it seems to work better.
---
I like to think that my role play is I'm the monster the scorched tell their children if you don't behave the nastins is going to come to eat you.(I do my best to use the cannibal perk mid combat so they can see me eat their friends)
---
What I'm saying is they are adding the ability to place more items. Such as teddy bears, buckets, burnt books, etc that we currently can't place.
---
They are looking into increasing camp budget but the decorative items that you place in shelves and cases will go by stash budget rather than camp (if they do it like the vendors).
---
Currently vendors are bugged and linking to camp budget rather than stash.
---
They are looking into adding the decoration options that the op requested and more variety in an update a few weeks away and while the Op spoke the work camp budget, they've kinda implied that it'll go by stash budget when displaying items.
---
The shelves themselves will go by camo and they've stated they are looking into a way to increase it for future decorative options.
---
Understand now?
---
Your vastly over estimating cola duppers dude. Plus they fixed the cola dupe after patch 2 in December... sorry but with 5 chars all sitting around max caps made from not duping what so ever, it’s easy as fuck for me to drop 40k for a piece that i need to complete a set. Duper’s helped the game by providing good armor and gear to people that would have never seen them for affordable prices.
---
I would say in PvP it's used legit maybe 0.01% of the time. Everyone just constantly jumps around while firing teslas and explosives.
---
Do players buy treasure maps? I used to get rid of the duplicates, but since they have no weight, I begun to keep them, though I never use them.
---
Can you explain the lottery tickets?
---
I hate when that happens
---
Mutation effect cosmetics.... I would be cool with that.
---
I tamed several from the spot under the bridge near Treetops. That’s been the location I’ve seen them at most often.
---
Okay, cool. So is 650 fine for you?
---
Yeah that's fine! You on now?
---
Events, killing shit, and player vending.
---
350 caps? shit i list my extra plans for like 30 caps theyre no use to me otherwise
---
Stacks sold under 10 caps aren’t giving you the right amount of caps currently. You’ll see someone bought 1000 rounds of ammo and it’ll just pop up showing something like 8 caps towards your total. It still charges them 1000 caps but you get next to nothing. Don’t know where all the outrage is over this, but it’s a thing to keep in mind
---
Who says it's unironic?
---
I did too for awhile, until I found my gas mask helmet and love the look.
---
Now we need what we had in the last game.
---
This game was copy and pasted from the last so it's kinda surprising this isn't in already.
---
Log cabin would be amazing. Possibly even a mobile home construction or at least have cars you could stack to make a hotel out of cars or just a badass house.
---
I can hop on in a few minutes. GT?
---
Isn't it bugged so if you sell for 1c, you get 0c because of the 10% tax ?
---
I would like to know this also. 
---
I will say that I have Speed Demon and Marsupial with Class Freak 2 and whether or not it’s working I don’t  notice much of a difference in food and water consumption.
---
Condescending much?
---
And my vendor machines are tied to my stash. The error they send says CAMP, but means stash. You can tell this by how your CAMP will still have space but your stash is full.
---
I actually figured it out since I posted!
---
It was the Nuka-Shine paint. The guy had blue eye-lamps and there was some reflection of the blue sky, I think. The reflection is fairly high on this skin, so it does seem to shift colours sometimes :)
---
Yep, happening to me as well (PC).
---
Oh, Bethesda, you never cease to amaze.
---
ActualGarbage68
---
welcome to the hotel *carrrlifornia*
---
I’d totally rock a train car with all my benches outside.
---
lol true
---
Didn't FEV also create ghouls though?
---
What in God's name is never ending
---
You should always spare one enemy's he can tell his tribe
---
I just want stairs suitable for a home
---
Watched a mirelurk queen take down a scorchbeast and later in the toxic valley saw a snallygaster take down a mirelurk queen. Go figure.
---
Yes exactly I love the name if it ever happens that’s the name I’m stealing from you lmao or if you’re Xbox we run it together
---
So wait... a one star chest piece with just weightless and nothing else for 35k? 
---
That is pretty much a scam.
---
The problem is the light box is limited to 50. I assume because they are lit up. Paper, to me, seems like it would be a less taxing thing to have hundreds of in your camp. Make it visible with some hang over or under billboard lights like it real life.
---
This is because they ruined pvp tbh.
---
Nah man. I have all of mine hooked up to a switch and cut power off from them all the time. Sometimes I even remove the wires while remodeling. I think it must be something else you are experiencing.
---
The build system is broken when trying even mildly complex things, like a stairwell. It all works against you.
---
dont sell your items too cheaply.. or the people who sell items for too much will get mad at you...
---
on ps4... might have to get an xbox too i meet a lot of cool people from all platforms!
---
Are you on PC? Maybe we could get 5 people together and test it out.
---
I didn't want lose track of any of them but I think I'll hide some of them just for the sake of my sanity :D
---
Just returning the attitude 
---
And vendors are supposed to be linked to stash but are bugged and linking to both.
---
If stash is full can't sell any more.
---
If camp is full can't sell any more.
---
Pretty sure it's supposed to be stash.
---
Damnit but yes please do lol
---
That is a good point!
---
Coming from the guy that can only have 4 turrets in his camp, the two errors i commonly run into is nothing is selected and needs support.
---
Nothing is selected is just a simple exit and enter build mode again and the needs support is usually fixed by spamming the place button until the game lags long enough to place it.
---
I never understood what support it needed. Emotional support?
---
at level 35?  people do like underleveled items for alts, but not that much :)
---
Oh ok so they were never intended to be as OP as they originally were then?
---
It was a leather max level weightless +1 luck weapon weight reducing. I thought around 3k. Maybe 4k.
---
I'm not sensitive to those issues (my eyes suck :P ), but I do notice occasional graphic lag spikes.  Not a ton, but they're there.  But I've been playing online games since...well, let's just say I was around when they *started* having graphics.  I don't expect things to run perfectly, so it doesn't bother me.
---
I've got an 'old' i7-6700K 4GHz quad with a GTX 1080 (from late 2016), so not far off what you have.
---
If you're on ps4 I can give you one just for free if you don't have one already
---
I had a lvl 18 following me and my teammate around as i looted Sutton. To the annoyance of my teammate i invited him to join us. Within 15 minutes we both got the revive challenge done and this guy went up 6 lvls. Win win
---
Ah just like the fantasy hero set from 4. Which mods fixed.
---
So remember when bethesda said we'd get mod support? When that coming tho.
---
Not at all. I'm glad other people encountered him too and wanted to simply share my pics of the encounter :)
---
Oh man they were so rare I can’t help thinking that if duping wasn’t a problem then they wouldn’t have gotten those, or at least not as many, thanks for the info tho.
---
Yep
---
I price my stuff to move. Its either making me caps or taking up space.
---
You can make some pretty decent pipe gun builds by doubling up on commando and guerrilla.  1,000 rounds doesn't last long and I start to make more when I drop below 5,000 rounds.
---
I regret every day not getting this game on PC.  Went PS4 to play with a buddy that quit a week after launch.  Worked out though cause my gf ended up loving the game and she has a PS4 also.
---
We should at least have an *option* under the appearance tab that gets unlocked for players that have mutations!
---
I get hundreds daily but you are not ps4
---
Xbox sadly
---
Oh alright that really sucks, I didn’t believe it when I originally loaded in and tried to use it because it was just so different than I remembered so I figured it had to be a bug. Thanks
---
It's a known bug.
---
Not happening to everyone Everytime but has been posted several times before.
---
There are quite a few online groups who do that. They move their camps to certain places and do that. It's pretty cool. I may do one of those eventually. :)
---
Does anyone else find that speed demon doesn't seem to work most of the time? I have all mutations except for the 2 party ones. Sometimes I am a reloading machine, other times it doesn't feel any faster than normal.
---
Looks like you had the "Wild Wasteland" perk
---
i keep forgetting about that when im shopping..
---
thanks for the reminder!
---
yes the WS bots go all red eye on you
---
Same here, i also haven't noticed a difference.
---
Not much to do with the junk weapons besides wait till tomorrow or just dump them.
---
As for earning caps you could focus on super mutants or higher level ghouls.  Both seem to drop caps fairly often, super mutants seem to drop them well over 50% of the time.  Events and daily quests also reward you with caps for completion.
---
I usually grab a couple to offset the fast travel costs and make me feel less guilty about visiting loads of different vendors :D
---
there are a couple viable builds (not meta, but decent) using .38.. and if they have it set to auto could easily blow through 2000 rounds and a 20-30 min sbq fight.. or very easily farming sb's or west tek and such..   
---
i have a combat rifle on one of my characters, zealots explosive i had converted to .38 ( i think, it was one of the odd least used ammos) because i have collected like 15k rounds and when i am on that character and in the bog i can easily chew through 2k ammo in 30-40 mins.
---
Did he have a 3 star legendary in his vendor?
---
Yes! Haha this is my favorite 😂 I have a couple of these handy lol
---
The max for a single character is 25,000 caps, but you can make another character and then use a middleman/another account to transfer some caps from one character to other, allowing you to go past the cap limit by distributing them across multiple characters.
---
I think it's ridiculous that people are demanding cap amounts that go above the max and require someone to have one or more "mule" characters. Bethesda definitely needs to implement more cap sinks to give caps some value back and reduce the crazy inflation.
---
Name it yourself lol
---
All the legendary in previous fallouts had to be named by someone.
---
Maybe it is that pesky thick heavy air?
---
I got you fam
---
Yes, but they look this way cause I use the [Optimum Reshade](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/43) mod that makes the objects a bit less blurry and saturated.
---
I use one of the supply requisition tapes and make it to the drop before the bot.
---
 No they don't stack. I like a pistol and points into the speed buff. 20% is golden.
---
You can’t tame that
---
They have it in workshops, why not camps?
---
Always leave mine unlocked for other players that might need it and I’m always impressed that people usually only take one or two each. There are some really decent players out there.
---
Theirs a video with tons of sheep vs fights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeUfheWGbiU&amp;t=97s
---
GT - Kuthorn
---
Only level 84 (I think, hehe)
---
Haha. I always say “I totally support you” when it gives me that message.
---
If there's some way to change the mechanics so jumpshots work against PvE enemies but not other players, I'd be down for that.
---
if u had all mutations then you can just play as a super mutant but only when you have them all you transform that would be really cool
---
It could just be a random bug or something then. Glad to know it isnt an oversight
---
Somewhat more understandable, but 35k is still waaaaay too much for that.
---
Tbh, rifle isn't really ideal right now for PVP. 
---
Rifle is ideally about 1 shot kills, and current Nerf/limitations to damage per shot fired makes it difficult for you to really fully take advantage of the perks/weapons right.
---
You can definitely build Rifle PVP but you're going to be limited more than most other builds currently so it doesn't make it particularly viable.
---
Anytime. My camp isn’t just a shop it’s got everything you need all for the taking.
---
There'd be no reason for her legendaries to be treated any differently than dropped ones. Prices would probably be the same as they are now; 5/15/40 and 3/9/24.
---
But you'd think it could start loading without rendering any player stuff, do the check just based on the build zone versus other player build zone, and if it finds it can't be placed it asks you if you want to try another server and remembers the ones it already tried so far within x amount of time.
---
This has been going on for a long wile. I stopped playing about a month ago because it was annoying that I wouldn’t be able to hit enemies wile in vats without exiting and reentering vats constantly.
---
I was skeptical, too, but then my experience turned out like this: practically no Bloodied weapons over my first two hundred levels, then one or two, which I kept, and fifty levels later I was swimming in Bloodied weapons of all kinds. At least two god-rolls among them (BE Minigun and B/SS/WR Pitchfork), too.
---
As for Grognak's: found a Stalker's early on (lvl 60), then none for 100 levels or so, but since then they drop regularly, albeit not that often, 1 or 2 per week I'd say. And I had to trade to finally get my B/SS Axe – love it more than my B/SS Super Sledge and its annoying rocket bang. ;-)
---
Lfg?

Your the one going on judgemental rants about the evils of industry and deeming those as lesser and we are the selfish ones cause we dont play a game exactly how you think it should be played and managed? Ok man. People who "pay" arent all noobs who buy a game spend 50 bucks on extras to be OP out the gate. Its also not unfair since the oppurtunity is available to all. I also dont know many games that have day 1 op item buys. You must hate the market subs and player vending. Putting in hours of work in a game on 1 search and not getting rewarded because of a RNG and looking for a shortcut isnt instant gratification. Its delayed frustration. Theres a difference between everyones favorite disparaging phrase of "getting good" and not wasting precious time on fruitless hunts especially when theyre broken in game! Not everyone has 8 hours a day to game but i guess those people should get a new hobby cause it might fk up your experience. Hey you guys got good and were just glass noobs so you can destroy us with ease than laugh at how dumb we are for spending money and feed your ego. This game doesnt even have P2W. Unless its player vending. Which how does me carrying 60lbs more impact your experience? Oh yeah it doesnt cause im in adventure mode running solo or in a small friendly group.
---
Events can reward decent amount of cap, and you can earn caps by selling items to players through the vendor.  With a couple of plans and the serums as exceptions, you really don't need tons of caps in this game unless you're trying to buy something major from another player.
---
I heard people were using them to glitch into places they weren't supposed to be. No idea what that means but....OP is definitely right
---
In the picture of the yearly roadmap it says new features and tgeres a circle and the cirlce has 5 syars at the bottom and a vaultboy head with a crown.
---
Trade went smooth, thanks
---
Sorry to intrude, but you are running two copies how? Beast PC owner speaking, and never teammates online to alt-sell my shit when im farming at 2am.
---
Ah, too bad. If you just stick to those spawn points you'll find one eventually
---
I found them in the store. Just search fallout.
---
Seriously, you came acting like I can't read or count and you don't think that was condescending?
---
Get over yourself.
---
It's wrong either way honestly. I am mainly complaining about PvP but if they have to patch both then so be it.
---
I was ready to go as high as 7k but they didn’t want to budge on that 35k. Haha.
---
No problem! Thank you as well
---
Ugh, this is the bane of my existence. Many times, I get that *one wall* facing the wrong way and can't flip it unless I tear everything down and start over. 
---
Then there's trying to get a staircase placed with walls and roof around the top in a 2-story building. UGH.
---
this just goes to show you when you think your the biggest fallout fan......
---
I have room stuffed with all sorts of fallout crap the west tech satchel, checker set, unopened mini nuke, all sort of glass ware, custom made end table ..  but inking one self is some next level shit well done sir..  oh and I went to a comic expo and saw a group that had a booth selling custom made power Armour  and laser rifles and the guy made a working(moving) turret  I think this game has a different sort of fan base
---
Yeah but it's nice that you can use it when playing an instrument or sleeping. You couldn't if it was in the pipboy.
---
Well im glad im happy with my remodel lol
---
Just that one.
---
The scrip you turn in is basically buying a lottery ticket that you get to try to hit it big with the legendary lottery.  If you have saved 1000 scrip, that's 10 free chances at getting a god roll item without farming up a bunch of 3 star enemies.  And continuing to turn items in will get you more free rolls at a rate of 1.5 per day (the 150 daily scrip you can earn by turning in crap items). 
---
I said per week earlier, I corrected that above.
---
oh so you’re just ignorant and believe you are smarter than everyone who you surround yourself with have a fun fucking life buddy
---
You're not my supervisor.
---
I’m so tired of fast traveling and getting stuck in the floor or wall of someone’s camp. We need the mats.
---
Nice sex cage. I’ve got one just like it at home.
---
**theif** Stop stealing the farmers milk!!
---
Lol sry I dunno
---
It has been mentioned a lot and it should be a thing for Quality of Life, so folks don’t need to risk their accounts using mods.
---
No. It's its own under armor. No under armor is a skin of another regardless of being a shop item or in-game. The plans to upgrade are under categories. For instance, the Enclave Forest and Urban under armor use the same plans but are different under armors. All plans are obtainable in the game. So having a tinfoil suit in itself is not more advantageous than wearing a t-shirt and jeans (if they're in the same category).
---
Because the upgrades are in-game, there is no "repair kits outrage". Stats for uniforms within the same category will always match.
---
Actually ran into the Sheepsquatch, the campsite, and then the Super Mutant encounter.
---
They just gonna come in your window...
---
I called my shop BOOBZ BOOZ N BOOMZ with it....
---
It's better than nothing I guess, really it's not a bad deal.  Vendor the crap for a couple caps, maybe sell a few of the OK ones for a few more caps, or turn them in for a chance at greatness (albeit a small one).
---
What I don't know (and probably no one does at this point) are the odds of different weapon types.  I don't remember the last time I got a pipe weapon off a high level legendary, so maybe they're off the loot table at that level (or at least a lower chance...or I've been extra lucky).
---
Yeah I find when interacting with certain things, there's a delay - could just be the server having a large load for a brief period of time. 
---
Sometimes when I place a camp object, I get a white scrolling wheel in the center of my screen which can take anywhere from 1 second to 4 seconds to respond.
---
And sometimes when looting enemies, the loot table just scrolls for awhile. Not sure if it's packet-loss or some other anomaly, but these occurrences seem random, but definitely are related to a client-server issue.
---
Possibly from the update with vending machines and also the dupe wave
---
I keep having this issue, sometimes it works
---
That's why I leave several unlocked- I hope people who might be disappointed what I am selling can at least grab some free water.
---
This is what I really want. The broken glass kills it for me on some of the pieces.
---
Me thinks you misinterpreted the OP ;)
---
You only have a certain percentage of a chance to milk them. Easiest way to get milk is to build the brahmin pen at your camp, try to milk, store it, and place it again and try again. Its tedious but works. You'll get milk like every 3rd or 4th try.
---
Plague Walker mutation I think  
---
Sometimes you can creep up to the limit of max range for milking without damaging the brahmin, and then mash the milking button, but it's only got about a 30% success rate for me
---
Anyone else notice this suggestion is made once a week and always ends up upvoted like mad.  
---
Why don't we have it already?
---
Many thanks.
---
100%.   I have a home with a hole in the roof because for some reason there's an invisible piece of something in the sky at that one place where part of my roof is, overlapping with where my roof should go, preventing me from having a wholly roofed home.
---
Would love to see this fixed
---
I expected nothing less my friend
---
You have lots of other options in the control panel, though I don't think that will be the issue if you have intermittent issues.  It's still possible though, so I'd still verify the settings there.
---
Perhaps 1 point in tenderizer instead of 2. And I'd rather have blocker over bandoleer as ammo doesn't weigh all that much. Covert operative seems like it'd be good if you can fit it in somehow. Otherwise, this seems pretty solid to me.
---
8 open at mine, doors unlocked, beds, instruments, many crafting tables....
---
Just doing my part for the wasteland
---
I keed, I actually upvoted! :)
---
CAMP item placement has reverted to "going on top" again. After trying to place a new location with my tent/bed set up, the beds get placed on top. I thought we fixed all this...
---
I'd love a bloodied .38 at this point. I seem to be spending more and more time in low threat areas on account of new quests and challenges. I prefer not to waste weapon durability and ammo on unworthy enemies. My explosive .44 isn't cutting it - the rate of fire is underwhelming relative to the damage of each shot.
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
And I'll be honest, you really do sound kind of like a dick. You're right about duping being just awful, but that's exploitable because of bethesda? And if you're talking about the suspension wave from months ago (rightfully befoee I started playing) I know non dupers were also caught in that suspension. So that's just messed up. There needs to be a way to distinguish between dupers and those caught up in the mix. What needs to happen is a way to distinguish between dupers and hoarders. Things that have recipes, shouldn't be flagged or flag accounts when they are able to craft thousdands. That's absurd. However, if you have had duplicates of weapons and armor, that should be flagged instantly. Unless one star. Because that's possible. Just very unlikely. Things like serums should be flagged if they can show you haven't learned the recipes. Things like nuka colas should just be insta flagged for cap abuse. I largely agree with your sentiment. Like 95%. But I don't think it's right for those who got caught up in the mix to stay banned. Innocent players shouldn't be punished for hoarding and mass crafting. But there NEEDS to be a system implemented to tell the difference between the two. Something concrete.
---
Wow - I must be lucky then! (I do have a lot of points in Luck - does that impact the chances of the tourist showing up?) I was surprised at how quick I found the tourist and completed the quest, so maybe I just had the stars align that day.
---
Hi all,
---
Wanted to confirm that we're investigating several issues related to melee attacks, including:
---
* Initial Melee attacks against an enemy not registering.
---
* Being unable to use VATS to perform melee attacks on flying enemies.
---
* Inconsistent VATS chance to hit when trying to perform melee attacks.
---
I don't have a date to share on when fixes for this issues are coming but we are looking into addressing them with future updates. I'll be sure to let you know as soon as I have more info!
---
Xbox
---
Maybe they’re male? Idk but I got my “milk “ one way or the other lmao XD just spam the milk button it should work
---
It's called great customer service .. I call all the ones that don't cheap asses and don't buy anything ..
---
I had this happen yesterday and hitting the bumpers/getting my weapon out fixed it for me.
---
I've gone days without seeing a single 3\* drop. So 1 is still far better then none.
---
1000 is cap so just wait until the next day
---
Maybe it was me. If so it was for my 3 star furious pipe rifle with 25% faster fire rate. I like the way it sounds so I use it a lot. I finally exhausted the 10K rounds of .38 I had stored up before I got it. I use all my steel for RR spikes these days so I've been buying most of my ammo from people since vending came out.
---
I’m the op, friend.
---
Each new patch either opens up a new can or an old can of worms.

---
Yea I feel like they cant ignore it at this point. I bet they are working on it.
---
There was a [laser rifle in FO4](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Prototype_UP77_%22Limitless_Potential%22) that had it.  If I recall correctly it made it so you never had to reload your gun.  Your ammo count would still decrease, you'd just never have to go through the hassle and animation of reloading.  Keep firing until you are out of ammo.
---
Obviously for a multiplayer game, this was axed fairly early in the development process.
---
I'm finding the stuttering is bad as well.
---
Threats of a mass exodus sounds like hyperbole, and here is why; if LLW/LEW truly are rare/scarce, the number of affected players would be minimal. Therefore, removing the items from these players has minimal impact on the player base at large. It's a dick move, sure, and not one I agree with, but the number of players who would leave would be manageable.
---
If (If!) they're the new meta, and drops are disabled, there is a demand that can be filled only by duplication, which is an exploit. Uncontrolled duplication will draw attention and action from Bethesda.
---
I would suggest that one must manage expectations when it comes to build viabilities centering on a single weapon that was never intended to work the way it does. Double that if drops have been disabled in game.
---
Yes, you can turn in bad legendaries for scrip, and you then use that scrip to buy a random legendary *type* of your choice (you can choose between 1-3 stars, and melee, ranged or armor items).  
---
The effects will be random though, so still a good chance it won't be what you want.  But hey, it's an improvement.
---
Don't know if luck comes into it. Maybe that day the Interloper was smiling upon you :)
---
Like you said, they were OP
---
Yeah I totally did
---
The only thing I figure out to do was find the mirv plan for the fat man. I think it was in Watoga or Harpers ferry.
---
This so much.
---
I'm 43.  GT is CODE24
---
Central timezone.  I'm usually on very late at night.
---
Edit:  I'm currently level 72
---
The only thing that sucks about the first one is that it’ll probably never change. If you could have unconnected it would probably be unfair in some way shape or form.
---
Hmm gotcha
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Where’s the purveyor at
---
Hehe this is definitely true...
---
Yep definitely bugged.
---
Never had to leave scrip inside machine. All u have to do is a little math. In case you don't hit it. leave a multiple of 3 or 5 and hunt leg mobs. the timer resets with ur first traded item, so it does not matter when you get all scrip out, same goes with vendors.
---
Tip: hang around water. example; lakes, ponds, streams or small puddles. lol, seriously may be best to randomly select a player in world and message them. That's what I would do.
---
Just watched a video of a guy showing that this can be earned in adventure mode as well. Just like the gun last week. That should make it a little easier. Just invite every random player in the server, someone will join
---
I would say go to a fo76 trading sub. There are prices for just about everything and reddit really dictates the general prices honestly.
---
You need 2 accounts. Have to buy a 2nd copy of the game and activate it with a different email - can't have two copies linked to your main account... not because it's bad or against the rules, there just aren't any mechanics to do it. Once you have purchased the game a second time and have your 2nd set of login info:
---
1. Run the game from the Fallout 76 executable file that's in your Fallout 76 folder instead of launching through [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher. 
---
2. You'll be prompted for your account name and password in the game. Enter them, alt+tab back to your desktop.
---
3. Open the Fallout 76 executable again (having a shortcut to it linked to your desktop is obviously preferable).
---
4. You'll be prompted for your information again. Enter in your 2nd account name / password.
---
5. Add your accounts to each other's friends lists. Invite to team up. Accept on other account. Play as a team. 
---
Bam, you're now running 2x Fallout 76 with two accounts, allowing you to trade items back and forth, share perk cards, or just provide an anchor to that world if you want to nuke and then rejoin the game to respawn enemies in an area. Nuked an area for flux? Give your alts hazmat suits and each alt can collect flux from the nuke. 
---
Technically you're not doing anything that couldn't be done with a friend, so there's nothing rule breaking about it, but it's a huge advantage over playing solo, and obviously you don't have to make a friend wait on you all the time.
---
I'm in! Can we do it on survival mode to knock out part of the weekly too?
---
Serious question, of the high level 3-star drops you see (max level, not the event ones), have you seen a pipe weapon drop?  I can't remember the last time, if ever, I saw one.
---
I've gotten some (nice) 1-20 level ones from the camp event, but I don't think I've seen the queen or a max level WS ghoul drop one, or at least not for a long time.
---
Especially when they lock all 10 water purifiers they have out in the open like bruh do u really not want your customers to feel welcome
---
I don’t even know how to lock them! But enjoy! 😂
---
I would pay hefty atoms for this
---
I roleplay either as a responder or your typical  neutral armed wastelander, PS4 lobbies are wird as far as people go but I'd say you have fun the way you want to and let others do whatever.
---
More feasible to melt down and recast glass then any metal
---
It's been brought up almost daily for months now.  Someday, hopefully.
---
*nervous laughter*
---
Yeah I think this is it, ever since I got plague walker the Brahmin always turn hostile for no reason, even when I have no diseases to trigger the damage.
---
I also have my junk collector with a sign saying ‘free components’.  
---
So people get free crops, water, junk, fertilizer and maybe milk from my camp.  
---
I also occasionally drop plans and ammo by my vending machine.
---
I wear my firebreather uniform with a variety of hats as the mood takes me. Sometimes I wear my Grognak costume, but the fire breather uniform feels more role-play-y. That said, I often wear my Owl Mask too

Quite a few details there.
---
Na man I'm just new to fallout and really didn't know. All my plans are for sale now -real cheep- if ya want to visit
---
Melee and rifles too. The bug in general is back.
---
Every player might have different priorities, don't you think? In my case, I am literally one flower pot away from my 8th badge, and still I'd prefer to hold someone else's plans for a second so I can use those badges to unlock other stuff. And maybe tonight is the last chance to unlock the mod this way (**if** there is a patch incoming that will fix the glitch, but this is pure speculation on my part).
---
So, count me in if there is another PS4 unlock party tonight!
---
i don't want nice fancy pre fabbed things, i want it too look like an apocalypse happened. That being said, interior walls would be nice, and maybe make the things like wood look like an actual adult built it instead of a 10 year old.
---
Awesome idea! Although i am a low level I'd be absolutely interested in taking part in community made events or even be  part of the audience.
---
Well I’m only 43 and I’ve not done survival yet which daily exactly?
---
Never
---
No its really not. You dont have to melt down metal. You can mill out pieces you need from scrap metal. Or use a furnace to heat and reshape it. Metal is much easier to work.
---
I cant get into Lowes taxidermy at all. Says inaccessable.

This story made my day! It's just the right mix of wholesome and creepy. Thanks for sharing!

Where do you find a behemoth? I have two characters around 100 yet I've never seen one.
---
they are busy working on the game
---
That is very good to know. Thanks!
---
Immediately
---
You hit lvl 2 at exit. If you can craft a brotherhood recon rifle craft one. It can be a lvl 1 weapon and is useful for several lvls.
---
I kinda figured, I should've did a search history first. Yeah hopefully they add this soon
---
You leave the vault level 1 but can hit level 5 by just doing the first few quests.
---
Solomons pond! Down in the river is a definite spawn point for behemoths
---
I have so many questions.
---
What system are you on??
---
PS4
---
I really didn't pay attention to the fact you could lock them until they dropped player vending. I walked up to the first one and was like WTF.
---
Dear Bethesda
---
Ha! ^^^ That's a knee slapper.
---
I thought selling most plans for 50c would be fine.  
---
Then I see a guy selling them for 10. Damn.
---
I don’t know what to price them as. Is 50 too much? 10 seems a little too little... *sigh*
---
Some ghoul-like creatures. Ghouls proper are only created via radiation alone according to the fallout bible. Harold/Bob/Herbert was created through radiation and FEV
---
Nice!!! Can I add you? I'd love to stop by and check out your wares!
---
Hey there! We are aware of this and investigating it currently.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I've passed this along to the team.
---
PC - Updated to current patch - Currently cannot use raw material that are in the stash to build. Is this by design?
---
I worked this out myself the other day and it has bummed me out a bit, I think once the sub as a whole realises this shit'll kick off a bit
---
Yes, TS beats AA in damage only if the secondary effect is explosive. By itself or with another effect, AA always wins. Also keep in mind that Two-shot significantly lowers recoil control and accuracy, but also adds another proc chance to effects like 9% chance to stagger, etc...
---
Amen.
---
Was trying to build my old camp design on a different character, and whenever I tried to place a top arch on a half wall, I kept getting the message 'Object floating' even though on my end it was marked green. Even tried relogging, relocating, and starting over from scratch several times.
---
This is just outright infuriating sometimes.
---
I had to give up and just make a simple workstation platform.
---
I got stuck... I don't even know. Inside a pen? I have absolutely no idea what the architect had in mind. Basically a bunch of random foundations and fences forming a ring. Absolutely nothing of note inside.
---
After the realisation that I'd have to partially burn a fusion core to fly out, I fast travelled home. Not sure if that was the plan all along? The shop did have goods...

 &gt; Hey there! We are aware of this and investigating it currently.
---
I can tell you that you do more damage by bouncing the Tesla rifle off the ground than hitting enemies directly, which is annoying.
---
Where I come from we call that planting evidence.
---
Not to worry, it's almost 100% certain that it was a duped mask (they're that rare), but it's unlikely that Bethesda would do anything to you about it, short of deleting it with all the other copies someone made.  IMO, enjoy it while you can, but most likely you'll always have it.
---
Rng hates me and I have had two, so probably not too rare.
---
But it's part of the weekly survival challenge to earn the 3-star legendary revolutionary sword.
---
I agree. I picked a place in the savage divide lower third because it was perfect for my 2 buildings and 1 cap fast travel to the R&amp;N station. It not a high traffic area, but I spent HOURS building that camp, with little time consuming tricks to get things I wanted. I can't be asked to blueprint and move.
---
I have 22k caps at the moment so I hope someone low level comes along and gets a nice surpise.
---
Not only this but we need a better system for making sure any time we place our camps we aren't in another player's area even on another world because this logging in and getting told I have to move my camp because someone else's camp is already in place is getting old. It is even worse when you go to that spot and they have nothing there but their camp item itself.
---
I remember when you posted the concept for this. Looks like it came out great! Very cool, thanks for sharing an update.
---
Same things with the legendary exchange machines.
---
They're at the end of the database, so they load after everything else has loaded.  We see the same thing with the legendary vending machines and a lot of other things that were added recently.
---
Oh ok  I've never seen them because I've never been there, thanks!

It was horrible today. Everything was setting it off, and hits were odd in general.  And unlike ever before, sometimes guns started working without reloging.

I hope many, like myself, will take this opportunity to do some number crunching on an admitted small sample size.  I’ve always found it fun to crunch “random” numbers.

For instance many have stated here, taking 100+ sample size, that what you carry impacts what you get.  3 of my characters specialize in a certain armor type (vanguard, weightless, and unyielding) so i am anxious to see how their first 20 armor rolls go, with the added effort of ditching in some way the armor I do get that doesn’t match their style between rolls.
---
Power armour placed through the door should do it. I'll raise your poop with a soiled propaganda flyer
---
L2 When it’s selected I believe lol u can also lock terminals and anything with a door on it I think
---
New Inside the Vault tomorrow with some details on the upcoming Project Paradise event. Stay tuned!
---
CMs aren't developers, so no not really.
---
Not sure why they come and go, I'll have to ask next time I have a chance.  I assume they have a few other things on their plates besides Rediit.
---
I dont see how its our camp if its inaccessible to other players thats not an issues
---
Yep, I ignored them for almost a month at launch, assuming they had too much of a negative affect. Boy was  I wrong. Mutations absolutely make my character what it is.
---
True, no Wrapped Cap.

 &gt; New Inside the Vault tomorrow with some details on the upcoming Project Paradise event. Stay tuned!
---
Oh, I wasn't expecting a reply. Thanks!
---
i got this last weekend too. i cant place walls behind stairs on the upper level where there’s a gap. same with the roof! i wish they’d clean up the system so it was more like FO4
---
Last night my 4 full vending machines magically unloaded themselves back into stash. Now I have to refill/reprice everything. Really not up for that, especially not knowing if it can happen again.
---
im creating a group for players, would you be interested?
---
I literally have the opposite of this problem. All you have to do (literally) is set up your vending machine. If you sell those weapons for a few hundred to a thousand caps (depending on the effects) they will sell. Put all your extra plans in there and mark them half the in game value, as long as they are common plans, and they will sell all day! I ground up my limit of a thousand scrip but if I’m at a persons camp and they have cheap legendaries, I buy them for the scrapper! So I know there are tons of people like me out there because there has been nothing to grab from the robot vendors. If you do simple shot like that you will be at max caps fast!!! You just have to put a little elbow grease into it and it will pay off.
---
This. I had stopped doing it because lol lvl 40 legendaries, but now I do it just for the steel and scrip.
---
Yes but I've noticed the hardened lever action is still 2 points off damage higher (using all single shot rifleman perks as well as bloody mess and both are two shot) and that bothers me. I'd gladly sacrifice fire rate for a heavy hitter.
---
Lol. I left the “I’m watching you” note outside 76 and waited.  
---
Someone showed up, looked in the bag, and I immediately went to snapping photos of them.
---
Don’t forget the IOU toilet paper + smokes.  
---
I like to collect singular cigarettes and some packs for that one.
---
ok then..
---
formulating excuses...
---
It should be fine now that vertibird power leveling is nerfed.
---
Really?! It's seriously not prioritised or sorted or anything? Genuinely didn't think it would be that simple but it's Bethesda so I can believe it
---
I actually run into more melee guys one hitting stuff in the wild. Honestly though, the problem isn't the weapon it's the a-hole wielding it.
---
I thought certain perk cards only dropped at certain levels
---
Ahhh, I see
---
I've had this happen at the tattoo parlor. Door is just a piece of wood with no interactable door. Then it finally loads in and I can go inside.
---
“Corn?! I didn’t have corn!”
---
I wish they would make crops not float and make it look uniform with the ground. I keep having my corn at the same level float a foot off the ground. It's driving me crazy.
---
Also the crops keep saying that it interferes with another crop or object that is somehow nowhere near it.
---
I'd like to see Vault Tec styled stuff that is CLEAN and NEW looking.
---
Not sure if it's the same problem OP is describing, but there's also a glitch that occurs when attempting to put roofs over stairs in camps. The system just won't put a roof above a set of stairs, but if you put the roof down first and then the stairwell, it works.
---
A lot of people on there circle jerk how bad 76 is. I actually did post it on there
---
I do like the sound of that
---
And how can you do that if you just came out of the Vault?
---
Census violence and surface to air may drop as well I believe
---
id like this with BOS, im not a huge vault tec fan but see the merit for sure.
---
This happened to me with the sheepdquatch, good thing  I got like one shot in so I got loot
---
Yeah I had this last night. I spent 6 hours building a new camp, and at least 3 of those hours were finding ways to work around the glitches.
---
Here's the list of 973249 game assets, put them in the order you like, and we'll get right on that.
---
Seriously, it's not surprising.  I'm sure there is some prioritization, but there no way to get it perfect.
---
I am 45 from the UK
---
Play when I get a chance away from the wife
---
Level 85 
---
GT   Justjuniorboy
---
Thank you for information!
---
.w.
---
caw caw
---
Do you still can help?
---
Yeah its 99% not going to be that as it's the only thing I have problems with but your right il give it a whirl anyway
---
I’ve run into 0% vats on enemies who are just standing on the other side of a railing. I have to walk around it and be right on top of them before it turns to 95%, all the while I’m taking hits. It’s annoying as hell but not game-breaking
---
im making a roleplay group. you dont have to roleplay, you can just join if you want a group. but the roleplay is for enclave and raiders
---
Certain ones unlock at a set level, but you can choose them any level up after that.
---
I've been having this trouble, as well as trying to attach wires. Sometimes when I go to attach them, they won't although it's green, and I'll just jump instead of attaching them. I'll have to exit out of crafting completely in order to attach a wire, and it happens every other other time.
---
thank you very much!!!
---
Which brings us back to the beginning.  Which class is it?
---
Probably hasnt been solved yet
---
gotcha, it does look pretty great!
---
Watoga vendor, BoS pretty sure, has the plan.
---
I read you can buy the mod at one but I'm guessing that was confusion between mod/plan nomenclature. I hopped a few times to see if a mod would show with no luck. 
---
Which sucks, means you need Gunsmith 5. Grinded 4 levels just to get that card ranked up &amp; another to rank 3 for my build (had one from a card pack in waiting).
---
Go to watoga. 3 lvl 24 assaultrons around to the west. They're never easy
---
I think I tried snapping everything vaguely bone-like in the Maw, nothing either ID'd in the viewfinder as fossil or counted towards the merit badge.  Hoping to pick up the stupid tinfoil hat in Berkley to make myself more enticing bait to the evil alter-ego of my mysterious prophet Wise Mothman on my way to that cave to document archeological findings.
---
Yeah I dislike this aswell. I can pretty much 1 hit anything with my Instigating Grog Axe w/40% power damage. But I follow etiquitte and use a less powerful rifle to tag enemies when there's other players.
---
One shotting happens a lot a WS. If they one shot enemies on me I'll cut them off and B-line to the next heavy spawn point and leave a trail of unlooted 1 shotted ghouls in my path. I'll back track to get loot just to get my point accross. There's no reason we can't share.
---
im not going to down vote cause i see your point. i like jumping cause i feel like a ninja. thats all.
---
yeah i dont get that anyway, so what if i make part of my base inaccessible. Its a shack in the middle of the swamp  not some quest place that players need to constantly traverse
---
I second this idea. We need green houses, planters, and terrain tools. Hell make it where you can mold your camps location with a shovel and pickaxe so that you can be a landscaper and gardener. It would be awesome to make our camp look like a mini Whitesprings resort.
---
Ooo good to know thx
---
The launch boards have been bugging out since the patch, it might take a bit longer to get the codes if they're not up already
---
Even Bethesda had to respond to this heartwarming stalker story.
---
You need a carrot. Something to dangle in from of you and chase. That works for me. I'm trying to create as close a character to an NCR ranger including my camp and a crimson caravan vending area. Try to create what you envision your character to be and go for it.
---
No doubt, me too. Sold a 2* western explosive handgun for 200 caps. Feel like I set the bar too low. Was just happy to help someone out.
---
Oh I’m doing it for the tadpole badge
---
Ah I assumed we would find this all out tommorow, when was all this announced?
---
Doh I think il struggle getting all that scrip for just one roll
---
The term altruistic stalker is confusing.
---
Yes, I'm crashing more for sure.
---
There may be alot more people willing to accept team invites now that it cant be used to allow griefers to find your camp and destroy it.
---
I have a note called "I miss you, Dad" selling for 10000 caps. First ever person who asked me was ny first customer. Havent been asked since.
---
"Ok everyone a nice orderly line... one at a time please... HardCoReGam3rXXX stop shooting people please... wait your turn..."
---
I'm just sayin I hope there are multiple windows like in the enclave bunker
---
There will be one in the observatory. It's illustrated on the map. 
---
Also might be one in Beckley or Berkley, whatever the non-spring one is. I heard it once, it was rare but I never seen it. Just heard it speaking.
---
Maybe itll be something like division's BR.
---
I agree I run a melee build but my quick swap weapon is always my Vampire SMG there is no reason to one shot everything when other players are around.... unless they start it and you want to prove a point about sharing.....
---
That I don't know. I asked as well in a separate comment. There is [another person](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bowghf/psaconspiracy_suit_is_under_armor/enma64m/?context=3) asserting that all Atom Shop under armors are using the Causal category, albeit unintentionally.
---
Oh... Thank you! :)
---
What platform u on?i can go with you for a couple hours farming mobs,you tag i finish.xbox
---
When you collect your perk cards you get enough XP to level up.
---
Same bonuses stack additively, but when stacking with other bonuses, it's multiplicative. With both Assassin and Sentinel you have (1-.25\*.6) = .85 = 85% damage resistance from players. This alone was never enough to be unkillable, it only gets to that point once you start adding perks like Lone Wanderer and Dodgy as well as factoring in DR.
---
It sure looks nice, but why stimpak of all things?
---
The end game is grinding the big spots for legendaries, and any personal goals you set for yourself.
---
Whitesprings, West Tek, Harpers Ferry for legendaries
---
Personally, I've been making and scrapping Gauss Rifles to try an unlock the suppressor, RNG has not been kind.
---
Around 20ish scrapped at this point
---
I couldn’t find any and my guns arent up to scratch
---
Is there any way we can make minor adjustments to the camp location without removing the structures? Like if we're off by just a little we can slide it over a bit as long as everything we already built is still within the circle?
---
Good lookin out, man. Unfortunately (in this instance) I’m on PS4
---
Know of any good routes for consistent events?
---
My guns aren’t up to scratch
---
heh, mines listed at 22222.  I got it on about my tenth try, I was dumbfounded after never getting one in about 300 hours of fo4 and can't bear to eat it myself.
---
With the right setup and strategy, I take out mirelurk queens out in one hit. But catch me off guard while in power armor? Time to spam the stimpaks.
---
Harvest plants. Let plants rot. Go to chemistry work bench and convert it to fertilizer. Rotten meat, fruit, and vegetables all convert 10:1 to fertilizer.
---
Ok goodluck
---
Yep. I sell em for 50 caps apiece.
---
Same thing started happening to me after the last patch. For me, it was usually the stairs causing the issue (even if it was foundation pieces and no second level). I found that removing or adding a second set of stairs fixed the problem.
---
I'm not even sure they **need** to be powered, as I've encountered machines in people's camps that were not hooked up and unlighted, but I could still purchase from them just fine.
---
If that is intended behaviour, you only need to power a machine if you want your camp on the map, and can build a speakeasy style hidden shop that players have to find on their own. I like that idea.
---
I’ll give this a go. Thanks for the advice
---
Just launch a nuke at something that isn’t a fissure site and you’ll find the holotape at site alpha
---
I launched the nuke a few days ago, could I still collect the holotape now?
---
Damn. Mine was my first 1 ever
---
You can oversell it when you get to your 1000 cap. It effectively amounts to the same thing in the end.
---
it’s not a gaming laptop, just a regular (fairly new) HP laptop but it had been running the game just fine for months and only started having problems a few weeks ago. 
---
someone suggested cleaning up all of the dust as well so i’ll probably try that, didnt think of it at first but it seems to be the quickest option to try out. thanks
---
Practically my entire shop contains items marked below 1000 caps. About 13 different weapons and pieces of armor. I'm surprised none of it sells. I've even got a level 35 bloodied dragon on sale for 600 caps.
---
alright, tactics is during 2197/8
---
Also, black powder rifles clip through the floor when reloading whilst crouching. I gather it's because it's the same as the standing animation, but damn... These things were loaded whilst kneeling more commonly than standing. Kills my immersion!
---
the traps trigger even if you aren't hostile?
---
Where abouts is your camp?
---
It's a chemical weapon sign.
---
Doing lower level events is what i did to gain levels.  Also doing hord events all over map guarantees getting a low level 3* enemy to spawn, ive gotten some pretty good low level loot from them.  Got a lvl 10 explosive pipe rifle for my low level character the other day. Also another good event is  Uranium fever. A little harder then the hord events but also guarantees a lower lvl 3 star enemy sometimes 3 3* enemy's.  I also find that if someone is already in an event join on them help with what you can and receive the benefits of them doing most of the work lol. Gotta do what you can to get those levels up.
---
Get down on them knees
---
I'm getting that quite a lot and weather is snapping in and out also, quite psychedelic. The ground textures do sometimes snap on correctly if I watch for long enough. Must be something to do with server lad and my game client just can't pull in the texture files fast enough.
---
Makes me wonder of the huge 50+GB download are we also constantly downloading stuff from the server, I'd have thought all the textures reside in the game /Data folder or on within the console cache, why then doesn't everything load immediately?
---
It’s just in workshops that you can PVP. if you put pacifist mode on, outside the workshops you won’t get killed.
---
And this is why we probably won't be able to place decorative items anywhere in our camps and will instead get item cases when those come out
---
View the bots history 6 replies in the last hour alone the mods are very active. And more than I can count prior to that. You're imagining the inactivity.
---
Or two left hands?
---
Sure!
---
Only when a nuke zone is active
---
If you have explosive legendarys it's a must. otherwise maybe not it's up to you I have it at rank 4 so I can pretty much craft all the weapon mods and so I don't have to fix my weapons as much
---
Proof that this game is all running within the matrix.
---
Thanks - good to know!
---
If I can make a manportable cold fusion reactor at a tinkerer's workbench, I can make a sheet of glass
---
Yea, it works for all sorts. We can even do it standing in water to help with the Swimmer Scout World Challenge.
---
If Bethesda isn't scared of a mass exodus why did they grandfather them in the first place?
---
Can that nuke zone be someone else's or do I have to launch a nuke myself again just to get the holotape?
---
Sometimes when a crop needs repair, it is practically invisible and yet magically takes up the same amount of space as when it was healthy. This may not be your issue but it’s worth checking out.
---
Yes it can be someone else’s luckily enough as that’s how I obtained my copy of the holotape
---
Great idea
---
You say that but 300 stims at 10 each rarely sell :p
---
Had a hard time selling serums for 400 too
---
Lmao okay good point
---
I ninja harvested someone's crops last night as compensation for my fast travel fee. Money totally grows on trees.
---
I've been looking for unowned plans I'll eventually head back to quest and try to find that pesky camera and earn some badges.
---
Ok I'll be sure to carry a level one pipe rifle with me at all times just for you guys....
---
Okay thank you very much, I've been looking for this everywhere
---
I recently ran into four Super Mutant Overloads taking on a Legendary Albino Deathclaw. It took some time, but the deathclaw reigned supreme. At least until I sniped him from the nearby ridge after watching the battle. He only had a lame 1* melee anyway.
---
only thing i want floating is my house not my food lol
---
Only if the sound effect it plays when you hit a target is "HES HACKIN N WHACKIN N SMACKIN'"
---
I use explosive shotguns and started using gunsmith lvl2. I can't see that much difference, so i will unequip it again.
---
Lol me too.  But after a really bad attempt on the SBQ I was doubting it did.  I was unloading thousands of rounds into her and she still was having her way with a good chunk of the players trying to kill her.  The 20% debuff should have been up every time she hit the ground.  I mean I know a large percentage of the player base is woefully under geared but it was a blood bath.  Reminded me of the first week Encryptid was up it was so bad.
---
Just a quick heads up if you stand inside the elevator without going down, the holotape will appear in a case directly opposite the shaft doors on the rusted shelf at Site Alpha or close to the case
---
I miss my bear 😢
---
My purifiers are right next to my vending machines with “FREE” on some of them. If they’re out, I do sell some for a modest price. Someone bought a bunch the other day.
---
You could try blue printing it
---
It was a quest reward ..enjoy it!
---
Avoid taking workshops in general until high level. Since the PvP in adventure is so restricted and PvP mode is full of people their own size so the griefers go after workshops as a way to initiate.
---
Ooookay.
---
So as a software house they should know that database keying is an important thing if you have prioritised searches
---
Hmm that's strange
---
Do you have Stairs under the area you are attempting to place a roof on?  The metal stairs got a new collision mesh in the last major patch.  You can place a roof and then add stairs under it (as in 1st to 2nd floor stairs, and a roof on the 2nd story).  However, placing stairs and then a roof over them collides.
---
I add issues adding walls with electric doors in them when I had a wall above them.  In other words I built my second story walls before my first floor walls.  Adding the lower walls first fixed this issue.
---
If you are on PC I would be happy to help craft a building with you.  MorganLock
---
Yea but my Yao Gui glitches into 3 when I first load into the server at my camp. Which is probably cuz my internet sucks so bad.
---
Also try jiggling the cable.
---
Literally. I found out that when my wires wouldn't attach, it was because the reticle wasn't actually true to where the contact point was, which was way to the right and up of the reticle. Moving the power line around revealed where it really was.
---
If you’re on Xbox and need any help my GT is Bekbekk94
---
Oh nvm I’ll keep it in mind
---
I read it as if he were a rad roach with a top hat and wedding ring.
---
Thanks. Will bear that in mind as well. Just glad to know it actually works.
---
Does this only affect VATS melee? I haven't noticed any issues but I don't use VATS
---
Start farming uranium fever like another said. It's guaranteed to spawn three 3* enemies every time. Take your legendaries, also picking up all scrap, glowing meat, and weapons and ammo off of the mole miners (you'll get a metric fuckton).
---
Walk that down the road to whitespring station, exchange your legendaries for scrip at the machine. Sell your glowing meat and weapons at the vendor there.
---
Then head over to whitesprings and wander around, killing all the enemies there. There's usually a few legendaries floating around. Go to the train station and repeat the steps from above. Boom there's your farming for the day.
---
Go off and just do your thing, doing a quest or completing challenges.
---
Give it a couple days and you'll be set with caps and scrip and gear.
---
Hiya, I am sure that many more people will add useful stuff to the thread, but here's a couple of bits....
---
- The game should NOT pan out like that. Unfortunately you encountered one of our (relatively) few griefers. Ignore them and move on. You'll meet far more nice people who will help you than arsebiscuits like the specimen who ruined your gameplay.
---
Having said this, you may find that workshops might need a few more levels before they're worth your time. Player attacks like this are not terribly common, but can happen - best if you have a chance to at least escape.
---
- Don't stress about meta builds and min-maxing. Go for quality of life and what feels right. I do advise levelling up both your chosen weapon skill (rifle, melee, shotgun, whatever) and your weapon as you can, but don't expect to have any fun with the "uber" builds from Youtube without seriously specialised (and very rare) gear.
---
- Power armor is likely to be your friend for a long time. While top-end legendary armor can outclass it in many instances, you'll be a while getting a suit like that together. PA does just about everything well and allows for lots of quality of life perks (carry weight perks!).
---
- Take your time! There is no NEED to level quickly or see everything in one day. It's a big map, levelling comes by itself, and you'll have much more fun by chilling. When you start to get into end game (post 50), there are several levelling spots that will help you if you find you need it, but there's no real difference between a level 50 with all their perk cards in place, and a level 350 with the same ones. The higher level will probably have good gear, acquired over time, but you can do that too. Just don't rush to it - you'll miss most of the fun content and the grind can be boring.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I used to do the workshops all the time and still do occasionally. In my experience, someone initiating PvP in workshops is pretty rare. I think you just ran into a jerk, so don't let that discourage you from doing the workshops. Most players lvl 100+ (including myself) are looking to help out lower lvl players. That being said, I wouldn't focus on workshops too much when just starting out. My best advice would be scrap, scrap, scrap. Collect any and all junk until you're at least lvl 10. Will save you some headache later on.
---
You're a saint, thank you! Ill finally be able to not sleep ever again.
---
Anyone have any idea how to get through the locked door at Eden Space Centre, have seen you can get through from someone’s collection video on YouTube but no idea how to get through.
---
Id just lock my air lock style door system... keeps the riff raff out of the olde drug shack
---
Anyone feel like this going to be a part of the legendary dwellers update? With micro transactions for a 4th and 5th loadout?
---
That's the golden mean of F76 ;)
---
Whats the weapon? I got the resolute veteran or whatever (the gatling) sunday
---
It is not a must in any way
---
Stims are so so easy to get. You're better off selling to vendors. 
---
Serums I usually see for 200 to 300 caps. Someone was selling them for 15k on a server I was on and I died laughing. The serum not the recipe.
---
If you need any help and are on Xbox my GT is Bekbekk94
---
You took that so far out of context it's crazy.
---
Obviously anyone who was accidentally banned should be allowed to play. I never stated otherwise.
---
I know tons of of people who were hoarders and they only had their items reset to 1 (if you had 25 TSE shotguns, you'd log in post patch to just 1) and didn't get banned, and I believe the small percentage that got caught up in the wave is just that. A small percentage. Most of those caught were in fact duping
---
I have mine at the foot of my bed just fine.
---
On the topic of ethnic haircuts...I'd like to put in a vote for long braids for dudes, too, please.
---
Leather coat with the shovel backpack and the nukashine hat
---
A lot of content has been added but the basic principles of the game aren't going to change. If you didn't like it then, chances are you won't like it now.
---
Same but I would love to have my character cuddle it while she slept
---
The lead deposit North-northeast of Fissure Prime?
---
They changed the deathclaw from being affected by animal friend to wasteland whisperer.
---
I sell most of my one stars, only good prefixes for 200 to 250. 2 star I'll do 300 to 350 depending on prefix. 3star is 500 to 1k depending on the enhancements. 
---
Most of my plans are 25 or 50 caps unless its ultra rare. 
---
I just want stuff gone.
---
Furious Chinese officer sword w swing speed and +1 something I forget it's actually good
---
I'll make my own Whitesprings resort....with blackjack and hookers.
---
Thanks! I really appreciate all that
---
I have it at rank 5 and equipped all the time. It’s a shame it’s so vital, but without it everything seems to break in minutes.
---
iirc Crops are instanced to the player. The owner can still harvest them even if you did.
---
Hey bro you think you can make me a helmet?
---
You're probably right
---
Dreads would be awesome also big afros with a pick.
---
This might be unpopular opinion but....
---
....there's almost zero difference. Some small numerical variance that in no way equates to you taking one more bullet before you die.
---
Go for the one you think looks best :)
---
I mean at 200-300 your better off selling to venders for the trouble thats required to make them youd make 400 caps per. 
---
Selling at 400 is still tech a loss on my end lmao  cheapest ive seen on the ps4 is running at 550 or 670 but hey maybe you have struck some gold. Buy em up and profit on the caps.
---
Thanks - yeah I've been scrapping everything I come across!
---
yeah my tse lever is good for like 30 shots without it on I think that was the real penalty when they did the nerf a tse degrades obscenely fast without that perk card.
---
I’d love to build my house, and then scoot it a bit when I’m done
---
Thanks - I'm on PC
---
Na better perks can take its place
---
They should just patch the game lmao
---
I forgot exactly what item I was trying to place down but it told me the item I wanted to place didn’t exist or something. 
---
It threw me for a metaphysical loop as I was staring at the item which was was green, indicating I could place it
---
Start with [the roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019), then scroll down and read all the inside the vaults and patch notes. You'll be able to catch up on everything that is new/has been changed. It's too much for any person to post for you.
---
That doesn’t really mean a lot anymore. You guys said that about people randomly losing all of their photos and yet it happened to me just a few days ago.
---
Looks like the strip has relocated. Where is House at?
---
I also heard that XO1 has more mods, is that true?
---
Sounds definitely like an existential crisis :)
---
I think you got your carrot, it's just you feel you're never going to get it on that damn stick. 
---
Yeah grind Wes-Tek and WS (Harper's isn't reliable enough for me) 
---
Free range seems to always start over by southern belle. Nobody shows anymore but if you get to the end and fail you still get a legendary sheepsquatch. 
---
Gear up for a nuke zone. They aren't as frequent but might as well be ready for when one drops.

Go shopping. To get better loot you need better loot. You might not be able to afford the latest meme weapon and armor but you should be able to get a 1 or 2* that's ok. Always check WS vendors. It might not be as common as in the past but lots of players unload legendaries that they've got grinding ghouls. A lot of players can't be bothered scripping 1 or 2* and just sell them.
---
If you bagged the item 2 weeks ago because it worth nothing,  its still worth nothing.
---
There really needs to be more drawbacks for these mutations. These people are not human any longer.
---
Or floating.
---
Amen
---
They will also have to fix the issue with the C.A.M.P.s taking so long to load for this to work otherwise you'll just fall through the floor the mat is placed on. My C.A.M.P. takes at least a minute to fully load in.
---
I wipe them out everyday at lvl 150. Glowing blood and glowing meat steaks as well as assault rifles are my go to sale items and if I don’t have enough I’ll sell chems, purified water, or craft marine tactical helmets if I get really desperate. Also sell any raw flux you can’t stabilize ASAP because they expire quickly
---
Definitely was. I still have nightmares about whatever that item was
---
Well, say you had a house that was on stilts instead of stairs. Only people who can get to it are those with a marsupial mutation, so “raiders” and melee enemies can’t attack you.
---
But since the destruction of objects doesn’t affect anything around it, say one of those “raiders” or enemies went to attack your stilts? They could take those stilts out and your house would be fine, making it the “raiders” still have no access to your building, and enemies have no other way to attack your base.
---
It’d be unfair in the respect that you’d basically have a floating base until you fix those stilts (which at that point you wouldn’t).
---
Yeah I thought it was the game, was stuck for sometimes 10-15 seconds at the queen. My friend said he had no issues so started looking at the hardware. I have 32 gigs of ram, no issues encoding h.264/265 hours on end, it wasn't stable enough for fo76 go figure! Memtest86 will show you the truth though, it's good at catching bad ram
---
And drills...don't forget the real mvp
---
Well it has a recon helmet while I don't think other sets have it.
---
i love you
---
I miss the gambling aspect I was always evil against the legion so I'd just collect their currency then gamble it away.
---
Not that I disagree with anything in this thread, but be careful for your wishes friends, Bethesda sees too much of these and Fallout 5 will turn into a sandbox building game.
---
Get a tesla rifle and call it a day.
---
I am not really that up to date on moods that other models may not have to be honest. As far as I know all types have Calibrated Shocks (legs - carry weight) which are pretty much the only option ever used.
---
I do wear X-01 so I can also confirm that Jetpack (chest), emergency protocols (chest) and targetting HUD (helmet) are available for that type. Perhaps someone with more specific knowledge could let us both know if the others are missing any of those options.
---
I dont know the Scorchbeast scream wasnt doing squat to the Sheepsquatch and its Spines didnt seem to be hitting the SB. It landed once and again didnt seem to do much. I quickly killed the SB then the sheep took a fair bit longer and more ammo
---
As an alternate, could we please make it an option to wear some armor over top of some of the Outfits? I want to put my mix of leathet and combat armor on over my golf outfit.
---
Workshops are good if you want plans for things to build at your camp, my advice at low levels is to clear them, claim them, get the plans and the leave. That said, most of the plans you get from them are available cheaply in the player vendor machines. So you don’t even need them for that.
---
I mean you can just shoot your old one around for a bit than repair it
---
One of the downsides of legendary weapons being in the game, is there will always be some broken combo that kills something in seconds.
---
This is why I'm a proponent of certain events temporarily disabling legendary effects to put everybody on an even ground.
---
I don’t understand the reference, but really excited to start a healer build. I have a medics handmade also :)
---
I’ve shot all the 50 things for the quest and because it’s repaired to more than 100% it’s just tedious.
---
I used to have this issue on my old PC. At one point I tried changing ugridstoload=5 in the ini to ugridstoload=3. This made everything in the distance look ugly but load better.
---
I happen to have one in my inventory you can have GT aGraciousGod
---
So I can set traps in a CAMP and kill players fast traveling in thinking they get to buy something?
---
Actually, YES. Please do this. I can have this going on while I kite fast travel spawned enemies into CAMPS to destroy them :)
---
I have been killed more times by the Yao Gui than any other enemies lol That initial hit they do is fierce! One time I was in fight with two glowing ones and killed one, the second just went off on me. I don't like them!
---
I guess you could just put it off and use it as your go-to-weapon for a bit and forget about it until you repair it out of habit🤷‍♂️
---
And say Fallout 76 is a lot better than NV in all aspects...
---
The game plays is mostly the same. Bobby pins weight a lot less. Player vendors can be pretty awesome for new characters. Morgantown Airport feels very different.
---
Craft a low level one. Bash enemies at Flatwoods then repair. Did this challenge in 35 mins, all 5.
---
It depends on what else you'd rather have in that slot. At least 5 INT is a good idea in general for people to swap around the various crafting perks, but if you're not always using power armor there aren't a whole lot of perks to fill that space for exploration and combat.
---
I’ve added you :) it won’t let me join your game though
---
Been finding quad ,two shot and other various mixes of pipe guns these days on my farming excursions
---
This has been the case since the nukashine update, maybe before that too, every new item loads much later than other objects.
---
Hope this can be fixed at some point.
---
You probably have but might as well ask - updated GPU and everything else?
---
Bunch of posts on this. I wrote one along with several others. In short they do not drop from deathclaws currently and can be found as random loot in super mutant blood bags and other animals on rare occasions.
---
Because this "mass exodus" isn't real. It's confirmation bias. Remember repair kits? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
More to the point, IIRC, they were/are considering another balance pass later™, and possibly re-enabling the drops. It then follows that they would not remove the existing items; why remove them if you plan to bring them back?
---
Most likely outcome (read: guess) is that these weapons behavior will eventually be altered in a balance pass unless a new meta arises. I would have a backup plan in place for my build, if it were reliant on this one specific weapon. Just in case.
---
Are Sheepsquaches really a problem?  I don't have a crazy build or anything and I slaughtered 3 high leveled squaches that spawned on me all at once.  Had 4 high level SB's at once and just made a bat graveyard out of them. The only thing in the game that challenges for real is the imposter.  I fail going toe to toe with that evil robot.  I wish they were a random spawn in the world.  That thing slaps me around like a toy.
---
My camp is on a cliff. I'm considering putting up a sign that says "I'll jump off this cliff for 20 caps. Get your backpacks here!"
---
did that yesterday with grenades/mines.. bought em for 1-2
---
sold for 4-5 lol
---
T-51 best for overall gameplay (best physical and energy res + cheap to repair), X-01 for nukezones (best rad res and almost identical energy res as T-51)
---

---
Little outdated info on mods part but armor stats still hold.
---
And that’s why I keep them at my camp.
---
And I definitely agree, not even with two missile turrets firing at a high level one is it easy too kill one of them.
---
FYI, they are quest items that can't be dropped or traded.
---
43 and on xbox 1.  Goblinite is the name.  Look me up.

People could already do it with the steel letters if they really wanted to.

You cant. Youd have to gift it to him from another character.

Mine are right by the overseers camp. Figured the fresh out of the vault types need a hand. :)

I actually found a post that didn't get 50 down votes. You have my support and upvotes.
---
I think he's thinking you have your own account and were going to meet him. Sounds as though that's not the case. Not much you can do. You come out of the vault knowing how to craft light leather armor but since that is an early mission objective it's a tad redundant. 
---
You might be able to find some power armor chassis for him to use. Grab some fusion cores, maybe find some scoped hunting rifles or farm some stimpacs.
---
Thinking of Fallout 4 and all the great cosmetic mods, ethnic hairstyles and clothing would be a great addition to the game.
---
If I can't find a place high place to jump and snipe them, I run lol
---
i was able to get my fuzzy uniform with just north of 200 tokens, twice
---
They should just assign a secret id value to each item, if more than one of those exists delete it.
---
But you know what, Bethesda devs aren't stupid. They've probably already thought about it, and realised why it doesn't work due to engine reasons we don't know about.
---
dont trade with grushnak

Lol, do u often get away cuz they always catch up to me.

In the meantime there’s a one near a cliff you can build into
---
I'm on PS4 can't help, but just curious how you're gonna nuke Sheperdstown?  Just NE mire?
---
Cheers for openly admitting that, none of us is perfect :)
---
I put my camp in a low level area. All three purifiers are unlocked and everything is out in the open. No doors and only a handful of walls. Anyone is welcome to come and use whatever they need and that includes the crops out front. Not to mention all my stuff in the vendor is marked down in price so those same low level people can afford some health or plans for their own camps.
---
I started fiddling around with memory and found out the issue. It wasn't the mem sticks thou. It was limited page file. I had it limited to few gigs (min 2, max 8), but FO76 demands at least 14-16GB. Almost butter smooth gameplay now :O
---
So it was a typical PEBKAC case :D
---
Unfortunately never ending possible not existing in fo76 we will have to do with quad
---
I just had this exact problem and was able to put down the dumb looking roof with one corner open somehow.

I was also able to put a roof ontop of my other roof so who knows

If they added like, a grow box to build, thats alll nice and flat, id be ok with that... I need shit straight and even dag nabbit
---
I have gunsmith one on just cause I have an extra slot but normally it isn’t all that important tbh
---
Stack em high, sell em cheap, obviously works.
---
I'm like run forest run lol I'm literally blazing away from them. I usually can find something to jump on and kill them. But if I see them in the distance I will go the other way.
---
Too add to your letter. I also wish the camp boundaries were a square instead of a circle.. seeing as thats the shape were limited to building.
---
Dunno if this is related, but I also can't remove any floors in my CAMP. Every time i try, it says part of the structure would be inaccessible, even if I try removing a piece on the edge with nothing on it.
---
was his name watson on ps4?
---
Also I can't move my hero of the wasteland statue or delete it. Just says "this item is currently in use"
---
Someone already got you one, but I was gonna say you could go to the Palace. Once you spawn, go into the parking lot, turn left, go past the little shooting range spot and all the way to the back-left there’s a couple targets with bolts in them. Across from that there’s a table that spawns a crossbow (that may or may not be there when you get there)
---
Have it at max rank lvl5 and it’s a must have if your a gun user
---
Holy shit! 2 minutes! Try fucking rust......
---
You're right. I overlooked that.
---
Only the largest, most populated, totalitarian country on earth could effectively implement this.... hint starts with "C" and has fuckin cameras everywhere.
---
You're over a stair
---
When I checked it last was loading endlessly, thus the question.
---
Gulpers and behemoths specifically, to wit.
---
Only have the cards on that you use all time then switch it around when your modding or making ammo picking locks etc
---
message someone on your world if they'd like to trade.
---
also could ask if they'd want to trade for the swimming challenge, too.
---
I’m in danger!
---
True, I'll tell them to load the new speaker boxes and de-prioritize...the bridge.  THAT should be fun ;-)
---
Your map is a bit hard to understand and read. The colors that are the same colors (blue, green, etc) are hard to distinguish from each other.
---
To the people saying "Hur dur get better guns", this isn't cause we lose a kill, its cause if we cant get a single shot in we get no loot from it, its just having courtesy for your other wastelanders who are also trying to get legendary loot, you one hitting it takes away all the chances of a legendary drop from that enemy for anyone else
---
I've also had it say "no object selected" lately. Obviously there's an object selected if I'm attempting to place it.
---
Where are we getting these nice new walls from?
---
I'ma try that I do really think getting some gear will get me motivated to go further. I thought I was too low level to see the benefits of scrips but I'll give it a try ! Farming currencies is something appealing to me
---
I'll laugh until I cry when I pay 100 scrip and get handed a drill.  XD
---
I would be happier with circular fortress walls like in fallout 4 myself.
---
Mutant slayers weapons should do more damage to mutated Residents.
---
Absolute false and wrong. There are huge differences with PA's. For example excavator has really bad physical res (300) while T-51 has over 200 more (514). Consider how much normal armors give defense.. Thats a big difference as physical damage is most common. And you can see and feel the difference really fast if you test them.
---
Well i play in survival so no biggy lol you could still destroy all the walls surround the person attacking. 
---
Plus if you plan on attacking a base you have to jump into you should be prepared, if your not your a dumb raider honestly.
---
Fat man MIRV for the win
---
The details came out about a week ago, but the general idea and the information about turning in the crap legendaries for scrip...2-3 weeks back I think?
---
Not traveling, she’ll be at the train station in the mire.
---
This has been driving me insane. Sometimes it takes like 5 swings to actually register a hit.
---
Right. Very annoying.
---
Power armor makes things easier, but it is not absolutely must have. I personally don't like the HUD while wearing armor, or how clunky it feels to walk, or having to manage power cores, so I don't use any. I've gone into nuke zones and killed every world boss without ever feeling the need to use PA. That being said, if you choose non power armor builds, get your hands on a hazmat suit. They can be found in most mines and waste disposal sites.
---
The bos failed up top. They could have built a bunker themselves but they went all in. I don't blame them but it doesn't sound like they were lead well during the plague.
---
i don't.
---
i ran out of water the other day, so i was farming it  group of players rolled up onto my camp (and mind you, my shops were de-powered so i wasn't even showing on the map), and just dicked around in my camp, which is fine.
---
but they stole all my water.
---
Always equipped for my Rifle and shotgun build, saves so much messing with repairs. On my melee build I've Makeshift Warrior equipped and don't have to constantly repair my melee weapons. Couldn't live without these 5\* point hogs unfortunately.
---
Being a PC user I can use a mod to Hot Key change perk selections make fast situational build change a snap 'Perk Loadout Manager'.
---
Oooh. They should give us the nuka cola machine secret door
---
Cool, thanks
---
I'll definitely check that vendor out. You're right I've got my carrot and I really do think that my boredom comes mainly from my generic crappy gear
---
How about you try placing them down one at a time and then taking all the pieces off the frames, checking if they behave any different? If all else fails, try contacting Bethesda Support.
---
I thought x-01 had highest energy and rad resistance, which is key for nuke zones and SBQ battles.
---
You can offset some of the x-01 electrical damage advantage over ultracite with mutations (grounded &amp; scaly skin).
---
I do one better.  I mark all my dupes down in price.  I don't need them, I can't sell them and odds are my wife already has them, so what else should I do?  Dupe plan for X that's normally 100 caps?  Sell it for 10.  
---
I don't need to be rich, I just want less total weight in my inventory.  Buy my excess ammo, buy my excess weapons...
---
..there ain't no stat alive that will pry me out of Ol' Yeller!
---
Gonna be buried in my big yellow taxi cab.
---
I think the asbestos mod will do that as well
---
A more general trade mechanism involving items plus caps where both sides have to agree before completing would be really nice.
---
I remember they found beth didn't have generated tags on the first wave. That's why they couldn't wipe all the weapons. Remember some were saying they didn't want to wipe them all but I'm sure if they could have..
---
The game only came out as a full releaseon November 18th of last year and you are expecting basic features to work?
---
Ridiculous.
---
even if its on an upper level us marsupials are just gonna jump up to it or fall off your roof and hit interact on the bed
---
There are 2 cameras. One that is Junk for scrapping and the one that you can repair for the quest. The Junk one can be sold / traded, the quest one cannot.
---
Overall, T51b for stats and for the cool Nuka cola skin and jet pack. for radiation it’s X01. For general use it’s excavator due to the 200 extra pounds of carry weight
---
It does indeed have that over then others, but then you have the likes of Re-bar which is only available to Raider, Excavator and Ultracite.
---
That could work too. Circular or angled foundations and walls. Figured a square boundary might be less to ask for but I don't know lol.
---
Also, since the new foundation change does not affect workshops, why can you not allow us to stack them. What is the harm? The change you made is mediocre at best! Still way too many building issues.
---
This is why loot and XP should be shared during events by event supergroups and between parties.
---
Sir you have it easy! I’m doing on two characters!
---
I believe it has to do with stairs, move your stairs and you should be able to place whatever you're trying to place
---
No I'm talking about repaired ones, I've sold repaired, usable cameras before. 3 cameras.
---
at least it's guaranteed 3 star item, it still may very well be worth nothing but hey, at least it has 3 stars, gotta recycle it as well lol
---
But reflective plates are better with 50% reflect verses the 25% from rebar.
---
On PS4 so I can't in person help you. 
---
Visit the mayor of Watoga and do her quest and then Watoga will not be hostile to you anymore. However I think her quest is harder than belly of the beast. Also you get a named 3* weapon as a reward. I don't know if you want it to be low level. 
---
You can bypass all BoS transponders and Watoga. Just hit the last one at the relay station and head to the caverns. 
---
Back of the caverns there is a lone metal walkway by a cavern pillar. Its too small of a gap for the SB to get through. Play cat and mouse with it there, peak, shoot, run through, repeat.
---
Bethesda... Don't listen to this guy. He doesn't realize this game is a post apocalyptic game. Clean tidy houses will break immersion. All the camps i come across are already too clean imo. It doesnt fit the theme and setting of the game to let everybody have nice clean houses. This game is not ment for that.
---
You need to shot a Yao Guai with a Syringer, not a Wolf.
---
Bloodied meathooks with faster swing speed go for serious caps! I just sold a 2* with those traits for 6999.
---
I do one better than most.  
---
I mark all my dupes down in price.  I don't need them, I can't sell them and odds are my wife already has them, so what else should I do?  Dupe plan for X that's normally 100 caps?  Sell it for 10.  Some other plan that's 1000 caps?  Sell it for 10.  Seriously, we're not making money off of this, Bethesda's taking a cut, fuck 'em for trying to make us want to sell at full price.
---
I don't need to be rich, I just want less total weight in my inventory.  Buy my excess ammo, buy my excess weapons, buy my notes, buy my mods...  I charge buyback prices for Purified Water and Stimpacks too (when available).
---
That’s exactly my point. I hate people getting scammed. I just want to kill the scammer over and over again to the point where he gives up the item. Sick of it.
---
I did that with my 9 mutton chops recipes (at 50 caps each). I'm trying to specialize in game holotapes and rare apparel, but it's hard to get big stocks of those so I use the plans to draw in visitors. However today someone bought all 9 of them at once, for reasons unknown. Strategy ruined.
---
Well since the duping bug is still active, I think they haven't gotten to the point where they're willing to let the foxes loose in the chicken coop quite yet.
---
HAHAHAHAH i love you dude
---
You make this sound like it is an error or bug in the game. Let's be real. That is the error code for banned players. Bethesda obviously has not solved all of the duping issues as evident by the last few weeks. So obviously you will not be unbanned yet.
---
Ye . Why I stop playing after a few hrs reach limit daily limits all reached can’t farm or kill anything
---
These are not limited time and are planned to be available indefinitely.
---
Yup definitely worse than ever personally its even worse than launch can't believe I love this game so much still but I will continue too

 &gt; These are not limited time and are planned to be available indefinitely.
---
It's like real life. If you trade with some random dude out of the back of a rusty Buick chances are it's not going down well. If you go to a mall or a store down town your chances are better at having a decent time. 
---
Take some time and find the marketplaces on Reddit and discord where they have community based karma and see their names often. Become part of the trading network and gain some confidence through exposure. It sucks caps have little value at least when it comes to legendary but it's what we have!
---
Exactly this
---
Ahh is that the one by the tree?
---
I think your pockets are bugged they usually only give 5
---
I understand. My issue is, they are completely ignoring us. I've wanted to speak to a human all this time for 3 months. For them to actually look at my account to see that in fact I do not have the items that my account received the error for.
---
YES!!!
---
Many people reported you can't and I can't get the tourist to show up so no way to confirm. Oh well.
---
I just don’t like being limited to right angles.
---
Xbox has a look for group function built into the game hub of every game
---
Most of fallouts trading on console is done through that
---
You thought correctly. X-01 is indeed best for nukezones. Best rad res and equal energy res to T-51 (which is best for overall use outside nukezones)
---
Agree, X-01 is for nuke zones. And excavator is farm jumping. The cheap armor to repair is T-60. T45 is the only armor that looks good with the blue vault-tec atom store paint though.
---
Thanks bud. I bought a couple serums from so thanks! But looks like you were sold out of marsupial. 
---
Our camps actually overlap (south of gorge junkyard) so I couldn't ever happen across you!
---
I prefer to put my penis in women, but you do you man.
---
Yes. Even if you also melee, most melee weapons weigh half to one third (often much more) of a rifle and take less materials to craft/repair. You can repair 2 melee weapons to 150%+ durability using weapon artisian and carry both, while protecting your rifle/gun with ammosmith.
---
For example, I carry serrated combat knife and black Diamond.
---
It's a random bug that happen to me once. I figure it was because someone was in my spot.
---
Seems like the ultimate insult. Waited until you were away just to torment you with it haha.
---
Remind me. What was the foundation change?
---
No. I don't want to be wandering post apocalyptic Appalachia and stumble across your 6 story pastel pink box with "it's lit" in neon letters on the outside.
---
I suspect they are holding back on the mats due to some sort of exploit/greifing. We know they can do it, they're in fo4.
---
I agree it would be better to have them, the majority of players are good/honest, so it would be a net benefit. Also, not gonna lie, I'm ok with fast traveling into a trap, so long as it's a little clever, and I get a chuckle.
---
That's Murgle. Wish you could tame him
---
Weird. I installed the deep pockets as a test and my total carry capacity went down from 246 to 241. When I reinstalled "normal pockets" it went back up to 246. Definitely something weird going on. I'm assuming it's not a weird thing with the chameleon effect the armor has....
---
Handmade, hands down.  If you’re not running rifles you’re at a major disadvantage
---
You have to join a friend who is in that region, or use a vpn to essentially spoof your location
---
Good deal!
---
For example?
---
Some guys have done a lot of research on this and concluded the T-51 offers the best balance of customization, protection and reliability. Excavator offers the least amount of protection but the carry weight bonus can't be beat. Raider armor is underrated and T-45 and T-60 are ok whatever. UIltracite is too costly to customize and maintain since the plans only drop from SBQ and generally require ultracite and flux to craft. And up until recently the X-01 looked nice and had decent DR/ER/RR stats but was nearly impossible to customize since you couldn't get the plans and mods were hit-or-miss at the Enclave bunker. 
---
But the real answer is: pick the one you like, they're all good. They're all going to offer good protection and look cool and cost a ton to customize and maintain. Personally I never wear power armor unless I'm in a nuke zone since most legendary armor puts power armor to shame most of the time. But to each their own.
---
The 2-7 was probably from power armour to 11. You probably have a few mutations eating away at your strength stat. Take a look at status-&gt;effects in your pipboy to see what mutations you may have and the special debuff.
---
I’m on PS4 and am older and quite. Add me fellow PS4 vaulters: trashcanman99

Strange, maybe they changed it? I haven't sold any since the update came out so maybe they did, guess I just missed it

Bug is here since beta.
---
Ah so maybe it's 170ish then? Thanks for the update
---
Well I know I wasn't me. I leave raw rubbers lol
---
I set up two water purifiers as open and locked the others.  My camp is my farm for gear I need and gear I sell.  I don't need people continually wiping out my inventory just for a quick fix of whatever when I'm trying to make Stimpacks for people or whatever project I'm working on.  
---
I have enough unlocked stuff at my camp for anyone to take some PW, open beds, workstations, etc...and enough gear to make adhesive on their own...  That's plenty as far as I'm concerned.
---
FWIW, if I have a workshop taken over, I don't lock anything there as it's a waste of my resources in case the workshop gets stolen from me.
---
Oh fair enough, no further discussion required then really :)
---
Being a part of a few stable and fun communites as well as creative my own, I have found the best way to enjoy the game is to find enjoyment vs being spoon fed it. There are things to do but it's not as extensive as an RPG not as exciting and fast paced as a FPS. I love buying/selling goods, building, exploring camps and vendors, etc. I haven't been bored since beta.
---
This games building system is miles behind fallout 4. Coming from a person whos majority of hours were building badass towns and settlements.
---
I always help them out with free gear may it be garments armour weapons or aid always a slight change or getting duped into something but generally I feel like most help each other.. exp yesterday some high level comes to my camp looks around and before she leaves drops me a max lvl exploding lmg a zeolots exploding lmg .. thing is I already have one exactly like it from ages ago .. not sure if it’s a duped weapon or not

no one's peeling me outta this banana!

Enjoy the spike traps - nice try, though.
---
Well I AM interested in PvP and the fact that TSE Sentinel Assassin is standard issue is inarguably the result of mass duping and qualifies as an effect. There's a thriving player market dominated  by 10k+ trades of this gear and the buyers are not all suckers. It's not hard to generate a very big capflow legitimately and maintain your buying power if you're careful.
---
I'll never grow sour on my giant lemon!
---
This. Has been a bug for a LONG time with automatic tesla rifles.
---
Thanks dude appreciate it
---
ikr lol ..
---
I've regularly seen lurk Queens attack basic scorchbeasts, I guess they attack the Queen too. After all, there can only be one!
---
By the Top of the World across from the nearest station. I specifically chose the spot because a junk pile was there for me to use an extractor on. It used to be next to fort defiance, but I moved it to top of the world yesterday. I'm quite proud of my build, really.
---
Edit: Forgot to mention I'm on Xbox One.
---
I have a blodied explosive lever action what build should I use with it?
---
I think a vending machine like this just wouldn't work. 
---
What would be better, and (I know bupkiss about programmin) what I assume way easier, is just add that feature to the live trade screen. That way 2 people face to face can agree to a very specific trade. 
---
I completely agree with you that there needs to be an item for item trade capability. I've made a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bhfl7q/altering_trade_to_reduce_or_eliminate_scams/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) about this in the past. The apocalypse isnt going to survive on a monetary system. Capitalism failed us in the first place. The bartering of goods and services will be the currency
---
Pre explosive nerf a Quad Explosive DB was the best gun in the game imo

---
Green actually means “proceed with caution” but I digress.
---
Ok someone who finally said it. The load times are so bad now I was thinking it was just me having so much stuff on my vendor. Then I switch toons and realize even the world don't load in properly because I'm walking through buildings like a ghost.
---
Does it look any different? The atomic shop pictures are the most vague pictures I have ever seen.
---
To the player and their team.  I steal my wife's crops all the time and they do not respawn for her.  Same with her water.  
---
Basically if you share a locked item with anyone by having them on your team, it's free-for-all to anything in their camp as well as yours.
---
That’s pretty good, and could be a solid 2nd place. 
---
Unyielding Rifle build is what you are
---
The issue is ignorance. I had a winning record against sentinel users with a measily 10mm pistol. My build completely countered them. Critical hits ignored sentinel armor. Critical hit damage is based on base weapon damage. I stacked tons of critical hit damage bonuses. Black powder weapons have the highest base damage in the game, enough to kill anyone in one shot. At one point, I was using a hybrid 10mm auto pistol / BPPistol build to instant kill people with only critical damage. I did not even need to use single shot damage boosting perks. One shot protection forced me to rely purely on automatic criticals.
---
The answer was always there, we were just too headstrong to use it.
---
Wastelanders DLC will be regular human NPCs coming to Appalachia, and discovering the monstrosities of vault 76 that have taken over the land. They try to use the nukes to wipe us out like we wiped out the scorchbeasts.
---
You’re not a possum yet, you have to shot it again as a possum plus a Radstag and a wolf.
---
Eh, it's more complicated than that.  If the system is capable of deleting identical objects with a serial number of some sort, it might work.  But if not, you have to 'manually' check for them.  Then, what do you do about a dupe that gets traded?  Now there's not 2 in the same place, so your check could miss it.
---
So check ALL THE THINGS for dupes.  Yup!  But if I sold a duped copy, what do you do about the person who paid good caps?  And how do you know which one is the person who duped, and which is the patsy?
---
OK so lets log all trades.  And purchases, and sells.  And drops.  OK that's a lot of stuff....we'll limit it to 3 star legendaries.  OK well 2 and 3, nobody dupes a 1 star right?  Yeah, OK them too.  And serums.  And outfits, but only rare ones.  Oh, can't filter by those?  Hmm.  OK all outfits, how many could that be anyway? 
---
Oh, by the way, anyone know why the servers are running so slow all of a sudden?
---
Is it also kind of close to some enemies, and maybe some water? I know there's a berry bush close by, and some carrots flowers.
---
I just want stairs that are the same width as a the foundations.
---
Explosive Gatling Gun, really of any kind. Small caliber 5mm rounds made super powerful.
---
Move to Cranberry Bog.
---
My BE Handmade or FE Handmade for pve is pretty untouchable, AAE Handmade (a lot prefer without the E as people run fireproof in pvp), and the same setup on combat shotguns are pretty tight right now too, but any shotgun depending on preferences, I like the combat for the 8rnd+ mag with decent reload speed, but some prefer the pump and db as what you sacrifice in reload and clip size it makes up with damage, and for distance the lever is pretty meta as it drops serious damage at a good range and has a pretty high rate of fire and can be made insanely accurate
---
So BE, FE, AA, AAE on handmade, any (but mostly combat) shotgun and lever actions... Vampires gear is also very hot right now, I run bloodied melee with handmade backup, and switch to furious too sometimes...
---
So you buy the head first and then the bottom ?
---
For fireflies you can try maybe the light house at night, I know for certain if you see the Wise Mothman event that plenty will spawn for that.
---
Misc. Tab is also misleading at times. sometimes it'll have a number but, check all 4 machines and nothing listed under Misc category....
---
Agree we need loadouts.
---
How about let's be respectful to each other and not make assumptions like you just have.
---
Sadly for me it was a bug. I snuck up on a few players that were together, killed them, took the few bags that was there, as usual most players will use the take all option because you have 4 or 5 or however may players coming back for blood. 
---
However in one of these bags was a large stack of items. So at that moment I was immediately flagged and my account was suspended when they launched the suspension. 
---
I don't even have these items anymore. I got rid of them when I realized what had occurred. Betheada indicated in their email that in a future patch they would remove the items and reinstate the accounts. 
---
I do not have the afformentioned items to begin with.
---
I feel like it's different though, you can build infinite things with the camp system, power armor paint is just one look and it's done. I haven't bought atoms, but I've been close a few times.
---
Radants can be found at the Giant Teapot. The daily event spawns them.
---
Sometimes a Radscorpion spawns at Whitesprings.  Those are where I found mine.
---
Sounds like a solid plan to me. There’s always the big ol 2h sledgehammers too. I think in most games that’s his weapon.
---
Just need to find a samurai helmet.
---
There is the riverside manor quest line, you get an unstoppables free costume from this.
---
I sell them for half of what they're worth. Sometimes less. I sold Small letters for 225. I also repurpose Scorched weapons and upgrade them. Then I sell them. The suppressed weapons are favorites.
---
So yeah, this dude is lying his ass off. Check his history. He made posts trying to both buy and sell the mask. He also said he gave it away to a friend, yet here he says it's been in his stash untouched for a week. 
---
Your GT's are accurate for the type of person you are
---
I have a blodied explosive pump should I use that or a blodied fire axe
---
I've got one for 7676c atm..
---
Ah seems like I missed the new info, thank you dude 👍
---
The insult I got was " I heard in those vault they give awards. What award did you get. Did you get the one for being a bother" It went something like that and it was a good one.
---
I love you like I love my rl wv cousins
---
And a reasonable nice looking half wall/bannister to make a balcony with.
---
Mistress of Mysteries counts for those challenges, as well
---
Toxic valley has rad ant and radscorpions spawn at a few of the farms
---
I think there's one or two in the Nuka Cola plant.
---
Blueprinting would be nice... I am only able to select two non-adjacent foundations of my 3x3 CAMP, and an entire 1x3 wing of walls and its adjoining stairs are unselectable.
---
If I ever accidentally move my CAMP, it's game over!
---
In the same vein, I'd love to be able to wear certain outfits as underarmor, even if it would clip I think it would be cool to wear a Combat Chest Piece over my Silver Shroud outfit.
---
Anybody know where to find an opossum to photograph?  
---
I found a fox off the road just south of the Spruce Knob workshop
---
I found a rabbit up the hill by the white springs service entrance 
---
There is a cat between Mount Blair Trainyard and Welch Station at a coffee shop 
---
Everything else is pretty easy to find, but no Opossum.
---
Everything was whacked out today...had amissle launcher break and still put three rounds through it....and an entire clubhouse full of slidey Bois is an incredible pain.
---
The roofs in the camp system have honestly given me the most trouble out of everything I have experienced. Mind you it's not Mass Effect: Andromeda or Diablo 3 bad, more like what [Quite Shallow does to videogames bad](https://youtu.be/bFN3UjMqiH4).
---
watsonhorror yes.
---
Whitespring Hotel entrance (not the bunker or the train station).  Right in front of you when you spawn is a red car, the tourist will show up on the hood.
---
Super quick server hop at that location, I'd try there.
---
Lol crazy good drop. Personally I wouldn't bother investing in grenadier and look to do the standard bloodied build. Things like nerd rage and perks that up your resistance at low health, lone wonderer would also help. You can also go the luck agility route and use things like serendipity but it's more useful on a melee character. 
---
Armour wise again you'll want to be using sentinals/ unyielding ect to make yourself more tanky, or use power armour with emergency protocols. You'll also want a few mutations, Eagle eyes and adrenal reaction specifically. Basically bloodied builds are the equivalent of thanos and his finger snap.
---
This would be great.
---
griefers.. uh uh... find a way.
---
Harley Quinn is my melee 2H build already, I figure the Deathclaw gauntlet looks like something from MK.
---
I don't crash as often but I do travel the wasteland as a ghost, walking through buildings and walls. I even run into ghouls who now slide upon the ground. Ever seen an army of corpses slip and slide after you in WS? Funny looking but sucks.
---
You just got back from the dmv. Lol
---
Thanks! My discord is Dadicus#0920 and my IGN is Trashtrap. I sent you a request
---
This happened to me. I am sure it was the same server because I checked the map, same camps and events going on. Quite to desktop worked instead of the main menu.
---
Thanks 👌
---
Should be a way to repair _damaged_ items, not only _destroyed_ items.
---
A good spin on *two* old repetitive posts. I love your creativity.
---
Awesome! I sent you a request, my IGN is Trashtrap and my discord is Dadicus#0920
---
Scorched and non-scorched are hostile to one another and they’ll often focus on each other even if there are players around.
---
Oh okay. Yeah I agree it does. Maybe like groknaks costume with the skull mask kind has a shao kahn look. 
---
What do you wear for Harley?
---
i want it in the mire D:
---
That’s the same for everyone, now. Wasn’t always this way so people had to grind
---
I’m sayin’!
---
You gotta pick them up from there spawns its not a bug you gotta go to thete world spawns
---
Really depends on build... for me? I'd rock that fire axe all day, but I'm a bloody melee and have my perks set exactly to it, however my buddy is a shot gunner and wouldnt agree at all lol... so heres my thoughts as melee, you do way more damage, and your strength directly increases that damage, where as eating a daddy-o isnt gonna boost the shotgun damage,where the whiskey is gonna add 300 damage to the axe for me
---
Honestly I’m not really sure haha haven’t played in a little over a month and really wanna get back into it. What’s your IGN?
---
they don't work if bought, no.
---
i don't even think they count  towards the achievement if they're bought, either, tbh.
---
To my knowledge, since the beginning these challenges only count if you pick up a magazine in the wild. Taking it from a paper bag or buying it from a player has never counted.
---
Why is hair so difficult to make in video games? Real question.
---
Locks and traps only keep out honest people. 
---
But no worries about me. I just like to see people's design style. Hell, I've even picked up some poops left by others. 
---
But on the flip side, I've left some poops. Sometimes with a hardened mass because, well, dog food just ain't agreeing with me somedays. However I only do it with people I'm currently chatting with because frankly, their reaction is hilarious
---
For a rifle build with all those V.A.T.S. Luck perks I’d recommend Action Boy or Girl to boost your action point regeneration. Ditch through hiker and cook and eat more regularly
---
Added you! IGN is Trashtrap
---
I love halloween candy.
---
Yeah.
---
The garb of mysteries?
---
Same ! I hadn’t really played since those nerfs but They really reignited what I liked about this game in my opinion
---
it doesn't matter which stat you choose to put your point into, you can still collect a perk card from any stat regardless of level.
---
I like jumping in my Sentinal armor and it's still working but I think it should all be fixed.
---
I want more than just cabins. I can already fake that well enough but building is my end game and I want more variety please.  a trailer please more floors and walls etc... real roof pieces to make true to life proportions... a mail box....
---
Im going with the axe thanks
---
Also, fire axe is 2h, so wouldnt be amazing in my hands, but better than the pump (I'm bloody unarmed, so dcg, pf, mmg dropping 2.5k before I drink/eat/take anything and swing it about 2 times a second)
---
Someone on the nexus mods get in this.
---
Yes.
---
Thanks, didn’t know this
---
Thanks for the tip. 45% increased recovery rate would be nice if I need to VATS a lot.
---
surprisingly the roofs are the only thing i have no problem with variety wise, maybe different materials but im content with shapes.
---
I'd finally move from my monorail camp if I could make a log cabin.
---
Nice! Yeah crits are a good counter. Basically 100% of the reason i pop stealth boys when i pvp. I used to hit them with the gamma. Not many guys had rad sheild and radaway hot keyed. Doesnt work anymore though. After the armour nerf i can't stay alive long enough to rad them down. Fire rate is the only thing now
---
I litterally kept all my legendery that i got since the game launched, even crap one one my mule and i have 4 assassin  10mm pistol 1 star. Does that makes me a duper?
---
It's because bones aren't supposed to be hairy.
---
I would love a Vault-Tec set.
---
I like the idea my character resents being pushed out of the Vault, and just wants to retreat to a replica somewhere.
---
Im over some water, so I put in a high dive.  Helped a few fellow scouts so far.
---
Heh. I'm a fan, but I think you'd be more generally considered a super fan v.s. me as a strong fan. I'm just a tattoo artist on top of being a fan, so it's a logical progression. :)
---
It's always been the case as far as i know. Ultracite plans were always rewarded along with a complete set of Power Armor after completing the questline.
---
If some day I want to sell it ill tell you
---
I believe he was looking at the dead couple and not the red bear. It's a comforting sight where they're holding each other.
---
Combined with well tuned and the boost from lone traveller it adds up :)
---
I give you this and all of my future up votes. 
---
Can’t be that different from the train car assets they made for FO4z
---
Good call, I would suggest the axe... oh also, bloodied explosive weapons are really really frustrating (for me at least who tries to run and gun as fast as I can) so I kill myself more than any enemy does... lol

Thank you so much! I love that this made it to the eyes of someone who works at Bethesda. Really appreciate you taking the time to look. Keep up the good work!
---
no pain no gain..
---
You're welcome :) getting those challenges is quite a journey, my husband and I still havent got them all and we play almost every day since the beta started :/
---
GIVE US MORE RAIDER THEMED BUILDINGS AND OBJECTS
---
No, the ultracite plans were not always in the computer
---
My automatic quad explosive railway is bar none unless it's some beachboy POS jumping around using a stealth boy and an automatic quad Tesla. They are terrible at PvP but using stealth boys keeps them from being hit much while jumping around and the Tesla makes it so that they dont even have to shoot at their target to get a kill.
---
Spped deamon and marsupial make it so much more enjoyable to play, really ups your freedom of movement and adds different ways to use the map.
---
Yes that hapens to me
---
The bottom first
---
I'm based out of Michigan. You can pay me in deathclaw hides.
---
Alright.
---
SO even the lowly excavator comes in at 240 damage resistance. (300 with frame)
---
Now 90% of all enemies in this game deal absolutely pittance amounts of damage. We're talking no perks no mods weapons here, so even high level enemies are doing around 50 damage per shot. Meaning the good old excavator is reducing it all by around 75%
---
The 454 (514) damage reduction of the t-51 is going to yield a grand amount of around 78%
---
a 3% increase in resistance, now this is a lot better than 3%, as it takes you damage received from 25% to 22%. A 12% reduction in the amount of overall damage you will be taking.
---
So in general against any enemy with a gun the difference between power armors isn't significant.
---
What about something a little bigger.
---
The scorchbeast queen wallops on you for 220 base damage per hit in melee
---
Excavator will reduce her damage by a healthy \~55%
---
T-51 is distinctly better reducing it by \~63%
---
Offering an \~18% increase in damage protection.
---
Overall the difference between the very best and absolute worst power armor is not particularly significant, about 15% overall increase in protective properties.
---
The margins between the X-01 and the T-51 is smaller than that of course. The question largely comes down to repair costs.
---
Ranked
---
Raider &gt; T-60 &gt;&gt;&gt; T-45 &gt; T-51 &gt; Exc &gt; X-01 &gt; Ult

---
It's really up to you what you want. The only power armor that doesn't justify itself is T-45, which is mediocre in defense, and on the costly side to maintain. The only possible saving grace is if you hunt treasure maps relentlessly you can get the upgrade plans for it free more easily than other T-series (meaning jetpack)
---
Check containers and scorchbeast guano piles in cranberry bog.
---
I found mine in a toolbox at Drop Site V9. People have found them in other containers as well. Search posts here for further details.
---
Oh I appreciate the offer! I actually have wanted a fire axe though, I use a grognak mostly, definately a fun run
---
Yes! There's one I found once somewhere in the eastern hills of the forest that looks like a hard-sided tow-behind with fold-down windowed sides, but you can't build in that area. 
---
An empty one would be perfect for a quick-drop camp.
---
Radscorpions are one of 3 that spawn at the Cabins east of Whitesprings (Yao Guai &amp; the uggo bees will as well).
---
Found a fair share of 3* legendary there over the months to boot.
---
Radants are a weird one. I've seen them more recently but still far, far less then the other bugs.
---
Yes, that. Sorry, a little inebriated right now.
---
Bloodied Explosive, Anti-Armor Explosive,  Two-shot Explosive, Instigating Explosive are the Best ranged weapons, Bloodied Faster Swing Speed, Instigating, Anti-armor Swing speed are the best melee weapons.
---
considering that i got them on the 3rd or 4th day the game was out, yes they were.
---
One million upvotes to you.
---
Well that's pretty cool tbh, although not my intentions, thanks for looking out reddit
---
Anytime I’m in WS or doing uranium fever with other people I just switch to my Tesla and make sure everything gets tagged. One time some guy one shorted all three 3* mole miners in uranium fever. I threw up the mad face emote and kept gettin in his grill, he ended up just giving me two legendaries for free but... Not the point!!! But yeah Tesla rifle is the best thing for these scenarios
---
Would you reckon it's closer to 2.5 or 1.5x the damage on the first shot?
---
It’s going to be a busy place for awhile!
---
I average 6 hours to build my bases, I spend a lot of time making them look great, not just a shitty shack like so many I see in the worlds.
---
Huge gamer. Huge fantasy nerd. Have always wanted a health pack or potion of some sort. So, when I fell deep in love with fallout (in the Fo4 days) it seemed like an awesome twist on the idea.
---
To me, a health pack or potion tattoo symbolizes strength in the face of adversity. I've got depression and anxiety, so when I'm having a low day it might remind me that I still have more left in the tank. Everyone can use an extra life!
---
Thanks for looking, regardless!

A petition is being passed around. It is in the description of the video. It actually hits on some of your topics. Now if I take a workshop i get messages telling me to return their junk or I'm getting reported. I really agree with assassin weapons as they suck. You can get a mutants weapon and have better stats.
---
it didnt bomb lol
---
Most modern MMOs do this though, so it can't be that complicated. I don't play ESO, but they probably have that system so the Fallout 76 crew could just borrow some code from the ESO crew. It's the same company so they could legally copy and paste stuff.
---
Loving my AAE handmade. Explosive rifleman build with this thing is lethal.
---
Thanks. So just search anything other than the deathclaw itself lmao. Never thought i would look from piles of poop just for a rare item
---
I can help ya in about an hour. Already did it but willing to help others. Add me xTEKNIKLx and I'll join in once done. I got an easy place to do it too.
---
Very cool, thanks
---
Implement after accessibility ramps are implemented to get around Appalachia. You can sneak far without "hopping".
---
If you’re not able to find anyone for this, I’d definitely recommend going to the next available Imposter Sheepsquatch battle. There’s a pool of water in the middle of the fight and people get knocked down there quite a bit.
---
Sometimes you find dead deathclaws next to fissure sites so it makes sense that you’d find their hides in SB poop.
---
It’d make more sense if you found it on the animal itself though for sure.
---
I grabbed all of them from a person's camp to get the remaining caps I needed to buy the serums he was selling. XD
---
as a Rasta, I concur
---
I was placed in the same world 5 times in a row, had the same afk dude standing at the spawn point every time, they may not be able to check the server first but they can bloody well make sure your not placed in the server you just left.
---
I'm right there with ya on the bugs...
---
Though to be fair... Mike and Carl just do the Models and Textures, so you shouldn't get mad at *them* for being able to churn out stuff that we can get in the Atom Shop! Charlenne and Phillip are the ones responsible for map objects and scripting... though I mainly blame Phillip for slacking on getting it right the first time.
---
However, in the end, it's Bethesda's fault for having a partially-open Beta (ie having to pre-order), and further their fault for thinking a week would be enough time to hammer out all the bugs that crop up. Instead, they're inundated with all the catch up work placed upon them from the lackluster Beta Test period. 
---
\[/s\]
---
This entire post is primarily to be taken as satire with my just poking fun at the release schedule Beth has chosen for 76 updates and how things have been conducted, **but**, there's still a valid point to take away: There are different teams doing different work, so the fact we have new Atom Shop content shouldn't be a point to be upset with them over. It's not like they've stopped important work to debut that stuff. Yet, the game does feel like it is actually in the final "polishing stages" of Beta as well, so that they released too early is also valid.
---
I'm waiting m8
---
Yeah, i do one run through harpers and sell it all to the bot. Usually nets me a grand. Then I pop off to the ski slopes and the loot there finishes my cap limit off. Lv 120.
---
Really pissed me off when 5 times in a row it was the same world with the same AFK dude standing at the train station spawn point I kept getting placed at, when I say "Yes" to switching worlds to place my camp it should find a world my camp can be placed in before loading me in, at the very least it shouldn't put me right back in the same world I just left.
---
Don't go in people's camps then, there's plenty else for you to explore
---
I’ll compromise and allow prewar buildings in an apocalypse as long as floating bases are destroyed.
---
Can 1/2 walls and 1/2 floors take 1/2 the budget while we’re at it. Or just increase the budget by 15%
---
Great news, thanks for communicating! I was starting to wonder if these changes were intentional.
---
Pancor Jackhammer
---
what language?  curious.  guessing pc?
---
You can't not have a status for being in the air/jumping for animation reasons so it's really a matter of whether they check that status for this kind of stuff.
---
260, backpack and marsupial.
---
I literally remember when people were bitching about having to farm the SBQ Queen over and over for the ultracite plans and then one day they just put them in the terminal for everyone that competed the quest. What were people grinding for if they were already in the terminal. Yes you got the suit for free but not the PLANS
---
It's specifically what my post is about but sure I guess it was vague to you
---
That's fine for small camps but if I have some big project going and I want my available space adjusted slightly I don't want to have to rebuild. Blueprints only hold so much.
---
Your percentage is wrong it’s on a scale of 1 to willie
---
i WUV my tse handmade. :D  i see a lot of people with badass flamers too.  guess it depends on your build.  at level 48 my tse does 150 damage and will do much more at 50.
---
Also no I am not reposting with your requested less vague title. I am instead unsubbing.
---
Only the full suit
---
Go live at Grafton Steel. When you can clear it, 1-2 shot everything melee, without using ammo.....venture east/southeast.
---
Only the full suit was awarded at completion
---
No plans
---
I’m curious why the building restrictions are as restrictive as they are, genuinely curious. There are so many glitches and work arounds to make things work that I wonder why not just remove the restrictions all together? Or at least make it less restrictive? What are the challenges for the dev team, if any, to just removing building restrictions outright, or at least making them less severe? Again I’m not hating I’m genuinely curious.
---
I did the same. I killed a bounty hiding in his camp, revived him but he attacked me again as I left. So I rifle slammed him till he was on his knees again..... then shot his cow before I shot him. 
---
I got 9 messages telling me how he felt like John Wick when his dog was killed. I told him even John puts up a fight. And next time don't break into houses like a common crackhead and come out blazing like John.
---
Agreed regardless I am sure there will be lines!
---
Actually you know what, 62 people would weigh multiple tons. So what I said was accurate by every metric.

Radants *always* spawn at the substation north of Watoga, but you have to be quicker than the deathclaw, or it will steal those kills. ;-) They are also one possible enemy spawn at Appalachian Antiques.
---
You got the power armor itself, not the plans to build it. You had to farm plans from SBQ. Couple patches ago the plans were added to the terminal.
---
English and yes PC my mistake I should have specified
---
TIL BP have a capacity.
---
The guy who doesn't know what "NPC" means is calling me ignorant? I'm definitely not smarter than everyone else...but apparently, I am smarter than you ;)
---
You still need it?
---
Adrenal Reaction is very nice.
---
Adding higher tiers of weapons is natural in games like this. Are you saying you never want them to add new stuff?
---
Rad ants Power station north of watoga
---
Spawns there with a deathclaw eating them more often than not
---
100% spawn rate for me on a server hop
---
Fireflies are at the lighthouse SE of vault 76
---
Radscorpian can spawn at the end of Camp Fire Tales event at camp adams
---
i disagree simply because killing people is easier then staying alive while being shot. 
---
if they made it so i wasnt getting 1-2 tapped in vats with full ass/sent, 500+ DR/ER, dodgy and more then id be fine with it. 
---
currently jumping in chameleon is the only way to stay alive and have a decent fire fight. 
---
i dont even like that i can be vats'ed after being shot in stealth. ruins the whole point of stealth. 
---
we need a pvp overhaul.
---
ok. well good luck!
---
Let’s gooooooo
---
Haha. Good one.
---
Grafton Steel seems to be a popular answer. I’ll give this one a go! Ammo is no issue, I use a .50cal instigating sniper so I can carry and craft loads of ammo. I’ll grab a cheapo melee though for the serious farm. Thank you all for the input so far.
---
Just got mine loot also.... hell yeah
---
I wouldn’t be able to tell you, but it does bring up a good point that explosive instigating is not good for mob because after the first shot the explosive damage will hit the mob and you won’t get instigating after that.
---
By the way, this legendary challenge (and the previous) are bugged... but in a good way. You don’t have to be in Survival to unlock it. Possibly not after tomorrow, though, if Bethesda patches it.
---
That is good advice and believe it or not....soon you can clear all of those areas, melee only, no ammo.
---
Save ammo for difficult mobs.
---
Fireflys also spawn at New Gad, but you might have to try a few servers until you find them. Radscorpions have always spawned for me at the (raider?) camp between the crashed space station and Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.
---
It's because in real life it's one unified "object" made from thousands of small objects. 
---
Devs can either: 
---
* make hair one single piece (or a few pieces like pony tails, bangs, parts etc), so it looks like hair in a still frame, but then those pieces don't move fluidly like real hair does, nor do they reflect/occlude light like real hair with thousands of gaps, kinks, waves, and folds
---
* go to the trouble of rendering it as many pieces to bypass some of the above issues, but still not be able to apply real-world consistent physics to how it moves, ***and*** compromise by rendering only dozens or maybe scores of hairs so as to not melt GPUs. This tends to create the uncanny valley effect at worst, or digital alopecia at best.
---
Class Freak nullifies the negative aspects, right?
---
With that, couldn't you just run with ALL the mutations just for fun?
---
I don't care for the way they change the perk card situation I'm constantly having to take one off put one up then go back through reset my cards
---
Preach!!!🙌
---
I find them spawning in hunting cabins in the mire and that Acre place way south east of Watoga.
---
Yes. Multiple times a day, always during an event it seems which makes it that much more annoying. Screen will freeze for a second and then the game closes itself. I hardly ever used to get crashes like this. Maybe once a week. It was always disconnects, never crashes, now it's vice versa.
---
I own a bloodied fire rate pipe pistol, it owns in pvp.
---
So THAT'S why the mysterious stranger does it.
---
Huh? You mean select what you want to cook &amp; be able to walk away while it cooks multiple things? Would be cool if that’s what you mean but I mean it’s so simple to cook now.. you just literally double click A (on Xbox) &amp; that’s it, foods done shove it in the pipes &amp; repeat in 5 minutes when you’re starving
---
Perhaps the sellers don't care?  I price all kinds of items unimaginably cheap.  Not really looking to make cap profit but rather just to unload stuff I have no need for and perhaps help other players along the way.
---
Yeah melee vats teleport nerf gone too far
---
I wouldn’t be mad either, I would actually go back.. but this time I’d bring 3 orbital strike beacon’s with me ;-)
---
I need someone for the challenge
---
Sometimes you just gotta get two birds stoned at once.
---
Yeah this happens to me a lot and it’s extremely annoying lol
---
Thankfully someone was kind enough to help me with it before then! Big fan of that sword! :D
---
Unfortunately, the Pipe Guns that have the automatic receiver options do not benefit from the double dip perks.  Only the Pipe Bolt-Action and Revolver variants of the Pipe Guns do.
---
And what do we say to the asses of Death?
---
Dromedary and slow metaboliser are more costly than they are really worth, and you should replace them with good doggy and cola nut, this saves 3 perk points and gives you decent healing items as well as quenching food and thirst better. 
---
As for the three points, I would definitely recommend putting two into luck for starched genes.
---
As for the last perk, I don't know, it's up to you, I like always having access to green thumb, but a point into thru hiker or can do are also valid uses.
---
Dying is never my problem I'm that fight. I'm pretty well geared armor wise, it's usually the damage output that drags that fight out. My range weapons aren't great, but once she lands I stand right in her face and beat her with my 2 star super Sledge (+40% heavy attack damage, increased damage with each consecutive hit on a Target)
---
0600 hrs on your pipboy.
---
34y/o on xbox one .. I have a level 150 and a level 15 gamertag Facepuncher85 let me know if u wanna team up
---
I want to see many more trap bases, and see how original people can get.
---
Good bot, bad context😂
---
One needs to be grounded the rest don't.
---
MUHAHAHAHA LEARN TO READ.. joke
---
I need it too.  I did it once, but it only counted as a ally revive instead of both
---
Just unsub and call it a day. No need to announce. Sounds like your craving for atten and want someone to beg you to stay.
---
Could not find you. I play solo so not real savvy on adding friends. My gt is OCRCustoms ga if your online.
---
That's why I wrote muhahahaha... joke
---
GT?
---
Oh no I just decided I was going to say bye felicia
---
Bye. Needed some attention before you left?
---
Ok atten whore
---
Hmm what do you think muhaha means... does like it is something to be taken seriously??
---
Oh nooooo...
---
Try to get ahold of vanguard armor, the higher your health, the higher your energy and damage resist.
---
As someone with a slow connection, which may or may not be a factor here, all I can say it: I wish. :(
---
In the 20+ times I've actually tried using Power Armor to get me unstuck, **never once** have I been able to even PLACE IT.   
---
And as someone mentioned about using it for access through a window? I decided I'd drop down into a room in Harper's Ferry (near the Chem workbench) from the upper level of the house, just cuz. Placed my PA outside the window so I could escape. Entered PA. Now I'm stuck inside with my PA :D   
---
Had to Fast Travel to get out lol
---
So far, on the occasions where I've been stuck but on the outer-edge of a foundation piece (generally only concrete), walking around, then standing still to let it gently move you around, then walking more, rinse repeat, has worked once or twice. 
---
The only guaranteed way to get out and check their vendors, has been to fast-travel away (but nearby) and back again. Their build is still stored in memory and doesn't have to reload again, spawning be on-top this time. 
---
*\[For the record, I'm on PC; would be interesting to know if OP is, and/or if for those this works, what platform you're on.\]*
---
No i mean that you can cook, 10 from the same meal at once
---
A little vague here, please repost with a better descriptive title.
---
Sincerely yours,

-75% of the negatives.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Yes mate will msg you
---
I got one that said “ I heard you got drunk and woke up late to leaving the vault. Too bad you didn’t do that before entering”. Not gonna lie it hurt a little.
---
I found one near Whitesprings that was an absolute maze, complete with a dozen trigger doors to get through. Could have had traps and I still would have enjoyed it. The reward at the end was a reasonably priced as level 50 combat rifle :)
---
That wasnt the issue for me. I had my place set up as a home and decided to make it a store/workshop for people.
---
I just didnt know it was an actual bug, part of me thought that it makes sense that if you shut down your store your items arent technically for sale anymore and thats why it happened and i would have to "restock".
---
I would argue the bottom option is a possibility. They can try something similar to what they do with foliage right now. Maybe create layers with a base texture. Something similar to the Chem Friendly haircut.
---
For ethnic hair, I don't know what they need to do.
---
This *is* literally why it's trash here. You're even getting downvoted lol.
---
Mav3rickFalc0n
---
I’m almost positive I found a way to get through the quest but honestly I stopped playing pretty soon after that and can’t remember what it was. Sorry, I wish I could be of more assistance!
---
OMG! That's awesome! So true. You just made my day. Take care.
---
100% agree with you here
---
They just made it so that only the first foundation has to touch terrain. After that, they can just snap together. So, you could place one foundation on the edge of a cliff, build off of the cliff by snapping more foundations to it, then remove the original foundation. So the foundations would be completely floating in the air off the side. This is just one example. The only real change is that it makes them snap together easier, when it works.
---
so, I maxed out all riflemen perks (tank one too), actiongirl, blacksmith, and have a lot of things regarding lowering weights of items.  and have a few explosive perks for my favorite gun (tse handmade) -- does 150 damage at level 48.  my play style is similar, very casual.  i maxed out my perception a few levels ago.
---
I *was* originally posting about a glitch that was eating possum badges but apparently that's not good enough. So just fyi possum badges *are loseable* to glitches now that I have your attention.
---
I was in one that had a open door that said exit.... it was a door to a 100 foot drop luckily I was cautious that time
---
So let me get this straight.. you just happened to kill a group of duper’s &amp; got banned for their loot? That would be a lifetime achievement my man I’ve never heard that one before👌🏼
---
Todd Howard called, he said he doesn’t care and nor do we
---
Does it work with the green hood?
---
Found this online and aced all of the exams. Unfortunately I’m a solo player and will most likely never revive another player so I’m at a standstill.

---
It just won't be the same without you.
---
I have to exit building mode completely for it to stop that.
---
Ah had someone who looked very much like your character and user name was my first ever sale. Spent almost 2k caps I was floored if it was you I was going to be blown away. Lol
---
This might get their attention: I will buy more atom shop stuff if I can put it in my camp. My budget is full, so I don't have room for more. Increase budget and get my money!
---
Anti material rifle hands down. I wanna make my character an NCR ranger so bad
---
There it is I won this argument when you said there are human npcs you knew exactly what I mean but deliberately went out of your way to act above me I’m done talking to you because you’re a waste of time and I’m sure the small amount of people willing to be in your presence would agree with me
---
I think you didn't read the post closely enough
---
I’m not too keen on maxing out the riflemen cards. The first 3 points (1 point per card) give 10% a piece, but the last 6 points only give 5% each. I didn’t want to spend 6 points for 30% base when there were a lot of other options to choose from.
---
It’s been like that since I started playing in December, though. One foundation, then anything goes.
---
What do u play on?
---
I think Bethesda can definitely do better on more diverse hair styles and making them a more appealing overall, but I think it's going to be 5-10 years before GPUs have enough power to allocate to rendering *any* truly realistic hair. I think it's just not a dev priority when compared to getting faces, eyes, and clothing perfect.
---
I feel like as the game goes on, we’ll get better walls and sets to reflect the advancing usage of materials. Perhaps even, at some point, the ability to merge camps to create small villages.
---
My bad I wrote it in my head like 5x ps4
---
Yeah that used to be a good source. Also lucky hole mines has around 1:3 chance to spawn rad ants. The new place is camp adams event when getting kindling. Also radscorpions spawn right next to the daily in toxic valley, forget the name of the camp but it's above pioneer.
---
on console it's right on the D pad, though it tells you on console with an icon next to the tracked challenges
---
Canada
---
Agreed. especially when hats and headgear exist in games.
---
Send me invite blazinbrazilian
---
I've had this problem too. Only solution I came up with was to build another foundation and set of stairs to what you are trying to get rid of. Once I did that, I was able to get rid of the other foundations and stairs.
---
Damn! Haha
---
Yes, This seems to be a "new" thing but it's really good to see how people can do something with the "few" somethings we have in this game as it is atm.
---
Will do
---
I literally had to tear down my house south of Monagah Power plant due to “intersecting” with thin air. Frustrating...
---
I just tested this with my pipe gun modded to have an automatic receiver.  Only benefits from the Commando perks, not the Guerilla perks :(
---
Help someone out for a while and *then* give them the valuable heirloom while explaining how great it was to you.
---
Did that with a level 15 pipe rifle legendary, started up with giving it to someone who became a regular gaming buddy, and a month back he mentioned he passed it on to another buddy
---
Message 10/10
---
Delivery 1/10
---
Receptability is null apparently 🤷‍♂️
---
People should really look into 1 piece with goat legs or 2 pieces with the acrobat perk and not using goat legs. Most useful armor perk IMO.
---
I sell everything for like 20 caps, free money and it gets rid of extra weight. What do I care what happens to it after that.
---
That’s basically exactly right. lol in case no one has seen the movie 7 Days in Hell I can’t hear indubitably without hearing Kit Harrington saying it.
---
May all the downvoters lose all their possum badges. Seems only fair.
---
I want railings so I can make a true loft
---
Ooo didnt realise it got good after modding out might have a look if pos mines only at 60something per hit right now bloody rubbish lol
---
Oh my todd that would be fun, I would totally give Kent all my comics
---
I buy cheap stims  whenever I have the caps, I'm too lazy to farm the ingredients most the time
---
 I felt a great disturbance in the Force. As if millions of dupers cried out in terror, and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened.
---
Can not agree more on this. This is the main reason I do not go out to camps to check out its armor unless it happens to be right next to me or one caps travel.
---
Yeah that one singing protectron from fallout 4
---
The title was lovely and clear thank you, although I found the rest a little lacking in substance.
---
Why is this guy getting downvoted? He presented his points fairly and precisely. Dont get pissy because you disagree with him.
---
There is no such thing as "general" power armor mods. The mods you occasionally pick up with unspecified type are for the Excavator Armor. There are no mods for the ultracite armor available (currently) from in-game NPC Vendorbots (they do drop from SBQ).   
---
Of the 4 mods you listed, I suspect only 2 exist in game at all. I've yet to see "explosive shielding" or "titanium plating " in 76 for any armor. (they were nice in FO4 though...).On a positive note, the vendorbots now carry ALL the mod plans for every other set of armor (Brotherhood bots (Whitesprings, Watoga)  have T series, Raider Bots (Whitesprings, Sunnytop) have Raider, Responder Bots (Whitesprings, Grafton) have Excavator and Enclave has X-01 mods. Some of the better mods require flux to craft...
---
Armour Plated gives +90 to all of the resistances? Meaning:
---
+90 Ballistic Resistance
---
+90 Energy Resistance
---
+90 Radiation Resistance
---
Or is it only Ballistic Resistance..?
---
Because what would be the point of Insulated or Lead Lined?
---
Hey man, don't blame me for that shit, I have problems with it, too.
---
Then I could make my own Pioneer Scout camp!
---
With blackjack and hookers!
---
Meds I think
---
No. They don't. Rng is just rng.
---
ya, maxed it two days ago :( still have 400 pounds of legendary to get rid of but tomorrow should be worth it!
---
I'm in the same boat.  I have only died once in that fight in the last couple of months and that was at the business end of a pair of scorched mirelurk queens.  Last nights run was like that opening scene in saving private ryan.  
---
I use mutants pieces wherever possible though.  Just rather have the constant bonus over one that depends on me watching my health bar cause sometimes I'm a little lazy on the upkeep lol
---
The photo challenges usually do not require the critter to be Alive for the photo...
---
Why do you think anyone cares ?
---
If I find I'm not interested in a subreddit/forum, I just don't go there anymore. I don't feel the need to inform a bunch of strangers
---
Grimd until you have the hello kitty skin.
---
Hrmm ok
---
valut suit for example
---
That's the exact reason I leave my extractor and purifiers (crops too, I suppose) open. If visitors don't see anything they like, at least they're not leaving empty-handed.
---
Arguablecoyote, hit me up.
---
Is this based off just your observations?
---
What will we ever do without you?
---
Mom, it’s my turn to post this...
---
Good to know! Such a shame no vendor sells Ultracite.
---
Yep sometimes happens when spam firing a normal tesla
---
Adding
---
While I agree with you, a glass window would not be unreasonable. It wouldn't be a fancy double pane energy efficiency model, but one big sheet of glass + 1 glass cutter + nothing better to do with down time = improv window.
---
Indeed this appears to be true. Wish I could prove the facts. At least then I could have reported the players I did kill. Never thought to do so. Figured I had ruined their day enough at that point. The suspension was was launched roughly 30 after so I had no way of remembering their names or had them in my players list. My fault.
---
It's pretty good in general. But imo the auto is by far the best for crowd control and dps out of the available mods. The charging barrels are for single powerful shots, and that's generally associated with sniping and stacking up those sneak attack criticals. That's difficult to do on a weapon with like 20 foot effective range. The automatic barrel shoots way, way faster and only has a minor damage per shot drop. Then consider the arcing damage, and it will really tear some enemies up. If not for the damage bug, my quad tesla would be the go-to weapon for pretty much everything
---
Based on common sense. And observations from 1000+ hours gameplay. Kindy silly (or stupid even) to think that Bethesda would make one server different from others.
---
If anything we need more build sets that look like crap, not pristine pre war sets. Just look at the walls we had and in 4 that were pieced together scrap metal or bits of plywood and chicken wire. Those walls had character, not like the stuff we have now that looks like perfect squares of machined metal and plywood.
---
We (crops) all float down here..
---
Oh sorry gezz
---
The best armor is not being detected.
---
So that’s where the trend came from. &gt;:/
---
Well now I know you measure all quantities by weight. Can you give me the conversion of miles per hour into grams?
---
Well I didn't expect to see **that** anomaly! &lt;3
---
Of course not. I confused it with the kill X critters challenges.
---
Cheers for the offer but I'm done with it now, but props for reaching out even though you've already got it
---
it has nothing to do with the message about bugs (a later comment by OP) or the restrictive title rules.  the downvotes i can almost guarantee are from the karma whoring "look at me" attitude of the title and only sentence put in OP
---
my psn is R200KW13BROTA666. Anyone can add me that's in the fallout76 community.
---
Ya boi stole your tse
---
Got the one from the actual quest through Fakesquatch, didn't think about the water though
---
It could easily be some bug affecting the spawn rates. It's not the first time I've seen strange things happening related to legendary spawns.
---
What is your build and level? Completing solo is realistic.
---
How do you know for sure?
---
Out of curiosity are you trying to log into adventure or survival?
---
Any proof?
---
My level 35 as handmade is still my primary gun and I'm 160+.
---
Adventure, why would that matter?
---
Why "love you"? All Bethesda has done for the last 10 years is make shitty games on outdated engines riddled with bugs and practically copy pastes of each other stripping features from fallout only to make them dlc in fallout 76.
---
Bethesda are a bunch of frauds. I'd suggest you look at Internet Historians video who does a nice compilation of the shit Bethesda does. They don't deserve your money or your love.
---
I can see this will probably be a pretty civil conversation, but your post was removed by the auto-moderator because it said, “A new bug?” for the title. That’s about as vague as it can get.
---
But, if you feel we were in error, feel free to contact us and get it overturned or get clarification on the rule,
---
So let me understand this:
---
Pre survival mode, you came upon some people that were duping. Someone shot first, someone shot second, pvp is on and there is no element of surprise. You are saying they chose to engage you while they were in the middle of a sensitive task. And, you got the better of all of them. 
---
Lies.
---
Berkely Springs Train Station?
---
I have found exiting the build menu and going right back in allows you to place it.
---
Similar thing happened to me with Defiance Has Fallen questline. It would disappear anytime i logged off. I would have to go back to Abby's Bunker and start all over until i completed the questline all on same session. 
---
You'll probably have to do the same. Do it all in one session to prevent from resetting.
---
In my case however, it also completely bypassed Recruitment Blues questline and jumped ahead to Belly of the Beast questline. So if i ever want to experience that quest or get the trophy for it, I'll have to start a new character unfortunately.
---
It's "common sense" so I guess we supposed to just know.
---
Sent request
---
That's cool for you. Btw I am not you just fyi for clarification
---
Sent request n
---
No one cares. For someone leaving you sure respond a lot, glad this sub will have one less whiner.
---
I have found exiting the build menu and going right back in allows me to place objects if that helps!
---
It doesn't. Just curious. 
---
 I thought maybe there would be a low server population on one or the other in order to log into the same server 5 times in a row
---
You are still referring to a debunked video. You keep doubling down while I'm waiting on my conversion equation.
---
Ill be on in 1 hr. See you then brother
---
It was a bug.
---
Scratch that. I *really really really* want visibility of their bug backlog so we actually know what to report
---
Oh boy oh boy oh boy
---
Some servers are affected by some kind of bug/feature that messes with the legendary spawn rate. 
---
Just 10 minutes ago I was on a server with 'messed up' spawns and about 2/3 of enemies were legendary. I did go to all the popular farming spots and the legendary spawn rate was... something else.
---
It's most probably a bug but one I won't complain about.
---
Have you tried crying about it?
---
Sounds good :)
---
No idea why this was removed as it is fallout related and don't violate the rules. Too many reports and the mod didnt go by their own rules it seems.
---
Quite.
---
What was a bug? My damage increasing when I repaired it? Then they fixed the bug?
---
Yea they nerfed it and said it was never meant to do that. Bogus I think.
---
Damage increase was a bug that got fixed in the last patch.
---
Got one from a ghoul
---
The amount of work it would take for a human to scour through all that code to confirm your story is daunting—and if they did it for you, they’d have to do it for everybody else who claims their duped items fell off a metaphorical truck. It’s just not a reasonable request. 
---
That’s especially true when you consider that they’re likely fielding hundreds or thousands of bug/exploit/service tickets from players who never did anything suspicious at all. Who would you give priority to if you were in their shoes? 
---
They said they’d contact suspended account holders after the exploits are fixed and the accounts were reinstated. Clearly, that first part hasn’t happened yet, so there’s really no reason to expect any further contact. 
---
If your story is true, it sucks that this happened to you, but you have to be able to look at the bigger picture.
---
No patch tomorrow so they won't - Tuesday is patch day, and it's starting to seem that Thursday is "remotely enable dormant stuff" day.
---
Sweet. I’ll be on later tonight.
---
It’s server specific based on my gameplay experience .
---
Not for me. Exiting and re-entering only works for me with “nothing is selected.”
---
You would think a fixed weapon would do more than a damaged one but oh well, thanks
---
OK, then do that and stop playing for the rest of the day.
---
I just assumed Bethesda was color blind.
---
username checks out
---
Some of these problems have been around forever so i doubt they will get fixed. I have never been able to hit the sbq while in vats with my super sledge. I just stand there like an idiot and have to cancel vats to swing. Flying creatures were due to the last patch. Doesn’t seem very high on the priority list but you guys have no problems releasing mohawks and patching things that benefit the player.  Stacking foundations, using rugs, campfires, etc. The list is long.....
---
You have put out some good additions but some CORE gameplay things still don’t work after 6 months, or longer. Hell, half of the events and new stuff don’t even work right.
---
Where is your list? You never acknowledge issues that you know about until the community brings it up multiple times. The little things seem to get fixed but the real issues remain broken. :(
---
Patiently waiting....
---
I totally agree. Idk why they would change it even if it was a bug or not intentional.
---
Could see that being possible on either depending on time of day but this was mid afternoon on the weekend. Still, there should be zero chance of being placed back in the world you were just in.
---
Everyone knows the apex predator is the Yao Guai
---
No I totally understand. 3 months iand counting is a long time to be waiting on a fix though.
---
Cool, see ya then
---
Any horde event brings much xp also if you have decent weapons doing a quick run round white springs is quick ex plus a legendary or 2. Take over workshops you dont have to put anything down just taking them over and popping back to defend it earns xp and plans. Probabily much more out their but when i was a lower level i just kept bouncing from event to event all give good xp and theirs foods that double it which help too
---
Quick tip... store your junk
---
And why they removed one of the bugs that only benefitted builders and had no negative ingame effects.
---
Have you tried reading?
---
Event: Uranium fever, at the mine by the whitespring station.
---
That happened to me, but it was because my generator had been destroyed and the rubble was not showing up
---
No I did not my bad
---
sorry my bad should have elaborated. If you use explosive weapons, demo expert its a must but also adrenaline and nerd rage and then just put any extra points in stuff that buffs dmg and damage resistance.
---
My .50 BoS rifle loaded itself with .308 and refused to fire today.
---
First time I've encountered that before.
---
Sounds like you're glad this sub is less active and have judged me based on nothing. Grade a whiner in Prometheus.
---
as they say, it's not what you know, its what you can prove in court lol
---
so no, nothing that would be concreate.  all i can say is that my wifes tse pistol is no longer explosive.
---
And I was just logging in, lol.
---
Agreed.  I find it hard to believe that there would be only 24 players on at 1 time on either mode though. 
---
 I only plan adventure so I don't know how Full or  unfull the survival mode is.
---
This is such a simple thing, but so awesome. They could even apply a "wasteland" font to the whole thing
---
Havnt heard anything different so ya! 👍🏼
---
And I’m fairly sure grogs only repair to 100% and cannot be over repaired that’s also a bug
---
Ahah had it easy, he had to hunt a big whale. I have to hunt a giant hell bag with a hive mind virus.
---
So far, yes.
---
You've designed a solution that sounds great but you've done it assuming a new system. They'd be doing this working on whatever cursed 8+ year old claptrap codebase this game is built on
---
Part of the tourist quest right? There’s a small room open on the top floor but I can’t remember there being anything interesting.
---
What good is furious, when you can 1hit everything? xD
---
No that’s something they fixed too. You can do 200 now
---
Maybe? The strangest thing I've seen is enemies double spawning legendary weapons. It was like a 2 for 1 sale I wasn't complaining. This was most likely a server issue.
---
Ahh righto I haven’t used 2 handed melees in ages since I’m a pvp player
---
Haha, they are tedious.  But overall not that hard.  I just finished it.
---
Gonna be like Black Friday. Oh, the lines!
---
Maybe I’ll camp out at Berkeley Springs tonight.
---
It basically is, he isn’t hostile like other cats you can get, and he respawns whenever he dies so he’s better then tame-able cats
---
Guess you didn't read very carefully
---
I don’t know of any discord’s or chats, but if you haven’t used the Looking For Group posts on Xbox they are really useful. That’s where I see if people are nuking or killing the SBQ, and other events.
---
I play in Australia aswell mate.
---
Did you make this same complaint about similiar Skyrim quests? Fallout 4? Even the community god New Vegas?
---
Ya, I would honestly be done with them by now but I’ve just been putting them off because they’re not fun.
---
I've gotten around this by screen shoting the recent list before I take a workshop.
---
I've lost the workshop I took when I rejoin though.
---
What do you use
---
 I would love some of the modular buildings you see - like the green "home" at the morgantown airport. A nice prefab building - it would be awesome to have a whole set of these prefab units to build with.
---
Thanks thought that might be what I needed to do.
---
Especially when you got a fat pig barking orders all the time
---
The mesmetron. It'd be a great way to great newbies fresh out the vault.
---
Right hopefully people will be civilized about it and form a line, instead of a battle of spam interact
---
No, because I’ve never had his experience in any of those games, and have played them all extensively.
---
I’ve got over 15 builds ranging from crit revolver pistol builds with weightless Sentinal to Sent/ass Legacy gat plasmas  heavy gunner builds
---
Cool I'm in CA USA, I think it's the morning there ya?
---
I believe it’s The Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage, also known as the Berkeley Castle, is located on a hill above Berkeley Springs, West Virginia. The castle-like house was built for Colonel Samuel Taylor Suit of Washington, D.C. as a personal retreat near the spa town, beginning in 1885
---
Lol sry I just google it out of curiosity
---
Dude, this is nothing. Check out any other mmo if you wanna see what a real grind is. If every new best in slot item they make gets dropped into your lap immediately the game won't last long.
---
I just got back from defensive driving.... haha
---
Gonna keep updooting the conveyor of these posts daily
---
This. 3 legendaries can’t be beat. Pretty simple too. Also a crap ton of titanium scrap and glowing meat if that’s your thing.
---
What in the? For real? Lol
---
Don’t bother trying to explain yourself on reddit....either way it’s not right for Bethesda to not make a statement or respond.
---
Yea man, I don’t play MMO’s for that exact reason. I’m not saying they’ve gotta drop it in my lap,just not hide it behind some boring ass, tedious ass, trivia ass world challenges, ya dig?
---
(software has bugs sometimes)
---
I can’t see what rules this would’ve violated to justify removal. It was a respectful and well articulated argument—one I happen to disagree with on several key points, and totally agree with on others. It’s very disappointing that the community hasn’t been able to see and discuss it.
---
I'm curious what you think you ought to be doing?
---
I've just ignored it beyond going to the lake and talking to that robot, I just can't be bothered to read that to-do list in challenges working for the Ticks and Atoms. I don't need a backpack anyway, was that the quality of life thing you mentioned?
---
Agreed.  Terrible change.  Given up on playing survival for a while.
---
Some games have best in slot items that take months of daily grinding to get, with no way to bypass. You can get these backpacks in less than a days work. A couple hours if you Google everything.
---
Knowing that this is a Fallout game, I won't deny the possibility of this being a bug. Probably the weirdest I've heard of so far.
---
I got that last night. Had to log out as I had no more ability to store, scrip or sell!
---
Typical reddit user.
---
Thanks for your assumptions and input. 
---
If you don't work for or are affiliated with bethesda .. have a nice day.
---
As someone who's done that by accident, I'm sorry. That's why my Instigating Black Powder Rifle stays at camp when I go to Uranium Fever from now on.
---
Those are basically the facts, yes! :)
---
I dont think that will be an issue people only have 1000 scrit  to spend that will go quick
---
I doubt these were even close to the top of the to dupe list
---
Yeah color them americans in knowledge! CANADA ALL DAY BBY
---
It was, im basically trapped in power armor because my stash is full of bobble heads and magazines waiting for the display stands to be released, which sucks because I’ve got a full unyielding bloody build I’d like to be able to play with. 
---
And ya I’ve been avoiding them up until this point but I’ve decided I need the extra carry weight offered by the backpack so I’m gritting my teeth playing through them
---
God dam and I thought I was going insane, I really must read the patch notes but I don't have the time as I'm playing Fallout 76.
---
I just kept collecting crap legendaries and walking around over encoumbered hoping for a good drop it didn't happen
---
Omg holy shit that would be amazing
---
Typical duper- have a nice ban.
---
I did and this is how I decided to handle it. May you guys either learn from my glitch, ya know, somehow, without asking about it or anything, or not.
---
Really they just need to scan the accounts in there current state looking for 100k quantity....even 10k be ok. Bug not base the suspension on any 30 day period ...that was really stupid of them. So many people got caught out from just picking up bags in situations where you just quick collect. This is what Bethesda did wrong and is causing so many headaches.
---
I’m 40 my GT is HollowRoxyJon Xbox.
---
That's some seriously delusional thinking there, bud ;) You were right and "won" because you were wrong?
---
Did a lot of research on this months ago. The plan is a random reward (small chance) from raider quests (Rose) and events around that raider themed area like Uranium Fever. I got mine from Rose with my third toon. From the 4 different mods/upgrades to raider underarmors, first 2 can be bought from vendors and best two (shielded being best) are drops/rewards. I havent't noticed or heard of any changes to this.
---
I tried miners monument repeatedly with no success then found one when I ended up at the mothman museum via nukashine...
---
I’m just looking forward to turning it into 6 3star pipe pistols tmrw!
---
Snakybois.
---
It got my message out there and frustrated me enough to never use this sub after this post so there's that.
---
Honestly?
---
In my own personal experience if a spot has a 3* legendary like west tek when they respawn it most of the time will be another 3*. Sometimes it's a lower * enemy. 
---
Normally once I find a "hot" server I keep farming the spot till I can't anymore either by respawning on the same server or just doing other stuff till they respawn which feels like 20-30mins.
---
Need? Nah. Getting plenty of? Oh yeah. Thanks by the way for stopping by.
---
I'm Curious what time it's gonna come out tomorrow?   Are they gonna patch her in or they can do some "Flip the switch" magic on the servers at a certain time.
---
Yea  it's almost as bad as getting the runaround at the DMV......oh...wait.....that was a questline too.
---
I don’t care if other games have bad game design, and I shouldn’t have to do *work* in a video game. This is my vacation from work. I want to have fun when I play, so I put these things off. A lot of other people do too.
---
Funny thing is, we were never banned to begin with, you obviously never read or understood the situation so please brush up on your English comprehension. Haha ;)
---
Have a nice day!
---
Lol yes this is the most likely scenario
---
On 5 characters lol.
---
Just remove all tse
---
Yeah. I fast traveled into someone's locked house yesterday and like an idiot, I picked the lock to get out. Of course I got hit with a bounty. At least I had time to stash my junk before someone showed up to kill me.
---
How do you feed an attention whore? Why stoop down and start name calling. Not much else will keep them around!
---
Oh yeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah
---
Hahahha EXACTLY! That shit was so stupid, this honestly one ups it though because it’s much more tedious and much more extensive. It’s ridiculous Bethesda forsure have their heads up their asses.
---
A pessimist is never disappointed. ;)
---
I mean he’s kinda not wrong 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I've done it every day like clockwork since December. I play every day. My main is 470 before it got banned in February. My new main is level 350. 
---
Marine tactical helmet. Craft 35 with super duper. Easiest method I found. 
---
It's way easier now that you only have to visit 1 vendor. I visited 7 per day, every day.
---
 The metal stairs from the Atom Shop clip through non-foundation floors. 500 Atoms well spent...
---
I've experienced this ONCE and it was wild. The loot was good but it was frickin fun.
---
The same person who gets upset at being killed in a video game by another player...in a game about killing and taking whatever u want in the post apocalyptic wasteland
---
If it's a product of RNG, then it is somehow server wide. Perhaps there is a value assigned to the legendary spawn rate that is somehow rolled via RNG when it's launched?
---
I understand that game play experience is at best anecdotal, but the sample size on hours played for some of the folks that will tell you that there are server wide anomalies relating to the rate at which legendary enemies are spawned is pretty vast. That's a lot of hours of observation, not all of which is biased or otherwise flawed.
---
I also believe there are observable trends with what types of legendary items are dropped. There will be entire game play sessions on a single server where most of the people I'm playing with will report receiving common legendary prefixes and item categories. For instance, we might all be getting a high rate of ghoul slayers gear, of all variety - or we might all be getting a high rate of .44 handguns of varying legendary prefix.
---
There is some sort of value that leads to a pattern, whether it is born out in frequency or type. If they are solely the product of RNG they are perhaps even more anomalous.
---
Just my $. 02
---
I know..  you get all sorts of keyboard warriors like this one above that ride high horses all day, but know have zero knowledge about anything Haha... 
---
I've been trying to message them all this time and they just ignore every single message .. obviously no shortage of replies here Haha.. too bad it wasn't from anybody competent Haha
---
Bethesda is wonderful and Todd Howard is golden god......... Cha-Ching! 
---
*receives free atoms*
---
THIS. PLEASE.
---
I'm playing exactly that, an Unyealding Bloodied build it's greta fun just one piece of Chameleon I swap in and out, I love the Strength increase for melee damage. Are you saying you can't afford just 10 wieght to , I'm really looking fortward to display stands, I love them in Fallout 4.
---
Doing a bunch of chores. I’m not gonna write out the whole chore list for you if you want to know look at the world challenges.
---
I read it twice just to make sure I fully absorbed the content and although the initial impact was good, I just felt it lacked substance.  In addition you really should have expected feedback given you’ve posted this thread on a public forum. Anyway, have a wonderful day.
---
Yeah at Whitesprings at that
---
Getting it as a random reward from the SBQ makes sense.  I don't always get it, and me noticing it during a whitespring nuke run might be coincidence.  I typically see whitespring nuke drops after SBQ drops, it's like people wind down from the boss fight with some mindless farming.
---
I also have crazy latency, and frequently don't get the onscreen notifications for loot, so it's very possible  I just miss it and don't notice it until much later.
---
You do get something but it’s a weird number. Don’t know the exact percentage but I’ve had people buy 300 ammo (1 cap each) and I’d end up with around 40 caps instead of 270.
---
I had this idea posted as well! I got a dev response so hope!
---
to get a large xp bonus and extra challenges without actually having to pvp ofcourse!
---
I’ve got a lot of cool weapons and armor and junk. Just a lot of shit in general.
---
I think they've added an interesting reward for change my game play style. I don't get into crafting much, so it's added a reason to try new things.  A bit tedious for somethings yes, but overall fairly entertaining
---
I’d rather have it than not, but I lol’d
---
Mine too. I had to remove the foundation it was on and it went into storage. I actually think one if my workbenches was "using" it, because occasionally when I approached that bench, I would get the prompt to use the statue, even though it was a ways away.
---
I've had it a few times at this point. With the actual drops being complete RNG, having such a large amount of legendary enemies sure helps quite a bit. Hell, if that world I was in earlier didn't have to shut down for maintenance I'd still be there farming legendaries all over the map.
---
When I shop at people camps and they have their main house locked I try to break in (marsupial + jetpack is amazing) and leave a "You have been insulted!" note.
---
Then you played with your eyes close. ESPECIALLY skyrim.
---
if your on xbox i got one with swing speed and plus endurance
---
No no you must have missed the primary content. In case you missed it posting with primary content in the title or post was getting taken down so the mods seem to think if I'm saying I'm leaving it can stay up but if I'm talking about a new bug I have seen that's too vague.
---
ah ok
---
Name one example, and I’ll tell you how it didn’t bother me.
---
oh fuck i just realized i have the day off on the same day as the update! im a happy raider
---
That's exactly what I was thinking too. It's not the first time I experienced something alike but this time... it was just too much. And it does make sense that people wouldn't complain about a beneficial bug. Thanks for sharing your opinion.
---
There is a glitch that eats possum badges I *was* investigating.
---
I have a pathalogical hatred of 20 questions, crosswords, pub quizzes etc,
---
I still need the brick set but i never make enough caps
---
I am on xbox. Are you on right now?
---
So, other than that how do you like the update?
---
Yea I’m finally workin towards it right now, because I’m trapped in power armor.
---
Indeed. Like I mentioned .. I dont even have the items that seemed me to be suspended. So why is my account suspended only to be reinstated once the items in question are removed. 
---
Makes zero sense. That's all I'm asking is for them to do a quick look to see that I legitimately do not have these items as they claim ..
---
Let me put it this way 
---
Other than this, *what is the update?*
---
be careful giving out in game names this sub has a rule against witch hunting
---
PSN = MyTurkishPrison
---
Where did they move the 5.56mm spawn that used to occur near Welch?
---
All it took was a couple of YouTube videos to nix that. I used to get 60-70 5.56mm ammo on daily spawn.
---
&gt;Really they just need to scan the accounts in there current state looking for 100k quantity....even 10k be ok
---
They did this and removed multiples of Items and used said data to ban players.
---
No offense but it's hard to believe you when every "when are banned players being reinstated" post tells the same story.
---
I found it yesterday from a cranberry bog treasure map. Was really surprised. 
---
Also found dense raider plan on a mega sloth corpse near a fissure site.
---
Usually they put a servers will be taken down message. That’s why I thought it was gonna get pushed back
---
Even if they can't do log cabins are custom-built, at least include premades (sort of like how they do the tents).
---
That also happens when a player dies to the legendary. I have tested it trying to promote a 2 stars into a 3 stars inside west tek and then he dropped 2 legendary items at once, first time I ever saw that.
---
I’m glad you enjoyed then
---
lol thats a buddy of mine hes killed 54 ppl lol its funny
---
Mages guild resources gather.
---
Well I have mules but only one of my characters is lvl 50+ so that's the only one I will get lvl 50 items for trading in
---
I have seen on here that that challenge is bugged
---
As excited as I am to cash in the script I've gotten so far in hopes of getting Phat L3wt my concern is that the level of the legendary items might also be random.
---
The excitement of getting a Zealot's assault rifle with 25% faster fire and faster movement while aiming... turn sour when I see that it's only level 30...
---
he didnt do anything wrong just frowned upon
---
that's not really what I was implying
---
You just built a junk extractor at your camp 😈
---
My favorite is hopping in through the windows on a craft bench or couch 😂
---
bugs everywhere?
---
You won’t get a reply....but I think it’s good for those affected to keep it alive ......many innocent where affected, Bethesda where lazy in method. Reality is, the servers they use will always allow duping so until they change them nothing will change. It’s on Bethesda to fix, its beyond a community issue to fix.
---
traps go off when they get power so its not hard to wire them to a switch
---
If u dont find someone in 30 to 40 mins I can revive u. Already have it done myself.
---
Remind me what that was? You had to go around and collect stuff? I’d say it wasn’t a big deal because fast travel was free and it was an actual quest given by fully voiced NPCs with actual purpose behind it other than collect merit badges to be a possum scout. It felt cool as rewarding and like I was doing it for a reason. It was a part of the story so I was willing to do it. Plus the gameplay was better IMO, and so it never once felt tedious. It wasn’t a seemingly endless chores list that requires in game resources to go after.
---
ah thought that would, cool thanks.. now to find a nuke zone
---
that opens the door to killing yourself on punji boards then killing the owner of the camp for no reason
---
no damage is probably the better route
---
I have the email from them which states and I quote ... 
---
 " this account's access to Fallout 76 has been suspended until such time as this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. "..
---
Don't know why you would say it's hard to believe when every player affected was sent this email ..
---
Shredded. 
---
And yes, user name checks out.
---
According to a mod the post is fishing for likes. Apparently free speech is now fishing
---
It sounds to me like you just shouldn't be playing 76.
---
P.s. I'd understand about my post getting taken down due to possibly being spam... if this sub had more content.
---
no i might be on in like 5 or 6 hours when i get home r u paying in caps?
---
All that proves is that the items aren’t there anymore. It doesn’t conclude one way or the other whether or not they were duped in the first place. They could’ve easily been duped, then traded sold or used. 
---
Everybody who gets caught cheating has an excuse or story. I’m sure a handful are true, but most are certainly not.
---
Happens to me all the time with foundations. Like just a single foundation by itself with nothing else placed in the entire camp area and it says scrapping it will make something else inaccessible. I have to do the same thing, move my entire camp and start over every time it happens.
---
I will my good man, as soon as Bethesda fixes  my "Disconnected From Server" issue...
---
Believe me about what? What assumptions you making lol. Also you need to re read what Im saying as you are talking about something else.
---
Honestly I hope I never reach end game. Then what will I have to talk about? What will I have to do? This has been the best little hobby I’ve found that requires little to no effort. Just a way to destress and pass the time. There’s so much stress and commitment in just LIVING that I’m really happy to do this for a few hours a week and nothing else. 
---
But to answer your question kinda more specifically: do whatever you want on any particular day. If you want to pick a role and play it out, then work toward that goal. If you want to level up, then work toward that goal. If you want to grind for components, then work toward that goal. The possibilities are seriously endless and that is one of many reasons why I love this game.
---
me too
---
Plans I don't know yet (so rare ones), rare outfits, violet flux for 250c or less, good armor and guns.
---
I appreciate that you feel aggrieved and the initial post you are now referencing definitely sounds like something worthy of discussion, however this thread is about you leaving the sub, which you haven’t done. You’re clearly just attention seeking now so I would recommend either leaving as you had said was your intention or apologise to the people here for wasting their time and not keeping to your word.
---
Sneak perks. Marsupial to hop on top of something when needed.
---
same
---
Yeah, if I'm still looking for it by then. How much?
---
There is and it's a world find Plan, not one you can learn, I think a few vendorbots sell it now, actually.
---
Hey thanks heaps I'll check it out tonight
---
Yea it's 934am to be precise lol
---
BS imposed a lock on your account preventing you from playing the game. I would call that a ban.
---
Perhaps I have misunderstood the meaning of word. Feel free to set me straight.
---
I am having a nice day, thanks!
---
I found this glitch to be super fun, (click, where did the turret go? Oh it’s now above me inside the street. Welp that’s something I’ll never get back.)
---
Imagine if FO4 was updated to include some dialogue about his generous pen-pals in Appalachia. Could even say something like how he's still receiving transmissions and letters from them as a hopeful sign that our characters settled the area.
---
lol true say - not nearly as bad as a 3\* two shot .50 cal that id just got from my wife and i accidentally dropped it on teh floor in blind panic and it disspeared.
---
that was a bad day lol
---
agreed. perhaps made stilts for them so they are functional?
---
No, that's a ban email I believe that.
---
Every player says they picked up a stack of duped goods from a paper loot bag  which is your story and everyone says that. Please understand the difference.
---
LOL karma whoring. As though I didn't know this would be recieved negatively? More like shitty community with proof in the downvotes for actual content that was already taken down because leaving is more clear than having a bug. But what do I know, I'm just OP.
---
I would recommend selling meds and other sellable goods just a little below what players can sell them for at vendors. I buy everything I can from player vendors that I know I can flip for quick caps.
---
I would thumbs up this a million times if I could
---
Just move on. Temporary suspension is just a different way to say perma banned. 
---
I bought a new account a week after being banned and started from fresh. I never expect to see my original account again. It's shitty but there's literally nothing we can do.
---
Use Nukes and Dragons to model your character build. Under level 50 focus more on where you spend your SPECIAL points as opposed to choosing cards.  Saves a lot of time post level 50 moving points around to fit a card into your build.
---
Thanks man I did check both watoga vendors but nothing no plan or mod,but maybe today it's refreshed ;)
---
K bye.
---
Was it possible for Bethesda to restore your character? 
---
I've been playing the same character since BETA. Just recently started back up about a week ago and got addicted to the game again. I'd hate to get this glitch, lose absolutely everything and have it be impossible to fix.
---
idk what they go for 10k?
---
If you can build advanced weapons you can build clean walls
---
I have the head on xbox if youre on there
---
I am level like 240 or something and honestly I just do whatever I want and if I need something there’s ways to get specific things so it’s really whatever all the time
---
Oh these were most definitely duplicated I'm not denying this.. If I had seen the stack of them before hand I would have left it. Cant turn back time Haha
---
Well I mean just look at New Vegas. There was a tribe that mimicked Ulysses' dreadlocks. Plus wasn't there some old tribes in the area as referenced by the knowledge exams?
---
Well you aren’t the one that downvoted me I bet!  Geesh. Tough crowd.
---
Then don't build one, what we have is not your concern focus on your own crappy shack
---
Those who duped would still be holding more than 10k or even 100k....dam even 1mil at the time of suspension.  It let’s just make it 10k as no duped would have less than that even the most petty of duper’s or duper’s miles or friends of duper’s or even person who knows a duper or even know what duper means...lol
---
Hahaha idk what they go for. I didnt even know you could have 10,000 caps haha holy shit
---
Oh yeah that would be nice. I personally use a macro I made with my Steam controller, but it's still slow when you have a ton of meat due to the delay they implemented to avoid server instability.
---
That would be good
---
Last night my fiancé was playing. She built a set of stairs and attached a floor piece. Then she put another set of stairs on the other side (for the record I have no idea what she was going for but the rest of the base was awesome). When she went to tear it down because it didn’t do what she wanted it to it wouldn’t let her. Literally two stairs and a floor piece. I tried attaching things to it to see if it would change and then those pieces were stuck as well. It was just confusing.
---
Did they throw Timmy down the well?
---
Yes they’ve been restored within 24 hours twice now. I originally didn’t know what was happening but now I think I know because each time a similar set of circumstances happened to the character
---
I like putting windows over my purifiers and extractors... Just gotta reach in and.... *cuts an artery on the broken pane*
---
Reading is hard.
---
Would also be nice to be able to set the stairs on the side of the foundations as well or get some 1x2 and 1x1 of the atom shop floors.
---
Oh, well... ups.
---
It literally doesn’t force you to do anything at any moment
---
yeh thats not even the most expensive item out there by a long shot but ive got a 1\* bloodied one u can have for 500 caps if u want aswell
---
When I leave my house I block it off with a foundation. Good luck to them.
---
Yea I’ve had the same gamer tag in the lower left corner saying that they are talking even though I’ve hopped into different servers
---
I agree. I still think Survival and Adventure should require two separate characters. I am about to start up a Survival only character, mainly for that 20% XP bonus that should hopefully make the Main Quest less of a grind.
---
Also didn't they patch the game to get rid of exposing you on the map for staying alive too long??? 
---
I thought they changed it to how many kills you had...
---
But you can’t craft at their base unless you’re teamed up :(
---
with all the things we can do at the workbenches you'd think it wouldn't be too hard to sew the dress into a nice pant suit, or a sports jacket or a respectable cardigan for Pete's sake and run as the Mister of Mystery! :)
---
Some don't have any real noticeable side effects, like Marsupial, Electrically charged, plague walker, herbivore/carnivore.
---
Is this subreddit just a Dear Bethesda subreddit now?
---
I told you what I judged you on, you're obsessive need to bitch and your whole "woe is me" attitude. You're pathetic dude, hurry up and leave like you said you were going to do so we won't have to hear from such a whiny brat.
---
hey i need help with it too. i can help.
---
I'm not on PC, bit one thing that comes to mind is your audio setting for chat. For me on PS4, every time I log on (maybe even server hop), the slider bar for chat in audio settings is all the way at zero. I turn it back up, and later when I log againn. It's back down.
---
So that could be what it is.
---
Hopefully build a community with an active sub because you sure as heck didn't do that when I was there.
---
It's my post. I already left your sub. Learn how reddit works jesus fing xmas.
---
On after work?
---
What a pointless post. Did you think this through before posting this? Maybe you should save your karma from the huge tank its taking and delete the post before the damage becomes worse. I believe you already got more than 100 downvotes. Save yourself
---
needed more cow bell.
---
I was the same way for a while, but those other options dont do anything (usually) to increase your damage, and if they do, its usually just 5% or niche use.  Even playing casually as enemies go up on level they get harder to kill, so you will want your damage to keep pace with their hp pools.
---
Do you prefer to play like a sniper and kill at range, or dobyou run-and-gun?
---
Bye Felicia.
---
So people don't like level 50 legendaries?
---
Would also be great if you could put stairs in the center of 2 foundations... vs having 2 sets and a gap between them.
---
My theory is that the maintenance is due to the farming. Because when I farm WS too hard (before the legendary vendor exchange) and I put too many legendary items in the ice box the server would start to take a dump. 
---
This happen quickly when one of the ghouls kept giving me several 1* items. It was 5-8 items each time. That server died pretty quickly which made me decide to stop leaving the legendaries for other people.
---
 I wasn't trying to contribute to server instability and I guess no good deed goes unpunished.
---
Then invite me to a party whenever you are on.
---
Look at the "new" tab. Its pretty active. You really dont seem to have a point.
---
Go to the rant section on craigslist. Maybe someone cares there
---
It seems to happen most often while in vats
---
They fixed that with this patch as well
---
What platform?
---
my prices are cheap and my water even cheaper!
---
come find me near the legendary vendor on PS4 - madmitchell79
---
i’m on now. gimme one sec. Also mic doesn’t work
---
One of my turrets is currently guarding my base inside the road. My base is in the sewers and it glitched just above me so I can’t get access to it above or below. So... I ain’t getting that shit back, that’s for sure.
---
If I cared I *obviously* wouldn't have posted. Is this even a real question?
---
I got the same thing. Legendary lvl1 chicken. Dropped an assassins pool cue. Not really sure where the chicken had that hidden.
---
Yet here you are jackass. Shoo,  shoo.
---
Bugs as in insects or glitches? I guess I’ve  Noticed an increase in both?
---
one can wish but if the old player vending taught me anything...this is gonna suck
---
Must be your secondary reddit account you slip up? Or not.🤔🤔🤔You sound like the OP anyways the OP which obviously isn't you doing damage control for downvotes but anyways
---
&gt;However in one of these bags was a large stack of items. So at that moment I was immediately flagged and my account was suspended when they launched the suspension. 
---
OP who's definitely not you🤔 Wrote that same old paper bag story. So what requires re-reading and who's making assumptions. 
---
I assume nothing you wrote that and it's just like almost every single I've been banned post.
---
Bye :)
---
Touche'
---
Xbox one.
---
Guess you lack reading comprehension skills .. here I win copy and paste it again for you to read. It says "suspended until such time" 
---
Not banned indefinitely... learn to read lil girl  Haha 
---
"this account's access to Fallout 76 has been suspended until such time as this issue is fixed in a future patch. Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. "
---
You think by saying that I'm banned triggers me bahahaha .. listen lil girl I got 2 TVs and 2 consoles. Not too worried about losing access to one of many accounts. Although it's annoying (like you) to have to change accounts .. I still have full access to play the game and troll dummies like you! ;) 
---
now go away or I shall taunt you a second time. ;)
---
By far the most annoying issue I deal with on this game. I always forget to turn it up until someone is trying to talk to me.
---
Nice job, cool pix! Not to make this post about myself, but...I used to use PA for the ISQ cryptid event but now I'm using 5 pieces of Troubleshooter's armor, two of which are Sentinel (I'm in the marked for the other three). I use a Vampire's Cryolator and just soak up the damage and slow it's attacks down considerably. When I get melee'd my health dips like 5% so I don't have to use too many stimpaks.
---
I provide the recall card but ask that everyone else activate the pylons due to me taking the bulk of the damage from the ISQ.
---
I joke over area chat that the attacks tickle :-)
---
long rep, so bear with me

Caps
---
* When I know I am near a vendor, I hold off on scrapping random weapons I pick up, for a few extra caps. =&gt; *good strat, also sell excess stimpak, you wont need more than 10 at a time and they are easy to come by*
---
* For the time being, I have some space in my build, so I keep the "search for chems" perk equipped, since I think that chems have a pretty efficient weight-to-value ratio. =&gt; *good strat, no further comment*
---
* is there some other obvious source of income I am ignoring? =&gt; *well.. selling legendary gears ?* :) ; or *excess ammo to players (556, shotgun shell, 45, 5mm)*
---
I just set the price at whatever it pops up at.
---
I have curtains so that doesn't work.
---
Fun part is when picking to go to another server loads you into the same one again. It did it multiple times in a row before so I force closed the game and tried from menu and finally got a new one. Isn't from being a populated spot, just sometimes the game refuses to let you server hop. It's easier to notice now with player vendors around.
---
If you are not in a hurry (to spend huge amounts of caps or trade expensive items to get it), there will be a survival weekly reward coming in 3 weeks that you might like..

Yes I actually have two max level explosive pipes, both dropped by nuked WS glowing ones. One is a bolt action the other an auto .38. Before the TSE nerf even the .38 was way fun. Dupers ruined it all for us. Haven’t used them for a long time.
---
Nah not tonight. Im gonna hit the gym after but It's a public holiday tommorow "Friday" so I'll be on then and all weekend.
---
Thats understandable, I've been putting off organic solution since the beta. i don't know why you got downvoted for this.
---
That would be awesome
---
It is something related to aspect ratio. My friend with 16:10 have this things, and I dont have it with 16:9. As I can see, you have 16:10 resolution. You can try to set 16:9 resolution (1280x720 for example), if it is possible with windowed mode, and check if this dashes are gone.
---
If they had fun doing this that’s cool for them, I’m sure they also had fun during the DMV quest
---
weird b/c i haven't had the issue until today.  3 disconnects within about an hour on xbox. id get a server not responding msg, then drop.
---
Cool brother, hit me up, I'm Friday and Saturday
---
Your like a heroin addict. We all see the damage your doing to yourself. Just stop before its too late !
---
Off
---
Super Duper is amazing when it procs for Flux, even better if you used Green Thumb to harvest it...you can get a lot of Stable Flux with this combo.
---
Glitches lol. Ghouls not getting up is a big one.
---
Ive noticed my chat volume is always down. Now, Even if i turn it up the next server i join it will be muted again.
---
If I really want to keep people out I just pull up the build menu and replace the door with a solid wall. No items by the windows that you can interact with and problem solved.
---
The gear isn't that important, it's the build. You can go through everything the game has right now without relying on any legendary weapons. Find something you like and stick with it. Use the best perks for that setup, etc. Look into mutations that might help too. With player vending, it's pretty easy to find serums at a few hundred caps a pop. People are also selling decent legendaries at relatively low prices
---
Lmfao in what universe? Last time I checked they each have 2 different meanings especially how they indicated to us in the email I have excerpted from. 
---
You may have given up, that's your prerogative. I have not.
---
Thanks for your input, have a nice day!
---
I play with a steady but rotating group of players. I'm sure you'll meet plenty of people to group up with.
---
I don't understand at all. Can you say that using different words?
---
Did all the parts of the challenge get ticked off?
---
It shows up under Misc.  I sell serums in my vending machine and the game says I'm selling 0 Meds, but plenty of Misc items.
---
Right? That has to be a bug. I just manually quit then restart. Fixed the problem 99% of the time.
---
Go kick rocks along with him
---
Oh yea I mean I guess I’ve seen more bugs. Mainly just 2 crashes to dashboard versus none for a few months prior.
---
Ok at least it is possible to get it fixed though this kind of bug needs to he addressed IMMEDIATELY. Especially since you had to deal with this twice.
---
I just realized no I didn’t do the pass athlete knowledge exam
---
pulp fiction.
---
You're welcome.
---
Where would that be
---
Come on, the dmv was a good laugh. It was too accurate. It was a quality troll of a quest. This is less of a laugh because merit badges aren't this complicated to earn, but equally pointless.
---
How would you know? I can’t find where they come up on data.
---
I was expecting this to be a joke about Colonel Gutsy. Glad I was wrong because this photo is amazing!
---
ok ill hold it for u and message u when im on next
---
Reply with what build you have and I may be able to help. I have a rifle, pistol, shotgun, and melee build that can help as well as basic help. I'd recommend getting at least 3 endurance so you can get max level cannibal perk. Once you get level 30 try grinding for mutations or buy them with starched genes maxed out (2 luck). I would recommend the pack mule perk (3 strength) as well as it help no matter what. If you collect junk alot then get the perk to reduce the weight of that as well, pack rat (strength again I believe).
---
Here is a trick I learned on my third play through, kinda specific but hey, worked wonders for me. Grind out 1800 caps one way or another (we won’t judge ;) and get yourself to the Whitesprings. In the health clinic find the free states vendor. Buy the handmade plans. If you haven’t already get level three of gunsmith. Start cranking out handmades and scrap for the mods. You can do this from level 15 and they are way more powerful than anything that will drop at that level. Alternatively when doing the main quest be sure to do the side quest motherlode to get the plans for the combat rifle. You can start building and scrapping them at level 20. Both of these will make it easier to deal with enemies.
---
I’ll be on again in the morning if you still need help. Psn is brm138
---
Leaving a bad review over what you think is high prices is entitlement. Just refuse service. You are not owed anything.
---
Yelp, a lot of bad reviews are put on there, because entitled people leave reviews. Happy people just come back. Also the racket of them hiding good ones for money. Its a skewed unfair system. 
---
If you disagree with a product you leave, you should never be offended at prices as everyone uses different reasons and values.
---
An item is worth something only when it’s sold, not before.
---
Awesome. Thank you
---
Can you send a message from their player pip on the map like xbox?
---
That’s how I got mine, lol
---
Messaging randos
---
I agree entirely. The dmv was at least slightly funny.
---
No it's not a "ban" email ... it's a "suspension" email .. it is very clear. Please read it. Regardless of what "you believe" I'm going on facs I have been provided by the game manufacturer themselves.

Theres also bugs while shooting near any object. If something is close to you the bullets just go in crazy directions there was a post here about it earlier but an easy test is grab a gatling laser and get near the edge of a fence and the shots dont even look like they come out of the gun anymore.
---
In the Fallout universe, there is a divergent timeline around the 1950s in which America takes on an isolationist stance and majorly promotes scientific advancement. This isolationism on the global stage as well as sole focus on scientific advancement causes cultural advancement to stagnate. This is why it is possible for the music, art, food, architecture, and styles of the 1950s to still be part of American culture a hundred years later. So what you’ll have in terms of ethnic hairstyles is what you saw from ethnic people of those times. Something to keep in mind.
---
Go into your search bar on this sub.  Type in “cap stash list”.  Same with Mappalachia.  There you go.

While we're on the topic of hair I wish haircuts weren't locked for each gender. Some of the male cuts would look really great on the girls and some of the  hair cuts that the gals have would look really good on the dudes.
---
I'm pretty sure people would want to know about glitches that can remove possum badges and my post about that was removed so *I* am not removing the one post I made about it that got through the dumb auto mod. If these people are dumb enough [and they are] to downvote me  and ignore and not read about the glitch then that's their bad. Anyone else can learn about it while this post stays up, I'd be hurting people I don't want to hurt by taking this post down.
---
I currently have a foundation stuck underwater with no way to select it and scrap. Even going underwater and looking right at it, I can't remove it.
---
Happy to join the roster if you feel so inclined.
---
Same issue here
---
A letter from about 200 years ago (ghoulifucation maybe) and new voice lines for kent would be nice something to spice things up and maybe an event could take place where you help the robot (unstoppibot could be a name a play on the unstoppibles) get to a point on the map for comic books for kent and you have to fight off something would be cool
---
Lmao yeah ...if your on PS4 come and meet me a d see my level and what I have and then tell me I’m a banned or suspended player lol .... no I’m just not an ignorant cold hearted ass like you dude...

I was using this one for a while, but check out this beauty:  [https://imgur.com/HzUrefq](https://imgur.com/HzUrefq)

I would like either an eye patch (with alternating sides to wear it on) or like bandages/wrapping to imply a wound had been bandaged up.
---
Sweet bro. See u on the weekend. I play on mic aswell.
---
Just try following the main quests while doing whatever side quests you want and you should be fine. Try sticking to 1 or 2 types of weapons otherwise you won't do much damage (I would recommend a rifle for one and then either a pistol, melee, or shotgun if you go with a second weapon). Get 3 points in endurance cause at level 13 or 14 I believe you can get cannibalism perk which lets you eat everything except robots, including other downed players who you can eat while they are still alive.
---
You're really don't like the word Ban. You've been banned it's interchangeable with the word suspension. Google the definition go on
---
I have 2 of them unlocked in case someone comes to my CAMP while dying from thirst.

Ladies and gentlemen... we got ‘em. ✊🏻

I've found the VATS bug slightly annoying, but I haven't really had issues (that aren't completely out of the norm for 76) with missed hits.  I typically use a super sledge, so it always makes the same big cracking whoosh whether I hit or not.
---
I don't play pvp, so I don't know how serious of an issue this is in that scenario.  I'm doing ok in adventure mode.  99% of the time I don't use VATS on my melee guy, mainly as an "enemy locator", so I've hardly noticed it except for when my pals and I were doing Path to Enlightenment.  I just swapped to my backup laser pistol and started shooting fireflies for the sake of convenience.
---
edit: of course I agree it should be fixed sooner rather than later.  Didn't mean to come off like a jerk.
---
Well it does look like (via speculation) we will be seeing human NPCs in the Wastelanders DLC, especially as it looks like a camp with barb wire can be seen in the background of the badge. It would be funny to hear a comment on how resilient we are.
---
I have a bunch of different traps, today I finished my “strip club”, it has a peep show room that when you sit down on a couch a garage door and brick window overlay opens and a powered gate locks you in, then flamethrowers and radiation emitters burn you front behind, all while the window reveals a vault girl statue looking at you burn haha. Controlled by two trip wires under the couch :)
---
I agree!
---
Oh she's still there, with the holotape. I think the closet moved a bit.
---
Hello! I've had trouble taming a deathclaw since patch 9. Are you able to provide more info?
---
\- What level was it, what level were you? (AFAIK rule is you have to be over double)
---
\- HOW MUCH CAMP BUDGET did you have? (I had \~10% and wouldn't work)
---
\- You only had wasteland whisperer 3? (at the patch notes indicate is all that is needed), no animal friend?
---
\- What is base charisma?
---
\- Oh, and which platform?
---
\-----
---
My experience as follows:
---
"I've found 2 level 21 deathclaws and 1 diseased 21 deathclaw today. I have a base charisma of 4 and using wasteland whisperer 3 I am also level 150. I only have the option to pacify. Playing on a PC. - I also tried increasing my artificial charisma to 28 via chems and armor which had no effect, still only pacify option.
---
Edit: I took a video of the fiasco but crashed mid way while going to camp to show I have 10-15 budget spare and shows personal information in background. I can privately upload if it would help at all."
---
So why jump into a comment that has nothing to do with you. FYI PSN family accounts are a well known work around to the bans I still believe you're the OP otherwise you would've never commented as if I personally insulted you.
---
Stay here if you don't think I have a point. If you're here you probably think it has value like I did.
---
I can make you you a shielded raider underarmor if you bring 4 fluoro flux
---
All of my weapons are rifles, no auto rifles though. I’m using the same character I started with originally and i’m level 47 at this point. I also really don’t know if i’ve invested my levels into the right stats or anything.
---
A knitting or doing a crossword animation for when I’m sat and idle would be cool!
---
May I ask why you dont like people admiring your build? 
---
I ask because I love to build and show off those builds to all. I wish we could have a guestbook to write a small note but I can see a lot of people just filling it with unkind garbage. I am always respectful and close any door I open. Will even pick up any trash left out by others.
---
Ah ok, well that’s unfortunate. Guess I’ll have to keep looking. Are you by any chance playing on PS4? I am trying to make some for my buddies...
---
Where to add more point from lvl up? Strengh? Using Shootgun, hunting rifle and 10mm pistol. Thanks in advice
---
No I don't. 
---
The context of how I learned banned versus the context of the word suspended are not interchangeable. 
---
If bethesda meant to say you are permanently banned. They will say that. Other wise its till another day as the email actually states.. whenever that is..
---
They are already working on a fridge as it is. There will be the base model made available with additional paint jobs for it.
---
Oh here you are troll, go back under your bridge! You are not real people!
---
The first two Camps in this video have elaborate self working traps. First Camp has two powered gates, 12 flamethrowers, and eight radiation emitters all controlled by two hidden trip wires in the stairs. It also has a “Jug” style springboard trap completely hidden under a proper floor. Camp two has a bed that burns you alive and locks you in a one by one, also has “Jug” springboard trap

Strength is good because all ur melee weapons go up in damage and also your max carry weight is increased, endurance increases your maximum health  I have 5 in luck for the level 35 perk starched genes(to keep mutations)  and class freak(reduces negative effects of mutations by 75%) everything in between is just whatever works but as long as I have my grognak axe and my mutations I can slay (almost) anything pretty easily because I have all the maxed out slugger perk cards
---
They have mentioned it a few times. Something about how they are working on getting it right. Should be out soon I can't wait to fill a tub with prewar cash.
---
I knew people threw themselves at musicians but that’s ridiculously forward 😂
---
These are awesome. Are you able to do one with a map? 
---
Appalachia Map with a camera on locations to take a picture of and a person or foot print to travel to. That would really help too.
---
Let’s be respectful and tell the truth. You were banned for cheating. Nothing more nothing less. Be respectful of people’s intelligence and don’t call it a bug kiddo. Enjoy fortnite 👋
---
That’s exactly what I wanted to know thank you
---
I usually sell at list price. Some I lower because they're not worth it. A few I raise due to rarity or difficulty in obtaining them. Had one list at 1200 caps and it was one of those WTF moment's. I lowered it a lot. Do have one set of plans I raised from 100 to 150 and now 200. They sell immediately anyway. So I look at them as high demand plans.
---
Ok bless. I feel like adding the categories to the Build Mode would probably be easiest so other players couldn't touch the stuff that's placed. Idk I've thought about this a lot, my C.A.M.P is very important to me lol
---
I just read somewhere (creditable) that display cases for bobbleheads and magazines were in the nest future. However, I dont recall it mentioning power armor. 
---
Once I remember where I saw this info. I will update with a source
---
How does starched genes work? If rad's don't give you mutations, and rad away doesn't remove them, how would you go about getting the beneficial mutations for a build?
---
No sorry, pc :(
---
That isn't the case at all, everyone complained about the prequels messing with the continuity of the series long before he edited the older movies as well.
---
Lmao you just look even more dumb trying to call others stupid when they call you out 😂
---
I've been in there just fine. But yeah anyone else having issues post it! Maybe bethesda will see it
---
There are a lot of dupers who never kept the items themselves—they just helped a friend dupe by picking up their stuff and holding it while they rejoined the server. Unfortunately, that looks exactly like picking up a bag of items from a stranger and then dropping it. Those players are equally guilty, but wouldn’t show the items in their inventory if checked. 
---
There’s no “good” way to handle this. Duping was, and still is, a huge problem for this game. Bethesda has to do what it can to contain it, even if that risks a handful of false positives from time to time.
---
What's the bug about?
---
I need to do it to, I'll send you a friend request my Id is dj_3465
---
Cornrows would be cool, and more styles for African hair would definitely be nice.  I always liked the "Firebrand" cut, of all the kinky hair options.  It looks like a '70's badass Panther leader haircut.
---
Some more "raider" like options for men would also be good.  The female characters get all the mohawks and punk styles.
---
Btw wasn’t being sarcastic I’ve actually never heard something like that tbh. Most are just duper’s lying or kids who bought duped shit &amp; don’t wanna admit it
---
I saw that too but of course when I went to look at it closer I couldn't find the source again, if you find it please let me know, thank you!
---
Lmao I love reddit .. that dude is not me Shah

Lmao the duper coven is forming. Can’t you guys make your own little Reddit?

This happens almost every single time I move my camp. I'm afraid to put any thought and time into my camp for fear that when I move it I'll be reading the same message about floating or intersecting.

You jumped in to troll...I jumped in to comment because  some innocent players did get affected and I’m not a tosser like you. You threw offence at me and I don’t but up with little bullies like you....if you had a brain you would check account histories

I use it on my medic with over repair it lasts a while. I suppose it would depend on how often you want to repair. I use the skill at level 5.
---
Barely any issues over on the Xbox. Only one or two crashes, but that is normally when my party disconnects as well because of my sister's smart TV being turned on.
---
I'm just glad people can make use of them. They start to rack up a lot of weight after you've been playing for a while and the 100 caps or so helps me check out other vendors with FT costs!
