What are cap sinks?
---
---
---
And if you weren't back in time and killed yourself to take said mats...you would be a Duper Looper Looter
---
Finally completed it for the first time today though. But some other player actually went into the event first and triggered the spawn of the scorched with the signs. Freakin weird
---
Well now hopefully I wont kill myself as easily with my TSE pump shot gun.
---
NERF hasn't happened yet :P
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There's only one slight downside they put into this way of playing: you can acquire building plans only by venturing out into the world. So if you don't do much combat, you don't level up, and thus you don't have access to those areas on the map that have new building plans.
---
This is an odd difference compared to weapon and armor modding, where you discover new mods by disassembling the weapons. By doing that work, you're rewarded with new options. Building camps tho doesn't make your character more skilled or reveal new plans. I think they should change this.
---
I've been on this search since launch but have only found a few unmarked scorch camps :(. It's cool finding unmarked areas because they look interesting but nothing interesting enough YET. 
---
Usually expensive items/events to spend a lot of money on. They're a way to stop players always having the maximum amount of caps. The signs and letters plan is a good example (11500 caps). 
---
I definitely took my time and really played the game when I first started. Did all the missions and any side mission that came up. Explored the map in detail, didn't fast travel anywhere and really soaked it up. I spent a lot of time building different camps and playing around with building too.
---
I felt like I got a lot more out of the game and got a much better appreciation for it. Really you need to not compare yourself to other people you see on the map as level doesn't really tell you actual experience. When this subject has been discussed before you start to realise that most 'normal players' level up in a slower way like this.
---
I did notice that after I was done with all the missions and had explored the map (i think I was in my 40s when everything was done) and moved onto SBQ flights and Ghoul farming I started to level up really quickly and now I am in the 130s.
---
I am glad i took my time when starting out though and would always recommend anyone new to the game to not compare yourself to others and just take your time to enjoy the game.
---
Yeah. Poor dudes.
---
Games the same. Probably won't change
---
Turrets are the issue for sure! But if you are killing them before the person who generated the mobs get a hit. That's kinda messed up. 
---
That's a very good point, don't want items completely out of reach for newer players. 
---
My guess would be conflicting lights colours when you meet another player. Game would probably flip out.
---
Any way that removes currency (caps in this case) from circulation among players. 
---
The Fast Travel Fee for example is a cap sink, however it's a very minor one.
---
Just give the radiation damage some scaling you'll be fine. 
---
It also has the cool thunder sound when you stop firing.
---
By the way, you can legitimately get the Gatling, with specific effects, up to over 8k damage per shot. Yes, that IS crazy, especially since that‚Äôs without stealth damage (which makes it even more ridiculous) and it‚Äôs fully automatic with good range and fire rate.
---
Er don‚Äôt these drop from the SBQ?
---
Constantly....
---
I say 3 days and duping is back
---
Bobble head stacking will negate the nerf to TSE's 
---
server stability will result in only 1 crash / blue screen per hour
---
It will be at least another week before we hear anything meaningful from Bethesda after the patch breaks everything.
---
I‚Äôve actually never used a gun lmao so I wouldn‚Äôt really know. I do know guns require maintenance from time to time and have to be kept in good shape, but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not as frequent as this game? 
---
On XBox go to the "party" tab, select "search or create post" then select "looking for group" then select "fallout 76".
---
Not sure If I have these in order but you can try it. You will see a ton of posts about people/dupers selling TSE weapons every day for around 2000 caps. Join the person's game and buy what you want
---
I agree. No one is asking for a two- shot gatling gun to drop from a diseased tick right after you leave the vault. 
---
But  only a small percentage of players kill the queen. 
---
Is it asking too much for a rare achievement produce, you know... rare loot?
---
You literally fucking labeled him as duper in your headline!!! Are you fucking kidding me???
---
&gt; You're talking about how it is before weapons get nerfed. 
---
&gt;I'm talking about after weapons get nerfed and there are still these people sitting there making it harder. The claim that the queen is still quite killable should be tested against 10 low level people sitting inside the bunker, 
---
In less than 24 hours, you can do that if you want. I haven't been doing a lot of queens but I've never seen a case where there's 10 low levels around. Not even 5. Usually there's no low levels. Unless level 45 is low level. Typically there's been 5-10 players. 15 would be quite a large crowd. Don't know if I've ever seen 20 or more players there. Most are level 60 and above, at which is more about gear than levels.
---
The nerfs aren't unknown. With no other changes you can estimate how much more time it takes to kill the queen. If you see enough failures to kill it, you should see more.
---
It boils down to this: You perceive a problem. I don't. Either way, the patch is happening. TS and explosive effects are getting pretty huge nerfs.
---
Literally the same. Sometimes a loading screen will finish and then another appears immediately afterwards. Are you getting that too?
---
Major lag and disconnections, I‚Äôve been right with that bet for the last few patches now. üòÜüòÖ
---
There's a bug introduced in the last patch that's worked around by dumping all the junk into your stash first.
---
Also you need to loot more :P
---
100% More damage is too powerful when other legendary effects only do around +30%. The draw of Two-shot should be the extra bullet for more consistent damage. Not the +100% damage boost. I think +20% is fair.
---
I think you meant "transparent," but "translucent" is definitely more accurate for what Bethesda has lived up to. They mentioned supply drops last time but left out the locking them to players part.
---
Have noticed that as well, maybe it's an attempt to keep a mod from being scrapped? Whenever it happens I just go stomp a few low lvl baddies and try again, is usually cleared up by then, mostly.
---
Add me, JamesBondMeow, we can talk.
---
Store all junk in your stash and try it. Seems to bug out if some is in your inventory and some in stash
---
&gt; the fuse box connected to the outside of your house
---
Locks, typically speaking. I haven't seen a fuse box on the outside of a house in anything other than an apartment complex and shitty movies who need it to advance the plot. In the former case, they're always padlocked with heavy duty locks.
---
Did they already patch server switching? I know it isn‚Äôt as bad as duping...
---
I agree; I've wondered this as well. It would be great to have such a thing happen. There's several items I would've bought had I purchased the game at launch instead of waiting. 
---
Ok thanks everyone for the info. Looks like it is kind of a toss up from the views here. I'll prob just get whichever is cheaper
---
Yeah I grab everything and still have a hard time keeping up with my ammo. Thanks for the info. 
---
Well it will kill them if they produce more games that are as bad as F76. Starfield will get dismantled by the community if it's the usual bug ridden Bethesda game and so will TES:VI.
---
Yep :(
---
Yeah, that was what, two or three weeks ago (roughly), I think?
---
Gotcha. I have somewhere between 12-15, so i wasnt too sure. Good to know i shouldnt have to read them üëç
---
You should try putting them into and taking them out of your STASH. Im pretty sure i had the Bobble one (find 10 bobbles?) pop when pulling a couple from my STASH.
---
Great ideas and hopefully some of them will be implemented in Fallout 76. We'll definitely need more server stability to make it all work though although they do seem to be working on it with each patch. 
---
Haha, hey you live you learn. If people come and shoot up your base. Chances are it's because it breaks an unwritten code and they felt it was justified. As I mentioned down the line, things like camping at the back of whitesprings, setting up camp next to Charlestown Station (this prevents the responder bot) and there is Pro ably a few more I'm unaware of, but yeah you get the point.
---
 If it impedes or takes something away from other players, it's bad craic! 
---
It's still the best straight damage-add, so I doubt it.
---
I love Uranium Fever. I try to do it every time it shows up. Tons of caps and scrap, three guaranteed legendary spawns, and all the shotgun ammo &amp; glowing meat you can carry.
---
For the time being you could donate 500 or so caps to new players if you want them to go to good use.
---
Sounds neat... once they fix the griefing problem. To griefers this just shouts, "blow me up I'm expensive to repair!" Just like decontamination showers.
---
There's a shack in the mire with a daily quest that involves hunting cryptids. I agree I would love having more stuff though.
---
Personally its been better but I'm on ps4
---
Yea, so if thats the case, im still relatively confused as i do not use any of those (i use demo expert, but the guns in question are non-explosive)
---
[removed]
---
Dang. I missed out on my own accord then. Hurts even more nowüòÇüòÇüòÇ as long as the Pickaxe Pilsner light, alarm clock, and Deathclaw statue are still to come I‚Äôll be okay. I‚Äôve already got my space marked off for them.
---
Check back later - I‚Äôve had stuff disappear due to a disconnect reappear.  Can take a few minutes or more too.
---
I'm PS4 too and mine is almost unplayable 
---
Yep. Take from the stash what you need to craft, it helped me

---
I said, "possible duper" then asked for clarification. Learn some fucking reading comprehension.
---
See that's what the post is about, clarifying something before I label someone as a cheater. It's really not that difficult to comprehend, and plenty of people actually helped me figure it out without being assholes. 
---
Maybe try a reinstall.  I've heard that can help
---
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My take : TS is a problem when compared to other options. It's an automatic +100% damage compared to the next best of anti armor which is apparently around a 25% dps increase, or furious which stacks up to +30%. Even instigating is only a chance at +100% and only on the first hit.
---
TS is three times as good as the next best thing and definitely needs to be rebalanced to make other options worthwhile, even if it wasn't a problem unless paired with explosive. 
---
I had this same problem in reverse lol. I wanted to place a doorway but the wall below it was facing the other way so the outside of my doorway was facing inward. I had to remove the wall below it to get it working.
---
That's awesome! I was hoping someone had found one on here. Thank you thank you :)
---
Instead of nerfing tses they will unintentionally buff Todd's salary. Mb will fix it next patch, mb not. They still have other things to do, you know
---
There‚Äôs a large tree with a destroyed settlement on top of it that can be accessed. It‚Äôs on the far right of the map in the middle. Basically if you put lines down the middle and across the middle of the map like a compass, it be on the east line. I could be a little off but pretty sure that‚Äôs right.
---
The tree has a cave on the inside of it accesses from the top that has cave crickets and like 6 crystal nodes.
---
Your kidding right ? Myself and just one other person killed SBQ in 5 mins today. If you can't kill it your build is crap or your gear is crap or both. 
---
I agree heavy weapons probably need a buff but to be clear:  
---
People killed SBQ long before everyone was rocking TSE's, and they are 100% not the only option for winning that encounter.
---
Because Bethesda, that‚Äôs why.
---
As a low level, the Forest Leader of the Pack events are a great way to get three level appropriate legendaries. 
---
Otherwise I like Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Surface to Air, Line in the Sand, and Breach &amp; Clear. 
---
Yes.  Since last patch.
---
This weekend was utterly bad on PC - I suspect the servers are long past due a reboot given the last patch was a while back.
---
Special events that can only be started with Caps maybe? Like you hit the cap limit and you get a ‚ÄúYou have been invited‚Äù messenger bot who invites you to do some event that requires you to fast travel all over and nabs you something unique and consumable. Like a bobble head that lasts longer or Ice Cold Colas that have twice the effect
---
MVP, we need more players like you to teach them their place. Unfortunately I am not it as I suck at PVP
---
Lol, that dam sight ring. For those situations where you want to go into aim mode to shoot at the far right of whatever you are actually trying to hit.
---
Yeah all true and it's a big problem. 
---
Hah, the unimaginative dupers were making hundreds of thousands of two-shot explosives.
---
The *true* masterminds were duplicating Nocturnal Boards - think! No one will ever suspect! The perfect crime!
---
Can i have one? If i add you? Or it is risky since its apparently from the dev room :x
---
Me and team just used weapons that mimic the nerfed level coming on TSEs (or took perks away to mimic), ran out of time on the SBQ.  Took over 3/4 of the time just to get her to her regen point. Only 7 of us there...sucked. You'll see... :-)
---
Thank you! I know right. 
---
Ahhh, ok. Thanks!
---
Found a few unmarked fissure sites. They are in the data files and appear in the world, but there's no map marker for them.
---
That means your house is designed like it belongs in a shitty movie that needs to advance the plot.
---
I've heard a database rebuild can help too.
---
Try that first
---
I dont understand all negative comments about it im probably round 300 hours level 140, no cheating only woking for what i have, started trading stuff on reddit only the last week and loving it, will be happy with some new story line now but still got lots to do. 
---
Players with ‚ÄúGary‚Äù in their name/PSN/Gamertag will have their characters replaced by Gary, can only equip vault suits and 10mm pistols, but gain massive stats and bonuses, making them fabulously overpowered.
---
As the plague of Garys spreads, Bethesda will release an afternoon statement telling us they are powerless to stop the Gary Plague anytime soon, but that a fix is on the way, with no ETA.
---
Later it is discovered a future DLC was to have a Gary character as a reference to the original vault of Gary, and this was where the bug originated.
---
&gt; They give you no food.. just poo.  
---
Not necessarily: Although there will be no meat in the original corpse produced by killing the Brahmin associated with a Fertilizer Producer, said corpse can indeed produce meat when Searched with the Butcher's Bounty perk. In that case, in addition to producing fertilizer, the Fertilizer Producer can also produce this valuable stat food, and at your CAMP, thereby sparing you a trip to, say Flatwood for your +STR stat food ‚Äî albeit at the cost, as you note, of one razorgrain (a renewable, plantable resource) and one steel shard (the most common item in the game).
---
I think of it as firing a heavy weapon in ‚ÄúGangsta‚Äù mode
---
So typical...small group of TSE shotguns quickly kill the SBQ then hop to the next server leaving the Prime zone empty and then there‚Äôs the incessant farming at White Springs...
---
It‚Äôs Groundhog Grind day over and over and over....
---
Crafting!
---
If you've got over 100 of it, consider crafting/breaking down for mods or bulking for vendors.
---
I sit comfortably around 500-550 with a couple weapons and ammo.
---
Pvp is fine. It‚Äôs the griefing that people don‚Äôt like.
---
Actually, a plague of Gary's would be a great event.
---
No? Lol, you're the one who brought up a fuse box, this isn't a fucking fuse box it's a key pad which is supposed to keep people out. You're the one who brought up the false idea of a fuse box here. Just because power runs through it doesn't make it a fuse box.
---
Your fix will be too late, as the challenge ends in less than 15 hours. That's just more Atoms I'll never see.
---
Not sure why you got a downvote considering you‚Äôre right.
---
How about man up ? PVP is a part of the game and it's fun. If you don't like it join a different server, simple.
---
r/fo76filthycasuals. Some folks there in their 20‚Äôs who have played since beta.  
---
They really just enjoy just sitting on their porch.
---
lol I randomly got here from Google. Good Lord, just be honest you hate them because they hate FO76. 
---
Right? I‚Äôm secretly hoping they steal the idea.
---
On PS4?
---
Awol armaments because of the almost guaranteed 3 star max level legendary drop.
---
Probably the same value as other event outfit like BoS jumpsuit.etc
---
I'm ~75 hours at level 34. Only made it to Ash Heap, Forest and Toxic Valley so far. 
---
There's no demand for resources in Fallout 76. Without knowning Eve I'm sure there's nothing to compare.
---
https://youtu.be/FkK4KEob-yU there you go dude. Took a while to upload üòê
---
I was stuck at four for months. I'm at six now! Blah.
---
I picked up the plans the other day from the Harper's ferry vendor. I can't yet craft it (need makeshift warrior 3 or 4) but I bought the plans because I picked up a Death Tambo 4-5 levels ago and it's been so awesome. If I could craft one I'd give it to you. I'm lvl 21 now and I can easily kill lvl 20-25 enemies in a handful of strikes. It saves soooooo much ammo.
---
I like the idea but it can‚Äôt be controlled by other players. I don‚Äôt trust them to do the right thing. A reputation system would need to be determined by something else, and not something simple like how many people you‚Äôve killed. Killing people in general doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person, it‚Äôs how it occurs and that can‚Äôt really be monitored by any system.
---
And if it‚Äôs ever a thing, it damn well better not be as shit as the homie system in rdr2.
---
Fuse box was referring to the switch you can walk up and push that original comment was complaining about.
---
I used the term fuse box because that's what it's called in  real life, like a terminal would he called a computer. 
---
Lol, it does kinda shoot sideways with the aim site on so I can see that.
---
You have ruined this gun for me now because that is all I am going to think about everytime I shoot it from now on :P
---
I was playing while my daughter (5) was watching, and I came across those infernal cabins. I went from laughing and joking with her to panic mode in a second flat. Even wearing my power armor I was scared beyond hell, I looked around for a few minutes and eventually decided to bug out.
---
&gt; and provide feedback.
---
That we ignore. TS nerfs were wildly unpopular and explosive nerfs were welcomed with open arms. TS nerfs still going through though afaik.
---
You were right, I found the plans in Grafton. Thanks
---
Lose Barring. its the only event i will ALWAYS go to when it is up. 
---
mostly because im (not literally) swimming in acid and can smelt for days
---
That's Tanagra Town. It's marked.
---
I can listen to him forever. Lol
---
Literally every patch has been buggy af. Because in every patch there have been bugs still around since launch as well as new ones introduced every now and then.
---
heavily miss them.
---
This. So much this. Heavy guns right now are either high powered nerf guns, of disintegrate a quarter of the way into the fight. As an Enclave player I desperately want to use the Gatling Plasma, but it falls apart in my hands before the SBQ's healthbar resets (and yes, that's with Gunsmith 5, Luck Break 3, and the gun repaired to 200% with Weapon Artisan 3)
---
You got downvotes wtf
---
While I agree that Pacifist Mode should keep you safe, you would have to set it at character creation or some other hard checkpoint. Otherwise as soon as someone kills you, they turn on Pacifist and there is no retaliation. 
---
You could disable the toggle for a player who is Wanted, but then you might as well have it a permanent setting because people would get stuck with it off when they get a 5 cap bounty from accidentally clipping someone‚Äôs house while chasing a horde of ghouls.
---
I dropped mine at level 35
---
üéâ
---
With the bitching and moaning penciled in for five minutes later.
---
Yeah I put a report on the master thread about it. I am almost certain it's because you're taking damage in the deposit screen. I lost a Chameleon / Action refresh/ Better sneaking heavy leather leg. *C'est La Vie*.
---
Haahahahah i have 13 of them... you want 12?
---
Damn I thought I was being clever. Well at least op can check out the cave.
---
I have level 40 All Rise and this is much better.  The loot is leveled for your level so don‚Äôt do this quest until you are level 50 or lose out like me
---
They are ridiculous in this game. I seem to be a magnet for them since I started playing. Last night was the last draw and I actually stood my ground and fought the bitch and won! My first! Im lvl 42 and it was an epic battle, I am still fixing my power armor and weapons from the battle. Now I am stuck in a bus because there is another circling above me and it wont leave. I think its time they change the dynamics of these stupid things. The extra monsters that you have to fight that come with them are enough to keep you busy. I was very disappointed that I didnt even get an epic item from it either....
---
Oh, gotcha. Yeah, nowhere even in the same universe as most games whose weapons degrade. I work in a certain federal law enforcement agency and have had the same weapon for the last ten years, which was issued to me in the academy.
---
In addition to shooting outings several times a quarter, we qualify with our firearms every three months.
---
I have put thousands upon thousands upon thousands of rounds through this bad boy and have never had to replace a single part. I give it a rub down with gun oil after quals, once every three months. Otherwise, it's good as new-ish.
---
By this game's logic, I should have an entirely new gun at least a few times every quarter. 
---
Lol doesn't bother me any, that's the Internet for ya. I would LOVE it if everybody who played was about community and working together and teaming up and helping out. Let everyone do their own thing their own way.
---
But there's always gonna be trolls and party poopers out there lol
---
Now if only all the developers were as motivated as this girl. We‚Äôd have a proper game.
---
I know that TSE's are getting nerfed, any chance other weapons are getting buffed to make up for it? Or are we just being told to deal with the bullet sponges that roam Appalachia? 
---
Check your perks.  
---
2-shot has a pretty large spread per bullet on some guns. I suspect what happens with VATS is that it aims directly at the target but the two bullets fly either side. If that's true then the weapon mods may help.
---
I also had a 2-shot Radium Rifle. Unlocked about half the mods, couldn't handle it anymore and dumped the thing on some poor unsuspecting level 54 in Whitesprings. No regrets.
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
There's some hidden rooms in lucky hole mine... 
---
Do you need to repair the extractors all the time?
---
"Winning" isn't even a part of FO76, regardless. It's an MMO, there is no "beating the game". So either it's all meaningless word play at the expense of builders, or they only meant *violent play* won't be subject to the same microtransaction hell as *creative play*. Unique building assets should not be for sale unless/until they treat combat assets in a similar manner: Unique assets distributed through normal gameplay, palette swaps for sale in the ATOM store.
---
This would still be my position if the assets were priced at a dollar or two instead of the inexplicably ludicrous $5-20 BS they're pulling now, but I also know that they'd actually get me to buy them at that price. As of now, a single item is the same cost as an entire DLC for FO4. People lost their shit over Horse Armor back in the day but are rolling over for a single Red Rocket sign that costs the same as an entire workshop DLC with dozens of lamps, tables, walls, gadgets, and more. It's flat-out a broken promise.
---
I just tested something and the Straight Jacket is 50 with Hard Bargain 3 and 11 Charisma.
---
Yes.  From safe mode. I've never done it but I've seen ppl on here suggesting it helps.
---
A new one is the targetting mod on PA helmets or berry mentats.
---
The red outline is sketchy
---
&gt;*Even without having turrets you‚Äôre going to wreak havoc by trying to make the server account for everything you spawn and kill.*
---
Sorry, but I don't understand. Can you rephrase that?
---
[I don't wanna retype it, so I'll link my old post. Happened about a month ago, yet to be topped.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4z00o/thank_you_to_the_two_police_officers_who/)
---
Why do people make posts like this?  If somebody is going to quit, they just quit and move on to other games.  If you advertise that *omgimquittin* you probably won't really quit but just want some attention.  News Flash: we all in the same boat with this game.  Enjoy playing it for what it is right now, or take a break.  They will not fix it any faster/slower based on what you do.
---
Yes. It‚Äôd be even cooler if we could add friends and trade with it while not in-game. Would allow those who work, go to school etc to be able to trade anytime. As it is, trading with people in different time zones or people with busy lives is a pain in the arse.
---
Yeah
---
Oh man, I love me a good 5 minute Scorchbeast queen fight then a 20 minute searching random meat piles while they load to try to figure out which one has the loot she dropped.
---
Its like a virtual Wheres Waldo game with a lot of loading.
---
You know id be fine if people were duping *only* random aid or niche items
---
You want 6000 Potato Crisps? Cant stop once you pop!
---
Yeah, it would be nice if Luck were like Magic Find in Diablo.
---
It‚Äôs really awkward. I honestly can‚Äôt believe they managed to leave that out.
---
Nice catch, did you find a suitable distance that would prevent displacement?
---
I can mod dense raider if you're on PC. I think it was a vendor sell but I'm not sure which.
---
What effect take it that high?
---
This happened to me for the first time today when I got into some PvP with one other player. Hit every button I could think of to clear it and nothing worked. Ended up taking myself out with my TSE and when I respawned the issue was gone.
---
Yeah that's exactly what happened to me. 90% of my time installing the thing was spent deducing this little tidbit, so I thought I'd share haha. 
---
I've been called a hacker for using stealth boys...
---
*shrug*
---
Haha yeah they gonna sell those bad boys to use one color at a time.
---
Bloodied I think. There‚Äôs a video on YouTube I watched not long ago that detailed builds to get ridiculous damage on specific weapons and it included the Gatling.
---
Then you dont know the games mechanics. Slap damage, applies to EVERYONE equally. Whether you have pacifist on or not, slap damage works for everyone. The ONLY thing pacifist mode does, is make it so you cannot damage other players or their property. That's it, that's all pacifist mode does, nothing more and nothing less. Your ignorance is showing, put it away
---
Well idk if it was patched since I already have that achievement but you were essentially able to just pick a bobbleheads up and drop it and pick it up and drop it over and over until you got the achievement. I TRIED this with magazines and it did not work. But alas I do have 10 unread magazines currently in my active inventory so I know when it doesn‚Äôt pop at 20 I won‚Äôt be crazy 
---
If they had an unlimited cap then it wouldn't be trade only inflation would go up but people would still take caps if caps were good for other stuff and universal currency problem with a cap limit at 25k is one trade and you can be a 25k so nobody wants to manage yet so they just do trade only
---
Shoot. I was wrong. I spent most the evening gathering resources for a big craft. I crafted 100 normal Leather Left Arms. Somehow Super Duper made it into over 200, which I can only assume is a bug? No idea. It's not meant to over double it.
---
I moved it to my level 4 character (who only knew Boiled for all of the leather pieces) and scrapped the whoooooole lot. Anyway it unlocked arm mods, leg mods... and chest. All for leather. Damn. I was wrong.
---
I'm still sure I can use those on normal, sturdy and heavy leather armour though. The ability to mod them applies across them.
---
Anyone under lvl 40 should not count
---
Soon as in early 2020. By the time they get to all the QoL after the bug fixes this game will be an actual wasteland. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still play it and love the idea they were going for, but let‚Äôs stop kidding ourselves. 
---
It tells you in the challenge the exact names location of all 5. There will be a very small hardly visible arrow signaling you can scroll down 
---
Had the same encounter not to long ago. http://imgur.com/gallery/ZU1Oles
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm considering going through my bank to force a refund because the game is both not as they promised and it‚Äôs not in a state that can be called fully released. At best it‚Äôs a beta.
---
Basically when you spawn in it will spawn any enemies that are scripted to in the immediate area, even if a group of four just cleared them out. The servers try to make sure everyone has something to shoot at so when you load into any server it will instantly respawn all enemies in the area. And Whitesprings has a ton of ghouls in the Golf Course. Respawning enemies that still have meatpiles all over the floor that weren‚Äôt picked through causes server congestion trying to track everything at once. Ever notice in a SBQ fight how sometimes after it dies you can‚Äôt loot anything for about a minute or two? Well at Whitesprings people have crashed servers forcibly respawning enemies. While there is a cooldown period if you‚Äôve cleared it most people will leave a friend in the session and respawn in off them which force respawns all enemies again 
---
Known plans not showing as known and a continued waste of caps buying things we already have learned but I am excited to finally spend caps on plans cause once I‚Äôm broke, everyone dies 
---
Can it? I could swear I found ones with multiple effects. I'll have to check some of the stuff I have
---
It‚Äôs called ‚Äúranting‚Äù. That‚Äôs why he put the word rant in his title.
---
Radrats are fucking tanks man
---
Sounds like a cool idea. Too bad Beth would make you build an altar taking up 70% of your camp and would require several pieces of all flux and ballistic fiber to repair it if you let a radroach touch it.
---
It isn‚Äôt really fine. I have no turrets and I struggle to have what could be considered a small house, one of each work bench, bed, stash etc and some purifiers.
---
I'm learning a very time I go in.
---
Well I don‚Äôt think I was an asshole while responding to you. I asked you to not jump to conclusions. Yes you said ‚Äúpossible‚Äù but you know as well as I do, that people just like to jump to conclusions on the Internet, when reading a headline line yours. It‚Äôs just the easy way to do. If you read your post tomorrow, you‚Äôll find that nothing you said identifies the other player as duper but your headline strongly suggests that he/she was, independent of the ‚Äúposssible‚Äù you said/ wrote. It‚Äôs all good and I don‚Äôt care that much to be honest. Just think twice next time. Have fun in the Wasteland ‚úåüèª
---
3 days is being overly generous. I‚Äôd say 3 hours is more likely, and only 1 crash an hour would be an improvement for many. 
---
&gt; I used the term fuse box because that's what it's called in real life
---
No, in real life it's called a switch. A fuse box is something else entirely.
---
Daaaang, I feel that. That one was really recent too. :/
---
lower dps than rifle but its okay.
---
What none of these people are telling you is that Grahm has a habit of spending all his caps at the Feral Ghoul Brothel downtown Charleston. 
---
Brilliant! 
---
that would be nice since many of us high lvls just get crafting perks and only use them for 5% of the  time and i dont even use the bonus perks for pvp /pve that much since i have some many perks just in weight reduction or crafting
---
You‚Äôre giving me shit for ‚Äùrewriting‚Äù your comment when you clearly didn‚Äôt bother to read mine. I never said slap damage applies more or less. Being in pacifist mode essentially guarantees that you‚Äôll *only* take slap damage (with the exception of PvP events/workshops) from other players because you can‚Äôt slap back to initiate PvP. Thus, pacifist DOES help keep you from taking real damage because you can‚Äôt initiate actual PvP. It prevents you from taking full PvP damage. Jeebus dude this isn‚Äôt hard. 
---
He's farting away! 
---
LAMO!
---
True ... that‚Äôs a great point
---
Ah so you're the type of person who thinks everyone is a duper? No wonder you're so stupid. Lol. Hint, leave the game if you cant handle honest gameplay.
---
a fo76 app would be awesome with trading, events and other features
---
I had that once. I logged off and back on and was able to fast travel.
---
Same, this game has a lot of building peculiarities. After building 5 separate homes for my toons I've come to understand what I hope is most of them lol.
---
Yes please, this. Thanks.
---
check the map what does that carry weight say and also what armor mods are you using ?
---
Sounds to me you're describing Assassin Sentinel gear and a Two Shot explosive weapon. What you described happens all the time without cheating. 
---
Possibly, lol. Was it my suggestion or my grammar that gave it away.
---
It‚Äôs kind of combination of the mods you have learned or have, your character‚Äôs level and the perk cards you have 
---
The carry weight listed is what it shows, and PA no weight changing mods. 
---
No, Other than the BOS mod that raises physical and energy resistance, they're stock.
---
All the silos work
---
"Kills a 3-star legendary" gets a "one-star board" IF even I get a legendary item at all :0
---
Lmao people are downvoting you. Have an upvote friend.
---
Best heavy so far. Hope they'll make new skins for it. I want a laser-plasma-hi-tech skin for it.
---
weird since on my player i have a bug where the carry weight is 277 and that cause deep pocketed is bugged and is giving me a weird number and doing what your is doing
---
Yeah having to make alts just to hold the caps is a bit silly, but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs good that he‚Äôs testing, it‚Äôs bad that he‚Äôs a known duper and all the nuke cards he has are duped.
---
Can we flip the image on hand scanners so it's not a left hand on the right side of the door? 
---
I apologize to everyone that will only see this when entering silos for now on
---
rifles are for skinny hazmaters
---
Aw poor baby
---
Agree on the sound - this is not the gun that fiddlefarts around with silencers and subtlety. This is the gun that comes out when it's time to get things done, when diplomacy and subtlety have failed.
---
Also, tip on aimed firing: If you start firing *before* going into aim mode, the crosshairs stay up on your screen instead of disappearing like normal. This helps alleviate the pain of the sight being held at a 45 degree angle. :D
---
100 m when i measured it
---
It will still be the same broken game
---
Answered question #1 for myself last night. I played in the late afternoon, before supper, and then went to eat, watch some TV with my family - having logged off fully (to desktop). Came back after watching a couple of movies, so several hours later, and joined a world. Went to a workshop to claim it and saw that it was just waiting for someone to claim, the enemies had already been defeated. In fact the resource collectors were still in operatio... wait what? And the benches are in the same position I built them in several hours ago?
---
Somehow, I rolled a natural 20 and jumped on the same server I'd left a few hours before, and nobody had touched that workshop (or another one I'd claimed) in the intervening time. Reclaimed them, picked up my waiting collected acid, and carried on where I'd left off.
---
Love how those people just proved it by downvoting your post as well. Have an upvote.
---
Tried that twice with no change. :/
---
Today I killed a 3 star glowing one and got a silver pocket watch...
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again.  Human skin and bones armor,  wearable animal skins, beaver panel PA! 
---
I take 2-3 and still only get freaking ammo 
---
From this we can conclude that you're not running a pvp build, so why are you commenting? 
---
Lots of boxes were able to store other items but people abused it and exploited the limit so now all are the same stash
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** xKINGMOBx! ^(hug)
---
I'll resist doing that as long as I could
---
I can understand that. But just think how i feel pre ordering and giving bethesda my full support only to see CD keys go for as low as 10$ US two months later which is crazy for a AAA game. Yeah i wanted my money back and i feel others would of done the same considering keys are dirt cheap now
---
Wait, He can take a few cores of direct plasma hits w/all three heavy weapons perks, very close plasma with two levels grenadier and three explosives perks? That doesn‚Äôt sound reasonable. And why didn‚Äôt he have a damage indicator?
---
Is the game just becoming a hangout for jerks? Last several times I‚Äôve claimed a workshop this has happened. Getting to be not very much fun anymore.
---
The harrassers of our group are also on reddit. Comments have been quickly deleted meant to be sent directly to users phone. 
---
I‚Äôm really not sure why. No item in the game should cost 25k. Even a full set of good sentinel shouldn‚Äôt be more than 5k a piece. That‚Äôs just crazy.  
---
I‚Äôve been to max a few times and didn‚Äôt find it hard to spend or trade.
---
I feel like we got that out of our systems already, there wasn't that much of it. Pretty much everybody agrees it was needed lol. It'll still be a god tier combo even after the nerf, which just goes to show how big of a problem it was in the first place
---
There are many other options that work perfectly fine. My revolver without two shot or explosive handles scorchbeats with 17 or so shots. Nothing needs to be buffed, people just will just have to work on not using overpowered mechanics as a crutch for their lack of good class-building. 
---
It was the "grammar" lol
---
Unfortunately about 100% of the time accessing Inside The Vault from the launcher just give you a blank white screen which is the case most of the time there is an update.  Are you able to post a stickie right on the forums?
---
Thx.
---
Right, but my request was to someone who said that the queen is still killable.  My request wasn't to you.
---
Also, I haven't gone to kill the queen much, but just in the last 2 days I saw about 10 people sitting in there all level 40 and below.  I didn't stop to count them all, but I did see their level tags.  There were more people inside the bunker than there were outside fighting.  Maybe it isn't always like this, but with a huge damage nerf those were fair question for me to ask the developers.
---
More than likely he did not give you the power armor, but a glitch made it free to claim. Just a possibility. 
---
I farm the glowing meat. First you get the meat, then you get the power, THEN YOU GET THE WOMEN
---
That's all anyone can ask :) 
---
I can not,but I know a single person who does it and he told me how he does it
---
This had better be a patch that adds more game content, like quests, events and the like, opening a vault perhaps? if there is no new content to do i will have to put 76 to sleep for a good long while.
---
Or be smart and keep un-bulked steel in your stash.
---
Dude, wtf are you even on about with this post?
---
Oof. Of my group of a dozen or so friends that I play with, I'm the only one that doesn't use the TSE crutch to handle the games content. It's gonna be weird going back to being the only one that can handle SBs without just hoping they land. 
---
No, you need to tame a Grafton Monster and name it Baba Booey or if you can have two tamed, then the second one can be Monkey Mouth or Monkey Lips.
---
Good advice, that's exactly what I did. 
---
I haven't had that.  By my max carry weight randomly changes quite regularly.  Generally makes me over encumbered but guess it could go the other way too.
---
Hey I know this post is pretty old but I would like to join! Psn: Cosmic_Quark
---
Workshops are advertised as PVP.. claiming one is opening yourself up to it. 
---
As for the rest he probably has an OP build. You could easily do the same. 
---
The solution is easy peasy pacif-eze
---
Oh boo hoo in not here for sympathy dick.
---
I'm here to tell my story I couldn't care less I got outplayed I knew I would when I first saw him but I was willing to try the 1% chance I could get him.
---
Was all in good fun go play with your dick somewhere else.
---
You see what you want to see, and ignore the points that conflict with your personal narrative. you are a waste of time. good luck
---
What's a " yaou gi"?
---
This glitch exists, when someone exits their power armor it will stay there and seem like a power armor you can claim. If you try and claim it it basically breaks your game until you log out and restart 
---
I was thinking Ha Garyyy. Like without the r
---
Those abilities were pretty much made for that weapon. +250 DR while reloading? Yes please.
---
They haven‚Äôt actually talked about it since the blog post. Honestly I would be surprised to see it tomorrow. 
---
You can get plans to upgrade BoS underarmor, crafting recipes, aid. I just collect a bunch cause they weigh nothing and just turn them in when I‚Äôm in the area 
---
Look at the menu to the right of that challenge and it will give you a list of the places that count.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works at all troll. And if you find it fun to grief random people who are just trying to play the game, I suggest you see a psychiatrist to find out why you‚Äôre feeling so insecure and then try to work on those issues. That‚Äôs not normal, health human behaviour.
---
Also lets make all enemies bright red because it's too hard to see. Game is too difficult bethesda. Pls also makes road glow otherwise I can't navigate.
---
I can never carry more than 1 at a time
---
What platform are you on? If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I have a two shot vicious lever action I‚Äôll sell for 500 caps. 
---
But he can't just get the sential armor 
---
So I was playing this game that has PvP, but the PvP is only in these specific spots that most people ignore. So I went to one of these few PvP spots and pressed okay on the window that said ‚ÄúHey this is a PvP zone‚Äù and then some guy killed me! 
---
So I decided that he was super proud and gloating about and made a post on reddit saying that people like that shouldn‚Äôt be proud because pointing at other people‚Äôs flaws makes me feel less responsible for putting myself in that situation.
---
Teach me your ways I usually make about 5k a week just casually selling everything I don‚Äôt need to vendors. And still can‚Äôt spend all my caps cause IDK what plans I know and don‚Äôt 
---
No. If they implement any way of renaming weapons and/or armor, they have to make it so that the name only appears for the owner. This community is not trustable enough. Either make names client-side only or no naming feature at all. 
---
It only SHOWS as one at a time, but the more you collect before depositing seems, to me, to yield better rewards.
---
This is all great except you can't remove fast travel when there is no alternative. At least F4 had vertibirds.
---
Other thing about this that surprised me, is that I've never heard of anyone getting a piece of Legendary Armor from it.
---
If you own a workshop you‚Äôre automatically hostile to other players trying to contest it so it doesn‚Äôt require the ‚Äúduel‚Äù initiation and they can just come up to you and murder to over and over again. My only qualm to this, is that as the owner of a workshop getting killed by a player trying to take it over, thus THEM being hostile, still causes you to lose caps equal to your level every death.
---
You must be like the little kid in The Wizard! 
---
I'm on xbox, I'll let you know if I can round up the caps
---
Isn't it in the Security/armory room where the PA is? I did it this weekend and I thought I remember it being in a security room.
---
Challenges/Achievements never work. Don't try. If they happen, demand they remove the stupid alerts blocking your view.
---
The melee perk card that makes you swing faster makes you crank faster too!
---
In the menu, the 3 silo sites and the federal dumping ground. That's the only 1s left
---
Did anyone else have trouble with picking flowers? For me, it doesn't register the flowers I've picked (I would never imagined this is my discussion about a post apocalyptic game)
---
It literally tells you where to go. 
---
After 50 I just aim to get every perk card and modify or change my build according to my perks. Allows versatility .
---
It‚Äôs crazy to me it doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve played 300 hours but here we are 3 months later. Happy Birthday Fallout

---
Where do you farm them from? 
---
Thanks Odupers
---
Yeah either that is unintentional and somehow Bethesda missed it or it‚Äôs their idea of immature trolling. Best way to take them down is to watch its path on the map, then fast travel into its path. Sometimes when doing that it immediately changes directions to avoid you so it can take a few tries.
---
don't experience this. I barely disconnect at all. lol nobody cares bro. This game was not created to cure your depression.
---
keep checking grafton and other responder vendors and you will see the plan called lever gun
---
Don't forget about cap runs!
---
I am currently role-playing as a radio host for Responders Radio. 
---
My camp is a radio station behind Flatwoods and I have a Twitter following what I do. 
---
I also have recorded a new radio station with royalty free music for any streamers.
---
https://youtu.be/xjffXaBDYD8
---
 If ham radio's were added I think I'd never stop playing. 
---
Bethesda programmer confirmed!
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah idk about this but..... I also play for like 4-5 hrs maybe 
---
‚ÄúEvery good sword needs a name. What are you going to name yours?‚Äù

-Thoughtful pause.-

‚ÄúThe Fuckbringer.‚Äù
---
If you don't seek revenge you go back into slap damage mode also. Then the other person has to try to claim the workshop again to get pvp started again. You can game that a little if you figure out the mechanics.
---
Right? I keep saying I'm bored of this game and there's nothing to do but then I look at the challenge walk around in Appellation (however you spell it) and realise I've played this game a lot 
---
What happens when you don‚Äôt use vats?  Is there random crippling?  I don‚Äôt have any experience with this.
---
Gatling Plasma's. See how far they take you....lul 
---
or just scrap every gun you find, you could prolly get to 3000 pretty quick especially with scrapper perk.
---
How much budget does it take? 
---
Where was the location of the power armor? Morgantown trainyard? I remember trying to help someone but they kept running away, then proceeded to follow me, turned the mic on and said thanks dude! I waved and rode off into the sunset. (Well ran, but you get the point)
---
Seen a lot of terrible idea on this reddit lately. This one is really cool. make it happen. 
---
True that, most of the people I've found are friendly
---
So one thing I notice with the Gatling Gun - at close range, it misses. Not just misses - it's like the bullet spawns *behind* the enemy I'm shooting at. Which I guess makes sense, since the gun's barrel is huge. Typically, when the chickens come home to roost, it's time for me to break out my small (but fierce!) 10mm SMG.
---
And that's proof of what? I'm not following.
---
It's PVP, take your lumps and move on. 
---
Good bot
---
I think the implementation is easy. It‚Äôs to freeze people by shutting off the graphics loop whenever they hit an error in the game. Average players (casuals and alike) will occasionally bump into a crash (sometimes more, depending on how long they play that day). I‚Äôm an average player, but I have crashed sometimes when picking up loot from the world. But I have never locked up as dysfunctionally functional like that. (I get a bunch of buggy behavior in the world, but it doesn‚Äôt bug me.) It could be dupe detection and ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù (that is, it is a ‚Äúbug‚Äù that will never get fixed), it is a possibility. It probably could be many other things too. But I would agree with the punishment, if such existed. The effort to disrupt the disrupter is fair. 
---
If you want help getting squared away with a new set of PA, I can help if you're on PC.
---
Thank you. Yes flowers is bugged for me. I‚Äôve tried taking green thumb off, doing nuked flora, normal flowers of every kind, no dice. Would have been a nice 30 atomic points if it worked. 
---
Pretty awesome! How the hell do you post a ps4 picture on Reddit? 
---
should have picked it up then dropped it in some water or something so that nobody could find it and then it would just despawn. XD 
---
You‚Äôre still posting in a sub for a game you hate.  Which one of us is more pathetisad? 
---
Thanks for the answer :) better late than never
---
I have been gaming for over 20 years and this game also inspired me to get a headset with a mic. I have never owned one before. I ended up buying a Sony headset that is designed to go with the PS4. It is the gold level, if I recall. Very comfortable so far (wore them for several hours on Sunday) and I am happy with the sound quality. But, as has been mentioned, you can get much less expensive headsets. 
---
Can you interpret the description for me? Is there a 1 in 400 chance of getting a cosmetic in Uranium Fever?
---
What I want to know is how he was completely immune. Does not add up, he‚Äôs using an exploit.
---
I‚Äôd like this as an option for sure
---
Go into the enclave bunker and at the bottom of the stairs that goes to the command room their is rows of desks their is normally between 2 and 4 maybe more.
---
Should've left it another 76 days.
---
Someone better called the Hardly Boys, the mystery of the bathroom dupe. 
---
People play games they don‚Äôt really like because they have potential, but the developers are just too incompetent to deliver. Every game is unique so it‚Äôs not uncommon to hold out hope that one day the game will be fixed.
---
Yes, it's a very nice location imo. Mine is there too. I use the top of the ledge for my statue garden.
---
Thanks, I never noticed this. 
---
I think they are considered melee weapons so go with some strength and luck if you plan to use V.A.T.S.
---
Great fucking video.
---
Crushed my time and gave great advice.
---
If u manage to get a good run recorded without the disconnect would u send it to me. I‚Äôd like to post it on the sub and see if anyone can beat ur time.
---
Yep. Lasts until I kill the mob that I tried to use VATs on... and no scopes or weapon switching.
---
Rats I‚Äôll have to check again
---
I‚Äôm not a synth but a cap is a cap man, 
---
Of course there are reasons. For example, holding out hope that the game will one day be fixed. Ot might be true that the developers are incompetent but since every game is unique, it‚Äôs easy to blind yourself hoping that you‚Äôll get what you paid for.
---
76 days. 76 game crashes. 
---
does vats work with throwing knives?
---
He wasn't using any PA before, we cleared the ressort outside PA. When i told him my game was frozen and i couldn't enter it he made the puking emoji. Like he was disappointed that i couldn't accept his offering. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be a gift.
---
People have mentioned phantom wires contributing to budget when an item is stored before the wires are scrapped. Wonder if that is/was or is still true. Also I imagine with the patterns of item budget use that food items will probably be in the 0.16% category?
---
Just keep playing how you want once you hit lv 50 you can change perks around
---
Hell I like my build and have like 20+ lvs waiting to be used
---
But on the sniper build no idea I'm never that thpe
---
You do realise the SBQ's health pool increases with how many players are in the event. So if you have the whole server there with a bunch of sub level 50's, currently the 150+ level players are carrying all the low levels because they don't do any damage to her whatsoever. The high level players won't be able to carry the low levels through that fight with TSE anymore, only with melee.
---
If nobody cared his post would not exist. Use your head. You were given it for a reason.
---
I just wasn't wanting to do any of that until i had a decent weapon. And since i don't buy mine off people or websites... i just figured I'd wait. 
---
Now im like steve Carell in that one movie about that virgin who is 30.
---
Calling other people insecure just shows your insecurities, especially over a video game. Don't cry, get even. That's what I did. I launched a mini-nuke with my Fatman and blew the level 90 into smithereens while I was level 40.  It was epic.
---
You fully knew this game has pvp and griefing is to be expected.
---
Be better.
---
Quick solution until the patch drops: open the quick inventory. It fixes the bug
---
I have to do this, built*.
---
Also it looks nice. You‚Äôll get griefed though.
---
Ok let me know
---
 At the Whitespring's Service Entrance there is a reddish building it may be brick, beside the tire pile, and in it is an Orange Flat Tool Case that often spawns amazing guns. I have found a Hand Made and a Lever Action there over time. ;)
---
So you basically wasted both of our time by agreeing with me and rewriting what I said. Yet you initially argued my claim saying I wasnt entirely correct, but now you are saying what I have been saying this whole time. A complete waste of effort on your part so congratulations, you're an idiot. 
---
I've *occasionally* seen about 30 seconds of lag when people were spamming the relog/respawn trick. I've ***never*** seen a server crash caused by that. It seems pretty unreasonable to shame people just for having a camp nearby. It's no different from a random player fast traveling there once in a while. How many meat piles + NPCs would you suppose a server has to track *in the entire world, at any given moment?*  It could easily be in the hundreds, but only about 25 enemies can spawn at the clubhouse.
---
Yeah, but names would only pop up if you opened a trade. I guess people would still post inflammatory names but it would be cool to name your TSE/BSS "Not for Sale"
---
This happened to me yesterday during a white springs kill spree. Came back a minute later and the loot was there.
---
yesterday i was started with 6 and finsihed with 14... even a regular mobs drop it.
---
3k steel is a lot but not enough to determine that hes a duper maybe he just got really sick of running out of steel. Ive gathered several k of mats before its not out of the question. 
---
I‚Äôve always wanted this. It would be cool to have the extra space and also have it lootable by other players.
---
Also, ‚Äúmy girlfriend and I*‚Äù grammar is important.
---
Ya i toss hundreds of rubber all the time its just one of those things that builds up faster then you can us it
---
So does depositing say, 10 tech docs yield something better than just one at a time? I have collected about 15 docs over the time playing the game and have saved them. Or is it best to deposit 1 doc 10 times? 
---
That's when I server hop. I find workshops rather underwhelming.
---
There‚Äôs never been other boxes for camps which is what op meant. Storing things in random world boxes is just asking for the game to delete everything you put in there.
---
Just sell unwanted but decently valuable items on reddit. I barely sell at all and I‚Äôve been at or around the 25k cap for the past couple weeks.  Ammo, junk (esp lead and steel), plans, legendary armor and weapons can all fetch decent caps. Just have to watch what people ask for or post your own for sale ad and take some time off to respond to offers. 
---
Imagine! 
---
I'm assuming ur using a rifle max those perks 
---
fixed? ahhaha ur so naive. two shot weapons destroyed for sure... when the explosive blodyed or armor piercing will be the same shit like two shot explosive was.
---
Naw Xbox. That said, I don‚Äôt need anything special. I did just got a level 50 that does extra damage once the enemy‚Äôs HP is below a certain threshold last night though. 
---
Any one with a Gatling gun plan on Xbox hit me up if you you‚Äôre willing to part with it. I‚Äôm usually on after midnight eastern US time. Live tag is the same as my reddit tag, just with 24 on the end
---
gatling plan is at the watoga BOS vendor
---
I didn't even know that he's a duper, I only watch his nuke testing videos
---
I thought my controller took a dive at this moment lol. Freaked me out first time it happened.
---
I‚Äôve always had to be at least five pounds under the carry cap to fast travel. I assumed everyone had that bug but maybe not. 
---
A duper turned me into a newt!!
---
I got protective from technical data as well as shielded.
---
I got better
---
Trading subreddits help a lot)
---
set nopvp mode then will not get damage form players. but still attack them :D
---
Early on its more about qol perks and your main damage type.
---
What's your current level helps alot
---
I went for rifle early because I found a whole bunch of good rifles on my main character early on, plus I was sniping a lot even though I‚Äôm not that good at it.
---
Now though, I‚Äôve found my true love : )
---
EVERY night since beta or were you exaggerating?
---
This is another example of how we need more emojis.
---
Thanks for the heads up on the grammar I didn‚Äôt notice cuz at first it was just me then I remembered I gave her one too 
---
.308, med scope, stabilized stock, true long barrel, suppressor, quick mag. If I could name it I would call it Gibbs. I love my rifle.
---
Sounds like something a Synth would say... Are you a synth? 
---
In my experience, the direction was the opposite
---
I don‚Äôt believe you but if you‚Äôre telling the truth and it was because you were going around destroying random peoples bases without provacation, I hope the ban is permanent.
---
I did not know the Lv. 50 thing. Thanks.
---
Time to kill Gary
---
Hopefully it is nerfed soon.
---
This guy gatlings.
---
It would be nice, but I really like the black and brass look of it though. Thinking of re-making my X-01 PA so I can get that prototype black and yellow paint scheme back
---
Martial arts.
---
Agreed. It will help show how insanely poor this game is balanced as well.
---
Or they could just be treated in a similar way to resource nodes in any other PVE MMO.  
---
It's not hard. It's an already-solved problem. 
---
Yeah, I tried fortnite - not my type of game and didn‚Äôt consider it that fun, especially with all the immature children playing it. I doubt people buying this game expected a moba type experience, as that has never been the type of game in the fallout universe. Different strokes for different folks, but many who‚Äôve played the fallout games for a while aren‚Äôt those type of gamers and don‚Äôt enjoy those games. 
---
You might as well say that because some people enjoyed Barbie: Princess Charm School, that we should also be looking for the same thing in Fallout. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot more than $155 worth of items.
---
mine downgraded to lvl21 then few day later got a star and again few days later got another star. so now i have a two star legendary deathclaw guard.  i have it about a month ago, i moved my camp twice.
---
(tranq darts kmoorlod) my word this man has gone insane and must be immediately treated for knowing to much err I mean ahh crap (tranq darts witnesses) ohhh join vault tech they say it will be fun they say......
---
This was a really cunt thing to say tbh.
---
Hehe.... the other guy had a explosive stack...you just didn't know it ;)
---
This would explain why sometimes my place is taken, but I can‚Äôt find the camp, it‚Äôs probably close, but out of sight because of the mountains 
---
They'll stop this when people stop misusing "troll" and "meta".
---
Yes
---
I wouldn't stress it -- pretty much any build works in Fallout76.  Even later you can just grind out some more levels and redistribute points to the way you want it to be.    
---
That being said I run a kind of stealth/sniper build but in the end, made a more of a generalist/crit build with mutations mixed in to make it more fun.  I rely a lot on crits for damage, and use a TSE gauss rifle.    
---
My build:  
---
[https://imgur.com/I2kl98E](https://imgur.com/I2kl98E)  
---
If I wanted to max out my damage further I'd probably redistribute points so that I could afford all 3 rifleman cards, probably at the expense of the weight reduction cards in STR.    
---
Hope this helps some.
---
If you know how to do it, make a video, send it to Bethesda so they can fix it.
---
not just downgrade but sometime change the skin... btw in nopvp mode players can't kill it.
---
Don't have the items needed or I would
---
well I can see several areas that will be needing big changes 
---
like explosive weapons perk - 1 pulse mine will do 90% dmg to a x-01 player without perks with perks its basically hey did you hear something (line goes dead) - not to mention all the other high explosive weapons that can be used without people seeing you 
---
honestly I'll try it in like june once some of the bugs are ironed out 
---
That sounds like something a duper would say. 
---
Hopefully everything is nerfed
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üñï
---
Seconded
---
Got both from turning in data
---
Wasn‚Äôt on a team either. I was all by myself. 
---
Hope you don‚Äôt act this way in real life. The number of beatings you get would probably suck a lot.
---
yeah, you could switch the keypad lock on your door on or off. Would be really cool for bunker bases!
---
  I finally found one in Lewisburg after searching for ages.  Welch station is also said to be a place to look.
---
Psn: RowdyRekTem does it 
---
Your downvotes don't hurt me guy and you seem pretty insulted by my original comment. Do you also give money for microtransactions on a game you payed for? Oh yeah, one other thing. üñï
---
Well perhaps all those old school single player fallout gamers should have paid attention to the developers when they said 'this will be an always-on PvP game and we want there to be constant tension where if someone wants to kill you they can'. Whose fault is it they saw the word 'Fallout' and bought the game without even bothering to check what genre it was?
---
btw sometimes just attack players without reasons and make them wanted asap.
---
Unrestricted PvP servers coming in March. You'll be able to get vengeance then. Well if they just don't log off right after snatching up your loot.
---
You can also get them from Event: Census Violence. I received both Protected and Shielded from that event. Even got a second copy of Shielded a few days ago.
---
Agree.  My favorite fo76 weapon, I rolled a second char just for it.  Fun.
---
I wish the 50cal was as fun.  The spread and bloom on 50cal is a very sad, very bad joke :(
---
This probably isn‚Äôt click bait bullshit at all 
---
Oh man I‚Äôm so pissed it‚Äôs just such a pussy thing to do.
---
This. I saw a 600 bounty yesterday on the map. Just noped and went to a new server. I'm being no part of that.
---
Paid* and no I‚Äôve never spent money on micro transactions. I earn what I need or go without. I was just pointing out that you‚Äôre being a cunt and that cunts get their skulls cracked. Being insecure is fine but acting like a cunt is a very dangerous and rude way of dealing with it. I suggest seeing a phsychiatrist.
---
I have a 3 star hunters tesla rifle 
---
Could be - definitely not bs 
---
if anything attack ur base will attack it. btw need few turrets, becuase mostly miss a small targets like chinise robots, bugs or rats.
---
Can't use VATS with throwing knives and you also can't get sneak kills.
---
Sadly I havent been so lucky. I'm on PS4 if you ever do stumble upon them again and want to make a deal. CAMP building is by far my favorite aspect of this game. 
---
If you are on xbone I'll give you one. I need nothing in return.
---
I picked up Handmade plans at Harper's ferry at about lvl 18 or so. I'm on the hunt for Leaver action plans currently.
---
Just scrap the duplicate stuff.  It‚Äôs a known bug.
---
Even then she has 70% damage mitigation. And their is anti armour perks, i think bloodied weapons are weapon with aa perks
---
Happy 76th day fallout good times to come ahead in 2019 don't be discouraged be encouraged üòÄ
---
I would love to buy one of those guns off you sir! I'm on PS4 if anything I have a 1 star two shot radium rifle but can't make any mods yet
---
Should‚Äôve picked it up, switches servers and dumped it.
---
I would need to do extensive testing to figure out the wires costs and I'm not sure how I would test the phantom budget consumption. If anyone has any ideas I am more than up to testing it. As for food I would need to find each food up to 6 of each to test the budget % and I have yet to find any in the wild besides muttfruit. Will scavenge later.
---
Sure thing tough guy. What are you gonna crack my skull with? Will it be your imaginary muscles? Lol
---
Awareness in perception is the closest to this that you're probably gonna get.
---
I mean without humans atm... what much more can ya do?
---
Pacifist mode you mean? Players have clearly still killed my tames in pacifist. 
---
It‚Äôs cute that you‚Äôre another one of those weirdos that thinks every human being in human history that has ever made a post online is automatically a 5‚Äù2 skinny little thing with 30% body fat.
---
Also, could you quote where I said I‚Äôd be the one to crack your skull? I do that to people that do stupid shit in real life. Hunting you down would take ages, be costly, interfere with my life and you‚Äôre probably in an entirely different country.
---
Thats awesome to have a legendary, I figured people can't resist killing that.
---
What a neat comment! Thanks champ!
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
First day playing I see
---
I'll be sure to check there, Thanks!
---
I agree.  If were forced to ll at for a buggy alpha grade release that eats inventory, AND Bethesda won't get off their asses to replace things, then we should Def have a path towards replacement of one offs with a guaranteed crafting recipe.   
---
Should be one always present npc that sells recipes to craft all the ones you've encountered.
---
No problem. You‚Äôre definitely right. I‚Äôm not being sarcastic at all. 
---
I dont have slots in my build for it. Is it worth it with no +damage other than Bloody Mess?
---
Just bought the Metal Picnic Table plan from Grahm.
---
Factions DLC.
---
  
---
Hell yeah. Also faction traits, these could increase based on rank and only allow one top rank (president[Enc] Elder[Bro] Alpha[Raid], ect.) That gets top traits, NPC command, chooses event outcomes, ect.... probably asking too much..
---
I did that several times in the video. Didn't work.
---
I vaguely remember getting a legendary from it, but I'm not 100% sure.
---
What a bunch of poopy pants in here! üí©
---
Crazy that so much has gone on in that time, I've been enjoying the hell out of it, even with glitches and drama and everything.
---
I think I'll be online Friday, maybe 2-3 PST, let me know if you change your mind, I'll give you something for it.
---
Whenever another player has their cross-hairs on you, they can see your name and health-bar at the top of the screen, even if you're in stealth.
---
I saw someone on Reddit saying that if someone was spending too long at their camp, they were probably duping. I'm like wtf? I spend long periods at my camp going through my shit, crafting, scrapping, repairing and deciding where to go next. Is someone gonna show up and shoot me while I'm minding my own business?
---
&gt; If you do a google search and limit your searches to the dates of 2005 - 2011,

Yeah well lol still stuck to this decade.

I won't have more comments.
---
That is what I did. Wasnt sure if it was known. Thanks
---
"Don't touch Gary. Good advice." 
---
I think what the OP is trying to say is that it ruins the immersion when you‚Äôre coming to help someone.  IRL shit is going to get damaged and the owner should have to accept that in exchange for the help.  For a lawless time, there certainly is a lot of past judgment on this software‚Äôs part.
---
Awesome.   Also, do you turn in one tech data at a time?   Or two at a time??   Does it matter?
---
Sure you do... must be nice to live in some fantasy world. 
---
I dont have any slots for shotgun or melee. Whats the best backup Rifle or automatic rifle?
---
I don't think everyone is a duper, but when someone offers to sell me in-game items for cash then it's a reasonable assumption. Anyway I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep, so you'll have to find someone else to troll or just go back to telling people to kill themselves like the well adjusted basement dweller you are ‚ô•
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox you wanna sell me that plan?
---
Attacking a passive player sets a certain amount of caps as 'reward money'
---
Whoever wins the resulting duel (if both players attack eachother) gets the reward money which is subtracted from the loser's caps
---
I'd like to see the 'canon' play through, or as close as you can get, assuming no actual play through would be accepted as Canon.  Like, would y'all do all the missions first?  Or grind events?   Grab workshops, or ignore them for the main story?  In character as the last Human out of the vault. 
---
Actually, I read a whole lot of "Nah, you're paranoid, the fallout community is too good for that" Which amused me, because I always knew there was a massive push from Bethesda to recruit the rust-type players into the game... Which means a lot of griefers and sociopathic asshats.  
---
Yeah I thought you‚Äôd ignore most of the post and focus on trying being that guy that assumes everyone on the internet is a child or looks like one. Anyway, good luck surviving in the real world. I suggest that when you piss off the wrong guy, you learn your lesson fast. ‚úåüèª
---
What is the point of this comment? The pylon doesn't work as intended, your dribble addresses none of that lol.
---
I like to stay at my camp and listen to the radio as I read my phone...
---
hey, I tilt at windmills on reddit when I'm bored during the day, you get off on murdering innocents who don't want to participate in your "i'm going to murder you" RP. 
---
So, people will probably jump me here, as it‚Äôs happened before. But
---
You can turn in **two** at a time, as long as you collect both on the same server, and turn it in before changing servers
---
You will be granted 40caps and generally a better chance at loots
---
If you hand in one data, or collect two over two different servers, then hand it in, you will be granted 25caps, and from my experience, crap rewards like purified water and ammo only
---
Just an FYI you can encounter the merchant alive by the Sylvan and Sons logging. It doesn't sell anything but it is kinda cool to kill it instead of seeing it dead all the time.  Though now I wonder if you can tame it...............fuck now I have to clear camp space to try.
---
I had to send the screenshots to my alt PSN account, send them back to my main and download them through the PSN Messager app on my phone. Pretty convoluted lol
---
Lol what do you want us to say? 
---
That's my new insult. "Hey your name's fuckin' Todd Howard isn't it?!?"
---
Sorry, PC. I'd also hold off on learning shielded until you learn protective first. Learning shielded may interfere with protective being able to drop.
---
Just let me know when you are on. I don't have a plan available, but I do have the weapon itself.  Plenty of people have helped me, I definitely don't need anything. Just pay ot forward when you can.
---
One of my alts is a pure rifleman (currently specc'ed to semi-auto, though I'm going to rank up commando to be able to go full-auto) and I just decided a few nights ago that I wanted to start using a radium rifle.  
---
I bought the plans, made a few, scrapped them, and quickly realized how long it will take.  
---
I would jump at the chance to buy one of your legendary radiums with the upgrades already done to it. Let me know which, if any, are potentially up for sale and what price you're looking to get!
---
Bloodied melee weapons are best, get +3 stats at low health armor, the nerd rage perk, serendipity perk, radicool perk, and the adrenal reaction mutation. If you get your rads down to about 40% life you can keep healing up to that much. Try to find a bloodied melee weapon with either 40% attack speed, 50% damage when target below 40% life or 40% more power attack damage. My 40% attack speed bloodied combat knife does over 300 damage per hit and attacks like 4-5 times a second.
---
I still haven't heard a single reason why there should be a such a small limit on caps. Even if you only selling things do vendors for 1,400 a day it would still take you only three weeks to reach the limit. For why?
---
Personally I like hoarding caps, I don't know why for sure, I guess I just like having a nest egg in case I do want to go on a spending spree. I did the same thing in fo4, Skyrim, and WoW.
---
In large part because Bethesda has chosen not to do anything about this. They implement a "slap damage" system, but it doesn't work. They're making PVP servers, while going out of their way, over and over again, that they have no plans to address their core demographics desire for PVE servers. 
---
This situation where players who don't like PVP games, but want to experience the largest fallout map to date, are FORCED to co-inhabit servers with imports from RUST and similar games, is 100% on bethesda. 
---
PVP is very broken right now. With the right gear and perks it could appear someone is cheating when in fact they just are very knowledgeable about the current meta for PVP. Apparently there are counters for all these but I don't know much about PVP because I avoid it, I just read posts that people brag about being able to counter these meta builds.
---
Did you try nukacrypt.com?
---
Report them for cheating, just in case. I do it often when people seem a bit sus in what they‚Äôre doing, either just watching them do something sus or being involved in pvp and noticing something off. In all games. I know some people will try and troll by telling me I only report because I‚Äôm salty but nah, it‚Äôs because those people won‚Äôt get banned if they aren‚Äôt cheating so you might as well report everyone who seems a bit suspicious.
---
"I have an hour to play a video game, and instead, I had to spend twenty minutes server hopping, and another five meeting up with my friends again, because some sociopathic sack of shit decided he wanted to take his TSE shotgun to my level twenty face". 
---
I got an explosive the dragon 3* yesterday that I would like to rename to "Must be repaired every 30 shots" or something, thanks
---
I hit about level 54 before I got bored. All quests done, all locations, best armor / weapons for my build, badass camp etc. so I started a new character and just took it more slow. Tired a new build that I normally wouldn‚Äôt do. Had some good fun.
---
Nice!  Glad she had a good first experience.
---
How would he know how much health you had if he wasn't on your team?
---
A full set of assassin‚Äôs is -40%, a full set of Cavalier is -75% while sprinting.    So is immune to PVP while sprinting.    Knock him down or wear him out.  
---
You can draw aggro of the Mole Miners before they attack the extractors, and even draw them to you as they are attacking extractors. It's possible to stay hidden for bonus damage, if stealth is your play style. When the legendaries show up, they automatically detect you.  
---
It helps to know where the spawn points are for the Mole Miners. I try to toss down some mines in the recessed areas, away from player traffic areas.
---
&gt;setting up camp next to Charlestown Station (this prevents the responder bot)
---
Can you elaborate on this? It prevents the bot from spawning? Or you can't trade with it or something? It's just this station that is affected
---
I have no intent on setting up camp next to this station (I'm permanently just south of the Top of the World station for the acid node)
---
I think my girlfriend's cat poops in my shoes because he's jealous.
---
Easy enough to encourage by having certain outer outfits provide appropriate bonuses, like Enclave Officer effects Energy weapons, BoS gets bonus to Heavy or plasma, Raider outfits Melee, etc.  
---
I dunno, "pretentious" is a pretty pretentious word.
---
This is a known problem. It needs fixing. 
---
In the meantime, though, one ought use reasonable prudence to protect oneself. For instance, I have an Jetpack on one X-01 torso and an emergency protocols mod on another. I switch them out situationally, but they're both rare spawns at the Enclave vendors, and I would never have left either in my inventory so that it could be accidentally scrapped. And of course, the one not in use is stored on a power armor frame so it only weighs 10 lbs. So yes, that's one more power armor frame to juggle and guess at the contents of, another known problem that hopefully they'll soon fix. But in the meantime, knowingly exposing oneself to the risks of the "scrap bug," if one wants to call it that (and I won't argue) is imprudent.
---
Is that pretentious too?
---
You, doing something you enjoy, _specifically targeting people who don't want to participate in that thing_ makes you a _shitty_ person, yes. 
---
"I want to do it, and you don't, and I don't care" is the type of shit serial killers and rapists say dude. 
---
See the thing is, my parents payed for karate lessons since I was 2. I'd karate chop your fat ass back into prehistoric times. It would be good for you though. Forced diet and such.
---
KH3 comes out tomorrow and I've already decided to shelve Fo76 until I've completed that, here's hoping it isn't a major content patch.
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4 and this happens a lot with me. But I also use VATS primarily. 
---
Usually see it when I down a scorchbeast and whatever graphics requires it to tumble to and across the ground causes me to start to flicker. Also usually die because of it in the middle of a scorched group. I haven't found an actual counter to it yet, but occasionally I'm able to open the pipboy and it stops the vats, but I have to mash the pipboy button fast enough to catch it in between the flickers. 
---
That may have been me I stopped using my sound bar.
---
To sieze the inflation, mostly  cuz of dupers. As long as someone has 1 billion nukacolas, caps limit should be
---
Hey at least he's not hogging the Watoga Vendor
---
i laugh everytime someone complains bout bloody /unyielding. wait till you guys found out about vats/crit and the neverending crits on a fast automatic rifle. 
---
Wut
---
That sucks. Not sure of the condition of your game but for me it was like trying to play 76 on a 20 year old Compaq Presario.
---
I mean, I'd honestly rather this was a co-op game, where I hosted a server and my friends joined me on adventures, instead of being forced to play with _xXxIgetoffonmurderingpuppiesXxX_ and _rapeisn'tacrime666_. 
---
Paid* arse* And I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre very deadly with your karate skills lil‚Äô guy. You would just scare the dickens out of me.
---
Dupebusters
---
Or we could all ignore the troll.
---
Cure it all
---
Spend 200-500 caps on a new marsupial mutation
---
I sell regularly for 250c on xbox if it‚Äôs any indication of price
---
Don't matter. Killed it again just now with 10 people in zone and 5 of them were sub level 50. Learn to play. This game is Soo easy. One person uses cryolator freezes it on ground other person runs unarmed melee build in stealth hitting for 20k+ dmg a hit and you will kill it in 5mins or less every single time. 
---
The Wanderer does lots of permadeath runs.  IIRC, most recently he's like 60 hours into a Fallout:Frost permadeath run.
---
* Assasin refers to the legendary prefix effect of -8% damage from players
---
* Sentinel refers to the legendary major effect of -15% damage when not moving.  (FWIW, I think I read recently that jumping without any forward/backward/strafe/etc isn‚Äôt moving)
---
* Five pieces of this would give -115% damage taken if not moving. 
---
* Hacking: no (except to the extent that duping was used in the past to have more items of this type in the economy)
---
* Reasonable: no
---
Lock your doors, Bethesda is coming for you.
---
Scare the dicks out of you? No need to bring your sexual activities into this.
---
yes well my PvP opt in servers aren't up yet, or maybe they have I haven't touched the game in a few days.
---
When I can filter by people interested in murdering each other I will, are you trying to tell me that until then i shouldn't play the game in a way I enjoy?
---
Cause I don't want to so you can't either is what vegans, religous nuts, and dictators say.
---
Spelling really isn‚Äôt your strong suit is it?
---
Please no; the current patch schedule happens around bedtime for me. 3am would be right at the time I get home from work, prime play time. 
---
Best bash addition to, at least visually! 
---
Next time ill save the recording
---
Just don't stare too hard. Might start seeing yourself in the character and lose your noodle.
---
Not really but karate chops are.
---
I have been known to Gat. It has happened.
---
*Another* tip: I haven't verified this one yet, but I have *heard* that the Martial Artist perk (melee weapons weigh less and swing faster) also applies to the Gatling Gun. This could be a bug - but it could also be a functional choice, since you have to manually crank the Gatling Gun. Either way, if it's true, this gun can \*really\* roar.
---
I'm just starting, already hitting bug wall after bug wall, and it's quite frustrating.
---
I play sniper every fallout and I keep hearing melee is end game king, so am I hearing right that weapons (ranged) are being nerfed?
---
I'd really like to know now before I get to end game and quit anyways.  Save me a lot of time if I knew what was happening for sure now.
---
think this is one of the reasons bloodied builds favor endurance cause even though your at low health you have more than 10hp.
---
Pork* chops chubby. Keep eating, food is a great way to deal with stress.

After lv 50 you can either pick a new perk card or move a special point

A comment on reddit thats actually funny what 
---
We can't even walk 10 steps without blue screening. It's completely ridiculous. I absolutely love Bethesda bit god damn, we can't even play.

That‚Äôs what I was thinking of doing taking it slow I think I just rushed through. And I was doing a lot of server hopping

I'm a goofy duper now #Your all goody dupers now!

That's why my work benches are on the second floor, above water. I can log off and drop them into the water.

What are the other effects?
---
Dont do it. If you get it to your camp it will eventually die and turn into 20% unusable stored space in your camp. Its a cool feature but it needs a patch. If you value your budget man then dont do it. Wait for them to fix it.
---
A couple of other ideas I have used for alts that I haven't really leveled up is a super sledge with the electricity mutation for Thor and a power armor build with energy weapons for Iron Man.
---
Seriously.  3 out of 4 of my kids are colorblind along with myself.  We all are gamers.  It's something that puts us on everyone else's level when playing.  Some things we never even get to experience because normal vision people don't even entertain that we are unaware/unable to perceive things others do.

Oo, please share on r/FO76roleplay !!

Thank you.

"don't kill my death claw" at your exploit TSE base camp at the lego farm where deathclaws can spawn on the other side?

Seems a little risky

Can you share more info about the ant-explosive paint for Ultracite PA? I'm having trouble tracking down details and am wondering if it's something unreleased from the dev room, or else how to acquire it.

Let me get back to my camp and I will let u know. Give me a few.

---
Server.exe has stopped responding  
---
So they say, I haven‚Äôt been able to get it there yet, though I‚Äôve only really been trying the last few days.
---
It's not a purely  PVP game, though, that's the thing. If it was purely a PVP game, there wouldn't be an issue here. But they build in things like the slap damage system, and pacifist mode...but they aren't strong enough to actually STOP a sociopathic asshat who gets off on murdering people who can't stop him from wrecking your day. 
---
But bethesda's largest audience, throughout their history, are people who enjoy single player games where we don't have to deal with _scum_ like that. 
---
In other fallout games, if you have an issue with raiders, you can avoid them. In this game, if some jackass decides he wants to fuck with you, he can walk up to you, murder you in about six hits even with slap damage with his duped TSE shotgun, and then follow you as you fucking server hop away and do it again. 
---
And yeah, I'm sick to _death_ of people going "Hey, I'm just RPing a raider" when no, that's not what you're fucking doing. No one. Not ONE of the griefers i've ran into, is roleplaying SHIT. They walk up to you, murder you in a few hits through the fucking _laughable_ protections for non-pvp players in this game, steal your loot, and destroy your base, or whatever the fuck it is they want to do. No RP involved, just bought duped weapons and x-01 armor. 
---
Because I don't give a shit if a person who wants to engage in PVP engages in PVP with other people who enjoy that content...you're about 15% of the playerbase, based on console achievement statistics, but have fun. 
---
The issue is the _griefers_ who inflict their "fun" on _non pvp players_. If you walk up to someone who isn't flagged for PVP and fuck with them, you're a _shitty fucking person_ no assumption necessary. 
---
And if you're posting in this thread, defending those people, you're a pretty shitty person too. 
---
You..you didn‚Äôt look at the image?
---
 The awful thing is the guy I'm playing now is a plan whore and has everything he wants. He scrapped both those guns. ;)
---
You won't know until its revealed on the wall of the enclave bunker
---
Omg yes please! Especially the real time perk swap! 
---
Pork chops are too lean. If I wanted to be a chubster like you I'd have to buy tubs of cheese. I don't get payed enough to afford that shit though.
---
&gt;Explosive Shielding paint
---
I'm wondering about this too‚ÄîI've seen it mentioned elsewhere but have yet to see anything solid. Did you ever find details?
---
That's true, after they got nerfed there really isnt much point in taking them over. It's not worth the risk or reward 
---
I do know. And Unyielding/Bloody helps that build you described become even more ludicrous.  TSE nerf was stupid, all it did was limit builds.
---
I have the same problem. I however switched to gatling as it does far more damage and uses much less ammo. I still do really like the look of the .50 cal and i may use it again if i find a good legendary 
---
Also, there are purple berries in water holes, and I think the pitcher plants too.
---
Agreed. All or nothing baby.
---
Both.  One is written from the monster's perspective.   Both.
---
Paid*
---
if you say so big boy.
---
Agreed. 
---
I was so disappointed in the lmg too, not at all like it would be irl on a bipod. Stabilized perk should be a equivalent to bipod you would think.    
---
This is true..for any vendor. 
---
Idk but if you go to nukacrypt.com you'll find the launch codes for every week
---
I want freaking red.   Every military in the world uses red lights for tactical ops, wtf do we use green?
---
What do you mean you can‚Äôt find it? You can always nuke it yourself.  But I have noticed there haven‚Äôt been as many nukes as before.  It takes time to run through the silos, especially with ammo and stims, and now that the reward is less not a lot of people are doing it
---
I read that in Howard Stern's voice as he does the name game on occasion. 
---
Were you really born in 66? If so, I thing your fist and hip would crack before any skulls.
---
Fair enough. I will probably start a new character and go balls put with that one until they ironed out the issues down the track.
---
If it just showed total stack weight &amp; actually sorted by that instead of individual item weight, I don't think the system would be too bad.
---
I use the Better Inventory mod, and it's lovely, but it doesn't work on containers/stash only when viewing personal inventory via Pip-Boy. Not sure if it was due to difficulty of implementation or what, but I surely wish the mod could do it if not the game itself. 
---
It‚Äôs January 28
---
If large structures do cause lag and increase the load on the servers, then CAMP increases should be tied to progression in some way, so that they're only given to players who are actually dedicated to the game, and not just spamming pink flamingos everywhere. 
---
 aren't they! My first time dying in this game was to a pack of radrats in some cemetery, now I'm lvl 103 and they still bother me. I'd rather fight a scorchbeast
---
Think* I wasn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm in my twenties. I‚Äôve been in a lot of fights big guy. I know what I‚Äôm talking about when it comes to hurting people lmao.
---
Oh, sure, it would be good for everyone to read up on all the press releases before they buy it. If Bethesda didn‚Äôt want to alienate their loyal fan base, though, they shouldn‚Äôt be making the game a pvp shithole that makes it difficult for the people who actually like their franchise to enjoy playing. Besides, we were also told that we could avoid pvp by not engaging and using pacifist mode, which is actually not true. You have to leave the game and restart on a different server to actually do that. 
---
Besides, if Tom had said in the same statement that other players would be constantly destroying everything you build, consistently using weapons that are obscenely more powerful than anything a normal player can get, and making it so that you can never get the bounty for aforementioned destruction because it‚Äôs easily taken by one of their friends - letting them destroy your shit ad infinitum with zero consequences until you give up and leave the server - people might have been more reserved in buying the game. 
---
Or, you know, they could have just emphasized aspects of the game that fallout players actually like. 
---
Nobody discuss the Gatling gun, abuse it in silence while we can üòÇ
---
I‚Äôd really like it if additional stash boxes in a camp  could hold its own set of items, even if it was still connected to the main stash. 
---
Set ammo cans to easily store each type of ammo. 
---
Store types of armor apart in order to build up sets. 
---
Food-only containers (ice boxes that extended condition and made Nuka cola ice-cold would be amazing! )
---
Clothing/outfit storage(with someday it actually being displayed in-world on a stand)
---
Bobblehead and magazine storage with a ‚Äúshelf‚Äù that displays the items inside, the items are still actually inside the stash so if someone destroys it in world it doesn‚Äôt really matter
---
What i mean by cant find is ive been hopping for like the last two hours and found one but it crashed instantly. I mean at this rate it would be more effective to nuke it myself but like you said, it takes a lot of ammo, stims and time
---
I beat three or four SBQs over the weekend and only got loot from one.
---
What are the 8 pieces this week?
---
One of my teammates Saturday night was glitched naked and wearing only one leg of power armor, btw the char model nide with no.power armor is extremely.....creepy 
---
Why were they destroying it in the first place?
---
Only if you can cut off the owner's hand in PVP and use as a key. 
---
Imo ppl got bored of doing the same thing for 2 months so they're nuking less or simply doing other stuff.
---

Oh no way! I finished the "One Violent Night" with you earlier today! I thought i recognized the mask-suit combo. I've got a Mirelurk King at my Camp right now.
---
What else is there to do?
---
This is a good idea and especially it would be easy to implement due to fallout 4 having almost all of the same things (armor stand, bobble head shelf, magazine rack, etc)
---
Not really sure. Possibly thought it belonged to someone higher level? 
---
You can still kill people when their in pacifist mode, it just takes more bullets
---
Except a bunch of us getting the crashes don't have the targeting hud installed, nor have we ever.
---
Sorry dude there isn't any yet and no data miners have found any
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind for the alt I‚Äôm building, gonna be melee and big guns all the way
---
No it's not. The nuke codes for the past week doesn't work anymore, i tried. And it's 3 Am BTW.
---
Whatever you say grandpa. The only way you hurt people is in video games or by sitting on them. Real tough guy we got here lol! 
---
It's a known issue, should be fixed in a patch soon

Bethesda is located in the US, where it is 9pm right now.

30 percent damage to animals
---
25 percent faster fire rate
---
90 percent reduced carry weight

I'm mobile, just did now....lol wtf!
---
Hello! I'd buy the instigating AP cost one from you for 1k and pay you 200 per mod to attach suppressor, hardened, superior recoil version long barrel and stock, long recon scope, and armor-piercing magazine with either higher capacity or reload.
---
Would that be reasonable?
---
Bookmarked with gusto! Thanks!
---
starched genes solves the radaway issue. rad-x shouldnt be used with mutations however
---
I can't speak for others, but I moved on to other games until BGS adds more content. I know that's not helpful, but as long as the fo76 endgame is grinding sbq / whitesprings and hoping that luck grants you a useful legendary or recipe ... there's no guarantee you'll ever get anything worth your time.
---
Good luck to you. I hope you find what you're hoping for.
---
1. P34  
---
4. Invisible monsters kill me when i log in. cannot move. Other players then take my junk or I can't even hit x to respawn.  
---
I was actually thinking that last night. Def a missed opportunity!
---
Do you need technical data, or is this just a. Observation? What platform?
---
More like what im hopping for...
---
I'm addicted to creating alts
---
They said there will be new pve content in March 
---
Yeah, the other night me and a mate didnt have a single disconnect. Although entering building made us both invisible to the other which got old 2 months ago.
---
Next day I jump on and lasted 10 minutes before a disconnect. I just shut the game down and couldnt be bothered playing. 
---
I have far more enjoyable games that are stable.
---
You can believe that if you like lol. But if you really feel insecure enough that you have to assume everyone is weaker or fatter than you, hit up a psychiatrist, for real. I‚Äôm not trolling. You clearly have some serious insecurities that need sorting, either body issues, female rejection, whatever. I‚Äôve seen psychiatrists myself and they help even if it seems stupid at first. Using the internet as a distraction for your insecurities is only going to make them worse. Hopefully you make the right choice, good luck.
---
Me and my flatmate have had this on PS4 a few times generally when fighting the queen
---
PC: Just lost my best armor by accidentally pressing R on it to drop (was in my base organizing items) no paper bag on ground, I searched everywhere. Sucks. Day before lost all my fusion ammo by shooting a bugged gun (assultron head), that sucked because I was saving all that ammo for 30 levels.
---
Gatling Gun has good damage per shot and you can make mass amounts of 5mm with Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper.
---
Pair that with heavy damage perks, stabilized (the armor piercing helps) and martial arts effecting it and you can kill weak stuff reliably. Bust out the LMG or 50 cal (preferred) for the moments you need high dps or a really great way to tag a shitload of mobs.
---
Yup, this bug is still in the game. I found out about this today when trying to use this really nice legendary spear I picked up. The funny thing is, it has a faster swing speed as a legendary bonus but it doesn't seem to be affecting it at all when in power armor.
---
That or maybe it's because we know how to play .. I can hit for 20k+ dmg a swing. 
---
You‚Äòll only wear PA when in nuke zones in the end game. The true end game gear are the 3star legendary armor pieces, which make you really powerful. I don‚Äôt like PA as well, you‚Äôll just have to stick with it a certain amount of levels, when going into high level areas. That is until you find / trade some good regular armor. My DR at the moment while wearing regular armor is higher than that of my PA. Just be patient, you‚Äôll get there.
---
It's just one F\*\*\* up after another. People who have left waiting for more content will return to find their weapons and armor nerfed into oblivion. XP has been nerfed. Loot drops have been nerfed. They sure know how to make their players happy.
---
Bright red would be nearly invisible in grass for me.  That would be very difficult.
---
It‚Äôs terrible. I was in a group of 4 and relogging to spawn all the enemies was very inconsistent.
---
Perfect. How much you want for it?
---
&gt;711 hours of gameplay  
---
So roughly 10 hours a day, every single day, for 2.5 months straight.  
---
Maybe they were just trying to help you out by giving you a reason to step outside your house.  
---
You on?
---
Yeah, got 1000+ output
---
Sure, but in my server it doesn't like it's January 28 because the nuke codes dos'nt work anymore. Some Streamers are working on it to look for the nuke codes.
---
Forget the workshop if you don't want to risk pvp. Just drop a fusion generator and power the fusi√≥n core machine. 
---
My first thought when I saw this thread ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
---
I still get the naked or invisible bug when zoning in a group. In fact I still get the naked morphed bug they claimed to have fixed. There's a possibility the dupers may have been on holiday when I played, who knows. 
---
I've had that happen to me! Except instead of cat it was my uncle so....
---
How big is the update? 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 120 and I‚Äôm never in power armor. But also my 3* bos combat armor in my eyes is stronger and better then combat armor. Plus the deep pocketed mod I have like 405 carry weight. Only time I wear PA is in nuke zones.
---
Why? Cuz they intend on selling that feature via the Atom Shop at some point I‚Äôd bet.
---
Ding ding.  My thoughts exactly.  
---
Looking to start fresh sorry this build
---
My megasloth pet, Mary can't be killed. It always comes back. I can't get rid of it either and I had to hear the annoying roar every minute. In the end, I build my camp way up at the peak of Seneca Rocks and left Mary at the bottom of the hill. Travelers have been hearing weird noises whenever they approach Seneca Rocks since then.

Me getting a quest to get it then getting fucked in the end

Why no bloody mess it's free damage

Power armor=no stealth. I'm big guns n' I loooovve my power armor, but it's all about the go big or go home for me. I really like the weightless armor, I don't care if the piece is bad it's better than nothing. I barely ever need to fix my armor; I also believe in shooting first and saving all my questions for the end.
---
I find myself staying away from normal armor that's the only thing I haven't worked on yet for my crafting character I guess should but I want to get a stealthy character going
---
Two things you might be missing...
---
1. The animal must be solo. Nothing in a group can be tamed.
---
2. The animal must be a random spawn. There are tons of random instances across the map. Either walk around and hope to run across a tameable creature (Cranberry Bog is good for this as there are a ton of RI spawns there), or find a good place to server hop. I got my deathclaw at a RI location in the Mire. The spawn occurs under a bridge. It was near Treetops if I remember correctly.
---
Hope any of this helps.
---
You can remap the default key to open that wheel.
---
But no, you can't unmap the mouse wheel from it, which I 100% agree sux.
---
If your uusing power armor mostly mod regular armor with weightless, its still handy if you need to hope out to grab a bench. End game gear favors non power armor but you need alot of rng to get a nice set.
---
Same here. 
---
Go for 100 to get the achievement, then restart. I ran single shot rifles and two handed first build. Now i have a second, running pistol, Intelligence and charisma for group play.
---
Lol, so now you're telling me you're nuts and fat? I guess I can't call you nuts, that's not PC. Do you prefer mentally disabled? I mean the only people that see head docs are nuts. Did they put you on zombie meds? Man I'd hate to be on zombie meds. I wouldn't mind a script for some speed though. I don't get payed enough to get the good shit like crack. You ever do crack before? It's crazy. No hunger at all. Eh, that would probably be bad for your heart considering you were born in 66.
---
I'm in power armor when shit gets real. Nuke zones, high level pvp, surrounded by diseased scorchbeasts. Beyond that I run about in junk weight reduction armor. I play a support sniper so any armor needed means I'm not good at my job. That and I use adrenal reactions and empath so I don't really have survivability anyway.
---
So alone!
---
You have to have both perks maxed and equipped at the same time. So you'll need 6 charisma. Also it won't work on a set spawn it needs to be a random encounter. Then you will get the tame and send to camp option. A good spot is a pond north of Abbies bunker with a crashed certified has a random spawn. Won't always be a megasloth though. Also you need to be double to level of anything you tame. Even though its level will drop when it gets to camp. The megasloth I tamed was like level 40 something and it's at lvl 20 at my camp. Also note it will aggro just about anything sometimes even passive. I had to move camps because it kept aggroing a neutral scorchbeast and it kept destroying part of my camp. Hope this helps clear some of it up
---
lol yea that was me :) was i putting power armor down to block the doors
---
Thing is I killed that scorchbeast some distance away.  It‚Äôs corpse respawned in my CAMP! 
---
On those rare times when I have a surplus of screws, springs, and gears I like to build a bunch of fully modded level 5s and give them out to random newbies
---
Any shot you could snag it and I could pay you for it??
---
I think the key isn't it being nerfed, but rather in how it's nerfed. Should just not apply to PvP, period.
---
It would have to be far enough away from the named location
---
Plus commission 
---
What's your build?
---
So do all types of foundations and walls use the same budget? I ask because in Fallout 4 I know that, for example, concrete foundations used more settlement budget than wooden ones, and the same applied for walls.
---
It‚Äôs 23,000 which I don‚Äôt have, I‚Äôll get it but I want a TSE something
---
PA in high level pvp is a no go lol
---
Lord me neither lol good looking out thou I appreciate it
---
You can just use it to go into nuke zones. I don't like power armor at all. I'm level 132 and I only use it in nuke zones.
---
Only when full of junk or in a nuked zone/High rads area. Since the power core nerf, i hardly seem to find them anymore MonkaS
---
I'm pretty sure stuff on vendors is different for every person.
---
Hahaha please take this test. *hands S.A.F.E test* 
---
I‚Äôm looking for one too
---
I've gotten around this by removing the floor above (just store it) and then replacing it after I get things where I want them.
---
i would love it if merchants had more stuff that you would want to buy, example. increase the total number of mods and plans that can spawn at once, give us a reason to buy them. especially if looking for a specific one
---
Ok I figured it out. I SHIT YOU NOT not only did I have a huge base but 12 TURRETS
---
Yep. The ferns are easiest to find especially if you have a white headlamp as opposed to a colored lamp.
---
How can u have a shit build in fallout 76, it ain't rocket science, lol.
---
Furious effect stacked with concentrated fire and the headshot/belly multiplier doesn't compare, now single shot explosive is totally different as you get the vats accuracy. its ok if you don't get it, you can carry on using your duped tse. Have fun, I'm out.
---
So I‚Äôve been researching and all I‚Äôve found is that you can randomly get it from the tech data drop daily at the BoS fort....I‚Äôve been doing it everyday for a week and no luck so far. If anybody knows if there‚Äôs another way, holler at me please!!
---
Right, so give me the caps and a TSE and I‚Äôll buy it and give the recipe, but working about 1/2 hour, my wife wants to play now
---
It prevents the bot all together. No random spawn events occur if a players camp radius covers the spawn point.
---
 The responder bot is unique to that location so it has an impact on players looking for rare clothing and items.
---
Some official lore videos would be awesome. Things like Grahm &amp; Chally's Origin story (maybe with some inside tips on how to find him easier). A tour of the non-station/whitespring vendors with some tips on where to find some rare items/plans, Some workshop building tips and examples, a video focusing on some of the best "environmental storytelling" around the map (teddy bears, etc) and maybe some inside info on some of the graffiti (sickleman, all of the alien drawings, the name written in chalk by the harper's ferry vendor) 
---
A person can search for me, friend me and meet on the same server, right?
---
Why are you here
---
Lvl 101 rifleman
---
^ +2 for Marsupial mutation to help with Melee enemies. You start to get good at the old jump and shoot. Great for larger enemies like deathclaws etc to keep a distance while shooting.
---
The Martial Artist perk also works with gataling gun that makes it shoot much faster.
---
So alot of players see the water, the proximity too the station and the relative calm of Charlestown as good place to camp. They are right, but it still causes issues for other 
---
Yes indeed. 
---
Just make me a reasonable caps offer
---
It's a pvpve game meaning you cannot fully avoid pvp. And honestly I'm just gonna rebute your like 9 paragraphs with simple lines.
---
1. Changing servers instantly removes the raiders ability to effect you at all l, so don't like it? Change server.
---
2.your right but here's the thing this isn't fallout "5" this is fallout 76 a new style of the game which is multiplayer and has pvp so saying the people who played fallout 4 liked single player more is not a shock.
---
3.i do about 15 to 20k dmg a swing with my melee build but I don't do that much dmg it's still 10 to 20 shots to kill in pacifist so your wildly exadurating also they cannot follow you server to server unless they are on your friends list which I question why they are.
---
4. not all raiders need to cackle maniacally hell all of charelston hundreds of people were killed as a crime of convenience, also you show how little you know about this game as xo1 is crap in pvp your litterally better off with wood armour with the right perks.
---
5. Only 70% of people even made it to flatwoods only 85% left the vault , and over 40% of players have killed another player meaning willingly engaged in pvp.
---
6. Server hop and they may as well not exist. Every single one of these threads is just people whining they got attacked cause they didn't want to server hop. I've had too server hop before even at level 260, had three tse shotguns open up on my base.
---
7. Love how you completely missed the bottom part of my post where I'm also an active trader and host queen carrys. Not to even mention regularly going out of my way to help new players as I'm overflowing with resources if I don't.
---
Or just level lock the scorched queen event to level 50. Problem solved.
---
Because it's boring as hell.
---
I stopped going when I see it. Granted I'm lvl 180 but I honestly hate it now.
---
Unfortunately SBQ isn't much better. Probably be more fun dropping a nuke on myself at this point. :) 
---
Some of this is incorrect. I was level 56 when I tamed a level 40 Radtoad, so you definitely do not need to be double the level of the tamed creature. I‚Äôve also seen people able to tame with only one of the cards maxed and equipped as well.
---
NO NO NO...if you have a silo locked down just by being in it..people with no life will just sit inside the silo...preventing anyone on the server from launching
---
I don't know............. Because I want to enjoy a game I paid for? 
---
They're not solved yet. Should have looked before going down there.
---
1.5k
---
Yeah and then that is expecting an exceptional level of trust to hand over 23k caps etc. I mean people have been trusting with me and I do the right thing and mod their armor or whatever, but a lot of people aren't as nice as me.
---
I made an alt ages ago and its been fun. 
---
Some ppl like to collect outfits, plans etc.
---
Grinding legendaries isn't the only thing to grind
---
Charlie is solved.

And when they were finished, I started playing Fallout...

Done. Perfect

That's a shitty business plan.

You can get a military ID in the brotherhood quest another way. I think I had actually completed the basic training and still had to pursue the other route, which involved a trip to Charleston.

I‚Äôve never seen a recipe in the science lab before, guess I‚Äôll be saving lots of caps so I don‚Äôt miss the next opportunity.
---
Most likely trying to get a bounty. You just happened to be the base they came across first. Congrats on getting lucky with it.
---
I'm going to make a post of my own "Why this op sucks still"........
---
You are not wrong on most points. Idk how they killed her at level 10, the rads alone are ridiculous. Sadly it's still a better game than most out there. Compared to instant gratification spammers like Fortnite or painful grinding games like World of Tanks, money is the only goal. The truth is actual quality games, meant for true old school gamers just dont come to fruition anymore.
---
Its a bugged weapon, much like "Pipe" the weapons name comes from a combination of the prefix (Railway, Pipe, etc.) and its mods, its meant to have a default receiver, but sometimes it spawns without one, normally with the "Pipe" weapons, when u pick one up, it'll respawn with the correct receiver, but looks like u managed to pick it up still bugged.
---
Pics please? Cha should be a Major affix and as far as I know you can only get 1* wood armor.
---
Look into vats/stealth builds. 
---
I've seen a few posted on here.
---
&gt; you can carry on using your duped tse.
---
I don't use TSE's I'm a self found player and I haven't found one. I've got several TS weapons and a couple explosives. Your lack of mathematical abilities and common sense is disturbing though.
---
Yea i get this too, xbox, no power armour.
---
It's happened a few times fighting the queen and I've been getting it for a few weeks. Maybe once every 8 hours or so so it's not that game breaking but needs fixing.
---
I've been using Mr Tongue sound board on open mic in Whitesprings. EXPLOSIONS!

Really big map that you only get to see 1/1000th of.
---
Body breaks down with all sorts of ailments that should've been patched already.
---
Nothing to do.
---
All foundations and walls take the same %. 
---
And what were you expecting from Bethesda?. 
---
T least I‚Äôve got a screenshot to memorialize the event!
---
This is my spot too!!!  Mine is a raider camp though.  
---
Your post to me reflects on how you give up on the game, much different then constructive criticism 
---
This post was upvoted to about 3 or something, and then suddenly the shills started their control opinion campaign.
---
Well if ur kids are killing the queen at level 10, then it sounds like you and they are just rushing the game, im 160 hrs in, level 62. Not finished story not taken on the Queen yet. So for the lack of end game content, this does not concern me as of yet, because by the time i hit that point, new content will hopefully be released. So lesson is, dont rush.
---
Put everything in your stash box you need to repair it
---
Try to stash all junk and try again. 
---
Group with everyone sharing strange in numbers, you can literally fly.
---
Really that's news to me I couldn't get the tame option until I had then both maxed and equipped. I guess I never tested the level thing out just going off what I heard
---
Thanks for the info!
---
This guy is clearly a missile-boat chassis.
---
Xbox1- still inferior to ps4 but doesnt crash all too much anymore
---
It's a little sad when a couple crashes in a 2 hour period is considered an improvement.  I think right now I average a game-stopping event (disconnect, crash, freeze) at a rate of once an hour or so.
---
Wasn‚Äôt your drop lol 
---
Well when I bought this game, I didn't think I was buying an MMO but maybe it is just me.
---
Perhaps it's for the Ultracite Gatling Laser. Don't recall off the top of my head if the prime receiver plan had a different name for the Ultracite Gatling Laser.

I think just the two shot and explosive legendary weapon mods are getting nerfed, but will still be good weapons. Melee weapons are pretty strong with the rite perks but a two shot sniper rifle would still be great for you, although the mod lowers accuracy. 
---
There's a saying in my country, it was invented many years ago, survived two world wars and is used by many people who see others that live with the same conditions as you, a very deep one indeed, one you should remember for the rest of your live.
---
"Mimimi."
---
Nobody asked you and your children to buy the game. You already knew what the game was, you can read enough material on the internet to know what you're in for. It's incredible that I have to say something like this to someone who has children but: Grow up, mate. It's just a game. Enjoy it or don't, that's up to you but you're in the wrong reddit forum to state an opinion like that. Should've went to the Fallout reddit instead.
---
Drops are locked to whomever requested them now
---
Wait till they pick it open, then loot it all xD
---
Ya know what's funny? Your post is about as long as mine is. But you gotta get your dig in that I "write to much"?   
---
1) Bullshit. Unless you have the presence of mind to block the asshat. (and he's not currently destroying the shit you want to protect by server hopping) they can, and \_fucking often do\_ just \_follow you to the next server\_. That's a feature bethesda decided to implement.   
---
2) Expecting people who enjoy fallout games to NOT play this one because YOU'RE in it is fucking stupid, though. Bethesda is fucking stupid if they're flushing away all their core fanbases money to court that 15% of active PVP players. (seriously, per console statistics, it's about 15% of the player base that have killed 20 or more players).   
---
3) I was murdered, at level 35-40, in less than six swings. I'm not exaggerating shit.   
---
4) Is this english? I mean I get it, the idiot nuked the dam and murdered his girlfriend...  
---
5) Yeah, a lot of people gave up on this game because of it's many, many faults. For some reason, I still stick around, even if it means I have to share servers with people like you.   
---
6), again, as stated in 1,  is fucking bullshit.   
---
7) I don't give a \_shit\_ what else you do if \_part\_ of what you do is be a fucking scumbag. If part of what you do is walk up to and murder people who don't want to play (which, again, is what this post targets) then yeah, "but I also give to charity" isn't going to make you \_not\_ a flaming sack of shit. 
---
LMAO
---
I got the quest for it though and it was marked on my map and in game as the one I was supposed to go to.
---
Don't worry, most servers are empty. Last 2 nukes have been 4 ppl and not 1 person.
---
If they could get to you, then you're probably not a duper. I'm guessing the dupers tend to have their places really well defended. 
---
I've visited a couple of traders to try to trade the various legendary pieces I collect and have noticed that traders tend to have amazing setups such as locked doors with passcodes. Or one guy had 3 doors in one door frame. 
---
I assume that actual dupers are at *least* as well-protected as traders. 
---
There's a mod that makes the ui minimalist
---
Sure but what's it have to do with Dick Shale?
---
Oh I didn't know that, I got the quest pop and figured it was fair game, that's how it had been every other time before.
---
But since you weren't the one to request it, it still wasn't your drop.  
---
I built my base just outside the 4x radius of my friend. Next day playing my base wouldn't spawn, no matter how many servers because it was too close. Gotta be careful 
---
This needs more upvotes. 
---
..... that‚Äôs also not how pacifist mode works.
---
Cry 
---
r/outside
---
I'd mainly like to see more quests and *better* quests.  None of this "Let's spend 15 minutes following a sluggish Protectron around ha ha ha" crap.  I'd like to see several alternatives to Scorched Earth.
---
Your kids killer her at level 10 lol
---
Damn. They make legendary Ultracite Gatlings? I don't think I've seen one. 
---
Didn't realize that was the case now, I had gotten those quests before and everything was fine.
---
You're not wrong.  Let me rephrase: I feel that the OP is just ranting and will not actually quit the game for good.
---
and of course everyone hang in the same couple spots it is true for every online games 
---
Join my world. I am at Sutton station. 
---
Yeah, there seems to be a lot of misinformation about taming going around right now. No one seems to know exactly how it works yet, but the random spawn stuff and the animal being on its own appear to be certain.
---
This would feel too much like Borderlands, to me.
---
Perhaps in the notification area, we could get damage dealt.
---
I find myself in power armor in three situations. 1) it's actually easier to get stuff to repair power armor, so It's constantly repaired as a backup, when I'm in a tight spot...it's a full backup set for 10lbs. win/win 2) When I need to have more carry weight....unless you devote every slot to deep pockets, excavator with calibrated shocks is pretty much the best pack mule going. 3) nuke zones for rad protection. 
---
I can confirm just destroyed 2 launch cards using the code found online so it reset to a new code 
---
If it has a lock on it it‚Äôs not yours 
---
 At level 48 my level 40 BOS Heavy Combat Armor has about the same stats, minus the rad resistance, as my level 35 Excavator Armor.
---
 When I get my level 50 set and apply the Dense mod I finally found only the high end PA will rival it. I have an X0-1 on my other char.
---
 It is exhilarating to fight Scorchys and basically take no damage as long as I dodge the gas strafe in my Combat Armor. ;)
---
Only 5 reasons? That's the kind of lazy writing that'll get you hired at Bethesda Game Studios writing Fallout storylines
---
i have never found wood above 1*. i was just reinforcing how shitty wood is and how pointless in the game was. learn to read sarcasm fam
---
What about a movement speed and perception debuff? That'd balance out getting to wear armor
---
I have the plan. There are both Prime Ultracite and Prime non Ultracite Gatling Laser Receivers. 
---
I am at the enclave now, the recipe (have screenshot) is there for me at the enclave. With perks it‚Äôs 17,700 caps; I want a ATAE and I‚Äôll purchase it for you if you Supply the caps.
---
PS4 
---
Duper‚Äôs are putting stuff in the water and making the frogs gay!!!
---
THIS.
---
Level 82.
---
Haven't droped a nuke yet. 
---
Nothing. Nothing at all, he is completely unrelated. Why do you ask?
---
Yeah thanks both of you, I might have seen some cap markers when I've been killed, but I thought that was more about the player attacking me, getting a bounty.
---
If you're on PC, you can modify the .ini files and change the flashlight color as well as PipBoy and "QuickBoy" colors.
---
Can confirm this is correct. I got a sloth at my camp, but it's kinda noisy and throw things at me from time to time. There is no way for me to remove it.
---
Yea, ppl are definitely trying other places. I set up camp outside Summerville and then someone nuked it, blew out my house down to the studs! Lol
---
Yeah because this one is controlled by shills. But two can play at that game. If they won't allow dissenting opinions to naturally be shared and discussed, then maybe people should start making their own multiple accounts and using proxies to fight back against their BS.
---
Okay, now this is 
---
#EPIC
---
...that sounds like something a duper would say...
---
I liked the feel of FO3. I'm all for adding your own flair, but I think we've crossed the line. 
---
I also hate the bobbleheads and patriotic outfits. 
---
Would prefer the feel of Fallout New Vegas in that radiation zone. 
---
I feel it's just a classic case of gamers reaching endgame faster than anticipated plus sbq is a little underwhelming.
---
I killed a three star, level 35, to obtain sentry with my level 20 hunting rifle (b/c I‚Äôm only level 21) and got a one star rolling pin. I was quite frustrated. 
---
Will this patch be addressing phatom "stored" budget in camps? 
---
Yes.  Dropped a single worthless item to create the bag.  Then went into transfer mode, put something important in it, and exited.  Went to other PS4 to control other character which was standing there (only other person there) and ... no bag.  Went back to original character to check. No bag.  Content lost.
---
Doesn't bother me. Fanboys will be fanboys. Doesn't change the fact that the game was listed by gamestop as being a huge sales disappointment, and that gaming critics largely panned it. At this point, Bethesda knows it was a disaster. I want to see it turn around, but shoving your nose in their butts isn't going to make this game any better. It's been the huge waves of complaints that has brought on the fixes we have gotten so far. 
---
ok  thanks where can i find a walkthrough on how do that 
---
also having the exact amount can cause issues sometimes. try gathering more than you need.
---
Not so garbage if you have access to the plans to craft what you need. Let the plans carry over and you can up and running very quickly farming legendaries. No need to allow any inventory transfer.
---
See, your mistake here is asking for "balance changes" instead of "just nerfing things". Because bethesda has shown they don't know how balance changes \_should\_ work, and very clearly have ZERO interest in player input. 
---
Compare it to something like Borderlands. Or even other fallout games.
---
S post IMO.
---
I agree. Not saying end game is vast but it's keeping me still playing so far.
---
&gt; make a video
---
So, you recommend he dupe, and send proof of duping to Beth? Umm ... maybe an email describing it would be better
---
I really don't think it said Ultracite in the title tho. And I wasn't able to craft the Ultracite Fusion Core before I learned it.
---
Thanks so much for watching my videos. My kids found this post and told me about it. Cheers !
---
Yeah, the 4000 or so players who will be removed will surely kill this game. Not a chance. Getting rid of this gutter trash will have a positive effect on the community and go a long way to show the millions of players that there's a future to this game.
---
Buh-bye OP.
---
When I suggested they let us use the Pip-Boy app, I was downvoted to hell lol. I just want to use my pip boy IRL 
---
Camden park vendor bot has the plans pretty  frequently.
---
100% behind you on that. I enjoy it for what it is, but miss the story lines from 3 and Vegas. I really miss the suspense and detective work from deep space and resident evil.
---
Another possibility is that QA wasn‚Äôt given enough time to accomplish anything.
---
With Bloodied you have to have high rads and low health all the time, right?
---
I feel you, but don't get discouraged. If you don't feel like PVP it's best to just jump servers when you're being contested.
---
Use fireproof and it is. But thanks for your input.
---
Hahaha I suppose so
---
Finished the story line around 45, minus the nuke launch. Im into my 90s now, and not quitting, but missing some of the draw from the previous few games.
---
It's a bug where even people around you using it can crash your game.
---
I can help
---
Because the lore and plot make it that? Because every thing you're doing is following the footsteps of people trying to stop the scortch plague, spread by the scorchbeasts? 
---
 They did?
---
Id suggest to start building up a character properly asap, or youll lose a lit of time later respeccing
---
What if the shills upvoted it to 3 and then other players of the game where like "nah, this is crap" and downvoted it?  I'm just saying, it's a mystery and we'll never really truly know.
---
Oh I am not talking about the opinion on the content itself, but rather why one is considered endgame over the other. people get bored of end game content quickly and often no matter the game. (WoW for example who sold an expansion on the premise of things like allied races but have time gated it so much to keep drip feeding content those allied are still not in the game.)
---
I‚Äôm in
---
Same name as my name as my reddit for psn
---
In fallout 4 I had a freezing radium rifle which froze enemies with c riticals, would be cool if this was patched over.
---
I've kept a radium rifle in my stash for weeks as its the most expensive weapon , around 700 caps, I've never used it tho, might dust the old girl off and let her sing.
---
No, being equal should be enough to let you fast travel. Once you go over, that's when you become over encumbered and can't FT.
---
Yeah, when a garage door costs the same as a single wall I had to replace all double walls with garage doors to free up budget.
---
It sucks but now I can see what else I could do to free up space.
---
Thank you so much for doing this.
---
Their customer service sucks. Its a complitely useless pile of sht
---
Tried that. I left one after the first guy. Then the second server I had someone new do this. I am not a huge fan of PvP game. And for the most part I avoid attacking people.
---
All I know is the queen has given me both plans and I‚Äôve never even owned a Gatling laser. 
---
So, your claim is that Bethesda banned you simply due to a single report by what appears to be a 14 year-old?
---
Newp.
---
They investigated the report, found, presumably, 10k nuka colas or some such nonsense, and banned you rightfully.
---
Bye!
---
end of current story, sure, but my argument is that is a choice you get to make from the "end game" of the silo, end the story or nuke somewhere else.
---
And a great source for steel and lead scrap [Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ(Ã≤ÃÖ Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞Ã≤ÃÖ)Ã≤ÃÖ$Ã≤ÃÖ]
---
Note that garage doors also cost the same, I freed up budget just by replacing all double walls with garages.
---
were you playing the exact same way?
---
personally i find a couple things absolutely melt the FC: spamming vats (or just frequent use) and power attacks/gun bashing.
---
do you mean shit post? because its not intended to be.
---
I just recently got my atoms, so they are being done. Had to check my spam folder for some reason, but, yeah, they finally got around to it. Now I just got to wait 4-6 months until I get my bag.....
---
He was banned for using a particular weapon? No, he was banned for duping or profiting from it. When Bethesda investigated, they found that to be true.
---
Tell your friend I said: "Good riddance!"
---
Is restoring health after dealing high damage is still would be a thing? I've noticed it especially when any scorchbeast is in air and hitting it with my explosive shotgun health seems like dropping but restoring right away. But while it's grounded damage seems like dealing like intended. 
---
Eng isn't native.
---
I used to have 4 regular machine gun turrets. I tried to upgrade to heavy and I could only fit 3. You sure they‚Äôre the same?
---
You sir. Are the hero we needed. 
---
Yes forgot who said it but when people complained about only getting pvp some said we are getting quests, events, new loot, and vaults
---
They're banning cheaters and giving the actual playerbase hope for the future of this game.
---
Awesome!
---
Dude I've hundreds of hours in this game you won't lie to me about game mechanics and get away with itüòÇ. There is no stalker mechanic if you server hop they have a like 1 out of 50 chance of rejoining the same one as the rejoin server is random.
---
I'll state this again this isn't fallout 5 this is fallout 76 the first multiplayer fallout not everyone is going to like it because of that, that doesn't mean they should go onto forums and whine that means it may not be for them. Just like you dont see players playing fallout 1 2 and tactics(isometric view) as it's just not for alot of people.
---
If that legitimately happened the only way to do that much dmg is via a bug being patched tommorow. But I'll state it like this it takes me 10 or more swings to kill the level 10s that leech the queen and I do far more than any tse shotgun without said bug.
---
He nuked the damb because he wanted a spot to put his camp down and they were in the way.
---
You having not put the game down despite clearly not liking it doesn't mean you are somehow justified insulting the character of people you haven't met
---
Still is no stalker mode
---
They can easily outheal legit dmg or just run away(as I have done countless times) and setup an ambush(and usually win due to attacker PvP advantage) as the hit timer is very long(about 10 min or so), or as I said server hop. Also more often than not my PvP kills come from players with tse weapons refusing to run pacifist and allways hitting me because I am melee I'm not going to turn down free caps.
---
tfw ALL of the turrets are &gt;= 10%. aaaaaand this is why we can't have nice things. Seriously I scrapped all my turrets awhile back and gained half my budget back. That is absolutely ridiculous. Like I get they don't want bases that are 90% turrets, but dang.
---
Yup they did confirm all of that but really didn't give us the date or when.
---
Yea
---
I cant find enough of them to scrap for mods
---
I wrote a ticket a few days ago because of an issue and they replied incredibly quick. Sure it was just a Ctrl V answer but it helped.
---
Have you tried writing a ticket instead of an e-mail? 
---
Wait until you get a jetpack ü§£
---
&gt; My kids killed her around lvl 10 or so...  
---
Your kids didn't kill her at Lv. 10.
---
They just made it more difficult for the higher-ranked players who are actually doing the damage to kill her.  She scales based on the number of players involved in the battle, you see.
---
Tried to play 3 times today.  3 server crashes.  I really want to like this game but it's too broken for them to add anything to.
---
I pay attention to detail and am kind of intuitive. I understand probability at a deep level. Your posts is meant to through doubt on it. Oh we can't know for sure. Yes we can. We can know for sure that this subReddit is filled with shills. It's the one that is controlled. While the Fallout one is out of their control.
---
SBQ fights have been smooth this week, compared to all that came before of which we shall never speak again.
---
Seriously not a joke but a request because I haven't seen any of you guys reply to anything plasma/energy gun related. Make a playthrough where you are a plasma and energy gun main.

If you don't wrap your lips around Tod's rod, they may never let you display items on shelves.

It takes me an hour to get 3000 wood, if you get that in 2 minutes, then you‚Äôve must of gone to the super duper mart
---
We honestly haven't had the pvp issues in the Ps4 servers. Mostly a more mature audience there and we tend to work together. If you are on PS4, pm me and ill hook you up with the rather large group that we play with. Whom Ive met while playing this game...
---
That is odd. It took a good 5-7 clips and many, many enemy attacks for mine to get below the halfway point.
---
There arw non pa builds, they are plenty, build for me fallout=PA. Ill never get out of it
---
By email I meant ticket whoops lol. I'll go change that...but yeah this is through their tickets...no response.
---
Thanks a million to all that replied,I took over the power plant,and made a small purchase,I now have almost 28 fusion cores,problem solved,I knew about the plant,just never pursued it, hope to catch yas in the wasteland.
---
How is it griefing when the game literally tells you that PVP will be enabled the moment you claim a workshop?
---
Nice job! I made a similar list not long ago and I found that 2nd level floor pieces are actually cheaper than foundations by quite a bit. They're probably in the 0.1666% category according to your system (I was getting 3 per 1). I replaced roof items with those pieces and saved a nice chunk of budget. :3
---
Oh and wood/concrete stairs are 0.1666% as well I think. The metal ones seemed costlier.
---
I avoid the workshops altogether because that happened to me too. There're people who really get excited over every single bit of PvP, especially with lower level players.
---
I'd recommend gearing up the good 'ol PvE way so you can avoid PvPers completely.
---
When there is evidence that one party is using the exact same weapons. Already being sent in hopefully by now. Only one party being banned even then is still unfair. Especially if its the party that harrasses over messeges. 
---
Saved! Thank you!!!
---
It already happened. If you owned and played the game in 2018 you can download the games from the launcher under the "all games" section might also look like a &gt;&gt; button
---
Likely for stability but also so they can expand the area in the future.
---
I view it as goofy, but I don't have any problem with CAMP objects being that way.  A CAMP should be a reflection of yourself or your character.
---
Yes. You need to log into the Bethesda launcher on PC, the games are NOT available on PS4/Xbox.
---
Oh I see, well thats a spectacular question I will mull over a bit more and respond accordingly 
---
I was not using VATS i was manually shooting. Only used VATS with Concentrated fire to actually view the health of the limbs. But i went back ingame and tested it with VATS too and the results and conditions are the same as shooting manually. You can cripple limbs with and without VATS.
---
Try instead calling them üòâ NPCs!
---
Will test and add to the list later when I get more materials. Hoping to update after my college class tomorrow!
---
That makes sense as long as something is done about those 1 billion colas.
---
Oh sorry, I didn't know that.
---
Well that sucks Radtoad Eggs, Bethesda should really get behind it then. If they can't even support correctly how could they keep their player base then? =_= 
---
A few things that would help gameplay 
---
1) a way to compare gear / weapons against what you currently have equipped 
---
2) a way to lock gear / weapons 
---
3) do we have inside maps? We need inside maps 
---
Thank you, that's makes me sad they won't be doing a console port. But I suppose we don't want to see the potential tragedy or a poor port
---
No, it would make a mess of what is seen on screen.
---
Got it today!  Got the BOS Combat Arms Plan too :) all I need now is BOS Torso Plan.
---
Okay, thank you. I was more hoping for some kind of console port but let's leave that one be.
---
When I quit playing this game, which is soon, I'm done with it. Just like every other game when I move onto the next one. You see things through a distorted corporate prism. You don't see the reality. You don't see the real player experience. You want to control the narrative, but all the lies and fluff in the world isn't going to keep people actually playing this mess. Imagine if a company themselves were selling in game items, through a shell company, or something. And the "duping" was just a convenient cover story to make up for the poor stability and have someone to direct the blame towards. You know there is a big push back against microtransactions, and game developers and publishers are scared to get the ire of the playerbase concerning pay to win etc. I wouldn't be at all  surprised to find some links to marketing shilling companies attempting to control this subreddit, and links to items and caps selling websites.
---
When I see these kinds of posts, I worry that this game has already been all but discarded by the developers, and we're left with the bottom of the barrel team of like 6 people total.
---
I'm trying so hard to not get swept up in the wave of hate, but this game and the team behind it are very poor.
---
Believe it or not the worskhops are not a great source of materials, especially if you don't want to deal with the pvp.
---
No..none of the above. I was mostly walking around..crouched and in stealth to avoid trouble. And doing some Fast Travel with it. 
---
The BOS one?
---
One last chance? Signing out in a few, can send a screenshot, 17,700 with my perks and grape mentats et al
---
Given Bethesda's track record with piss poor console versions of their games I suppose they thought the exact same thing.
---
A give/take box would be great 
---
Does playing this way make me toxic? There isn‚Äôt really anything else to do at this point. I bought resident evil and have just shifted to that but what is wrong with trying to fight people in an online survival game?
---
Fusion core use is tied directly to AP usage.
---
workshops are pretty bad for junk anyway.  if you dont want pvp, theres plenty of  guides on where to get materials for whatever you are making.
---
Had one server crash in a pretty long session. If you really have an issue with it then make a post imploring Bethesda to do regular server restarts every 6-12 hours. That would eliminate the problem, servers need to be restarted regularly when handling this much information.
---
That or realize that if they did regular server restarts you might still land on a server that's within a few hours of needing a restart- and that's the point, you can't really blame them for something that is a standard issue with high volume high traffic servers.
---
The real fix may be coming with survival mode, it sounds like you choose the server you want to play on- if it were to crash you would have a very very long time before it might crash again.
---
Random servers means RNG- you might be joining servers that have been up for 12-24 hours and about to crash, or one that's just restarted. The only realistic expectation you should have is they do something about it, but restarts will be necessary planned or not.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks it‚Äôs a good idea. 
---
I've seen an albino mothman
---
&gt; Not so garbage if you have access to the plans to craft what you need.
---
But not everyone will have those plans, and even if they did, how are they going to get the screws and mats needed? There is inevitably going to be someone camping the major spawn points of those mats griefing unarmed players. You haven't thought this through very well.
---
It. Just. Works. 
---
some random guy going to walk pass, and think about it , don't kill gary or 500 exp.
---
76 days of the worst triple a release of the decade.
---
I did attempt this but most players just stare at you and try not to fight lol. There isn‚Äôt much challenge and is certainly not fun. Picked up resident evil 2 and am having fun with that. 
---
You'll get the quest markers when you come to the point in the brotherhood quest when you need a military ID. 
---
Also, found Monogah is also worth the nuke for flux gain and if you claim the power planet it will send mutated gouls. Done it 3 times now.
---
Its more than likely not cost effective to make a console port or they would have done it long ago.
---
though there was this one.... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:\_Brotherhood\_of\_Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_Brotherhood_of_Steel) if you wanna try and find it
---
As far as I can tell yes
---
This happens ALL THE TIME to me.
---
The only way out is if the mob dies or I swap guns.
---
Happens inside or outside of power armor.
---
Happens only when I am in VATS.
---

I have a lever action plan for sale if you are interested. I learned every single lever action mod for it so I can mod it out for you if you want as well.

Yup. My T-60 right leg just vanished while I was wearing it.

I think sneaking might chew it up a bit faster

"Hello and welcome to the wasteland, let me be your guide."
---
I have found lots of interesting plots that I have yet to explore. 
---
Also, I tend to "waste" a lot of time helping people.

I love making new bases in creative spots but since it costs so much to place turrets they are usually left defenseless from players and mobs :/. 
---
Got the platinum in Spider-Man and saving red dead. Picked up resident evil 2 and I‚Äôm having a good time there. I don‚Äôt mean to ruin someone else‚Äôs experience I just got bored and was hoping to find other people that WANTED to fight. Most people just look at you and don‚Äôt want to attempt a battle. No big deal.

If I open the pipboy right away it happens to me.

Did you ever check if poseidon is the same? you might beable to cover a power plant 2 workshops and a train station with that one.

Has anything significant changed in the past month and a half? I dropped the game at lvl38 waiting for updates. Crashed way too often to play for me

I‚Äôd like some raider theme stuff now

Me too, but i have found the social aspect of helping other to be a lot of fun.

Will test wooden stairs and concrete stairs again later. I hope this post helped you :D

"And just to be clear, that feature is actually not coming out at launch."
---
Thank you!!!
---
First time it's happened to me.
---
ohhh. then Sneaking might be the culprit here then. 
---
You know we don't all live in the US like you? 
---
Making it earlier might benefit you, not me for example.

Only reason we found that spot was good is we ended up coming up with enough cobalt to make 5 or more stable flux parts.

Can you add the brahmin pen and resource collectors?
---
oh nice. i will keep that in mind then. thank you.
---
If you drop it slight to the left(west) of the city it works the best.
---
I have so much ballistic fibre it‚Äôs ridiculous now.
---
Playing as a stealth sniper means I rarely have to repair and when I do I put on white knight 3 and fix it good 3 and it lasts for ages at a much cheaper price
---
Same same on XB1

In several years FO76 will go down as the most underappreciated classic in all of Fallout's and Bethesda's history.  This coming from someone who has played all the FO series.  Couldn't care less how many people skip the game, but at least I'll have the great memories I've had so far, 145 hours and counting.
---
I had 1000 caps disappear on me.  Not sure about armor, I think yes but not 100%
---
A bug by any other name would be just as expected.
---
First time I killed here I got a leather cheat piece on my heavy weapons bos character
---
I will never forgive bethesda for selling me this terrible game :(
---
Geeze you must have been playing a lot  if you've made it all the way to Appellation 
---
:)
---
You go to sleep very early. Update at 11PM JST is still too early for me. 
---
On what platform are you playing FO76? Still looking for people in Japan to play with me. :/
---
It would be nice if bethesda could make it work but it seems the damage is fairly random at times to be honest. You can shoot the same level npc in the head and get varying damage to each.
---
I love my upside down mansion! Don‚Äôt tell me how to live my life! Lol
---
What do you mean? I made my camp at the shack acrossed from the train station (if that is what you mean) and had him spawn on the north side of the red bridge when I headed north to flatwoods.
---
I agree 
---
maybe you will get lucky and more people will start nuking there now. free flux from someone else's work.
---
Watoga is one of those places where friendship was the real treasure all along.
---
If it were a Rockstar game they would already have V2.0 and 65% usefulness 
---
An hour a day isn‚Äôt too bad 
---
Yeah I'm not a super and I've got at least 6000 steel. I've given up on selling it as bulk and started throwing away large stacks of steel.
---
76 days of reading people be overly dramatic and exaggerate/lie about how bad the game is- 76 days where I play fallout with my friends, kick tons of ass, become a successful merchant, and best.. I've probably helped at least 76 players rather than be a negative douche for 76 days. Good job loser üòòüòã
---
Idk about how many of them but I'm still good friends with a duper but I feel it's to the point where so much shit has been dupped that it's all just distributed to everyone
---
Looks like your Camp is at White Springs. Isn't it going to die when whitesprings is Nuked?
---
This and some situations where stuff dropped on the ground has disappeared is why I always trade directly with friends.
---
Probably. It took me like a month before I saw on reddit I could share perks.
---
How the queen will scale with 10 people after the tse changes. And how it will work with low level players joining.  
---
Ideally it would be nice if say anyone under 40 that joins would not effect her hitpoints/damage resist. Or maybe not give server wide quests to those that have yet to start or finish Enclave or BoS?
---
Do you have the correct perk card equipped? I believe its Gunsmith. Check the requirements on the right hand side within the repair screen. Ensure you have this equipped.
---
 No having the plans for a mod that's attached should not prevent you from repairing it. If you have any trouble I'm on xbxo and can come help. 
---
&gt;  shotgun build (favourite build tbh)
---
Broken limbs...broken limbs everywhere
---
Can you get Karl Pilkington to do a playthrough ? People will watch it!! And then ask Karl to record a wasteland fables radio station with jangles the monkey news ? _ :) .
---
I hope your a Karl Pilkington fan as this will all make sense how brilliant Karl Pilkington and Fallout would be. 
---
I havent done it but if i remember rightly from lets plays the "winner" is the one with the most candy. if time passed and no one else joined it might have just marked you as the winner.
---
I was literally telling my friend today how cool it would be to have an app to manage the perk cards so we didn‚Äôt have to take the time to do it in-game! 
---
Code reset recently, it hasnt been solved yet only bravo has
---
check here for better updates
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Thank you, friend! I must say that turret weighting is a little excessive. I only say this due to how the currently operate.
---
On one of my characters, the farm is the first place to be attacked every single time. So I put 2 heavy turrets right smack in the middle of the farm (on the edges actually). Not once have they ever fired while a radrat or molerat rips my crops to shreds. They give the alert sound, but have never once fired. If they actually did their job, I wouldn't complain about their weight. Those turrets in the silos damn sure know when there's a threat. Honestly, I don't need/want that many, I just want them to do their job. And I don't want to hear "put a spotlight in there" bullcrap.
---
As an aside, why is it scorched or super mutants can attack our camps from a mile away, while our defenses only attack, if they ever do attack, from what seems like 100 yards away?
---
Serious question: I set the game down for a while because it all the bugs at launch. Is it better now? Can I play without crashing? Can I place my camp structures again?
---
Is... everything alright with you? Should I look out not to bump into your edges?
---
Soo your saying it‚Äôs not the worst release because to me it sounds like you walked into a house on Fire and had fun regardless doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the house is still on fire.
---
Dont forget adding in lone wander and a vampires weapon
---
Shit me and my friends get most of our good gear from dupers I mean he sells TSE handmades buy one get one free 
---
In the trash.
---
I have the plans if you want to buy them. 
---
I also have a suppressed scoped lever action too. 
---
Tell me exact location of that trash.
---
&gt;no fast travel
---
then bring back the vertibird beacons from FO4 so we can summon a vertibot to travel because with how big the map is, its honestly just a chore to travel
---
In MMO's the endgame is often defined by where the best and most plentiful loot is, Fo76 is near enough to an MMO Looter and the SQB and WhiteSprings give the best loot. 
---
So yeah, thats the endgame. 
---
Sad, but true.
---
Your telling me over a decade and what 5 games now and they haven't managed to find all the bugs that have been hopping from game to game. They know how those bugs triggered they just can't be bother to find and report them so they can be fixed.
---
if its sprinting hit when they are not sprinting, if its sent + assassins then use melee to knock them back and then they take full damage.
---
Then your likely only blocking the south side spawn,, theres two spawns.
---
Technical data turn ins 
---
Honestly
---
I‚Äôd doubt that most people seem to cherish 1 and 2 and like 3 but love new Vegas and are indifferent to 4 but in concept and execution 76 is very flawed and unless they change the game drastically it‚Äôs gonna be seen as the worst in the series with no comparison like sonic 06 to sonic fans.
---
I can def add Brahmin Pen but I'm not sure how I'd add resource collector, will try
---
idunno i did the same as you. I was just counting the days in my head last night 
---
oooooh. well I needed to move house anyway. looks like I have a new reason to.
---
I dont know why but this made me laugh too much
---
I got mine from One Violent Night event
---
Are you sure this isn't a Pearl Harbor Reenactment by the Women of the Barley Townswomen's Guild?
---
Im a snobby camper ,, your camp fails Appalachian saftey standards.. 
---
It was more a comment on it's quality.
---
Hitting for 20k? Care to explain?
---
Spotlights dont even work at my camp... they turn on, dont move and dont provide light XD. Idk what is up with turrets but the only one I can get to work accurately is the missile turrets
---
Don't catch any rare mole rat virus...
---
Yeah. Do sidequests and search around the area. If you beeline through the main quest you‚Äôll quickly go to higher level areas and completely skip the Toxic area to the north. You‚Äôre about that level range. 
---
you do realize the mode isn't coming until march and there will be multiple updates before that. They also confirmed PVE content with the same patch. The game has been out for two months and had multiple updates, legendary hunting rifles, and yes BUG FIXES lol. also glad you are done posts like this are annoying af.
---
I have hydraulic bracers in my excavator armor and 15 strength. I just bunch anything under level 20 to death.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôll gladly help 
---
Wait... Alpha isn't solved.. Could have sworn it was.
---
OK so I have to go to a different silo. Gimmie about 20/25 mins.
---
My fault I really could have sworn alpha had its code up. Whoops!! 
---
Because when you‚Äôre fighting her you‚Äôre ask fighting:
---
- scorch beasts
---
- scorched mega sloths
---
- scorched fog crawlers
---
- scorched mirelurk queens 
---
- scorched death claws
---
All of which are the hardest enemies to face In the game ( apart from the actual SBQ) and you‚Äôre fighting multiples of them at once.
---
It is the end game.  It‚Äôs the final battle.
---
The silo run is just the lead up to that.
---
If I could nuke somewhere else and wake up a giant cryptid then you‚Äôre idea would have some merit.
---
But we are literally fighting, and killing, the ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù of the world and nothing else in the game compares or even comes within a mile of the fight.
---
It is the only fight in the game that requires people to work together (though people can one shot her with exploits so whatever), so it is the only ‚Äúraid‚Äù.
---
&gt;one else joined it might have just marked you as the winner.
---
That makes sense! I was trying to figure out what the heck was going on. So it's not a bug, just an oversight.
---
This was really bugging me, thank you 
---
Well maybe it will actually be addressed by the patch tomorrow...
---
I completely and emphatically disagree.  With a few more performance, UI and stability fixes, I'd say it would be a strong contender for game of the year honestly.  It's that good.
---
Thanks. I guess I have a habit of rushing the story in most games. I'll backtrack through the sidequests I havent done.
---
Is there a way to tell if a weapon has been duped? These two players destroyed my camp, and when I got into party chat with them they told me they knew how to get some overpowered weapons. I told them no, and they dropped a 3* sniper rifle to "apologize" for mistaking me for a different player and leveling my camp. I still have it but can't remember the specs atm. 
---
Yeah I would level up first. Go wander around the Forest or Toxic valley....I‚Äôm in the 50s and still on the rose quest.  I play solo so I‚Äôve had a great time just exploring the world slowly.
---
I‚Äôd have to say with all so respect I‚Äôd have to assume you‚Äôve never played a video game in your life.
---
Where is that terminal where you activate the cargobot??
---
If the boss can't fly, wouldn't it be mauled to death with All Rise within 5 minutes?
---
So your argument is that it is not the scorched queen itself that is the end game, but the nuke zones? That makes some sense.
---
didn't read your post but bye!
---
Ok, this guy done his "be sarcastic" quest. Anyone there to answer my question seriously?
---
I think barrel mods affect what it does
---
That sounds like something a Duper would say
---
I think you're right, yes.  I started a second character and started following the primary quest line without diversion and discovered exactly the same problem at exactly the same point.  Blackwater was murder!  I think on my first char I did much more in the way of adventuring and side quests first.  There's plenty to do, you can always just come back to things that are too hard.  You can also team up with someone and get some help, there's lots of friendly willing people (at least on PS4 there is)
---
No in 76 it doesnt use different ammo it uses different syringers 
---
Sounds like you need to install the Sims if you want zero challenge. You can farm whatever you need with the exception of flux the first moment in game with little effort. Those who have plans will have an advantage that respects the players time in the game without allowing the influence of duped gear or materials. The so called camped spots are the last place to farm unless you are there to PVP.  Who would constantly farm the firehouse for lead when it‚Äôs faster to server a mutant camp and steal their tin can doorbells? A complete set of vanilla Armor and level appropriate weapon is plenty for all but the SBQ.
---
I heard Bethesda hired a newly fired company to do the networking for the game. You get what you pay for I guess.
---
Do you know how to activate the cargobot to come out for the code?
---
Yeah, I guess I sort of answered my own question in it. I was just really enjoying those quests and kept on forcing through them.
---
No need to rush. I finally made lvl 50, and haven't done any of the quests past the firemen
---
I've had very few issues on PS4. 
---
Agreed. Also #6 extremely poor balance which gets even worse tomorrow.
---
Thanks! Im doing it now... i hope. Haha
---
I had some bugs/crashes in the first 30 days after official release, had much less with every single update from that point. Not a single crash among me or my friends since the last update. None of us had any bug that prevented us from making progress story/quest wise. PS4, still playing the game daily, just looking forward to new content since a few friends are just burned out.
---
My guess is that you're a PC player, they're the ones who seem to have the most continuous issues.. they also cry and complain the loudest. As a successful trader I haven't met more than a handful of people that had any serious bug of any kind.
---
Definitely doesn't sound like anything has ever been on fire- hence me mentioning people exaggerating/lying about the game in my original comment. Also I can remember several other AAA games that had issues galore yet people didn't talk this much shit. Including previous Bethesda games that got remastered with bugs and all and **never got fixed**. So I guess my question is why complain about this one if you've played the others, and if you didn't.. why did you buy this? To whine and complain?
---
Haha i don't blame you!
---
There is other responder stuff its just rare
---
52%
---
Which terminal and where if you don't mind me asking?
---
PS4 sorry! But I really appreciate the offer!
---
Uranium fever, strangler heart, distant thunder, and hordes in the cranberry bog
---
And the mire 
---
Right, I know they're not all banned but I'm just wondering if there still is duping methods 
---
yeah you are a complete liar. You probably didn't even get banned and this is probably fake as fuck. You keep saying proof on imagr but I don't see a link? also my friend is lvl 252 and have about 550 hours of gameplay I really doubt you have 711. If you were banned it was likely for good reason. especially when you refuse to let any of us know what actually went down.
---
Oh my.. I must find it. Is it Fire Breather? or Responder.. :o
---
Happened to me last night when a dude who get two-shot me through excavator armor took the ammo workshop from me. I lost all my caps trying to retaliate, and I had a level 100+ friend trying to help me as well.
---
An hour later I return it to it with backup, he logs out once we start claiming it, and I look in the ammo bin to see that he never switched the ammo type, or collected the ammo for the past hour. I can only assume his sole motivation was getting caps.
---
Theres a responder white and yellow fireman outfit and helmet, but they are very rare
---
I'm glad to hear it wasnt just me! I thought I might be doing something wrong like using bad weapons and armor or something. I'll back up and take it slower. Thanks for the reply!
---
AWOL arrmmerments
---
It's a brutal but effective method, sorry it happened to you
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and if you didn‚Äôt just offer to help I would tell you why ps4 is better than Xbox 
---
&gt; Appellation (however you spell it)
---
You can spell it how you like, as long as you say it right üòú
---
I can make this happen every time I use the Pip-Boy too soon after logging in. I hope Bethesda addresses this soon.
---
I didn't have great weapons until after the nuke. I've been approached by people offering to sell duped items, I laugh at them. 
---
Imagine how much better the game would have been received if they released it today, instead 
---
He sells the Hunters longcoat and a variety of other clean outfits,, i'd say you'd be fine having your camp 20 ft west just back from the lake,, its only really the spots around and on top of the lake and just by the boat in the dried up river that seem to affect the spawn :) 
---
Did you grind there or was there plenty of stuff to do?
---
Laser grids?
---
MBisonYes.mp3
---
well that is assuming i am right. lol glad to at least give you a reason for it not to bother you anymore.
---
Wait, 'Murica is not the only place in the world?!  Fake news!
---
He's making a bunch of scorch-beast sonic rounds to spam with.
---
You are a dumb fuck Srgt\_PEANUT
---
You *may* need Energy 1 and 2, maybe even Master but that was for crafting (100%, had to unlock them last night as I'm modding a Gauss myself). I didn't think repairs required anything? 
---
Its a bug with all weapons and armor currently, look at yiur stash a couple times and try again.
---
Honestly it's a fun story and this is the kind of interaction I'd love.  But I don't know what this has to do with griefing.
---
ProducerBoy416 I‚Äôm level 45
---
Apparently it's the number of players present when the SBQ spawns.
---
Its called being a man.
---
In watoga if you jump off one of the roofs on to a bill bored you can glitch inside the unesesable buildings but there‚Äôs nothing in there, found this out on accident because I didn‚Äôt want to take the stars 
---
To be honest, there are some people who just cant get over the fact that Bethesda released a game that wasnt in top condition, and most improtantly, was not what they expected. 
---
When it comes to stability, this varies across the board - I have had very few disconnections - a standard amount for any online game - where as some state they have had many, this is just statistics and chance, nothing else. 
---
The game is an online game, no MMO, or online Shooter is ever perfect at launch, most of fallouts fan base are not familiar with this concept, because a large number of new features, game types can be added, or even the whole grind of the game could be changed. 
---
Honestly, everytime I see a post on r/fo76 its always got someone doing the same ol' " I hate bethesda for selling me this crap" and thats cool, your entitled to your opinion - just figured you woud wanna do more with your past few months than moan on reddit.
---
Just go on r/fo76FilthyCasuals, if there is ever criticism, it is constructive - other wise it is just fun - Bethesda Moderators/Admin - go their for the real Wastelanders!
---
You get the outfit and helmet as rare rewards for the events project beanstalk (helmet) and leader of the pack (outfit). 
---
                              -from one fire breather to another
---
well I wouldnt call shotgun + enforcer an exploit, but it sure can slow a horde down like one.  
---
I see your point though. a few scorched deathclaws are far more frightening than a horde of bulging glowing ones.
---
I don‚Äôt live in the US either...
---
Yeah you are taking it a little bit too literal. What can you expect from reddit beta cucks.
---
Thats why you get insured by G.E.C.K.O. 15 minutes could save you 15 caps or more on base insurance
---
Spent most of my time exploring the west side of the map, and doing events. Just now starting to move east.
---
No grinding!
---
So then they just need an option to turn it off is all.
---
It's for marine armor both mods are named the same
---
I have BoS chest and legs plans
---
There's a massively popular event in that same location and I think sometimes players following Rose's quest line run into the much harder enemies spawned for the event.  That makes it virtually unachievable.  Could be that's what happened too.
---
Getting there but no
---
Just some disconnects that about all
---
You're 100% right, I can confirm it myself.
---
No. I'm not even sure if they ever will.
---
Can't wait for day 276, the price of the "premium" jacket!
---
You are doing God's work
---
No, but thanks for describing it! That sounds hilarious!
---
Haha, i was plaing rust like 3years ago, before i got rid of PC. Most frustrating game ever made.
---
New players will not have the plans nor will players who ignored a significant part of the game. So what?
---
Not everyone deserves to roll into PVP equal. Some folks will have better camps as that was their game experience. The whole point of the ‚Äú survival‚Äù aspect of the game is to give your effort value. To make it hurt some if you loose. Making you work a bit will at least give some breathing room for folks starting raw. They will have a bit of time to get rolling before your back at 76 camping the noobs.
---
I doubt it's patched but I think it's just because this method required a lot of upfront cost and was a bit harder (not impossible) to do on console
---
Any chance u had it from another player?
---
They reset on mondays but all of them are solve now, so drop nukes at your hearts content.
---
One of the coolest random encounters, I've seen some people talk about it but never myself. Found a Mr handy with a bunch of mongrels calling them good boys. They were all hostile. 
---
Honestly, this comment helped me to understand mods more than anything.  It's confusing that it shows the components even though you can apply the mod right away.  Bought two calibrated excavator shocks then got nervous I was going to scrap them before I found ten violet flux, then I recalled reading this thread.  Your comment made me go and apply the shocks right away.  Thanks a lot
---
lol right when i heard him talk i exited it then he said it would blow up if i left lol. first time the game scared me i think
---
The dumpster around back of that shitty old strip club. Be careful theres ALOT is shit you don't wanna touch. AIDS doesn't help in the wasteland
---
Hahaha us console players should be united!! It's thos righteous PC gamers you have to look out for *shifty eyes*
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/screenshot/11394472
---
yup i've heard about that one. Can't wait to encounter it. no pun intended :p
---
Lol you're such an angry little guy. Whatever dude. Sorry you got so upset. I'm sure your time is *super valuable*. 
---
Why is it better then? Our performance and 4K gaming is great.
---
This is just stupid!  Let us place camps next to each other, no exclusion zone BS!
---
Why won't Bethesda let us have neighbors?  Hmph!
---
looks like they all just got solved, get nuking!
---
You can change the effects by moddong the barrel. 
---
Once tamed does he just follow you around? What can you do with him?
---
Be careful with taming, im stuck with 20% of my budget being used up by 2 non existent animals, first a lvl 21 deathclaw that attacked everyone on sight "it was killed", then tamed a sloth that makes extremely loud noises every 5 seconds, asked a friend to kill him and I moved my camp. Stuck with 20% usage from them.
---
Hooded Rags look nice, but you can't wear armor with it for some reason. Another level of difficulty if you choose. I really like that outfit. You could also go for high rad low health Adrenal Reaction to make it even more thrilling with a bloodied weapon and become an actual glass cannon.
---
You done your quest too. Who is next?
---
This is a tricky section. If your on xbox I'll happily help lay waste to those enemies! 
---
Good to know! Thanks for your input!
---
Better than the last guy but still pitiful, I know you can do better cupcake. Try again
---
I'd say lvl 15-25 are the most difficult of the game. Do some exploring. Do events, even after lvl 50 I still do Fertile Soil nearly every time it pops up. Cook every piece of meat you find, it's free xp.
---
Hey! Are you my friend that I can't hear? If so, you are awesome and I'm sorry I can't hear your mic. This was literally the only way I could think of to contact you. üôä
---
Because it's the end of the base game plot? 
---
I did run into that in one attempt. The uranium extractor one. That's when I finally decided to sneak. Luckily I've finished the quest now. 
---
Lol we both know you're an idiot that doesnt know how to properly debate or argue. Have a nice night sweetheart 
---
Still hitting the SBQ? 
---
Try tomahawks &amp; grognaks axes next. 
---
Yaaaaaay! Yesterday my game was removed from bethesda store and i can no longer play, i havnt been banned or used any exploits but can no longer play as according to them i dont own the game. At least i had 75 days to make use of it........
---
I much appreciate the offers for help! Sadly I'm on ps4.
---
I go to bed midnight usually, but I‚Äôd rather lose an hour of potential playtime than six!
---
PC, same username
---
The only reason I have the Pocketed is to do increase carry weight.(I hoard alot of junk). I will def try that build, sounds fun
---
I'm pretty sure they said it will be out around March
---
Found a guy in Watoga.... could have been a girl, but hey. Visiting a sick friend and it looks like neither one of them made it.
---
Thanks for the advice! 
---
I politely disagree 
---
I would play the heck out of this. Upvote
---
Jesus you must get beaten up a lot lol. You should see a phsychiatrist or something. There‚Äôs no shame in it and it‚Äôs a lot healthier and less than dangerous than venting at strangers.
---
Dang. I just scrapped a tomahawk. I will def try that tho.
---
Back when I could stomach destiny 1/2, your first outcome was a constant thing. Shotguns got it the worst. 
---
You're complaining about the balance of a nerf that hasn't come out yet. You have no idea if the SBQ will be overpowered or not.
---
There's no "boss fight" to a silo other than the SBQ fight which, as you pointed out above, is not necessarily a consequence of launching a nuke.  The SBQ fight also has the chance for you to earn plans which are, to my knowledge, unique to the queen or to a Scorchbeast spawned during the event window (or something).
---
OTOH, the silos don't have anything new or unique to that "endgame," either item-wise or enemy-wise. It isn't even the only place to find a billion high-level robots to fight. Finally, the silo is clearly meant for one team, whereas the SBQ fight has enough action for the server's entire level-appropriate population, making it a much grander event in general.
---
Even those are relatively infrequent, at least in my experience. 
---
Concept is great, execution was.... challenged.... 
---
Not a problem at all. Have you tried shortcutting by using the exit hatch? A different perspective might be just what you need? 
---
maybe so but that doesnt make it the end game. afterall people got made when bethesda killed your character in the end game of fallout 3.
---
Doubtful, they've talked about new features and content as early as early December- it seems we're getting the first batch in March. I imagine what we're getting is being tested in the meantime, while we continue to get bug fixes (which I don't see much need for on PS4).
---
You forget or just don't know how game development works- if they have plans for future content or features they'll have various queues, some might get cut, but there's always going to be new stuff in the works, and how fast it comes will come quicker the less bugs are left and the more they get into a groove.
---
My only hope is that they have the morale left to continue to polish and add to this world.. realize it's the negativity of you and others (even if you say you still play it) that takes a toll on developers.
---
It took no man's sky developers a long time to get the game where they said it was going to be, despite constant negative feedback and the lack of incoming revenue- but they still did it. Bethesda likely still has more developers by a fair margin and can aspire to greater things if they still have the drive.
---
In short, the game is only a few months old, withhold the negativity if you can, because this is the only game I've seen in years that's had people saying it's going to fail in droves.. before there was even a beta. They can do a lot in the coming months, if players leave them hyped for their own product.
---
And manage and organize on my lunch break! 
---
Too longüôÅ
---
Say whatever you want my imgur account name is same as this one
---
I've found an encounter where 2 Mr Handys are talking to each other mostly repeating the same conversation. Sometimes they even ask each other if they are stuck in a loop. It was quite funny:)
---
I couldn‚Äôt use throwing weapons to save my life so good luck if you do lol
---
Early game, the rifle is the easiest to pick up as a weapon of choice.  End game, I'm not crazy about them.
---
So your kids joined the fight to get the rewards and made her harder for everyone?
---
Okay, my tato's gonna die
---
I got a bloatfly barrel mod when scrapping.   No idea what it does.  One of many meme weapons. 
---
The Appalachian Express. From Deaths Doorstep to yours in One spawn cycle or it's Free.
---
LVL 53. I still think my Camo T-60 PA looks pretty badass.
---
Happy 76 day, fallout! See you on the next one!
---
I still have figured out a way to wire BOTH an inside *and* outside switch. You know, like any *actual* door would have.
---
I did that with my Gauss. Would love to craft 50 radium but right now I would be worried I would get banned as a duper.
---
Hell I sweat when grab 200 dirty waters and boil them.
---
I also refuse to make too much ammo in one go.
---
Anyway the guns look good mate. 
---
Fortunately I was able to sneak past them and finish the quest. My post was more about that I pretty much feel like I'm getting gunned down all the time. I think the consensus is that I've skipped a whole lot of content. My plan is to go back and do the sidequests I skipped in my excitement to finish the quests for rose. Thanks for the advice though! We all sometimes need a different perspective!
---
Donate them to the dead body by vault 76 first lol
---
You sir have my respect. Much appreciated.
---
I'm always up for a challenge. As I feel the quests are quite monotonous.
---
Buy the Brahmin Pen plan. Go to your CAMP. Open settlement menu. Select Resources: Fertilizer Generator. It looks like a wheelbarrow and requires four razor grain to build. Enjoy your brahmin.
---
Tag along with a group for queen kills and you‚Äôll be swimming in it
---
I had to free up 10% to get it to work.
---
I did!
---
I got in and there was a voice message telling the previous user to get back to their camp, and maybe stop wearing the power armor so often because even though it was fun jumping off of tall places it ruined their ability to sneak up on people
---
Very interesting message! 
---
Unless hes an explosive god build hes dead weight for the people who can hurt the damn thing.
---
What ?
---
Yea, ran into that one at fort deviance. Also a me handy asking if I have a scopes weapon but I never do. :( so idk what that mission was about
---
besides queen
---
Have been talking all this shit about achievements, got on and was able to get them, lol. Now only need one more , hit level 100 !
---
Their support is shit. I didn't keep my receipt and they told me I wouldn't get the bag or atoms.
---
Hey what's your PS I have mini nukes and missiles I'd like to exchange for other ammo 
---
I got a pyrrhic victory by destroying all the generators for the various machines I built and by following him around the building in non-pvp mode, which visibly agitated him.
---
He's now on a list for when I'm as geared as he is for me to mercilessly slaughter.
---
Go farm normal scorchbeasts instead 
---
It never appeared
---
I can craft it for free since you provide the resources.
---
I believe we  would have a very different market experience, we wouldn‚Äôt see players lvl 200+ that often, the dev room would still be a secret, camp would have seen as polished, pvp would be more fair. However when I think about stash bro... I would  still have complained about it all again.
---
Yeah. I'm trying to get in enough mainframe cores but the gsm fucked up. I can't loot 3 off the main panel. I may have to log and stat over. For the 3rd time. 
---
Ah, hrmm.  Well, I'll wait around for a few more patches.  I'm in no rush.
---
Something smells off....your just full of shit OP!!!
---
.

---
Exchange rates for 556?
---
Nice. I'd like to tame something but i live on a mountain and every time i tame something its at the bottom then dies eventually. 
---
They told we are getting a new pvp mode ! 
---
Borderlands should not be a game to get compared to considering current gen games.
---
Borderlands 1 and 2 were no doubt amazing games. But it just doesn't hold up after you've played it. Sure, there's some replayability but the overall feel of the game isn't current. And don't even get started on how that franchise is currently being handled. 
---
Duplicated Ultimate Prizes Examination
---
Got em. I'm. Starting last part now. 
---
Can you tame him?
---
Nah, maybe Diamond City.
---
I would buy a good skin for it.

This is one of the random encounters that triggers near Charleston station. Other encounters at that location also include the roaming responder bot vender, a random eye bot that only "talks" in Morse code, and the pied piper eye bot that leads a pack of radrats.
---
[For those that dont know about this trigger area, just fast travel to Charleston station. You should spawn in on the tracks with the station on your right and a opened barn/building on your left. The side of that building you are facing when you spawn in is the  event trigger location. Right in front of the water. But it wont activate when you approach it from this direction. Follow the tracks, straight ahead, til you get to the first bridge, just after passing the station. Cross the bridge, all the way to the other side, then just turn around and head back across. The building that was on your left when you spawned in, should now be on your right. Just head towards it and you will trigger the event spawn. Usually it's just ghouls or super mutants but it can spawn several really cool encounters.]
---
Just wanted to say that you were actually correct here and I was misinformed but thought I was correct at the time.
---
I have subsequently upvoted your posts here and downvoted my own.
---
I haven't experienced many random encounters sadly. Don't know if it's bad luck or I'm doing some wrong
---
I just won't to build a computer in a game on my computer is that to much to ask. 
---
that was a different message then the one i got. Nice find!

Server hopping ia leaving to the main menu and hitting play to go to another server

Glassed Cavern in Cranberry Bogs. Tons of ore, even more if you have excavator armor. You'll get about 80 ore without excavator. Server hop and repeat

That‚Äôs bullshit in my opinion

I dont feel that at all. I got my money back and going to buy ace combat 7
---
Red dead got that right
---
Bullshit as in you disagree with my statement or that that's how it works?
---
Awweesome, glad you got a little reprieve. 
---
Aw sweet, do you have a link to an update on that? Inside the vault and the homepage hasnt been updated since january the 12th as far as i can see
---
Or actually use the light boxes as a changing display 
---
 You mean the one happening at 9 est tomorrow?  
---
How about alerts when a new event starts? Touch to fast travel...
---
I'm so glad we can all experience this addiction together. Normally ide be at the point where i say " i *should* play something else", but now i am back on the streets scrapping together some caps for some more jet tomorrow.
---
In the words of a wise man.
---
"Gary"
---
Herbivore prevents that for me. Plus my strength averages around 34 sans chems.  
---
Probably still not as good. Only reason it got as good as it is is because of player feedback. If today was release and they had the B.E.T.A. 24/7 for the past months then definitely much better release
---
They patrol a radius around your "my camp" item...
---
My camps " my camp " item was inside the base so the Deathclaw didn't spawn properly, so i moved the "my camp" outside to a clearer area and he now patrols there,,, if you have alot of items around the "my camp" patrol area it can affect the pathing of your pet &amp; they get stuck &amp;  possibly despawn. 
---
For sure. Honestly it would be really popular.
---
&gt;I have no turrets and I struggle to have what could be considered a small house, one of each work bench, bed, stash etc and some purifiers.
---
That's very puzzling. I have a one story camp with workshop (every bench); separate kitchen with appliances, formal living room, office, separate bedroom, dining room, every musical instrument, potted plants, succulents, lamps, lanterns, candles, accessories, paintings, neon lettering, metal signs, little lettering to greet visitors, adhesive farm with additional gourds, melons and blackberries, stash, large industrial water purifier, covered front porch, string lights, cooking station, oil lamps, fencing and fire pit. I still have left over budget.
---
Maybe you have stuff hidden in your Stored tab? I have a friend who also had a weirdly limited budget compared to mine and once she started scrapping, some stuff that was trapped under Stored (but hadn't been visible in the menu) suddenly appeared and she was able to deal with it.
---
Where on earth was this mentioned, im looking at the homepage and reddits tagged posts and the homepage hasnt been updated since the 12th and the last tagged update here was the 10th
---
Arf, too bad. I'm on PS4.
---
I never wear power armour.
---
I have a set of ultracite armour someone left laying about (not from the BoS quest as I haven‚Äôt done that on this character yet) but I‚Äôve never used it.
---
I repaired it, modded it and it‚Äôs stayed in my stash since.
---
I just go around in my leather armour using my rifle.  Most things die in 1 body shot in stealth, or 1 head shot out of stealth.  Usually never more than a full clip unless it‚Äôs something like a glowing deathclaw or mirelurk queen...even then vats crit headshots can make short work of them.
---
In a nuke zone I use a hazmat suit.
---
If you‚Äôre melee or shotgun I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôd need some armour with more protection but still think PA would be overkill except for nuke zones
---
Don‚Äôt have any of that left
---
Mackdaddycash won‚Äôt be on until tomorrow if you can hold onto them
---
Yeah. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúneed‚Äù high rads but having high rads means you can‚Äôt get high heath which would mean lower damage.
---
Camp you put a Camp there?
---
If you're looking for patch notes it won't be released until maintenance starts. But here's the Inside the Vault released on the 24th https://bethesda.net/en/article/1PnLPLl6a8D6gPNWvSVA0Q/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-24-2019
---
I'm on PS4 and my bases tend to be massive things.. I can't see why people people are having issues. There's a recent post about what uses what % of budget, and I would say it's pretty accurate. 
---
I also don't go heavy on the decorations and lighting as those things seem to use the most budget.
---
I currently have a two story base(probably 18-22 tile wide footprint) with a trap room setup that has 6 flame thrower turrets, 8 Tesla arcs, 6 radiation traps, and a very complex wiring setup so when they walk on a pressure plate outside it opens a powered door and triggers all the traps, along with another pressure plate on the inside that triggers all the traps again (that's two separate circuits), with spike traps all over, 4+ water purifier, every single station, about 15+ plants planted around the pressure plate, and a hidden under water entrance, a bedroom.. oh, and probably 10 power pylons to keep people from being able to jump past the 6 flame throwers.
---
All of that, and it's using maybe 25-30% of my total budget. Oh, with a decon shower and that huge red rocket sign to attract victims. I could throw 2 missile turrets up and have plenty of budget left for lighting and a few decorations.
---
Dropping nuke now. 
---
300 is like 4 hours a day?
---
seems to be roughly 1.5 the distance it takes to be able to place your camp. so if the exclusion radius is 4x, it is probably about 6x
---
Ah but where does it mention tomorrows patch?
---
Im nit having a dig, im excited af to play but ive been checking this reddit and the homepage weekly and have seen absolutely nothing to indicate a patch happening at any specific date or time, seems like pitiful reporting :/
---
Can you store a workbench if it's in use?
---
Invite? Gt is M57o

Only time Bethesda Launcher comes in handy lol
---
Hell yeah it does! What game is this?
---
Ah thankyou! Damnit I wish theyd get their community support together, shouldnt be this hard to find üòÖ
---
I got my two-shot gatling from a trash ghoul legendary...
---
Hit me up on XB GT XPonz78. I have a mic and will use it!
---
How it works
---
New Patch.
---
Lol. I wouldn't be against this.
---
Maaan I got stuck on a workbench. Like. Nothing worked. I couldn't craft cause no crafting menu popped up. Couldn't open pip boy. Could not press start. Had to manually close the program via home screen.
---
Rocking PS4 username sheehan_machine 
---
There's a Bathesda employee that posts. I believe she mentioned it in a post.
---
It wasn't supposed to be down until Tues morning at 9 AM.  Seems unlikely it's that.
---
Congrats?
---
Am I bad at math or is it you
---
As I understand it, Grahm sells the plan. I haven't been able to find him latey so I can't confirm... the bastard.
---
It's been posted a lot on this subreddit like the past two days
---
Boo
---
Really should be a sticky but hey, community is more helpful in the end anyways, appreciate it mate! Heres to hoping PS4 build fixes the issues üòä
---
Poor phrasing on my part, I apologize. It's not that it doesnt allow you to fight back (which that is technically true) it's more so that it doesnt allow you to damage other players or their property, there by accidentally starting pvp
---
This would be a nice addition. Leave it off by default for immersion, but those who would like it could turn it on in the settings.
---
There was a patch about a week or two ago that really cleaned up the server disconnects and bugs, at least for me on Xbox.   Although I will admit there are still some bugs; it is a Bethesda game after all lol
---
What? Servers are up. Nothing is happening tonight. 
---
Or the opposite, ask if they want help with it before jumping in and spawning new enemies
---
There should be a sticky for this.
---
I found out by reading the blurb in the top right corner of the main menu.
---
Oh man, not a good time. I have some key cards if you do have to! 
---
Thanks?
---
Cool I'm finishing up trade and be right with you 
---
Were you in game?  I got a maintenance mode alert and servers going down in 5 minutes.  Someone must have hit the wrong button.
---
It definitely applies to the Gatling Gun. It also notably speeds up the fire rate of the Gatling Laser, making the Charging Barrels almost usable.
---
Mine still just sais something about nightmares and the atom shop üòÖ
---
I just lost all my quests..save 2 small ones...what up?
---
With all the ideas people are posting I think it would be awesome too, but man would latency be a problem and with how religious the dupers are, they'd probably find a way.
---
Oh very good observation!  They should have made a bigger deal of this! Like.  I dunno, patch some bugs ... wait.. they are!
---
Unfortunately this is how most businesses work, really cuts down on customer fraud. Always keep a receipt for anything of decent value
---
Gotta love‚Äôm they can even tell everyone at the same time.
---
I got the Combat one tonight so now I have both dense mods, and BOS Arms and Legs plans from grinding it has been a fruitful evening.  Need the BOS Torso plan yet
---
...how would that be any different?
---
Never heard that this thing drops from any event, but are you even selling it ?
---
I totally agree with you in theory. The only problem is that with sneak perks, I generally have very little problem staying hidden even in power armor in normal game mode. I feel like this will be a wait and see moment with SM. Will other players show up on your compass? If so, I feel that having PA on should make you automatically show up from a mile away; that stuff is noisy after all. And while I know the HUD states that perception helps you detect enemies, I have seen no literature that quantifies this and i haven't noticed a tremendous difference in my own experience. Just another thing to consider which is especially relevant in a PvP centered mode. 
---
Whatever you got is irrelevant. Servers are up. I am online. 7 of my friends are online.
---
Background on this?
---
Cool screenshots! Definitely look like loading screens.
---
I have a medics 33% vats accur accuracy pipe rifle.
---
The servers have been really unstable the past 30 mins or so. Lots of disconnects, server not responding, and infinite loading into worlds. 
---
Chilllllllll 76, stahp downvoting me for trying to find an official post about the update, there should be one on the homepage or stickied on reddit, not have to ask here and have someone source a link only visible to people with bethesda launcher, lordy.
---
Are you scrapping your junk before storing it?  Do you bulk your junk (and sell off what you have too much of)?  I‚Äôm always at or around my stash limit but little things help. 
---
Ammo weighs a ton as well. If you really want to shed weight, I‚Äôd pick a couple weapon types you plan to use and get rid of all the other ammo. 
---
You can also try to pick up calibrated shocks (they are pretty rare so buying on reddit is your best bet). That will give you an additional 50 pounds per leg. 
---
Omfg someone called me a duper because I just have like 927,536 TSEs in my inventory 
---
While looking in the direction of vault 76 turn left from the overseers camp and walk about 50m ingame, just past the truck is a random encounter spawn.
---
Did you reach out to customer service? That seems a bit weird. I‚Äôm sure they can track it down in their system 
---
So like I try to go to Charleston and then to mount Blair and a few other places to find the cores. They are never there.  Is there a time they respawn. And then usually there are dead things where the PA is. Like someone's been there
---
Go to r/market76
---
Or even just a simple matchmaking thing. My wife plays GTA V and there is a setting you can change that marks you as something kin to "Open for invites" and when someone starts a mission you get an invite. In Fallout 76 it should be like that hunter vs hunted radio thing but it will auto inv people to a group when both of you are tuned into the station and get near one another. Or if they still plan on adding a chat system there should be a LFG tab in it.
---
currently doing so, i dont expect a reply for the best part of 3 days though as ive heard they are pretty hopeless.
---
Well I‚Äôve got my fingers crossed for you! 
---
No, you couldn't. Likely your game itself crashed, but just like most on here don't seem to understand.. that's not the way servers work. Simple way to explain- there's 24 players on every server, if simply multiplying how much you have would crash a server, a server wouldn't be able to have that many players. Simply put, you didn't have much impact on the servers.
---
Tech speak aside, servers can handle far more than people here seem to think, and it also processes information much differently than most people think.. servers crashing is 99% of the time going to be because they don't regularly restart them, and a pile up of bugs it can't process over that time period.
---
Simple example: every time a server crashes, there's 24 people that are all going to make assumptions about why it crashed because of something they did, over time they make assumptions.. I even see friends do it, it's annoying and simply false.
---
Look at the crafting workstation and look at the repair for the weapons and armor you use. Take note of all of the materials. Those are the ones you need. What other materials you need depend on how you play. You might need to repair your base. You might craft ammo. You might build workshops. Etc. So you can take these things into account. Always stash your resources. Particularly those rare ones like Ballistic Fiber, Hardened Mass, Stable Flux, etc.
---
Bwaahahaha lately Ive found talking shit to technology tends to make it work. Not sure why, i think they get self conscious.
---
I still need the 2-3 "win event" ones, and the Magazine one.
---
I hope they dont add any for the new PvP mode.
---
Thank you!
---
Completely agree! Maybe it could be something the player can activate rather than automatically triggering? 
---
haha thanks!
---
They should have waited 76 more days.
---
rude
---
Uh, because a longer beta menas more time to fix stuff, and some people dont want to buy a game if its in early access and want to buy it after the beta is done to get a more complete game. Most people today discourage early access titles. If this was made as more of an early access title with a set date today, we would still get the feedback, and the official reviews of the game would instead be "bethesda is going somewhere with this game". Many people were upset to see issues after spending $60 on a 2 week old game only to get an asston of bugs and issues because they expected more considering there was a bta. Unfortunately the beta just wasnt enough.
---
I wouldn't know i don't hop for cores, i usually bum them or buy them, when im forced i go to set spawns for the chassis and take those cores and hop for them
---
Such randomness. Had game since day one also &amp; never run into him either. 
---
I keep meeting grahm and chally everywhere though.
---
Yesterday I played for 6 hours with no stability issues.
---
Couple days for that, I crashed 7 times in 8 hours.
---
Thank. This comment will help me.
---
76 days x 1 hour = ???
---
I feel I've been the luckiest guy on FO76. Every patch has brought forth satisfaction on my end. Error screens are rare. So I'm actually super pumped about tomorrow's patch. The only thing I run into that's a pain is, at times I cannot exit my power armor. I hope it fixes things for ya.
---
I think that‚Äôs a server reset that happens periodically. 
---
I thank you for trying to work this all out, but I'm not sure that the foundation and spotlight options are accurate.  I can for instance place a foundation item, but if I try to place a spotlight I get budget exceeded.
---
Ive seen this issue pop up a few times on here and other forums.
---
Doing a reddit search came up with this
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3ht92/bugged\_main\_quest\_key\_to\_the\_past\_pc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3ht92/bugged_main_quest_key_to_the_past_pc/)
---
the user managed to solve it and listed the steps
---
You'll no doubt encounter 3 scorchbeasts outside of it, run past em and go right for the cavern, there's quite a bit of scorched inside and I think 2 level 80 scorchbeasts, you should be able to run past em
---
You can stick flame jets on it too, lol
---
I‚Äôve been wondering if the responder eyebot has unique dialogue if you‚Äôre wearing a responders jumpsuit, since he says something like ‚Äúscanning for responder identification... uniform not detected‚Äù or whatever. I don‚Äôt remember exactly but whatever he said made me think it was too specific to NOT have a purpose 
---
Same one I got, I found it just south of Solomon's lake.
---
I get that message on occasion, shows a timer stating stuydown for server maintenance. Thing is, once the timer runs out and I get disconnected I have no issues connecting to a new server. Unsure why or what this is but it‚Äôs happened to me a few times now. 
---
Aluminum is the easiest to come by. 
---
I use automatic laser pistol with no legendary effects for crying out loud. I don't have any problems with the game whatsoever. Well except SBQ which you shouldnt be able to solo in the first place. 
---
I mean there‚Äôs no difference between a no star and a 1 Star right? 
---
It's under floors either foundation or regular floor just have to slide over like howd access the metal flooring
---
&gt;Because you have to trust the person trading is going to finish the trade. 
---
It's not a flaw to be a fool
---
&gt;People are assholes in this game. I'll never trade with someone until I can do an item for item trade. 
---
Because you're older than 10, unlike op, yes
---
&gt;How is that not a flaw to you? Or are you one of those Griefers that claim you're a Raider, and would call that Raiding?
---
I mean I wouldn't have called it that if you didn't mention it, but yes, stealing from someone because they're ignorant and too trusting of the world definitely sounds like a raider to me
---
Op learned this lesson in a video game, with virtual currency currency, tiny miniscule amounts of it 
---
This is a good thing, instead of learning it the hard way, with real currency
---
Well... if there‚Äôs level 65 mobs everywhere, there should be highlvl players along shortly to clear them out. 
---
Holy shit really??? Oooo
---
I haven't even explored the southeast where the bomb goes off. I guess I need to do that. I didn't know I could craft them that easy. Ty

How could you remember this. You‚Äôre a legend.

It would be cool to be able to view vaultboy and vaultgirl danmade love making images while we play.

After laying concrete floor, select replace and it will allow you to customize.

Only met grahm about 3 times, each time is still awesome, even though I "accidentally" shoot at him at first.

I know I had an anti armor assault rifle that should have been stored on an alt. Can‚Äôt find it anywhere now.

Mining helmet is more useful anyway with the cone shape lightning. Never bother with pip boy light ever since i got one.

---
Thank you. Haven't experienced any griefing than only once and it wasn't my camp that get destroyded. I found somebodys camp once near the vault 76 and was cheking it out because it was pretty well builded, i was at lvl 50 or something back then and suddenly lvl 130 player appeared and started tearing the place apart with TSE. 
---
I tried to shout him to stop and he just laughed and said that i had to build a new one. When there was only floorpieces and some crops left the guy logged out. A second after that lvl 11 player arrived and saw what was happened. I could feel the sadness of that poor guy so i dropped him some materials to help him out so he can built a new camp.
---
Whatever, it still happened, and it really shouldn't be.  Taking down one server is one thing, but it popped up, I went to main, went to another server and still got the message.  It's gone now, but that's something they shouldn't be putting up.
---
On Urban Dictionary, for the top entry on griefing, definition #2 has the following language: "or otherwise performing actions in a game to prevent the player from enjoying the game."
---
I also politely disagree. 
---
I‚Äôve only blasted off to Appellation once.  It required extreme meditation and 12 hits of premium Jet.
---
I'm more upset that it still feels like a beta and is $40 cheaper now. The whole "day 1 access" argument doesn't even work because I was sold on a finished product, and I still don't have access to one.
---
Enforcer is my friend, but Enforcer is *OP as fuck*. It's a great fallback if you get cornered by tough enemies but it *completely* nerfs them. Deathclaws? No problem! Wendigos? Total pansies!
---
I've not noticed anything specifically related to Intelligence, but I've never had to pump more than a few shells into anything to cripple it.

Cool floor

To be honest, if you‚Äôve purchased weapons online with real money your just as guilty of supporting what they are doing whether you‚Äôre actually dipping or not. It‚Äôs getting bad again and very frustrating when trying to level.
---
Same reason there's post-apocalyptic pipe guns made of wood and plumbing pipe in CEO's office safes while top of the line plasma and laser weaponry are commercially available.  Don't look too closely, Bethesda will come up with some retcon ideas to try and cover for the errors and it's best to just accept them.
---
Yeah check a chem bench under energy ammo and see if you can craft them. I don‚Äôt remember picking up a recipe/plan for fusion cores so I think everyone can craft them. But I might have found the recipe/plan early and not noticed. 
---
If you have power armor/haz mat suit, you can visit a nuke zone and stay relatively safe. Just don‚Äôt go near enemies and collect flowers instead.

how much ?

I have actually tried wearing some of the responder outfits and approaching it. It doesnt react though, in my experience. I tried the responder paramedic and the police one.

no like how many caps

You have spent ~16% of the last 76 days playing FO76. If you get 7 hours of sleep a night, you have spent ~23% of your waking time playing FO76. If you work 8 hours a day, you have spent ~35% of your waking time after work playing FO76. Finally if you eat 3 meals a day averaging 30 minutes a meal, go to the bathroom 3 times a day and shower once, you have spent ~43% of your waking and working life playing FO76.

1 hour could feel closer to 4 hours if you take enough Jet!  That‚Äôs quite the tolerance if done daily üòÇ

So if I do silo alpha will I be able to use that code?

I can‚Äôt craft with all these FUCKING DONUTS everywhere!!!

U can buy combat armor from the vendor in whitesprings and scorch queen tends to drop good legendary combat armor

I got kicked off last night Sunday, 11:20pm for no reason. Before that(okay, an hour before that) it was fluttering between "controls not responding" and fine. 1 second on, 1 second off. Then 20 seconds off, 2 seconds on. Irritating as hell(XB1)
---
All percents given are approximately accurate. Could be slightly off but without the game explicitly telling us what each item costs I can't give a 100% accurate answer. There are more costly and slightly more accurate ways of testing to get closer to the exact amount but I dont have the resources to do that :/
---
Back up your points.  How do we know for sure this subreddit is filled with shills?  I've been a casual reader here for a while and don't notice the "shill" level here any higher than most other subreddits (that is to say nothing I can remember jumped out of me and made me think "oh a shill").  What makes you so special that you have this "intuition" to sniff out shills?
---
Sounds like a sign for a new character build:

It‚Äôs a variant of the wood foundation.

There are plenty of other ways to farm or even buy the materials you need. Workshops are PVP grounds with the bonus of junk to obtain. It's a little extreme, don't you think, to throw away you "love" of the game over something the game fully intends to happen? If you can't defend the workshop. You don't get to keep it. Plain and simple. People are always a threat in this game, and thats part of why it's great! However, I understand your plight. It sucks having your shit pushed in by some random assholes. But use it as motivation to be better equiped and prepared next time. The smartest enemies in the game, and most clever, are other players. AI can be predictable and repetitive. There is no challenge there. Embrace your competitive side, and learn to enjoy PVP! 
---
There can be honour, it doesn't always have to be shit talking and getting upset. Sometimes PVP is a genuine test of skill and resourcefulness.

load it up to imgur and post is there and post the link here.

you play on ps4 how are you bluescreening?
---
I have it for ps2. It was the first fallout I ever played. I was a ghoul with fist weapons punching the shit out of everything.
---
It makes me hope the mod group whose making a fallout 4 mod that's going to be fallout 2 with its engine etc
---
Are you using WiFi?

REALLY HOPE IT GET BETTER. Come on be a true 3A Game!

Ok thansk

Stand near the gate with the security robots that is close to the sword, keep an eye on your map &amp; watch when a few players do a sweep through those buildings then run in after them, get password, open case, get sword &amp; run back to security bots.
---
Yeah explain that to the guy that killed me twice left with out taking the workshop then when I went back to collect my junk. Came out and killed me and my kid again.

West Virginians pronounce it Appalatcha and everyone else says Appalashia.

Kinda wild that much time has passed, feels like I just downloaded the beta the other day
---
Tbf I‚Äôm pretty sure TSE is still going to be the best late game option. 
---
Not sure how far you've gotten in the game, but with an attempt to avoid spoilers there is a lot that opens up when you join the Enclave and evidence in/at the Whitesprings resort points to the possibility of even more content for that faction in the future. 
---
The BoS questline/faction has a lot of useful quest rewards and it opens up some repeatables after its finished.
---
The Free States has a lot of possible routes for additional content in the future but other than the quest rewards not much comes from it. 
---
Joining the responders has little more to it than the direct quest rewards. 
---
The only raider stuff I think you do is for the Top of the World quests.
---
If you claimed the workshop,  it's pulling scrap from there,  not your inventory.  Workshops have free materials in containers or scrappable items, yellow is telling you it's going to use that scrap first
---
Confirmed nicest raider ever.
---
From my experience you get better rewards usually for turning in more than one at a time.
---
Oh, sure, I'm not saying there aren't weird server stability issues from time to time.  But that's hugely different from getting the server maintenance alert before they take the game down for patching.
---
Explosive definitely will be, but not necessarily two shot. 
---
&gt; Had one server crash in a pretty long session. If you really have an issue with it then make a post imploring Bethesda to do regular server restarts every 6-12 hours. That would eliminate the problem, servers need to be restarted regularly when handling this much information.
---
So if I don't want the game I paid $60 to crash every couple hours I need to beg the company to restart the servers several times a day?  The problem isn't that the servers crash, it's that they're not restarted often enough?  Good plan.
---
&gt; That or realize that if they did regular server restarts you might still land on a server that's within a few hours of needing a restart- and that's the point, you can't really blame them for something that is a standard issue with high volume high traffic servers.
---
Or realize that none of this is my problem, **that's what the $60 was for.**  You clearly have no idea what you're saying.  These are not high traffic servers and the idea that they need to restart a few times a day is insane.
---
&gt; The real fix may be coming with survival mode, it sounds like you choose the server you want to play on- if it were to crash you would have a very very long time before it might crash again.
---
The real fix is a game mode I don't have much interest in and a server browser you *imagine* is coming?  Somehow these servers are magically ultra stable and don't need to be restarted every 6-12 hours?
---
&gt; Random servers means RNG- you might be joining servers that have been up for 12-24 hours and about to crash, or one that's just restarted. The only realistic expectation you should have is they do something about it, but restarts will be necessary planned or not.
---
The realistic expectation I should have is to pay for a game and be able to play it for more than an hour at a time.  I understand scheduled maintenance, I understand temporary instability after a patch or a big update but that's not at all what's happening here.
---
Maybe you are, maybe you're not. I couldn't say as I haven't done the research. I score extremely high on matrices tests. I'm very good at pattern recognition. I'm not like most people who are oblivious to many things. If I could be bothered to I could go through every post and every poster and find patterns. I notice them a lot of the time but I don't pay much mind to it. 
---
Theyrrrre backkkk.
---
It's literally bluescreen on PS4 too u know.

I feel you. Yesterday we killed the SBQ and what i get.. motherfucking bloodied boxing gloveüòÇ

Graham seems to spawn in multiple locations, and is robust vs. other mobs.
---
Respvendor only seems to spawn at C station, and only rarely among other possibilities.  And he dies easily, and quickly, sometimes spontaneously.
---
I interpret that this is not WAD.
---
you just have to scroll to the right when on upper floor, foundation, or concrete foundation. PC anyway. 
---
Well in that case, wouldn‚Äôt you want Furious rather than Two Shot?
---
One thing I hated about destiny is everyone had legendary weapons. I like the drop rates cause not everyone is running around with top weapons. It‚Äôs already bad enough the duping ruined the game for some but why can‚Äôt we just slightly modify the drop rate rather than a guaranteed top drop every single time.
---
Where is this on the map?
---
I‚Äôm level 210 and finished all of that but you essentially start out as the first group and join all these other groups not really feeling like a part of one or another. Maybe it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs no NPC‚Äôs I dunno. Felt like they could have done more with the factions that‚Äôs all.
---
Hey! I‚Äôve joined the hunt for these outfits. So far I‚Äôve found only the brown and blue. Both were in the bathroom/locker room on the top floor to the right of the elevator. It‚Äôs the door on the left at the end of the  right little hallway. I found mine on the bench in that room. Good luck guys!
---
I get like 4 hours of sleep a night 
---
But I'd be willing to bet that 99% of their IT staff does. They wouldn't want to pay for the "overtime" to modify the schedules of that many employees for the "off normal schedule" time.
---
Did you have any friends in your server? I ask because the only way to know it's a server crash rather than a client crash is to see if they got kicked also.
---
I honestly wish they let us choose what server to join, showed us the uptime, etc.. That with daily or more often restarts of each server should really fix that issue pretty much altogether.
---
I think today was my first server crash since the update, but then again we may have just gotten lucky since there's no way to know how old a server is.
---
I don't know why they aren't going the way of other multiplayer games with private servers- if you wanted to make public server 180 your home daily, and it crashes.. your back on in ten minutes and on for as many hours as you want to play. They've definitely made some odd choices at best.
---
My inventory. ;)
---
I hate when games add additional content and achievements AFTER I already 100% it or get close and move on :( but I have 3 days to get my achievement and I‚Äôll be at 2 games 100% for the month of January

And I say Apple and Vinegar 
---
 You can arrived stealthed and make it most of the way to the door, once you know where it is, fairly easily. If you go through the door stealthed, always a good ides you can avoid being rushed at the start.
---
how do you check time?
---
I'm on PS4. Ever since I hooked up to the router directly via Lan cable, I've had hardly ANY bluescreens.
---
Wait those floors are amazing. Where did you get them?
---
God, if only.
---
Tech data turn ins...a lot of them by current luck, I've only had two out of hundreds of turn ins. 
---
I'm hardwired. Still blue screen at least once every couple of hours or game freezes 
---
Anti armor would probably be more effective , I think furious only gets up to 30% bonus ATM but I'm not sure just read that somewhere. Probably going to get a lot more useful information after tse is nerfed tomorrow
---
Lvl 85 sniper, only use PA (Excavator with Motion-Assist Servos and 2x Calibrated Shocks) to fast travel (Always in a state of over-encumbered).
---
So what are they worth cap wise to sell since I have 1?
---
I get you. &lt;Spoiler&gt; By the end of the Free States quest where you set up the early warning system I had forgotten that I was listening to holotapes and was bummed when I remembered that she was already dead. &lt;/Spoiler&gt; Wish we could build up the factions we like, even if we have to pick just one. Would make creating new characters more rewarding. I too would like to feel more "involved" with factions. Like the guilds in Skyrim.
---
i got a 4x4 foundation house, 18 Brick walls,8 garage doors, 16 roof pieces 2 mg turrets, 1 missile turret. 4 each of mutfruit, corn, and tatos. every work bench, a fusion generator, a small generator, decon shower, bed , 4 concrete stairs, 3 extra foundations, 5 small purifiers, Concrete resource collector, 3 stash boxes, one  perimeter wall, 5 light sources, a bunch of wiring, 2 switches, a bunch of conduits and connectors, a terminal and Space to Spare. 
---
I don't know man, maybe your idea of small house is different than mine
---
That's what q &amp; a testing is for...
---
Well, to eliminate griefing problem it should be expensive to build but cheap to repair. Or cheap to repair after destruction by players.

Odd I got mine.

Hey.  HEY!  Stop wasting time on reddit and get back to using your superior, self-attributed, pattern recognition to taking a bite out of crime.  Solve some cases!  Society won't fix itself.

Also, ironically you're right, I am a shill.  Just not for Bethesda; I shill for Nestle.

Tired of arguing with shills on reddit?  Why not give yourself a Kit-Kat?  Give yourself a break! (TM)

Just skip the workshops until pve servers are available.  Farming while exploring is fun.  Even if you have been to those locations before, they can still be interesting, and you may not have spotted everything the first time.
---
And bio ID information should only be input in one of the silos or Enclave bunker.

Motherfucker duped all the materials and now he's just sitting there spam crafting it all, no wonder they can throw out endless amounts of it

Don't feel silly, I was about to type the same thing but then I checked the picture

For the love of God though can things that require rare mats to build not require rare mats to repair? I hardly ever want to leave my decon shower out because some jackass can come destroy it and then I have to go find Flux just to fix it. 
---
I mean, it can make you invincible in PvE too
---
Out of own poop

I just hate when its competitve based as i generally play in a SP fashion whether im online or not. I shouldnt be required to be better than someone else to achieve something.
---
Urban Dictionary is not an authoritative source, nor was it meant to be.  And, by that logic I could argue that you simply playing the game prevents me from enjoying it and thus are a griefer; the action of you simply logging in upsets me, thus you are a griefer.  Obviously it's not that simple and requires consistent and/or repeated harassment with the intent to derive pleasure from it or deliberately prevent me from enjoying the game.
---
Your doing something I don't like, such as killing me in PvP and taking my stuff, doesn't make you a griefer.  Your doing it deliberately and/or repeatedly to upset me, to get me to log, to derive some personal benefit unrelated to the game or its mechanics, is what would make you a griefer.  
---
I'm not trying to be a jerk or argumentative, but you were just roleplaying and PvPing.  Keep having fun out there though, and maybe we'll encounter each other in the wastes and have an honest go!

Thank you! I was just talking to my buddy about this. Any chance you could add pets to this list? 
---
Much better but essentially still an early access title. Many bugs and QoL fixes are still needed.
---
Yeah except on PVE servers all the workshops will be permanently taken when you log in because you have no way to steal them from the 24 players holding the good ones.
---
Good. It's one of the few endgame activities we have. The budget barely let's you build anything meaningful. At best you can pick 2/3: stylish, defensible, or productive (farm, resources, etc.). Not to mention turrets are often ineffective against many enemies.

No, just the one like in the Atom Shop

Do you happen to have bravo and charlie?

Maybe; on the other hand, not every player will want to spend time on defense?

Anyway pve is just a dream for now....
---
Yep. Bluescreen, freezes, and server disconnects. At least bluescreen allows me to send a message to whoever might read it saying what I think of their competency. Bluescreen a lot in Stratton. Server disconnects disrupt the current mission progress, and eliminate any daily mission.

For the next Elder Scrolls, I'm hoping for no more, and yet no less, than 5 quests.  5 is where it's at man

And by any chance do you know how to farm these and where to turn these in at?

I use photo mode to surprise newbies. Sneak as they work their way through Fertile Soil, then clown suit, sacrificial mask, and sparklers on the Agricultural Center front awning as soon as they complete it.

Hold out for a sale. They happen often. I regret spending $60 on this game.

I imagine you could trade from an all rise from a player that has completed the quest and doesn‚Äôt not use melee weapons 
---
Anti-armor Grognak's Axe with faster swing speed
---
Thank you!!
---
The whole legendary mod system needs work. It worked perfectly fine for Fallout 4 where being hilariously, game breakingly OP was a big part of the fun, but I wouldn't hate it if they took it down a notch with a lot of these mods.
---
I live in the US, and it still wouldn't benefit me. Half the time I play is late night/early morning.
---
Penpineappleapplepen? 
---
This. 
---
Minus the regret, I've been vastly enjoying it. 
---
It already has dropped to around $30-35 for Black Friday and Xmas, if it goes on sale again I'd assume same or cheaper. 
---
Holy shit 3 employees responded, dude, we might get it.
---
Well done! Music hall for the big room upstairs, you get AP bonus for playing music for 30 seconds.
---
I could understand that reducing server disconnects, but bluescreens?
---
You have a targeting HUD equipped (or any teammates with it equipped)?
---
Whitespring bunker military wing at the desks just grab one only they are turned in after you have done the BoS quest line at camp venture in the southern mire.  Set your camp at either whitespring or venture and it will cost 17 caps to fast travel you will make caps off the quest to offset the cost and gain a little. 
---
I'm level 78 and only use PA when in a nuke zone. Am a melee build (because I am a terrible player, really, and am a lousy shot), have White Knight fully maxed out and almost never have to repair my armor, so I always have ballistic fiber. Just run by Camp McClintock once in a while and with fully maxed out White Knight you'll be all set.
---
But but some random dude claimed hes going to play the game anymore (even though they totally will keep playing, they just want attention) and for some reason you should really care!!11!! /s
---
I'm taking a break until some new content is released. Love the game, I just want something new 
---
I politely mostly agree but not absolutely
---
I can sell you some antibiotics for that deep burning if you need.
---
Reporting bugs is just step one.
---
Next bugs have to be reliably reproduced, next the source identified, then finally a fix must be implemented that doesn‚Äôt break something else.
---
My guess is these bugs are a core engine problem; fixing them would take lots of time and money so they could either do that for small problems that don‚Äôt improve the game in a huge noticeable way for most players or spend it on more tangible stuff.
---
While I understand that logic, I strongly believe they have taken it too far.
---
Lol yeah I just drop the stuff and gesture to the bag.  I'm fortunate enough to have an excellent mic setup but for whatever reason I just refuse to use it for this game.  With the lack of push-to-talk early on I just sorta got stuck on emotes.    
---
The reason I started doing any of this is because I took a cue from another player a while back doing it and realized, hey, it's practically zero effort and even rather fun to help out lowbies early on.  If/once Bethesda starts introducing more complex trading/selling mechanics I suspect willingness generally to part with stuff for free is going down, especially if we ever get an auction house.
---
Ahh Kk.
---
This is a pretty newbie error, especially if you did the research to know what Sentinel does to grind for it. If you'd been checking multiple effects on weapons, why not armor? Not being an asshole, just genuinely curious as to what the logic, or lack of was.
---
That's one idea. I was more thinking about that people can habitat a destroyed city again. By buying appartements and a few shopping areas. 
---
There are ways to counter it, but I'll never tell ;)
---
Try setting audio to Area. I have found it works better, but there still isn't a lot of people talking. I have found that if I talk first I will get a response about 50% of the time. 
---
Is that some kind of a threat?
---
Cavaliers is about as bad. Imagine an invincible SPRINTING man with a MELEE weapon. Makes me cringe.
---
I didn‚Äôt think about that, great idea
---
And let it track your steps so you can hatch Radscorpions.
---
See I would agree that they were unfixable if they hadn't finally gotten around to fixing them this game. This is plainly incompetence, laziness, and greed that has cause these issues. Just look at the current state. Fallout 76 is the first game Bethesda has ever truly spent time fixing and patching out bugs. The only reason they are doing so is because modders can't and the community voiced their anger. 
---
Tonight we ran around as "The Saviours". My character dressed as Negan and my lower level friends were my henchmen. We'd walk up on a claimed workshop, Negan would give the owner a thumbs down and offer to team up. When the offer wasn't accepted, we'd take the workshop.
---
Also just so everyone knows, Sentinel armor is good, but the really good stuff, is Sentinel pieces PAIRED with a secondary Assassin effect. These are the god roll armors people are wanting. Each piece is equally rare to a TSE weapon, or any other specific duo of affixes, so get farming!
---
Yes...
---
Hmm. True.
---
I'd just go ahead and be prepared to die the first time you run there unless you have 2 or 3 Sneak.  The entrance is down in the pit under and overhang.  If you jump in the pit at the wrong spot it can be hell to figure out where to go with all those scorched and SB's shooting at you.
---
I‚Äôve server hopped at least 39x at Charleston station and never once (did everything exactly as instructed by others. Server hopped 10x a couple days ago at the o e cream shop and got him 4x of the 10. Try there.

You might as well move on because private servers will not happen until 6 months later.

Fixing trading and item transfer
---
Mechanics is one of the main feedback points in my response to the official inside the vault call
---
For feedback. F1 style barter ui via a portable container placed down similar to how power armor is
---
Legendary items not included. 
---
I've always used one in the past and necer had an issue so idk what you're getting at.
---
I cant seem to build it I have all the parts I have science 1 and the other required stuff just cant build it
---
I climbed the giant dish, there's literally nothing there.
---
Try another helm and re-log and see if you still have the issue. I‚Äôll try to find the post about this. 
---
Just watched a couple videos touting sentinel armor=invincibility aaaand started looking for it.   Laziness on my part,  really.   
---
Okay thanks.
---
You both are partially right if anything, beta continued after release.
---
I like dropping little care packages of excess stuff I don't need whenever I come across an Overseer's cache/stash/whatever it's called, particularly in the low level areas. 
---
They get some free loot and I get to lighten my load. Win-win.
---
Yes, very good points and no, I don't do that kind of griefing.
---
I just said melee is the only way to kill it fast after patch now... how about you learn to read?
---
It's a No-Man's-Land, l-i-t-e-r-a-l-l-y.

If you don‚Äôt say it Appalatcha I‚Äôm going to throw an apple at ya

Offer valid through one update cycle or 2 In game weeks. Which ever comes first.
---
Me too but wonder if the past update made things worse. Here‚Äôs the post concerning it. See comments as well. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/?st=JRHAXH6X&amp;sh=5c0b35d0
---
Agreed. They eat up too much budget. 
---
If this was implemented because of server limits (like why we have stash limits), they could look into removing the sound and the movement of idle turrets so that there's less things for the server to load and etc
---
if you're on Xbone you can have my all rise, level 50, too slow for my tastes 
---
Ok, damn, that's pretty good. I'm going to guess you were using a baseball bat and you were wearing the greaser leather jacket and maybe a bandana.

Damn all 3 already!!

Is the Charlie one still more difficult?

when is 9am est 25th? because i live in australia and after using a confusing converter it says its now 9:30 in est on the 25th but my games still running

Pets? If you use the Brahmin pen the brahim does not cont towards the % otherwise I will need to get the perks to tame animals and see if they have an effect on the budget
---
That's a great idea actually.  Why hasn't that occurred to me.  I've got very little carry weight and just drop trash legendaries when I could be dropping them in caches.  Thanks!
---
Wow, that reads as sarcasm.  It's not.
---
You can also get it from a Whitesprings nuke zone (or any nuke zone for that matter).  If you can kill mobs that are radiated, great.  If not, that's still ok.  Pick up an item from their corpses called Hardened Mass.  It's used to make flux but if you scrap it instead it scraps to ultracite.  You can loot the corpses of things others have killed also and it might still be there if the other person didn't pick it up.  When I was lower level I would go in to WS just to scavenge stuff that others left behind and then make flux.  
---
what does unyielding do
---
It would be awesome if Targeting HUD would stop crashing the game client for a start.
---
Thank you so much!
---
You should snatch up its paper bag before it dupes even more to give out to the rest of the scorchbeasts, it's bad enough out there as it is
---
Okay, any particular way about doing this? Or just serve hop at the ice cream shop (the one on the west side of the new George bridge) and he spawns there or? (I've tried about a dozen different ways "to get him to spawn" just don't want to mess it up.

Haha. I heard Tim Allen when I read this. 
---
Awesome, thanks! My bethesda handle is OrangeJedi, add me and hopefully I can catch you sometime... I get on pretty late if I get on at all.
---
did y‚Äôall get wood armor?
---
They definitely take up some space. But I haven‚Äôt been able to really figure out how much
---
There should be a thread in this subreddit of favorite photo mode pics.  Would be great to use as load screens.
---
That's about what time I get on anyway. My bethesda handle is OrangeJedi, add me and hopefully I can catch you sometime if I haven't gotten it by then.
---
A lot of us don't want to open ourselves to PVP. Owning a workshop leaves you vulnerable all over the map.
---
If you fast travel near one that you killed it will travel with you even works for the Queen 
---
i think you get see a persons health bar by pointing the crosshair to the person 
---
Holy shit almighty I'd completely respec if I could dress as the grim reaper and wield a scythe.  Seriously excellent suggestion and the kind of thing that's actually doable.
---
What system are you on by the way?
---
I think that would be good for a sniper to use as a second weapon while in hazmat during nuke. Their damage resistance would be low, so dps would be very high. And the weightless makes it easy to carry around all the time.
---
Anything less than 7 hours of sleep a night starts accumulating long term negative health effects. Sleep is very important brother. 
---
&gt; Not everyone deserves to roll into PVP equal.
---
That's the whole fucking point of having people make new toons. Derp some more lol. This thread was just suggested as a way to eliminate low level area congestion, not to give people an advantage.
---
Haha, funny enough I actually just watched an old Home Improvement episode in TV earlier tonight!
---
Xbone. Thank you for the help.
---
hah! that's a good one, i was planning to record the wendigo sounds to scare my friends lol.
---
It's because everyone comes on Reddit and shares the *secrets* of grinding.  Everytime someone mentions a *good spot* on here, it's no longer a good spot.
---
I have all of my doors locked level 3, and high walls you cant marsupial jump over all the way around my base. Come in if you wish, but remember your trapped inside with me, my turrets, and my team.
---
Some guy posted he's selling them on XB1 for 200 if you supply the mats.
---
Some people don't like the PvP part, but they are also kind of unrewarding, like most things in the game. I personally love workshops and the free resources and ammo etc. But for a lot of people they are just not very appealing.
---
Np. Also, if you don't want it it would probably fetch a good price due to explosive and weightless. If max level probably about 5k
---
Ok, I'm out  ::hits eject button::  FWOOOOSH!!! *pop* (that's the sound of the parachute popping...)
---
tbh once I got there I bolted for the door, idgaf about stealth
---
Barbed red baseball bat, greaser jacket, didn't bother with the bandana.. It didn't look right
---
I read it as intended. It's all good :)
---
I appreciate it, on ps4 though. :(
---
You probably experienced the phantom budget glitch. Occasionally an item won't refund budget when scrapped, and you have to move your camp to reset it. 
---
I'll give it a try! Thanks!!
---
How often do people really attack each other though? 
---
‚ÄúSorry that‚Äôs toxic‚Äù is just as forgiving as ‚Äúno offense, but‚Äù
---
I got the recording saying to get out of it because they were coming back to it once they found another fusion core so it seems there are a few different variations on the random encounter.
---
Upto +3 on all stats when low on health 
---
When you hate PVP, once is enough. 
---
Whenever I claim a workshop, the game usually crashes for me a few minutes after. Dont feel like putting in all that work for nothing.
---
It's not worth it to me because of all the server disconnects and blue screens. Today I claimed a power plant and got 1 fusion core and then blue screened.
---
I thought of that but I kind of like it, so I was hoping I would be able to build my character around it.  It is max level, and I'm around 110. Been playing with a rifle build but I wouldn't mind changing up and being a sniper. 
---
Good point. 
---
Ok, so what is the best way to get good loot or easiest way to level up? Any good spots for good plans? I‚Äôve tried white spring but that place has some extremely hard enemies
---
Literally.
---
I have to agree, there was this one  instance where 3 SBQ's were summoned (one at a time of course) and zero crashes/disconnects.
---
I was a happy wastelander.
---
Unyielding sentinel is the best for PVE. Sentinel assassin is the best for PVP.
---
I'm on ps4 and I sell for 250 each using my mats
---
I mean you could choose any time you release the update and there will always be people it won't benefit. We all live in a different time zone, we all have different gaming habits...
---
Got any ultra light combat torso? I thought I had it but it seems only for the legs and arms 
---
for me it depends on the situation, i only use PA for Scorched Beast encounters and Nuke Zones (i only went twice though) most of the time i'm using regular armors.
---
no.
---
No amount of time would fix the mess that is 76
---
Its random which one is more difficult. Charlie had the most this week but we got lucky and got it in the first 200ish.
---
Once you get to a certain point, workshops aren't worthwhile.  After all the nerfs to production, its easier, cheaper, and faster to just farm the RSS and craft the things you need.
---
Ig you are good at pvp you can make a fair amount of caps from it. And the way they have set up pvp and workshops you can earn your caps back from killing one person who trys to defend it.
---
I stopped claiming workshops because of a recent update that made there extractors give us one instead of materials. So the only workshops I take if I'm close by are ones with junk extractors on them.
---
I usually go for the ammo factory. Secure it. Build a generator. Get maybe 100 bullets. Game crashes. Not worth it.
---
If you're around level 30 or so, it's still doable with level 65-68 mobs.  I loaded up on shotgun ammo, hopped in my excavator armor, and got a little loop going around that whole building, just back pedaling, aiming for legs or heads, and occasionally stimpacking.
---
Took about 5 minutes if I recall correctly.
---
My first run-in there I was around level 15 and had a horde of 40-60s, including a glowing wendigo. Pretty much did the same thing (partial raider power armor though), but had to fall back to my machete after running out of shells and .44 ammo.  Really the key is to just avoid dead ends and keep moving. 
---
I would argue that Borderlands holds up better than FO76. FO76 was a brand new game and its price was slashed to bargain bin prices within a month of release due to poor sales and bad scores on release. It was clearly not a top reviewed game for current gen games. But in terms of games similar, Borderlands is pretty much everything FO76 wanted to be but failed at. It's a large sandboxed world full of quests, that can be single played or taken multiplayer. They both are weapon based RPG games, and are both set in a heavily stylized/themed world. Borderlands had plenty of replayability, but it also had far fewer bugs, a more action packed playing experience, and lots more to offer in terms of being able to create lots of characters that looked and felt different from one another as compared to FO76 only really having 2-3 real builds at the moment. Borderlands also had plenty of big fights-- far outweighing FO76s 1. Right now a lawsuit has the games development in limbo-- but there's lots of excitement and pent up demand for both borderlands 3 and the rumored remastered releases. When I tell my gaming friends I play fo76, though, they just tell me they're sorry lol... 
---
XBOX got literally everything first of course it‚Äôs playable on Xbox. Or are you just asking if the game is functional on any level yet?
---
&gt; scorch-beast sonic rounds to spam with.
---
Since they're not even facing you half the time they're cearly Epilepsy Ass Blasts.
---
but they cant becuase nopvp mode. i saw once a guy shoot it with tse shotgun and did nto got a single damage but cased him and the turets was shoot him and turned to wanted.
---
Listen to this man(or woman). I've suffered personal health problems due to poor eating and sleep habits, save yourself later by taking the extra time now.
---
Same here. I'm actually getting a fun new network issue that says *Connection Failed, Timed out while waiting for server to respond*, or something to that effect. Never had that before yesterday, no network changes in my end. Did everything they told me to try, still does it 3/4 attempts.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the BoS Bomber jacket, then it is obtainable through the BoS Side Quest Forbidden Knowledge. If you are not talking about the BoS Bomber Jacket (brown leather jacket over Orange BoS Soldier uniform) then the only other Bomber Jacket obtainable in the game is the Vualt Tec Bomber, bought in the atomic shop. 
---
They were invited to go with their group.
---
I‚Äôll try my best to describe as I‚Äôm not in game at the moment. Go to Lady Janet‚Äôs Soft serve. You‚Äôll spawn kind of toward the side/back of it. Walk straight out to road (you‚Äôll see a turned over vehicle. Turn right onto the road and start walking. At this point you‚Äôll be passing the ice cream place with it being on your right. You‚Äôll be heading NW I believe. Take out the enemies at the ice cream shop (I just do it from the road) and carry on in the same direction. Just a minute of walking you‚Äôll see on the road a. Enemies b. Eyebot with rats marching in line behind it c. A normal responder bot OR d. The responder vendor bot. 
---
If no vendor, log out an come in on new server. Rinse and repeat. 
---
And they are useless without proper perks and chems. They also have 4 mods you can install which only look cool but again do nothing 
---
join
---
Idk if it's been mentioned...so much emphasis on making two shot and explosive weapons weaker...what about these ridiculous damage absorption builds that are currently able to take headshots from tse weapons and shrug it off...how do we fight that if you take away our best weapons...i get it dupers killed it for spreading them like wildfire...but making them nearly useless after many of us paid out a crapton of caps to get just one...yeah seems fair
---
Flame, dual bar, bow bar and long bow bar.
---
Can‚Äôt atm. Controller is on charge 
---
The sound of wearing power armor is too annoying for it to be worth while in my eyes + somehow being able to carry less while inside
---
It should really be more clear that you need the Voice of Set or Blade of Bassett to craft them. It looks at first glance like it is safe to get rid of them so you can save space. Or, the lowest level of each could only require a base non unique weapon. Like the 44 and revolutionary sword.
---
Awesome! Ill see you out there
---
I used to claim.workshops constantly. It was worth the cost just for the rewards. Now I've gotten the same plans 20x over.
---
In addition to that, the other day I claimed one and was immediately one shot killed. I know it opens you up to pvp but I hate it. So now I'll go back to grinding resources instead. 
---
That's fine... It'll be a decorative weapon...I have REAL melee weapons.. Just thought this was cool. Thank you for the info though!
---
The butt tuba...  Blasting notes like it's going out of style.
---
With at least guranteed spawn locations just not worth holding onto 
---
Just log out/in repeatedly until you see Whitespring spawn for you at your level.  It's very heavily farmed, but not on every single server.
---
They are good for plans. I've got most plans unlocked just by doing workshops, some events, and bought a few. Workshops are good, just make sure to stash your junk and there's nothing to worry about with pvp.
---
ok
---
To each their own üòé
---
Great to hear! I'd probably join you once I start running out of things to do.
---
Sidenote, what's with people downvoting you? 
---
Will you be on tomorrow? 
---
Yeah a full tear-down and rebuild of the game code could fix a lot of issues... definitely...
---
What quest sent you up there?
---
not worth the investment, plain and simple. Only the Bullet Factory, and power plants are worth the investment, and that's only if you don't get disconnected
---
Forcing vision impared people to waste perk card slots is lame imo, just have something in visual options? I have a friend that uses mods already to change/highlight objects for ease of sight.

Ahh gotcha, well let it be a lesson learned :P 
---
I knew about sentinel from fallout 4 and when I got my first drop of sentinel chest armor, it never came off. Over time I got unyielding sentinel and a few other sentinel+X pieces, but my best drop was a sentinel assassin right leg. I then knew what I wanted so I traded and bought for pieces until now I have a full set of sentinel assassin armor except my left leg which is unyielding sentinel. 
---
I am still invincible in pvp when I have ap and I'm standing still. Radiation and such are still dangerous though, and if staggered by a melee weapon quick enough, they can sneak in a hit or two. But with dodgy rank 3 and dense mod+ fireproof, I am effectively unkillable under the right circumstances.
---
Another interesting bit is Cavalier (-15% damage while sprinting) armor pieces, i think this setup would be good for melee builds who would have to run to someone to land a hit. They would have the same invulnerability, but only while sprinting.
---
If you run into someone using this kind of armor and such, and you choose to engage, I recommend the element of surprise. Sentinel is not active if they are walking or running. Also make it hard to hit you. If they see you they will likely plant themselves. Use this to your advantage by staying out of LoS etc... Radiation weapons do standard damage to these builds. High rate of fire weapons with a huge magazine capacity is ideal as you can drain their ap fast enough to overpower the effects. Melee, you want to be as mobile as possible and hit them hard and fast, repeatedly. Only if your swing speed is high enough can you land another blow before they recover from the stagger, at least as far as my testing has shown me.
---
It still won't let me log in and Bethesda won't help.
---
I suggested this week's ago and staff responded then also 
---
Good news! 
---
I actually have the mod if you want. I just made a post selling several odd ball things. If you want make an offer on it if you are interested. 
---
I just had an encounter with a Wise Mothman. It had purple eyes and freaked me out so I shot it.
---
I‚Äôm not so certain it was actually aggressive but it wasn‚Äôt so wise if it thought startling me while my shotgun was out was the best move.
---
No i have the mod i just cant put it on the hatchet i just need someone with the perk
---
yeah
---
For me it‚Äôs the time needed to mine anything measurable. For the power plants you have to go through the powering up missions, which suck. Then you have to protect them against whatever comes around, and you‚Äôve gotta be on otherwise you lose it. I might grab one if I‚Äôm on a 6 hour binge, but just playing here and there isn‚Äôt worth it. I grabbed thunder mountain earlier and got a few fusion cores, but I could‚Äôve collected just as many in half the time. I wish people would pvp though, it‚Äôs fun for me, win or lose. 
---
What investment exactly? I got like 40 caps sometimes for clearing the enemies. The workshop cost 25 to claim. I put down some extractors and generators using the workshop resources. None of my own unless I want to get a little more creative with it. But yeah disconnects suck, and is probably another of the main reasons people don't do them.
---
People having fun with the mic is one of my favorite things in this game :D
---
Dude rp'ing as Preston Garvey during the SBQ fight 2-3 weeks ago, &lt;3
---
The raider power armor is one of the random encounters around the corner from the Munitions Factory workshop (hang right while facing the workshop, walk around the southern flank of the mountain, then keep going north until the encounter triggers: it's on a small plateau, easily recognizable by a carrot flower).
---
The encounter pool is massive, easily 15 or more different types, multiple rare costume plans, albino deathclaws, etc., but the raider PA (with the same message the OP encountered) comes up rather often. And if you server-hop right from the encounter spot, you'll respawn right in front of the workshop, which is handy.
---
Its all just a pipe dream.
---
Sweet. My gt is M57o message me on there when your on? 
---
Giving the server you are on a name or number- oh wait, they do. Do you really think every single thing I've suggested **isn't implemented** on their end? How do you think private servers are going to work? I am absolutely sure that on their end every single thing I suggested is what they'll see, they don't need to "add you as a friend" to join your world.
---
It wouldn't take much to do this, especially if you understand servers- ever run a private server of a game that's no longer supported? This stuff is fucking easy, you change the flags of what users can see. I have run custom games like this, from somewhat recently to almost 20 years ago.. it isn't rocket science.
---
I'm completely sure that every thing I suggested is how it's done on their end, and them adding survival and who knows what in the future means they could easily bring this into it.
---
It‚Äôs easy. Run up seats to top on west end (river side). Climb on low back wall. Climb onto smaller roof. Minor jump to big roof. 
---
The air tester thingy is up on top on east end. 
---
Considering 95% of my deaths pre-nerf involved me blowing myself up, and I don't expect post nerf to be much different, if one needs the armour for pve, let'em have it.
---
9am Tuesday TSE
---
Second that. Circle of chairs with instruments. 
---
This is dope. You have inspired me! Catch me revamping my camp tonight!
---
That automatically happens.
---
Any workshops you control when you go offline go to your teammates.
---
did you own a workshop at the time? Also suppressed mutations are not gone mutations, I'd suggest keeping pacifict on unless you expect to throw down
---
It just works...except when it doesn't.
---
Oh. Gotcha. Sorry my misunderstanding. 
---
If you have the Atoms to spare, get the light laminated wooden floors! They look really good with the inside of brick walls, and make it look a little more refined. :) 
---
Its alright thanks for trying though
---
The burning is actually the result of the outrageous amounts of fuel I use trying to pretend like a friendly fire build is at all possible to sustain.
---
Hence the driving need for a better option.
---
If naming is implemented, the only person that should *ever* be able to see the name is the person who named it. 
---
OMG that was hilarious and awful.
---
Yeah i havent grinded a nuke zone very recently so its like all i want to do and there really isint much else to do except for server hop for rare mods or outfits which is less than boring
---
You keep saying no they can't kill it but I literally have watched mine get deleted by a TSE, multiple times. Even a level 21 today hurt my mirelurk king with a hunting rifle.
---
You're lucky they don't target your rad shower.  I had to put mine in storage after repairing it twice today.
---
I know those ways, but people should never be forced down a certain path just to have a chance.
---
Know my next "purchase"
---
Time to grind some Atoms.
---
I play most days between 4-12 hours depending if my friends are on, I'm busy, etc.. but usually at least 4 hours. Today my friends and I had our first server crash since the last update, after we were on probably 6-8 hours. So yeah, if you're having the game crash once per hour, sure that's an issue.. I just know you're exaggerating, lying, or just extremely unlucky. Maybe all three.
---
And these aren't high traffic servers eh?ü§î This server you're trying to compare to "thousands of miles away" and run "months or years"üòÇü§£ü§£ please do tell, what do these servers do exactly? I'm sorry, I work in technology, there is **no server** that's professionally managed that's running *months* and certainly not **years**.
---
So you tell me, what do these servers do? Are they not tracking where each player is at any given moment? Loading player assets they've built for how many players at any given moment? NPCs being tracked, voice files, in game event messages.. Jesus Christ, explain how this server isn't constantly sending traffic between it and every player on the server in a huge multitude of ways? ü§î
---
You don't sound very smart and you certainly have no clue how technology works. Bethesda would absolutely be better off giving players like you your 60 bucks and telling you where to shove it- especially if all you're going to do is spread lies and misinformation you have no clue about trying to... What exactly? What are you doing besides lying and crying?
---
Bear rug plans regularly sell at Whitesprings vendor downstairs in the brown hunting store.  Not always but I've seen it there about 30 percent of the time, so your chances are good.  A couple hundred caps tops.
---
If you're on PC, I have the plan learned.  Hit me up. I'll make it for free.
---
Thx. Jumping in queue now. Level 140-something
---
Costco might sell PC version, I saw they sell PS4 for $15.
---
Or Graham in the freaking nuke zone.  Just sell your stuff and get a move on! We're taking on rads here!
---
I would say play the beta mode. It appears that characters are shared between regular and survival, so I wouldn't be afraid of losing progress.
---
Even if characters end up not being shared, progress from the pre release beta was carried over, no reason to think it wouldn't for survival.
---
I spam invite everyone on the map but people rarely accept. It‚Äôs a functional munitions factory you can fast travel to you noobs!!
---
Jet doesn‚Äôt exist yet
---
I regularly collect 400 dirty water from standing water.  I craft 200 boiled waters. I make tons of drinks and leave about half as boiled water for health (ghoulish perk).  
---
I make all the ammo I can at a time.  Give away about half of the types I don't use.  
---
No duping and no bans.  If they can't tell the difference between someone collecting stuff and someone duping, that would be pretty obvious and it would generate a ton of hate for them.
---
She do, last 6kills i had Egghead serum recipe, Ultracite targeting HUD, some decent weps and unyelding sentinel 3\* armor. You just must farm soul out of her.
---
A seperate "defense budget" would help a lot
---
I know. I have a max level anti-armor plasma rifle that is just sitting in my stash. I am itching to use it.
---
I have sneak build, when i recrouch everything lose aggro from me, if every high level used this, lowbies would die.
---
Glad it's being addressed. It happens to me frequently on PS4. Power armor, no power armor...just randomly...so irritating.
---
*Just here for the duped comments*
---
You're forgetting about "griefer"
---
instagasting, or how it is spelled is best for sneak farming anyway. You can onehit everything without blowing yourself.
---
And I  just hit 76 hours 
---
Oh that event, it's a reference to the seebotschatting\twobotschatting stream that had two modified personal assistant devices talking to each other over the course of several days, remember it getting taken down for outside reasons but can't remember EXACTLY what happened.
---
I mean it seems almost there to me. This seems like where the early access shouldve been, and then a finished product finished through the beta. It would be wishful thinking though.
---
Never ever do that, or everyone will remove you from friends, **why would you make server crash?**
---
And do my taxes and finish the project due this week!
---
Becouse if you stagger her while she is doing "landing mechanics" you will cancel it and she is much much much much more bullet sponge in air. It is better to wait till she lands.
---
Why not link the *actual* theme? It's so much better.
---
1-4 cost Perception perk. Observant. 
---
Rank 1 could show dead bodies lit up/highlighted. 
---
Rank 2 could show Junk tagged for Search, highlighted in same way.
---
Rank 3 could show Magazines/Bobbleheads lit up.
---
Rank 4 for Recipes and Plans.
---
hah! cool!
---
I did it in my camp, it just takes some creative wiring.
---
He knows that, but he wants the teammattes to be able to gift his workshop back. Right now you need to capture it by force from your teammate.
---
You forgot one important bit: you can actually join any world a teammate is already on through the social menu or by using the team play option that automatically happens when you crash. The only thing stopping you from playing the way you describe is that the initial world is "fresh" and each server has a player limit.
---
I'm a big fan of server affinity but I would understand if they continued to wait to add it. Had the game launched with a selectable instance or similar ..... Well, none of us would've ever killed Evan. Ever.
---
"Chasing off griefers" is a ridiculous notion that you're better off without.
---
The weird conjecture around "infinite stash limits" is pointless. It certainly does matter if you have 1 or 1,000 wood and decide to transfer partial units. Each player transaction generates multiple server transactions. We know this because the clients definitely do not manage trades. We also know this because of non-instanced containers. This information has to be transmitted to clients which we also know because the vendor lists are not instanced. Trying to relate everything to your experience with Microsoft Access or similar is not honest and identical to the accusations you accuse other players of. :(
---
You do get unscheduled server maintenance alerts and servers do restart outside of crashes. A little message will appear telling you when you will get disconnected. Have you not seen this? I believe it's exactly the same as it was in BETA.
---
Yep,that‚Äôs what he most likely meant. I‚Äôm curious too
---
I am not beliving anything without video proof. There was so much ppl proving they were killed by slap damage, which is absolutly hoax.
---
It's not that hard.  Plenty of ways to get in and get out. You need to hang out in the area nearby so that the mobs you create with your presence spawn.  Let someone else in the area kill them, then you run in and do what you need.  That's just one way, but it'll work every time.  The key is to go when the area is full of people.
---
The opposite is true too.  Go when the area is empty and mobs will spawn near your level so you can take them out solo.
---
Alternately, go in with a ton of grenades and spam the heck out of them.  They'll go down quickly with that.  Having an All Rise or a power fister and the goulish perk makes it easier too.  Several other ways, but there is three to start with 
---
No one is going to know that you are trying to do with the lack of in game communications.
---
I got 32gb of ram oc‚Äôd to 3000...hz? I think, with cl 14, an i7 8700k delided @4,9ghz, an msi gtx 1080 aaand windows 10. I installed it on ssd first but it seems to run better on normal HDD for me. My screen is the Asus rog pg279q, 1440p 144/165hz
---
I tend to use incisor, gladiator perks and a vampire's deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw. 
---
..... or the teammate that owns it just needs to open the social menu and Join you after you join. The workshop will transfer "back" exactly as it was before.
---
The only thing you lose not being the owner is quick travel and being able to manage locks or place some items.
---
oh my god. 200times shooting down that flying bastard to get codes before patch comes out.
---
Who cares if it feels like what is another very decent game?
---
Isn't 76 running heavily-altered Morrowind code? It might just not be up to the level of activity required; one of the main things being "hidden" by the current system is probably how few servers there are, and just how frequently they crash.
---
My favorite melee of all time is my 3* Instigating Super Sledge.
---
Instigating, with 50% more Power Attack Damage, and 90% Reduced Weight.
---
2lbs with a Heating Coil. An enemy at full health takes like 500 Damage for each Heavy Attack (No Perks).
---
I highly recommend trying to find something along these lines.
---
Because I suspect most want to see what you have, so they can decide if it's worth trying to kill you or not. 
---
Maybe the teammate has workshops of his own.
---
Hahaha, I honestly don't know.  Not even a minute after I posted I got my first downvote.  I'm not fishing for karma but I also didn't expect downvotes, at least not without folks letting me know what issues they took with what I do in game.
---
Tfw it took me two or three reads, a good minute or two and you stating it was a south park reference for me to get it was the lochness monster asking for tree fiddy joke.
---
But yeah it's definitely "obvious" 
---
What language is this?
---
I'm hoping for summer~
---
I wasn‚Äôt killed by slap damage, but ganged up on by four low-level players I had to use a Stimpak to not be killed, so, I definitely believe it.
---
People stop Graham that way, so that others can join the server to get to him.
---
PvE with workshop ownership being the exception but you don't lose your junk or caps.  Just someone takes the workshop and kills you, so you respawn and carry on.  PvE with PvP lite.
---
It happens to me only with hunting rifle. without PA on PS4.
---
I saw the Steelbook edition with controller skin at my local Wal Mart yesterday for 40.  Sold out online, but they had a stack of them, I'm assuming they discontinued it.  Regular edition was still 60.  Might be the same deal nationwide and worth checking out.
---
Then we wouldn't have to wait so looong...
---
If both teammates want to do workshop related things then they can just fast travel to each other. ;)
---
Seems kind of counter intuitive that two teammates would want isolated events. If one isn't interested in workshop stuff then have them rejoin. If both are there doesn't seem to be a conflict.
---
Your mum with mouth full of my c\*\*\* language.  Btw: I shot mothman in his stupid red eyes, now you workship deathman.
---
It's 11 screws and 7 springs with perk card.
---
Already posted that months ago.
---
Fallout is a world where we never bothered developing transistors, because power was plentiful. What you want are vacuum tubes!
---
I don't think you can fast travel to a teammates workshop. I think you can only fast travel to his CAMP.
---
But only the owner can fast travel to it. Teammates can only fast travel to you.
---
Get like 5 pistols and tag then as favorites then use them like a pirate. Swithing between them instead of reloading. If your on xbox I can sell you a bloodied dragon or instigating black powder rifle but I wont be on till tommorrow
---
Definitely want faction items like costumes and camp items. Even if it is just cosmetic for now until they actually give us proper factions sometime in the future (hopefully they will).
---
Oh i meant oneshot by slap damage. 
---
Do you have the perk card "Scrapper" equipped? 
---
You can fast travel to the teammate or their CAMP, so if you're both doing events.... You just fast travel to each other _to the workshop_. The owner travels for free to the workshop. The tagalong fast travels for free to the owner.
---
Playable. Sure. For how long? Good question.
---
I lost a tse lever 2 days ago. Jumped from white springs to do a event, went to switch weapons and it was gone. Previously I lost my gauss rifle and a before that was a Gatling plasma. And, No, I didn‚Äôt scarp/drop/sell. One moment it was there, then on reload it was gone. 
---
Pets would be very hard to test as you cant store them to find an exact %. You would need to brung them to an empty can and than max it out, store all items, subtract the stored vs total budget to give you a percent. Seems to be a lot of work just catching pets and each one would have their own budget. Pets would be something that multiple people would need to try and make a new thread about. 
---
Server and crash wise it's decent now, but there still isn't really anything to do
---
I love that spot tho. I also think that the way I have mine set up he can still spawn ive seen him a few times in both the previously mentioned spots. 
---
Check the vendors, especially Watoga and Whitespring.  I've seen quite a few All Rises for sale, still looking for a lvl 50 perfect storm.
---
Meat piles disappear when you loot them clean.  It might encourage players to tidy up after themselves, but probably not.  People are filthy.
---
[Improvise bitch.](https://scontent-prg1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/46501555_2175904422440020_4617364776941518848_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.xx&amp;oh=3fc29ce33f097f23815f1c967ca04ab8&amp;oe=5CBAA7B0) Now give me all your psycho or i will shot you down.
---
I did some for the plans, and I've tried to do each location at least once. Your first workshop especially gives you a ton of them. But now I get mostly repeats. After the first defense event I go on with the game and don't return. I won't be pulled away from something to run back and defend a workshop, and I find more mats than I can sell just by playing normally. Most days I don't take them anymore.
---
Teams can exploit them to attack you with full damage even when you're on the other end of the map with pacifist on, not just when you're taking/defending, but I haven't had that misfortune yet.
---
I'd rather not. Seeing as I enjoy going into silos to help some guy who was solo'ing the silo out so he can get to nuking a place faster. It's all profit at the end of the day. Locking the silo out completely from other players being able to get in them takes away from the puddle of things I've already got to do as endgame options.
---
I was thinking of doing domething similar. I found a vampires automatic handmade that seems like it might be fun.
---
Thoughts?
---
This didnt work for me either, everyone says its a safe method but its not. When my friend went to transfer my 2xhandmade plans into the bag it disapeared when he backed out of transfer menu.
---
Put a node above it and run the wire to that before whatever you need to toggle. Then scrap the wire when you're gone. Hold v to reconnect it when needed
---
After playing a couple of characters and moving mostly away from PC I'm pretty convinced I had the paint because of a BETA glitch.
---
I haven't seen the paint since PC BETA long before anyone knew about any dev room.
---
But now you have the Fireproof perk that gives explosive resist which is just as good.
---
Wow.  Melee already op and left alone but their nerfing the ranged options?
---
I don't understand this at all.  I figured melee would be nerfed to be brought in line if anything,
---
So, sounds like I'm in for disappointment.  
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I may just go back to my old game then.
---
This one has so many poor design choices it seems. 
---
I have 11 luck atm. Starched , bloody mess &amp; class freak would stay with 8 luck
---
That sounds pretty weird to me. Are you using a lot of lights? I have a decent sized house that's got a lot of decorations. Next door is a rather large "greenhouse" which is basically a big warehouse looking thing with an open roof, a farm with quite a few crops in the middle, and two water purifiers. I have all of the crafting tables and at least one of each of my atom shop items/a good amount of lighting as well. Here's an [album](https://imgur.com/a/haSOgg4). I still have a bit of budget left over. 
---
Either your budget storage is bugged out in which case you should try relocating your camp, you've gone crazy with lights, or you're exaggerating how small your house is. 
---
Yeah but the whole point of workshops is to fast travel to them to collect the resources. If your teammate is doing something else you will bother him to fast travel to his workshop that was yours so you can fast travel to him and then tell him to go away. The secondary point of that workshop was for you to have a fast travel point you can use on the map when you want to go to that side of thd map. Anc now you constantly have to bother your friend for it.
---
Saw the tricentennial edition for 30 at Costco 
---
Dang. I'm PC master(or in my case, Mistress) Race. 
---
So as stated above if you go the the shops in Whitesprings (in the actual resort not the train station), one of the shops is a hunting store and he always sells the bear rug plan (almost exclusively). Its the store with the animal heads on the wall and he literally has a bear rug on the floor. He has had it for sale everytime I have seen his inventory.
---
I can say from experience, the dark laminate kooks great with brick interior. Throw in some "Resort" plan items and you're living in the lap of post-apocalyptic luxury. 
---
Kudos on the BnB. Won't rad shower be useless endgame since people will go for nerd rage, adrenal reaction, radicool, unyielding and bloodied to maximise damage? I stopped using mine for a while already
---
You can get meat from your CAMP brahmin using the perk butchers bounty
---
DPS meter like was addon in WoW but hidden in pipboy. In first slot about your character. Could be counting whole group dps.
---
Not to defend the griefers, but they are enjoying their game. OP is not.
---
Fantastic idea.
---
Alternately, add in an unfilled diamond outline on corpses when using a recon scope, or perhaps when eating a new chem that highlights or puts a marker over corpses (Mentats Black?)
---
If you don't swap weapons, the diamond stays above the corpse until you swap weapons or you loot the corpse clean and the body disappears.  For obvious reasons that doesn't work very well in a group or community activity like a blast zone or SBQ.
---
I love when I drop into the game and see a few new players to fast travel to and supply ammo, weapons and armor to.
---
It's alot better nowdays but still toxic as all hell xD
---
I mean, sure?
---
The point being that it would be pretty awkward to be on a team that is doing completely unrelated things at all times. If you can coordinate "gifting" a workshop I think you can coordinate resource gathering..... Besides, you would think the team would want to do the workshop events that happen regularly together.
---
I'm all for a workshop gift system but it seems like we're just building a reason that the existing system wouldn't work for teammates who aren't actually playing on any team. That seems odd.
---
My weapons do still wear down faster than they self-repair at rank 2 so I plan to upgrade Luck of the Draw to 3. I'm a melee and pistol build though.
---
Lucky Break (for armor) on the other hand seems to work fine at 1 so long as White Knight is at 3.
---
Good to know! Thank you!
---
I ceelbrated it by fishing an exploding (but Assassin's, not two-shot) double-barrelled shotgun out of someone's trashdump at Watoga and used it to finally, FINALLY go in and clear the mission where you have to find Taggerty's body. I've made it to the end once before but, while walking backwards and shooting wildly, fell into a Scorchpit and died. BUT! With this being the last day of Exploding POWAH, I figured, hey, let's do this thang.  
---
And promptly killed myself the first time I shot the thing at a Scorched.  
---
And then the server crashed.  
---
And then on teh third attempt I killed a Scorched, waited a second, stepped up to loot it, and somehow stepped on a bunch of unexploded shotgun pellets and died.  
---
BUT THE FOURTH TIME I actually made it through!  
---
And that's a victory in my book!  
---
(alas, no Marine wetsuit for me tho.)
---
I used to claim 5-10 workshops per session to farm plans. Now I have almost everything. No point claiming workshops anymore.
---
I've never once since the beta had a server give a notification that it was shutting down unless it was for an update. I'm on PS4, if you're on PC that may be the case.. they've said they roll out mini updates to PC clients. But I've probably got more hours than most, and I've never seen a shutdown timer otherwise.
---
And it would absolutely make a difference if I could join the same static world or make a particular server my home. Sure, I can join a friend on whatever *random server* they're on, but we'll only play with all the other players until we get off or crash. What's the negative to this? It would only create more, smaller communities of people that enjoy playing with the same players, without having to add them or join them.
---
Besides, what multiplayer game does random servers? I honestly can't think of one. Sure, games where you can join a random server, games that hide the interface.. but even games like battlefield 1 or 5 have kind of hidden menus where you can search and join specific servers- just most don't know they're even there.
---
And as someone who's known multiple players that have from 25,000-6,000,000 pounds on their character or in their stash, arguing much smaller numbers that anyone who isn't actively cheating would actually want.. my point is that I've never seen a server crash because of these people. I've seen them spend hours on the same server selling their shit moving at 2mph, hell an entire day.. it had zero impact on our multiple queen fights, etc.
---
My point isn't for an infinite stash, it's that the "weight" of an item shouldn't be what's discussed when it comes to stash limits. I know how different game databases work, as long as it's working with real numbers that the game is designed to process- it's basic math. Players make all kinds of false assumptions about what creates server load, most of which are wrong.
---
And as for "chasing off griefers" I explained it better later. True assholes might thrive in a server where people don't know each other like we have now- but if you had a home world and someone started messing with someone you may have chatted with, randomly bumped into a few times.. they're the ones that would be server hopping if the people on a server truly didn't want them there.
---
This is all going to have to come at some point between survival mode and private servers, so why not sooner than later? Where's the negative? Why does there need to be random worlds? Why is that positive in any way?
---
I say it's an odd design choice, but to be honest with myself the more I think about it.. it seems like a dumb choice. It's why I've had people telling me they had 7 crashes in a few hours, multiple times today.. versus being able to choose a young server so you don't have that issue. Or if you want to claim workshops and not worry the server is going to crash in the next 20 minutes.
---
I simply don't see *any downside*. Worst case, someone's being an asshole and you have to leave server- which is what the *current solution is*, so my idea isn't any worse off.
---
I found one today at level 80 and scrapped it.  It was in the basement of Mountainside Bed and Breakfast on a shelf.  No idea if it was random or not.
---
WOOHOO time to jump right back in
---
I know where you are. I had my camp in that exact spot; it‚Äôs a nice overhang over the pond.  If you‚Äôre on PS4, my new location is about 300 yards NW of you (at the end of the other pond)
---
I use luck of the draw and lucky break (both maxed). The only luck perks I use. Have been using for quite a number of levels and along with white knight I definitely repair armour hardly ever. Can not say how much Luck of the Draw affects my weapons, as I am still repairing once most play sessions and it's been at least 40-50 levels since not using it.
---
I paid full price on xBox (60 ish UK) (played for around 10 hours!) then got it massively discounted on one PC (14 ish UK) and have been playing now for 100 hours + - the game is worth it :)
---
Just got the Handmade plan from the patrol duty event at level 63. Jumped in after it started and it was my first time even seeing the event! Lucky... I know but still very excited! But it can be done. 
---
Why is the defensive wall 1.5%? Why does railing cost 3X as much as the floor? 
---
1, Xbox One S
---
2, Rapid Pony lvl 71

3,
---
4, As a long term player of all Fallout games. I felt I should join Reddit to reply to this thread.
---
I play 5 hours everyday after work.
---
Issue 1, Cannot make X01 armour even though I have everything needed.
---
Issue 2, Invisible enemies
---
Issue 3, Game crashes when too much is going on, like when there are 10 enemies trying to kill me.
---
Issue 4, game crashes at end of quests for no reason.
---
Issue 4, game does not load. Retry and retry and eventually get in to game.
---
Issue 5, making bulk items just deletes the items after they are made. I no longer make bulk items.
---
Issue 6, Which isn't a bug but is annoying. Players who have given up with the game due to its faults are now just finding players using Fast Travel and killing them. High level players are making servers unplayable üëé 
---
 Yesterday I gave up finding a server that didn't have someone kill me within 10 minutes of being in the game and then sending me a message ' Game is Dead and Broken, Thanks for caps, Leave ' Oh Joy. 
---
 I've been playing games for about 40 years. This game reminds me of the 2000's where every game was unstable. 20 years on and we've gone backwards. In all honesty I can't see today's patch doing much. I Truly hope it does. But once bitten twice shy.
---
 I will honestly be a bit apprehensive about buying another Bethesda game until I have read reviews after a few weeks of release. 
---
 Sorry, but this game is just a complete mess. 
---
It's because people are constantly bragging about taking out camps there these days. Now all the lemmings are doing it because it's seen as a good thing. I understand taking out the people being inconsiderate with turret camps but plenty of people have places there that don't have turrets or disrupt the spawns. 
---
You will need demolition, gunslinger and rifleman perks to get the best out of it.
---
Green eyes is scorched mothmen.
---
Red eyes is stalker or regular agresive one.
---
Thank you so much for these! I didn't think to see them so quickly and my husband wants to launch his first nuke. Also, kudos to creating the program to run through launch codeword possibilities! 
---
Are you gonna fix the muation duds? I have an invisible speed demon mutation, not active and not showing up. I dont wanna risk my set of 6 mutations just to cure speed demon to get it back again. I wasted a serum yesterday. 4000 caps down the drain. Pls Bethesda.
---
As someone else stated, fallout universe never had transistors 
---
Seems broke ran it twice tonight and didn't get XP or any other rewards.
---
Assuming that every player min/maxes and plays the same way, you're right.  I have adrenal reaction and bolstering armor, so I have benefit at either full or low health, but I'd rather be at full health at a golf club nuke or doing SBQ.  My argument is that staying alive the whole time and putting consistent rifle damage with sneak attack multipliers while she's flying is more effective than being a glass cannon, getting hit from behind by a deathclaw and respawning constantly at 20% health or less.  I can put down 3000+ damage a shot with my rifle (including sneak attack 2.5x or 3.5x) at full health and maxed Adrenaline bonus.  Being able to apply that sustained pressure is kinda like choosing to be a KO artist with no cardio, or a volume striker that can maintain the same amount of pressure for 25 minutes.  Both have advantages.
---
I made a post about this right when the game was released, I think that this would be the best time to, especially since it‚Äôs in real time
---
You're having, a stroke.
---
Still a crash, regardless of terminology. It's a funny concept, though: "This game sucks so much, my PC crashes when I play it on PS4!" XD
---
Any fix for the Team invite bug? 
---
description: Player sending an invite but no request found on the Social Team Tab.
---
That's bad design mate, I like the game  but if you get the quest at level 15 (more or less), 
---
You shouldn't be taking advantage of that kind of things to complete it.
---
I get that in MMO games this happens but we are talking about a quest that you get at low level. 
---
Nah i just sympathized with OP because i knew how it felt. I have a friend who always captures the ammo factory. And he constantly disconnects. And jnstead of always bothering me to travel there he rather just psy the caps to recapture it again. But none of that matters anyway because we are not doing workshops since they got nerfed. They give ores instead of scrap and my acid is too precious for sone useless materials. I use all my acid on making bullets so there is no readon for me to capture workshops anymore. Especially since i can't hold on to more then 100 of each material without being considered a hoarder.
---
I also regretted paying $60. Should have waited a week after launch before getting it for half price. I've learnt the lesson and won't pre-order games anymore. It's a good game though!
---
...and in the next hour 20+ topics: "The game bugged, lost my stash box #38 full of Ultramarine Armor sets and twenty legendary 6-stars Bozars, this shit sucks, Bethesda, gib back or else". 
---
Just increasing the basic STASH would be fine.
---
I got another one where a pre-recorded message from a raider said he's going to kill me when he gets back.
---
Same, I got this one
---
r/iamverysmarr
---
To be fair, not everyone will. I'm not super into min/maxing. I did all that on my melee but I'm kind of over it now. 
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Indeed we do need this.
---
That's the only reason I could see they wouldn't want it visible.. but then again shitty games like ark have 300+ servers, despite it being a broken game on everything it's played on, costing the same as this game, etc.. why do people assume there's less players in a game that does so much more?
---
Right now with players being thrown on random servers, Bethesda has no way of seeing the cause of crashes. Maybe it's player inventories, maybe it's server age.. there's no benefit for them to this random shit either way.
---
And the amount of modding to the code they had to bring this engine to multiplayer, servers simply track the kinds of things I mentioned. And it isn't Morrowind, I don't know why people make that assumption. Fallout 4's engine is the most recent that would have been brought into this generation console, and despite what people think, every bug fix is actually them improving upon the engine (well almost every fix).
---
The sad truth many don't realize, if they had fixed all of the bugs in each one of their games, the engine would have evolved because that's what they would actually be fixing. The engine. The good news is that a lot of these fixes can be applied to whatever future games they publish, multiplayer or no. It's becoming a new engine the more code they change.
---
If you are on PS4 i have 400 from farming queen, and it weight a lot. 
---
Thank you. I appreciate your help. 
---
Been playing since the beta. Can agree, haven't done lick of quests. Sitting here at 150lvl 
---
At the moment, no, not really. It's a shame, too. This should have been an easy-to-implement guild system. Bethesda managed to make a decent MMO with Elder Scrolls Online, so why did they drop the ball?
---
Thank you! Got to launch my first nuke last week because of you guys. 
---
Sometimes my friends and I drop bags to trade loot between two players in the group. I like to casually walk over and slip a mini nuke into the bag so that the character who picks it up is unknowingly weighed down.
---
Can you keep the armor?
---
Ah, the hourly reminder of this. 
---
Oh well, I just accidentally dropped my shotgun and it didn't make a bag so maybe hourly reminders are what they need to fix it already. 
---
Good points!
---
Lucky break lvl 3 works amazing,  I haven't had to repair my armor in about a week
---
I like the idea but would extend it to faction-specific dailies/weeklies that fit within the theme of each faction. E.g. 
---
* BOS - find and secure tech (by force if necessary)
---
* Responders - setup and/or defend survival resources
---
* Order or Mysteries - infiltration and assassination missions
---
Right now since we don't have to commit to one faction, it's more for flavour than anything else but if there is ever a time where we have to make that choice, I'd like that choice to in some way be influenced by our preferred playstyle or encourage you to try out a playstyle you may not be use to.
---
I have rank 1 and it is ok, i dont even need gunsmith. Depends on which weapon you have, some breaks way too fast.
---
I don't think melee is as bad though. I've heard of some TSE guns being close to a thousand damage if not a little over. Hell I have a "The Dragon" gun that is in the 400s and that's just from perc cards. It doesn't even have any ledendary effects. If that was a two shot it would be like 800 DMG. add explosive to that and it would be way over a thousand. I don't think I've ever had any mele weapons go over like 250 dmg, but it's depending on perc cards. The thing is, the scorched beasts spend a lot of time in the air so guns are pretty effective, but when it lands you can get some really good melee damage on it. The problem is most of the fights will be spent waiting for it to land. You usually see a ton of TSE ammo flying at them and then when it lands everyone runs to melee it. I currently have a double hand weapons and shotgun/rife build. I do have an explosive light machine gun and a revolver, but I haven't really had any issues with balancing  the perc cards to use my main weapons with a card or two to make the explosive weapons effective. Do keep in mind you CAN NOT use any weapon that is a "fist weapon" while in power armor. That's why I went with two handed weapons. If you spent all your level uos making sure your death claw gauntlet is super strong you won't be able to use it in a nuke zone unless you wear a hazmat suit. 
---
r/fo76bazaar 
---
I think
---
Yeah, I told my self I wasn't going to buy a Tse weapon. But since the scorched beasts are annoying af, I've made a desperate call and bought a Tse 50cal. The ammo isn't cheap. But finally being able level the playing field makes me feel better.
---
Yea other then nuke zones I don‚Äôt see any other purposes for power armor. Even Then. I‚Äôm typing in my hazmat just running like crazy ha
---
I think the logic behind the defensive wall being 1.5% budget is that the wall has increased health. 
---
Time is a construct that you don‚Äôt quite understand.  Have you ever tried Jet?
---
You have the sight don‚Äôt you
---
Well...  damage-wise the gauss is way way higher.
---
But I use the bolt-actions (particularly pipe) because I prefer lighter weight for VATS use, and I personally dislike the charged-fire of the Gauss.  Also the former are ballistic physical damage, while the Gauss is energy, and I run the Grounded mutation.  If playing bare-bones, without many ammo perks, EC ammo can also be hard to keep up with, while .308 and .50 are plentiful.  .50 Receivers especially do well with ammo efficiency when crafted.  
---
Ok so You would like to spend those 20 min walking across? Couse I wouldnt.
---
I've been playing this game for 500hrs and have yet to find one. FML.
---
I hate open mic'ers giving me a delayed echo of ever sound in the game.  It's so annoying. 
---
So you learned you wanted Sentinel gear without learning what sentinel was?
---
Seems like you might need to actually look at the game not guides.
---
You mean the prime ultracite Gatling laser receiver?  I have that plan.  Offer?
---
Whoa, calm down. I don't care if you never once said it or not - it's a thing. And on PS4, too. I play on both, but now mostly on PS4 with my friends. It's been the same since BETA. I guess you're lucky or unlucky depending on how you view it.
---
The negative to dedicated servers at a point where we've already smashed into instance problems is obvious. Killing Evan was a good example - if your teammate beat you to it you were screwed. That, from what I understand, has been fixed. You'll also hit the occasional server with glitched out quests (it says you can fast travel, but you don't) and have to wait until.... Who knows what to unstick it. There are still the occasional servers that just don't track quests, although they're much rarer.
---
Having each session be analogous to the movie Groundhog's Day isn't all that bad. Your CAMP maintains persistence along with your progression on certain quests. There isn't much else that would make sense to persist. The worlds aren't random at all outside of the events. And finally, as I said, I would like server affinity but surely you have been on this Reddit before? People would be in actual tears that they can't server hop for one fusion core per half hour... As a more legitimate usage example, it's good to hop if your events are broken (which is happening less and less with Line in the Sand now working every time it pops).
---
It sounds like you want a towns experience and I want the events to works, so we are clearly going to have some differences in opinion. Persistence and the same players being nearby has nearly no impact on my experience and I'm probably not going to understand how it impacts yours. You don't understand why having broken events impacts mine. We have different expectations. That's not a bad thing.
---
There was a clan that tried experimenting with people that had infinite stash weight. They reported no problems. They also experimented with the trap spam on PC and noted _significant_ performance problems when people were trap spamming. You can probably find the post here on Reddit. The reason I bring it up is because once again a static amount of stuff seems trivial but that stuff is meant to be transferred, crafted, etc. What happens when 20 people all spam super duper Marine Tactical Helmet x 1,0000 crafting at the same time? Certainly not what happens in Microsoft Access......... Get some friends together and try it. ;) _You aren't making any more accurate assumptions than most other players_ and trying to suggest you have more information than Bethesda because you know basic math. It's conjecture. It's nonsense. If you'd like to let us know what combination of redis, kafka, postgresql, mysql, activemq, kahadb, S3, ObjectRocket (ha!), or dozens and dozens of combinations of technology beyond _basic math_ that they're actually using then we can have a conversation. :)
---
How does this work when you're higher level, though? You get to build a bigger base the higher you are. Wouldn't the percentages go down? I have way more than 100 walls/foundations/roofs and still plenty of decorations, benches, defenses and a ton of lights.
---
Is there a cap?
---
In some cases, they might only be able to one shot you if it's a combination of a) Instigating + b) Critical + c) Sneak Attack, which would mean they can do it the first time when they catch you off guard, but not a second time.
---
Of course, if it's someone using a TSE then that's a whole different story.
---
Thats why i said hopefully. I had some idiots trying to attack me. I just ignored them or one shot them or changed the server in an instant lol. There is always a way.
---
More than agree
---
That's what I'm saying, though; at its core this is the same engine they used to make Morrowind 17 years ago. They overhauled it for Fallout 3/ Oblivion/ Fallout: New Vegas, and again for Skyrim/ Fallout 4, and now another overhaul to make it multiplayer compatible. And that's not even touching the changes they made between overhauls for each game, or the patches they released for each individual game.
---
This is an old, jury-rigged system, being pushed light-years beyond what it was meant for. Add to that the fact that most of the code has simply been added piecemeal, as needed, and you have a giant mess of miss-matched code, parts of it older than the people playing it. It's a bit of a shock the servers run as well as they do, honestly. 
---
&gt; With full perks for a build and a TSE sniper weapon (which apparently do a LOT of dmg), someone could easily 1 shot you both.
---
Don't even need a TSE. I can one shot high level players with sneak attack + critical + VATS headshot + Instigating sniper rifle. All the multipliers work together for very high damage, though only on the first shot while you are stealthed and have a critical waiting to use.
---
I would love a Pip-Boy app for Fallout 76! I was actually really hoping there would be one.
---
have you tried just re placing it instead of rebuilding it?  
---
Normally just costs 40 or so caps and everything is rebuilt.
---
This is really just an argument about why your character should have completely separate inventory between game modes. Which I agree with. I don't think anything except what you've learned to craft should be transferable. It's going to ruin the experience overall.
---
There's also the danger that people will truly just be assholes just to ruin your experience in survival. You manage not to die long enough to get a halfway decent base built, can someone come and destroy it for no reason and no repercussions?
---
But would You like to spend 20 min of Your real life time just to get across? Couse I wouldnt. But everyone to there own.
---
Yeah, I completely understand everything you just mentioned.
---
To be honest, though, the munitions factory always kind of sucked. You'd get more use out of the lead extractor than the ammo-maker-o-matic thing, but it was kind of nice to leave for 30 minutes and come back to a pre-made batch.
---
I don't use acid. I clear WestTek, etc often enough that I nearly always have excess steel and gunpowder.
---
Hah, yeah. There have been several similar threads that didn't really take off as well as this one!
---
Chloe I think her name is. She made me look for Opossums, cash payout once you tagged 5.
---
Ya thats fine they call it whatever I just want to build switching logic circuit.
---
not everyone makes low health builds and they are not at all required to succeed in any aspect of the game.
---
But that was exactly flyingboat's point.
---
I sometimes buy useful schematics I already have that low level would have been nice to have and drop them off in the flatwood's vendor's cash register. Things like 10mm or 44 pistols, etc. 
---
Make cranberry pies (or whatever they are) and dump them in newbie concentration zones is nice too (+5% exp)
---
You cannot be serious, and if you are, that statement is more than enough evidence as to why your opinion should not be taken seriously
---
\+1 just for the silly-ness!
---
You're a man after my own heart. I find a combination of power armor, stimpacks, and sprinting will get you just about anywhere you want to go.
---
+1, but two things:
---
Gauss damage is ballistic with a small AOE. It is not energy. It only counts as an energy weapon when crafting, with science perks, and with the grounded mutation but the damage type is not energy.
---
EC cartridges are some of the cheapest ammo to craft in the game as they only require steel and lead. They do count for Batteries Included weight reduction which pairs well with PA (fusion cores). All other guns are Bandolier and require steal, lead, and gunpowder.
---
Nah. Some power armor, an AA heavy gun, and say four perks (the three Heavy Gunners and Stabilized) can put a hell of a dent in her.
---
Thank you and happy building to you
---
Transparency is the CONTENT of the patches, not the fucking timing of them.  If they released the damn thing days after the patch dropped then yea, bitch away.  But you're not going to be playing during the maintenance so what difference does it make that that's when the notes drop?
---
Are you talking about re-placing the entire camp?
---
I love how this got downvoted, it is literally the truth.
---
What if there are no actual dupers and Bethesda is just planting the idea of them in our heads to see what becomes of our community?
---
You've gotta hand it to the Raiders: what they lack in basic human empathy, they make up for with an imaginative sense of humor. 
---
I intend to still play the game normally.. An arena sounds absolutely dull, GTA for example has hundreds of instanced arenas that grab part of the map to do whatever the rules entail.
---
The issue with that is that.. it's boring. But I think getting randomly one shot every time you bump into another player might be boring too. Or at least annoying.
---
I think the problems in games like GTA is they don't give players reasons to work together, interesting co-op events that are challenging.. you've got nothing better to do than kill other players. And if this game just makes it a free for all I don't see a different result. 
---
I think every game mode would benefit from having something like world/raid bosses- something different and challenging that brings people together. And survival would benefit from having small safe zones where there's simply no PvP at all..
---
How on earth do you have the time for this?! 
---
"Fallout 76 has bad graphics, durr hurr" 
---
I talk all the time (not annoyingly I hope) and I feel like a lone radio DJ hoping for a bit of human contact. I say hi when I come on the server, broadcast when I drop stuff in train station cases and often just laugh at the weird stuff I see that amuses me, around the game world.
---
Not one response ever... it‚Äôs so weird.
---
I have never seen that.  I barely use my power armor, have the X-01 from the main questline that works fine for me, so I walk right past suits that spawn randomly.
---
Someone obviously didn‚Äôt get the cowboy game
---
I'm afraid it comes down to placement. Blackwater Mine is right next to the Whitesping, a prime end-game farming spot, and is host to the Uranium Fever event, another farming spot. Basically, you're running into the enemies spawned for level 100+ players in the area. 
---
Interesting, I just got the challenge for playing 76 hours yesterday!
---
Awww ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÇ
---
That's the old code. I managed to launch a nuke from Alpha tonight with 66470936 
---
Pretty sure her name is Rachael.
---
I just adopted a very nice legendary bolt action pipe rifle for my long range shootin' and it's the only rifle where the recon scope doesn't completely obstruct the lower right quarter of my view.  I'm actually looking forward to finding her and completing this little random encounter.
---
Check you don't have more than one in your inventory. 
---
Best solution is to find a new game.
---
That makes sense! I heard somewhere that the enemies spawn level is based off the players in that area. 
---
No, you don't need to know how to make it. Try placing all your junk into your stash; the game tends to freak out if you have some of the crafting components you want to use in your inventory, and some in your stash.
---
I'd totally subscribe if you post more btw!
---
Perk swapping from the phone would be amazing!   Yes, there would probably be a couple of seconds of lagginess when swapping as the packets go through, but...
---
Amazing.
---
I have zero interest in survival if I have to make a new character. It's just dumb. I've got a second character and learning all the crafting, cooking, mods, etc.. it's too much of a pain.
---
But I also have no interest if people get to keep all their stuff. I'd rather everyone just starts fresh, I would have no problem with my build using what I can find till I can find something better.
---
...  And send any tamed pets off on "jobs" or "missions" to collect junk/xp/caps?
---
.... is that the normal response? Then yes.... i have twice the thumb. 
---
Exactly!! They are starting a sequence of events that will lead to the end of the world... 
---
Is there a Discord chat yet?
---
I got one set in a trade, it's my favorite outfit in the game, it has the Responders symbol on the backpack and looks great!
---
The games are more than ten years old; if your computer lets you get to this site, it'll run Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics.
---
I'd love to see a firebreather themed PA paint! \*upvoted\*
---
I agree I want to see more
---
The items dont drop from those specific events. They can drop from events in the forest and toxic valley in general. They are not Fire Breather items, though. The items are called [Responder Fireman Helmet and Reaponder Fireman Uniform](https://imgur.com/a/h31T1mg). They have a drop chance of about 3%. And there are many other cosmetics on the loot tables. So these items cant be farmed. It can take you weeks or months to find them.
---
But I support your plea for more responder/fire breather items. Id love to see them, too.
---
I think they should make vendors approachable by any char at this same time. Its a bit funny if You have to stand around for 10 min couse someone cant decide what to buy.
---
It's helpful if you don't fast travel everywhere.  My camp is just north of Whitesprings Station, and I usually just make the walk up to Pleasant Valley to vend there and check what the two raider bots have.  It's less than a couple minutes and 90% of the time there's a lvl 50+ legendary or two if I pause to check Safe 'n' Clean, 98 NAR or S Cutthroat.  S Cutthroat is really good for the ammo I use, so I always clear it out even if I'm lazy and fast travel to Pleasant Valley for vending.
---
Maybe 5% of the time I'll run into a random encounter on the way, usually the prize bot or the Handy asking to be repaired.
---
It isn't hard to kill stuff if your build doesn't suck, I currently kill shit at events like sons of Dane with random melee weapons I've picked up so my friends get a hit- plenty of legendary drops.
---
If your build doesn't work with normal non legendary weapons you need a new build. I could definitely work with just about any weapon I find with any level enemy.
---
Go search the YouTube video of a guy killing scorch beast in a few seconds with an automatic pipe rifle that's only level 1. Your argument just hasn't been tested.
---
I wish they were stronger though. Considering they are called heavy weapons, it kinda sucks how bad they are. :(
---
Forgot about that but yeah.. the loot is one star regardless between the two.
---
I picked it up for ¬£32 on launch from CD-Keys. Must be so much cheaper now.
---
The same thing happened to me. I got obliterated my first time. I tried again the next day and the enemies had dropped 20 levels. Try server hoping; eventually, you should find a fair fight.
---
Si how does the grounded mutation affect it? Does it nerf gauss damage or not?
---
I just was in my first blast zone... Killed so much found so much, springs steel all kinds of stuff.  Disconnected, world full... Finally get in an all my junk was gone
---
Thanks for the info, Blocker is a card I always have loaded, works very well.
---
&gt; I have zero interest in survival
---
This is what I took away from your post, so if you're not interested in it either way, then move along.
---
Alright thanks a lot
---
I had no idea!
---
This bug is the bain of my playtime. You need to have all of the repair materials in either your inventory or your stash, not spread between them. The game freaks out if you try to draw on both inventories at once.
---
Always stash junk. Even if it's just the rare junk. I don't know how much this needs to be emphasized to everyone. With the instability of the game at times, pvp, and stuff like that, junk needs to be number 1 priority thing to stash.
---
Most modern game Betas are more about building buzz for the game than really stress testing anything. The fact that developers almost never Beta test their day one patches before Go Live is the biggest hint.
---
'ere's 'oping
---
&gt;because we sometimes get a miscellaneous quest on our own death bag.
---
Ftfy
---
OK, I understand your points, it is very useful but is unbalanced, maybe this will be fine tuned over time.
---
&gt;In real life
---
you were done right there.
---
&gt; It isn't hard to kill stuff if your build doesn't suck, I currently kill shit at events like a violent night (sons of Dane) with random melee weapons I've picked up so my friends get a hit- plenty of legendary drops.
---
Lets see you get naked and punch a lvl 68 scorched conqueror to death with a shotgun build. Because that's what we're talking about, not having weapons and armor that are bad for your build. No shit you can make that work, which is why I said to give everyone a shitty starter set. Trying to scavenge while totally naked and having no weapons is just a bad time. I don't need to watch some guy waste his life with a lvl 1 pipe weapon to know that having nothing at all is a different experience. The problem here is that you don't understand words.
---
It does, actually! When I first ran into it I didn't have mine handy, but on the next pop-in I had my Firebreatehrs gear ready to go. It let me know about some Events that were happening around the map, so I could fast travel to 'em. Handy lil' guy!  
---
Never have gotten the Morse COde one to do anything. Need to break out my old scout manuals and see if I can translate it.
---
I might be mistaken, but don't they usually reset again if there's server maintenance/ an update in the week
---
Your better off farming the forest locations for scrap and ammo than the work shops. 
---
yeah, go up to the roof of the biggest building and fall down the elevator shaft...
---
terminals are not computers
---
keypads are not fuse boxes
---
this isn't real life
---
quit while you're behind
---
"time to make the [blue] donuts!"
---
Obviously you can't read then. I definitely have interest if I can bring just my character with crafting recipes. They're not going to let us bring much of anything with us because it's not what anyone wants.
---
I do look forward to finding people like you who are intentionally assholes and turning your face into meat pie üòã I don't think you have any business being here with your selective hearing.
---
I for one sincerely hope we one day get private servers and I can find a private server with no SB screaming meamie blue donuts being hurled at me
---
Love my Grognaks axe, only a 1* but it‚Äôs 10 times better than any of my other weapons.
---
My view is you don't like it, don't buy it. Only bought a few items, still waiting for more interesting colours for armour to spend my atoms on.
---
I'd like a little more that \`k for that, it's a 3\* instigator so basically it's a two shot with accuracy :)
---
rip, once day I'll find it!
---
Yeah, we started using this workaround for silos recently after a lot of invisible-player problems. Hasn't failed yet.
---
White knightx3 and the armor repair &gt;100% perk mean rarely repairing your armor and it's very very cheap.
---
How do you increase faction with him then?  All he sells to me is garbage...
---
Launched a 3rd one but server is full so I went for it 
---
Where can you find mods for the mining helmet?
---
I searched and searched but never found anyone posting that they knew them all. DI you have to scrap a lot to get them all?
---
I know it. It's happened to me 4 or 5 times, but its been probably 2 months since it's happened. I'm triple the level I was the last time it happened. Dammit, just goes to show. There goes 400 ballistics fibers and 200 black titanium
---
What If the mayor appointed the Sheriff and was the only one who could delete/assign build space. Perhaps he could zone it so vending took place in on area and crafting in another. Sheriff should be able to trespass players, forcing them out of the town. The Mayor should be able to fire the Sheriff, and choose his replacement. Finally the Town should be a good spot to sell things, allowing players to get roughly 600 caps so they feel a need to go to town.
---
Sylvie's Logging place, about an inch the the right of Sond of Dane. My friend had a hog next to his old camp by Ohio River Adventures in the west if you haven't checked it out.
---
üò¢üò¢üò¢
---
Did you feel any disappointment at the loot you did or didn't receive for all that effort?
---
I would join you, but it's 2:30 in the morning, and I'm trying to get some sleep...
---
It does because grounded reduces damage of all energy weapons. Every other energy weapon does energy damage (see: laser rifle) but the Gauss gets a ballistic damage nerf because it deals ballistic damage.
---
It's kind of weird but kind of makes sense? Grounded mutation is apparently "grounding" the capacitors which throw the ballistic projectile out, I guess, kind of like it "grounds" the cells making the laser beam...
---
Most people just wear power armor so they get the extra carry weight from it especially the excavator armor since its really weak but gives you that extra carry weight, Id like to not wear it since it makes the game feel a little clunky but cant give up the weight :P (im lvl 167)
---
I replied to another wastelander on here with the list of radiums I have available, have a look :)
---
What do you do with the responder ID card? Found one haven't figured out what to do with it.
---
check my reply to another use to see what spare ones I have...
---
upvoted
---
entertainment factor is over 9000
---
I think she's alive. How else would she know that we dropped a nuke, and manage to place it at the Silo we used to drop the nuke?
---
the immersion tho 
---
Nicely done. Thank you. 
---
i think it'll be ok, I mean the guns do a lot of damage now but yeah, nerfing TS is not a good look when you take into account that a high percentage of your shots will miss anyway. Maybe you can find another legendary effect to have on a radium? Anti armour explosive and bloodied are flavour of the day now!
---
It might be easier to have each lot overlap its neighbors so there is a shared space for both to build.  You would just want to show all the lots build zones faintly in white and your active one in the green camp style border.
---
I would also think it would be easier to have the entire town show for you not just the sections you own.  If that's the case you could let the town exist in all servers the members are in.  Just add a few caveats.  First is the game would try to put those with the same town into the same server.  If you do end up in different servers you could use your town normally.  But if you tried to enter build mode you would get a message saying you can't build currently and encourages you join the same server as your other town members.  Only when all online members of a town are in the same server can you do any building to avoid issues. 
---
do it! if you're on ps4 we can go out on the razzle together!
---
thx lol i'm right with u don't blame you but my spouse came home a shit show so sleeping isnt in my cards. figured i'd start a glass cannon build aimed at unyielding
---
It's what you sign up for when you play fo76. You're just beta testing until their first major patch to attempt at a relaunch.
---
Has this happened to you yet?
---
I had a couple of griefers hit my base.   They were trying to push me into attacking the wanted guy while another hid in sniping range.
---
But they did not attack my Shower.   I perma-blocked them both and changed servers.
---
i don't think you'll get in trouble for any of those things, i regularly make thousands of rounds of ammo and collect a lot of dirty water and hey, i'm still here!
---
which perk card?
---
Damn, you must be running a really high end rig.  
---
Fantastic photos.  Amazing.
---
I'm often afraid they will run away so I drop one thing at a time and step away from the paper bag. Then drop another and step away again. And so on.
---
It kinda feels like I'm trying to lure them somewhere... 
---
1) Probably. There's an update later today, in fact. It's a server side change with some patch notes to follow some don't know what it does. I would assume there would be a client update required for new content to be added so keep an eye for those.
---
2) You can check Bethesda's website for all anyone knows. It seems like an optional mode with fewer PVP rules.
---
3) Laser Gatling got a buff last patch and TSE is getting a nerf at some point, so they're listening to someone somewhere.... There were also changes reducing the mats required for repairs and Ballistic Fiber costs were a huge complaint here.
---
4) I don't want human NPCs. To me, the vendor bots and Rose are just as good as any human NPC babbling the same line over and over. The voice work on the holotapes and event recordings are great. I could care less if they come out of Gutsy or Piper.
---
Not sure, quick google yielded it as a misc item so unless it's a part of the main quest line it might just be vendor junk like tokens (the non mr.fuzzy kind). If you can get it to spawn try keeping it in your inventory and see what it does.
---
thanks, I've been working out! Oh, you meant the ACTUAL guns? ok... And the outfit is the BoS bomber jacket. I'm not in the Brotherhood, I just like their style...
---
Okay well wake me up in 6-8 hours and I'll get on.
---
Do you lead them to a house made of candy?  Stuff them in the over perhaps?    
---
Or do you have a mustache, yellow tinted glasses, and a beat up van?  Are you even wearing clothes under that trench coat?! 
---
Sadly it still would have been dumped on because it feels like all those dumping (especially without trying) were basically mad this wasn't Fallout 5
---
Go to nukacrypt.com
---
Cranberry relish maybe?  I can't remember.  The gourds and cranberries recipe thing? 
---
I don‚Äôt like this game and seeing other people enjoy it rustles my jimmies 
---
Can we have it so we don‚Äôt have to look at vault 76 during sign in, I would rather look at a DeathClaw‚Äôs arsehole. 
---
If it‚Äôs working as intended, the keypad is a meaningless decoration. Was that seriously intend...oh, never mind, of course it was.
---
After you've started the game, go to main menu, go into challenges and you'll find one that lists your progress to playing 7600 hours.. .I used to think it was a joke, but now I'm not sure! I'm at 413...wow
---
Hit me up if u'r up for it then i'm sure i'll be slightly further along at that point. But i'm terrible DOA UNLIMITED
---
U need adrenalin perk after 3-4 kills any ghoul one hit enven more at once because aoe
---
Not at all, i felt great since i was avoiding them for too long now i can say that 10mm gun at that hunting rifle are really battle tested as for the loot it was a heavy armor plan i guess i think its for the arm or something need to check, so it was ok for me and a shredding mini gun that i scrapped since its heavy.
---
You just saved my night 
---
That seems very high. A new PC version on Amazon UK is ¬£27. 
---
When people ask this I always wonder what you mean by playable?
---
JUST PLEASE DONT ENTER THE CODE WRONG 
---
Dead game. 
---
If someone takes all the items out of the bag and you transfer something into the bag, the item disappears. Make sure your standing directly over your bag until your done dropping.
---
I want it
---
Haha it already worked- I took my time entering it.  Night officially saved.
---
I don't have a mic unfortunately so it wasn't me. Really cool thing to do for the lower level players though. Thanks on behalf of all of us üòä
---
They‚Äôre nerfing tses instead of fixingthe game, what do you mean.
---
Yeah they can and they can do it legit too without even bobble head stacking. Just need the right combination of perks, mutations and weapons. A bloody build is the best for it. Granted not as easy as a TSE build but initially those weapons were much harder to get.
---
I agree, but the choice is there.  You don‚Äôt have to take it.
---
I have a screenshot of some of the items here:
---
https://reddit.app.link/0wb0mPVORT
---
The ones that weren't shown were 400 ballistic fibre, 300 oil, 2700 concrete and 300 lead.
---
How many caps are you paying per rocket and mini nukes?
---
Because the loot they drop is generally very disappointing, and hardly even worth the ammo or time to waste on them. But yeah I guess the first time you beat one is rewarding in itself, but I know for a lot of people after such an epic fight and get practically nothing from it, it's a major disappointment and anticlimax.
---
Yes happens most commonly on Scorchbeasts with explosive Shotguns.
---
It's definitely not based on 17 year old code. It wouldn't make sense for them to drag code across two different games that work very differently, each would have it's old branch of code.
---
And honestly, I have to know your level of knowledge before I could honestly talk to you about this, I'm guessing you're just a gaming enthusiast at best, not technology savvy in a big way. The reason- it doesn't work the way you said. The game engine handles certain things, how it handles those things can be wildly and drastically changed to the point it's a new engine.
---
A simpler example would be to talk about Samsung phones, which have always run with touchwiz. We're on the 8th or higher version of that brand of phone, and there's multiple kinds of phone they manufacture.
---
The reason that example is great is because those phones have worked on different operating systems (just like each Bethesda game, different processors too), then there's different phone's too(much like how different elder scrolls would be compared to fallout).
---
The main idea is that you want the FEEL to be the same across devices, just like they want the feel to be the same across games.. they want it to feel like Samsung, or in this case fallout.
---
It would cost far more money to make ancient code work on newer technology, newer operating systems, etc.. They branched off of an older game engine that ran marrowind, and essentially everything has changed to the point it's a new engine. You can see a lot more here [that's been updated somewhat recently.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Engine) The biggest issue is we lack sources- they keep most of this information closely guarded.
---
The only thing it talks about that's a remanent of the original engine was how it handles quests.
---
Shit, this may be a better example, I saw an old mustang that had a late model [Corvette motor installed in it](https://youtu.be/fpZ5B_mdyC8).. at what point is this Frankenstein thing no longer going to be a mustang?
---
It's really hard to explain other than to say that everyone I see talk about it completely oversimplifies it.. This engine *is a new engine* as much as it's had to be customized. What is left that is old code is probably to maintain the physics and small details that makes it feel like fallout.
---
Unfortunately this tileset was a limited time offer and can no longer be purchased :/
---
yep, that one of the reasons why i avoided them for so long, as i read it before these were the case. just felt great when i saw a plan as loot.
---
Everybody st least has 8+ of these. Good luck
---
Lmao so dramatic. You're running around with all of your junk doing events and you're gonna blame the game for losing it? Really? That's not even a bug. It even warns you to gtfo. 
---
The photos are a bit dark but from what I see it looks amazing! Hope you are on xbox lol
---
Should just be an option for us on consoles. Let's us use the 3rd person PA Hud in 1st person. 
---
Oh yeah I got an Ultracite Vent once. Something that drops a lot of the time from the SBQ. That is the only plan I have ever seen from a Scorchbeast.
---
Lmao I forgot I replied to this.  You can get them on LFG dirt cheap.  They‚Äôre everywhere.
---
Worth a shot 
---
huting rifle has good range but its bolt action, guass has the best damage but poor range and is finicky in VATS and lever action is about in the middle of these
---
Nah, I understand words just fine. I started a new character and gave that character all my gear. Eventually I wanted to try my old melee build again. You do know there's weapons in the world? Like.. dozens and dozens of places where there will always be a weapon?
---
Well, I went and grabbed a few weapons from places I know there always is one. It's not hard, it's not rocket science. Go on, if you really don't know where you can get weapons at your level, ask and you shall receive.
---
But I'm not sure you understand words. Or maybe you're just not very bright, and that's why there's so many people trying to explain how unnecessary all your words are.
---
F
---
I am so sad now.
---
Your on ps4? Is there any mods that increase the rad damage?
---
Grahm sold me powered gates for less than 200 caps last night. Granted I have Charisma over 15 and hard bargain 3, but it cane be more than 300 caps.
---
They fixed this in the last patch according to patch notes.
---
Ohhhh, I love it. Also same, I'm 250 hours in and have no clue how to begin to launch a nuke 
---
So, this confirms a feeling I have had.   You could theoretically put down some defensive walls + traps to replace turrets and save a bit of storage.
---
Thanks I think I might give it another go after I see today‚Äôs update 
---
Which reminds me: never use PA but carry the chassis with no pieces on around with me in case I need to jump off a cliff. Had reason to do that recently and got it out. It had a full set of level 50 Raider pieces on. I have no idea how! 
---
Lol she respawned and you're still carrying on like they killed your dog irl. Why are so many people in this sub so dramatic. 
---
*solved* 
---
The problem is solved it wad not the game not the Firewall not a driver not anything that i would have thought at 
---
It was my 1y old SSD .... I had access to it could read copy paste but apparently it had some errors... I downloaded fo76 again to an other drive deleted all the fo76 files on my SSD and got some reading errors while booting and now fo76 works fine again from my hdd ü§∑üèº 
---
Thanks for the advices anyways i tried them all (:
---
When they're probably the most common plan in the game and don't even function at all in game yet I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
What level are you?
---
Not yet but hopefully with the upcoming patch they will fix availability  of several hard to find plans.
---
Ok I see you have added food as 0.33%. I guessed they would be on the low end but they do take up quite a bit of budget then. Thanks.
---
Same.  Bad tonight.....
---
...fuck. That sounds fantastic.
---
It's a good feeling when you down your first one. I didn't realize how far I'd come until I was in a SBQ fight and just killed a regular scorched beast because it was a minor nuisance. It just landed nearby and I shredded it and went back to the queen as if it was just a blood bug.
---
People coming into your house just to kill your virtual pet is douchey... hiding in your basement so they can see your reaction to your dead virtual pet is even more douchey....... that is the point of the post. 
---
though if my Shakespearean levels of dramatic retelling doesn‚Äôt do it for you idk what to tell you 
---
Her spoopy ghost made them.
---
Damn too bad. Thought there is a some kind of ini setting or so ;)
---
I know I've been playing Fallout 76 too much when I recognized nearly all those locations.
---
Indeed. And also a way to reports CAMPs without revealing the owner. Unfortunately, all you have is the Bethesda website.
---
inb4 this subreddit tries to start the claims of witch hunting and bleating other random crap. Just ignore them. ;)
---
Get over it you got killed. Stay alert
---
thank you... i too am still grieving 
---
she‚Äôs lumbering ominously in heaven now 
---
I haven't tried it with a 100% completely destroyed camp, but it has worked with a partially destroyed camp.
---
But worst case scenario is you are out a few caps, best case is you don't need to spend flux fixing everything.
---
I'll happily spend caps over flux.  I'll try it next time my spot gets razed.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
+karma
---
I played 11 hours yesterday in one sitting.
---
They tried extremely hard to not allow griefing. So they ended up making griefing worse.
---
wait so you didn‚Äôt even let her play on your Pc until after christmas, after you made room, etc? That‚Äôs a horrible story with a happy ending.  
---
I think Chloe is the Nanny who thinks you're the child she cares after.
---
More outfits in general would be a good idea.
---
on the radium? No ways to directly increase them but you could use a hair trigegr or auto receiver to lay down more in a a shorter period of time
---
I  hope they also fix the problem behind the TSE issue, stacking Explosive Bobbleheads.
---
i think its time to realize that making a BnB in whitesprings wasn't the best idea after all.
---
Use the contractor perk for cheaper repairs.
---
I'm not trying to be contrary to your point but this is actually a great event to do. Done right you get 40 claim tokens each time it pops up which can be used to buy all sorts of goodies from the machines outside.
---
I do this event every time it pops up for me. 
---
All bad reviews are rubber skin synths
---
lol it literally gives you time to gtfo after saying..... gtfo
---
wow
---
Hey mate, you still have this weapon and are willing to sell/trade it? 
---
Or, if it's posted hourly, just downvote it and move on. I haven't seen this suggestion yet, but I'm also not on reddit constantly.
---
Yeah its really unplayable gg on losing my daily camden tokens.
---
Its the one about energy weapons, expert something. It says it will make energy weapons cheaper to craft but it applies to others, at least handmade and radium I checked, thus at least all ballistic. "Launchers" and "heavy" are separate categories but it might apply to them as well.
---
hahaha, that is a sweet, sweet irony to find that out now!
---
Thank god there are still decent players!
---
Honestly im thinking slowly of a camp build mainly from turrets and workstations. 
---
Agreed, the patching should be done during their normal "core" hours.
---
Is she not hostile towards you? If not, man there's so much I haven't seen in this game!
---
Yet, the company itself has to pay those developers/admins.  So the timing needs to be based around the actual people working on the game, not people playing the game.
---
Yeah, Unplayable at the moment. 'server not responding' continuously.
---
I had one where an eyebot was leading a line of radrats while playing some tunes. It was so strange. 
---
It's (unofficially) an MMO. Live to win:
---
https://youtu.be/dAxZVZgpmI0
---
crashed &amp; rolled back lately. them dupers are going all the way before the patch 
---
I have no problem with being killed normally. This guy had a bounty of 1.2k and then a few minutes later one for 3.3k.
---
He was killing anyone who went to whitespring station, regardless of if they hit him, one shot.
---
This was not legitimate, and cheaters need to be reported. 
---
Fire Breather - or at least flame design - paints for weapons, please. A FB/flame design on my Hunting Rifle would finish my look off so well. &lt;3
---
It's about ¬£8 on CDKeys :-)
---
Dude u are awesome lol good work 
---
At what point did I blame the game? Not once did I say "This is the games fault". It was merely venting and helping others not make the same mistake I did. gtfo and take your high horse with you.
---
Well, ¬£7.79 
---
Dido
---
As I explained, I was overencumbered and overrun with miners. I didn't want to drop stuff because I would've died by the miners lol. I just got myself into a shit situation. Trying to help others not do the same.
---
I always put the irish accented girl in the Grognak Outfit and Axe.   The girl from the War place?  Forgot her name.  I think she was redhead.  Anyway, was much more enjoyable.  Giving her guns tended to make her get in my way, but melee allowed her to slow down the mobs while I angle for some shots.  Plus she looked rather nice!
---
Great advice, and I do use Contractor.
---
I know I'm fighting an uphill battle, but my camp isn't actually in Whitesprings, so there's no reason to destroy it out-of-hand because it's far enough away to always be out of the blast and never aggro glowing ghouls.  It's basically a triangle if you used Blackwater Mine, Whitesprings Station and my camp, with my camp as the tip of the arrow, it would point almost directly north.  Well out of a blast, but visible and convenient for travelers to repair, make and store stable flux and use my crops to cook some food.  It also makes porting to Uranium Fever very convenient and free for myself and my team-mates.
---
one time, a random dude at munition factory send me a party invite. I saw him at the factory, so I figured he wanted to give it to me. I accepted and there were two others in that team.
---
WoW, they visited my base. I was then removed from the team... They blew up my base and killed eachother to remove bounty.
---
Morale of the story, accepting random invites is not always the best idea, eventhough some people have good intentions.
---
Rest of the story if ur interested...
---
I screen shotted the map when i saw them pay me an unexpected visit and I had two of their bases on the capture. i called my friend, and i gave them both a nice visit with my buddy and we did the same thing.
---
Oh and i also must add that one of them had a pet deathclaw... i hate killing pets, but dude... this was an exception and it got ugly. 
---
40?! Holy hell. I got 5. Does it usually last longer than 5 minutes and I was just late? What are the rewards you could get from the machine? I might do it, if its worth it and I stash all my shit first
---
One of you need to use the broadsider + cannon balls as well!   You are pirates right?
---
Fuck your Jimmies and fuck your mother 
---
I had that too once. Every ghoul dropped  legendary items,  even when the ghoul wasnt legendary
---
So you say there is one holotape that is not marked on map, available only when you nuke something else than fissure? What's the name of that holotape? Does it allow to finish Overseer quest or it still open?
---
make sure the materials are in your box not on you it's a new glitch
---
Happened to me on PC as well. Wasn't quiet every enemy, but probably more than 50%
---
I'll trade you 8 Ultracite Rusty Knuckles plans for it. At least my carry weight will go down 1.75 lbs in the trade. :) Really though, that's one of the most common plans in FO76. I could wallpaper my CAMP with all the ones I've dropped.
---
and lvl 45 is the highest for that gun even if you are 50
---
Whoo hoo!
---
would of been nicer if they were half decent and not things like a mutants wooden arm XD
---
its a glitch i encounter same think just in another scenario 
---
RIP. That blows. When I spawned back in, it made me choose a spot that was 16 caps away with travel agent. It wasnt even in the same fucking region haha
---
Okay can someone explain to me how this works?  
---
I always thought you needed the code word from the Enclave bunker to decypher the code pieces. Every time I'm in the bunker mid-week or so there are barely enough letters visible to maybe guess the word with any luck.  
---
I'd really like to know how they do this exactly.
---
Players like blowing up bases lol and the higher level players like to troll those who put the shower outside, knowing that it would be a pain in the ass to fix.
---
Btw, just today, my friends base got attacked. Not fully destroyed or anything like that. The griefer only broke the shower lol. My friend was so angry and worked up, esp because the guy server hopped b4 we could kill him.
---
Thank you! Good to gear im not goin totally crazy 
---
They gave me a explosive double barrel shotgun once 
---
The only thing that didnt drop a legendary was the wendigo, but, you know, loose screws were better than any of the legendaries i picked up
---
And i watoga a protectron gave me a Two shot gatling gun so i have been lucky twice
---
Yes you can tame pets
---
I honestly hope we don't see human NPC's. It's an unpopular opinion but it is what it is. The story telling as-is is a unique experience and I've really enjoyed it. I don't see how human shaped NPC's are all that different from terminals/bots. It's not like you're gonna be able to make friends with and marry them like other games. It's not that type of game and it never pretended to be. 
---
Maybe you're just emotionally flaccid. :0
---
Question. Does it run and attack those scorched who have better range on their pipe pistols than my goddamn sniper rifle? Or just ignore 
---
Admitting you have a problem is the first step...
---
Amazing!
---
Thank you for this.
---
I am sure many wanted to know the relative cost of each item in our CAMPS
---
One of my most wanted features. If they don't do this eventually they pretty much made the charisma tree worthless to 75 percent of players
---
True true.
---
I wonder if its possible to tame a Scorched Beast?
---
Oh. Ok. Couldn't have been me. I don't actually raid camps myself because I still have amusing stuff to do, I just express my gratitude towards people that destroy the turret camps at the Whitesprings.
---
Whenever I have a few pieces of random low level legendary gear I search for people on the map with corresponding levels.
---
More often it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs second account but there are those times where it‚Äôs someone who needed it.
---
I‚Äôm full melee build to so I‚Äôm constantly overstocked on ammo that I hand out to others whenever I get a chance
---
I own two exterminator‚Äôs explosive Gatlings and they made the game fun again
---
Ye, would've assumed so, sorry üôè 
---
You can find it cheap as a code on third party sites. You can even do the tricentennial for almost the same price! If you‚Äôd like I can post links for some really affordable ones? Lmk
---
So how you get more tokens is by keeping the mining bots "alive" (alive as any robot can be) Every few minutes of them "mining materials" they award you claim tokens for defending them. It's been a few days since I've done it but I think it's 3 tokens each time. With a perfect run rewarding you 10 times.
---
 On event completion you should be awarded another 10 tokens if I remember correctly. As for what you can spend with them I mostly buy the apparel from the machines but I think you can get junk items from the cheaper payout options. (Don't quote me on that) 
---
Overall you get some cool stuff like a Mr.Fuzzy mining helmet which looking pretty F***king snazzy if you ask me.
---
They need to give us the plans for trailer walls etc 
---
Still open, I'm guessing for DLCs
---
\*distant noise\* Country roads take me home to the place where i ..........
---
There is always the thrill if you, for example, target ghouls which run up to you while the framerate tanks for just few hundred milliseconds, so you 1-shot yourself as the goul is in your face after the hiccup. And you are in PA so dense armor doesn't work.
---
Interesting idea for private servers. It‚Äôd be like RUST and other games where you see random buildings everywhere. It‚Äôd need to reset every once in a while though for balance and real estate fairness though or else staleness would occur
---
There's too many people. I still farm there but it's without a nuke. I remember being able to show up and be the only one there m Those were the days 
---
Or...do this event, but stash your loot first and don't be over-encumbered all the time.
---
Just maybe.
---
I get annoyed that the Bethesda launcher doesn't log hours so I dunno how long I've played but 300 hours is a serious figure! I bought Fallout 4 + DLC  in late 2017 - early 2018 and I "only" have 266 hours on there!
---
I just wanna talk about how she travelled all over Appalachia and had so many adventures then was just like‚Äù I was shot by a mole miner and now I‚Äôm dead‚Äù
---
How does one acquire such high frequency of items legitimately?
---
I'll try next time I play. Thanks for the research! 
---
This is a fallacy bmpopular between the people who like things given to them on a plate.
---
Have you found the skeleton catapult?
---
Have you tried recreating the skeleton with other players?
---
Have you found the way how to catapult live players across considerable distances?
---
Because if not, get in there and start crafting you own fun.
---
I think you should seek professional counseling.
---
I prefer both to being nerfed.     TS was also OP.   They added +100% dmg as well.
---
3\* rolling pins FTW death claws beware.
---
if you want scraping and get new mods , go for lowest level 
---
I had this encounter at level 15, near the Uncanny Caverns one of the funniest moment in the game !
---
I suppose they aren't doing it because app and server latency would stack and probably make it even slower or the same to use as the in game Pip-Boy and/or create potential item disappearance or duplication glitches/exploits.
---
No ones begging anything to be easier. I want things fair and having a good experience while we're at it isn't so bad. But you're very angry and not terribly smart so you lash out at people who have a different opinion or thought process.
---
They'll likely ask for proof or something, but I'm providing that to Bethesda already, screenshots and video showing it. 
---
I'm not going to show others the proof, because it includes the username and such.
---
Agree whole heartedly re. repair costs
---
Regarding damaged crops: instead of repairing - you can scrap the damaged crops (you get crop+fertilizer) and then replant them.
---
You actually helped me out, think you are on my friends list now.
---
Been killing a few of those at the golf club, glowing ones, lots of meat, leather and I think glue or something, nothing else of note.
---
I can‚Äôt find a decent high level one. So now I have a lvl 14 snally defending my camp vs lvl 40 toads :S
---
No way!  When and what's your tag if you don't mind my asking?
---
I mean, I guess if you want me to downvote it I will. It is a very constant suggestion though. Right up there with increasing stash size. 
---
Oh. My god. I know what my new goal is. Thanks!
---
One word answer? Bethesda.
---
Usually high level deathclaw in the mine at the bottom of the map south south west. 
---
Trading is the best way to do it my man, just have him trade them to you for 0 cost.  I dropped a chameleon chest armor on the floor for my buddy to mod and it dropped right through the bottom of the camp never to be seen again
---
I REALLY need to bump into you out there at some point then! My shooting is terrible so I go through so much ammo. Maybe might be a good idea to switch back to melee.
---
what time zone are you in?
---
I wish there was someone like you out there when I first started out. 
---
Move and place you camp a few times, save the excess showers for free 
---
So do you reload them all or just use one shot from each and swap to a fresh pistol like some kind of pirate? üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è 
---
I know the feeling. But it surprises me as it's always higher levels who are picking me off, but what do they get from it?
---
Your opinions = farts on the wind
---
No worries man, I shall accept as soon as!!
---
Idk about a week or two ago, havent had much time to play recently with work, I'll hut you up if I see you online my name has chaos in it.
---
Wish the Enclave Mask could have hats over it. Would look menacing with the Enclave Officer cap. 
---
RNG at its finest.. smh
---
I don't fully disagree, but a 75% nerf without any mechanical changes to the aiming feature is **far** too much. Several other primary legendary affixes do much more. Several do less, and those should also be buffed, mutants for example, a flat 10% damage increase if you have mutations is pretty shit. I think 40%-50% would be pretty balanced. 
---
That being said, ultimately the only thing that made TS OP was the fact that it applies explosion twice. That's still going to be the case. Explosion still needs nerfed more imo and TS should not be nerfed so hard.
---
If TS has no negative accuracy effect in post nerf, then 25% is fine.
---
My shower is inside.  My camp is a 3x5 base with the middle hollow for a small interior garden/purifier space, surrounded by crafting stations, a lounge area, 3 upstairs bedrooms and a patio area with a tented music studio.  In my opinion, it's very nice and clearly painstakingly crafted.
---
I'm around lvl 150 with a min/max sniper build, 350+ defense and a TSE rifle that does 1000+ damage.  I have no problem defending my home if I see an alert, but I've only had the opportunity to utterly smash a griefer once.
---
Yeah that could have been me.  It also could have been the other bud that got me doing this.
---
Think op means the soldier in the armor who witnessed the blast and who‚Äôs armor is in the cinematic trailer as being baked into the ground with dwellers walk-in past it to the tune of Country Roads
---
keep this in mind:
---
\- It has to be a Random Encounter not a set spawn or part of an event
---
\- It has to spawn alone
---
\- You need twice the level of what you want to tame
---
\- You need 6 charisma(im not entirely sure if this is correct) and have animal friend at level 3 equipped
---
Thought that was a type *shot = got*  now realise you actually *shot* the ghoul, weird.
---
Its litterally piece of crap fresh out of bulls ass, based completely on the fake news bobble surrounding the game, with no foundation in reality.
---
Yes, but it doesn't actually give me the component listed in yellow when I scrap the item...
---
Yes I absolutely do this, because porting around the map replacing a broad variety of crops is nonsense.  It's tedious if you have a dozen or so crops and get that bug where you scrap a crop and the ground remains marked as if occupied.
---
I'm talking about scrapping at a crafting station, not building in a workshop...
---
And the class freak bugs with Barbarian and Evasive. 
---
Make sure you‚Äôre holding all of the materials. Game either pulls from your personal inv or from the stash. It won‚Äôt split the difference even for one of many required items
---
Diseased enemies can also be legendary but it doesn't say it.
---
It's a really popular farming spot, especially after a nuke. Many people drop their excess legendaries in the ice chest there too.
---
It really is a good feeling to take down your first SB, I did mine yesterday and it felt good üòä
---
I do the same and am trying to understand it myself...animals see me but Wendigos don‚Äôt even if they basically step on my toes. Lol 
---
next DLC you meant ? Because next Fallout isn't coming till 2027 at least :)
---
PvP. 
---
I‚Äôll be waiting ;)
---
I'm having a similar problem with my camp. I have 89% stored with zero items actually stored. It started out as 20% and over time it grew to 89% with every attempt at fixing it. I feel like it's a result of animal taming. I deleted everything and that only made it wrose. I was able to kill the pet i had and that freed up the 11% and thats all I've been able to fix. Everything else just makes the problem worse. I did the same thing by clearing out my stash and dtopping everything, Ive tried moving camp several times.  Ive honestly just about given up and just accepted that I'll never have a base again. Have you had any luck with this problem? I'm desperate. 
---
Excellent work! Gotta say I am concerned about that phantom budget glitch, I don't know if I have any, but I don't want to move my carefully built camp just to find out...
---
Thanks for answering. At leastsome thought should be put ito it.
---
Keep up the good work.
---
You been living under a rock?
---
Higher agility increases your sneak
---
As do the sneak perks (obviously)
---
Armor weight has no bearing. Movement does affect enemy detection unless you get the perk that lets you sneak "run"
---
Fyi, shadowed only works in low light
---
Full daylight, it offers zero benefits
---
I kinda assumed that since she seems to have gotten to all the places you eventually go to, that the Overseer is considered at least as badass as you are. She probably just popped a few stims and went on her way.  
---
I'm still hoping she'll pop up in a DLC. I'm kinda sick of every person I'm looking for in Appalachia turning up dead.
---
And walk my wife and fuck my dog!
---
Agreed doesn‚Äôt matter what level to learn the mods 
---
Worst night I've had yet on PC.   
---
First server gave me a DC immediately after saying the CAMP couldn't be placed.   
---
Second-hop-third seemed okay until I took a break. The second had a Whitespring nuke and did seem a bit slow.  
---
Now its back to craziness. Mostly noticing delayed actions randomly...like no problem killing a few then one is delayed back to norm. 
---
yeah i always do that, saves me carting them around. That will explain it then, i think every ghoul was diseased TBH. still, surely it shouldn't have been all of them?
---
Came to say this. Best cross purpose perk.
---
RIP. Killed by Bethesda
---
Increase base cost by 225, to 250 caps. This increases by 100 caps per hour. In a PVE mode, players could purchase the workshop from the owner, so that it's balanced, and the owner doesn't really lose anything if someone buys it from them.
---
The hardest part about that is finding a random animal that's half my level. All the random deathclaws I've seen recently are level 91 (I'm not even level 70). But I definitely need this, so I'll find something eventually. üòä
---
Oh- yeah that‚Äôs bull.
---
If you are using VATS sniping then I think the black dragon, does massive alpha damage.
---
Try putting [PS4] in caps?
---
Really?  That's interesting.  So I could be wearing super heavy armor and still sneak just as well?  Doesn't seem sensible but I'll take it!
---
Uppercase the PS in PS4. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why it was letting me post either and as soon as I made the XB in XB1 all caps it worked. Hope this helps!
---
Also put your psn in the info bit not the title
---
[PS4] H: Two shot explosive 50cal W: Chem or mutation recipes
---
Offering caps or trade
---
Post what you are offering with your price below
---
And i just barely finished my camp!
---
Because of this pile of trash, good job
---
Why does the thumbnail say "wedding ring" when there are multiple spots to get them?
---
Lots and lots of trial and error/time and patience
---
It'll be the Gauss rifle. I have all the rifleman perks, 1\* bloody mess, tank killer and tormentor all on and my gauss rifles damage was showing at 235. Level action shows as 141, my 50cal sniper rifle was 121 but the damage would go up changing the receiver back to .308 to 124.
---
I have three heavy and two sturdy
---
No issues being seen if I sneak (and stay out of obvious cone of sight
---
Yep, I've had it happen with no PA on PS4 - but oddly, only during SBQ fights.
---
Agreed. I have a sniper build and a two shot gauss rifle is op. Mine has two mods and goes to 390 damage. And ammo is easy af to craft. My weapon of choice.
---
Trash? :D F76was  still less bugged on launch than New Vegas. But the difference is Obsidian grab the cash and left their broken game to moddders to repair and Bethesda is fixing F76 on DAILY basis ;)
---
Exellent depiction of r/fallout, and all the commenters at the bottom of the page.
---
iv tried stacking chems..it doesnt work..using a chem cancels the previous chem..i know bobbleheads stack though..which bethesds should fix..  a guy i teamed up with stacked a few hundred bobbleheads and his attack dmg went to 70k or some ridiculous number.
---
And the Understatement of The Year award goes to... :P
---
This will be the next thing I measure!
---
i seem to have 18 holotapes but theres supposed to only be 17? also the quest is still active in my pipboy..is there more to this quest or bugged? like kill a wendigo in a clown suit i did twice but its still an active quest
---
Nope people who attacked my crew and me and decided to spam revenge but couldn't win as always 
---
I found a bunch around Watoga, aside from the plan or weapon showing up at the vendors, there‚Äôs a couple spots. Got two at different chests on the rooftops and one from the little unmarked brotherhood camp immediately south east of the train station vendor, all within a day of each other. 
---
Actually found a bunch or rarer items in those spots semi regularly, so now I include them whenever I swing through the area 
---
Green country lodge gym, Charleston fire department gym, Grafton steel + ammosmith + super duper = unnecessary ammo amounts.
---
I might have -4 Charisma, but HI IM FACESMASHER ME LUV PONIES U WANT DRINK TAKE DRINK OR DIE. 
---
Omg, your username is so cute!
---
Oh ffs stop getting your news from Youtubers
---
i was getting like 10 bluescreens every hour..took mu targeting hud of my excavator helmet..no more bluescreens...well i mean no more than is the norn..like i still.get a blue screen once every few hours.
---
easy..get the recipe and then craft them..i crafted 10 marsupial serums today..
---
What happened when over building areas in fallout 4? Probably just overcompensating for the possibility of camps being closer together causing stability issues
---
I think it‚Äôs a shared item pool per server though. I‚Äôve seen the vendors around white springs get flooded with trash legendaries after a bunch of high levels farmed ghouls there. It would suck to see a plan you‚Äôve been searching for only for it to disappear because someone else grabbed it first.
---
People keep asking for factions in the game, or more defined classes. Being able to have a "race" as such would add to this game immeasurably. Imagine being able to also either become an intelligent ghoul or have your brain transferred into a more svelte Robobrain carcass? You'd have your four "races" right there and allow for much more lore and roleplay ability.  
---
Lot of work though.
---
yeh i bought the toy box stash box..used it once and now its not in my stash box list anymore
---
I play it most days. Hope that helps.
---
The reload is insane tho and it breaks quite fast.
---
I might have some of those mods, poke me tomorrow and I can try to help
---
OP! What platform are you on? Id pay 8k caps for one of these!
---
think he wants the actual recipe to craft his own?
---
On ps4, sorry
---
I've taken to establishing multiple small units rather than one large building due to this frustrating issue. A small cabin with a bed and some furniture, a workshed for my crafting tables and a little bar for socializing. I haven't had any problems relocating since.
---
Especially that one
---
Not a single decent content video. All they do is whine and glitch shit
---
I honestly really want to kill your deathclaw now
---
yes i put my psn in the info..
---
yeh my bad..i actually did put it in upper case
---
I'm going to quit my job and start a YouTube channel that is nothing but me yelling at a camera about video games I don't like. Even though I spend many hours a day playing them I'll tell everyone it's literally unplayable. I'll just regurgitate the same shit I read on Reddit and act like it's my own original thoughts. Because I see a handful of people complaining about something I'll title my videos "Bethesda fans revolt!" I'll grow a

Won't you get Katya back when you relog? My megasloth comes back to haunt me everytime, there's no way for me to exorcise it.

FOH with that clickbait. Think for yourself.

thnx i will try again

thnx i will try that

That‚Äôs if they‚Äôre not shilling real world trading sites with their discount codes....

Use a Gatling Gun. Martial Artist 3, One Gun Army 3, Tenderizer 3. 
---
prime reciever + 2shot explosive
---
i think cal 50 is the best.
---
i think killing sbq fast, is not a good idea because we missed a lot of loot from spawning creatures around
---
Bethesda weren't exactly nice to Obsidian either. New Vegas was one point off 85 on Metacritic when it came out so Bethesda didn't give them any royalty bonus on the game, reportedly leading to layoffs. Pretty funny considering how many people think it's the best Fallout. 
---
Stacking multiple buffs, chems being one of many in that list

Post says he wants a TSE + caps to buy the recipe as a trade off

Yarp... &lt;.&lt;

I saw a bunch of people "PvP"ing tonight and I see they've all come to downvote this.  I bathe in your cauliflower downpour.
---
Roll over and spread them cheeks and show me your *pleasant valley*
---
No, you can't scrap to learn Scout Armor mods. The only way is to buy the actual mod. And yes, Ultra-Light does exists.
---
I understand what you're saying but not everyone *wants* to have to make their own fun, especially not when they've probably got other games they could be playing that they haven't finished. 
---
How much for the ts gatling plasma
---
I've never actually launched a nuke and I wonder something. Doesn't it take the enjoyment out when the cores are all spelled out for you or is collecting them more tedious and not enjoyable in the first place?
---
I found it by scrapping one.  Seems most gatling gun plans are super rare.  I'd suggest finding 2-4 spots that have one and server hopping.  I remember Whitesprings Watchtower had one.
---
Platform? And u mean the one with more rate of fire?
---
Did you copy paste me exactly? &lt;.&lt;
---
I saw you get removed again
---
That's hilarious. "Weapon durability's getting low; better shoot myself." XD
---
That‚Äôs beautiful!
---
Do you find this to be the case in-game? When choosing a rifle, I just want to make sure there aren't some other factors that come in play you know, like range decreasing damage or something like that.
---
I should have been more specific in the OP, I'm looking for a long range sniper rifle that has the biggest bunch (except black powder).
---
Because I like novelty, and annoying people who can't adapt to change :p
---
Used this to nuke the Fissure site to get main quest done and summoned the scorchbeast queen without realizing.  
---
Tried to help but wouldn't even budge her health bar at level 32 without power attack powerarmor assisted super sledge attackes.  
---
We burnt her down to her last health bar before the servers DC'd us. Never been more pissed off with a game, but oh well.
---
Please link the entire thread to the devs. There are alot of great suggestions and adjustments in the conversation.
---
This YouTuber is making his living these days by making daily videos about this game and every day talking about how he doesn‚Äôt like it. He is not a source of news. 
---
I had a random encounter with a Mr Handy that needed help escorting some cats to a nearby farm. I tried to help but the cats were meandering around and going so slow I eventually gave up. I wonder what the reward was??????
---
So you're saying they farm 300 keycards, do the silo and just try all of the possiblities to scramble an 8 digit code?
---
The OP is level 20 and won't have a maxed starched genes until level 31 at the earliest.
---
You let SBs into your house? Lolz
---
Screenshots are on imgur same account name that's on here
---
Still not unbelievable. Seems like he might've been transferring a stash. 
---
the range is brilliant on the gauss and the lever action. think my 50cal was about 207 and the other 2 are better than that i think.
---
range will always decrease damage once you start going over the weapons range spec but if you're sniping, most of the time you'll be sneaking and getting hella damage anyway.
---
I think the biggest factor would be accuracy. two shot sniper rifles IMO are a bit of a pain. the accuracy of my two shot gauss is less than my combat shotgun lol.
---
Do You consider Your teacher not nice when You are short one point to higher mark or maybe is it Your fault ? :)
---
NV has really nice story and characters but the world is super boring and generic, it shows how superior Bethesda is in taht aspect and how well they feel Fallout world
---
See the comments on the video? Reality. But here. Shill and fanboi central.

This is a reference to the Pied Piper of Hamelin. An old fairy tale.

Honestly the best starter for a new player is a PA frame and a board with nails in it. With that you can one-shot anything in the forest. You can also survive the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap at level 1 if you are careful and don't engage to many enemies.
---
Yeah I saw her.. Rachel handy asking for a scoped weapon in savage divide.
---
I had one on, and displayed..ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Probably should of added that its mainly in VATS that you experience this but sniper builds usually always have time to line up shots instead of using VATS
---
geez..yeh i did exactly what you said for title.it says info is optional..did my post go up and then get removed straight away?
---
I do this too..
---
I‚Äôll drop plans, recipes, junk mats,  and lvl5 and 10 gear outside v76 for the lowbies.
---
It helps w/stash mgmt, and weight.
---
Plus it‚Äôs free to travel to v76
---
ohh
---
I kind of switch between a hunting rifle (hardened) and a lever action because in low level areas, they are one shot, one kill mostly, and things you kill drop your ammo. You actually end up getting more ammo than you use sometimes.
---
How did you take these pictures? I am on console and always wondered how to get pictures like this to my computer
---
I once had a Ms. Nanny request that I listen to her story. I sat down and obliged the request. Once she was done reciting Goldilocks and the three Bears I got a buff and some fancy lad snacks.

It was nice to have a wholesome moment in the wastelands of WV. 
---
Throw a grenade just a meter in front of you and backtrack while shooting. If you have any points into demolition expert doing a 180 followed by a short sprint might be prudent, just to make sure you're not in the blast radius.
---
Eventually you'll be able to predict when you're about to get swarmed and can lead the mobs into your grenade blast. 
---
I wish you could use spoiled meat and veggies to  terraform rocky scrub growth to farm land.

I got the plan from Graham. I've seen it on him a couple times. Happy hunting. 
---
200+ hours of enjoyment for me. I call that money well spent regardless of continued rumours of it flopping. If nothing more comes of it I can move on to the next game that interests me. 
---
Got some issues with posting here, doesnt even show my post on fo76
---
Somebody stole my sweetroll. I don‚Äôt know who and I don‚Äôt know why, but I think they duped it, ‚Äòcause I keep finding them left around the map in coolers. If that‚Äôs not griefing I don‚Äôt know what is. 
---
Same on PS4. I've started just letting the game sit for a minute when I first load in. 
---
Youtubers that rely on Bethesda hate train popularity will spread totally biased agender based "info" 
---
Martial Artist increases swing rate for melee weapons...it makes no mention on perk card of firing rate.  
---
I've never herd of the Perk loadout mgr, I'll need to look into that. 
---
No you
---
Haven't launched the game in weeks.
---
I encountered that bug as well, it said I had all the materials but it was still grayed out. Try moving anything from you inventory into your stash, this worked for me!
---
Thats what it meant to be underneath
---
It would be nice if stats on weapons would include all the bonuses from buffs and perks and show critical strike damage and critical strike chance.
---
Mine has lived in my stores tab 99% of the time I've had it.  I'm less worried about other players(who will destroy it if they want) and more about the super mutants my turrets completely ignore.
---
Me too, weird coincidence! Happy 76th hour AND day, kind sir!
---
They made an 84 Metacritic game (and arguably the best in the series) in 18 months because that's all Bethesda let them have. I'd love to see what monumental pile of shit BGS would come out with if they only had a year and a half. How well they feel the Fallout world? Obsidian is comprised of people who created the original fallout so I'm pretty sure they "feel" it better than anyone. Also the city of New Vegas makes D.C. from Fallout 3 looks bland as fuck (because it kind of is) and there's plenty of places around New Vegas that are pretty interesting too. I don't really understand why the Capital Wasteland is so much more interesting to you than the Mojave Wasteland. As far as I'm concerned they're both extremely bland but at least New Vegas has the city and more compelling quests. 
---
Ahhh, it's a filthy liar
---
Info is not optional 
---
You're getting wiped for "indiscriptive body text"

My text below the dot was for your "info" section

Please stop getting news from Youtube, these shitty Youtubers just use the Bethesda hate train to gain more clicks, don't trust them at all.
---
I dumped my turret from my camp because it does f**k-all and works only when it wants to.
---
 This was my Jenny Jones at level 26 or so in Leather Armor. She was pretty stealthy. 
---
 My present guy is going BOS and waiting to go there. He has focused on non Power Armor and can fight a Scorchy without taking any real damage if he avoids the gas strafes. He's been taking em' down a lot lately at level 45. ;)
---
And I am absolutely fine with people having other games to play, but a game that would allowed me to similarily be dodging around its restrictions (i.e. how you build things that didn't want to snap there in first place) and to craft my fun similarily ceased to have any playerbase I could relate to around ten years ago, and my hunger for this kind of fun has been insatiated in this whole period.
---
Not everyone wanted an online Fallout experience. The truth is I'm simply forced not to give a fuck about everyone as they seem to be wanting this thing that I have waited a decade for to be changed, made easy, or completely removed.
---
Fallout 76 is not a game for people for those who do not want to be responsible for their own entertainment, but is a dream come true for those who do.
---
Im having a slightly different glitch where if i hop into the power armor it will show no fusion core in the back and i wont be getting the stat bonuses from the armor and the only way I can get it back to normal is to leave and rejoin a server, tried this solution just to see if it would work but no luck, anyone here about this issue or how to fix it?
---
lol..filthy liars..ok..i posted again this time with more info and it seems to have worked this time..thnx for your help.
---
Maybe one for Fissure one for non? 
---
I've had the quest in there for awhile now, only nuked non-fissure sites.

Happy 76th day :)

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Still more efficient/faster than loading the pipboy, then perkscreen, in game. 
---
Tfft!
---
You're welcome 
---
I was removed countless times before I managed to figure out how to post against that garbage auto-bot...
---
Happy to help. Happy trading
---
It doesn't mention that Martial Artist works with making guns fire faster but it definitely works with the gataling gun. Makes it shoot way faster, like a minigun that does way more damage.
---
Perk manager is great as the points for melee and heavy guns as very similar so you can switch between both modes with a couple of buttons.
---
That boy ain't right.
---
Can you check what is the name of this holotape?
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Why do you want to go pvp on a pve server? The pvp server will be online around in March this year (maybe). 
---
yeh the bot likes to grief me.
---
I can assure you it's not working as intended, anyone can use the keypad access switch without knowing the code, the post and comments you refer to is saying the same, that it's bugged.
---
Damn that was quick.
---
Wtf did u just say
---
Sound advice there I got mine from scrapping I may have been lucky but it only took 5 or 6 guns to get one
---
Hey, i have gotten him to spawn 4 or 5 times at Charleston over a course of a few hours server hopping.
---
Facing the little pond / barn house across from the station he will spawn between the barn, and water. If he isn't there head towards Charleston by going over the little red bridge with train tracks on it. Once you are on the other side leave the server. When you spawn back in and run over it triggers a random event spawn from that distance. Rinse and re-peat until he pops up.
---
Then what the fuck are you doing here? 
---
You know, other than trying to bait an argument to make yourself feel special
---
Ultra Lite mods can be purchased from the Enclave Bunker in the Production section.
---
Could you share your Fallout 1, 2, tactics and NV builds with us too?
---
Hunting rifle imo as for per shot damage but u have never used a gauss rifle 
---
Everyone thinking the nerf is going to kill tse rifles I dont think it will. Lever and handmade will still out damage a hunting rifle 
---
Oh man also you! I posted this idea a month ago, and I'm very happy that other people still find this idea a way to improve the game, specially in a game where time doesn't freeze. It would be the first game where this function is really usefull
---
there are tse hunting rifles, you know that right?
---
We do events where we all throw down plans we already know to swap with others and no joke there were like over 100 Ultracite Explosive Vent plans. Everytime I see people throw down plans after a SBQ fight there is always like 10 of these lying around every single time :P
---
Mods didnt always make you better either. Its still paid mods.
---
Why, Juicehead is pretty reliable. He actually gives Fallout 76 a fair shake. You people only seem to have a problem when he has anything negative to say.
---
Yes, because duping is the only problem with this game...
---
We all know how bad duping is, but Bethesda isnt actually acting on it, so I say its also their fault things got that bad.
---
However, duping is just a small problem in a bigger picture. There are tons of unaddressed issues, and a concerning focus on developing a survival pvp that only a very small percentage of players asked for.
---
Witchunting for dupers is not going to solve much and is putting gamers against gamers over a game littered with problems that bethesda alone is responsible for.
---
Be reasonable, please.
---
So one has to go in. The others wait until he is in and then the next one goes and in waits and then the next one ect??
---
So when you are in a group of three, you have to go into a loading screen one after another?
---
This was not do to Dupers.
---
Yes smart ass I'm talking about aae hunting rifles.  Tse hunting rifles dont out damage a lever anyway

That's a really cool idea. One question though: will the door still be breakable? It could just have a very high durability.

Were you in a group with someone who wasn‚Äôt able to do it yet? I teamed up with husband who hadn‚Äôt done it and while he was in there the first time I couldn‚Äôt go in with him. Even though I was dressed right.

YouTube is the 21st century version of the check-out aisle at the grocery story, where they have all the celebrity gossip mags.

No, Tom Hanks did not secretly marry Sharon Stone as he was dying with cancer.

No, Fallout is not going free-to-play. 
---
No, EA does not owe you money for "your time" because you couldn't log into the Anthem demo.
---
I don't claim them because a) I don't need more junk b) everytime I build a big one I get disconnected c) sometimes I like to server hop between friends
---
With that said though if you claim a bunch of workshops I will happily help defend them with you :P
---
Dude you are a freaking hero. Saved.
---
 And wouldn't it be nice to live together ...
---
Marsupial and Jetpacks :P
---
you start knowing them i beleive, i just threw it on /he armor bench a,d could craft them
---
Because I paid full price for this alpha test at release, and I have a right to share my opinion about it. And if you shills and fanbois don't like people having different opinions, tough shit.
---
In the room that you get the instructions on how to launch nukes :)
---
These are definitely numbers I don't "feel". Sleeping 7 hours every night of your life sounds like little sleep to me, unless you compensate during week-ends.
---
People want hunting rifles for the novelty mostly or cause they like the weapon. Their price is high only due to rarity and the fact that they haven't been duped as much as other weapons. The damage is average at best compared to other options out there that are far more affordable and easier to find.
---
I just don't really know why you semi-insulted the guy by saying "people who like things given to them on a plate". It's not some $20 sandbox game like Minecraft. It is full price and people expect a suitable amount of content for that price (a common criticism of which is that there is no endgame to speak of). If a game requires you to go out of your way to be fun then that is a failure on the developers' part. When you're paying this amount of money for a game with extortionate microtransactions to boot, you should absolutely not have to be responsible for your own fun as you put it. If you can have fun that way then great but I'm pretty sure most people cannot. No need to belittle them for it. 
---
"Smash that like button, also for more content from Angry Videogame Guy and don't forget to hit the subscribe &amp; notifications buttons too."
---
lever outdamages hunting by 5 at base but has no armor pen magazine and shorter range.
---
so hunting is probably better.
---
Holy shit what kind of idiot say this was because of dupers hahaha. No idea what they thinking but the game got a lot of issues and dupers are mostly crashing servers but they don't do graphic bugs lol 
---
Seems like it would have been a really easy way to add a lot more life and purpose into the game.
---
Wasted opportunity really. 
---
Fun fact, when behemoths and mutants spawn to attack whitespring gate you can just walk in the middle of them because they target guarding robots instead of you
---
The wendigo thing is a "radiant" quest I think. You can do whenever you want for xp.
---
The holotapes are 17 to complete the overseers mission and win the trophy. 
---
The 18th is only for lore.
---
I was thinking this. But I've been seeing alot of ppl commenting that tse rifles r getting nerfed so they want the aae hunting rifle. 
---
oh..that explains it then..thnx 
---
Not sure it will out damage a tse lever!!
---
You look like The Gimp from Pulp Fiction!
---
BEELOOOOOONG!
---
Not sure it will out damage a tse lever. 
---
You think the developers are handling atom distribution and bag replacement?
---
Don't say anything that can be construed as potentially negative. Don't make any kind of criticism about the game. It's perfect, and the poor sales, reviews, and the dwindling playerbase is evidence everything is perfect.
---
doesn't matter if it's tse or aae, in the same category hunting wins because of the armor pen from the mag.
---
1. Fat chance. They aren't even capable of fixing the bugs their first "patch" created. 
---
2. You don't need a link. That will be a dead mode in a week. Fallout players aren't Fartnite players. 
---
3. See answer #1
---
4. No npcs are coming. They wouldn't help the game at this point anyway. 
---
I can't jump high enough to get over the concrete support
---
Where did you get the plans from?
---
I feel like when they mess up the coding that stops people being able to complete the weekly quests (which has happened numerous times before) they should just automatically award the atoms. I've played free to play MOBILE GAMES that had better service in that regard
---
So many dickhead comments... why so aggressive ppl?
---
Yeah the events usually have a short time limit and thats the challenge. You have to manage the time to go in and out. 
---
With that said, going in an unkowm location requires caution and preparation, and that's why you should first store junk and equip the best weapons. 
---
In events its the some thing. Never do an unknown event without preparing first.
---
The game sucks though 
---
Anyone experiencing lvl1 luck of the draw firing more often the lvl2/3 or is it just me? :D
---
Not sure what your opinions are, i only see a bunch of name calling and trying to appear edgy.
---
Please stop, this is no place for common sense. 
---
Nice, added you. And send me a dm when you are online and i will jump on.
---
Hunting rifle has too low rof imo. Handmade would be it with same legendary perks, dmg per shot might be lower, but overall dps higher.  If you want a hard hitter, you can use a gauss.
---
Imo the only reason to use a hunting rifle is if you simply like the weapon and want to use one without minmaxing dps.
---
This is because Bethesda think it is acceptable to launch a product that should never have made it out of BETA (or ALPHA) and cashed in on it.
---
It really is that simple.
---
I suggest you don't listen to every single comment that is typed in your streams, for all you know you are streaming to a bunch of 9 year old's, who I'm sure meant well however without being able to verify anything why allow them to shape your opinion?
---
If you really must stream don't take everything in the comments literally, although with 90 odd views i'd say just jack it in play games for fun not for likes!
---
I'll save you some time on the first couple of emails: have you shutdown the game client and restarted? Did you turn you pc off and on? Have you checked your internet connection?   Good luck in your quest
---
I nearly never put info and it works
---
I have gotten him loads of times but all these guides seem to do more server hopping then what is normally needed.
---
Really all you should have to do is fast travel to Charleston Train Station (if you are not already there). Run across the red bridge, turn around and run back towards the cabin next to the lake and it will spawn an event.
---
This event can be a group of ghouls, a group of super mutants, a responder eye bot, a mr handy taking dogs for a walk, a mothman, a pipe piper eyebit with a trail if mice behind him or the Responder vendor bot and his pals.
---
If you get to the cabin and it spawns anything but the vendor bot then you need to jump to another server and try again (or just try again in the same server much later on). Sometimes it doesn't spawn anything and doesn't work if someone builds a camo there.
---
If you are on the PC it is good to use the Text Chat mod as people normally shout out if they have the responder vendor or Graham and hold them for others.
---
It's not! Would be a bit too strong ;)
---
You can turn pacifist mode on to avoid your pet attacking other players
---
What kind of outfit is that?
---
&gt;Same here (L94). Another issue is that i don't have room for fusion cores in my STASH, so i have keep them in my inventory. Even if you carry only 5 of them that's 15 lbs you can't spare without PA.
---
Even if it dies i just server hops and it's back ;)
---
Hell yeah, there are members of my team who can beat my time most likely. But yeah ill try getting a good server and do it again.
---
Stick to gauss rifle. I have a sniper build and a two shot gauss rifle with two mods that goes up to 390 damage. Im killing a scorchbeast in the air with 3 hits.
---
But make sure you max a few cards like rifleman, tank killer and tormentor. Thats how you max a rifle. 
---
Also ammo is easy af to craft. Lead + steel.
---
Equip super duper and ammosmith cards and thats the only gun youll ever use.
---
Also max the card to repair weapons at 200%. And youll only need to repair it like once a week or so.
---
Gary counts as part of my base, so if someone attacks him he becomes wanted. Killing Gary would give no xp ;)
---
The reality of the situation is shills and fanbois think they can bully anyone with a differing opinion with downvotes and they will just shut up and go away, but see I'm not one to back down from a fight. In fact I will fight 10 times harder and get 10 times more negative as a reaction to that kind of BS. They might control this very small corner of the internet but they have no control over the rest of it. And that is the reality of the situation. And the more they bully, the more people will get even more negative and fight back, [fire with fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUZV_KLiCJA).

"ItS tHe DuPErrRrrRsSs"
---
Noticed your raiders emblem do you know if they have any good Discord chats set up yet?
---
You mention the accuracy of the 2 shot Gauss, is this with or without VATS, or both?
---
Well, Im on pc, so I dont have this problem lol. Maybe theres a guide on how to do that with console. My buddy on xbox usually uploads photos and vids from his games onto one drive. Got no clue how that works tho.
---
If use gunsmith 5 and a 200% repaired minigun 1200 rounds or so before being broken
---
Once again verbal abuse and a general bad attitude. Way to legitimise your point buddy.
---
Troll harder
---
Because of the Martial Arts bug (yes, it makes both the Gatling and Laser Gatling fire faster) I think the Gatling stands above the other heavy guns. It lasts longer (doesn't break) than the other heavies and you can put a 500 round drum on it with a speedy receiver.
---
If you don't have an AA version the only armor penetration you have is Stabilized in INT and it requires you wear Power Armor. Emergency Protocols, Bloodied Gatling, Adrenal Reaction, and Nerd Rage all work great together.
---
I recommend skipping One Gun Army and have someone else cripple her down with a shotgun and Enforcer - that just works better for whatever reason.
---
Adrenaline in Agility can pump up your heavy damage really quick and the base per-shot damage on the Gatling is much higher than other heavy guns.
---
Will have a google and see what i can do this evening :)
---
You spend a lot of time watching this guys videos? Or just watching other people play games in general? 
---
Would bet this was posted just to get clicks onto the vid, it's not like this particular streamer is above that is it?
---
I get watching a vid guide for tips and maybe walk through's and cheats etc but never understood the need to sit around watching some other guy play a game, why not just play yourself?
---
wait, wot?!?
---
It's not Sharon Hanks?
---
Do you want ants? BECAUSE THIS IS HOW YOU GET ANTS!
---
People are crazy impatient when they come in when i shop, they give it like 10 seconds before they start jumping, shooting or whatever just to get my attention. 
---
Maybe you people need some of my ADD medicine. Go see a doctor.
---
Built my CAMP and it auto scrapped my X01 jetpack mod for steel even though I had tons of steel on me. I can't let it go. 
---
In the beginning, the scorchbeast attack was even worse than now. It would block your vision from everything else and the the scorched would comes from every side and gang bang you do death.
---
After what I think it was a nerf, you can now actually see the ring patterns coming from the scorchbeast and you're able to avoid most of it. 
---
Sounds like an opportunity for PVP over the launch as it stands now.
---
I know this is an old post, but do you still have the jumpsuit? I'd be willing to pay/trade if need be. I'm on PS4
---
Sure thing guy.  I'm thinking a futon would go good here, really ties your head together.  I'm obviously gonna be here a while, might as well make it home-y.
---
Funny, this is the exact same position reviewers took at launch and this sub roundly told them where to shove their 'hatetrain' opinions.
---
So you think someone duping caused a graphical bug in your game? I‚Äôm sorry but... maybe use your brain a little? What does duping have to do with a graphical bug? 
---
Duping might cause lag and server crashes thats it. People need to stop saying duper e they face something they dont understand.
---
Its like living in the middle age and saying everything you don‚Äôt understand is due to witchcraft its stupid
---
UI in this game needs to be more accessible.   An interface should not be subjected to light sources (looking at you pipboy and terminals).  
---
Also the notes need to be in a clearer format.  I think for the sake of immersion, having notes in a more readable font and better background would go a long way.  
---
As for the HUD, we should get a small choice of interfaces.  The pipboy wrist view is awful as it doesn't make use of the screens real estate and suffers from lighting.  The other view is better but the colors are suck.
---
The power armor is much much worse and doesn't look as nice as being out of it.  These interfaces all cause eye strain and are no way near functional.  I remember the terminals from fallout 4.  A big screen terminal in a well lit area was heavenly.  Go to the small screens with the dumb fisheye view and you end up squinting to read the text. 
---
Please Bethesda look into reworking the UI.  If this was a website it would fail an accessibility test.  I have 20/20 vision and if  I'm having issues then those with poor eyesight must be struggling at times.
---
Fuck no. 
---
I think its actually both but to me, it feels like its super noticeable in VATS. I don't seem to miss while manual sniping but VATS is like 50% or something ridiculous, even when the target shows as 95% accuracy. I basically seem to miss every other shot in VATS.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy with max rifleman/commander perks. The Gauss rifle can take it out in 5 minutes or less. Took out 4 in a session. But I run most of the time since they aren‚Äôt worth killing. Especially with the terrible drops. 
---
I'm sorry to say, but you have mental issues.
---
You don't say.
---
It has bad framerate, poor textures and bad pop in.  
---
Photo mode makes the game look much better than it is thanks to filters, dof options and light settings.
---
76 days of building houses and killing the same mobs over and over and over and over and over then back to another 8 hour grind of building a new home. Amazing AAA content. 
---
Seek help
---
A video can show them exactly how to reproduce it, and doing it once wont harm anyone, not even himself.
---
I assumed it would work and tried it ... imagine my disappointment 
---
Right? A little bit of chameleon, a skeleton costume, and you're set. Certainly doable, but there is also the aspect of weapon swing animation. Though I suppose if it was a more straight handled scythe, and not the type with the small attached extra handle, it could take the same animation as any two hander.
---
i was there for that also got so much one star stuff. All set for my 1400 cap vendor run today. 
---
Ml9
---
What I would like to see is having all legendary gear removed from survival mode.
---
Nice fix, but what a pain in the ass to execute every time we fast travel.  Working around this game is a chore at the moment.
---
god damm how much time do you got in your hands?
---
Beth is supposed to know if he did it only once or not? And if he posts publicly, it‚Äôs telling other people how to do it too
---
Thanks for all the info. So, would you reckon that it'd be safe to rank them from hardest hitting (per shot) to lowest as follows:  
---
1. Gauss  
---
2. Lever  
---
3. Hunting
---
Thx
---
Besides, I kinda hope Bethesda will change the process at some point. 
---
I feel this way the climax is a bit broken...
---
Someone else is using this.
---
Lol it does matter. Range I give you but lever go ty range also
---
hoooo so you can't tame the one from Deathclaw Island ? :(
---
Private message with private video to Bethesda. No Dev will ban you for showing them how to reproduce a cheat in their game.
---
I'm xbox and I got mine by scrapping them too 
---
They already did.
---
What responder bot?
---
Nope, some 3rd party probably is.
---
First off I played 4 and liked it as well as new Vegas second off I‚Äôm a ps4 player. You can look at visual evidence of all the people and all their bugs that they have had all my friends have had bad bugs too. No man‚Äôs sky was a game that came out and went back on their promise of what the game was and they got just as much hate. This game is not a game it‚Äôs not a beta it feels like an alpha of a game that shouldn‚Äôt be 60 dollars. The only reason it‚Äôs barley surviving and I do mean barley is that you die hard fans will buy what ever they give you and deny and faults like an abused girl friend. I‚Äôm sure if the name of this game was not fallout and some random ip no one would play it because it‚Äôs a bad game simple as that.
---
Am running 1440 but with a 1070. Never looked a VRam usage but does seem high over 8gb?
---
Shills and fanbois is an accurate description of what is going on here. You're the one who replied to me with verbal abuse. And continue to do so. I am simply stating my opinion and the truth. Which some can't seem to handle. I don't need to "legitimize" my point to shills and fanbois. Nothing is changing their pathetic group mind.
---
I‚Äôd love to know this too. We just launched our first nuke this past weekend, but only after the code word in the bunker somehow revealed itself. Figured it revealed itself over he course of the week(?) 
---
Like you, I‚Äôm assuming they had to try different combos of words, but with 8 letters, theres got to be more than 300 possibilities. Not to mention the headache -.- 
---
I stand in the doorway with my Tesla armor to tag every spawn then stand aside and let the turrets kill them so I can grab the loot. All it costs is some stimpacks and rad-away, some of which I get as loot in the drops.
---
A few people have suggested to not use turrets as a solution to the problem and the reality is this is NOT a solution to the issue.  I don't use turrets and you still can't build a comprehensive base; by comprehensive, I mean taking advantage of all the various items, actually having rooms, and not just some stupid physically impossible sky-based supported by a single foundation.
---
Vanity, creativity, base building is a major component of this game and one of the few reasons I still was playing it.  More specifically there seems to be a level 200ish base budget stall and now that I can't add to my base anymore I'm finding less and less reason to play.  
---
Bottom line, CAMP Atom Shop items - for me at least - have become pointless to buy since you can't use them all in an advanced base with the current budget restrictions.
---
Why are you so hardly trying to be a douche on the internet ? Do you think people will be impressed by how manly and strong you seem to be ? 
---
The man acts as if he cared about the tamed beast because it's supposed to be a pet. It's just a story on the web. OP's probably not seeing a shrink for this. You might need one for not understanding this.
---
Same here, commented this would be a great use of that app a while back. Would love to have the Pip Boy available on a separate screen.
---
You've never fought a scorchbeast queen.
---
blush
---
It also means no accidental friendly fire
---
I'd say that was completely fair yeah.
---
How many times can you say "shills and fanbois"? Pick up a fucking thesaurus.
---
The reason you're getting downvoted is because all you're doing is spreading negativity and bot contributing to discussion so kindly get the fuck off your high horse
---
They still attack anyone in sight, but they wont do any damage, but can still be killed.
---
Animals seem to get an undocumented smell skill which overrides stealth.
---
Nice! How much cost that plan?
---
She is the hardest boss in the game.  Drops the best plans and ends the story.  That is the definition of end game.  
---
I've got a single action revolver ivory grip I could trade.
---
Was just curious and Afterburner lets you display tonnes of stats on the screen.
---
Before the new card I had an EVGA 980 Classified SLI setup and on medium and max settings I didn‚Äôt notice stuttering so I think they have balanced it out well.
---
Don‚Äôt worry too much about this particular sub. It‚Äôs notorious for desperados shilling for this mess of a game, any criticism is bad, Bethesda can do no bad yadayadayada.
---
nope, sadly not.
---
You've never fought a scorchbeast queen I take it. Has nothing to do with being able to solo her. When you finally get to you will see what people are talking about. Talk to me when you've spent hundreds of rounds of ammo, countless stimpacks and other aid items for nothing, I doubt your attitude will be that of "well I wasted all my ammo and healing items but by golly that was fun" believe it or not, people aren't complaining about this just because they want to grief.
---
Stop thinking what youtubers tell you to. The game is far from perfect, but it's gotten to the point where the hate train is contributing more to the poor health of the game than any bug or bad business practice ever could
---
He bought the game, he‚Äôs entitled to his opinion. Maybe you should just sit down and listen, perhaps would be a good idea given the poor state of this game and it‚Äôs reception.
---
Rng must just love me then. SBQ dropped my first TSE, farmed a few decent armor pieces too
---
Replacing your +special stat's modified under armor with rad resistance sounds completely fair to me.
---
Claiming workshop can happen without xp/items reward, and defending it from upcoming hostile mobs (usually right after the claiming) doesn't give any rewards too. At first I thought I derped or somehow missed my spoils, but today I definitely didn't get anything for Billings Homestead Workshop claiming and defending. Isn't happening every time and actually kinda rare - I claim anything free on my way and just noticed it yesterday.
---
Do you have proof that he has bought it? Any idiot on the internet can say "ree i bought it and it sucks". Why didn't he refund or trade in then move on with his life if it is so bad?
---
Completing the crashing when nuke lands frustrates me more
---
Is it just explosive? If it is, then it would be accurate. The bullet explodes as it hits the target.
---
You start losing accuracy with Two Shot weapons. My TSE Gauss Rifle accuracy is god awful.
---
A lot of us are waiting for private servers.
---
I'd rather gather my materials by hand than open myself to pvp due to the caps lost = level problem. Losing 200+ caps to a one-shot is not fun in my book.
---
Sorry I didn't get the notification, I'm on now, and can be again later today.
---
"reee my game doesnt work so it must be DUPERS"
---
I love the game but accept it's bad in ways. Not everything is the fault of a duper. Stop listening to idiots in your chat and indirectly promoting yourself as a streamer
---
I just quit with any kind of crop for those exact reasons, so much so I took the carnavor mutation just so I couldn't eat veggies anymore :) 
---
Wait...so You have just said that by choosing to do something, that Bethesda has chosen to do nothing? Or is your argument that they just made a poor choice in how to deal with the issue?
---
I had a similar problem that was solved when I moved my CAMP. Missile turrets wouldn‚Äôt fire. Storing and replacing turrets (make sure to scrap your wires first to avoid phantom budget!) may be worth a try first, but I think I tried this with no results. Very satisfying once they started to fire again. 
---
I built my camp so far away from everything in the south part of the savage divide. I have a nice lake house, but unfortunately no one ever comes down to see it. There are basically no fast travel points within a comfortable distance of it.
---
Lol you had those kinda turrets too, mine would just sit there looking at me while super mutants was unloading mini gun rounds into my face, all chill like too
---
Those fuckin' turrets
---
I switch between a lever and a hunting rifle. I like both. But when shit hits the fan over at whitespring, i.e swarms of bloated, the lever takes too long to reload. The hunting rifle has a slower rof, but clips are bigger and switching magazine goes faster as well?  Not tested it or anything, but I think the hunting rifle has better dps if you factor in reloading. I could be wrong. 
---
Be a raider and, destroy it XD
---
I‚Äôve experienced something similar. Every enemy was a bloated one. I leveled up few times and got like 30+ legendaries and few of them I use to this day. I don‚Äôt know how this can happen. Maybe some lvl 200+ triggered them to spawn?
---
Having to go to the website has its benefits. When you have a report button in game the support team is going to get exponentially more reports any time someone is mad they got killed, or got offended, or whatever really. As it is now I would bet a decent majority of reports on the website are legitimate and actually get dealt with. It just makes me think of this one phone game I play with a report feature and people are reporting people non stop because they have shitty internet and lag in the game and think they are cheating.
---
The game has major issues, don‚Äôt need to request identification over every opinion just because there are clear faults with the game.
---
If you‚Äôve read my post history then you would know I‚Äôm honest about my opinion of the game, positive and negative, and I couldn‚Äôt care less whether I‚Äôm downvoted or not. If it wasn‚Äôt for my almost OCD of trying to be the most OP dude in the wasteland grinding for gear I wouldn‚Äôt be bothered. I at least played enough hours to get my money‚Äôs worth but I don‚Äôt feel great about it.
---
I can sympathize. I got the plan on my 38th completion of the Patrol duty event... and I've spent countless hours checking safes and world spawns in the Toxic wastes.
---
Unfortunately I have another character that I want the plan on also, so my woes aren't behind me entirely.
---
How do you drop it if you don't own the workshop? You can't get into build mode unless you claim it, right?
---
Then stop playing and trade in. It's not fucking hard
---
This would be heartbreaking if the taming feature  actually worked. They are constantly aggro‚Äôd for no reason, and the ‚Äúgriefer‚Äù probably just thought there was an angry deathclaw in your home. Not to mention most players don‚Äôt even know taming is an option.
---
I spent too much time reloading my explosive Dragon trying to kill a Scorchbeast flying over the General's Steakhouse last night. Far too much.
---
What platform? I have a spare one, but I already know the recipe. Your bud can have the mod for free if you're on xbox
---
yeah that's a fair shout. I've had it with lvl1 eyebots spawning in the club house. the legendary ones drop lvl1 legendary weapons XD
---
I have bud. Destiny 2 is where it‚Äôs at now. (And it‚Äôs polished)
---
At least one useful glitch against griefers ;)
---
nuke'em
---
I‚Äôm interested to see how the update this morning effects tse and how that plays out in game. Maybe briefing won‚Äôt be as prolific after the tse nerf. 
---
Uhhh no thats not what i said at all. Hints the words player trading. You have have options to trade with other players to look for the gear you want. Also if you have time to play then you have time to grind. The game isnt going anywhere you can shut it off and come back and play it at anytime. 
---
The easier option is the roach with a top hat / cane sitting on a toilet north of the amusement park. Unmarked house.
---
Yeah, well... doesn‚Äôt everyone have a bed in their CAMP? Problem solved.
---
[Yes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh2Nu2aTPP0) I have started taking my chems again. Med-X etc.
---
Rofl what kind of crack are you smoking
---
Maybe I had a mental lapse. I think you're right, and I bet I've focused so much on that generator that I thought I was doing it without the workshop.
---
Now that I think about it, I've always had to do a defend quest, so...  Derp. 
---
I've had the same thing with the SB body re-spawning at my camp after killing it at a distant location. It's better than the times I kill one and can't find the body. 
---
SBs sometimes drop decent items (hand mades, etc.) since the last batch and the meat is yummy.
---
Not the best bro. Maybe you could hook me up with some real strong shit that‚Äôll make Fo76 good? 
---
&gt;Maybe griefing won‚Äôt be as prolific
---
I have over 400 hours in this game, I have not once ran across a griefer.
---
Nothing a good artillery strike cant fix
---
Hmm funny. Fallout 4 was big ridden and successful. 
---
I fail to see the issue. Don't like it. Don't play is my motto. 
---
I like it, bugs or not,  and play it. 
---
I have had legendary armor drops.  One star though.
---
Last 4 technical data has been trash like ammo and radx.
---
Can you place that on top of foundation?
---
It's the same.  
---
Have noticed am getting quite a few jumps in FPS i never used to get over the last week. 
---
Great idea and i agree with your reasoning. As already suggested, a tab in the pipboy with a damage log would probably be better for figuring out damage dealt.
---
Is there anything that *isn't* blamed on 'dupers' these days?
---
That rapid charlie solving got me one SBQ run in before bed/work/patch, thanks.
---
I lost more workshops due to disconnects than being attacked by other players. I still grab one occasionally if it's free and I don't want to fast travel back to my camp to make/repair some gear, but I don't have the patience to "hold" them.
---
Cute. Try harder. In fact No, go play your precious destiny and see how much Activision has fucked it and bungie has dropped the ball. (and before you think i'm some kind of hater take a look at my post history. I defended that steaming POS tooth and nail)
---
Either way if you don't even play anymore and have nothing positive to say then there's literally Zero point you posting in this sub
---
It's the stairs. The stairs are just terrible. The rest of the system isn't too bad in my opinion, I like it more than Fallout 4. 
---
How do they get them so close ?
---
You can! Any of the floor plans from the Atomic Shop can replace the existing patterns on top of the foundations.
---
Please destroy it !
---
andwhat is  the purpose of this camp?
---
I am actually a big fan of many Bethesda games. Some of my all time favorites. I'm not hating on the developers, the designers, the artists, they work hard and do what they can. They don't make the decisions that lead to ruin. I love developers. I love their art. I love every little thoughtful detail. I know it must be tough for them to get criticism, but it is what it is. I don't care for mob mentality and wanting a scapegoats head to roll or any of that shit. I just want them to listen to what people are saying and try to get it right. Any criticism |I have for the game is in my opinion a way to make it better and more enjoyable experience for everyone. I may not always be right. I may not always have all the facts. Sometimes they really do know better than me the player. But sometimes they need to humble themselves and listen when people are saying something is wrong here.
---
A 1*bloody fist weapon will do twice as much dmg as a 3 Star two handed.... so yea that‚Äôs a great drop 
---
Raiders are going to use the gear they loot. They're going to look like the people they raid. If you're going to RP, do it right.
---
Wierd, I usually manage 5 hours a night but anything more than that has ben laying there, not tired.
---
I found it. At first I thought it was my buddy's suit glitching out(we were playing together at the time and both wearing Power Armor Chassis with one or two pieces of Raider Armor) and I went over to it and realized it was a full set, so I hopped in it and got the message. We realized it was just a free suit laying around and my buddy congratulated me.
---
Hey at least that grenade launcher is in pristine condition! 
---
It takes less than 4 to get an XP boost. I'd say you'll be fine, just keep chems on you.
---
I've yet to find that damn bot and I hit that location every server I join.
---
That's...actually...a good argument. The lone wanderer never had to deal with other players who wanted to be dicks. You make a good point.
---
Haha nice
---
I haven't come across most of those locations yet
---
when you double the dimensions,  area will be 4x bigger.
---
4x megapixel.
---
Agree. I was getting a solid 60FPS before the upgrade and FO76 doesn‚Äôt support SLI, so that was only one card.
---
At launch I struggled in the 30‚Äôs for most of the time. 
---
&gt;I'm not super into min/maxing.
---
Why do people assume you're not "min-maxing" at all unless you sacrifice every little thing for more damage?
---
Seems weird to me.
---
Me and my friend actually collected all of the pieces and deciphered the code by writing it out on paper the first time just to say we did it, but yes I think after that it just gets tedious when you're trying to keep farming areas for weapons and armor. And the first 3 or so times we didn't get but maybe one or two legendaries and they were only 1 star.
---
Pretty sure you have to place a floor, and a set of standard stairs then you can remove that poorly designed platform stairway.  Then remove the floor and the new stairs.
---
Follow 
---
Yup, my issues continue. Last 3 or 4 days have been pretty bad. Got 'server not responding' few times and a few server disconects last night
---
What I don't understand is that you're not allowed to camp anywhere near main structures in the game except here. Why is this allowed? 
---
Neither of those would be ideal for close range engagements either way. Better off carrying a handmade/assault/combat/pipe rifle for such occasions. 
---
3 more months of not knowing the problems the general public would find/create when thousands of people started playing at once probably wouldn't have changed much.
---
panvsha...looking forward to it...
---
I kind of agree, and I will stop being semi-insulting when people will adjust their own language accordingly.
---
For now i'm hearing 'game is shite' much more than 'I would love to have a Fallout coop oriented game'. I see 'there is nothing to do in this game' about a title based around free exploration in which the free exploration elements are of exceptional quality, and I were insulted for saying the lore is very interesting. So many fake news circulate about this game so that when I hear it's an empty title by people circling single location, assuming intelectual inferiority of the majority is like the only reasonable scenario.
---
4K is around 2.25 that of 1440P.
---
4 times 1080P.
---
Surely VRAM use doesn‚Äôt scale like that. If it did only the RTX Titan would have enough memory. 
---
all texture loads uncompressed onto vram. 
---
every frame 
---
This is a really weird subreddit for you to be in.
---
It probably depends on many factors like metabolism, weather, habits, etc... but feeling fresh after 5 hours definitely places you in the "exceptional basket". 
---
&gt;f you set certain stash container in front of door ways they can‚Äôt be destroyed. This prevents people from entering through a doorway and there‚Äôs literally nothing you can do since they can‚Äôt be destroyed. This is being exploited to defend workshops. Can you fix this, please?
---
They mean PVP'ers.
---
People attacking there workshops are grievers apparently, even though Bethesda made a PVPve game and workshops are contested zones they will always be grievers to these kind of people.
---
Bug needs fixing along with all the other bugs that get ignored.
---
You don't want to be using VATS with any 2 shot weapons, cuz it's bugged or something. Even at close to mid distance when it says 95% chance to hit, it will still miss 95% of the time.  
---
Tedious and not enjoyable.  Going from the bunker to all around Appalachia to find a nuclear code and then 8 pieces of a code one by one.  So then after going into a Silo you spend ~30 minutes doing a multi step quest to get to the chance to launch the nuke.  You place your nuclear code in the dispenser and then go and type in the code that you have to figure out.  Then let's say you're wrong, it eats your nuke card and then you have to go get another one.  
---
I typically play solo and to do it normally would take hours/days and a broken controller or two.
---
&gt;was not what they expected
---
This
---
I was waiting for this comment.
---
The "gonna die young" basket too I presume.
---
except, a lot of people did dupe, and it's cheating.  It breaks the game.
---
I will personally never understand folks who deck out a PC and then cripple the experience with a controller. Serious question for folks that do this, are you primarily console players who migrated to PC? Seems like you would have to give up a lot of fine grained control to switch away from keyboard / mouse.
---
I RP as a 2 shot griefer.  &gt;!!&lt;/s
---
Yeah, I've lost stuff from a friend emptying the bag early as well.  Having a fresh bag just vanish with no one emptying it sounded like FUD though. 
---
I was talking to a very polite duper last night. He said all his duper friends with over 1 million carry weight were banned. He's only at 100,000 on his mule so he's not worried. Lulz. 
---
Of course he had the stacked explosive bobble head exploit. I wish BGS would ban the people with that exploit too but hey, banning people with 1 million carry weight is a start.
---
I have a black powder rifle with explosive shot, does damage of over 800 with perks and a range of 230.
---
So now not only are PVP'ers in a PVPve game grievers, you want to tell them how to grief properly?
---
Lol it‚Äôs actually kinda fun and it‚Äôs a repeat quest 
---
I‚Äôll be on later this afternoon. 1230cst
---
Yes. I loved the combat rifle in F4, but I feel the vanilla version is too weak in 76 and the game absoultely refuse to drop me a legendary one. I found a TS handmade last night actually, but by the time I log in tonight it's been nerfed :-/
---
When people adjust their language accordingly? All he said is that there's nothing to do. Plus I don't really see why those two statements are mutually exclusive. There are plenty of people who say that this game is fun with friends but also think it's a shitty game. Besides, exploring doesn't always qualify as "something to do" to people. You can "explore" in No Man's Sky but most people would agree that there isn't much to actually \*do\* in the game. I get that you like exploring but you don't need to shit on people who want more than that from a full-price game. In the run-up to this game's release Bethesda were claiming that this game had a proper story just like Fallout 4 (which I think most people would be inclined to disagree with). 
---
slightly less. range matters \*a lot\* unless you're shooting someone point blank.
---
and coupled with the armor pen mag, you can be sure hunting outperforms lever at a distance. probably even up close.
---
Gotta love the people who afk for 10's of minutes while in the vendors. -.-
---
Vault 76 mission is to rebuild america, not UK
---
They should just have a hard limit on the turrets. Like max. 6 for example. 
---
Then rebalance the budget if necessary/possible. 
---
Yes please give us spiral stairs and more options.  
---
Oh, so if I don't play the game the way they think I should I'm a griefer...guess that explains why I haven't ran across any griefers, I am one...apparently lol
---
It's midnight on the 26th for us mate.
---
Yes those cabins are genius. They especially mess with you when you move around between screams to try and locate the origin. I ran a few times towards the woods only to realize the houses themselves emitted the screams! 
---
Immigration exists
---
Do you think griefing is fair or fun? 
---
You guys walk across downed tree limbs to get on the track and you walk the rail until you reach the train. Once there, Getting was to the ‚Äúmiddle floor‚Äù monorail platform takes a little skill and a set of PA... as you have to position your jump to make it on the roof of the lower platform
---
But this is my argument against it. Bethesda has always allowed you the choice to be a terrible person. You could have blown up the nuke in the town in fallout 3. You can't blame them for continuing a trend that has always been in their games. That you can choose to be a jerk.
---
Maybe, or not. I have no clue how it works.
---
It's 0% scientific but I like to imagine that we have some sort of a constant heartbeats amount at our disposal, and that explains why stressed/fat people and tiny animals have a shorter life. 
---
One moment sir, someone will be right with you.
---
Captain Obvious here, don't believe anything some random youtubers barf out in the world. And if you do, seek medical advice immediately!
---
you sure its not 1am
---
I like to share screenshots. I have played a lot of hours and I'm only around level 120. I like to wander and be a happy camper at workshops. I have fun searching trash cans for dog food and finding nuka cola. I'm simple and easily please and I enjoy the game. But some things just make me so disappointed.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/CC9BV4W](https://imgur.com/a/CC9BV4W)
---
In all honesty you are not screwed over, those weapons still have a nice firepower. 
---
There should be an option to turn off the default ones do it only uses yours. That would be nice.
---
Never experienced it or taken part in it, i enjoy PVP though that's why i play FO76, its a PVPve game :)
---
I've never tried RP in FO76 though, after i kill you and destroy your base do I need to say something to RP as a raider or is it just implied?
---
i love the wooden armory, give it to me!
---
Even if they want to keep the one large "stash" setup, make it so when you open an ammo box stash it goes to the ammo tab automatically, file cabinet goes to notes, cooler goes to food etc etc.
---
This could add some variety to stash boxes IMHO.
---
I stopped playing a long time ago feels good too
---
Yea, not 100% sure. But after you kill them you might have to shout "raided" then go and drop there screws in the river :)
---
If it's this tedious that's probably what I'm going to do. Decipher it at least once to say that I did it and then if I end up wanting to do it again to use reddit.
---
Well, you managed to both miss and prove my point. 
---
Perfect game!
---
Jokes aside, besides the annoying and sometimes gamebreaking bugs, it is a lot of fun üòä
---
Agreed, but would hype for other games like Anthem coming out now have taken a chunk out of it if it released now?
---
I have noticed this as well.  I was wondering if scorchbeasts had gotten buffed as I can kill one and then the next just eats me before I can shoot it. 
---
I laughed when I listened to it.  I bet she wished she took her camp now.  What a major oversight by the overseer.

I lure ghouls out the front get them around back use a gamma gun to heal thier health as they destroy the turrets if you try to bring them out the back the turrets take them out

Walking to the wedigo in my clown suit now.

I think there was some kind of bug where power armor had more damage reduction than intended. Maybe they over nerfed it?
---
Man, that sucks... Especially the code eating part that must be infuriating! I'm probably gonna do it properly once (which is gonna be hard sinceI also play solo) to be able to say I've done it and then just use reddit if I want to do it again.
---
During weekdays after work, i have an hour or two online before bed. Which consists of getting my caps from the traders, and farming White Springs even though i have everything i want (Perks, Armour, Mods, TSE's, PA's). Was a bit sick of constantly selling legendaries for a couple of caps. So started picking randoms under level 40 with cool names and stalking them for a while, then giving them loot. But really need to work on my image as "Stalker" me works well, Santa me scares the hell out of a lot of players. If no one bites i just fill all the containers at Flat woods before i log off.

These are some great ideas. Personally I feel like some of these things should make it into Adventure mode as well. I play with a mod that removes nameplates and emote icons from above player heads because its much more immersive.  While I think some (most) of these should be enforced in the Survival mode, we should have the option to toggle them in Adventure as well.

What is your safety word ?

Okay, they're a new order of BoS aggressively accumulating all supplies and technology. Or maybe a sect of the Enclave that believes every sick wastelander has to die
---
You want the assorted lights plan, can be bought in harpers ferry or from raider vendors
---
Going to go do that right now.. actually.
---
Yes went over my laziness already.  
---
Seems like you might need to actually look at the comment thread not just the title.  
---
Plus I'm lvl140 now and didn't really start thinking about PVP until around 120 so the good non-PA grind hasn't been a consideration for very long.  Im referring to all the pieces I sold prior to the realization my X01 or basic 1* combat pieces weren't going to do the job(aaaand some after as well.)
---
Why am I not surprised? Thanks for the heads up.
---
No
---
It happens to me every time I'm fighting SBQ. It is annoying lol.
---
Are you sure weight makes no difference? I thought heavier armor makes more noise when you move increasing detection rate. Also, do you know if shrouded works in daylight?
---
awww... 
---
I am level 41 and have been in PA since level 15

Those stairs are garbage, just use the standard stairs without the floor piece attached. Setting up camps gets way easier the more you do it and isnt bad once you figure out what snaps into what. I‚Äôve made probably 30-40 unique camps and just the other day ran across a brand new issue to work through when designing a split level home. Figured it out but it took a few hours. 
---
No they don't.
---
The people that worry about what You tubers say and do are the only ones that think like that. Bethesda ruined the potential of FO76 by releasing it to early.
---
The people that played the game and DON'T rely on you tubers for there opinion were still able to work that out without them.
---
How many cores does it make per hour again?
---
Nowadays when I need cores I just go to Whitesprings, kill the big ol' robots at grab their core before they explode. You can get a handful of them in 10 minutes. 
---
We picked up Red Dead 2 the other day and my husband keeps asking me when I'm going to put down FO76 and start playing that. All in good time, baby.

probaly because u dont know how to turn off pvp mode...
---
Do people still use youtube to get an idea of what games are like?
---
Thought it would be better to just watch people live on twitch to make your own opinions, so the game isnt hidden behind biased edits of gameplay footage.
---
Aww damn I literally just trashed two of them about a hour ago. If I get another one I will give you a shout.
---
Hkelop

It does, can confirm. With speedy receiver, my TSE gatling fucking rocks.

&gt;unless you compensate during week-ends.
---
You can't "compensate" for lost sleep. The ill-effects of sleeping poorly can't be recovered from. You either have healthy sleep or you don't. Not sleeping for 2 days then sleeping for 24 hours doesn't average out to 8 hours of sleep each night.

Considering the basic math involved with this question, I‚Äôd have to assume it is intended.  But you know what ‚Äúassume‚Äù makes

You are correct in saying that everything in your reply is 0% scientific :)

If we know these, does that mean we don‚Äôt have to hunt down code pieces? I work and have a newborn so I don‚Äôt have time to complete the entire process solo. I‚Äôd just like to get the trophy but like being crowned emperor on ESO, it seems unobtainable for me.

As a possible couple of answers to your question: because not everybody is currently in the same situation  everyone has the right to react according to their own experiences and not to your understanding of how they should be behaving, not everyone has experienced the same developmental or otherwise significantly developing moments as they grew up, b/c not every single brain produces and reacts to chemicals in the same manner and intensity than yours does, and because we are all individuals who should present a diverse understanding of any system we behave within in order to better understand it (you don't have to understand other's emotional situations, but you may appreciate one day that differences go deeper than just a person's skin and that a part of who we are is rooted deeply in how differently we react to the world than others)
---
Being dismissive and belittling because you cannot understand the OP's expression of emotions isn't as productive as your seem to think; being passively aggressive towards people expressing discomfort is a great way to seem like you lack a depth of empathy in front of the community, and reflects upon you as a person though
---
Yeah. I enjoy it too, which is why "waste" is in quotes. 
---
I have advanced more slowly than a lot of people, but have enjoyed the journey. 
---
Yes.
---
It's really rather simple, when you fat travel the game looks for what's in the zone, then it tells your game what to load, then it puts you there once stuff is loaded, because your allies "aren't there" when the game looks it doesn't load in their textures, and because you aren't there yet the game doesn't tell your allies to load your texture.

you always get it when near small freak shop on the east of Big Red Rocket Station in Mire (NE corner of the map). You can kill any Wendigo but there is no special reward.
---
I wouldn't pick it up. Depending on how Bethesda is going to go about banning dupers (hopefully permanently) I wouldn't want those high quantities in my inventory.
---
Thank you for mentioning that it was in your spam folder, I was wondering why I hadn't gotten a response to mine yet and just found it in my own spam folder, too
---
A switch?
---
I believe I saw something where they were fixing that don‚Äôt quote me on it though
---
I doubt they will ban you for just playing the game. If you haven't glitched or exploited then your fine.
---
I found a responder police uniform at a trader, was about 250 cap
---
And better DLC. The damn Sierra Madre left me jumpy AF every time I heard something beep for at least a week after.
---
**OK**
---
So the bug I have noticed while using power armor is that some times it does *not* unequip your character armor. When this happens depending on your armor set and perks you end up with around 1800-200k defense. I haven't noticed it happen recently but I havent been chasing scorched beast lately either and I am normally out of my power armor when farming materials or legendaries.
---
**I have noticed**
---
Player armor in general tends to be bugging out lately. My character has a base of 400 ballistic resistance before my perks proc. And that is really good defense however I have noticed there are times jumping servers where I get 1 shotted by a lvl 30 ghoul and as a lvl 162 this becomes infuriating after a while. It is as if the game doesnt recognize you are wearing armor at all.

How long did it take to farm?
---
like I said, I got no audio. just the video.
---
I think fancy lights plan has something similar
---
that's what I figure, but I remember people saying they got banned because someone reported them for trivial stuff.
---
mostly wondering if it actually happened to someone.

The door stays up when powered and goes down when power cut off, so need to set up a switch. Place a switch, run power wire to the switch and then to the garage door, the. Switch with control power to the door and you can raise up and down üëç

I don't think the way to balance PvP is to buff most weapons. I agree that heavy weapons should come with the bonus of heavy damage, but the problem with PvP isn't the usage of weak weapons it's the existence of already overpowered weapons. 
---
Firefights are no fun when they don't last past the first shot, snipers included.

Eating dog food now launches players into orbit.
---
I havent heard of a major one, yet. But I also just recently discovered r/Fallout76Factions. A recruiting sub. I'll going to find me a nice group for xbox soon. 
---
The bots on the street in Watoga are great for legendary farming. They aren't 100% but the vast majority of the time there's always a few about.
---
On that point, some Children of Atom gear would be awfully nice
---
The potential was there I agree.
---
I had to read your "sentence" 6 times before i knew what the heck you were talking about lol.
---
Go back to Fortnight
---
i did a karma to one punk. Was holding Watoga Wendor. I was nicely waiting... minute, then two, then did any sort of emotes and stuff. but there were some nice meaty level 68 mutants around, lured 'em to the dude, while i chameleon crouched nicely in the corner.
---
somehow the dude woke up, cancelled trade and killed the mutants, but under his nose, i took the vendor. Now it was my time to "hold" lol (just wanted to test his patience).
---
Feels a lot longer ago!
---
I would love a Fallout game where we grow up among BOS. Our chapter gets wiped out by a new strange technology worshiping cult. Taking an alien device from the chapter that was found on your last patrol ( teaching phase of the game).
---
Zetans and the wasteland stuff for days. That is what i would love to see over the per event for say a FO5.
---
Just a bit of fun, I finally did it yesterday, has been in my quest list for weeks...
---
I dont think in a game meant for adults that strong language should result in a ban.  More so with just how easy it is to get away from that kind of vitriol. You just server hop.
---
I've only HEARD other people whine, berate and moan at one another because the instant that shit happens to me I just hop to another server.
---
Yes, I even do this when I launch nukes myself and the nukezone turns into a bitch fest over TSE.
---
Broken game, did not pay
---
60 bucks, for this shit. 
---
Cunty bethesda
---
Server crashes
---
300 people.
---
Cant fix this.
---
I think it was just dependent on your system - in FO4 I built the grandest and craziest of settlements in Sanctuary Hills and had maybe 10-12 total settlements fully developed too.
---
You‚Äôre probably high enough level that people won‚Äôt typically mess with you. Griefers usually target lower level players. 
---
Wait so it‚Äôs Brad Pitt doing this? 
---
Yea I still have it, I'll add you next time I'm on.
---
Also to add. My dad when playing had a full stash and instead of making time to organize it better. He would carry like tons of random scrap on himself.
---
I am moved by your folksy simple ways. 
---
Watoga in general is great, multiple buildings with legendary spawns and all self contained. It's literally a dungeon city. In my opinion all of the cities should have been like that, the only two places that are as close to Watoga in interior building "dungeons" is Morgantown and Charleston. Every other town or city is basically just a blip on the map with no interiors to explore. Going forward I hope the possible new big locations are more cities like these instead of towns like Harper's Ferry or Sutton

I still use two pieces of that Raider set in my main PA setup. I love having some PA pieces that mean something, feels very cool

Oh man your delusional

Thanks for your offer. Currently started to play with new character as now there is more meaningfull stuff to do as all story missions are open again :D

Locking doors leads to destroyed camps

Yes. I do.

Since you're given every method under the sun to avoid it. Hop server. Get the contractor skill and pay 50% repair cost or 70% repair cost.
---
The only thing you lose is a shitty house and a little junk. The person raiding you gets a bounty, the loss of all the junk on them if they're carrying. It's more of a loss for me to shit on your home than it is for you to fix it and kill me.
---
I dont need youtube to tell me that I should wait until after release before I take look at an EA game.
---
And youtubers make their most money with controversy. Youtubers love any form of controversy and if there is none they will create their own.

It looks like if it belonged in the game, nice job man
---
Hey, I am also eternally in Uranium Fever for those elusive raider plans. I feel you.

 We would like a combat helmet light that is craftable and can be activated, but won't replace the default pip boy. You can choose it if works when you put your light or not by upgrading at an armour workbench. 
---
If mining helmet has a light, why doesn't the combat helmet? It has a headlight on the model.
---
The fact you used fake news just confirmed your a moron.
---
Id say rumors. I never curse or insult anyone but myself and a friend get reported literally every day for "cheating" and "briefing" but we don't cheat in anyway whatsoever. Protip empath perk is OP especially if you already have a really good build.
---
Washing the nuke stains out would be a  viable alternative 
---
I store crops this way as well. You can keep them forever without spoiling if you just leave them in your CAMP storage.
---
Thats because you didnt go to the bathroom
---
Can you explain how it is fun for the victim?
---
I totally agree. One of the biggest issues I think the game has is that there is no reason to explore  areas once you have leveled past them. This could be helped with endgame dungeon type interiors in cities. 
---
She told me the one with the wolf and 3 pigs, sneaking in some product placement for a mister Gutsy butler.
---
Pretty sure turrets only attack friends who ding a wall with a stray bullet.
---
I don't have the plans for that
---
It's allowed in a lot of areas. If you slowly walk away from a building with your CAMP out.. keep walking until it turns green, and set it down. The "build radius" of the CAMP now extends back towards the building. 
---
Yep. Still, Bethesda is trying really hard to push players into PvP, I don't get it. They already are terrible at balancing PvE...
---
Also some people in so much denial they defend this nonsense of a games launch. 
---
I'm not joking, i'm lvl 95 and still haven't got the switch plan üòÖ
---
I feel as if you're being duplicitous in not informing the general public as to the wanton aggressive behavior of your cattle.  Those beast on several occasions, without provocation, have assaulted me.  I have stayed my hand several times, however I feel that my peaceful nature (except that one time when I DID kill two of your cows) negatively reinforces the idea that they can behave in any manner they see fit.  
---
We all hope that this is a sinulation, and then we wake up and everyone is still alive.
---
But a singleplayer mode pre-scorched is a good idea.
---
Had something like that happen to me once. Was popping into quests around the map and I did one where I helped someone defend their workshop from attack. I helped the dude and even repaired a few of his extractors for him then used his kitchen to fry up that greasy mole meat. Littlerly the whole time I was repairing his stuff for free and cooking he was punching me over and over. Probably a solid three minutes. No ammount of heart emotes would get him to calm his ass down.
---
Oh if your on xbox i can make it in your base for u tonight
---
Seems like a wide variety of options here. It's great to know how people are using PA. Thanks everyone for the quick feedback. 
---
Doin the Lord, his holiness John Romero's, work
---
You can already tell servers that have been alive for a long while. Most items are looted. No events are spawning.  Security doors stand open. They generally give a blah feeling; at which time I hop servers. You'd have to craft these in such a way as they always feel alive.
---
She told me the tale of Cinderella 
---
Ah yeah that's unfortunate üòÅ
---
Nothing better than taking a workshop from someone carrying around 500lbs of junk in am excavator because they firmly believe they need that and the 600 in stash... its been my most productive way to farm springs. Got like 300 from a guy the other day!
---
I've run into a couple of folks that build like this. I think it's a neat idea and I'll probably steal it at some point. On the plus side it also makes your camp feel more like a little town with multiple buildings.
---
¬†good evening sir, Id like to review your B&amp;B if i may...
---
The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan mutfruit farm, and the natural aroma of the firecracker berry drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your bloodleaf curiosity, and the dawn scorcher walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. Great story to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff‚Äôs attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye.
---
5 stars!
---
I got the entirety of the three little pigs
---
But does your character ever change them?
---
Ok, I've only done that event once and it was with my gimped rifleman char who I am trying to transition to heavy for gatling gun.  I do have a real stealth rifle char now.
---
It's only been 76 days? Feels like this game has been out for more than half a year.
---
And so where and when does the chainsaw dueling club meet? The lower card being the ripper and buzz blade battles...
---
Absolutely disgusting. 
---
West-Tek building 
---
Is it meant to be "fun" for the "victim"? Is that not a subjective word when talking about world wrecking mechanics being used against you? 
---
Was it fun when creepers blew up your house in minecraft? No right? But it happened and you rebuilt it.
---
Same principal but this time the creeper is a player. Though this time you get to repair for almost nothing, get a free kill + caps + junk and if you don't want to fight you can just hop to a different server.
---
If thats not enough. Fallout 4 might be a better choice. At least there you have a kill all command to kill raiders raiding your settlements so you never have to repair anything.
---
More forbidden you can't camp here nonsense. Thanks to you iggy'mo's saying it is forbidden to build their I have people trying to destroy my base next to a the river. But eh I do find it entertaining wrecking these raiders when they attempt to destroy my base. The final count for Sunday's pvp adventure of raiders was about 67-1 in my favor 
---
I always clear the enemies take the free caps and go let someone else have it 
---
I suppose you saw the candelabra version that attaches to walls as well? I also like the warm glow so the Antique Lights plans are my go to for most lighting situations. There are also lamps with the "orange" shades on them. They are warmer as well. Lastly, there is a lamp that is short and has a dark orange "pancake" globe on it, it's quite a low light levels and very warm.
---
&gt;If you're going to RP as a raider then don't grab all the super weapons and armour that a raider would definitely take.
---
I will not be participating in a discussion with a non-developed being.
---
Are you not using one gun army? 
---
Got it too work. Just need to find somewhere similar close to the centre of the map. Costing a fortune fast travelling haha
---
Good bot 
---
Why, so it can do less damage than the .38?  
---
It seems to be the pattern.  Bigger caliber=less damage.
---
This, I've gotten three or four from this quest.
---
True but I liked it
---
Haha yeah done all the regular things im no spring chicken, been around the block a few times lol. Thanks mate.
---
Been looking for one with reduced weight myself for seems like ages now... lol
---
You're evil. Lol
---
What mutations I‚Äôll be on soon so I can get some
---
It would make it closer to the BAR.
---
No. This game was literally unplayable for most of those 76 days. 
---
Obviously you‚Äôre not a golfer.
---
Interested as well...
---
What about those griefers who team up and take each other's bounty? Or griefers who server hop immediately after? I'm not saying that it's a mechanic that should be fixed. My point is that there are people who go out of their way to inconvenience other players without wanting to face consequences.
---
Who knows. Maybe they will fix the .50 receivers on the hunting rifle and come out with this. I use the .50 receivers just for the sound :p
---
Even Star Wars Battlefront 2 is still running and getting updates. And that game had a really bad start. FO76 can still have a great future.
---
dont have to go to the bathroom if you already in the bathroom
---
wow, way to leap to conclusions.  
---
She didn't want to play on my PC. I repeatedly tried to get her to play a bit and she refused. 
---
What she did enjoy was the idea of playing together. 
---
And u thing the PVPing will be better?   This is by far the worse implemented PVP system ive ever played.  
---
Not at all. Come back in a year, I'd say. The people still holding on are the hangers on. 
---
I did, yes. I was looking for ceiling and wall mounted electrical lighting though. I‚Äôve got that fancy fusion generation in my camp, no time for candles! :D
---
'Dupers broke my graphics'
---
A QA team? You guys have a Quality Ensurance team? Which you trust, when they say that the queen is still killable?
---
 Yeah alright, good luck with that. 
---
Thank you for taking the most fun weapons away. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to have 7 absolutely useless weapons in my inventory/stash, because of the nerf. 
---
I worked so hard getting those legendary weapons, killed so many ghouls and saved up so many caps. I reworked my character around it, 600 hours of playing, out the window.
---
I promise you, that a lot of your players will stop playing when they favorite weapon all of the sudden takes thousands of bullets to take down a regular super mutant. 
---
And the SBQ is a whole other story. She is tough enough to kill as it is. Adding in 10 low level players, and she takes at least 20 minutes to take down, even with TSE weapons. She will now become impossible to the average player to take down, and exploiting the stacking of bubbleheads will now become rampant. 
---
That would be sweet.  At least 1.5X damage is where it should be.
---
Much love for the Gatling, add a black powder pistol and a sword and we're good to rumble.  
---
I've had a  lvl 50 Vampiric Gatling since lvl 60, now 190+ and its still my go to hvy gun. 7 perks into gunner, 2 bear arms, 3 martial artist,max ballistic ammo weight perk. 3 glowing sights. max Stagger and the perk for hvy guns under agility plus level 1 adrenaline. lvl 5 Gunsmith to max durability. Literally stand infront of a glowing ghoul mob and shoot all day long :)  
---
also got a furious version which is useful for narrow toe to toe encounters. A two shot version as well but it is a bit miss happy though.    
---
all one stars and never seen a 2 star gatling.
---
backup is a anti-armour 50 cal which just shreds..... anything. now find me a quad ammo, anti armour 50 cal or gatling and name your price. Not sure such a combo is even possible. On PC and serious :)  
---
love the wonky gun sight, just fits the gun so well.
---
Oh and I run Excavator with +2 str torso and calibrated shocks to carry all my toys and their ammo with me.  
---
While on the subject - does the Luck stat affect the frequency of random encounters?
---
Oh your hilarious keep talking this is gold.
---
Damn, and in my 200 levels I never entered raider armor once...
---
Even as a multiplayer, that all would have been a ton of fun.  I am looking forward to the eventual "private" servers and Creation Kit.  Once modders get a proper utility to use with FO76 we are going to start seeing a lot of interesting content.  Perhaps a modder will pick up on this and add something similar to Operation Anchorage but for West Virginia.  
---
I was thinking the opposite of your idea though.  Something where settlers from outside West Virginia start moving into the area.  Or even a FO4 style arrival of a new faction like how the BOS arrived in the Commonwealth.
---
But how can I enjoy a game without listening to a bunch of Youtubers telling me how good it is. Impossible.
---
The word birthday was not used by OP at all.
---
I'll give it a try tonight. Maybe she will adjust to it easier. She has wrist problems from her work and long stints of keyboard typing is not pleasant for her. 
---
I love how many people won‚Äôt shut up about how dupers have ruined this game but at the same time love their two shot explosive weapons...
---
I also blame the easy availability of the nuke codes.  I can understand why they set up the system the way they did, but it really trivializes the SBQ when it's so easy for people to rinse and repeat like they do.
---
A nuke was clearly meant to be a big fucking deal, but Bethesda underestimated their players on this one.  If every group who wanted to drop a nuke actually had to gather the code pieces themselves before running the silo, then everyone wouldn't be so bored of the whole thing already.
---
That said, if they make the codes harder to access, they sure as fuck better beef up the queen loot, haha
---
This is a bs post. 
---
yeah I found 2 star lever action level 45. since I had bnb one already I gave to a guy that was 44. he was happy. 
---
lvl 318 here. Was wearing PA about 200 levels, but then i collected -20% reduced aid weight and never use PA now
---
I have seen something about fixing the regular columns, these are atomic shop ones. I'd love if they were fixed, but I doubt it, since it seems someone really went out of their way to implement this "feature".  
---
DON'T YOU HATE ON FLYING FLAMINGO FORCE, WE SAVED THE GODDAMN WORLD.
---
There is definitely something funny going on with Power Armors. I once had 2 extra sets on me that I had no idea how I got. They each had a random assortment of gear. 
---
I've seen other players report shenanigans with them, as well.
---
Lel I got the *clean* space suit Saturday cause I wanted the helmet to go with my black and white tuxedo sadly when I equiped it the helmet is a dingy yellow compared to my suit üòí
---
Sounds like you are bad at sneaking, because I have no issue sneaking around other players. Also, while sneaking the player dot does not appear on the map. 
---
Pretty good actually. I see little difference from my 1080. 
---
one of the first plans I purchased . it was expensive 
---
Be careful! If your structure is complex or the ground you're on is too uneven, you may wind up placing each piece from storage manually. 
---
get 15 stamina and 15 agility if you want long fly
---
What a bitch.
---
Yes, your are absolutely correct, I was just thinking.  
---
Perhaps it was nerfed and only walks around without breath attacks.
---
Has anyone attempted to tame "Assaultron Dominator" or something. I know its obviously not a creature or animal, but just curious to see if the skill works on them.
---
I was curious on the Yau Guai...  I actually think they can take out a Deathclaw because of their very irritating knockback.
---
Yeah, lol my friend got in two nights ago and got it for 194 caps I believe, so I found out yesterday and I was pissed he didn‚Äôt just sell it to me for double price ‚Äòcause he‚Äôs low in caps or something. I will probably never be able to find Grahm which kinda sucks
---
That would be awesome as well. I just find it fascinating what we could have experienced playing through the game with the responders/BOS/freestates/raiders and Enclave still alive and how our choices would impact the world. Like depending on our choices we could have helped form an alliance between the freestates, Bos and responders to take down the Scorch menace and destroy them using all their different research on the scorch and the scorchbeasts which would have led to them defeating the plague.

My guess is ‚Äútrap‚Äù  a derogatory term for a transgendered person. Clearly this other player has some masculinity......issues

Oh I did go to the bathroom. AKA the bottle next to me.

Anyone else think bees are kinda sexy?
---
I thought the proposed patch mentioned a "Flat" 25%.  Meaning it would no longer amplify other abilities?
---
had a level 20 with a base there he had 4 missle launchers. I'm killing ghouls he kept shooting me so I killed him. went towards the back and I here missle launchers. I proceed to 2 shot his base. problem solved. then made a level 15 get rid of my wanted level Lol

Nice try Buzzfeed but I'm not doing your job for you.

You mean like these...?

It‚Äôs sadder that people even care or know what Youtubers are saying.  I haven‚Äôt a clue and why give these Youshitters traffic to their content anyways.  Just stop even discussing them.

Hell yeh. Get rid of those tighty off whiteys 
---
Oh, I don't mind the push back. I was just offerring you some advice that might free up some of your precious time.
---
I find best solution to that is to start singing take me home country road as loud and off key as you can fixes that pretty fast
---
Seriously. I‚Äôve got a guy I team with who is pretty much constantly over encumbered when out of his excavator  PA with calibrated shocks. 
---
My favorite are bounties. You can kill them before they can even do a point of damage to you (usually) and many are dumb enough to carry around large amounts of junk while wanted. Had one who had 400lb of crap.  
---
How about some Mothman underoos?
---
It's not the youtubers that have the power or the influence, it's the clicks, because clicks are the bosses of almost all of the youtubers.
---
Yes- Bravo and thanks to them!
---
Yeah just snag a keycard from a cargo bot and head to a silo. Hacker 3 on switch to take out the turrets in the silos makes it easier. You will need lockpick 3 to get to the terminal just before the room with the sentrybot. Once you handle the launch commander bit just enter the code on the keypad and launch.
---
Yeah it would. Not sure how high it is on the list of "things we need to fix, like, yesterday", tho.
---
Lmao yes!  I prefer boxer briefs, but I would settle for the superhero/tighty whity style underwear if they were clean.
---
Well, let's examine why a large caliber bullet does less damage. A larger caliber has not only more mass, but also more surface area to catch wind drag. Both of these factors combine to slow the projectile (we're lucky Creation Engine doesn't account for bullet drop!) to speeds much lower than those achieved and maintained by a smaller round.  The lower speed means that the bullet can never has as much penetrating power, and the rapid deceleration means a larger caliber round does exponentially less damage at range.

Oof i have a two shot 50 Cal 1*.

Again.
---
YOU have options. I'm not going to keep repeating myself for every scenario you bring up, because it's the same. The mechanics don't differ between your scenarios.
---
If thats the case. Leave. If you're that bothered by it and still want to play this game. Don't build anything? Use the enclave bunker for all your crafting.
---
I get the point you're making. But my point to your point is; theres shit you can do about it. Stop being lazy and do it. I'm really not trying to be mean. 
---
But given the mechanics in the game. Raiders are going to blow your shit up. It's not like I can toss a molly at you then pop you in the head with my gun and kill you then talk shit. BUT I can do that to your house ...
---
The real question should be ... how exactly do you think Raiders should be playing? What should they be ALLOWED to do, given what is already in the game? On that note, what about rival factions like the BoS and Enclave? Do you not think a BoS house would not get nuked by a Enclave solider? Or would that just be considered griefing?
---
i've a lvl 50 assassin's Dragon with explosive effect if you want it. sat in my stash and never really use it. On PC, same name as post name.
---
Clever. 
---
I use the .50 receivers because they do almost as much damage as the Hardened .308 Receivers, there's a Critical .50 Receiver to increase my VATS Crits, and making .50 ammo, I get 100 per batch instead of 18 per batch.  :-)

The term 'Literally' was so erroneously misused that a few years ago Merriam-Webster altered the definition of 'Literally'.  Now the dictionary definition of 'Literally' also means 'Figuratively'...
---
This is more accurately described as devolution.
---
I'm doing a pipe God build most recently that I am enjoying.  Pipe guns get bonuses from both pistol and rifle perks (as long as you are using a rifle stock) so you can do some cool stacking for bonuses.  This build doesn't use vats, there are some other varients of pipe god should that be your style.

If he was shooting you, wipe out his base. If you‚Äôre in PvP with a player (or they‚Äôre wanted) their base is fair game. 
---
Add Vextroa. On most days and looking for something 2 do on the game 
---
\&gt; starts with "To be honest"  
---
\&gt; isn't honest and paints the other side's viewpoints dishonestly  
---
You are right, though. This game was not what I was expecting. I was expecting a game that I could play. And for most of the first 76 days of this game I could not. Between constant server disconnects, no damage bugs, and game crashes the amount of time and progress lost was insurmountable for me. Add that my own personal progress was made meaningless to the multiplayer world as most players used XP glitches and dupes to exploit the game to their advantage. Throw in the fact that the end game is a joke, I have no other reasons to play this game now.  I WANTED TO LOVE THIS GAME. I WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT IT AS IT WAS ENVISIONED, AND THEY FUCKED IT UP.   
---
They did zero Q&amp;A, wasted doing a real beta test, and now that the launch bombed this game is going to die a slow death due to a dwindling player base. Bethesda will not stand by this product for another year pass 2020, I'd wager. So why even bother. 
---
I can't it keeps bursting into flames when I touch it (sits down on stack of papers picks one up reads S.A.F.E. massive fireball)

But it really is fun jumping off high places!
---
Might be a bit weird, but imo, harpoon gun. Sure it's a heavy weapon, but it's got serious range and does massive dmg. I got A TSE one, with bloody mess 3 and demo expert 5, it goes to 1400-1500. That's without ANY of the heavy weapon perks. Range is prolly 200-300 meters.
---
yeah which is weird cause it seems like it would be a gold mine since like 60% of power armor I see is excavator 
---
unless its a pink princess bed paint job then I will get my flaming pitchfork.....
---
Some of the big bugs are fixed but it's still a shit show. Give it 6 months at least for a more stable experience of what's available. 
---
I had a pair of CAMP Griefers hit me looking to instigate a fight so they could steal 150 caps from me.  So they started blowing up my camp. 
---
I blocked them both right away, then relogged into new server.  Will never see them again.
---
I recommend this method next time you get notified your under attack, go to map and block anyone near your CAMP.  Yes you might get an innocent or two but you will get the Griefer.  Relogging takes a few minutes.
---
Sounds like some great advice for a fun Hollows Eve outfit... if it weren't usually in the low 40's temp wise here in late October lol.
---
I've actually made a new medic character I'm enjoying that me and some friends only play when teamed together that would be mean in pvp since he can hide while everyone in his team attacks 
---
Actualy items sold are server-side not items bought trust me it's wired like that
---
There‚Äôs actually a poster in that quest that has a blue set of excavator that kinda looks like a cross between ultracite and excavator
---
For comparison, I also got TS one. I have absolutely no perks to go with it but bloody mess. Dmg is still 300-350.
---
In my late 50s now &amp; I've never slept more than 5-5.5 hours a night, and I've just in the past few years learned to take the occasional afternoon nap for 30 minutes or so.
---
Yea.. they need to nerf marsupial it pretty much shits on the jetpack.
---
This guy doesn‚Äôt understand how birthdays work. 
---
Vram usage in Fo76 is insane. I have no idea how they manage to run the game without hiccups on the minimum requirements (amd gpu 2gigs).
---
Even when I downscale to 720p, set everything to low, disable TAA and basically removed shadows via INI file, the game takes up those 2gigs instantly. 
---
Yeah, but the haters don't care as long as their shit youtube videos keep getting clicks, and the people giving the clicks are too stupid to think for themselves
---
Iiiiii dont really understand what that's supposed to mean. Its obviously not a golf outfit. And if it's supposed to be found around Whitespring, this really isnt narrowing it down...
---
God damn this game is so gorgeous 
---
Cool! Haven‚Äôt found a glowing mothman, but me and my friend ran into a scorched one in the mire.
---
I got Jack and the Beanstalk as my story
---
And then there was *another* random encounter a few feet away from the Ms Nanny where some bots were surrounding a destroyed tent. Luckily, they didn't fire at me or her until she finished the story. 
---
Its one of the many things where we see that Bethesda does listen. When the game came out with all its problems we cried for more personal communication, like we see for other games. And the mad lads from Bethesda just went ahead and did it! And they do a great job. They are really active on this sub.
---
I hate thes guys, but me explosive dragon loves them.
---
I try and hand out extra stuff all the time to no avail. Low levels always seem so scared of my mid 60s lvl guy. I mean the Sack with Hoses on my head might actually be doing it but still..
---
"reee i paid money therefore Bethesda owes me" is what it boils down to. Another child who doesn't get how the world works 
---
You may want to rely less on feels and more on facts. The issues are well documented. 
---
Also interested. 
---
It's a combo of bad mechanics and the endemic duping issue where so many people were able to acquire god tier one shot weapons.  I mean, it's the wasteland so I'm not sure any of us should expect a nice quiet life but it does seem like a missed opportunity for Bethesda to have created something that works in a space (Fallout universe) we all love.
---
I got them last night. https://i.imgur.com/89aG115.jpg
---
Done pal. I will play it in a couple of hours cause the game is going offline in about 45 min because of maintenance 
---
&gt; Pretty funny considering how many people think it's the best Fallout.
---
I'm pretty sure that's just a r/fallout thing.  Fallout 2 is definitely the best Fallout, and Fallout 3 is the best "modern era" Fallout... to anyone with a brain. :) 
---
Same problem... I am in Whitesprings, but clearly in a non spawning area, and some new self-proclaimed police players are coming now to complain. Ridiculous
---
Yeah tse nerf ;(
---
Uhh... because that is the definition of min/maxing.  In this regard, you are minimizing all non-essential damage stats/skills and maximizing all damage essential stats/skills.  
---
If you half ass min/maxing you aren't actually min/maxing.  
---
Not being a douche, just trying to clarify the definition of the term btw.
---
Literally nothing would change because multiplayer bad, griefers bad, no cutscenes bad, praise geraldo.
---
Yep!  Always nice to see!  Thank you!
---
 Haha, I'm sure. See you out back with my orbital strike beacon and dense fireproof armor sometime...
---
Ballistics 101
---
Dude... That sounds cool as hell.
---
Aww I was hoping to see your Flatwoods..
---
I've already done all quests, I wouldn't mind helping others to complete them.
---
Are they paying you guys too? The community outreach on F76 has been abysmal. Publishing a broken, game, not fixing anything and paying a few utubers to be 'Community managers' and troll reddit promising to 'tell the team about that issue' is not laudable. How about you spend less money paying your pr guys to respond on reddit, and publish accurate patch notes; and patch the game on a non-corporate approved schedule of once a month.
---
That's what my friends and I did. We did the game way once just to see and get familiar with it. Took a lot of hours and caps for fast traveling and with the code words on there, we didn't figure it out until Sunday. But we got our launch in. So glad folks post them on here and their website. Much easier with a computer algorithm doing the decoding. Maintain your sanity. 
---
Yes I have this same issue on PC!
---
First rule of chainsaw club is we don't talk about chainsaw club
---
That poor sub... those fragile little souls. 
---
They replied to me in less than a day both times I contacted them.
---
They aren't being paid, they just have absolutely no standards or expectations for games-as-a-service because they've never played one before.
---
Yeah I went into a random player's camp and saw a deathcalw outside of it and naturally panicked and dumped tse into it the owner was more chill about it bc it was clear I didn't know so now I know to always wait for it to charge me before blowing them up.
---
Lock your doors or kill them.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt nerf marsupial. I guess feel yourself like a marsupial is enough price
---
I know that feel, bro
---
U and everyone else.  Lol
---
&gt; Witchunting for dupers is not going to solve much and is putting gamers against gamers over a game littered with problems that bethesda alone is responsible for. 
---
B-b-but dupers! They're the sole obstacle in the way of the land of unicorns, rainbows, perfect game economies, balance, and server stability!
---
&gt; The game is an online game, no MMO, or online Shooter is ever perfect at launch, most of fallouts fan base are not familiar with this concept, because a large number of new features, game types can be added, or even the whole grind of the game could be changed.
---
I think this is what 90% of the people have a problem with - it's too MMOey!  For an MMO that's a really weird complaint. 
---
Happy Birthday?

Has no one found a way to actually communicate with Bethesda?  I am almost positive that the character got scooped up in some cleansing script run by Bethesda, but no one there is willing to communicate with me, much less give me any information.
---
No one has any way to actually get help from support?
---
I prefer my unyielding set for when I go looting.
---
That and I generally have my sneak build setup with it anyways.
---
I‚Äôve seen people incorporate it with strength build but yea your essentially made of glass.
---
It's more fun alone at the beginning than with friends so just hop in the game and have a great time exploring that post apocalyptic world 
---
Not sure what they are worth atm maybe 3-5k.
---
Our work around has been Alt-F4
---
The kill coulda been acidental thouh like they thought it was evil
---
100% should but i don't understand peoples fascination with others level it has zero effect on ya.
---
Just enjoy the game at your own pace.
---
This still isn't fixed? Wow...
---
they mean unyielding *sentinel*, not just unyielding.
---
SW Virginia too. Moved from WV to VA and was happy to find folks said it the same way. 
---
What you on ?
---
I wish they could also let the Devs know that work into a PvP mode is not what the game needs right now, the opposite, the game sorely needs new PvE content.
---
You ignored the important part, mate. ;)
---
&gt; Why do people assume you're not "min-maxing" at all unless you sacrifice every little thing for **more damage**?
---
You can min-max whatever you want, damage, mitigation, avoidance, recovery...
---
My Blacksmiths CAMP has workbenches on the porch, along with a Rad Shower for customers to use, but some still insist on coming in the back door for some reason.
---
I've had several players become Wanted for picking the locks, and then they get upset when someone kills them, like it's my fault.
---
Get to level 50 then see how you feel. I‚Äôm at 75 and aside from launching a nuke I‚Äôve finished all quests and I‚Äôm getting bored.... have been since level 60.
---
But at level 10 you have a bunch to do! 
---
What console? I have one, but that's only legendary effect it has being 1*
---
Why hasn't infinite load screens been fixed SINCE THE FUCKING BETA?
---
Dude. Thank you. I have the card from DFA quest cargobot. I‚Äôve just been collecting codes for a couple weeks and didn‚Äôt know when where or how many I needed. 
---
Thank you. 
---
Both u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/LadyDevann deserve all the praise they get. Always see them posting and chatting with lads here.
---
Fallout is not a game built for PvP, Bethesda simply felt the need to copy Fortnite.  They should have focused on coop PvE only, and FO76 would be so much better off.
---
They patched a lot things already and did a lot of qol stuff aswell. And when the game came out we asked for community managers to give us a way of communication. I feel like at this point Bethesda cant do much better than they are doing. They do a comparable job to other companies. 
---
Dont get me wrong, they shouldnt have released the game in the state they did. They shouldnt have screwed the CE buyers with the canvas bags like they did. Totally douchey on all accounts. But at least now they are trying to do well and we shouldnt hate on them so much anymore. We have to give them the chance to do better.
---
Or testing your network
---
To do it properly you will need to wait until all letters are on the board. I looked at how nukacrypt works and I know I wouldn't ever have solved it on my own. I would have grown bored and moved on before then
---
This would have been quite a interesting game. Experiencing the voluntary helpers doing their job, witnessing the founding of the Brotherhood of Steel firsthand, helping them to fight the Scorchbeats and ultimately witnessing the loss of them.
---
Seeing Watoga when it was under control of the Brotherhood etc.
---
I was referring to the modern Fallouts. May I ask why you think Fallout 3 is better? I like them equally so I'm not really offended. I'd just like to know. 
---
You are the first person i have heard mention this so it can't be that widespread.
---
Year 3, Day 177 of playing Fallout 76. God, do I hate this game. Every day my hate crests the peak of the previous days hate. If I had a million vaults to fill with my hate, it would not be enough. Hate. Hate. Hate. Hate.

Near the TNT domes I found a veterinarian Mr. Handy leading a pack of cats. He asked me to make sure they got to safety (I forget where), but I had to sign off and haven‚Äôt seen him since. 
---
I want a pvp mode though. I dont like the half-assed attempt of the base game. 
---
And if we look at how fast we consumed all the content so far, no new pve content could entertain us for long. The pvp will add a lot more game play long term.
---
I'm proactively blocking high caps Wanted players.  Anything more than 20 caps will get blocked.  It gets the majority of griefers and PvPers on my block list which is great.
---
oh man this is the cringiest thing I've read in a while.
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
Especially if you put them in a square or circle facing a camp fire cooking station with a few instrument chairs. I even kitted the cabin out with bunk beds and left my resources unlocked so it makes it feel like a general rest stop.
---
Tales of Appalachia has a discord group
---
I'm on there usually lfg. Trixie#4752
---
Yes, the balance is better when soloing. It feels more like a survival game. The game gets very easy with friend(s). And leveling up can be very fun, while discovering the secrets of the world. 
---
Sooner than you know, you will be a level 100+ grinder and you miss those days when you were only level 10 survivor.
---
Okay cool. is this going to be an ongoing thing with you? 
---
&gt; They do a comparable job to other companies.
---
'Can we have a roadmap?'
---
'No.'
---
On PC Platform and the last few days have been bad. 
---
Perfect 
---
Yes, you want one, but the game and vast majority of players need fresh PvE content.
---
Ghouls ignore all of that and one shot low hp players in regular armor. As do most melee attacks, rads, and poison.
---
Maybe your signed into another account ?
---
Me too.  Are we sure they exist?
---
No shooting in flight. Or you mean something different?
---
Riiight cause penetrating power is the only consideration when it comes to damage caused by a round right??.The fact is,it doesn't matter how much "penetrating power" a .308 round has versus a .50 caliber,both are going to punch right through your body...The only difference is how big of hole they leave passing through.I think it's common sense a larger heavier round is going to make a bigger hole,all things being equal with projectile design etc.
---
And while we are on the subject of "penetrating power" since that's apparently all that matters. Barret .50 Cal's are known to penetrate concrete walls/barriers and engine blocks...
---
Please stop trying to equate a GAME BALANCE DECISION to real life,it's stupid.
---
Don't worry when they add mod support the days of TSE being OP will be laughable at best ;)

Killing the wendigo is easy.  The hard part is getting the wendigo to wear the clown suit before you kill him.
---
In game under challenges there is a challenge that tells you how many hours you have logged.
---
I'll take you up on that offer.  Either tell me or message me your PS4 name.
---
I enjoyed the story more and felt it had less game-breaking mechanics.  I don't like to read anything before diving into a game, so I just play it the first time and I wander around and I just feel like I got to the casino really quick in NV and ended up getting all sorts of caps and implants from gambling and then I kind of forgot what I was doing.  Some might enjoy that, but it kind of made the game less fun for me.  
---
Besides, going from Fallout 2 as a kid to Fallout 3 as an adult was just fucking amazing and mesmerizing.  Fallout NV did very little for me, personally.  It just seemed like they moved Fallout 3 to the desert and I preferred befriending vampire cannibals in the capital. 
---
I was fighting a guy and pretty sure he had a buncha sentinel on, but the weirdest part is he was lagging all over the place idk if it was chameleon or some glitch or lag but he was hard af to kill
---
Can't fast travel directly to, unless you claim it.
---
Means I have to pay to be somewhat close... and then go to effort.
---
Or we could just wait and see. If you assume the patch is going to be a broken mess why are you even bothering?
---
There's enough negativity around without more fuel being thrown on the fire
---
Mixed comments 
---
I played for about a total of 7 hours over the last two days, no crashes. 
---
At one point, some time ago, it was crashing almost every two hours. Turns out some might have been from player exploits to dup equipment. 
---
I‚Äôve noticed less and less issues as time has gone by. 
---
The only thing I see now, other than the random visual glitch, is the 21:9 compressing down to 16;9 when tabbing out during a loading screen.  The only fix for it is a restart. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs health is way to much
---
yea thats totally a legit story... 
---
maybe dont use cheats next time?
---
Watoga high school, that event where you have to lure the wendigo with loud music(lure it slowly) and Whitspring if you can still go there(I hate that place).
---
My grandparents live in the mountains in VA, can confirm, Appa latcha 
---
Yeah, that was pretentious but you seem to be aware of it anyway so you're off to a good start ;p
---
Not anymore.
---
I place my Camp on free standing junk, for the caps, but taking the workshops has not been worth it recently.  25-40 caps for clearing, 25 to claim, and another 50 for defense.  You may come out 50-70 ahead on caps, and maybe a few resources.  
---
The ammo workshop is okay, if you can leave it and come back.  I like sunshine farms radiation free box food, but I like cooking my own food.  I have thought about taking sunshine farms, making a bunch of food, and then dropping it off in Flatwoods Overseer Container but I just haven't had the patience.
---
I know man I hate playing this game and enjoying it. What a shit launch. 
---
Don't use rocket launchers they are insanely bad just drop them on the ground.
---
Grab a good rifle with a few rifle perks and 3-5 hits in average should kill it. I do it with a shotgun but i have a perk to help with long distances.
---
I used rank3 for a while.  Its lack luster with rifles IMO. 
---
I put the 3 points into bloody mess instead.  
---
Harper's Ferry can be good too. Had an almighty battle with supermutants there yesterday, was 3 or 4 legendaries in there.

The burden is now yours to bear, you must carry it all across the wasteland and dump it into mama dolce‚Äôs food processor.

Not yet, just ran past the house with the blue plane in the yard. 60 hours first time seeing it.

I don't care if they camp here- I care when they have 4 turrets directly next to a place people farm enemies
---
Dude, I feel your pain! I just happen across one while playing, it was in the shed outside the Ranger District Office (just north of watoga).....I also annoyingly got attacked by 2 lvl 80 scorchbeasts immediately after while trying to take a photo with it, lol...so be prepared. 
---
I was on PC in White Springs Clubhouse and there was a protectron in every ghouls place. I assumed someone had just pulled them from the hotel but when I looked on the map, I was one of three people on the server and no one was close. When I started to move around they started to all clump together and had all the same mannerisms of the ghouls. The breakdown was the same as always, the vast majority where regular, a couple of one starts, and one three star. After clearing them I out I waited to see the respawn but nothing happened. Not sure if it was a error but it was a fun change.
---
if you're crafting, scrapping to skill make sure to have scrapper and super duper perks; it'll speed it up a bit
---
target the rotors, it will just crash

I was using the bunker buster (homing rocket) it did a good amount of damage per hit but it would just regenerate in 5 mins
---
I don‚Äôt mind whitesprings, for me it‚Äôs a time thing, I don‚Äôt mind when people aren‚Äôt around...totally forgot about the sons of Dane complex! That‚Äôs where I grinded my first character! Thank you. 
---
Other than that I live in watoga so I do the monster mash regularly, never seems like good exp though.
---
This. And if you're havinf trouble hitting it aim for the engines. Once one or two are down it'll just hover in place
---
How do you target be rotors it was way too high up for vats to even target 
---
I‚Äôm 30 and have been sleeping 4 hours a day since I was like 14, shouldn‚Äôt I be dead by now?
---
Camden Parks vendor bot had it for me.
---
A lot of that damage is just due to TSE weapon and Demolitions 5 though I bet.
---
No, but you'll have Alzheimer's in your 50's. 
---
Yeah bro don't use rocket launchers man. Insanely terrible things. I reccomend atleast a good rifle with the perks for it. Should pop them in 3-5 hits. Otherswise Heavy i would use Gatling or Shotgun take an auto and so on.
---
Scrap planted razor grain so it doesn‚Äôt spoil in stash and keep a stockpile for repairs 
---
Then why does everyone want the plans so bad when they can just grab a handmade rifle spawn and fully-customize it? Grab the one in Berkeley Springs, server hop until you‚Äôve got a ton, scrap them, then mod it. That‚Äôs seems far easier.
---
Yep, they announced a fix coming in this next patch (possibly)
---
Hope you did the server a favour and destroyed it all :D
---
Yup
---
I actually found that having an unyielding set
---
13 base intellect
---
Egg head
---
Drugs and food
---
I can get my intellect to about 40
---
Now this actually gives you a large ‚ÄäXL gain and I pretty much just kill supermutants at west tech 
---
I can generally get 300-350 ‚ÄäXp a kill
---
Shotgun won‚Äôt work. Every encounter we‚Äôve had the bot is too high up for most guns to hit it. Ill try to using my Gatling laser
---
He wasn‚Äôt a duper, just never dropped it at his stash. The junk was all random amounts.  
---
I'm imaging the loot Lama's from fortnite running around making the same sound as PA does now!
---
you have a spreadsheet don‚Äôt you?
---
Random question but how do you get a faction to show up w your name? I am new to the reddit
---
The notion of "don't use turrets" isn't a solution.  As they add items to the game and as we get more plans you will run out of a budget.
---
Long scope on a good rifle. The disabling the rotors will not only bring it down faster but will also bring it to a full stop mid air.
---
You can enjoy things but also want them to be better. Sadly most people on this sub seem to enjoy getting fleeced.
---
Thanks for the advice I‚Äôll try that when we retry today 
---
Okay adding now. 
---
Ok I won‚Äôt be on for a couple hours 
---
I have never heard that one XD That's great!
---
Skeet shooter will ensure you smack it trust me i use shotties for it. Only if ya want to gatling will work fine with the correct perks.
---
That's if I want to work at it, there's a straight up cranberry cobbler that's just one normal cranberry and the standard one wood for cooking. There's diseased cranberries + dirty water -&gt; cranberry juice as well. +2%, +5% for the cobbler, and the relish is +10% iirc.
---
They couldn't have unlocked 2 styles with that, a short and a long one.
---
It would be a good way of actually seeing how well perk cards do, and if they are working properly. It would be much easier to make a good build for your play style. Right now, it's just guess work
---
Same on my first nuke, I had to walk away from the computer for the day. Came back the next day and with what I learned the next attempt was much smoother and I got it done. It does live a bad taste when it's completely out of your control.
---
Nah, melee isn't op. I mean yeah, it does more damage than guns, but you know what other game melee does now than guns in? "Every single game ever made that has guns and melee.* It's how you balance the fact that you can't attack something until you get close.
---
The only way melee is OP is with a very demanding build under very specific circumstances. A bloodied build can break 1000 damage, but doing so requires multiple mutations, 7 or 8 maxed out perks, a bloodied weapon, a full set of unyielding armor, and running around with only like 30 hit points. If you want *any* survivability, you have to use what few points you have left on damage mitigation perks. There's no room for versatility. No room for qol. It doesn't work in power armor or hazmat, so your build becomes useless in a nuke zone. Yeah, you can kill anyone, and just about anything, in one hit, but all they have to do is shoot you once or twice before you get to them, or run backwards while shooting, or outnumber you. It is, without question the highest risk, most prone to death build you can possibly play, and as a result it is, and *should be* one of the highest damaging builds.
---
It‚Äôs buggy. Often times I encounter it and its way too high to hit even with a scoped rifle and long-shot equipped. Others I‚Äôve hit it once and it flies off at the speed of light to somewhere else. 
---
Others, I‚Äôve downed it with a few hits from a TSE shotgun. 
---
Reminds me of that episode of The Orville, the reddit style one where they find a society based around up votes and down votes lmao.
---
Server hopping Whitespring golf club seems to be the most efficient - the only downtime is loading screens.  Sometimes you'll end up on a nuked server, then do the golf club + 1 loop around the cottages/shops, then hop again.  Everything else is too dependent on events and other stuff happening.
---
Yeah that seems pretty fast for a big gun, but if it can deal out the damage then it can still be useful. Hell, maybe today's patch will fix weapon durability, who knows
---
Most of my perks are heavy weapons related 
---
Oh no, he's designed to commit suicide.  Afterward he has a holotape on him that subtly accuses you of murdering him.

I love how dupers are the boogieman jumping out of every shadow in r/fo76 but exploits for the launch codes are just kinda okay and a thing everyone does. Like no one actually cares about cheating, after all.

The toxicity of the gaming community is approaching a critical point.
---
You don't need those big guns.  Like everyone is saying, a rifle will take it down.  Or, wait for one to get in a fight with super mutants and they'll do most of the damage for you although it take them a while.
---
Perfect then yeah gatla will due it very easily i would carry a two shot one with ya when farming nuke cards for even easier times.

---
I mean one time I did the mission it actually dropped the Cargo crate with the key card in it. But then I had to do it again with my friend and that‚Äôs what this post is about
---
I got unyielding armor pieces in all varieties. But the main point is that you have the Perks Nerd Rage on max, Serendipity on max and born survivor on 2. This combination is insane + unyielding sentinel god like.
---
I choose unyielding cavalier for my speed build. When I'm moving with weapons with move speed while aiming legendary effect (also move speed up Perks ,no speed demon) I'm fast like flash and 90% immortal. Use an Instigating or Furious Explo Pump and you can be sure that every enemie is death after max. 2 shots while you 'fly' over there heads and shot  :) 
---
I had that happen with marsupial. I run around with a full set of mutations, had to clear almost all of them before I got rid of the phantom marsupial, then require all of them.
---
Best fleecing I've ever experienced apparently.
---
It circles around and you can hit it when it comes back near you.  They don't just hover in place.  If it isn't coming near you then you need to run towards it.
---
It was still 400 weight that the server or him didn't really need :D

It just works, as intended.

What source of news shows FO76 as anything but a flop?
---
There is a second spawn point just south of the red bridge to the north of the station.  Run up to that bridge, turn around and run back down the hill.  Something will spawn just as you crest the hill.  It might be the vendor, or ghouls, or supermutants, or the pied piper or others.
---
Because it might take you a while to scrap them just to learn the mod you want.  I wanted the suppressor mod and I never could get it by scrapping.  I finally got the plans and I made enough to scrap to get the mod.
---
Yes. You can watch this very process happen on the Discord - Appalachian Explorers. Janaszar only had a dozen cards in the hours leading up to reset, was looking for more.
---
Hey [check out this new gun](https://static-media.fxx.com/img/FX_Networks_-_FXX/845/271/Simpsons_09_06_P2_640x360_313448515901.jpg) isn't it scary and cool? Well guess what I made it for you!
---

Fair enough. Most people prefer New Vegas' story so it's interesting to hear why you prefer Fallout 3's. I think Obsidian did pretty well, especially when you remember that they only had 18 months to make the entire game.

Unless you have a stealth boy mod.

Yes, gradually over some number of days.

Cussing is one thing. Discriminatory language is another. Everyone deserves to have an environment free of bigotry.

Yeah when I made that comment about Harper's Ferry I just meant that there wasn't any interiors. Honestly this is probably so people don't complain about excessive load times
---
Bring more than one card, it's easy to miskey.
---
You're just a fucking fountain of positivity aren't you. There's a patch *literally* about to deploy in the next hour or so.
---
dont bother with it. as soon as you do it, its back in your quest log 
---
Hey! I‚Äôll try that right n
---
So you think they were building buzz for the game by letting people play a random 4 hours a day for two weeks? If all they wanted was buzz, they could have invited a few vloggers and gave them 24 hour access.
---
It's two shot... It still shoots twice. It's a flat 25% damage increase instead of a flat 100% damage increase, but that doesn't change any mechanics. It never amplified any abilities, it simply applied other abilities twice because it hit twice.
---
Actually what the notes that we saw mentioned was that it was changed from a 100% damage increase to a 25% damage increase. The word flat was no where. In fact, here's what they said and this is a direct copy/paste quote from bethesda, "With Patch 5, the damage bonus for Two Shot Legendary modded weapons has been reduced from +100% to +25% damage"
---
Ultimately this means TSE will go from 600% total weapon damage per shot to 205% weapon damage per shot, assuming you have the demolition perk. Still a hefty damage increase and still more than any other combo offers. That being said there are builds that allow you to multiply damage (such as vats and crit builds) higher than TSE builds will allow post nerf, though a good TSE gun will still probably have the highest DPS you can get.
---
Yesterday, yes they were quite busy. Rest of the time is so-so. Granted, they can't really say much, officially. 
---
I found a BOS burial site next to the road north of Huntersville (where the road turns east).  There are four open graves dug with PA suits in some of the graves and PA helmets on sticks (crosses?).
---
So why are you here other than to post bitchy remarks like this? 
---
Thanks bro. Will do it aftet the maintenance. Alt + 146. Got that shit from yeaaars agoüòÇ
---
Cheers pal. Will add you in a bit
---
I agree that it‚Äôs not doing great. But this guy just milks the internet hate circle jerk around every aspect of the game. He just regurgitates what reddit says.
---
I play mostly with semi rifle or pistol, if that's what you mean? 
---
Kat.
---
I just got a sixth one this morning by shooting it down with a TSE. It took a few hits but my very first one when I did the quest was brought down using a regular rocket launcher and when it dipped down I shot it with a regular combat shotgun until it died
---
Play the game and don't worry about what level your not or what level every one else is.
---
Please look up an actual ballistics chart or two, or google the muzzle energy for any of the calibers concerned.  Wikipedia isn't bad either.  You are adding up individual facts which can be true into an incorrect conclusion.   That said, not your fault; since FO3 Bethesda has done a ridiculously bad job dealing with gun calibers and made up their own painfully silly mod/caliber system rather than a simpler, less painful one based on reality. Whomever decided .32 caliber was both a rifle and pistol round in FO3 should be ashamed of themselves.  
---
Back to my point: A .38 bullet does less damage than a 308 because it is lighter and moves much more slowly.  Energy is determined by mass and velocity, remember?  The .38 is also about as aerodynamic as a vienna sausage.  It starts out slow and gets slower quickly.   The 308 round OTOH is a spitzer bullet, which is roughly the same aerodynamic shape as the X-1 plane... which was shaped like a rifle bullet because folks knew they flew so stinkin' fast.  
---
All of that said, Clickum I think your conclusions are probably in line with Bethesda's flawed logic on how bullet mechanics and calibers, etc. work.
---
Hmm. Mine is an explosive Gatling plasma, maybe the explosive overrides the normal effects. It looks the same no matter which nozzle is used.
---
Wish I hadn‚Äôt sold my mutant‚Äôs Gatling plasma now.
---
If they're using slurs, Bethesda has already set the bar at banning. The guys who ran around being homophobic assholes got banned. Someone using racist and transphobic slurs would likely get banned, as well, given a recorded encounter.
---
See this is what I mean your acting like a douche because I have the audacity to point out the shitshow that is this games release? Ok I see your not going to listen to common sense so good day enjoy your awful game. I'm sure you'll keep buying unfinished crap for full price the rest of your life. Oh well

They spawn randomly around the map. One is silver and the other is black.  They are basically two Eliza programs talking to each other.  I recognize some of their lines from back in the 1980's.
---
Yesterday I was in Watoga and I just had a thought pop in my head.....I should stop at this next bot hub to see if a legendary comes out of it.  BAM, a 3 star walks out and drops an awesome 1\* cane.
---
Bethesda actually investigates these claims. If you don't have unusually high numbers of rare items, they'll probably just leave you alone.
---
By that ain‚Äôt how birthdays work.
---
I'm not sure who "most people" are, but FO3 has pretty much higher reviews on any website you want to use than FONV.
---
Just because it's the cult fave on Reddit, doesn't mean that "most people" think it's better than FO3. 
---
Haha I had two 3 stars spawn next to Phoenix the other day. One dropped a powered marine leg. It was a good day

It pops up in your log constantly, no matter where you are and no matter how many times you've done it.  I finally had to turn it off in my log so I don't see it anymore.

no clue what OP is about, but my explosive Lever is miles better than my explosive assault or combat rifle

Read the last paragraph. Where I clearly ask the question ‚ÄòIs this due to duper‚Äôs or is it a game error‚Äù.

No code pieces required, you do need a nuclear key card however.
---
Ehhh, took roughly 4 hours. Wasnt too bad.
---
Nuke Watoga and do the event
---
not sure if you know this but the perk batteries included in intelligence reduces the weight of fusion cores since they're used in the gatling laser they're considered ammo :P 
---
Simply asking the question is stupid, a little bit of common sense and you would answer your own question.
---
When teachers say there are no stupid questions they are lying

You just saved my game my friend. My game ended up trying to load from Charleston and every time my game would crash. Ended up trying to set the affinity and the game would still crash. Just now tried setting cores 2-7 for my Ryzen 7 2700x and it loaded just fine. Thanks again!
---
Nice one. Thanks.
---
I feel everyone should solve it on their own at least once, but not everyone has time to do that. 
---
Yup, it's a lot of fun.  Let me know if you have any questions or are interested in a tweaked version based on your play style.  I really enjoy making builds!
---
While it's nice to be heard. Actions speak louder than words. While I love the game and support the Devs. The game has slot of broken quests. Items disappearing when dropped. Team voice chat is broken sometimes. Low level rewards are none existent thus making a alt seem like a waste of time(for me anyway). Repairing armour and weapons is way more of a chore than it should be. Stash limits, holy shit fix this shit already. Camp budgets, I have seen alot of complaints about this, personally not an issue for me, I keep it simple. I feel like all this can and should be fixed prior to more content release. New content is great don't get me wrong, but there is current content that doesn't work. Thanks guys. Again love this game but for the love of it fix it!
---
Awesome, let‚Äôs hope this gets fixed in today‚Äôs patch :)

Also, there is no .308 Combat rifle receiver in the game (yet at least).

Pretty much just what you said. Crying like a bitch on Reddit seems to make people feel important

My heavy weapons guy is an herbivore and my melee guy is a carnivore. The one eats corn soup and sweet tato soup almost exclusively while the other eats glowing meat almost exclusively. That + melee damage is too good to give up.

Yup just noticed today after scoping out what card I want to level up with and in Strength I removed &amp; re-equipped all of the cards for about an hour then all of a sudden my carry weight dropped from 1030 to 1019 to 1008 and the only things that would do that is Sturdy Frame &amp; Martial Artist (armor &amp; melee weights).  The thing is I unequipped and re-equipped those cards MANY times in an hour seeing what I can live with/without.
---
Please fix BGS, not just the Pharmacy card in this patch but ALL OF THEM, thx.

&lt;3 this

Pro-tip: capture a workshop and do your tests there. Once you know what works, either blueprint it or reproduce manually.

Sounds awesome, I'll start seeing what I can find.  I can build tier 5 melee weapons so I might have the some of the additions already, I'll have to look.

west tek always see 3 sometimes 4, and super mutants drop a lot of weapons instead of just armor.

Spotlights extend turret range.

Harpoon still falls behind the dragon, I have a TSE harpoon gun and a TSE dragon. With heavy gun cards and no rifle cards the dragon still does substantially more damage which is insane

Like at Whitesprings? Probably Whitesprings vendor. Or maybe a rare spawn he has? I know of at least one rare spawn at... Cap'n Kidd's!
---
I had that by the end of the first beta session.
---
On Right column of this sub, there is discord link. That is probably the biggest one.
---
All aiming, your hip fire crosshair will be huge. It's not that bad with class freak though 
---
scout mask + marine wetsuit I think.
---
I can get my TSE pump to over 4k damage. It's WAY overpowered for sure. Now my gfs melee build hits for about the same damage. But the difference is i have a spread, and kill everything in the direction, not one thing at once. 
---
lol you are the very definition of SPECIAL
---
what the firemans hat? the WS vendor that sells camp plans never changes inv.  I hope its not on graham and im just missing it.
---
It definitely affects aimed, scoped and hip-fire accuracy, at least in my experience, and I don't use VATS much apart from spotting enemies.
---
Range seems to be the biggest factor, the further away, the more likely you are to miss.
---
Makes sense though, for a melee mutation.
---
I had just watched a youtube video of some guy talking about all the legendary spawns in Watoga so I had it on my mind.  I think that cane drop can only be topped by the Robobrain Horde Event that triggered right in front of me a couple days ago in Watoga.  I killed the boss and then tossed a couple grenades in to weaken his minions.  the blast blew the boss corpse on top of a little building beside the Super Duper Mart.  Luckily I have the marsupial mutation, but it took me entirely too long to figure out how to get on top of that building to loot him.  He had a 1\* wooden armor leg piece that gave -15% damage from animals....
---
The weapon they were using was definitely an explosive shotgun of some kind. I will say that on the instance that I‚Äôm talking about, I had a 10 cap bounty (accidentally stole from someone‚Äôs aid drop without realizing, I gave the contents to them when they came by). So the one shot is understandable, but the fleeing immediately after taking my stuff isn‚Äôt.
---
Are you swedish?
---
I think a team of people is handling this game. Different groups have different responsibilities.

Do you think a triple-A game with nearly 100 developers would have two customer service people total?
---
I was level 56 with 105+ hours clocked.. then finished main missions, found every location and started to level like crazy. Now level 112 (150+ hours)
---
Players still find more problems, due to the sheer numbers involved

Plus like, testers probably wouldn't have tried duping stuff, lol

Yup. Ran through yesterday. Five Legendary SMs with stars. Two with name only.  
---
Id be shocked if there was a plan spawn there i didnt know about. No need to do any more guesswork either.
---
I think I just learned a new cusp word.
---
No they're just rare. Encountered one on my lvl 14 toon yesterday at The Whitespring. 
---
Curses. Foiled again!
---
&gt; My argument is that staying alive the whole time and putting consistent rifle damage
---
I play with ~30-50% hp on my toons most of the time and I have no problem with surviving at all. Adrenal reaction pairs very well with healing factor. If that sounds weird to you, then consider that keeping yourself at ~50% rad damage means you keep lots of damage up while also getting healed very quickly from healing factor. You're not invincible, but you're pretty damn close, and you can just use a stimpack/radaway as needed if things get risky.
---
Had this issue before, really would be nice to have a prompt but it is what it is (hopefully temporarily) I'd suggest submitting a ticket, the team was pretty responsive and gave me a full refund, good luck :)

Yea I know but she wasn't.  And even when she did land not everyone piled on.   It's been said by others "people hide in the shed".

You cannot ever let your guard down with this game.  I've had it eat my entire suit of armor while fast traveling and then drop me down in the middle of a group of supermutants.  Lost the entire contents of glassed cavern when my character got stuck inside the body of a dead scorchbeast within sight of the exit.  Spent an hour clearing my first nuke silo only to get booted from the server while running towards the SBQ zone.  Fell in love with my first Atom shop item only to have a patch glitch it out a week later and never fix it again.  Just keep your guard up and your heart a frozen cinder if you want to survive.

Good for a VATS heavy gunslinger build. Just max Luck and Agility and Crit for days/Heal for days.
---
Patch notes or riot! :)
---
I just reached lvl 51 and I've been playing since B.E.T.A. Plenty of lowbies still running around. 
---
Devils Advocate time:
---
Its called C.A.M.P. not B.A.S.E. or H.O.U.S.E. or C.A.S.T.L.E., etc etc etc.
---
Its suposed to be just a little camp for you to put up some basic necessities. Like the overseers camp. We really don't need more room if thats the intention.
---
That being said.. I want more room anyways! T.T

#letmebuildacastle
---
Weight limit does suck but having a mule character helps out just a pain in the ass to having to keep switching characters to change gear or get junk items....don‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt adjust this issue right away 
---
The people still defending this game are delusion fake news types, or the loved ones of Bethesda employees. No unbiased person with two functional brain cells is still playing this game. 
---
Its not a saw, its an excavator.
---
Just bulk your junk and sell whatever you dont use or need. 
---
Just woried about your sanity. When the game came out almost lost mine's trying to solve a bravo code
---
Not sure what the praise is for.  Community asks for bug fixs, quality of life improvements in the game, content and events and we get our favorite weapons nerfed and a pvp mode that almost no one wants.
---
I can craft marsupial serums and I give them to players who are, what I deem to be, nice.  I had to chase this boy around Whitesprings before the update today just to get him to trade with me, and I was literally yelling, "stop running, I have the hoppy potions for you!"
---
It worked out in the end.
---
On pc my mouse does not properly get locked to the game and if my move my mouse it goes onto my other monitors, when firing this causes the game to minimize due to clicking outside the game
---
The only enemies I don't really overkill are scorchbeasts, which require more than an initial shot to put down. But I understand your point. Even though radium rifles aren't very sought-after and I'll be paying 1.2k for the modding, how about 1.5k for 2.7 total?
---
Boooo. It's 2pm here in England and I've got a free hour. 
---
Seriously though, looking forward to seeing what is being addressed today.
---
yeah the gameplay loop is almost non-existent...shoot things, craft ammo, get zero rewards. 
---
I hope it will fix the crashes I recently had. I could barely play yesterday. 
---
Now that is some *targeting*
---
Pretty much.... I got rid of mine a long time ago and only recently tried to use them again. They shoot a minute of bullets at three ghouls and barely graze them while they destroy a lot of my exterior camp items. I just gave up on them again.
---
Using a non legendary dragon I can twoshot them out of the air, pretty sure you just lack damage. 
---
Yup. Imagine the positive difference the Reddit hive mind could make in the world if it didn't just do nothing but bitch about games it doesn't like and shitpost all day
---
or patch notes then a riot?
---
You spent waytoomuch% of your time calculating that out to make the guy feel bad. 
---
Do people not understand how to use inventory management, I gotta ask something do you have 1000 of each junk? 20 useless legendaries you'll never use? That 3rd PA set? 
---
I've put 200 hours into this game I've yet to have a stash problem, it's quite simple just don't keep crap you don't need at that moment in time and don't be a damn horder that keeps every bobble head to teddy bear 
---
Berserkers? You listed the effects for Executioners.
---
[Smell 100] [Sneak 0]
---
I had that one but she was telling it whilst I was taking down the scorchbeast south of whitespring.  one of the most surreal things I have ever seen :)
---
Just tap the jetpack button as you fly, I can cover a lot of ground doing that.
---
It just makes it more challenging.  What? Do you want infinite storage? What do you need with all that junk? 
---
I take it there are no plans for these mods?
---
Thank you Bethesda ! Keep up the good work :)
---
If you're having issues with stash weight, you have poor resource management. I have legendary weapons and armor, a copious amount of aid, power armor frames, and enough junk to repair everything I have for a very long time in there...and I'm still sitting around 500/600 most of the time.
---
It's a bit of a learning curve from previous Fallout games, but hey...adapt and learn. 
---
iirc it doesnt tell you that it also allows you to be crippled much easier. ive been running adimantium skeleton since ive got that mutation.
---
i'd say nothing beats a nice juicy WestTek clear with high INT. Pop those berry mentats, CB broiled brain (or at least brain fungus soup) and the go medieval on those supermutants.
---
with \~17-18 INT (base+berry+brain/soup and Well Tuned) a single lvl 68 mutie gives around 220 EXP and there's like 30 of them. Area is not very large, there's ample of anything to loot aswell. And decent chance for legendary (max i've seen is 3 total, rarely without any)
---
This is awesome ‚ù§
---
Glad the two shot got nerfed
---
RIGHT!?
---
Foundation piece.  Goto your Wood Foundation, and click right it should show the variation to you at that point.
---
It took me a while to figure it out as I thought it was rug/carpeting.
---
I honestly I don't remember, I got it about 50 levels ago lol
---
Then people would just put all their caps on an alt and run around being a dick without ever getting a bounty lol
---
Have the devs tested why the Queen gives loot to some but not all? I have a feeling is b/c it's global loot not instanced for the player. 
---
No.
---
I've been there, I'm sorry.  I actually had one recently where I got the servers not responding msg, and then they actually recovered -- and then my PS4 bluescreened.  It was like the game pump faked me.
---
Op is just a cry baby lol
---
Explosive Nerf x2?
---
Gah I can‚Äôt wait to get home now and I just got to work. So basically every other Tuesday, but still
---
I find your lack of substance addiction disturbing
---
So the stash, camp and caps limited is still the same? That must be a f\* joke?
---
Ive searched every possible, non-bug abusing, way to eliminate weight when i was playing more at release.
---
I optimized everything with perks, bulking, throwing away and selling.
---
The problem is that it is not fun to play this way. I want to fight ghouls and raiders. Not the weight limit.
---
Currently whenever i see something all i see is its weight stats and how im gonna be hopping from loading screen to loading screen to sell it for caps i wont use, or simply will throw it away again.
---
To be honest, photomode is probably one of my favourite features in 76.
---
 I've spent way too much time just taking photos in 76 than the time I have spent exploring and scavenging.
---
Has anyone actually found any positive sources?
---
No not sarcasm, curiosity 
---
I can't imagine myself shitting into a bottle.
---
I had this problem, until I engaged with the online community buying and selling.  They‚Äôll buy that excess junk, the heavy ammo, those extra chems, and those low to mid tier legendaries that are almost good enough to use. 
---
Bethesda didn't ever had to balance their game for multiplayer, that I can understand.
---
what is harder to forgive is that they absolutely didn't consider any of these issues before launching a multiplayer game. These are glaring gameplay issues.
---
No stash space increase?
---
Probably playin' it like FO4. Can't be a hoarder in this game! :P!
---
Nah, its not so bad. We get a group of 10 or so people going and make a day of it.
---
&gt;Please don‚Äôt allow broke players to accumulate bounties.
---
Yeah, because broke players going around and griefing and killing people with impunity and never getting wanted is so much better....
---
üòÇ
---
Just gotta figure out what you think is important and what isnt. Simple as that
---
u need turn of and on them. after will work.
---
&gt;Plans and Recipes: When viewing a plan or recipe in a menu, a ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù tag will now appear next to the names of recipes and plans the player has already learned.
---
WE DID IT BOIS
---
This just happened in my world. Some high level was terrorising me and other players destroying our houses. He had a 400 cap bounty and dropped 20 caps, kind of silly.
---
fixing TSE did not require breaking TS and E individually.  Threw the baby out with the bathwater on this one.
---
Dont pick up everything then. Take what you need.
---
No, If they are capturing the workshop at the same time as you, they are red but you do no damage. It becomes who has the most time spare...
---
Some very impressive and welcome things in here
---
I've literally never seen a red light as far as tactical ops go (Red lasers is not the same thing as red lights) where did you get that fact? 
---
im gonna be pissed if i go to repair my armor with white knight and it costs more that 1 ballistic fiber.
---
My wife also informed me that ‚Äútrap‚Äù in other communities means ‚Äúcrack‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy head‚Äù 
---
I get told I'm being reported all the time for "cheating" because 2SE don't kill me lol. I'm still not banned. Long as you don't cheat, you should be just fine. Hell, people who stack bobble heads or have bought known Duped items haven't been banned. Just Dupers thus far.
---
I found them on graham as well.
---
Hunter/hunted announcement and weight limit to fight dupers, nice one! 
---
Guesss I should‚Äôve added *and don‚Äôt allow broke players to aggro other players or damage camps.*
---
I honestly don't know anyone who says it with an "sh" sound... but I am from Tennessee, so I may not have the best test sample.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck.  Goddammit, Bethesda.
---
Find friends it gets better.
---
It's like a studio releasing a film: if they feel confident in what they're doing they'll announce it for review ahead of time
---
Sometimes he is leading a pack of Molerats, sometimes it's dogs.
---
I have encountered both, and I've seen the full set of Raider PA several times, but never entered one.
---
well at least one-shoting Tse shotguns are a good way to hide the subpar gunplay and netcode.
---
At least 15 or 16.
---
Since that shed is the [exit from Glassed Caverns](/spoiler), why not just have scorched spawn in there? If you need a safe place for a moment, the roof is doable but low levels won't want to be up there. 
---
Yeah, it's a nice spot. Pretty centrally-located, not near any nuke sites or enemy spawns... just nice and quiet.
---
love the changes, keep it  up.
---
If people can't figure out carry weight after this.....seriously. 
---
One of the most memorable fights I‚Äôve had was with a guy with chameleon who was trying to steal my workshop.  I rolled up in PA with explosives so I could blow him to pieces but he could one shot me and he was stealthed so it was difficult to spot him.  It was really exciting popping mentats to raise perception to spot him better as we faced off.  We went back and forth until I finally won by killing him a few more times than he killed me.  It makes me want to try a build like that to terrorize players.  I did end up winning in the end but that isn‚Äôt to say it was a pretty cool build.
---
And even with spotlights the turrets ignore targets.  Or only target friends.  Your point is moot.  
---
The smart players who enjoy MMO's team up and share perks. It's like we're carrying nothing at all!
---
That's not right. The trap is the place where people sell their drugs. That's why you hear the terms trap house ( meaning a house where drugs are sold) or rappers calling them self trappers (drug dealers)
---
Does a loot limit really feel like a challenge to some people? Because to me its just a bore. 
---
Welp ok then keep up the good work! 
---
This is what I did, except I didn't need to wait until all of the letters were solved. I figured it out based on usually 1/3-completed words since Bethesda uses really long/complex words and very few things can realistically fit the remaining letters once you have a few. It was a fun first experience, but now I use Nukacrypt's codes to save me the time.
---
Any fixes to Flamers, Crylators, Gatling Plasma weapons so they don't break in 40 seconds of use?
---
Also, why no changes to Gunsmith perk to bring it inline with all the other perks you just nerfed? Its 5 points for 50%.  It should be 3 points for 60% according to BethLogic.
---
Paper Bags:¬†Fixed multiple issues in which transferring items into an empty paper bag as the bag was despawning caused those items to become lost.
---
Thank God. Lost so much ammo this way 
---
TIL  thanks! 
---
Yeah, they aren't dupers. They're beta-cheaters. Beaters.
---
What? I thought the bounty was paid from nowhere, just like quest rewards? That's stupid if it's not
---
the main problem of the turrets is not the damage, more like the acuracy and the low hp.
---
That's OP, the new player is the one in the Vault suit and party hat...
---
Massive nerfs 
---
So nerfs to Demo Expert when actual explosive weapons (rocket launcher, fat man, grenade launchers, etc.) were already a joke, nerfs to things like White Knight that absolutely *did not* need to be nerfed, a guaranteed source of Ultracite PA plans to make it sting that much more when all you get from the SBQ is Ultracite PA plans, and more...
---
Sure, there are some nice fixes in here, like the Explosive legendary effect nerf and the "known" tag, but on the whole, I'm very disappointed.
---
Special PvP vendor that you get credit at. Payment in caps from players credit at the vendor
---
Fair point.  Still just wanted to point out Bethesda has a bottlenecking issue with CAMP items in the Atom Store for super builders/collectors.
---
Yeah this is a strategy that‚Äôs growing in popularity. Basically,off load all caps so that you don‚Äôt lose anything yet gain the caps of the sorry fool who comes to collect your bounty while your two buds hide and wait. 
---
It would actually be better If the game paid you caps for killing/ collecting the bounty but they are put on a credit hold of sorts ... "garnished" until there negative debt was paid off.
---
I bought some from Grahm last night
---
Soooo if the ultricite armor is being added to the terminal, did it get removed from the SQB's loot list?
---
Again, I don‚Äôt argue that the game isn‚Äôt doing well and Bethesda has a lot to do. I don‚Äôt expect any positive news sources. My problem with it is that no ‚Äúreal‚Äù news sources are talking about it anymore to the extent that these youtubers keep at it. It‚Äôs nothing new, it‚Äôs just click bait conjecture. An expensive jacket speaks more to the reality business executives are realizing. gamers are loose with their money and trying to cash in on it. I don‚Äôt think it has anything to do with the 76 developers and is hardly a sign of the future of the game. It‚Äôs greedy, but vote with your wallet if you want it to stop.
---
I can wear my rose dress again! üåπ
---
Thank you for the info Beth. :)
---
Wouldn't the smarter solution then be to have bounties have a fixed amount of caps that are independent of the players wealth, and then when they are killed apply X% of their actual wealth to that amount?
---
So player Bob has 10,000 Caps.  He accidentally blew up a player structure when he threw a grenade at a Super Mutant and now has a base bounty of 10 Caps and 2% of his personal wealth.  When you kill Bob you would get a total of 210 Caps. Same scenario only Bob has 0 Caps; you still get the 10 you decided was worth killing Bob over.
---

---
Super NSFW due to language, but it'll give you a crash course.
---
a single radrat destroy it notime...
---
Personally, Im of the opinion that if you dont have enough caps for your bounty it should start taking some of your non-junk.  Start with random aid items that sell for the needed amount. If you dont have enough of that, it should start dropping unequiped armor, then unequiped weapons, then equiped items. That way theres no way to cheat the system. If you dont want to lose your good shit, you make damn sure you have caps to cover your bounty. Or enough aid items to act as a buffer.
---
The fact that you cannot hoard stuff is the entire reason that kills this game for me.
---
I want to hoard stuff. I did it in every bethesda game, and the fact that its killed entirely in this game feels arbitrary.
---
Very good to see you guys working hard to patch out exploits. Good job and keep it up!
---
Yes, but at a high cost. The reloading of this weapon is just not worth it IMO. The harpoon is, in this case, a compromise(some reload speed increase, some dmg decrease). Infinite ammo is an added bonus, too.
---
Nope, if the player is broke you get nothing. Or as many caps as they have left. So, if they have a 100 cap bounty but only have 5 caps, all you‚Äôre getting is 5 caps off the kill. 
---
So what you're saying is we need the BB gun back.
---
Well fuck.
---
There goes my last incentive to create my fatman spamming character
---
Patch notes *and* riot!
---
Two Shot was not the issue. Explosive was. Two Shot didn't need to be nerfed.
---
It feels like bug abusing and people say stuff like this is killing the servers.
---
So i dont want to use this.
---
It's an integral part of being able to launch a nuke, the one you can't skip by just going online. They're not going to make it easy. 
---
Chip kelly?
---
I always felt the combat rifle should be more of the work horse style rifle. Easily modifiable and effective in the roles it fills, but not out classing. Does the handmade count as a pipe weapon? I forget, I never really get to use one.
---
Go buy a good game... Seriously Bethesda has no reputation left to trash at this point.... R wait until they ban you for modding their game to fix the problems they are to lazy to 
---
&gt;Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
2* exploding flamer for sale!
---
Give it a 24 hour timer, once you kill someone, you cannot enter pacifist mode for 24 hours.
---
You can put the counter in the status menu like the other perks.   I just ignore people now, and server hop if there are too many toxic people on the server.
---
&gt;Vendors: Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans. 
---
Does this mean I'll finally be able to get my hands on the barn building set that's been eluding me all this time? Providence!
---
Lots of great quality-of-life fixes in this patch, thanks!
---
This kind oof comment is why I live for reddit.
---
Happened to me once. Ended up gettong 10 caps off a 2000 cap bounty.  
---
Its bs.. It shouldnt exceed whats avalible. Or force them to lose an item at random, if they dont have enough caps to cover the cost.
---
This.
---
Cane here wondering what was up with the 3.4GB Xbox update.
---
Status info can be found here: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/317557/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-january-29-2019?language=en
---
Thanks for this!
---
No fix for M79 and auto grenade launchers not benefitting from Bear Arms or Ordinance Express, and a general nerf to **non-legendary** explosive weapons like grenades and grenade launchers and missile launchers via Demo Expert nerf.
---
Hate it.
---
They could easily do this if they make flashback events that take you back to when each group was dealing with the problems we discovered in the base game.
---
Great work, but is there any chance of set servers in the future? It would be nice to actually create a community that stays constant.
---
HUZZAH!!!! THEYVE SAVED THE TEDDY BEARS!!!
---
Bethesda allows TS and E to be on the same weapons and created a crazy high damage situation, so instead of removing possibility of this they punish everyone who doesn't have a TSE weapon.  My main two weapons on my rifleman char just became almost worthless... two shot lever and explosive pipe rifle.  Since TW and E are now so much weaker, all that has happened is that TSE is now almost required vs being preferred.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like it .
---
Get weight reducing legendary Armor, I have 1 Str I doubt you do too. 
---
what you really need is a mule character to offload stuff onto, you can't keep a non-weightless armor set besides the one you wear. 
---
you don't have a bunch of burnt books or anything right?
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. I need my whitie tighties that say "mountain momma" on the booty
---
Nope caps are taken from the player with the bounty. If they have leas or none then thats what you get. 
---
Lots of these "pvp" bountys are atoring caps on a mule or with a friend and just going out with no consequences.
---
Because you don't have real life? Or, may be, you have never played fallout 2,3, nv? 
---
Yah that is exactly what I have thought a lot about and have said on this subs before. I rather have had 76 be a cooperative co-op kinda game with the events of the game taking place before the plague scourge, during the faction beef and espionage and raider threat and etc. Where our characters would get to do quests and talk to living people, get to choose and influence events, get to be living and taking part everything when it happened, deciding what factions to help prepare for or defend against the scourge and take over appalachia and things of that nature. It'd be cooler than just hearing about it in holotapes after the fact.
---
But they get a debuff that lowers their PvP damage by like 50%. It's not as much as a full payout, but still. I think instead of not acquiring bounties, maybe you start dropping stuff other than junk which has a value equal to the bounty you can't pay.
---
The entire bounty system needs to be reworked. It's near impossible to get rid of a bounty if you get one say by protecting someone's base. 
---
You've seriously put some thought into this and personally I love the idea (and also your Modus dialogue. It's perfect.)
---
&gt; both the explosive mod and two shot weapons could result in dealing very high amounts of damage, and this was compounded if two shot and explosive were combined.
---
Yeah, that was the fucking point. SBQ fights are going to suuuuck now.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm on xbox
---
A grade 36 bureaucrat named Hermes probably "optimized" the QA process &amp; department, having all the work done by a single Australian man. I imagine he is doing his best, but could use some help.
---
**[PSA]** We will start working on the ***Community patch notes*** as soon as we make sure that our tools read the files correctly. We also plan to live stream our whole workflow once we are ready, for those that want to take a look in the inside of the engine and answer questions on how things work.
---
You can always find the latest notes at https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/
---
If you pay regardless of ability to pay, without keeping a debt they have to pay off, they'll just join a game with friends.
---
Players 1 &amp; 2 rack up bounties they can't pay, then kill each other. They then trade with player 3 to offload caps, rinse and repeat. Free money.
---
If they do something like this, there needs to be a debt they have to pay off before collecting more caps.
---
Good patch, however durability on items like Laser and Gatling Plasma is still not fixed and they break after 3-4 magazines. When can I finally use these weapons reliably?
---
thank you bethesda. griefers can enjoy this nerf the most :D
---
üëç to duck mutations!
---
I concur!! Not nearly enough storage. Having a cap limit is outrageous and camp budget should definitely be increased or budget cost for defensive items reduced. 
---
&gt;Scrapping: Loose weapon and armor mods are now protected from autoscrapping when crafting. However, they can still be scrapped manually if a player wants to break them down into scrap components.
---
Yeah I dont understand the Ultracite PA thing. You get a whole armor for free and the plans through SBQ. Seemed like a good system.
---
This sounds about right.
---
Nerf to White Knight made sense. After finding out White Knight, my armor broke so slow that I started to forgot durability of armor. When you don't need to repair armor, that also means that junk now becomes less valuable. And if there are no means to go out and find things, then there is no means to be active. 
---
&gt; The damage bonuses provided by each rank of the Demolition Expert perk have been reduced from +20%/40%/60%/80%/100% to +20%/30%/40%/50%/60% to match other weapon perk damage bonuses.
---
So why not just make it a 3-Rank Card (20 / 40 / 60) instead of a 5-Rank Card? Why not split it into 3 Cards like the other weapon types? This change makes absolutely no sense; clearly devs firing from the hip in some addle-brained attempt to balance the game.
---
&gt; **Belly of the Beast:** A new  ‚ÄúUltracite Power Armor‚Äù entry has been added to Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal on  the top floor of Fort Defiance, offering Ultracite Power Armor plans to  those who read it. 
---
So what exactly is the point of the Scorchbeast Queen now? The game is currently lacking in end-game content and fighting the queen to get the plans was kinda it. Does she drop other power armour plans instead now or double the ultracite armour mod plans?
---
You left out nocturnal.  It‚Äôs underestimated.  It‚Äôs only good half the time but when it is that time, it‚Äôs damn good.  The base damage is lower during the day so it‚Äôs useless theb but if it happens to be at night then you can get a pretty nice damage bonus which might be worth it carrying around if you happen to be out at night.  I have a nocturnal explosive dragon and it‚Äôs already incredible with no rifle perks and just the explosive damage with demolition expert.  However, since I use it as a back up weapon, I can whip it out at night and do a stupid amount of extra damage from the nocturnal effect.  It can totally be worth it though it‚Äôs situational.
---
Nice patch, glad to see a lot of these fixes! Especially pumped to learn that retroactive cooking recipes will be fixed down the line!
---
As usual, here's my compiled list of bugs and a few wishlists.
---
For anyone interested, here is my [first list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a575z2/fallout_76_patch_notes_december_11_2018/ebkrjo0/?context=3)/[second list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a83nxr/fallout_76_common_issues_and_solutions/ec8eabn/?context=3)/[third list]()
---
***Bugs***
---
* Flamers have their range incorrectly listed as 200+ when they clearly do not reach that far (some legendaries are exceptions, strangely enough, like Explosive Flamers)
---
* Protest signs incorrectly benefit from Gladiator and not Slugger, despite clearly being 2-handed weapons
---
* Aqcuire Diseases challenge does not count Sludge Lung correctly
---
* Perk cards can come unshared if you are relying on temporary charisma benefits (ex: Herd Mentality/chems/food/armor) to share higher star cards. For example: you have 9 charisma, and a +3 buff for 12. If you try to share a 4 star card, it will become unshared quickly after sharing, but if you share a 3 star card, it will stay shared like normal
---
* When a Snallygaster is dismembered, the limb (most reproducible with the head) will revert to a white textured limb regardless of the original color of the mob (like a black glowing variant)
---
* Snallygasters and Wendigos can fail to ragdoll upon death, they will perform passive animations until looted, after which they will correctly ragdoll
---
* Weightless metal armor chest piece doesn't reduce weight correctly, standard unmodded is 5.50, "weightless" is 4.95
---
* Weightless legendary effect does not apply to weapon/armor mods that add weight when attached
---
* When either of a Gulper's legs are crippled, their model will glitch and [fold in on itself](https://imgur.com/a/kFe5BcW)
---
* There is a locked door in the Mothman Museum that is on the ground, when unlocked it [opens and clips into the floor](https://imgur.com/a/ehsrGNy)
---
* As of 1/10 patch, when trading with another player and using Z/C to move the quantity slider, it no longer stops at zero and wraps back around to the highest value
---
* While in fullscreen mode, if you alt-tab during a loadscreen the game resolution lowers significantly until the game is restarted
---
* Changing audio device while the game is running makes all audio silent until the game is restarted
---
* Electrically Charged will use the Unstable Isotope rad visual effect instead of the electric visual effect if your teammate has Unstable Isotope
---
* When a lightbox is destroyed, the portion that contains the colored light is still visible and floating in the air
---
* Legendary Auto Grenade Launchers do not display their affix as part of the name (ex: they aren't named 'Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher', just 'Auto Grenade Launcher')
---
* Damaged Mainframe Cores are unable to be moved as a stack, you must transfer each one individually
---
* When picking up a magazine, it fails to display the item description/message on screen (like how Bobbleheads do), the only magazine I have seen do this correctly is Tesla Science 3
---
* Scorchbeast Queen can sometimes fail to regenerate, unclear what causes this
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Ability to mark any junk item as non-auto scrap
---
* Repairing a crop should not require said crop to repair it, as you cannot store spares
---
* Give the "downed" position a 3 second grace period so that Mysterious Savior/Life-Saving has a chance to proc. You can often get downed and then instantly die before these even have a chance at working
---
* Ability to hotkey specific emotes
---
* Sort holotapes (when loading them into a terminal) either alphabetically, or put quest tapes/US Requisition tapes at the top. Preferably both
---
* Camp food objects (just static visual decorations), crafted from their food item so that we can set the tables in our camps! 
---
* Ability to see radiation levels of non-teammate players
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Allow us to turn in Mr. Fuzzy's in exchange for Mr. Fuzzy Tokens, 3 tokens a day is an extremely slow rate (we shouldn't need to server hop to earn them faster)
---
* Scorchbeast Queen needs more loot for when you have every prime plan, she isn't worth killing once you know them all
---
* Reduce the mod durability loss for flamers; they are niche to begin with, and modding every part of a flamer results in about 50% durability loss - this heavily outweighs the benefits of slightly higher damage and ammo capacity.  
---
Paper bags fixed! GOD BE PRAISED!
---
Glad I held onto my ultracite TSE laser pistol now that the ash pile glitch is gone. 
---
Does...does this mean... I can buy a handmade plan? At level 70? Is that what this means?
---
IS THAT WHAT THIS MEANS?
---
rad x no longer stacks..... excuse me but if i did a syringe of morphine and then did another one id either feel more effects or od how does that make sense
---
Or some way to make laser or plasma weapons (arguably some of the coolest weapons in fallout) actually viable?
---
Aha ye we‚Äôre defo on the same wavelength. Like the world as it is now could have been one of the endgames where we made the so called bad choices and is now an empty wasteland. IMO this could have got Bethesda back on track in making better role playing games as it would have left loads of opportunities for choice and consequences. 
---
I'm pretty sure it's a limitation of their engine
---
Early Warnings, finally!
---
Though I wonder if those of us currently impacted by the bug will be able to go fetch the parts to craft the upgraded motors again? 
---
``Carry Weight: Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character‚Äôs current maximum carry weight.``
---
This will probably be a huge hindrance to dupers, they literally cannot store vast quantities of items any more
---
Should lose an item from there inventoey at random from the weapons and armor tabs only imo. If there going to dump caps just to avoid the consequences.
---
Only thing I disagree with is making Rad-X no longer stackable.
---
&gt; **Hunter/Hunted:** A server-wide message will now appear when a player joins the Hunter/Hunted queue. 
---
Is that for everyone on the server or just those listening to the radio channel?  I really don't want to see that every time Johnny Doe wants to PVP.
---
For the lighter side of wasteland life...
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
r/fo76bearhunt
---
Awesome...but.
---
Where's the fix to the Mire Event Apparel having a literal 0.02% chance of dropping? 
---
Fookin Preeeeeach 
---
Kinda agree. Aside from prime recievers and ultracite mods there's no point to run sbq now once you have the achievment/trophy
---
Please for the love of West Virginia let us scrap ammo. PLEASE. 
---
Well damn. An update on consoles too? I thought they were staggering them by a few days 
---
My Belgian keyboard thanks you.
---
Same problem. If caps are depent upon rhr bounty actually having anything..
---
While we are discussing the rad shower, does the button on yours work? The button on mine is nonfunctional. When connected to power its always on. The one in Fallout 4 worked. I had to connect it to one of the wall mounted switches to turn it on and off. 
---
&gt; * **Map:** Character levels no longer appear truncated on the map for players over level 100.
---
&gt; * **Plans and Recipes:** When viewing a plan or recipe in a menu, a ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù tag will now appear next to the names of recipes and plans the player has already learned.
---
NICE.
---
&gt; **Performance:** Launching the Traditional or Simplified Chinese game clients on Xbox One no longer causes a 6 second hitch when the launch video begins to play.
---
ÊúÄÂêé!
---
This would be a much welcomed change. Do the same with makeshift warrior. 
---
Only took then 3 months.  
---
&gt;**Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.  
---
&gt;The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is based on player level and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
---
Does this mean jetpack plans won't be super fucking rare?
---
&gt; **Belly of the Beast:** A new ‚ÄúUltracite Power Armor‚Äù entry has been added to Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance, offering Ultracite Power Armor plans to those who read it. 
---
I hope the plans got removed from SBQ's loot table.
---
Fix, Fix, Fix, Nerf.
---
It does, anyone saying otherwise is spreading lies and never actually tried it themselves. I know from personal experience it does affect XP and here's a thread with proof. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3bgy1/psa_intelligence_increases_xp/
---
If you look at that you'll find each point in intelligence give a 3% XP bonus on kills and crafting.
---
Would you please just make energy weapons useable already?
---
Just recipes and plans, not mods, right? So its still rng to get the XO1 jetpack. Will any vendor reliably sell PA jetpack plans now?
---
It didn't need to be when the actual problem was with the Explosive effect and the damage scaling from Demolitions Expert. 
---
My dear quad explosive single action revolver has just passed away... most probably
---
Confused about the "Structures" bit for CAMPs. Does this mean I can now delete and move pieces of upper flooring connected by stairs?
---
Lot of good things here.
---
For me: 
---
Pros: Traveling Pharmacy, Plans marked as "known"
---
Cons: Super Duper and White Knight perks.
---
Not sure, we had a dragon that dealt 400 damage with multipliers from perks 
---
Sea of Thieves was a flop when it was released. Look at it now. They released some major additions free of charge and it's a pretty popular game now.
---
If Bethesda gets their stuff in gear, 76 is gonna be a great game.
---
I lost my food and water.  And my camp.  On Saturday I lost connection five or six times.  (I'm on PC. )  Before I logged out after my last log in, I noticed my camp had disappeared.  I didn't remember seeing the message about it being unable to be placed.  I logged in again on Monday, and my camp was still missing, and there was no message.  I decided to move it.  It didn't cost me to place it, so that was recognized.  Usually there is a bug that causes multiples of the different crops to be under stored, along with other misc items doubled.  This time that did not happen.  None of my plants were stored.  Neither were my water purifiers.  I was missing a couple of other items too.  A guitar, two or three signs and four lights.  I've never seen that happen.  Like I said there is usually doubles of items.  I've never lost  items like that.  Maybe there was an update to cause this?
---
They can still buff normal explosive weapons seperately. I hope they do thus in a future patch. Would love to play an explosive build some time.
---
Like we have all this marketing about rebuilding life and America itself and it would have been cool to see you help ally the different factions together and help rebuild the world. Also would have been interesting meeting some of the cool charecters we‚Äôve heard about like that private investigator and that person searching for criptids for her father. We could have had some amazing side quests 
---
&gt; Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.
---
&gt;&gt;Licensed Plumber is OP
---
Lmao Plumber is a Noob-Trap for people struggling with Weapon durability who waste there pre-50 perk picks on it.
---
I've never heard of a player even using that perk endgame has anyone here?  
---
The one TSE Pipe Pistol user in the entire game?
---
Most meaningful part of patch, but the question is, will it improve anything at this point. They should give events/actions like these an unique reward that can't be obtained from anything else other than doing this event. Atleast then you feel like playing Hunter/hunted means something.
---
B-b-but.... no love for Energy Weapons? :(
---
When are you going to buff the durability/damage on Laser/Plasma weapons Bethesda...? Those weapons are useless at this point...
---
That is fair but for some people that are like level 40-50 it could be hard depending on their weapons.
---
Camden Parks vendor had the lever action for me.
---
awww, poor baby didn't get the changes he wanted...
---
I finally might be able to find the gamma gun plans. 
---
many people scrapped the frame with the ultracite armor without noticing. it's a way to give them back.
---
I was thinking that as well... But that would require the servers being able to handle it. I think they should lose an item from there weapons and armor tabs only at random.
---
&gt;You'll only get 50% of the damage that was reduced as bonus
---
Please extrapolate. It seems like you're saying there is an unintentional nerf here or something, that it gives 1/2 of what it should?
---
Queens are going to be scary without melee builds around. Anyone have tips for stacking armor penetration, what the maximum values would be, how they add together? What if you have 2X of 50% reductions?
---
as were expected
---
I haven‚Äôt either 
---
You guys just killed any thought of explosives getting any kind of love.  Severely disappointed.
---
&gt; **Learn Cooking Recipes:** This challenge will now recognize many additional cooking recipes when they are learned for the first time. Retroactive credit will not be awarded for recipes learned prior to today‚Äôs patch, but that is planned for a future update. 
---
So those of us who already learned more than required for the challenge are screwed.
---
So it's now 1.25 shot
---
Woo
---
^^/s
---
Well, that first part is a fallacy so that doesn't warrant a response from anyone, but on the second point, I've played all Fallout games. Tactics was a big change from 2, but still fun. 3 was a completely different game compared to the classics, but still fun. New Vegas was a buggy mess, but still fun. 4 introduced a lot of changes, but it was still fun. 
---
Fallout 76 is very different from the rest, but still fun. To say its difference is what makes it bad is ridiculous, in the case of a series that changes so often.
---
Even if the OP hasn't played the old ones, have you played them all? Can you give a verdict? 
---
After the nuclear fallout fades away, the area will still spawn bloated glowing ones for 15-30 minutes. Pretty sweet because then you can finally ditch the power armor lol
---
&gt;Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don‚Äôt fire bullets, so we‚Äôve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
lol, it doesn't make any more sense for a gun to magically turn 1 bullet into 2 bullets than it does for a flamer to have "explosive".
---
AWESOME JOB GUYS but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE work on weapon durability next! Many guns break way too often and it just becomes not fun. I appreciate all the hard work you guys do but please look into at least doubling the condition for guns across the board?
---
looks like no revisit from me. stash is full. nothing but junk. i'll come back when i can loot again.
---
way to kill off part of the economy that you said you were trying to fix bethesda
---
SO what. TSE  is a thing that needs the nerf and SBQ is a completely separate issue to be worked upon.
---
The whole encounter with the  SBQ needs to be adjusted or rewards improved upon. TSE isn't necessary to bring her down, I've been a part of fights with her that almost no people used TSE weaponry and we still did fine.
---
After this patch, hopefully they can start to adjust aspects of the fight to make it more reward for the amount of resources spent. Continuous farming of SBQ is just wasteful and farming nuked Whitesprings for legendaries/levels even after the XP nerf still seems to be the way to go.  
---
Exactly. 
---
&gt; things like White Knight that absolutely did not need to be nerfed
---
Not to mention they nerfed the wrong aspect of why it's 'mandatory.'  Everyone takes White Knight to reduce the material cost, the durability decay is just a bonus.
---
It'd take more time to craft the knives than to just kill the 6-7 enemies to get the xp. 
---
please keep requesting this. Im waiting for this since release now, but nope. Laser rifle is just a waste of materials, it breaks super quickly and the ammo usage is trash!
---
I was in a responder jumpsuit and it recognized me and gave me mission details for the event at the church where you clear molerats.
---
I have never seen more than 2 people on hunter/hunted at once, I don't think the message will appear that often. 
---
I want a trophy for reading all Camp plans a month before the patch! How about an in game trophy for my camp? You know we need more things to put on shelves Lulz  
---
Just think of all the time you'll spend not reloading...
---
I‚Äôd rather them make all the weapon damage card types 1 card to match the explosives card.
---
Pretty solid update for the most part. Couldn't agree more with carry weight changes. Hopefully the fix sticks longer than a day.
---
3 months later and still massive list of fixes, more nerfing and fuck all for even a tiny bit of new content. 
---
No thank you!
---
I work 3rd so literally all of their updates fucks my playing time.
---
Still nothing on Heavy/Energy weapons awful Damage and Condition loss?
---
If it was truly the same as the other weapon damage cards, it'd cost us 9 points to have +60% damage, I'm honestly okay with only needing 5. 
---
who wasted the most caps?
---
Is the "Select Structure" while making a blueprint fixed in this patch? It hasn't worked in quite a while now.
---
Nerf-ageddon!!!!!
---
&gt;If you want to complain, please quit and move on!
---
Critics should just shut up!
---
t. No one
---
have you fought the queen and what about grenade launchers fatmans and missles nope just a whiny baby who isnt thinking about the whole picture
---
No, the bobble head glitch is what needed to be fixed the most, you can nerf the TSE but if I can still stack 500 explosive bobble heads the damage is still gonna be ridiculous. 
---
Yeah now they cant just carry 10k pounds of all items. If there is still a way to dupe exponentially, they wont even be able to pick up the items. Thats good news.
---
What a fucking brown nose.
---
I tend to agree, especially as it seems that "two shot" now means "1.25 shot". (Please correct me if i misread that).
---
It will probably be rebalanced later.
---
I put the "/s" at the end to indicate it was sarcasm.
---
Get adrenal reaction, run all 3 rifle perks maxed along with covert operative you'll do like 3000 to 4000 dmg a shot easy
---
How long is it gonna be offline for?  Should I take a nap, or is it coming back soon enough I should do something instead?
---
I don't care what ya'll say, this patch has me excited. I have a TSE weapon, don't mind the nerf one bit, perfectly fine with. Max carry weight limit? Even better! And the fact that I can now go to Taggerdy's computer and learn the plans for ultracite power armor? I. Am. PUMPED. Bethesda is clearly trying, and I for one can't wait to hop on once maintenance is done.
---
Ty!
---
Ah sorry ! Fixed :)
---
The other day my wife randomly texted me "Damn you and DAMN WEST VIRGINIA"  because the song had gotten randomly stuck in her head at work, what with me singing it *all the time*.
---
Here's to the game getting better and better.
---
I'd actually like to see a lvl 50 "heavy excavator" maybe with extra armor bolted on
---
I love the Tesla Rifle. I just wish it didn't deal a fifth of the damage my Deathclaw Gauntlet did. 
---
One radX saturates your system. more doesn't do anything more.
---
In Missouri, everyone I know pronounces it apple-a-she-a
---
Yup I got one from a guy quitting the game lol this is now a ultra rare weapon lol
---
Glad about the two shot/explosive nerf. I know some people will be pissed off but it's good in my opinion. Such an unfair advantage for those lucky enough to get one ( or buy one off Ebay &gt;.&lt; ) and made me not enjoy the game. Now the pressure to get one of those weapons is reduced and I don't have to farm so much.  Still want one but less pressure to get a super weapon.
---
&gt; Scrapping: Loose weapon and armor mods are now protected from autoscrapping when crafting. However, they can still be scrapped manually if a player wants to break them down into scrap components.
---
I love everything about this patch.
---
Rip to getting some achievements fixed 
---
r/woosh
---
I'll ping the Dev's on this again then and have them take another look. Thanks for the heads up!
---
BAKE 'EM AWAY, TOYS!
---
Do you know if that is across characters or per character?
---
Welcome to nerf city. Fuck this shit
---
Been here, experienced this. I haven't logged in for 2 weeks.
---
I'm sure they'll get a handle on it eventually, but I can't sink precious time into a game that routinely makes it impossible to play/enjoy due to technical difficulties. I'm looking to return in March, and hopefully things will be better by then.
---
&gt;Rad-X: Consuming multiple Rad-X or Diluted Rad-X no longer causes their effects to stack.
---
Okay, I thought this was supposed to be the case. So either my Excavator's rad resists are messed up, or somethings not quite right, since it seems like I need 3 or 4 Rad-Xs before I enter a nuke zone else my Rads fills up in 60 seconds or so. 
---
Really happy about that! Legit.
---
Personally, I want a pair with glowing nuka-cola quantum piss stains.
---
Yeah, I have the same opinion on this.  I only have an Explosive lever action rifle, but it hardly seemed game-breaking at its original value.  75% less than that?  I'll be curious to see if it's still useful at all.
---
I would agree with the suggestion that some others have made that the best option would have been to elevate Explosive to a top-tier Legendary effect, so Two-Shot Explosive wasn't a potential combination in the first place.  At least moving forward.  Maybe for weapons that already have it, you apply these nerfs.
---
Since Two Shot legendary effect‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage, I think it should be renamed "Quarter More Shot", retaining the prefix "Two Shot" is misleading.
---
I'm confused about why they nerfed regular armor (both nerfing White Knight and removing the Rad-X + Diluted Rad-X stacking) when the game already forces you to completely ditch regular armor in favor of Power Armor for the end game
---
Regular armor needs to become a valid alternative to power armor, not be even more useless
---
Now this is a patch /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ ! 
---
Awesome work to the team and please keep it up! You have a great playerbase and fixes like this are a step in the right direction :)
---
Yeah but for those who like PVP this might make it way more popular.
---
And once again...Daily: Heart of the Enemy is still not fixed.
---
yes, that is exactly what it means...1.25 shot.  i seriously doubt they will change it back or increase it in the future.  this will seriously hurt anyone that was legit playing a build that used straight TS (no explosive).  Now i will have to go back to my instigating lever rifle for sniper shots. 
---
Ahhhh Cait! She loved me for how much I used chems ahaha
---
Oh they patched the Modus Vendor dupe exploit! Ive send a ticket to Bethesda after someone showed that exploit to me. Somehow feels good to see it fixed. :)
---
Its gunna be the same thing once they're nerfed. Ppl with explosive weapons will still have advantage as well they should. Yea damage will be down but chances are you'll still need a tse to take out a guy with a tse
---
I'd give it a try. I'm level 123, and I still find things to do! If you're on Xbox, I would love to help you out and give you a friend to play with
---
Changing the Demolitions Expert and White Knight mod seems obnoxious. White Knight was the only thing that made regular armor even remotely worth using, and many of the actual explosive weapons in the game like grenades, the M79, and the Missile Launcher weren't particularly strong weapons to begin with and just got a big damage nerf.
---
I know I will be the only person but is the nerf to pipe weapons really needed? Honestly who thought it was over powered? Who uses them besides me well into the 40's? Eventually they become nothing more then a emergency weapon that was pretty reliable on condition. It was also the only perk set that made weapon bashing any where near viable. ( Yet still a joke, lets be honest.)
---
if this was made at the time they were dupping it would have been more effective. 
---
Could not agree more
---
If the number of items in the game take a toll on their servers, like they mention, then I'm not sure why a limit like this wasn't set from the start. 
---
But I truly loved its reloading animation, bro. I could watch it forever
---
Dunno about the most but bought Radium rifle this morning...
---
God damn if I'd have waited a couple hours I'd be 500 caps better off 
---
As you have to already be in the game, (not at the start menu) before the challenges menu item shows up, I'm going to say per Character, but I'm not 100% on that as I only have 1.
---
Where would you ever get enough mininukes anyway?
---
Bethesda overdid it with this game. It is huge and complex with a billion stuff to do yet people complain about no end game. End game means playing the game after you finish thd story. Most games end game consists of grinding legendary loot, doing dungeons, raids and events. This game is no different i don't understand the no end game complaint. Maybe they want more bosses like the scorchqueen where the whole server has to join in like a raid. Other than that there is planty to do in the game.
---
It‚Äôs fun but every patch has indirectly nerfed it. It was powerful, but at this point it‚Äôs weapons and ammo are heavy, they deal much less damage now, and thus the costs per enemy killed are higher than ever. 
---
It‚Äôll take roughly two to three missiles to kill an enemy now. Those missiles aren‚Äôt cheap. Fat Man launchers are going to be pathetic. And grenades, which are kinda unreliable to place due to bounciness and cost the most materials per shot, are a terrible idea. I think the only good ones to use now will be **Pre-edit**: NOPE forget it I don‚Äôt want Bethesda learning about it so they can nerf it more.
---
The garbage cans in Whitesprings are going to be packed with goodies tonight.
---
Anything that doubles your damage is not good. So I disagree, it needed to be balanced. 
---
Lol I use my weapon weight unyielding for looting and pve....sentinel assassin for PvP.....works fine for meü§∑üèª
---
Using it should pull you into a server with other people using it.
---
what the actual fuck!
---
white knight nerf???? i have to repair my fucking armor way more often than the PA and now i have to pay even more for that? jeez
---
Demolition expert nerf? "hell yeah lets remove explosives (all together) because of one singe legendary prefix!" maybe we should remove Guns as a whole? Melee only game..
---
nerfs where needed here and there (not like you have done) BUT 
---
where are the nerfs to melee?
---
where are the buffs to energy weapons?
---
where is my CAMP/STASH Budget increase?
---
where is Content?
---
im so fcking dissapointed with that drop....
---

https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab2z10/clap_clap_were_in_a_simulation/
---
looks like they have to rebuild the projectile type completely from the looks of how the explosive modifier had to be removed. I would assume that fix would also fix the durability and potentially the viability of energy weapons. I would love that, as a heavy weapons main. 
---
Never buff.  Only nerf.
---
Bethesda.
---
Great work. Upvoted for visibility. 
---
Thanks for all the hard work and fixing a ton. I am really happy to see the workshop preview fix for 21:9, but are there any plans on addressing the stretched text currently appearing on the HUD for that aspect ratio? I remember you guys said it was a fix in a previous patch but it obviously isn't quite the optimization many were hoping for.
---
= 75% reduction
---
I would **love** a modern fallout game playing as someone who was born in the wasteland. Start off from the bottom as a raider, the rest is up to you. Vault-tech would still exist but you have nothing to do with it other than a pip-boy you stole from a dweller corpse and dweller encounters. 
---
Might be a dumb question, but by why the hell is it still so high? Why should someone be allowed to carry 1,500 pounds over their limit?
---
Thanks! It's been annoying me and my friends for a while now, not being able to secure the siren at my base over at whitesprings, players keep turning it on lol. Also reading the new patch notes right now, I love it. Keep up the good work! 
---
Just you wait till the junk jet gets added in, I'll use nothing but teddy fears for ammo
---
That's an absurd amount of nerfing just to make the game increasingly more about inventory management than exploration. 
---
A very bitter and slightly sweet update. Not impressed.
---
Very possible that this patch just ended my time with fallout 76. Totally get what you're saying.
---
I would be willing to put money on it that they visited your house, got attacked by baddies, and their explosive bullets messed up your crops in the fight accidentally.
---
This game is seriously changing my thoughts on saying this was bad. When it was first announced at E3 2018, I was pretty hyped and then the hype gone down as release day approached. Now seeing how Bethesda is trying their best to fix up the game, I‚Äôm impressed. In fact I kind of want to play it. The only downsides I still have is that it‚Äôs only on Bethesda‚Äôs own launcher, endgame maybe boring, worried this servers will shutdown and be left with nothing since there are no single player/offline mode.
---
Really displeased with the surprise max carry weight hardcap. I do a lot of trading and my mule has quite a bit of stuff. 
---
I actually disagree. What is the point of *any other* affixes if they reach increased damage by 100%? At least now we've got options: 50% damage increase for low resistances, 50% increase at low health, 50% increase after a few shots, 100% increase first shot only, 25% increase 100% of the time. Also, they screwed up by not making explosive another primary affix since that one is still the best secondary affix.
---
As it stands currently, everyone had or would eventually have had to get TSE weapons, especially for PvP. Period. If that's the case, resetting their damage output to spread out the options is best in my opinion.
---
My guess? They only fixed explosive bobbleheads stacking (as their notes say) and not ALL bobbleheads stacking. There is a the leader bobblehead which buffs xp received, my guess is people stacked crazy amounts of those and got way too many levels. This is fixing the symptom not the cause of the problem
---
Nice changes, I would almost start playing F76 again if there wasn't this damn AutoChess game to be played.
---
Is the "Select Structure" while making a CAMP blueprint fixed in this patch? It hasn't worked in quite a while now.
---
Lmao
---
Go look at the 3 rank cards again and think to yourself why they didn't do what you suggest.
---
Use a little bit of brain power here.
---
Can I get a respec option? 
---
The game is amazing but soooooooooo buggy but ther getting there
---
At this rate I‚Äôm pretty sure they want us to be farming materials 24/7. Every chance has been about increasing junk costs for simply using weapons and armor.
---
I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôll be a big no. Sorry I‚Äôm just not positive about bethesda‚Äôs intentions right now.
---
Check the game file directory where they are stored hopefully you can recover them
---
As a french player thank god for azerty support 
---
I'm saying any amount not taken as caps would be like credit at this proposed vendor. Not that credit would be equal to the caps taken
---
balancing an MMO for PvP has never once worked out well in the history of MMOs....and I have been playing them for over 20 years.  
---
I feel it is to be consistent with enclave and excavator power armors, since you do get the BP for yourself, while in this case you only got the frame without any mention of it even being ultracite.
---
NEVER!!! THESE ARE MY BABIES!!!!
---
Why change demolition perk? The cost of explosive ammo and their respective guns weight makes this feel like explosive weapons are worthless now. What's the point of a missle launcher that use to do 300 damage takes for ever to travel hard to find ammo and expnsove to make when I could get a rifle to do it better now? Is this just to fix the TSE bullshit? 
---
All mobs can still see you when your invisible. It's only good in PvP as they can't target you in vats, and you can attack while blending in to the environment. With melee you can use vats to teleport to a player, attack and remain see through.
---
Of course I get a explosive shotgun the day it gets nerfed... oh well at least I won‚Äôt have people chase me around the map calling me a duper 
---
I built a strip club.
---
The clientele that destroy BnBs are right at home 
---
&gt;Traveling Pharmacy: Now correctly applies its weight reduction effect to Radaway, Diluted Radaway, Stimpacks, Diluted Stimpacks, Bloodpacks, Glowing Bloodpacks, Disease Cures, and Antibiotics.
---
I feel a 100 pounds lighter now
---
yall make it seem like big changes have actually happened. have you read the patch notes for the patch about to be deployed? not exactly what i would call ‚Äúfixes to community issues‚Äù
---
50 caps aint shit, so shove that right up your ass, or bethesdas when youre done kissing it.
---
youre out of your mind if you think a company of this size needs a pat on the back for trying, get real.
---
Holy shit you are a whiny bitch.
---
Actually, it's mostly a thoughtless, horrible update that keeps leeching even more fun out of this game. Horrible patch, horrible priorities, absolutely dreadful "solutions" to problems. Sounds like another great job.
---
&gt; * Power Armor Station: Players can no longer view power armor they do not own when attempting to access a power armor station that‚Äôs occupied by another player.
---
This is great. No more locking my doors to work on my armour. Nice fix.
---
They forgot to lower all weapons to one damage. And increase the cost to 50 ballistic fiber to repair lvl 10 armor
---
Isn't super duper only for quest items? 
---
Example:       
---
Enemy has 1000 HP &amp; 20% resilence, your weapon has 100 damage. So it deals 80 damage right? 20 damage (20%) were reduced. Half of that reduction (50%) you'll get as extra damage. That means you deal 90 damage. Only 10% were reduced.      
---
      
---
I have an Anti-Armor Rifle and the Tank Killer Perk (??? the one with 36% Rifle Armor Penetration). It more felt like it doesn't stack to 86% but multiplies to 68%. Not easy to test tho. I would guess that 2x 50% are 75% penetration.
---
Well, i will check regularly
---
I seem to recall reading in one of the launch notes that if a wanted person does not have enough caps to cover their bounty the get a proportional debuff. This was one of the anti-griefing features put in to stop players from using a mule to avoid consequences.  
---
I used to have four turrets, one on each corner of my roof, and had pretty much the same problem. Scrapped those and replaced them with two missile turrets instead. More often than not, the missiles chew up the ghouls, wolves, and super mutants who randomly wander into my camp. The have a problem with mole rats, sometimes. I don't know if it's because those annoying bastards are so small or if they burrow before the rockets can hit them.
---
Has the upper level cap been removed? I've been looking for the Hand Made Rifle plan and have seen it said that it is no longer available after level 44. I understand the lower entry level but why put an expiration on it?
---
This is everything. Say it is so.
---
Interesting, thx for telling me, never tried to confirm it.
---
Deleted my original comment.
---
&gt; Hunter/hunted announcement
---
Excited about this one. I've yet to actually do this because it doesn't seem like people know about it. I've mentioned to random people I find and they're like "Oh I just leave it on the usual radio station"
---
I was a little disappointed when I realized that I couldn't pair the cowboy boots from the snipers outfit with the underwear as well.
---
sounds really interesting - I have not tested nocturnal yet but have my upvote ! Will definetly do soon ;)
---
Cute. That's it. Use personal attacks to further legitimse your point. Let me know how that goes, sweet cheeks &lt;3
---
&gt; No fix for M79 and auto grenade launchers not benefitting from Bear Arms
---
As far as i remember the patch notes it was changed intentionally.
---
The White Knight and Licensed Plumber nerf seem completely unnecessary, and definitely not wanted.  
---
Dark souls boss
---
I‚Äôm PS4, 
---
Thanks for the tips. 
---
Also another player made one for me, thank you for the offer though. I love this community. Everyone seems super helpful. 
---
WHEN YOU TYPE IN ALL CAPS YOUR POINT BE COMES MOOT AND YOU LOOK LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT.
---
I was heartbroken when, after a long and tedious process, I finally got my low-level character to purchase the handmade gun plans, then gave them to my brother's character, then logged in with my main character and had my brother drop the plans for me with the intention of having me pick them up... only to have them vanish. I eventually got the plans again anyway, and it seems like this patch makes doing this unnecessary, but at the time, I was terribly vexed. 
---
everyone hates niiggers and u know it. u hate niiggers too. u just dont want to admit it. niiggers are inferior stinky vile dirty beastlike slave creatures. dunno why they were freed
---
Supposedly she can also drop ultracite gatling laser plans, but I've never gotten them yet. Also a guaranteed *** legendary enemy, a bit of stabilized flux for finishing the event, and ultracite mods. I would like to know though if she will still drop UPA pieces despite it being obsolete
---
If you‚Äôre going to nerf TSE into the ground where it‚Äôs not viable anymore, what about the armour that can absorb like 20 shots from a TSE Handmade? Surely that‚Äôs going to be nerfed too?
---
Oh ok. That one gives you 3 places out of a pool of places with the data recorders. It's a bit of a waste of caps but since it's daily, your progress is reset after you switch servers or log out anyways. 
---
Because even now, YouTube is gonna be full of "BETHESDA UNFAIRLY STOPS PEOPLE FROM CARRYING EQUIPMENT! GAME GOING F2P? LOOTBOXES ADDED!?"
---
I don't understand the nerf to white knight, no one asked for this and it made keeping armor repaired actually doable given ballistic fiber requirement. 
---
WAIT, WHY ARE WE SHOUTING?
---
&gt;for the end game
---
You know if you walk in and out of the nuke zone a few times you stop taking any radiation damage at all and can wear your armor instead of PA
---
lol if only we had the proper means of storing all the junk we find, that would not be a prob.
---
The game is based around combat.  It's not like there are aggro tables or healing loadouts in fallout.  If you min/max for anything other than damage you aren't likely to be killing many enemies.  
---
I wish there were actual role mechanics more inline with mmo's, but at this point min/maxing is pretty much only *effectively* damage based.  No use having min/maxed damage mitigation if you can't kill anything without wasting a ton of resources to do it.
---
Unless I am wrong, which is possible, I believe all this nerf did was move TSE from the preferred legendary to the practically required.  
---
Outside of things like stealth snipers who love instigating, there is very little that does major damage now without everyone being even more cookie cutter build wise.  This means that instead of few people having TSE for a SBQ fight, pretty much everyone will need it.  
---
I guess we'll find out in an hour or two, but it certainly seem that way! 
---
We are aware of the energy weapons issue and working to address that in a future patch. As for the gunsmith perk I'll have to check with the Dev's on that.
---
Let the game out of easy access before clamouring for new content
---
Actually I have crashed *every* *single* *time* I fought the SBQ. This is a welcome change if we can get mods from the terminal instead of me blowing 3K 50 cal ammo only to be disconnected from server.
---
Thats what they all say
---
I understand two shot and explosive getting nerfed, not demo expert also. Now grenades are not worth the weight.
---
Yeah, almost everything they have done seems to be done with the intention of making it grindier and less enjoyable. Speaks to their priorities that this is how they approach things. "Oh no, you pick 3 of a stat and spend those 3 stat points it to provide yourself quality of life when it comes to repairs? Haha, no."
---
Awww, I think somebody got banned.
---
personal attacks? like your own hand, shoving your own caps, up your own ass. 
---
**AAAAAAAAAAH**
---
It's bethesda's first multiplayer game, how could a publisher with such a history of highly successful games have ever possibly known that their players wouldn't enjoy receiving complete and utter garbage legendary items?
---
It must have totally blindsided them, I mean who could have guessed right? No other publisher, nor any other looter game like Diablo 3, or The Division, has figured it out yet.
---
/yawn. \*white noise\*.... \*more white noise\*
---
I'll check back in another six months. If this game manages to survive as Fallout: Fortnite Edition.
---
But why the radx nerf? I mean seriously? Who in the actual FUCK wanted that? They already barely help, so you HAVE to stack them to be effective. Now they are useless because you gave them such piss poor resistance increases. For fucks sake bethesda STOP NERFING UNNECESSARY SHIT. And of course white knight is mandatory, you made it so damn expensive to repair shit and EVERYTHING needs ballistic fibre to repair, even a fucking sock would need it according to you. Stop messing up good things because you "think" it needs balancing, you're obviously not very good at it so just stop making your own decisions
---
Still playing?
---
Why don‚Äôt you just go back to playing Fortnite if you‚Äôre that grumpy about it, champ. 
---
I hope so!
---
It's done the opposite. Two shot is now on par with zealot, furious, anti armor in dps increase, situationally each is going to be better in some way. Explosive is now on par with rate of fire increase. Now TSE isn't so much better that anything else is useless in comparison. 
---
Hopefully the queen gets adjusted though, huge nerf like this will make her impossible as she was. That's the problem with this patch, TSE was overkill in the world but needed on Queen. Now it'll still clear the world spawns rapidly but will the sbq be killable with a crowd boosting her health?
---
The demo nerf is unwelcome though, and is pointlessly punishing after the nerf to explosive weapon. 
---
^^nothing at all!
---
Lol. So true.
---
you can buy them from traders it was a part of the economy
---
Some of it yes, but hey, all they're doing is answering cry baby's prays mostly (especially about TSE). Something is saying to that my pump action explosive boomstick is now became a little bit useless, we'll see tho. Whatsoever maybe it isn't the end of TSE story. I can understand their solutions, they're not so experienced in MMO.
---
&gt; Anti-Armor
---
Pretty far down right? And there's a reason for. Most people mix up 50% armor penetration with 50% damage increase. Most enemies and players don't have high damage resilence stats (think of 10-40% resilence). You'll only get 50% of the damage that was reduced as bonus (= 5-20% extra damage). Still Anti-Armor is viable for Scorchbeast Queens, Mirelurk Queens and in PvP vs Power Armor or Vanguard, Bolstering, Cavalier, Sentinel &amp; Assassin Armor sets. However, in my opinion Two Shot, Furious or Bloodied have a much higher allround usage. 
---
Armor penetrating affects are multiplicative, because of how the damage formula works this means the Anti-Armor prefix adds 28.9% damage.
---
The Auto Grenade Launcher still doesn't benefit from Bear Arms /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ /u/Ladydevann. I was hoping that'd be in today's patch, but hopefully it can be in the next one. It's pretty crippling for this weapon!
---
Good patch but all I need now is stash limit increased to 750 or 700, and energy weapons doing more damage.
---
 **Weapons:** Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod. 
---
What happens to the already existing exploding energy weapons?
---
Does this inclue the Tesla Weapons?, and on this note, how about increase the damage of the weapon, its such a cool weapon just to perfom poorly over any weapon, maybe add a perk on inteligence for buffing energy weapons?
---
\----------------------------
---
Its the durability of the energy weapons fixed on this patch?
---
\-----------------------------
---
LOUD NOISES!
---
Uninstalled.   
---
Seriously, another patch that any modder with access to the creation kit could knock out? Proves Bethesda isn't taking this seriously and already has a very limited skeleton crew working on the title. 
---
I would go for the 2 star Anti-Armor Handmade with 25% fire rate since it's overall dps output will be higher than of an 1 star Two Shot Handmade. Or is it TSE ?
---
totally agree. For me it does not feel like the Team really adds anything to this Sub. There is a lot of  chatting like "nice Picture", "i will pass it on" or "we will look into it". But there is not substance.
---
Head over to the Anthem Sub. While you can say anything you want About that game, but the devs really are active. They talk About the game, future plans, Change stuff, are honest and hell, they even already changed stuff in the game for the community before the game is even released.
---
I get their theory behind nerfing White Knight, but it just seems to me that if the fear is that players will consider them "mandatory perks," then that's an indictment of their whole armor decay system, isn't it?  Either players don't like how quickly it decays without White Knight, or they find it too expensive as it is.  A decision that forces players into a system they already don't like seems very counter-intuitive.
---
Previous we had some players accidentally scrap the Ultracite armor. The only way to obtain it if you scrapped it was to fight to Queen, so placing it in the terminals helps that. As for her loot drops the Dev's are investigating her.
---
Yep.  
---
I DON'T KNOW ASK OP HE STARTED IT!
---
I'm glad two-shot explosive (TSE) got nerfed, but I don't think two-shot was out of control on its own. I could have seen going from +100% to something like +75-80%, since a second shot would logically be less effective than the first, but going to +20% strikes me as an overreaction. I'd preferred to see two-shot and explosive as mutually exclusive but individually impactful, but I guess we'll see how the new meta shakes out. 
---
My new graphics card gets in tomorrow. I cant wait to play again :D 
---
Ehh.  Some important changes...but not much that will positively affect my game.
---
Just hoping for more stability at this point.
---
&gt;Vendors: Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.
---
And so server hoping was no more
---
Time to stop using guns entirely and switch to melee
---
If so does that mean it works like miner miracles?
---
On the whole a really nice update. I do wish the balancing was a bit more fleshed out - I understand the nerf to TSE/fixes with explosive bobbleheads and have no issue with it, but taking demolition expert down to 60% without doing anything to the already underpowered explosive launchers is kind of a shame. Now on top of breaking far too quickly, they don't even pack that much of a one-hit punch anymore. Same thing with energy weapons, the laser rifle and gatling plasma are pretty much unusable in their current state because of how quickly they break. 
---
The rest is great though, known tag on vendors and getting rid of the randomized recipes is a welcome change. Glad to see the MODUS dupe got fixed too, it wasn't very effective due to the cap limit but it seemed to fly under the radar. Hope you guys catch the other main one in the next update, too!
---
Two shot was three times as good as any other damage increase but instigating and needed to be brought in line with other legendary prefixes to give them some value. 
---
Already did what?  Stop applying Demolition Perk to Ballistic Weapons?
---
No fix for [Martial Arts?](https://youtu.be/UFEK53Fnzhk)
---
Its supposed to be a challenge not a pushover that's handles by 3 people while the other 10 fight scorched and normal scorch beast.
---
So nothing specific about the game Freezes many experience in certain areas... sigh
---
Well...what about the camden cats then?
---
 GENERAL
---
* Performance: Several additional improvements have been made to in-game performance.
---
* Stability: The Fallout 76 game client and servers have received additional stability improvements.
---
### BALANCE CHANGES
---
* **Perks:** The damage bonuses provided by each rank of the Demolition Expert perk have been reduced from +20%/40%/60%/80%/100% to +20%/30%/40%/50%/60% to match other weapon perk damage bonuses.
---
* **Perks:** The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced, to match the Power Patcher perk.
---
   * **Dev Note:** In looking at the Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.
---
* **Weapons:** The Explosive legendary mod‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage.
---
* **Weapons:** The Two Shot legendary effect‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage.
---
   * **Dev Note:** As mentioned in a previous Inside the Vault article, both the explosive mod and two shot weapons could result in dealing very high amounts of damage, and this was compounded if two shot and explosive were combined. We‚Äôve decided to tone both of these damage bonuses back.
---
* **Weapons:** Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
   * **Dev Note:** The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don‚Äôt fire bullets, so we‚Äôve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
### C.A.M.P., CRAFTING, AND WORKSHOPS
---
* **Scrapping:** Loose weapon and armor mods are now protected from autoscrapping when crafting. However, they can still be scrapped manually if a player wants to break them down into scrap components.
---
* **Turrets:** An ‚Äú(Owned)‚Äù tag will now appear next to the names of Turrets a player has built in their C.A.M.P. or a workshop.
---
### DESIGN AND GAMEPLAY
---
* **Carry Weight:** Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character‚Äôs current maximum carry weight.
---
   * For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
---
   * Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
---
   * Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
---
   * **Dev Note:** These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy. We do recognize the desire to be able to own more of the cool items that we have in the game, and we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size. We will be sure to talk more about this when they are ready.
---
* **Cap Stashes:** To help address cap exploits, caps stashes have been turned into containers, which allows them to properly reset and provide players with instanced loot.
---
* **Plans and Recipes:** When viewing a plan or recipe in a menu, a ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù tag will now appear next to the names of recipes and plans the player has already learned.
---
* **Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.
---
   * The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is based on player level and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
---
   * Additional structural Plans for wall sets, power connectors, doors, generators, and water purifiers have also been added to some Vendors.
---
### PVP
---
* **Hunter/Hunted:** A server-wide message will now appear when a player joins the Hunter/Hunted queue.
---
   * This message will only be displayed once per player to avoid spam.
---
   * An additional server-wide message will be displayed when Hunter/Hunted is ready to begin in order to give other players a final chance to join.
---
### QUESTS AND EVENTS
---
* **Belly of the Beast:** A new ‚ÄúUltracite Power Armor‚Äù entry has been added to Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance, offering Ultracite Power Armor plans to those who read it.
---
* **First Contact:** A new miscellaneous objective will now appear upon reaching the Overseer's C.A.M.P. for the first time, prompting the player to place a C.A.M.P. of their own.
---
* **Gauley Mine:** A new miscellaneous objective will now appear at Gauley Mine to introduce players to Ore Deposits.
---
* **Monster Mash:** The amount of XP awarded per round during this event has been reduced from 350 to 100.
---
### BUG FIXES
---
##### ART AND GRAPHICS
---
* **Lighting:** Lighting no longer flickers throughout Arktos Pharma.
---
* **Apparel:** Fixed an issue that could cause a character‚Äôs legs to show through the Rose Dress while it is equipped.
---
That's the point.
---
Thanks for this! I'll share this list with the dev team so they can investigate any bugs they aren't already looking into, and so they can take a look at your feedback/wishlists.
---
Why is it Beth is putting patch notes here first rather than their own forums?
---
The quest even tells you this!
---
Queen Loot drops should scale in quality based on damage done by the Player.
---
It isn't fair that a level 40 player hiding in the fortifications and getting an occasional useless hit on the SBQ gets some Epic drop, while the Level 100+ players that are in her face with High damage weapons, pumping stimpaks just get their 23rd Useless Ultracite Explosive Vents Plan or Mod.
---
Yeah, I could kill a super mutant warlord in 3 or 4 shots before this patch and now I'm wondering how many more bullets will be needed to kill the thing. Looking forward to hit the West Tek Research Center and test it.
---
NOOOO MY OTHER BABIES!!!!
---
Shoot them with giddyups instead.
---
 C.A.M.P., CRAFTING, AND WORKSHOPS
---
* **Artillery:** Fixed an issue that could prevent Artillery from being placed in valid locations.
---
* **Blueprints:** Addressed an issue preventing players from placing a stored blueprint containing posts that were placed partially underground when the blueprint was originally saved.
---
* **Budget:** Scrapping a stored blueprint that contained wires will now correctly remove those wires from the C.A.M.P. budget.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit that could allow players to duplicate their stored blueprints.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit that could allow players to reduce their carry weight to a negative value.
---
* **Foundations:** Fixed an issue that could cause a ‚ÄúCannot place item: Needs support‚Äù message to display when editing a partially floating foundation.
---
* **Power Armor Station:** Players can no longer view power armor they do not own when attempting to access a power armor station that‚Äôs occupied by another player.
---
* **Scrapping:** Ignition Cores crafted for the Earth Mover event are no longer automatically scrapped when using the Scrap All Junk option at a Workbench.
---
* **Scrapping:** Junk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft.
---
* **Stored Objects:** Repeatedly attempting to place an Atomic Shop variant of an object the player had stored but does not own no longer prevents them from placing other variants.
---
* **Structures:** Fixed an issue that could prevent a C.A.M.P. or workshop structure from being edited when building levels had been merged or split several times. This fix is not retroactive and will not apply to structures built prior to today‚Äôs patch.
---
* **Terminals:** Powered terminals contained within a stored blueprint now work correctly when the blueprint is placed in a new location
---
##### CHALLENGES
---
* **Collect Holotape Games:** Nuka Tapper sub-challenge can now be completed by playing the Nuka-Tapper holotape game.
---
* **Formal Wear Challenges:** Pantsuits and Shortsuits now correctly count as formal wear when completing challenges.
---
* **Gather Building Supplies:** The ‚ÄúScrap items to produce fertilizer‚Äù condition has been updated to "Collect Fertilizer" and can be completed by salvaging or crafting it using spoiled fruits, vegetables, and meat.
---
* **Learn Cooking Recipes:** This challenge will now recognize many additional cooking recipes when they are learned for the first time. Retroactive credit will not be awarded for recipes learned prior to today‚Äôs patch, but that is planned for a future update.
---
##### ENEMIES
---
* **A.I.:** Fixed an issue in which some enemies could chase the player farther than intended and become frozen in place.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed several XP exploits by adding a limit to the maximum amount of XP granted by a single kill.
---
* **Looting:** Fixed an issue that could prevent players from looting goo and ash piles after killing an enemy with a laser or plasma weapon.
---
##### GENERAL
---
* **Loading:** Fixed several issues that could cause characters‚Äô body parts, equipped apparel, or armor to become temporarily invisible to other nearby players or teammates after loading into a world.
---
* **Monorail Elevator:** Fixed an issue that prevented the Monorail Elevator near the edge of Cranberry Bog from taking players to the top floor.
---
* **Performance:** The Scorched Earth event has received optimization improvements.
---
* **Performance:** On laptops with more than one graphics card, Fallout 76 will now default to using the dedicated graphics card rather than an integrated card.
---
* **Performance:** Launching the Traditional or Simplified Chinese game clients on Xbox One no longer causes a 6 second hitch when the launch video begins to play.
---
##### ITEMS
---
* **Bobbleheads:** Using multiple Explosive Bobbleheads no longer causes their effects to stack.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit that could allow players to duplicate items using MODUS Vendors.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit in which the Vampire legendary effect could restore health through unintended means.

---
* **Health Bonuses:** A player with very low health who unequips an item that provides bonus health will no longer be instantly killed if removing that item that would cause their health to drop to or below 0.
---
* **Paper Bags:** Fixed multiple issues in which transferring items into an empty paper bag as the bag was despawning caused those items to become lost.
---
* **Pip-Boy:** Fixed a rare issue that could cause a character‚Äôs Pip-Boy to go missing.
---
* **Power Armor:** Entering a suit of power armor no longer occasionally causes it to become invisible to nearby players.
---
##### PERKS
---
* **Butcher‚Äôs Bounty:** Searching a dead Tick with the Butcher‚Äôs Bounty perk equipped can now correctly produce additional Tick Blood.
---
* **Cap Collector:** Now requires players to search caps stashes, much like other perks that grant a search option for containers.
---
* **Exploit:** Addressed an exploit affecting the Curator perk.
---
* **Fireproof:** Flame attack damage reduction provided by the Fireproof perk now correctly applies to Molotov fire damage.
---
* **Serendipity:** A notification will now appear on-screen and sound effects will play whenever the Serendipity perk‚Äôs effects are triggered.
---
* **Super Duper:** Can no longer trigger when crafting quest items.
---
* **Traveling Pharmacy:** Now correctly applies its weight reduction effect to Radaway, Diluted Radaway, Stimpacks, Diluted Stimpacks, Bloodpacks, Glowing Bloodpacks, Disease Cures, and Antibiotics.
---
I hope so. Let us defy physics again like in FO4!
---
bobblehead stacking was officially nerfed just hours after u posted this.  which is kinda cool
---
The will just create multiple mules.  Yes it will be more tedious but it will still go on.
---
I need a picture of this lol üòÇ 
---
It's a fun event though. You could just fast travel out.
---
Do you think the majority of these "fixes" should have been done before release?
---
I got up to 3/4 once, then it went back down to just me.. Hopefully now it'll be possible without prearranged groups. 
---
Totally agree. Having to swap weapons or grab a buff without being able to pause sucks. Having a second screen to handle it would be awesome.
---
Yeah, they're going to have to dump all 74,000 guns they're carrying if they want to do anything, that should really help out the server stability and the trade economy as well
---
But isn‚Äôt shielded the best one?   Would not learning protective first effect the abilities of shielded?
---
I'm hoping it means I can finally find the elusive t-51b calibrated shock plans! lol
---
Ones mans trash is another mans treasure
---
Bobbleheads: Can no longer stack Explosive Bobbleheads.  What about Melee?  These were stackable as well.  
---
Rad-X:  Can no longer stack Diluted Rad-X...what the hell did this do to grief the crybabies, other than to give non-PA users a FAIR advantage rather than having to glass-cannon around nuke zones in a Hazmat Suit.
---
White knight was nerfed to be equal to Power Patcher??? Power Patcher lvl3 has always been stronger than White Knight lvl3.  White Knight needed a buff or Power Patcher a nerf not the other way around.  I haven't repaired my PA in weeks but repair my regular armor every other day, and I have and utilize both perks.
---
Much of the "fixes" seem geared to the benefit of Beth's obvious primary endgame set-up:  OP Melee.  Explosive was broken on Shotguns and Flechette Harpoons.  Instead of addressing THAT screw-up, they unfairly nerfed it across the board. 
---
TSE fairly griefed PA users because there is no dense PA mod, and leveled the playing field in PVP.  With the fireproof perk and a dense piece, non-PA users stood a fair chance against lumbering OP melee builds that abused the current PVP setup.  Only needed to nerf the bobbleheads and leave the rest well enough alone.  With only 3  individual(+30% DMG Total)Slugger/Gladiator perks, a Bloodied Supersledge/Deathclaw Gauntlet etc and a steak I am way more OP than with my TSE Handmade with all 9 rifleman and 5 Demo Expert equipped.
---
Dick is in the name kid, mind your own beeswax. im entitiled to my own opinion, and homeboy didnt seem to wanna appreciate that. 
---
Then you've got them placed poorly. My turrets do a fine job. Before the spotlights they were garbage though.
---
Thank god they are needing the TSE weapons. I have a TSE shotgun and they are so broken I hardly ever use it.
---
I think the they said they were aware of it, but that was while discussing this patch, so my money is on the next release. 
---
I never said bring the damage up. I said make other legendary perks viable. Give us a reason to use them over TSE or Bloodied
---
Some good stuff here. One question though about the perk Travelling Pharmacy, does Rad-x count although it doesn‚Äôt say?
---
&gt;Perks: The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced
---
Ok, who are the Fucking idiots who went on their way to complain about this? This change makes me **extremely unhappy**.
---
I think you mean junk instead of treasure lol

---
Why not remove all of the ultracite plans from her loot pool at the same time then? If her loot is already diluted and we now get this for free, simply removing them as a drop would automatically make her drop list better. It's like one hand doesnt know what the other is doing.
---
I have a Furious Tesla Rifle and it's one of my new favorite things as well.  Sure, you're not going to be taking down a high-level Super Mutant with it, but against random mobs in any location other than the Mire or Cranberry Bog, it's devastating.  And don't underestimate it in tight spaces.  I was clearing West-Tek the other day and the Tesla Rifle's ability to bounce off door frames essentially lets you fire 90 degrees around a corner.  It's awesome.
---
Plus, I felt super clever sneaking through the Harper's Ferry Armory and using it to destroy those turrets.
---
I once had a bug where I could jump like 5 meters high, that was super fun. I used that to jump onto roofs of houses and other things 
---
They‚Äôre craftable. But it isn‚Äôt worth it anymore.
---
No one looked at this all ready?
---
3 months now people have stacks and stacks of explosive vent's and Ultracite right arm plans and only now its being looked at?
---
I see.   I had like 5 on me last night and couldn‚Äôt drop them individually.   It seems like they were all lumped together as 1 tech data quest item.  
---
More like 5000 caps or higher.  At 500, three fast travels between vendors gets you ~550ish caps after paying for travel and you're respec-ing any time you want at will.
---
we expected the massive nerfs to TS and explosive. there were a ton of other nerfs that nobody expected.
---
Lol playing assassins creed in fallout lol 
---
Do You hear the voices even when your not playing video games? 
---
Yeah and it is a bad fix. They should have just renoved the explosive effect on explosive legendaries from being affected by the perk cards.
---
Why does explosive on weapons even add 25% damage? The explosive radius is bonus enough. Just remove the damage bonus.
---
I would like to see them change it so each projectile deals around 80% damage, for a total of 160% dealt. This is better than 125% damage, but worse than 200%, and you have to make sure that your aim is good, or half your damage is lost. 
---
Also, it would make sense to me that a gun modified to fire more than one projectile probably isn't going to be firing them very powerfully. 
---
MY PARAKET RIPPED OFF MY CAPS KEY
---
Don't underestimate Bloodied + Adrenal Reaction. Even before the nerf Bloodied Explosive was better than TSE at 40% health or lower. Post Patch it will be similar to TSE at 80% HP I guess and most likely better at 60% HP.
---
This also kills all legitimate player run shops like Lucky Lou‚Äôs
---
I just spoke to bethesda too, they said trying to be funny and royally failing is their thing. Also, they asked you for a job interview.
---
&gt; Martial Artist 3
---
I wonder if that's a bug, and it should only affect melee as the name implies.
---
Or if it's working as intended, and the description is just bugged.
---
Time for a sale.
---
&gt; Weapons: The Explosive legendary mod‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage.
---
&gt; Weapons: The Two Shot legendary effect‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage.
---
Pour one out boys.  It is a sad day.
---
I like the game too from the start and lived with all the bugs, in that region I am pretty hardened as a Linux user. But now I am bored too. I am close to lvl 40 now, never played with other people cause I cant use a mic when the kids are sleeping. And yea well, it gets boring after a while. I am planning to go till level 50, not really intrested in the endgame, as in nuking something and then farming mutated mobs and I will hope for new content and then return.
---
If this is them overdoing it then its fucking embarrassing. 
---
The demo expert perk nerf is absolute bullshit. If they nerf the weapons let us fucking invest 5 points to make the weapon better. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a one point fucking card.  
---
Oh and another XP nerf, why? 
---
Most of us survived fine without TSE for a long time before the nerf.  I don't know how SBQ fights will go, but everything else has always been cake for me.  
---
Best bet is harpers ferry, I see them a lot
---
bye Felecia
---
I‚Äôm selling my fat man launcher and auto grenade launcher after the servers come back up. 40mm nades, missiles, almost all throwable nades and mini nukes are now not worth their crafting costs.
---
A ton of awesome changes we‚Äôve all asked for. Really gives me hope. 
---
Did they ever address being able to constantly spawn on someone to revenge them and if not, have they stated that it‚Äôs an intended feature? 
---
Having someone revenge you 4 times in a row really sours the fun when they clearly pick a fight with you and decide to troll you if they lose. 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a bit so I‚Äôm not sure if they adjusted this at all 
---
Lol don't need...once you go heavy, you'll never go back. 
---
The rough rocking of your body. 
---
Thrusting your hips into the shot. 
---
That scream of ecstasy coming from the gun, "dooga-dooga-dooga-dooga" just begging you to keep fingering that trigger. 
---
The sweat on your face, and the grimace that comes across it as you unload right onto your enemy...
---
then, when it's all over, the silence that wraps around you, as you look around...
---
half naked and confused...
---
what happened? 
---
Why is there blood?...
---
and feeling deep down inside, the satisfaction of riding the big gun. 
---
Need it? No, no one needs it...until they try it, and realize, there's no going back.
---
It's easy to get 10 caps
---
CORRECT IT WITH FIRE, CITIZEN
---
Those people also "accidentally found 10k steel in a bag someone dropped and picked it up. I didn't know it was duped!" so they're basically full of shit.
---
Vertical movement should consume less AP, but going forward should be increased. Also, the tap boost covers too much ground with Marsupial and Bird Bones.
---
Yeah but junk can have a different meaning. Miss me with that gay shit lol
---
/u/ladydevann, /u/valseek any idea on whether Early Warnings will work properly now for those of us already impacted? Will I be able to go get the items needed to craft the upgraded motors? I've had a ticket open for 19 days now, with no real response. 
---
So, you felt like demolition expert and white knight were so good that they felt like "must haves" so you decide to make them shitty... Rather than making other cards better? 
---
This is the logic roundly applied to this game.  Never make weak things better, continue to make good things weaker to match the shittiness of other things.
---
This doesn't attract players or inspire people to keep playing.
---
Honestly I don't see any incentive to do the SQB anymore 
---
Turn back all ye who enter here. 
---
If you have subtitles on I believe it gives the translation.
---
100%. Take those.
---
Same. Server still down right?
---
How have you gotten to level 150 without doing quests? That seems like it would just be grinding to me. What does an average play session look like for you if you're avoiding the quests but have leveled so much?
---
Yea that's the point I started offloading things on a Mule too, just go wild and offload as much weight as you can
---
They nerfed explosive weapons...lol.  the perk.
---
The hardwood floor one they have is pretty nice too, hell of a lot better than the stock busted ass plywood floors. 
---
this happens to me playing on pc no power armor
---
So another man‚Äôs junk is another man‚Äôs junk 
---
Yes. I play like this, and I hear people talking through my TV.
---
Removed? Did they actually removed your post? Why?
---
Your point about ammo is a good one. Prime weapons have a specialised ammo, why couldn't we have more specialost ammo types?
---
of couse, I just put it simple so others can understand what I mean with 'half of the reduction'.
---
Nah, just means we switch to our melee builds and butt tuck you &lt;3
---
Exactly this.  
---
Said as much pre-release, and sad to be proven right
---
. :(
---
New Mule Characters will be pouring out of the Vault tonight like ghouls from the White Springs Golf Club.
---
Do the others stack as well?
---
They have a list of priorities. Not having this feature doesn't break the game. They've been killing bugs my guy, you sound like a spoiled brat
---
Yeah 500 caps seem's light. It should defo be something that has to be worked towards.
---
Maybe 5k / 10k caps and 3 items from the SQB or something similar.
---
I disagree.  Zealot is for scorched only.  I have a furious ski sword and my instigating ski sword is better than it.  Anti Armor is not +50% damage, it just bypasses 50% of the enemes DR which means that the lower the DR an enemy has the less bonus you get from AA.
---
This nerf severely hinders people like me who only had TS or E but not TSE and as you stated, SBQ is another issue.  Unless they nerf her, everyone in the fight will almost be required to have TSE. 
---
Are you melee?
---
This. I really want to make a heavy weapons character who alternates between ballistic and explosives weapons but between the nerfs in this patch and the amount of fucking screws required to build a supply of missiles.
---
Bethesda should just make the explosive perks not affect the explosive legendary weapons. Or better yet, just remove explosive legendary weapons entirely. It makes no sense to eliminate a build/playstyle in order to balance a legendary effect.
---
It was an exaggeration to drive home my point.
---
I also never said I would quit, just that a lot of players would. I have heard a lot of people's opinions on this issue, and a lot of them said they would quit.
---
And why do you hope I quit playing a game, I obviously enjoy enough to have played 600 hours already? I never said anything negative to you, about you, or anyone for that matter. 
---
Making it personal, doesn't improve your argument.  
---
Hand mades are still good against flesh enemies but we will now need to rely on specific modifiers to deal more damage against a specific type of enemy instead of having one weapon for all. 
---
Good idea but it'd be nice to get some new guns first, 76 had a whole trove of new melee weapons whilst the majority of guns were carried over from 4.
---
temporarily.
---
Maybe if we write an essay, they allow us have SOME fun in the future.
---
Which is retarded.
---
The demo expert nerf is bullshit, and not surprising they didn‚Äôt even mention it until today. Doesn‚Äôt make one bit of sense. 
---
Except this isn't a TSE nerf. This is a TS nerf and an E nerf.
---
Why would it get rebalance later? It went from being the clearly best dmg legendary mod to being on-par with the others. Now is balanced, it is still better than most legendary mods, not just waaaay superior.
---
That means leaving 95% of the loot where it is, or throwing it away at a later point.
---
Either the vendor caps maximum + the player character caps maximum need to disappear, or the weight limit.
---
Otherwise i dont think this game will work for me. Ever. And that would make me just so disappointed and sad.
---
Read this as Visible Legendaries instead of Viable. 
---
Bloodied and explosive. Bloodied was always top tier along with 2 shot but it had a draw back, now that 2 shot got nerfed hard bloodied is the best. If furious didnt have such a stupid damage cap then it would be best on heavy guns or guns with large mags
---
They need to prioritize this.  It's sad that we cant use the most iconic fallout weapons because they are broken.
---
I'd need to sell about 7k pounds of stuff lol
---
Its back to farming ammo 1h , kill 1 ghoul , farm ammo 1h...well u get the point
---
Thank god for the TSE nerf now I can actually pvp without fear of god guns 
---
Yep
---
&gt; **Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans. 
---
Holy shit.
---
Not even sure what you mean but if you're saying I'm crying to Mom good job being a loser lol
---
great update
---
This is why I am giving them a chance and letting them work on it. They know they fucked up and realize it and now are fixing things 
---
If you guys are still struggling with this, I may have the solution. I had the walls-facing-inward problem and saw it was only on the front face of my house. Where I had flooring outside for my porch.  
---
The wall snaps-to the edges of your flooring, but snaps-to-side according to what it thinks is the outside of your house. It's unfortunately not a bug, but an unintended side-effect (pun intended) of the snap tool.  
---
What might help us all, is if the rotate object button flipped the asset when it is snapped to something else.
---
Looks like the Super Duper change only affects quests items.  Only place I see that being a bummer is the Mount Blair power core.
---
Have you tried heavy guns or melee? would be easy for you to switch over to either since there in strength like shotgun perks are.
---
Melee will still be very strong, and heavy guns like the 50 cal and gatling gun are very decent with there damage output.
---
Really? That was its name? Haven't heard of it yet... Are you sure it wasn't a scorched one?
---
melee/shotgun, but with a focus on crits and a decent stockpile of shells I now am 90% shotgun.
---
Its not on every server.  It exists as its own in a separate cell which is why you need a dev command to teleport there.  Why else did people need 3rd party software to hack their way in there?
---
she drops serum recipes
---
I feel like this would make some great DLC - Just like what they did with Elder Scrolls Online, create an entire new story mode with the elements of 76 in it. I know I would buy it.
---
Plus an extra baby called literally every single **non-legendary** explosive weapon, including thrown nades. And no, ‚Äúlul nobody uses them‚Äù is not true and not a valid argument anyway.
---
works like a charm every time for me, at least :) if by "completely broken" you mean when you have to enter building-mode to see a yellow outline of where the broken things should be (Y)
---
The two shot effect will still be pretty good (if not one of the best) when compared to the other legendary mods, but for explosive, it went from +200% radius dmg (with the rank 5 demo expert) to +32% radius dmg (with the rank 5 demo expert) which is actually really bad. So the result in my eyes is that both are still pretty good but now people will have to git gud and aim to kill stuff instead of shooting the floor :)
---
The same player cannot trigger the message multiple times, so you won't see people spamming it.
---
Good question, I don't know! But would be awesome!
---
Okay gang, like most players I have my TSE guns. What do I use in their place? My melee can hold up somewhat against higher enemies but I would be hard pressed to think of a time in the last 20 levels that my TSE was the difference between life and death.
---
It's not currently a pushover, though. The regular SBs are pretty easy for my with TSE Gatling, but the SBQ is a whole 'nother story.
---
Maybe a reference to the extinction-level nerf? If not, I have no idea
---
Definitely some good changes in here. A few others that I'm suspicious of for now, but we'll see. As a TSE rifler, I'm already struggling with ammo management (yes, even with the perks to dup and make more), so now I suspect I'll be needing more. Maybe I'll kill fewer things? Who knows. Again, some great changes (KNOWN!) but also some TBD ones for me. They're definitely trying.
---
300+ hrs of play time and my best weapons to date are a 1 star 2 shot Lever Action/Combat/Handmade rifle. Guess I can 76 another shot when mod support fixes all of Bethesda's fuck ups come November.
---
/u/ladydevann Any word on addressing Perks that are incorrectly effected (or incorrectly displayed) by Class Freak (Empath and Herd Mentality)?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Meteoritic_sword
---
you don't need a "build" with a TSE shotty.
---
The raider lining plans are sold at Pleasent valley and Sutton Station all the time. 
---
Probably you will die from that double syringe  of morphine.
---
Maybe have 1 complimentary free and the rest cost 10k caps
---
It's honestly hit or miss.  I've seen the SBQ fall in less than 2 minutes, and I've seen her glitch out and not take ANY damage.  She'll still be killable....hopefully.
---
Haven't seen it, must be rare!
---
Craft them?
---
I mostly do use my All Rise for my main weapon, but I switch the the TSE Gatling for SBQ fights.
---
I got a explosive tesla, executioner (I think), moded it with shotgun.  It was, might still be nice after this update :P.
---
I think it falls under the category of not having bullets tho since it broke the animation.
---
It's weak development teams that are reactive instead of pro active.
---
Everything on the list of today's patch probably shouldn't have made it out of BETA, or should have been added in as fixes way before now (3 months some of those issues were on live). 
---
It embarrassing when patch's are made up of a few bug fixes. If this shit had been fixed before launch it might not have had to go half price 2 weeks later, it might not have had Bethesda exec's hiding from Twitter / Facebook etc. 
---
It's not on when companies release broken products because there financial year needs a boost etc. 
---
&gt; It makes no sense to eliminate a build/playstyle in order to balance a legendary effect.
---
Holy shit yes thank you. This perfectly summarized this. So well I‚Äôm gonna emphasize it:
---
**It makes no sense to eliminate a build/playstyle in order to balance a legendary effect!!!**
---
Low effort? He doesn't really explain anything, just rants in a single sentence. Where's the discussion?
---
Yeah, but that is the point - when you have a legendary affix that is 100% bonus damage 100% of the time, what is the point of any other affix in the game?  Now you want your instigating for an opener then switch to a 2-shot for the fray (or one of the 50% bonuses if your build supports the requirement).
---
We have a fix coming for that in a future patch.
---
I was thinking the same thing.  No reason to spawn it on her now
---
The explosive bobblehead was the only one that stacked previously.
---
Oh shit, that's not a bad combo. Definitely gonna be going that event more often. 
---
But since it‚Äôs a person that actually thinks, they‚Äôre getting this information still, who cares if boys could do their job, why do you have to be so negative?
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but that only applies to junk that required manual scrapping - like beer bottles, baseballs, etc.  Teddys don‚Äôt require manual scrapping üòß
---
The problem is this: they cited the reason they nerfed WK was to make it so people didn't feel it was mandatory to use. Well, by making it weaker over all so that you need 3 cards in it just to get the same effects as you could with 2, they have done the exact opposite of what they just said. In fact, I was using only 2 points in it before because 2 was more SPECIAL and perk efficient -- essentially what they already wanted -- but now that's been shot in the foot.
---
No, buffing zealots to be able to one shot scorched wouldn‚Äôt make it one shot a super mutant.  Do you realize several of the modifiers are underperforming?
---
Probably a bunch of events
---
I see your down voting my posts too sorry bro don't have time to return the favor I'm posting at the gym and just finished benching four hundred seventy five pounds so no time to obsessively read new posts and downvote people
---
Alright, it's like that. You have a good one, I hope you find happiness in trying to piss off random internet strangers :)

---
Description: Certain outfits and underarmor pieces (especially the modded types that add bonuses) will reduce the resistance stats of your power armor while worn.
---
This patch has been persistant since before the holiday break and really needs to get fixed.
---
Will see, but looks like explosive heavy weapons are now better compared to TSE than before.
---
Energy weapon condition loss buff and damage buff would be great.
---
Btw, it's better to suggest improvements via their Feedback Support Ticket or the official forums.
---
I should have bought the mosaic floor when it was available ;_;
---
Nah, there all in your mind!
---
Yeah, that was the one.  I actually turned this one off because I was tired of the pop up.  It seems almost every time that it would pop, it would give me this as the Air Purifier destination.  The first time, it was good to go as the air purifier was in the forest somewhere, but now, every time it pops, I see the roof of the dirt track.  I wonder if, I complete it, will it reset the locations.
---
Yeah, or at least let us sell them.
---
My only opinion is that i hope they reduced the demo perk from 5 to 3. So that we only need 3 to max it instead of 5
---
You coudn't stack non-damage bobbleheads AFAIK. I tried it with INT bobbleheads and was still dumb as a rock. It's more likely just making it so when you kill a whole mob with one shot from an explosive gun you hit a single instance XP cap
---
You haven't seen it?
---
I was doing SB queen once and killed myself with my 2se prime HM and had to respawn REALLY far away and a foot or something from another SB seemed to stretch forever as I just ran and ran to get back to the fight I'll see if I can find a pic or clip, I didn't even think to do it myself cuz I was just worried about getting back to the queen
---
Five? That's a lot! Maybe I'm  not hanging out in the right places! =\]\]\]\]
---
Good! üí™üèº
---
One of Rose's quests rewards a chassis with leveled raider power armor on it. Similar to how Belly of the Beast rewards the Ultracite power armor. 
---
Super Sledge's
---
It's on the server though?  
---
I know you can't get into the dev room without cheating, but it still exists on the server, no?
---
Either because it never occurred to QA that people would try to spawn in 17 trillion items. Because the non-duping effort required would be inhuman. 
---
Im also going to bet that the server has no trouble maintaining seven trillion items,  but speaking in seven trillion items is the real problem. 
---
The main issue here is that this stops the marauding bobblehead monsters,  but does nothing to the infinity mules that are the other major problem
---
And to head things off: I've worked in QA.  You have some crazy MFerz in QA ...but they can't think of everything.   And I'd the developers knew of these exploits they wouldn't need QA to find them.   Software is complex,  and it's easy too easy to say "hue hue did anyone QA this? "
---
And even if QA finds it,  that doesn't necessarily mean they figure out a reproducible way to trigger it.   Adams just because they can reproduce it doesn't mean development can fix it right away.   And just because development can fix it right away doesn't mean they're is chinese on the schedule.   Adams just because the is time on the schedule doesn't mean management will let you fix it in any given release... ...and even if they do,  there's no guarantee it'll make it into the patch. 
---
Because it would be spammed with images of every little thing 
---
I understand them nerfing TSE, but why do they feel like it was neccesary to nerf Demolition expert aswell? Overkill imo. The nerf for TSE weapons would be the perfect opportunity to adress and fix the low durability on laser weapons, etc
---
Pack it up boys, wars over!
---
Welcome to the *actual* entitled gamer culture (not the one where people cry entitled when players expect certain standards of service). The culture of 'Why should I have to think about my character or even potentially do some mathematics in order to be the best?'
---
Sorry, where do you see that?
---
Yeah, I have the Dark Hardwood. I want so much, but I'm not spending any money to get it, so it's taking forever. The true end game.
---
Now I've gotta go get my melee out of storage
---
They really should have prioritized that integrated to dedicated graphics card switch. Almost made me cancel my preorder and caused a friend not to buy it
---
I've help many players do anything from guarding them, or  crafting. I also do events. I don't count them as quests though. But a bunch of them give good xp and loot. But yes I do farm as well. I tend to go to Watoga and Fort defiance to collect chem's and food. Most of which I pass on to lower levels to help them out.
---
TSE was already required for PVP.  You couldn't survive a single hit in level 50 PA!
---
Mods dont allow images, you can upload to imgur and post the image link here
---
And the best of luck to you
---
I asked the Dev's if its still included in her loot pool, waiting on a answer for that now.
---
Tbh I can consume materials far faster than they can be found with a explosive build. I already have to have ‚Äúalternate‚Äù weapons like **non-legendary non-explosive** shotguns as a backup and to kill less threatening enemies. Which means most of the time I‚Äôm a gimped shotgun build because you can blow three days worth of farming mats on a single fight with explosives.
---
I mean, lets be honest though.  This was needed.  Why would you even use an instigating prefix when you could get two shot.  This brings it inline as appropriate for something you can spam with consistently larger damage bonus.
---
Cryolator ammo is 4 resource mining thick. Gotta get acid too. Perhaps increase amount per craft? Or up its damage to bring it in line with horrible cost of firing it.
---
Some guy I was playing with last night escorted me to a suit located in the locked room on New River Gorge Bridge. I believe the key was located on the rollercoaster in a rucksack at Camden Park. I am pretty sure there are YouTube videos for this too!
---
What about Laser and Plasma Rifles low damage output?
---
Alternatively add a safe we can store caps in
---
Overall great set of patch notes imo. Where is the best place to report bug though? I have looked on the official support site and there is no option to submit a bug report that I can see-I have several related to the BoS to give.
---
And the likelihood of killing the SBQ is now almost non existant
---
stop nerfing and start buffing, you're just making the game a bigger grind fest. Merge Weight reduction talents into weapon talents. Buff underrated perks and allow for more build variety.
---
Two Shot was not overpowered. The other effects, barring Explosive, are absolute garbage and needed to be brought up to Two Shot's level rather than nerfing one of the only good perks.
---
PREACH! I have sympathy for those who mobbed around with HEAVY weapons and blew stuff up. I run SBQ's constantly daily. I love when I see people who mob with fatmans and missile launchers. It makes the experience feel more action movie-ish. Meta is TSE and I feel that doesn't really set the mood properly when fighting the solo antagonist to the Appalachian survivors lol. 
---
I got the barn plans at level 6 when I scrounged 25 caps together to take the Poseidon workshop. 
---
Hopefully this means that I'll finally get the handmade plans though. I was resorting to buying them at this point.
---
Was this update supposed to include the new Vaults content? For some reason I thought it was supposed to.
---
If you read my other reply SPECIAL bobbles never stacked, but the % increase of anything DID stack
---
uk, I think it might be the reason why they put the ultracite armor available on the terminal. They may have predicted the nerfs would decrease the chances of successful kill on the SBQ.
---
Totally agree, i only have a L40 pipe-action explosive which more or less will be meh now. Might as well switch to melee.
---
They are more interested in making good things not good than they are in making not good things good.
---
&gt; **Butcher‚Äôs Bounty:** Searching a dead Tick with the Butcher‚Äôs Bounty perk equipped can now correctly produce additional Tick Blood. 
---
Game changer. We all were waiting for that. Thanks!
---
I would love this game if I could consistently play it, crashes on loading on to the world half the time. I legitimately only get off when it crashes, because it crashes often enough for that to work.
---
I would say it's best paired with other effects that way the magnitude of it's benefit is increased of course then it means you can't use it as much during the day.  Still, I'd say it can be worth it on a good weapon if it won't take up too much space lugging it around vs how much you're using it.
---
The trick is realizing what it is that's causing the burden. Earlier on I was also annoyed with the weight limit and then realized I was holding onto 60 pounds of gunpowder...
---
Ammo I never used was also a large burden. Keep what you *actually* need and use, and bulk/sell the rest. If you find you're out of something, there's this fun part of the game where you can go out into the world and scavenge for it. And when you do, all sorts of adventure happens!
---
some call it balanceville.
---
Well,  I did have an explosive gatling laser that was pretty useful. That's been destroyed 
---
In that case, I agree. A lot of the legendary effects feel underwhelming.
---
would that cause people to have to do more looting to stay at top tier? I know i have read lots of threads about people saying they spend too much time grinding already. would it punish players who don't want to spend that extra time and just want to kill monsters.
---
I think it would be a good idea overall but there are concerns. Also it would be good to give people more things to craft so that stash weights go down as resources get used up.
---
\&gt;  The focus that online games seem to have of weakening ~~strong~~gamebreaking builds is disheartening
---
FTFY
---
Since getting White Knight at level 50, I am now level 110, and I haven't repaired my armor since.
---
Ive never woken up in the middle of the night and had soup but it sounds like something I should try.
---
That's not new. They've been doing that for a while....
---
That was very specific haha. Thank you? Thank you. Soup is wonderful. Especially cheddar broccoli.
---
only treated and resistant as far as I know. not protective and shielded.
---
I check patch notes to see if they've buffed damage of non-legendaries, instead they're ignored. It's a joke.
---
I don't want to farm the same spot as thousands of other players to gear up as if I'm Rifting for legs in Diablo 3. I may want to RP, which could be something as simple as only just energy weapons, but it's counter-intuitive.
---
I get that bullet sponges is a part of non-modded Bethesda game experience but it's a bit monotonous when it's in a survival game where the player and enemies are all bullet sponges.
---
Hopefully these issues will be fixed in 3 months when I get burnt out with Anthem.
---
Thats fine.  I guess we can just a start a "meta build" page.  I mean if we all have to roll the same 3 or 4 builds to be effective, so be it.
---
Yeah I felt a little bit of my FO76 addiction die this morning lol.
---
Eh, I'm using an EVGA 1070 FTW with an i5-4690k @ 3.9 Ghz. I wouldn't say "really high end" but it's up there
---
That‚Äôs just 2 and a half vendors to visit with bulk steel or some other junk. 500 caps is seriously nothing.
---
Then you clearly take instigating almost 100% of the time due to potential one shots using them still.TS is pretty much the worst option listed at this point.
---
Good that TSE is nerfed, but a real downer for people only using the TS or E weapons (and E getting a double nerf)
---
Ah, they need to be manually scrapped?
---
I'm thinking the same thing, might move on myself. 
---
That's not how Pacifist works
---
Instead of looking for another way around TSE weapons they decided to nerf the legendaries (I personally think was enough) and then the perk which will have consequences for explosive builds but I doubt they even thought about.
---
Have all caps shared across accounts....   
---
It reads like it means things that need to be broken down in to components. 
---
Everyone taking it is the problem. It limits build diversity. Should lessen armor degradation overall imo
---
That's being looked at with the durability as well.
---
Weapon types that need buffs: pistols/energy weapons/ normal explosive weapons
---
Weapon nerfs: melee but not too much there has to be a reward for people getting right in the face monsters of the wasteland
---
As far as armor nerfs I here unyielding can be op
---
Ohhhhh my bad.  Your right it was treated now that you mentioned it. 
---
No, but that's just because I don't want to buy it XD
---
In reality though, I don't care what they add, it's there choice and stuff I might have no interest in and entirely dislike might be the perfect addition to someone else's camp or character.
---
Very Good
---
Vendors: Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.
---
The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is based on player level and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
---
So we can finally find Handmade plans (?)
---
I see people saying this is good and all but I am kinda out of the loop and don't understand what it is saying the change is and why people are happy. Can you explain this to me?
---
Again I'm not against nerfing at all but they destroyed some builds. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
---
I havent seen anyone post this yet in reference and a little sad about it. Old but gold, the bagger 288
---
https://youtu.be/azEvfD4C6ow
---
We really need a close, and *careful* look at all the **non-legendary** explosive weapons. Btw I‚Äôm sorry to emphasize that so much but apparently people hear ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù and think of two shot explosive guns. I‚Äôm not talking about those at all right now.
---
Also I really need to stress that today‚Äôs Demo Expert nerf has hit all **non-legendary** explosive weapons hard. They‚Äôre very costly to use as their ammo is expensive, and that perk‚Äôs adjustment will require even more of that expensive ammo to do the job.
---
Auto-grenade launchers, M79, missile launchers and fat man launchers are not in a good place. Their durability is too low and they break very fast. Their ammo is expensive, far too much for their results, especially after today‚Äôs patch. Plus Grenadier only works for throwable nades.
---
I am literally only level 17 and already reached the 600 weight in the stash.  Keeping only 300 rounds of ammunition for nonexplosive and a 200 limit on scrap.  I only have 1 power armor frame and a set of t-45 for when I reach high enough level to use it.  While I am storing outfits- I am storing no other armor.  I don't feel like I am super out of line for wanting to store more items.  If the issue is an item limit then switch the stash to a max item limit rather than weight.  I won't be playing until I can at least store more stuff as I literally have no room for anything I find and I haven't even gotten to a point where I am storing gear.  I realize it's mentioned that they are seeking a solution but I haven't even reached level 20 yet and I am running into this issue before I even have that much stuff worth saving.  
---
I enjoy this game but when anyone can throw some mines on my C.A.M.P. and break everything in seconds, I need to have the ability to stockpile junk in addition to at least some gear. At this point even a seperate stash that held the possibility of being stolen from, I'd be fine with.
---
Dear Mothman i want this
---
Is that not what that means? Thats what I'm getting from it.
---
God I hope so.
---
I also was curious at first why we couldn't store caps like in other fallout games. But just imagine what would happen if people were able to use the duplication exploit on caps.... Especially if there wasn't a capacity on the amount we could have... people think the in game economy is bad now... That is one thing Bethesda did do right. 
---
I've seen a lot of feedback on this and have mentioned it to the Dev's. I'll be sure to include it in my report again.
---
Nice patch notes. Sorry to everyone who feels nerfed, but I'm okay being a War Machine. What is strong in context? Making the game harder is fun. Unless you like to power level and complain there is no content.  
---
TSE nerf. 
---
Check back in a month or two, they'll be useable, the repair cost will skyrocket, the durability usage will be slightly less and damage will be cut in half to compensate. Finally, beam splitter will work for one patch, then next patch it will consume 8x durability- this will be a rotating bug.
---
Now that we can reliably get those handmade rifle plans, can we please get a perk to reduce the weight of rifles?  Or have their damage scale with perception or something?
---
It‚Äôs not about it just being there. It‚Äôs when these items are moved such as when a player logs in and a ton of information needs to be called all at once while the servers continue to do everything else
---
wtf there is nothing to do after the story. sure you can kill the queen x-times or farm whitesprings/legendaries. thats basically it.
---
Wow.. this person is successful in life. GTFO
---
It's going to be sad walking around Appalachia seeing the abandoned remains of missile launchers and fat mans
---
To be clear, you never saw the increase in your STAT tab. If you were to stack 2 or 200 explosive bobbleheads it would still read "+30% explosive damage" under effects, however your damage still was buffed. 
---
You were tracking the amount of xp each kill gave you with 0, 1, 2 and 3? And killed multiple enemies to get consistent numbers? If not then you didnt really test anything 
---
Demo perk is worthless for pvp since anyone in even a beginner pvp build will be immune to explosive damage. The melee damage should be massively reduced as well via blocker+dodgy minimum let alone assassin+sent/cava/ls, and drugs. Yes pvp requires builds and buffs. I am not saying its perfect but really not countering something there is a counter for isn't bad design, its bad play.
---
I'ts been 3 months with nothing but "We are aware of this and are looking into it". I'm not holding my breath.
---
Or at least give you the option to turn those cards in for new cards. a full respec seems a bit much.
---
Now from my understanding Cap Stashes will be instanced instead of reset upon server join. Thus limited Cap Stashes.
---
My friend and I didn‚Äôt even get the Ultracite PA from the quest. It just gave us both and empty frame that had no icon and weighed 0 pounds. 
---
Many of the requests on this sub get repetitive. And so get the answers. There are just so many ways someone can say "I pass this on to the devs".
---
So I should be able to use multiple diluted radX?  I prefer not to lose my mutations!
---
Well they are absolute trash now. I‚Äôd rather try to kill things with a combat knife on a Commando build. At least then I won‚Äôt pay out the ass for materials for my meager performance.
---
Not much more than that to using melee. Only downside is getting close. Don't worry tho, next up on the chopping board.
---
Oh I agree for sure, just letting him know since I was in his boat until someone else showed me.
---
I'll look into this for you. In the meantime can you submit a ticket for me? [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
This is painful.
---
Ok, down voted because I went cheap with 500. It was just a thought. A starting point. How about having the cost scale to your level? The higher your level, the more points you have to respec, so it costs more caps. 
---
I had the opposite last night , but who ever dropped the nuke was brilliant in pushing the zone to the Northeast a nudge to include the power station and train station.   That allowed for a crap ton of raw cobalt flux to appear at the northern end.   For me cobalt is the rarerest to collect and I managed 40 (with green thumb) in a run. 
---
Wellll they nerfed watoga high school with today‚Äôs update so , that‚Äôs not even worth wasting the time doing anymore. Idk what kind of people they have on their development and QA team but I feel like it‚Äôs a bunch of 18yr old millennials that are inherently bad at videogames so they make everything worse to match their shitty standards.
---
I'm literally unable to decipher this lol
---
I don't think they are talking about mod plans. Just the armor , head , chest and limbs. 
---
Yeah, just server hop until you see it up there.  If you see another weapon plan (like crossbow or revolver), don't loot it or you will lock yourself out of that spawn point for 24 hours.
---
I use Tesla rifle a lot but it will always be trash until it benefits from anti armor perks. Honestly can't believe they still have not addressed energy weapons durability and lack of armor penetration perks. 
---
I had an explosive bolt-action pipe pistol, it was crazy good. Stick on licensed plumber and I had to fix it probably once a week. Level 100. 
---
Or, they may actually be the group event they were intended to be?
---
damn I wish Slugger did 20 / 40 / 60 lmao
---
Your crying about TSE? Haha git gud
---
Cus no1 will ever find out. It‚Äôs the perfect indulgence.
---
Why the fuck would you need to carry roughly 1800lbs of items on your mule, with an additional 600lbs in the stash on top of your 600lbs and roughly 300lbs on your main?
---
"Two Shot" needs to be renamed to "Hot Loaded" since it no longer does double damage (two projectiles).  The term "hot loaded" refers to firearm ammo that has been overcharged beyond its intended specification, resulting in higher, often unsafe pressure and projectile velocity.  I think it's a better descriptor than the now-inaccurate term "Two Shot."
---
Oh, so it's not like a secret room with no doors that you could only /noclip\* or something into, it's a separate virtual space entirely - gotcha
---
\*I know it's not /noclip, that was just the best analogy I could come up with
---
lol whaaaat?  trying this tonight... 
---
Hmmm.... I think that's kinda oversimplified to say. There are a lot of other crafting and camp building and vendor bulk selling reasons to go out and find things.
---
But you can't blow yourself up with a combat knife.
---
Git gud? Have you played this game lol
---
I sexually identify as an attack helicopter.
---
When I wanted to dedicate the time to doing cap stash runs, I made between 5-8k a day. Mind you I didn't do this every day. But without it I had a hard time coming close to making this kind of money killing mobs or selling to vendors.
---
Disappointing.
---
Yes please.
---
Name checks out
---
Oh, i thought it meant that they will be like containers where the loot inside is exclusive to one player. So if someone loots it before you, you will still be able to go up and get loot yourself. 
---
Will have a look later on, think im near to a caps stash where I logged off earlier 
---
I *am* talking about SBQ fights in a group. Christ, this shouldn't be so hard to understand.
---
I think he is implying the long tedious process of completely respecing your build
---
Okay so plans ‚Äúshow up‚Äù starting at a certain level,  does this mean they‚Äôll be visible to characters BEYOND that level?
---
Ex: Can a level 108 see the handmade plans at vendors now or do They still need a level 15 plan hunter?
---
Two Shot is actually just the Violent effect from FO4. it gave you 25% increased damage, but reduced accuracy and increased recoil. Now we also have the added benefit of increasing the rate at which the weapon breaks. 
---
I claim them frequently when: 
---
1. I'm playing for awhile, so I'll get to collect the resources, and benefit from another free fast-travel option. 
---
2. I'm playing with a group, so if I leave or disconnect, ownership might flow to someone else on my team. Having a group also confers some PVP defense. 
---
3. I need the specific resources the workshop provides. I don't need more general bulk. My stash is already full. 
---
4. I'm not bored of defending workshops. Defending workshops can be fun, but it can also be a chore if you own too many too often. 
---
Public workshops are a great part of the game, but they're a sometimes activity for me. 
---
This is what happens when a game is rushed. They have spent months fixing shit rather than spending their time actually adding content. This game is basically early access in its current state. 
---
You're right, with a shitty RNG, a player with less time to grind is likely to have gear to trade with other players - or the time to track down a third-party source to coordinate a trade?  Are you intentionally being dumb?
---
Shops
---
I have a TSE gatling, I'll see what it does tonight but with my buildout I'm still gonna be doing some serious damage even with the nerfs.
---
Since the explosive damage is cut by 75% then it should really cut down on the number of times you blow yourself up in close quarters, assuming you're weaing sufficient armor. I assume that's the negative you're referring to.
---
I suggest the Lucky Break perk (if you have the luck points.  I'm not happy about the white knight changes either, but I can tell you that Lucky Break has changed my life in the game (even before this patch...)
---
I haven't ever seen that happen. I am sorry for the loss of valuable plans. FWIW, I always trade the vital stuff and only put expendable things into the bags (like ammo and spare plans and the like).
---
Yeah I accidentally bought one of the TERRIBLE forehead tattoos
---
I had a scenario a few days ago where a player picked the lock to get in the back door of my Blacksmith Shop, he acquired a 10 cap bounty, and started running away, but I used the range on my New Explosive Hunting rifle to remove his bounty, (got 4 caps). his friend got angry and started attacking my CAMP, (Because I killed his friend for no reason according to his message), he quickly racked up a 40 cap bounty chunking grenades at my CAMP, so I killed him too, (got 12 caps).
---
When the angry player died, another player picked up his Bag, so upon returning he was even angrier and began throwing everything he had at my base, but the other player repeatedly killed him everytime he got a bounty, he messaged me that he just wanted his junk back, so I messaged him back that I didn't take his junk, and that if he didn't lay off my CAMP, I would find and level his, he finally left, but the encounter cost me more than 20 times the caps I got in repairs. 
---
Not sure why Rad-X stacking is being taken away :/. It's how I survive in nuke zones.
---
I would genuinely love to see how that is the case and the rationale that caused it to be so.
---
Very cool. Good advice. 
---
Does that apply to power armor as well, or just "basic" armor?
---
I would totally be down for this! Great idea!
---
I have yet to play FO76, I just lurk on the sub so far, but I'd like to give a shoutout to Bethesda and the community managers for putting together thorough and detailed patch notes! I'm a routine player of another game that has had its own struggles, and although it has made a lot of improvements in its lifetime, the patch notes are rarely this thorough and almost never include actual percentages despite the community's desire to see them. Keep up the good work!
---
omg  
---
I never knew they give you a set of ultracite PA =/   
---
I also just recently finished collecting PA armor parts plans, lucky me
---
Poor sbq, now she won't have anyone to play with
---
I believe you left out Nerd Rage in your Bloodied build.
---
Same boat guys, seems if you don‚Äôt want power armour ya fucked
---
Does explosive legendary still get damage increase from demolition expert?  If so, how does it work?
---
Totally reasonable, I pretty much agree
---
I am not working today, soon as the server is up, I'll test it and let you know.
---
Damn. Thank you for that. Been playing, but that one escaped me..... 
---
So many nerfs.  I was already losing interest in playing due to crashing at inopportune times and not being able to retrieve my dropped junk, but now I don't even feel like bothering to log in since my goal was to get a TSE legitimately... which doesn't even look worth the trouble now.
---
Might be more than a bit. Only thing we can do now is farm for items and sell them on reddit. Not sure this is going to be fun enough to keep our interest :P hope you manage, tho.
---
you need to learn some inventory management skill.  i am level 148 with 450 in storage.  there is no need to keep hundreds of anything except bullets.  stop hoarding 50+ stim packs, radaway, etc...those drop like rain throughout the game.  don't store heavy ammo for weapons you do not use - gamma, grenades, EC, etc.  
---
Thank you, I appreciate it.
---
[Recent studies](http://amp.timeinc.net/time/5288704/can-you-catch-up-on-sleep) have proved this to be true.  That said, still wouldn't recommend relying on weekends to make up for a week's worth of debt.  But it is possible.
---
Lol
---
It depends on the database implementation, not much else. 
---
99% of my stash is just mats. i hate calculating what i may need in a few hours etc etc.
---
its just not fun for me if 90% of my game experience is spent on getting rid of stuff.
---
And if its not fun then why play.
---
That's a bug?! I figured it was just a sticky key from dropping my controller all the time.
---
Spent over 8 k caps with this and another 5 with scrap mod one 
---
I'm crying from happiness, finally!
---
you have to pop like 3 rad-x, and if you are mutated, you need more like 10 rad x diluted instead, and even then you will take 5-10 times the radiation you will in power armor or a rad suit.
---
But yeah, it's always stacked.
---
   
---
I agree 100% I've played since the beta, I had to leave the game due to the boredom I received it was a cycle without end, gather materials, make bullets, throw a bomb, gather legendary, repeat there is nothing interesting in the daily missions the horrible and unbalanced pvp Fallout was always a story game, that focus on the pvp first is an insult 
---
I used it before switching to heavy weapons. Have a TSE bolt action pipe pistol that does 765 damage. Then again i got the 3 perks from perk packs.
---
I was talking with a friend and we were in basic agreement that BGS completely underestimates the drive of dedicated fallout players. There's no reason why the stereotypical fan wouldn't have finished the game after the first couple of months. Hell, I saw players nuking the first few days after the official release. Imagine how bored with content they must be.
---
I'm on XB1 and have yet to see the patch hit yet :\\ sorry dude.
---
That's actually normal. In FO4 that was the legendary enemy "mutating" and they would get a random buff and go to full health. I don't think the random buff applies to 76 but the SBQ shouldn't have the health regen anyways. 
---
Of course!  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/9lLKhEs](https://imgur.com/a/9lLKhEs)
---
Well, player vending machines will soon be added.
---
Will do.
---
It's a very powerful perk, but there is nothing good about regular armor otherwise, and ballistic fiber is a huge pain to source in large quantities if you aren't a duper.
---
Will this fix the issue where when I fast travel in my PA my chest piece unequips itself? 
---
Well, I keep every Bobblehead in the vain hope that I'll get to display them on a shelf someday...
---
so we need to memorize the story-line behind each mission before we are allowed to be bored with the actual task?  hahahahaha!!
---
Yeah i know, just a little pissed off that the limit is so low because the dupers probs have weight in hundreds of thousands.
---
It's easy to do nerfs... It's not easy find alternatives or implementing something new to make it inadequate. 
---
I agree! Nerfing basic armor when it doesn't even compare in defense to power armor is not logical. If we are willing to run around with lower defense we should be able to use perks that boost this play style. Do they want everyone in power armor all the time?
---
What happened that scrapped my teddy bears last time was I made some gunpowder, but only had teddy bears in my player inventory, not my personal stash. Just in case you need a sure way to get it to try to use the bears.
---
Alternatively, you could spend caps, thus freeing up room to earn more caps.  There is nothing in this game that requires anyone to have more than 25k caps.  
---
Or is this all "Player Economy" thinking?  
---
I have never understood this extra game players have where having the most money and stuff wins.
---
But guns were OP says the melee user with 2k damage.  Yea guns could shoot says the level 50 all-rise user doing 3.5k.  Yea we can't keep up says the level 100 using a vampiric sword and 1.8k damage.  
---
Nah, fuck them all. They keep fucking up the game and keep doing stupid mistakes left and right. And their greedyness is just said. I know these people here are probably just underpaid community guys but if they had anything to do with the game than fuck them. Sending some people here to answer a few times won't make all that shit disappear
---
Thanks for the baggies disappearing and for nerfing my lovely exposivenweaposn :(
---
I did end up keeping an ultracite explosive laser no double shot but hey it exploded , now it‚Äôs going to be even smaller :(
---
They are never going to be able to balance the legendary effects as they are. They made their own bed by including them in the game. It was a terrible decision and makes crafting entirely moot, killing one of the largest content drivers in the game.
---
Thank you so so so much for the detailed report here! This is the kind of detail that I can't stress enough is super helpful. I'm passing this along.
---
that's right
---
Had this game sitting in my library hoping it would get better over time. No new PVE content, nerf after nerfs and no buffs. It‚Äôs finally time to give this one up.
---
They likely don't, but it's easier to say that when limiting people. If it is taking a toll, it's because it's badly designed. 
---
This is pretty much the TL;DR of what i was saying, i agree 100%
---
In terms of perk point economy, it's a pretty solid choice. The gunfire spread is crap, but you don't get accuracy issues against a target like the SBQ
---
You feel like your doing no damage at all?
---
The servers aren't even up yet, how do you feel anything of the sort as the game isn't even playable at the moment?
---
You don't have them.
---
THIS. I'm going to fast travel to Charleston when the servers are back up to see if I freeze instantly. 
---
It is daft that they overnerfed each individual card, so the effect compounds itself
---
***Wake me up when fo4 settlement objects are put into C.A.M.P.s and NOT through the Atomic Shop.***
---
^Imnotbuyingrecycledassets.
---
Agreed. It indirectly ruined part of my SBQ support build (Medic's fat man). Smiting demo expert was an insane kneejerk reaction. I agree to some degree that 100% more explosive damage was a bit much, but they should have adjusted non-legendaries to keep them viable within the changes
---
Yo hold up...what dress is that???
---
Gotta admit I did chuckle upon seeing that one.
---
Same 
---
I don't know what to tell ya, man. Ya only need to figure out mat priority once. Then ya just kinda know. I'm sorry.
---
When playing Oblivion, you can use scrolls to duplicate items. Doing so creates a massive initial lag spike while it generates all the items. Picking up all the items, leaving, and reloading the game with the now thousands of whatever you made caused the game to run significantly slower. 
---
This was on PS3 at the time. This causes me to believe that the current hardware (PS4/Xbone) may actually be what is limiting how many of each item every player can have while inside the server. 
---
Does anybody know if you can separate cards you‚Äôve combined? There‚Äôs plenty of 3 star cards I don‚Äôt have room for....
---
Yeah, I know. Once I reached the end of the BoS story line, you realize what the story line could have been. I love fo76, I really do, but that, together with the lack of human characters, makes the game feel like you came too late. Everywhere I went from then on, I felt like I came too late to the party and missed all the action.
---
Let‚Äôs say your lvl 50 and have all the cards that were negatively impacted and no longer wanted those perks. 
---
White Knight you would need lvl 53 to replace an equal value leveled up card that‚Äôs if you want something in the agility tree.
---
If not a lvl to switch perk points and another lvl to pick your perk card. Just something as simple as white knight would cost you 6 lvls just to fix what was needed.
---
Imagine demolition expert or nerfs that cause a change in build gameplay. 
---
That sure is a lot of lvls to get back to a working deck and character. 
---
This is true. It will help those trying to build in existing structures to be able build without connected support to a foundation. 
---
Well it‚Äôs nerf and nerf and nerf. I am level 155 I love this game , had the LUCK to find an explosive shotgun and now it‚Äôs crap. I am fed up
---
Honestly, i dont have my hopes up for the player vendors. They talked a lot about limiting the economy in today's patch notes when nerfing stuff so i in no way believe they are ever going to allow us to set up a shop where we can sell anything at our own price. 
---
Probably the same 200 caps per day :D
---
I don't know if  a bethesda employee will see this, but a friend of mine and I have been having this problem. We saw it in beta and then he just got the game a week ago and it happened again yesterday (I was hoping it was gone already). I invite him to a team and he joins and it does nothing... and then says he refused the invite (when he kept trying to join). When it happened in beta we tried to have him invite me and I think it wouldn't even let him invite me (I forget though. I know we couldn't get around it that way I think). We're on PS4 and while his character has stayed the same for me I have two different characters (the one I started in beta and the one I redid to play with him now since my first one was way more levelled then his).
---
Fix the DEMO nerf... TSE nerf alright that is fine. However, you have made those who want to use heavy guns worthless when compared to others.
---
WHERE IS THE PVE CONTENT. BEEN RUNNING SBQ's for 6 WEEKS. STUFF IS GETTING OLD FAST. NO MORE NERFS PLEASE IMPLEMENT NEW CONTENT!
---
I don't think you understand how this is meant to work.
---
There are few items in this game that are truly sacred.  The rest, you sometimes need to make difficult decisions about whether or not they are worth keeping if you aren't going to use them.
---
Workshops can have crafting stations too.  
---
Regardless, it just means it's scrapping items in your stash.
---
An hour and a half longer I think
---
Overall a decent patch.  The only thing I don't see that I would have liked is a fix to the overseer's mission quest bug.  I've had all the holo tapes (including the not needed 17th tape) for a long time now, but the quest won't complete for me :(
---
That would be great, maybe have it use the same target we had last time as long as it's the same enemy type? Having to retarget each time in long fights sucks.
---
r/wooosh
---
And you.
---
The +1500lb over carry weight seems like a lot still.  Maybe hack that back a bit more to allow expanded stashes?
---
I think 75% reduction was a little ridiculous 
---
Too bad the Lumberjack is like the 4th or 5th coolest outfit to run around wearing with a flaming chainsaw
---
Oh my God. Gimme all the Unstoppables and mothman stuff! 
---
This is mine :)

---
They need to be repairing/improving and adding content not sat judging an amateur artist competition. Maybe a 6-12 months down the line it would be cool but there are much more important things they need to be doing with their time right now.
---
Well, I wanted to play a stealth/sniper build and primarily avoid Melee fighting, so I had not even considered Perks like Blocker + Dodgy - and, up until I reached over level 60, Explosive damage was never an issue for me - I don't even know how to reduce Explosive damage, I had two big concerns: 1) the power of my Sniper Rifle seemed to turn to shit as I started gaining levels over \~45 or so, by the time I reached level 60 I felt like I was using a kid's potato gun and it was \*\*\*infuriating\*\*\* that as I gained levels, maintained the max level Sniper Rifle I could build, and added the best modifications I could to it, my character continued to feel weaker and weaker, rather than growing \*stronger\* which is, to me, what \*\*\*the whole point of leveling up is\*\*\*!!!  
---
So, I understand that the enemies are "scaled" up as you level up - but, so many aspects of the game made it feel really broken from how I wanted to play.  Since the day I pre-ordered, I had been looking forward to eventually working my way up to having an awesomely powerful .50 BMG Sniper Rifle that would feel akin to wielding "the Hand of God" as I hid in the shadows and slowly, stealthily crept into position to take out powerful enemies with carefully placed headshots.  Learning that the .50 BMG Receiver made the \*\*\*weaker\*\*\* than the current .308 that I had was flabbergasting crushing blow to me, to say the least - I was aghast, shocked, \*offended\* even - it is a remarkably stupid situation.
---
Second big concern 2): managing my inventory and having to spend more effort worried about the carry weights of items than actually doing what I would think of as "playing" the game.
---
Since health is based on Endurance, it would make sense that if you want to better survive enemy attacks, the first place to focus would be putting S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points into Endurance - I learned the hard way that that was nearly a complete waste - that was quite frustrating.  The mechanic I prefer in a game which pits players vs. players is that your base "HP" is the \*primary factor\* in determining how well you can withstand attacks.  In this game, they've rendered HP almost insignificant.
---
When's it drop for console 
---
I'm assuming it'll not stutter all to shit as much. 
---
Did I read that wrong because it says it's a nerf of both, individually.
---
**Weapons:** The Explosive legendary mod‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage.
---
**Weapons:** The Two Shot legendary effect‚Äôs damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage.
---
Change it to hard shot or buff shot.  
---
Yeah it's doesn't look good at this point. Granted I get the TSE's were pretty strong but then that leads me to believe any build that does well will more than likely recieve a nerf. Which begs the question why bother investing the time into something if they will gut it later. I get 10-20% changes and that's fine but when you've effectively reduced it to the point is it even worth it anymore it's a bit disheartening. 
---
And before you say it no I'm not a primary TSE user, I am a melee build. I did use a TSE gun simply as a way of damaging the SB/SQB's whilst in the air.  I will more than likely just avoid these now instead of thinking that's some nice flying food right there.
---
servers are still down so...
---
Doesn't seem to be a problem for every character to be carrying around 1000s of caps and ammo at a time, so I'm genuinely curious how they're treated differently on the server from, say, steel or stimpacks
---
Standard Two Shot. Thanks for the input!
---
Cool.  I mean, really, it is a cool update.  Especially for people that already have 20-30 levels saved up to respec. 
---
However, *next time you nerf a bunch of perks* you should offer a character respec in the Atom Store.  Jesus fucking Christ, Bethesda, why is this still not a thing!?  Do you just not want to take our money or what?   
---
I'll check and report back once the servers are back up. You're probably right.
---
After reading my own comment...i think I am... at least heli-curious.
---
Omg, praise Mothman
---
Simple fix... Explosive modifier weapons do not benefit from the demo perk.  Boom, done. (Pun intended)
---
Once your bounty exceeds your caps it should handicap your character to slow walking and fast travel ONLY to vault 76 and YOUR camp (no friends or workshops). That way their only option is to lose the bounty or shuffle to a vendor and sell their stuff.
---
Would really cut down on griefers who only nuisance people by busting up their camps.
---
Small thing, but the paper mache mask, frasaumut or whatever, clips through the collar of the vault tec jumpsuit. Not sure if it is outfit or mask specific.
---
No idea, but having 10 players inside a nuke zone with 20+ monsters (at times) while some people are spamming orbital strikes made my xb1 fallout crash 3 times during the fight.  End result, she died while I was out of game and I didn't get credit.  Not sure if thats the kind of thing they are fixing.
---
There‚Äôs something you‚Äôre not telling us about your stash. I‚Äôm level 35 and am at 450 stash with absolutely no problems maintaining that. 
---
I didn't even know that servers were down? Was there a notification of this?
---
Yeah, even if you don't use my build play around with that site. It makes planning and leveling a snap.
---
You can't take caps until you're under capacity, so looks like we're making more mules
---
Saw this one outside of Morgantown. Got a screenshot of a cat following a Mr. Handy.
---
If the 3day only 20 dollar PA blackbird paint come sout again though, I've got 2k atoms saved just for that.
---
Yeah I have one, but I'm always in my Excavator armor for the carry weight boost. 
---
I started a new character to run with a friend who just started. We've both been leveling nicely. But tbf, our goal isn't to be doing SBQ immediately. I'm not sure why it'd be anyone's goal, but I'm going a lil off topic there. 
---
I'm not really referring to the tse nerf but all of their decisions in general. Tse needed a nerf, did they go overboard with it? Maybe. But as a whole, they are ruining more things than they are fixing 
---
From a vendor?  Or is this inflated by players because reasons?
---
If you have a 25k cap limit, why would someone create a cost so high?
---
Players are the problem, not the cap limit.
---
Well Adam needs to get his shit together!
---
j/k lots of good stuff in here, but the energy weapon oversight (or lack of it...? heh) is getting old.
---
Any idea what they are patching?
---
I just wish they'd shut the doors when they leave.  What, were they born in a barn!?!
---
I got handmade plans at level 76 doing patrol duty
---
The patch is a right step going forward.  But they are running out of incentives for end game players to keep playing.  
---
Too little too late for me.  I guarantee the servers will be buttery smooth for the next 24 hours and then they will descend back to poor performance.  
---
Here's hoping they are like 15k now 
---
I usually just slap 4 or 5 punji boards near my entrance and call it safe enough lol. 
---
Anyone know how much longer it‚Äôs likely to take? 
---
How‚Äôs a low level impact pvp 
---
Make sure you scrap and then bulk-wrap all your junk. You might not know about bulk wrapping at lvl 17. It's an option in your tinker's workbench list. REALLY cuts the weight. And watch out for ammo like mini-nukes, mines, fusion cores, and missiles. Damn things way a ton and are awarded by quests. You might not realize your inventory is packed full of the darn things. Also, perks like Pack Rat, Traveling Pharmacy, Bandoleer, Through Hiker, and Ordinance Express are basically mandatory at this point, since weight is such an issue. The Deep Pocketed mod is a MUST for armor, as is the "Weightless" legendary effect, if you can find gear that has it. As far as guns go, we are kind-of screwed right now. Resign yourself to only having around 4 in your inventory (I hope they patch in weapon racks later to fix this and let us collect a wider range of guns.) and only 1 heavy gun. Clothing is OK to store because it weighs almost nothing, but NEVER store armor. And lastly, any power armor parts you have stored in or on your power armor chassis only weighs 10 pounds in your inventory. Make sure you only store that stuff on the frame. 
---
Why nerf the Fatman, Missile Launcher, all sorts of grenades, and Grenade Launchers? They were already not that great, and now they'll be missing +40% damage at Demo Expert \*5...  
---
Yeah, TSE were too strong, but don't blanket nerf all explosive effects in the game. That's just lazy coding.
---
Unfortunately the legendary circuit will still require this.  Now I guess there's no need to pop into the vendors as well though.
---
They should buff all explosive weapons the amount the perk card was nerfed. I'm not talking about TSE buffs but to my fat man missile launchers auto grenade and regular grenades and mines. Characters who rely heavily on those weapons are being hit hard just because they have no idea how to fix the TSE mess. They should also make demo perk a 3 star so we can at least invest those two extra points into something worth while.
---
LOL I've been refreshing twitch over and over again to see what it will be like when I get home.
---
Like I've been holding off of joining a massive clan because the people I play with are cool.
---
The DPS we had was good enough to carry if we got large numbers of lowbys or if we got NO one to assist. 
---
Now with these hard nerfs I really wonder what the completion time will be. If I get more than two attempts with 
---
no Kill I will quit this game. 
---
NO NEW CONTENT, NO LONGER ABLE TO DO END GAME, and FORCING ME TO JOIN A UBER CLAN... I'll quit.
---
Absolutely love the fallout universe but if they just keep NERFING and PROVIDING NOTHING new there's no reason to log in with people. 
---
That's incredible dedication! Thanks for your time :)
---
Mr. Fantastic finally got too much radiation.
---
I'm so relieved the turrets will have the owners name. 
---
Now i know who to kill that camp behind the golf-course.
---
Multiple cards = stacked.  So its not 9 points for 60%.  Its 20% + 20% + 20% = like 72%.  Not a huge difference but its how it works when there are multiple cards.
---
&gt;its just not fun for me if 90% of my game experience is spent on getting rid of stuff.
---
Then maybe this game isn't for you, find a game that you do enjoy 
---
Maybe I can finally get a lever action. Level 112, not seen a single fucking one in all that time, plan, weapon drop or otherwise, haha.
---
Instead of relogging 5000 times for the chance of finding a certain plan in a vendor inventory, they'll now have dedicated plans that should show up consistently provided you are at the requisite level.
---
So if there was a small chance for say, televisions to spawn in Watoga, it should now spawn every time instead of a random occurrence. No more server hopping to find most plans
---
Is the barn buildings set rare? I through out 2 today in the suitcase at watoga train station
---
You don't even need rad-x man... like ever....
---
1 point in Rad sponge, and share it in a group.  Never worry about rads again.
---
I've gone hours through nuke zones solo and only ever had to use a couple of rad away.
---
They are "balancing" some of the perks and legendaries along with bug fixes.
---
* [Comment by Ladydevann](/r/fo76/comments/al0fiw/why_am_i_still_playing_after_435_hrs/ef9nae9/?context=1000 "posted on 2019-01-29 15:30:51 UTC"):
---
 &gt; That's incredible dedication! Thanks for your time :)
---
A more game related analogy: You can‚Äôt binge 10 Sweet Tato Stews to get HP regen equivalent to Healing Factor. 
---
Similar buffs often don‚Äôt stack. Why should Rad-X?
---
Theres a note about walls and things being added to the vendor pool, I'm hoping they added new types etc
---
They will likely have a store limit
---
Can we have some clarity on the Handmade plans? Why is it level capped at 44? Is that a bug or intended that way? Thanks!
---
Being able to buy it all RN kinda kills the struggle. I'd just check when I was there....never too much hopping, only for cals shocks for xo1
---
...you're not using the ammo perk in agility when you make ammo? You'd be making 180 per batch and not 100
---
you can whatnow
---
All the stimpacks as well 
---
Or so people can actually PVP... 
---
So now the question is: will they have all the previously ( and randomly ) available mods and plans all the time? or will some of them disappear forever from the vendor? like, for instance, will watoga vendor have T45 and T51b jetpack all the time and all the mods all the time? or they just won't be available anymore from there?
---
So unless you have legendaries and multiple perks you won't really know there has been a patch?
---
Still takes away player interaction and we don't know how the inventory for the machines will be added, if form stash there won't be big stores.
---
I wish I knew, I've been waiting an hour and 20 minutes. 
---
10:33 Eastern Standard Time
---
I don't have alt accounts. It doesn't seem fair that I can't get the best armor in the game because I don't have multiple accounts.
---
Its like they caught themselves offguard with the games release, and were completely not prepared to service their game as a service. Very weird from a AAA dev team. Well AA now to be honest.
---
Yes I totally forgot about. I have no bloodied build at all, just made some testing with :) Thanks for the advise!
---
Thad fantastic 
---
Take my upvote 
---
I have some 140 hrs, mostly from release to mid Dec. I logged on last night and had nothing to do. So I logged out. I love the game, but yeah, nothing to do (that really matters). Tiny camp, tiny stash, can't anything that takes more than 30 minutes. Farming legs reminds me of Diablo too much. 
---
I once ran one of the biggest and most successful stores in the wasteland on PS4. I only dealt in non-duped items. I even bought and built a website for my shop [www.LuckyLou.bargains](https://www.LuckyLou.bargains)   
---
I have only 9000 pounds of equipment/weapon/items because of your patch, my store is dead. I have added enjoyment and extended the playtime for many players including myself who have finished pretty much every aspect of the game but played just because of the game within the game we have created. I think I have added a lot to the fallout76 PS4 community.   
---
Why would you block the adding of Caps?  
---
So you could hurt dupers? Just remove the duped items from the game!  
---
Your systems you have in place like limited vendors who only have so many caps per day and having strict limit max caps makes no sense.   
---
You made a game where we the player are the NPCs and yet you are putting further restrictions on us?
---
My character is a salesman, so in this game world he says, "Sorry I can't sell anything else, I have too many caps?"
---
"I have too many items because I cant store them anywhere so I can't sell anymore?"  
---
I have done nothing wrong and have gone out of my way to help this game and promote this game.  Please reconsider what you have done and allow cap movement for over-encumbered characters.
---
"16 times the detail"
---
You can take her at any level, though the higher the better. 
---
It just comes down to how many other people show up.
---
You got them circuits ready?  You‚Äôll need 10-30 of them and you will be dumbfounded why you need them.
---
That is awesome.  Thank you very much.
---
Run it solo... It's easier if you do it by yourself. More people = more spawns. 
---
Use what you like.... It has no special adds or overly hard content. Use [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
 Caps is nothing. The problem lies in the people gettinf bountys in the hundreds or thousands and having 100 or leas caps because they dumped all there caps on a mule or a friend.
---
Thus negating the consequences to pvping. So if you dont have to caps for yoir bounty ya..because anything over 10-30 is intentional not accidental. 
---
Someone with hacking to pwn the turrets and a few stims / nuka's / food bits, maybe a super sledge or two.
---
I know it was, I lived getting random food lol it kept me fed. 
---
Just my two cents, but White Knight deserved the nerf. It was actually way too good, I repair my armor *maybe* once every 3 weeks of play (and I don't use PA except for nuke zones). 
---
The Rad-X stacking does suck, but I think this is more because PA/Hazmat suit have invisible extra rad resistance, because if you get up to a similar amount of rad-resist you'd still take more rads than when you wear them. 
---
For example, Fallout 4 hazmat suit had 1000 rad resist *as well as* 98% rad reduction. We just need hazmat to be wearable over/under armor, or a viable rad solution for nuke zones.
---
All about those new stairs 
---
i had gotten 2 cal shock for my X-01 and just the other day "lost" one of them. like it was on my PA..then poof gone...not in my inventory or anything. i had given one to my wife for her X-01, so hopefully i can buy another without having to get the other back from my wife.
---
Seriously. Guess I'm waving goodbye to my Two Shot combat rifle. It has served me well... 
---
Thanks, Bethesda, for this "fix".
---
Anytime
---
Let me know how far you can get the damage to go!
---
I am on xbox and already downloaded
---
I fail to see how it takes away player interaction unless you can carry 10 billion pounds of items.
---
Doesn‚Äôt this mean we aren‚Äôt screwed if somebody is server hopping and got all The stashes for themselves?
---
I read but have no confirmation that based on fallout 4 investigation, two shot is summed up before damage reduction from armor, so armor is only applied once. 
---
I just found a two shot gauss rifle yesterday. bah
---
Is Evan a guaranteed spawn yet?
---
Gun guys handle the adds and do support DPS- Melee face tanks and engages. SBQ dies on her third Land if Melee stays on it and everyone is focused and not staring at loot. 
---
I wouldn't say needed to that extent though. I get it was doing quite a fair bit of damage but I think it was more the AOE rather than the damage. Reason I say this is because there is quite a few builds that can reach the damage of TSE's or even exceed it. So damage wasn't an issue or if it is anyone with a half decent build needs to start worrying. 
---
It was more so that you could kill a group with a few shots, where as say someone using a melee build could quite easily kill all of them in one shot however has to do it to each individual out of the group and not just spam a few shots in and deal with whatever is left.
---
I honestly feel it's the content and not the speed we are doing it. They could make things harder and that would benefit the min/maxers as well as the casual players. I was able to complete the game in the beta when I didn't have any TSE's and mauled everything lvl 30+ with just melee and PA so nerfing a gun into the ground isn't going to stop people speeding through, it's just going to kill off certain builds only to be replaced with others. That's not a good way to go about if you want a long lasting MMORPG as people will get bored of constantly chopping and changing their builds to get the min/max which are usually the people who will be playing/spending the most.
---
This actor is really sticking his neck out on the line for his craft. Loving his work.
---
they will try that the server does not fall, because they will have to extend the time of the event to 1 hour with the little damage of the shots  
---
Dont use energy weapons because you will be doing about 2x less damage. They need buffed. Grenades, stimpaks, fusion cores for PA, and vats all the turrets.
---
I'm a heavy weapon user too, primarily using gatling guns and miniguns... Before this patch I felt I needed at least explosive or twoshot on said guns. Otherwise the resources expended and degradation to weapon condition compared to other weapons, like rifles, felt practically non-viable.
---
I'm afraid that when I'm able to get on and try this patch I'm going to find myself needing to completely change my build.
---
Collateral nerfs :(
---
Oof..
---
Waitttt what?? Just like on the ring boundary a few times? I've had this glitch before and never knew how it happened.
---
oh you mean the lack of npcs to care about, the lack of storyline  or the storyline that it hints at and and never reaches conclusion like oh of you kill the queen the scorched will die off lollol jk scorched everywhere baby or are you talking bout the lack of endgame content besides grinding for the current best loadout before bethesda nerfs it to oblivion i mean name one meaningful buff to a underworked weapon they did in the whole 76 days of the game being out they havent added any new content Hell id even say that at least sea of thieves had regular global events and content drops oh yeah and sea of thieves another triple AAA title has No Micro Transactions IN 2019 Its LEGENDARY
---
Ya, that looks pretty dang good!
---
Praise the lord and pass the amminition!
---
From players obviously. Sentinel assassin reduces damage from players by 8percent per piece and a further 15 per piece if you aren't moving that's 92 percent mitigation without any perks if not moving 
---
How can you be immune to explosive damage?  "Padded" armor?  
---
It *is* bad design if MOST of the game is figuring how how to exploit the most perfect combinations of buffs/perks etc., and having to entirely focus your character around those particular optimizations rather than a game system which allows people to have ***viable*** characters built around *how they WANT to play*. 
---
Because this game NEEDED a lot of nerfs.  It's obscene the amount of damage you could put out using a TSE with max rifleman and max explosive dmg perk.
---
I get that it directly affected certain explosive weapons builds... but while it's an option, it's not the best option for damage output.  Sure, you could build your character as an energy weapons / radiation damage character... the items exist even if the perks don't.  But, the way this game is set up, that would be rather useless.  Everything but other players are immune to radiation, and 90% of them are in power armor, so they don't get affected by rads.  Making things like the gamma gun and radium rifle absolutely dumb items for the game to even have.
---
This a great improvement over server hopping. I wonder if this will also be positive for server stability.
---
That's because the frames are all named the same, show the same graphic, and can't be renamed.  That's what the fix _should_ have been.
---
im one of the guys building a raider group on PS4. Just going through some growing pains as we waited for BSG to update us with the new stuff for PVP and system changes. I'm going to drop a discord link sometime this afternoon or tomorrow in r/fallout76factions keep your eyes peeled
---
PS4, same problem. 41.51gb! I do not have that much room left! What is happening?!? üò≠
---
The devs said they 'felt' it needed a nerf.  I'd rather an explanation or some data exactly why they decided to nerf.  I hope the felt was based on data rather than emotion.
---
Don't u ever underestimate a chimpanzee like that again.
---
Oh ok yeah I've been grinding for 2 days for the pink one...
---
Tho some of the hats are bugged or something, the pink one isn't pink at all but white and blue, the Forrest one isn't either the yellow one is multi colored...
---
I thought for a second it was (one sec while I find it)
---
They added a set limit on being over encumbered which is 1500 pounds more than your carry weight at the time. I.e. If you carry weight is 250 you can carry a max of 1750 pounds. 
---
Hmm, still nothing.
---
Level 3 hacking will make the experience that little bit nicer
---
Ok Some of us farm, and put stuff on our mules, So our mains can continue playing, So now we cannot get anything else, no more mats, no more weapons or anything to give to our mules? What kind mickey mouse shenanigans is this?   
---
Funny how the consoles have less issues, get better loot because Bethesda has to meet standards on patches and servers so the console players cannot yell at Microsoft and Sony. But us PC players no standards are in place so Bethesda gets to use the lowest bidder with under performing servers.  So instead of you know not spending so much on advertising and instead getting better servers those of us who farm for our stores pick of every item dropped, and surf around the map to vendors to find stuff people discard are getting punished, Way to go...  
---
There is a reason the game has lost over 50% of its player base already, its stuff like this, the nerfs on rewards/loot to xp for grinding out stuff. Hope you are ready to lose 50% more of the player base that you have already lost. Way to go Bethesda way to go.  
---
TSE and explosive weapons, you have nerfed when that was not the issue armor, with the dense mod, perks, mutations at least you could fight back and not take hardly any damage to some damage. When it was in fact bobble head stacking. A lot of players have farmed caps, to found crazy stuff that people wanted to get them to give people a TSE. Now all those hours are down the drain.  Once again way to go Bethesda.  
---
Those that cried on here and [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) congrats, you have helped contribute to the killing of the game. I highly doubt you purchase enough atoms to keep the servers going and for them to invest resources into new content.
---
I really hope so. I'll be extra salty if they try to sell us assets already in Appalachia.
---
The vanilla ( Atomic Shop free ) options for C.A.M.P.s are so limited. I used to love building but it got so bland. Even with super crazy builds, I feel like it always comes down to feeling like I'm building the same things over and over... Especially when it comes to interiors. Everyone pretty much has the same things except maybe it's in a different room.
---
&gt;FizzB00m
---
Same
---
I think it's only added if you kill the SBQ, because some people accidentally scrapped the armor you get? Just guessing
---
Of course not. This is Bethesda's way of artificially extending the gameplay feedback loop without adding new content.
---
I'm getting close to that number of hours played. Albeit my ~375 hours is split (mostly me) between me and my 14 yo son. Just hit lvl 99 last night, and still having fun. Imo, it's a world that feels "right" to be lived in. It just hits on so many things that other "mmo's" do wrong for me. Which makes the ever shrinking list of flaws that much more palatable for me. It really says a lot that I was looking forward, and purchased RDR2 on day one and I've yet to play it. I was also looking forward to 76, but wasn't anticipating being this into it. Works for me though!
---
I‚Äôd post pics but I have stacked columns, gotta have them under open sky and not near anything, basically you need to build around it.
---
Just move on I did this weekend and it's great to not play anymore
---
Use a gatling gun instead of minigun, it shoots slower but hits harder, also you dont waste too much ammo with it and its easy to craft 5mm ammo
---
Who knows? Maybe that's the next fallout game
---
I get around this somewhat by swapping in the "Weaponsmith" card when repairing my guns so they start with 2x the condition bar, then swapping to "Gunsmith" which makes them break 200% slower. I can go for 2 queen fights blazing away with Ma Deuce before she breaks, or spam the shit out of The Dragon. :) Ammo is still an issue with that .50 cal, though...ouch. Even WITH Ammosmith and Super Duper crafting. The steel scrap I burn through...
---
erm you could stop stashing every single item?
---
No more inventory management would surly be a big + yea?
---
Certain plans, such as the often mentioned handmade rifle, were level locked and didn't appear past a certain point. This change gets rid of that restriction and makes them easier to get hold of.
---
Scrapping yeah but selling them would break the economy I think. 
---
The thing is, they are destroying viable things  to correct mistakes that can be corrected without doing so. This is exactly fitting with the way they were handling this fiasco so far. I don't see why they won't continue to do so in future updates, which means it's just a matter of time before other viable builds are destroyed.
---
Separate thoughts, it nice that there's an announcement for hunter hunted, and its nice there's a weight limit to fight dupers. I'm super excited for a bit more PVP! 
---
I got told off once for this, but they need to deeply consider the "balance" updates they do. Some of them have just been shit decisions made for no reason other than to make the game harder to play, I guess to please the more hardcore gamers? I HATE that my fusion cores don't re-up when I log in. Not that I went and server hopped to fill them. It was just nice to start each play fresh. Now I'm hoarding them. 
---
And this event made me appreciate the community of vault 76 so much more. Hell even if I only got 1-2 stews I'd be happy. I just liked seeing them show up and throwing a thanks out to whatever team was looking out for the server.  I don't really run in teams because I play so erratically so I couldn't do that event, see as some others. But I always laid out some love to those that did. Real heros of the server. Now they took that away? No wonder I haven't seen any. I just figured I was never on the right server at the right time
---
You can have my upvote for the water pistol remark!
---
&gt; As mentioned in a previous Inside the Vault article, both the explosive mod and two shot weapons could result in dealing very high amounts of damage, and this was compounded if two shot and explosive were combined. We‚Äôve decided to tone both of these damage bonuses back. 
---
I wish they would just take people's (ridiculously unfair) grandfathered-in TSE guns away instead of nerfing both mods, which are not exactly overpowered when standalone.
---
I love how their reasoning behind it was to not make White Night a "mandatory pick". It wouldn't be a mandatory pick if armor didn't break every five minutes without it. Maybe Bethesda should finally get the point we've all been trying to make that armor and weapons break way too fast without these perks. 
---
That's an interesting playstyle, if I had a problem with the games quests or writing I don't think the gameplay mechanics alone would be enough to keep me playing.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Some people need to be taken by the hand. It's a bit annoying tbh. Whine and you shall receive. 
---
How I'm looking right now and can't download an update. 
---
It is an amazing weapon. If you max out the swing your weapons faster perk you're like a Cuisinart taking enemies apart.
---
Patrol duty gives it, i received it at level 76
---
Between two and four hours.
---
A design philosophy I've always hated. One of the points where Destiny 2 really started turning around was where someone in the development team clearly asked everyone "why not?" One day. And instead of nerfing everything into the ground buffs starting rolling out. We were allowed to feel *powerful*, and then they were able to give us more difficult challenges as a result.
---
Honestly, it was your weapon choices.  Other than lasers, you listed the three most underwhelming weapons in the game.
---
I've never seen this in the game.  When I see glitched enemies, they are just frozen when they are alive, or still moving when they are dead, lol.
---
‚Äú now instead of one shooting everyone I have to shoot them 3 times ‚Äú
---
More like nerf nerf nerf fix
---
thank you
---
A update or 2 more and the game will be in great condition and ready for more content!
---
It started downloading by itself
---
I'm pretty sure we'll see that happened in a month or so. They probably want to weed out all the people with their 10 million plus carry weight and it sure everything's stable before they kick it up to a thousand in the staff for us.
---
Its too little too late. the SBQ needed to be stabilized and exploits patched out months ago. Nothing they are doing or have planned are going to draw more people to the game. Their ace in their pocket is opening the new vaults, and when they do everyone is going to be underwhelmed.
---
Any items dropped by a character over the +1500 weight limit should instantly despawn.  You‚Äôve already address being able to pick up new items, and selling/trading items for caps, but you have not addressed moving items to new mules to continue selling on the eBay market.
---
Tell me my lvl38 now has a chance to find a Handmade Rifle plan...
---
Oh if they could only treat a Hazmat suit as Clothing. I went through a nuke-zone in a Hazmat Suit last night. Marsupial kept me alive, the Hazmat Suit sure as hell didn't. If it worked *with* armour then PA would actually have some competition.
---
Yea, pretty sure you gotta 'instance' into it. It's not a map location. 
---
Why pissed off?
---
If you know its your adhd thing, surely this will release some of the pressure you put on yourself to absolutely pick up and stash every single item that drops?
---
Does clearing areas not take 10 times longer when your looting every single container and trying to make space for it?
---
There's a reply earlier that they're looking into it.
---
I sunk five points. I carry one of each of the explosive weapons. I figured out ways and situations where they are actually useful. Today‚Äôs patch has ruined all of that. And they have been notified, so that means, assuming they address it, I have to wait 2+ months for a fix.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna play my melee alt. **Non-legendary** explosive weapons are a fool‚Äôs errand right now.
---
The problem though is that you can't undercut someone on an extremely rare piece of armor. Without duping people wouldn't even sell this stuff because it's so incredibly rare.
---
More importantly there shouldn't be massively OP gear, that people are willing to buy on eBay with real money, in a PvP game. 
---
Bring a magazine that reduces damage from robots.
---
Why would xp in a online only coop style game be shared with teammates? /s
---
CTRL+F "buff"
---
Huh. Maybe one day.
---
Yea, few is probably a exaggeration, i'm sure you can find a youtube vid showing it.
---
Just do it until you stop taking rads, who knows if the latest patch fixed it tho
---
hot fix it tomorrow. Its been 76 days. this isn't a difficult fix. 
---
It's not in this patch, but they are aware and working on that issue as well. I wish I could give you a better answer on that one :(
---
yeah, do you have an ultracite explosive vent? 
---
***\*REEEEEEEEE!!\****
---
Issue seen on PS4:
---
The VTU Ballcap is invisible on the inspect item screen. When it is equipped, it is oversized compared to the regular Baseball Cap and the Ballcaps available in the Atomic Shop. 
---
Basically the VTU Ballcap is too big and needs to be resized back down to the normal Ballcap size. 
---
If this cuts into your income I can help you out financially with a certain sale.... 
---
Yes, please address the energy weapons issues so we can actually use them. We will all appreciate it. Thanks
---
Holy fuck yes! I‚Äôd respec my explosives main so fast. 
---
If you have too much inventory and aren't selling you have to adjust your approach to the market. Maybe even by...in person marketing. This will make player interaction MORE important, not less.
---
Definitely, it's all apart of the energy weapon discussion as a whole.
---
Thank you, as a demolition man with an inventory of nothing but fatmen, missile launchers, auto grenade launcher and every type of throwable grenade today's patch just makes me not want to play anymore. Yeah I want doing TSE damage but I knew in a large event fight(those are rare) or a SBQ fight I was at least able to help keep the heavy hitters on the queen alive by just demoing all the mobs. Oh no mobs spawned right under her with all our melees? Here comes Daisycutter to clear it out. Yeah it does no damage to the queen but it helped everyone else out. If they don't revert the perk, at least boost all non legendary effect explosives the amount the perk was nerfed.
---
Game clearly isn't designed for us to be able to have 1 of everything though let along stacks and stacks.
---
What about NERF, fix fix ?
---
whole lotta nope. give us more serious things.
---
I need the Nuka bed! And looking forward to the VT pip boy skin. The unstoppables stuff looks great, too. Though I dont like that manta man costume. Thats too much for me.
---
And people have been asking for mothman items, seems bethesda listened. Also Bethesda switched from sleeping beds to real beds. Im sure beds will be more popular than sleeping bags.
---
So whats a human in F76? other players and thats it?
---
5 character limit I believe, so it will, hopefully, limit things nicely.
---
My friends and I were hypothesizing on whether or not they'd be smart enough to make changes to loot for survival. I want to PVP and look forward to survival. This is only because I have a few friends that actually prepared for it. If they force us to RE-LEVEL we will quit. We don't mind having to re-grind gear what we WON'T accept is re-leveling. 
---
PVP is pointless currently... Caps don't matter, Junk doesn't matter, and end game content is needed.
---
A leader board might get some to play but I doubt it will cause that masses to transfer in droves.
---
Also with the new system for survival, PVE content is pointless without buffs. Like who is going to run SBQ to have the same shitty loot with the change of raiders murdering you as your attempting the kill.
---
Now with that being said I know that MAJORITY have no desire to PVP. They want new PVE content and I agree with them. Gear grinding is essential to the longevity of the game, with no new content, or new PVE content people are going to quit. If they are able to provide new ATOMIC shop content on a weekly basis it shouldn't take 5 months to implement a new monsters or a dungeon.  
---
Not if you remove receiver mods like Hardened to normalize.  .308 would rank above .38 and you know it.
---
0ahUKEwjzze38qZPgAhWQB3wKHf32DUw4FBCCNgi
---
Blame this trash and griefers.. they'll tool things and get it right
---
No, we'll just have to wait until a future patch to get the reward.
---
Make a game that doesn't work, then Look Great Replying as you spent most of your budget on people to reply on a game that doesn't work. üëç
---
What about drills, flare pistols and syringers dropping from legendary enemies? I'm still pretty annoyed about getting a drill from the Queen and a syringer from a 3 star protectron last night.
---
&gt; accidentally scrapped the armor
---
Holy crap, I'd be so pissed if I did that. 
---
I have to disagree, I've built MANY camps as have my friends, they never look the same inside. The lights that you can set the color on make a massive difference (cycling light - hangs from ceiling and part of Assorted Lights set) to the feeling of a place. 
---
My friends house is a cozy brick place with carpets, mine is a multicolored collage that looks like somewhere a rave would happen.
---
To I wanna hear from one. Like an actual ‚ÄúI carry 80,000 of every bobble head in my mule‚Äù duper. 
---
Does this actually affect you? Why?
---
What would you need the mats for?
---
Once you made your camp your pretty much good, once you made your armour and weapons and PA your good.
---
Don't need enough to make 10 of each item all at once do ya?
---
Well yeah, when you look at it that way i guess it kinda will release some pressure.
---
Actually thanks for opening my eyes for a different play style :)
---
I've done that 3 times now and have not received it. I remember reading someone found it in a pile scorchbeast shit. I know that its still available but I do not think its purchasable. 
---
Even if it got fixed people would just wall in the workshop contesting thing with the stash boxes
---
I‚Äôm also a hoarder and just use every weight reduction perk card, my normal weight is just barely under this maxed out. I‚Äôm worried and I don‚Äôt dupe I just hoard heavy guns, ammo, chems, shotguns, and clothing üòÇ
---
I should be able to use a minigun if I want. It should be as good as a Gatling gun. I used to use a Gatling gun till I got my tse minigun but I hated it. I prefer the minigun as a main weapon because I like the look, sound and usage. I don't want to have to use a weapon I hate just so I can be able to kill enemies.
---
You cant fast travel when overencumbered 
---
Depends on who "We" is and in that instance yes. But they could just make it instance based like they are but also allow the current method to work too.
---
Like I said it's the same as server hopping for Nuke Zones at White Springs and hoarding Glowing one's or Server Hopping for Scorch Beast Queen and making it more difficult for the one who initiated the Nuke only to get a few shots in an loot.
---
These are all types of exploity player behavior but on the more tame side. Cap stashes though did not effect other players quality of life in regards to playing the game. It just meant someone else got there first (unlike my other 2 examples that can really be unfair).
---
Cap stashes also did not seem to have a 24 hour time limit respawn. If I remember correctly they followed the rules of "If an area was empty of players for long enough of a time they respawned". Which isn't that damaging to others.
---
Where nuke zone server hopping quite literally hinders other players performance for the amount of time and resources needed to create that Nuke zone.
---
And what about an entire game based on pre-war events like Operation Anchorage? Bethesda is great in doing FPS, I litteraly love Doom and Wolfenstein, and I believe that a spin off game, with some mechanics and classic Fallout style, would be awesome. I would like to fight in the Alaskan war as a soldier, attack China on their same soil, as the lore, maybe even just be a normal american citizen in this hard times or fight on the Moon as seen in the FO4 museum. I would definitely call a game like this not Fallout, but something like **2076**
---
I'm asking the Dev's for clarity on this one for you guys.
---
Good. Fuck server hopping.
---
Might be that the high-level dungeon in this case will be another RPG. The Outer Worlds, perhaps? 
---
Im being negative, I know. Sorry. But they bring out the best in me.
---
The grafton steel roof spawn is a random weapon plan spawn, so you're still fighting about 20:1 odds.
---
Easiest way to find out is just take it off in game and then look to see the change but I'm at work right now plus these updates takes hours for some fucking reason so idk if it will even be up by the time i get off work
---
Right?  Making it less effective isn't how you make it not a mandatory pick.  Fixing the mechanic that necessitates everyone using it is.  It isn't that those perks are  overperforming, it's that that level of performance was necessary. 
---
&gt;Considering the game hasn't been out even 3 months
---
Most people would be fired for taking an entire fiscal quarter to get something into a state it should have been in from the start.
---
Idealistically, there should still be a way to farm up wood legendaries 1* through 3* in an event or something, for the folk who use wood armour for their stealth builds. Outright removing it from the pool removes that player choice completely.
---
##Communication:
---
* Voice Chat - Auto setting should allow your team to hear you and people not in your team to hear you when they are in your area.  Or at least add an additional setting that would allow this to be in effect.  As it is now Auto lets you talk and hear team anywhere, and hear other people in your proximity, but they cannot hear you.
---
* Text Chat -  UPDATE:  Bethesda is looking into this
---
* In Game Bug / Player / Suggestion Report - Please give us the ability to report bugs or players.  Make it take a log snapshot and maybe an auto image of what we are reporting.
---
##Vendors:
---
* Display preview of the item especially if its a Plan.  Plan: Modern Couch - how do I know what it looks like?
---
* Plan should have same name as what they make.  Some plans do not have same name.
---
* If I buy 200 caps worth of stuff from a vendor, that should now be in their cash pool.  As it is now, it just adds like 55 caps to their pool.
---
* Remove Cap limits &amp; Increase Caps on vendors
---
##Perk / SPECIAL:
---
* Ability to downgrade. i.e. break a level 3 into a level 1 and a level 2 card.  Some of us upgraded too early.
---
* Respec Options:  After level 50 you can do the choice of 1 card or move one point, but also, at any time (after 50) you can sacrifice a card for ability to move one point. Maybe through a workbench.
---
 * 1 point per level of card. i.e. level 3 card 3 points, level 5 card 5 points.  This would be a good way for us to be able to get rid of unused / duplicate cards.
---
* Scrapper Perk - Should give screws and springs from scrapping weapons - and allow you to break down ammo into its elements (at a loss of course).
---
* Makeshift Warrior/Gunsmith Either buffed (90% slower wear) or Rank reduction to 3 Ranks (20/40/60%)
---
* Perception - Should increase ranged damage like Strength does for Melee.
---
##Team/Friends:
---
* Map - Have team mates show as different color dot instead of the default.  Also maybe a separate 3rd color for friends as well.
---
* Friends / Block list - It should be an either / or, not possible to be both. A person on your friends list should not be block-able.... 
---
* Block List - show a list of people blocked, See above.
---
* Team Workshop should allow fast travel to anyone on the team.
---
##Key-binds:
---
 * Allow change of Map and Menu buttons.  i.e. Esc key set to just pull up menu, and M for Map.
---
 * Allow change of Grenade key-bind (G in every other game, but long press E here)
---
 * Re-work the key-binds so that there aren‚Äôt 3 different ways to go back. Currently tab, Esc and space bar are all used to go back in menus depending on which screen you are on
---
 * ability to rebind any keys... not everyone uses QWERTY
---
 * Mouse Wheel button to bring up favorite menu.
---
 * Key-bind for going directly to photo-mode.
---
 * Show us and allow us to change the secondary key assigned to a command, and allow us to split up currently merged keys. For example, to enter workshop mode or third person view, V and Mouse3 are both assigned to this. The key-binds screen only shows you that V is assigned, and if you change V to do something else, Mouse3 will do that too. So in this example, we should be able to set V and Mouse3 to do independent things and also be able to set different keys for workshop and third person.
---
 * Ability to change the interact keys.  Trying to Reload my weapon in combat with R but now I am in a corpses inventory swap, rush to get out and hit Esc, now I am at the map, have to hit esc again.... hope I am not dead.
---
##Inventory / Stash
---
* Inventory sort option by total weight rather than by the individual item in the stack.
---
* Inventory summary of weight by category page your on.
---
* General sorting / logic
---
 * Sort option for most recently looted (help with notes or holotapes)
---
 * Sub-categories in aid, Misc, Notes etc
---
 * Power Armor chassis - Way to see which chassis is which in our inventory.... show what armor is on the chassis.
---
* Add some color or icons to better differentiate types of loot (all drinks with a glass icon, all food with a plate icon)
---
* Separate storage for Vanity stuff so it doesn't count against your stash limit.
---
* Separate containers for different type of items with separate stash limit. Aid / Ammo / Weapons / etc.
---
* Ability to set inventory limits. i.e. Scrap Steel never store in stash over 300.  I don't need 1000.
---
* Highlight new items in your inventory. When you are picking up so many holo-tapes and items, all while trying to listen to them and communicate with team mates it is so easy to miss something crucial you picked up and then not remember the name of the item.
---
* Holo tapes you have listened to should be grayed out in the inventory.
---
* Quest items that you cannot stash / destroy etc should have 0 weight.
---
* Ability to loot all from my stash.
---
* Ability to loot all from my stash by category. i.e. go into Junk tab and loot all will just do that category.
---
* Naming convention - 
---
 * Junk components should be named consistently across the various inventory and crafting interfaces. They should sort in a logical, alphabetical order, and I shouldn't need to memorize alternate item names. Screws should be under S for Screws, not L for Loose screws; Acid should be under A , not W; Adhesive under A, not E; etc. Just get rid of all the preceding descriptors and add scrap to the end where appropriate. Raw leather should be leather scrap and so forth.
---
 * Armor - Name should start with common info Type - Body Part - Mods    So Metal Arm Left pocketed  Same with power armor pieces.
---
 * Weapons - Name should start with common info. Type - Mods   So, Combat Shotgun piercing.
---
* Weapon / Armor Re-naming.  Allow me to make the name for the item.
---
* Storage box with 50lb weight limit (not stash related) that can be accessed across characters.
---
* Rifle weight needs to be dramatically reduced or give us a perk card that does this.
---
##UI:
---
* Fast Travel - Do the "enemies nearby" and "over encumbered" checks before verifying if I want to fast travel.
---
* Condition indicator for presently equipped weapon.  Yes it shows when your at 10% but would like to see an ever present one.
---
* Enable the mouse and keyboard so that menus can also be accessed that way
---
* Power Armor HUD - Give option to use default HUD.
---
* Make glow-sights / reflex dots visible while cloaked (chameleon)
---
* Terminal - Loading holo-tapes: List in alphabetical order.  And when at  a terminal like supply drop console, put the required tape at the top.
---
##Crafting/Scrapping/Repair:
---
* Cooking - Recipes should allow use of higher level water.  i.e. if recipe calls for dirty water, you can use boiled, and purified water.  If it calls for Boiled, you can use purified water... but not dirty, etc.
---
* Adhesive - Spoiled Fruit and Vegetables should be usable to craft this... go ahead touch a spoiled fruit or veggie... very sticky.
---
* Ability to Scrap Ammo to get Lead, Gunpowder and Steel.
---
* Some junk items get scrapped but they themselves are used for crafting stuff.  Give recipe to re-craft that item or allow flagging to not scrap.
---
* Repairing an item should not take materials that were not required to make it.  Leather armor level 20 takes ballistic material to repair, but it doesn't take any to create the armor.  It's easier to just make new armor considering the ballistic material is hard to find.
---
* Stash - Ability to Drop / Destroy item directly from the menu.
---
* Bulk Crafting - Making bullets, Boiled water, Mutt Chops? - how many do you want to craft then just do one ka-ching.
---
* Repair - Reward those that Upkeep Armor/Weapons - Make it so the "rare" materials needed to upkeep your gear cost less.
---
 * 99%-60% = 0 Ballistic Fiber/Screws/Nuclear Material
---
 * 59%-30% = 1 Ballistic Fiber/ 1-2 Screws etc Rare Mats
---
 * 29%-10% = 2 Ballistic Fiber/ 2-4 Screws etc Rare Mats
---
 * 9% - Broken = Same cost as to build a new item
---
When crafting - Show me how many of the item I am crafting that I have already.  i.e. Ammo, Food, drink etc.
---
##C.A.M.P.:
---
* CAMP items affect camp - This gives a practical application to specific items in our camp to benefit us with.
---
 * Nuka cola fridge? Nuka cola's -&gt; ice cold nuka cola's.
---
 * Crates, etc... reduced weight of x item type in stash.
---
 * Television playing? Give us well tuned/rested if we stay at our camp for long enough.
---
* New container type - Gift / giveaway - Anything you put in there someone can take without repercussions.
---
* Ability to display out collection -
---
 * Power Armor.
---
 * Display cases for - Bobble Heads, Teddy Bears, Gnomes, etc.
---
* Turret - Improve range.  Mobs are shooting my base but turrets are not returning fire.
---
##Workshop:
---
* Needs some form of notification when resource gathering is full / maxed.
---
* Needs Team notification when workshop is under attack.
---
##PvP:
---
* If you initiate combat via "slap" you should wave your rights to revenge if you lose and must respawn at your camp, and if no camp forced respawn at Vault 76.  If you lose, you lose.
---
* Passive flag - Make it real.  If I flag passive, I cannot damage anyone, and they cannot damage me. 
---
* When a teammate is flagged for PvP teammate camp or workshop should not attack.
---
##General:
---
* Atomic Shop - Show both Male and Female models in the outfit, or provide a Preview with your present character selected.
---
* Make Train stations/Red Rocket Fast Travel Cheaper/No Cost
---
* Power Armor - 
---
 * Allow fist weapons to be usable.
---
 * Should take lowest Fusion Core when refilling.
---
* End Game content that doesn't force Power Armor.
---
* Hazmat Suit that you can wear with Armor.
---
* A way to see recently killed / loot able corpses in all the mire and detritus of combat.  Have lost way to many Boss mobs in the mess.
---
* More visible paper bag from death.  That bag needs to glow in the dark please.
---
* Gas Masks / Power Armor Chassis on your favorites wheel
---
* Photo Mode - Poses for when your sitting on your beloved couch.
---
* Holo-tapes should use the Volume from Voice not Effects.  (its a voice we are trying to hear not gun shots)
---
I received it between 7-10 attempts from memory but could take less or more depending on RNG
---
Well, they don't want you to horde and hole up in some shack all day. They want you to go "Oh, I need this material to upgrade my weapon!" Then go out on an expedition to collect supplies. Not "Oh I need this material to upgrade my weapon! Time to get transfer items from my other character!"
---
A skin for the for the flamer that throws cotton candy instead of flames, or something equally stupid, would win.
---
1500-lb carry limit is good enough for most players so I don't expect too many complaints.  I get overencumbered constantly and I rarely reach even 1000 lbs.
---
I must have missed where the caps are limited. Ive reread the notes, I'll head to the official page too. Can you help me out here, what am I missing?
---

---
 &gt; I'm asking the Dev's for clarity on this one for you guys.
---
Try deleting it all then only picking up what you have tagged in the search, might seem difficult at first but it will make playing more fun as it wont just be a collect mats and manage Inventory space sim
---
Fallout didn't always have achievements
---
&gt; Hotkeys: Fallout 76 now better supports French AZERTY keyboard layouts and the game‚Äôs controls will adjust accordingly.  
---
The words I'm waiting for since the launch of Fallout 4.  
---
Good news for the Ultracite Armor too, I've dropped it, thinking it was only a frame.
---
&gt; 
---
I don't think this game was ever intended for solo play, especially in nuke zones.  What you want out of a rad suit or non PA armor would pretty much make the power armor useless except for increased carry weight.  Since there are no legendary PA pieces.  
---
You can feel free to play however you want, but don't expect solo to be as good as group play.  Otherwise what's the point in groups?
---
I sure hope that is what it means. After a frustratingly high number of uncounted tries for my second calibrated shock I started counting, at 156 now and still no luck. Having miss matched legs really annoyed me. I can‚Äôt wait to get home from work and fix this. 
---
[Patch Notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019) 
---
My wife thinks so.
---
hey let me try im pretty sure i can stagger you and make you move.
---
Nah, that sub is for us dads who don't spend 8+ hours daily playing this game, but enjoy it anyway.
---
I have an instigating fire axe, with 40% power attack, faster swing speed, and max slugger perks. 
---
&gt; Btw, it's better to suggest improvements via their Feedback Support Ticket or the official forums. 
---
This stuff has been suggest dozens of times all over the place.
---
Ok i get that TSE weapons are considered to be the root of every problem on Earth here so let's not talk about them. Let's talk about actual explosive weapons instead: they were useless. Even 2-Shot ones were useless. TS RL at 200% condition could fire 8 shots before breaking. And that was only enough to take like 50% of regular SB's HP. M79 had similar damage to a fart in a puddle. Both weapons and ammo are very very heavy. Now you guys nerfed Demo Expert and TS legendary mod...so where does this leave explosive weapons? All you had to do to solve TSE problem is to move explosive mod from secondary prefix pool to primary prefix pool so it would be mutually exlusive with two-shot, Maybe tone it down by about 40-60% and everyone would be happy. Instead in an attempt to fix one problem you broke an entire category of weapons that were already heavily underperforming and managed to piss on whole bunch of TS weapon users as well. Now i'm sorry if i sound snarky here, but from my perspective as a user it looks like you guys didn't even bother to think things through here.

Legendary enemies in general need a look at. Constantly running away, it get's annoying chasing a 3 star legendary halfway across Harpers Ferry or chasing it around Watoga or somesuch and when I finally get it and kill it it drops a single star weapon.
---
Hell if you're gonna have it so 3 star enemies can drop 1 and 2 star items then make it so 1 and 2 star enemies can drop 3 star items. 
---
&gt;Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
So I guess the explosive gatling plasma I found last week is going to be super rare now.  Not that it's actually worth using.
---
Are you on xbox? Ill pay 10x that amount
---
Well don't be a kelpto and put everything in your pockets. You could head twords the exit at the 30 second mark before it starts the escape with your life count down.
---
Every day. 
---
WoW up till Cata (Stopped playing after that). You had dungeons that were hard enough make team wipe and keep them entertained. You needed actually be geared, know the tactics and actually use your brain. You could just be idiot, who did 1 damage and hide in corner. Big raids that gave opportunity to form guilds and progress as guild, and earn unique raid rewards. Battleground with PVP and rewards. For competitive side there was Arena that gave seasonal unique rewards. And after all that you could organize faction events, siege opposing faction town, kill its boss and earn unique mount.
---
Don‚Äôt encourage them to ‚Äúnerf‚Äù anything else.   It‚Äôs almost like they want the game to be less fun.  
---
Fucking yellow mermaid man!
---
"To the invisible boat mobile!!!"
---
Sent the guy a message after, because i thought he 'set' the Deathclaw on me (As his base was right near V76) but he immediately apologised, dropped me a few waters and low level weapons, and now we meet up every now and again. Made me much more positive about the Fo76 community
---
Or was it + strength instead of swing speed? Don't remember.
---
I have three characters, each one is melee (Unarmed, One handed and Two handed each) and i see a LOT of other players using melee as well. Melee is already very common
---
Because it keeps teams balanced. Otherwise you end up with a level disparity within the team, which means that a team cannot always move through the story at the same time. It becomes frustrating, and instead of having epic firefights against a horde of enemies, you find yourself only tagging them so that everyone gets exp, which is not fun at all. 
---
God I hope so man. I really hope so.
---
Correction. I had to make enough space for the 40gb download, but after the preparing the 40gb update, when it started it was only 3.678gb. I had to delete Spider-Man for this?!? ü§¨
---
That's... very wrong
---
Hey u/LadyDevann bro you know the hunter/hunted change. Will we have an option to not show that message on our screen in settings?. Just for us that depise pvp in Fallout?.
---
I know the mode struggles hard due to lack of players using it. But alot of us just dislike 76s pvp. I would love an option to fully avoid it and all messages from it.
---
I can definitely pass it along.
---
Like they'll ever tell you.
---
Private servers were promised in a future update. If nothing else, wait until those go live and then buy it... but I think the game will be around for a while.
---
No i feel that. Im currently running Int Str and Con and its mostly Melee damage and armor repair perks
---
I get that. I think they really missed an opportunity here to make a bunch of people happy and increase the stash sizes once more considering the weight reduction fix for those over Max.
---
It's going to make mule's drop a lot of inventory thus improving server stability and freeing up server space in the long run.
---
Server stash maxes definitely effect my gameplay in regards to what I will or will not do in game. If your going to make me choose between dropping my legendary or getting resources....... whelp that's not happening.
---
No sense in farming with those restrictions.
---
I took mine along on my first Silo run yesterday. It is a one star 2-shot. It did terrible damage against the robots. I thought it would be just what it needed but sadly it was not.
---
I hit my 45th Patrol Duty event last night. It's gotten to the point that I just drop plasma gun and M79 plans. Double digits of both... :/
---
I mean I might still give it a try because I know gunsmith and such do 50% and they help a fair bit.
---
So hopefully we're just over-reacting and it's not that.
---
But I very very much doubt it. 
---
I don't see any cats.
---
This patch is going to completely fuck my big-guns-go-boom build that I have. Launchers already suck but sure, let‚Äôs nerf their damage even more
---
Agreed, God of War was $25 bucks in the ps store so got it to waste some time.  Hoping fo76 gets some good solid content before march.  If not will probably just move on to division 2 and see if it‚Äôs worth playing.  Not against the PvP mode at all, just don‚Äôt think they have even close to enough end game content pve wise to be making pvp a focus at the moment.  
---
I just got the handmade plans yesterday after server hopping for 2 days and doing 10 patrol dutys. Guess I should have waited lol.
---

---
 &gt; I can definitely pass it along.
---
That's what Private servers will be for.
---
This is fantastic
---
Yeah, really don't get this.. I've never had a TSE or even bothered uses a Dragon (had one in stash), and managed to kill everything I've come across. Sure, its taken ammo and I've died a few times, but isn't it supposed to be a challenge? If I could one shot everything all the time this game would be boring AF.
---
Good patch!
---
^^^Still ^^^need ^^^to ^^^whinge ^^^a ^^^little, ^^^muh ^^^demolition ^^^expert!
---
You should try it, instead of needing an exploit to enjoy group content?  It's a lot of fun with others, it's the reason I'm still playing.  
---
I KILLED A MAN WITH A TRIDENT.
---
You are a legend.  
---
The RNG gods are not a fan of you 
---
Especially because the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù after the fact‚Äîone may have a lot of points into a build that becomes ineffective ex post facto. 
---
I'll stand still thank you very much!
---
This is exactly my point. It shouldn't take 250 rounds to kill a supermutant. Instead of concentrating on why people need tse explosive weapons for some guns (like a minigun because it's so weak) they just see "people complaining about TSE weapons okay lads we will nerf it and then call it a day" and then they nerf the demolition expert calling it "mandatory" because tse weapon users use it.
---
The point of the perk is for grenade launchers and missile launchers which are already the most under powered weapons in the game. And just so that they can nerf the two shot explosive weapons a bit more they decide to bring the vanilla explosive weapons down with it.
---
Given the context of the past few months I think what they did was right. If you have the weapons it's a nerf, If you don't have them you would never know the difference anyways. The game is addicting, but it isn't that **hard** or extremely challenging in most regards. 
---
&gt; Dev Note: These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy. We do recognize the desire to be able to own more of the cool items that we have in the game, and we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size. We will be sure to talk more about this when they are ready.
---
Well until they are ready we are stuck at the 2600(ish) lbs weight.
---
Eh I‚Äôm fine with that. They need to fix laser weapons to make them usable but the amount I‚Äôve been playing the game has gone down hill greatly since I finally got lucky and got a full set of unyielding gear and bloodied explosive submachine gun. It might be just me but Once I complete the main quests in games I get the most enjoyment out of the process of slowly acquiring better and better gear and once I have said gear I don‚Äôt play for much longer using the gear ironically. 
---
I‚Äôm still hoping for them to fix all the duping exploits because I think they are intentionally waiting on releasing level 55 and 60 gear and 4* legendaries for when it‚Äôs fixed. 
---
You guys got to roll back the white knight nerf next patch. Come on, B!
---
Where can you view game time on PC?
---
I use melee aswell combined with guns.  But fallout isnt a true fallout game when guns will be useless. 
---
Sweet damn, I thought I was the only one getting that vats flicker bug.
---
Yeah, it would be nice if we could decouple perk cards to accommodate changes to our build. I'm having to make the same judgement calls on most of my stats since my play style has changed. I guess we could purchase the same cards over again so we have multiples at different levels, but it seems kind of like a waste. Then again, since I'm not gaining any additional stat points, there's not much else to do with the additional levels.
---
Was there really any reason for demo expert to give more damage than the other weapon damage perks? Besides, it's still better in that you get that +60% from other weapons since it costs 4 less points. I agree about the AGL though, it should've been fixed by now.
---
Thanks buddy less effect on us really high level. But i could imagine lads in the 50s to 90s who would have to redo alot to get out from the nerfed ones. Normally games would offer a way out when heavy changes like these hit.
---
Thanks as always your pal Jokers. :)

As a grenade and missile launcher build... Rip all of my damage
---
I think your math is correct.  60% of 20% is 12%.  So Explosive + Perk = 32% additional damage.  
---
oh no, however will you survive?
---
Agreed. It wasn't even really the damage the explosive weapons did (Although it did need a bit of a nerf. +200% damage was excessive, to say the least), it was shotguns and how the effect behaves. The explosive effect detonated on impact, so even though the actual shotgun pellets did almost no damage, some chucklehead could snipe you across the map with a shotgun, way outside of VATS range, and through concealment like bushes and grass. It made stealthboys useless too. Just aim at the slight blur and click. All they had to do was put a hard cap on shotgun pellet travel distance, and BAM: balanced. Shotgunners would need to use close quarters or rush you to be effective, just like in most shooting games. 
---
I have what would be a frankly ridiculous explosive laser rifle that breaks in under 2 clips. Beam splitter!
---
Yeah this happened to me as well. It‚Äôs shit
---
‚ÄúDuper‚Äôs ruined my game‚Äù... ‚Äúso is this duper‚Äôs or game error‚Äù? 
---
Please staaahp 
---
These nerfs seem like there is no thought in them at all. Disappointing. 
---
I‚Äôm honestly going to miss it, two shot was what let some weapons that are garbage compete in situations they normally couldn‚Äôt. It was the single best ammo conservation mod in the game, and it made shotguns absolute beast.
---
At least the price will drop for tse weapons nkwni guess, not really a fan of explosive tbh it did the same thing as two shot but better, at the cost of killing yourself. It never should have done it hat much extra damage to bases though 
---
are they dressed differently? i can never find them!
---
And they barely were before hand!
---
"Daaaaamn, girl! You got some fries with that shake?"
---
Pshhhh...435 hrs in online game is nothing. Come back when you have 1000+, even that is probably low for Online RPG. Checked my ESO gametime today, it was on 457 hours something and I have still 400 CP to go, still haven't maxed my gear. I am so far, that by the time I am finished with it, there is new gear out and new expansion to complete.
---
There's one. The rest like to play hide and seek. Or rather, hide and hide.
---
Yeah, I'm holding out on the flooring until there are walls that will not stand out so badly when paired with clean flooring.
---
Thanks!!
---
Shotgun was hellafun and felt plenty damaging without VATS from level 1-100 for me. Pop some psycho and light em up. Since you are shotgunning already you should have enough strength to melee as a secondary.
---
Honestly, I forget.I'll check when I log back in. It's insane though. I just stand there with people unloading on me and my health barely moves.
---
I'll check in on this one, I'm not sure. This just made me realize I've noticed that on my own game as well!
---
Not sure why you would get down voted :/
---
Just to add, anyone that role plays a trader or whatever should realise they are doing it within the games rule set. Not just go around collecting every damn item then saying it sucks i cant have more space...you do not need to be able to sell everything all the time, you may want to be the wall mart of the wasteland but that was never Bethesda's intention. Bunch of trump wanna be's tbh.
---
I got 5 characters very similar to you, only thing I would really like is a little bit of shared stash / account storage. Maybe 100-200 shared weight to be able to move things around more conveniently.
---
Bethesda are doing what they can to remove dupers it seem, don't make them deal with hoarders as well!
---
The Nerf to demolition expert is bad. Explosive weaponry requires, generally, a much larger resource investment than any other and so should either have a much higher base damage it be boosted with perks like this.
---
Marsupial makes this game playable.  I hated having to find a way around a small ledge.  
---
Well done! You're now a crazy cat person.
---
you can try but you will  still move.
---
If they plan on sticking with no legendaries for power armor pieces, legendary regular armor will always be stronger outside of nuke zones. 
---
Doesn't even need to e complimentary!  Let us pay Atoms for it, ffs! 
---
Wouldn't trust her.
---
You'll also end up with a bunch of freeloaders.  I'd rather stick to my friends that can level themselves then have to deal with the kiddos asking to be leveled.
---
 I was surprised to see this as it was hard to get a missile launcher to be worth using as it is.  I could get it to do decent damage only with a Bloodied missilie launcher, nerd rage, and demo expert stacking.  Guess I freed up 5 points in int I guess =/
---
Wow thank you for this detailed answer!
---
You say that like I wasn't already...
---
Yes. I'm not saying they would do that. But if it was a possibility for everyone then it's not really unfair at least.
---
Not going to happen, but since this is a game of wishes, hopes and dreams why not aye?
---
It will get nerfed also if all the TSE players move to that build
---
&gt;  removing the sound and the movement of idle turrets so that there's less things for the server to load
---
That would probably be client side. The weighty budget comes from it having to *track* (lol) and kill mobs/players. The only turret of mine that seems to work is the missile one. Which came in handy when 4 lvl 68 super mutants that were potshotting at my CAMP, but they were extremely close to it.
---
Yeah my only day off this week, yay update... also renders me useless lol
---
They probably would have had less problem with TSE existing if dupers didn't make them more available than intended. (Which getting a TSE drop and then having it apply to a useful weapon, would be incredibly rare, just like any weapon that was in any way good).
---
Overpowered is an arbitrary state not a mathematical constant so please define OP if you want to pose it as such.
---
&gt; Stability: The Fallout 76 game client and servers have received additional stability improvements. 
---
You guys better mean it this time.
---
Typical chicken shit commie maneuver.  
---
Hang on, so my TSE handmade with all the rifle perks, demo expert and bloodied mess does around 600 damage, yet a bloodied explosive handmade with necessary perks and mutations does 1400 damage. But TSE is the one that's OP?
---
At least they ARE planning on retroactive credit
---
What about the Instability being caused by the Targeting HUD on Power Armor??    
---
I've got it posted in multiple places and multiple people have tagged the community managers regarding it.  
---
"**\[Bug Fix\] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.**"
---
[BethNet Post](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/317030/bug-fix-pretty-sure-i-just-figured-out-the-cause-of-the-powerarmor-targeting-hud-ctd-s-and-the-fix?language%5B%5D=en)   
---
[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/).    
---
Well I already use melee because I'm sick and tired of having to craft bullets that will just go down by half as soon as a fight starts (at least for my .44 and .10 bullets, shotgun shell are more ok... though the fucking thing keeps exploding in my hands)
---
Unfortunately I contacted Bethesda support and they literally sent me copy paste fixes that I already explained to them that I tried so I'm still without a base I'm assuming.  I haven't been on the game honestly much since then because of it and the fact that I've done everything and collected basically every good tier gun.  Maybe when the game gets a new expansion or something I'll hop back on but start a new character as I don't think this problem is going to be fixed for the foreseeable future.
---
They are being looked at. Currently there is a plan for them to be addressed in a future patch.
---
Here‚Äôs where to go for server status :)
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
Good to know! Thank you.
---
What exploit did I say i used? 
---
Same here. I was feeling this way before the last patch TBH. To many good games about to come out for me to stick with this game. 
---
To many crashes.  And now doing the queen will be so much harder. 
---
&gt; Allow us to turn in Mr. Fuzzy's in exchange for Mr. Fuzzy Tokens, 3 tokens a day is an extremely slow rate (we shouldn't need to server hop to earn them faster)
---
Omg, that would be awesome! I have just completely ignored this as I knew it would be too annoying to farm, but if I could just collect and save Mr fuzzy instead, that would be awesome! 
---
...or, ya know ..rad sponge, ghoulish, radaway, radshield, ead x...
---
Right? I had 2 x01 cali shocks and an x01 jetpack that just disappeared...disheartening usnt s dtrong enough word
---
Okay slow down there, Satan üòÇ
---
Agreed.  The folks ‚Äúbalancing ‚Äú clearly aren‚Äôt playing the game themselves.  
---
Perhaps we should try out the changes before we just assume our characters are useless?  Go shoot some things first before you just assume TSE is dead. :)
---
Word. If I know Im going to a nuke zone, especially SBQ, I try to drop all my junk so I dont lose it.
---
haha agreed but thats the problem with everything now isn't it? If only people put as much thought into thier own life as they put into how someone else lives theirs :))
---
Dead like the end game. 
---
Exactly; if a TSE weapon with demo perk was adding like +500% damage, and the next best thing (anti-armor and ROF increase) added something like +50% damage overall, what was the point of having anything but TSE as long as you could get your hands on one? That's what made dupers so much money. 
---
My fear is that the only aspect of the SBQ fight that offset having multiple low level players buffing her health was high level players rocking TSE weapons to compensate. I fear SBQ will be next to impossible to kill within the time limit, now. That's an issue with the SBQ mechanic, though, not so much an issue with the end game weaponry. 
---
Yeah. Give them to a friend you trust on your original character and then log off and into the new one and join friends game. Then they can give them to you and you can throw them in your stash. 
---
I‚Äôve never died to melee with my assassin sentinel build. Blocker fucks You over completely
---
Thats your problem that you hoard items bro. I got 400 LBS of items combined and i use rifles, you just hoard too much items without thinking.
---
Go alone.   The more players in the silo the greater the resistance forces.  
---
I see.
---
Then find a game where balance doesnt matter. I would recommend Fallout 4. It is essentially the same and you can God Mode Mod it to your heart‚Äôs desire
---
First part was a play on Emperor's New Groove in support of sledges. The second line was an original thought in support of sledges. I just really love sledges in this game. I've never played melee in Fo4, and it is so darn refreshing to run into danger and literally smash everyone with a bigass hammer. Sledges/super sledges are the way to go, and I support your post.
---
yeah we will, we could kill the queen just fine before all the duped TSE's shoe horned people into a couple of specific builds
---
Yeah, since the first 10 minutes of beta lol
---
completely agree. now its extra pointless to be a true explosives build. 
---
That's equality. Fuck everybody. Fuck me.
---
This is a change from earlier patches, their list of fixes is growing and the major problems are getting addressed.  If you're that impatient I don't understand why you're even here and still playing the game?  I've seen some online games take 2-3 years before addressing some fundamental issues so yeah, this is actually impressive to me.  Sure its not perfect, and anything can always be better, but praise is due.
---
I'm cynical by nature and seldom give praise, especially for games.
---
I‚Äôm sorry this has always baffled me, but why do you (or other people) need 600lbs of scrapped junk? What do you build regularly that you need that much raw material? 
---
The straight explosive weapons sucked patch or not. Hopefully the individual weapon types will be buffed.
---
Sneaking, try being cloaked and kneeling. Works all the time for me never had a problem.
---
Bobble heads are nerfed and only 1 chem at a time works.
---
Explosive weapons are garbage and nerfed.
---
You can destroy an entire camp for ~ 1000 cap bounty for a mid sized camp. Meanwhile they can repair for basically free. I‚Äôd take the camp loss over 1000 caps and this is from a guy at max caps.
---
You don‚Äôt get a bounty for repeatedly attacking a wanted player unless they‚Äôre no longer wanted.
---
You can be killed in PACIFIST mode, big difference. It‚Äôs like saying why can other people eat meat if I‚Äôm a vegan? Pacifist means YOU do no damage.
---
Same, so glad I'm not alone in that.
---
Kinda annoying patch to be honest from the explosive, two shot nerf. Because of explosive guns being op lets nerf missle launchers, and fatman too who was barely used because of the lackluster damage. Way too many nerfs in general and close to 90 days without new content, starting to loose interest and patience.
---
Cannot stand juicehead. Shitty clickbait videos.
---
Update: It should be a one time temporary message message per player who joins. So you shouldn't get spammed by it.
---
Sucks to be you I guess. 
---
 The question now becomes did they put the tag at the End of the Plan Name or at the beginning.....
---
I got a explosive lmg last night and now it's a paper weight. Know the pain 
---
Yeah, like AC did with Black Flag.
---
don't hold your breath ;)
---
As a player with a camp at Whitesprings i know the feeling... 
---
Apparently nerfing the lowest DPS build in the game, including after TSE nerfs, is intelligent.
---
There are a handful of interns left and they haven't logged in once.
---
does blocker stop you from staggering? because that's the biggest issue.
---
What if I told you lots of players actually want wooden armor?
---
She should drop 3 star pieces though.
---
I know this was mainly in jest but I‚Äôm actually looking for level 45 unyielding wood armor (have 3/5 atm) for a stealth build hah .. 
---
I do agree tho to put only high quality stuff on the queen or any raid boss
---
Gamma/radium is the new pvp meta.
---
Even with maxed Demo the Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher are not that strong of weapons. They're incredibly dangerous for solo play which should give it a high risk/reward play-style, but it doesn't. Watching Super Mutants take like grenades like a champ, then fall to my buddies super sledge instantly is just idiotic. 
---
This is already heading in the direction of so many other failing/bad MMOs - Nerf everything to the ground, buff nothing.
---
&gt; The only way to obtain it if you scrapped it was to fight to Queen...
---
... or trade with another player.
---
Thank you, right after I commented I checked back on Bethesda support. Wasn‚Äôt there when I looked this morning. Thanks for the link and not a cunty attitude ur the real mvp
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this list is getting smaller which is a good sign!
---
Hopefully the game will be worth playing again in 76 more days. 
---
I invite you all to join the unofficial welcoming committee. Whenever I see a new player near Vault 76, I quick travel there and drop them some sort of plan or recipe I don't need, flash a thumbs up, then head on my way. Spread the &lt;3.
---
The Dev's are aware it's a wanted feature by players. 
---
This is nothing out of the ordinary. If you know the game's resource system well and farm efficiently, that's pretty much exactly what your stock of raw materials *should* look like. Also note that these are all raw components, so it's likely the person whose stuff you took had just scrapped their junk. Would also explain why none of it is bulked, they were probably looking for a tinker's workbench to bulk it all up.
---
Very likely not a duper, just someone who really knows how to farm well. Like I said, if you're gonna run the risk of duping, you don't dupe just a few hundred of something; you dupe *tens of thousands* of materials.
---
If this had been single player with colorful companions and the like... man
---
Beth, you are clueless. I read these notes, see multiple nerfs to TSE, white knight, explosives in general, basically all the fun in the game. So sure, let's say I accept these nerfs, so I read the rest of the patch notes for the new fun stuff. 
---
Nothing. Nothing new to do, nothing to offset the balance fixes. BTW, balance does not mean only reduce one side. And you release this blind mess two days after Anthem's demo. 
---
You are clueless. 
---
This... it was a needed balance. The perk card reduction makes me curious to how they apply now (rework of perks may be in order) but I am cool with the changes. Instead of shooting once you have to shoot 3 or 4 times with the same weapon...who cares? 
---
My only fear is that eventually everything will feel like bullet sponges eventually. I did like not having to shoot 50 rounds into something to kill it. Maybe a balance need to be made so the tankier enemies die faster but deal more damage? I'd be cool if higher level enemies could kill me in 5 or 6 hits if I could kill them in the same amount without TSE or AAE. 
---
Wait till the end of the beta...Ohh wait.
---
I'd be surprised if it wasn't intended. Legendary enemies acted that way in FO4
---
Nerfing the two-shot damange so drastically makes no sense. Is the extra bullet smaller, slower, lighter, or something?! It's the explosive damage that was making these weapons so overpowered.
---
The main reason for a rebalance would be the accuracy penalty. Now that the damage buff is constant-but-minor, keeping it in line with other effects, there is no longer a justification for the accuracy penalty.
---
I actually don't use TSE because it makes an easy game even easier. I just dislike how unbalanced the Perk cards are as a whole.
---
Agreed. Especially with the nerfs to two of the most powerful affixes, I won't be the only one changing things up a bit tonight.
---
I think you mean a 1.25 shot gatling gun now lol
---
Nah, it was a joke. But anything powerful enough to make other play styles unviable by a more than a designed margin is OP. Since there are clearly several paths to progress in the game, all should lead to equally powerful, but different builds. Any one ahead of the curve would be OP. The aim would  e for all of them to be P.
---
I made my first melee toon in FO4 after watching some dudes Macho man randy savage play through!
---
Grognak's pants (cant remy the name) and bare knuckles all the way, running round suplexing mobs in vats shouting ooooh yeeeah mach man randy savage style is just sooo satisfying!
---
I have noticed this also, but I thought maybe a lower level had been around. 
---
They could dupe nuka colas anyway 
---
Idk, seems like the least they can do since they have been making grinding unbearable.
---
Ok so let's revisit:

&gt;Just play the game and ay what is fun.

(unless I don't agree with it).

I don't troll or Grief, but I can cause some serious chaos now... and not many will be able to do anything about it. "I won't!.. but I could."
---
Totally agree!

# FIX AUTO-GRENADE LAUNCHER WEIGHT PERK!!!!!
---
I'd argue it's all about complicity and consent---engaging players in PvP who have opted out of PvP, or baiting such players into unwanted PvP, is wrong; it's a basic violation of individual agency. Said another way, don't treat others as the agentless and unwilling means to your own selfish ends, chiefly your pleasure. 
---
Please fix the cooking pot glitch that lets you get in walls. Please don't fix the power armor glitch that lets you get to higher places without marsupial or jetpack
---
So basically if you are playing a two shot, an explosive or any combo involving either, they no longer deal anywhere NEAR the damage they used to? My explosive gun and spec is nerfed twice? No tweaking, no sidegrades, just, sorry you liked explosive damage and got lucky?!
---
Wow what a disingenuous post! You really enjoy the game in its current state, that's great, power to you. Many of us are disappointed with the state of the game, we know bethesda can do better(they've proven this with past games) but here you are telling us to take out complaints and leave.
---
Wow that's cruel. Let me be the first to apologize for not being you. You see I want to be having as much fun as you're having, I know it's possible because bethesda makes good games, but I just can't right now because Fallout 76 isn't there yet. But you're here telling me to give up, that if I don't accept the game in it's present state that I need to leave? 
---
No thanks, I'm not going to give up on my fun that easily. I'm not going to let you tell me how I have fun.
---
Well that was a needlessly rude way to make a point.
---
Is this actually viable to remove and get them back? I really want Speed demon for the reload speed( my main is a tse dragon) but dont wanna lose bird bones and marsu
---
R.I.P. the whole fucking game, this is the worst update they‚Äôve done so far. They‚Äôve ruined so many aspects. And then just made some really bad choices.
---
‚ÄúHi we nerfed the explosive bobble head so it doesn‚Äôt stack anymore....all those other bobbleheads though? Yeah they still stack...that‚Äôs fine right? Like who the fuck thought nerfing one bobble head but not the rest was a smart idea?
---
So the plans from vendors thing, will i finally be able to get the plans i want without server hopping?
---
You fucking boomers ruined every aspect of video games in current years. And you're fucking microtransaction spending habits since all life teaches you now is how to press the big "buy" button on a phone.
---
When is it supposed to be finished?
---
Thanks buddy still would be nice to avoid hunter/hunted messages if you never intend to join in it. But atleast it won't be too much of an annoyance seeing those names on screen when someone joins it and then at the end.
---
I block all doors or entrances in those workshops to keep creatures and people out hehehe. No way am I losing all my hard earned structures I buil without a tough fight. :D sorry but no this shouldn‚Äôt be fixed. Barricades in front of doors etc are pretty immersive if you think about it üòÇüòÇ
---
True, which finding another player who was willing to give up their armor is another hurtle for the player to jump a cross. Especially seeing as you gained the armor itself and not the plans to make it. So either way someone would miss a Ultracite. 
---
Well, thank you for explaining the situation to me so clearly. Actually, you know what? I bet the grind will be much more fun with your words in mind. Say hello to the rest of the Beth team for us, too. Hell, who said gaming has to be fun anyway!?
---
Haha that is quite an image.
---
Vet's of MMO's dating back to Ultima Online use "Mules" for legit hording reasons...  
---
Bethesda attacked the issue in the wrong way, IMHO, and all of us insane players with multiple accounts for storing all sorts of goodies are now completely borked.  
---
And before the high horses are gotten on, our right, our choice, and many of us are responsible for all those goodies left for new players, free things given out as we find even leveled players who are new to the community, and this will prevent this almost completely.
---
I did patrol duty at the penitentiary ~10 times and got the plan. Faster than server hopping for the plans IMO
---
Seriously. Between the cost and the rarity of certain items, I have difficulty using them primarily in this game, even though it's my favorite Fallout build (stealth bomber).
---
They will just drop it then in a bag and come back after logging out and back in 
---
or 10 levels to switch out a level 5 card!
---
You know, I tired for the longest time to make him wear it. Only realizing I was doing it wrong. Good times lol.
---
Make them go into debt account wide. So when they get caps all their debt is given to people who killed them.
---
It won't be hard to use in the new PvP mode. You could just sit there in chameleon armour in a busy and shoot everyone that walks past you since there's gona be no slap damage. 
---
What do you think I‚Äôve been doing?   
---
And Miniguns? Way less durable than Gatling guns. 
---
Sorry, but armor and weapon repair isn‚Äôt my idea of fun.   Nor is hunting for components to perform said repair.   Nor the associated weight/ inventory management. 
---
The game would eat what you built, of course! Lol
---
&gt; The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced, to match the Power Patcher perk.
---
 - **Dev Note:** In looking at the Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.
---
Well boys, looks like ~~meat~~ **ballistic fiber** is back on the menu.
---
Wow. TONS of great fixes and changes in this patch! Can't wait to load up later today. 
---
Yea but everyone rolling around with 1600-2000 listed damage Two shot explosive Handmades are freaking out man, they can't just one shot the game anymore. Might have to employ tactics and thought.
---
Meh. White knight nerf night make me wuit the game. Having to scrounge 3 hours for ballistic fiber because my armor breaks every hour was infuriating before I found that perk.
---
Ign Shawnpaul, not sure what time I will be on. Watching the kid this morning.
---
AFAIK, Demolition Expert also affected the explosive legendary modifier on guns, and that‚Äôs why that perk was also nerfed. Someone please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.
---
&gt;I really want to make a heavy weapons character who alternates between ballistic and explosives weapons 
---
This is my build. I am no longer playing this game until they address the issues with explosive, heavy weapons and ammo. 
---
There's already a mechanic in place for this. The perk card that lets you build advanced traps lets you keep the traps when you're done building them. So when you remove OP's suggested card...nothing.
---
/u/Ladydevann First off, thanks for always being on top of your game with your job. :D
---
Secondly, I was wondering why the Surface to Air event has yet to be fixed? It has a pretty event breaking bug with it. Unless you're in a group (and have enough resources), this bug will make the event near impossible.
---
Anyhoot, the bug is, the enemy scorched spawn INSIDE the turret that you're supposed to defend. This means that they cannot die unless they come OUT of the turret (most do); and it also means that they consistently keep destroying the turret over and over, and over while inside.
---
So, if the dev team could move their spawn point, that'd be great. :D

---
It's not supposed to be 100%. And I think it does give you the component, it just doesn't list it with the rest of the regular components you always get from a certain part.  I could be wrong though, I'm sure someone has researched it.
---
Get reactive plates and blocker wouldn't that negate a strong melee especially if they are a low health bloodied build ?
---
Grinding gave you a sense of longevity now it‚Äôs just giving it to you reducing the longevity  which will make people give up faster since they have what they want.
---
I'm not arguing with you or implying that you need to chase the meta.
---
I'm simply pointing out that Fallout 76 is and always will be pay2win as long as they refuse to separate PvP from PvE.
---
I personally think that they should eliminate either player trading or eliminate legendary effects in PvP. The two can not coexist in my opinion.
---
I stopped playing this game over a month ago, bought it upon launch and enjoyed it at first. Got to about level 20, and i feel like my whole game objective is searching for aluminum to repair my decent weapons, and exhausting my common weapons and ammo during the search. I mine aluminum ore, but even this gets very tedious at a certain point. Have there been any fixes for this? If repairing has been improved i would be open to playing again. I tried so hard to enjoy the game and justify my purchase, but it just feels like a chore to even load it up now. 
---
Months from now? Lol, this game. Smh
---
Then all the stuff above your budget come into your inventory XD
---
The alternative is to not comment at all, which isn't great. I would much rather be in here and form a relationship with this community, than ignore the cool things you guys do. As for the repeated "Thanks for the feedback" posts there's a lot of really awesome feedback in this sub and there's only so many different ways to say that you're relaying that feedback to the Dev's and acknowledging that you see it. I can tell the Dev's all day about things I see on social, forums, and reddit but that means nothing to the players if they don't *know* that I saw it.
---
 I understand it can be frustrating to see us comment that and have to wait for patches to see these things implemented. We do have communication with the Dev's all day, every day and part of our job is to not only tell them what we see but to let the community know they are heard.
---
I know this, that's why I use them, but they give very little radiation resistance and now they no longer stack thanks to bethesda. So they are 100% useless in nuke zones
---
I got one at level 35 solo so idk what to tell you
---
RIDICULOUS white knight here, I'm very sorry but at this point, Bethesda CLEARLY doesn't give a fuck about us or that game. I'm gone for long now and just heard they canceled the end of January content update and moved it to end of March? This is the biggest joke considering it was planned for mid January. I just wanna laugh so hard when I see how they hooked up people with promises and keep making unrelevant and non consistent patches and updates hahahaha and you guys... Keep pushing and giving your approval for this, this is how they get more and more ballsy to screw us up in the daylight. 
---
So your armor will break a little faster, and your solution is to not wear armor at all? It doesn't sound like you've really thought this through.
---
A simple fix is make it so xp is only shared within a radius of the teammate who killed the creature. That way Lazy Ass across the map isn't siphoning xp for free. 
---
THIS. omg this! instead of making my baby (hardened combat shotgun that has explosive damage and decreases enemies damage and was my first legendary i found that was worth a damn) useless.
---
Still no fix for the double loading screens.   This has got to be addressed, you are spawning our characters into the game to be attacked / killed while we are still seeing a 2nd or 3rd loading screen!
---
NURF EVERYTHING WHOOO! New game content? How a out a pvp mode no one wants instead of quests, raids, or ncps!
---
But to be fair..shouldn't everything in life lead to ghost face killa
---
AA isn't as good as it sounds again most enemies, I'll probably go for furious or instigating. 
---
replied to wrong person somehow, deleting comment
---
If that was the case, then one projectile missing a target would still deal double damage. It would not. Two shot is literally two shots. It's not just a graphical thing
---
What's this?   
---
A new teen Rickrolling meme using some really bad Public Enemy tribute band?
---
....whats that have to do with what I'm talking about? 
---
Agree. I usually pop 6 Diluted Rad-X before entering when they expire I'm done in a couple of minutes. X01 is worth \~ 1 additional Rad-X of protection. I don't see how this is going to work. 
---
It's a strange one as they are changing the way Rad-X works to the way it has worked in Fallout 3, NV and 4 so it suggests it was not working properly in 76. They could up the resistance on it slightly though due to the bigger role rads play in 76.
---
Or how about we have the ability to make perk loadouts so we dont have to always change cards, quick swap would be dope. 
---
That's literally the only two decent builds left after this intern patch. Maybe shotguns too, and that's only due to some bug.
---
And buy/craft 3x more ammo and repair the weapon 3x more often.
---
Your suggestions about the Mutant's affix is pretty insane. You can have 18 Mutations in total (there are 19 in total, but Carnivore or Herbivore can't both be caught) and the downsides can easily be offset by Class Freak \[3\].  
---
\- For armor, that would be 45 BR/ER PER piece, which results in 225 BE/ER for a total set at a CONSTANT rate. This is even better than Bolstering or Vanguard's without it being actually conditional at all. That effect would always be active and it would easily become BIS.  
---
\- For weapons, it's the same story. A 72% damage modifier is pretty damn good. It would be about 3 to 4 times better than what Explosive or Two Shot have now become.
---
&gt;**Rad-X:** Consuming multiple Rad-X or Diluted Rad-X no longer causes their effects to stack.
---
Ruh-roh!
---
I can get behind that for sure.
---
I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre fixing all the problems but I wish they‚Äôd just give us a little more that they‚Äôve promised in past ‚ÄòInside the Vaults‚Äô. 
---
Player vending would be nice or even a small increase to stash. It would be nice to be able to keep some of the things we find instead of always playing a No Man‚Äôs Sky level of Storage Management Simulation.  
---
Sounds like you're cucking. They should at the very least offer the perk at a much lower level, and also if they are going to nerf the perk they should allow you to respec the three points.  I just got to the level to use the perk, now it's debuffed. It is frustrating.
---
On xbox it‚Äôs on the challenges menu. There‚Äôs a challenge to get to 7600 hours, and you‚Äôll see where you‚Äôre at
---
I know you guys have been getting a lot of crap lately, just wanted to say I'm glad to see more of the community's issues being addressed with every patch. I've been enjoying the game since day one and I'm sure I'll continue to do so for a long time to come.
---
Not gonna lie, I am so stealing this idea
---
Expl shotgun will still likely be OP during to pellets doing extra explosive dmg. Will have to test.
---
I like this!
---
&gt;what is M79 supposed to be, I figured it counted as an explosive rifle
---
It used to be classified as a shotgun as it has terrible hip accuracy. However, a few patches ago, the weapon classification for both the M79 and the auto grenade launcher were removed because reasons. 
---
&gt; You have some crazy MFerz in QA ...but they can't think of everything.
---
Former QA guy here, can confirm how true this is! It's why a real beta would have helped the game. What a bad decision it was to skip that.
---
I'll have to test after the patch, but my TSE .50 Cal with Prime Receiver with Demolition Expert slotted and Psychotats active was absolutely melting the queen when she landed.  The TSE Gatling is fun to use but doesn't even come close to the TSE .50.  When she's in the air, and for regular enemies on the ground, I have a AA Gatling Gun with 25% faster fire rate (non-prime - prime would help but I haven't gotten that drop yet).  That, combined with Martial Artist, puts out crazy, sustained DPS.  
---
Also, a LMG is not really worth using for anything, IMO.  It could be decent if you didn't have to reload it so often and/or you could actually mod it.
---
Here's my dedicated heavy guns build.  Tweak as needed.  Swap out One Gun Army for Class Freak if you run anything more than Marsupial.  If I had more 90% reduced weight heavies, I'd probably take Bear Arms off and put more points into the Heavy Gunner perks.

Anti armor difference is killing an enemy in 5 bullets and killing something in 30 bullets. It's already near impossible to run a auto rifle build due to ammo consumption. Being higher than I can craft it. 
---
Even with Weaponsmith, the weapons still break too fast for how mediocre their damage is.  Add on top of that the ammo costs rare shit like springs and screws instead of just steel and lead.  They suck at everything but killing players.
---
Well.. that settles it.
---
This game was not made for me.
---
See ya.
---
Theres what less tham 1 million users online now world wide? If history in these types of games serves thats typically present with games in its death throes. New content is needed more than a online game mode I don't recall people asking for.
---
That was obviously comedic. 
---
Lol @ braindead style 
---
Wait that's a bug? I just thought those things were supposed to break after a few cores, so I've been repairing to 200% with Weapon Artisan. 
---
I'll check in on this one, I don't have an immediate answer for you.
---
Tbh I think the hit to DE was just to hit double hit the explosive gun perk since now instead of 2S everyone will be using bloodied/AA explosive but now nades, mines and all explosive weapons will also do less damage which wasn't needed
---
I fully agree to the Nerfs on 2SE but think they either should have just made the explosive gun perk not tied to DE or nerfed the gun perk more and left DE alone
---
The DE nerf seems a bit excessive but will have to actually see how it plays in game
---
You seem frantic and aren't clear on what you're saying. I'll give you a bit to sort yourself out.
---
And don‚Äôt forget, now you have to get those levels without a viable build. You‚Äôll still come across enemies catered to your level and where you *should* be, but you won‚Äôt have a build to support your weapons.
---
And it took a long time, didn't just happen overnight either.  Change takes time, but you can recognize and observe behavior indicating the change.   Change can be internal or external too, not everything needs an overhaul in personnel.
---
Thanks for the support guys, you're really helping the community and yourselves with the fast updates and inquiries.  How about a volume control for in game voice chat?  There isn't one in the audio options menu that I've seen just yet and i don't see why we have to turn down the game volume outside of the client (i legit have to turn down the audio via Windows settings) to enjoy said party members (or players that don't realize they haven't enabled push to talk and are eating pretzels) at a reasonable decibel level.
---
Does wood armor give an advantage to stealth/sniper builds? Or more generalized, what's the relation between armor and stealth? I've asked around but haven't gotten a definite answer. 
---
huh...so that's what was with that Power Armor set randomly standing in the woods... kinda wish i had got in it instead of just looting it. (was already in a set of PA.)
---
I hope so ....
---
stacking rad-x... basically the same as stacking bobble heads.
---
It's impressive that they are so engaged. 
---
I guess so.  Could be worse lol
---
They are.....white knighting lol.
---
What does this mean? You cant put a shit ton of items into a suitcase or garbage can anymore?
---
Ain't he a cutie? :)
---
That would require them to care about us as gamers playing their game. 
---
I think the ammo machines should works as converters, not vendors

Feels like they used a belt sander to balance. High points come off to drag the ass-end up.
---
Id rather have Dogmeat, or Dick Shale
---
Ah a fellow monkaS
---
Have an upvote
---
Personally I think because if you have it fully upgraded and mostly just wear armor such as myself, I haven't had to repair my armor in weeks and weeks. When I got a new piece, I upgrade it to the 200% and never have to look at it again. I enjoy not having to repair my armor but I can see why they want to change it.
---
All indications in previous representative posts are that any new content is months away, around the time of the survival mode beta.
---
Whoop, scratch that. They are aware and working on that one!
---
I want both...really clean stuff and really ratty, raider stuff! lol. I'd like a nice new suit, but at the same time a nice Children of the Atom hairdo. A perfectly preserved pool table, and a glowing, mutated, radstag head mounted next to it. 
---
If I could wear regular armor over hazmat, and have it just replace my magic long johns, I'd be sooooo happy.
---
&gt; I know I will be the only person but is the nerf to pipe weapons really needed
---
I must have missed what you're saying as I don't see any mention of pipe weapons in the notes above.
---
Oh noes the pain!
---
It was very clear what I said in that comment. 
---
this should be more visible to everyone
---
Fallout 76 Weapon Shop:
---
"We have everything you could want!  Gatling guns, miniguns-- heck, miniguns that shoot lasers or plasma!  We have assault rifles, .50 caliber sniper rifles, plasma cannons, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a catapult that launches small nuclear bombs!"
---
\&gt; "I just want the thing that does the most damage."
---
"Oh, okay.  Here's a sledgehammer."
---
It's really pretty stupid.
---
What is he called please?
---
I gotcha. It would be fun if I could have a Scrooge McDuck style cap bin CAMP. 
---
Still no mention of fixing the quest Recruitment Blues. I can't continue on the Brotherhood storyline because that quest simply wont trigger for me. Looking online I see that many other people have the same problem, and the only consistent fix is restarting the game entirely. Which I'm not prepared to do.
---
Or maybe all we really want is another skyrim.
---
&gt; So either way someone would miss a Ultracite. 
---
Well no as mentioned the plans drop from the SBQ. Getting a set crafted isn't an insurmountable hurdle.
---
This is probably the least of the quest reward item issues, but probably was the easiest to "fix". Getting less than max level legendary quest rewards or losing actually unreplaceable items seems more impactful.
---
LOL- that would be June or July next year. They are wasting time working on PvP mode 
---
Players launch nukes, Bethesda counters with nerfing everything 
---
I just want to be able to get in my PA without having to take off my power fist and then be stuck with only one weapon while in PA
---
I wasn't arguing your intent. I was saying the joke wasn't obvious. I still don't understand the crux of your complaint. Armor will break a little faster now if you have the perk. What's the big deal?
---
It's really not that big of a deal
---
And tbh there is plenty of armor that reduces item weight plus adds strangth ect
---
And if you find yourself needing to use multiple cards to reduce weight maybe try getting rid of some shit 
---
You can either carry everything all the time forever or carry what you need and deal lots more damage but hard to do both with just perk cards
---
(Guy from SAW voice) "Make your choice"
---
No shit. How are you so bad at this Bethesda? How do you miss the obvious so many times?
---
It already took 5 grenades to kill anything my level. Now to spec out of Demo I have to earn 5 more levels to move 5 points, and 5 more levels to get new perks. That‚Äôs not even counting the perks that support demo expert. 
---
Fucking hell. I‚Äôm done with this shit game. 
---
No lollygagging
---
Why are item swaps and trades a thing of the past?
---
People DO NOT need to be able to trade 1 of everything on the server all at the same time.
---
I am aware of the overencumbrance effects. Still no reason to allow 1,500 over limit.
---
Any update from them on this? Thanks
---
r/fo76bazaar is where I got some of my calibrated shocks
---
Yeah, I guess I totally missed that behavior somehow.
---
The game is the laughing stock of the internet.
---
Seriously, it seems the community is 70/30 split between ‚ÄúExplosive nerfs fucked the game‚Äù vs ‚ÄúNow other build might be more viable now.‚Äù
---
I am absolutely frustrated. When weapons like Bunker Buster weighs40 lbs, but does nominal damage, something is wrong. Missiles &amp; Mini Nukes are stupid heavy. My TS Fatman was decent, but because I had to equip so many perks to offset the ammo &amp; heavy weapon weights, I could never equip the perks to realize it‚Äôs full dmg potential... and as of now, that hope is lost with this patch.
---
Now everyone will be running melee... again.
---
Bethesda, why did you keep creating a fork in the road, and then forcing all traffic down to one lane?  All weapons need to be balanced. I agree that making the perk cards line up with one another makes sense.  Why couldnt you have just reduced the dmg when both TS &amp; E were combined?
---
Literally all of of my TS or E weapons are pretty much garbage now, after Ive spent countless hours grinding to get‚Äî thanks for that.
---
Please base decisions on feedback from communities like this, rather than the vocal minority of sensationalized YouTubers.
---
Unfortunately luck is one of tightest stats when it comes to being filled with good perks.
---
Just have them owe 'the bank' whatever the bounty is so when they get caps they have to pay it back. No more offloading caps to mule accounts to negate the consequences of PvP. They WILL eventually have to pay. 
---
We definitely have let the Dev's know that players are thirsting for PvE content. We do have a lot of really great PvE things planned for you guys that is in development, and we're working on a roadmap to show you so you can be aware of when those content beats are.
---
I should read something twice, where you used a word wrong? It's not esoteric man, I get what you're saying. It's just wrong.
---
If I "don't know what I am saying", than there are many others who don't as well. Many are complaining about this debuff with the same requests for at least a respec.
---
If on xbox I'll give you the vent if you give him the wood. If not on xbox, then I didn't say nothin.
---
How would you become wanted?
---
Agree. I take tons of hits in my PA and \_never\_ have to repair it while my non-PA frequently needs repair. If Rad-X won't stack, I don't see how one can stay in a nuke zone without gulping Rad Away or wearing a Hazmat Suit. Is the plan to make it harder to stay in nuke zones. 
---
We dont know much about survival. So far it sounds like its just standard mode with a few rule changes, which means wanted is still present. But I dont know for sure.
---
Also there have been many complaints and suggestions. So I have no idea what they change for the beta.
---
I did but I cant make them and cant find ammo
---
Don't balance your game that's mostly pve with pve logic, the only op armor was dense and assassin's sentinels. Adjust those affixes.
---
Agree
---
Everyone is "wanted" in new survival mode. 
---
You only get 5 mules...wait...per account...which is unlimited. Never mind.
---
Yup, it's straight up adapt and overcome.
---

I didn‚Äôt get the trophy for reaching level 100.  
---
It's the only trophy I need for the platinum trophy :/
---
You know, I haven't spent enough time just sitting and taking in the scenery in this game. 
---
Weird, I wonder what that boss we've killed 1-2 times a night every night was, then. Huh.
---
The game should have been like this day 1 don‚Äôt thank a company for dm ally stepping up and doing the job they should have done 
---
If everyone is already PVP by default, what do you think you'll be able to do to make yourself 'wanted'?
---
Yes / No...  
---
They attacked it in the wrong way, TSE's should have never existing in the first place, but there were allot of better ways to deal with the problem at hand, because TS was not the problem, it was Explosive being a Secondary effect which was OP.
---
Diablo 3 lets you up the difficulty on the campaign and play through it. Or you can run rifts which also have variable difficulty. Or you can test your skills and run greater rifts. Or you can farm for legendary/set items to complete builds opening up different ways to play, as well as allowing you to challenge higher difficulty content.
---
The Division lets you run the story missions at high difficulties. There are "super story missions" called incursions that are significantly more difficult and test the players skills and gear composition. There's "Resistance mode" that's something of a wave defense mode with increasing difficulty. There's The Underground which is a series of instanced randomized maps. The Dark Zone opens up PvP allowing for PvPvE content where you can work with or against other agents while completing PvE events, or purely pvp it's all up to you. Survival mode is a game unto itself and basically a battle royale take on the game.
---
What these 2 games have and FO76 lacks is repeatable content with variable difficulty, content that drives player interaction - be it cooperation through Rift, Incursions and Dark Zone or PvP such as Survival mode and Dark Zone, and clear gear progression.
---
Agreed.... clean underwear under my wasteland  chic attire ...  We should be able to have both
---
Gonna log in tomorrow to see if I'm still bugged. Fingers crossed that I don't disconnect when zoning in and out of buildings or fast travelling. I can't wait to play this game again
---
Looooool this game blows no one cares 
---
well radshield will actually be useful now
---
Same here. I will probably wait till getting it until we can place such stairs more freely on floors.
---
Destroying CAMPs 
---
Even if it's using my character on multiple platforms.  It's doable as the data resides on the servers
---
The same ways you do in main game. The fucking point of survival mode is no pvp rules, no pacifist. It would be understandable if it was there to prevent total warmongers.
---
Well, you have Farcry and Metro coming out in 2.5 weeks. Hope you can fix some more issues and release some actual content by then. All you're doing now is forcing people to deal with nerfs and respec. I have one double shot black powder pistol I've had for most of my game, that I held onto until I could use it. I got a DS Gatling Plasma and SMG I found in the last 2 days. I'd started to take perks to use them, but now there's no real point, unless I want to wear PA all the time. I've been tryin to skim down my carry and stash weights even further, so I can farm and run non PA armor most of the time, but my 3 level White Knight is crap now. You're losing people with every wait and patch, and now new games are on the verge of release. I'm about ready to shelve 76, the way I did ESO, which is a far better game, BTW. 
---
And that's the same excuse bobble head stackers used... 
---
no one is walking around with 1500, they would move super slow.  this is just targeting mules.
---
Farming this is the worst thing ever.  It‚Äôs bad enough you can‚Äôt control when an event happens but the drop rate is sickening. 
---
Ladydevann you the best! 
---
You'd think xbox PC cross play would be easy to do. They are both owned by Microsoft. 
---
I dont know the specifics. You would have to google it yourself. But as far as I know whenever the topic of cross play came up, Sony didnt want to do it.
---
man the number is not balance probably they have to insert more balance one . But the idea that this effect work better more mutation you have is very good in my opinion 
---
Person in the image knows they've got a school bag on instead of a parachute right?
---
dude i am so ready to make my camp into a mothman shrine
---
I wonder man. Cant wait either way
---
Same issue, and I horded items to give out to new players (level 1 - 80) who needed them, that whole operation is now completely Fubar'ed...  
---
They tried resolving the Duping issue in the wrong way.
---
Lol this made me laugh, and I'm the op. 
---
You nailed it
---
I mean yes... that's *exactly* what you should do right now.
---
Of course it's stupid and Bethesda should really re-work the bounty system; both in terms of preventing "accidental" bounties and providing alternative ways to remove the bounty beyond simply being killed by another player.
---
But in terms of it being 'nearly impossible' to get rid of a bounty? Nope; the method is pretty clear. Just the other day I had a player jump over to my base and ask me to take him out to clear his bounty.  As a game mechanic it's stupid AF but there it is...
---
Yeah but your wayyyy more open to being attacked with a melee build.  It‚Äôs pretty much a tank build...and explosive weapons are still going to be strong and end game efficient.
---
I think you're making a mountain out of a mole hill. The game is braindead easy with or without TSE or explosives.
---
   Here I've never had a TSE and never ever ever ever had issues killing anything. Heck my alt is level 38, 15 luck, a mix of 4s and 5s across other stats, uses a lv30 all rise, has finished main quest(also I'm a solo player), and can 2 shot power attack lv62 charred ghouls. 
---
Nothing more frustrating than getting shot from a missile launcher by an enemy and take tons of damage and then shooting back with a missile launcher and taking a tiny sliver of health (with a crit shot) from them.
---
The sentence was clear the first time around. You misunderstood it. :)
---
If many are hysterical then many are being hysterical. You have the option to respec by gaining levels. 3 points is minimal and now you have the opportunity to use other perks.
---
More drab power armor paint..
---
I wish I had a prize or something to give you‚Ä¶ sorry
---
I will find out for you!
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand. I agree there should be barricades and it is immersive. Barricades offer a secondary defense but are also vulnerable to destruction if someone else decides they want to try and steal your workshop. What I‚Äôm talking about though is a glitch that allows players to barricade doorways with an indestructible container. That‚Äôs not very immersive. 
---
Mothman. Hell yeah
---
Dont forget the suitcases at Watoga! 
---
Grenades suck because of environmental occlusion and boosting the damage of them doesn't do much to help that. The perk that increases explosives area is by far the best one for making the most of explosives and they haven't touched that one so I'm hoping the damage nerf won't effect things nearly as much as people think it will.
---
Whilst I agree that this seems really high, it occurs to me that many things weigh too much. 16lb handmade? My PA AK47 clone with a full clip comes in \~8 lbs. Unless a really thorough audit of weights (some mods add a ludicrous amt) was done I think perhaps restricting it further may paint the devs into a corner. 
---
Attacking player bases and lockpicking producers like in main game. They havent explained it, so isnt it something to ask?
---
It should scale with your level. When you‚Äôre let‚Äôs say 20 or under. Should be 1000. 20-50 should be 2500. Then 50+ 5000.
---
Recipes and plans are no longer randomized and can reliably be bought from those vendors. Does this mean I can log in and find x-01 calibrated shocks Everytime I log into a server? Or will there still be a less than 1 percent chance for it to pop up?
---
They can't even sell for a decent price as they won't make caps until they drop the weight. üòÇ
---
It is in the same line as the change to white knight. You used to have pipe weapons that had a 90% reduction in durability lose when used. On the scale of effective weapons they drop off considerably at higher levels, people pick up handmade's or the assualt rifle because the damage is better.
---
Perks: The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced, to match the Power Patcher perk.
---
Where it at?
---
But they could easily port it to the soulja boy console and sell it for full price.
---
Whoa, Site Alpha's code starts with my Phone's area code, Neat
---
Seems to be going just fine for Fortnite
---
Nah it weighs too much
---
I'm fine if you need PA in the time zones, but I'd rather not have to use it when just wandering around. 
---
Maybe I'll stop blowing myself up now.
---
Really appreciate their attentiveness and willingness to hear feedback and continue to make changes. There were definitely some poor steps early on, from a marketing standpoint as well as gameplay, but things are definitely improving and I am hoping Bethesda continues to learn and set a positive example going forward for AAA companies and what their fans and supporters want/need these days. The current issues with Anthem by EA is a good example of how others are learning positively about being open and communicative and transparent, which I think bethesda has set a good example of doing of late. 
---
FINALLY I can throw away my notebook on my desk!   
---
 **Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no  longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors,  with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans. 
---
The special increase bobbles do not stack.
---
&gt;Scrapping a stored blueprint that contained wires will now correctly remove those wires from the C.A.M.P. budget.
---
Is this retroactive?
---
Haven't heard the title "Beaters" since SAO season one lol
---
 It wasn't the apocalypse, he was an explosives main.
---
Its not the cost of a respec - its the convenience and a balance issue - a free respec absolves you of all past sins and mistakes in your build creation.  Its just too much of a free pass IMO.
---
It‚Äôs going to be great. We‚Äôll either see hundreds of paper bags full of shit at the overseers camp, or they‚Äôll be selling it all for dirt cheap. üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh wow, spot on! This just made me laugh and cry at the same time! :-(
---
You are consenting to PVP when you log in, its a PVPVE game.
---
They nerf everything good it seems because everyone uses them, but we do that because everything else is extremely weak in PvE. So what should we use now?
---
Why do people leave spoiled meat lying around at IKEA on Black Friday?
---
&gt; Now everyone will be running melee... again.
---
TS weapons already receive a massive accuracy penalty to offset the extra damage.  I have to stand directly in front of an enemy to hit it due to how inaccurate my TS shotgun is.  Since they nerfed it's damage, I might as well just switch to melee.
---
Okay, I can get behind this. In #2 no one would be OP as well. It is a lot more work, but if it's a more pleasing way to the same result, why not?
---
Yeah, Sony finally caved a while back.  Fortnite got cross platform after Bethesda said there wouldn't be cross platform in 76.  They later said it is something they would think about in the future.
---
I have hope
---
I guess people like it easy every comment that try‚Äôs to say it might be a bad thing gets downvoted watch everyone will give up by next patch because they will want guarantied legendaries that they can choose the perks for lol  
---
Or perhaps make the Science! perk match the Gunsmith perk. or vice versa.
---
Well that's too late servers seemed deserted today. I hopped a lot today and got on the same server 3x. This never happened a few weeks ago. But thanks for the 23 down votes ppl...
---
In the same Boat, this penalizes any Vet MMO player, who purchased multiple accounts.   
---
Hell have of the reason I played every day, and did trades was to have a stock of items to give to new players / those in need when I met them.   
---
This will prevent me from equipping a new person in 1\* low tier legendary gear to prevent those UI bug scrap accidents, or to do free upgrades to those in need, because I won't be able to store extra comps in large enough numbers to make it possible.
---
Tbh i prefer to have new content.  Also i hope killing a supermutant warlord wont take 20 shots. This game was released in november and still no new content. What i am supposed to do now? Become a troll.. I mean raider? 
---
Yeah, a single scorchbeast fight should not be sending me back to base.
---
The biggest thing is the trade economy imo. If I read correctly it won't allow people that overweight to acquire caps. Therefore they cannot trade at all. Cant gain new inventory from trading nor caps. Praise this day I can enjoy running a shop again and getting unique items!! I'm also excited to see the difference on the TSEs. I've been forced into keeping them to be competitive.
---
That's a flat out lie.   Literally this thread has comments by community managers that prove that's a flat out lie.  What the hell is wrong with you people.
---
A genuine complaint from several players from the community =/= hysteria
---
I do agree with this
---
Being it down to 1000! 
---
yeah spot on. and glad we all agree knowing what plans we have is a big help now that we have most of them already
---
Yes this please.  You are creating unnecessary grinds for those who have been hit with a nerf.  Now I have to grind levels to readjust.  I don't mind, I'll readjust and even save levels for any changes.
---
Also stash size should be increased.   I have been saving at least another set of armor and different legendaries in anticipation of future changes.  It would be nice to have more space to make switching less of a pain.
---
As this is a live service I get things need to be balanced but having to aquire certain legendaries and cards is more trouble than it's worth. 
---
Ooh that‚Äôs a good question. I see people celebrating that they can get mods they‚Äôve been trying for, but that may not be the case. I would hope they are included because it‚Äôs the same root problem that plans had. 
---
I'm very disappointed that we still need patch after patch of bugfixes and QoL improvements for a game that should have been whole when it was released. I'm very disappointed that these same patches keep nerfing anything resembling decent gear or perks. I'm very disappointed in the state of this game as a whole. These patches shouldn't be necessary.
---
They are still very strict but they have done it for rocket league and one more game. They might do it. They might not. 
---
I hadn't thought about that. You know what? I'm gonna completely rebuild my character for the sole purpose of destroying the cargo bots. Why have a 3 star lever action in your inventory just incase? It does no damage at all to those fuckers.
---
Greed
---
 lol aahhhahhhah
---
From unlimited to 1500 lb over your max. carry weight is pretty substantial change in its own. People who wanted to play as intended may have hard time adapting to this limit. Imo, after this, they should reduce the max. carry weight to 1,000 regardless of your current max, but increase Cap limit and Stash size. I'd imagine it would be a more stable and reliable way to increase Stash limit if they apply more nerfs to carry capacity first.
---
Most of the time, the loot I get from the Queen is ... off. Like, one to two bits of junk (not bad gear, literal junk, like screws or a bowling pin) and maybe a stimpack. A couple of times I got some parts (brain, lung, etc) and some normal gear (chest piece, leg), and once I got a plan (Pipe Gun prime) ... is she \*supposed\* to give good loot? I thought she was just the final boss celebration.  
---
Mind you, I've only fought her when other people have called her up; I can't do the nuke quest myself. I'm built for crafting and exploring, not fighting, and the level of stuff you have to fight for that is \*way\* out of my abilities. 
---
Yeah, this is a a little more reasonable instead of the original numbers you proposed.
---
&gt;Foundations: Fixed an issue that could cause a ‚ÄúCannot place item: Needs support‚Äù message to display when editing a partially floating foundation
---
I guess this doesnt address the fact that you cant place pressure plates or decontamination arches on the upper floors, only foundations or dirt? (probably missing a few others)
---
Also, the wall cabinet stash box is broken. It snaps halfway into the floor.
---
I could go on about all the things that are broken with camp objects.
---
I have a question bout taming wild beasts, so if you have a beast on your CAMP, will be hostile towards other players or just enemies in general?
---
I'm fine with the 2se nerf not fine with demolition nerf
---
But I run mostly bloodied and got 22 lv waiting to use if need be I think I'll be alright
---
They fixed a whole lot of bugs in this last patch, and if you‚Äôre coming to Fallout 76 looking for the god-mode single player experience, you‚Äôre in the wrong spot. Fallout 4 has plenty of mods and such still coming out for it if you‚Äôre looking for s good single player game, but fallout 76 is an online game, and therefore Bethesda is gonna approach and fix it like it‚Äôs an online game
---
Mine went down to 21 mybe because i was low level at the time ? 
---
Plus the globes gamma guns shoot have very generous hit boxes. And the automatic type doesn‚Äôt lose any damage or rad damage!
---
Jesus so many fixes. Thank you!
---
‚ÄúOn your left‚Äù
---
it's not about needing as much as wanting.
---
Why not? It's easy. Serums are dirt cheap and if the numbers you listed were actually in the game, people wouldn't mind buying 18 serums for such huge benefits.
---
Better to use with class freak.  Update today is a huge benefit to melee builds.
---
they should have done this after adding a Rad resist underarmor that was Armor Friendly...
---
Yeah looking closer at some things, I should probably revise my grade to an "A-". Still good but some choices look a bit poorer on review.
---
Stims, lots of food and water, LOTS of ammo if you guys use guns, make sure all of your weapons are fully repaired before going in, all junk is put away in your stashes, and enough carry weight left over to carry out any loot you might pick up while down there. Also, one of you should share rad sponge once you reach the reactor. That's about all I got advise wise!
---
Wow someone busted out the Nerf bat.  Still waiting on stash increase before I'll come back to Fallout 76.  
---
Ok, lets meet somewhere in the middle and do 2.2k , all i need is the rare bits like screws and springs, possibly aluminium. See if you can find my post in the trading subs and  do a comment on there so i can give you karma after :D
---
Agree, only should have been done after fixing the lack of Rad Proof Armor Friendly underarmor
---
Can you not fucking read? PLANNED FOR A FUTURE UPDATE. 
---
Only if you reliably use actual explosive weapons like fatmans/missle launchers like me. Probably best to just use a rank 1 card though and use other alternatives like Tenderizer to buff allies damage.
---
Does blocker remove the staggering effect? Any perks that remove it?
---
The game's not even up yet and people are bitching and moaning.
---
What a fuckin' time to be alive
---
We don't have to own a TSE to have a good time. We have you!
---
TSE made it too easy, in PvP and PvE. I went to a queen battle and it died within 1 minute of it beginning. All other enemies in the game can be 1 shot by TSE weapons, and that isn't crazy fun either. What's the point of being a God in a sandbox? You're going to get bored squashing everything. That's why I went Bloodied and don't wear armor when messing around. It's more challenging. But some people can't take a challenge.
---
Nice first post 
---
I think you should reread what I wrote. I'm just restating the same thing pretty much with the above comment.
---
I mean people were absolutely abusing the heck out of it in PvP situations so I do not feel sorry for you.
---
you can also see the available mods on the post :)
---
Agreed. This seems like an over correct for TSE. I'd love it if the demo stayed at 60% if the other 40 was a base increase (or pair demo expert with armor igbore). As it is, explosives are now going to be very very lackluster.  We have less working weapon options. 
---
Yikes. Shame they didn't toss those weapons a bone and up their damage by 10% or something. It's not like any of these weapons are very good right now.
---
I only get such high armor/PA degradation if I don't equip White Knight or Power Patcher.
---
Solid points.
---
What you dont want a 15th copy of explosive vents anymore?
---
You're forgetting that they aren't mistakes in build creation. The build was working until Bethesda changed the parameters of the game.
---
Problem was also Explosive being a secondary effect Legendary at all, it should have stayed primary, because even in it's nerfed state it's much more powerful than any other secondary Legendary effect
---
Favoriting something should prevent it from being scrapped. or there should be a popup failsafe
---
The perk isn't unusable. Nerf =/= trashed. You're overreacting. 
---
Hello, Here For All Of This!  I'm scarberrymallette!
---
"Role Play"
---
Also, circuits. Lots of circuits. They don't have to be on you, just at least in your stash. And steel and I think screws and/or springs?
---
"Our feedback indicates that Mini Nukes should be no more powerful than a pipe pistol.  We're rolling out an update next week that brings down the damage of all weapons to 100 max.  Also, we are doubling the duration of the Scorchbeast sonic scream and adding fire damage to it." -- Future FO76 patch notes
---
Except it's not going to store weapons as an item and a number. Each one of those fatmans is listed separately, because they can each have different mods, different level, different max and current condition levels.
---
Yeah, but now as a non-PA user, BOTH are going to be required.
---
Indeed XD
---
Nah, the person collecting on the bounty would only get your 10 caps. 
---
grenadier doesn't work with exploding weapons. only grenades. at least it seems that way for me. no difference in the explosive aoe with it on or off. 
---
And armor? Please tell me you'll fix armor 
---
This happens in ESO (or used to back when I played).  I 100% agree.
---
ROFL... Greatest headline ever. Thank you. 
---
It's poopy patch FORSURE. No new content, UI stuff that should have been out on release, and a WHOLE LOT OF NERFS.
---
Bunch of innocent civilians got their builds destroyed because their play-style incorporated a perk essential for them to be REMOTELY relevant. TBH their DPS was still minuscule in comparison to the meta TSE.  Now they are even worse which is terrible. 
---
Oh if wanted RP a trader and have all kinds of stuff to trade. Guess your not allowed to do that now...
---
Cherry on top of all this is NO NEW CONTENT... Lol Thanks for post so I could rant &lt;3
---
Yeah I am into the building and my workshops and vault in fallout 4 were fuckin works of art. I built every one out fully and each one was unique and looked like they belonged in world. I loved each and every one lol i know I am a geek.
---
I am playing as a scaver/trader in 76 and have an open trading outpost camp next to Watoga station and its cool but it is very generic. 
---
I can definitely let them know this is something you'd like to see.
---
Recently did a scrub down, and re-spec of my mutations, previously had Twisted Muscles as it was the 1st mutation I received, but opted to leave it off this time for my Stealth/Sniper Character.
---
There has been a small (Barely noticeable) increase in accuracy, but a significant (very noticeable) decrease in Melee Damage, fortunately I only use melee for low level enemies, and my Instigating Assaultron Blade still OHKs anything below level 40.
---
lol- that new guy was actually a duper alt who can't walk since he has 147 tons of shit in his inventory.
---
I posted this in the Bug thread like 2 or 3 weeks ago. I'm on PC with a duel monitor setup. When I am swinging my mouse across the screen my desktop screen will steal my mouse (even when the game is in fullscreen)
---
Again, you say this like there is some kind of detriment to allowing players to do this full respec.  The respec is actually already in the game it just takes a really long time in normal play after level 50.  So it is not a non-included mechanic, or even some crazy uber-rare item that lets you do it.  We all get to do it, it's just time-gated.  Letting people do a fast one-and-done to make up for the changes in this patch has no detriment at all.  At all.  The only thing it seems to do is ruffle your feathers b/c you have an opinion on how other people *should* be playing/enjoying the game.  
---
"No, people don't deserve this nicety, they should just forever regret their mistakes." -NoctD
---
That is what you get when you say something is OP to bethesda...
---
This should have been in today's patch.  I mean they added ultracite plans to the terminal at the end of belly of the beast, because people accidentally scrap the power armor.
---
Maybe rather than the plans they should have added a favorite no scrap feature.  Also a lot of people scrapped that PA because of it is labeled power armor chassis and nothing else.  When is the ability to name sets coming in?  I thought this patch would have it.  
---
Yeah, just a simple animal companion would be fine for me
---
or for the [Power Armor HUD CTD](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/) Issue either.
---
Not necessarily. It's PVPVE, but that doesn't mean that you have to play it as such. I have never engaged in PvP and I think I never will as PvP will always be unbalanced in the game I feel. There is really no incentive and it's moreso an inconvenience than anything. (The lore is also that all players are from the same vault so we should all in lore know eachother. I don't see the point in fighting). That is why I am glad that survival is coming out mainly so that people who enjoy it can get what they want as well as I can continue in my PvE adventure without worry.
---
If you are on xbox you get prizes for the awesome dad joke used on a Dad!
---
Many people do this, but the Mule characters will limited to 1500 lbs now.  
---
My explosive shotgun did 656 damage with **15 perk points** dedicated to shotgun and explosive damage.. not exactly game breaking considering how many perk points I'm using, but now I will have to spend a lot of time regaining the points to change things. Which wont happen because I'm pretty much done with this game.
---
Thanks for the downvote :) 
---
Guess I should've came in here bitching about the same 3 problems everyone else does!
---
and not force ranking to the highest perk card. 
---
ie, I want Gunsmith 5, Gubsmith 4, and Gunsmith 3. currently cannot have this combo as i‚Äôm forced to rank up 4 when i really want to apply it to 2.
---

---
 &gt; I can definitely let them know this is something you'd like to see.
---
yeah they need to revert this nerf and nerf explosive weapons even further to 10-15% if thats why this nerf is occuring. explosive weapons like fatman/missle launchers didnt need this. 
---
Sweet meme, very clever, funny post. 
---
Pretty sure Bethesda does give some fucks, I mean releasing multiple large scale patches filled with fixes brought up by the community seems like care to me. Sure the content has been pushed back but really not all that far, and IMO a stable game with progress on the horizon is better than an unstable game hyped up on inaccessible content packed with bugs
---
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to laugh along with you because you're being sarcastic or wonder how you think another thing being nerfed is good. If it's the latter, just wait. Eventually you're favorite gun/armor will be next eventually.
---
I never said the way to balance PVP was buffing weapons. It would, however, make a lot of weapons more interesting and fun in PVE.
---
The twofold problem with PVP is the rewards aren't good/satisfying, and that weapons outbalance player armor severely. Player armor vs players should have a natural multiplier was my thought at the time. 
---
I've been thinking in the mean time though. A straight damage build is an order of magnitude more powerful than a general purpose build. Doesn't make PVP fun for anyone that isn't min-maxed for damage. I'm not sure PVP damage can be normalized to a degree that makes PVP dynamic and exciting across the player base. I also don't think every player should be forced into a pure damage build in an rpg as deep and diverse as fallout. I have a moderately even distribution of stats, and I really like the way it works in a pve setting. 
---
I don't think the PVP will ever be that great at this point. I'll think about it more though lol.
---
As for overpowered weapons, yeah, they're OP VS players. But against SBQ you're gonna have a really rough time without them.
---
Thanks.  My character built for explosives really needs to move points and farm new cards. It's gonna take another 50 levels to swap to rifle.
---
Holy crap, I want like half of these items.
---
No, because Bethesda employees are the problem. They are trying to downplay the negative shit that the corporation has done, and up play the mundane garbage that they are trying to convince us is ‚Äúgood‚Äù.... 
---
They are garbage. Bethesda should have shut down 76 on week 3 and finished completing the game... instead they hired a troll farm to flood social media with ‚Äúpositive‚Äù posts and to Down vote negative comments into oblivion... oh and they continue to focus on atomic shop garbage despite the entire community saying to give that shit up....
---
But hey, if I don‚Äôt get a reply along the lines of ‚ÄúBethesda software is good! Blah blah blah‚Äù... we‚Äôll then I‚Äôll eat a bug!
---
I use them in conjunction with Radshield in PA.  Seems to be pretty effective even without the stacking.  It is a real pain to get those blooms to make radshield though.
---
That is an epic shot. Talk about " rubbernecking". lol
---
Please, correct me if I am wrong , Two-Shot will stay Two-Shot (bad aim) but with just 25% more damage?
---
Combat Knife Skin please!
---
It would be so cool!
---
It just means my Bloodied / Cavalier melee build will be able to kill you with much less risk
---
i love how any time carry weight comes up, this sub floods with "well I only use *this much* carry weight, so everyone else should."
---
hands down the most idiotic statement/sentiment that constantly comes up.
---
I'll get online tonight and check which building/floor. Brother in full armor on the floor, Brother out of armor on the stretcher/gurney.
---
Waaah.
---
Man,  if the game is that bad to you, go find a game you like so we can stop having to lisen to all the whiny posts. 
---
Seriously. 
---
Or maybe he was sitting there and thinking about all the duping he had done so far and that all this duping never really gave him true happiness in his life and that it was time for a fresh new start.
---
I can tell you're not a game developer, or you'd know having the same %-age on every perk card is way more important than having real ingame balance.  
---
Look at all those 10%-20%-30%, they look so great now.
---
Same boat I thought it was named sentinel and because people were selling it at 25k a piece i hasn‚Äôt seen it dropped yet. I live in PA but thanks for the PSA hahaha
---
I've never had either equipped, fought a number of SB's, and never seen armor damage like this.
---
I've played a considerable amount of time.  I'll probably log in today, see how badly my main character's build has been nerfed, then log off and play something else.  
---
I'm patiently waiting for new content, but am glad they are fixing stuff and balancing right now.  I just wish I could pay 500 atoms to respec my character.
---
Im thinking 32-48 would be really nice. Then 100 player pvp servers! :D 
---
It might be worthwhile for me to mention I managed to kill a player last night while I myself had pacifist enabled. When you become wanted and a teammate kills you, there is a chance, as was my case, that the teammate will show as hostile the entire time. Neither of us could fast travel because the game considered us both enemies. And even though my pacifist was on I was able to kill my teammate whereas I was previously unable. Not the worst glitch ever but the last thing players need is doubt in the pacifist shield
---
You are correct. Thank you. My apologies. 
---
Haven't seen that. I'll have to look for it.
---
Dont worry, there will probably be a big content DLC drop that they will want you to pay an additional $30 for soon.
---
I am waiting for the servers to come up right now.
---
We are back to whoever has the most stimpacks wins.  2SE needed a nerf but the explosive weapons did not.
---
*"Hey little mama lemme whisper in your ear"*
---
Lol. 
---
If they nerfed the explosive dmg from the goddamn Sonic Blasts, well, you may have just found one tiny dot of light in the darkness that is this last patch.
---
I took that impression from the subreddits own description " It's like fo76, but for people who are tired of the whining. "
---
I wont go into that subreddit. Because if people really need a place like that, im happy to give it to them.
---
Its the snowflakes ,that demand every place to be like that, that i dont care about.
---
I got calibrated shocks after like 100 queen runs, and its the ONLY mod Ive seen or gotten from her aside from knuckles and vents. I did a double take when I got them because I thought for sure I was seeing things!
---
Haven't lost to a melee  yet in Sentinel Assassins either (as poster above said).  You can still jump in place and keep the effect.  Also you can still move, run away your probably not making melee damage as your running away.  If your attacking in the process the battle is over in seconds anyway.
---
Is there any cap to number of characters per account?
---
Fingers crossed your right. I‚Äôm a heavy weapons and launcher build so if the effect is removed then literally my whole build will have gotten annihilated with this patch. If not, then at least I still have these guns. 
---
I disagree. It's a step in the right direction, it's a good change, but it doesn't solve the problem.
---
Dupers will now just create more mules to distribute the items between. Instead of having everything on a single mule they'll have a gun mule an armor mule etc.
---
Your original OP was absolutely overreacting and unnecessary whining. It's not even a huge nerf. Ya fuckin crybaby. 
---
Dear sir or sirette. With 26min gone when you said you don't have an answer, and 25min when you did have an answer, I can now imagine you sitting on your desk in the middle of all the devs desks and you just read questions aloud here and type whatever the answer you get. Am I correct on your positioning? :D
---
The winner can be whoever designs a Excavator Power Armor skin because being captain banana is really tiresome 
---
Well you‚Äôve obviously not done the event or know about the end game exp values. It has nothing to do with being bad, they were already horribly low.the REWARD xp was lowered form 350&gt; 100 for completing the event. Killing one lvl 62 charred feral goul gives you double the exp, just go to whitesprings than even bother with the event. For xp farming that‚Äôs the logic. 
---
I have an image saved of a Scorched doing this too. Funniest moment in the game for me so far.
---
Toxic.  Toxic af.  
---
I think they care.  Developers often come up with solutions that look good on paper, but they don't have to live with them.
---
One other thing I haven't seen adressed it that you can become immune to scorchbeasts (normal and queen) sonic attacks.
---
I don't know if it's high energy resistance or the perk for fire resistance or both, but once I had that and around 500 energy res I stopped taking damage from that stuff.
---
This is without a power armor or any drugs or anything conditional.
---
I also have a bunch of free time to play, if you're on ps4, let's play?
---
I suppose they should take out the monsters too?  You want to play free from worry, the zombies in minecraft were too much, so you picked up a copy of 76 and want them to create a special version for you.
---
I FEEL SO ATTACKED RIGHT NOW I CANT EVEN
---
Gotta work regardless of schools being closed.  So... nope.
---
At least all the buses are off the road, making the morning and afternoon commutes easier.
---
My first SB i had a quest to activate the turret, although the turret helped I was not prepared for the wave of ghouls. People joined in and we all survived but I was level 30-ish.  No in my 50's i tend to nly fight hem near turrets or assist others cause you never know if you're going to run into a second.
---
Its taking a while,  maybe they 'accidently' erased all players data
---
You do 0 damage if you hit the actual cargo box fyi. Learn't that the hard way shooting one for 5 minutes.... 
---
Did you maybe get hit by the brotherhood gun as you were fighting scorched?
---
I'm a little sad about Demo Expert being nerfed to be honest, that was my ace in the hole!
---
Why are you still playing then?
---
Hmm interesting! Thanks for that.
---
Assassin's Sentinel 
---
2 nuke zones only, they nerfed whitesprings till infinity while you cannot nuke anything else and get legit gaming experience out of it, releasing PvP end of March in beta mode, I call freaking bullshit. JUST Nope. The game is fun and has decent content until u reach late game.
---
People are farming weapons on the Queen to... Kill the queen eventually more efficiently cuz anyway it's the only thing to deal with lategame.. Nonsense 
---
" It's a strange new world out there,Bob. Just keep your gun at yur side and your eyes to the future and the world will turn,buddy". 
---
Never. Sony is the problem, not Bethesda. 
---
No it just makes it so they can do less at a time, 1500+ is still way too much.  
---
It is a huge missed opportunity. I will admit at first I wanted my single player Fallout experience but now that I've done that I want tons of interaction to keep the game fresh.
---
Sentinel. If you get yourself a full set, you're pretty much unkillable. You could survive a full barrage of 2shot exploding and take little to no health loss. Now that they nerfed those weapons, but kept the armor stats, anyone who has a set will be pretty much God mode. Pre patch, I never took damage AT ALL from non exploding weapons. I assume that will be the same after this patch.
---
It‚Äôs not that great. Best armor in the game. But you‚Äôre not invincible 
---
At low level, I kept it as my main till about 30. I could one shot most stuff. It was very op.
---
Bethesda, can you please finally fix unability to get protective civil underarmor lining? Thank you very much.
---
Any anti armor heavy weapon with stabilized melts the queen. 
---
Or if not defenses, then at least durability, you can run around in power armor for weeks without repairing, but regular armor you can only run around in for hours.
---
Heck, u probably can have all my weapons.
---
The attacked it in the wrong way, the issue was never TwoShot, it was Explosive as a secondary effect, should have never been available.  
---
Even post nerf it's the most powerful secondary legendary effect possible.
---
Are you sayin increases in intelligence nets you more experience? I have 15 base int so I‚Äôve never noticed
---
Hmmm... does that break the rule of "keep it civil"? I guess we will find out.
---
Where are all the sick homemade gas masks, helmets, bandoliers, goggles, leathers... i want street sign armor and   junk armor and atomic-future goes mad-max bdsm realness
---
I literally spent my last bunch of levels on white knight and then demo expert. Well they also nerfed my main rifle to death then, my explosive tesla that took me forever to find. Fuck me in particular, then. Them retroactively nerfing perks has me all kinds of nervous, not to mention i'll probably still disconnect 3/4 times a session and not even be able to see my friends online. 
---
All of this means i've decided to finish up the platinum asap and move on. This was almost a good game but it's just too much of a complete fucking mess. 
---
Yeah every nuke zone is 'did everyone get a tag' whilst being pummeled by a mob.  Not a a fun game mechanic by any means.
---
Yeah that happens, annoyingly. The guy I was responding to said he had a bag that went away.
---
It was also a mandatory perk because rank 3 made it so you almost never had to repair armor. Sure, base rate of armor breakage being too high is a reasonable criticism. Lowering that rate to a tenth with 3 perk points was too good though, 40% of the base rate sounds more reasonable.
---
Their job is just damage control though. Social influencers have zero say on what devs do. 
---
This is why we have more PvP coming instead of good working PvP.
---
But I'll let the devs know your concerns. &lt;3
---
Still have zero reply from bethesda but I still have an error code everytime I go to log in what a great game so glad they condone to whiny people who lose in pvp maybe they shouldn't have made it a pvp game I want my money back but I know I'll never see a dime and have to accept my loss in this terrible excuse they try to call fallout 
---
Yep, a couple times. I thought it was server lag related and not my client because it's so random.
---
So your plan is to nerf builds and tell people to wait an indeterminate time before they can play like they'd want to again? Your dev team is terrible at making adjustments, no wonder it's left to modders normally.
---
A Mothman statue would be amazing, as would a costume, maybe some ritual decor...
---
I just need a way to prove my dedication to the glorious Mothman.
---
Pipe guns regardless of Legendary Affixs needed a buff... They are trash and only used for lower leveling. 
---
It‚Äôs really not like that. I assure you. 
---
Not everyone played previous games with the Wacky Wildlands turned on. This zany Fortnite inspired crazy outfit spree is stupid as fuck. Where is the equal representation for people who want to RP as, you know, fairly straight laced Vault dweller survivalist? 
---
I know this might be a hard sell but could you implement some of the basics like a 16 colour palette for CAMP / armor / power armor into the base game, rather than the Atom Store? This would allow us some measure of personalization.
---
Or dream solution add a tint layer and let us set a tint colour via RGB sliders.
---
EEEEEEEEEEVVVIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLL
---
Is the Cannibal and philanthropist perks interaction still broken?
---
Aw, shucks.
---
PC, too bad!
---
Is the team divided? Or they rather docus on different project then fo76? I believe that game got great potential and many paths to evolve.
---
Want me to play the game for ya too lol 
---
Oh shit, I meant to say mini-nukes.
---
yep. nice.
---
***I do not take any credit for this build***
---
This is the build I'm putting together right now, two hand melee, and I think in the thread/post, the creator shows a max damage of 2400 or so on a super sledge
---
Here's a link: https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/dangerous-solo-full-damage-two-handed-melee-build-one-shot-everything/
---
Fuck wendigos?
---
Ok. Fuck'em.
---
Probably I always have at least 20 bulk steel. And Yes, I have a problem with hoarding.
---
Prepare for the inevitable crashing and rejoining.  
---
It's been months of talking about the problem.
---
OMG mole miners... ugh.
---
Yeah I was 800 over yesterday just from scrapping Flatwoods. New character with almost no strength and no carry weight perks yet. 500 is not enough but I think 1500 is more than enough.
---
Yeah, nobody takes workshops anymore since you can easily grief/pvp those players without them being notified (if you just take it, leave and hunt them on the map). 
---
PvP mode is too far away (releasing in March dev's said). 
---
Lol. I didn't even need to read past the headline to know someone was salty about the incoming TSE nerf.
---
Yes. And a ghoul skin also.
---
Doesn't matter if you dis-agree, Bethesda made a PVPve game.
---
If they wanted us to feel safe in the wasteland there would be area's with no pvp.
---
You should also be blocked from sending team invites when you have a bounty, its being used to grief players intentionally. See [https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/dabnician/video/68328053](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/dabnician/video/68328053)
---
Honestly once your bounty exceeds your caps you should be blocked form fast travel, Why are you going to even bother increasing the bounty they cant pay, these mechanics are open to abuse. 
---
a level 261 player that two lower level players had been teamed with, im 100% sure that he destroyed their camps and is only sending invites until some one stops him. I knew exactly what was going ot happen when he didnt respond over voice chat and sure enough, lucky i just blocked him and logged off and back on, then i moved my camp. 
---
That was a really well-done YouTube video!
---
I'm not. I was hoping they would give me some new reason to keep playing by now but instead they're stuck squashing bug after bug after bug after bug after bug.
---
RIP thx for the info tho
---
Maybe soon tho
---
Place wall.  Place pass-thru on foundation next to wall.  Select Pass thru, move just connector through the wall, should stay green.  
---
It works well for me, other than sometimes it tried to put it on the top of the building.
---
Less sillyness and more badassery please. Blackbird paint is the only thing I've bought after hundreds of hours.
---
Wanna sell one?? 
---
"Plans", they told "Plans". Calibrated Shocks are mods. 
---
Thing is, with this they lowered value of Jail events. Before, even when you had Handmade plans, it was still valuable to do those events, because handmade plans was worth 1500 caps. Now that people can buy them for 500 caps from vendor, they basically removed another event from todo list.
---
With no moving parts and no option for silencers, energy weapons should have ZERO durability loss.
---
Got nerfed with the 1,500 lb max carry weight on characters now lol. 
---
I came here to say this.
---
You may want to run those tests again. I've tested it for hours. 
---
I feel like with the White Knight Nerf, you just have to accept the fact that you either farm resources all day or just live your life as a squishy mfer.
---
This basically broke my entire tank build. Which is Max endurance, strength, and agility, with combat armor, bolstering and vanguard(for always buffed) and the mutations that are appropriate. Then you there in some intelligence for makeshift warrior and you have a decent tank. But this build was really only viable WITH a teammate with Empathy and Strange in numbers. Otherwise total trash, and now I need to respect my whole character. 
---
Dropping White Knight for literally any other perk, I guess. Probably pick up gunslinger and some gunsmithing cards. Thanks Bethesda, now I need to level up like 20 times to fix my build because your repec system and patch fixes are garbage.
---
Not sure, I only have 2 on each of 2 accounts, but know someone that has 7 on one account. I also have 5 separate XBL accounts and could easily create more, MS does not limit how many accounts you can have tied to an IP address that I'm aware of.
---
Imma get that nuka cola bedspread. 
---
Not everyone is a 2 pump chump. Some of us take out time üòé
---
My explosive tesla rifle could do some stuff, it didn't feel overpowered and it took me forever to find but now it's fucking dead. I hate building a character and then the devs gutting it, feels like a total waste actually.
---
* Nuka-Cola Machine or equivalent that makes Ice Cold versions like the last three games had
---
* Furniture that holds and displays items: kitchen shelves for food/drink items, some sort of display for the teddy bears, etc
---
* Pallets of each junk resource so we can store large quantities of them in our CAMPs. All this needs to be really is a static item that costs and scraps the same amount of the resource and a bit of wood.
---
My second request: Bethesda, please give this employee a raise! u/Ladydevann has been busy actively engaging the r/FO76 community; listening to our concerns and replying promptly and respectfully. This is the very definition of excellent customer service that honestly, at least in my experience, is unheard of for a video game. She is an invaluable asset and Bethesda is lucky to have her. Thank you very much! 
---
PS 
---
Shout out to the rest of the team. You all are awesome too :)
---
I know the spot, had no idea you could drink it or that it would cure diseases! Thanks!
---
I'm not agaisnt these nerfs, its just a lot of nerfing focused in a specific area, so toons that specialized in those areas are hit extra hard and without warning. I'm an unfortunate side effect of some needed changes. 
---
I think the chest is still accessible even after you've completed, but I personally have it unfinished. I don't believe it's repeatable though
---
How many millenials does it take to change a lightbulb?
---
Just one, they stand and hold it then the rest of the world revolves around them....
---
Fucking Rad-x stacked in Fallout 4. It wasn‚Äôt a fucking bug.
---
I‚Äôm watching a movie, and I can‚Äôt check the server status. 
---
I am on PC and all of my "Discover X locations in Y" can't be completed. Y is the location IE Mire, Cranberry bog, Forest, etc. and X is the number required to complete. Even those areas are shown as blue on the map, most are missing check marks.
---
I have others, but that one specifically I checked last night  and none of them are marked as completed. 
---
I was kinda holding they‚Äôd removed everyone‚Äôs 2se so people would have to ACTUALLY find it themselves instead of buying duped TSE I‚Äôve found one explosive weapon ever and it‚Äôs my mutants combat shotgun not even TS and I found it in Graham‚Äôs inventory  and bought it
---
I was engaging in civil critizism. Just because i wasnt sugarcoating what i was saying means i spew any toxicity.
---
It was you who started with insulting me not once, not twice but three times in just one comment.
---
I only responded in kind after that, and your snowflake tears dont make me feel sorry for it for one second.
---
Learn to differentiate between criticism and toxicity. Maybe then youll stop yourself being a toxic ragekid throwing a tantrum at people.
---
Actually, I'm thinking the opposite.  With Survival mode, all Adventure mode players should be locked in Pacifist so there is absolutely no PVP except in Survival servers.
---
I understand that, at some point it gives a little bit of reality however its still annoying and makes peoples jump  servers. I feel sometime actually that server jumping is a form of cheating. I didnt get that here so just hop few times and i got it. Hard to say sometimes really is this good or badüòõ
---
Explosive as a secondary effect was always the problem, Two Shot wasn't.,....  
---
And Explosive is still the most powerful secondary effect possible, so it's now Furious/Bloodied/Instigating Explosive meta
---
LOLOLOLOL
---
I‚Äôm currently work in game QA  and have for about 5 years. It is mind boggling how many edge case bugs get reported on forums/Reddit that our department didn‚Äôt catch. 
---
Can also confirm ‚Äúcrazy MFerz‚Äù
---
No, I was assuming you‚Äôd already put plenty of hours into fallout 4, so the vanilla game wouldn‚Äôt entice you anymore. If you‚Äôre looking for fresh, single player content, and you still want it to be fallout, look for some of those mods instead of complaining that an online game doesn‚Äôt suit your single player wants
---
Are you for real? If true this is game changing...
---
LoL, hey, remember, this is the time in human history where people check their phones to see what the weather is... outside their own house... 10 feet away (or through a window).  
---
Yes, that's the way I interpret it.  
---
So.. we all edging till the servers come back up or what?
---
They should make RadShield a lot easier to gather resources for in return for this nerf.
---
-90% durability reduction and only needing 1 of each material to repair armor was over the top, it's annoying but it needed a nerf.
---
Any creature that you can't outrun can eat a big bag of irradiated Dicks.
---
I'd love new underwear and **a chance to respec my fucking character**!!
---
We need a "lock feature". You can only favorite so many things. 
---
../Agree.   
---
The issue was always Explosive as a Secondary Legendary effect, it's still, post nerf, the most powerful secondary legendary possible.
---
I freaking predicted this too and posted something asking Bethesda to be careful about this. But I got attacked and downvoted by a swarm of idiots who didn‚Äôt read carefully and thought I was asking to not nerf TSE, when I clearly indicated this was about **non legendary non TSE weapons.**
---
So part of this is that swarm of idiot‚Äôs fault. This sub is full of them. I think we need to make a habit of downvoting people who do that because they do harm the conversation around here.
---
So what was this guy using?

Pretty much un-killable huh? Wasn't you already? ...

there is always one guy that who's sole job is to post when they do come back up  
---
just refresh "new" every so often
---
Do you have Power Patcher equipped?  
---
Under intelligence? It is a good perk to make PA cheaper to fix and much more durable. 
---
Fuck any creature that you can't outrun
---
You misunderstand...
---
the first line " The point of this post is for people who hate on this game."
---
There is a difference between hate posts and constructive criticism with a positive attitude. 
---
They weren't focused on bulking it all up at all. They were killing ghouls with TSEs at the golf resort. They had been there for a while cause there were several meat piles on the floor .
---
I was the one that bulked it up after I realised I had gained 500 extra carry weight on top of the 221 I already had on me. I dropped quite a bit of it fo4 random people  because I didn't want people to end up stealing all the resources when I died
---
This is what OP is looking for
---
no
---
This is the biggest load of garbage I‚Äôve read in a long time.  The game is a pvp game.  You were either ignorant of the gameplay mechanics or you are trying to force your own selfish interpretation onto others.
---
This - Now my Rad Worms can take a hike!!!
---
Unreal idea. Tagging for sale.   
---
To add, we need a request item WITH A PRICE. I might sell something if someone gives me the right price. 
---
PA sucks for pvp. Sentinel set outperforms it by a long shot. 
---
Nah my junks fine got everything i need for repairs and replacements, with a little extra and about 150 stash weight to spare. 
---
Managed to get my inventory's weight down to 125 / 350 (ish) always got the option of the free carry weight in excavator bug if needed in emergencies.
---
There is absolutely no reason to hoard and hoard stuff. 
---
Once you realise this isn't fallout 4 and you do not need 100 of every single item on the server you wouldn't need to play the sim's style inventory management game and be able to enjoy FO76 for what it is.
---
You have the ability to swap out Perk cards at any time.  Leveling isn't difficult, so just work on getting other Perks if you don't like them anymore.  I think F76 is well designed to prevent a character from being broken.
---
I can't see how it isn't mandatory anyways. Non-PA was a sacrifice as it was, now it's even worse. 
---
Please stop making skins ugly, or American-only.
---
Not equating these two things, so the haters can GTFO immediately.
---
I am not American. Your "Patriot" skin is a bit yuck to me.
---
I am also not a 3 year old child. The "Toy Soldier" skin was just a car-crash.
---
Blackbird - now THAT one worked! Hell, yes, mature, dark, brooding....in tune with the world, especially if combined with X-01. It fits why this PA would have this skin.
---
Fucking toy soldier? What? Really?
---
And Patriot? No.
---
Sure. Go for it. Report it. Feel better?
---
Wearing Power Armor full time you don't have to repair it for weeks.

---
I gave you 3 points in charisma, so you can share a perk. Instead of rad sponge you can use other perks(Hard Bargain, Travel Agent) as needed. With Starched Genes and Class Freak you can collect all the mutations late game. Melee perks are there so that you dont blow yourself up in close quarters combat, also it doesnt need additional ammo. The explosives will destroy everything in the distance. I advice you on using power armor.
---
Some additional useful perks: Power Patcher, Ammo Smith, Super Duper
---
Other people have asked for more "cool" stuff and less silly content, and I support that, but since I'm role-playing a wasteland Don Quixote I've *got* to ask... how about a suit of medieval armor?
---
&gt;ime for those calibrated shocks finally
---
I thought that was a mod not a plan though wasn't it?
---
Which has nothing to do with what I said. Whether or not people received advanced warning so they could adjust their builds had nothing to do with my statement. They put all those points in a build that was clear to everyone a while ago was going to get hit with the nerf bat hard. I have little sympathy for the people who lacked the foresight to invest their time and energy into a build that generated such a broken end result that its viability was clearly on borrowed time.
---
agree, Two Shot was never the issue.  
---
Missile Launchers and Fatmen were effectively useless before, and are doubly so now.
---
&gt;You misunderstand...  
---
&gt;the first line " The point of this post is for people who hate on this game."  
---
&gt;There is a difference between hate posts and constructive criticism with a positive attitude.
---
No Increase in stash amount? :(
---
Yes try it for yourself.  I wasn't waited 3 hours for my parasites to pass, so I just fast travelled to the golf course and drank from the water fountain.
---
I don't use PA so every day I repair my armor when doing endgame content silo runs solo/SBQ.
---
What I don't understand is why people are justifying the nerf. Multiple people are stating PA never gets broken.
---
I'm assuming its because they don't PVP or don't Touch End Game content. 
---
../agree
---
&lt;&lt;eyeroll&gt;&gt;
---
Sauce? 
---
Yeah, thanks for nerfing explosives and not fixing their shit durability or buggy and inconsistent damage.
---
You missed Tesla Rifles on the removing weapons with explosive mods list...
---
../agree, issue was Explosive being a Secondary effect.
---
Kill, laugh, love. That‚Äôs going right in my basket.
---
Well damn it I have a clip of a dude tanking 6 pump action shots but the bot keeps removing it cuz it's a xboxdvr link
---
Hope they nerf melee next!
---
This nerf can be a inconvenience for hoarders who (like me) dump in a mule most of the stuff we find in the world: crappy legendaries, collectibles, customes, potentially usable things in the future... 
---
Said this, I think it is fair, a common sense thing.
---
In the other hand I don't think dupers will have big problems with this limitation, as they dupe mostly expensive and easy to sell √≠tems, like serum recipes‚Ä¶ 0.25 weight items that go for 10K caps.
---
&gt;form a relationship.
---
Well, my wife no longer let's me play because community manager wants to be in a relationship with me and many other people 
---
Bloodied Explosive still god tier so doesn‚Äôt matter anyway.
---
Use blocker
---
Seriously man. they scare the PANTS off me nearly every time.  They don't take more than a few whacks from an All-Rise, but damn they startle me consistently.
---
Oh, look at mr fancy over here, with windows...
---
" Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap. "
---
I would hope so. It's anyone's guess at how often people are joining/leaving a server, but if it happens often enough, it's possible that it was negatively impacting server stability.
---
Also there is a sulphur water fountain at whitesprings you can drink and removes disease
---
I never said they were unfixable, just that it wasn't worth doing so (to them at least) especially since modders could do it.
---
This game was partially meant to be an opportunity to fix things when it made actual financial sense.
---
The issue is a few higher ups just wanted it out the door when it needed a year, a whole 'nother year would have smacked down a lot of issues leading to a much better launch. 
---
A few higher ups screwing up doesn't mean the whole company is incompetent or lazy. 
---
Awesome run - I'm not far behind you at about 385 hours. I am content with my level, I've found my "forever" spot for my camp and adorned it with all the facilities and d√©cor that make it perfect for me. I've collected my legendary weapons, accumulated all but one of the mutations and amassed a collection of Power Armors. I've exhausted the quests, I've participated in just about every event. I've hunted the wanted and helped those to have the misfortune to be in their path. While I've been teaming with plenty of random people, most recently I have set out to help lower leveled players. I've gathered, repaired and gifted multiple entire sets of T-51b Nuka painted PA to level 30 players. I've dropped off fresh-made BoS Recon Rifles and .308 ammo to level 1-20s. And I've dropped every spare aid, weapon and armor resource of mine in conspicuous high-traffic containers in hopes someone in need finds them. And I keep playing - hunting resources, 'living' in Appalachia, helping those around me, just to make the wasteland a little more civilized. It is immensely fun to me - the 'Fallout with Friends' that I have wanted for a lengthy amount of time. To be something other than the designated hero, I feel my time spent has been helpful to others, in turn, making their experience more enjoyable. The naysayers be damned, Fallout 76 is a fantastic game that has drawn me in and won't let go.
---
Haha...wasnt a contest, but good on ya mate! 
---
../agree 100% and it makes most other heavy weapons worthless now.  
---
Several suggestions were made, including setting it up so the Explosive perk didn't effect the Explosive Legendary effect, but it seems we went unheard.
---
If you want that bland of online game, why not then turn F76 to offline- Have 0 lag, 0 cheaters, 0 pvp, 0 downtime, 0 human interactions and they could turn VATS back on. + there was no server costs for them.
---
It's insane that these comments get downvoted. Who bought this game? Im so confused. lol
---
You're 100% right.
---
Why not start another one?
---
out of which of these increases the damage output? ive scrapped so many rifles..the only one that i notice is the hardened mod..it gives it like 10 or 12 extra damage points
---
I don't remember ever hunting for anything spesific. I always however checked vendors when I was near. As well as normally as I play long time, often when I start playing, the vendors should have been reset, so I start going through them before I do anything else.
---
It was always fun to find something I could use, be it some meaningless plan to unlock some .38 receiver into combat rifle I would never use, or some really fun targetting computer mod I can install into missile launcher.
---
Haven't yet checked the game, but now if everything is there...that's quite blend. I will have few days when I can buy everything and it's semi-cool but after that, it would become mostly irrelevant.
---
Yeah we live in the age of safe spaces and partition trophies...tbh I expect as much when I come out with a rational thought.
---
I meant excavator but lol yeah might be some disappointed folks. Lemme change the example.
---
I do recall that too, I used to farm non nukesprings all of the time then those scummy bases showed up qnd havent done it since because now theres always like 2 guys there
---
I just did the wendiog cave with my second character before the update. Went pretty well, was prepared, had a lot of drug, equipment in prime condition.
---
The first time I was there I think I died 6 or 7 times in there, yelling at my screen, no stimpaks left, all grenades gone, several drug addctions, my armor beyond repair.
---
It‚Äôs officially been long enough for me to consider playing RDR2
---
I went there when I was like level 17. At the entrance there was a level 47 glowing wendigo. And inside there was level 20 or 30. Killed both without dying somehow, but my heart was on overdrive.
---
I am rarely floored by the fact that someone is such a dick. It's truly stunning.
---
This would penalize every legit, old school MMO player currently in '76.  
---
I have Tens of Thousands of pounds of items, and spend half of my time in '76 giving out and equipping random people I meed, upgrading power armor of those in need, doing free armor upgrades etc, and this patch is going to make doing that impossible, what your suggesting is a knee jerk, poorly thought out reaction to a larger problem.  
---
The correct way to fix it would be looking for accounts with Legendaries know to be duped, and checking for 1,000 of the same bobble head, etc,,
---
No you are right.
---
I can‚Äôt play yet either it says my ‚Äúaccount lacks required entitlements‚Äù
---
It's not up to the developer it's all on Sony Microsoft and big N, Sony is very conservative about this and has refused it so far. 
---
considering it scales with str directly, yes. a simple fix would be to nerf the rate at which it scales.
---
I was already spending half my game recovering ammo from nuke events, now it would be 1 nuke event to ammo replenishment, and then in replenishing my ammo, I'd need to repair my non-power armor. And there goes 3 days of playing.
---
I'm with you, I'll come back when durabilities are fixed game wide. It's ridiculous now.
---
Have they proven it with past games though?
---
Ppl really forget how every bethesda game launched loaded with bugs and all kinds of problems
---
Ask (Bethesda) and ye shall receive (from Fallout fans)!

---
Absolutely essential.
---
Reduced, reduced, reduced. I have put in 147 hours and loved my time- but you keep finding ways to make this more of a slog to play. I really don't think you get it, and man I've been defending and pushing patience for months now. 
---
That studio needs a restructure. 
---
I had the... privilege... of running back to camp yesterday and getting assaulted by not one but three fucking scorchbeasts, nonstop attack spam, used like 10 stims, a bunch of my ammo, and they broke all my shit, and what do I get in return, a stimpack that one of them dropped and ultracite from their bones... honestly the XP was the only thing worthwhile but at level 192 I could care less about XP...
---
And now if this happens again Ill have to pay out the ass in resources to fix my armor because of a broken enemy that's still not fixed? I guess I'll have to resort to my level 10 tactics at level 192 and just ALT-F4 whenever I see one of those cancer bats.
---
I am from the Future where the Server Wer up and running. Still no vendor player ‚òπ
---
Two Shot should not have been nerfed at all, it was Explosive as a secondary effect that was, and is still an issue.
---
You do realize that in effect 2 is exactly the same effect as 1 right? , the only difference is health bars and numbers get bigger.
---
There is a difference between hate posts and constructive criticism with a positive attitude.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
I was going to say that but then i imagine there would be a whole slew of people intentionally inviting or joining teams just to make that another greifing mechanic. Id like that as a next step but in the interim i think getting a hud indicator is easier to ask for. 
---
I know what you mean the weapons were since the beta weak af. Yeah Fatman has a good dmg also after patch but normal rocket launcher or grenade launcher I prefer to have fun with is now crap.
---
So I mean my Auto Grenadeluncher does 270 dmg. After patch only 167. It's not funny to shoot full mag on lvl 68 super mutant. Wasting ammo on mass 
---
No you weren't. Lol. Even now you're being snarky. We're both on reddit. I doubt our time is that valuable. 
---
Just in time for the update which adds nothing to the game. Only takes away lol.
---
Yup thats what mine says, i just wanna get my levels up :(
---
the r just idiots... blody or armor piercing +explosive make similar damage like tse did before... becuase the the two shot was the problem but the explosive...
---
1 Endurance on my tank build &gt;.&lt;
---
I don‚Äôt understand the negativity either.  I guess they expected something else.  I have found plenty in the game to keep me entertained and occupied., and for some reason the bugs and technical issues haven‚Äôt affected me that much.  This game is a great case for trying out a game and not just going by reviews.
---
Could call them a bunch of Nerf Herders.
---
Assaultron: The Whitespring is under our protection
---
Glowing One: *HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM??????*
---
Until the sever disconnects are for realz fixed, I'm out...
---
&gt; Its literally any weapon that is either or
---
Let's be honest here, the overwhelming majority of people salty about this were rocking TSEs. Pretending otherwise is disingenuous. 
---
That has happened to me plenty since the game launched. I always take a look at the recent list before and after I go into a new server and go regularly kick me into the same server.
---
There's even posts by YouTubers talking about the same issue of server hopping and finding out they're going into the same server over and over.
---
I bought rdr2 at Christmas it remains unopened still 
---
Right after the nuke drop or when fast traveling to the Site?
---
If it's fast traveling it's likely the [PowerArmor HUD issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/) that they have still not commented on.
---
This is literally what is has said as an error when the servers are down since the beta. I assume it means they are up but only available for employees testing the patch.
---
I agree...pacifist mode is just broken
---
Lots of shitty ideas around here.
---
This one is good though.
---
Oof thats long, it was long enough that i started tidying my room to waste time
---
The fish slapping dance is even better. If you don‚Äôt laugh at the fish dance you‚Äôre not human.

Bye
---
So... Since you use PA and apparently don't do end game content your for nerfing something that doesn't event relate to you.
---
Sigh.... I run solo SILO, and do SBQ nightly. I have to repair my armor daily and multiple times a day.
---
I'm constantly penalized for using armor over PA and now I'm more fucked for not doing the meta.
---
Guess its all a ploy to make me purchase PA skins in the atomic shop. 
---
Passing by, a simple question : item plans are level-capped, I understand that. But why is there a max-level cap ? Why is a character level 50 NOT able to find a plan ? If I was somewhere else in the map during X level, I can no longer find some items ?
---
I don't get that part. Could you confirm that's how it works and that's normal ?
---
Idk what you‚Äôre going on about I am talking about the MONSTER MASH event inside watoga high school, not sure where you got SBQ out of that 
---
Why would there be bags laying around? I don‚Äôt understand?
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Oh my god blah blah blah it's a video game. 
---
Servers don‚Äôt quite patch and update as fast as you can dl a patch.
---
they ruined two shot wepons becuase non existent pvp....
---
What if the explosive big guns also benefitted from heavy gunner? Fat man, broadsider, missile launcher, etc. 
---
This nerf kills them all. They need to take a hard look at making the heavy hitters actually do what they‚Äôre supposed to
---
Are there Any Buffs Or only nerfs to perks and weapon? Also no new Contet rip
---
Everyone but you then.
---
I saw that but I have no idea what it meant or where that is. I just got the game Tuesday
---
Could have used it a couple of months ago, though... 
---
3 points in it really helps. Fireproof is an underrated perk. Maxed rank and you can sit for days against the SB's spam wave. 
---
You only get 5 characters max. 
---
It's my first time seeing it. Usaully I just get the "servers are down for maintenance" message. 
---
Lol I'm stupid and miss read. Whoops.
---
I always unload my unwanted gear on the corpse outside of the vault.
---
Exactly
---
Well i mean, it's still 2 bullets, just both deal 75 percent damage i guess?
---
Were you able learn the armor piece plans from a terminal before this patch?
---
I have 15 end lol
---
Hmm, you know I don't have an answer to that one. I'll ask around and see if there are any game balance/design choices behind that.
---
You're not missing anything. Ppl cry about nerfs.
---
I meant excavator but lol yeah might be some disappointed folks. Lemme change the top post a smidge.
---
Two Shot was never the issue, it was Explosive as a secondary effect, and it still, post nerf, remains the most powerful secondary effect.
---
Yeah, I'm sad my TS LAR is going to secondary status. Back to the Gauss rifle. On the other hand, I'm keeping the 40 extra mainframe cores Super Duper gave me during nuke preps. Seemed odd those were there. Great to know mods won't be scrapped pell Mell anymore, because really, if they're gonna nerf TS I need to get better receivers and not have them scrap. 
---
lol, apparently
---
Oh nice, I expected lower numbers!
---
Oh, lot's of people are disagreeing with me?  Could it be that I'm wrong?  No... they must all be shills and OP-build whiners, and I'm the only one that is right.  /s
---
Lol, keep telling yourself that buddy.
---
&gt; I‚Äôm not sure how you can foresee anything with Bethesda.
---
A class of weapon that was heavily duped flooded the game in ridiculous numbers, to the point where the game was completely saturated. I think it was a pretty fair deduction that these things were either going to get removed or nerfed to hell and back. 
---
I‚Äôm just about to cross 500 and I know someone at over 800. I build ‚Äúattractions‚Äù at workbenches for people to find and it keeps me busy and gives other people a chance to see something unique. I wish more people would do this too! One day I‚Äôd REALLY like to find something like that in my travels &lt;3 
---
Is it obvious to anyone else now that the developers do not play their own game?
---
Why should you pick anything if you don't have 10 caps?
---
On xbox / play station, any account gets Gold/Pro access as long as the console is set to the primary on a gold/pro account. so on my xbox i can make N+infinity silver accounts, then i can go log on to my wifes xbox and transfer all the stuff i dont want or need on to a mule. 
---
This just really screws over pc players, which for once... not so master race...
---
Lots of quality of life changes in this patch, really loving the plan marker if it‚Äôs known, but the dev team mindlessly nerfing things over and over and over again outweighs the good in these patches. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind it so much if they‚Äôd buff some other weapons and perks in these patches, along with nerfing. If this is the current rate that nerfs are going to be administered then the way I see it this game is going to lose popularity and die out fast. (as if it isn‚Äôt already)
---
So maybe you could just...I don't know *not use* the weapons that you find make the game too easy?  Rather than advocate taking them away from other people, who have their own play style and their own reasoning?  Maybe?
---
I hear that, nothings more annoying when you're doing a mission or working on your workshop and suddenly server disconnect 
---
It isn‚Äôt hard to level, but I‚Äôd still rather not have to spend my next ten levels respeccing rather than getting all he QoL perks everyone should eventually have. I chose the perks I did based on their value, the value has changed, let‚Äôs all be cool about it and just let me fix my shit.
---
Someone watches children of the corn
---
So at level 192 you don't have junk to repair your armor?
---
At level 75 i can repair all of my armor 10x 
---
That makes me sad. Would love to play with my PC bros. Even if they would just make more fun of me for liking console play instead of buying it for PC.
---
This!  I don't understand all the crying.
---
Tattered Field Jacket
---
The issue was never Two Shot, but Explosive, which remains the most powerful secondary effect, and it doesn't help against people with Assassin's + Sentinel combo's, if anything they are now even harder to kill.
---
I'm stoked they're adding stairs to the Atom shop but stairs overall need a hefty redesign. Why doesn't the new staircase spread completely across the 1 block square? Why do these staircases have huge gaps on either side without so much as a guarding rail? There are no C.A.M.P. assets that will fill in these gaps.
---
You didn't really touch on it but I slotted the chem resistant perks and found them absolutely useless. I have a stock pile of addictol completely eliminating two perk points, I have never gotten an addiction in over 50 levels and I eat psychotats like candy. The hydration and munchie one is only like 1% decrease if I read correctly (someone posted yesterday some numbers...). I'm running chems with a speed demon and I hardly feel it at all.
---
I moved the 5 points I had in endurance and split them between luck and strength and never looked back.
---
Every update has been taking about 3 hours on the server side.
---
There's also always the possibility of working with Bethesda to get licensing permission to publish.
---
That is literally the point. You create a functionally identical change for two groups without either group taking a look at the patch notes and seeing a big 'Eat Shit' sign stamped over their build.
---
I've been patient hoping this patch on 1/29 would fix it.  Guess I'll log in and see tonight.  Completed it a couple of times, not it's been over a month and a half for both it and Queen of the Hunt.
---
can we get a  similar solution for the mistress of mysteries quest rewards? i got rid of my voice of set on accident a while ago, then lost my blade of bastet to the disappearing paper bag bug just the other day.
---
Yeeeeeah, the endurance tree is definitely lacking and, for me, largely useless. But I personally know people who don't like the survival aspect (as easy as it is) and they are attracted to a number of those perks. I don't get it, but they do have a niche turns out. So idk. Some people use endurance, I don't. I use a lot of Perception, some don't. Variety in styles and gameplay needs, I reckon. Though I agree moving some of the defensive perks to endurance would be nice. Like Barbarian maybe. 
---
I think you replied to the wrong comment. 
---
I regularly use PA and fight the Queen. 
---
No..That's called being a d!ck.. I'd gladly fight* anyone. But certain Camp items(dconshower) are a nuisance to remake and you seem to get kicks out of anothers misery....That requires some serious self-reflection 
---
Yeah.  And that's fine until Rose starts sending you across the map again and again and you want to punch her floating sphere head to death and you wonder if there's something on TV or if you should just play Slay the Spire again.  And then all of a sudden your weapon is nerfed and you find out that the perks you picked don't actually work with your armor.
---
I presume you understand that players may deliberately select Pacifict Mode; and that someone who violates a player's desire to remain disengaged from PvP receives a kind of penalty---by themselves, these two aspects of gameplay indicate that the game is not of necessity PvP. 
---
If this were not the case, then we would expect there would be no option to play in Pacifist Modem, or that players who engage in PvP against players who have opted out of PvP would receive bonuses rather than penalties.  
---
To be fair, Auto-grenade needs an individual, weapon-level buff anyways. Hopefully it will get one.
---
It is, or now was, a common bug. This patch should fix that, it was happening to me and my friends who do not use controllers
---
 If you are on PC, you can initialize two instances of the game, by clicking on the their .exe directly (without using Bethesda launcher). I would suggest run the game in windowed mode with resolution smaller then your current screen so you can easily swap screens.
---
This was such a confusing nerf to White Knight. 
---
Same here, if my BT set craps out somehow I can't switch back to wired. Voice still works but all game sounds just die. All other games work fine with this swap. 
---
Well you haven't got a clue do you? There are lots of players that I PvP'd with and didn't 1 shot, because they actually know how to play the game and use perks, buffs and tactics to win. 
---
The fact they nerf'd explosive damage, when there was a game breaking explosive bobblehead stacking glitch being abused, isn't even the reason I have stopped playing (it does shows how little they actually test their own game, had to laugh  when they mentioned 'QA'). I have barely played this month and my shotgun was still considered 'OP'.
---
I'm no longer playing because the game is a complete mess and I'm not willing to be their beta testers, they should have sold this as early access but instead everyone has to put up with bug after bug after exploit after disconnect. 
---
Don't come back? Well that attitude isn't going to last long when the servers are basically empty and the development dies because nobody is buying their atom store content. Also, if by grief you mean help lots of lower level players by giving out junk, plans, aid, showing them where to do the best events etc, posting bug videos hoping it would get patched, then yeah I grief'd all day long.
---
The metal stairs should just be added to the game, I shouldn't have to spend atoms on such a basic item like that.
---
I didn't scrap it, I just dropped it because I didn't need to have a 3rd power armor frame given the carryweight situation. Screw that.
---
Caps are generally worthless in this game. Also you would just transfer what you need to trade onto your main account to accept caps.
---
Is that why i always find suitcases in train stations stuffed to the gills with loot? I thought they were gifts from high level players, its why i started dumping random stuff in them haha. Have you considered trying a different container in a far less populated area?
---
Invest in One Man Army. Better to cripple everything with the AoE when using none legendary explosive weapons. 
---
Like i got a Furious, Anti Armor missile launcher that rips Super Mutants. 
---
You gotta \[build for(risk)\] it, to get the biscuit. Know what i mean? 
---
I've sent in Feedback on this previously as well via Bethesda.net  Same boat, 1.5 - 2 months of no quest Heart of the Enemy.  Queen of the Hunt is another that no longer triggers on PC when getting into the area/going to the Hunters Shack Terminal.
---
I don't run the perk as a constant equipped card. I literally only use it for repair.
---
I require the points to be able to run adrenaline and the shotgun perk.
---
Without that card the repair costs are INSANE.  The ballistic fiber perk requirement for regular armor is insane.
---
People are trying to justify the nerf because THEY don't repair often. I repair DAILY due to what I stated and absolutely need  it for the reduce repair costs. 
---
I just don't like nerfs. They aren't creating a solution but just taking the easy road instead of innovating.
---
Thanks for the post.
---
The common sense response to this would be to not have VATS teleport. Seems melee characters should be expecting this, as it doesn't seem to be working as intended?
---
SOT has been out a while ten months, and has major updates regularly and already three dlc updates. It‚Äôs hard to justify the time fame of three months when most of these issues were known since beta. 
---
Agreed with this as well. It's like let's nerf rifle but let the 1 hit wonder melee stay strong. "Well it's not OP cuz you have to get close" uh huh, sure. 
---
&gt; This game is dead.
---
I agree with everything you said except that.
---
This game isn't "dead", but it's definitely in bad shape and it needs a **serious** overhaul in just about every aspect of it. Perk Card system is incredibly fucked up in terms of balance, efficacy, and usefulness / bloat. A lot of QoL stuff needs to be addressed (which BSW is doing, but taking their sweet ass time in doing so). And there are some features missing / bugged that should have been flagged and fixed during Alpha, let alone Beta.
---
The problem is that BSW, like most other gaming companies, only tests the first 20-or-so levels of their game. The first 20 levels / 10 hours of the game are absolutely fantastic, but then it quickly dwindles into monotony, unbalanced gameplay, a lack of end-game content, and a whole slew of bush-league bugs that should be embarrassing for a AAA game studio.
---
But guess what? BSW doesn't care to address this. They're not catering to hardcore players. All that care about is that we buy their game to cover the cost of production, and then they make profit off morons paying real money for useless shit out of the Atomic Shop. They know that no matter how many times they shit the bed, we'll all line up to buy the newest Fallout / Elder Scrolls game and suck that bugged out dick like the good little gaming whores we are.
---
Well, if ANY melee weapon could have been explosive or tho shot (lame I know) then I could understand the need for a melee nerf, cause right now, even with the nerf, the stackable extra power you can get with a TSE is still way bigger than then max 90% from perks that you can get for a melee weapon, so I still don't see why all the crying. TSE weapons were way too powerful and now tey still are the most powerful ones even after the nerf.
---
Those of us that use melee have to get 15 points in strength yes or yes, try to get armor pieces that give extra strength and weapons with more swing speed or more power attack damage (wich I still don't have being level 130) and even then, we still have to actually come at MELEE RANGE with anything we want to hit.
---
I agree with you about the weight limits though, and I also expected, if not the actual new content, at least a hint or a teaser from it but it was hopeless after all. We¬°ll have to wait a couple more weeks i guess before they even start talking about it :/
---
TLDR: TSE still are more advantageous than any other kind of weapon in game safe for base damage.
---
Dang, you are a whiny little bitch. 
---
https://youtu.be/Uopr50jKGQ0
---
With the amount of hate this game gets, I would loathe to be the employee that has to sift through all the troll submissions.
---
agree, it makes the Missile Launcher and Fatman, already niche underperforming weapons, more or less worthless.
---
It‚Äôs a marketing and customer service effort if anything and based on this OP thread alone, it does work for appeasing some customers. 
---
I just wish major companies would actually release games feature complete and mostly bug free and have a love for the titles they are releasing like say Indie game devs.  (Yes it‚Äôs a pipe dream =/)
---
There is a challenge for being in the world 7600 hours.  The challenge will tell you how close you are to that goal, thus functioning as a time-played monitor.
---
TSE definitely needed a nerf before this patch, but is needing both TS and E by 75% worthy? It seems like now weapons with both these effects aren‚Äôt worth the weight. Maybe revert to 75% for TS and keep E at 25% or raise it to ~30-40%?
---
I'm curious, what part of the game is monetizing player up time exactly? Its not like there's a subscription fee.
---
I guess because of caps. But nobody is going to drop millions of pounds of inventory so they can pick up caps. Thats crazy talk
---
It said that players over the \~1700 lb limit cannot stash items on themselves or gain caps. 
---
Pretty cool, I'm late to the party, just recently started to take pics and IT'S HELLA COOL! Last night took a few after the nuke, still raw talents to show up haha.
---
https://twitter.com/ManyATrueNerd/status/1090258910647279616
---
MATN has some good points on this update. 
---
Because they don't understand the root of the issue, Explosive as a secondary Legendary effect existing at all.    
---
Explosives aren't the issue, Two shot is not the issue, even post Nerf Explosive as a secondary effect is the most powerful possible one.  
---
Give those back! :P
---
I hate having to repair my armor and weapons but with these perks, I never had to repair anything. 
---
So I can see the Nerf. 
---
But still it's meh. 
---
We need new enemies
---
I want more skins for items that completely change their appearance, like the croquet mallet on the sledgehammer.
---
A witches cauldron that you stir as a skin for the camp stove and or chemistry bench, reskin the pitchfork as a broomstick etc
---
I want power armor SKINS, like having skulls hanging off the armor, body parts etc. 
---
We also need power armor paint for raider, excavator and ultracite. You guys made these 2 new sets of PA and players cant change the look of them. For me and my friends that means we don't use them
---
I can already kill anyone in two shots with melee, now that they can't one shot kill me with tse's, even though I have 500hp and fireproof, I'm going to straight up murder anyone who attacks me.
---
Okay. Then get a fucking life.
---
Seems like it‚Äôd be easy to do basic armor paint using the same system as the robot paint from Automatron. 
---
It's not that I don't have junk, it's that now it'll get depleted faster. My stash is only like 40% materials and 60% weapons (ill probably never use) and chems (that I make and sell on a daily basis).
---
I agree with your statement but at the same time who releases an empty husk of a game this lacking in content in the 1st place?
---
shhh dont talk about sneak/crit builds, the melee whiners will start calling for that to be nerfed. 
---
YES! THIS EXACLTY EXACTLY THIS! my friend runs the "grenaider" type explosive guy..this nerf litteraly hit every weapon he uses "splody laser pistol"..."two shot pipe pistol" and all the splody grenades mines and launchers...I'm like "jesus dude they nerfed you to oblivion"

I believe I said good day, sir!

White Knight is/was overpowered;
---
I don't remember the last time I had to repair my armor and power armor, maybe 2, 3 weeks ago ? even after multiple fights against scorchedbeast.
---
If you aren't paying for it you are the commodity. Facebook has no subscription fee, do you think they aren't monetising usage of the service?
---
Sounds like my explosive laser gatling might end up being worth some caps after all! 
---
This game is creepy late at night lmao
---
Wendigo lives matter!
---
It hurts the smaller shop people who dont dupe who have 2000 pounds of stuff they farmed at whitesprings 
---
I can get my hammer to 20k plus damage... yes they are that OP.
---
Had mine from the BOS vendor in Watoga. Also had Brick walls and metal door plans off him.
---
Why pick a station to drop your stuff? Couldn't you just drop it at a location that would be visited by players less often. Personally I use a third party to transfer stuff from one account to the other usually someone I trust not to run with my stuff.
---
So, if they update the loot charts in a future update, what would your stance be?  As you've clearly stated this game should cater exclusively to a crowd that don't earn gear in so much, as they have time to play-out averages - which is not skill based.  Having more time to play with a shitty RNG is not about better players, intelligent playing, or anything of the kind - it's simply waiting out in the most mediocre method possible.  If my time is worth $50 bucks an hour in real-life, $15 or even $25 - it costs me either an hour, 4 hours or 2 hours to bypass a broken system and acquire what I want:  this price includes being banned and starting a new profile.  The actual gear price starts at, what $5?  If you're time is so worthless, don't be surprised when others do the math faster than you and know how to spend it better. 
---
just like two shot nerf.... when the tse was op only.. and why ist walled tow shoot anymore?
---
You again lol. I sense strong TSE hate in this one. Must have had his base destroyed a few times. 
---
Facebook has ads for revenue.
---
Start one account normally with the luncher, then make a link to your fallout76.exe on you desktop, start the exe, it will then ask you for you login name and password..
---
Then you magically have 2 fallout 76 running, even better if you have 2 screens :)
---
Just tab or move the mouse to the window you want to use ;)
---
Tse will still be pretty powerful - just not overwhelmingly so.
---
I got too frustrated with my hunting rifle tickling most enemies in the 40-60+ range so buying the TSE Lever Action off someone made it bearable.
---
many of us spent countless hours on treasure maps and server hopping, they went bi-polar on the response that some things were too rare and have now invalidated all of the time invested.
---
Why you care about votes?
---
Facebook does not sustain itself on advertising revenue.
---
Then you're not "screwed" moron. Dear fucking God you're going to have to wait. Want someone to call the police so you can tell the officer where they hurt your oh so sensitive feelings. 
---
I posted this exact same message when they first announced the nerfs two weeks ago and I got called a crybaby and downvoted to hell ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
At least you made it to the front page üëç
---
What is really defined as "Armor" ?  
---
Im aware that regular over clothes ( under outfit lol) is consider armor  
---
But ... power armor? ??
---
But u can post this. Crappy movie ea?
---
Naw, I'm against all the unbalance shit in this game, including melee. 
---
"kind of"  
---
The ammo and upgrades are all Science based perks, which are energy weapons.
---
Was that on PC? JimmRiddle01 launched the nuke? If not we had the same, almost 3/4 Just to get her to regen then obviously ran out of time...
---
I saw some tamed thing when trading and it attacked me. I think it was Grafton monster, it's attacks were slow and weak, but it was definetely hostile to me. Also I think the players turrets might also shot me a bit, but I think we were teamed so they didn't do anything, or were out of range. 
---
Felt little bit like that monster was aggroing on me and that dragged the turrets into it as well.
---
Would also be great if we could combine the steel support parts with railings like we could in 4.
---
Every day, we move further from god.
---
They never did anything good for the wasteland. They are cannibals.
---
I dont care about how many votes i get, im just bothered if people downvote and dont give comment or say why, constructive criticism is nice
---
Apparel - Mothman, Deathclaw, Mega Sloth costumes
---
Camp- Clean tub, toilet, walls. Clean shower &amp; sink which don't have dirty versions in the game at all. It'd be nice if they were workable as well. Different color walls that you can paint or you can apply wallpaper to, working mirrors(they aren't reflective at all)
---
Skins-Camo, Black, and chrome for all weapons. PA with deep claw marks and dings, if it triggers when it's below 50% health that'd be even cooler. 
---
You used to have to farm the plans, which was pretty difficult for most players. Now you‚Äôre going to get them after completing a quest.
---
I can't get them to respond on any platform, even when multiple people have tagged the community managers..  
---
[I even went so far as to provide them a potential fix here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/).
---
Damn, they nerfed white night...
---
Aha, so I can bypass the Beth launcher....that was my main sticking point tbh. Do I need to install in two different directories or edit the registry to make it work? 
---
Windowed mode is not an issue, as I have a 34" UW (my beloved Alienware. In a competition between my left nut and this monitor, goodbye, nut. The right one was always the harder worker anyway...ahem.).
---
I don't like the UW patch, so I still run in 2560x1440 mode windowed. I can easily run two overlapping instances.
---
If you have a link I could follow, it'd be greatly appreciated :)
---
Thanks, and pass along thanks for taking what is a DLC of Fallout 4 basically and turning it into a proper game (once the additional content is released). There's a ton of fun and it's obvious a lot of work went into this, we appreciate the effort all of you do to make this game right!
---
Im level 86 and I have plenty of junk to repair my armor several times. 
---
The thing with this nerf is that will have repair your armor more often and that junk stash will go away sooner than you expect.
---
This will make you farm for junk more often too. 
---
Bottom line, with these nerfs they're trying to make the game last longer by making you grind and farm.
---
Personally I think its a huge mistake. People are hungry for new content, not to farm for more springs.
---
Nope ps4. I just find it ridiculous that they recommend 8+ players, but anything over 5 makes it almost impossible.
---
becuase only 6.5% of the players have the scorched earth achievment. the restr dumb low player and every "elit" player is a duper for them.
---
There is no bobblehead stacks anymore.
---
That blue would be fantastic!  I have the red already but I would be on board for a Quantum paint job!
---
This always, always happens in games with pvp. Nerfs become a huge thing to balance pvp regardless of its impact on other gameplay features. This might not have been as critical if Fallout 76 launched with pvp and pve servers but they chose the route they did and its impacted all decisions since.
---
Mind posting a pic of build and weapon DPS.
---
I'm about to be so sad when I get home and peep my dps :(
---
Or just make it to where everything is just duplicates. Like for rank 3 you just use 3 cards
---
love me some radsheild.300 rads 15 minutes and it dont turn off mutations. Also wearing trapper armor and even putting lead mods and you are fine. Its just people not sseeing all the other perks/items that arent Fotm. Prolly why i got chased around called a hacker cause im so fast(pistol build).
---
So do I, gotta find that one newbie to grab some for me.
---
And the problem was never Two shot, but Explosive being a secondary...
---
Yeah, so far I've only found them in the original spot by Dyer Chemical.  It's annoying, because I can only find 2 or 3 at a time, and only at night, and sometimes they aren't bloomed....  When you do see then though, equip that farmer perk(can't remember the name).  That, along with chemist and super duper can net you quite a few at a time.  The time they last is almost perfect for a queen fight, 15 minutes a piece.
---
What I don't understand, are the people with the chat mod who apparently login and spend the next 5-6 hours sitting in their camp whining in global chat.
---
I'm looking at you Travis29somethingsomething. 
---
Does moving the special perk count as your level up, or can you reallocate points AND recieve the level up point? Just curious as I have a few points I wouldn't mind shuffling around now that I understand the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and the perks a bit better.  Can you reallocate a bumch of points each level up, or just a single point?
---
So that means less people are able to do anything to her I guess.
---
He who walks behind the rows is a old one but not as old as The Father but yes I know of him 
---
I wanna know where in Fort Defiance, because I went through every terminal after getting the Power Chassis from there.
---
It‚Äôs easy to play solo with this style but when you‚Äôre trying to get hits in with other players around, it‚Äôs definitely more challenging. I think OP is trying to point out that despite not being a melee build, melee is still very strong for him, whereas a melee build trying to do sneak/crit would have a really hard time.
---
No! They can't do that! It might make it worth using again!
---
Please, please, *please* do something about Flamer durability/fuel.
---
It takes 10 acid, 5 oil, and 2 steel to craft... 5/9/14 (base/ammosmith/superduper) Fuel?
---
That's *crazy,* even if the Flamer *didn't* use about 10 Fuel per *second* (really not exaggerating).
---
This is the only weapon I've found that works with Friendly Fire, and it is completely unsustainable. Please do sonething.
---
people have been saying that they need to fix their game before they add onto it, but it's now becoming apparent that their pace for fixes honestly just isn't fast enough. we're coming up on three months of this game being live and they're still playing whack-a-mole with exploits and bugs. only a few balance issues have been addressed, and they've almost exclusively been addressed through nerfs, which is hugely impactful on player psychology: it ain't fun to wait 2+ weeks for a big bitch batch of fixes only to have your build get fucked and there's nothing new to play with because nothing else was changed.
---
i would so much rather see them start to throw numbers at the wall at this point, because the route they're taking ("doing nothing for a long time") is unfun and people are getting tired of waiting for them to address basically ANYTHING. why *not* just bump energy weapons up by 20%, see what happens? why *not* adjust heavy weapon durability? it cannot possibly be any more unbalanced than the 2 1/2 month reign of TSE.
---
&gt;a way to break up 'leveled' perk cards.
---
this. that should be a thing.
---
Time to prime weapons.
---
Find someone with the above mentioned armor and have them crouch in PVP, you'll kill them right away, we did it last night.
---
What are the stats of your auto grenade launcher? 
---
Initial question was asking who is waiting for the update to be done, and then wondering how everyone is while we are waiting for the update
---
He forgot his hazmat suit
---
Right, when you literally can't just change what your character is.  All the class features locked on your character.  So you can literally swap out anything you want at any time now.  When you get high enough you should literally have every card possible and can remake your character at any time.  The only thing holding you back is your SPECIAL points, but unless you go from a melee to ranged you really won't change those much at all.
---
&gt; to match other weapon perk damage bonuses  
---
In the entire history of video games (yeah, I know), this has to be the lamest, dumbest reason for a nerf ever. At no point, someone at Bethesda said "ok, we nerfed an entire underpowered weapon class, now let's adjust each weapon back to a usable state"?  
---
It looks like a bunch of interns doing whatever balance change they feel like, with no coordination at all.
---
I'm sorry dude. It if you're refusing to play the game because you won't move your finger a key down that's a tad silly imo. 
---
But no it hasn't changed, like you said you can just rebind it.
---
We wish you luck on your future endeavors.
---
War never changes.
---
Nop. Go to the install folder, double click on the .exe, as soon as the bethesda logo shows up, u are free to click again, and have another instance to be opened in the next sec.
---
 The game acts in a weird way for me, when I run two instances in full screen or windowed with full resolution. But I think it has to do with my computer. Its a very simple process.
---
Help I bought what I thought was supposed to be a PvP/Survival game at launch but it just turned out to be a co-op PvE game.
---
That'll be 666 atoms please
---
Ive used two different weapons in the clip  
---
A two shot explosive shotgun \*\*\* with a 25% speed reload buff and the same but in a lever action with a weight reduction instead, the marsupial mutation / serum ( could jump higher with right team and perk cards)
---
It does affect PvP as much as PvE. You try killing enemies just for a TSE user to wax everything in one shot. The guns were too powerful and there is no way to justify the use of 700-1500 damage a shot.
---
I just had a look at it. Did You mean main changes to explosives perks and mods?
---
I had a SBQ about 8 hours ago on PC where here health was barely moving. I don't know who launched but this was my first SBQ I was thinking abandoning as 15 minutes in, her health was like 85% and my loadout simply couldn't make a dent unlike any other times before. Her DR was especially high this time apparently.
---
gun is a pump shotgun expmosive serum/mutation marsupial 
---
I know the deal, I'm almost in that same spot, so I decided to not do item transfers until we get private servers. Makes it harder and funnier!! :)
---
I liked my two shot. Even in F4 now its useles.. two shot needs to be two shots... dont care abput how they'd nerf the explosions of a tse but cmon, finding a two shot will now be "meh, i need inventory space"*drop
---
Fallout 3 had that dlc the pit with an ammo maker/converter that would be swell af
---
Eh yeah I hear you. I'm on PS4, but it looks like you PC guys have a work around for running mule accounts that make it pretty easy.
---
Yup your math is correct.
---
All we can do is pray to Todd that they dont touch the 90% weight reduction perks
---
YEAH :( RIP my 600 BFS :( I will maybe put it to use now :(  
---
Oh my gaaawwwwd. This game's updates are ***glacially slow***. Oh yay! We successfully got a "Known" tag included in the game!!! We are literally cheering that in the span of two full weeks, they included the words "Known" at the beginning of the a label. 
---
And in the patch notes there's a dev note saying "we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size." Gee. Still??? How long will that take?
---
I'm sorry, I hate being negative about this. I've been so positive about this game for months, now! I'm generally a positive person! But this is just beating me down. My best friend and wife just both quit today, for lack of literally anything to do - and now I'm The Lone Wanderer, yet again. 
---
There is nothing in these patch notes that make this game even fractionally more fun. Nothing to come back to! And the first actual content in March? And it's primarily a beta PVP mode that very few people actually want as a feature, playing to the game's weaknesses, rather than its strengths? 
---
I wish they would take a page from other online games like Destiny or even the dreaded Fortnite. WEEKLY activities, changes, new rules, new events, SOMETHING. Anything! There should be some reason to play every single week. 
---
Well, at least after two weeks we get "Lighting no longer flickers throughout Arktos Pharma." -\_-
---
*We felt the weapons except energy was too durable, so we're reducing durability across all of weapons pool to bring it in line with energy guns.*
---
No they can't?
---
You won't have to worry as it's rarely used anyway.
---
Oh I agree concerning lever action and sneak,it can one shot enemies easily. But after that one shot they will come looking for you and then you have a choice of regular (lvl 50) guns or a good melee. When they mob on you lever action become almost worthless. (I do love that rifle though)
---
I wanted to see why people are praising a game that is objectively bad.
---
if you see me out there with a high bounty, I promise you that i have the caps.
---
Yeah the event exp reward was nerfed lower than the ex an enemy in that level even gives. If an enemy gives 2-3x more the reward then participating in the event is pointless. So now after today, good old whitesprings still seems to be the place to be. 
---
Elevators.
---
We do not follow Malachi. We follow Isaac Chroner who interprets the will of He Who Walks Behind The Rows... And you WILL know his wrath!
---
And to add to your list, the ever faithful and 100% accurate "weather rock"!
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock
---
Plus you end up with so much junk!!
---
What can i say? These people just hadn't reached their limit yet i guess.
---
&gt;Carry Weight: Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character‚Äôs current maximum carry weight. 
---
For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
---
Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
---
Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
---
RIP Player Vendors 
---
Maybe an item you can buy from vendors for caps to respec? Like 1000-2000 caps for a respec item, single use?
---
The bloodied counteracts not using TSE, but doesn't get to the same level of power. It's a fair trade to have 40HP instead of 275HP, and not wear armor.
---
Well now it's going to be as useful as being in combat or marine armor, so yeah.
---
The game is heavily discounted and can be had for 15 dollars or less in some places. If a duper is making money in game it won't stop them buying another copy of the game for 5 more mules.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay to respec after they nerf all kinds of shit tho. 
---
Hahaha.
---
Okay, I over exaggerated. Still, 30 strength and strength directly affects damage (no other SPECIALs do that). He still has probably 20 in everything other than END. He could literally do a pistol crit build better than I can and he‚Äôs a melee build, and I‚Äôm a pistol crit build. 
---
Still doesn't leave much room for constructive criticism does it?
---
Finally a day off and I have to wait üòÇ.
---
Oh well. Haha
---
Does anyone know how long it usually takes? 
---
Mhh sounds good to me. I think I have a AA auto grenade launcher with limb dmg and Bloodied or TS rocket launcher in my Stash I think now I have to put them out üôÑ
---
Dude that was pretty the best thing i read for a long time hahahaha üí™üòÇ
---
hmm niche but good to know
---
There definitely needs to be more of an negative impact for players to kick up a high bounty. I remember seeing someone walking around with 2000 cap bounty. So if they don't have 2000 caps they can continue killing players and wrecking CAMP's which is a huge flaw.
---
You can't repeat the quest or open the chest yourself (it spawns locked), but you can loot the chest when it is open, which it often will be due to being in a low level area. Should only take a server hop or two to find it open.
---
Nerf everything!  All weapons do 1 damage regardless of any perks!  Max exp for any creature is 3!  Thanks Bethesda!  We are all equal now!
---
Thank you for the explanation, that's unlucky then
---
Yeah, I thought I was done repairing my armor every ten minutes with White Knight, but apparently not.
---
You havent even seen the message yet, or how often it pops. Dont complain yet.
---
Yes. There has been loads of hours I‚Äôve been online just hanging out with friends participating in events and farming loot. Not actually going for exp and levels.
---
So many players were pissed about TSE nerf. And most of them actually had valid arguments. What did Bethesda do? Nerf both the effects AND the perk related to Explosive. Did they even read what we had to say? Not being offensive but it just makes no sense. I really wanna understand the though progress. Is seems like such a lazy nerf to me. Two Shot was op in Fo4 so it is in Fo76. The **real** problem is the combo of TS and E. Disabling weapon drops with **both* effects seems so much easier. Then nerf the explosive and Two Shot to... idk 50%? 40%?
---
Oh and a big thanks to dupers ruining the fun with TSE for legit players.. You really outdid yourself...
---
Yup, now everything explosive is trash. üòÇ
---
actualy... the pvp patch will come at march. personaly i really don't care with pvp ( i have 3000+ hour rust and ark expeience already and its enough for me) so im not intrested.. and after march we need wait long months to get some pve content... if even we got any. i really sure this game will die out til marc.. i have few goals in this game, like to get "sign and letters" for 12.000cap and get all thread for underarmors and its all. simple there is no motivation for me to play. the just trashed my preciouse two shot gaus... its a game.. true... but i really disaponaited. now i need 2-3 shoot to kill a singel trash mob instead one... they just waste my time and amo.
---
Repair it with Weapon Artisan and it actually isn't totally worthless. I use it in Whitespring nuke area even though I'm usually a stealth sniper (running in PA in nuke zones, ofc)
---
Ranger District Station (cranberry bog) has one in the back shed with the cages. 
---
Mountainside Bed and Breakfast had one on a shelf at the bottom floor, near a tinker work bench. 
---
Clarksburg has one in the hardware store, top floor above a shelf.
---
There's another one somewhere but I forget. You can sometimes find mods for them from vendors. Or scrap em but it may take awhile. 
---
Why would they dump items?.. that doesnt make sense. They will just leave them in their alt and slowly pull them out as needed.
---
They are the only players in the game with 50k carryweight. I dont see anyone rushing to fuck that up anytime soon. Worthless fix. Now those guys are worth even more.
---
Crouching yes, it takes them out of Sentinel. I'm talking about jumpimg, specifically. Here's a video of it in action: https://youtu.be/2-fIcJXCOCA
---
Check back in 75 days. Seems to be the turnaround for issues like this.
---
I noticed they didn't mention the new airdrop mechanics where if you take from them you become wanted.  I guess that was an intended change?
---
200 hours in a was already lvl 150+ with no content in sight.
---
He is saying even if you rebind it you can still only use E.
---
I never heard of that before. E is usually the interact/use button for me so I never had to rebind it.
---
OOOooo, i see what you were putting down. I thought you were talking about the "AoE" effect as a secondary effect. 
---
You may be onto something. However i prefer the possibility to get a weapon with 3 primary effects over only 1 possible. Until this game offers 10+ primary/secondary/etc variants i wouldnt like this change. 
---
Go to bunker, go to top of the world, go to bunker, go to top of the world etc.. this content?
---
I do the same as you and I‚Äôve never been remotely close to +1500 lbs overweight.  In fact, I‚Äôm rarely overweight at all and have all the materials I could ever need or share.
---
Saying this patch will make sharing impossible is a poorly thought out, emotional response because it‚Äôs going to force you to be more efficient and you just don‚Äôt want to do that.
---
Tesla rifles fire a physical bullet, even though they're classified as energy weapons. 
---
&gt;I dealt with homewreckers for a bit and kept the shower available, but after completely repairing my place at least a dozen times over the past week, I just put the shower in storage.
---
Are you sure it's players? If your camp is in well populated place with players going to it or near, it will also drag NPC enemies there.
---
Do you have constructor perk? I think I've repaired my shower once but I don't remember it requiring any flux. I think it was broken, because graphics was visually broken&amp;glitched. I don't have enough luck to have streched genes normally on so I avoid getting near it.
---
Or it's possible I missed it, as I usually repair everything at once, and the list of components is very long.
---
Yeh i thought they were going to add cool new events and stuff as time went on, literally nothing in that regard has changed since release. Im waking up and smelling the roses now (always defended this game in the past) and ontop of that they have completely gutted my only character that i have worked hard building. Im getting my platinum and then jumping off this wild ride.
---
&gt; Hopefully the individual weapon types will be buffed.
---
Usually, you do that at the same time you nerf the weapon class. But not Bethesda.
---
I think that's a really, really petulant way to look at an overwhelmingly positive change.
---
PC version is a bad port of the console version. But 4k and high frame rates would be a luxury. My computer *could* support it, but  I can't enjoy them low resolution textures we do get. Crashes and server disconnects have all but completed tarnished every session I've had playing this game. The PS4 version may appear to be more "stable" but I'd wager it's just more insulated from a wider community using exploits. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree with you more.
---
While I was fine with the nerfs to ts and explosive legendary weapons, I am not at all ok with the nerf to demolitions.
---
And for Bethesda to already start dishing out nerfs(even if they were needed) before fixing an entire class of weapons(energy) and several other weapons is really just a slap in the face to players. I mean the entire game I‚Äôve been forced to not use the type of guns I enjoyed the most in previous fallout games.
---
I wonder if I'll be able to run 2 games with only 8 Gb RAM :P
---
Maybe i get 1-2 FPS on both or I toast the GPU/Micro but I'm going to definitely try that.
---
Single ground block usually with stairs attached leading up to a platform or house, everyone was building these types of camps when it was difficult to move camps and place your building. 
---
Now nobody needs to do that.
---
FINALLY MY DRILL WILL BE VIABLE!!!!
---
Don't hold your breath.
---
I'm not hung up on immersion man, and I DO get irony - Fallout has had a sneaky (or overt in a lot of cases) sense of humour about the whole bombs thing since the first game.
---
But c'mon, a vault dweller comes out of the vault, braves some trials, finds a refuge, dons a suit of power armor, and immediately says "What I need to do here is be an explosion in a paintball factory. I need to stand out like it's disco night, and everyone is wearing neon. What sets me apart from them? THIS PAINT"? No.
---
Plus apart from all the disagreeing (I am assuming we'll disagree), it's just plain UGLY.
---
It seems like weapon damage affects the scaling, because there was a time when I killed SBQ duo with lvl 35 guy in 3-4 mins by I using Two Shot Gatling Gun. Then a few levels after, from around 150-190, I had a duo situation again with a low level guy, and TSE Gatling Gun with me, we ran out of time. Both of these times there weren't initially more people when she spawned nor did anyone else join us. Either weapon dmg affects the scaling, or levels past 150, or Gatling Gun did too much damage to damage the queen, because of the hp bug. Based off of this, I think SBQ won't be much harder if harder at all, but we'll see. I hope I'm not wrong.
---
I just want private servers...I never had nor still have no desire to play this game with anyone but my friends.
---
PvP, dupers exploits blah blah blah just give us private servers.
---
you obviously  havent played sneak build. spoiler they will look but still wont see you. 
---
I can see why that must feel frustrating.  
---
As someone who has never used either repair perk, however, the change you mention doesnt affect me at all.  I am a casual player (maybe 1-3 hours 2-4 times a week) and I have no problem finding junk to keep myself repaired.  
---
maybe bethesda wants to steer the game away from being completeable in under 1 month by power gamers?

Can the team please GET ON IT? Jeebus. How long does one discussion possibly have to last?!?!
---
Thank you, that KNOWN thing is going to be so helpful. I‚Äôve been afraid to buy any plans. 
---
Fallout fanfiction is an oversaturated market right now
---
Ubisoft..ea..blizzard style nerfing
---
Stoked.
---
Thank you :)
---
Is that really the problem here ? Or are you just grasping at straws ?
---
Drop them in a bag on the floor and forget them :)
---
Either get a friend that you can trade stuff over with or find one of the many locations that have containers and allow you to place your camp. You can use any spot, but the more secluded the better. For example the cabins north of the cat lady's house, not a lot of traffic there. Build both your accounts CAMPs at the same spot. Then use the friend list method or invite some random player to a party and ask them to let you join back on them. If they act suspicious towards you, you could also just say that you died and then got DCed and are trying to get your bag back or whatever.
---
Once you have a way to get back in the same server, go to your CAMP find a container and drop away. Quit back to the menu, switch accounts, then load back into the same server, loot the container.
---
My build doesn't even use unyielding because for SBQ it sucks you just get killed by rads, my build you're power armour with a bloodied rocket sledge at low health does 2k plus with all perks proc'd. 
---
If you'd like me to list the perks I'm using I will do so when the servers are back up for me.
---
These puns are burning up on re-entry.
---
White Knight doesn't affect power armor, power patcher does. Power armor is crazy durable on it's own except the legs. Why is everything hitting the legs? 
---
Im sure theres a game design reason why nerfing is often prefered to buffing. When the time comes they will have to do buffs aswell.
---
The recent change in Fireproof has made Endurance slightly more attractive.
---
I was playing a Tiny Tina(Borderlands) build, explosive/grenades &amp; melee. I‚Äôm honestly thinking about restarting and trashing her now. I already quit my rifle character, it‚Äôs been super rough keeping &amp; making enough ammo(even with my camp on a lead node). Seems like with every character I create, before I can get it leveled up, I lose the ability to achieve the play style I was lusting after. 
---
While I‚Äôm beyond not thrilled, I also understand they were trying to nerf the TSE for a more even playing field. I don‚Äôt even have a TS or explosive legendary, sad it effects us too. 
---
The sacrificial blade mod adds a star.
---
Just want to add that if a gun breaks "100% more slowly", that means it will never break.  That's because a guns that breaks 100% more slowly has a 0% rate of breakage.  And the inverse of 0 is, of course, infinity.
---
I use a container that's in a far distant corner of the map that most people don't know exists. Never lost anything, I just have to rely on having a friend in world or randoms accepting an add. 
---
This patch:  YOU GET A NERF! AND YOU GET A NERF!
---
**EVERYONE GETS A NERRRRFFF**
---
There are some good and bad patches. But the only one i think is rediculous is that you call. Killing a ton of enimies at once an "exploit" thats called grinding it is in every other game as well. Thats the only way to grind xp, if you have to work for it and its not a glitch then its not an exploit. Your basically taking out all of the best grinds in the game out, to where theres no endgame besides collecting legendaries just saying. I kind of wonder why you keep nerfing xp because it really doesnt help players to be lvl 300, there no more powerful than my lvl 80, its not like they get more or better perks? Your basically only nerfing low lvl grinding which is terribly slow already because you get like 30 xp per kill till your around lvl 50 and by that time you should have your build done so theres no reason to go higher. I just dont understand the logic behind that, you've nerfed xp every single update, is there an actual reason? The reason im concerned is because in other fallouts my favorite thing was making new characters for diffrent builds and roleplays, however in this one you've now made it impossoble bc i dont have months to spend on one character, i work full time. So i guess im pretty much done with this game after this build until you add some decent end game stuff. 
---
Though i do like the way you have taken care of the dupers this time, actually thought it out. Good job, maybe the economy in years to come can recover
---
And we're live!!! 
---
Sacrificial blade mod for the machete adds a star. Targets bleed and are poisoned
---
#accurate
---
It‚Äôs the scorched mod it adds a star so if you have a 3 star it turns it into a 4 star
---
Console pleb here. No game files for me. Will take a look. 
---
Back up now! 
---
Now that plans are always stocked, just go buy the Calibrated Shocks. You'll be able to carry more, then.
---
Those are hackers.
---
&gt;!jk!&lt;
---
It is AWESOME. I bought mine from SparkWoods, highly recommend it!
---
Can we just have Explosive effect removed from the game and everything brought back to when it was usable? Currently it feels like every single balance patch is trying to bring TSE/Explosive legendary weapons in line and ends up kicking every single weapon type in the balls by trying indirect nerfs that hit other already underperforming weapons. 
---
It‚Äôs not that bad, you can pull 170 raw violet off a SBQ nuke. I‚Äôve been using anti armor ultracite since way before the tse nerfs were talked about and my tse handmade still doesn‚Äôt do as much damage.
---
You‚Äôll be fine I promise
---
Even in small doses this can be annoying, and as I also mentioned, it sets a bad precedent. How many other things will Bethesda feel we need to be aware of in the future? 
---
Simply put though, this is a lazy band-aid on the poor reception H/H has had. When your PVP mode is not popular and not fun, spamming an entire server with notifications that some minorities are trying to get into it is **not the solution**. 
---
But if they give us an opt-in button, which is what this should have come with in the first place, then I will be content.
---
Looks like he's just added the sacrificial blade. It's a mod. Think it's more damage to scorched but less to anything else by 20% but I could be mistaken. It didn't drop 4*. It would have dropped 3* 
---
Dense + Fireproof allowed a pure explosive build to be completly undamaged from explosives before the nerf. You could survive everything except a direct hit from the fatman. 
---
You Sir, are awesome! üòÇ
---
Is there one? haha
---
It is AWESOME. I got mine from Sparkwoods, I highly recommend it!
---
See you at Harper's Fairy!
---
Which means no more mule characters
---
You'd argue with a brick wall if you could, wouldn't you?
---
Yes it is a genuine complaint, as multiple people have complained about the debuff and their desire for a respec to make up for the change. 
---
Edit. Yeah poison damage not less and more. My bad. 
---
It should automatically update, but you can ask it to manually check for updates. It should be version 1.0.5.10
---
Oh ok. I had never seen this before honestly
---
Didn‚Äôt people know a need was coming for a while?
---
She is hostile to other players (including my team), yeah.  Since you have all the perks to pacify you can re-pacify so teammates can exist nearby for a little while but yeah it‚Äôs a little annoying. 
---
Still worth it to have a deathclaw in my house though. 
---
Fuck this game
---
The anti-griefer debuff should kick in as soon as a player's bounty exceeds their currently carried caps.
---
That's actually a really good idea. I just thought eventually I'll be a high enough level lol.
---
Because compared to any other weapon they are the most underpowered when it comes to dps (damage and durability) just because someone uses it does not mean they are suddenly powerful. I used them aswell that doesn't make them good. When you are using the weapon wether you like it or not you are putting yourself at a disadvantage compared to any other build.
---
So now you can‚Äôt one-shot everything. Oh no, a new challenge!
---
I'll give it a shot. I just don't like trying to farm in nuke zones since they're usually pretty unstable.
---
Because they never listed to us since the pre-beta. 0 excuse it wasnt the case at launch.
---
(Poated multiple threads about this since pre-beta)
---
Disagree, and how often have you equipped someone completely in a ranged, Close combat, full set of upgraded armor and if needed Power Armor?  
---
Have you calculated the total scrap and fluxes needed for that kind of operation?  I can go through a few hundred pounds of Junk a night, WITH the perks equipped.
---
It may seem excessive, but it's how I operated and helped people, and to be honest it's not OP to give someone a full set of Noturnal, Mutant (especially at low levels) or weightless gear, for the protection from accidental scrapping alone.  
---
probably why the release notes were kept a secret until servers were down... to prevent mass duping/selloffs/ before hand
---
Nice! I'll try it then. I thought minimum RAM used was 4gb no matter the settings. Thanks for the info.
---
Think that first and foremost, I‚Äôd love to see some Responder-themed items made available in game. I would especially love to have a Responder signage set so that I can make my C.A.M.P. look like a proper resupply stop. Aside from that, I would very much like to see ‚Äúclutter collections‚Äù based around different themes to decorate our C.A.M.P.S., as well as desktop computer terminals like the ones found out around the world.
---
I've had a Player destroy it once, when I used to leave it outside for passerby to use it, and it's currently half dead thanks to mole rats tunneling into my base and targeting it. 
---
Always....I have just accepted it, uninstalled, and moved on.
---
I agree it is a problem being able to 1 shot everything but SBQ it takes the fun out of the game but that character just farms the queen now after I've done all the quest etc.
---
 I've made a second character that uses guns not even TSE and I'm having more fun with the game, built a non auto rifle stealth build, hunting rifle handmade etc max damage with those was 270 but it's more enjoyable, tougher enemies actually feel more difficult.
---
Yeah, I went for convenience, which hasn't paid off several times. I just don't want to struggle with it at all tbh.
---
Do you use a console? Either way it should work, im just unsure on settings and stuff
---
Oh come on, balance was way off whack. It's still unbalanced in areas but less so than yesterday.
---
Xbox too :)
---
I like having shittons of everything so i never have to worry about repairing or crafting. Have 300 screws and use up some to craft mininukes or something. Now I have let‚Äôs say 200 screws. I see that and go ‚Äúoh no I‚Äôm running ‚Äú‚Äùlow‚Äù‚Äù I should go get more so I don‚Äôt get even lower since the game eats up resources so quickly‚Äù it also depends on what build you‚Äôre using though/weapons. Fatman and missile launchers don‚Äôt last long. But basically take that mindset and apply it to most other resources that are needed in repair and crafting. 
---
Because there should be different ways to viably create your character and play the game. Not everyone should be funnelled like that. What‚Äôs the point of having 50 different legendary effects if you‚Äôre only going to use 2? 
---
I use perks that allow me to stay in vats longer, fill crit every other shot at worst, but it‚Äôs just not fun when my well thought out build still makes my character seem like a joke compared to bloodied + unyielding.
---
Everybody go melee. Then they will nerf that also
---
Gotta save this one, thanks!
---
Have you noticed that slowly this sub reddit, once fierce defender of Bethesda is becoming more and more tired of their fuck ups?
---
These nerfs have the sole purpose of making the game even more grindier by making us farm and farm and farm for repairs.

---
No need to riot
---
First, I do agree that this will cause at least some balance issue, but more so from the meta-chasing mindset than anything else.  So, don't take this as a blatant argument AGAINST your post, I do think there is some validity in itand , I understand the principal of the argument here, but in a game with mixed ranged/melee there are some stark disadvantages and risks to melee.  1) all enemies with ranged attacks can also melee you (some not very strong, but still) 2) many enemies DON'T have ranged attacks making them nothing more than target practice for ranged players 3) it takes time and received damage to close the gap to use melee 4) when using ranged attacks you can keep ALL enemies in front of you with the proper tactics, very hard when straight melee.
---
I agree they basically devalued tse guns, they take out whats good in the game so theres essentially nothing to stive for
---
I'm on Xbox as well. I guess I've just gotten lucky haha
---
&gt;maybe bethesda wants to steer the game away from being completeable in under 1 month by power gamers?
---
It's only like that because quests aren't locked behind each other. Start of game, you can immediately go over and start the Brotherhood quest line. You don't have to do any of the responders quests. 
---
Oh my god that Kill Laugh Love sign is fucking incredible, I‚Äôm sold. And the MOTHMAN STUFF! Fuck yes, now THIS is good Atom Shop content.
---
Agreed on that, maybe the limit could have been a little higher than 1500. Perhaps this will pave the way for vendor bots at camps? 
---
That‚Äôs not the point, two shot is supposed to be two shots. If you want to rebalance it, make it consume 2 ammo per shot, make it have double recoil. They shouldn‚Äôt just drop the damage by 80% and call it a fuckin day just because it‚Äôs strong. It wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue In the first place if people weren‚Äôt breaking into the dev room to sell OP guns
---
You sir are a mvp
---
After looking at the Major Modifiers.... your right wtf. 
---
Maybe Bethesda should come out west to Lawrence Livermore National Labs where there exists the most powerful laser in the history of humanity and ask them how many shots they get out of it before they have to repair it. The labs are pretty good with stuff like that, they let Abrams film Star Trek in there.
---
Pfft brother on another platform is all!  
---
The Prefix - Major - Minor is the breakdown, and some of the Prefix's should be "Majors" and Explosive should have always been a Prefix and not a Major.
---
I immediately noticed this (xbox one). 
---
You can have up to 4 characters, right?
---
So my guass rifle dropped from 750 to 240 damage. The game is fun again?? Gonna probably respec melee until they nerf that into the ground too, then I dunno how people will play this game. 
---
Cool! So even if someone kill your pet, just a quick server hop brings it back?
---
Yeah we got her past the first heal, which was a struggle, and then her health stopped at about 75% too.
---
Bet u use melee you fucking assrat. Or playing just enjoying spending hours if farming ammo
---
Get over yourself perhaps and don't dictate to us what we can and can't be concerned about. 
---
We are all staring intently at this *screen* and unnecessary intrusions that are out of the control of the player should be kept to a minimum, you may be into PVP so this will be of interest to you, but others have no interest in PVP regardless of how much we are whined at to *get with the game* and do what PVP lovers want.
---
i couldnt one shot things with my tse 50 cal machine gun. i could kill them in maybe twenty shots instead of 200
---
True. I do have 2 stars in sneak and have chameleon armor though.  Maybe I need more levels in sneak. But even then I'm not sure I could stay in sneak with a mob 2 feet away from me,kill them one by one and not be seen. Or maybe you can,I could be wrong. 
---
You mean, 10-12 times to find an UNBROKEN build.
---
Dead? You can equip that canibal perk for food and just drink water from a fountain
---
i would like that more too
---
We should probably tell devs that they don't have to paint everything with vivid pink and acidic yellow. Not all of us are colorblind. 
---
You're cooking with too much SALT.
---
that's not the point. I spent countless hours and materials to get all the mods on it and now it's a worthless weapon
---
This. This is great.
---
I seriously doubt they thought that far ahead. That would be an improvement that doesn't make the game grindier. Dollars to donuts scorchbeast loot is the same trash, it just now will take many more thousands of bullets to get it
---
Oh trust me, I get downvoted to hell a lot.  Like nobody liked my idea of having a mutation that gives you a huge ass but does nothing else.
---
Even though it's one of the greatest ideas in the history of gaming.
---
It may not be used much currently but this is clearly an attempt to up its use so the original response is silly. You are using old information to assume a future out come. 
---
I lock my main building door and I have a tent outside of my building with stations and a stash for random people passing by.
---
It's up!!!!!
---
Ouch that hurts! Nah I‚Äôm a heavy gunner 
---
id rather have them nerf all enemys health instead actually
---
Awesome! I wish I'd taken more pictures in the beginning, especially before I left the Vault! 
---
Handmade went from 528 down to 148
---
they could've nerfed TSEs without making them near useless
---
Idk maybe my armor wasn‚Äôt where it needed to be then because I tried fireproof and dense before and one shotted myself with a tse shotgun many times
---
Me too, stuck at 9 of 10 for two months almost.  Level 39 now, got the quest around level 7 I think, it's ridiculous.
---
A fucking stupid one in that case
---
MOST SAVAGE REPLY EVER. Lol!
---
I don't understand the logic for requesting ANY nerfs.... Nerf city doesn't make the game more playable. All it does is aggravate more people.
---
Expecting anything with Bethesda is probably a mistake ; )
---
LOL this shit is so sad it's funny, but not.
---
Pass it along lmao, what is going on with you Bethesda? Its been two months of stupid nerfs, give us some real balance and some real updates 
---
Exactly! Thank you for that insight as it's what I was just thinking a moment ago. :D 
---
I like this idea for pallets of resources, it‚Äôd be kinda cool to put pallets of wood or drums of adhesive in certain camp locations, like in the garages that a lot of players have. 
---
You‚Äôre also right that it seems like it should be easy to make these items cost and scrap for the same amount. Like a pallet of concrete bags that costs 100x concrete and like 5x wood and 5x plastic and scraps for 100x concrete and like 1x wood/plastic.
---
Yeah I got that, what I said was that IF the explosive nerf will effect the Sonic Blasts, you may have stumbled across an ACTUAL positive thing that comes with this patch.
---
I m getting a case of infinite loading screen bit that s a start
---
90% reduced weight and it's still almost 8 pounds?
---
The griefers will now kill you with instigating or bloodied weapons. When you see a player with low health coming at you , run or log out lol
---
I thought that was old unsubstantiated rumor. Do you know if it was ever confirmed? I mean, I recall chucking grenades at her and seeing the little gray tick of her health bar go down a visible amount, a bit more than I would while using other weapons. 
---
No one asked for about 75% of the head-scratching nerds si far, but yet here we are.
---
Well to be fair, it marks these people, right? Only an uneducated buffoon who wants to show just how clueless he or she is about Fallout 76 will throw out this term "Duper!!" (like they just won a prize at a carnival that cost half as much as the ticket they just bought) and then you'll be safe in the knowledge that you're in the presence of an idiot.
---
Sure, I'll take a look, I'm online concerned because my internet at home is crap, 3.5GB to download after getting home means I will not play today, so I'm hoping the launcher being open is enough to trigger the update.
---
Bless you gentlemen
---
I AGREE
---
Can you post what you can see there? Im at work but I'm.very interested to see what plans are available
---
That's Bethesda maths at work my friend...:-)
---
Well there goes 10 pounds I'm not going to bother carrying anymore.
---
Never said laser.  I'm old school, but that knowledge is first hand.
---
Night vision is another story too, but as far as lights at night go, it's red.
---
"I found them and liked it when nobody else had them because I could sell them."
---
They stack in your inventory list. How do you know how they stack in memory?
---
Or that if you change servers you can no longer do some of them like ecological balance. 
---
All we need for this to happen are dedicated servers and mods. Hope exists,, I guess.
---
This is what baffles me. They also announced a nerf three weeks ago, so we had time to prepare and adjust. This was necessary to rebalance the game 
---
So its weird; I went to Grafton as soon as the servers came up.  Vendor Bot Greg seems to have all the Excavator Plans and the Train Station Vendor had the Lever Action and Leather Armor sets.
---
Noteably, though, neither of them had the Shadowed Leather mod, which they used to sell.  I am not sure if this means all vendors are different now and each contains their own bit of unique plans or if the level cap is still on, so once you hit a certain plateau the plans are no longer available.
---
Instead of owning responsibility for leaking items, specifically TSE weapons out of our god room that people somehow got into, we‚Äôre just gonna nerf all the best shit in the game to the ground to spite cheaters. Screw you all people who got lucky and found one of those legitimately, screw you straight to hell because some other people cheated
---
They are popular because of legendary effects.... this would be a normal one, no more powerful than the puncturing fire axe.  Just a different look.
---
So that'd explain the time I was farming aid boxes and doctor bags and that crate opened with like 20 stimpaks in it
---
Yeah I know I don't have the luxury of doing that.... I need the extra DPS. Like I'm running a glass cannon build. I run only end game content and some PVPING. Without those perks I'm hindering myself significantly or removing my ability to stagger Sentinel/Assassin builds. 
---
And the ones that weren't broken before the patch that are broken now?
---
No I think they made up for it by making most of their stuff useless they duped and having them waist their Caps on plans nownthat are stupid expensive like 5520 for power armor chest plans which were 1100 before
---
No they nerfed tse weapons because they were insanely overpowered compared to other weapons. Melee weapons are still very powerful.
---
What‚Äôs broken now?
---
100% agree. It is not fun to have to shoot something more than 3 times before it dies. Bullet sponge enemies need to be addressed if they are going to make every gun into trash.
---
Thanks, it was fun while it lasted...
---
U/Ladydevann or u/valseek
---
Can you find out if they are looking into rebalancing enemy health pools and the SBQ mechanics, or are we just gonna be stuck with marshmallow guns and super sledges/grognaks axes?
---
Oh hell no!!! Let the new crybabies influence Bethesda just like the last group.  I mean mob mentality rules right?
---
Bloody weapon, unyielding armor.
---
No!  Guns no longer have range!  There, all equal!
---
I can still one shit everything
---
They‚Äôre likely stacking because the max durability values are the same. Even random drops of the same weapon with the same legendary effect and mods don‚Äôt stack because the max durability value is random. 
---
was the x01 jetpack in the whitesprings bunker? ive been looking for one for weeks
---
My handmade rifle not-having self awaits an update with bated breath.
---
Yea I agree this nerf is too much as it affects weapons with only one or the other attribute as well. My two shots are garage now. I grinded so long. 
---
Saammeee!!! :-D
---
This was never a "proper MMO" to begin with. Most MMOs have larger player counts in a single map instance than this game has across its one map.
---
My double barrel was at 1200. I'm.very worried 
---
do any other perks increase the damage? 
---
Thank you for everything in this patch! 
---
Super excited for wall plans to be sprinkled in random vendors now. I‚Äôve played probably 60-70 hours and haven‚Äôt found a single wall plan. 
---
As a guy with 15 Endurance, who usually pumps up Endurance in Fallout, here are my thoughts and some of my favorite Endurance perks:
---
Lead Belly is actually a pretty decent perk to take in the early game, before you gain access to stronger perks to replace it with. This probably isn't very practical, but it also turns Ionized Meat and Inert Flux from nuke zones into all-around convenient snacks.
---
Rejuvenated is a terrific perk, do not sleep on this one. Staying Well Fed &amp; Well Hydrated is easy, and with this maxed out it's a cool +50 HP, +50 AP Regen, and +70 disease resistance.
---
People have sung the praises of Good Doggy, but don't forget that Cola Nut makes Nuka Cola *amazing*. Another perk you shouldn't underestimate. 120 HP and a ton of restored thirst from Nuka Cola, which is hella common? 300 HP from Nuka Cherry? 600 HP from Quantum!? Hell yeah.
---
And I'm a huge fan of Sun Kissed and Photosynthetic, the perks that, respectively, remove rads and restore health in sunlight. RadAway is common enough but I hate carrying the damn things, and with Sun Kissed I only ever need RadAway for nuke zones or in the rare case I'm fighting a bunch of Glowing Ones... at night. Photosynthetic isn't as useful, but it's the fastest health regen unless you're stacking Rejuvenating legendary armor. 
---
I think the health gains from Endurance and Life Giver are fine; remember that you don't gain more health just from leveling in this game, so raising your END is the only way to permanently increase your max health. But it's hard to make a real judgment unless I played a low END character and a high END character back-to-back and compared the experience. If I had to buff anything, I'd make Life Giver cost 1-2-3 instead of 2-3-4, and add another small bonus to base END like passive radiation or disease resistance.
---
The fact it was as OP as it was before now was the mistake imo. We're just reacting badly to it because we're used to it being so OP. Compared to perks with similar effects like Power Patcher (PA still costly to repair at rank 3) l, gunsmith (only 50% more durability, no cheaper repair), and plumber (less useful items effected, much more unnecessary nerf than white knight tbh), it was ridiculously good. I'm in favor of the change even though I acknowledge that it will make maintaining armor more annoying.
---
So it's not the end of the world?
---
damage on my tse gauss went from 1.4k damage to 300. cant even one shot a level 50 wolf
---
Looks like sneak attacks and sniper builds are going to become relevant again with that \~61% reduction in damage.  
---
My shotgun was \~1000 damage so it being the mid-4's range will be on par with my melee all-rise when just using 15 strength and max melee perks (without unyielding or adrenaline) so that seems to bring an element of fairness back between the two weapon strategy types.  For snipers though not sure how balanced that will be though unless your using a TSE gauss/dragon/harpoon maybe as those should still hit at least at a 1000.  
---
I will miss 1-shotting everything but it was fun while it lasted and can now refocus on more balanced fighting and getting used to that.
---
They have officially pushed me out of the game. 
---
Perk nerfing, XP nerfing and the final draw is white night nerf. Making an already overly grinding game more so.. it‚Äôs ridiculous.. 
---
Instead of reducing the combination of TSE  they have rendered all my guns useless, most of which are simple two shots. They also made my explosive build completely useless. Grenades fat man and missile launchers are all but useless. 
---
If your not a melee build this game sucks ass now.
---
Ok, it seems to work, it already downloaded the update, something like 750MB, weird.
---
Yea but everything else is so weak they never buff anything 
---
Demo should be a 3-star card instead of 5-star. 
---
Drill speed now requires fusion cores for power.
---
And I will miss my 2 shot gattling gun. With only 2 levels in heavy gunner that gun was great. A hit of overdrive helped.
---
Or just keep her on the F***ING map
---
lol, ok :p I'm sure you're a deep and complex pool of mystery, and today you had the opportunity to express that depth to the community
---
Exactly! So the legendary effect is still valuable? I‚Äôve been hearing they ruined the guns entirely üôÑ
---
Anything ts that wasn't explosive, as well as plain explosive weapons like the grenade launchers and rocket launchers.
---
I have at least one T-60 calib shock Mod I could sell you for what I paid, 420 caps. 
---
I use a pair of T-60 legs with my X-01‚Äî I have no idea how people get the X-01 plans or mod. 
---
Recently, I‚Äôve noticed the mod for sale in Watoga train station and Watogo shopping mart. 
---
my ign is astro13
---
I legit killed SBQ in less than 10 melee hits on my main lol
---
/r/hailcorporate
---
Pretend hes not wrong. Look what every player does all day every day over level 75. Farm legendaries. Playing a shitty boring lottery where 1 in every 1000 kills gets you a fairly decent weapon. Except now they just nerfed those weapons too. So whats the point?
---
A subjective difference. A difference defined by the person reading, not the person posting. What I post thinking I'm being constructive, you might see as a hate post.
---
&gt;"If you want to complain, please quit and move on! Im sick of all the downers on this sub. If you're here complaining, then your playing...why?"
---
Only if you are creating something, and you have a mod/scrap that has that useful component in there.
---
I had a mod for machete, and it scraps for 2 plastic, and 1 steel. I had over 100 plastic, not bulked in my stash, and it still tried to use the mod instead.
---
The thing is, that other games don't need to have top posts on their subreddits assuring people that they are still having fun playing... Go onto r/rdr2, how many posts on there are simply people saying "This game is fun! Right? Rightttt?!?!"? How about r/fortnite?
---
I defended this game before release because the hate for it was beyond belief for absolutely no reason. I defended this sub, because I understood people here were just trying to make the best of the game and just wanted to enjoy it. But honestly, I haven't played this game since sometime in November. I've tried to boot it up a few times and always end up quitting within five minutes. Unless something major has changed in that time, I just don't think this game Is going to grab me, unfortunately.
---
Its fine I don't really like it and some of the people here really do, but the fact posts like yours are littering this sub every time I come here kind of makes it seem like some of you guys are in denial. I've never seen so many posts from people trying to reassure themselves that they're still having fun.
---
Bobby pins weigh alot again. 
---
No it's absolutely necessary because otherwise taking White Knight was a no-brainer. 
---
With that said, they should increase the durability of all armors / the damage of all grenades.
---
As a melee player, I revel in going back to being on top. Although you have my sympathy for your loss.
---
Ewww I was expecting it to reach 73 after patch but that nasty perk nerf killed it a bit more then I thought, I was exptecting to still be able to use it after patch looks like I‚Äôm going full melee
---
I think he means mine, but the servers are still down last time I checked.
---
u/ladydevann there are some legit gripes in this thread concerning the demolition expert nerf. If y‚Äôall feel it needs to cap at 60 then that I‚Äôd reasonable. What is unreasonable is keeping it as a 5 level perk card. Investing FIVE points for such a weak bonus is just not realistic. Make it 20/40/60 and only three levels and let‚Äôs move on. Considering you also nerfed explosive legendary damage the additional perk nerf really doesn‚Äôt seem necessary. Grenades are expensive as shit to craft as it is, they are supposed to be powerful. 
---
True but still doesn't negate the fact that if you have to get up close and personal, it will put you at a disadvantage to taking damage. Many guns in the game do more damage the closer you get. Melee can't just jump onto a building and still do damage, while taking very little.
---
Miniguns and Gatling lasers are currently some of the best explosive weapons in the game due to the way that the Grenadier perk works with Bloody Mess and Demolitions Expert, even better when stacked with the Heavy Weapons specific perks.   
---
Complain less, learn to fix your build more. 
---
&gt; And to head things off: I've worked in QA
---
Thank you. It's refreshing to occasionally get someone who knows what they're talking about.
---
Have a friend in the server.   Or use two different accounts.  
---
I'm missing weapons as well 
---
yeah, i'm just about done. i have around 20 locations left to fully explore, and once that's over with, i'll have depleted pretty much all the content the game has to offer. i usually love playing alts, but i've been holding out for builds that have yet to even be touched (energy weapons! flamer!) and i'm fucking tired of waiting. my unarmed character just got fucked for armor, and i was in the middle of leveling a grenade launcher character whose damage just got fucked because they decided they had no choice but to penalize all explosives for their own TSE fuckup.
---
i'm over it. if the vaults don't come next month, i'll come back in a year or two.
---
And that's why I played this so simple. It's all starting to make sense.
---
So just for clarification is it just the explosive radius damage being reduced to 20% or is it all explosive damage.  I've farmed for quite some time and have gotten a few 2shot weapons and 2 one shot explosive shotguns.  I gave one to a lol 50ish guy and kept my soooooper long reload 32 round pump action. After spending all this time farming I won't lie this pisses me off.  How bout making other weapons better.
---
Nah I mean like "cowboy/girl: bonus damage with lever action rifles, non-combat shotguns and revolvers, bonus dt/dr for wearing a cowboy outfit" plus other perk cards and effects that could get people role-playing. Maybe some cards buff each other, or equipping other cards buff or nerfs your potential build. 
---
It would at least make anything other than melee viable unlike it is now...
---
Not to mention they said they didnt want white knight and the like to be necessary, but nerfing them doesn't make them un necessary. They are still absolutly needed, but now they are just worse. Makes no sense. 
---
You have no idea if its a minority. You cant go by that 5% stat that was posted on this sub. PvP is so discouraged, that PvP players dont PvP. Even freaking Minecraft has better PvP than FO76 at the moment, this is so much wasted potential.
---
Many players dont even know about the HvH mode or how to activate it. It has been a hidden opt-in option so far, and this has failed. Giving it more exposure will hopefully make more players aware that this exists. I predict some people posting threads on this sub about the *new PvP mode* Bethesda added to the game because they didnt know about it before.
---
At best Bethesda could make the announcement opt-out in the future. But this game lives on player interaction. Its the point the game was made. And its a great step that Bethesda wants to use all possible interactions as game play now. 
---
Yea ive never seen the handmade plans due to my level.
---
how much do you want to bet they didnt change the SBQ loot tables so the PA plans still drop in one of the 3 plan slots. 500 hrs and ive completed 3-4 ultracite sets and given them away, still only have 4-5 non-Vent mods unlocked and no helmet mod yet. Going to be shitty if her loot table is unchanged and 2 of the 3 plans will almost always be garbage.
---
of course not, no therapists
---
thinking I‚Äôll start attending a local grief counseling group tho 
---
Servers are back online!
---
Let me sum up your post in one word.
---
"WAAAAAAHHHHHH"
---
Pretty sure somebody set up a bot to auto downvote all new posts. Also, I could finally delete that industrial water purifier. Sorry about your camp loss (holds hat and bows head).
---
I can understand that - been on the unintended receiving end of such changes in the past myself.  Its the unfortunately reality given the amount of variables in an online game, but change will always occur, and some of them aren't always pleasant.
---
They did A LOT of very questionable and unneeded nerfs this patch that are going to ruin some people‚Äôs characters. If you were one of the lucky few who ground out a TSE gun and found one legitimately, not only can you not use it now because it‚Äôs basically garbage compared to other legendary effects, all that time spent grinding was now just thrown down the garbage. White knight wasn‚Äôt a problem, crafting costs and scarcity of materials is a problem. People aren‚Äôt gonna be able to enjoy the greater world around them if they‚Äôre always knit picking for scrap. And I didn‚Äôt see a single buff to weak weapon classes, or any enemy nerfs. You can‚Äôt just underpower players, you have to BALANCE weapons and perks, meaning they all have nearly the same relative power. Their balance team isn‚Äôt quite on it‚Äôs A game here
---
feel your pain 
---
Almost everyone in the game is running with 15 in strength. Melee, shotguns, or if you want to be able to pick up your weapons and a few clipboards at the same time, all of them need strength.

"I can reproduce this bug but it takes 40 steps and 25 minutes, and I have 7000 more bugs to check "  "Ship it."

"Hue hue hue did anyone QA this?"
---
Anytime, but I'll warn you, the way it's set up if other people are wearing the Targeting HUD there is an Area effect it spreads from, so you can still get the effect, and still CTD, but not wearing it had dozens and dozens of people reporting going from 5 CTD's an hour to a couple a night.  
---
Still waiting on Bethesda to respond however.
---
Oh wow, that's supremely stupid.
---
I love this but it will not stop people holding millions of pounds of gear, on XBox you can simply flag your XBox as a home XBox and create multiple free XBox accounts and then use the game for free on that XBox.  So whats stopping someone with 2 XBox's flagging one as a Home XBox and using the dummy accounts on that XBox, and use there main account of the other XBox.  While I love that they are trying to fix things all this has done is make it slightly harder
---
My only other thought is someone else nearby shooting you from a sniper position. 
---
Out of curiosity how did they respond?
---
 Costs way more than that lol
---
I dont remember a single thing actually getting buffed yet in all their patches
---
No, they are not. Only empty shells of what they used to be.
---
Then why didn't they do anything about melee builds? I can still one shot everything without spending any ammo. I Just think it's boring using 2000 rounds to take down a scorchbeast with no other mechanic than flying and landing
---
Thanks. Yeah photo mode is da bomb. 
---
True but I'd rather struggle to kill her or fail to kill her rather than almost kill her and the she just decides to fly off the bottom of the map.
---
Maybe make any TSE weapon do no damage so they scrap them all then bring in a sensible version of TSE üòÅ
---
That‚Äôs cool man, and good on you for being that dude.  I typically craft high level melee weapons and armor and craft excavator armor for people having trouble find those mats.  I also like to build upgraded under armor for people with my flux.
---
I also typically go through a couple hundred pounds per night, but that‚Äôs mostly a result of selling bulked junk to vendors after I‚Äôve already sold the assault and combat rifles I pick up from enemies and still have more caps to collect.
---
I just don‚Äôt really have any issues finding or carrying the weight I use on a regular basis.
---
I'm torn... happy cause I don't have to grind anymore... but... sad cause of the time I have... and is this easy mode? 
---
So conflicted. lol

---
Every day at work I check the sub to see if any actual content has been added to the game. I'm glad they are squashing bugs and fixing exploits but I think people are starting to move on. I finished my desired gear set a month ago, my ideal weapons dropped before I even hit 50, I built my little retreat out in the woods, and now the only thing left for me to do is maybe get the specific mods I want on my power armor or farm the queen for rare plans, which I still get disconnected from occasionally so I don't want to put any energy into that.
---
Please add something real to do sooner rather than later, I can see myself giving the PvP server a shot as some kind of softcore Rust action but even PvP gets boring eventually. 
---
That one is a scripted spawn so it won‚Äôt work. [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjj4qHNxpPgAhVq5YMKHQlUDNMQzPwBegQIARAD&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffo76%2Fcomments%2Fa509c9%2Frandom_encounter_location_map%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3jBiTKxYCByoKWVWb6mVrE&amp;ust=1548870559461360) is the map I used to scrub spawns. I just kept checking the one near Harper‚Äôs Ferry and reloading. 
---
I get the Mantaman being a little much, but I really love them all because it's all ingame lore and references to the universe, which i absolutely love
---
This right here foe me. I have an explosives build. I love blowing shit up. The nerf is gonna hurt me. And I feel the same about guns. In all other FO games I played I cherished my guns. Now with "All Rise" and other good melee weapons,my guns are just a back up. 
---
HvH should have been implemented as queue and players could be located on a server with other players looking to participate. 
---
Eh that combo really just impacts shotguns significantly - melee users across the board get to double dip in strength by it increasing damage done - having perception boost gun damage would at least makes guns not total trash. I can easily get 2400-3k damage with super sledge but I prefer to play with guns. :[ 
---
I don't follow, could you explain?
---
Nope. I'm good with the nerf! Now more fun.
---
So your OP weapon is now balanced to not be 10x the dmg of other legendaries? Wow...
---
I've been more than 500lbs over just from collecting all the equipment in a gym to scrap for lead...
---
Yeah that's pretty soul crushing.
---
Negativity without constructive criticism is pretty obvious.
---
Play RDR2 first, get through the story, will take you some time, and then you can check in and see if more has been tweaked with this game. However, yes, it's worth bothering with and fun and a lot of hours of gameplay even with the imperfections and not partaking in real endgame more than once or twice. 
---
You find it fun that tse weapons.were so op that all the other legendary effects were useless? You find it fun to 1-shot everything? You are the clueless one
---
I have a TSE handmade that I use and I'm glad with this nerf.  A TSE handmade should NOT hit harder than a maxed out melee all-rise per bullet (my melee specked char hits only around 450).  This really does level the playing field for PvP a bit more assuming no janky thing is found (which will probably happen).  But I think it's a good first step to rebalance PvP.    With a spray type gun like an assault rifle you SHOULD need to spray bullets into an enemy to bring them down.  
---
A shotty/gauss/harpoon etc should still hit for \~450 plus sneak buffs still apply and armor perks.  This will make PvP actually more interesting than who gets the 1st shot off. 
---
Actually I haven't used a TSE weapon in over a month and don't miss it.  
---
The way I interpret the patch notes is that the base plans ie torso,arms and legs will be at fort defiance. All upgrades to this armor would still have to be acquired from farming the queen
---
That's good, just wanted to be sure :)
---
I am actually finding the opposite, but that could be because im not going through quests constantly. Nearly level 20, but ive played a fair few hours over the past few weeks.
---
I like the camp stuff most (F4 i fully built every settlement to the edge of their modded extended borders) but sadly i either have no budget, or have no plans, and cant afford new ones.
---
Nerfs and buffs are part of the cycle of any online game - anything is fair game.  The brilliance I'm seeing here is that the devs seem to actually show some understanding of the mechanics of the game and are actually addressing over exploited crutches people are using.  The game is getting its balance changes, but this is one time I'm actually excited to see them.  And what I'm seeing is more than fair, given how broken some of the initial values were set at.
---
new stairs that have no matching railings so your upper levels will still look dumb as hell

You should have asked everyone to "guess the item" - I've scrapped a dozen "Assassin" armour pieces. Absolute trash lol

"barley surviving"? Is English your first language?
---
Let's see, Andromeda sold at this price, had plenty of bugs, the eyes that weren't realistic.. people complained at first, people reacted like they did to this game at first- but in the end they didn't cry and whine nonstop.. haters just eventually shut up.
---
Then there's ark survival evolved, also sold for 60 bucks, even though PC players were quite clear about how the game isn't out of beta stage plenty still bought it. Even though it's just a sandbox with no quests, dialogue, story, or anything to do- with a much smaller world, no lore.. really a shit game I never would have played if a buddy didn't buy it for me on PC. 
---
There's plenty of games like that though, 7 days to die, blah blah.. you can say "but Bethesda!" The real idea is that you can't argue those games are worth $60 and this game isn't. Especially not when they've hammered out 75% of the biggest bugs that effected the most players within 30 days.
---
It's fallout with friends, it's including all future dlc for free, it's got lore and stories if you explore and look for it. It isn't perfect but it's getting better every day. I don't expect perfection. I don't care if others paid less for it, it just means I have more people to play it with.
---
I'm no fan boy, I simply didn't expect perfection in any way. I see plenty of shit games I wouldn't touch for $60, but I don't go around calling people fan boys if *they do*. 
---
You're basically just being an ass. If you don't like the state of the game, either come back later, or sell your copy on eBay. If you got digital, stop buying digital games unless you're sure you will be happy with it.
---
But sticking around trying to invalidate the opinions of others is just a dick move. Having too many issues? Rebuild your database, my friends did that and it fixed the only issues they were having. It takes less than 5 minutes. But quit crying, quit whining, and quit trying to drag everyone else into your negative bullshit.
---
Today's patch might help if you're still having problems:

&gt; Performance: On laptops with more than one graphics card, Fallout 76 will now default to using the dedicated graphics card rather than an integrated card.

Sorry dont kno how to do that on mobile but they sell every mod plan from t-45-t-60
---
Yep, I'm all about a warehouse you can glance at and see your hoard of each loose type or whatever. Or a vault full of pallets of gold.
---
The only one that comes to mind is that they reduced the repair cost (maybe just in terms of ballistic fiber) for armor, but they kind of negated that with this one.
---
I tried this once, and the person did a thumbs down and didn't take anything. :( I was just trying to get rid of stuff and she didn't want anything.
---
608 hours played.......... i cant stop someone help me! @Ladydevann :) 
---
The servers still aren't up almost 4 hrs later...
---
It really is it's happend that much now I'm not nuking fissure prime and just trying random places.
---
being addicted to a game is not a virtue or an argument
---
The weight reduction only affects the base gun. Weapon mods are not effected by the reduced weight effect
---
Would you mind sharing your build? I'm trying to do something similar, just wanted some pointers
---
Even so, legally, Bethesda cannot include, wholesale, unofficial patches that might fix these things, because they dont have copyright to the fixes.
---
They would need to reverse engineer the fix and do a cleanroom version, which takes forever.
---
In addition, many "fixes" require the script extender, which is a hack that Bethesda, again, cannot just build in wholesale but must reverse engineer.
---
This is Betheda's first attempt at a synchronized world.  If you duplicate a trillion lock picks in Skyrim, the only game experience you ruin is your own, and the only game you crash is your own.
---
Bethesda needs to fix these exploits, yes.  But people think it's as easy as YHVH saying "LET THERE BE BUG FIXES."  Just look at the changelogs... they are running full out.
---
The point of my comment is that it's harder than the "hue hue hue" crowd thinks it is, and developers and QA have to live in the same space/time continuum we do; they dont get extra hours every day.
---
and in that teeny, tiny watch are teeny, tiny springs and you need 40 of them to make a leg of PA LOL
---
I havent seen any of these plans before. Were they always this expensive?
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Is there a fix for the Gatling Laser not loading the correct ammo count? Every time I want to use the GL, it displays the number of Fusion Cores I am currently holding and not the amount of rounds ready to fire. Thanks.
---
I just had cheddar broccoli for the first time yesterday with my friend who i might fancy at corner bakery. Is this a sign? She doesnt eat bacon so she gave me her strips from her sandwhich and i crumbled them into my cheddar brocolli soup and it was the best thing ever!
---
Oh trust me, the perk nerf is sorta confusing, but hearing people complain nonstop about something we‚Äôve known was coming in some fashion is extremely annoying. 
---
608 hours and counting.......... i cant stop.... HELP :p 
---
I'd really like to see the PC changing audio device repaired.  I'd like to switch between surround and headset without exiting the game.
---
Umm - thanking them for screwing up the game even more, removing all the good damage guns, adding PVP before \*ANY\* new PVE content what-so-ever, changing tons of perks without a way to respect, and repeatedly not listening to any input relating to added content? If you appreciate that then, IDK what to do tell you
---
I think your good now.  Guns that were 950 damage before and now 140 or so.  Meanwhile an Axe can stack damage over 1000+
---
i just logged out but it was somewhere around 1500. they raised some plan costs, i noticed the t51 mod parks were thousands. the jetpack was like \~6k caps!
---
Damn near brings a tear to my eye.
---
yes just bought it!
---
3300 caps before
---
haha Bethesda and maths.
---
It's amazing that a team of coders never thought about this, truly amazing when you think about what it implies :(
---
Theyve already acknowledged they're working on it for next patch
---
That doesn't even count for bear arms working on it. Riflemen perks are what modify  its damage. And it's under heavy weapons while crafting lol. It's got identity issues.
---
it's not useless, it's probably still way better than most other legendaries, cry me a river
---
It's up now
---
especially because it already recognizes the multiples. 
---
luckily, having 1, 2, and 3 variants works.
---
maybe it can be done having 2x rank 1 cards and somehow it boosts just one, then forces that card to rank up but then u have a useless perk card u have to scroll over every time u swap.
---
The in game respec takes time as you said, its not a free pass you have to work towards your changes/respec.  Whiners are those who want everything for free, and don't want to put any effort into stuff.  These same people are the ones who just gravitated towards overused broken builds and are crying now that their OP builds are going to be more in line with others.
---
&gt;orkable as well. Different color walls that you can paint or you can apply wallpaper to, working mirrors(they ar
---
I'd pay handsomely for a bundle of sloth-themed goodies. I'd pay even more handsomely if I could buy them in such a way that a portion of the proceeds went to the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica ;)
---
They were never there. The new update makes all vendors sell all of their possible plans. Modus plans are new to being in a shop they normally only drop from SBQ
---
Really? Wtf?
---
They announced a nerf after nerfing XP/leveling...
---
Cunts... Pure and simple
---
Nice. Thank you.
---
608 hours played and counting......... i cant stop....... HELP! XP
---
What a fuk did you just say to me u little sh*t 
---
It is literally useless now. Nerfing it is fine, but this was too big of a nerf, in my opinion.
---
Well there is one in HF on my server
---
Then it's likely that explosive weapons will have an overall buff later on.
---
TSE was obviously going - it was so fucking overpowered, even without stacking. To OD every single other build, with no additional risk.
---
Thank ya! 
---
Glorious Swedish Manufacturing 
---
maybe before purchase the plans i miss is better use all my maps...
---
Pretty much all power armor plans but ultracite and x01
---
She should still drop ultracite PA Mods (like explosive vents....or perhaps an even wider range of mods).  But the armor itself...if the MSQ is simply GIVING us a set of plans for it we really dont need the plans anymore as part of her loot.
---
I assure you...I am having fun. :)
---
It's really not but go off i guess
---
I agree. I also have a ton of time in on useless crap and wouldn't at all mind a wipe and just start again
---
Yes.  
---
In FO4 plasma was one of my favorite weapons. In FO76 I don't even bother. Same with all energy weapons. 
---
No. 
---
Thank you. He Who Walks Behind The Rows is pleased.
---
I have found in the wild all of 3 handmade rifles. I saved my first two until I found a lv 45 one to drop. I scrapped the other two and by shear luck, I got the hardened mod. I am lv 71 and my hardened handmade is still my primary. All my legendary weapon drops have been melee, so...
---
Super excited to find those damn plans and build a bunch of handmades and get the armor penetration mag!
---
T51B Calibrated Shocks, 6900 without Hard Bargain and 4 Charisma
---
I'm hundreds of hours in (not sure how many exactly) and have never seen Sentinel armor.
---
So just nerf everyone's progress because?
---
The only things that should bulk are lead and aluminum. Nothing else weighs less when bulked.
---
But thanks for the info, I‚Äôm scared of the new bugs today lol
---
Yes, exactly. Theyre completely focused on the wrong shit. Just like the new PvP mode. Shit. All these nerfs are centered around that. Shit.
---
some water, food, stimpacks, maybe some 38 &amp; 10mm ammo and away you go....
---
But I want to overreact because now my weapon does 1 damage and it takes an additional hit to kill something ü§™ 
---
what is AAE?
---
Yeah, but that's probably because it's new. Even in WoW... almost every patch needed updated mods reloaded before they would work again. It's just a thing. 
---
Yeah. I've got 2 of them on top of the one I learned. 
---
Lmao I can't imagine spending 5-10k caps on an OP gun only to have it nerfed weeks later. As a melee player, the TSE nerf is hilarious to me
---
There's definitely a balance to be had and you don't want stuff all the time but between my 2 friends and I, after over 200 hours of play the best we ever got was one Dragon and that was from the chest at the top of Fort Defiance (I think that's the BOS mansion, right?). All we ever got was shitty assassin crap with 6 damage reduction or something - never got any decent loot - we're done with the game now.
---
Saying that though, that applies to a PVE/single player game but Bethesda had to kick themselves in the nuts and pretend they knew about PVP gaming. Now it's a different game altogether because in a PVP game, you simply cannot have out balanced players. Name me a dedicated PVP game where one player has the only OP weapon running around one-shotting everyone - there isn't one.
---
So now, Bethesda are going to ruin the game even more by "balancing" something they have no clue about so PVP is fairer and will kill off the PVE experience like they're already doing. You cannot balance a PVP game with a PVE game but they're going to try it because they have no experience with PVP games and we can already see it happening now with the recent nerfs.
---
If you read some of the other comments below you will see that there are people who like to play this to a more comical play style so Bethesda is opting to humor more then seriousness.
---
Ill double down on that bet
---
Worst patch for me, I dont use power armor so white knight being nerfed is rough. Finally legit found my first 3 star explosive 2 days ago and they nerf it into oblivion, gg
---
Oh yeah, I forgot I had that perk as well; White Knight, Demo Exp,.....Fix it Good &amp; Weapon Artisan will be on the hitlist soon and then it's almost all complete for PvP build, maybe get rid of FAST Combat Knives too and MEDIUM, maybe SuperSledge, Gauss Rifle, the whole Rifleman line, Commando line, whatev er the fuck the Shotgun line is.......
---
Oh, now I know what the Paddle Ball crafting thing is for at the Tinker's Bench, that's the new replacement for TSE and anything else good.....  I hope the little balls are hollow cause the solid ones will hurt

Wow. That is terrible 
---
I've been to Harper's Ferry every day for the last 2-3 weeks and haven't seen them. I've been wondering if I've been chasing a unicorn.
---
Look at that beefy detailed list. Look at all those bug-fixes. Oh baby. A month or two more food this and i might actually pick this bad boy up.
---
But if I get back and my ritual binding apparel is still not fixed I will not be a happy cultist.
---
Anti Armor Explosive new best in slot if you aren‚Äôt a bloodied build 
---
There is a lesson to be learned here in using your code version repository software properly.  If you publish a branch build, it becomes your new codebase.   "Version control software and how to use it" should be one of the most basic courses ever taught for programmers.
---
Also a melee player, and i paid 300 caps. You tried
---
Indeed, you may as well start using a standard combat shotgun, at least you won't get yourself damaged by your own shots. 
---
The instanced cap stashes now  make it so that the cap collector perk does nothingg

Get that a lot
---
Not really, not the one stars, but I get what you mean. I was so happy when I found my two shot combat shotgun.

The mothman stuff looks pretty, might actually use the atoms finally

I‚Äôm talking one that ain‚Äôt done by everyone every server you join

Anyone know how this interacts with undying?

And the price went up by like 300%, lol

you CANNOT kill a queen in 10 seconds no matter what you do. Plus the queen has a shitload of resistance against explosive weapons. 
---
This may be a huge hindrance on my mule that stored weapons and armors
---
This is genuinely one of the most exciting parts for me with this patch, small and unimportant as it may seem!
---
That‚Äôs a good point. If/when they nerd melee, people are going to freak out again like this lol
---
Because if they buff everything to be at the same level as bloodied + unyielding, the game would be WAY too easy. Would be a race between me and my buddies to see who can get to the 3* legendary mirelurk Queen first and breathe on her to death. Not everyone likes playing on easiest mode.
---
Omg i need both of those wth... 
---
No you!
---
&gt;This game's updates are   
---
&gt;glacially slow  
---
&gt;.
---
Person who has apparently never played any other game spotted.
---
So fuck the other 20% because ?
---
I m going to start over on the survival servers when they land, but ill prob leave 4 of my 5 toons on the adventure ones. Only 1 is over 100 the other don't need the levels really.
---
Just because someones over level 100, in your mind they are automatically bored with the game?
---
No, what im saying is these games are meant to be played how we want to play them, not how everyone else wants me to play them. Go play CoD or Fortnite, or whatever you little rascals like to fight over these days.
---
You bought it from someone who doesn't understand the fo76 economy then. Still though, too bad for you, TSE is so sad now, what a shame
---
Fuck yeah man!
---
Preach
---
My comment also assumes the systems they have in place now will make duping very hard to do/not get caught.  My perspective is more for the players that want to be actual vendors as that \~1700 lb stash limit is going to kill them.  
---
But if there are still other dupes that circumvent the system to be invisible to their dupe detection stuff then that's still a very core problem.  But this goes back to can't have nice things kinda thing so it'll be interesting to see how all these player vendors play out now as I like buying from them when I have the caps.  
---
I just picked up the Inspector costume. Gotta say I'm digging it so far!
---
Well if they attribute ridiculously overloaded characters to server stability.... then good riddance. 
---
Alright since everyone wants to jump on here and be an asshole: the nerf was absolutely necessary, however I personally feel that this was too big of a nerf. That's all. Thanks for coming to my ted talk
---
Does it make the grind kinda empty now? 
---
I want to try some new builds my Main is a Heavy Weapons, my Secondary is Melee Unyielding. Now I am thinking a pipe rifle (use both rifle and pistol cards) sniper build... What are you running?
---
I am lot talking about explosive.
---
I have been and it's not working
---
I had a similar problem and the culprit was blueprints. A large structure with everything in it was blueprinted but did not show the individual items in the stored tab. I deleted my blueprints and it cleared my storage problems. 
---
Yes, Jesus.  My Samsung keyboard not only shits the bed on autocorrects... but in Joey it also likes autocorrecting incorrectly after I choose the right word, switching out words back to the wrong autocorrect when I backspace, and sometimes autoincorrecting words in earlier parts of the sentence.
---
Not to mention there are two autocorrect systems arguing with each other (one in the keyboard itself and another in a dropdown under changed words, and rarely do they agree).
---
I try to backtrack to check everything when I post, but this combination of apps even likes autoincorrecting correct things I dont even touch when I fix other things.
---
Seriously, I had to fix multiple autoincorrects in this post, one of them twice.
---
I was trying out a explosive only build, tons of grenades, 40mm auto launcher, heavy weapons guy. I just logged off when my auto launcher could barely kill shit.
---
I had to grind so many levels to move over SPECIAL points to make this build viable and now I'm stuck with a useless build...
---
I don't really have it in me to grind more levels to revert my build back and at level 192 it will take a while to get the levels I need.
---
Yeah... I'm gonna take a break for a little bit, between the bugs and crashes and now my build becoming moot I don't have it in me to go on.
---
I doubt they're done, this is just the start of a process.  The buffs and further nerfs will be incoming.  FOTM builds will always be at risk, and they're addressing the most common build that was affected by the duping that went on too.  When you have to pick and choose, you start by fixing the 80% first vs. the remaining 20%.

Melee absolutley can melt the SBQ anyways. Most damage is dealt to her on the ground even with ranged, and if you kill all the adds when she's flying, got nothing better to do with melee anyways, then she'll land. 
---
Takes me one or two hits with my Bowie Knife, what am I missing, Wolves are babies (*excellent models though look realistic*). I can nuke level 91 glowing Death Claws with my Instigating dagger in about ten quick hits, sounds like ballistics are not the way to go.
---
Well today I bought the Welcome Mat plans from another player for 50 caps.
---
Then realised I already had it when I tried to use it. Then took part in a workshop defence event. Was awarded the Welcome Mat plans...
---
Yea. Except taking down a scorchbeast that NEVER lands  is one hell of a bitch. 
---
I have the same issue with white knight, server hop camp mclintock though should give you 10-15 ballistic fiber every 20-30 minutes. 
---
Nope.
---
&gt;nobody uses actual explosive weapons
---
so address the problematic explosive weapons themselves rather than a perk card affecting every type of explosive, it's not like you can't tweak individual weapon damages
---
&gt;Is it worth nerfing grenades?
---
No, and they aren't really nerfed besides the reduction in total damage which I felt unnecessary due to the point above. It's a non issue.
---
You will now need two* armor , unyielding and bolstering , bloodied weapons , nerd rage , adrenal reaction ( mutation) , revenant, adrenaline rush. Consumables 
---
Rad Shield, rad x , glowing mushroom soup , and glowing blood pack. 
---
then do the above but do it at westek then 
---
Ditto.  
---
I‚Äôm 26. I‚Äôve played nearly every MMO that‚Äôs been released, and a lot of grindy RPGs and Loot-em-ups.  
---
I‚Äôm well and truly over killing things repeatedly in the hopes of something useful dropping. Probably spent well near 10000 hours of my life grinding in games.  
---
Until there‚Äôs better loot mechanics (alternative methods to earn gear) or more gameplay content added I‚Äôm out. I‚Äôve optimised my character as much as I can stomach so that when new content *does* arrive I‚Äôm going to crush through it and be bored again.  
---
Haven‚Äôt played in two months and at the current rate of patch releases and their content it‚Äôs pretty unlikely I‚Äôll ever pick the game up again.
---
For the life of me I cant figure out why they haven't added a hockey mask. 
---
Yeah I can see where you‚Äôre coming from. But let‚Äôs be honest here if you‚Äôve played any game where melee is the main fighting technique, you know how to keep yourself from getting hit and taking too much damage. I mean dark souls has taught me a lot about melee combat and learning the AI‚Äôs movement patterns. I‚Äôm not talking about any PvP though because that‚Äôs totally unpredictable. Everyone‚Äôs just getting butt hurt over a game that wasn‚Äôt optimized because it‚Äôs the first online Fallout. Every Bethesda game I‚Äôve played or Obsidian, the damage output for weapons towards the end was always ridiculous and always will be because it‚Äôs a single player game but 76 is a whole new territory. 
---
Melee will get a nerf of some sort next update I bet. My TSE is still good just doesn‚Äôt kill everything in a shot or two which is boring if you ask me. 
---
^this. This is the whole reason why i don't listen to people complaining about nerfs and exploits. You are all being spoilt, i wish bethesda would make it more in line with hardcore survival modes in Fallout 4. No Fast Travel. No Player Icons. Hard weight limits. Would fundimentally change how this game is played. 
---
Ahhhh part of the fundamental game mechanics even though you don‚Äôt participate in it actively. Sounds familiar. Ridiculous they don‚Äôt have an option to turn off other players. I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to have to see them
---
If your character is too heavy you can't gain caps (sell items) and you can't put more items in your pockets after \~1700lbs of character weight.  
---
That‚Äôs weird ... last night I literally server hopped with a level 17 Alt to try and get the plans... finally got them from the Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor for about 600 caps ... prices really skyrocketed!!
---
Yes you can, I just popped in as a level 71 and bought them.
---
You write that I have no idea if H/H has a minority of users, then you go on to write that many players don't even know it exists. Wtf? You just reinforced the very statement you've tried to question.
---
It's so obvious that H/H is only used by a minority, I barely know how to respond... but I will share this, on the line of common sense, if it used by a majority Bethesda would not have taken this highly unusual and intrusive step. 
---
Simple solution to all of this: Design the opt-in now. It would take no great amount of time or resources and then if Bethesda wants to add further notifications later they can do so.
---
It should be divided within the team, not shared.
---
They sell them in Watoga as well.
---
I... can't imagine their lawyers being okay with that.
---
yes, ths has been brought up a ton.. the game will use your mods before the bulked junk. bethesda is fixing it in the patch
---
Thats why I steal all my stuff
---
This, So much.
---
I like my explosive weapons but with this nerf i might as well do a total rebuild of my characters. 
---
Your balance department needs some series balancing because this is just a knee jerk reaction that you have not thought about. 
---
In what way? I‚Äôm neutral on the nerf cuz I never had one but just wondering how it really effects anything besides reducing the ability to grief. 
---
beautiful, I‚Äôll put this on her giant gravestone 
---
Does that mean you can carry an additional 1500 lbs over the 265 I can normally carry? I‚Äôm confused.
---
What? Can u take a screenshot?
---
OOF.
---
Here's a thread about this very thing, granted from a couple months back. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a05ktb/so_does_camp_budget_increase_with_level_or_not/
---
The general consensus is that each item takes up less %, the higher level you are, which basically just means your budget increases. Also, probably caps at a certain level. 
---
One commenter wrote: To my knowledge it does increase, but is not automatically applied. You have to move your camp before it applies your level bonuses.
---
So maybe check that out, if you haven't moved in a while?
---
Vendor bot chad in Camden park has all plans for Excavator 
---
If they want to balance pvp they have waaaaay more to do than nerf explosives. Honestly in pvp i one shot everyone, even in power armor with melee, rifles, and shotguns, and 2 to 4 shot people with pistols, minigun like weapons and pretty much each other weapon. Pvp requires no skill, just a faster trigger finger. 
---
Because it's okay if constant high damage happens to the player but not the other way around.
---
I will admit that my sense of time was off, I was nervous and excited, both.  
---
However long it took, she died in the time it took her to fly from her spawn point to the location of the mass of players I was standing with.  
---
I fired 5 rounds and she was dead.  It was not an enjoyable experience and I doubt very much that bethesda intended for players to be able to punch through the legendary enemy hp regen of the end game boss. 
---
The revolver and the bolt action were great for this for sure.
---
Hope this fixes the double loading screen thus causing a paralyzed player that can't move, use weapons, use pipboy, can still fast travel but the effect still remains
---
Yeah, guns suck again. Meanwhile melee is still one shotting things.
---
But they told us they were nerfing TSE's 3 weeks ago, that's ample time to preemptively prepare
---
When are we getting a STASH increase? 
---
It is okay for them to make money by offering items for sale.  
---
Bug fix not mentioned in the patch: Barbarian Perk now works properly if you have STR modifying mutation (Egg Head) AND using Class Freak Perk.
---
Wow someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Did mommy not tuck you in last night?
---
So what I‚Äôm reading is *‚ÄùImagine if Bethesda made Fallout 5 instead of Fallout 76‚Äù*
---
I've heard they can synergize. I'm curious what the overlap looks like. With a full set of Undying plus rank 3 of Mysterious Savior, what is the percentage chance of a resurrect? If you can get up to 100% I'm starting a build TODAY. 
---
The people that were using TSEs putting 1000 dmg a shot that got reduced to 180 or so will just be using Bloodied, Furius, weapons and Axe that will stack over 1000dmg next time.  Glad to see the bobblehead fixed though.
---
Grenades of all types as well as grenade launchers are literally not even worth their weight or value in scraps now.
---
Welp.. guess I need to make multiple mules now.  At least they reduced transfer rate.  That helps.
---
I just bought handmade rifle plans from Watoga train station vendor. 
---
I like this idea, personally. I'm a little surprised no one's jumped in to tell you how bad an idea this is--I made similar comments a few weeks ago and got nuked by the set of folks who live for amassing daily bounties.
---
IT HAS BEEN OPT-IN BEFORE. But no one used it and my argument is that no one really knew it existed. And all other options for PvP are harshly discouraged so one plays any PvP even if he wanted.
---
This game died a long time ago. They‚Äôve failed to deliver a single good patch. GG, Bethesda 
---
I agree 100%. To many new games coming out to stick with this game TBH. I will get a few more runs for old times sake. But im honestly done. I have put up with Beth for way to long. 
---
Ours is coming too. I can feel it on the wind.
---
Supposedly legitimate player vending is coming in a future patch, but right now people are acting as vendors just within the current game limits as it is, which required them to carry a ton of items (and weight) on their characters to sell to people as the stash weight is only 600 lbs and is reached in a blink of an eye when you are a player trying to play as a vendor.  
---
So if your inventory is 10,000 lbs of goods to sell, after this latest patch they will have to give away/drop \~8,300 lbs of it.  There is a concept of mule characters where players have secondary chars to give their inventory to for carrying it, but now those characters are limited to the same holisitic \~1700 lbs weight limit. 
---
Jump between the Watoga buildings. Particularly the school and Emergency services. Great place for farming if you wanna break from Whitesprings and so often frequented.. So shhhhhh and don't tell anyone! 
---
So I understand that a LOT of players may be getting cheated out by all the nerfs, but as a lvl 47 I seem to have come along at just the right time. All the nerfs happened to endgame content that I was nowhere near. So for me and all the players after, it really did stretch out the game. not that I'm saying I'm happy about the nerds  (I was really hoping to get one of them dope ass tse weapons) However, I can say that I have never cheated with duping, I've already killed an SBQ, and I fully intend to keep it that way and play the game as intended. So much to the point that I DO NOT TRADE so I can avoid duped items entirely. I just want to run around, killing shit, farming supplies and plans and legendary weapons (of which I've noticed there's really only about a .5% chance of it even being useful)
---
I guess you enjoy manually swapping cards every time you need want to craft item, pick locks or change your play style.  Good for you. 
---
It probably does but they‚Äôve never made it obvious that some of the items if not most that are outfits can be found for free in the game such as the clown outfit
---
PSA: Vendor bot Phoenix in Watoga has all the T45, T51b and T60 plans
---
ok well maybe don't pick up everything you see, this isn't fall out 4.
---
Seems most ranged weapons are pretty useless now after those nerfs. Melee weapons are the way to go again yet again.
---
My explosive Lever Action Rifle went from around 370 damage to measily 235 now.
---
Meanwhile my melee weapon without any special mods does 326.
---
Thank you Beth, for lowering the fun one can have with your game!
---
I purposefully run the "One Violent Night" event everytime I see it pop up because I love getting that wendigo!
---
non pa armour is op with legendary effects so why cant power armour be op
---
Giraffe mod confirmed
---
They have "acknowledged" this issue and other issues with energy weapons since launch, since before launch due to the beta and have yet to address it. It's pretty stupid and shows how little support there is for this game, I bet they have like 3 people assigned to this game.
---
Perk cards are not multiplicative. They're additive. 
---
This needs to be up voted to the top of the world smh cmon Bethy
---
I have no doubt that its a hard job.
---
Not as hard as coal mining, but sure, pretty hard.
---
And not every hard job is a useful job.
---
Ur name is invalid. Even tho i wrote it right with the 146 combination.. Dfq

Much better than the crap I ended up with üòÇüòÇ
---
They had glass walls and ceilings in Fallout 4. It wouldn't take much to port over and I'm sure the fan base would eat it up too.
---
To repair armor. It cost a ridiculous amount to repair. Also I store some of my legendaries that are good because who knows how bad something will get nerfed. Also so I don‚Äôt have to farm the aids I just farmed a bunch for a couple days and put them on my other character
---
i was using a level 45 two shot revolver on my lucky pistols character because it had a moderate (not amazing) damage edge over a basic level 50 revolver at the cost of the accuracy which could be somewhat mitigated, if unpredictably, with concentrated fire. what surprised me was learning that you could actually miss *crit shots* with a two shot in vats. fucking excuse me???
---
&gt;Unique
---
Plus stuff you can't build, like legendary items. 
---
Poor baby got nerfed. Melee will get it too soon. L2P 
---
Haha. Totally.
---
Shhhh, you're going against the hivemind. 
---
TSE = The Devil
---
Melee = God
---
Nothing more, nothing less.
---
But they cost a LOT more now.
---
LOLOLOLOL oh god, the updates from an old branch of code instead of the latest they used last time strikes again! 
---
After playing the new patch, that isn't my issue with the nerf.  Before, the dmg it dealt was worth the risk of blowing my face off.  Now that the damage is good but not great, I don't see the point of taking the risk.  Will look to switch up to another option now.
---
Yes but cosmetic only means that it doesn‚Äôt effect gameplay. When the outfit sold, even temporarily, increases your health, that‚Äôs testing the waters to see how the community will react to monetizable buffs
---
Also, who knows if it's legit, but here's another link: https://twinfinite.net/2018/11/fallout-76-increase-camp-budget-can-you-what-you-need-to-know/
---
And even from my own experience, when I level up, I'm able to go back to my base and build an item or two more than I did previously. Who knows?
---
I've posted in another area of the thread specifically about the Hand Made Rifle plans. It's been said that is capped at level 44 and only available between level 15 and 44. I can understand the lower entry level to get the item but I do not understand why it disappears at a higher level. I've been checking Watoga and Harper's Ferry almost daily.
---
Annoyingly it was 10% per perk point in the Beta. They stealth nerfed it at launch.
---
Every card was 10/20/30%.

Possibly, but that's okay, it's definitely understandable and I won't be upset

My rifle/grenadier build is worthless now, that's including the fact I never had an explosive weapon either.

Pins, pins never change...

I don‚Äôt pick up the useless shit but I pick up all the necessities to repair and build

I think you must be new to the internet 
---
That would mean that luck somehow interacts with mysterious savior‚Äôs proc chance?

Same, hopefully they can do a hot fix shortly or it‚Äôll be another 2-3 weeks for a patch lol
---
Most people got a steal when sold at 1k on the market 
---
Has it happened to anyone else with pets?
---
Did you pet actually do anything being a sloth or did it just sit around?
---
No because that would be in a completely different part of America and a different time. I‚Äôm just saying it would be interesting seeing the world of we explore in fallout 76 and the events we hear about in Holo tapes and notes is actually like with NPC‚Äôs.
---
Upgraded wood armor gives increased stealth/crouched movement speed. A full suit weighs under 3. 
---
Stealth generally also benefits from low armor weight. So it helps covert operatives and ninjas reposition quickly to avoid detection. 
---
The price is that it protects like level 10 metal armor at level 45. 
---
yep, every single patch so far did nothing but slow players down, inflate the grind, raise prices, nerf some perks, make weapons useless ...it's pathetic. 
---
And the only reason they do it is because they know the content itself doesn't suffice to keep players busy, so why not dial up the tedium to 11... 
---
I‚Äôm a mele build and a tse build. I‚Äôm lvl 200 up and love playing. What‚Äôs the point in discussing changes to a game that we all want to enjoy in our own way. 
---
They want to force regular farming. 
---
Which is why ballistic fiber, screws and springs don't come from scrapping. 
---
They need it to maintain a level of grinding. Or else, what else is there to do at end game?
---
Just the Queen, so far. 
---
And farming rare mats, which just became more important with the White Knight nerf. 
---
The fire rate was way overstated compared to fact, maybe they levelled it the wrong way...
---
Please make nuka cola quantum power armor paint!
---
They overly nerfed TSE way to much.
---
They nerfed Explosive Bobblehead Exploit But didn‚Äôt nerf Melee Exploit.
---
With all these atom shop items is there any plans on adding more plans into the game for CAMP items? I‚Äôm ok with spending some extra money on the game but the pricing is way to high on a lot of items. I feel like every patch should add a plan to drop tables or something. 
---
Wey hey 76 days of non optimised game play woohoo üëçüòâ
---
...great. I...wow. I‚Äôm just gonna play Just Cause for awhile. At least when things go wrong there, it‚Äôs actually my fault.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a different way of experiencing things. I am a take a slow and savor it kind of player but I have tried the just rush through and loot stuff play in other games just to see what it's like.
---
My theory is that some people are just more addicted to that loop of getting loot as fast as possible. It's not that they don't get the value of taking their time they just enjoy the hits of dopamine they get from looting more.
---
Solid argument I would like to hear wether or not you think they could add a small handful and optimize over time if work on performance as a whole continues like it has? 
---
I wonder what the % chance to proc is with max rank and a full set of undying?
---
What about an explosive without two shot?
---
My explosive radium rifle that I've invested so much time into wasn't very powerful pre nerf now it sounds like it just got smashed by the nerf. -80% damage lost from the explosive + an additional 40% loss from Demolition Expert.
---
I'm probably done with 76 if I log in today and my gun is useless.
---
let me clarify that then
---
they were nerfed in this updated, which I disagree with. They fall under the same category of things that need individual attention rather than a blanket explosive nerf and are even more reason for considering my first paragraph.
---
Better high-priced than not available!
---
I understand the nerfing of explosive rounds but the two shot just makes no sense at all.  I‚Äôm firing two of the same rounds yet the second one does a quarter of the damage? 
---
Apparently so! I used my TSE shotty and my AA grog axe. Sold my TSE shotty and now I'll just stick with my axe until whenever
---
Yeah I am hoping it will be something like bonus damage from str capped to 20 str and nothing tooo horrible.
---
Yes, we can all be happy that a TSE handgun now does the same damage as a sword.
---
1.25 shot now
---
How is an entire tree of weapons being broken part of the "discussion" months after release? 
---
so do i, and i manage on a 400 stash budget....even thats to much imo i jsut cant be arsed going through it.
---
You don't need to collect that much stuff for repairs.
---
Cool then I can stop farming. Workshops lolz
---
Look at the new white knight nerfs. Now you will need all that junk plus more just to play the game and repair your shit every 5 minutes.
---
Most of the legendaries I have break after just a few reloads.
---
Just to repair shit and I held on to my weapons. I just keep all of it too so I can slowly sell it but with the 200 cap limit it takes forever
---
After this patch it should show for you now. The only plans that will not show are plans you are too low of a level to use, which will then show after you reach that level.
---
spot on my dude, even summed up your own post on top of it.
---
Legendary items eat up stash space and carry weight infinitely faster than plans/mods. That‚Äôs why it was my thing. Especially with the new carry weight limitations stocking those are completely impractical.
---
I just saw that ... T_T
---
you can still trade though just got to be cheaper than the vendors 
---
Seriously go try to kill something in PVE  Takes lots and lots more ammo, more grinding, more stims to stay alive.  The consequences are horrendous.  My Hand made does less damage than a .308 hunting rifle.  What a game killer this is.  At LVL 144 I feel like I've been fucked over, same as paying full price.
---
This is the case. TSE are still viable and will still shred things (albeit not quite as rapidly) but actual explosive weaponry are made more useless than they already were.
---
As someone who spent almost 4-5 months trying to get a TSE weapon to finally get it and then have it nerfed into the ground, I might go play another game. 
---
*makes a mad dash to the console*
---
Well, it wasn't really usable even before nerf. Its durability lasted for what, 1500 bullets and that is with 200% durability and with all the perks. 
---
Yes; the mechanic itself is fine. a 75% nerf in effectiveness is not. IMO it did not need nerfed at all; weapons with only two shot still felt weak in a lot of cases. 
---
This happened to me several weeks ago: the one and only time (and will never again accept an invite) I ever responded to a team request, and the moment I show up they start shooting me :-(
---
That was me up until about a week ago. Now vendors sell all plans, still can't build everything I want, also don't have enough caps.
---
I‚Äôd love to have a pet that can follow, but with the current aggression status they‚Äôd just be attacking everyone... maybe it can be resolved in a future update?
---
X01 plans are free,you have to read the computer next to the vendor to download the plans.
---
Dude knows I am right and he is wrong. Probably just a fanboy.

There is a line, and this crosses it.

Im at around 100+ hours and my favorite thing to do is design and set up my camps. Ive moved locations at least 20 times since starting the game lol. This was my main time sink in Fallout 4 also

It's a balance to them being always available now.  Instead of server hopping for days and/or weeks and hoping for them to show up (if they ever do) you can instead spend caps to get them right away.
---
If anything it will consume Caps out of the system, for a short time.
---
Could always spend days/weeks farming Plan spawn locations and/or Events.  And by having their guaranteed location prices be a bit high, it makes it possible for them to still have some value in player to player trades.
---
Because only one character may wear it. If you want another +15 hp then you have to either find the Grognaks outfit, or buy one
---
Rip. But you have to understand, it‚Äôs been broken for days since the game has came out.
---
It just seems like they didn‚Äôt want it to be as great as previous Fallout games. They should‚Äôve worked alongside of the ESO team or something.
---
My hand grenades combined with the explosive perk nerf fucking better not suck now. I have so much joy in tossing in a grenade of any type and grinning when I hear the "kill" sound, then rush in with a shotgun and start blasting. Grenades have gotten me out of so much trouble. 
---
I spotted it at either Harper's Ferry or Sunnytop Station today, forgot which, sorry.
---
LOL!
---
I'd also like to add to your list for QOL changes.
---
Floors, walls and roofs should be able to clip into landscape, i.e. cliff faces, to a certain degree so my cliffside camp can finally have a natural wall without gaps in the wall and holes in the second level floor.
---
Thank you! 
---
Math is hard.   100% more than 1 = infinity? No it's 2.  100% more slowly is twice as slow.
---
I'd rather you didn't click on their threads than stop them from being able to voice their angst.  That should work, although if even just seeing the titles as you scroll makes you rage, you could take a vacation from the sub.  Not everyone who is pissed off was a duper or exploiter.  They have a right to vent.
---
Not sure why this was downvoted‚Äî as a veteran dev, this is a rookie mistake and telling of their experience with managing branches/features in source control.
---
Yeah I have 25 points invested in shotgun/explosive damage, which barely gets my TSE shotgun to do more damage than a quite crappy All Rise, which doesnt have a single card towards it in my build. 
---
Guess I have to go melee now.. or just quit..
---
The notes are stating certain weapons shouldn't explode because of the ordinance they fire. I would think Tesla is one of them...and I could be wrong, but it does not seem to me that my Explosive Bloodied Tesla is working as intended when it no longer arks damage and instead makes a little poof explosive with a super small aoe...feels more like nerf. At least that explosive bug causing invincible mobs is fixed...
---
Just updated it to make it compatible ^^
---
im scared to look at what the damage input on mine will be when i get home tonight
---
Yes, and though i just realized i didnt necessarily mention all the Perk nerfs and whatnot, butthisis a conplaint of being limited, im not crying about TSEs. I have ONE, and its hardly used.
---
Toons? Why are other/alt characters called that?
---
Right? 5k worth of junk is absurd. 
---
they touch that, i stop playing. I'm a heavy weapons build and they already fucked up the auto grenade launcher so bad its not even worth picking up anymore. 
---
Personal carry weight on your character is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character‚Äôs current maximum carry weight. Nothing to do with containers.
---
I can't find plans for the life of me. My camps look awful because I can't find anything. 
---
and?
---
Why, what else were you planning on doing with it?
---
Actually with all my buy cheap perks enabled and grape men tats just bought the handmade plans for $1500 caps.  So might still be a market for em . 
---
God, the Division all over again. Putting 300 rounds of ammo into a dude wearing a puffy coat and just barely breaking his shield bar was terrible gameplay. Do not want for 76.
---
Few people PVP in this game because PVP in this game is not well designed or even particularly rewarding. What makes you think the intelligent response is therefore to spam players with server-wide notifications letting them know these poorly designed PVP things are potentially, maybe, if enough people queue, going to occur at some point? 
---
And your assertion that 'it has been opt-in before' has NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT (do the caps help?)  H/H was opt-in, and still is. What has never been opt-in before, because the thing you would opt-into did not exist, is avoidance of server-wide spam messages. 
---
Jesus dude, do I really have to explain these things to you?
---
Thank fucking god two shot explosive was nerfed. The game was basically ruined by them.
---
how dumb are you really?
---
Was hoping this was the case!
---
Has this been tested? Has anyone tried getting on a team and each wearing the same one? I think by unique they dont mean different for each person
---
Fallout 76 power armor station plans 
---
Same!  Only been hunting this forever!
---
Well some people were asking for more caps sinks... 
---
What vendor will sell heavy combat armour plans ? Found the arms at Watoga station but nothing else 
---
no they don't. what do you think happens once you equip one of the duped weapons and its durability gets used a little? 
---
I've since learned a lot and fought SBQ a number of times. The friends I've made along the way explained that it's only possible by using the bobblehead exploit.  
---
With the explosive nerf and bobble exploit fixed it should be impossible to kill SBQ before her regen fills her hp back up. Time will tell I suppose.
---
Has anyone tried wearing the same outfit in a team? Pretty sure the ‚Äúunique‚Äù just means the outfit, not that it has to be different for each.
---
You do realized that with a single 3\* perk card, someone can still hold 809 combat shotguns? This does nothing to stop duping.  
---
(That doesn't mean give us less space Bethesda... Don't go getting any additional shitty ideas)
---
Alternatively, when gifted with someone‚Äôs old legendary you could use it to do content further east, allowing you to group up with higher level teams and remain effective.
---
There‚Äôs more aspects to cooperative gameplay than shooting shit, literally or figuratively.
---
What does TSE mean, may I ask?
---
I'm a solo player. I fight deathclaws, super mutants, and mirelurk. I don't have any interest in the Whitesprings loot cave crap.
---
Bullshit.  
---
So are TSEs even worth trading for any more or are they total shit now ? Has anyone tried it yet? Has the patch rolled out? 
---
I've never made a blueprint and don't have any.  Also checked to make sure I didn't have 1000 corn or something.  Nope.
---
Thanks though for trying.
---
Sorry to hear about your money problems bro.
---
I found a furious limb damage weightless three star m79 that I used to tag things in white springs. Now it's not worth the ammo weight with these changes, when a TSE is comparable and more convenient
---
yes there does, and now the profit margin is slightly lower than what you wanted it to be that is all. nothing more nothing less.
---
People thinking there going to be the Donald trump of the wasteland were simply wrong that's all, i mean there's a limit to your wealth potential in this game anyways. you got 25k cap limit and now a weight limit to stop people hording tons and tons of mats. 
---
Once you hit that limit as a trader then what? Surely this is good as it will take you twice as long to get to that limit now, extending your fun as a trader no?
---
No shit, sherlock‚Äî that‚Äôs what everyone has been saying since it was announced w/ the reduction stats. ‚ÄúOh, .25% is a big increase‚Äù. No the fuck it isnt... this patch is a clusterfuck joke.
---
I think I saw a bit about that on the awards and I couldn‚Äôt remember the name. Thanks!
---
Holy shit, can you guys not piss people off even more?  Please?  No more shit sandwich surprises in this patch?  Pretty please?
---
Take the ARK approach.  Put a high level brewable potion/meal/drink that wipes stats and allows a full respec,  
---
I am jealous
---
They nerfed rad x stacking lol. I missed that one. Wondering whos bright idea it was.
---
Are grenades now nerfed to hell as well with demo expert? I never had an explosive gun, I always use nades...I don't even want an explosive shotgun or twin shot right now. 
---
Agree with you there. My quad explosive shotgun just took 5 shots to kill a level 50 protectatron in watoga. I can craft guns better than that! 
---
The last two patches has killed the game off.
---
 You do realized that with a single 3\* perk card, someone can still hold 809 combat shotguns? This does nothing to stop duping.
---
I facepalmed IRL when I saw this
---
They didn't need to nerf the explosive perk. They needed to remove the explosive perk stacking with an explosive legendary effect. Now actual explosive weapons are even more shit. 
---
One of the best parts of this nerf goes out to the idiots that were buying these duped weapons off of ebay sellers. Their end all guns, that they paid cash money for, now hit for nothing! 
---
I was waiting for the azerty fix but it didn't do anything for me? VATS/CAMP/photo mode is still using qwerty.
---
Less lag, but more server crashes, the dupe server crashing method is still out there.
---
Two shot explosive
---
I can't wait for work to be over! I'm going to buy five of them, use one, and then burn the  f&amp;@#ing Eastern Penitentiary down with the flames of the other four.
---
I agree. 
---
I play NBA 2k19 and they recently nerfed a specific type of player, and they are now basically useless. 
---
I have a buddy who has invested 300+ hours on this player idk how much money (at least $50 because he started as the same time as me maxed out) and he has completely quit the game.
---
I think is essentially a spit in the face.
---
To be fair though, farming mats is not my idea of 'fun'. So hopefully, we get more end game content tp offset the need to farm rare mats a bit more. 
---
*chokes and dies*
---
Thanks for that last completely useless response. It was at least worth a giggle to see how stubbornly stupid you can be when faced with a very simple thing you don't seem to understand in the slightest. xD
---
Welcome to block, my friend.
---
Thanks I'll go download
---
Be interesting to see if everyone's was killed or if you got unlucky and someone killed it right before you loaded in or logged off last night
---
What does that mean?
---
Holy fuck, it would have been so good. 
---
I really can't tell if this is bait, but they announced TSE nerfs 3 weeks ago, and you didn't prepare whatsoever?
---
Did they add the unstoppables to the atom shop? I swore people found grognaks stuff in the world.
---
Which vendor.  I though the X01 Ultracite plans were the free ones
---
Does literally any outfit count, as in the term unique being relative to your group? If so then no biggie. If not then big f-ing problem.
---
For clarity, do you have the adhesive in your inventory when you are trying to craft? We have a known issue where sometimes crafting benches are showing players have the items needed to craft/repair items but not properly reading it between their STASH and their inventory. Putting crafting items in your inventory seems to help. 
---
Did they ever actually add anything that improved the game? 
---
Well out of all the rough starts, it's so reasuring the devs are cracking into getting the game fixed after reading the last patch notes the devs are getting  things right thanks guys. 
---
&gt;However not every hard job is a useful job
---
Let me put it to you this way: if you check the average salary of a social media manager in the US, you'll find a figure somewhere around $50,000 USD. There's nothing company executives hate more than losing money, so if companies across the board are willing to pay this much for that kind of job, that means the people working those jobs contribute that much value (and, realistically, more) to their employers.
---
Community manager jobs are provably useful, so questioning the validity of the general profession isn't productive; that said, questioning the usefulness of *individuals* in those positions is absolutely fair.
---
So I effectively lost my mind (what little was left) and went Berserker.  I basically use no (0) armor, nor any perks that give resistance.  Instead I run around in a rad suit.  I'm at level 46 and enjoying the heck out of it.  
---
same here.  10 bulked aluminum yet i can't craft anything that requires it.  well done deve team - break some shit that wasnt even part of the patch
---
Tried, nope.
---
Idc if you believe me or not but I swear on my life me and my friend had shit taken from us
---
Next patch they will add a Pinhead perk card which reduces Bobble Pins weight by 30/60/90%
---
My pet megasloth is fine. 
---
Thanks for posting. I was about to do the same thing. How the fuck do they recreate a bug they had previously fixed?! 
---
Remember when they were rare?
---
Good job Bethesda! You guys are WOKE! Now buy some dupes on the Atom Shoop.
---
Two shot = gun shoots an additional projectile
---
Explosive = bullets explode
---
The patch notes for today's patch are on Bethesda's website, if you wanna read them!
---
Yeah. Increase in storage, reduced weight of Bobbi pin and fixed the lever action reload animation. I always defend Bethesda and give them the benefit of the doubt.. but all they have been doing is making the game harder without making it more fun.. everything is a chore now. They sucked out what little fun their was. 
---
They even reduced the drops from uranium fever, no more 3 star legendary, you‚Äôll be lucky if you find a 2 star. 
---
Pathetic and I am out. Have fun with your empty world.
---
You sure you're collecting the specific flowers? If you look at the challenge, it lists which flowers and individual quantities. So it's not just collecting 5 flowers (or whatever) it's collecting a stack of 10 of 5 different flowers. 
---
Prepare as in, look into getting other weapons or spec-ing into something else?
---
I saw after the first patch this game was going to become miserable because of the nerfing they do.
---
I'm so glad I stopped playing. Every patch notes i just see more grind being introduced with minimal fixes that were actually wanted.
---
Fuck bothering playing this game and trying to fight off the durability aspect lol.
---
Uninstall mods if you have any
---
You are most welcome :)
---
Quite simple. the codebase that they built this most recent patch on top of is not the live code but some older version. Therefore you will find that quite a few things have regressed. And because they clearly don't even have the most basic regression test pack to run on the code it all got rubber stamped into a live deployment.
---
My explosive (non 2shot) shotgun used 1 shot a deathclaw all perks it did 800 damage
---
Wait... So my mules weight counts against my main character max weight?
---
That sounds so fucking lame lol. Never even played the game but I just remember everyone kept acting like it was obvious that tons more content would come along. Obviously when a game sells so badly and is this bad, those things will never come. RIP
---
I have an explosive one, I accidently blew 2.5k ammo in one shot.  I'd been saving since day one.  Now its nerfed too before being fixed
---
Could be a simple database value change
---
Now you can trash all that heavy ordnance and ammo, and make room for Bobby Pins that will again weigh a metric fuckton.
---
preach it!
---
They caught me with the cap stashes lol
---
I give them credit they really are trying to level this game out 
---
Oh fuck me. 
---
It should be called quarter shot explosive 
---
The scorched barrels add a 4th star to guns too.
---
I've found mainly Melee weapons are useful. Guns I use for tagging before I can get to them.
---
Clearly their assertEquals(0.01, get.itemValue(BobbyPinWeight)) unit test script isn't up to scratch.
---
Hey guys, any chance we'll be able to sell or scrap ammo or fusion cells? I find mini nukes and cells all the time, but I don't like using them, would be nice to be able to unload them instead of dropping them
---
Will need to do testing with each level to see if it caps out at a certain point. Welp that's a large saturday project for me XD
---
Ps4 pro, gamer tag d85961, beth id dougcamp, dbcampbell999@gmail.com 
---
Demolition perk only give 6% not 60%. Crafting will no longer use items in bulk. Explosive weapon values now same as non explosive
---
&gt; The recent patch removed radx stacking, and thus non PA builds will struggle to survive in nuke zones.
---
Mathemetically it never made sense to do this anyway. Radiation deals lots of small hits and you're already butting up against the wall of diminishing returns with 150 rad resist, let alone 600 or over 1000.
---
Yeah I'm okay with that 
---
You can scrap the bulk items but I agree bug is annoying 
---
2 of the 3 things you listed aren't exploits though...
---
I understand your concern but I am actually happy about this change. I‚Äôve been playing this game since late November and I have not once managed to get a full queue for Hunter/Hunted despite tuning into the station hundreds of times.   Having this message pop up for the server will remind people that it exists and may make them more likely to join themselves. It sucks that I haven‚Äôt even been able to try out this feature of the game. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. 
---
Here‚Äôs what you do.. 
---
raise your building off the ground that way the ones with melee weapons can‚Äôt get you..
---
Problem solved :D
---
Bought the jetpack for t-60. Lost the caps. Plan doesn't show up in crafting. Plan doesn't show up as knomn in vendor inventory, and doesn't show as a plan I can buy anymore. So, screw me, I'm out nearly 5500 caps, I guess.
---
With such large changes it is really needed.
---
Sounds like a Charisma perk
---
I‚Äôm just trying to reduce the spam of all the new posts, simply asking for this venting to be located in a pinned section at the top of the sub so everyone can see it if they click into it rather than there being 70 new posts with the same title
---
Isn't this intended? 
---
You bulk items to sell, so now like mods, if you want to use it to build/repair, you should have to break down your bulk manually. 
---
Would you take a look at this fancy lad, i bet you can afford brick walls instead of wooden. Pompous prick.
---
can't you break it down?
---
no!!! ya don't say?!?! :O 
---
Ya, I have a love hate relationship with this. I think overall its good. That damage was obviously not intended. What sucks is what this did to Missile Launchers/Grenade Launchers/Grenades which frankly need a buff and not a nerf. Explosive nerf should have only applied to the legendary effect and not to the base explosive weapons.
---
How are you getting down voted?
---
They didn't announce reducing demolition expert from 100 to 60 and that's where the problem is. 
---
No that's the suit itself, not mods.
---
This idea sucks imo
---
I don't think you know what buffed means.
---
Probably so people stop duping nuka colas for caps like in this case 
---
What strikes me as funny is how we didn't see nearly the same amount of backlash for the race car bed. They're both beds for children. 
---
[Half the time I spent in game was trading  for and collecting items to pass out to new players, on a good night  going through a few hundred pounds of junk upgrading armor, weapons,  power armor for little or no cost.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al2xi5/im_a_hardcore_fan_so_much_so_3_accounts_were/)
---
With  the new "Rebalance" of Inventories that is going to be challenging, in  the fashion I enjoyed doing it (Full Kit's for people)...
---
Hell  I have a new player doing a "Fetch 1,000 boiled water" quest for a 3\*  Lever Action, and was going to use the water to make food/drink to pass  out...  Now how is that going to work..  
---
There are numerous fixes they could do to the databases to fix the stability, I sit with modders and game devs nearly daily. Hell we are being ignored when we post legit bug fixes down to the FormID number. [I found and posted the cause for the Power Armor Targeting HUD CTD's. Radio Silence](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/).  
---
This change was done to target dupers, but the knee jerk implementation means it's hurting others who like to play the game as it was advertised, working together to rebuild the wasteland.  
---
Were Nuka Quantum Grenades fixed? 
---
I'm hoping someone can quantify everything in a excel document. Bloodied and furious damage is a listed dps increase. Unlike Anti-armor which shows nothing which is something I'm unsure about if it's a working stat. Only way to quantify it is by maybe running SBQ solo with two different weapons lol.
---
&gt;Mostly because I was told at the onset that PVE would be a thing in FO76
---
By who?
---
Interesting.  How odd. How often would you say it procs?
---
holy fuck I am going to have to edit this.
---
GG. I haven‚Äôt really checked but is there any way to break down the bulk item or am I just gonna have to sit there with my dick in my hand?
---
Gotcha. Only legendaries I've found with that perk are melee weapons that I promptly ditch somewhere (a friend or a vendor or something). I've never tried to mod them. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Today's patch changes that.
---
Weird. I'll add you then. IGN?
---
You nerfing is a lazy attempt to make the already easy game harder instead of adding other content to add a challenge.
---
All your doing is making it harder to use guns forcing people to melee, which is OP af.
---
White knight nerf? Really?
---
Just change the name to Farmout 76. Because thats all your doing now is farming.
---
Y'all can have fun with this turd, un installed.
---
If I do sure but atm it doesn't seem there are plans in the wild. I really hope I'm wrong there lol
---
THEY SUCK NOW :D
---
How about flame paints for structures?  You know, to make griefers think they are already rurnt?  /s
---
They could‚Äôve made them mutually exclusive and been just fine.
---
Good thing I have my regular explosive build to fall back on...oh wait.
---
Think he gets downvoted just for being antagonistic. 
---
I can confirm the Handmade Plans are at Harper's Ferry at Level 37 after the patch.
---
yes you are correct, however It would bring about an even bigger question as to why they would revert DB values as that would require intent.
---
Molotovs will still be worth using for loot-tagging enemies. That's pretty much it now though.
---
I read it somewhere, my daily conversations with Bethesda are fairly one sided....
---
Just so everyone knows, this is a far stronger nerf to two shot than they seem to think thanks to the way armor works. It's entirely possible for a two shot weapon to now do Less damage than a regular version of the same gun.
---
The new formula for each bullet will be (base damage x 1.25) /2. Depending on the targets armor the increased per bullet mitigation is likely to outweigh the damage bonus. 
---
They don't listen to the community brother.
---
I truly believe there's an 85yr old financial Bethesda backer that's calling these shots and getting results.
---
Probably doing it because his 500 pound, 35yr old grandson living in the mansion basement keeps bugging him to and watching the company go under means nothing to I'm but keeping far as quiet does.
---
Same fatty is like running around griefING 24/7 and loving everyminute of it.
---
I agree that you can find creative things to do in the game outside of the core gameplay but what you described to me just sounds like you are looting and shooting higher level stuff.
---
To each there own but there is a reason the game doesn't start you off fully geared. A large part of the game is building up your character. Skipping straight to higher level content will likely make the lower level content less engaging.
---
Not sure what you mean. I only talked about plans.
---
Yep, player crafting is basically dead.
---
Have fun dealing in legendary items.
---
Apparently bulk mats are no longer auto-scrapping for repairs and crafting. So you may have to go scrap your bulk mats first and then try again.
---
What about the Broadsider? The weapon weighs a ton, it's ammo weighs a ton, it now deals trash damage with the demolitions expert perks and break after 10 shots at max durability. I really want to carry special weapons like this around, yet they break after a fight with 3 enemies. Same goes for every single high RoF weapon like the minigun, shots are counted the same as any other "normal" weapon (excluding energy) so their higher fire rate makes them break faster.
---
Those recipes have always been there, but only a few at a time and random. Going from 3,300 caps to 20,000 is insane. 
---
And was the duping technique in the old branch of code?
---
Is it back?
---
Learn CVS, ffs.
---
There is a challenge to play the game for 7600 hours.  If you look at that challenge you will see how you are progressing and get the number of hours you have played so far.
---
I just broke 300.
---
The only reward in here for speaking the truth is downvotes m'friend.
---
its not a bug. its the mod scrapping fix. bulk items dont count as junk for crafting cause it needs to be scrapped.
---
SkeeterNL without spaces. 
---
It appears so, I've tested on my own account, and have confirmed with a couple friends who did the merchant thing as well.
---
I gotcha. I'm full X-01 so I'd really like to buy from some venders
---
losing a level instead of working towards the next higher means slightly less xp grind.
---
you dont have to choose between a perk card or a stat relocation. 
---
It's baby steps like this that companies use in achieving an end goal.  Pretty sure lunch boxes were planned or in the works.  
---
You give these people an inch and they will take a mile.  It's not a great increase but that slither of health can count in a battle. 
---
I just finished carefully planning my explosives build üò¢ now it's completely redundant, as if it wasn't unviable before.
---
It's not in the patch notes
---
Can you link?
---
&gt; get their hands on. I‚Äôm looking for an adventure that doesn‚Äôt require me to run from level 70 super mutants. With my tse I can actually put up a fight.
---
..a 1,500lb weight limit should do the trick..
---
Yeah lemme just buy 4 PCs to run FO76 on all of em and mule characters that way
---
Yeah I'm probably done too. MY explosive gauss rifle went from 900 to 200
---
and then they changed cap stashes so i cant farm them
---
Yeah i've played 300 hours and I just cant continue especially since they've took out way to grind out caps 
---
Because they're delusional and actually think TSE is useless now just because it isn't overpowered
---
And some others have said they went too far with the nerfs, and they should have made demolition expert a 3 point perk instead of a five if they were planning on nerfing it like that. Fun fact, the one good weapon I had a two-shot exploding combat Rifle now does less damage then my single shot non exploding 50 caliber hunting rifle. Makes perfect sense.
---
&gt; Belly of the Beast: A new ‚ÄúUltracite Power Armor‚Äù entry has been added to Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal on the top floor of Fort Defiance, offering Ultracite Power Armor plans to those who read it. 
---
Well, guess I ought to go grab mine. 
---
It's almost as if literally quadrupling the damage was too much.
---
Best Patch yet! Seriously!
---
Its not that the previous levels of explosive weapons damage were fine. They were not. They deserve flat 50-100% increase in damage.
---
Just because something kills something slower than before doesn't mean its useless it just means you need a little more ammo and have to press the trigger 2 or 3 times as much as before.
---
True,got no idea where the mods are
---
Lol I‚Äôm not worried at all I look forward to the chaos and people swinging at each other‚Äôs face with odd weapons bwahah
---
That's honestly the most short-sighted way to see this situation, since people either farmed for days to get one of these weapons or (Like me) paid high amount of caps (or even real money) to buy one of them in order to stay somewhat competitive in this game.
---
Making them completely useless is just a joke, they should just have halved the damage they used to be able to do.
---
Devs should not have catered to or wasted time on pvp here. 
---
waiting for items to randomly appear in a shop was never content.  
---
It appears they removed the legendary that spawns in Watoga Emergency Medical building. That was such a good grind. An info if that‚Äôs true? I don‚Äôt see that listed in the patch notes. 
---
Request sent
---
Wait so for a limited time you get a temporary health boost for buying certain items with Atoms?
---
ps4-5
---
White knight nerf made me put it down.
---
There motive is clear, nerf to make it more challenging, the scraps to ores, TSE and exsplosive damage do significantly less per bullet to farm more bullets
---
White knight was something added NO ONE asked for.
---
You made the game too easy and rushed release now to make up for lack there of youre nerfing shit endlessly, shit no ones asking for.
---
Im done with this shit show.
---
#Farmout76
---
It is indended. No more crafting with bulk before loose.
---
awesome possom
---
Yes they can!
---
They definitely need to buff energy and plasma guns, even if thinking back, they weren't that strong in previous games too, although way more useful
---
"REEEEEEEEEE"
---
-this sub rn
---
Double barrel. Gotta be the first legendary I get post nerf
---
High Quality Patch Notes- I might not like everything in them, but it‚Äôs better than being surprised.
---
Perhaps a dumb question, but you aren't using rad-x?
---
Rad-x suppresses mutations. 
---
Go to WhiteSpring, there is a vendor that has a bunch of plans. Running workshop events rewards you plans each time you defend your workshop. 
---
Exploring I find plans but you have to be looking out for them, you have to explore those out of way places and broken buildings, found a bunch at power stations. Also hit the Power grid sites or whatever they called, your almost guaranteed a plan. The ones they look like a bunch of electricity with a fence around them .. I always find plans in the boxes here or on the table inside the shed.
---
No, I said "more then they fix things that are broken". Context. 
---
you have to manually scrap it
---
Everything I see here is pretty much exactly what the Atom Store needs.
---
This is all great stuff Bethesda, keep it up!
---
He's also convinced Bethesda will make it possible to display things in camp one day lmfaolmfao.
---
Losing a level can only mean *more* exp grind because you are literally throwing exp away.
---
And no you wouldn't get to choose because you already chose the perk point.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking.   
---
The way the vendors sold plans forced a marketplace for them.  They already fucked up on the weapon side with duper‚Äôs where no one really wants anything other than tse for 2-3k. 
---
You can get the order of mystery one for free in game
---
Been playing the game since day one.....Extremely slow clap for Bethesda on providing updates.  Not only do they fix bugs but also remove any fun at the same time.
---
The griefers can still destroy my fusion reactor, decon arch, and the rest of my camp, even though I'm resolutely pacifist/PvE/anti-PvP.
---
But hey, tick blood! I can get more tick blood! 
---
One has to question Bethesda's priorities, and their grasp on just what actually *aggravates the crap* out of their player base.
---
You mean like another freaking melee build? No thanks. I solo mostly and go back and forth between my TSE and TS lever-action rifle that I'm specced for.  I like it. 
---
Did you use Rad-x?
---
Nope
---
Is it as glass cannon as a low life build? I have been looking for a way to stay in a radsuit for most gameplay and I didn't even consider beserker
---
Okay, and? I'd rather play a game 60 hours than 90 hours if the extra 30 hours is just dumb busywork
---
Nice, was mining Grahm last night and got 1 from him for 182 caps, couldn't get a 2nd one but got a bunch of other cool stuff.
---
i think it might be a good way to lower the amount of caps that have been duped in the past but i totally agree feels so empty. They are going to need to add items fast to keep things interesting for late game players whether that be item skins new weapons clothing, armor, mods. they have a of content to pull from. 
---
No. When I get gome, I'm going to strut into Watoga blaring "Flight of the Valkyries" over open mic, buy every copy of the Handmade plans I can find, use one, drop the rest and teabag the brown paper bag for 10 minutes, then I'm going to use them as kindling to burn Eastern Penitentiary down.
---
What is AAE?
---
Dude.  People ahve already pointed out in several threads, that it's not just Atom clothes.  There's a perfectly good **FREE** Unstoppables outfit in game from the Mistress of Mysteries questline.  People need to quit whining about "Pay to win" and use their goddamned brain.
---
Btw, the first 2 were sneak attack kills. 
---
2 Antiseptic
---
1 Plastic
---
1 Purified Water
---
1 Strangler Bloom  
---
What's the difficulty here? Walk up the river at night and grab ~10 strangler blooms, craft with chemist and super duper to average 23 radshields. 6 hours of buff time.
---
That is fair. They should have mentioned it in the notes. I suspect that bulk items are protected like mods are now. 
---
They should just amend the notes to include this. 
---
Is the price higher now?  I was going to buy the Gatling Gun plans  from the BoS vendor, but it is over 3000 caps.
---
it's 1500 past cary weight, so if your 'mule' has 100 cary weight, that's 1600 that they can have on them
---
I've got a purple headlamp because I like the blacklight look to it. But I'm also looking for a jetpack, best of luck to you :)
---
if you are elevated (dont think u can be in the cave)..but if im on a ledge at whitepsring they cant touch me at all..but if im on the ground they would **** me up lol
---
The nerf to explosive affix as well as demolition expert as well as two shot. Im losing around 200% of my weapons base damage... Totally balanced nerf and not a complete assfucking.
---
Which endgame content? XD 
---
Yep. I know this is only set 25 years after the war but there‚Äôs way too much stuff around.
---
Terrible in Watoga as well.
---
yea thats okay i dont mind that but goto that substation with the deathclaw 
---
Yeah they'll nerf that outfit too. Watch.
---
Old post that I'm replying to here, but if you still have it I'd be interested. Mine seems to either have been bugged and is no longer in my stash, or I mistakenly scrapped it and have no idea...
---
do you know if he sells the stealthboy plans?!?!
---
so a TSE Lever Action should still 1 shot mutants?
---
A Gatekeeper could control who is in this sub.  Im requesting haters w/o constructive criticism to leave...simple. ;)
---
Then you would hate mmos or monster hunter
---
Each of the major factions we found in the game should have a set of camp decorations and armor/weapons skins of some type.
---
Responders
---
Free States
---
Enclave
---
Vault Tech
---
US Army
---
BoS
---
Unstoppables

Creepy Cultists
---
Mothman Cultist
---
Raiders
---
maybe even scorched for those who want to embrace their inner fungus.
---
Finally! Time to scrap for mods 
---
The game no longer recognizing bulk junk is definitely an oversight of the mods no longer being scrapped fix they did
---
It's still gonna be good 
---
&gt;Removing...my ability to duplicate items
---
lol
---
And they respond with the full vitriol of someone who was apparently blasted by TSE‚Äôs over and over. Hatred is truly blind.
---
The mole miner gauntlets are pretty good I would think. Or a Deathclaw Gauntlet. I am actually bummed by how much power armour seems to be required at like 35+. I don't think even with all the damage reduction and protection cars you can even come close.
---
Hey now, it's not like you grinded for the TSE so don't oversell that bit, but we definitely should have a respec of some sort (more than just special points).
---
 these dupe exploits that require multiple people to do?
---
i wonder how they would have fixed that by looking at a single player game where it wasn't possible to do that in. 
---
What are you on about? Survival Beta is in March and the event is going on right now until next Tuesday (which is the weekly reset)
---
ESO is a slightly, very slightly, somewhat different story/universe/concept/world than Fallout. Just slightly though. So, people in ESO aren't really relevant to the Fallout universe. 
---
This is like complaining to Trump on your Facebook feed.. like Bethesda is going to read your comment hear and give 1 F.
---
But bulk items never scrapped anyway!
---
It'd also be nice if they added the option to bulk screws...
---
So...I'm just asking here...how would you build the lock picking and hacking dynamics if you had the choice. I mean, not everyone is roaming around the wasteland with these skills, right?
---
Half-width walls make sense.
---
The closest I've seen is the half-height, half-width wooden fence under *Defenses*
---
What system are you on? I have a ton of extra camp plans
---
I wish they focused on new content instead of just forcing people to respect and playing with the annoying perk card system.  
---
Nothing makes me want to play this game anymore.  How many times can I nuke fissure site prime or white springs? 
---
If the promotional buff is for **unique** costumes in the party and you are wearing that one, guess which one your party mate can't be wearing.
---
Awesome - and also now I'm going to be broke all over again lol!
---
I like this change, personally. 
---
But they should have included it in patch notes, so I can see why OP is a but miffed. 
---
Well the whole point of Fallout is how humans live after Nuclear fallout. 
---
This will hit those dupers good
---
I wonder if instead of offering a single point to move each level instead of the perk card, they could up it to 5-10, or respec on level up instead past 50?
---
I reset my controls to default, then I changed my keyboard in windows 10 to Belgian French Azerty. After binding my keys again I can use zqsd to move around in build/photo mode. See if that works.
---
* nerfs tse and white knight for upcoming pvp only mode when no one plays pvp *
---
Anti Armor Explosive
---
Wonder if that's intended or another bug.
---
Worth holding off buying them all till confirmed you reckon?
---
mats for turrets and resource collectors, and power generators (workshop mats don't cover the cost for fusion generators, nor the amount of turrets needed to defend the workshop from random high level mobs.)  to power for these things and most importantly the time investment.
---
i keep saying  the best way to get people to invest in workshops is to save everything we've built at a workshop in a workshop specific stash. That way we can just walk up to and press redeploy from the workbench, and all the stuff we've built pops back into existence.
---
The idea that this patch was modeled over an older build could also be confirmed by the fact that we're back to 1 loading screen and the waiting time/freeze after loading or fast traveling.
---
yeah, it works fine.
---
oblivion was the same engine. 
---
There is no way to get that item if it is scrapped. I'd have to play through again and  transfer it to another character. 
---
I said announcement of, not release of.
---
Greg in Grafton has all Excavator plans too
---
I've just tested both outfits. 
---
The garb of mystery does not allow you to wear armor whilst the silver shroud does.  Pretty big deal if you ask me.  
---
And then following patch they nerf it because everyone equips it.
---
They were definitely a lot more viable in the previous games, but that's due to them having perks dedicated towards their performance. In 76, that's absent, and is built entirely in favour of ballistic weapons and melee damage
---
Thanks - that worked.  
---
Server hopping is so annoying to see and probably hurts server stability. 
---
1. PC. Windows.
---
2. Not relevant.
---
3. Not relevant.
---
4. New patch removed my two turrets entirely but did not decrease the budget. When I logged in my placed turrets were gone. They are not blueprinted or saved. Just gone entirely. But the budget has not changed. So I'm unable to make new turrets.
---
Yeah. Seems that every gun plan now sits at 1000-4000caps which is a bit insane since they have limited how you can gain caps.
---
There are plenty of games out there but this is a Game as a Service.  You can't expect to have a living, breathing online world that receives constant updates but and the company get nothing from it.  Artists and developers have to put food on the table.  
---
Also, this "start making games again", let's be honest game companies exist to make money just as any other company.  Individual developers may do it out of passion but at some point money is kind of important.  Sure today we see cash shops and DLC, but 20+ years ago it was expansion packs.  Do we forget how Diablo 2's ending was walled behind an expansion in 2001?  
---
All that this thread is asking for is a QoL improvement that already exists and even then if added as was suggested would still be earnable by game play.
---
Okay, I get the hate now. Same setup, two guys hunted me down because I killed ghouls near their turrets on the back porch. Not just a "go away" attack but actively hunting me down. I didn't attack their structure.  I was just.. killing things. What jerks. They're on the offensive now. 
---
TS Bloodied BB Gun...drop the SBQ just by aiming at her.
---
Put the mats in yout stash. Its another bug. Happens frequently with ultracite and x01 pa.
---
that's a bit of a stretch but queue the deluge of youtubers posting videos about how Bethesda has completely and totally reversed course and fo76 is now 100% pay to win :P
---
Nope. My gripe is if you want to have rad resistance, you gotta put on a suit, and the suit takes off other armor. Making it get lost in my other items. If I could rename them like the previous games -&gt; zzzRLeg, zzzchest and so on. 
---
There‚Äôs Bethesda again. Solving problems that don‚Äôt actually exist,,,,,
---
Why are the devs forcing me into PA? I hate PA. I use it for rad protection in blast zones and thats it. I play NO PA!
---
Thanks. Sounds cool.
---
I‚Äôd rather have a scorched skin like in ESO you could change your player skin would be nice I‚Äôd definitely pay for character skins 
---
Interesting. I just went to Whitespring for the first time last time (level 33) and ran into several 100+ lvl players. Immediately was swarmed with lvl 60+ ghouls. Ran. I'll have to go back with a smaller server to explore a bit. I never bother with workshops because they just seem like more work than they're worth, but if they give plans I'll start doing that too. Thanks for the advice!
---
I'll be there passing out dense armors if my update every completes 
---
Wow. So you can't play unless you are OP and can 1 shot everything? When I got to 45 I was using a normal NON legendary Handmade and had no trouble. 
---
Agreed. They honestly could stand for a 1.5x - 2.0x base damage buff and they‚Äôd be totally fine. I mostly threw that out as a happy medium since I feel like Bethesda is scared of making them too strong :/ 
---
Thousands of items, loading in and out every few seconds....
---
Yuuuup, same here.  This is not ok.
---
Na but im loosing faith 
---
PS4. 
---
This is a medium team‚Äôs first solo attempt at a multiplayer game from scratch. They admittedly did release too early for where the game was at launch, but they‚Äôre attempting to make good on it now. Not all of Bethesda is working on this game, otherwise it would likely be much more complete than it is. 
---
Shit man I‚Äôll probably play it more. Pvp won‚Äôt be a one shot showdown anymore. I mean I‚Äôll be running from guys with big axes now.
---
I have never felt more exhilarated reading a comment. You guys are awesome. 
---
Stealthboy was 1000 now 6000 like dang haha increase the fucking cap limit lol trading is now worthless lol I think a lot in this patch was to punish the duper‚Äôs but it actually hurts other players more than them üòÇ
---
We all make mistakes. After all, didn't Bethesda make 76?
---
This is happening to me right now too. I've been waiting for someone else to post about it. This needs some serious attention, Bethesda pleaseeeeee.
---
That's what the tse users said.. the nerfs came for them and you said nothing.
---
You know I'd like to see more of that.  Never had anyone to give my fuel to.
---
REEEEE
---
Is this intended?
---
Hopefully they haven't repaired something and the mod has been used. D: 
---
[The new Experimental MIRV](https://giphy.com/gifs/nerf-gun-mr-pheeney-gqZLwdikMiJqg)
---
So boring, I want some sick masks/armor 
---
It's not but I wish it came with a consumable respec potion so a major nerf like this would allow people to quickly change their build, making it easier to adjust
---
Bulking items "was" a waste of wieght and plastic. You just have to manually scrap it.. Fairly straight forward. 
---
It looks like they increased the prices on plans in shops. Small price to pay to have everything available without server hopping I guess.
---
Put a guaranteed legendary spawn in every location with a 20 hr cool down like vendor caps. Make people move around for their farming. Would definitely keep people on their feet
---
every mod so far. i think chat mod updated jsut now but i dont use that.
---
The TSE combo was sextupling the base damage of weapons. Crazy right?
---
Yeah they completely broken. Running away and keep running as soon as you hear them is the best way I avoid them while downing stimpacks, they just chronic stimpacks abusers. Super annoying .. I find you take less damage if you on the move. You can't hide or escape them, they will either hit you with their poison or their boom, just keep moving. I recently acquired some TSE weapons, so I have been able to tackle them, after today's update, I will see if that is still the case or I will need to keep moving ..
---
Well, a little credit to you then.
---
That's also a fair argument. So before I take on the bunker, I equip the hacker card. I shouldn't probably have to do that because I have them. I freaking earned them! I see your point.
---
I am guessing it may be intended with the fix to scrapping mods. Bulk doesn't help much with weight. It is mainly used for selling materials. I suppose you can still manually scrap it right? If not, then yeah, bug.
---
&gt;I for one am incredibly happy they finally put The Silver Shroud costime in the game
---
Yes, selling a re-used FO4 asset in the Atom Shop is exactly the same as "putting it in the game."
---
Yeah same, haha im glad i had a melee build from the begining. Theyve yet to nerf it though its been one of the best builds since the begining...
---
Yep fixed it it was my chat mod thx :(
---
Why bother patching it? There's probably under 5k people worldwide even playing this game.
---
Personally I stopped playing in late December with the state of energy weapons and no changes in sight, considering I actually liked the game despite all the controversy and what not that probably doesn't bode well
---
A related pro tip is to use the whitesprings service entrance when going into the bunker. They have a decontamination shower that you can activate with a button. Wash them rads away, if that is your thing. 
---
its not a bug. scrap the bull stuff manually and you have junk again. they were affected by the mod scrapping fix
---
I'm not the one crying dude. They limited the weight as a partial measure to limit the duping, which many blame on server crashes. 
---
They limited the explosive damage because people didn't like players with duped weapons blowing them up in 1-sided PvP. 
---
I don't do PvP so, no, I wasn't one of the ones complaining. 
---
Still, if you don't like it so much that it's going to ruin your day, find another game. I do understand that some people have fragile temperaments, and don't like it when things don't go their way. Nobody is making you stay though. 
---
Ugh.
---
So sick of hearing this. Not trying to be mean but Its not just TSE weapons. They nerfed two shot, explosive, and two different perks no one asked for. 
---
I am totally fine with it.  They need income to keep the servers running.   A 15 hp buff is de minimis.  
---
Thats because we have to carry several of them and they break in about 30 seconds each lol.
---
Oh man, I bulk everything. 
---
Ya, that was a recent change though when they changed to acid bulk too i beleave.
---
Yeah, I'm going to probably have the same experience after work tonight.   Fully expecting my guns/perks on my main to be completely awful now. 
---
Aren't SBQs are kind of pointless now since they made all of the plans easy to get?  I might need to take a break for a month or something 
---
Little late though i guess 
---
1- "reparing but I have bulk" It took me literally 10 seconds to realize I had to scrap a bulk of gears to fix my turret. So, scrap whatever bulk you need to break it down. Should have been in patch notes though. 
---
That weight bug has been happening to me for forever so not sure what to tell you.
---
XB1 as well. Haven't seen lag and I've been to both Watoga shops and Charleston Station to try to get vendor bot to appear. BUT I'm sure there is lag. Positive actually. 
---
Obviously, I don't expect them to. But still, nice to shout into the night.
---
Starting to feel like most of the game is locked behind the atom shop. 
---
/u/LadyDevann can you please look into this? It'll affect a lot of people.
---
This is only gonna last for a few days, and its to encourage people to wear it around
---
Including Jetpack
---
Yeah exactly, bulking everything does wonders for keeping that stash weight down. 
---
Nice
---
I feel bad for many of you who had to server hop so much to get all this but secretly I am filled with joy because I have been in and out of the hospital since launch and only last week did I even get my first full set of T-51 level 50 power armor. Which vendor is this so that next time I am out of here I can drop by and upgrade my Nuka Cola Power armor?
---
Character skins are such an easy money maker for them. 
---
Do an android/synth skin too, everyone wins! 
---
I refuse to buy atoms, till they offer character skins. 
---
I've been playing since Beta. I've killed millions of scorchbeasts since this bug. Not a single one have the interaction to retrieve sample option like it did when the quest is active.
---
On top of this, the quest will not list as an active quest, thus the flag to the system saying "Retrieve item" is not there...thus no option to retrieve.
---
Are one-use-mods also plentiful, or just plans for mods? 
---
Ya my 2shot explosive lever action went from more than 900 damage to 202 and I can barely kill anything worth killing xp and loot wise. Might just spend more time on my Nintendo switch and keep an eye on future updates 
---
This isn't a group game tho... it's a solo multiplayer
---
In a DLC maybe...
---
I mean he really is like Donald Trump of the Wasteland now. Hes going bankrupt. \*rimshot
---
cool heard that was giving people trouble. disabling show health since I know it modifys the same file
---
Yea I agree, I was melee for so long.  It's also a bummer that more bullets are needed so the stash cap is more of a bind.
---
so,... instead of dealing with the meta (big ass hammers that deal near 10K dmg on a first hit??????), your gonna screw all the gun users...
---
what is 20 and 25% (and demo perk from 100 to 60)... are you guys serious??
---
you fkin nerfed two shot weapons AND explosive weapons so hard this game is barely fun for a gun fighter..
---
i dont have the insane health pool like those special unyielding melee builds, and now i dont have damage either, so a basic deathclaw is a though challenge suddenly.
---
i understand you wanted to balance the TSE weapons, but instead you just screw pretty much everyone that has a two shot (2 bullets = 2x dmg???) and everyone who happens to get a lucky find an get an explosive weapon
---
so what is your explanation please?
---
" **Dev Note:** In looking at the Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks. "
---
so unyielding set + instigating bloody etc + perks = stil more dmg than TSE ever was to begin with..
---
why do you hate your gun-players?
---
you fail to fix game breaking bugs and focus on releasing fucking pink beds, and then u screw ppl over instead of solving your own dupe bug engine ???
---
im just amazed by the ignorance and stupidity at this point.
---
bethesda deserves no less than overkill (otwd got what it deserved for releasing unfinished crap and then barely supporting it and providing hardly no content)
---
https://media.giphy.com/media/Vg0JstydL8HCg/giphy.gif
---
I met a guy who was a hoarder not a duper, i checked his inventory for a trade, nothing but wood armors 1* legendaries etc.
---
He just picks up everything. Hes also only level 64 so he sometimes gives stuff away.
---
He weighed 9000 pounds.
---
Now he's got to get rid of 7500 pounds of stuff before he can do anything else. thats nuts
---
So bobby pins come with the dense mod again?
---
We alerted the Dev's to this
---
u can wear mistress of misteries it is free
---
Sweet another melee build telling us the game is easy.
---
Use scan and repair, and if that doesn't work, reinstall.
---
This is happening on PC too
---
Hell yeah, it's a adventure game
---
Eh, I guess you could argue is a P2W event, but that doesn‚Äôt make the game P2W overall lol
---
You'll still need to server hop if you're looking for weapons, armor, or other items that have been sold by other players. So far I've found 2 TSE weapons that someone sold to a vendor this way.
---
Trust me I understand. I love flamethrowers but can't really use the on this game because how fast things break. I've got a Double Explosive Flamethrower I want to use.... Same with gattling plasma/lasers... Instead I've resigned myself to playing almost pure melee because they can't seem to get things fixed or working properly.

---
 &gt; We alerted the Dev's to this
---
100 percent agree ..well at least I can take a break now from the game ..wife will be happy ...oh also your bulk items dontt count apparently when ur crafting now ...so u have to break em down separately....so fd 
---
just plans
---
So, a literal cut-and-paste job?
---
It's working for me. All my mutes are.
---
Check your Pip and see if they are under that RadX shit where it suppresses them.
---
Also XB1. 
---
As a solo player doing a lot of content without the TSE is insane levels of hard since enemies are bullet sponges once you hit a certain point 
---
BOS plans are only drops, they are never sold at the stores.
---
Yup. Good move.
---
Shame they are mostly useless now after the TSE nerf...
---
What other legendary prefixes are good?
---
Yes and no, the berserker buff adds about 50% to base damage of weapon so it's not over the top good, but still better than Two Shot now. :)
---
You can't take a lot of hits, but with the right perks, it's still very good.  I'm doing White Spring right now and having no problems.  Of course the right weapon helps. :)  In this case that's a Fire Axe with 30% extra to Ghouls and Swing Speed. :)
---
Big fucking mistake!!
---
r/wallstreetbets
---
Why not introduce vending shops that players can initiate?
---
Make it you need to hack it if you want to get into someone elses camp if they have it
---
Notice Bethesda doesn‚Äôt respond to this one
---
Trust me I know I have 1 character no alt or mule. 
---
Luckily we can scrap bulked junk and use the scraps just break it down as you need it. 
---
That sounds like I'm talking about weed.
---
Only gonna work for cap stashes inside of "inner" environments. Keep that in mind. Not a lot of these around as far as im aware.
---
Good to know this has already been flagged!
---
Duping is back? They unfixed the old method? They seriously used an older build for this patch. What a shame.
---
Same people asking for stash increase i suppose 
---
If that‚Äôs the reason why I was fussing sure. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs about when you change the rules. Cosmetic means no benefits. PERIOD. You don‚Äôt suddenly say it‚Äôs ok this one time
---
Yeah I've had mine for months.
---
Which is why I wrote in my post that I understand the utility of this function and how it could help PVPers. I wish more people read the full post before deciding to respond with their knee-jerk reactions (not directed at you).
---
It's a good idea given that PVP is a niche and H/H is not popping. It's a bad idea when you force that information on non-PVPers who have no intention of ever playing H/H, awareness or not. 
---
This is why they should have (and still should) add the opt-out. Trust me, people will still get a chance to see that H/H exists, but those of us who don't have any interest in PVP in this game will be able to avoid seeing repetitive and unnecessary server-wide notifications. 
---
There's an easy and reasonable way to please pretty much all parties here. It just requires that Bethesda consider those of us who don't like seeing spam instead of trying to nudge people into doing something they don't want to do. It's really no different from people complaining about Atom Shop messages popping up on their screen in a purchased game when they have no intention to ever buy from the shop.... which would be reasonable. 
---
Worked hard for months for it to all be taken away in minutes. They really are inept
---
... but it is P2W.
---
They've been saying it for months, and have only nerfed energy weps since then. Good luck.
---
My 'overweight' mules are only overweight because they are mules and I could not be arsed to level them to get the relevant 'weight reducing' perks. In hindsight I sould have because there is zero difference between my lvl 270 character and a lvl 50 one. Moreover my time would probably had been best invested levelling my mules rather than chasing nigh-impossible to acquire plans that now you can just walk up to a vendor and purchase. But again hindsight is 20/20 and this turn of events I could not have foreseen.
---
If I would have both my main and my mules would be running around like spring chickens. Alas they now preventing me for trading with my 'main' and posing a really serious conundrum: do I buy another account, level the characters so they can equip the aforementioned perks and transfer the stuff so I can play again or do I quit? Because there is no way on earth I am dumping resources acquired following the arbitrary way the game developer imposed to the letter due to yet another questionable decision.
---
What baffles me the most is that I keep encountering people defending the indefensible with arguments that do not hold any water.
---
Dragging the servers down? How? I would not have any weight issues if my mules would have the relevant perks. None.
---
Same, only with radaway and super stimps. Have 100 of each. They take up so much weight in my stash.
---
After 160 levels i finally got to a good spot after selling a whole bunch of chems an meds and my weight is 185/275
---
I wonder what ill weigh when i hop on when the patch is done with the d/l
---
Bloody explosive\*
---
The only mod I'm using is the perk loadout one, and I'm getting this issue...am I seriously going to have to decide between atrocious time wasting and being able to sell stuff?
---
Also, if it works, still prolly not worth the loading screens, since they nerfed the caps u may get from one stash to all hells and back.
---
What does the eye of ra do? I have it and never found a use
---
Man, I wish we had a good.mod manager. With this baka shit it could be any file. Instead of deleting the mod archive
---
I'm lvl 111 but also just started new character I can play add me charlomander psn 
---
The best melee weapon I've seen did 300 damage. And some weapons, like the TSE handmade are overpowered because of its fire rate. TSE the dragon does close to 3k damage. 
---
You made no differentiation between hating on the game and on constructive criticism in you post. You just just said ‚Äúif you complain here, quit‚Äù I‚Äôm saying complaining is sometimes necessary to bring issues to light. I do not agree with you that if you complain about this game that means you hate it and should quit. 
---
It's good. I have radium rifle and the little testing I had time to do showed that I don't have to make any major changes to my build.
---
Yaaaaaay nuclear winter!
---
Be a boring Melee Pleb
---
Adrenal Bloodied Build new best damages
---
AAE Weapons 
---
It is not. I never farm for materials and never have an issue repairing anything.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt of nerfed 2 shot from 100% to 20% they should‚Äôve made it a more reasonable 75% it not higher
---
It makes 2 shot weapons way less useful and especially with the rarity of the effect it should be a more powerful one. 
---
Test why? It's obviously WAY stronger especially with 150% dmg from adrenal reaction
---
No CoNtEnT!!! (Played 300 hours)
---
Im 400+ hours in. This last patched fucked it for me. So you telling people on this community to not talk down about the game is doing a disservice to those that should have both POVs available to them to make a logical choice on whether its worth the time investing into it. Im a hardcore FO fan and Ive stuck it out this far to only be disappointed on this last patch. 
---
We got a cap sink. Thank God.
---
With no need to hop plans are plentiful.
---
I have like 1500. Smh. 
---
If it isn‚Äôt then Bethesda should be yelled at for misleading customers, *cough Nuka cola rum, nylon bags, unfinished game, cough*. If so then it‚Äôs obvious why that‚Äôs bad
---
&gt;name an energy weapon worth using.
---
Exactly. In FO4, a plasma rifle is a viable weapon. In '76 it gets scrapped immediately.
---
"Over performing"? Check. "Mandatory picks" ? Check. Could massively (artificially) extend the core gameplay loop while *totally fucking up* player's QoL? Double check. 
---
Sorry to say it, bud, but you might as well quit now. They will definitely nerf 90% carry-weight reduction. It fits the bill a little too perfectly. 
---
Speaking of level caps: apparently I will never be able to complete the "kill feral golfer ghouls" quest because I am too high level. The ones I need to kill only spawn at level 9 (from what I've been told). I've killed tons of ghouls at Whitesprings, but have been stuck at "1/10 killed" for a month. Can we get the spawn fixed so people who have out-leveled the spawn can actually complete that quest?
---
Glass walls and ceilings would be fantastic. More window pieces would be appreciated too for some sets.
---
Hey does anyone know if the Nuka Girl outfit gave her her skin and belly button back yet?  This is my canary in the mine shaft about their general approach to QC.
---
Still no fix for the Fallout Forever trophy, it's my last trophy and it is bugged. So sad :( 
---
You mean THAN, not THEN.  It changes the meaning of your sentence.
---
It'll start as rank 2 card, tho'   ;{}
---
Pretty cool
---
Valid, but I \*think\* that should have been addressed by fixing the per pellet damage of the shot gun... I'd have to do a little more research on that one but it seems that, from what I have read, the the game assigns full damage to EACH pellet.  If this is true, the TSE even at 400+ X 16 pellets... oof!  I would like to see 2 types of ammo for the shotgun.  Shot (divided among the pellets) and slugs (full damage, each projectile).  But then again, no one at Beth seems to know how guns really work.  I mean a .50 bolt action rifle does less than a .308?  Really?
---
I thought this got tested with your test team? 
---
You assume melee is never going to be balanced.
---
Ppl thought the same thing with tse
---
Bruh, why. 
---
The grind in this game has zero flow as it is. 
---
Caps werent worth anything. Now they will be worth something. For a while at least.
---
My favorite thing about his patch is just the animation fix for lever action rifles. No more loading 5 bullets just to add 1 more to the chamber!
---
I had the same issue.
---
Bloodied+e
---
Yeah, I mean I wouldnt care if the vendor cap limit went higher wit≈•h this. But it doesnt. 
---
Yes, please nerf bloodied! And adrenal reaction mutation! 
---
Oh god this'll be all over fucking YouTube now.
---
Closest I think to a pre-nerf would either be Furious on a high RoF or Berserker with hazmat suit. MAYBE a Junkie's but unsure of max damage bonus with it
---
But arent Boring Melee Plebs just griefers? 
---
So, what made all the people who comained in the first place to stay? Its peoples complaining thats got me complaining. You just said it, people were crying about dupers and getting killed in PvP. I dont Pvp. Theres more than just TSE that got effected. I have 1 TSE, and i hardly use it. Its the limitations set upon us by people crying that im complaining about. Numerous perks that have nothing to do with those weapons have gotten changed. I dont want to play anoter game, i want people to stop getting the game i play changed because THEY have a problem.
---
How about fix the fact that i cant use a Targeting HUD without my game crashing? How about they add some new content? How about they find a better way to handle exploiters, rather than doing things that effect those who dont. Theres other things they could be focused on. Theyre blaming the instability on the wrong things. 
---
FalloutMe7 I have not really understood what you say cause of my English but.... yeaaaah it works, the search in container with the perk ! :))) I have to change the title 
---
Sounds normal to me. I was caught a few times last night by a pair of them
---
Personally, none of these legendary prefixes makes me want to log in and try to acquire a weapon with them. They are completely situational and not even that good in that given situation (i.e. 20% dmg increase).
---
Nice, ty for the tip 
---
Seen this an hundred time in PnP RPGs, and it's bad design.  You don't gain customers by making everything in your game suck at the same level.  Instead, you make everything in your game AWESOME but still balanced.  
---
I want to cry at how far back they stepped.  This is bad.  My build is useless and everything weighs too much, costs have increased at vendors and nothing that's bulked counts for crafting.
---
Hey bro update the chat mod the update for it is out and the rest will work with it.
---
Tesla rifle is great! .... for tickling and tagging enemies at whitesprings so you at least get some xp/loot before a real gun kills them
---
yes Discord would be even better.  Then I can share my build with a screenshot.  My Discord ID is RealityAskew#4832
---
I think that is pretty much the only job QA has.
---
If you fucking swear like a fucking shit head nobody is going to fucking listen to your fucking stupid complaint. What the fuck are you fucking fuckity thinking.
---
&gt; I'm assuming its because they don't PVP or don't Touch End Game content.
---
Could it just be that you are cool and they are lame and their opinions don‚Äôt matter?
---
Well they haven‚Äôt been. The patch is today. But yeah it sucks. 
---
Melee is just strap your helmet on and put 15 points in strength and win. Don‚Äôt even need Legendaries lol
---
I mostly agree with the changes and patches. But if I may play the devils advocate, I think a lot of the complaints stem from Bethesda always nerfing things and never buffing anything. 
---
They've reduced spawn frequency on fusion cores, reduced damage on guns and legendary effects, taken away stackable abilities, removed certain bobblehead/magazine locations, lowered ammo drops, taken away duping (thank God for that one.) But there hasn't been anything (that anyone cares about) that says handmades will spawn more often or certain plans will be available more frequently.
---
It's a give and take. When you take away everything that people find enjoyable, they start playing another game. 
---
I, for one, find the two shot nerf ridiculously dumb. It's a TWO shot, not a 1.25 shot. I'm fine with the explosive reduction, though.
---
Just look at the numbers. It was obvious ages ago.
---
9 pt investment gets you 60%
---
2 legendary affixes provide 100% each
---
5pt investment gets you 100% 
---
&gt;I'm now wondering if it's even possible to run queens with large numbers and people with low dps.
---
Yeah, I've been wondering that since they announced the nerf... let me know how it goes! :)
---
LMAO 
---
It's a game. Not the end of the world.
---
Those prices seem high to me. I have purchased calibrated shocks from vendors. And i never paid thousands.......
---
The difficulty is the bloom spawns are RNG and require lots of server hopping.
---
Are they now worth more at vendor? 
---
Ah ha!  That is why my stash is at 607/600!!
---
Same, husband and I had stores as well and now since everything is available all non npc vendors are out of business. 
---
Yup. Same nonsense. Fix 5 issues nobody gives a shit about and break 20 more things in the process. Even more ironic is I bulked all the junk I had last night cus I was bored and had a bunch of plastic and now I get to break them all back down one by one..
---
it cost me 1600 caps as well, level 46. I now have 18 caps to my name
---
Same issue here.  had to re scrap bulk lead to make ammo
---
They really balanced the game now
---
2400
---
Wow you make it to 3 mags on your Gatling Plasma? I finally got rid of mine because it couldnt make it past 1 core without breaking, Even with the durability perks for me.
---
Sweet. I know the character is trademarked but the mask sure isnt. I think it would be popular.
---
Might be true but if you go Bloody build might as well go melee because of how strength equals melee damage
---
Glowing One- \*smacks lips\* BOI I HEARD U WAS TALKING DAT MAD SH\*T!
---
Assaultron- Please no...I didn't ask for this...\*walks away\*
---
I get it, but that is completely anti-fun for players.
---
Right, it is just a waste of time in my eyes. Things that work actively while having them on are just fine, but with a hack or unlock that take at most a minute, that to me is just lame. Especially when you can't de-rank card stacks, I have to lose 3 points of Power User just to turn on 1 or 2 points of lockpicking. 
---
You should at least regression test previous patch changes.
---
Nice work fuckthesda
---
Yeah exactly. I understand the grind was punishing and no one likes server hopping endlessly. But jeez, was there no middle ground? They couldn't just improve the randomized tables instead of making every single plan available to everyone? 
---
My preferred fix for this would be to actually make plan knowledge bound to the account. So, they aren't limited to the character we learned them on. (obviously it's being tracked that way somewhere) 
---
I feel a nerfing was probably needed but this extensive? I literally do less than 1/3 of the damage I used to. Regular shotguns unmodded are almost the same. 
---
Did he piss someone at Bethesda off? Maybe this is all his fault, lol
---
On the contrary the balance changes were well needed. It opens the door for more competitive pvp play, more rewarding pve encounters and legendary weapon diversity to fit different play styles. The only thing they need to do is balance heavy explosive weapons and energy weapons among other lower priority changes,  which takes time and resources from their dev team. Their community managers have said theyd get to that next patch. Its super easy to complain about something , not so much thinking objectively about the positives their patch created.
---
I can't one shot everything in the game anymore?  That's the last straw!  
---
Water purifiers gonna be working overtime
---
Afaik only plans are affected, not items.
---
By making people who break servers stop doing crap to make it hard for other players?
---
I think that's a great idea. 
---
My sense is that Bethesda is trying to tackle things in their order of magnitude. 
---
For example, stopping dupers is a priority because they are largely responsible for server crashes. 
---
The issues with explosive and 2 shot damage was because of the volume of complaints about those mods. 
---
Bottom line is that we'll all get used to the new damage. 
---
There are definitely things they need to fix. What's good is that they are actually fixing them. 
---
I'm sympathetic with you wanting bugs fixed. I'm just tired of the drama. 
---
And if u can, bye bye economy.
---
Level 75 and my strongest weapon is still a legendary walking cane. It's amazing. I put an atom skin on it, and I got marsupial and speed demon, so I practically just fly around murdering everything with a candy cane.
---
Anyone have a good theory crafted post patch TSE Shotty build handy?  I‚Äôve been a bit mixed with a pistol/shotgun build, might have to commit more to one or the other, or try rifles out for a bit.  
---
I guess that's a side effect of all the dupers dropping their shit.
---
This whole nerfing was definitely ill-advised.  I just logged in to check at lunch - my TSE Handmade Rifle now does *less* damage than a rifle I crafted myself with no Legendary effects at all.  How can two exploding bullets do less damage than...sigh.  Nevermind.  I'm screaming into the abyss here.  The dumb decisions will continue, and the community will support it because of PvP.
---
This game is going to shit 
---
You get plans for free by finding them or doing events. You sell them at a lower price than the vendors. Pure profit.
---
The former "server jump until you find rare plans and then sell them at huge profit" era is over, and good riddance.
---
Should be fixed now in the new version.
---
Wow, 2 months later, still not working apparently. I just bought it for one leg on my armor and it's not doing anything. I have marsupial and jet pack too so I'm definitely getting good air. Think I'm gonna scrap it and put in calibrated shocks for carry weight instead so I can ditch my Excavator PA. I have one in the other leg so at least I know that mod works. 
---
You do realize that two shot shotguns just fired 9 pellets instead of 8 right...?
---
I think melee is a whole separate issue.  Good discussion here:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al27a2/if\_tses\_are\_getting\_such\_a\_huge\_nerf\_i\_expect/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al27a2/if_tses_are_getting_such_a_huge_nerf_i_expect/)
---
I knew they'd boost the prices once they made the mods easy to find. Still better than wasting my time trying to find them. Rather grind for caps than server hop.
---
my bad, bad logic, its late I guess, yes it would mean more grind.
---
for some reason I didnt take into account that you would have to level up 3 times to respec 2 stats and stay the same level
---
No, we can't. Although this community already excels at making a mountain out of a molehill, even by their standards this is insignificant. They give you a tiny buff for playing with friends (which most people seem to not do). That's it. This means that all of you have to be in a group, outside of power armor, outside of a hazmat suit. That already severely limits the extent of this "p2w" feature. It's also only going to last until next week. How about we focus on the new issues caused by this update instead of something that doesn't matter?
---
You are getting angry and lashing out at strangers over a video game. Relax. Watch TV for a bit. Read a book. Go on a date with your SO. This isn‚Äôt worth the stress. 
---
Finally, some reason in this sub. Progressive change doesnt happen through perpetual ass kissing. 
---
I would trade away my x01 jet pack for a pair of calibrated shocks for the x-01 
---
Is it just right after logging in or fast travelling?
---
Oh, I understand. So they still let people participate for free just not the full bonus? Kinda jealous of these people who play with a full party all the time ha
---
Can I have your stuff ;)
---
Well, I'm not but ok kid.
---
Wait, are all plans available in shops now? Even the ‚Äúrare‚Äù ones such as jetpack and shocks?
---
And that's fine, I appreciate your positivity.
---
Damn, this meme will never die.
---
I suspect this is how they fixed the issue where mods were getting broken down. I wonder if the same thing happens if you have other junk items which contain components, will they also not break down?
---
I'm hearing reports that the show health mod will cause CTD.  Do you have the mod to not autoscrap weapon and armor mods? That one should be deleted too.
---
ME: I could see myself buying some of these...
---
BETHESDA: 9,000 caps each
---
ME: :shocked picachu:
---
I don't get "extra damage to humans" weapons in this game, the only humans are players so the item is literally useless for PvE.
---
Same with radiation damage weapons like the Radium Rifle, entirely useless outside of PvP because radiation only affects humans and again there are no human enemies. 
---
I broke down some bulk but it won‚Äôt let me repair my leather armor. It says I don‚Äôt have the resources but I do!
---
Jesus christ, you guys just fixed it last patch and now it's been reverted back what the actual fuck BGS?
---
Pft, version control.  Everyone doing what they like as they like and saving it in random locations has always been good enough for me.  
---
Now, if you'll excuse me, there seems to be something wrong with the pod bay doors and the lads are shouting something about a reactor breach.
---
Seriously, there needs to be a general "how to be organised" branch of programming education, taught alongside a "you don't know more than everybody else" course.
---
If you play Xbox one , &amp; if I do quit yeah sure !!
---
Its even worse.... i dont know how many of you are on 21:9 but they have fucked that up again as well leaving weird stretched aspect ratio and shit floating off the right hand of screen as well as what was properly aligned to the left and right being back in the middle of the screen again.   Bethesda,  im sorry - you guys really suck!  This game was finally enjoyable.   You just ruined it.
---
You are clearly in wrong genre. It would be same good as I would go into Fallout 4 and tell how stupid it is that there is no PVP and other players.
---
So you're saying for only your monthly subscription fee as well as the cost of two consoles you can mule your own stuff?
---
What if I told you I can run two instances of the game on my PC and the game is on clearance for $20?
---
Until the next nerf. If a 75% drop is what they call balance I‚Äôd be anxious if I were melee doing 1k+
---
I'm thinking of just using a tesla for the same purpose.  At least use my fusion cells for something.
---
Do you have any other characters on your account that are over the weight limit?
---
I'd rather play the game than server hop
---
I've been logged on for about 5 minutes now. No overencumbered messages and I can sprint
---
Peeps in other posts are saying bulk mats are fucked up too- 
---
Except for wespon styles that suck with vats and stealth. Rip heavy, explosive, and energy. Oh and rip pistol since it isn't even fit the required perks.
---
It‚Äôs obviously an unforeseen and unanticipated impact of the scrap changes ... I cannot imagine Bethesda expects us to scrap bulks necessary to make an item and/or repair every time.   That is just, well, stupid ... I encountered this today making a Handmade Rifle and worked out myself what they had done and laughed to myself ...
---
Some of the fixes were great but i feel they missed the bar to an extent here. I love this game but, i need something new and fresh here... I could careless about PvP at this point. I want a working and stable game!!
---
I've never been able to search any container twice in the same day. I just did a couple server hops with cap stashes now, and was not able to search again on the same stashes.
---
Nope. Just the one character 
---
Not working for me, just showing vendors plans as before, is it a switch in settings somewhere? On PC.
---
You misread my comment. 
---
Calibrated shocks used to be much cheaper at vendors.
---
Less than 1k caps. 
---
Now they are much more expensive at vendors. 
---
Meaning the ones I already bought will sell to players for MUCH more on market. 
---
I just got the fusion generator plan. Read it, trying to build but my workshop says I don‚Äôt have enough of some materials, I absolutely have more than enough of all materials required to build it, but the materials I have don‚Äôt all show up under the required parts to build area of my workshop when I‚Äôm trying to build the generator. Anyone know about this?
---
If that's all that is left to this game until new content, it won't last much longer losing half the life support it had on rare plans.
---
But not as satisfying
---
I just bought excavator shock plans for 22k 3 days ago. The very first one I'd every seen available for trade. 
---
It shouldn't be normal for the scorchbeast to constantly hit me with the screech. I could barely even move or see. 
---
What did they do with the Eggs? Did they lower the amount again? Because I remember when they changed how it works with green thumb in the first patch
---
Great job making your game worse! 
---
That's not how it works.
---
The bullet explodes on impact dealing separate explosive damage on top of the base damage of the shot. It used to explode for 100% of the shots damage, now it will be 20%. Think of it as you get shot, taking damage, then that shot explodes, dealing more damage. 
---
In order for the shot and explosive damage combined to do the same damage as a non-legendary you would have to Reduce the shots damage to account for the additional damage dealt by the explosion. 
---
Ah, cool.  Thats good to know, thanks.  
---
yeah exactly..
---
just forget it lol... 
---
bethesda too busy digging their own grave with the fucked up pink beds and stuff instead of fixing bugs and providing the content that would be worth the 60 euro i paid for this half baked miscreant of a game
---
You have a point... it's like using a squirt gun to wet them and that counts as you doing damage so you still get loot.
---
It's a billion dollar company, they don't get to play some sort of scrappy underdog, if they only hired a bunch of kids just into the big city for the first time who couldn't afford to make the game right then this should not have been a 60 dollar game or should not have been given a AAA release or the use of a major IP.   
---
I know, Ive been purchasing a lot of plans in the recent weeks, thats also why I immidiately noticed. Although I have hunted most of the plans I wanted already, it still feels bad, especially if I imagine the situation for new players (honest ones lmao)
---
You found one? And yeah, i'm always up for shredding the wasteland! The TSE nerf has only made the game more fun so far for me!
---
On the plus side, "until the game crashes" is never all that long.
---
  *Fallout is supposed to be a PVE solo player game* \- They said right from the start this was not a solo PVE game.  Older Falloutgames were solo PVE, this one is not.  You bought it, you should have known what you were buying.
---
 *You're nursing the guns that are making the game fun I understand nerfing it a little bit but your guns do hardly any damage to enemies it takes me 40 rounds to kill a high-level Super Mutant -* Just a bit of embellishment here.  I was just killing lvl 68 Super Mutants with a player crafted lever action rifle and it was only taking 3-4 shots.
---
  *I don't know if I'm going to stick around long enough for you guys to make your next big content drop for PVE cuz the games getting nerfed and I don't know if I'll be back at all for this game.*  \- Completely your right to quit the game.  If being overpowered is the only way this game is fun for you, then perhaps play another game you can mod up to be god mode and play that.
---
&gt; As of 1/10 patch, when trading with another player and using Z/C to move the quantity slider, it no longer stops at zero and wraps back around to the highest value
---
Ugh yes this is so annoying! Happens on PS4 as well even when just trying to sell to a vendor or remove items from the stash.
---
&gt;Sort holotapes (when loading them into a terminal) either alphabetically, or put quest tapes/US Requisition tapes at the top. Preferably both
---
Yes! If they won't show just the quest holotape, at least put them in alphabetical order so we can find them.
---
I was just joking though, i tested both weapons and it takes 5 rounds to kill a warlord with TSE gatling gun and 3 to 4 rounds with the shotgun. The game is, more challenging again. Idk about SBQ though 
---
You are correct, I just logged in to check myself. Every single power armor mod for any of the T class power armor are available at Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga.
---
Ah, gotcha. I was reading it the other way around. So, since I often bulk my lead to save some weight, the game won't recognize I have bulk lead and auto scrap it if I run out of scrap lead. 
---
Thanks for the clarification. 
---
take this shit offline and fix it... you guys fucked up!
---
I agree. As I mentioned in another thread, now that you can buy all your plans in a day or two (just have to get all your caps!) ... what are you going to do while waiting for new content to drop? I enjoyed hunting for plans. I didn‚Äôt server hop, I just looked at the different stations each time I played, and traded with others. Now all of that is moot.
---
I was having what little fun I could have with my explosive build. Everything weighed so much, teammates ran in front of me and I died constantly I killed myself constantly, and ammo costs tons. I guess I'll be trying to go full heavy or rifle/2 melee. 
---
Excuses. Nerf!!!
---
I looted it before i even knew about the dups. And you a bitc. I earned them in that game too. Wow that must make you feel special. 
---
The good news is that it is just annoying. It can‚Äôt kill you even in level 25 excavator armor. You die from not noticing other mobs attack you during the screech. Stay vigilant for that and you are fine. 
---
I would say the flamer does it too but fuel is too damn expensive
---
I can't help but agree with you on a lot of the things you wrote. My only reply would be that Bethesda is probably chasing fires to extinguish non stop and the reason for the nerfs hitting first, and hardest, is due to porting FO4 into multiplayer mode.  
---
The game was already unbalanced as a single player game. Porting it to a multiplayer game highlighted a lot of severe issues that may not have been widely known before.  I think this is why we've seen so many nerfs and no buffs. Their hair is on fire with an imbalanced game and they are in damage control mode.  Once imbalances are smoothed out they'll probably have more time to focus on improving the deficiencies that have been found.  
---
Two shot definitely didnt need a nerf, the accuracy and recoil penalty alone prevented the double damage from taking place most of the time anyway.  
---
It was the explosive rounds and bobble stacking that were in need of serious adjustment.  
---
I mean I'd take it, but something tells me approximately 0 of the affected perks were regularly used (except for the explosion one, and you had to know it was getting a nerf at some point).
---
sorry to say but the weight limit is account based. you have one character overweight and they all get locked.
---
So, are fusion cores back to being recharged after loggin in in PA?
---
Your opinion does not provide you some kind of magical protection against criticism... Particularly when it is semi-petulant whining over a game... an item in the game that is ultra rare and about 90%+ of the player base doesn't even own. 
---
The majority of people cannot relate to your complaining, nor do they care. 
---
Then of course, you are saying TSE is still useless, when combined it is STILL providing +45% base damage bonus+area affect. Useless? jesus christ dude. In a broad based nerfing of things, TSE still remains elite in the "new normal" post patch. 
---
self awareness and perspective. That is why you are attacked.  
---
Yea, me too. And this is a dramatic post complaining about how everyone elses drama is effecting the game. 
---
Im glad they are actually doing things, but i dont know if they are actually doing the right things.
---
I havent had a problem with server stability since i learned i should take my helmet off. So what did this patch do to help that?
---
So we need to guess and buy plans first *then* the UI tells us if we know it??
---
Yeah, just waiting for someone to confirm that duping is back... 
---
Hilarious.  They surely are now the worst game studio on the planet.  It takes real skill to fuck it up this badly.
---
I don't mind the TSE change but nerfing demolitions is a huge bummer. It's hard already to make grenades useful, and because of springs they are expensive to craft (i.e. I almost always need springs for something else). 
---
Just nerf everything. All problems solved.
---
Ill add when I get home form work! (around 4pm EST)
---
It's untrue. Explosive Bobble head stacking lart people one shot her.
---
exactly,
---
because they cannot fix the bugs they created, they just nerf everyone instead.
---
workarounds ftw, and hey.. as long as people buy pink beds.. who cares !!
---
So the base damage of a Power Fist is 75? Hm?
---
Yet you can reduce carry weight of certain items to near 0 values? Armour pieces that reduce the weight value of food aid ect. in one by 20% stacked 5 times mixed with the perks that do the same I wonder what this would do the server with relative carry weights. 
---
E.g. a level 1 character with 1,500 carry weight would be less of an issue than a level 50 with 1,800 carry weight with weight reduction perks and armor pieces? Reductions chappy at 90% and someone carry just that item to sell would be able to carry 18,000 relative carry weight to the level one mule.
---
Next up has an consideration been taken into mass item dumps causing server crashes? I lost a fully modes set of T60 armour by merging two sets I was using and the server crashing at the same time. I refuse to use the armor (despite loving it) until it is safe to combine and tweak sets. This mixed with potential server crashes as people drop 20,000 carry weight for the next week could cause significant issues.
---
Mirelurk Queens are my worst nightmare. 
---
Wait really? How the hell did they manage to screw that up? So it is literally my imagination making me think my shotgun is doing more damage?
---
Does the extra pellet have the combined power of the regular 8 pellets? Because I swear the stats image still shows double damage 
---
&gt;Cap stashes: Always making cap stashes rewarding is great. Fortune finder is a MUCH better perk now. I've used it for hours without finding a single stash before. Now I can know that it'll show me stashes at least a good portion of the time.
---
as far as i can tell (i haven't tested it extensively yet), they either appear to have removed more cap stashes or cap stash containers are not a consistent spawn (or both). my preferred cap stash farming location seems to be missing 2 spawns that were there previously that i couldn't get to show up at all with multiple world hops. i looted one stash at kanawha that wasn't there on the next hop, but i looted a stash at poseidon that *was* there on the next hop, so i'll have to do more testing.
---
the cap collector perk is also currently Fucking Broken, which sure is great! glad they tested it before they rolled it out. you're supposed to be able to "search" cap stash containers for additional caps, but that option is completely absent. incredible.
---
i get about 1 cap per stash on my 1 luck character and 16 caps per stash on my 15 luck character, so the number appears to be directly tethered to the luck stat. unless cap collector awards a *significant* number of caps, there's no point in a daily gathering route because you'll just spend most of them on fast traveling from spawn to spawn. on top of that, unless they've added more back to the world in random tucked-away corners, you are now *less* likely to just casually encounter them as a fun little bonus while exploring.
---
so far it ain't looking great. we'll see after they fix the broken perk.
---
It isnt that it wasn't op. It was. But it was supposed to be. Remove the weapons all together if you don't want to deal. These nerfs show that Bethesda is just appealing to the ignorant cries of the masses.
---
Nope, loyal base member here and still in favour of Beth. Yep, they increased the prices. Oh well. Guess I won‚Äôt be able to have everything I want, right now!
---
There is a hidden buff to PA and hazmat that reduces rads dramatically.  How do we know?  We stacked a ton of radiation resist and noticed that at 800 we had more than a stock suit of X-01 yet were still taking \~18 rads/sec in a nuke zone while Jhonny Powerarmor dude is taking &lt;1 rads/sec.  
---
So no, there is no way to get enough rad resist to join a nuke zone without PA or a hazmat suit.
---
Imo not the same, cuz I never had 400, but always 300. Something has defenitely changed.
---
/u/Ladydevann and /u/Valseek, this is good work and matches my experience as well. Targeting HUD is definitely causing CTD.
---
Lol. This patch broke The game soolo Bad its not ev n playable anymore....
---
The thing is you could use a TSE Shotgun without any drawbacks... Not so much with bloodied.
---
your argument would hold water if they were addressing those issues..  
---
I have yet to get a response on Legit bugs to the point I provide, in detail, the fix.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/
---
We got dem nerfs tho
---
And waste plastic in the process.  And add another step.
---
I'm not arguing they coded the game right. I agree this SHOULDN'T be an issue and you should be able to hoard to your hearts content. It IS an issue based on the way the game was developerd though and it needed fixed. I complete refit of their database could take months (and I hope they do it) but this brings much needed server relief NOW which i fully support.
---
Quite unreasonable that the mods for T model PAs are almost 10x that of the X0-1
---
I've been told that's exactly what has to happen: someone low has to go through to cause the low level mobs to spawn.
---
I shouldn't have to rely on a newbie making it through Whitesprings so I can complete my quest. I should be able to do it on my own. 
---
Seems a simple fix to just let golf ghouls spawn at higher levels.
---
Ah hate ta say it but I think yer wifes got the scorch. We're gon hafta put er down. We gots a nation to rebuild
---
easy isn't fun though.
---
no one gives a shit about your stupid friends.
---
What a fantastic knowledge of programming you have just displayed. 
---
Bot issues?
---
It's was still double damage. That 1 pellet carried 100% of the damage.
---
Hahaha, unreal.  Hey, at least you have a belly button, mine disappeared in the 12/5 patch and was replaced with a flesh rainbow of sub textures.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9rbdw/pics_of_the_nuka_girl_costume_glitch/
---
Yep and the plans are 7200 caps without hard bargain.
---
I think the issue is that it dropped the quest midway through, probably because I had logged out or something in the process, which is why it's not giving me the grab sample option. It only shows as a completed quest for me but no option to actually pick it back up. 
---

 &gt; I understand your frustrations, and this is definitely something that we're talking to the Dev's about.
---
R.I.P in peperoni
---
White knight and plumber were seriously OP...  I haven't repaired my armor for about 20 hours of play...  that includes my last 5 SBQ fights and all the other random wasteland shenanigans.
---
It will still work and still be worth the points, just that now we will actually have to repair our armor every 2 or 3 sessions (assuming you play a few hours a session).  And, assuming that the cost per piece at 2 Ballistic fiber, that is a mere 10 fiber every week.  I have a couple hundred saved because I actually pick it up and haven't needed to use it to repair (hello white knight) more than twice a month.
---
Seriously, hit the brakes on the damn drama train.  
---
Whats next?  Gas prices go up 50 cents on the gallon and you decide to drive your car into a ravine and walk everywhere?
---
The point is less grind. Do you really like server hopping? There is a certain plan I want, that I've tried unsuccessfully to get from a certain event 45 times. The stupid event only spawns maybe every 4 - 7 hops, so that means I've server hopped anywhere from 180 to 315 times just in the hope that **one** event will spawn, and I'll then, against all odds, receive the plan I want.
---
That. is. not. fun. 
---
(Eh, for me anyway.)
---
Still no Stash Capacity increase?!?! 
---
Thanks!!! 
---
I hope so
---
In this particular situation, the cries were not ignorant, TSE was massively overpowered, overused, and duped to oblivion, and something had to be done. Before, most of the people you saw in-game were using some sort of two shot explosive, and now not only they can continue using it, because it's still good, naybe they'll  try other weapons and give some variety to the game, because TSE is no longer 10x better than everything else. Like I said, the nerfs were not that bad, since it's still one of the best legendary combination. Granted they didn't need to nerf the Demolitions perk because that also nerfs completely different weapons. And melee still needs a nerf too, but this was a good start.
---
What a bunch of dipshits
---
This is great, guys. Thank you. I can‚Äôt wait to get home to update and play.
---
I just hope they add more functionality to taming. I'd love to have a Beastmaster sort of build with an animal companion. Allow us to modify their attack/functions via Charisma perks etc. 
---
Nope, cuz I get 200 extra weight now.
---
my rule of thumb is if you dont wanna fight dont get a workshop it attacts people who want to pvp
---
Yes we had similar issued on Monday night, one of our team ates was permanently enemy/bountied even though he was in team and on pacifist. We all just hopped and lost our workbenches but solved the issue. 
---
We knew there was no new content coming with this patch... This isn't a surprise. It would have been a surprise if they HAD added anything.
---
By fixing damage and bobblehead stacking as well as a few other dupe glitches they are making PvP more palatable.
---
I might even try it now.
---
SHWING
---
I suspect that 90% of the shmucks raging over the nerfs right now fall under that category.
---
Agreed 
---
How bad did this hurt the mini? I was leveling a heavy just for the TSE I got. I'll hold onto it, because I like the other stuff (movement speed while aiming and STR), but if it's too bad, I'll just go back to my crafter and hope for the best. 
---
Duping, some things related to events, carry weight... a bunch of things back to being broken don't know wtf is going on. Just lift your arms and enjoy the ride. 
---
Gotta say white knight took a beating. But to be fair, I had started selling ballistic fiber.
---
You will need a minimum of 2.5k caps to do it on your own and possibly up to 6k, you must find a ghoul captain, travel to whitesprings for next one, fast travel, fast travel, fast travel, fast travel.
---
You burn up so much money its not even funny, its designed like crap there is no reason the mission shouldn't just update you with the next location modus can speak directly to you after all.
---
I have 25k caps and nothing to spend it on. Can‚Äôt even go around and make caps because I‚Äôm maxed out. 
---
The game isn‚Äôt suppose to give you hand outs, it‚Äôs not fun. 
---
So is the problem high level enemies or the queen?
---
And downvoting the OP, so much salt ;)
---
i want to believe there can be an end to the dumb. :/ 
---
Bro if I had some Reddit Gold to give you I would because that was f****** amazing
---
And it‚Äôs the same hierarchy issue as they had with new Vegas. The higher ups are making bad decisions that spiral down to the dev teams. All I‚Äôm trying to get at is that‚Äôs it‚Äôs more papa bethesda/Zenimax‚Äôs fault in this case for poor management than directly the developers fault. You‚Äôve got the art and story and everything coming from Bethesda HQ and a small team of about 15 or so forcing multiplayer into an engine that was never meant to be multiplayer. If they wanted to, they could license out an engine or put a bigger team on the creation of a multiplayer capable engine that doesn‚Äôt have 25 years worth of code that makes it incompatible with multiplayer ideologies, but papa zenimax didn‚Äôt want to spend the money so we got what we got. 
---
Tl;DR don‚Äôt blame the devs, blame the money hungry upper management 
---
I'd rather the game work before they add to it
---
&gt;Addictions are too hard to acquire
---
So the opposite of real life. So, so the opposite.
---
You can blame the dupers for the explosive and two shot nerfs.
---
I'm more looking forward to the valiant ~~excuses~~ defence of Bethesda that will come out of this. 
---
But then you won't have to buy trash tier skins from the Atom store if you want to look different. Can't have that, better hold of on private servers till the game is almost dead.
---
Technically it is p2w. You pay for an item and get a boost from it. Even if it is limited time. You‚Äôre still getting a boost. That‚Äôs an unfair advantage to someone who didn‚Äôt buy it.
---
Fixed it! There was already an update on the text chat mod today.  
---
Thnx for mentioning this problem ;)
---
that was supposed to fixed with this patch as well
---
It's dumb and violates the ToS for the game. Hope they all get permabanned.
---
Aside from the known plans and availability, this patch was a bummer.
---
I've been gladly enjoying my TSE combat shotgun for a while now and agreed they were slightly overpowered, but after today using it is going to turn into more of a grind than anything. Normally I go through about 300 shells/hr with about a level every 1.5, but now I'm using 4 times as many to kill a 68 muttie; it was a drag enough begging people to trade their ammo and now that just got much worse. The weapon is only dealing 250 which doesn't make it much better than a regular combat shotgun - 350/400 would have been fair.
---
I don't know why I'm going to bother playing this game anymore. It's likely you'll need to create a new character for survival anyway so why are we dumping our time into this game?
---
I guess the only thing I have to be thankful for is the demotivation; looks like I'll be a good degenerate now and focus more of my time towards wrapping up college instead of the pleasure brought to me escaping to the world's I enjoy.
---
Ah my first server was crashing after 2 minutes. I think that was a bad start after patch haha. My mule would have the same problem now haha
---
Really... This is crazy. Apparently I mastered the available mechanics to let me carry fuck ton of stuff. Now I have no idea what to drop. 
---
Why allow someone to carry a lot with perks but then restrict them to a number that isn't displayed on their pipboy. So I'm not over encumbered but I can't buy a single plan... This is fucked
---
My stash if full of legendaries because I thought player vending was coming soon. I have no recourse but taking all perks off and dropping the heaviest stuff. This sucks. Fuck dupers for carrying 10 k pounds 
---
No they no longer respawn you just get one set a day now
---
Maybe you are the extreme minority? I can tell you there's a ton of people running around that no amount of weight reduction perks is going to get them to the limit specified. Straight up ridiculous hoarding. They are definitely dragging the server down.
---
Yes, agree this is so bad. Making the game worse for a lot and not adressing all the useless weapons. I fully support the nerf of TSE but TS nerf??!! Really???? Lucky i got a heavy strength build so i guess i am full melee again.
---
So i guess next patch nerf all melee to the ground. The gutsys are right communism is bad....
---
Except that your weapon would kill you occasionally if anything gets too close.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwZP95xaBnw
---
"Overpowered."
---
Yes, we can all rest assured that these developers tested their proposed nerfing numbers extensively to ensure the best experience for everyone. Nobody should think for a minute that they just pulled this out of their ass.
---
Not to mention what they did to White Knight Perk. WTF? They didnt fix anything in my opinion. They just made a few adjustments hoping it would balance things out... They missed the mark.
---
I was really hoping this patch would fix broken challanges. Daily and weekly challanges are pretty much all I do now and they are always buggy. 
---
Nope. Just tried it on PS4
---
5500 caps can be made in 4 days of selling items to vendors. I've spent far more time than that in some games grinding for items.
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve repaired each armor piece once and that was only to get it to 200% conditioning. With max white knight I haven‚Äôt repaired any of my armor since then and I‚Äôve had this build for at least 30 levels.
---
Everyone duped using dog meat in fo4
---
Or quarter shot boom boom, cause some people want the nerf to ONLY apply to legendary affixes. So change it to something else I guess? If they aren't going to do what the legendary effect STATES, then remove the weapons, don't settle in some bastardised middle ground. The affixes are SUPPOSED to be overpowered as they are. Also meant to be alot rarer. But exploiters combined with cry babies ruined it all for us. Bethesda is trying to do the right things, and I applaud them, but the majority, which they are listening to, are ignorant.
---
Saying any explosive weapon they see was a two shot, wielded by a duper nonetheless.
---
Being too dense (pun intended) to research counters in pvp for these types of weapons. Just so anybody knows, dense and fireproof nullify explosive weapons, so the nerf was strictly PVE.
---
Being casual players (not blaming anyone for this, life happens) and not having the time to grind for or buy good legendaries, and therefore complaining when having kills stolen, being killed by, having their camps destroyed by these types of weapons.
---
Lol, have an upvote!
---
Fuk.... worst new ever. 
---
To ba faaaaiiiiiiir
---
Where am I complaining about my tse minigun? It needed a nerf. That isn't my only tse, I had about 7 others that I don't give 2 shits about what I care about is how low damage heavy weapons are. My tse miniguns damage was about 80 with a couple perks which is of course a lot of damage for a minigun but the base damage of the weapon was about 40 which isn't even that high for a TSE weapon. The default damage of a minigun in my opinion should be around 20 to make it on par with other weapons which is not that far off of the base two shot weapon damage.
---
The durability comes in even worse compared to other guns. I also use the 50 cal and previously I used an instigating fat man and the bunker buster. I threw both of the explosive away because of the dps.
---
My main complaint (if you read my post) is that they are bringing down an already underpowered class of weaponry just to balance the two shot explosive guns. It shows how little they really are listening because they pick the biggest complaint "TSE" and just nerf whatever they need to fix it without thinking of other problems in other areas. If they actually listened to the months of people talking about how underpowered heavy weapons were then they wouldn't have done this.
---
New content should be coming around March, afaik. Think I read that somewhere on this sub.
---
From the right perspective it is absolutely hilarious. I'm the world's worse coder but I know enough to know that this is the equivalent of running yourself over with your own car in terms of stupid mistakes.
---
"dont tell me how to plaaaaaaaay, I only have an hour to play a week. That entitles me to do whatever I want &gt;:("
---
You have quite the vocabulary. You definitely aren't making yourself look ridiculous right now.
---
What‚Äôs your point? You bought something last week and saved a lot of imaginary game money?
---
So two shot is now basically a X1,25 shot? So the name is incorrect now because two bullets would mean double damage and not X1,25.
---
When you walkin' away having "won" the argument and she mutters something under her breath
---
"Wanna run that by me again??"
---
BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!
---
Never seen em on a vendor myself, only got them as event drops. Maybe check all the vendors including the more obscure ones?
---
Well that's nice news for a broke individual such as myself!
---
And i would pay another $10 for a hokey mask...
---
No their guns are weak. I had 6 points into commando with a level 50 assault rifle and it took about 20 shots to drop certian enemies. Idc for explosives but i like high powered machine guns. What wrong with that. I went little over. But theres a problem with making LMG with .308 rounds a damage of 18? I think it takes about 40 rounds with that. Ive tested all their wepons and different builds. 
---
Sounds good, talk with you then.
---
True it has less defense at base value... however there aren't any legendary effects on PA.  You can make a set of legendary armor that is near god mode pvp, have fall damage immunity, massively reduce (or possibly negate) item weights, blah blah blah, etc etc etc.  
---
It is give or take.  Not be given so you can also take.  Look at both sides of the scenario.
---
The rad resist issue of normal armor sure as hell needs looked at though.  Hidden modifiers to hazmat and PA for rad resist is straight up bullshit.
---
I'd like to see an option for long hair, or more hairstyles in general. :)
---
Since you have a lot of expenses with 76 I was wondering if you knew if Fusion Cores are supposed to spawn inside Power Armor Chassis'? That's what I've heard but I've yet to find one like that
---
I know nothing about programming and have never claimed otherwise.  Probably why Bethesda keeps trying to hire me as a dev.
---
Yeah why wouldn‚Äôt they just increase a refresh rate a little? 
---
Idk to me they should be working on content.  This game is lacking a purpose other than grinding for materials armor and weapons you can‚Äôt afford to store 
---
No, I believe you.
---
Come on Beth don't ruin this game. Step it the fuck up. 
---
There was a need to balance tse's but I thought it was going to be a lot less than what happened. The demo nerf is what hurt the most I guess. The 40% hit not only the meta TSE users but it affected the minority who played DEMO Explosive users. People who wanted to use Missile launchers and Fat mans. 
---
At the moment all it did was make ballistic users far weaker and make the new meta to be melee. 
---
They have a choice when they try that crap with me. Either find something else to attack or die. I'm not leaving because I was here first minding my own business. I don't like bullies no matter where they come from. I keep a gauss rifle on me just for them. 
---
People paid actual cash?! Bruh I only paid 300 caps for mine. Yeah i don't feel sorry for those folks lol
---
I mean, why would they?
---
As a community manager your job is 3 things.  Interact with the community in a positive manner, take suggestions and feedback from the community to the dev's, and most importantly; don't kick the beehive and make it worse.
---
They can do the first in positive threads, they can do the second in any thread without commenting, and the 3rd one is just making sure you don't interrupt a circle jerk.
---
Of course they aren't going to chime in on the moanfest.  It's lose/lose situation that no one would be happy with.
---
Ah, as you were then. Martial artist totally doesn't affect gatling gun fire rate
---
Okay... So this is a bug... Fuck. So I took all perks off and armor that effects objects weight.
---
My carry weight is then. 175. With 1092 over. According to the patch notes I'm fine. Yet I try to buy from a vendor and it says I'm over the limit.
---
I then go find some loot that is for sure heavier than a singular plan from a vendor. I can lock them up and drop them no problem. 
---
So I can pick up 5 or 6 plasma cores but not a single  plan? Anyone with this issue? Cause according to their calculation I'm a few hundred pounds under their limit 
---
try to use tesla. it is more good than people think. 
---
Plans and Recipes: When viewing a plan or recipe in a menu, a ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù tag will now appear next to the names of recipes and plans the player has already learned.
---
AWESOME. Such a huge Q.O.L change
---
&gt;This is how to make people quit your MMO 101
---
Fixed that for you.
---
I guess. The numbers were wonky.
---
9 pts to get 60% more damage is the norm.
---
Two shot was 100%
---
Explosives were 100% and for a whopping 5pts that becomes 200%
---
Tse with 5 perk points nets you 300% more damage.
---
Or 9 pts for 60%. Would take 45 pts to match.....
---
Please buff energy weapons and especially the Alien Blaster!
---
"New people"
---
&gt; doesn't know who to blame. 
---
I'm sorry. A bug in software slipping through QA isn't reason to fire a group of people. 
---
I died a lot more than any bloodied player with this explosive build I ran.
---
Do you happen to play melee?
---
At least now you'll be able to explore and kill enemies for cap grinding instead of just server hop for plans. 
---
50ish:)
---
Buy buy buy
---
Perhaps this has been mentioned before or I haven't thought it out well enough but here's my 2c. I think if a player gets a bounty above his caps just stop them from doing damage.  To fix this they'd then have to die, and gather caps again, probably upwards of 300 to even make PVP worthwhile again. 
---
Or outright remove PVP once PVP only servers come out. 
---
I feel taking things away from us instead of adding new content months after release is just another reason to maybe check back in a few months rather than go down with the ship hopefully by next year fo76 will be as fun as the other fallouts
---
At least you'd be able to sleep during the day since you wouldn't have anything else to do anymore.
---
God damn dude, I agree with your original post. But your comments. You need to calm down. 
---
Its not the same price though, vendors pricing seem's to be effected by players level.
---
Hey ! They worked pretty hard on this patch! lots of new stuff.
---
It more like 25 more rounds
---
Red rocket pictures. Taken 3 now and those aren't registering either. 
---
The new atom stuff sucks big time. 
---
See I would just blame the higher ups if the fix for most of these bugs wern't already out there. It would have only taken them studying the code from all the unofficial patches to fix it. It is insulting that modders fixed these issues without access to the source code. It shouldn't matter if it wasnt worth it they should of fixed these issues since among them was quite a few game breaking bugs. The fact that they became so complacent on modders makes them lazy and incompetent.
---
I'll take making money over having to server hop for hours and still get nothing.
---
Indeed, I wish they had saved the plans for rewards in the faction wars that were supposedly coming soon. Imagine you could earn said Jet Pack plans through obtaining a rank with the Brotherhood of Steel and can trade those plans with someone in an enemy faction for something of equal value, sounds much better than "let's grind caps until the end of time."
---
This patch brought a mild inconvenience when crafting ammo using bulk materials. If lead is bulked, it will no longer give you the ability to craft ammo until it is scrapped. From what I remember, even if it was bulked it would simply display the amount in "scrap lead" and automatically break down bulked material based on how much you use. Now it requires you to go into your stash and manually break down any bulked materials. 
---
And here I've been ripping through enemies in a few shots with my non-legendary handmade. I had no idea it was useless.
---
The perks exist.  Its just that even with all of them some weapons still break super fast.
---
Gunsmith(5) makes weapons last 50% longer.
---
Weapon Artisan(3) lets you repair them to 200% durability.
---
Luck of the Draw(3) randomly gives you bonus weapon durability (not sure if this works with durability values over 100%).
---
I use all of these (11 points total) and my heavy/explosive weapons still don't last as long as I'd like, especially considering how weak they are.  I wouldn't mind the low durability if they were powerful weapons that you are only supposed to use in dire situations, but currently they are barely adequate for everyday gameplay.  Compared to melee/shotguns I am expending a ton of extra resources/carry weight to barely even compete with their damage.
---
Just take it offline, drag it out behind the shed, and shoot it at this point. 
---
I don't know man, maybe stop making excuses for this game? You paid them to buy this, they didn't pay you.  They don't need your defense. 
---
Man... I was looking forward to finishing my heavy just for this build. I'll hold onto it, but I guess it's back to melee. Glad I had strength anyway
---
Good, now I can throw it away and all the atoms I just spent on the chrome skin for it.
---
"It just works"
---
Nah, even with the +100, my NON PA can carry more due to the -20% weight reduction legendary item's I've been lucky enough to find. What I really need is excavator shocks so I can truly hoard to my full potential.
---
I'm okay with cazadores because they aren't as scary. They might be tough but they don't make shit your pants everytime you see them.
---
Now Centaurs on the other hand.....
---
I just tested this thoruhgly, removed each stack of bulked materials, scrapped them and put them back in my stash. The only thing that gained weight was Lead (I have no bulk aluminium which I believe also saves weight when bulked)
---
My stash gained 19 pounds from unbulking the lead, it gained zero pounds for unbulking everything else.
---
Poor guy had dreams of working in American but this was definitely not what he pictured
---
Damn straight. Nothing says "fun" like the 20th or 50th hop in a row to find rare plan.
---
I think it‚Äôs just another form of scarcity.  They want ppl to grind to achieve certain things.  I‚Äôm wondering if they chose this approach to stop the server hopping to get an edge on the vendor inventory.   The assumption being that all of the hopping was putting a strain on the system.  This way ppl will grind on one server as opposed to hopping over 20.
---
On PC :)
---
I agree completely that TSE combination was overpowered. They are supposed to be. I feel the weapons should have been removed all together if people couldn't handle them. The cries were ignorant because they did not need a nerf. Either remove them or let them do what they STATE. The cries were ignorant because of the ones crying, who refused to counter these weapons with things like dense and fireproof, and instead took to bitching at Bethesda. Things need to be buffed up to level, not nerfed down to. An acceptable solution would be to have it at 50% like fallout 4 (two shot) and not even touch the explosive affix. The demolition perk nerf was the ONLY acceptable thing they did. They brought it in line with other damage buffing perks. The Bobbleheads were an issue in PVE for sure. One shotting pacifist is a myth. The cries were and still are, ignorant.
---
Of course the yt's will make videos about nothing, its all they got. 
---
It probably is but making me go in and scrap bulk items one by one is worse than making sure i have enough mats in the first place. 
---
More time in menus is not what anyone wanted. Glad for the mod fix, not glad i have to press more buttons in a menu 
---
Same here on PC
---
And I assume the players who thought TSE was "overpowered" were those who hadn't found one yet.
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and it should be discussed not attacked. You dont attack the person, you attack the argument. Go do a queen fight with 12 people now and come back. The nerf would have been fine if they debuffed the queen as well. I know my group of 4 with tse pre patch could barely kill her if 10 people were present. Post patch, its a non rewarding ammo dump and likely to be impossible since she was left buffed.
---
Same here. The world is chaos, nothing is certain, wtf do I do?!
---
I think the main reason is: its a boost thats uses atoms, be it event base or not. When its ment to be cosmetic only as they had stated before release. Adding it in like this is a slippery slope to other things being added
---
I get they need to boost revenue.  It will help with DLC. 
---
I like to think that this event is a thank you for your support temporary Gift and have fun with costumes. 
---
i just hope they dont slip going down this path.
---
It take me 25 - 35 rounds to Kill an Enemy over Level 50 with a level 50 Combat rifle.
---
Yeah, my Gauss went from like 1600 to 450, but I don't think I'll use something else for my ranged item. I'd much rather them lower the HP of enemies and players, making Endurance special a little more valuable.  
---
Right!  I was going to try and play after work today, but I'll probably have more fun reading this subreddit...
---
Oh, yeah sorry I thought your intention was to sell them to NPC vendors because of their now higher value to NPC vendors.
---
Yeah, I think you're missing the point. This is almost starting to get comical it's so bad. I'm not one of the hate crowd, but I'm *very* quickly losing faith and realizing they're using their bottom of the barrel team of like 5 people.
---
The two shot nerf was unnecessary.  The isn't evem correct now and should be changed to one + a quarter shot
---
WTF does this mean Vendors will have better stuff? Or mods that were impossible to find before?
---
 **Vendors:** Recipes and Plans in Vendor inventories are no longer randomized and can now be reliably sourced from those Vendors, with the exception of some minor Workshop and C.A.M.P. Plans.
---
* The appearance of many Plans and Recipes in Vendor inventories is based on player level and they will show up once the proper level has been reached.
---
* Additional structural Plans for wall sets, power connectors, doors, generators, and water purifiers have also been added to some Vendors.
---
My point was that they stuck with a decades old engine precisely because they were familiar with it, which is funny given how every patch seems to re-glitch most of the things the last patch fixed.  It's like watching Ford put in a recall for F-150s and then return them to owners with their tires replaced with wagon wheels.  Like what was the point?
---
Yawn.
---
Going to lose the last friend I'm playing with tonight.
---
Wanted to see some cool Brotherhood or Enclave soldier type cosmetics.
---
Depressed right now :(
---
All plans (mods too) or just arms/legs/torso/helm? I haven‚Äôt been over there yet.
---
There were so many ebay listings for like $30 to get 5 TSE weapons, some even had sold multiples since ebay marks how many youve sold, it was insane lmaoo
---
Durability and repairing being mechanics means scavenging is always going to be a thing. White knight effectively nullified the need to repair armor, and made repair almost nonexistant. Compared to other perks that improved durability and/or repair costs, white knight is far and away more for the same number of points. They could have buffed them, but then what's the point of repairing if you could just ignore it? The only other option was to nerf the vastly superior perk. Sorry it may make your time playing more tedious (and mine, I'm not saying it will be more fun), but we'll get used to it, 60% lower loss of durability is still a solid effect worth using.
---
Not sure how you think I'm indicating that I'm better or cooler than average. I'm running a nerfed play style... I'm not stating their opinions don't matter I don't understand the rational for NERFS. Innovate and make things more viable. This post is literally stating they nerfed multiple things but didn't innovate or fix well known issues. 
---
That's exactly what I was getting at. Bethesda ones are fine if you don't use photomode, but if you'd do I'm sure you'd rather see your own memories.
---
Well, look how that panned out
---
Only Ultracite plans, no mods
---
Because PA doesn't require Ballistic Fiber.  Neither does Marine Combat when I actually get it, but metal does...
---
i'm not blaming them for me dropping the ammo, i'm blammin them for the crashing servers.
---
Oh wow, i'd take a TSE over a mask anyday though
---
Damn isn't that illegal? That's insane
---
YAS! NERF ALL THE THINGS!
---
Bulletsponge76
---
Farmville76
---
Failout76
---
They sell them on Ebay. And nerfing won't change that, they'll still find a way to dupe and sell whatever is the next best weapons.
---
And it now takes three headshots from a Gauss Rifle to kill a super mutant again. \*sigh\*
---
I am a heavy guns build, I understand nerfing explosive weapons but why 2 shot? 
---
You've basically made my class pointless as melee is still massively over powered, does not require farming for ammo and did far more damage than anything else to begin with.
---
If a weapon fires 2 bullets at once it should do 200% damage, and if you want to avoid everyone just specing melee builds then you need to put this back.
---
Also I know this has been mentioned but how hard is it to just increase durability on the energy and plasma weapons? They have been broken since launch. Just another thing that points me to believe you want everyone to go melee. However ridiculous that sounds.
---
Well I‚Äôd take it if it means my mods won‚Äôt get scrapped anymore.
---
This is the part of the patchnotes I was talking about
---
&gt; Scrapping: Junk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft.
---
OP you made me curious!
---
I can confirm the pocketed armor carrying weight glitch isn't back ;)
---
I wonder if OP knows you should hit things in the head. Maybe they are shooting them in the knee?
---
I'll be camping the vault in chameleon gear with my saved up stealth boys. Today will be great
---
I only bulk aluminum and Lead because I didn't think there was any weight benefit to bulking anything else, so it actually doesn't hurt too bad of you do that.
---
I agree it is annoying, but not bulking the stuff until they get this fixed seems a pretty decent option.
---
Dada, Mama!
---
Melee is still OP while everything else gets nerfed into oblivion!
---
Yeah I have explosive Gatling plasma... Every time I used it was a RNG roll of when will it break. IMMEDIATELY or ONE CORE LATER.
---
Fuck
---
It‚Äôs so stupid that I have to relearn all the camp plans over again on any new character. Especially since they have no impact on my damage output or perk build whatsoever.
---
I would just love if Ecological Balance and other daily events would actually checkpoint. I think I've started that one three or four times, but always get disconnected before I can finish it. 
---
Not asking for infinite persistence on a daily event, but at least let us have the whole day to finish it.
---
First signs of p2w
---
I am just gonna leave this here.....[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs7EAzbzCNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs7EAzbzCNE)
---
Next up is the "OP" melee weapons. For more "balance."
---
Im hearing that it costs 2400 Caps in the vendor so you actually got it for a steal.
---
and why is that? because you "mix maxers" were trying to get away with 3 1 star damage perk cards by letting the legendary affix do all the work
---
Right there with you. This company needs to lose rights of this franchise already because they've butchered it.
---
We've been promised new content from day 1.  Content they haven't delivered on.
---
I think dark souls from DS2 onwards gave free respecs to address weapon nerfs.  I think you could do it 5 times in DS3. Think it was unlimited in two. Something in between would work 
---
 You think I inject myself with all that shite and drink myself drunk because I‚Äôm a "tough Irish gal"? 
---
Hmm I think you are trying to say they don‚Äôt sell plans for the mods, like Plan: Ultracite Calibrated Shocks, right? Just curious if it is still only SBQ farming for any of the mod plans.
---
What a fucking despicable pile of shit patch, "hey guys explosive suck shit so we're going to Nerf the fuck out of them and then Nerf all their perks too, thanks!
---
Definitely.  I can't imagine they are all back.  A couple maybe?  Or some new ones (like bulk not being able to be used).
---
Only bashing and we can finally have legendary gun stocks sweet 
---
Only serum recipe I saw for sale before this was 22k caps. They have always been expensive. 
---
U rite
---
As people already said, this game still feels like beta.
---
Wish I knew how to run 2 instances on PC. But I'm lucky enough to run 2 PC'S while I play on my main and alt :)
---
You're supposed to shoot Sentry Bots in the Fusion Core, yeah?
---
It still doesn't take 25-30 more shots to kill one hitting in the chest.
---
laying the ground work for the creatively bankrupt yt's feeding frenzy
---
I did. 
---
So I can chain headshots now? Does this work with Gun-Fu? Seems like a significant buff if it does. 
---
Welp, Licensed Plumber was the only reason pipe weapons had any use in this game, soooo I guess I'm not using them anymore. Making this perk "in line" with similar perks is nothing more than a nerf to pipe weapons, which did NOT need a nerf at all lol
---
wat
---
Our Lord will be pleased! 
---
Only alluminum and lead get a 50% weight reduction when bulked. That is likely not intended as it doesn't make sense when nothing else gets the same reduction 
---
My tse gatling went from 697 dmg to 190, thank you to all the assholes who exploited stacking bobbleheads and got enough people crying about it to get Bethesdas attention.
---
Lol so I bet you think the game is perfect also
---
80% of the stuff they did in that patch me and my friends either didn't care about or actively dislike.
---
I'm not losing friends to play with because of small bugs.
---
I'm losing friends to play with because they're BORED.
---
There was a surprise thing added you may not have noticed. It was a giant metaphorical dong up the bum of every Trader üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Apparently yes
---
Science wing has all Serums.
---
That's what happens to dupers when they dup too many ultracite items.
---
But it's *Fallout*. The respec at high levels isn't the way it's supposed to go. You play through with a build, then once you've done all you can do, start over with a new build. Ever game gets boring once you level up into God-hood. Nerfing endgame players feels like they're gearing up for a more manageable PVP experience, where the difference between lvl100 and lvl300 should be almost negligible. Otherwise it takes a split second to predict how a fight is going to end.
---
Fuck, they nerfed White Knight? I must have missed that in the notes. How bad of a nerf?
---
Down-vote not incoming for voicing this opinion \[at least from me\] - but I really don't (and I am trying to find a polite word) give a poop if they offer that since it won't affect my play. I don't want to PvP \[where these added stats might come into play\] or doing the boss battles with a team. I guess for play styles that are more casual I find it hard to see P2W or things like this as a hindrance since i don't see a 'win' into just roaming, killing shit and building stuff.
---
However I do see your point on 'give them an inch' since they did promise some items and could loop-hole into the pay for extras to gain an edge.
---
Keep making noise and I'll keep working on seeing your point of view more clear.
---
That's a fair point, and I agree that there are significant issues late game issues limiting the effectiveness of normal armor, I suppose I'm just focusing on comparing WK to other similar perks and I understand the reasoning for nerfing it. As for nuke zones, really they just need to let radiation suits and armor be used at the same time, or have lead-lined armor mods have the same additional underlying rad resistances that PA and rad suits have in addition to their visible rad resistance.
---
Don't be silly... you still have to shoot and use up ammo... it just has the same range as a punch. 
---
I'm glad i picked the gatling gun up for 900caps, lol
---
Have no idea of how the damage is determined (can't test on xbox) but maybe the total base damage is just given to that one lonely pellet? lol, God that would be hilarious. 
---
Likely they just increased total damage by 100% (pre-patch) and divided by 9.  Still good, but if you shoot a TS shotty, you can count the pellets to confirm.
---
Honestly, it is probably a good thing, as increasing the pellet count by 8 would likely make it a monstrous spread.  With the inherent accuracy penalty of TS, you would really need to be in their face for full damage.
---
Thanks for the support, I can't report the issue due to character limits on the bug report (I assume, I click submit and nothing happens)
---
Maaaannn I‚Äôm so salty about it. I have all the aura mutations and I drink whiskey like water and buffoutlike food pellets, but I‚Äôve yet to see a single addiction and I can‚Äôt keep diseases for the life of me! (for plague walker) 
---
These mutations have made my body too strong :(
---
Yeah man they reduced the shit outta the weps only really does like 165 dmg from 600 talking about the handmade. Logged on to see how badly they were nerfed wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be that super nerfed. Logged off after seeing all that.
---
I'm not even that annoyed at the lack of new content.  I'd like the existing content to work correctly.  The Messenger, Protest March, Surface to Air, It's a Trap - so many quests that are still frequently bugged.
---
No. I think it may be because I was on character A who knows everything, switched to character B and noticed the plans. Maybe if you go direct to the character from game startup it works properly, but it seems to carry over at least when swapping at the main menu
---
Why my pp hard?
---
Like buffing the energy weapons. And expanding the build budget, and the stash limit...
---
You should be able to go up to, say, 5k caps into the negative with the following rules:
---
-this can only occur due to PVP cap losses not buying from players or vendors
---
-this should only apply to lvl 50+ characters (to prevent farming of caps from freshly made characters; leveling a character up to 50 probably is not worth the 5k caps)
---
-being in debt should apply a 100% pvp damage mitigation (players and structures) until you break even
---
-maybe keep the 50% player damage for 1 hour regardless of how long you‚Äôre in the negative, but renews every time you lose more caps into the negative.
---
only one out of all of the cap stashes i've hunted down today has even had the option to search on it, and it rewarded 24 caps. the container itself had only 1 cap. 
---
on top of that, stash spawns appear to not be fixed in the world, so there's no guarantee that a container will even be there. there were some spawn points where i couldn't get a container to show up at all, so it's possible that they removed even more spawn points.
---
it appears to be a significant nerf across the board.
---
Also seen heavy combat armour torso plans at watoga as well as sturdy arms
---
Why exactly. You still shoot a second bullet, now with quarter of a first bullet damage. It is still two shot.
---
It's in the patch notes. The did that to prevent spamming vendors/players. There was apparently a caps glitch that people were utilizing in the enclave vendors
---
Fair enough, that you arent stealth focused, and so stealth is independent of your armo experience. That's cool.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As an aside, I use as much armor as I can get with the legendary effect that increases sneaking chance, and one of my armor pieces will make me invisible while motionless. Then I put the shadowed effect on all 5 armor parts (so each piece has either 1 or 2 stealth-enhancing effects). Also, I run sneak 3, and escape artist 1. With that setup, I absolutely *do* play whole encounters from stealth. I just shoot mutant hounds before they can find me. Outside, I can always stick and move, though I dont often have to. Rarely do I ever see [Danger]. Even in broad daylight, enough range keeps me safely in [Caution]. Inside buildings, bad guys have to basically walk right up to me to see me, and they dont live that long. And all I use are a 1-star executioner's lever action and a 1-star bloodied handmade.
---
But as commited as I am to the stealth lifestyle, I'm still a slacker. I dont run Covert Operative. I would, but my friends all run a Starched Genes / Class Freak / Strange In Numbers setup, and I got pressured into it, so I dont have the spare points. :)
---
i searched far and wide for my known plans, kinda glad they upped the price.  Im upset enough about white knight and bulk junk not working for crafting anymore
---
*shrug* I'd agree more if other issues were addressed first, or in we were warned in advance, or... well if I could even still SELL to the vendors to cut weight, which I currently can't do.   
---
I can't even trade atm.
---
New meta, axe wielding lumberjacks? Wha?
---
I had that same issue with a couple of stashes too. Seems like some work and some don't. The highest stash I got out of a run was 27 caps. That used to be about the minimum with caps collector before the patch.
---
Or, you could just use the other weapons. Have fun.
---
Server hoping is not grinding. Watching a load screen isn't playing the game. Mechanics should not encourage reloading the game instead of playing it.
---
grape mentats and day tripper don't stack, depending on which you used first you might get a better deal.
---
No! They listened to noobs anf broke The game
---
Bc maybe every item in the world call to that room and get a duplicated one?. Or you want to read a spreadsheet syaing ARFGTD566FERM to try the new item that the team is working?
---
You assume they write test cases‚Äî at this point Im not so sure they even have a QA department with the shit show we have today.
---
But you had to buy to Xbox‚Äôs and Tv‚Äôs 
---
Karma
---
From what I am reading this patch undid the last patch. The headlight brightness was in the last patch. Probably screwed that up as well.....
---
The Enclave outsourced the vending to the DMV bots. No other explanation.
---
Dump it in your stash and try again. Been having this issue.
---
Read the patch notes last week while playing.  Logged off immediately and haven't logged back in since.  Maybe someday the game will be fun to play but for now it just isn't for me.
---
no far from it lol check my post history
---
However removing peoples ability to stash 5k junk (25k if you count all 5 slots) i a step in the right direction. Hey if your hoarding issues didn't effect everyone else it wouldn't be an issue.
---
Anything that makes server stability better is a good thing
---
Because I'm not a fucking crybaby.
---
Until now. Whatever is the next "best" weapon will get duped and sold on Ebay. At least as long as there is a player base. 
---
Let me guess, version control is too hard for you too and you are just mad at people yelling at you for patching old bugs back in so you are blaming management again.  
---
Im with ya, just got RE2. The absence of decent loot was mainly what killed my interest, the other being nothing more to do after 300 hours.
---
Doing the same thing over and over expecting a different result is.... insanity.
---
Bro. I've been a rifleman from lvl 30 to 100. Before that pistols. Ive NEVER had to use that many shots. Ever. 
---
Sorry but you are coming across as full of shit. Maybe you exaggerated a tiny bit there w 25/30 shots?
---
I'm back to pistol/melee. I'm going to go kill a Behomoth w my pistol. I'll let you know how many shots. 
---
Maybe not stretch it out, but it does make things more burdensome.  I meant literally and as a pun.
---
&gt;Perks: The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%, and their repair bonuses have also been reduced, to match the Power Patcher perk.
---
haven't tested it out in play yet personally.
---
Wait... they *still* didn't fix such a huge game-breaking bug that was in the game pretty much ever since the first day of the B.E.T.A. and that wasn't even there in Fallout 4?
---
As opposed to 16 damage for a base one? Thats crazy. The lmg is a terrible fun and has been since beta. It uses 308 and even as explosive only did 72 damge a round. Now it does 20. 308 ammo is hard to find enough to use the lmg and very expensive to craft. 
---
Dude, if you have level three of that perk and aren't swimming in materials and selling off excess then you're not picking up or looting anything.  Even if they tripled the amount that is needed from 1 of each to 3 of each that is totally still reasonable.  Let alone if you keep the perk in place.  I've went days of gameplay without needing to repair my armor prior to the patch with loads of excess left over with the perk loaded on my melee character.  Maybe this will just give me reason to actually use some of that stock of stuff in my stash.
---
Ok with my tse lever action, no sneaking, it took 6 shots to kill lvl 91 glowing deathclaw at the station right above Watoga, right after I killed it a lvl 80 SB showed up and took about 60 to 80 seconds to kill that by myself, thats including all the ground enemies that come with it...the TSE is not dead, just a little weaker
---
People are complaining that things like Calibrated shocks used to cost like 500 caps and now cost like 5000. Its a good trade off if you ask me, but I can see why people would be upset about it.
---
plus people can offer to mod your PA for a modest sum in caps.  If you invest 5k in the plans and offer to mod for say 500 or even 1k caps, a lot of people will take you up on that to save the 4-4.5k caps.  Once you've recouped your 5k investment it's pure profit.  
---
People already do this, and were able to make massive profits because the plans were so rare.  The new availability will allow anyone to offer a competing service and thus the prices to hire someone to craft you a jetpack or whatever will fall.
---
95% of the time me and my friends have no problems.  We can deal with the 5% of the time the game crashes, a crafting thing didn't work, trade menu bugged out, etc.
---
When I drop to 0 friends playing the game, I'm going to be forced to go play things they like (Some other survival game, Overwatch, COD, whatever).
---
That's less revenue for Bethesda and shortens the lifespan of how long they'll keep updating the game.
---
The list keeps getting bigger. Check your Bobby pin weight......lol
---
really, dirty little scaaamers.
---
That really is expensive, but I still prefer this to server hopping for hours on end.
---
Because the numbers pre nerf were off the charts.
---
Tse with 5 pts in demo got you 300% more damage.
---
9pts gets you 60%
---
It will come in time.  
---
New content on a "broken" game will not make it better.
---
I'm sure you'll be right there waiting in line
---
The Charisma perk sharing glitch seems to trigger whenever anyone joins or leaves the team (even if the Charisma points would still be enough to share), or when the user fast travels.  I assume that these events trigger a recalculation of the Charisma points, which initially reset to zero (thus unsharing the perk because of insufficient points) before giving it the correct calculation again.
---
Right? .308 hunting rifle with hardened reciever does more damage than a fucking 50 cal receiver
---
Bury it, move to a new state, change your name, grow a mustache, and get a job selling pretzels at the mall.
---
Yeah Peter we are going to have to have a talk about your TPS reports. We are putting TPS on the cover of all our reports Before they go out now. MmmK?
---
Can I recharge my fusion cores again? 
---
What a clown show this is. 
---
Don't play Fallout, but I'm salivating at the thought of Smash Bros having patch notes like these. All it says is "various gameplay adjustments".
---
Wait, they get consumed? Why is that?
---
I've found plans or got them from an event for a hunting rifle, I can just keep making that one... 
---
Ok well you still have it :D
---
just need a little more ammo now don't ya, no big deal there's even factories that will make it for you to claim ; )
---
Hmm, ok I must have missed that entry.
---
The majority of the player base was asking for survival mode?
---
Exactly. The perk is useless now. Without demo expert my Handmade does 95 damage. Dont really care about that other 8. But now I gotta grind for better gear haha
---
so you want it always there, and cheap. Anything else, a back rub?
---
&gt;Ok with my tse lever action, no sneaking, it took 6 shots to kill lvl 91 glowing deathclaw at the station right above Watoga, right after I killed it a lvl 80 SB showed up and took about 60 to 80 seconds to kill that by myself, thats including all the ground enemies that come with it...the TSE is not dead, just a little weaker
---
I gave up on fo76 I got to lvl 81 and there's nothing else to do besides grind for weapons and armor but when your killing 3star legendaries and they always drop 1star, you just start giving up on the game, 
---
Yup this is a big hit as I said junk is now gold again and killing players is viable means of making money
---
They would nev... oh, who am I kidding -_-
---
kk read it wrong, my mistake, sorry.
---
Ill be saying the same to you once your build is nerfed lol
---
I‚Äôve been wanting this since day one! I‚Äôm not a raider, so I‚Äôm not going to have any number of the shaved head variants, and I‚Äôm tired of running into other vault dwellers with my exact hair style because it‚Äôs one of three that look nice. 
---
Man, he looks so sad working at Auntie Anne's... so like their typical employee
---
Personal I won't haha
---
But others...yeah. Yes. Definitely will. Grieving has increased with each patch.
---
&gt;im just under 400 hours played and starting to lose my patience 
---
How does anyone write this sentence and not see how stupid it sounds
---
I'm going to wait and see what Beth says on it. But first, we need to get their attention 
---
Vendor Bot Resin? Who's that?
---
My bloodied 3 star Grognak Axe is calling me from the stash grave.
---
Apparently this update ruined that, it no longer automatically does it from what I'm hearing
---
I honestly dont get the big deal, I guess its annoying for some that others get the same buff by buying that they got through a whole quest line, but who cares lmao, 15 health is barely anything, its clearly an attempt by bethesda to get people to wear costumes in game for the theme
---
‚ÄûYou called Bethesda games studios, how may I help you?‚Äú
---
‚ÄûYes hello it‚Äôs me satan, please double or triple the grind. Yes don‚Äôt worry you can always pretend it was bugged later in‚Äú
---
You can blame the dupers and the people that bought them. The Nerf would not have been nearly as hard if shitty players hadn't flooded the game with them
---
It's not a one star tho its 2 it's a nocturnal exploding shotgun
---
Agreed it has more repercussions than blind idiots care to see. Want to kill the queen? Too bad she is still buffed. A lot of peopl will be switching to melee and it will be nerfed next to make it balanced. This is a slippery slope and bethesda is already falling down it, so more nerfs will be expected in the future. Who even asked or complained about white knight? It got nerfed too. 
---
You cannot balance pvp and pve at the same time in a game like this. 
---
food, I dunno prob seeing as alcohol still stacks with chems.
---
So they fixed that by breaking something else... I billed all my stuff to save on a tiny bit of space and to sell bits easily to vendors.
---
But now I guess it's just.. screw me and my play style.
---
I agree with the bullet damage. The explosion on the legendary effect would be enough to nerf.
---
Respect special points in level without resetting your cards would be fine. Then you‚Äôll still need to grind your cards if you need more

Just found that there is *one* MODUS terminal that works. The rest are perpetually busy.
---
Right, but at some point. You spent ~600 dollars on a two Xbox‚Äôs plus two Tv‚Äôs. 
---
Bulk junk is bugged. This update is a bust. 
---
Exactly. I'd much rather they put all those time and resources into new content, rather than anything PvP related
---
  So the Queen's loot isn't the grind, but the grind to kill her is the grind. 
---
That's like something a politician would say lol.
---
Lol... Buggy McBugface  
---
Game showing I collected 10/10 for some of the flowers (I didn't) but 0/11 for the overall weekly  
---
[https://imgur.com/rWoXptG](https://imgur.com/rWoXptG)  
---
Daily challenges are just as bad. Didn't get any Atoms for the ones I supposedly completed either
---
I didnt think anyone would sell an exploding gun unless its duped 
---
Well fuck, there's always suicide I guess
---
And were told a month before that it was going to be nerfed.
---
The nerf apparently isn't that bad but hey ho its easier to cry about it than test it and adapt
---
The Morse code one is letter for letter translation of the text you see. It's the same sort of Event bot I think. Nothing special.
---
Yes I translated the Morse code for fun. Yes it was disappointing seeing the exact text get spit out.
---
No Player Vending. No New Quests. No New Events. No New Vaults. No PVP. No Stash Size Increase. 
---
Where is this mythical content you speak of?
---
All I've seen are bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL things.
---
And a 200 lb stash size increase doesn't count.  That was filled up in the first 2 days after the patch.
---
Go get all those X01 power armor bits off their frames in he bunker. XD
---
Well done with the patch guys, you gutted my character and retroactively nerfed a bunch of things i invested in. Im also permanently invisible now, my quest markers have gone completely insane and i just left an area where a molerat was stuck trying to burrow out of the ground to no success on an infinite loop. 
---
Me and my group of friends that play this game have tried to defend it. But we can't anymore, you've disappointed us and you keep on disappointing us in this game. 
---
Yup. I honestly feel like Pvp was a mistake and something that nobody asked for.
---
I removed chat, map and the old plans known mod
---
I think thats better though, serving hopping can be a week or three weeks, rng sucks a lot more than getting caps imo
---
Storing materials in my STASH is hoarding? I just don't think it's fun to have to repair your armor constantly. 
---
This game needs some glowing golfers, for sure!
---
"Did... Did he just come at me with a 9-iron!?"
---
"Blaaaaghhhhhh!"
---
I, for one, am saddened to see that we got a princess bed, but no princess power armor paint. Preferably with a unicorn on the front.
---
Missed opportunity by Bethesda
---
They OWN the rights lol
---
I'm just getting my LOLs from people complaining  about how the game will be harder with the nerf.  I'm not great at video games but I do fine without weapons listed as causing 800+ damage.  My current level 45 lever action has no legendary affects.  My melee is a level 50 Grognak axe* with assassin, so doesn't help me with regular enemies.
---
Oh no you'll actually have to play the game and use more than one shot to kill that level 68 super mutant.
---
Yes it is apparently according to people on discord.. literally amazed right now.
---
Exactly. TSE were meant to be rare weapons, not something as common as a board lol.
---
It‚Äôs destiny all over again. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not familiar with this by now. It‚Äôs the lazy way to balance 
---
Well news for them, as a loyal fallout fan I can spend my money elsewhere.
---
This is slightly disingenuous. While I‚Äôm annoyed at the explosive nerf as well you are implying that before this patch you could use Missile launchers and other explosive heavy weapons and they weren‚Äôt useless. As someone that tried to make heavy explosive weapons work the only somewhat useful one is the autogrenade launcher and the rest were garbage. It‚Äôs still the same after this patch. Making garbage worse doesn‚Äôt change anything. 
---
&gt;nocturnal
---
People don't like that effect, I would say not duped. Someone just offed it at a vendor.
---
i've done uranium fever 50 times at least have never seen a TSE.
---
1- You have unequipped armour on you matching what is getting unequipped in your PA, stash it.
---
2 - Vendors take 21 hrs to cycle caps
---
I didn't say it was out, I said it was on it's way.
---
Lmao 
---
Oh it is if you're on daylight savings lol
---
They have no idea how to run an online game
---
I paid full price too.
---
I just wish they'd stop the 100% focus on bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.
---
Give us something to DO :(
---
Why is the mini gun dead right now? I'm asking because I'm starting a heavy gunner character, not to be snarky.
---
It shouldn't be mind boggling.  If you work for a ublisher, you may have 500+ testers spread over many projects.  If you are a Dev tester, you have max 100 testers and that is a bloated QA team.
---
There is no way a team so small could efficiently test edge cases the same way millions of consumers can.  It's just not possible.
---
That said, I guarantee someone tried duping.  I guarantee that the test servers weren't strained by the real world factors.  Even a full server of 24 testers on site or even across the country would still have a better ping than 24 randomly scattered ip's.  It's not really surprising that server issues happened.
---
What's shocking is it took them 3 fucking months and to fix it (is it fixed yet?)
---
800 damage to 400....so you have to shoot it twice?
---
Is that really such a major issue?
---
I can handle a game where i have to shoot something once but twice is where i draw the line? seriously?
---
Yes it can, and I used to make that much when I still played frequently. But why? It's an artificial price increase for no reason. They weren't even half that price before the patch, when they were available. I don't mind grinding a bit (hell I do M+ in WoW and play STO so go figure) but this just ain't reasonable.
---
People wanted more endgame content and the monkey paw delivered.
---
The thing is that balance-wise, most explosives are already underperforming, and you need additional perks to really take advantage of them:
---
* Demo Expert (3-5)
---
* Grenadier (2)
---
* Ordinance Express (1-3)
---
* Fire in the Hole (1-3)
---
That's 7 to 13 points, which is ballpark the same as the 9 points for the other weapon-type perks, and a few more if you want to max it out.
---
Honestly the only reason I can think of why they would nerf Demo Expert is because they thought the effect applied to TSE weapons was too overpowered, and just adding to the existing balance issues. I don't get though why they wouldn't just remove the effect for explosive weapons instead of nerfing it across the board, and making regular explosive builds even less viable.
---
I'm wondering too
---
I don't agree with the nerfs to perks at all. yes TSE were a little bit too much. But the nerfs to the perk cards were completely idiotic.
---
People should have more builds to choose from not less.
---
as it is right now you either go Rifles, melee, or shotguns. Heavy weapons generally weigh too much to be useful, and explosive weapons, weigh just as much, and do less damage.
---
Again, Fallout. In FO1 you could be an incredibly sneaky pickpocket and plant plastic explosives on enemies while looking them in the eye. God-like? Sure. OP? Compared to what?
---
Inept monkeys banging away at keyboards.
---
They put the same time and effort into "thinking it through" as they put into testing the patch.
---
Still probably a random drop that got sold. Even if it was duped, I wouldn't worry. they're not gonna ban you for buying a weapon off a vendor.
---
I agree with your post except the stupid comment about behind sure they planned these nerfs before launch.
---
Lul, no they just suck at balancing, maths and planning ahead.
---
Well I did read your whole post and I get that you want to opt out because you will never PvP. I play the game in a different more casual way than most people with zero interest in end game PvE content and I‚Äôm constantly spammed with the death from above quest. Maybe we can look at it the same as the Scorchbeast Queen or a nuke- a server event that you are notified of and can participate in if you so choose. Why the flip do I need to know that the scorchbeast queens reign of terror has been ended? I don‚Äôt know but it tells me and I can live with it. 
---
Hunter/hunted has been completely disregarded because of the fact that you start opted out of it and you have to tune into a radio station to opt in. Most people ignore that entire section of the pip boy. If you give people a choice to opt out of the messages, they will. And then they will forget about it again and people like me (not even a PvP player, just someone who wants to do a variety of things in the game) won‚Äôt have anyone to play it with.
---
So I don‚Äôt see the harm in not being able to opt out of the messages when it‚Äôs a case of someone not being bothered/having their immersion broken versus not being able to use a feature of the game because everyone forgets about it. 
---
I agree. But a bloodied-stealth build w/mutations will dominate PvP servers in ways the TSEs never could. Bloodied will be nerfed eventually as well.
---
Ok
---
I love watching the people who defend this game blindly fight with the people who hate it irrationally.
---
Thank god I was actually worried someone was being that dim.
---
Faith in humanity's technological understanding has been temporarily restored.
---
Ooooohhh snap!! I can‚Äôt wait to go home and get that! I have been searching for those for a while! Only was able to find the garage doors. Thanks for sharing. 
---
and the 150 other members of there faction.....that legitimately looted there TSE's I'm sure lmao
---
ok, actually I can't sell anything
---
Legendaries are sooo OP üò´üò´
---
Hope you catch the sarcasm lol
---
If they wanted us to use ultracite ammo so bad....... They could have just said..
---
They should have started with tweaks to the explosive mod itself and built from there. Obliterating 2 legendary mods and a perk card at the same time is crazy.  
---
Ok thanks
---
Those 3 interns still working on this game haven't actually played it. And that's the nicest explanation I can find for the DE nerf and inability to fix the weapons durability of  energy and explosive weapons after all these months when a modder can do it in 2 minutes via FO76edit.
---
Sadly the truth
---
Much more now all plans are more expensive
---
I may just have to wait for fallout 77 to come out.... When I first got fallout 3 I couldn't stop playing it... fallout 76 I have to psych myself up for the painfest.
---
Complaining about skill in a pve game pepega
---
I have bad memories, hehe.  After I take the screenshots, I keep them opened on my 2nd monitor so I can refer to them without repeatedly going to Map &gt; Challenges.  8\^)
---
Sounds like this is not a problem on PS4, maybe only for PC then?
---
How many active players are there now?
---
It would have been a radically different game if we emerged from the vault right after the dam was breached.  
---
The responders would be hanging on by a thread, the Raiders a looming and growing threat, the free states established as a viable faction, and the scorched plague ravaging everyone.  
---
It would have been more compelling if the Vault 76 players could influence the survival of the other factions and the first major DLC saw the factions that the players had failed to help enough wiped out by the scorched plague, and their areas became overwhelmed with hordes of scorched.
---
Well, it‚Äôs against the terms of service. It‚Äôs not illegal. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt dumb. 
---
Care to share your methods for leveling? I just got my 2nd character (2nd account too) to level 36 and it's taken well over two weeks and I play about 4-5 hours a day. I was doing Inspirational, Well Rested, and Cranberry Relish for a total (assuming it stacks) of +30% XP. Mix of Main quests and trying to solo Whitespring golf club, but kept getting killed :/
---
Jesus fucking Christ. It's like they WANT bad press at this point.
---
Pretty much how I feel... 
---
Recently I have been getting on to do my vending cycle and then maybe do an event or two for some lackluster rewards. 
---
After about 30 - 45 minutes I am bored and just want to stop playing. 
---
I was also holding out for an energy weapons build and a heavy guns/explosives build. 
---
I am currently on the search for a new game to play for a few months and then I will check to see where this game is at. If it's still in a state similar to this by summer then I'll check back next year. 
---
Yeah except they added weight restrictions and then jacked up the prices of plans the lightest weight item of value in the game.... So they're increasing the incentive to dupe plans and buy duped plans. 
---
Unless you have a melee character...
---
Thats frustrating. Are the stashes in the manors still there? And is the stash loot exclusive to each player, or is it empty for everyone after one person loots?
---
They're trying to balance, which is hard when people keep finding exploits. No matter what they do, People will always be unhappy, and its gonna be a never ending nerf cycle
---
It may even be a planned glitch 
---
&gt;then honestly how the f#$k bethesda are we supposed to buy a serum for 18k
---
It will be easy when they start selling caps in the Atomic Shop lol.
---
So let me get this straight your going to buy multiple stealthboy plans for 6k each, and sell them for less, and you call that farming???   
---
i'm of the opinion TSE didn't need a nerf, but everything but melee needed a buff
---
Come march it will not be a pve game
---
Enough that I don't give a fuck if you leave
---
Meanwhile, i'm wanting to get away from that concept... that's how it is with hacking and pick lock... and it's annoying swapping those cards around all the time.
---
They didn't mention it in patch notes, but yeah they nerfed the ability to server jump and farm mothman eggs. 
---
they wont be PVE servers, there are no PVE servers.
---
PVPers will migrate to survival well most id have thought. Griefers will stay exactly where they are and carry on doing what they are doing.
---
Or just make it not work with TS which seems to be the real issue.
---
Yeah and a pretty nasty one at that.
---
Whine harder bitch, the fucking servers are smooth as never before.
---
I wish I had someone to buy me these plans
---
I have the same problem. Stuck at 40% stored budget with everything scrapped. I think it happens after ur tame dies and you move camp. I thought taming a new creature would fix it, but now I have 40% stored and a new mirelurk hunter that takes up another 10% placed budget....
---
So?
---
The terminal charges for the plans?
---
Nope. Just one character, 50 pounds below weight 
---
Look in the Notes tab on your Pipboh, you have to learn/consume them.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt of been a few thousand anyways, I bought the left arm for 500 a couple weeks ago because I was getting impatient to have all the plans 
---
&gt;in conjunction with Radshield in PA   
---
hmm.  
---
&gt;**in PA**  
---
**HMM**
---
shotgun were extremely op to beging with and still viable. Heavy and rifles took a huge hit, heavy was already in a sad state.  
---
Good lord, not cvs. That's ancient technology with a horde of problems.
---
the T-60 calibrated mod sells for 420 (with Hard Bargain 2, iirc). 5300 or more than 10 times as much for the plans... how many more than 1 or 2 are you ever going to make. 
---
Or use the free in game one.
---
I don't understand those guys. 
---
This patch basically ruined explosive and rifle builds and even partially reversed the changes from the previous patch. 
---
The explosive and TS nerf was unnecessary. The only thing that deserved a nerf was the explosive effect itself when used on shotguns. Bobby pins got their old weight back, the modus vendors won't respond sometimes and there are a lot of other new and old bugs added to the game.
---
I don't get it that people defend this patch.
---
So, instead of being forced to be either a TSE wielding spammer or a Melee Build, now you just have to be a Melee Build. Great. Nerfing is fine, but how about some actual balance? 
---
I would like to Apollo-gize on the behalf of this person. Please continue with the puns.
---
what is TSE?
---
It‚Äôs not a race, don‚Äôt get killed
---
Brilliant reasoning. 
---
You do know theres a free unstopabbles outfit already in game?
---
plans. the mod sold for 420 
---
Same here with materials... I‚Äôm restarting my system to see if maybe the update didn‚Äôt fully refresh. 
---
Bulk items aren't breaking down automatically, you have to break the down yourself apparently.
---
Curious about this too - any info?
---
I know, twas satire.
---
I was waiting to judge until the patch came out.
---
Now I seem to be punished for whiners, greifers and dupers. The nerf was overdone. 
---
There is a new patch. TS damage decreased to 25% and E damage decreased to 20%
---
Username checks out. 
---
I understand that feeling well and thats kinda my point. These legendary prefixes should make you want them. They dont.
---
I do.  My IGN is Atomic\_Tiki.  I'll be on-and-off this evening, East coast time.
---
Unless you're willing to take a load from Todd Howard and Pete Hines then your just a hater. Duh. It's not like the game is historically bad.  
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the ultracite plans you still have to buy them, not 100% sure though. 
---
Right. I already did that. It‚Äôs acknowledged as KNOWN. Still don‚Äôt have the option to craft them. 
---
It's not just a PvE game. Or there wouldn't be 500 posts about griefers one shoting random people. 
---
1 week and the "Pay to win buff" will be over :)
---
They literally gave you a set for completing the brotherhood questline, how was it ever hard to get? This helps people who accidentally scrapped the frame. And plans for mods like the jetpack and calibrated shocks will still only drop from the queen
---
I definitely agree with that I want more content and I can fully get on board with that. Problem is all everyone complains and rants and yells and posts about is the little things so Beth spends so much time fixing those to try to please the crowd and then the result is no new content. 
---
Damn i will have to look for a new way to complete the vendor run do you know how long it takes for reset?
---
oh is that why you keep  pming me you fucking pedo? 
---
My three 2 shot weapons are now just weapons. Oh boy. I get to grind for NEW end game weapons.
---
Or just wear the easily obtained free ones
---
Yup, the actual explosive weapons in the game really aren't that good with the only exception being the automatic grenade launcher, which is amazingly powerful, but also fires some of the most expensive ammo in the whole game at full auto speeds. 
---
Grenades are heavy, expensive, can't have legendary traits, and the Fire in the Hole perk is really underwhelming at higher levels. (It should do something like reduce the time between impact and explosion on top of giving you the arc, so that at rank 3 they instantly explode) 
---
The M79 is just a pointless dead end weapon. There is nothing about it that makes it better than the Mk19. It needs some magazine mods that give it some additional utility like adding blinding smoke or fire to its rounds or something like that to be useful.
---
The Missile Launcher is a joke, 2 pound a piece ammo, so even with the 90% reduction perk 50 missiles are going to really weigh you down. Why do you need 50 missiles? Because it takes 3-4 missiles to bring down high level enemies, and scorch beasts seem to basically take no damage at all from the damn things, even if you use guided missiles. Not to worry though, you'll get fast-tracked to total disappointment when the launcher breaks after 30 shots.
---
The Fat Man is actually a great ace in the hole kind of weapon with Bear Arms, but at 6 pounds a shot you're definitely not stockpiling ammo for it.
---
The Mk19 automatic grenade launcher does have absolutely insane firepower, but you're firing springs and screws at something like 200 rounds a minute, so be ready to be completely starved for weapon materials if you're an honest player who uses this. 
---
All of these weapons also come with the additional downsides of blowing enemy corpses into Narnia so you can't loot them, having ammo made from rare second and third tier materials, and being able to kill you if you stand too close to the explosion. 
---
If anything explosive weapons needed some love, not a big fat nerf.
---
I think the weight limit was more to counteract dupers.
---
They can't seem to stop dupers entirely, so they made it so they can't carry anything.
---
Just a thought in narrowing it down. Thanks for the reply :)
---
Maybe they are all of: chemicals, ballistic ammo, energy ammo, food &amp; drink.
---
im a better human than you are bitch. 
---
Seeing that you seem like a reasonable person I would like to ask a serious question. 
---
I have never duped a single thing, but I'm sure I have benefited from it. I ran TSE weapons and have not been on to play since the patch. 
---
I'm not salty. I like when games change it up. Should I start a new character or carry on. Is my rifleman build still viable? I just don't know how to move forward. I have 10 points I could move saved up. What should I do in your opinion?
---
Thank you so much for adding your totally unique and original hot take to this subject that definitely hasn't been posted about over a hundred times today flooding this subreddit with so many posts that it's impossible to navigate through them to find any other topics of discussion. 
---
The patch notes made it sound like they're free just like the X-01 and excavator
---
This guy melees
---
&gt; If you initiate combat via "slap" you should wave your rights to revenge if you lose and must respawn at your camp, and if no camp forced respawn at Vault 76.  If you lose, you lose.
---
I can think of one exception why this is a bad idea that just happened to me: If some griefer comes in and starts trashing your camp with a TSE, you have to initiate PVP with them if you want to try and stop it. And if you are forced to respawn at your camp you might just get killed over and over again by the same person.
---
Likely due to server resets...  until the area gets nuked again you won‚Äôt see the high level ghouls.
---
OP wasn't exactly clear on this. Thank you.
---
id like to question what you mean by spammer.
---
Every time I see a Wendigo I almost forget what game I'm playing. I signed up for survivalish not survivalish horror.  Death to the Wendigos!
---
And how much damage to melee players get when they have the right legendary effects and perks? I guess it's a lot because melee is borderline OP.
---
Their word means nothing
---
I just hate that I have to go back to farming Ballistic Fiber.
---
It was the bane of my existence early game.
---
Balancing the game should mean I could use laser weapons and have it be competitive 
---
We could make a meme out of this.
---
You realize even normal guns kill level 20's in two hits max there's no reason for them to be this fucking weak. Then again using reason and logic against someone that is so clearly lacking any kind of sentience other then shitting it's self and browsing reddit I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
---
Yeah I understand the grind my friend. I server hop for hours just for that event. When you do get lucky it feels great. First time I got a tse I woke up my house from cheering and screaming lol 
---
Salient points, just kidding.
---
Welcome to Crazyland. 
---
Doesn't matter what it requires for everyone else if \*you\* can do it for free. 
---
I don‚Äôt know, I actually haven‚Äôt found the terminal yet, if I do find it I will tell you. 
---
Shit game going free to play after you bought it
---
Alert the devs to the fact that this better not take weeks to fix, since it also included bringing back duping fixed in the same patch as the bobby pins.
---
Cool!  Now where do I find the plans to build the T51 and T60?
---
Pricing is sky high!  Wow!!!!
---
I used to see posts all the time about how easy it was to farm up to 25K in caps and how people needed mules to carry that enormous wealth. So around 25k on multiple characters on a single account. So why is the high cap price an issue now? You all have something to spend all that extra cash on now. üò≠ So much salt in today‚Äôs posts.
---
Wait people actually like this game?
---
and none of my posts have been removed so who is autistic? lol its you dont hurt yourself thinking. 
---
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a somewhat intended adjustment to balance out the fact that plans are no longer randomised in a server, you‚Äôre garenteed to find a plan but you‚Äôll need to pay more to get it.
---
They don't get consumed. I guess they assume you could buy mods not plans. 
---
Sweet, ty
---
When I see 2 or even 3 I just immediately log off.
---
I'll try running with Enforcer all the time (swapped in for SpamBeasts only at the moment) and White Knight for repairing only, I'll have to farm ballistic fibre more I guess.
---
As a new player. I was really trying to give this game a chance I enjoyed my shotgun with explosion on it. It's what helped me get my character leveled up and able to defend myself when I got in sticky situations. Why would a struggling game Nerf so much. I was the only one out of my group of friends that stayed playing because I actually enjoyed this concept and never really played Fallout. I don't have anything to look forward to with 80% of my damage gone.. they nerfed any type of protection I would have to look forward to as well.. I really don't want to put the time into trying to figure this whole thing out anymore.  I played this more in the last 3 days and I have save the world... I've logged into that game almost a hundred and eighty days straight. I guess I'm done with this game. Which really sucks I enjoyed it.  At least they could have given us some kind of boost on anything.. weight or something. Unless I missed where we got a boost I just see this as the Nerf patch. Truely saddened
---
Yeah I am wondering the same thing.
---
So you're being a dick.  Got it. 
---
Bulk scrap doesn't work without being scrapped. 
---
I found out myself, about 80% of the time it works fine, the other 20 he takes ages to ress you and the grenade kills you. 
---
Fully agree. Thank you guys! Your ability to communicate with players on here has been astounding. 76 has such a cool world, with a lot of fun to be had. So happy to see you guys working so hard to improve it. 
---
Yeah my handmade and shotgun went from almost 450 both to about 170 now.
---
I feel way weaker and already tested that scorchbeast are now just ammo sink for no rewards. 
---
I don't do the queen often ,but i don't know if people will have enough power to take her down.
---
  for each member on your team wearing a unique unstoppables outfit ..
---
that means that 1 free suit will give 15 bonus to the other 3 people, not the person equipping it..?
---
also, the word unique... 4 ppl wearing the same suit is not unique
---
Patience...it will come.
---
I love the passion that ppl. Express about this game.
---
You want more, and i do too. :)
---
I know, I was just pointing out the raw numbers, that my gun is about 33% as effective as it was.  So, good on them I guess.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Wasn‚Äôt sure though
---
Aren‚Äôt they upgraded to normal combat armor?
---
When you had a piece of pocketed armor (witth +5 or +10 carrying weight) and really fast pressed the button to equip and unequip it, your carrying weight would go negative and you could carry everything you wanted.  
---
Good old days... :P
---
I've been playing since Beta. I play almost every night, with my friends or solo, and I have 3 characters. I definitely play too much. I'm level 212 or so. I play with people who are level 60 since BETA. There's no right or wrong way, you do you fam
---
Do you ever fight or only farm and build?
---
There are a lot of us.
---
maybe you should get that perk that helps with vendor prices and grape mentats
---
Well, a lot of this is great! But I find myself hung up on the new ‚Äúall plans available at vendors‚Äù bit. 
---
I‚Äôm kind of sad about this honestly. Love the (known) tag - that should have been a thing from day one. But I think I would have preferred them fixing the spawn rates on the items that were messed up/locked behind level caps, rather than making them always available. Now you can buy them all at once, complete your set in a few days... and then what? What do you work towards while waiting for new content? :( The search was part of the fun. I would do my rounds on the vendors every day, looking for those elusive plans I wanted for my collection. I was always thrilled to spy one I had been looking for on the list. Now that thrill is gone. There‚Äôs no chase, it‚Äôs just... all there. This is post-apocalypse, a store should not just have EVERYTHING in stock! Lol.
---
So now the trade market is dead in the water. Who‚Äôs going to trade plans or items when you can just buy your own? This seems like a big step backwards. Now we have nothing to do while waiting for PVE content to drop.. and already I‚Äôm seeing a lot of my friends indicate that they are dropping out until that content arrives :(
---
Kingdom Hearts 3 came out today - poor timing for something like this, guys. 
---
I just want some new content.
---
Running out of friends and the will to play the game myself.
---
Me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hit the pipboy button...‚Äù
---
*goes to map*
---
Me ‚ÄúHmm it seems to be working‚Äù
---
*double taps back button brings up pipboy blank screen*
---
Me ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù
---
They appear to have reduced the two shot damage a lot more than 75%. My two shot handmade is now only 88 damage, that's a LOT less than 75%. Takes 12rnds to kill a lvl 50 robot in Watoga now. Why not just reduce it in PvP and let people play PvE the way they enjoy?
---
its sad we finally get new stairs and its just a reskin of the same buggy, ugly, hard to place stairs we already have
---
You can't even taste the broccoli in most cheddar broccoli soups. It just tastes of cheese usually.
---
I'm assuming that like most software companies, they have a means of ranking technical issues and determining which should be the highest priority. 
---
It's easy to assume that the problems that other people aren't as important as the ones you experience. I'm definitely tired of workshops crashing, but I think it would be absurd to claim that the game is worse than a month ago or during the beta. Each patch has resolved real issues. 
---
This one was in part a step forward in dealing with duper issues and a step toward dealing with griefing, which is a legitimate issue to address. 
---
People have asked about new content, and I think I read that some is coming in March. 
---
Hang in there. They'll get to the helmet issue.  
---
Lol at the guy who lurks a sub to a game he doesn't play
---
it went to the 7600 tier after you completed the 76 hour....seems like a bit of a jump mind :)
---
Then itll crash and youll have to download it from the beggining
---
Because the nerf should have been applied to  the explosive effect only and not to the two shot effect. The shotguns deserved the nerf but the rifles are nerfed into oblivion. The only viable build after the patch is melee because it's borderline OP. 
---
A two shot should have two times the damage because it fires two identical bullets.
---
Lol check again bro. And I can't tell if youre just dumb and think these are PMs and not post replies or are trying to lie and trick everyone into thinking I'm trying to PM you in a pervey way. Either way I didn't realize you were a literal little girl. But that totally makes sense now.
---
BoS is a mod that you can apply to normal combat armor.
---
literally no one cares.
---
&gt;What else? AAA right? Right, yeah right. Time for a demotion
---
Just want to point out that you demote people, not credit.  
---
AAA is a credit rating (that people have started using for video game companies for some reason) so you would actually *downgrade* it to AA+ 
---
Feel free to downvote me now. 
---
Thanks :) 
---
Is handmade sniper good?
---
I never got to try it cause I got a instigating lever rifle level 45 when I was level 30 by pure random luck. So I didn't have the plan yet.
---
I agree, but looking at the big picture the game was flat out broken on release.  
---
Really, this game should have been delayed by at least 3 months.  This way it could already have all of these 5 patches worth of fixes and new content would be one of the first patches.  
---
The amount of hate and the utter decimation of Bethesda in social media would have been largely sidestepped. 
---
But it shouldn‚Äôt take this long for some minor changes 
---
still going on pedo? 
---
Ok. Thank you for your answer. I will just see how it feels if I ever get through this ps4 update. Taking forever. Thanks again. 
---
The point is transparency. Why not tell the community the plans were going to be more expensive when they added them? The community wantd transparency and we are not getting it plain and clear. 
---
Confirmed on PC as well.
---
Guess it treats bulk items like the new way it treats mods.
---
LOL... Clan mate is super upset about the cost of things. Plus he feels that the wasted caps purchasing things multiple times could have been put towards the new plan costs.
---
14 days free?
---
This. I do several SBQ battles a day, I'm on 51b and I haven't had to repair my armor in about a week and a half.  My leg armor is finally down to 1/3rd.  Not sure what he's doing.
---
Okay, but who sells Combat Armour mod plans? I've had no luck getting Shadowed through scrapping.
---
Oh :-) 
---
Works for me, all muts.
---
Man, they had to go and Nerf my fresh TSE handmade. It did about 300 base damage, now I do about 124. 
---
They shouldn't have needed these in PvE.  PvP would've been fine.  Do they want us to have to grind out more ammo and mats for repairs?  That doesn't make the game more fun.  They've made it significantly less fun. 
---
This is a great example of why I wrote this post...
---
Why are people mean?
---
Does it make you feel good?
---
Is this sub a fun place to be in because of comments like those?
---
If so, fine, but my hope is this sub will grow more positive.
---
Take some Calmex. ;)
---
Yep, was coming here for this comment specifically. Well done, Bethesda, you've made conventional explosives borderline useless. Guess I'll change a melee build &gt;.&lt;
---
Any affix that grants more than 50% overall damage increase is OP. Two shot added 100%. The only things that still exist that come close are bloodied and junkies which have major drawbacks.
---
Good thing they had a nice long vacation after launching this shit stain of a game that didn't get any serious work done till late december and still fails every patch.
---
I feel like we need to make a list of these guys and share. If they don't want to let others enjoy the game then targeting them is fair play
---
Fallout 76 is a perfect example of why most games devs only pay these forums lip service. We are not representative of the other 99% of players that will never interact with any media for the game in any form whatsoever  outside their console or PC of choice 
---
4x more frequently but they also mentioned a nerf to the amount of materials it saves. 
---
So it's likely 8x, minimum, as a lot of the resources got down to 1 per repair before the nerf. 
---
10/20/30/40/50%
---
You can find a few more blooms next to Dyers where the gulpers nest.
---
I'm on PS4 and indeed they unfixed the Bobby Pin weight from the previous patch so they now weight back 0.1 each instead of the previous 0.001
---
the game doesnt feel as fun anymore after this patch. :(
---
goodbye
---
Players are having fun? Let's nerf the fuck out of everything! 
---
They could've, at least, not undone prior fixes during today's patch. Not an unreasonable thing to expect. 
---
who is vendor bot greg?
---
Idk if its because I'm a melee build, but 90% of the drops I get are 1star melee weapons, I have yet to find a gun I ACTUALLY will use, I just end up selling everything I get from the nuke. The repetition gets old after a while.
---
Not the end of the world. 
---
Raider vendor in the Cutthroats Headquarters (north of Train Station outside Top of the World)
---
I do. 
---
Hard to look past White Knight nerf... not interested in doubling down on farming for ballistic fiber...
---
I did know that. Sorta like they are saying ‚Äúthis is what fallout 76 should‚Äôve been‚Äù
---
No I‚Äôll still use them - but if I knew what I did now I wouldn‚Äôt have invested so many points. 
---
Agreed, as long as it's the OPTION to do so and not automatic, because hoo-boy would that be rough for some folks.
---
Some people swear by the pump for the shotguns,then people say the lever action rifle but i personally think the sniper riflr 50 cal can't be neat,and for machine gun its either the handmade or if you're talking heavy guns when you say machine gun then its the old gatling gun,not the minigun.
---
People complaining about a game they dont like instead of just not playing it
---
"I want a working product given that I paid for it"
---
"you sound like a spoiled brat"
---
They are doing a great job? Lol
---
I'll bring that up as well, thank you!
---
If it helps, 7600 hours of gameplay equals out to 316.66 days of real time in game.
---
When your business is literally making video games, yes making video games should be easy....and easy to fix..  
---
You think server hopping for two months to find one calibrated shock didn't make me giddy lol 
---
I'm being mean for calling out your behavior? Grow up.
---
Ya idk why people are complaining about this particular thing, of all the issues with the patch lol. Beth was just making it clear to us that Bulking is intended solely for selling to Vendors. Not for storage. *Just*  for selling to Vendorbots on an as-needed basis.
---
How many more gigs will you need of my console? I am starting to run out of games to delete...
---
But you did, exactly that. Just stop, cool your faux-outrage for a second, and think logically about the facts.   
---
1) You, personally, \*can\* get the maximum benefit available, without spending a dime in the atomic shop. 
---
2) The benefit is a temporary one, and is given from an event -- NOT from the item itself. 
---
3) The benefit is so small as to be nearly unnoticeable for most players.   
---
Q: How is any aspect of that p2w? 
---
A: It's not. You're just crying about it for attention, despite the fact that we've already established YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY A SINGLE THING TO GET THE MAX BENEFIT.   
---
Your only point here is that you are outraged that \*someone might at some point have to buy something from the Atomic Shop\*.  
---
God forbid that ever happen. But nah, you're not trying to tell other people how to play the game, right?  
---
Oh for sure it can be done that way, but it would be much more profitable if mods were only allowed through the creation club where you had to pay for it. I just look at it as them keeping as much restricted as they can for as long as they can, which I would mind less if the game offered as is wasn't so barebones.
---
explosive weapons just need buffed. the perk itself is fine.
---
Cap stashes don't pull up a "search" option when Cap Collector is engaged.  They do appear as static for me now, just no search option.
---
Also seriously disappointed I misread the new carry weight limit as the new stash limit!  I was stoked!  Same wretched stash limit.  Still carrying around great weapons I wanna keep because I can't stash them AND the scrap it takes to maintain them.  Still teetering on encumbrance such that if an even auto-awards anything, I'm crawling.
---
Lack of stash space for heavy weapons, the fragility of those heavy weapons, the nerf to legendary damage, and the need to keep enough scrap to repair fragile heavy weapons for the Scorched Earth event (often before it's even over), is a perfect storm of *bad*.  Not impossible.  Just not fun.

Using a Disease Cure after contracting Glowing Pustules, will freeze my game each time, consistently. I tried it 3 times now, it froze my game each time. It used to happen with Addictol but now it happens with both Addictol and Disease Cure. 
---
I know right? They only seem to half ass these changes.
---
Thanks, now it‚Äôs stuck in my head.
---
Dumbest colmment yet. Have you even played it yet?
---
It has been available for how long? 3 hours?
---
No. Get it free or dead sale. Look on eBay or something now. You‚Äôll probably already have a guy selling them for nothing. People are trying to get rid of them. Should find one for peanuts. 
---
Ah okay and yes that is quite the large jump!
---
God damn it!
---
I can't sell anything now either. When I try it says this item cannot be traded. Was trying to sell aid items I've sold before
---
how the heck have they not fixed this yet...?
---
always wondered this myself.
---
You know what programming a game is the same as? Programming. And regressing an entire content patch is not a great job. People really will defend anything won‚Äôt they.
---
Please kindly point out where I told people how to play the game to solidify any points you have made and I will hereby shut up
---
who?
---
What the hell do crafting plans have to do with TSEs? Butthurt dipshit.
---
Underwater? I guess I did realize that you could swim and not die üòÇ
---
Seriously.  I may just be doing Patrol Duty for a while longer given the cost of the plans.  Which seems excessive given the requirements to make the item are probably the same...
---
Yeah but you usually chase that loot from enemies and dungeons in games, not server hopping to refresh the shop.
---
goodbye already
---
&gt;would anyone take such a card? Food and water are plentiful in the game.
---
I took those cards because I'm tired of micromanaging thirst and hunger.  I feel like I have to stop what I'm doing (i.e., playing a game for enjoyment) to find food and water to consume, then go back on my merry way... or stop what I'm doing to craft more.  I dunno.  I knew about these things going in to the game and they're not exactly game breaking for me, they are annoying enough that I'm choosing to take these cards (even at only 1 star) just to mitigate the annoyance.  I won't go so far as to say that it's bad game design, but i'm also not thrilled with it.
---
Its a temp buff though, and lets be honest it probably doesn't work and even if it did is +15 health worth buying Atom's for specifically?
---
TS nerf was excessive. Specifically E weapons were the problem and TSE just compounded it by double dipping on the E... 
---
White Knight nerf...actually any nerf that lowers durability on standard armor and weapons is a joke... yes it brings it line with the power armor perks but power armor breaks waaaa^10000y slower in the first place... so durability wasn't really an issue. If anything white knight should have been left alone and power armor durability nerfed or base condition for standard armor and weapons buffed to the level of power armor so I don't have to keep 1/2 my stash filled with ballistic fiber...
---
Nerf to explosive damage perks once again was just a quick fix attempt to fix E weapon damage... which in doing this with the significant nerf to E weapons just makes already hurting base explosive damage weapons like GL, ML, and grenades instant drop loot. As a matter of fact buffing the ML was being discussed in another thread here somewhere. 
---
Some nice QoL changes but... I feel like this patch was more 1 step forward 2 steps back in a lot of the changes... 
---
Yup, my weight was screwy.... found that to be the culprit. Logged off last night and today I was like 15 lbs heavier. 20 lbs in Bobby pins.... lol
---
You're very welcome :D
---
then whats the point playing if you dont feel "god like" after putting god like hours into it. theres no endgame and the most "powerful" weapon feels like a pipe rifle. also how much damage does your tse do i got a prime on mine and it does only 230 with all perks on
---
It's really disappointing.  I liked the game despite it getting stale.  Every other developer would we trying to improve things, add content, etc.  What we get is the developer making the items you worked for crap.  User base should be looking forward to updates, not dreading them.
---
Server stability improved due to fewer people playing the game now.  
---
I have 3 friends that were going to buy this game and were waiting on feedback from me; with the nerfs in this patch, you just lost yourself 3 new paying customers.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that is currently not recommending this game until Bethesda gets their act together.
---
Personally, I'm more than happy to put up with what will inevitably be a temporary bug with MODUS to get the (KNOWN) tag on plans/recipes.
---
I see all the Social bugs I reported over months ago are still going ignored. Thanks Bethesda! I sure love spending upwards of 30 minutes every day trying to get in the same server on the same team with my girlfriend AND be able to fast travel to both her and her camp. Thanks for leaving all those bugs in! /s
---
That's your character gasping.
---
Soooo you‚Äôre lvl 122 atm and you bought an OP weapon at lvl 110. So not so long ago right ?
---
When everybody knew it was extremely OP.
---
When dupers were duping in mass this weapon.
---
When everybody knew it was going to be nerfed.
---
And now you complain ?
---
I have used a radaway diluted recently...but no radx.
---
No it's really not as pretty much every one can have that 60hp, and it is only for the week.
---
That is exactly what I'm saying! They're not cheap, but they're easily available.
---
While we're at it, how about making the (KNOWN) tag not affect the sort order of the items...
---
I don't though. I only have 1 set. I don't keep duplicates. and I'm not stashing my armor that I wear when I'm not in pa just to get in a pa and work like it should.
---
I just used 14 grenades from an auto launcher to kill a SM, what's the issue lol :-)
---
Bobby pin weight is back, duping methods are back, excavator weight glitch is back.. sure there is more. Check yourself... i dont need to hold your hand and walk you through them.
---
but.. but .. thats a fire Axe
---
You didn‚Äôt mention transparency once in your OP. 
---
Found the guy that paid for his
---
The point of it is for it to be an in game tracker of time spent playing, not a real challenge lol
---
Rip I just too noticed that since last parch I been hoarding Bobbie pins :/ looks like I have to start to shooting enemy with Bobbie pins again üòÇ
---
I don't even bother selling them to the vendor.  I just drop them in the ice machine next to the golf club.  That way some newbie "might" find something he needs in the pile of trash I dropped.  If I can find a newbie I emote "come here" next to the ice machine.
---
Meanwhile, I leave the nuke zone knowing I just wasted time, resources, and some of my will to play........lol
---
That was like 3 patches ago not one.
---
On PS4, I never got the trophy for reaching level 25, even though I'm nearly 100 levels past that. 
---
It's amazing how much they cater to the people that aren't even playing the game.  Those that complain about everything.  You aren't winning those people over, you're just driving daily players away.  So good job, Bethesda.  
---
I really hope that Bethesda does that.
---
At least you get to play the game while grinding for caps. Staring at loading screens and then seeing a message that I was disconnected wasn't fun in the slightest. 
---
 In video gaming a **nerf** is a change to a game that reduces the desirability or effectiveness of a particular game element. The term is also used as a verb for the act of making such a change. The opposite of **nerf** is buff.
---
They have plans to add co-op content, just because it isn't when you want it doesn't mean it isn't coming. grow up.
---
Probably. But not in the same way like that last guy tried to imply.
---
So, no increase in stash or carry weight and all of my weapons are nerfed 80%.   I'm struggling to find a reason to log on.
---
They have absolutely no clue what the term balance means. 
---
I had a level 25 explosive, furious,15% reload speed shotgun that stayed with me, I'm level 95 and shotgun/2hander build. It was stronger than other things I had, so I never gave it up. Might have to swap it out now haha. I don't mind that much, I don't like that explosives got nerfed when they are already bad tho. I wanted to try that build next.
---
Not sure how CPU‚Äôs cap out but I‚Äôll try that along with the various other tweaks, point is it‚Äôs kinda crazy this stuff hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet is all. 
---
Or maybe he looted them from a shop in Watoga.
---
I earned all that through playing the game :^)
---
Search youtube, they did not fix duping
---
Using mods? 
---
Nerf is a term for a phallic item forcibly given to loyal fans of Bethesda games. 
---
Seems like someone could use two accounts, one with tons of duped stuff, the other normal with carry weight, and then first transfer to the 2nd account before selling/trading their duped items.
---
Depends on what plan your after. If you exhaust all vendor caps in a day, you'll have anywhere between 1400 and 1800 caps, permitting you find Grahm and the Charleston area wandering bot. Just grab every weapon you find off the ground or an enemy and sell them.
---
Emm nope, traded it. 
---
I was actually thinking of swapping out Gunsmith rank 5 for Demolition Expert rank 5 for my nuka grenades and nuke mines I like to play with. They made that decision easy. I'd rather have my gun last 50% longer now for sure.
---
I had it before, i just scrapped all junk, dropped it in my stashbox and it worked
---
And yet a lot of people seem to be pretty happy with PVP. It's almost like people have. It's almost like people have different opinions
---
I guess but I‚Äôd still love something awesome for my efforts. Even if it wasn‚Äôt atoms what about a unique outfit or some camp decor? I mean the fact it is rewarded caught my eye more than anything
---
Don't teams max out at 4?
---
Well at least they didn't push the update out to all three platforms at once without using PC as the guinea pig.
---
Oh wait...
---
Wait, so if all I have is bulked lead, it‚Äôs pointless now basically?  Unless I sell it to vendors?  And I‚Äôll need to collect more?
---
I just don‚Äôt like the randomization of the system as a whole. Getting a ‚Äúpack‚Äù of cards is cool in theory but it reality the perks I want are rarely even an option. For the most part my perks are things that looked useful for now. 
---
(And I really just kinda hate the infinite level system altogether. Max levels aren‚Äôt a bad thing.)
---
That‚Äôs a reach. You can still hear the soundfx filter.
---
To make sure I could have a deathclaw, I didn‚Äôt build my camp until I had tamed her. That said she‚Äôs comparable to a turret in camp budget. Leave a little extra room and then fill in the rest once you‚Äôve tamed your animal. 
---
Well thats the old bug, that's been around for ages, never seen it when you arent carrying spare armour pieces, may be all new bug...
---
Grafton vendor, the bot in town. Where I found em before patch. But I saw that it may not be there now on another post. 
---
Gonna be a line outside the shoppe today.
---
I have that exact gun lol.
---
The fact they indirect nerfed explosive builds that were already pretty bad with the perk changes just to maybe keep explosive legendaries a little less powerful is a joke.
---
These people have no clue what they are doing and I doubt we will see a buff yo anything for a long time.
---
I'll just keep lurking this sub and not playing like I have for the past month and telling people to stay away from 76...
---
200 caps a day x 7 vendors = 1400 caps a day from vendors. In 18 days you re caps maxed just from selling your stuff. And that‚Äôs a reason to quit a game ?
---
I get it that a lot of people are butthurt right now but still...
---
And?
---
Which was done?
---
Last duping method is back and so is excavator wieght glitch. Maybe dont imply somone is a liar without checking 1st.
---
A software developer that will defend a company that clearly isn‚Äôt testing their releases or implementing any sort of version control standards?
---
It basically means to tone something down or make it less powerful it would seem... at least that is my understanding of the word when it pertains to video games... for example, if you nerf the Two Shot Explosive weapons or TSE for short, then they will generally do less damage by some amount. If you nerf supermutants, then they should seem generally easier to kill, or may do less damage. Again, this is a very general description.
---
There's a problem. I haven't been getting a paycheck.  They moved my office down into the basement.  They took my redline stapler.  I told them that I want my stapler back...
---
If I'm in the nuke zone, that piece will be in the Ice Machine at the Golf Club along with all the other trash I find.
---
It's all yours if you want it....lol
---
Unfortunately the more you grab, the more your stash fills, with no Stash Increase coming anytime soon.
---
Don‚Äôt have that perk. However did start when I eat playing with demo/explosive perks - and moving some points around.  Interestingly, it also reduced my TSE hand made from 175 to 163, with having the exact same perks equipped in the end.  Previously I had thought maybe I had some buff from meat or something that wore off.
---
The best weapon a sniper can use right now is a two handed melee.
---
Use this energy you have for somthing positive.  
---
yep i did distant thunder before i logged and it kept highlighting the heads. 
---
Haha okay I understand now why I was so lost thank you 
---
Next they‚Äôll nerf Sentinel and the Unyielding. 
---
This game went from rocky start, to uninstall in only a few short months. 
---
No idea who they‚Äôre talking to for direction on balance. 
---
Aim down sights. If you miss 9/10 times, you‚Äôre trying to miss.
---

---
Read the post again. They fixed _a duping glitch I've reported since BETA_. That's the important part.
---
I honestly dont know what happened.  I always placed and made sure any chassis was empty before I got rid of it, I can guarantee that.  I know I never had a full set of ultracite, or I'd have been using it.  I know I did get a chassis that I dont recall picking up, that had a full set of raider on it.  Which I emptied and then dropped.  
---
What happened, how, and why, I have honestly no clue.  
---
But I do know that I never got a full set of Ultracite armor, from anything.  \*shrug\*
---
Oh good, something to do with my 100,000 caps.
---
Just want to clear the air, you know that it says New Appalachian Railroad, right?
---
Yay!  Now maybe I can craft/scrap for mods for the furious HMR I've been holding on to
---
&gt;I don't really mind, but to not say anything about it in patch notes is pretty lame.
---
Can... Can you read?
---
No, none of us use them as far as I know.
---
Is that why everyone is downvoting you? Because you look smart? 
---
If people sell the plans for less than the vendors, others will still buy from them. So not worthless, really.
---
Only difference is now they'll actually have to go out and find the plans in the world or get them from events, instead of server jumping all day. Not as big a profit, but profit nonetheless.
---
LO :)
---
Prices seem to go up with the higher level you are.
---
Another thread someone tested it with a level 15 toon and a level 100+ toon and reported a massive difference. Not sure if its legit or not but probably an oversight from the dev team (or dev guy)
---
FO76 is VERY CPU intensive. When it gets to 100% utilization that's when you get the stutter. Not saying it'll fix anything but it made the game playable for me
---
The Y-axis sensitivity is changed for me this patch, much lower than X-axis. Did not have this problem pre-patch.
---
I just dislike people who say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go play another game,‚Äù it‚Äôs attention whoring. Go play your other game quietly. And when you casually say ‚Äúoh I‚Äôll be back,‚Äù what melodrama.

---
4) So, just after updating to the latest patch, I logged into the game. I spawned around Watoga, where I logged out, but found myself unable to move, shoot, ready my weapon, or access the Pip-Boy. The only controls which seemed to offer any feedback was VATS (drew my weapon, but nothing else.) and the world map, besides being able to look around. I was in a bare power armor frame when I last quit, spawned in with it, too, but couldn't exit it, either. I made a few attempts, relogged a couple of times, then found this.
---
Sure thing! I'm on PC and can get you a ticket number soon!
---
Someone suggested it had something to do with weigh reduction perks? Is that something you guys might be thinking? 
---
yes
---
Watoga vendor is your best bet. But learning attachments is an expensive endevor
---
Cheers. I'll try and find them then.
---
Dead as a doornail. Respect for Bethesda for such an ambitious project, but they're handling everything as if they were an indie company releasing their first big game. I absolutely got my moneys worth, even at full MSRP, and enjoy the time spent in Appalachia... but I don't see a promising future for the game at this rate.
---
Thank you very much that makes more sense 
---
Have any changes been made to Mutations? Like buffs or nerfs?
---
Yup or caps or both. We need a caps dump anyway at this point. There‚Äôs only so many plans and weapons you can buy to the point caps become a storage problem in itself. 
---

---
That would be SWEET. I wonder how hard it is to control the aggression of animals, because as it stands they are not really controllable... hopefully this function could be added because the only thing better than a dog companion is a deathclaw companion!
---
*Laughs in Furious .50*
---
OMG, is she ok?
---
Weapon spawns vs inventory weapons would be nice too
---
I know you can‚Äôt please everyone, but since they nerfed White Knight, I think I‚Äôm done. Best wishes, y‚Äôall!
---
I mean to defend the developers, not the practices of the company employing them. It‚Äôs not their fault that the company doesn‚Äôt employ the people to test the release or use version control. Devs get no say in that stuff
---
Checking plans and affordability etc, taking screenshot to complain about it.. who knows...
---
All these tears are so delicious!
---
So does this fix the bug of not being able to get certain plans past a certain level? I.E. does the Harper‚Äôs Ferry now sell the handmade plans no matter what level I am?
---
Not sure how those are related. 
---
It is very difficult an answer that question. I have no insight how the game is handling data at all or how their engine works.
---
Basically some of the problems we have experienced at the launch are dating back to the launch of Skyrim (2011) or even further back. This means that those problems are in the very deep core of the game. What Bethesda is doing to (not) fix them (properly): They are building some workarounds like limiting the framerate to 60 or introduce this item limit. Besides - the community (modders) is also trying to fix that game. E.g. for Skyrim they developed the Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE), which is basically another frame around the game. So input is handled through SKSE, which can work around some issues. E.g.: there is a limit of the length of a certain string in the savegame. If you are playing with a lot of mods for a very long time, this string (which represents the state of the game like finished quests, number of items in the inventory, etc.) gets an overflow. It reaches its maximum value and essentially becomes undefinded afterwards. So savegames get corrupted, because the game initially was not designed to handle such values. SKSE solves this problem by outsourcing those values and trick the game not to save an undefined value.
---
When talking about optimization there are limitations what can be improved with a handful of changes. Sure, you can put another or better renderer on top of the Creation Engine (which was certainly done for Fallout 76). But you can't change how the game is handling basic things. Getting tired of the minute-long loading screens when entering bigger buildings or caves? Yes, but the game is designed to function this way.
---
Also over time it won't work out. Competiton is growing. Obsidian will release The Outer Worlds this year, which will be in direct competition to Starfield. Far Cry: New Dawn is another post-apocalyptic survival game with CO-OP mode. Bethesdas monopoly is shrinking. And when a AAA game in 2-3 years from now on (Starfield, TES6) has to deal with bugs known since 20 years, or looks like a game from 2015 it will be really tough to compete.
---
As a career dev, I can confirm this.  Some of the stupidest bugs happen when you con't regression test.
---
Ya they were part of the old Warehouse building set in 4. Pretty sure my wife used almost nothing else for her settlement building ü§£ but damn were they ever stunning
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
Programming a game is the same as programming a game. 
---
Bethesda is a triple-A company. They shouldn't release a game that is practically still in beta. The game is buggy as hell, and their recent updates are making new bugs. 
---
The community is full of a bunch of fucking fanboys blatantly ignoring all the things wrong with the game and the company as a whole.
---
Why would you release a game for $60 dollars and still have the game practically unplayable months later? 
---
In general, less wacky tacky fabulous and more serious themes.  Military, survivalist (call it a blend of military and civilian clothing), raider inspired styles.  Shemaghs would be cool (ala FO4's sans facemask, and a version with facemask), weapon skins, ponchos, backpacks . 
---
None of these would have comics, princesses or other kindergarten inspired sources or themes.  This means that source inspiration would be classics like Mad Max, Escape from New York, Red Dawn or, to stretch the timeline further, Blackhawk Down. I don't mean copy paste, I mean inspired by, and not by Finding Nemo. Thank you.
---
I'll only pay double that. 
---
Really weird choice of not putting a stacking limit in for everything then. 
---
Crouched chameleon not moving for longer than any transaction takes
---
Sucks for all of us legit demolitions experts. I'll suck it up and continue to use them and see how it holds up though, either way.
---
They have static spawns now
---
Guaranteed
---
Saved yourself over 2k in caps at least.
---
Ugh they nerfed white night too? And Two shots in general? So all of my legendaries suck. Sorry to say, but I think I'm done playing this game.
---
Hmmmm... I echo the "thank you" but I doubt this is a quick correction since it seems like they were working off an older codebase and nobody caught that.
---
This is a joke. Why nerf demolitions perk? I've built my character as this and it's not even overpowered. Shotgun TSE explosive shells build is a complete joke right now. Terrible patch nerfing things that don't need to be touched. Missile, mini-nuke ammo is heavy as it is and break very easily. why nerf?   
---
And the community has been wanting a major buff to laser weapons. I.e laser commander, laser knight , etc. perks that should be in the game.
---
The dev in this case likely did not test his code or accidentally included a file that was not meant to go out. Considering there were no other weight changes in this weeks patch, I‚Äôd hedge a bet that nobody was making changes to that file and this specific developer in question hadn‚Äôt pulled the latest version of that file (and maybe more, we‚Äôll see if any other bugs come back) for whatever reason when he started work, leaving him with an out of date file and checking it in caused the bug to return. That‚Äôs just my thought process on how this could have potentially happened.
---
Yup, I‚Äôm seeing this &lt;.&lt; lol
---
I'm not going to make a video on it... not that important to me. I'm sure youtubers will prove me right soon. You are a toxic redditor who is not offering anything of value here.
---
Because closing in to your opponent without taking significant damage is SO hard right? 
---
Ow wait, most enemy's do all the hard work for me if i just fall back behind a wall for 5 seconds. 
---
And that are the ranged mobs.....
---
Melee mods are even easier. 
---
It is more difficult in this game to keep the mobs at a distance than it is to close in on them, well that goes for 4 as well. 
---
Hey at least I was able to walk into Harper's ferry and buy a handmade gun plan like nature intended. Go check out the watoga brotherhood vendor bot and see how many PA mods there are to choose from!
---
This patch isn't ALL bad
---
Finally I can have a baseline to price things like my t-45 stealth boy plans!
---
So how do you swim without dying?
---
Infamous in Fo76 is nothing to be proud of. With the right perks and a rifle youre one shotted. Doesn't seem fun to me to be THAT guy everyone thinks is a douche one shotting everyone. 
---
Same. Mine works when I first log in but then eventually stops working for some reason. I'll gladly scrap Bird Bones if that's actually what's breaking Marsupial.
---
grab the bulk items and scrap them, walla. You have your trash back again.
---
have battled and even took lots of hits from stuff around the SQ,
---
never had to repair my x01 suit yet (i did replace the chest at some point cuz of jetpack)
---
but the 18 luck and perks might have had a big hand in that. (lvl 130 now)
---
(but then i dont play melee, in which case its obvious u get closer to the action and thus get more dmg in)
---
I don't know how they did it, but Bethesda is actually making Fallout76 worse with each patch.
---
No.  I'd check back in future and see if the developers start to focus on content.  So farm updates have been mostly screwing over the player base.
---
........as it relates to fallout 76..........
---
I wasn't born yesterday
---
Good idea. Needs more votes
---
The one shot issue is for Bethesda to fix.
---
It‚Äôs a glass cannon bloodied build. Get a bloodied grognaks or power sledge with swing speed, relevant mutations to low health, unyielding armor, radicool, bloody mess, adrenaline, all the 2 handed perks, incisor, I‚Äôm forgetting a bunch of stuff off the top of my head. Serendipity is a must, and if you run and proc revenant your damage just gets silly. There‚Äôs lots better write ups I‚Äôm sure. I‚Äôd screenshot for you but I‚Äôm at work. 
---
I like the idea of glass walls/ceilings - but do not want to see them on 76 until they improve the servers a LOT.
---
Inb4 "they nerfed my god weapons that I bought from a duper on eBay! WAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
---
&gt;I'm not going to make a video on it... not that important to me.
---
okay, well at the very least you can detail what you are talking about. your post is what's offering nothing of value.
---
My bulked mats dont seem to count as mats anymore either...
---
To be fair, even the know plan thing is broken. How bad do you have to mess up to make every plan you know appear as know across all characters?
---
Is there a published set of statistics for this game, like "Steam Charts" for Steam games?
---
How many people played on launch day, and how many are playing now. With that trend-line we'd have an idea about what happens in six-months.
---
I some how lost the dress and no idea howüôÑ
---
And you would defend that mistake?
---
Soon as they do that its pay 2 win, they get enough shit as it is without adding that into the mix.
---
People already raging about the buff from the store items for the week.
---
Internet slang applied to games.
---
"To hit with the nerf bat" I.E. To make weaker, less strong.
---
Ya the carry weight limit is a great idea to thwart dupers, but holy crap is it ever screwing over a *ton*  of Vendor Players
---
Totally right there with you.  I will take paying 5000 caps to a vendor for something that would take me days or weeks of server hoping any day of the week.  You can earn the  caps for the plans in a few days EASY just playing the game and selling to all 7 factions each day.  I'd rather be playing the game shooting shit looting, selling loot then buying the plans than watching a loading screen hoping the RNG Gods will be kind to me...  
---
Absolutely not. Feel free to include the ‚ÄúSilver Machine Gun‚Äù skin with it, but Atom Shop items should only ever be cosmetic.
---
So you can't mod, repair, or craft with bulk anymore...? Are you sure this works before I scrap my bulk.
---
Two shot was obviously a problem because no other affix was more useful in any occurrence 
---
Atom Shop items need to remain cosmetic.
---
Now what they really need to do is add the Silver Submachine Gun skin. 
---
u/ladydevann is it possible to get a fix for the main storyline quest to not complete even though we've found all the tapes? I'm at 17/17 and still not showing a complete on my quest log 
---
They would be doing a great job if the patches didn‚Äôt introduce as much bugs as they allegedly remove 
---
Poseidon has one.
---
Yep. I started a new character. And I‚Äôm just fine with it taking 16 shots from a double barrel to kill a lvl 68 ghoul
---
I‚Äôm going to play sometime later this week, but this is extremely disheartening. It‚Äôs already a chore managing the food and water, which prevents me from exploring too much. But this makes exploring even less ideal as I cant possibly carry enough ammo to deal with all the enemies in a longer play session. This is defeating the whole point of Fallout, to explore a wasteland and find neat stories and fight enemies.
---
The feels are real! I keep on keeping on because I love this universe. Just sad that instead of innovating they are just  nerfing things... People are defending nerfs though the game could be balanced other ways instead of just nuking stuff. Fingers crossed new content comes out and its worthwhile stuff instead of atom shop....
---
Saw a post saying it's an account wide total.  You might check there.
---
If I ran the queen? Yeah many many times. Maybe 25 in total, last 10 with the TSE.  
---
If you run on xbox invite me, maybe I'll find it all fun again for some time.  
---
GT earpill
---
When you crafted before with bulk it unbulked it and gave you  the remainder as loose mats. Is that not the case now?
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôll wait and see if it suddenly gets very cheap. 
---
I usually do that anyways. Wait a year until you can get a game for 10$ or less. I‚Äôm not rich!
---
Fuck I have like 200 Bobby pins 
---
Now that is a great idea! I was suggesting they have some sort of ranking system within each faction that rewards you with rare plans that make sense for that faction like calibrated shocks for any of the T class Power Armors in the Brotherhood of Steel. Keep the plans locked to factions and make it so you can only choose a few factions to side with (you will become enemies with the other factions by result) so this way player trading can be encouraged. This kind of system thrives on Warframe if you are familiar with it. That's just my 2 caps though.
---
Have a same-account Alt that has exceeded the limit?
---
I think bulked junk is glitched so you can‚Äôt actually use it.
---
I mean, they can still create 10+ mules and store 15k+ lbs worth of duped items.  It's an inconvenience to be sure but calling it fixed is a stretch.
---
&gt;probably even more players
---
How many are playing right now?
---
Holy Moley. Front page but zero upvotes, you aren‚Äôt joking. 
---
That is a lot of salt.
---
So would this be an advisable time to start my new character?  I wasn‚Äôt sure whether C.A.M.P./Ore/Resources missions/tutorials didn‚Äôt exist, or if I had just missed them.  Is it worth starting over if I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve quite got the hang of it, or should I finish my first playthrough before I start overthinking it?
---
its a triple A game that came out in the last 3 years with no microtransactions
---
Yeah.
---
Meanwhile nothing new to do :(
---
Can't wait for another patch with 100% focus on Bug Fixes, Nerfs, and small QOL stuff.  It's going to be EPIC!
---
Dont get me wrong. I agree that its fun to be king for a day even if its king nothing. But PvP needs tobe balanced since its not a game that pvp should be in anyway. Atleast give everybody a fair chance. Id rather fight with weapon spawns and know it was skill that made me win rather than just being op af and pwning everyone "cause i can" but to each their own. Im not really interested in PvP fallout much anyway. But maybe would be if it was balanced better. I dunno 
---
Two shot explosive weapons 
---
Completely original response and awesome contribution. My man!
---
Story of my life lmfao
---
Yeah i am kind of done here, they need to admit they can't do this and release the server tech so private modded servers can exist and be protected from stupid moronic mistakes like this.
---
We gave them plenty of time to show they could do this and improve and they have shown that they don't have the capability to do that.
---
Orly? Has anyone confirmed cheaper prices at higher/lower levels, because I'd only heard of them unlocking as you go up in level, not actually changing.
---
Oh. Did you run the queen after the patch changes?!?!
---
Found 4 calibrated shocks in one week for T60. Two are now part of my CAMP.
---
With every win comes a defeat.
---
PSN?
---
This is crazy if it's true. I need to go get rich really fast.
---
Cool, why haven't you been talking to them about this since day 1?
---
If bobby pins are 0.1 again there is a high chance that some other older bugs are back. Do they have any kind of version control in Bethesda? Looks like they wrapped new patch around old one.
---
The fact that it took them 4 years to make this game, and after over 2 months of community feedback and patches the game is still this broken, is beyond me or any being's comprehension. 
---
 450 DMG on my TSE Gauss with all 9 rifleman cards, maxed demo expert and bloody mess
---
same :p can care less about the ho buff for a few days I just want the outfits.
---
I‚Äôve experience something sortoff similar. I had to take the components out of my stash, onto my character to craft certain items or weapons. Try pulling the materials out of your stash and craft once more.
---
True. But again. Why would anyonw wanna play if thats what its like. Lol
---
Good, I'm sure they will rebalance the SBQ to the way she should be when everyone isn't abusing TSE anymore. This game needs balance as a multiplayer game and the sooner people realize it the better; if you want old values just play Fallout 4. SBQ should be a tough fight, not something you melt in 5 minutes. There are a ton of entitled singleplayer gamers on 76; multiplayer needs balancing for PvE and PvP reasons. I'm sure I'll get downvotes but this is the truth and what most multiplayer games do; 76 is just learning to do it now.
---
What level are you? I remember when they were scary. Good times
---
Because pointless grinding is more "balanced."
---
Lucky you.
---
Wow it's good to see that the weapons (that were obtained via legitimate means) and build that I was using is now essentially useless.  I guess I'll go back to unarmed.  Oh wait end game prohibits it.  Good to see after two and a half months of a problematic launch the solution is to make the game worse. Lovely.
---
So what is the secret to leveling faster? I can barely get a level a day? I am sure I am missing something. Being mostly a solo player might be my crutch
---
&gt;Ow wait, most enemy's do all the hard work for me if i just fall back behind a wall for 5 seconds... And that are the ranged mobs.....
---
LOL!  I was just being facetious, but yes, I think it's hilarious that the ranged mobs will follow you super close around that corner.  Like their AI somehow thinks charging with that pistol is better than staying back and shooting.
---
Super Mutants on the other hand... damn I wish my hunting rifle had the same range as theirs. 
---
And to see that they nerfed it as hard as they did, I mean my two shot Lever Action was still taking a handful of shots to bring enemies down. This games gonna start feeling like the Fallout version of the Division.
---
For me they always had the red health bar indicating hostile but they would never actually attack me even when attacking them first.  Haven't played since the patch yet though.
---
Very true analysis. It's still very worrisome that the pins are back to 0.1 though. That alone indicates that at least some of this new patch reverted some of a previous patch, used old code, etc.
---
I/ladydevann
---
Oh Ok.. Thanks for the reply.
---
I've been seating on needles all day after discovering patch notes. 
---
Been talking to a few streamers in the hope to get them to attempt queen.
---
Isnt the wood armor something that the Free States came up with, to make stealthily traversing the Mire easier?  That's why you get plans for it during their quests.
---
No, just the perks I listed in the OP.
---
Caps aren't an issue now with the way cap stashes function; you can now explore and farm the entire map for thousands of caps daily if you want to; plus the vendors. I assure you that you won't have problems with caps unless you want to buy everything in the entire game and hoard extensively.
---
5 Levels of the Explosive perk now result in a 13% increase in base damage on a gun with the explosive prefix.  1 lvl in rifleman/handgun/2had melee etc give 10% each.  Its a pretty huge change.
---
Probably why I am not too fussed about the nerf. I am used to the Ubisoft &amp; EA nerfs. Haven't touched WoW in 5 years, so not familiar with the Blizzard nerf method.
---
My exploding revolver will suck a little in tonight's session though but they adjusted plan availability so maybe I can buy some plans tonight to buff the base damage a little.
---
Yeah, they all say that. 
---
Thats insane if true. Each character should have their own stash and carry weight limits. I have 5 characters I actively play.
---
At this point, I wish they would allow us to port new models and creatures to Fallout 4 since it's the main architecture they made 76 with. 
---
I'd even pay money for it. 
---
This experiment probably should've just been a massive DLC for Fallout 4 instead. 
---
Yep they are unable to drop until they fix the way the bullets work with them....
---
Yeah not really sure what they're doing there. 
---
However I have said it to my friends before that I kind of like the two worlds of PA and regular armor in this game. In Fallout 4 I never had my PA on, I didn't need it I was just entirely way to powerful for anything in the game and as I said in the original post I don't like using power armor. In Fo76 you have to use it sometimes it forces a bit of a strategy and adds an extra element. I am a fan when a game doesn't give you a clear cut choice to ride with at all times in all scenarios.
---
Have you seen it on the Atom shop? It wasn't there when i was on it 30 mins ago or so.
---
Its prob a bug more than anything.
---
Yeah I saw one post but there wasn't a clear answer. Okay how about the second part of this post though? I'm not even standard overincumbered and I cannot pick anything up. Saying I've hit my max...is it not accounting for perks maybe? Because with all this bulk junk and stimpaks, armor, I could see how if those perks weren't equipped technically that I could be at the limit but the perks are equipped, so what do?
---
Morgantown is first responders Sutton is raiders. But flatwoods as well now I'm curious.
---
~Challenge~ more of a grind*
---
FTFY. 
---
Is there a way to scrap a certain mutation without affecting the rest or is it rng? If so I'll also gladly scrap BB
---
That is very limited PvP with no reward other than being able to contest workshop ownership.  So yes, it is a little PvP, but it is balanced all the way towards PvE except for the fact that you can lose the workshop.   There is no reason someone should be able to camp on a workshop if someone else wants to contest it.  Even on a PvE server.
---
Well there‚Äôs an added ‚Äúthe runs‚Äù for consuming 10 tato stews that‚Äôs a fact
---
Hahahahaha! More loot for me!
---
;/
---
Probably removed due to the fact that they dont like being called out. Haha. Someone else's post got removed for calling out a Bethesda employee out for going undercover on reddit and defending their BS and he actually DID have proof. There were even some articles written on some gaming sites about it. Just look it up. Also, you must have one sad ass life for this to be what you are spending your time doing... insulting strangers on the Internet, I mean really what an absolute loser.
---
Then in that case it‚Äôs a bigger problem, I wasn‚Äôt aware that it was not an isolated issue
---
Sounds to me like they need to put in some more checks and balances in this case, because this is an avoidable issue.
---
Welp there goes my semi auto explosive shotgun I'm just glad it wasnt a two shot since I legitimately farmed events and took till level 125 to get 
---
How much stuff?
---
Any helpful guides out there about which Power Armor mods are worth investing in and which ones are not worth investing in?
---
OMG THE PLANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! T%HANNNNNNNNK YOU!!!
---
Omg! A game company trying to harpoon the whales! Preposterous who would believe such a thing. For real tho the investors dictate which direction a company moves in and let me give you a nickles worth of free advice, don't trust a giant company like this to give a fuk about you or your feelings they will squeeze this company dry until it's dead and then move their capitol somewhere else following ubi  ea and blizzard into becoming a meme that's where this ship is heading,bon voyage life lesson trust big company pr......... to lie to you and swindle your money
---
It's an old school MMO thing. Any time someone throws a fit on the forums and says they are quitting the game the standard response is: Can I have your stuff. 
---
Explain how duping is back? This sucks.
---
hahaha this is so sad its funny... they really ruin their name so hard atm, something like this shouldnt happen at all lol
---
I dropped 130 of mine and went down by around 13 pounds, so I don‚Äôt hunk it‚Äôs just a visual bug. 
---
It's random.
---
You didn't get the plastic back before anyway. You either sold the bulk or you used it and it got unbulked as it was used. Either way the plastic was gone for good as soon as you bulked it.
---
Nah, they just know how to craft armor that doesn't have low base condition. Max INT, cover yourself in unyielding armor, take your health almost all the way down, eat a bunch of berry mentats/cooked scorchbeast brains, and apply all relevant perks before crafting PA pieces/repairing with Fix it Good. 
---
I live next to prime and down a bunch of SBs/SBQs each session. I think I've repaired my XO1 twice since PC beta. 
---
Ok weirdo, im done with you
---
Better to make several posts of outrage to let beth know its not acceptable. Dont like it? Dont read it plain and simple. Everyone is entitled to a voice you commie.
---
Lucky you :) my vendors still have faction wide caps capacity
---
Don't know about the manners but after more testing I realized with each server it's randomized which cap stashes spawn into the world. Some have 2 at Poseidon some have 4-5 not all have caps in them some do.
---
The cap amounts are lowered more frequently it seems. Also less likely of a chance for all of them to spawn.
---
There was also numerous times where all I got from a cash stash with perks enabled was 1 SAD cap......... 1 ....... really? Even before I never got 1.
---
I use to think 25 was bad lol.
---
It was my go to spot. But now it's not really viable to do anymore. So I'm looking for the next way to farm caps that doesn't take forever. I'm open to suggestions if anyone has one. Other than you know, vendors.
---
~~don't~~ bother , pretty sure they hired the EA team to work on this game. The level of continuous failings is beyond what is acceptable.  Im done with Fail76 and all Bethesda games moving forward. 
---
To think i put off playing RDR2 for this.. 
---
I guess I am just getting in with the worst groups lately. 
---
Lol. I‚Äôve put in an actual 150 days of time in GTA online but I‚Äôve also been playing for two and a half years. That‚Äôs still too much time but I was determined not to buy Shark Cards. Supposedly there will be people who play the same on 76
---
They forgot to update the legendary affix name... 1.25x shot.  Double shot is seriously a misnomer.  May as well just change it to something similar to the same sort of thing the +30% scorched damage has.
---
I assumed so, hopefully I'll get lucky unless this bug is acknowledged and or sorted somehow
---
Good point.
---
Level 150something and i have never had an addiction. Not one. 
---
However, i cannot be within a light year of any any enemy without getting a disease.
---
Literally just got 2 texts from my buddies (diehard players) they will no longer be on. Thats 2/10 players I normally play with... Its only gonna get worse and I wont have any of my personal friends to play with. Ive met a few players online but even theyre never on anymore.
---
At worst its a thoughtless dev team. 
---
They should defo offer a respec after major nerfs / changes though yes!
---
Melee has never been a AOE Armageddon 
---
&gt; smallest
---
Is not actually small lol.
---
I've never had a TSE weapon and I am a rifleman build and have no problems taking down any enemy.
---
My anti armour lever action rifle is a beast.
---
If I could get 1 with anti armour and 2 more effects I could one shot level 50+ glowing ones without a crit.
---
Speaking of which if I add in better critical to my used perks I take down level 80 scorch beasts inside one clip
---
I'll give it a shot this evening but my non TS explosive radium rifle was far from OP before the nerf and the ammo grind was a little obnoxious. If this results in me needing to grind even more ammo I'm going to let my feet do the talking.
---
Yes, LadyD is being attentative and taking notes but she must be tired of wearing that  t-shirt "It's hard to soar with Eagles when I work for Turkeys"...or something like that.
---
Whats a reasonable time for someone to browse now? Its a reset to inventory so its not people looking for a few things and leaving now. 
---
I think it skipped over comedy... This is just fucking sad... And now something that should be handled via small update/hotfix, will MAYBE be addressed in a future update. 
---
Anyone else notice damage to Gulpers seems a bit off. Seems like they heal themselves a bit with every shot. Or maybe I‚Äôm seeing things. 
---
I'm so glad the upcoming Anthem game is not going to have it. It might actually be fun. Just hope the final product isn't as messed up as the "demo" last weekend was.
---
Thank you kindly.  I launched my first nuke last night on vault tec uni, and had a server crash shortly afterwards.  I was able to join a world that had a nuke at whitesprings at least to get some experience. I'll do the scorche queen next. Hoping to find some people to team up with maybe 
---
Thank god I took those screenshots of my friends to keep as mementos... :)
---
:( yepppp. Your story makes my heart sad. I'm hopefully my friends won't quit as well.
---
Really don't want post my own sad post to make new PC friends LOL. 
---
If they keep doing exactly how they have done with this game in the past, maybe a few thousand players will be left
---
My Headlamp Bright for the X-01 has an atom symbol. Kinda cool, cause now I can tell my X-01 from my Excavator.
---
So eh.... what do you think of the new lamp? Worth it?
---
Except they will weigh 3lbs in your stash and only 0.3lbs if you carry them and have the perk card.
---
It is a great bit of fun for some 200 hours of gameplay for sure! Discovering all of the locations was phenomenal, and going through all of the quests was a great time too. 
---
After you hit "end-game" and kill the last boss a few times, you kind of run out of meaningful stuff to do *(even getting the serums recipies is pointless, because you can just server hop to buy the serums you want and the rewards for taking another serum are not great)*, and it kind of feels not so progressive in a satisfaction/gaming sense to log on every day, and then you just stop logging on and forget about it. This doesn't surprise me though, because this is how I played every other fallout game since Fallout 3, so this is easily par for the course... I would play them for about 200hours or so, and then put them down for a few years, then I would pick them back up and start fresh again.
---
I assume your friends are throwing this little hissy because of the TSE nerf?
---
I did get it from the Prison Escort Quest ("Patrol Duty"), but it took 7 runs. Also got a few other weapons plans that way, with a couple duplicates.
---
\^ This.  A million times this!  This seems like a bug, not feature, as currently implemented.
---
Some people just have better luck on certain items. It took me forever and countless workshops claimed in order to get lawn flamingos. Likewise I got the fusion generator on accident very early by walking past Poseidon when somebody else  powered it up.
---
Honestly though it's just an achievement like other games have, maybe to show off later but not to be rewarded.. 
---
Very solid patch, should fix a lot of server issues, don‚Äôt agree with some of the intense nerfing though, I think it‚Äôs a huge knee jerk reaction and hopefully gets looked at again.
---
Nah OP doesn't mind that he paid for his plans.
---
Hes gutted that Bethesda is handing out stuff that used to be hard to get to absolutely everyone, because people didnt pay attention and scrapped their set
---
This. I've never seen such an entitled player base. Even when they fix things people are never happy because they haven't fixed EVRRYTHING yet.
---
Next update they will actually just remove energy weapons from the game so they don‚Äôt have the possibility of becoming too overpower, then with come all firearms and then melee weapons then you can play Rock Paper Scissors with ferals before being torn to pieces 
---
I think there's a difference between being OP and just feeling kind of powerful. I want a sense of power but I also want to be challenged. But I don't think they needed to nerf players to achieve this goal. I think the thing that makes the game so easy is the terrible AI. If you know how to use cover then every fight in the game becomes easy, but also painfully slow. If you don't want to endure through the painfully slow grind then you're forced to party up. Basically, I'm not saying the game is too hard to play solo, I'm saying the game is too much of a grind to enjoy if you play solo.
---
Apparently the max weight they implemented is account-wide, so if you have other characters with items, that might be the issue.
---
So a long time ago (ok, like a month or something), back before I had White Knight, I would check the usual places for fiber every time I logged on. I've never been a fan of server hopping, but sorry if that, I'd farm as much as I could. And then I'd pick which of my broken armor pieces to fix so I could put it back on.
---
Obviously, that is terrible. But on the other hand, in the 80+ levels since getting w.k., i haven't gone out of my way to look for ballistic fiber a single time. I might have to repair one piece of armor every few days, not because it's broken, but because it finally fell below 100%, so I can over-repair it again.
---
Now that's great, and obviously I, as a player, don't *want* them to nerf things, but it's ok, in a survival game, to *sometimes* need to fix your stuff, and *sometimes* need to scavenge materials in order to do so. 
---
As nice as it was, I can recognize that a perk that trivializes that aspect of the game, to that degree, was probably *too* good. So they say, how about some middle ground? Last patch, they reduced the cost of repairing mid and high level armor (did everyone miss that?) This patch, they lowered the effects of White Knight. So with the perk, I should actually need to repair armor occasionally now, and it will cost more than I'm used to, but less than it would without the perk, which is still less than it was back when I was struggling to repair even one piece.
---
Maybe give it a week or two, see how manageable it is now, before you start moaning about how terrible the nerf is?
---
How much is the silver shroud? I've been waiting the whole time for this and now I'm out of town.
---
At least that‚Äôs useful for a Plague Walker build. Ew.
---
I'm super excited about that because I found some pretty nice things in there.
---
How much we talking?
---
I won‚Äôt get the chance to play for a few more days and want time for sticker shock to wear off.
---
Yeah, i kept walking and walking and was really confused.
---
what will we do without kid khaos :(
---
Please please PLEASE give me some basic power armor paints. More stuff like the Blackbird paint (but not as egregiously expensive), less gaudy/outlandish stuff like the toy box paint. The lack of even the most basic customization that Fallout 4 gave us with things like the military paint is astounding.
---
Hell, just port over the Creation Club rainbow paints if you have to. Just throw me a bone please.
---
*cough* also maybe some excavator paint pretty please *cough*
---
Yeah man its fucking bullshit that I cant open the console and give myself infinite carry weight so I can just grab everything and never have to go get materials.
---
For real though you people sound ridiculous whinging about having to deal with scarcity in a POST APOCOLYPTIC universe. Nobody cares that you're mad you cant get tricked out PA by farming 1-2 locations endlessly, if you care that much play fallout 4.
---
What they need to do is up the cap supply on the vendors then to compensate.
---
Exactly!
---
I can read, you know. Shame melee is the only way to go now.
---
I‚Äôm disappointed. Explosive weapons did NOT need the nerf to Demo Expert. They were already UNDERperforming.
---
you forgot the part where it uses all your ammo in a couple shots
---
sutton is a raider vendor, though flatwoods and morgantown are both responder.
---
Can‚Äôt find any sources, the only thing that seems to have returned is the Bobby in weight.
---
The worst part is that while people will pay for games that turn out like this begrudgingly, I genuinely feel that if a game took a stand to be entirely well made, with no focus on monetizing it‚Äôs player base after purchase, I feel like the gamer fan base would only too happily dump loads of money into it for being an honest game and not viewing customers as the product to their investors
---
So...basically a bunch of nerfs? Sure some things needed it, but is the game going to get any real improvements or are items going to just keep getting worse?
---
Yeah, my current build was unarmed and explosive... guess I'm just unarmed now.
---
So make it another sort option, but counting the ( in sort by alpha means the plans don't appear with other plans.
---
Rip
---
Who says quests have to be completed immediately.  Sometimes you have to wait for things.  If you can't wait, then you have find a way to work within the limitations.   There are a number of ways to achieve the end result and if you choose not to take advantage of any of them, then that is your choice.   You can choose to wait until you are a higher level or you can choose to go get better gear.    
---
If there was no other way to complete the quest, I would agree with you about it being a bad design.   However, I spent plenty of time in White Springs at lower levels.  I just had to learn where I could go and where I couldn't go.  Learning the game mechanics and using them is what the game is about.
---
My friends did not dupe or buy duped weapons.  We are looking forward to much more play time.
---
Saved it from who!?
---
The only time I see people is SBQ / Whitesprings... 
---
Wondering if they use GIT for their code base. Things like this can happen when a commit gets reverted
---
This should have been an immediate ‚Äúoh shit we fucked up again we need to fix this now‚Äù instead watch it be weeks. 
---
You run out of junk or ammo frequently when doing end game content. It will be many times more magnified with this update.
---
I'm not sure that was the classiest wording but I think I understand what you mean.
---
Have y'all fixed the bug of when you are clearing out or launching a nuke you blue screen because I launched my first nuke and I wasn't able to experience cause the game crashed my whole ps4
---
well don't worry everyone,
---
im sure they will start hotfixing this as soon as i get home from work. it's like a natural law at this point.
---
I'm almost willing to bet if we side-by-side the code for the known plans mod and the change with the patch they will be disturbingly identical.
---
https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/32084597/Tom-Cruse-laughing
---
When?
---
I can't tell my friends "hold out until the next patch".
---
Will it be 1, 2, 3 months for the first real content?
---
One of my friends is already gone, and another one is probably gone tonight.  I'll give it a spin and try to find ONE more friend to play with (cool people are hard to find).  If that new person bows out, I'm probably out as well.
---
Once people drop a game, it's rare that they come back and play it for an extended period later.  I've never done that in any survival game I've played.
---
I tested excavator weight glitch and I wont admit to duping but I can say for sure that the previous method works
---
Two vital updates to perk cards we need as well as the time limited (can‚Äôt just do it over and over) reset
---
-store cards you don‚Äôt want in the swap field, like a trash can, you know just like camp storing
---
-upgrade levels, don‚Äôt have the duplicate level 1, just show level 2+ when we are choosing.
---
Benefits- full upgrade owned  won‚Äôt show at all during picking, and lets us own all levels (since the combining function is gone), and store the ones we aren‚Äôt using
---
Don‚Äôt worry this will all be patched in a month and the original state of nothing showing known will be back
---
*Serious question:* But is acquiring caps that hard to do in this game? Even at 200 caps per vendor faction every 20 hours, earning over a thousand caps per day is relatively easy.
---
Download the update for better inventory from nexus. The map should be ok. You may have to disable Perk Loadout manager until the author updates it.
---
I believe so. I only played 30 minutes, today. New character with Concentrated Fire 1 and I remember wondering why targets‚Äô leg|s kept being chosen.
---
Lol if you think they listen to garbage like this your delusional. 
---
Yeah, if you go onto the Fallout 76 nexus it's one of the top mods. Install at your own risk, etc etc.
---
Excellent!
---
The crashing sucks, nuking is fun the first few runs though defo :D
---
Check the server before doing the SQB, if there's people on it above 50 just hit it up, they will come :D
---
Although everyone's sore about nerfs and unsure about SQB loot table today after patch etc so not sure how many will come, i'd have thought it would be alright though
---
There's two sides to this:
---
Players who run a tank build that have these two shot explosive weapons for a reason. That's how they play the game. That's their build. Yes, they're overpowered. No, they shouldn't have been nerfed that much. The whole idea was to nerf them to the point that other players stood a fighting chance against them. Did it go too far? Maybe so. I can understand dropping both two shot and explosive benefits to +50%. That way instead of a +200% benefit, which is ridiculous, you get a +100% benefit. 
---
I have a two shot 50 Cal. It went from a couple hundred damage to roughly sixty. That's because I'm a melee build. I'm sure the damage is higher for people with builds to suit these weapons. 
---
I'm sure if my melee build got a nerf similar to this, I wouldn't be happy. But if it improves PvP, I'm down for it.
---
Now, the big issue is, there were some rollbacks that I don't think we're in the patch notes. Bobby pins, for example, went back to .1 from .001. Did someone accidentally work from an old Notepad doc? My only concern is was this the only thing? What bugs might have come back?
---
I'm not THAT worried about it. I mean, this should be an easy thing to fix. This should be as easy as copy and paste and send to QA. Prob a good idea to hire some more QA to test all this out. QA folks aren't perfect and they prob didn't expect they'd need to make sure this didn't happen. Human error is a thing. I'm not excusing it, sure. But I'm also not gonna use this as an excuse sit here and hurl insults at the devs. The game has been out three months and they've done a lot of work. Some has brought new issues but who in their right mind didn't expect new bugs? 
---
The only thing I can find posted regarding this over the past day is the bobby pins, and this single post without in-depth information, this is the only thing I can find that mentions cores or duping.
---
Take this with a grain of salt before upvoting, the last thing we need here is more misinformation.
---
Is that 169 per projectile?
---
I know they arent wrong in that aspect, but I had asked in my post "as it pertains to fallout76". I also stated that when I searched that terms all that came up was how to modify a nerf gun (the brand).
---
 Which was why I was asking what it ment when people use it when talking about fallout76 
---
Not trying to start a comment war. Was just looking for info and now I have it 
---
Repair that weapon, then post the screenshot of price.
---
Bethesda doesn't seem to have a clue what they are doing, but this seems like an oversight on your part.
---
Haha, a meta tier "cap sink".
---
Tell me about, these players wanting instant gratification and godly one shot anything builds need to go back to Fallout 4 and using their mod added cheat gear. This is a multiplayer game and no multiplayer game I know of with shooting in it has godly one shot items; they all eventually end up being patched and balanced. This is completely normal for a multiplayer game and people need to calm down.
---
Why no scorched beast queen health nerf also? It was already op with the regularly damage we were dealing. I think she should also have a lvl requirement. No level 46 should be in there with a lvl 25 rifle doing nothing but giving her more spawning health.
---
Noticed this too, also no legendary spawn in westek, medical facility, or sugar grove. Maybe super bad luck but looks like they changed some legendary spawn.
---
Hopefully Devann can get to the bottom of this and we can find out the ETA to fixing it. 
---
God ya'll are never happy huh?
---
I don't want to be forced to use melee. Wtf...
---
Sounds like your friends have the resolve of tissue paper, that sucks.
---
I don't think I understand, I'm just trying to draw attention to a glaring issue that I'm almost certain was unintended.
---
So i still dont see crafting raider armor at any of the vendors. Whats up with that
---
Welcome to bethesda, where we dont have any employees to test out patches and where none of our employees are higher than level 10. Never seen a company so out of touch. 
---
Why did it make shotguns beast? It only gave them one more pellet, like a 12.5% dmg increase, where it doubled the damage of single shot weapons.
---
Yeah, shutting down the servers and giving the devs 24 hours to rush fixes sounds like a really good way to get more bugs than fixes.  If the patch is totally fubar'd, then rollback the release.  Otherwise, hotfix, hotfix, hotfix.
---
"to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks."
---
If you're worried about perks feeling like mandatory picks, what do you plan to do about lockpicking and hacking perks, as well as the perks that reduce the need to eat and drink as much, because those absolutely feel mandatory right now.
---
Additionaly, perks like White Knight that reduce weapon and armor degradation will STILL feel like mandatory picks, due to the insane rate at which things break down by default. This will only serve to make the game more frustrating. 
---
I'm with you on the Demolition Expert, however. 
---
Glass walls and ceilings.
---
More window options for all wall types, especially a shutter option for every type.
---
Multiple colors for each wall type.
---
Log cabin walls (like at that fort in the toxic valley).
---
Variants of that one ceiling piece with the tower on it so it matches every wall type/color. 
---
I think near the Cathedral actually, so it might be a savage divide thing lol
---
You can still do that though, that hasn't changed :)
---
Imagine needing ‚Äòresolve‚Äô to play a video game.
---
Why aren‚Äôt you guys adding new Content? One of worst things about this game right now is lack of content. This game is horribly boring to play right now and I have over 100 hours. Please for the love of god add some damn content 
---
I'm glad that you are working to fix issues, but one patch shouldn't have to fix THIS many problems in the first place. Especially the fifth one. 
---
Butt naked fists. 
---
&gt;full
---
That's the way the server system is set up. Without something like a Steam Chart, or individual servers with player counts, there's no way to know how many players there are.
---
It's all about dem gammas now
---
Because Instead of just looking at the pre and post dmg and instantly complaining I actually went out and tested the weapon before posting to provide some actual fucking insight into the validity of peoples complaints. 
---
How about you follow your own advice and not clutter up MY post.   
---
Feels like the BETA is almost over lol. I still am waiting for more QOL improvements, reasons to play, (not sure if mutations are 100% working still), increased stash size, larger bases, more quests, more fun/story... less repetitive gameplay. everyone i know quit playing or refuses to play.
---
I've been able to stealth every contest except Scorch Queen and the occasional time when I spawn in face three scorchbeast
---
Melle again. No such thing as an end game weapon now... it's all melee again for highest damage.
---
Its melee.
---
It's always been melee.
---
It's been broken and controlled PVP since day one.
---
I‚Äôm level 54 and just have a regular lever action I put regular mods on and I one-head shot any ghoul basically even bloated legendaries.  And I can take down scorchbeasts in about 4-5 shots.  The game is fairly easy without fancy weapons IMO.
---
I am so hopeful that they fixed so that they place correctly. It's the little things. 
---
You open the first instance via the launcher as usual and then open the second by opening the game folder and clicking the exe.
---
lol then you go and add some cringe to top it off, bravo, sir!
---
btw, you're the one that reverted to childish name-calling. never once did i insult you, so that irony is just that much sweeter lol.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Lol don't assume the sky is falling when an apple just dropped. That last part sounds like a YouTube title. "WHAT OTHER ITEMS ARE BEING MONETIZED?"
---
If true they can say byr to their high level players
---
One dude posted his entire paypal transaction history showing how he made ~140 000‚Ç¨ selling TSE weapons over Ebay.
---
Maybe it adds up to the 1500 over pound limit they introduced, it's ridiculous I know, should be per character, not per account
---
&gt;Carry Weight: Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character‚Äôs current maximum carry weight.
---
        &gt;For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
---
        &gt;Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
---
        &gt;Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
---
Hahaha nice one
---
Preach it.
---
that is, in fact true what u say there...
---
in that context its also a fix to the duping :)
---
Amd I enjoy it so fuck off, maybe you should've done research before you bought it
---
Bro they‚Äôre worthless now
---
Laser Gatling ammo is still bugged.  Still shows number of cores when you swap to it, instead of shots in a core.
---
Soo...
---
What is she droping now, still the plans for the ultracite armor ?
---
Or did they add something new juicy since you can get the plans at fort defiant now ?
---
Sure but do you see it on the atom shop?
---
Per pull of trigger, so that's the shots stacked and explosive effect total.  
---
It's not ideal, sure. I'd rather them focus on bugs and balance stuff first rather than new content. I can find things to do on my own. Seems like it'll take a while to get all the caps needed for the T-60 and T-51b jet packs so I'll work on that and just generally having fun with my friends. 
---
&gt; I think I should have the right to feel powerful
---
Imagine being this entitled.
---
melee, meathooks, bloodied. in that order.
---
Your first sentence is so ironic it hurts.
---
I'm not concerned about the limits as none of my characters is really a mule, a couple are over encumbered, but not by more than 200-300lbs or Kgs, or Stones, or whatever the system of measure is.
---
I have heard of players with weights in the millions, so at some point the game will be saturated with cheap stuff, but at this point they may have put a stop to continued duping that will eventually stabilize the game economy, I hope.
---
Worth it, I would have bought them for all my characters at 1000 caps previously instead of having to repeatedly go through that stupid event.
---
So if you‚Äôre gonna nerf all this unnecessary shit, when are you going to nerf the scorch beast infinite screech attack?
---
Great job guys /s 
---
In march, pay attention to the inside the vaults and this subreddit. Also the game's twitter. PVP mode is for sure coming in march and I've heard some other new quests and stuff in march as well. I don't know about survival games, but in all the mmos I've played almost everyone takes breaks in-between patches, it's very common. Especially in this day and age where we have so many amazing video games to play.
---
some youtubers allways try to test out the bugfixes, and appearantly this patch doesnt only nerf us, it brings back old bugs along with entire new ones too :)
---
Shit man.. i love rifles too much to go melee
---
Yup, they should be balancing out melee next which is good; nothing should be outrageously OP.
---
Scrap your bulk. Bulk is broken and you can use it now
---
I dislike negativity a lot but I hate the dev comment about the mandatory pick. It wasn‚Äôt necessary AT ALL except a character desiring to use lots of explosives and missile launchers, like my latest character. I want to see them fix the perk card designs. 5 points is over the top, many weapons are 9 points of picks for +60%. 3 is the best design like basic, expert, master, for one bonus, just like hack and pick
---
I also want to add more but don‚Äôt want to edit in case you miss it. I will reiterate that this is not a PvE only game. PvP doesn‚Äôt need an option to be ignored anymore than it already is. It is not less important or of less value just because you think that you and a majority of players should have had a cooperative only game. This is the game, it is mixed, it is flawed and it is a new game type for fallout. H/h, from what I have heard, is a better experience than in world pvp. You don‚Äôt lose caps, and there are rewards, however insignificant you think they are. Both PvE and PvP deserve to be noticed in this game regardless of imbalance. If no one ever plays it then the balance will never improve.
---
Very well put thank you
---
Already done before you. And you don't own the post. Sorry.
---
I'm not even saying you're wrong about the TSE nerf. Just that there have already been a TON saying what you did. It's becoming a mess. 
---
We have a lot of great PvE content planned for you guys and are working on finalizing a roadmap to show you when those are expected.
---
That's exaclty my point, mate. Instead of doing one small change which would be making Exp 1st prefix instead of 2nd, they nerfed Exp, they nerfed TS, they nerfed Demo expert and totally wrecked entire weapon category along the way.
---
yeah can see that, its defo not on the store though.
---
Some one posted a data mined list (with images) of all this months Atom store changes though and it wasn't in there either.
---
Its prob just a bug tbh, apparently its been reverted back to the crappy not so bright light anyways after this patch
---
Hey at lest you're getting an extra cap when you sell it lol
---
It'll feel faster the second time, because you won't feel the need to stop and explore every ten seconds.
---
So what about all the serums that were duped? Ppl were selling them for as low as 250 caps. Now they are 18k in game. The gold farmer websites got a lot happier today
---
Immediately got my hands on the barn stuff just today at Watoga. First time finding the plans for the walls.
---
Well paln costs for weapons and power armor mods were increased over 4x
---
I 100% feel your pain there.
---
I do a lot of reddit trading so I keep my friends list to fairly clean so I can see new friend invites for trades.
---
I have 10+ players I've friended that I keep on my list at all times.
---
Last night was the first time I saw ZERO players online that I was friends with.  10-15 players on my friends list, and zero of them were online during prime time.
---
Does anyone remember VaultShop?  The hardcore player vendor that sold things constantly all day long?  Gone, not playing anymore.  The next player vendor I found is now offline half the time.  Same with the new one I just found recently.  
---
It's hard to keep friends interested when there's nothing new to DO :(
---
You might be correct, I will update as soon as possible. That being said, other users have reported the serum prices as being the case.
---
\-Is entitled for putting a shit ton of hours into the game and feeling like I should have something to show for all my hard effort.
---
I'll start:
---
D-.
---
its not on the store you get that right?
---
Bloody melee weapons with power attack bonus or swing speed bonus. Bloody ranged isn't as good because it doesn't scale the same
---
My thing is, I would love to explore everything again and stumble across legendary mobs, as I hate doing the same run over and over. Problem is if you even try to go anywhere but the mire and you get a Lego it's lvl 30 or lower useless items.
---
So you‚Äôre asking if grinding for 5 hours a day for 7 days straight to be able to save up 7000 caps for lawn flamingo plans is unreasonable.
---
Yes. Yes that‚Äôs unreasonable.
---
Maybe 3-4 days of grinding for something top tier like a mutation syrum. But not misc. plans.
---
Those probably weren't duped.  People farm serum recipes off of the SBQ.  They're cheap to make when you have the recipe.
---
Lol. I mean they aren‚Äôt the absolute worst superhero outfits I‚Äôve ever seen. Wolverines original spandex one was kinda iffy. 
---
If you'd read my other comments you'd know that's not what I'm asking for. You kinda just assumed that powerful and OP were synonymous.
---
I see that the common plans have been left untouched except the ones in the Enclave Bunker, while everything uncommon and rare have super raised prices. For example the Brick Building set that used to be somewhere around 875 is now close to 1400, and buying the Metal Building set now cost around 2300. Also seeing ridiculous prices on the 3 weapon plans from the military wing vendor.
---
For all we know it was always supposed to give us the plans and it was a bug having them in the SQB loot table.
---
Either way, you've still got your plans and you've still got your armour, it makes no difference to you. You payed the premium price to have them when you wanted them.
---
You might check out Anthem my son who is a video game connoisseur told me its a very good game. Should be out soon. During their Beta they were very aggressive at fixing issues
---
A+
---
Edit: Sorry, the slider is broken, it went past F-.
---
I remember it was just off of a highway, so potentially 
---
Glare so bright I was clearly blinded by it. That‚Äôs extremely discouraging... is it too late for Project Managers to make a comeback? Because they could really use a few 
---
same as always, anything with the sentinel and/or cavalier 3 star mod (preferably assassin if you're going full health) or even just plain ol' unyielding.
---
Everybody panicking about the new patch and you have the gall to post a suggestion?!
---
Psh, the nerve!
---
To be fair, I think the same about you.
---
Well, armor penetration was either nerfed, or next in the lineup.. I forget.
---
C at best.  While they did what they could to make it "functional", they combated that by making some unnecessary changes.  White Knight didn't really need to be changed.  Something that hasn't really been noted is that bobby pins didn't have a carry weight.  Now it is back to the previous (and troublesome) .1 per pin.  I get the point to most of the changes, but I think more harm than good was done here.  Also, something that I noticed with this patch is that you can't do your own transfer if a friend is in a game.  So, there is a cap on how many items can be stored in in-game containers.
---
I am seriously baffled by the logic they used. It's like you said: it does the exact opposite of the claimed reason. 
---
Grow the fuck up and get real.
---
Life isn‚Äôt fair.
---
Nope damage should be capped as well. Cant wait for the melee park cards to be capped as well so max damage perked out is 250.
---
If you weren't born yesterday, how could you have not come across the term before? :D  
---
You take something and you make it less effective.  
---
Yesterday you had an AK-47 in your hands, ripping up targets at the range. During the patch, they swapped it with a Nerf AK-47. Now your foam projectiles are bouncing off the targets. Your weapon was nerfed.   
---
Targets or Super Mutants, the analogy works
---
Just because they're FOR sale doesn't mean they're ON sale haha Dem prices tho
---
I don't know how I feel about FO76 or Bethesda anymore.
---
You can't just nerf perks so they're exactly like the other perks, especially when the items they change are so different. TBH this isn't a hard concept to understand 
---
Release the constuction kit and let us have private servers, I just want to be able to enjoy a game I paid $120 for.
---
Oh man, ya got me
---
Either completely dead, or Pay-to-Win. See today's "Untouchables" ATOM Store update for an example of the start.
---
And serum plans were 21000 caps for me lol
---
A-. With TSE gone, people will stop killing eachother so fast. Ultracite plans finally given for free by completing the Belly of the Beast quest. Vendors do seem to take faster to load and i got the enclave armoury vendor to say already occupied, but nobody was even using it. Therefore, A-.
---
Unyielding for low hp special buffs and vanguards for high hp DR buffs 
---
Oh, well I don't really agree with you ENTIRELY but what you said seem justifiable based on the numerous replies I've received.
---
I just wish instead of nuking things innovate and make things different. Make enemies do various different damages to affect armor damage. Cause players to repair more often by altering or implementing new attack mechanics. Not just nerfing perks... 
---
AA faster fire seems to be the winner with the double explosive nerf . Bloodied if doing the unyielding dual build is also top tier.   
---
Good news.... AA faster fire was the least duped item....bad news AA faster fire was the least duped items so hope you buckle up and got the caps .   
---
This is my opinion playing around with what was weird combos pre nerfing to know what would be next.  With how sad expo is it will free up 5 perk points now so that is also nice.  Otherwise go melee it is OP especially if you have the unyielding cavs bos armor that made the rounds for cheap a bit back. 
---
Are you using stealth multipliers or vats criticals or any other multipliers? Its not gonna make it take 25 more rounds
---
I thought bulked junk was weight neutral compared to loose junk except for lead and aluminum? The only weight lost was the 2 plastic used to bulk. And bulking primarily let you sell junk to vendors you otherwise couldn't sell. 
---
Agreed. I shouldn't be level 50 and choosing to use a hunting rifle over a pipe bolt action because hunting rifle uses .50 cal. The hunting rifle should be higher quality even at .308. And the fact that my pipe rifle lasted for literally ever...It just shouldn't have been that hard of a choice. Good job Bethesda.
---
i predict a hotfix for this in the next day or two.
---
You dropped your red hat. If the TSE weapons being that powerful absolutely and totally encompassed your defining reason to play this game, that says more about what you are compensating for than it does your passion for anything related to the Fallout 76 experience. It is, I might add, pathetic. You‚Äôd be better off leaving and returning to another in the franchise, but it sounds like some therapy might benefit you, too.
---
Now he is Mr. Radtastic, real name Rad Richards
---
Ok Ill stop
---
This isn't really helpful. He's outlining fair concerns, not just all-capsing us and spamming "this game is terrible hurr durr just shut the server down"
---
No, what it did was balance an OP weapon effect.
---
Some heavy weapon explosive type i.e. missile and grenade launchers could have a look into in terms of perhaps weight or added damage but this is nothing but a good set of nerfs moving forward.
---
To the left of it was downhill and across the street was woods?
---
Lets see, with a 200 cap vendor limit and 7 unique cap-pools you can make 1400/day if you don't fast-travel.
---
So a bit less than 13-days of grinding and you can get that Serum.
---
lol them dupers really undercut themselves when they started selling these for 1k - 5k etc 
---
first i thought what?? i have max 255 lbs which i found quite a lot (without power armour) and with the excavator 350 i believe then i thoughts of the duper
---
Keep enjoying making this sub toxic I guess
---
&gt;"you don't know more than everybody else" course
---
I skipped all those classes 'cause I already knew everything.
---
So I dont think he was because he crafted and repaired your PA parts‚Äî you had to bring your suits to him in game, much like you would a automotive mechanic. His digs were well thought out, but modest. Finally, he was adamant he didnt deal in weapons or armor... It was a really fun experience, despite me not bringing the correct PA to him.
---
Get off my lawn, Fox News.
---
Keep crying about it
---
Amen
---
Black powder single shot explosive, 1000 before now just under 500 üòä
---
We killed the scorchbeast QUEEN, I'm pretty sure we arent at the bottom of the food chain 
---
What bugs have been brought back? Only thing of note that‚Äôs consistent is the bobby pin weight 
---
Agreed, cold case is good and so are the workshops in the forest - the junkyard is pretty easy to defend and has a junk extractor. Mysteries can be tough at that level when you go to meet your initial contact - but do-able if you're sneaky and fast - the rest of that questline can more or less be completed in the forest. At least I think I remember it being that way...
---
You are not wrong. Thank you for the voice of reason. 
---
Str8up 
---
I agree, however, a decent pistol that isn't TSE only does like 50-100 at level 50, and I don't want to 1 shot anything, but with my full pistol damage and VATS crit build, I wouldn't mind it taking less 10-15 shots to kill something level 40 when I'm 73.
---
I've been using my Heavy Sledgehammer with mods, the Supersledge, TS Pipe Rifle, and lastly the TSE Gauss Rifle. The Sledges are all good, when the SBQ lands, but that is not often. Often I find myself relying on others with V.A.T.S build to target the wings, and their heavy machine guns etc. 
---
Regarding four times the ammo, well 2EC-ammo is scarse, I had 1000 bullets, but now down to 300. Could craft some more of course, but four times more ammo probably means four times longer time to kill the queen, as well ass a lot more stimpacks, radaway, rad-x etc. 
---
So, Melee nerf incoming then.
---
Cool, more losers to perma ban from the game for wanting instant gratification; always could use more of those.
---
...imma have to run around screaming and grabbing as many cores as I can before this is patched. 
---
Yeah, my weapons are crap -- I have a +1 Strength melee that I think is level 15 and breaks about once a day -- and my armor also breaks daily. I start each day with a refreshing nap and a repair of everything I can... usually don't have the screws to fix everything -- and within an hour of gameplay I'm down one or two weapons and one or two pieces of armor -- sometimes for days until I find enough spare parts to repair them.
---
I'm not the sort that does the farming for legendaries that happily -- breaks immersion if you return over and over like Groundhog's Day to kill ghouls till you die of boredom yourself.
---
Mostly I've put my stats into Str, Agility and Luck, with a few other points in Int. and Perception.
---
Have to shoot thing's 3 times instead of 1 and the outrage is worse than when Alderan was blown up!
---
Lol I got them for free and the 4 I did buy a while back were 100c each. 
---
you can't two-shot them, either. or three. or four.
---
unless you're running around with a wooden sticks with nails taped on to it. *totally realistic!*
---
hope so aswell. it sucks for people that legit needs mules but it also is a way to get rid of flooded items.
---
Oof. 
---
Had about the same amount of people, mix builds. 10 minutes we got it to half health or little lower. Point is ... it‚Äôs time limited and kicker was SBQ healed itself!!!! So, I left. Dunno why some still tried. 
---
I run out of ammo doing end game content too but that doesnt have any effect on junk needed to repair armor (cept steel).  
---
I never run out of junk to repair armor with.
---
Sorry about your Shroud.
---
On a side note though. I am looking absolutely fly my Manta Man costume. No regrets on that purchase.
---
I have a character that's full sneak perks its fun, at least to me. The Evasion perk can quickly make you Stealth after being discovered.
---
this has been going on a lot over the last week or so.  it's fun for the squeakers and twerps it seems.
---
Yeah I have been anticipating this game since early last year. 
---
I wont be buying it right away but I will be keeping up with how it's doing and will buy it if it gets good feedback. 
---
I just don't want to drop 60 on a game that will disappoint like this one has. 
---
My super-fan attitude only took me so far with this game. 
---
It's also literally how wikipedia describes the term 'as it pertains to game balance'  
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_balance#Nerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance#Nerf)
---
A swarm of ants can kill a lion but that doesnt mean lion&lt;ants
---
I'm seeing that pop up more and more now too. It seems that bulk items are not being used to repair or scrap. The current work around is to scrap that bulk item you want to use to break it back into individual parts.
---
A community manager did just confirm bulked items cannot be used in crafting. I am sure a hot fix is on the way. 
---
Two shot wasn't the problem. Otherwise decent patch.
---
Maybe! Wish I could remember better haha, sorry. I‚Äôm wondering if it was the same spot for everyone or if it‚Äôs a recurring texture issue 
---
My TSE lever action rifle went from doing 900 Damage (with max rifleman perks and max explosves expert) to 100
---
Posts like this are why r/fallout makes fun of this sub, and I'd rather not give those assholes any ammunition.
---
Quality troll right here. Congratulations 
---
No of yours, but I understand if you have trouble comprehending responses.
---
marsupial is life
---
What the bloody hell is the point of having a two shot weapon not do the damage of two shots? Like, seriously. Why even call it two shot anymore?
---
As someone who plays casually and want to use the perks that makes my gameplay fun instead of min/maxing, my two two-shot rifles were the best way for me to get any meaningful damage output. Not to mention I already spent a fair chunk of my game time farming materials to build ammo, which isn't exactly super fun.
---
I get that TSE guns were stupidly OP, but surely there's more imaginative ways of managing that than "Oh, I guess we'll just cripple them both".
---
If you think that what they're doing is helping the game get better, thats fine i guess.
---
Ill remain skeptical though.
---
Honest players are the best players. I was just telling my buddies how proud i was that we didnt use exploits and ruin the game for ourselves. 
---
Well my guy you have my upmost sympathy. My friends are the same we are throughout multiple Geo's and Timezones. Please Bethesda start implementing PVE stuff to make people want to play. The promissory of new content while implementing large scale nerfs aren't making the dwindling player base want to continue to play. Especially those who have played since beta/early access.
---
As for you losing friends if your PC can add me Ign: Falloutguy510
---
More than welcome to come play until new content drops and brings back the lads. 
---
Your tears sustain me, peasant
---
Man, alot of people cant even launch the game after update.
---
Im like you have little to no issues but doesnt mean they‚Äôre not there.
---
I definitely agree, some people think you cant release extra content without "fixing the game first." Just saying devs can never win, Ark is constantly bagged on for releasing as much content as they did. People say things like "oh they only care about sales and dont care about the community." Its almost like if a perfect balance between releasing bug fixes and content isnt met, folks will lose their minds. 
---
It‚Äôs the nerf really upsets me how much the nerfed those guns
---
As I said on another comment. I tried to make explosive heavy weapons work. It doesn‚Äôt work. Heavy explosives (outside of auto grenade) were garbage before the nerf to explosives. Nerfing garbage means it didn‚Äôt effect anything about explosive heavys they already weren‚Äôt playable. This nerf was needed for TSEs and they can later buff heavy explosive damage separate from the perks if they want to make them playable. This nerf didn‚Äôt hurt them. 
---
That's stupid, there are places you could find them for like $3.  I mean still real money for it but $30, jfc...
---
If we don't make it clear that Bethesda fucked up, how can they know we don't like the changes? 
---
Regular lvl 68 scorched were taking 2-3 shots to the head with maxed concentrated fire. Roughly the same for the 1-2 ghouls I ran into.
---
Edited my reply.
---
Just wanted to report it to ya man. What ever the clan do to help. I will let them know to break apart scrap before heading out then.
---
i honestly don't know which is worse:
---
the complaints about the nerfs
---
or the cringy posts ranting about the complaints about the nerfs.
---
I do PVP and fight the SBQ and I rarely have to repair my PA. I have both perks that help with this though which are Power Patcher and Fix it Good.
---
&gt; They will just nerf all the Weapons to be on par with Energy Weapons because...why not?
---
Obviously the actual reason is that all the weapons have been overperforming...except for energy weapons of course.
---
That sucks. I think I can craft a shotgun that does more damage than that. Sorry, man.
---
They can't make everyone happy but the right thing to do is add more fixes before new content breaks the game even more. People just want instant gratification and are too impatient these days to wait like normal human beings. I'm up for waiting however long it takes; each major fix that changes things for the better hypes me up knowing that they care and are doing what is right.
---
... you only roll forward.
---
But with the new weight restrictions they are kinda gated, and maybe Beth can see who's doing it now and going over the 1500 weight etc?
---
Haven't seen any proof of duping as of yet though, have you? I had a bet on 3 days after wed see the first dupes again, someone else said 3 hours...be interesting to see who's right lol but still no need to bring servers down is it?
---
I'll admit that's a large part of it, I literally can't read through the comments on any kind of YouTube gaming video without finding a slew of "76 Sux!!!1!" comments, but Bethesda's made some serious mistakes at this point. Undoing their own technical patches being high on the list.
---
Didn't they stagger console patch releases from PC just for this sort of thing?
---
If you're on PC I'll join you. I'm finally getting up there level wise where I can participate in the end game stuff, though I dont have any particularly great legendaries. Even bought a headphone with a mic so I can stop being the idiot just waving to people all the time 
---
They want to run off all the fans and go bankrupt. Must not be Bad enough they only sold a million some copies and isn't even mentioned in top 20 game sales. 
---
ohhh, didn't know the name of the station. Thanks
---
They weren't brought in line. 
---
The more weight=more boom, was supposed to be the balance, now you have 35 pound weapons doing same damage as 15 pound weapons. That is not balance. If it were , the ammo and weapons would weigh the same. But they do not. Rockets weigh 2 pounds each, mini nukes weigh 6 pounds each, a modded rocket launcher weighs 40 pounds. So you think that a shotgun that weighs 20 pounds , with ammo that weighs .003, or is it .001, I don't recall , is IN LINE. No ... no it isn't at all
---
They're at Camden park too.
---
Census violence and AWOL Armaments has a chance to reward the plans, Ive received 1 from each.
---
I got mine at the end of November from census violence and like two weeks ago on my second from census violence also. 
---
Welcome to Fo76 Season 2: Melee Meta
---
Directly south of whitepsrings
---
But it‚Äôs okay
---
Watoga station sell them too
---
Yeah, a welcome change. The reason i gave up on lockpicking was more that i cannot even carry the stuff i get from open containers.
---
joins in furious missle launcher...... shitwait 
---
With 1000 stacked bobbleheads sure
---
Melee and unyielding/blooded needs be addressed seriously (-50% nerf) given the current state of TSE
---
I bulk everything...I‚Äôm fooked 
---
Nope, as long as EA is in business, they'll still be second best... er, or worst, I suppose.
---
Our fallen brother...
---
No need for any links or explanations, we can easily circlejerk about any bullshit you pull out of your ass,
---
I see whitespring and the town in the lower left. Watoga or something? I'm  still pretty low level and no fallout friends so I haven't done one yet so I don't know why they do those. :(
---
LOL at anyone who paid IRL cash for this game.
---
To make them place correctly, you have to have a foundation on both sides of the door, or it will only place one direction
---
Nice!!!
---
The game isn't as bad as the reviews, its just that the criers had a louder voice, and for some reason still cry on as we all stopped listening a long time ago, its a good game with a few bugs far less bugs than red dead
---
if you're using PA i'd recommend the emergency protocols torso mod.
---
If you‚Äôve got that from the one post on the front page I‚Äôd advise you to take it with a grain of salt, the bobby pin weight has been established but I have yet to find citation on the other two.
---
Exactly how I built my char. You never know what will be buffed nerfed weapons dropped.  However I do like the idea of breaking points out of a card even if it continues me a level.
---
Every other weapon type takes 9 points to get to +60% damage. Except unarmed, which doesn't even grey the option to go over +20. So you're upset that demo only goes up to +60 now, and it takes 5 whole points to do it? It's still better than any other weapon class damage perk. 
---
I think they should lower it to 3 points, +10/15/20, and then add an expert and master version, like every other weapon. And add expert and master iron fist while they're at it.
---
Try picking up a rocket launcher...
---
Two shot explosive. They‚Äôre getting nerfed/they are
---
Did you try Phoenix, the BoS vendor in Watoga shopping plaza?
---
I saw BoS plans in Welch pre-patch too.  Pretty sure that's where I first got my BoS mod plans for Combat Armor arms.
---
That would be incorrect anything of value was duped and duped a lot
---
Not even. It's been done before without bobbleheads or exploits. Sorry that your tiny brain cant comprehend that
---
üòë apparently....
---
Pvp players only it seems. I hate pvp.
---
Let's see...
---
+Evening out PVP a bit with the TSE nerf
---
+Known tag on plans and recipes
---
+Area chat indicator (which I don't when remember reading about
---
+General other bug fixes
---
-Bobby pins weight reverting, which may mean an assload other things reverted and that may include duping methods
---
-Several other bugs and balances that are left to other patches
---
Overall, C, but can be a B if no duping methods got accidentally reverted and I'd they can get together a quick patch for later this week or next week to undo the reverts.
---
I think it's any event in the 'bog, but I'm just not having any luck since the last patch (not the one today).
---
i am experiencing this too.  none of the generators i have stopped at in the last week have had any fusion cores in them.  always empty.  i am completely out of them and can't find anymore.
---
I think people are confused. When the community leads post in here about bringing something to the attention of "Dev," that's just a guy named Dev that they like to chat with.
---
And all energy weapons are useless. For some reason.
---
F.
---
Reverting to old version? Solid Fail.
---
Isn't this just post-rationalisation? There's no real reason for the plans to be this expensive. Unless you wanted to limit their availability in the world. However, instead of luck-gating (which is fairer to all), now it's cost-gated.
---
Now it makes those that have muled their caps and used cap exploits have an advantage over legitimate players that perhaps don't have as much time to play the game to earn those caps.
---
However, the cost increase isn't even the worst thing. They didn't even bother to mention the cost change in their patch notes at all, like they didn't want to draw attention to it.
---
Unfortunately my friends and I won't be playing in another month.  They'll quit and drag me into another game.  95% of the time when that happens we don't come back to a previous title (or we'll visit on rare occasions like Overwatch).
---
Last night was the first night where 100% of my friends list was offline at some point.  10-15 people I have permanently friended and not a single one was on in prime time.
---
It sucks :(  I want Fallout to succeed.  I'd love to play more, but everyone I know keeps quitting.
---
It's called private servers. They said they will be released end of this year.
---
With all due respect, working around problems will only piss people off even more. A game from a studio of Bethesda's reputation should try to make life easier for players, not harder. I fully understand these things do happen, and it's often beyond the developers' control. But a prompt hotfix is in order. This is the least we can expect from a patch: not breaking things that were working or were fixed. I sincerely hope a fix is in works already. 
---
If this were "100% faster", then you could compare to "100% more than 1."  But we have a subtractive case here instead of additive.  So "100% more slowly" is actually "100% less than 1."   
---
 In fact, 100% less than anything is always zero.
---
Agreed.  Paying to play is a horrendous feature. 
---
I'm going to assume that everyone here has a explosive/build character (or is exploiting the game/glitches/bobbleheads/ unyeilding etc..) well the weapon is op so I'm glad that this effect is being buffed. Time to switch builds fellows (mine's a melee build) and for anyone upset its for the community response. 
---
If I could bottle this water and use it as needed that would be great.
---
As it is I‚Äôd rather wait the disease out then go through loading screens
---
Yeah exactly, so you can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs dead either 
---
If you are XBOX and have Master Science I can craft it for you for materials only.
---
You guys done jerking each other off or what?
---
In game now and my "bulked items" aren't recognized in crafting or repairing unless I scrap the bulk items and have on my person.  Was this intentional?
---
Holy crap!!! 
---
It‚Äôs like they buffed all the plan prices!!!! 
---
Grafton Vendor in the town centre, not the station one.
---
true, true
---
What I find funnier is how for Haters, Todd Howard is the new Obama.
---
Duping ? Todd Howard's fault. 
---
Items sold on eBay? Todd's fault. 
---
Bad RNG drops? Todd's fault.
---
Pizza Pockets undercooked? Todd's fault. 
---
Canned Food event fix the community didn't want? Todd's fault. 
---
Wife cheated with the mail man? Todd's fault.
---
Stashbox went from 598 to 374, from the loss of bulk items, mainly. 
---
Haha, wow that's bonkers.
---
Well that answers one question. I'm still curious about the others, but the targeting hud bug makes sense. Thanks!
---
I took it off the under armor and it was the problem now it clean. LoL Jesus 
---
I‚Äôve seen them around the mire, near tangra town
---
Why post in a subreddit for a game if you‚Äôre just gonna complain
---
The second gold revolver picture has a familiar character. I'm guessing the Silver Shroud costume is in the Atom store next time.
---
Whitesprings is very ghoul infested and thus makes it a haven for legendary farming when every ghoul becomes a level 68 Bloated Glowing One. However, its hard to get anything done there when EVERYONE is slaughtering them so much.
---
Maybe that's different now that TSE is a moot point...
---
Please
---
I have an Associate's in Computer Programming so I kinda understood what you meant. Thanks for showing me something new!
---
Damn, Bethesda is actually incapable of doing something with introducing bugs to it huh?
---
Well, seems they fixed my complaint with the recent patch. You can now buy plans for most calibrated shocks. The cost is over 5,000 caps and it requires a lot of rare flux to build. 
---
That is not unreasonable.  It's doable with some grinding, as opposed to impossible no matte how much grinding you do. 
---
Seems like one of the moonshines did.  Don't quite remember though.
---
Hold on now, abandon 76, sure, but don't do something you might regret. :P
---
I just tested it :) same way to get it to 400 as before patch :)
---
Melee build-No ammo,bullets,grinding materials. 
---
Problem solved
---
If I have a duplicate of a plan or recipe I have been dropping/giving it away since day one. Shouldn't be an issue.
---
This. I think Aluminum and Gears are the only thing that weigh less after bulking? Or Springs? Anyway, that's it.
---
Now they need to Nerf 1 shot Melee builds!
---
Wish I'd known about this weeks ago. Spent something like 15-20hrs server hopping at harpers on an alt....still never found the plans. 
---
You can always double check and try using them.
---
Or you can save them and try to trade/sell them to players.
---
The dupe glitch involved 2-3 players at the same modus terminal so this was there fix for it.
---
My complaint is that the game is too much of a grind to be enjoyed and that nerfing players only makes this worse. If you don't think that's a valid argument then go ahead and enjoy your boring slog of a game.
---
You forget how old the staff at bethesda is man... they didnt have fancy stuff like that for this
---
gorramit
---
Do you remember where Census Violence popped? I sometimes get Mirelurk recipes and crap when it pops near the little bog lake thing. I wonder if I'm just getting unlucky with the location spawn.
---
It's supposed to spawn from any of the Bog events but I just can't get it.
---
The Whitesprings bunker vendor seems to be broken. No idea if those plans will be there.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many people have. I can‚Äôt deny there are players who love the game as it is now. I won‚Äôt deny I loved Sea of Thieves when it had just released. I was in the minority. People have their opinions of the way they like games but that‚Äôs not what Bethesda is looking at. They‚Äôre looking at $$$$
---
I'll be happy when, after playing since first day of PC beta, I see one. single. X01. calibrated. shock. 
---
That would be fun, but that's too late for me. I have to go up early for work every morning. 23:00 is the latest I play GMT+1
---
I'll add you though, maybe some other time.
---
Thankfully both the perk loadout manager and better inventory had updates so back to a ‚Äúplayable‚Äù fallout experience. Thanks for the help! 
---
It does to that dead lion...
---
I don't agree it's needed for the SBQ, it's just the crutch people wanted to lean on.  
---
Having people run around with TSEs one-shotting every creature was more than annoying, it was infuriating. 
---
do you really need to carry 300 pins to solve those minigames???
---
I got plans for the stealthy version, but not how to create it from scratch. As far as U am aware, you can't get the plans to make it from scratch.
---
**FUCK**
---
I was honestly hoping for that
---
Well beforehand cap stashes were shared server wide and provided only one person of the server with caps and poofed when they looted it. Now every single cap stash in the entire game is a container that can be looted twice with the cap stash perk in tow. If you are hardcore enough you could literally farm the entire map for infinite caps by moving from stash to stash; using your perk to collect 2 amounts of caps from each one. Caps from now on will be extremely easy to get for those who want to explore and travel the map for income.
---
Yes, I feel you. I don't usually pre-order but my Fan-Girl wife insisted on getting game so I didn't cancel pre-order after Beta. Even I would not have imagined the game this game having so many game breaking issues for this long into its game cycle. Now with the TS nerf I don't have to worry about that anymore.
---
Hmm. I guess if they get a bounty from damaging your camp, then you would not need slap to PvP them (?) so it's functionally the same thing. Not sure if the game expressly treats camp damage the same as slap though.
---
They could just drop it on the ground...
---
I've never played a game where an enemy is such bullshit that I just log out...
---
And in my defense, I always log out when I hear those wings flapping, it's just this time I figured "fuck it, maybe I'll get something" because every now and then a regular cancer bat drops an ultracite receiver plan (bug or feature? I don't know).
---
There's this thing..... Called balance.
---
Every online game has to make adjustments to certain things.
---
It's like no one playing 76 has ever played any other online game fucking ever. 
---
Why request Nerfs? Why nerf something popular? Just fix other things instead. 
---
If you don't adjust from both ends (Nerfs and buffs) and just scale everything else up to compete with things that require a nerd you end up with a shit show.
---
Bulk junk is useless now, duping again, explosives weapons like fat man is trash now, double loading screen still, Bobby pin weight is back. Logged in for 3 minutes. Logged back out and went back to FF 14. What a shame. "Let's all take a minute to thank Bethesda for x!"
---
I just love all the chicken little "sky is falling" posts after every patch and "inside the vault".
---
Fucking hilarious
---
You realize that the more people complain about the lack of game content, the more they are going to do nerfs like this to keep people busy grinding
---
Never said you had too üòÇ
---
Oh sorry, by ladders i meant stairs actually, sorry for my english :p Try to remove stairs (stone,wood dosent matters). Hope it helps!
---
Melee has always been at a good spot (mostly) but weapons overall are a bit useless. Bloodied atleast you have to sacrifice life so chances of death goes up. Thats a mechanic; sacrifice one thing to gain another. Most people just want everything with no negative effects.
---
They didn‚Äôt nerf them to prolong the game they nerfed them to please the PvP crybabies 
---
Flamers, Gauss (this one is weird because it's ballistic), Laser, Plasma, Tesla...
---
Are you serious! WOW 
---
400 hours is 16 days. "Ive been playing this game for 16 days and now I'm getting mad! We need to question the teams working on this game that I played for 16 days! How can this happen? How can devs be this way? I wont play any longer than 16 days! 17 days? No way! Fuckin engine!" 
---
You'd think someone with 400 hours played would show a little more patience during the development process.  
---
I agree. My point is that they are working on it. Every single patch will please some people and piss some people off. It is impossible to please everyone especially for Fallout fans apparantly. 
---
Wait does this mean you can get the handmade rifle above level 15
---
When this game was announced, I thought it would be a more coop and community focused title where you take back the Wasteland. PVP would evolve naturally from conflicts over resources and locations as the communities grew. Some of the bones are there in workshops but the everything was so woefully implemented this dynamic wasteland was never to be. Instead they ram PVP down your throat and try to create artificial drivers to PVP rather than use the sandbox to create a natural tension.  
---
dude go to BoS vendor in Watoga 
---
Phoenix will hook you up!
---
Lol, lies and over exaggerating. Have fun with Mickey mouse and Disney. Wasteland ain't for you. I'm happy with the patch
---
I have taken to dropping any plans that I dont need at the first camp, new players (or anyone else) can just collect the ones they need from there, of course thjis will become slightly less now wew know which plans we already know! but all the same :)
---
It's alright. Everything is alright.
---
The "Targeting HUD" makes creatures glow red, there was also a Recon Sensors (Exact name? blah) that works like a recon scope in FO4 (Once you target a creature, they get a marker that tracks them as they move), haven't seen it yet in 76, might be in there? 
---
Seriously! Whats the point of perk packs giving me (over time) 5 cards of things like master science? Do i really need level 1 and 2? Theyre only useful at crafting tables so I dont just run around with level 1 or 2 equipped. Just let us scale the cards up or down depending on what we need.
---
I mean the number of people who have stopped playing speaks for itself. Even this reddit is 1/4 the size it was at launch. The game is a boring slog of a grind and if you don't agree then that's your opinion. But don't come at me with your stupid assumptions at how I play the game simply cause I posted how I didn't like about the nerfs. It's pretty clear that you're just intollerant towards anyone who doesn't like the game as much as you do.
---
Mickey mouse is proud of you
---
Watoga sells the handmade plans as well
---
Before bringing in new furniture you have to put out the fire.
---
There was no way to balance other weapons while the milestone was TSE shotguns, but now we will be able to balance it 
---
nope only mods

&gt;anti-dupe weight fix
---
As if that's fixing anything.
---
This change singlehandedly adds an endgame to f76. Now you actually have something to work towards. Having plans locked behind RNG and hours of server hopping was just stupid. For the past month I had to go around overpaying people for the most exotic shit just to stay out of the 25k cap limit. Now there's actually something to spend caps on. They're no longer completely useless!
---
lol no thats only for mod plans
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ is that a mic drop and a casual stage right exit i hear üëç
---
They break as they should. Only bulk items dont work.
---
Can you cite that? Or are you just regurgitating false headlines again just like a quarter of this toxic community?
---
I think you need to buy the previous plan tiers for casual under armor
---
/r/iamverysmart
---
Step 1: Implement new weight limit
---
Step 2: Intentionally cause server crashes every 48 minutes for a week so items dropped by dupers and exploiters will be removed from the game world and be deleted forever
---
Step 3: Deal with the "server stability is crap since the patch" complaints
---
Step 4: Enjoy a rejuvinated game economy.
---
The master plan is revealed...
---
KH3???
---
Must be what I'm thinking of, cheers
---
Alright, is there anything this patch ***didn't*** break?
---
It's a valid point. Have a friend take what your 5 characters and his 5 characters need for daily cap runs and call it a day. Or, are people not that smart to do that... I mean what if the character has over 1,000,000 weight.. could take forever to dissect that character from cap vendors.
---
I paid 1500 with 2 levels of hard bargain. A friend of mine who has no levels of hard bargain reported it costing 3000
---
When ever I logout of the game with power armour on it drains the power of the fusion core so I always have like one less every time I log back on. Is this a bug or am a stupid?
---
Yeah, the red bars seem to be a different issue, and common to everyone, but people seem to be getting different results about which bot types aggro them. 
---
aw, thought I saw it there. :/ sorry
---
Sounding a little salty there
---
Looks like he went a little too far into the YouTube sink hole. Remember how the game was gonna add pay to win loot boxes? I wonder why I can‚Äôt see them 
---
Oh boy, if you think anthem is complete or polished...
---
Thank you so much. 
---
Be nice if we could set up our perk cards for multiple decks to swap out for different builds or circumstances we could change on the fly.
---
Wood is easy to find if you willing to run around, just walk thru the forest, if log on the ground or every group of down trees are collectable, just click on tree and take logs. Also look inside and around houses, camp sites, every group of cut logs you can take. If there is a group of logs in front of the fireplace or on the back deck, you can collect them.
---
Also certain works shops allow you to build harvesting machines for wood, so you can farm those but it isn't necessary. Also you can build your camp next to a wood deposit and farm wood all day long (much easier).
---
Junk and materials are everywhere, every building, always stash your most valuable materials gears, springs, screws etc. Never sell or give away springs ever. They always needed and hard to come by. People will alway ask you for springs. You need to to repair and build end game Power Armour.   
---
Collect every telephone, typewriter and clipboard you see. Almost every building will have clipboard if you looking for them, they all over including on counters at vendors or behind counters at vendors.
---
Here some tips

---
That's quite a bit of bobby pins. I like to keep it around 20-30 since there isnt many locks to pick tbh.
---
That has to do with being in a group and someone exiting to the main menu.  I've had it happen to me a lot.  Check the social tab, team, and make sure you aren't in that on a team with no members or a member at the main menu. That fixes it for me.
---
but, I do agree, this could use a fix.
---
Wtf, act like they didnt nerf it? How many people are saying they basically werent nerfed? Ya it got nerfed but guns dont need a damage boost, you can boost damage through sneak, crits, weak points, chems, perks, bobbleheads,multiple options for you there to boost damage output, using a tse pre-patch while taking advantage of these multipliers was stupidly overpowered, and i disagree two shot was not fine, double damage was way stronger than any other option you could get for guns, and melee needs a nerf too, and it will eventually come even if bethesda has not announced that they are going to be nerf melee
---
I have the lesser plans. They're broken unless a vendor sells them now.
---
Telling you guys this is all a Vault-Tec experiment funded by the Institute. I can't be the only person that has noticed the mannequin population is going up....  
---
Yes, as a matter of pure fact, they do.
---
IS THIS A 30 ROCK REFERENCE THANK YOU SIR 
---
Funny cause I can kill all of those things without a TSE and without using more than a couple of stimpaks. If you can't play the game without your misbalanced OP weapon then get good or get out. 
---
Agreed - too many games do crap like this.
---
I completely agree with you it is bullshit. I gave up hoping the game was going to be fixed and not just nerfed. It‚Äôs along the lines, change what you have control over and fuck the rest. This is how their broke unbalanced game is. 
---
Which part exactly was a lie or over exaggeration?
---
All depends on your play style. Over 100h for me and I am lvl 69.
---
I am not big on chasing levels myself. I am more an explorer in PvE mode and to date the PvP did work for me. That will change for me now with the nerf to TSE and the updates to Hunter / Hunted.
---
I do enjoy loot farming lately but that only started after I got addicted to other looter shooters and loot farming there.
---
&gt; don't come at me with your stupid assumptions 
---
&gt;&gt; pretty clear that you're just intollerant towards anyone who doesn't like the game
---
lordy lordy good luck kid
---
I think later on they'll (Bethesda) will re-buff up the grenades as separate category or something but they just wanted to buff anything that is labeled as explosives for now as to clear the subject for the OP usage. 
---
Not everyone likes to farm ghouls at Whitesprings all day. Just getting on and playing normally for an hour or two doesn't even give me a level.  
---
I don't understand why you're trying to defend Bethesda after they just ruined a sizeable amount of players' builds by nerfing the explosives perk. (I'm not talking about TSE builds either.)
---
Yea I think I‚Äôm in the same boat friend. I‚Äôve been defending nearly everything and every decision in the game thus far because at least the good will or intention was there even the execution sometimes fell flat but this.... this not only missed the mark completely but killed the innocent players just standing off to the side in the crossfire. At this point they need to do a full roll back, game build at the very least and maybe even just do the characters at this point. And even that may be too little too late to keep people interested.
---
That's *with* Hard Bargain? Yikes.
---
Yeah this, I was so excited my brain stopped working lol.
---
Oooh.. I wasn't supposed to play tonight. But one hour can't hurt.. Or five.
---
The Bobby pins weight reversion just pushed my stash over the 600 limit and now I can't seem to pull things out of my stash
---
This patch is going to kill my ammo supply. I'm back to shooting super mutants several times versus one to two shots. Glad I spent all that time farming plus tens of thousands of caps to get my weapons, just to have them nerfed into the ground. **I do not dispute that there has to be some balance with TSE weapons, but these changes are lazy!**
---
Drive up a hill then put your car in neutral and test your theory
---
"Changed Concentrated Fire was. Last body part chosen target it will." -Fallout Yoda
---
Target the head of enemy one. Kill enemy one. Head of enemy two is automatically targeted. 
---
melee scales so well with strength you can have 2K damage on a hazmat suit. considering my TSE shotgun now deals 250 damage, how is that fair?
---
also, you clearly don't know about sentinel gear. with a full set, bloodied doesn't have to worry about dying- at all. and even then, 45.000 (that's thousand) damage per sneak attack sounds a bit, aham, excessive.
---
but more to your point, with this nerf, real explosive weapons, like the Fatman, which were already crap before, perform even worse.
---
primarily Melee or with ranged?
---
2 words. Hand made.
---
C+
---
Good QOL changes but some annoying unintended bugs

Meh I still don't need to fire a single shot for my legendary farm

---
yeah in fairness it should have been much better quality before launching.
---
Todd appearing everywhere right before spouting off his "it just works" lines then going awol when it doesn't is wrong.
---
It will get better with time, majority of players could have waited and purchased when it was better though, not when Bethesda's higher up's decided they needed a cash injection.
---
It's crazy on how every other game people look forward to patches.  
---
Hey, I've done that before!
---
There is never enough positive feedback, people are far too quick to say what they dont like, rather then what they do. - Me im over 100 hours into the game on PC (also own it on xBox) and not since F2 have I enjoyed a Fallout game as much - this for me (and im sure many others) is the Fallout game we have always wanted.
---
I am definitely more of a guns blazing kind of player. I also will mainly be playing by myself. 
---
Have a 2 shot Gauss rifle was 1500 dmg now only 450 I gotta laugh 
---
That seems to be the theme with every patch. I have faith in Bethesda but, every patch I lose a little. Ive never seen it this bad on this sub since the dupe debacle. 
---
D
---
Both and the side quests are predicatable. I work for lasting effort, often circling the same region, but if I go to a new one, well there is a new side quest. No rela story tho, there might be readable, but that doesnt really get me. 
---
I dunno, I am a big Fallout fan and I will always love this game but, they need to work on teamplay. Its not happening thus far.
---
Honestly I don't think that's unreasonable. As it stands, I think a fully charged gauss rifle to the face not in sneak attack might be 2 shots? I don't think it's one shot if out of sneak. 
---
Same here and I‚Äôm guessing because I‚Äôm on console any fix will not be a hot fix but a long wait for another update :(
---
We came to destroy your life and take everything........god sent us........Kisses
---
If you're on PC you can find keys for like 10 bucks already. The game is a dumpster fire, but for 10 it's ok I'd say.
---
&gt;**Workshop Previews:** The player‚Äôs current Atom balance no longer appears truncated when viewing an Atomic Shop item in the workshop preview at 16:10 and 21:9 resolutions.
---
Good thing they fixed the Atomic Shop again for us 21:9 users, though!
---
I stand corrected.
---
Yeah. Excavator is similarly priced in Grafton.
---
Thankfully I've been doing my daily sales route and hoarding primarily of late, so it only hurt a lot.
---
full sentinel here my afro-american friend. you better be fast.
---
Hey, saw you mention the bulk crafting issue. That‚Äôs the only other mention I‚Äôve seen (didn‚Äôt look THAT hard) so have they addressed it? Not much I can do in terms of ammo and PA modding until it‚Äôs fixed. 
---
If it's weightless it has value to me. 
---
Two Shot could have really just stayed at 100% dmg and they could have had the weapons break at 200% rate of decay. Takes a genius to come up with this stuff..
---
they can still add caps even if patchnotes say they cant 
---
Showing they used an old ‚Äúpre-dupe nerf‚Äù build.
---
No verification on the return of old methods yet,  just a very strong likelihood.
---
But I sure am glad they also fixed License Plumber. It was just so ridiculously useful and broken making those already top tier pipe weapons even better that I didn't use it at all since it was so disgustingly good.
---
That's not so bad in the long run really though :D
---
Be thankful people are reporting more
---
The best way to use your .38 rounds is to drop them on the ground and use any other gun instead. 
---
Did you ever find a solution to this through gamestream? Entering login details is a pain!
---
Yes they do. So max +45 extra health. Hardly pay to win lol
---
I actually was referring to the fact the nerf affected my grenade launcher.  And I would make assumptions like you did,  and say you are Hillary supporter that cried like a baby when she lost. But that would bring me to your level.
---
Maybe the ghouls have VATS too.
---
Me too. Seems like a feature but not according to the other poster. We‚Äôll see I guess 
---
Two Handed Melee. At least until they nerf that, too.
---
I have spent the last 20 levels with a Lv45 handmade. No legendary effects. has a hardened receiver, that was pure luck I pulled because I have only collected a couple before to scrap. with rifle perks, I think I do \~103 damage. 
---
I have explored all over. run silos, SBQs and nuked whitesprings with it. I can take out all the adds in 5 or so shots. I probably do exactly jack and squat to the queen, but when she lands I unload on her face (giggity?) I do my part. 
---
Since I have never been "elite", I just don't see it any other way. running around normal has not stopped me from playing the game. 
---
(FWIW on SBQ, I have beaten her several times with no TSE guns being used. It is easy to know when one is. pretty distinctive. The peeps running plasma gatling set ups seem to be the ones that take her down the best in my experience. My fastest fight was when squad of like 6 plasma gatling-ers showed up. It was a light show, that is for sure!).
---
Can't wait to see how my TS lever action is now...
---
Have played since the patch but how over-encumbered are your other characters? Is it calculating a total weight across the board (probably not likely) or is it checking to see if one character is over the limit, then disabling all of them?
---
Like I said, I wish they would start. So far I haven't seen any acknowledgment that they are even looking at it, thought admittedly I haven't dug for it.
---
Perks yes, TSE no. I have a level 35 TSE dragon and it still massively overpowers my other gear despite not even being max level. I can only imagine how much better TSE weapons that don't take 10 seconds to reload are.
---
Now all I‚Äôm shooting is ultracite railway spike lol my TSE is dead 
---
Why, thank you. 
---
Lol.
---
If I play again I do have 14 points saved for respec, but who can say they wont change it all again.
---
Im not too upset I never use explosive weapons anyway. Sticking with and for always Melee build
---
My TSE 10mm pistol was actually useable at higher levels, which was amazing because it made a useless weapon, useful again. I have always loved the 10mm pistol and am sad when the inevitable time comes to throw it away because it no longer deals enough damage. The TSE mods allowed me to use a weapon that was previously useless to my build/level again and now it‚Äôs most likely useless. 
---
Fallout is my all time favourite series and even I haven‚Äôt played in a month. Some QoL changes are good but the nerfing doesn‚Äôt make me want to come back. 
---
Agreed
---
It should be 40% since you can/ could combo it with your perk cards. Perk cards are where the extra damage should come from, not random rolls on wealon combos. I find going near or over the threshhold of 50 makes stuff stupid OP. I still think TS and E should be in the same category cause the clmbo is too game reliable. People shouldnt have to rely on game breaking combos to do damage. I still think that things are okay with explosive but the TS nerf was heavily needed.
---
Yes please.  I am almost afraid to get home, patch, and see how much I need to level to change things around.
---
Yup that works, if you currently have that perk available. 
---
Just wait until survivor mode comes out!! Even more people will be getting upset over their repair bill. Might as well not even wear armor lol
---
Hm? The bulk crafting thing I mentioned has to do with Bulk Springs and other bulked junk not being usable for crafting. You have to scrap each Bulk object down to the Loose Springs to actually be able to craft with it. It's that way for every crafting item you can bulk.
---
Considering the patch is hours old I don't think anyone has addressed it.
---
I think one of the easiest fixes here would be to make explosive do fixed damage, that way explosive perks don't have to take a pummelling while stile fixing the problem. 
---
Completely agree with this... logged in today for 5 minutes and thought this game has just got far worst and decided no longer too play even though yesterday I was having a great time playing! 
---
Says someone who called fo76 the best game ever 22 days ago.
---
Wow. Making explosive weapons EVEN MORE USELESS! Thanks 
---
The mod that did the exact same thing had the same problem before the patch, I think it's an inherent problem related to the engine and how all the characters on fallout 76 are on the same "save file". Maybe they'll find a workaround but I wouldn't hope for it
---
If you add any .50 cal receiver to a hunting rifle it should do more damage than the .308. 
---
I don't even know why that option exists. 
---
What is happening is most likely the opposite of what the OP is stating. 
---
Many bots are requiring players to wait 3 to 5 minutes before any caps amount or inventory loads on the bot. I simply AFK until it loads. 
---
30% Base boost would make all guns and Legendaries Viable. So dropping a small percentage of CriTs would be fine long term.
---
Bethesda also need to create separate Weapon profiles for PVE and PVP. I was a PVE player. That doesn‚Äôt Matter now I‚Äôm done with the game forever. 
---
I hope you enjoy the game...but the game is about to die because of the over Nerf. 
---
Have a good day and no use to comment any more on this. I‚Äôm done with Fallout76 in all facets including the Reddit‚Äôs.
---
A game that probably took too long to make, but at least cares about what the finished product looks like.
---
Unlike Bethesda.
---
I play sneak sniper build. I've never had a TSE (never been fortunate enough with drops) and drop all level 68 scorched/ghouls with a single headshot. I use a regluar level 45 Lever Action Rifle, no legendary affixes.
---
I'm by no mean criticising but to me and players like me, the changes to TSE do seem more balanced? Or am i failing to see the issue having never owned a TSE?
---
I don't think they really care that much. I'd have thought Fallout would be considered a flagship product, but it sure doesn't seem like they concerned about keeping their player base.
---
Yeah this game seriously needs some co-op incentive. Most events can be done solo and really the only time I ever have to work alongside someone is for launching a nuke or SBQ fights. And I want more of thay
---
Give us SBQ-equivalent bosses or other PvE endgame content tied to nukes. Dungeons, raids, whatever it takes. The PvP is not really engaging and I highly doubt I'll go anywhere near survival mode
---
Ruined it completely 
---
For what was supposed to be an end game weapon yes. The lmg only does 20 damage now. Cant wait for the soon coming melee nerf!
---
So basically what I get from this is: all bugs that help a player, got to go. Ones that stick their thumb up the players ass? Oh those are here forever. Thanks Bethesda. Very disappointing. :/
---
Yeah, considering I already have every plan except 2.. yay for that BS.
---
Should of made dupers ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù until they got their stash under control.   That way we could all profit a little head hunting the exploiters
---
Or maybe one solo character isn't SUPPOSED to be able to do everything
---
Actually, Battlespire. ESO is not a BGS game.
---
Wow, this nerf was far worse than I thought it would ever be. Just logged in to see how my build/weapons were affected...my gauss rifle does over 1000 less damage than it did last night. Awesome! now I have to try and grind the levels to change my entire build. Feels great having to run from scorchbeasts again.   
---
Why does BGS keep trying to shoehorn us into PA wearing melee builds? Super frustrating. Might have to revisit FO4 for a little and wait a bit to see if they get 76 figured out eventually. 
---
&gt;You get the range you want and exceeded damage of melee safely.
---
you don't, though. not even a shotgun crit could break 50K damage- unlikely melee.
---
&gt;I'm just saying that attacking with melee required a lot of sacrifices
---
people vastly overestimate the "gap". you can close the gap with cavalier and be invincible. you can *teleport* through the gap with vats. players are closer than they appear to be thank to latency and the terribly servers, so the gap isn't even that big.
---
melee is broken. just as much as TSEs. it scales terribly well with strength and an unyielding sentinel essentially has infinite dodgy and can hit for those 50K.
---
they should have balanced all they guns in the game higher level guns should do higher damage compared too Melee I think the Base level 50 sniper should do a base of 200 its slow to cycle and reload but Bethesda answer is just nerf everthing  
---
I've definitely avoided their running attacks(mostly by complete fluke) before, but I know what you mean, usually it seems like no matter how well you dodge you will get hit anyway.
---
disagree up to a point, .38 is sufficient up to a point. that point is level 15. after that yeah, .38 is trash.
---
But like Fallout 4 it's mostly meant for newer players.  .308 is where the party is at :P
---
Agreed, but maybe they should have delayed launch and made a game that worked a little better at launch? 
---
I think the comment you replied to meant instead of upgrading cards you just put them on top of each other without consuming them, and they still take 1 slot for the combined total.
---
Some reports are that it is account wide.  I would consider waiting, some others have deleted other characters and still have the message.
---
Definitely 
---
Other than the plans this was the worse patch ever. 
---
lol are you for real?  The point is there shouldn't have been anything to fix which the game released. that fact you say "everything" shows how far from finished the game is STILL after 3 months on sale. I play this game regularly but it's a broken shambles with frequent crashes, disconnects and glaring issues which shouldn't be in a game on sale to the public.
---
Because the only people that the update screws are dupers and fuck dupers
---
Awww... can‚Äôt one shot cheese everything anymore? So sad...
---
The whole player base has been asking for game/bug fixes and the second Bethesda listen to its audience and tries to rectify their problems, everybody else jumps ship and immediately asks for content.
---
You're also a part of the problem, that's quite rude.
---
Lots of folks don't know how/are too lazy to farm for stuff, or how to work the perk system. 
---
I know a few who don't have much time to play, so they're reluctant to hold a workshop, or run a farm route because they just want to play.  
---
That's why I stick with a melee weapons
---
EASY
---
1.Less material to farm/repair melee weapon
---
2. NO AMMO's NEEDED save a few extra weight for something else.
---
I know its hard but reapec to melee before they nerf it. TSE is a history now
---
That was my first thought, so I started looking at my durability bar after each engagement, and then each shot.
---
I can visibly see the bar going down with each shot I take. With an automatic weapon.
---
Not bad for me, the loss of most of his junk items? Yeah, that's a lot for him. Especially when it included a lot of aid, etc. 
---
After the patch, they accidentally placed old bugs back in, along with this
---
They should totally make the raider vendor at the ski lodge toss out a "bite my shiney metal ...just kidding.... haaa haaa haa" line, but have it be so rare people wouldn't even believe you when you tried to tell them
---
I've already played a few hours, and not a single disconnect on PS4. Loading times were better and smoother, too.
---
No 
---
It made the game less grindy for me. In FO4, I could use a Plasma rifle and deal some great damage to enemies, now my TS Lever action doesn't even dent most foes. 
---
I'd feel bad about using a TSE if I didn't have to deal with the following:
---
1. Anyone using the All Rise, or several other one shot melee weapons. 
---
2. Scorch beasts that constantly shriek and drop my FPS with their attacks. 
---
3. Enemies who not only have incredible health and damage, but a literally never ending amount of ammunition to use against you. 
---
4. Melee enemies who constantly stagger me, or disappear into walls or are just literally invisible. 
---
5. Ghouls who are so hilariously strong that few things short of exploiting your environment keeps you alive.
---
I just didn't want to have to deal with the ridiculous amount of farming this is going to make me do, not to mention be completely helpless to the full melee builds this will bring back. 
---
It's still op.
---
LOL nope.. wrecked the game for cheats! Ha ha ha!
---
Do you have more accounts/characters?  Early indications are i may be weight account wide.
---
I would, but they‚Äôre just going to nerf that too eventually. 
---
Player health gets up to like 200-300 on average. That makes +45 about a 20% increase in health. That's massive. 
---
what level are u I can confirm because I have both a shotgun and Handmade rifle they are shit now
---
Didn‚Äôt want to make a separate topic for this but how is a casual player ever supposed to clear the agility course in 2 minits on ps4?
---
It takes 3 minits to do it flawless and i keep falling off because I‚Äôm not that pro at handling the avatar.
---
Is this where my quest stops or is there a secret that i missed?
---
Yes lol. The game was too easy with TSE weapons anyways. There has to be some degree of difficulty - running through and 1 shotting all of the high level mobs is not proper end game. What will be funny is how many SBQ events start to fail with less DPS being output then before. It's suppose to be a challenging event with high possibility of failing or else it is too easy.
---
Not to mention missile launcher being useless as fuck with no fix. Now it's even worse. 
---
Why should "regular" armor be as powerful as power armor? If you could get all the benefits of power armor, without using fusion cores, why would anyone bother? You also get plus perks like Assassin, Chameleon, Unyielding, ect, with regular armor. 
---
Power armor would be pointless if you get get the same DR and radiation resistance from plain armors that have all kinds of perks and don't require fusion cores.
---
Oh man. What platform did this happen on?
---
yea, junks 2 a penny in the wasteland isn't it. Hour on a collecting run and it's replenished :)
---
Until melee gets nerfed too...
---
Rad X suppresses mutations so it does temporarily remove them and starched genes is a luck perk not endurance. 
---
do you have a TSE yourself? because my rank 5 demo expert adds **less** damage than my rank 2 shotgunner.
---
Yesterday i was on for 12 hours... Great times. I knew the patch was coming so I went on a rampage. Stocked up on loot, farmed a couple legendaries, took over workshops and every event that pooped up. Im literally dreading playtime tonight as no one wants to play because Bethesda over did it with this patch. The missed tge bar by a fucking mile!!
---
I tried, but got really bored whacking things. 
---
I was really excited for Fallout 76, I believed and still do that a multiplayer/co-op game set in the Fallout universe would be awesome. The problem is execution and how they went about making this game. There are bugs from FALLOUT 4 in this game, that is just ridiculous they cared so little about development that bugs from a game released in 2015 were present. If that alone doesn't show you how much effort went into making this game I don't think anything would convince you.
---
Note: Just to note I don't hate Bethesda or this game either actually. Really I'm just disappointed. I know Bethesda can do better, this hole experience has felt like a cash grab. Like more money went to marketing this game then actually developing it.
---
A bloodied guy running at me with 10 % hp ? i just showe a mine under him and there goes a roasted bloodied guy.
---
Not really hard, 3 star weapon with useful effects can easily go for 3000 caps and you can just farm SBQ by just leeching it off from other players. And 6000 caps are like 6 days worth of playing, even less because its 1400+ caps a day (1400 from vendors alone + rewards from events).
---
It's not supposed to be Op, it's supposed to be strong. And it's still one of if not the best ranged legendary.
---
shhhh, let them have their hissy until the Inside the vault this week then they'll start reeee-ing about something else.
---
If it'd help even out PvP I'd be fine with a melee nerf. I don't want to be able to one-shot another player who's around the same dmg rst, lvl, damage buff, etc, when we should be on relatively equal footing.
---
Plus I got my Super Sledge and Grognak because they look cool. The bloodied effect they each have was just a cherry on top. 
---
no shit. this dumpster fire is actually *worse* than the youtubers make it out to be.
---
you really need to playing it regularly to feel just how bad Fo76 is at its core.
---
Unless you picked them up after reset yesterday they where likely last weeks code pieces. 
---
I never understood the appeal of insta-killing everything, all the time. 
---
Oh, my heart. I‚Äôm coming home, Elizabeth! It‚Äôs the big one!
---
Yeah I already fixed it by updating the mod and removing a different mod (uncapped trading) that I forgot I installed a month ago. Gonna delete the post to prevent any more confusion
---
Imagine spending 300+ hrs at the best legendary grinding locations/events and your single best haul was a 1\* Two Shot lever action rifle. Meanwhile in a Korean MMO (Black Desert Online) with "abhorrently" bad RNG rates for item drop rates... My 16 characters have Kzarka/Dandelion (10's of billions of in game "caps" worth of end game gear)
---
Look... I love the challenge of killing enemies. One shoting everything got boring after a while. Not to mention the rate of suicide that occured. As an honest player, im glad the nerfed it. They just over did it. As far as the improvements go... Glad we got some of what the community asked for. The theme here is one step forward and two steps back. More bugs now that are just hindering it. I have tolerated it, considering I have played practically every day since release. However, this patch is a fucking joke and just kills it for me. 
---
You insulted my ability to comprehend multiple times. I was being respectful. If you want to talk about cutting down the number of notifications, then I‚Äôm cool with that. Maybe a general notification that there are people readied and waiting for h/h, instead of a new message every single time someone joins. But instead you refuse to acknowledge that notifications for Pvp based server events deserve to be seen by everyone in a PVE/PVP game and shouldn‚Äôt be opt out. Even in game PvP isn‚Äôt opt out, although slap damage and server hopping are deterrents. Why should I compromise with you when you refuse to secede points to anyone else in the thread? If anyone is being stubborn it‚Äôs you. 
---
how can i join your base-wrecking crew? I  would love to team up and destroy other players' shit
---
If you have a full team, and someone shares level 2 magnetic personality, you can share level 3 rad sponge (assuming you already had 3 charisma to start). Then get someone to share ghoulish level 3, and whatever for the fourth person. Rads melt away, and continuous healing.
---
Hey get out of here you dirty centrist!
---
Does anyone know if gunpowder is actually relative to irl? Meaning would 1 pound of gunpowder realistically make however many 10 mm or 5.56 it makes in game?
---
Good lord, your username is incredible.
---
But yes, one of the big things about today's patch is that all plans that are available from a vendor are *always* available.
---
For anyone throwing shade at the OP, he's right. Duper are actually back at it like mad men before it's getting patched using old glitches that were patched before.
---
I'm talking about he nerf to explosive, not demo exp. Demo exp needs to be returned and assigned to only specific weapons. Not all weapons.
---
I'd put a rifleman build above a melee build even with the TSE nerf. for just simple reality's.
---
a Handmade rifle either semi auto, or full auto is going to be able to attack at any range, where as any melee build needs to get within melee range(obviously).
---
That and assuming ammo isn't being considered I'd say a proper handmade rifle build will out DPS a melee build even with a lot of the OP melee legendary effects.
---
Oh very interested
---
Lol I have a tse hunting rifle hardly does more damage than the regular one none of my other legendaries are tse but they are all ass now too lol in world where baseball bats are better than gunsüòÇ haha also thats not that big of an issue this game has a lot of potential but will never reach it with Bethesda at the helm
---
Yup. It's also sad that the optimal Heavy Guns build is tied to wearing a PA. But I see where that's coming from, I guess.
---
Tbh, fallout 4 was my first fallout game and I loved the heck out of it. I heard all this hype about NV from the fanboys and blew it off. 
---
Steam sale hit one day so I got the deluxe edition with all DLC‚Äôs for $6........
---
Holy crap it was a masterpiece. Dumped 500 hours during my spring semester at school. It was beautiful 
---
Aye aye sir
---
Last night lol
---
&gt;...makes me wonder if Bethesda even playtests
---
If you mean using actual players to beta test the proposed fixes and nerfs -- they're not, obviously. They're in a bubble. A very small bubble.
---
No... god no... not another Break-it Early Test Application... Bethesda! Why!?
---
wow, that long?
---
You knowingly bought a duped weapon that you knew was overpowered, specced around it, and now you're whining that you shouldn't be nerfed AND it's not your fault? Not only that but it ruined the game for you because you can't cheese and grief anymore?
---
Yikes buddy.
---
Can i have your TSE.....oh no wait keep it :P
---
Hey look an example right here. Lmao. 
---
Doesn't matter much past 50, does it? I remember having a TSE pump action that did 1600 or something ridiculous along those lines per shot with the right perk setup. Ended up selling that and every other TSE except for that dragon because it made the game too boring. Now you can experience the intended difficulty level!
---
Fuck this shit. Im done.
---
Adios
---
With the time it takes to swing that All rise without perks, you can shoot the rifle 5 times. Granted melee still needs a nerf, but that doesn't mean TSE didn't
---
Hmm
---
Oh boo hoo. They are most likely working on a buff for explosive weapons ATM. And ballistic fiber is not that hard to get
---
Bumping my charisma to 7 with grape mentats+beer and bought it at Watoga - think I got it down to 1600 caps.
---
New content would be a redeeming quality at this pount but, with that we're gonna get more bugs im sure. They got some serious proving to do... Patches arent cutting it.
---
so you're saying TS**E**s should be nerfed even further? all the while actually make a case *for* melee?
---
I can't quite put my finger on it but I smell BS.
---
No, you have to un-bulk manually.
---
With the new Demo nerfs you couldn't kill the ant with a nuke as you say.
---
Okay well at 250 i was happy with the game. Get to 650 hours and come back 
---
 Why should "regular" armor be as powerful as power armor? If you could get all the benefits of power armor, without using fusion cores, why would anyone bother? You also get plus perks like Assassin, Chameleon, Unyielding, ect, with regular armor.
---
Try using a terminal and connetc it to the switch
---
A perspective that I was not thinking about.  Sometimes I get a little silo'd in my thoughts and do not see the bigger picture.  Thxs!
---
The plan only allows you to craft up to level 45 so I don‚Äôt think there is any higher. I had one fully upgraded drop so I don‚Äôt really need it but I did craft a few and scrap them to see what else I could unlock.
---
Most people didn't. Most guns in this game are dead trash.
---
yesterday all i got was a 2* combat leg...was my first SBQ experience and that dropped loot was underwhelming
---
I have a rifle/sneak build and perks, and using a .38 receiver on the hunting rifle with sneak attacks of either x2.5 and x3.5 (nighttime) was pretty effective up to a point. 
---
They're throwing a band-aid at a perceived problem when the entire weapons damage system needs to be re-balanced.
---
My playstyle was to run through mobs with a vampires explosive combat rifle. White Knight let my gear stay alright doing that. Rip everything. 
---
There is literally nothing in this patch that makes me excited or even want to boot FO76. Thank god The Division 2 is coming out soon.
---
I just use it normally.  Fusion generator to door connection.  Keypad to open, then it auto shuts in 5 seconds.
---
My friends use the other version with pressure pads.  Stepping on the pressure pad opens the door, and I think it auto shuts?
---
I'd swap points from Endurance to Luck. You can e.g. swap in Cannibal when you need to instead of having it on perma.
---
you mean unnecessary grind if I see a scorched beast I just stop playing ithe XP is not worth the resources now they balanced the game for PVP but damn PVE   
---
Gladly will. Seeing as I only get a few hours a day to play it (I work two jobs and also sleep), it'll be summer by the time I get there. 
---
I was wondering where all the extra carry weight was coming from when I logged in briefly and I do have rad worms as an effect currently. 
---
But not everyone wants to hack and slash in a game like this. The point is the nerf was too heavy handed, and if it stays then the next nerfs will be too heavy handed as well. 
---
Yeah you got a bargain.
---
There was a post earlier about someone upset that it was hard to kill the mirelurk queen with his TSE that spawned near his CAMP.  
---
The mere fact that someone who owned a TSE felt comfortable building their CAMP nest to a mirelurk queen spawn alone tells you how messed up it was.
---
I know that. I assumed it would be a week from when they were picked up though.
---
No, march maybe.
---
Its Bethesda's fault for saying there's a patch coming, then talking about what might be coming down the road because the next patch is so empty and broken.
---
Without mentioning Survival the last ITV would have been about 5 lines long.
---
It's been unplayable since its release and is a historically bad game to the point where it's now a meme.
---
The game had potential but it's still broken months after release with absolutely no new content. 
---
Yeah, I was hoping they'd bring back craftable ammo variants. They have a system in place for them and everything: just let us equip them like we did arrows in skyrim and if we run out of the type we're using, it auto equips the base level ammo. We could place favorite ammos on quick select and whenever we switch types, have it play the reload animation and then let us keep wailing away. 
---
dont worry, the neckbeards who spent real money cant downvote the whole community 
---
Yeah that was the story of my life too, rarely saw them and I've had no reason to get the perk myself up until now. I was praying that they would do the container change to the stashes and I'm glad they did. It changes everything about caps and completely balances out the prices changes that were needing to be put in along with items always being in vendors.
---
thats not what he saying at all. unless youre just trying to twist his words 
---
It's rough out there in the waste. Here are some tips to keep yourself safe. 
---
-Don't build near roads, landmarks, or resource piles. These all increase your chance of attracting unwanted attention from raiders. 
---
-Sneak while in your camp. This will keep you hidden from players on the map. It's not difficult to surmise when someone is at their camp by looking at the map.
---
-Turrets are an alarm system, not a defense system.
---
-Step away from the build, or crafting, menu to check to make sure no unfriendly visitor are poking around. Often scouts will show up at your camp before the rest of the raiding party arrives. If you can spot them then you have time to decide on fight or flight.
---
-Make friends. Start networking with other friendly people in the game. Some raider gangs are looking to pick off individual marks. If you call some friends it might be enough to scare them off. Worst case scenario you have back up if it comes to blows.
---
-If you are really worried about losing your stuff then hop servers asap. No shame in running. Well, maybe a little.
---
-Sometimes an we'll placed orbital strike will still wreck your base. Fear not! Simply pick up your C.A.M.P and move it just a couple inches then place it back down. Now anything broken will be in your stored tab full repaired.
---
Part of this game is PVP. You can either be the nameless settler who's lifeless body is stumbled upon by the protagonist, or you can take your safety into your own hands. 
---
Why would we stop?
---
Theres been new nerfs to fun things like claiming workshops, perks, and guns.
---
Well as soon as I don't have to worry about being one shotted with a super sledge or some other similar melee weapon then I'll be perfectly fine with the Nerf. The white knight Nerf makes no sense. What's the point? Force players to farm for more mats to do repairs? That's literally all it's going to do.
---
agreed its all too appease a few PVP players I hate PVP its all about PVE and now even thats terrible  
---
make sure to advocate for nerfing melee and bloodied next or else you're just a salty little bitch.
---
I'm not making a case for melee. I'm saying that there are sacrifices that melee make to get those bonuses while most tse did jack shit for theirs besides have an explosives card. I said thqt TSE is fine where it is at cause TSE is the most broken and stupid combo I've seen. If anything, replace explosive with another trait that doesnt rely on demo exp.
---
Thank you for the replies. BGS needs to hotfix these ASAP.  Considering the flustercuck I'm still a fan.
---
Is the AP regeneration bug included in this? For example, AP regeneration is vastly slowed down or stops multiple times at certain increments before regenerating again without making actions that would cause a stop in AP regeneration such as standing still. Could be caused by the Scaly Skin or Grounded mutations as I only noticed this after acquiring them. Really makes fights and V.A.T.S. use extremely debilitating. 
---
They didn‚Äôt in Fallout 4. Not tested it but I imagine it‚Äôs the same here 
---
My STR is only 8. With no melee cards at all. Sure the rate of fire is quick, but with firing more roofs I have to worry about more ammo, quicker weapon degradation, and up close I still blow up to oblivion in one shot while in PA. 
---
Right now it‚Äôs taking 7-8 shots to kill a level 68 super mutant at West Tek, while it‚Äôs only taking two whacks with a level 40 All Rise. I‚Äôm in PA so being up close is a non-factor. 
---
My main point is, is that an all-out rifle build should not be out damaged by a melee weapon with nothing spec‚Äôd towards it. 
---
Amazing how you can whine about having to work for anyting. there's a lot of shit I really hate that they are doing, but this is just ridiculous. This is you being a whiny crybaby and everyone taking your side for whatever reason. 2000 caps for an extremely rare plan isn't even unreasonable if you were to spend a couple days playing you should easily have 3000 or 4000 caps. You literally grab everything possible and sell to vendor. At max level it just throws money at you. Then, when you get that rare plan, you never have to buy it again. So what the hell are you whining about?
---
Fallout 4 was good for what it was, it was a very fun game that I've sunk hundreds of hours into, but there's a very good reason New Vegas is held in high regards and Fallout 4 isn't.
---
If it wasn't for those two games being in the same franchise you couldn't even compare them.
---
The reset is every monday
---
What about the players who never have more than 2k caps? I cant tell you how many players I have traded with who have less than 2k in caps. Screw them right? 
---
You mean the confetti cannons? 
---
Do you even Chocobo?
---
I agree there was no balance to the balance update they just made a build that was already better god like now bloodied build is the only way to go now or at least till they Nerf that
---
Oh god gg that was funny.
---
what about the "if it's in the game, it's the player's responsibility to find and take advantage of these exploits"!
---
This is because everyone and there mom got used to everything being an easy 1-2 shots from TSE weapons. Those weapons should have been nerfed way earlier. You are suppose to use combinations of perks, equips, mutations, consumables, etc to get the best damage you can. You shouldn't be able to 1 shot everything without putting effort into your build and grinding for items/caps.
---
Well ain't that handy. Guess I should've done some googling. 
---
Well I'll reserve my judgement then, thanks!
---
I saw heavy combat legs at Harpers Ferry.
---
Wtf are you talking about?
---
When did the OP ever say that that person had a stock of jet packs? 
---
They didn‚Äôt. 
---
Did you ever stop to consider that the person selling service that service learned a jet pack plan for one model of PA instead of selling a stockpile of duped torsos? 
---
Way to assume way too much kid. Quit generating hysteria. 
---
The dupers made it not rare though you get that right?
---
Thank them and anyone that bought there TSE's, lets be honest they were so rare we all know there wouldn't be 10k off them for sale after a week.
---
With the right perks and mods on the weapon, it can be viable for a while on weaker enemies. I have an Instigating hardened pipe rifle that I use on ghouls and scorched because I have like 3000 .38 rounds. 
---
I agree the nerf was a bit much. Possibly buffing them up to where TS and E both do +50% and maybe putting the perk cards back where they were might help. 
---
I disagree, the point is not the time invested in the game. The point is they told you one thing so you invested the time and then they switched it on you without a refund.
---
My friends aren't quitting because of bugs, TSE, or QOL stuff.
---
My friends are quitting because they're BORED.
---
**No Player Vending. No New Quests. No New Events. No New Vaults. No PVP. No Stash Size Increase.** 
---
Last night was the first night my 10-15 player list was completely OFFLINE.  I can't make new friends faster than the lack of content is driving them away :(
---
Made statement is 100% valid. Really no idea what the plan is going to be regarding that. Flat NERFS to EVERYTHING is not a solution. I'm confused on what direction Bethesda is going with this game. I just want it to be good so my squad will continue to play. Really hope they can provide BUFFS to non-utilized things like Laser weapons and pipe weapons. 
---
Theres a distinct reason why I learned to make models/animations/plugins for FO:NV - Potential, when they eventually release the Creation Kit for 76 I'm willing to bet my PC that more PC players will be on the "Community Moded" server versions than official ones

---
I agree Bethesda are clueless however TSE nerf is a good thing.
---
Maybe after everyone's deleted there duped items, they will increase it by 25% so it was only a 50% nerf
---
Tweet I sent to fallout on Twitter.
---
https://twitter.com/TycenYT/status/1090364392561143812?s=19
---
Not completely... But, pretty fucking close to it. Im not looking forward to playing tonight and that's like the best part of the day besides hanging with my kids.
---
I dont disagree completely.   Again,  my post is mainly about the amount of people that wanted the nerf and spoke up.  And the ones that didn't and was silent.   
---
But I said it earlier on a reply.  They should buff everything up to be equal if that is what was absolutely necessary.  Not nerf.
---
Salty! 
---
Naw on PC. I stalked a bunch of vendors and ran a ton of workshops, never found them. I've seen others looking for them as well and commenting on how rare they were. :(
---
Definitely. Gearbox Software should've done it. Then the game would've had 14 years of development and only be slightly disappointing.
---
Or maybe Ubisoft. Who doesn't love collecting feathers. And of course their reputation with launching an online game is stellar. 
---
&gt;The problem is execution and how they went about making this game. There are bugs from FALLOUT 4 in this game
---
I'm tired of this shitty excuse, of course it does, IT USES THE SAME FUCKING ENGINE. Yes the bugs could be fixed, but I can already tell the ones you're talking about are far from game breaking. 
---
Also yes it is obvious this was rushed out the door fofor money. That doesnt excuse everyone whinging about things that dont matter.
---
We love this sub. Thank you all for being so damn passionate, constructive &amp; just awesome.
---
I'll speak to Maxson at the next meeting and have you all promoted to Paladin.
---
First scorched beast we killed, 10 people it took 2 minutes and 13 seconds, was 27:47 left on the event timer when we finished
---
And a waste of plastic too. 
---
Is this game going to end up being endlessly balanced like World of Warcraft?
---
A few minor things I'd like to bring up, sorry if they've been mentioned already.
---
Bobby pin weight seems to have reverted back to 0.1 (Not a big issue)
---
Can we please have some way of completing the Overseers Mission. I've got every holotape I can lay my hands on (including the B&amp;B one) and even got the challenge, but the quest will not disappear.
---
The wendigo and the clown suit saga. I've killed it wearing the costume AND hat, multiple times, and it just keeps coming back. If it's meant to be a daily quest, at least make it so and list it there, not under Misc.
---
Other than that, I have nothing else I feel I need to add that others haven't already. Thanks.
---
I saw that but thought they said except for camps-- glad I was wrong. xD
---
this point is not a very good one as the game is bland enough as it is and IDK if you have delved into PvP but if everyone was instantly hostile the lower levels would have no chance. But in the "Adventure" mode they can think and choose whether or not they want to engage in PvP. So having 0 option for that will truly kill this game. The only thing keeping me around is the PvP if i don't wanna fight i wont hit back if i do I will its very simple if they just ironed out the issues with it.
---
If you define anything requiring more than one shot or any action requiring more than 10 seconds a grind, then I guess so. I might be getting old but this idea of getting things without working for them in any capacity is new to me, although it seems to be very popular around here
---
Good suggestion. 
---
Please confirm for me if the queen is feasible currently. I have commented on 10+ posts and comments trying to get someone to confirm its plausible with recent changes....
---
I run 3 to 9 nukes a night... Team averages 4 to 6 people and we never encountered issues. I'm terrified that it is no longer feasible and I will not have any content to play :/ 
---
Tell them to get their version control in order. This isn‚Äôt the first time stuff like this has reverted, which I assume is from newer changes being done in an old build and then getting merged back in.
---
They have away had weight for me on PS4
---
&gt;people vastly overestimate the "gap". you can close the gap with cavalier and be invincible. you can teleport through the gap with vats. players are closer than they appear to be thanks to latency and the terrible servers, so the gap isn't even that big.
---
&gt;melee is broken. just as much as TSEs. it scales terribly well with strength and an unyielding sentinel essentially has infinite dodgy and can hit for those 50K.
---
this was my previous post explaining why you're wrong. melee can reap much more benefits from sentinel than ranged, even before the patch. and let's not forget melee is the only thing that can stagger 100% of the time.
---
You sound like an entitled little shit.
---
I've been trying to do that with friends.
---
Save SOMETHING to say "here let's go do this".  Oh there's another quest over here for the Brotherhood.
---
Unfortunately my friends are quitting the game faster than I can find new ones.
---
I guess the FO 4 fans were wrong............FO 76 is a single player game.  I get to do those quests alone :(
---
I knew there was a reason my stash box was at 605/600 when I logged on... One hard stomp on explosives and two steps back...
---
Theres already a free in game alternative that gives the bonus
---
The building is the one with the sign that says "Trading Post" and the Responder's symbol, with open arched entrances.
---
I have the same problem. I can only use materials that i carry on. Every junk (bulked and not bulked) in stash can't be used to craft/repair. Funny thing is that not bulked materials stored in stash count as usable but when i try to use them i'm getting notification that i don't have enough materials to craft/repair. Right now this game is unplayable for me.
---
It was a timed paint job that you could buy, maybe they come back later. 
---
I only have one tse that is a hunting rifle barely does more damage than the normal hunting rifle guns are just not really a viable build anymore
---
You already have that. It's called creating another character.
---
Yeah and I did a Google search 3 different ways and got the same results and that never came up or I would've have made this post. Truly sorry for being a newbie
---
So this means I can finally get my brick wall plans that I've spent several hours trying to find? Oh baby. 
---
Sorry man I know its been rough
---
That was already the case though right? Laser rifles are pretty bad for example. I was never one to grind for the most BA/OP weapon in the game but now there will just be another meta build to chase. From that perspective this change was the easiest and most cost effective way for Bethesda to give the meta chasers something to do. 
---
I'd be interested to know the results. I can *sort of* see an interpretation where the Mistress of Mysteries garb counts as 'a unique Unstoppable Outfit' and a group all wearing them gets a stacking buff. But it's quite a stretch.
---
Theres a free alternative in game already
---
I mean...one is the pinnacle of human armor technology, while the other is made from scrap metal and home-tanned hide. The only surprising thing about the situation is that BGS didn't somehow manage to reverse their utility and durability, like they did with the civil-war Gatling gun vs. the Gatling laser/plasma.
---
What did you spend it on? Ammo and resources are way too expensive to be worth it.
---
You're an idiot
---
The question is was the Blue Screen issue fixed on PlayStation. 
---
Does it not count the Mistress of Mysteries outfit? Not that it's a good alternative to this cash grab.
---
Somehow my carry weight is now 707?!  I logged out last night and it was 580, which btw is 100 over what it should be.  I seriously have no idea what is going on right now.
---
Confirmed, friend streaming on PC atm.   
---
Bobby Pins are .1 again.   
---
I've done the fight plenty of times before I even got a TSE weapon, and in some of them I was the primary damage dealer. I never speced my character for melee. It is without a doubt feasible, although it might require a tiny bit of thinking or strategy, god forbid
---
Only with melee builds bro hopefully you can get her to land
---
It says **unique**. Can you stack the buff in a party if everyone wears the freebie?
---
Yep, that's coming soon.  And while they're nerfing that, they'll find something else like White Knight that everyone LOVED to nerf as well
---
I'm just horribly disappointed in the patch today.  This sux.
---
That red one wasnt
---
What? You don't want to buy from that atom shop? Dude that thing is great!! Where else can you buy a pink princess bed after the bombs dropped and eat dog good to live?
---
Was it intentional that you guys left out the patch notes that you upped the cap price on most plans? Prepatch berry mentat plan was costing me 95 caps post patch it‚Äôs 875. Gauss riddle went from around 1100 caps to 3150 for me. 
---
There is? Where/How would I be able to find this. And is it the same for all these "Events" it seems they use that banner just to promote new Atom Shop Items
---
This is such a great thing! 
---
After this patch aside from the few changes Bethesda has made me personally I'm waiting to try out the survival mode and yes I'm glad that they nerfed the TSE so now it solves the issue especially I don't know if you know about 
---
3rd party online sales duplication  sites ebay common and others where TSE are HOT!!!! but not anymore.
---
Sales for any TSE are heading down in a spiral...
---
it was bound to happen sooner or later but... Im glad now.
---
Yes yes, *your* OP gun is totally legit, even though you didn't earn it at all, and the dupes have been in the game the entire time.
---
Nevermind that that gun is so infinitely rare that the price would be the maximum, 25,000 caps if it wasn't duped.
---
And this all assumes you aren't just a liar, which is the most likely answer.
---
Or go unarmed, unless my arms break too.  
---
Yes, the order of mystery character is in the pic too
---
was quoting rumors without fact checking myself, my bad.
---
in a quick survey i could not find any dupe bug that was (re-)introduced with todays patch.
---
(it would not surprise me if it were true still though)
---
Better nerf that.
---
If it needs it then fine :)
---
Hopefully by then the added in a proper respec option.
---
You do realise that the prob over nerfed on purpose right, They can easily increase it again by 25%, maybe they just waiting till most have deleted / sold the items as the majority were duped.
---
Ans the fucking price sliders looping around over and over. 
---
I personally hate using PA. Through all of the Fallout games I have played, I never once found myself enjoying feeling like I was in a submarine. 
---
Only in F76 have I used PA so that I could participate in a nuke zone
---
Amen 
---
The order of mystery dress from the quest in game counts as well
---
With full... whatever the shopping perk is named, I can't remember. But with that perk maxed, it was 1500. It seems they tripled or quadrupled the price of plans with this patch. I guess as an offset to them not being rare anymore.
---
laziness
---
Trades. I think I got 8 plans for 1.5k. I forget what all was in the bundle. Piano, Artillery, and War Drum. I remember those
---
So? Why are you being an ass? Everyone is entitled to their opinion and to make that known. Dont like it? Dont read it plain and sime. 
---
Tse isn‚Äôt the best for her anyway bruh but no if you weren‚Äôt using legendaries or melees I promise you weren‚Äôt the primary damage dealer
---
Wow. Considering this is Reddit, wow....
---
I mean, you tried.. but; man... Lotta cringe coming from your comment. 
---
I have relogged several times and it does not allow me to sell or buy from a vendor, just get an error both ways (item is not tradeable) or max limit reached.
---
\&gt;  **good luck standing around while someone kills the queen for you**   
---
Kills the queen how?
---
Yea, the armor will degrade 4 times slower now, and they also nerfed RadX stacking in the same patch, so hurp durp, regular armor just lost it's only way to be able to get into a nuke zone and it's only perk that made it have a serious advantage over power armor.
---
I get it, i started off playing with my friends. It honestly was the most fun i've had playing a game in a while. Taking workshops and defending it, fighting rogue scorchbeasts and just having fun. But they've all quit and it's just me alone. What sucks too is that people are so worried about weapons becoming too strong, for the most part this feels like a single player game.
---
I go to events and literally no one is there, maybe once in a while a newbie will pop up. The only time i really ever see others is at nukes. 
---
Xb1 bubagumpsgrimp1
---
I noticed that the tesla rifle is listed under heavy guns when crafting but is not effected by the bear arms perk to reduce weight nor is its damage increased with heavy gunner, expert and master. 
---
Sometimes people miss that a weapon is 2 star and will vendor it if the prefix is not one of the few desired ones. 
---
the stashes are always at the exact same spots, enable the audio perk from perception and remember their locations ;)
---
i didn't see any leaks or datamined images for either of the two
---
Same here
---
imagine quitting the game because the developer decided you were having too much fun.
---
The first one is due to PC mods. Some of them seem to be causing this issue, but others (like the perk loadout manager) are not. Also update any mods you currently are using
---
Didn't experience the second one, it might be related to the first issue or it could be something different entirely. 
---
No White Knight. All guns are potatoes now. They need a buff in general. Melee is in a fine state, and Power Armor is pretty much mandatory now.
---
Seems like they back tracked a patch. A lot of old things are back now.
---
Do you have any other characters with weight? Like a mule, because if so it counts toward the limit
---
So you‚Äôd rather have to server hop for a day and still not get what you want instead of just playing the game to earn caps?
---
For some, it's not "svq not dropping what I want", it's more like "sbq won't stop dropping the 2 same things". I would love to farm useful stuff from the tough end of game boss, but every single time after the first, I've gotten the ultracite pa left leg plan and the explosive vents plan. 10 times in a row. The third plan I've gotten is random, sometimes another ultracite pa plan or prime receiver. I don't mind a certain amount of RNG in farming, but 10 times in a row of the exact same 2 plans is not RNG, it's a waste of time, especially now that the ultracite plans are now free in ft. Defiance. I'd already been randomly gifting newbies the plans each time I've gotten them since the first, but unless they've updated the sbq's drop tables, 1 out of 3 plan drops will be 100% wasted and the other 2 have a high probability of it too
---
It does suck but that still a pretty good find. What dmg are you getting? Are you using a hardened reciver? 
---
This might be because of Plague Walker mutation?
---
agreed
---
They won‚Äôt anymore unless she lands and they two shot her with their 6000 damage deathclaw gauntlet üòÇ
---
when you compare that with the minimal amount of XP you get add time for resources yes its a grind its a cost analysis shotgun Shells and 556. are the hardest ammo too obtain in large quantities in a reasonable time ergo the expenditure of said ammo over a prolonged engagement because of damage nerfs for minimal XP gains is a grind     
---
It still does more damage though right? Hold on to it they may buff it again a little :)
---
As I said, melee has been at a good spot (mostly). End game melee is so over powered that it needs a rework. But climbing the ladder of levels, melee is probs the safest route to go. But end game Melee is usually so stupid just to how buffs work. Stacked buffs that aren't from cards are the next thing I hope Bethesda looks into. 
---
I have a similar build. When wandering around The Forest I use a .38 combat rifle and stop sneaking. FYI, you are extremely unlikely to get the .38 receiver for the Combat Rifle by scrapping, I got mine at Harper's Ferry.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs just that with the new nerfs, I can‚Äôt stand it. It‚Äôs just terrible, with all the weapons that I grinded out for hours just terrible. It is crazy that a 1* Anti-Armor Gatling Gun that I got from a random legendary mirelurk will kill something faster than my explosive pump shotgun. With the plans, everything is so fucking expensive. And you can only get 1400 caps/day? Fuck outta here. I just feel like it‚Äôs been too much.
---
No need to play the game anymore I see.
---
I've ran through Watoga multiple times hunting for max durability PA and legendaries, yet I haven't come close to getting a level per run. Not sure where your math is coming from. I'm level 171, been playing since the beta, and never abused bugs or glitches to level, just played the game normally.  
---
I'm not making excuses, I'm agreeing with the fact that Bethesda should give us a free respec after making any perk related changes that could affect player builds. I don't use an explosive build so it doesn't affect me much, but I feel for the players who do.
---
I have only 1 alt i used to level up to 15 so i could purchase the handmade plans, hes currently 192/600 stash and 145/170 on person with the pharma/junk perks at rank 1 and 2 respectively.
---
Shout out to the people that have melees that can do 10,000+ damage but think 600 damage TSEs needed to be nerfed to 150.
---
Not disagreeing with you. There some factors that favor guns over m√™l√©e. But there are more drawbacks to guns. The fire proof perk will help with proximity shots (if that's been updated not logged on for a little while)
---
Actually we were fighting the queen after the patch and we were able to kill her. But i don‚Äôt know what weapons the others used. Saw some TSE Shotguns, probably some melee too.
---
[Regression Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing); they need it. 
---
It's not like they haven't already profited
---
1. PS4
---
2. Wild_ix
---
3. n/a
---
4. a) bulk crafting materials no longer count towards construction of new objects
---
b) a two shot is no longer 2x damage?
---
c) ballistic weapons dont make sense with their corresponding calibers. how does the quality (hardened) of a .308 receiver beat the performance of a .50bmg round? a better receiver increasing the durability and performance of an item makes sense to me, the damage wrought by a .50 caliber round wouldn't be affected by the quality of the receiver. 
---
d)does the mistress of mystery garb +20% sneak stack with a 3* sneak card? if so, when paired with escape artist, how are lvl 28 super mutants detecting my character while using suppressed weapons at range?
---
maybe don't hoard shit? 
---
D-
---
I'd give them an F for no new content, but a few of the fixes were ok.
---
The rest was trash.  Small things nobody cares about.
---
&gt; Do you think it will work like minecraft modding, where both the server AND client have to be running the same mod?
---
My guess is they'd only support server mods, since from a technical level, that's much easier to implement. Most Minecraft mods are only server-side.
---
Do you have mutations? What kind of stats does your gear have? Do you use consumables? You can also use stealth to deliver quite a bit more damage
---
Completely agree with you. No one ever asked for this perk to be nerfed. It was 3 points used in your build for QoL reason, and it was greatly pleasant to have after having to suffer through constant armor degradation for the 40 first levels before it gets available.
---
If this is the way this game goes, with constant nerfs for the sole purpose to nerf everything, I'm definitely out.
---
I'm very disappointed.
---
Lol bloodied explosive and sentinel will still one shot you. Enjoy melee and bloodied while it lasts, theyll be nerfed next
---
Radaway weight is been reduced from 0.25 to 0.3   Now so that could be it 
---
Well, good news for me is the change is already done you're just complaining to the wind. I'm just saying if sympathy or a reversion is your endgame, that's just not gonna happen.
---
Like tearing off a band aid on a hairy arm.  
---
Had to be done sooner or later.  Might sting for a little bit but it will pass.
---
Collecting shit is like the only thing to do besides killing shit in these games, what made these idiots think a cap is a good idea lol. Rip fallout.
---
No one cares.
---
Where is the proof of this? A single post with no proof says that it's back, I haven't seen any evidence
---
Same. I'm not even finding the urge to hop on for my daily vendor run. I know that doing a vendor run has nothing to do with this; I'm just saying that it was so discouraging to see what has kept happening to my demo guy that I'm not sure I feel like playing more.
---
Have you done the Mayor for a Day quest? The weapon obtained from that is suppose to be good if you do the quest at 50. 
---
Even though it's been nerfed, White Knight will help keep armor repair cost down. Might also want to look into the luck perks that repair weapons/armor on hit. 
---
If you are on PS4 I can make you a higher level melee weapon that will at least boost your dps. 
---
I guess struggle is a poor choice in wording. It‚Äôs just annoying I guess. Idk it‚Äôs really not that big of a deal, I guess I was just a little pissy when I logged on this morning and saw the changes. But shit happens. Maybe they‚Äôll nerf melee next lol
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
---
You do know they sold Armor,junk and Melee weapons also? 
---
My math is coming from Watoga. I'm level 200+ (not even sure, tbh) on my second character on my second platform. I've probably spent more time in The Forest than Whitespring. Never abused bugs or glitches except that one time I accidentally duplicated a pitchfork and immediately emailed Bethesda about it.
---
Example circuit: Start at the NAR repair yard. The Distant Thunder event sometimes pops here. Normally there are 3 or 4 super mutants or gulpers. Just south sometimes the It's a Trap event pops. Continue north to the Civic Center. You'll encounter your first legendary here. Kill it and move on or clear the civic center. Might as well kill robots for steel and lead along the way - look out for legendary ones. Head over to AMS - it's a pain, but it's worth clearing. See if Monster Mash is at the High School (you'll hear the announcer say something about Halloween costumes if it's up usually). Make your way to the flooded rail yard. There's often a legendary here, too. To cap it all off you can head to Fort Defiance for Line in the Sand. Keep an eye out for Census Violence and AWOL Armaments. There are cranberries in the area that you can make a drink with that gives you 2% (I think?) xp gain that stacks with Well Rested.
---
That should take you about 30-45 minutes if you clear all of AMS and the Civic Center _or_ go do a few events. Welcome to level 173. You're 2/3 of the way to "respec" from a White Knight nerf.
---
I knly used white knight cause the top 3 tier made fixing armor so damn cheap. Cobine it with the 200% health and it didnt need fixing that much. I always keep a rank 1 white knight just so my armors and stuff last a bit longer, that and the other slots are already used uo by useful 2 ranks
---
I can't imagine how this game can possibly be fun for you if you think of everything only in terms of min maxing rewards with effort. You spend most of your time at the golf club, I assume? 
---
Not the last time I checked where to craft it at
---
Well any of your guns are going to be shit now and AAE is better for queen than tse bloodied melee is really the only viable option for the queen at this point
---
Yup the games broken, Bethesda defo need to fix it not denying that for 1 second!
---
Ive been swimming in ballistic weave since reaching the top rank of white knight. I‚Äôd rather use it than sell it. 
---
Duping is back
---
Lol shut is that something you‚Äôre modeling? Pretty neat. Yeah I really hope they do. Private servers also. I don‚Äôt like showing up to a site with my team only to find it is cleared.
---
can you make the stash size 1500 aswell? It feels weird that characters can store more then the stash....
---
and can you also allow us to buy additional stash space? PLEASE.
---
Im willing to pay for the better servers it takes to store more junk!
---
Oh.....that game.....yeah....
---
There are two connections, you cant see the one that goes to the keypad (its above the doorway).
---
Entering the code from the keypad will cause that switch on the back to turn on for a few seconds.
---
To exit from the other side, you need to wire up a switch to that switch on the back of the door.
---
Dont ask me to explain why its like that
---
They made their profit. They even saw this patch coming. There are still in game things to be sold. So I doubt they're  hurting at all.
---
Imagine being one of those morons who paid real money for a TSE.  Fucking morons.
---
I just got my 76 hour achievement @ LV28. 
---
Except before you could server hop and find stashes in the same spot repeatedly, but now they stay looted for 20-24 hours like other containers do.
---
I never really took advantage of this, but, this was not a change to get more caps in player's pockets.
---
&gt;They won‚Äôt
---
No. We won't. Each player in the blast zone increases her max HP. There used to be those who could negate this buff with their damage.
---
Oh, from last patch. I was looking for something I missed form this one. 
---
That is still a net loss though, right? They reduced repair costs by up to 20%, but then nerfed White Knight by 40% for top tier. So, less of a nerf, but still a nerf overall. (and that's assuming you are getting both the 20% and have WK maxed)
---
Of course I understand how loot tables work. I'm not the only one getting the same 2 drops. If the exact same 2 items from a list of probably between 35 and 50 drop 10 times in a row, what do you think are the odds? Now multiply that by multiple folks all reporting the same thing. 10% drop chance for one item out of that many items is a larger percentage than the rest, I get that, but not a large enough percentage to drop the exact same 2 items that many times in a row. That's a fault in their RNG equation. And if Bethesda didn't update the loot table to at least drop the pa plans, not the mod plans, out, then you'll be fighting a queen for items and getting plans for pa pieces that you are guaranteed to know thanks to them being available in ft defiance. In the very least, they need to remove the pa plans (again, parts, not mods) from the loot tables and tweak their RNG equation.
---
Yeah I know. I am tired of the material grind already and they made it worse. I‚Äôm about to log in for the first time since the patch and see just how much it‚Äôll cost me just to play the freaking game.
---
Melee is by far the best 
---
I kind of like it. Puts a more ‚Äústored‚Äù feel on what‚Äôs bulked
---
Wow that‚Äôs sick
---
‚ô´ ùëµùíêùíïùíâùíäùíèùíà ùíïùíê ùíåùíäùíçùíç ùíêùíì ùíÖùíäùíÜ ùíáùíêùíì... ùëµùíê ùíìùíÜùíçùíäùíàùíäùíêùíè, ùíïùíêùíê. ‚ô´
---
This brings up another point.  They should include a DPS indicator along with base damage for weapons.
---
yeah but TSE weapons are like the thing but now they are not.
---
lol youre a fucking idiot. back in the day and i say back in the day but it was only a few months ago. but when the game came out everyone was doing whitesprings run for ccaps to buy any two shot or two shot explosive 
---
and if youre paying 25k NOW for a weapon you might have an IQ around room temperature 
---
So true , when will they add some buffs and stop nerfing.  I might even take a break until some new content comes out. 
---
I bought each outfit with the atom I earned through playing the game,#free alternative
---
Were you in favor of Nerfs to explosive weapons? Two shot weapons?
---
Being someone who had a non OP weapon nerfed I can feel your pain. With that said anyone who was on the Nerf train last week who is upset is reaping what they have sown.
---
I see a lot of people complaining but no one is giving any real evidence that would warrant these kinds of responses I think ya'll are just a bunch of cry babies.
---
Idk.. Currently there are two main reasons to use regular armor over power armor:
---
Not feeling like a walking tank and the legendary effects.
---
If legendary effects get added to PA too then the only in game advantage reason to use regular armor goes away.
---
 Not really.  You can get 1400 caps a day selling to vendors only if you didn‚Äôt want to actually do events or find stashes or other cap methods.
---
Most items can be bought in a day or two.  PA mods which are the most expensive in a week or so.  And all of this is a few minutes of porting around to clear vendor inventories.
---
Compare that to the literal hours and hours and weeks and weeks of time invested by people just to SEE (let alone buy) something like a Jetpack or even a Handmade Rifle.  All the load times; all the server jumping; all the RNG is gone.  Now you can set reliable short and long term goals.
---
Being able to plan and set goals is always better than complete RNG and arbitrary level windows.  Nothing post-rational about it.
---
Im not the hero the wasteland wants. Im the hero it deserves. Lol jk. No, thats why I repair the people who were picked ons base for them with my supplies. And also Im doing it to people who enjoy that sort of thing. Not just some guy trying to repair his armor in his base. 
---
Curiosity, has anyone seen the railway rifle, cryolater, harpoon gun, etc plans that were also level locked? 
---
‚ÄúSome stuff‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even get this game to being what it should‚Äôve been at release; complete.
---
Why demand more buggy content just to have people bitch and moan about half a day after the new content release?
---
Let me guess, you were an advocate for maintenance and game fixes a month ago but once you heard it‚Äôs going to cripple your one shot build, you‚Äôve suddenly jumped ship and are now demanding for content.
---
Weird, those lights only cost me a week or so of playing the game
---
400 hours and over 50 whitesprings nukes and not 1 TSE, that's why seeing 10k of them for sale on ebay and fo76 bazaar seems strange...almost like they were all duped :(
---
So the next powerful weapon type is, "the thing"
---
Full unyielding set with proper mutations and right weapons makes hitting for thousands pretty easy. It's not even risk vs reward when you take the right perk cards and AP dodge/Serendipity/Blocker all the attacks.
---
With the hardened receiver its base damage pre-nerf was 161 - my sneak perks could get it up to 350.
---
Haven't logged in yet post-patch.
---
Irony
---
I try to max out the damage resistance so I need as much agility free for that as possible lol My AG is 14 and I get around 300 something damage resistance with my armor. Maybe Moving Target is not necessary but it's nice. What's your AG?
---
NOOOOOO's Vader meme. Thank you for the update :3
---
You do know Melee build have been the secret op build since beta and was during TSE era..just TSE was easier for the casual player.
---
Melee has always been OP.
---
Dying is also fixing it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
By farming mobs? It seems questing is just a waist of time which is unfortunate. Completing the story line should be worth the time spent. 
---
I'll take a look at it, thanks for the heads up!
---
Yeah, I feel your pain.
---
It sucks, because 95% of the time when I quit a multiplayer game, I don't come back.  My friends move on to things that are more fun and I follow.  Or I find something more fun and they follow.
---
This will be the first Fallout disappointment for me too.  Normally excited, working, grinding, working, questing, getting everything 100%, done, whew, happy...........then waiting for a new Fallout.
---
Now I just get to watch a game I've wanted FOREVER die like H1Z1 Just Survive because the devs focused 100% of their time on bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL adjustments...........completely ignoring CONTENT :(
---
Yeah I could melt her with my tse handmade despite all the low level Christmas nope peaches that showed up now that gun is almost useless it will break before I can kill her so hopefully bloodied melee will show up and two shot her
---
Less bitching 
---
Honestly, I see funding being pulled from this project with this latest patch fuck-up. No way is this game profitable anymore. No way will it ever be profitable in the future with all the negative press it's received and laughable atomic shop prices. We'll probably get a last hurrah patch that *might* un-fuck some things, and then all attention will be put on starfield. Even then, the bad 76 PR has probably fucked the Starfeild team over, and several titles to come.
---
The game was a good concept, and could have worked had BGS not been so complacent, or maybe gone with their main dev team over BGS Austin. (And i'm really, really disheartened to say that as a former Austinite.)
---
600 damage tse was fully perked. Melee fully perked does considerably more than 150 
---
They explained it in the developer notes. You can disagree but don‚Äôt act like it makes no sense. It balances the perk to fit with others.
---
Yep. I've been hunting those serum recipes at the vendor and haven't had one show until this patch.

4. After todays update, every time I hit play on the Bethesda launcher, my game opens for a fraction of a second and instantly crashes back to the desktop.  I have attempted to reboot, reinstall, and I did a thorough scan of my system to check for any malware that may be causing the issue (I repair computers for a living, I know my system is not at fault).
---
5. Haven't created a ticket.
---
So having ranged ruined, picking up legendaries at queen and WS, farming for hours on end, those that have put in 600-800+ hours is dupers problems huh? No it‚Äôs not and you are full of it. Another coat hanger failed abortion folks. Hey at least you tried.
---
You're right, but relying on this bush league mechanic will only serve to nudge people closer to the door.  Poor decision.
---
Your other left... Watoga is South East (right).
---
Can u explain why u nerfed the explosive legendary so heavily 
---
No. Earn it.
---
He had 900 acid, etc. Stuff that's harder to come by than your average wood or steel, that he's been collecting.
---
He's got a right to be upset about it. 
---
It's a 10% nerf if you consider reduced cost + max WK perk. Hardly something to cry about. It's a survival game, there should be some effort in surviving.  
---
LOL 
---
well I do have a job with the Sheriff the department i have Netflix shows I have too watch normal shows and other games its all about maximizing content output for the least amount of time investment I watch all my videos on youtube speed up 
---
Sounds like an ‚Äúover correction‚Äù then....
---
Are you 12 yrs old or 13?
---
haha yes so IF a mistake was made, cause there is no proof in this post, then they made one, but you can fix it?please direct me to some of the modding work you have done to previous game to show how you are so superior to others!
---
I‚Äôm glad your character got messed up for trying to work around the mechanics of the game. Serves you right.
---
Instigating is my favorite prefix by far. If you get a weapon with enough base damage (i.e. Shotgun, Axe, or sledge) and the right perks to buff it out if can be a one hitter quitter for most enemies. 
---
Thanks bro. I want to start a thing across all platforms somehow where we do this. Im hoping a few people reply to this post in need of assistance. 
---
With TSE Nerf I wonder what fotm will be
---
how do you know it was duped? dupe exploit came a while after when beth added some weird system that disconnected you when you had too many actions. i assume it was their way of making the game more optimized 
---
It's clear that Beth can see problems emerging, but can't write figure out the real issue at the heart of things, or at least aren't dedicated to fixing them straight off. People use pipe weapons so much because they're cheap, plentiful and easy to make yourself, and they retain good damage throughout the game. There just isn't enough reason to ditch them for other weapons when those other weapons will break fast and be hard to repair. 
---
And it's the same with White Knight. It's a must have because armor breaks and is a pain to repair. I've never been a PA person myself, I prefer running about in basic armor in these games, so I hope to see it become more viable as time goes on. 
---
So this is my chance to finally get my 10th feral ghoul golfer and finish that damned mission then? Guess I know what I'm doing after work as soon as I get home.....
---
I feel you.  I am you.
---
I ran out of stash space IRL, I don't need this shit in a video game! 
---
„ÉΩ‡ºº ‡≤†Áõä‡≤† ‡ºΩÔæâ

Mine is 13 but revolves around AP and sprinting and sneaking around. World is so big that you need as much ap and sprinting bonuses as possible.
---
I mean you did build your entire character around a currently overpowered build in a new mmo; what do you think would happen. This happens in every single mmo, someone makes a character op as hell and then when they get nerfed like they should they get angry. Balance is gonna happen, it's a part of multiplayer games; build your character around having fun over having the most powerful build.
---
Cost 1200~ caps before the patch though
---
I foresee 436 downvotes in your future, but you can have one upvote from me.
---
I've been playing the game a lot and sure the nerfs and bugs suck but the game is still fun, the only people not enjoying it are the 150+ levels that have already smashed all the content out.
---
Pretty sure everyone thought this was going to be Fallout Battle Royale before it was announced... Be grateful for what you have. I for one love the PvP, and as a lvl 100+ on two characters, Survival is all I'm really hyped for until they announce better end game content. 
---
The most recent Patch Notes post I think it was ladydevann who acknowledge that the dev team is aware of the energy weapon deficiency and it's slated in a future patch. You can go through the bookmarked links and find it pretty quick but I don't have it on hand.
---
Bye! üëãüëΩ
---
O they are now well I would say with the duping being patched after patchedd... it's getting to be somewhat difficult for them I assume since that's how they made they're profit. 
---
LOL, I'm sitting on a stack of almost 200.  I find a lot just checking containers for military grade duct tape or picking up the military pouches when I'm clipboard harvesting.
---
Yep another bug they added 
---
he's using a full set of legendary sentinel armor so he takes very little damage while standing still, maybe try to research a little before accusing someone of cheating.
---
üò¢
---
It's not hard, but for anthem specifically it might be a bit too late for that. At least the launch issues FO76 had that completely prevented people from playing the game only affected a relatively small portion of the player base
---
PS4 Ground Zero trophy
---
I‚Äôve gotten myself killed numerous times for nothing
---
It didn't work that way for me.  For me it's not bugged when they're in my inventory.  The weight is only bugged in our stash.
---
how stupid are you really?
---
Yeah, I can't farm friends faster than they leave.
---
Pretty soon my best friend is going to get sick of me playing this and ask me to try another game.
---
I don't want to try another game.  I love Fallout.  I want him to love Fallout.  But I totally get that he's bored and ready to move on.
---
That's right. I just remembered the name and that it was in a lower corner. I didn't remember which lol ü§£
---
They can push a build when ever they want to PC. However consoles have to go through a submission process by both Microsoft and Sony. 
---
I‚Äôm actually some what surprised this game passes tethering technical requirements how often it blue screens on my PS4. 
---
You assuming his weapon was duped simply because others have been doing it is pretty toxic and not to mention stupid.
---
You remind me of one of those people who see someone that is in good shape and automatically assume they must have used steroids or something. Because you couldn't possibly fathom the thought of yourself working hard to achieve it, so they must have cheated?
---
Nice, I know what I‚Äôm doing this weekend!
---
Basically what you need to understand is that guns are basically shit now I‚Äôm not going to explain how every legendary effect works yes there are some more useful than tse now which doesn‚Äôt bother me but explosive perk is what made guns a viable option now melee dwarfs any gun build by far
---
Yes. Im lvl 62,got it in Harper's Ferry for 1561 caps.
---
There are also a bunch of great people out there. Don't let the few that whine the loudest be the only thing you hear
---
Happy Gaming!
---
This should have been their priority BEFORE November's release... holy hell do they not know what they are doing...
---
Explosives have been nerfed from the beginning, so that's not really accurate (excluding legendary explosive effects) 
---
and you sound like an overreacting douchecanoe 
---
Yeah!!! 
---
Plus it adds value to Hard Bargain 3 and CHA as a stat.
---
You got the game for free?
---
Lol I agree. I will totally be joining the raider faction. And its my right as a raider to raid other raiders instead of people who dont even want to pvp. 
---
Andromeda was shit on because of its terrible graphics the most. It sold poorly, and no one talked about it because they didn‚Äôt really care. People like fallout they hyped it up and all that was a lie. They had a beta 2 weeks before release and the first bug was the beta literally deleted itself. Ark was in beta for years almost 4 so people knew what they were getting into when buying it. I bought ark at 30 dollars and it‚Äôs a sandbox survival that needs no story because it‚Äôs main draw is taming and fighting dinosaurs. Oh wow my games so great it got rid of the bug that made my whole screen turn black their the best company it‚Äôs definitely worth 60 bucks now. I don‚Äôt expect perfection but I do expect close to it in a finished game like no game breaking bugs a finished game, no day one server crashes(even tho it happens 24/7) and a developer that speaks to the community. Also the free dlc thing isn‚Äôt a gift if it‚Äôs 1 map online you can‚Äôt gate off a dlc area for those that didn‚Äôt pay especially if they have this many bugs in the game.
---
Yeah, I figured it was something like that. Just wanted them to know that their fix broke something.
---
This didn't just effect TSE though. It effected ALL builds involving explosives. Also other MMOs have a way to completely Respec and/or give you a Respec when traits change.
---
wtf pump action do you have that's doing 1000+ damage without perks?
---
The flowers in the daily worked, but not in the weekly, which is weird. 
---
Do we all get the same daily challenges?
---
Same story here. Level 188, explored everywhere, tons of events, bazillion whitespring and sbq runs and not one 2SE.  Hoped to get a 2SE before the nerf just to experience the god like power but refused to buy one with real monies.  
---
But I am glad that all those level 50 players with TSE are not gonna be destroying everything around you with no regard anymore... hopefully
---
He‚Äôs not cheating at all. He‚Äôs wearing sentinel assassin armor. When you stand still you receive 15 less damage. And -8 damage from players. With a full set (which I have as well) it grants 115% less damage taken. You can also have a teammate with empath (which I have too) and receive 30% less. As well as the dodgy perk which is another 30% damage reduction at the cost of AP. As you can see that‚Äôs a total of 175 less damage. I tested that against a Two shot explosive double barrel and I was able to take 19 shots without dying. So no, he is not cheating. He just has his character built for PVP.
---
I've found that bulked items don't count anymore, so if your items are bulked scrap them to base components and it'll work then? Not sure if that's the problem but just an idea
---
I just got one yesterday. At least I knew the nerf was coming, so I spent the day enjoying it. I am actually happy it got nerfed though. I was pretty much unstoppable with that thing. I do think the nerf is a tad too harsh though.
---
It was definitely more exciting reading the patch notes than actually getting into the game and experiencing it all. But if there's a bright side, the community moderators are frantically going through here getting info from people and trying to figure out what's going on. I would be fine with another downtime as long as it hotfixed the issues
---
I just got them from watoga thanks. Been so long, I've forgotten why I need them now, I use tents üòä
---
Upvote, you have.
---
I‚Äôm afraid there is no multiplayer game that isn‚Äôt like this. Their purpose is to keep you there while the purpose of a single player game is to provide an experience so enjoyable that everyone will want to buy it. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so afraid of this whole movement toward multiplayer.
---
Yes, thats what ive been saying since the 2nd patch. Fuck the atom store... I dont care. Gimmie what you promised us. Free new content!! 400+ hours in and im fucking bored. Now that my friends dont wanna play... Even worse now.
---
.03* watch out, someone might read .3 then make a Bethesda ruined my life thread.
---
The lights cost 500 atom points which take 5 days of completing every single daily quest. Which is fine, if you have the time for that. 
---
Grinding an entire week just for some string lights doesn't make sense to me. And there is a whole atom shop full of cool but over priced things. The string lights are just an example.
---
I mostly feel bad for parents who's kids guilt trip them into spending money on this game. Since I feel like that's why micro-transactions like this are a thing. 
---
A TSE weapon is still doing +45% damage of a baseline weapon of the same type. 
---
Think about it... IMO they didn't nerf it enough.
---
If you paid attention farming super mutants is easy money. Average they'll net 3 or 4 caps a piece.  Running from location to location doesn't take longer than 30 minutes. Plus you'll make money along the way if you know where to stop.
---
Honestly, I don't even know what I'll do in game anymore if I go pure melee. Farming lead, steel and acid to feed the hungry TSE beast was half my game play.
---
&gt;you're saying it's crazy a high caliber weapon will kill something faster than a buckshot weapon?
---
Also, a rocket-powered sledgehammer is a very reasonable high-damage weapon. 
---
Same and i like that costume but stats are more important especially with the shit stash size, you need as much carrying capacity as possible
---
Okay cool thought it was just me. God man I like fallout 76 a lot, but why did Bethesda have to follow this whole release broken and fix later formula that every single fucking game seems to be following. I‚Äôd much rather it get pushed back and actually work. 
---
I couldn't care less about TSE weapons, and certainly didn't ask for any nerf. They were powerful, and so what ? They were acquired at end game, and you should be powerful at end game, or there is no sense of progression. Any FO game made you exponentially powerful as you leveled.
---
You can bet the only reason they were nerfed is for the upcoming pvp, and it will be an unending nerf shitfest from now on, for the same reason.
---
This said, having QoL perks nerfed out of the blue, is something entirely different. Even their reasoning is completely fubar: they nerfed it because anyone used it ? no shit, sherlock, sure everyone use it because the armor degradation is a stupid boring mechanism. And the perk will still be mandatory with this nerf, we will just have to suffer more.
---
Bulked Items no longer auto-scrap that is likely it.
---
Shelf the game and pronounce it dead. Its the only real way to fix it. But at this point it may just fatally kill fo76 its doing so bad. None the less im personally am shelving it in favor kh3...it only took 14 to 15 years wait
---
So rad worms are finaly useful?
---
Best buff of the patch! (Sadly the only one.)
---
But the items the perk effects aren't the same or balanced.
---
It would only make sense... now my gatling gun and minigun are pretty much useless again.
---
It never left, it was just not as prominent 
---
How so? Bulking means you've now got however much bulked, plus what's still left as scrap after bulking. You've just doubled the amount of crap you have to sort through
---
Hey what up keyboard tough guy. Having fun making yourself feel big by putting others down? 
---
The previous ways of duping work again
---
I recently played through a quest that sent me to the DMV and the process was so real I wanted to throw my PC through a wall. 
---
Let‚Äôs hope they fix the bug where luck‚Äôs worse the more points you put into it next
---
Practically free
---
one\_hand\_chop matey!
---
sorry for the delay, been a bit hectic in the Mire. 
---
I agree, the patches aren't cutting it.
---
I can deal with bugs.  My friends can deal with bugs.  Huge ones like crash to desktop, sure go smash those ones asap.  Occasional annoyances like "failed to trade" when trading with people, I don't care.
---
What I need for Bethesda to do is Patch some more Content in there so my Friends List doesn't empty out bug.....lol  I can't work past that bug.  There's no fix for it.  They leave, and they don't come back :(
---
Well, I finished playing for the day and checked both trending and new to see if anybody else had experienced the infamous damage bug coming back, but so far all I saw was nonstop complaining about TSE so I replied to a couple of them. Now every time I finish writing I have 6 more TSE related things in my inbox, so I do believe I locked myself into a rather vicious cycle
---
I restarted my console the last time that kept happening and it cleared up.
---
I noticed that too, apparently my hundreds of pounds of bulk junk is just wasted space
---
Update or remove your mods
---
I get that, but considering how much of a sacrifice non-PA builds were as it is, I expected some type of buff, not something that puts it further behind. 
---
I really want a viable non-PA build, but that's a hard choice to make when running PA allows for so much more flexibility. 
---
They are screwing the game up by listening to the cries of the PvP players.
---
Nothing should have been nerfed but the community should have stood up against the Nerf of 2 legendary effects that were not over powered individually. 
---
That age old line about....... not saying anything when they came to take.........rings true here 
---
10/10 why we reposting this same thing over and over?
---
What it really means is that everyone‚Äôs gonna dump their caps on PA plans, to under their cap limit and everyone on the trading subreddits will start taking caps again. 
---
I carry around a TSE .50 Cal so I can not feel useless while everyone else shoots her to make her land. Melee build is still useable once she hits the ground. I can visibly see the damage I'm doing, however small. We can also run around and one-hit all the things attacking you while you shoot her.
---
LSS, we melees ain't useless in Scorched Earth. :)
---
&gt; Each player in the blast zone increases her max HP.
---
this is well known to be pure fiction.
---
Using any mods? 
---
I just feel like the game is already stacked agains non power armour users so it's lile a kick in the teeth for my efforts to stay alive and play without having to fix it so often. From my experience power armour breaks so slowly in comparison which is fair i guess it makes sense but the white knight was such a nice perk almost doubling the time i had before I had to fix it. 
---
Lol, I'm in an abusive relationship with an FO76.
---
&gt;with purchasable stash space
---
Game becomes P2Win, Good job. Seriously if this is what you suggest to the game, please throw your PC/Laptop in your nearest water lake/river/younameit.
---
Without a shared stash a solo player is supposed to be able to do everything.
---
Dumb question though, where do you get caps? There are two kinds of players: those who struggle with the 25,000 cap limit, and those who constantly have ~ 1k on them. I sell all the time, but it barely covers the fast travel costs, and that‚Äôs with the travel discount perk.
---
Possibly bolstering/assassin effect on armor ... and nerd rage....   still, I can see how that's annoying.
---
I'm going to hazard a wild guess and say this is due to the mods not being scrapped now and the Bulk items are being funneled under the same item list as weapon mods
---
Bethesda has always been incompetent ever since Morrowind. The technical state of Fallout 76 was the last straw for most people. 
---
How old does your I quit post make you seem hey?
---
How do the devs still have jobs? Seriously
---
I second. Source: me, trying to become a massive junkie to test if a Junkie stack is more powerful than a bloodied rad stack. 
---
Serious question. How do y'all still support this game?
---
Do us a favour and don't bother with the "Then come back" part. Toodles.
---
No worries dude been adjusted anyway. Coming on now catch you shortly :)
---
So true,  they'll run this game into the ground... again .
---
Vats misses 95% of shots to begin with in my experience, it's like playing XCom with how bad the targeting is in it
---
Don't have much issue with my LAR on landing both rounds when ads and using a muzzle brake
---
+60 HP is almost a third of most people's HP.
---
Playing a stealth build and rarely ever taking a hit, alongside the additional durability perks, means I've only repaired my armor once in a week. Maybe longer. It definetely used to be an issue, but nowadays my BF stash is about the same size.
---
Switching servers occasionally fixes it. Unless it's the bulk scrap not being auto scrapped that you're running into.
---
It cannot be compared with being notified that someone is starting a PvE quest. Just like we aren‚Äôt notified that two people are engaging in mutual consent in-world PvP. In your own words, you are being ‚Äúgd hyperbolic‚Äù. It‚Äôs a PvP EVENT that anyone from the server can join, (not a personal quest) that is currently not utilized, not because no ones likes it but because NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT IT. 
---
Based on the price of the atom shop currently it would be expensive
---
You really don't think there are further adjustments coming?
---
It would be nice if teams were larger than only 4. An 8 man team would be loads better.
---
The freeze after travelling is back. No more double loading screen.
---
They nerfed it way too much
---
Noob question, how can I check how many hours I've played?
---
No i agree with him on that. The grinding is what is killing this game. Only because you rarely get anything good out of it.
---
I got this bug too. My purple headlights on my T51b are now flagged as an atom shop item. My T45 and X01 bright headlight mods are not, though. I really hope this is just a bug and they don't plan on retroactively turning colored headlamps into atom shop items
---
This thread is both clever and original. 
---
Lol damage üòÇthough just run all unyielding with one piece of chameleon 
---
There's a clean white space helmet that I found once in one of the large ski resort type cabin places I can't remember the exact one though sorry... It's a building with a ski lift, has a basement or first floor with a huge bunch of lockers, workbenches and a terminal locked door behind a long reception desk, and smaller base station buildings down the mountain below. I found the helmet near the weapons workstation in the big locker room area. Gives awesome daft punk vibes when combined with certain outfits. 
---
Gotta do that challenge log
---
Futile, f****d up,  F- 
---
\&gt; Stealth generally also benefits from low armor weight
---
But in what measure? I mean, if the benefit is very small then obviously it's not worth it. Some people do, so -- is the calculation known?
---
Thanks for the upgraded wood tip, definitely will dive into crafting and trying it out.
---
This sums up all the bullshit complaints about this game. 
---
Sucks man, sorry. Sounds like ticket time 
---
If I play *every day,* don't spend caps on anything but plans, and maximize my potential cap earnings per day (even slightly beyond a full vendor trip) I'll have all the plans that I want in... A little under a year!
---
And that's not even including my camp!
---
I've played MMOs since the 90s, I know about "earning it." This is a little much for some relatively basic aspects of the game.
---
For sure, I would,but unless some billionaire hardcore gamer buys Bethesda that won't happen vampires don't care how much fun your having while they suck the life out of you
---
Have had it for 3 days. No issues with spoiled meat until today. Got parasites after eating 8 or so. Maybe my rolls have just been lucky until now?
---
I run assassin sentinel and tse wasnt too hard to fight off. Anti armor weapons on the other hand even the fight. 
---
Yes, at watoga city vendor. She has almost all mods for T45, T51-b, &amp; T60 armor. Seen it 2day.
---
I would also love full glass panels but my top want goes to the garden plots from fo4. I want crops on my roof, 'thesda pls! 
---
This is true. I have pumped the breaks on two more trophies. I literally slowed myself down on quests so I could milk the gameplay time. I grinded for hours and hours for legendaries. I farm ike crazy to maintain my weapons and armor. Not to mention the hours into perfecting my camp. I always try to fight thru the boredom and its harder when you dont have orhers to play with. Role Playing and helping other players gives more endgame. I love the game... I have defended it on all levels and yet the sheer level of disappointment has destroyed my faith in the game. New content, not just atom store stuff, should be a requirement at this point. Patches arent cutting it anymore.
---
Why were they made super rare in the first place? Don't understand it.
---
Really. How many people got those? I'm curious.
---
Also curious what the player count is now.
---
We may look like we are cheating, we are just better at the game and synergizing the various systems.  Don‚Äôt hate us because you have not learned my young Palawan.
---
I dont know in whatever context it matters how much time I have spend into a single MMOPRG, but I have played Guild wars 1 since 2007 and still play every now and then to this day,  Guild Wars 2 since release date and WoW from 2011-2018 on and off and thats just game I played for +4 years. 
---
I tried too look up " illegal via game laws" or anything related to that but couldn't find anything so my point stands, its not illegal to sell or buy ingame items with real money, I dont approve of it myself, I dont think its something good but you are breaking nothing but the game companys / publishers ToS, they are not, I repeat not legaly binding, depending on where you live you might need to pay taxes on the profit you made, thought that has nothing to do with the ToS but if your country has tax laws that apply to money earnd that way or not. 
---
ToS are used so the publisher can cover themself legaly when removing your acces from a game and similar things, so if you do get banned from their service you have no legal ground to sue them, but unless you break any acctual laws of your country there is nothing that can happen to you. 
---
With that reasoning my 50 cal should one shot everything
---
You sound like an ignorant kid.
---
When is this game gonna show up as the free one on ps plus so I can still ignore it? 
---
Didnt nuka always weight 1lb? It‚Äôs affected by the perk cards for food and drink. If you have the 3* for 90% that brings it down to .10 right?
---
If you see increased stash space as pay2win.
---
Im sorry to tell you but it already is p2win then.
---
You can buy an additional account, launch the game twice and you have over 10.000pound of carryweight for 12-15‚Ç¨ 
---
You can fast travel to vault 76 and just trade with your secondary account like its a stash space.
---
Having to log onto two accounts and look on all characters where ur item is, feels really clunky tho.
---
Thats why i suggest we cut out the secondary account and add it to the atom store.
---
You also earn atoms ingame so you could actually buy the stash increase by playing (i bought my "skins" only from atoms i have earned ingame, since i dont care for skins and dont wanna spend money on them, would be a different story for stash size tho) 
---
I can already one-hit most enemies and take down a Scorchbeast all by myself as is. üòä I don't need to be the best of the best. Lol
---
Were you on Xbox?  Seems like she‚Äôs going to be a lot harder to kill, we didn‚Äôt get close. 
---
They'll nerf the crap out of melee weapons too.
---
While they're doing that...........they'll nerf something else like White Knight that we all loved.
---
Meanwhile the player base is left to lurch and re-spec again and again to whatever the new "meta" is.
---
They need to have some sort of EXPERT on balance come in and normalize things.  Not just WHAM destroy one build type only to move on and WHAM destroy the next.  Balance it...........not completely nerf it.
---
Great patch, now we just need some end-game content for people who have done everything - we need a reason to play the game.
---
and now those grenades do baby damage :( 
---
I am not at endgame and have been deliberately pacing myself, only had it since Christmas (which I think is true for a lot of people). I am of the mind that they probably should have pushed back release by 3 months, but understand why they wanted to hit the Holiday market.
---
All that said: I get the impression that a *lot* of people playing this game do not come from an MMO background, but I think you have to look at it more from that perspective or at least acknowledge that sort of time-frame for content releases.
---
It took ~7months for World of Warcraft to implement Battlegrounds...classic experiences like Ahn'Qiraj didn't open until over a year after launch. Burning Crusades didn't come out for over 2 years. Now this was a long time ago and I'm sure the case can be made that games like Destiny are better parallels, but I'm not as familiar with that game/community/timeline. Just think everyone could use some perspective!
---
All persistent, multiplayer, online games have this endgame content problem though...95% of the player base is level 15-40 and the few hardcores playing have already leveled a DPS, a Tank, AND a Healer to level 60 in the first 2 months...do you fix the foundation of the game or tack on things here and there that will *momentarily* appease the outliers of your audience? Do you focus on large content releases that you can't reveal yet or do you just piecemeal in what you can as time goes on?
---
The end game is always *inevitably* to grind though...grind achievements, grind for items, grind pvp, grind currency, or start socializing. People on here are pissed they're implementing a more functional PvP mode which allows for your main to go between the PvE and PvP experience...even though this clearly will offer an additional pass-time to *many* players at end-game. For an (imperfect) idea of how difficult it is to balance an online game/address all player types see [Bartle's taxonomy of player types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types)...it's not so easy to just say "add content", one kind of content will only appeal to some players and every bit of content is a cost sink for the limited resource available: developer time.
---
I am hopeful they'll announce something exciting coming soon after the March patch, but like....be patient, this game has only been out for like 2.5 months....and a large swath of the player base has only had it for one full month now. :/
---
I fight MQ with a sacrificial dagger one hand build everyday
---
Looking at it now it just further validates the need to nerf it. 876 damage on a lvl 25 weapon is kinda nuts, legendary or not. 
---
can we get a roadmap for the roadmap reveal?
---
Gotta love these priorities
---
Sounds nice though, even if it's already way past christmas and they are no longer in the atom shop, at least the people who bought them at the "discount" price can now feel slightly better
---
I see.   
---
That good though, at least now you wont feel the need to use a weapon you got at level 38, it shouldn't be that way. Should be able to switch it out and still feel viable etc.
---
Keep it though, who know's they might get a buff again at some point :)
---
Don't hold your breath for any buffing.
---
Well, sure, but it IS PCMasterRace after all, so rules don't apply. ;)
---
Melee weapons are worse than TSE hands down.
---
PC. Thanks for the input! 
---
That wasn't the point. The person I was replying to wanted the otherwise-sacred weapons and armour of someone with even a tiny bounty to be randomly removed if they can't pay their killer.
---
I've had a bounty once only, and it was 10 caps. Picked the lock on an airdrop crate that was owned even though I'd picked one before and had no consequences. That's "intentional" is it? Malicious? According to the other guy, I should lose potentially my best weapon for that. I had an explosive combat rifle that I bought for the majority of my caps I'd saved, and was keeping it until I was level 40 (30 levels time). Do you agree with him that if I should lose that at a time when the bounty was claimed and I had no caps?
---
Oh i heard of this problem some where else. Some have adviced to open your stash box and put all or any junk you‚Äôre carrying to sync it. Then go back to the armor workbench. 
---
I agree if this is indeed a new feature they should have told everyone 
---
I'm excited for all of these fixes except for bringing down White Knight üòø that and weapon artisan are my favorite perk cards üòø
---
Melee has has been more powerful then TSE guns. Guns only had range.
---
Melee has always been OP
---
Bulking is almost completely useless unless you're selling junk. Just bulk what you can sell. I don't bulk anything except aluminum and lead, because they actually save weight. Nothing else does. 
---
People aren't happy because Bethesda dropped a glitchy dumpster fire, and after months there are still basic problems unresolved.
---
Not with so many hours in fo76. Very simple.
---
I never buy anything, but I‚Äôm also always over encumbered, so I rarely sell stuff. I‚Äôm level 45. I‚Äôve got about 2000-4000 I forget. Haven‚Äôt been on for a while. I just like knowing it is possible. And someday I will have my guaranteed plans. Rather than having to server hop 100 times with no guarantee I‚Äôll get what I want.
---
So one run nets you what? 3-400 caps. That's a lot of people's day of playing. Or half day. 
---
A single post on this sub with no evidence that should be deleted under the rumourmongering rules. That's it.
---
The next spec to get nerfed to crap
---
Then don't  play that way. You either choose to grind or you choose to play normally. Ya camt bitch about the cake while eatting it mang
---
lol Bethesda right!
---
Next in line to get hit with the Nerf bat. I won't be investing time into getting this set for same reason I never bought any TSE. It's evident it will get nerfed into Oblivion.
---
meh, not as annoying as you guys jerking each other off over what... who's meaner to employees you don't know?
---
This makes me so sad that we are right back to instant regen bug. That shit lasted for months....
---
All these bugs and you're gonna lose it over Bobby pins?
---
There still seems to be some amount of rng to the plans as prior to the patch I bought BoS and shadowed plans up st the Grafton station but they weren't in his inventory when I checked after the patch on a server.
---
You don‚Äôt need to know how to drive a helicopter and if you see one that drove into a tree, you know they mess up. 
---
And by nerfing and having the ability to download Ultracite plans, there is no benefit in killing the Queen.   It‚Äôs wasted ammo to get maybe some flux and a one star legendary. They killed the end game. Congratulations Bethesda. This is what is called stepping on your Johnson. 
---
Yeah hopefully they fix this issue and others soon!
---
I'm just going to go play something else for a while keep an eye on patch notes, maybe non legendary effect explosive weapons will get buffed along with energy weapons. Or maybe they will make the demo perk a 3 card now that it's so little buffage and give us our points back. I hear StarCraft 2 an Overwatch have some events going on now.
---
I agree 300+ damage handmade down to 72 with rifleman and demo perks havent check the rest of the TSE weapons.
---
The nerf was needed but not this much
---
If it takes me 5-6 shots to take down a 68 SM warlord, that's fucking dumb
---
This game F2P yet? Would like to mess around on it but not spending money to do so lol 
---
SOOOOOOOOOOO, overall this is a great patch BUT crafting sucks now. I went to craft a bunch of radium rifles to scrap for plans and noticed that the message "You don't have the required materials" continued to appear. I actually had tons of the required the materials in my stash that were in Bulk. It now seems that those bulked items are no longer usable for crafting. You now have to take them out of your stash and MANUALLY SCRAP EACH BULKED ITEMS to craft/repair anything. I really really hope that this is just a new and quickly fixed bug. Has anyone else noticed this HUGE new issue?
---
It's not at bug they actually put this in the patch notes..
---
&gt;**Scrapping:** Junk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft. 
---
I spent countless hours trading on the trading reddits to get a T45, T51, T60 Jetpack Plans and T51, T60, and Ultracite Calibrated Shocks Plans.  200+ trades with other real players.  Giving them what they wanted, getting what I wanted.
---
All that effort feels wasted now :(
---
I don‚Äôt quite get why they couldn‚Äôt just remove the explosive legendary perk from being affected with demolition 
---
They basicly have put a price on it already tho.
---
You get 10.500 pounds of carry weight on a new account that costs 12-15‚Ç¨.
---
So 600pounds increase for all 5 characters would seem fair for 5‚Ç¨ (maybe more, but thats the current price for stash space in the game)
---
I ran the mentioned perks for weapons and armor. They didnt proc enough and both would break regularly. PA durability far exceeds regular armor pieces fyi. 
---
Start with the uninstall button.
---
Level 144. I don‚Äôt have a TSE but the best weapon I have was a quad explosive double barrel. I haven‚Äôt even updated the game yet but I think I‚Äôll stay off until I hear things are more balanced. Not a fan of all the negative hype but I really do wanna have fun with this game and I‚Äôll keep my eyes open for the golden patch. 
---
I'm not, never got lucky enough in 400 hours to loot a TSE and didn't want to buy a duped one.
---
I really agree with this. A lot of new players (and some old) who aren‚Äôt familiar with the actual damage resistance you can achieve with the right gear and perks, instantly report them for cheating. 
---
Loose lips sink ships.
---
That‚Äôs exactly the thing! I like Fallout 76, but ignoring it‚Äôs technical shortcomings, the story is nonexistent and boring. It feels as if you‚Äôre playing somebody else‚Äôs play through after they‚Äôve finished the main story and fucked everything up. Like you said, it would‚Äôve been amazing to participate in the story. Bethesda could‚Äôve easy made a great single player story, but decided to hop onto the ‚Äúgames as a service‚Äù bandwagon.
---
If Bethesda waits to long on new content and they continue to fuck up patches... Not much more can be done about people leaving. Coming back to it will be exciting if you wait like 3 months im sure. 
---
Character name shows up or account name?
---
This is great. I hope they take it all into consideration.
---
It is way easier to charge an enemy and kill them with a melee weapon than it is to kill them at a range, especially since a lot of enemies are charging enemies.
---
That's when I got mine done - day of an update!
---
No. If you find and item at 45 that is the highest level it will go. Items only drop at levels they can be crafted at so the top levels for items are either 45 or 50 depending on what  it is 
---
You only need to go through some military camps in Cranberry Bog and you are set for multiple 5-piece repairs.
---
Alright, so, this game released unfinished, I think most everyone with a brain acknowledges that.
---
Even with that fact, I think *2 months* is *really fucking fast* to start complaining about new content.
---
Like, can you name me one other game that game out with a major content patch in their first 3 months? ONE other game?
---
That's just unreasonable.
---
What...? 
---
Well, I can tell you from personal experience that when I got the ability to construct the Excavator Armor I built it. That set me back significantly. Repairing power armor cost me. Making 40mm grenades also keeps digging into my stock.  
---
So, you know, maybe people that don't have springs don't have them because they're proactively using them. Just a thought.
---
Can i have your bobby pins...?
---
&gt;  competitive pvp play
---
Last patch reduced weight to what they said was 0.001 showed as nothing in the inventory. This patch right back to 0.1
---
Not sure why they nerfed it in the first place. Ammo weight and shitty durability make explosive weapons super undesirable in the first place. The perk investment required to lower the weapon weight, lower the ammo weight, increase their durability, and increase the damage enough to make them worth using is too damn high considering they are mostly only a secondary weapon since you'll smoke yourself shooting at nearby enemies or using them indoors.
---
Mate i have like 300 hours in this game, love it. Take the time enjoy  
---
Yeah. It's unfortunate but true. You could also try bloodied. I don't like the low health play style so I haven't bothered.
---
Does not always work. Did it yesterday. And that doesn't count the times a low level has initiated the spawns already.
---
You need to take a break. Go play r/outside
---
In Watoga? Or Grafton? I will be visiting after work. Now if they would give us rifle weight reduction perks so it doesn't weigh more than a freaking minigun or broadsider....
---
Bulk scrap, weapons, armor, drugs.  Grafton Steel  is infested with Super Mutants; just go run through it and sell everything they drop.   Or pop on some Excavator Armor and run through Lucky Hole mining all the Lead Deposits.  Covert, Bulk and sell the ore.
---
I'm not running Power Armor.
---
Ahhhhhhhhh that makes a lot of sense! I always assumed "scorched" meant just the human variants. I swear i learn a game changing piece of info every single day on reddit. I owe you a nuka cola!
---
BETHESDA. Base damage for my level 5 TSE pump action is now 97. With demolition expert ranked all the way up it does 107. So two extra points of damage per rank of demo expert. Now I have 5 useless points allocated to intelligence on my lvl 40 character. Is this what you intended? Demo expert is virtually useless now. 
---
My keep feeding my buddies that skipped this game that the updates are improving things.
---
They're going to pull the trigger soon. I explained the numbers pre/post nerf and they wondered why ppl are even upset.
---
2 affixes + 5 perk points for 3x damage is hard to balance a game around.
---
And "its fun" is subjective. Duping is fun, hacks are fun, exploits are fun, griefing is fun
---
Well it wont be an OP TSE that's fo'sure!
---
I think we have a solution for you. Plz PM me.
---
I agree with that. Now that we have an actual cap sink in the game, and caps from vendors are already limited, we should at least be able to carry around as many as we want at a time
---
3 different friends of mine were all waiting a few weeks to buy KH3 because they were enjoying FO76.
---
All 3 of them, over the course of today, have purchased KH3 and don't plan on coming back until Survival mode.
---
This patch is rough.
---
Oh wow. I havent been on. Thats crazy. 
---
Yeah I definitely appreciate the inclusion of optional PvP quests and events, but ever since the announcement I had hoped most of the game's PvP would be between player-made factions that had formed organically.
---
I wonder if they're just trying to give greifers something to do... which won't work, because they already have something to do: grief.
---
Naw, he sounds like someone with a job and a life.
---
The cap limit is causing me to simply have to run a daily schedule of vendor runs. This is *not* a good gameplay experience, it's a chore. The gameplay was gathering the junk and aid which I'm selling, it shouldn't be the same routine daily.
---
Then don't use it?
---
Let me get your caps 
---
No they don't, and some are bugged such that they'll actually COST you 58 DR/ER and 60 RR. BOS underarmors are bugged, as are Raider underarmors.  
---
Vault Suit isn't bugged, nor is Enclave.
---
So you're the one who stole my sweet roll!
---
Theres loads of Military Grade Duct Tape and Ammo Bags inside Silos as well. 
---
Yea makes sense. It's nice to be able and go get plans when you want them and not have to waste time server hoping trying to get lucky.
---
Lmao you're going to get down voted but you're right 
---
No, I like the change, I dislike the underhandedness of this and many other changes.
---
1) this is an undocumented change.
---
2) the selling the vendor cap was already an abitrary cap funnel designed to slow progress.
---
3) This Nerf to armor durability, combined with the last patch to increase armor repair costs and various other nerfs to resources.
---
4) Prioritizing heavy nerfs to meta weapons/builds over fixing currently useless and broken ones.  If you want to see build diversity, nerfing is not the solution.  People will just jump to the other effective builds like bloody melee (until this is inevitably nerfed).
---
To me, this means the developers are clearly trying to stall player progression by making the mundane chores of farming more tiresome and take up more player time so they can tread water because they don't have content.
---
Other Bethesda games are all about breaking the game, doing silly stuff, hoarding all the loot, etc.  This game feels the opposite, where players are penalized for doing everything they love from other Bethesda games.
---
There are alot of questionable textures, at least on console.
---
'It justs works'
---
Weapons got balanced and perks got balanced,  next  will be armor. At this point i am not shocked the dont have a more boring game.
---
They unlock by level. 
---
So is it because you are using a low health build? Something to do with the rads keeping your HP low so the perk card kept going off?
---
OP directly says he fought three scorchbeast, some regular scorched mobs, and a scorched mireluck queen. Even if you were running a really build I highly doubt you only used "a couple of stimpacks". 
---
Let me guess, your tse weapons are no longer overpowered?  Boohoo.  Let's write an angry letter.  Go do something else.
---
Mostly boohoo, hacker , duper etc. etc. and  ironically i get gunned down with TSE's when i don't respons to trade offers with players.. lowlevels usually just thumbs up or get freaked out..
---
crafting does not un-bulk crafting materials.  gotta break up the bulk manually.  lame
---
ü§î we could never prove it, could we?
---
wait, what.....she can still be killed after TSE nerf, who'd have thought it!
---
Not always, some people say that your pet will despawn once you move your camp, but so far for me my deathclaw never despawned and I moved my camp like 3 times.
---
You're right.
---
And 934 damage per shit is *completely fucking absurd* for the mechanics of this game.
---
That said, yes, bloodied melee builds need to be addressed.
---
I don't get why people are calling it a tse nerf. Its not just tse guns. Its literally anything twoshot and or explosive along with a nerf to perk cards that affects many other weapons. 
---
Yes log out to the main menu and then log back in.
---
Thank you for adding the known tag to plans and recipes!  
---
I don't think I should have to spend almost $20 to paint my PA blue.. 
---
New duplication glitch is out.
---
Just got home and loaded my game up, this game is absolute trash now. I was very much enjoying myself with this game. I haven't watched Netflix since 11-14. I played 6-8 hours a day , every day, I will watch the credits before I uninstall this trash , so I can make sure I never buy anything that any of you ever make again, your entire staff is a failure 
---
I have better inventory installed and now that save my stuff is gone everything is good. But I did just reinstall it- that may be your problem. 
---
How likely is it they're actually stealing code from modders? Can we prove it?
---
You‚Äôre assuming what, a price of 1 cap each? Could be much much less. 
---
I feel as though a legendary rifle should be worth more than a stimpack at the vendors. The ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù is very strange. Especially with the awkward trading system that is in place. 
---
This ‚Äúfeature‚Äù makes as much sense as requiring us to scrap clipboards before we can use the springs. What has happened is they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the auto mod scrapping, but then broke bulk. This is why it was never communicated.
---
Eh. I feel about the same. After 400+ hours I burnt out last week. Picked up RE2. Working on some art projects. If the game gets better, I'll cone back. If not, there's other things to do in life.
---
Nah i really dislike being on low health. I want a Instigating anti armor sniper with +1 perception. Perfect for my sneak build. 
---
How exactly is anyone being mean to a company who released an unfinished game and then used anti consumer practices like bait and switch? Btw maybe you missed it but It's not being aimed at employees it's towards you guys constantly sucking off Bethesda for doing the absolute bare minimum. 
---
But you keep on slurping.
---
I've also been experiencing this exact thing before this patch. 
---
That's the new system. No more randomization of available plans and mods, but increased costs.
---
Can confirm
---
You should test this before making statements. 
---
In a few hours i can make thousands of 5.56
---
With that build yeah, most of the time im in pvp its not planned, its someone either being a jerk when trying to farm a place or someone randomlu initiating while im trying to trade a vendor. 
---
Same. I carry a Handmade as a back-up Rifle, but my go-to weapon is a Lever Action. I‚Äôve loved that gun since New Vegas, and have used it as a primary weapon whenever possible.
---
*OH, no wonder I have so many learned plans...fuck*
---
Better Inventory has been updated. 
---
You have issuses. Re-read the other posts.. Smh..
---
I agree that this buff is just too much. I am currently sitting at lvl 132 I believe and as I spend most of my time adventuring by myself I can attest that many situations will no longer be manageable for me.(Out east mostly.) I could see nerfing the TSE weapons a little but this is overkill. And the perk cards nerf is enough to push me over the edge as I spent many hours and points leveling up certain cards due to me using my brain and looking at each cards stats and maximum benefit.(5% instead of 10% per rank...) so I'm not sure if I should take this as Bethesda just saying don't buy our game early because we didn't test it enough to prevent needing to waste hundreds of hours of your time when we nerf everything or if I should view it as Bethesda saying you should have to struggle and grind for everything in the game instead of providing proper bosses and loot drops.
---
At crafting stations in my camp, the resources I have stored are no longer recognized. If I have 5 bulk acid, when crafting gunpowder, it doesn‚Äôt acknowledge my 75 units of acid
---
THIS, I've noticed this as well, and I was jumping higher than normal with marsupial able to easily make jumps I couldn't solo but only when on a team. 
---
This absolutely needs to happen. It's incredibly frustrating for those of us who are high level now.
---
Omg yeah! Shocking news right..
---
A full spec into explosives can be up to 13 points, plus as many levels it takes to get other cards you can use. And that is assuming you are high enough level you can actually swap points. 
---
Instigating and anti-armor are both primary qualities. Probably +vats crit damage would suit you, and faster reload. 
---
Fix one think break 6 more! They reverted changes of Bobby bins, workshops, and apparently duping smh
---
no it's not. i kept raising my health to keep it out of stimpak range once i realized what was going on. I'm at 70% health and the card is one star so it's supposed to kick in at 20% health...
---
This is an entirely new issue, not a reverted change.
---
Just build your camp without the items and add them as and when you earn enough Atoms
---
Why the fuck would you ingame money for a gun than skins or cosmetics? You can literally grind 500 caps and then find a deal. 
---
Oh that‚Äôs my favorite, when griifers run up on to start something and you end it immediately. And then just laugh 
---
I experienced the same thing after being killed.  I'm not even running the card though, I'm running a low health mutated build but I just burned through a out 15 stimpacks.
---
No longer works if in bulk. I guess you have to scrap it then you can use it.
---
Yea... Its rough like we just got raped rough. I havent don KH since the ol' PS3 days. I would kill for a remasterd FF7.
---
I have seen a post of someone getting stuck in power armor again
---
Im a TSE weapon user, thankfully only paid in caps. Its annoying, but now I adapt and find a new build to use.
---
No no greedy boy, calm down and work for your own caps
---
Yes! Only some people would buy the stash increase, so it's lighter for the servers compared to universal character stash increase. They would get more money. Fallout 76 generates more money, so they have to put more devs to deliver faster updates and fixes to get even more money. We'd win there as well.
---
Since they introduced today the first step of P2W in the form of buying Atom Shop outfit to gain game play advantages, we are getting closer and closer to possible lunchboxes and other very welcomed microtransaction benefits. Things are looking great. I can't wait.
---
2h, it's basically an alternat fire axe, just wish melee weapons had more mod options to give them more 'niche' roles, like the guns can have
---
I somewhat agree with you; the game needs to be challenging, yes, but within limits. Scorchbeasts should absolutely spawn at their fissure sites - the first time you approach one - the problem is that they continuously spawn. You kill one, another one spawns immediately. There is no respite, and they are already hard enough to kill as it is. This is not fun.
---
The gameplay experience should by default be balanced for singleplayer for most experiences, with high-level map areas, public events, end-game missions, and nuke zones setup for parties. In my experience this is how most people are playing, typically joining up only for high-level enemy zones, end-game content and roleplay. The story missions, with the exception of perhaps the brotherhood questline, seem specifically designed with singleplayer in mind. 
---
Being dependent upon specific weapon archetypes and armor models is all well and good, provided that those are made abundant or easy enough to find/trade. This is not the way that the game seems to be designed though, as so much is wholly dependent upon RNG. Take your raider PA for example. I've never found enough pieces to make a complete set. Is there a bonus to dmg/rad/energy resistances for equipping a complete set? Why wouldn't my PA with 4 raider pieces and 2 T-51b pieces give comparable rad resistance. Why am I still popping rad-x at all while wearing power armor with 6 equipped pieces?
---
There's also no clear delineation of what numerical level of rad resistance will stop what level of rad damage. Is it 1:1? Probably not. 10:1? Probably getting closer, but again, I have no idea. The game doesn't make that visible. 
---
Haven't even gone into the pain-in-the-ass that is hyperspecialization in this game, and swapping perks.
---
Thanks, minimum expectation I think to be able to respec
---
You're the idiot. What you just stated about the engine not being the problem proves that you don't know a damn thing about programming. The devs and other programmers they have working on this game definitely aren't great... but trying to get an old engine to work 2 decades later is just insane. You can modify it as much as you want, but it still has limitations that you simply can't change, or they take an obscene amount of effort to work around. We would have way less bugs and performance issues if they just switched to a much newer engine. It doesn't at all help that the creation engine is innately buggy.
---
This was my line. Pick your poison 
---
This is honestly what puts me off another playthrough, I've already spent ages earning caps and hunting plans to buy them, just not interested in doing it again
---
yes but you will be expending more ammo which means you will have too spend more time either at the Ammo factory or looking for crafting components 
---
I stopped playing it the day after release. Haven't had the slightest desire to play it since. Not worth my time.
---
My 300+ handmade now does 72 damage with demo and rifleman perks on so it would be completely useless again the SBQ in my opinion.
---
haha 
---
Imagine having to go to the DMV in real life then starting that quest to relax when you got home!
---
The not being able to craft with bulked material is a really big fuck up. Any word on this being fixed immediately? Would rather not break down all of my bulked material to make ammo. 
---
Watch out bois, we got a 200iq over here. 
---
I‚Äôm all for a full respec option as long as it has a hefty cost/timer associated with it. 
---
No amount of reasoning warrants this power ok. Nerf was necessary. 
---
I had the military paint during beta but it got scrapped accidentally.. it had to be a bug because the military paint is not supposed to be in the world. I wish I still had it.. although I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to have been accused of getting in the dev room or something.
---
Sure that's why they're doing it. See you later
---
Basically TSE was the only way gun players could keep up with melee players. TSE nerf doesn't seem bad when compared to other guns but now they're pretty terrible compared to melee. Less damage, more upkeep, more farming, harder to obtain, more bugs, worse weight management. 
---
There's always been a lot of downsides to making a gun build compared to melee in this game and they just removed one of the only upsides. 
---
Hey, you leave a sweet roll alone on a dirty table in a post apocalyptic hellscape for more than 5 minutes, it's fair game. 
---
I have a mule that is full of zealot armour and weapons, a lot are 3 star too! Going to have to rejig my build after todays patch, but seems like my AA zealot super sledge is the way to go at the moment right?
---
Can‚Äôt say that I like this, kinda ruins the whole explore new territory for new thing and reinforces the boring grind.
---
you're getting the down votes, but you're totally right. Just wanted you to know!  ( and get some downvotes myself! )
---
Ah, is there one on the elevator side as well? Haven't done that questline in ages so couldn't recall
---
I irl lol'd
---
Yeah, they are good. Did a SBQ today with 3 random lvl 100's and 3-4 under 50 lvls and the Queen just melted after she finally landed. I used TSE Handmade and it worked pretty great. Either SBQ scales based on nearby players weapon damage or the TSE nerf made it so that now weapons do full damage on her.
---
No. Because it's jibberish. 
---
There is a list of bugs and exploits they fixed. Can you read what they said?
---
That‚Äôs the only problem though. Bethesda messed this one up because technically it‚Äôs not the armor that‚Äôs overpowered. Each piece only reduces a small amount of damage. They just never tested it before release and never imagined people would get every piece. (A mistake on their part) but, yeah man it‚Äôs gonna be a long few weeks before the next patch. Automatic TSE‚Äôs were the only way to kill someone with that type of gear and now you‚Äôre literally not going to be able to die. I tested it with my friend and the TSE‚Äôs do nothing to sentinel armor anymore.
---
You can yes, generally not for as many caps though, as loot drops *can* have mods, which increase the cap value
---
You've gotten lost somewhere. This thread was about XP and levels.
---
Thousands of caps is nowhere near the mark.
---
And I just don't understand why you assume I want easy-mode for pointing out that they are going backwards with some of their tuning. What I want are options that offer a similar levels of challenge. Not one that is far and away superior and getting more so with every update.
---
You play naked for the challenge, I'll keep waiting until they balance things a bit more.
---
\# FREE BOLO

Day 6 and still waiting on this ban to be lifted .
---
looking forward to seeing you guys in the wasteland soon .
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs usually not playing fallout so getting the plan would be beneficial to me
---
Yup.
---
I loved Fallout 4 because after grinding for hours to get awesome weapons they never got nerfed.
---
This bullshit makes me not want to play anymore.
---
Will this be the one and only nerf? .........I doubt it.
---
Not at all. The way this game shipped was absolutely horrible and they knew it. They saw during the beta and the could've pushed the release date back but they decided to ship it. I'm happy it blew up in their face. It goes to show other triple a studios you can't release trash and expect everyone to be OK with it. 
---
I dont want to spend atoms on something that should be a given.
---
it is in the bog it is just one of the randoms though it is fairly common. Even seen two pop at the same time. And it can be any place in the bog other than watoga. Most common is the antique store from my experience. 
---
I sell serums for cheap, lol
---
Most people buy more than one at a time, so it‚Äôs quick caps
---
that should be good
---
Same, lol
---
Nothing else needs to be said maybe but something definitely needs to be corrected haha. And I mean with your post
---
You have fun with that pointless grinding. Dont invest too much of your personal time. Lmao
---
Actually seeing players' character names instead of usernames would be nice too. Until then they're for your eyes alone.
---
Yeeaaa, I already got tired of it, imma hop back on the fo4 already
---
What's wrong w Halo? 
---
They are aware and looking into this.
---
That explains why I found about 1000 stashed in various containers at Top of The World.
---
Need to fix time meow!
---
Harpoon gun with flachette mod...
---
Totally agree.  Total disappointment.  Lost motivation to play.  What are these people thinking ???  Instead ... can they not do something good and helpful ??? Like increasing storage limit as they promised ... This game gets worse and worse.
---
They of course had to make everything expensive but its whatever. I use an excavator so these mods are worthless to me and most things are. The only shit i spent my caps on today were handmade plans and various camp items (which are pretty affordable)
---
If it is your 1st playthrough its fine. I spend most of my time exploring and building which does almost nothing for xp. But knowing what to do where to go you can easily hit lv20+ with that same playtime for your lv7. Question is what do you find more enjoyable. 
---
I agree, fuck Ubisoft.
---
Over nerf is the point though, they evil atm. In a week's time when they up it buy 25% they be heroes then. 
---
Bethesda marketing / PR department logic.
---
At least if you get the item here it isn't "increase damage by 20-100%" and you roll 20% therefore making the item worthless.
---
its not bargaining im done with this game im not spending an extra 30 minutes grinding resources for armor and gun repairs as well as ammo because thats time I could spend reading, Netfix, or Anime Maximizing content output for a given day  
---
Wonderful.    I still want my redline stapler...
---
The game was always a grind. But I get to play at work so as long as no one dies it's not really personal time
---
I agree that would be cool, and I know they probably won‚Äôt add something to change it because of the fact that only we can see them, but it‚Äôd be nice 
---
Omg a person with a brain in this community? Never thought id see the day
---
Yes sir. Fun fact is that it‚Äôs a part of the SBQ loot table. Have fun.
---
And a chainsaw!
---
YES! I hope that this isn't an intended change and is repaired ASAP.
---
Well yeah. Ppl that couldn't kill her before can't kill her now and the same is true for ppl that can.
---
I don't remember the last time i failed.
---
Unironically most close fights were won by mini nukes and orbital strikes which according to reddit are useless
---
braindead post
---
Because they don't weigh much and you can sell them?
---
Yeah, interesting. If it pops at the power substation you get Deathclaws spawning over and over. I'm not sure if it has any difference on rewards if it pops something like that.
---
The real question is who is going to be the sucky build that can shoot her out of the sky so that the meta melee builds can hack away?
---
Its not for melee for some reason.
---
Please do NOT ‚Äúnerf‚Äù it‚Äîbut don‚Äôt allow the legendary effects to work while the character is on the PVP/Survival server.   I.e., let it work normally on a PVE server but disable the effect on the PVP server (allowing the items to remain in the game but be enabled/disabled based on server type).  
---
Yeah you keep telling yourself that.
---
If there are rifles doing that kind of damage then it's down the the legendary effects and possible bobblehead stacking. There's no way a normal rifle of any type is doing that kind of damage, even with all the relevant perks. I have a fully modded Gauss Rifle and all the perks and it's doing 273 base damage before adding chems or sneak multipliers 
---
I agree. They should have just nerfed the explosive part to where the demolition perk doesnt work with the legendary explosive perk imo.
---
Didn‚Äôt I read that movement in power armor is 20% slower?  It certainly does feel slower.
---
Doing things in power armor that use action points will use up fusion core.  If you use vats to get by, you may not want to use power armor to get by, or vice versa.
---
Does 200+ damage as standard with my rifle build, if i recall. See what the coming days bring, with build suggestions/tips and whatnot eh.
---
My job only requires about an hour a day and couple of full days a month. Yeah I got my moneys worth but my wife who plays didnt, and a lot of my friends left as well the plan price increase was the final nail in the coffin.
---
I have over 1k hours in diablo 3 and still thouroughly enjoy it. 
---
Hells yeah there is, also a chainsaw and not the ripper a full on fucking chainsaw üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Wheres the raider armor crafting??? Tell them they forgot to include that. 
---
The save my stuff mod did this for me, I had to remove it. It's a mod you have installed that's causing this for you.
---
PS4: Vendors are offering all plans, but if you buy any they just take your money. Where the costs supposed to increase significantly on everything? 
---
On the plus side I have just binned 200lb worth(less) of plans from a mule, leftover of 100s of Motion-assisted Servos and Ultra-Light Marine ridden Distant Thunders and treasure map digs.
---
Felt good and bad at the same time.
---
Good that I am almost at the point that I can once more trade with the vendors, bad thar I have spent the last 300 hours doing it wrong. 
---
Downvote all you want.  I'll even downvote myself.  This is one of the best patches, if not the best since release.  Just a whiny butch like everyone else on here complaining about their tse weapons. 
---
It's made me consider that I probably don't need quite so many.
---
Dying doesn't always fix it...
---
What? If the audio goes missing for 15 minutes of a movie, people do walk out and get refunds. If I order a mocha latte and they give me a vanilla latte, that drink would be refunded too. It doesn‚Äôt matter if 90% of the movie worked fine or if the drink is *still* a latte, people want what they ordered.
---
And I would hardly call 100% reduced to 60% a slight reduction. Especially for a perk that‚Äôs integral for any build that uses explosive weapons. Using your analogies, that‚Äôs almost half the movie missing and getting a latte a little under half empty. In those circumstances, a business will usually give a full refund and then some extra credit to save face.
---
You mean 343 studios?
---
 i got the 45smg one from a sb at whitesprings. Was pretty shocked as all they ever drop are organs.
---
I just got it out of whitesprings safe room
---
In order to release code the developer needs to **prove** to the release manager that the code does what it is supposed to do.
---
* At some point someone was given the task 'Make Bobby Pin weigh 0.001'.
---
* To provide proof of that the developer must have submitted a test report saying 'This proves Bobby Pins now weigh 0.001'.
---
* The test that generates that proof becomes part of the global regression suite that is run on every release candidate in order to prevent regressions.
---
So why did this test not fail before the most recent patch?
---
Figured out the problem.  Before the update I was using a larger monitor, I had switched monitors before the update today.  I guess because the games video settings were set for the old monitor, the game wouldn't open.  If I hadn't been able to hook my PC up to my old monitor, I don't know how I would have fixed this, as the launcher has no options to reset in game options or change video settings.
---
Melee kinda bores. I use the All Rise as a secondary weapon
---
Nice try, Todd.
---
I just killed two guys in full assassin sentinel sets using my gauntlet, you just have too hit them hard and then fast 
---
The points are: 1) that it's a complete oversight and that revert should have never happened in the first place and 2) what else reverted? Is mass duping back? What previous bugs might have been reverted?
---
I agree it's a small thing that doesn't bother my 310 carry weight having, non-lockpicking ass but leads to big questions. 
---
 Bye Felicia
---
Rockstars standards have gone way down since red dead redemption 2
---
Showhealth is incompatible with my mod because we modify the same file.  Any mod that modifies hudmenu.swf will not work until their author updates it.
---
Ifgaf
---
That is exactly what I said about my explosive radium rifle.........
---
But they nerfed it to shit anyways. Now I'm on the Nerf train.
---
How much per stimpack, super stimpack, .45, .50, and 5 mm?
---
This, it really needs to go. If you must keep it make explosive an AMMO type and not a legendary effect. It was a terrible design to begin with.
---
I agree, an AAE handmade will easily out damage most melee in sustained DPS. PvP would be no contest and melee would die before getting in range, especially if they are a bloodied build and not using full cavaliers.
---
I have a op instigating +40% pwr atk +1str super sledge and the pwr attack 1 shots most enemies but I eat a ton of damage getting to mobs.
---
Using a rifle you can sneak for +2.5x damage and get crits to the head all while taking minimal damage. I also see no mention of opening with a dragon or Gauss. Dragon base damage is 250 ish, so if you use a bloodied, explosive with full perks and critical... That's something like 400 base damage x2 (bloodied) for 800, then critical or sneak will push it over 2,000 damage. Around 1500 with Gauss rifle. 
---
I didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference myself
---
Not enough to remove deep pockets from my legs
---
1k. I can throw in 500 bullets as well
---
No my post is correct.....
---
I completely agree.
---
One comment without any proof and you're all out here parroting this as fact. It's shameful. 
---
This was listed under Scrapping though I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt realize the inconvenience it would cause: ‚ÄùJunk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft‚Äù.
---
I had the sound effect going off, but I didn't check to see if a Stimpack was being used each time.
---
Fallout76 was designed to be Bethesdas first major attempt at a multiplayer game. It was meant to have multi player elements at its forefront. I'm not going to pretend I possess metrics for how many players partake in pvp, but for you to say a small percentage engage in pvp is mistaken. The game wasnt designed to be fallout5 the single player pve experience like you want it to be. In my humble opinion looking at how they designed the game it was meant for co operative play with the option to play by yourself secondary. Bethesda did a fine job finding a middle ground to appeal to a younger audience and older like myself.  They stuck  to their guns with multiplayer elements, but still put out a product with sufficient single player world immersion. As i mentioned the balances affect pve too. I guess your to caught up in the pipedream of a fallout5 single player mode to forget the benefits of not one shotting the games toughest enemies.
---
The question is wtf would myself and other players stick around after having their gear nerfed?
---
Why should I invest another 300 hours into this game if they're just going to move the goal posts?
---
It's bad enough to rely on an RNG for weapons and armor but now you need to worry about if your gear is going to be nerfed?
---
To hell with this game I'm leaning towards Diablo 3 on my Nintendo Switch.
---
I can't sell anything or buy anything. There's some bug. It has to do with the weight max I think
---
Just started a new character and every plan I pick up says (Known) since my other character knows them.  However, when I go to craft my new character does not.  Very confusing to see (known) when they in fact do not know them.
---
Dude I agree, fuck activision. EA really needs to stop with crap like this, fromsoft went too far with this update...
---
You're so good at shittalking
---
Exactly this. 
---
Instead, they want to make the game MORE tedious. 
---
No thanks. I have good, fun, well made games to play. Its time I went back to them for a while.
---
Thanks man :) But I am on PS4, and I want to find them by myself.
---
So we made regular armor worse, basically forcing power armor. Made anything explosive useless, nerfed two shot which wasnt even the problem... BUT OH SHIT MY CHEMS ARE LIGHTER THATS COOL!
---
We told them IMMEDIATELY that nerfing the two-shot damage was a bad idea, and that it was th explosive part that was OP. They seem to listen, but not hear or understand it all...
---
I like the idea of it forcing people to change their playstyle up, but it simply doesnt work that way. So yeah, let us pimp our hazmats or just wear armor with it.
---
Some of the bulk junk saves space, not all of them, but saves some none the less.
---
Offered no suggestion to improve the game, nor any reason for the angry letter.  Absolutely the game needs to be fixed.  That was known before release. 
---
650 hours in and then an angry letter.  The OP is just butthurt over his now useless tse weapons but didn't want to sound like the other 100s of posts that came streaming in since the patch went live.
---
7 per stimpack
---
10 per super
---
600 for every 1000 of .45
---
.50 ball 1c per bullet
---
Not selling 5mm or .50
---
I like the amount of salt that seems to have been put in with this last patch.
---
You can buy it off him, but you need an anchor to keep him in the lobby.
---
Have a friend keep him busy while you log out and log back in.
---
If you leave the game without an anchor and come back he will be gone even if you rejoin the same lobby.
---
What if i told you every silo and military installation has them?
---
if only there was not a mag and bobble stacking issue pre patch that caused that instead of the weapon...
---
I'll play through the bugs.
---
I can't play with my friends if they all quit.  Doesn't matter how many bug fixes they have then.  0 friends playing = I've got to find a game they will play :(
---
theres a new method where crafting isnt necessary
---
I'm still having plans without the "Known" Tag
---
Yep games on it's way out so I'm out before it 
---
good news!
---
Thought you were out? Peace?
---
They were way overpowered before. 
---
I've been using a non-legendary Lever action from level 35 - 85 and I've been fine.  Not sure what everyone is complaining about.
---
I can't wait until they nerf bloodied builds and cavalier/sentinel armor that people bought.
---
Increase it to 500 perhaps (or, cause Hard Bargain to increase the limit) in spite of how much I hate it I understand the vendor function of somewhat curbing the cap economy.
---
As a Quantum-Knight of the Nuka-Knights Faction, I approve this message!
---
Ikr.
---
Thats exactly it.
---
And they did succeed in my case. I have to admit, they have successfully stretched out the time I will spend playing and spending money on OTHER games quite handily. 
---
Good!   I spent months grinding and only found two X01 jetpacks, 2 X01 calibrated shocks, and 1 X01 stealth mod.   No one should have to work that hard.  And server-hopping (and related system drains) will be reduced.  
---
Its something to complain about.
---
KH3?
---
"under your protection is it you little shit?"
---
I'm on my last straw with these nerfs. I get the intention, but they made the problem worse instead of better. Might just go play something else for a couple months.
---
Does this mean you have to be a certain level to use a plan? Let‚Äôs say a low level has a plan with a high level requirement to buy it, can they not use it?
---
So.....are grenades absolutely useless now? They didn‚Äôt have much damage to begin with and was only worth using with the Demolition perk...WTG. *slow clap with a blank stare*
---
No, it's because they fix one thing, and end up breaking two other things because of it.  Or, in the case of TSE weapons, they broke more than two:  Two shot (err, +25% shot weapons), Explosive weapons, grenades, missiles... Plus other things that were good quality of life perks that really weren't abused (white knight - Less repairs, but give up other perks that gave more damage?)
---
It's like no one at Bethesda is in touch with their creation.
---
Kill it, kill it with fire!!
---
That just made me have a funny thought :)
---
Do you know the Geico commercial where the camel is walking through the office yelling IT'S HUMP DAY!
---
That would be me running through Bethesda's office saying IT'S CONTENT DAY!  WHOOP WHOOP!
---
I'm with you on griefers, but they could have just made demo expert not apply to legendary effects. As-is they screwed a bunch of legit explosive builds that were already somewhat underpowered. 
---
It was my first drop ever from one, besides organs and some random ammo.
---
I had one prepared for the bobby pins, but my break was ending. I might post a complaint and screech myself on that one because I have hoarded bobby pins. You can never have enough bobby pins.
---
In a perfect world... men like me would not exist
---
I loved the no NPC atmosphere. the bleakness of it. The loneliness. 
---
But late game, without quests, factions and interesting choices with real consequences...the game just becomes...pointless busywork.
---
turns out, survival for its own sake, does not a compelling game play experience make.
---
heath regen mutation not working properly either.  no mobs anywhere nearby - at all and I can't shake threat in sneak or regen hp
---
What does White Knight do?
---
Have you noticed anything different after this latest patch in regards to 21:9?  I play at that res as well and the UI looks different now after the latest update.
---
No level restrictions on using plans, just on finding the plans on vendors.
---
you know that most online games / mmo's have had nerfs yes?
---
Its great fo4 didn't nerf your weapons, go play that.
---
FO76 is online multiplayer if your weapons are OP and effect other people no shit there going to get nerfed!
---
Part of it is that the Barn Plans that were being sold before (at least from Free States) were mistakenly another decor and didn't unlock the barn stuff. So when they fixed that they may have forgotten to add the real Barn Plan back in.
---
I will say as well though, I just found the Suitcase Plan at a vendor for the first time as well. So it's possible some of this stuff was just ultra rare by design.
---
Crutch for poor builds? Boy you obviously have too much time on your hands. I dont have the want, time, or care to sit online or in game to screw around with minor cards. As an adult, with a family, define to me then how exactly i can make up the the 450 damage per shot i was getting from the 2* lever action i use? I already have maxed single shot rifle, explosives. What else is there exactly? You seem to have all the answers...
---
OK. That's definitely the better answer ^^
---
&gt;***"I paid for game, so they should only make changes I want them to make!"***
---
Dont worry in 6 months everything will be nerfed to the point that tse's will be the top weapon again. Really though im waiting to see the difference for myself. Are tses really that useless now or is it just grossly exaggerated? I am happy to hear about the plans and that they let us know if we know it now. 
---
I got a flare gun from a 3-star legendary and then a drill from a 2-star with only four legendary drops between them
---
1) PC, i5-4690K @ 3.50GHz, 16.0 GB RAM, GTX 970
---
2) beefwindowtreatment

3) NA

4) I'm able to log into the game launch screen.  I press "Play" and it gives me the "World Found" message and then immediately crashes to desktop.
---
5) NA

If you're commenting about an issue, it's best to be as clear and informative as possible. This allows people to quickly glance at something, understand it, and upvote if they're experiencing the same problem.
---
But i don't grind...
---
Who's laughing now lolololololol because I didn't pay real cash for a OP weapon that was bound to nerfed.
---
And yet, you keep buying and playing...
---
So was I really lucky finding plans for the handmade when I was level 15 
---
I have also just experienced this in PvP. Very odd
---
Lol right? My max lvl with all shotgun cards and bloody mess was around 1200 before Adrenalin buffs. Less than 300 now lol
---
We‚Äôre digging into this to understand the scope of the issue. If you or anyone else have more information you can provide, we will be actively looking at comments related to this.
---
Right? That stat shouldn‚Äôt be *that* powerful. I bet it‚Äôs still a great gun for a level 25
---
I have 2 Grognak axes , Ghoul Slayer and Anti Armour, both favourited but the Ghoul Slayer is unfavourited when i log in.
---
Marsupial jump occasionally has a wierd step in the air animation &amp; it didn't work once so i logged out and back in,, it was fine after.
---
VTU Baseball cap is missing pip boy item on its inspection &amp; doesn't sit correctly on the players head.
---
Ps4.  
---
Happened to me as well lmao. I got all of them. Lol was jumping and slowly dropping from normal height, ate raw meat got a disease but also x2 benefit for it. Super weird. Hopefully they do hot fix in the next few weeks for this updates flaws.
---
Idk, my instigating handmade sneak attack still one shots most enemies. Maybe not a col gutsy. 
---
My zealot scorched killer lever gun sneak attack can take down a scorchbeast in 6 or 7 shots depending on crit attacks. 
---
I think the end game TSE weapons, people relied on then too much, I've only had one or two TSE with over 500+hrs gaming and I hardly used but one. (mostly because I kept killing myself when mobs got too close)
---
Now that they're nerfed, and nerfed hard, you can either quit the game or strategize another build and love the game for how it plays. Aside from the single player one shot wonders, this game is multiplayer focused and as of right now the only require multiplayer is a sbq fight. (although somebody mentioned they can solo them). 
---
The concept of single player OP is not the focus of this game. It's building strategies to complement other players and teams. 
---
I think Bethesda is well aware of the transition from single player wonders and heroes to multiplayer faceted teams requiring synergy. They are working that angle and getting a lot of grief for it. 
---
I guess that was a bit of a rant, but in conclusion, the TSE was too heavily relied upon and if you're quitting 76, let me get your caps. 
---
I'd follow you there, but my best friend already doesn't like the cowboy genre.
---
He likes games like Fallout, H1Z1, DayZ, etc.  More post-apocalyptic.
---
Definitely let me know if RDR 2 gets some sort of zombie or nuke revamp.  I'll be on that like flies on crap :)
---
thats the thing, Bethesda has your cash. They dont care if you stop playing right?
---
If anything it's better for them if you don't play as then the servers will have 1 less person on them.
---
Im here to lift a problem and let it be solved.
---
You are here to try make someone laugh..
---
Is not a problem abt i had bought tse or if i found tse, is a problem that the game is unplayable now.  No ballistic long range weapon now is good against enemies.. Only melee. And should i play my whole game like a japan manga inside a post nuckear world hit a deathclaw with an hammer?
---
It make useless any other weapons !!
---
If u cant understand this, than mean your age cant be over 12 yrs old..  If is your age is over 12, u hv a serious problem or maybe u are just from undevolped country.
---
Diablo 3 has also been out for 6 years, instead of 2-3 months.
---
I feel like I shouldn't have to point out how different that time period is...?
---
And I'm not exactly thrilled about the plan price increase but it seems like a really strange hill to die on when it comes alongside no more plan RNG whatsoever.
---
Hopefully they fix it, but probably won‚Äôt for at least a month
---
Pc will have better graphics but it‚Äôs more fun to play on console (my opinion)
---
Just take a break dude I'd be done with any game after 650 hours.
---
I mean it sounds like you got your money's worth. Take a break.

After accessing power armor station at the Ammo Dump west of Sons of Dane compound every time I bring up my pipboy I get the power armor version of it when not in power armor.
---
Entering and exiting power armor is not a fix.  I have not restarted game to see if it reverts because it's not a critical issue and I'm busy bug hunting...hah!
---
At this point, this is just hilarious.
---
lol you nailed it, I totally forgot about the 1 screen loading and was suprised when I first logged in, also I didn't get the pip-boy freeze after opening it up too fast on first login.  
---
I'd like to buy it but for some reason I can't.  Somehow, I really can't start playing if I don't vendor something.  It's part of my routine.
---
Well yeah, this nerf hits a lot of people because people were obviously gravitating towards the strongest equipment.
---
Vats and crits.
---
My 100 damage combat rifle still 1 shots level 68 super mutants.
---
If your gun build relied on demo expert to do high damage that's a problem.
---
This is very entertaining lol. That amount of heat this community brings.
---
Still seeing corpse disappear before they can be looted. Happened on several occasions
---
Not to mention the need now for more repairs, considering I already have the ability to repair up to 200%? Or the mass of ammo that will now change? 
---
I understand, but I want to change mine. It bugs me lol
---
This fix a few things, fundamentally break something that wasn't broken is starting to get a little old.

 &gt; We‚Äôre digging into this to understand the scope of the issue. If you or anyone else have more information you can provide, we will be actively looking...
---
If i have to invest more time farming for ressources to actually play the game than playing normaly theres clearly something wrong.
---
I wasted so many perkslots for all those CND enhancing perks. 200% gun repair, fix it good 3, +50% weapon durability, white knight 2(maybe need to up that), ammosmith 2.
---
They should fix the root of the problem. Weapon/armor cnd, ammo crafting mats and so on. 
---
My tee pump used to do 572 damage and now it does around 153 which is worse than my all rise and the other tse weapons don‚Äôt even do 100 dmg anymore
---
Now that version, I would play.
---
But the Anthem demo is right around the corner...as is the new Obsidian RPG, and the new Double Damage Space Game...and I am going to need HDD space.
---
Fallout 76 is QUICKLY working its way toward the chopping block. Clueless, unskilled devs on ancient tech, with literally no fucking idea how to make a multiplayer game or a compelling late game experience...versus actual good, quality games on modern engines...
---
Yeah. Not a tough decision.
---
Having unannounced major perk card changes that can impact an character's abilities is BS.  I feel sorry for people that had perk cards for explosives builds, and now have to grind through 6 or more levels at a fraction of the power they used to have.
---
What do you normally play? I don‚Äôt think it matters much, pick the controller you feel most comfortable with. Keyboard, PS4, or Xbox
---
Appreciate the info.
---
WHITE KNIGHT ! NOOOOOOOOOO!
---
I see
---
Wouldn't any game with that many hours get boring? Why would you invest so much time in something you find broken...? This post is hypocritical, and your arguments make no sense.

MMO's have nerfs get over it. They will buff TSE's and nerf melee builds again. That's the thing, once the nerf bat starts swinging they cant stop.
---
Its a poor poor development team that things nerfs are the answer, they told all you TSE users a month ago this was coming though, didn't you get the memo?
---
Also true
---
Noooooo way..... ¬¨¬¨

You didn't want to go with Butcher Pete's "hackin' and wackin' and smackin'"?

Seems like a missed opportunity. 
---
How much does it cost to fast travel to all the vendors? I have never had above 2k caps.
---
The higher ups always shove the game out of the door way before it's ready
---
You know i messed up with that one. Didn't check for myself and i based that info off a screenshot in another post. I didn't click on the screenshot and actually check if it was the reciep or serum. Shame on me ;)

Thank you for not being a jerk about it

Legitimately, since the day this game came out, I've scavenged, looted, and collected. Learned tips from this forum on how to Bulk. Grinded at WhiteSprings. Oh and maybe had a person or 2, leave bags of stimpacks and nukes on the ground, that has still left me overweight. Those 2000 stimpacks are all gone. 100 of 2000 Nukes left. Honest weight has come from Bulking and junk collecting. Picking up legendarys dropped at W.s. I'm currently at 8500 weight and most is from inert Flux, power armor + chassis, legendary guns and armor. My hopes was to sell as a vendor but sadly that update has not come. I now won't be able to sell unless I do it thru mule means or use a friend as middle man. Or give it away. I mean I'm just playing as I have been like in fallout 4. Bethesda is just forcing us to become a different type of fallout player for those that play the game legit. Also the way I play, I'm sure other players play the game the same. Just my thoughts and perspective. Now I have to figure out how many mules to make to ditch the weight. L8tr!

I understand it can be frustrating when you are thirsting for content, we do have a lot of things planned to release and are working on finalizing a visual roadmap for you for future content drops. I commented in another thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajp8a5/please_release_a_planned_roadmap/eeymseh) more information.

If you don't want to click that link here is a copy/paste, and I apologize for the blatant copy/paste but for the sake of staying consistent with this message I'll give the exact response:  
---
&gt;We hear you and we're laying out what's coming for Fallout 76 in our 2019 roadmap, including new PvE content.    
---
 But to provide full transparency, our #1 priority remains taking care of known issues and new user reports that you have been sharing since launch, and we‚Äôve delayed locking in the timing for upcoming content while we stabilize and improve the core game.¬†  
---
&gt;While we‚Äôve made progress across many of the issues you‚Äôve been experiencing and will continue working on those, as well as the new issues that come up, our dev cycle will soon shift towards the new content you‚Äôve been asking for, including Vault Raids, new Quests, new Events, new PvP content, and much more. 
---
I'll upvote it. Screw those whiny turds. Haha
---
My tse dragon went from obo2k to 700 
---
You must not f76 then
---
Yeah, I can't imagine it's too good. 
---
I love this game don't get me wrong, I'm fairly patient and optimistic about most things but even so, it took 3 months to make me take a break, I can't imagine most "gamers" share my optimism and patience and most of them left a month or two ago, and if this patch made **me** take a break... well... those numbers are only gonna go down.
---
&gt;from QA ... ) 
---
I dont think the developers are getting heat from them, as it seems pretty clear there is no one in that department
---
Is that out back if the clubhouse? If so, its kinds a dick move that fucks the whole area for everyone. Just sayin. 
---
It was not in the notes...along with countless other changes..
---
One other I‚Äôve seen is the hud pop up when someone is using their mic, shows their name and such...I like it...another good addition they just completely leave out of the patch notes..  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
**'Scrapping:** Junk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft' This needs rolling back asap. Because of the lack of stash space everything is bulked to save space, Unable to craft/repair unless the bulked item is scrapped before hand, who asked for this? You can't repair AA turrets in the field if your materials are bulked...urghh...this game is always 1 step forward 2 steps back. 
---
Can you read dude. I was literally googling to see the state of the game.
---
My issue was never bugs and never has been. Fo76 has a fundamentally boring design. I was hoping things were added to address that the game is a waste of time with little entertainment value. Even if it is completely bug free that would be the case.
---
I don't know how you can say if you liked the other games you'll like fo76. The other games had a purpose/story for you to believe in and wasn't just endless radial quests. That was the worst part of fo4 and seems to be the only thing to do in fo76
---
D-, id bump it to a C-/D+ if it was not for the licensed plumber nerf, the one advantage my pipe guns had over the overwhelming firepower/damage of machined guns.

For a lot of the resources I've found you can trade for them on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  Most things like mats are 1 cap each.  Screws and Springs are 3 caps each.  Ammo goes for 4 rounds for 1 cap normally.  Sell things you don't need, then buy what you need :)
---
Although with the un-needed and un-asked for White Knight Perk nerf...........Ballistic Fiber is going to be a problem again.  FML bane of my existence in the early game, and now it's coming back to rear it's head again.  I'm probably going to have to run power armor half the time to keep supplies up (which I'd rather not do).
---
I'll be in the wasteland with my spiked board if anyone needs me bring it on.
---
Fall of TSE era, Rise of Melee build coming soon.....
---
It's not just crafting new stuff.
---
It's also broken for repairing existing gear: You have to manually unbulk the mats you need if you don't have them loose already.
---
Have you killed a SBQ since the patch? I will attempt it again tonight, but im pretty sure it's going to be a fing joke...
---
Cool, you should ask them to listen.
---
I have White Knight ranked all the way up and my armor still breaks eventually. If I sacrificed my perk points so that I don‚Äôt have to fix my armor as ‚Äúoften‚Äù as usual, I should reap the benefits of it rather than regret my former decision.
---
I would say PC, because of graphics, mods, settings, and the ability to use any controller, along with a keyboard and mouse. But if you have friends on other platforms, I would play on the platform they play on.
---
oof. 
---
Fyi, you didnt actually give me any solutions.
---
I do unyielding with low health. I sit around 34 strength and can one punch level 91 death claws. I die often, but that is mostly due to me being over ambitious and having a who gives a turkey attitude. 
---
Right now I go unarmed ( mole miner gauntlet) or my trusty mr buzzy blade. 
---
You want to either get all 3 levels in the one handed or two handed weapons class. plus iron fists just to swap in at times. Then you want to get incisor and martial artist. next you want radicool, unyielding armor, nerd rage, solar powered and tenderizer. Also get adrenaline. Lower the shit out of your life and keep it low. 
---
Also mutate mutate mutate. 
---
good luck. 
---
Sorry I triggered your insecurities. Have a nice life.
---
And you can't sell the bulk either.

Not trying to sound rude but from a business perspective......that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
---
The game is already dropping in price because it's already unpopular and I doubt they've even come close to recouping their cost to develop the game. They're counting on sales in the Atom shop for revenue......less consumers means less money. No business in the world wants less customers.
---
They made it a cap grind. 
---
PLEASE PLEASE someone test the dupes being back and YouTube it so we can see heads roll in the news outlets!  
---
No joke
---
I brough T-60/T-50b jetpacks for like 7k each, plus T-51b plus calibrated shocks... cause I was sick to death of server hopping
---
Effort wasted, I agree, but this is a good, needed change. Even if some plans costs have **skyrocketed**
---
Runescape, ah the literal definition of a grind. Somewhere around 4-6000 hours in the game.
---
that goes for any item 
---
I dont think it is that broken. I dont have any amazing guns though. I'm also not using any mutations. Nor am I using maxed rifleman perks (just 40% worth).  What am I missing that makes it super OP? 
---
I go the the overseers camp all the time and put my extras in there i dont dump into disappearing bags 
---
I am with you. I am a heavy and have a TSE 50 cal, it has been too strong. It is still strong but not OP anymore.
---
However, i think Beth has dropped the ball. Overall they should nerf less and buff more. Make more people have more fun instead of focusing in destroying the game for a few that might be having too much fun. 
---
The game is too unfinished for the focuse on balance on a few things. The focus should be on the mass amount of useless gear in the game.

We've reached out to the Dev's for their reasoning behind this and have updated the patch notes with the following information;
---
&gt;‚Ä¢    (Added Jan 29) Since many Plans and Recipes can now be sourced reliably from Vendors, we've also increased their Cap costs accordingly.  
---
&gt;‚Ä¢    (Added Jan 29) Dev Note: Recipe and Plan prices were originally based on the rarity of showing up in a Vendor‚Äôs inventory. Guaranteeing their appearance significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes and we‚Äôve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others‚Äô equipment for a cheaper price.
---
You can't even compare VATS accuracy for normal weapons vs two shot weapons. If the VATS accuracy for normal weapons is regular XCOM levels of bullshit than the VATS accuracy on the second shot of two shot weapons is like AI XCOM units landing every single hail mary and always proccing any &amp; every possible beneficial effect levels of bullshit‚Äìyou'll be thinking "what the fuck, that actually did happen" ***because*** that 95% VATS chance shot actually landed both of your two-shot's bullets.

its like your trying to kill this game.... grenades are now as worthless as the leather jacket your trying to sell for 276$

Might try closing all the way out of the game and logging into your other character. This is a bug I also reported on nexus to the known plan mod there. Wonder if they borrowed his code.
---
yup
---
I have a full armor set of 3* legendary pieces, including 100% fall dmg reduction and 20% weapon reduction and other neat prefixes. But never have i ever found a useful gun. Until today i used a TSE dragon that a kind stranger gifted me.

oof indeed my friend. The ~1500 was worth it to stop checking for the prison event every login though.
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to play my main since first patch cause sneak has been broken since launch and they won‚Äôt even address it 
---
Oh man, the gaming industry is sure going to receive a hit from a dude not buying games. You tell Bethesda, tiger! _/s_
---
K bye 
---
Thanks for the updates/fixes, especially adding the "known" tag for plans. Three post-patch observations:
---
1. Upon loading into my CAMP, I fall into geometry (quite a ways), become immediately crippled &amp; lapse into the "call for help" death throes
---
2. The slider counter for trading items is still off (e.g. doesn't stop at 0)
---
3. Harvesting corn is... deathly silent. :-)
---
I'd be happy with 1 &amp; 2 being hot-fixed. Silence of the Corn... it can wait. ;-)

Lol thank you! :) I'll go be edgy elsewhere. Lol loser.

makes sense as phoenix is brootherhood and watoga station / harper's ferry are free states
---
Probably still stupidly strong on shotguns I‚Äôd imagine 
---
Nothing sold by vendors was ever level capped. Higher level players just had a bigger pool of items they could possibly buy, so the chances of getting the ones you wanted got smaller as you leveled up.
---
What about the repeater reload glitch? Did y‚Äôall even attempt to look into some of these glitches. how can you guys be so lazy that glitches known by the community(even fixed by modders) that were in your previous AAA game are carried over to this game. Also almost all of your guns have right handed grips but left handed receivers it doesn‚Äôt like a single person at BGS has the ‚Äúgun-nut‚Äù perk bc y‚Äôall have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre doing. 
---
Atari dropped the ball hard. It's like E.T. 2

Do it now. We wont be mad. Just fix it.

So you don't do PA at all?

Sometimes that‚Äôs what your endgame consists of. Collecting some items that might potentially be powerful or collectible. You couldn‚Äôt get shock plans from killing a ghoul before. You had to hop and play your favorite country road playlist.
---
Just like bethesda!
---
1) Playing on PC. 
---
2) Sarij
---
3) I have screenshots to show character distance, and even the names of the other people if needed. 
---
4) I was at Harpers Ferry, with a set of buldings between me and the vendor. I was crouched and just going through my pipboy doing some inventory management, when all of a sudden I had the animation happen in the top left corner showing I had the perk card "Ricochet" proc(take effect). Not only do I have this card not equipped, but I actually dont even have the card available to be equipped lol. So seeing the animation come up a second time shortly after the first one(couple seconds) really struck me as strange! At this point im thinking "maybe there is something bugging/glitching out and its giving me perks that other people are sharing in their teams?", so I checked the map and see that there are 2 guys leveling/running around me and killing stuff. I take a screenshot instantly just so I will have it and can judge the distance and do testing myself, and right after i hit print screen to take the screen shot, the animation popped up one last time. I wasnt sure if maybe people were abusing something this early after todays update, so to be safe I went ahead and took screenshots while hovering over the other two people to get their names. If you need the screenshots just let me know and I'll post them asap.   
---
This all just happened maybe 5 minutes before I typed this up, so I dont have much in terms of specifics, but Im going to get together with some friends and test this and see if I can replicate it at all. After a big update like this is some of the most vulnerable time for bugs/glitches, and if I can possibly help catch something, regardless of severity, I'll chalk it up as a win lol.   
---
If there is anything I was unclear about, or you need more information about, dont hesitate to reply and ask! :) 
---
100c
---
OR what if you could buy a respec with Atoms?
---
Please Bethesda, if I could make #*one* change, it would be to increase this by many factors or remove it entirely. The limit can stay at 25000, preventing anyone being rich, but it stops me having to do my daily chore of touring the 7 vendors...
---
Promissory note of possible content?
---
Since the December patches BGS has been pretty on top of communicated updates and such, and have been pretty spot on with the times of their patch releases, and when they hope to have them out. 
---
You implying that we may or may not get new content despite BGS saying so or being unsatisfied with the content release schedule is fucking dumb.
---
The games been out what? 3 months? Oh God! Why haven't we had full expansions yet! Full DLCs! They should have been out already!
---
Not to mention, if BGS had released new content in the first few weeks, internet cry baby panIes like you would have gone ape shit. " See! PROOF THE GAME WASNT FINISHED! THIS ISNT NEW CONTENT ITS LAUNCH CONTENT THEY JUST HELD OFF, LETS BURN AN EFFIGY OF TODD HOWARD!"
---
OH BOY! Here we go!

Try marine armor with +25 radiation resistance as a legendary then add lead lined mods to all. Might give you a chance
---
Brick building set is that expensive?! I‚Äôve been giving them away to people
---
Doesn't bother me. I love all of them. Didn't care that it wasn't asymmetrical anymore. Didn't care that they changed they made 4 more cinematic over rpg. And don't care what all the cheap heat youtubers are saying about a bag. 
---
This is how they have to operate with defects (bugs). Each one has an impact. Part of what determines the priority, and the steps taken, is the severity and whether there is a workaround available to customers. Based on that, they can provide solutions to other customers who ask, and let the QA and developers know how severe something is. So please dont get upset by terms like work-around. It is part of how they operate in order to do their job.
---
Melee was pretty badass anyway lol now it‚Äôs by far the best
---
I don't know ow my buddy's full stealth crits build, but I know he can drop the queen in minutes with 3 of us down there. He's doing most of the damage every time we go.
---
Yeah but explosive makes it odd. I got lucky on a few drops, my other explosive legendaries are a anti armor explosive handmade, and a laser gatling.
---
I gobble down a bit of 5.56 for the handmade, so I hear you on never having enough ammo... I dislike using the laser however... I need those fusion cores to keep my tin can house on wheels running.
---
Whatever they did screwed regular weapons as well.
---
If your over 1k pound over your max carry weight on your character you can‚Äôt pickup anything else...gotta start dropping items..
---
If that‚Äôs not your issue, then it‚Äôs just another bug..
---
Get itttttt!!! 
---
Under cut the vendors. Handmade plans apparently went up to 1.5-2k and calibrated shock plans are 5k I heard. Since plan costs increased you should be able to make a profit. 
---
Living in Detroit...
---
Thanks for clarifying this, Ladydevann!
---
Why is this post even here, let alone having reached nearly 100 thumbs up? 
---
It's incredibly vague. "Your patch screwed up more than it fixed". What? What was screwed up? What are you talking about?
---
"Shut your servers down and fix your errors". What? What errors? Wtf are you talking about?
---
"Reading issue, after issue". What issues are you talking about???
---
If someone wanted to troll Bethesda and this community, this thread would be the perfect way to do it. I honestly don't know why a mod hasn't removed this yet or why Devann even replied to it...
---
I understand that people are perplexed that bobby pins now weigh 0.1. I can understand people who have bulked aluminum and lead, and now have to unbulk it for crafting, but "20 bulk of everything" (like one guy wrote in a post)? If that's your bulk discipline, then weight obviously doesn't faze you. I can understand people who are disappointed that Demolition Expert is nerfed, because they were using an explosive build (an ambitious build that already carries an inherent weight punishment).
---
But the anger is never transformed into a well-written constructive criticism. It's all blueball teenage boy rage. You want to be "mad for a good reason"? Then write something that I will actually take seriously. If not, then if I am a snob, then you're fucking entitled.

Please read this carefully.

I've played multiplayer survival games like Fallout 76 for 10 years now.
---
**Players are MUCH more forgiving to developers when they have fun things to distract them.**  A new event, a new gun, a new dinosaur, a new building piece, it doesn't need to be whole new systems.
---
H1Z1 Just Survive DIED because they focused too hard on bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL stuff.
---
Ark is still THRIVING because they did some fixes BUT also gave the players content.
---
You win 
---
Anything that is bulked has to be unbulked right now until they fix it. 
---
I can't wait to see what you find on this patch more than others, because the evidence is stacking up that, at least for some game files, these updates were applied to a previous build. I think your community patch notes could illuminate that.
---
I had that happen to me the other night. Kept getting the message that I couldn't trade that item (on every item). Relogging fixed it for me.
---
I'm guessing that the bulked items not being usable is a side effect of preventing mods from being automatically scrapped.
---
I like my Fallout the way I like my Overwatch Cookies
---
**WITH EXTRA SALT**

Oh, you mean what moron 76 haters like to call "undisputable proof"?
---
Lockpicking is bugged now. I have all 3 equiped but only says 2 skill when i try to pick a lvl 3. Havent restarted game yet but eh ill just stop using em waste of space and time for some pre war money.

I got two when a pair of scorchbeasts decided to interrupt me while hunting a cargobot.

Plasma gun and pipe gun. Soooo fairly useless for now lol
---
Yeah sure.
---
Too bad none of mine did 800+ damage, and now they really dont üëç
---
Fair enough, though the weights and recipies have changed some since i first bulked some of it. I should probably check to see the weight loss of bulking.
---
Mutation roulette. Sounds like fun :)
---
I don't really feel like it is? Again, both are persistent online multiplayer games meant to last indefinitely...developers can't make content in a 40-60 hour work week to fill the time of some people who've put in 400+ hours already. There's just no way.
---
To address your specific call outs though:
---
**Player vending** requires an entirely separate interface though? Remaping/Developing a UI, testing what limits make sense, etc. It's not as simple as copying and pasting "vendor code". Also...they've announced this is coming so I don't understand the howling over it not being done yet.
---
**Stash size increase** is the exact kind of "small" QOL adjustments you are bitching about. A huge percentage of the positive "gifting" mentality I've encountered in this game is directly tied to Stash/Weight limitations. High levels dropping Stimpaks, excess .38 ammo, extra recipes, etc. because they *don't* have unlimited Stash space. Some limitations are okay, they don't *want* you to be able to do anything at anytime. They want you to run out of springs now and then so you have a task to gather them. I think they could have streamlined junk a bit so that there are fewer components, but I don't get how you don't put this under QOL adjustments lol
---
**New Events:** I would be fine with this as long as it is labeled, some events as-is are hard for me to solo/know if I'll be overwhelmed or not as a level 30. I would also love if I could finish Top of the World or visit the vendor up there without being set upon by a horde of level 68 super mutants, but we can't always get what we want. Level scaling like this helps high-levels have something even vaguely worth killing, but also gates lower level players out of areas entirely if a high level has so much as traipsed through...like I said, balance is hard.
---
**New Vaults/New Quests** depending on the length are what I consider to be more "DLC" or "Major Content Patch" territory. Vaults especially seem to me to be more like opening Onyxia's Lair, opening Ahn'Qiraj, etc. New quests I would just rather they introduce a new region as a major "DLC" with accompanying quests. They could maybe do what many MMO's have done and implement more concrete/less silly "dailies" tied to in-game rewards rather than atoms.
---
Not saying I wouldn't like more content, just trying be realistic.
---
/2cents
---
I didn't think anyone over level 44 was ever able to get it, but that could be a lot of failed RNG.
---
Dude you just made assumptions. Lol what an ass. 
---
Oh well that‚Äôs sucks. In more ways than 1
---
For pvp sure but tbh there isn‚Äôt anything really that dangerous that you have to run about in full alpha form, sure it takes longer but it‚Äôs not like the melee mechanic is amazing, I just end up blindly swinging most of the time 
---
Too much time spent in whiteboard meetings and around the water cooler, fact!
---
To craft ammo today, I had to manually break down my bulks at a crafting table
---
in relative terms, melee can still easily obtain over 1k damage per swing without all that much effort thanks to massive synnergies for low health builds and items that make it easy to achieve crazy high STR.  
---
So basically, there was a time when ranged and melee where in some sort of parity as both could achieve these 1k+ damage per shot figures, and now it's melee alone that can achieve this easily.  
---
Personally I think it's a bit kneejerky to say the game is "ruined" for ranged.  Rather, the game now more or less forces ranged + stealth, as you now pretty much need that 2.5 - 3.5x sneak multiplier to deal relevant damage.
---
This is UNDENIABLY the BEST UPDATE fallout 76 EVER HAD!
---
Polish a turd it's still a turd.
---
It's nice that they continue to update the game but it never should have released as it was in the first place. It was nothing more than a full priced early access game. 
---
When we say explosives we mean grenades (thrown or launched) and missiles. Not cheaty legendary prefix. Those (non legendary) were ok but not game breaking in the least. Now they aren't worth the dozen shots you get before th ed weapon breaks (with 5 ranks of weaponsmith).
---
The nerf was aimed at TSE, which I only have 2 and think needed it. A straight reduction in TSE or flat removal of explosive as a modifier would have been fine. Leaving it in the game means a blanket nerf to grenades and missiles. Now basically lame except to tag with molotov. 
---
At the end of the day I don't care so much about the amount of rounds used, but more so the fact that a 15 minutes encounter with a group of mobs completely destroyed a 200% repaired weapon. 
---
As a maxed rifle build, adrenal and a set of unyielding sentinel on my alt i hit for 280 on a tse hand made. Thats 2 bullets to down an enemy without adrenline lvl 5 kicking in or pyscho. The purpose of ranged doing less damage than meele was the risk reward trade off. I can still 2 shot or even one shot most enemies quicker than any meele build could fathom. I havent tested the quad explosive on my main yet , but i imagine the same results- better sustained kills and likely similar dps in a sbq encounter with the added benefit of ranged and safety.  To say youd quit over a nerf is over dramatic. The meta for video game changes all the time in many different games. 
---
What's so good about the jetpack?
---
I have a TSE shotty that did 1108 damage but now it does around 350 still amazing only downside is now I need more bullets
---
Do you run a second Bethesda account on the other one? Or the same account.
---
Bethesda leadership needs to go. Without that change, this studio is a dying has been. Can you really believe that another game, in or after 2020, on THIS engine, is going to waltz into E3 and not get literally laughed at beside the competition? 
---
And then there are incidents like today. 
---
Whoever is in charge needs to step back. Maybe not be fired. But they need to step back into a learning role and let a more competent leader take charge. Because this studio has no future outside of publisher other peoples games otherwise.
---
That wendigo quest for raider rose is coming up soon. Not looking forward to doing it solo ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
They could have had the decency to reduce card ranks from 5 to 3 to make it less of a slap in the face.
---
Guess I'm moving points out of Int and into something else now. Shame, I always love grenades and explosives, especially in Fallout games.

It's almost like they hate people who don't use PA. Not a damn thing was wrong with White Knight.
---
You CAN buy the handmade plans, found it at Watoga Bot, I'm level 69
---
It‚Äôs more efficient for transport and space in your stash. The point is it makes no sense. They already said it was a bug from the patch.
---
I just upvote everything, anything else seems spiteful.
---
its called Overseer's log - Nuke Launch
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **10th Cakeday** kingoftown! ^(hug)
---
And when you mix PVE and PVP players and force them to play together.
---
TBH, hopefully there will never be another Obama.
---
I have indeed noticed mutes have caps. Good reminder, though. Still, cap limits just don't feel right. It's an obvious mechanic working against the player. 
---
It's never made sense in bethesda games to me that the homie is selling stuff that costs so much but doesn't have enough to buy half my stuff at ridculous rates. 
---
My genre is post-apocalyptic exploration.  In other words: \*Fallout\* .
---
My tooltip damage was exactly this.  934 with my TSE leveraction on my stealth build.  It's 270 now.  The thing people do not seem to understand is that this was my second character and was the one that died a lot.  On the stealth character, if mobs got close and you shot them, you killed yourself.  If you switch to another weapon, it takes whole clips to kill anything.  So you had to play sort of strategically.  This made it fun, but yes overpowered when done correctly.
---
My other character is a all strength melee build.  He just blows up cars until the whole town comes in a pile and then kills them with a plain hammer or axe.  He can even pick up an axe off the ground and keep killing.  The weakness here is that when two scorchbeasts circle overhead and won't land.  He can't do anything about it.  So....server hop.  It's that simple.  I've never played a game when server hopping was part of the meta game.
---
Sadly, as weak as the rifle character is now, he will likely server hop away from scorchbeasts too now.
---
Every time I would server hop in Watoga I'd get +50 XP. I leveled 9 times looking for handmade plans before I hit level 45 and got leveled out. 
---
You've made nonsensical comparisons again. A latte not looking like the picture in no way changes the flavor. You've exaggerated it to be a different item. That is wrong and you should know that.
---
It is slight. 30%. That's nothing like losing a CAMP or having your build budget consumed in bugged items, expensive mods being scrapped, etc in any way **not to mention mitigated by other perks**.
---
This isn't switching products, this isn't changing the game, this isn't a scrapped mod. Try playing the actual game and report back how deeply impacted you are by this change. I haven't even used white knight in a while.
---
Well said.
---
Yeah I'm about to quit playing today. I'll wait for some new content.
---
that means we need a party searching tool other than random invites.
---
it means we need a way to find people to do a specific quest (some mmo's have a gathering point in front of a dungeon, you can search pub party there, even with combat roles sometimes !!)
---
it also means we would need a CHATBOX with global/trade/party/team/area/local channels
---
it would also mean having a purpose for partying, as most people just solo (as do i, for the lack of friends with enough confidence to buy this game,)
---
i would encourage it, absolutely, but seeing how bethesda takes up and executes things in the game, we probably end up with some trashed up re-used content modified for coop.
---
i can imagine they would even fabricate quests where its nearly impossible to do a specific task as a solo player so ruining their experience with it, but hey.. cant think about two things at once here..
---
but without a good system, which most games take as basic stuff, this will never happen...
---
and building a chat box in a game is over their skills... you need modders for that.. and yeah mods.. lets stop there... 
---
Actually had this happen once.  Took advantage and tagged legendaries as they came out and then got shredded.  Didn't get anything good though.  Never have in 120+ levels over two characters..
---
Same. Got 5. Now this one is my 2nd highest and is going to take serious perk movement to he able to use again meaningfully. And I was not a TSE junky. Grenade and missiles with pistol backup.
---
At rank 3, armor degraded 90% slower and repairs cost like 1/4th the mats. I haven't had to repair anything since because my armor never broke again (combined with 1x Lucky Break).
---
Now it's been nerfed to 60% (so armor will degrade 4x faster than before). I don't know what the new repair ratio is. I'll probably need to upgrade Lucky Break to rank 2 or 3 now.
---
Neither
---
They patched an older version of the game. 
---
So lots of bugs are back, and I guess exploits and heavy bobby pins. And now your bulk junk won't scrap 
---
I've migrated to melee from primary shotgun it's pretty great.
---
Yup with the cap bobblehead and cap collector maxed I found more then one caps container with only a single cap. "Searching" only gave me 19 more in one and zero in another
---
I'm kinda confused as to what that means.
---
Its the phantom device, stronger than a stealthboy 
---
I was just on a server that killed the queen in about 30 seconds.
---
Its not about bobby pins its that Bugthesda rolls back fixes. What if they rolled back duping? 
---
It looks like either you got your mutations from serums and they've worn off, or you don't currently have your Class Freak cards installed.
---
Better idea than mine. This would work
---
So were you aware that your previous statement was wrong when you hit post? Clearly the issue at hand was the bulked material that does save space. My question is whether or not the change is a bug or feature. It‚Äôs dumb to take away the auto dismantle feature because it is nice to be able to save stash space and not have to break the bulked stuff down every time you need more material. There is no reason to change that. 
---
I'm probably going to get hate, but I think I'd pay to re-assign special points tbh
---
have to shoot things 3 times now instead of once ...
---
The direction this is starting to go it wouldn't surprise me if they short sold their own stock.
---
The Fallout title already had a huge fan base and they seem to be pissing their existing base off in some desperate attempt to steal market share from Fortnite.
---
It usually ends badly for companies who choose to follow instead of lead in what they excel at.
---
I see where you are getting at, but that small change would take away an integral part of fallout
---
I'm thinking that must still be somewhat random, I found sturdy combat legs or arms there and the other superduper mart.  
---
My vampire rolling pin is now the bomb lmao ...  at least they seemed to fix the health regeneration.  
---
If you get it on pc xbox and ps as well as buying Skyrim in VR you may even have no crashes. Also sacrifice a goat or some poultry to Todd Howard and Pete Hines before booting up for the first time üëç
---
Yup noticed this today. Very awesome stuff. Stealth rifle crit builds avoiding the nerf hammer. Everyone is so mad and I am still having the time of my life. Lol
---
You know, I ran across mannequins in the road the other day that I swear were not there...
---
But this is an experiment. Bethesda is trying to learn just how little real effort they have to put into a Minimum Viable Product in order to continue making money from it.
---
Even emptying alt of stuff it didn't work it's weird that I can still pick up world items
---
Hey all, we spoke with the dev team about this for their reasoning behind the changes to Plan/Recipe prices, and have updated the patch notes with some more details:
---
- **(Added Jan 29)** Since many Plans and Recipes can now be sourced reliably from Vendors, we've also increased their Cap costs accordingly.
---
- **(Added Jan 29) Dev Note:** Recipe and Plan prices were originally based on the rarity of showing up in a Vendor‚Äôs inventory. Guaranteeing their appearance significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes and we‚Äôve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others‚Äô equipment for a cheaper price.
---
Yup, this is one I reported for that mod as well. Might try closing the game out completely before switching characters, that fixed the mod temporarily....be funny if the same fix works here.
---
That is why I always make my way to an area by discovering new locations to respawn at if I die
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
First big smile and laugh of the day my friend.
---
You win reddit for today.  Everyone else can stop trying now.....lol
---
This is how you artificially extend play time in a game with no real late game content...
---
&gt; I stripped naked, injected myself with drugs (never done so before) and wailed on her with a piece of concrete on a stick. 
---
Now thats funny, but you are correct.  Its been that way unless you had a TSE, this whole game is unbalanced.  NPC's are gods.  Fire once and most if not all of they run right at you.  But with the same perks and my  melee  weapon I can walk right up to them and kill them.  Me and my friends have moved on for the most part.  
---
Actually you are wrong the nerf is good because of the PVP and if you want to do damage to scorched get a + Scorched damage that's the point
---
There's a random event that spawns a vendor bot that has a unique inventory to others... He's not rare but some have terrible finding him.
---
Bulk everything just to have space available. Why would they add this, I never saw anyone complain about it. 
---
Deep breaths. In the end, it's just a videogame.
---
This isn't an exploit at all,  not even clever use of game mechanics, guy is literally just wearing armor, perks, and shooting people. Yes it's not balanced, but it isn't an exploit like duping and passing through walls. Next time ignore the guy, then change servers.
---
I've only seen explosive vents and rusty knuckles. Does Ultracite have a full selection of mods?
---
Are you sure? I did find this.
---
The Elder Scrolls Online¬†is a¬†massively multiplayer online role-playing¬†(MMORPG)¬†video game¬†developed by¬†ZeniMax Online Studios¬†and published by¬†Bethesda Softworks.[1][2]¬†It was released for¬†Microsoft Windows¬†and¬†OS X¬†in April 2014.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online
---
My understanding is that ZeniMax owns Bethesda. Also on the ESO game case the Bethesda logo is on it.  Which leads me to believe that Bethesda had in some way, shape, or form their hand in creating ESO .
---
If my opinion is incorrect let me know but there's no reason to downvote something that you don't agree with
---
On every other multiplayer sandbox game I‚Äôve played that supports private servers, you have a character per server, not one you can take anywhere. This becomes especially necessary with mods, otherwise you could build an effortless XP / legendary farm on one server, max out your character there, then have a huge advantage on a vanilla server.
---
Does that not still only last 60 seconds or so and also still leave the chameleon effect? Still visible though transparent and blurred? This guy was straight invisible, no name no anything, I only noticed him because of VATS.

Yeah, they have successfully killed this game for me. 
---
Hi everyone, we met up with the dev team about this today to learn more about their reasoning behind the changes to Plan/Recipe prices, and have updated the patch notes with some more details:
---
I delved in enough to confirm that I have even less interest in PVP in a *Fallout* game than I do in any other sandbox exploration PVE game.
---
You can TSE me in the head if you like, I've stopped travelling with junk anyway and I'm passive.
---
But are these really enough problems to ruin someones day? I mean you can scrap all of your bulk junk and use it as normal. Bobby pins to heavy just drop some you find them everywhere? 
---
Yeah most guns being shit is pretty bad. The worst part is some of the biggest offenders not only do piss poor dps, their ammo is hard to craft and they literally break after 2 minutes. WTF IS GOING ON.
---
I know its harsh. But its time. It really is. 
---
Ya but at the cost of being boring as fuck to use and never needing to loot, mine, etc. to maintain.
---
I've deleted my melee characters because they were not fun to play at all.
---
are you pretending that 3 months is a long time for live service? destiny had their first expansion in 3 months. fallout 3 had dlc within 3 months and that was a complete non-live service. fallout 4 had dlc within 4 months and that was also not a live service game.   
---
76 is even worse because it was shipped clearly incomplete with the promise that they would add more and fix it...........
---
Can someone please dm me when they fix whatever automatically boots you off the server every 15 mins? Tired of reading about stability improvements only to burn another 15 and putting the game back to gather dust
---
sweet
---
I run mods now on pc that work with the online game and would assume any mods that are added would have to work as well.  I just don‚Äôt see how this becomes an offline game. Fo4 is the offline version of this.
---
He obviously won‚Äôt get it because there‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúget‚Äù. Your post has less content than the game itself.
---
Or you can play with what you enjoy because what you use will still gets the content done. They didn't buff the content to compensate for the OP weapons.
---
My apologies, try again.
---
That cost us money with no refunds available for failing to deliver what was advertised.
---
I was having genuine fun with the game, just the other day. I really was.
---
But it wore off after a few hours. Because I realized that late game is just survival for its own sake. Exploration ceases to mean anything, because there is nothing new to find. Just the same weapons and gear over and over. 
---
And while I love the lack of NPC's and interactions - and the lonely atmosphere it creates - it also means no interesting decisions or consequences to be made in the wasteland. And that makes late game feel hollow and pointless.
---
And now, they do this. To an already bored player on a 21:9 monitor...
---
Honestly, I may be done. I might come back. Might. But I well might not, too.

Can vats not target ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô targets full stop
---
I do not want to target my friendly neighbourhood census taker. i want to target the scorched eating his face off
---
I'm just mad my demolition man build got nerfed because of the TSE. My heavy weapon explosives and grenades are hard to find ammo for expensive to make and don't do as much damage or as quickly and a normal rifle even before the demo perk nerf. I just want Daisy (Daisycutter) to do big booms again =(
---
Holy crap i never knew that in my hundreds of hours playing this wretched excuse for an mmorpg.. 
---
Apparently fallout 76 does.
---
Cool, thanks for the adjustment, just happy to see communication and clarity. ^^
---
I like to grind. It‚Äôs why I play games like warframe
---
I've server hopped since day 1 still one calibrated shock no jetpack 
---
You should check out this cool website I found. It has all the answers about things like this!
---
google.com
---
WoW had an incomparable amount of content at release. the closest comparisons to this are destiny and fallout 3/4. all of which had dlc within 3-4 months
---
Or keep being butthurt. Whatever floats your boat.
---
Why would i waste my caps on an anti scorched item that only helps vs scorched when i can have a good weapon that helps with everything instead? 
---
Any Help to make a Medic/Non-automatic Rifle Character
---
Sad but true.
---
Lol melee build era has been here all the time
---
I love it especially when they sit there shooting and i just smash em with melee as they reload. Haha stupid clips. 
---
Nobody plays PvP though????
---
That's so cute. I can one shot them with a sniper rifleman build and VATS headshots, or take them down in three seconds with a pistols VATS critical build. 
---
I do actually, must check my others see what kind of correlation i find
---
Good to know thanks for the reply. 
---
Haven‚Äôt played in months due to bugs and I‚Äôm not going back until something happens no regrets
---
I can understand where the OP is coming from. TSE hurt people, the game, and the economy. White Knight was a QoL perk that made that smidge of Ballistic Fiber you had last longer. In my opinion, I think there‚Äôs a million other things that should of been changed/nerfed instead of this perk.
---
i made a character to solely use pipe weapons because of that card giving a durability advantage to a pipe weapon, now im off to farm a hunting rifle and semi auto AR because why use a weaker weapon if it has the same durability
---
I'm sure the next nerf will be:
---
Armor now has 50% lower durability and damage resists.  We call it the "Swiss Cheese Nerf".
---
Pretty soon it'll be easier to play running around naked hitting things with your bare fist.   At least you don't have to spend half your play experience farming then :)
---
How is this even acceptable at this point of time, 2 months after a full release??
---
Bethesda used to be so good.
---
That apathetic attitude is exactly why / how gaming companies are getting away with this kind of shit.
---
Ayy
---
I knew mentants
---
Recipe is tagged unknown at modus, havent checked if I can still craft yet...
---
Lord knows I don't envy them as this is really a no win situation. There is nothing Bethesda can do that will make everyone happy.
---
Tuna Spicy Enchilada
---
Still server hopping for X-01 stuff still.
---
Lots of folks leaving the game, servers may stabilise:-)
---
Do modifiers against scorched apply to Scorch Beasts and Queens?
---
Yes but each time you level up. I'm already level 134, i've done everything there is to do in the game. Very hard to force myself to grind 50 more levels...
---
Lol so now balancing a game is a big no no
---
Just got to do 1500 plus your carry weight at a time
---
You guys might as well have just taken the Two shot and explosive weapons out of the damn game. You changed both of them to 25%, that's actually stupid.
---
It was the only defense against the bullet sponges that roam Appalachia. I don't care how mutated it is, if I shoot a humanoid in the head, it should die, or at least be out of the fight, not shrug it off like a hard shove.
---
Also, increase player cap above 25000. That's now enough for like five plans if you've farmed and saved for weeks for it.
---
The point of the flooding is to make sure Bethesda, who is attentive around here, has a head count of who shares this opinion.
---
Good question. I got jetpack for x01 a long time ago. Never used it though, just sits in my stash. I'd rather use the +2 str mod.
---
I've been using the Auto Grenade Launcher for a long time now, situationaly it was pretty alright, now... can barely kill a group of muties and breaks in 2 minutes... 
---
I stored it hoping one day it get's buffed or better yet "fixed" but I ain't holding my breath.
---
Your talents are wasted here.  You need to be crafting way too long, unintentionally hilarious Yelp reviews.  
---
Sorry is happening to you. If ya find a fix please post here! I'll do the same. 
---
Just checked. Can confirm it
---
I've played stealth melee since release, however haven't had a chance to PvP since the patch. However, the detection aspect, as far as I know works hand in hand with Perception. If you have a high perception, you will notice someone in your vicinity if they have low to medium agility. It's a Perception versus opponents agility check. Thus, if you have low perception, you won't notice someone crouched with high agility even if they were right in front of you. If my understanding is skewed, by all means, please articulate.

I haven't but this guy did in 5mins

Defo, I just sever hop when these dick heads camp out at the back.
---
Most random people I‚Äôve met in this game have been super helpful and very kind. Many were just looking for ways to work together. Why not set the game up where people can take on certain quests that benefit the group or communities? That would be the Fallout experience!
---
Most servers I log on don‚Äôt have nukes launched. Why do we need to kill each other for random junk we might or might not need instead of killing the queen and loot the good stuff from the area?

I've played FO76 a ton, level 135. I rarely have encountered much PvP, i barely encounter players to begin with. I go to events and no one joins, the only time is at Uranium Fever or during a Nuke. This is the loneliest multiplayer game I've played. 
---
Meter went from hidden to danger for no apparent reason.
---
FT to camp, none of the 'no FT blah blah enemies nearby'.
---
Spawn at camp, still shows danger. No enemies to be seen anywhere, not even a stray molerat.
---
FT to Whitesprings, enter interior cell, still danger.
---
Had to server hop to get rid of it.
---
Log out immediately after. Enough frustration for one day. 
---
Yeah its more fun that way. 
---
turns out it was "save my stuff" mod, deleted that, problem solved
---
Lol!!!
---
How much crossover is there between people who bought Fallout 76 and people who buy Kingdom Hearts 3? I've played all the Bethesda games since Fallout 3 and I have 0 interest in playing Kingdom Hearts or Final Fantasy.
---
Good
---
How did you get the outfit?
---
My bank alt isn't sitting at crazy weight.  I think 75% stash full and 25% player full.
---
Transferring items is too much of a pain in the ass.....lol
---
I still don't get the players that are always overloaded and can't sprint.  I love my marsupial and speed demon too much :)
---
Blah blah redditor #347 to post about hating the nerf today. 
---
destiny had it in 3 months, fallout 3 had dlc within 3 months
---
Yep looks like something is messing up with the mod "Save my stuff" after disabling that from the custom ini (removing its line) i can now sell items.
---
Looks like a running theory is that at least part of the codebase the patch was applied to was older than last patch. You already know about bobby pins.
---
It seems a duping exploit that was patched is unpatched.
---
Mutations may be bugged like before the last patch.
---
The favorites wheel empties out every time you log in.
---
There's a thread I can't find now that had a couple more old bugs mentioned but I don't remember what they were. I'll keep looking.
---
Some people are unsure if the price increase of plans to x4 the previous cost is intentional or a bug since it isn't covered in the patch notes. This doesn't have anything to do with old vs new code but it's something I've seen come up a bunch.
---
One that I've seen is that my carry weight keeps fluctuating in odd ways. I can't tell any reason why, but my carry weight will go from 380-390 without eating anything. Sometimes when I'm transferring items it'll show my carry weight as some random number between the two, like 383 or 387.
---
I really did think that was what the game was going to be. 
---
Everyone keeps saying TSE.
---
What about all of the guns that weren't TSE?
---
Sorry but I don't have any sympathy for anyone effected by Nerfs at this point. Myself and others complained for the last 2 weeks when they came to take our non TSE guns and people like the OP didn't care. Now he is butt hurt because he got nerfed?.......cry me a river pal!
---
Same here bro, just hit level 50 and got an auto launcher last night.
---
Have been barely scratching the glowing gulpers at my camp with my M79 at +100% bonus. I'm posted at the Dyer Chemical aluminum node.
---
Guess I'm going to have to move.
---
Also, wtf is with the health pool and regeneration on glowing gulpers? It's bullshit. They have scorchbeast level health, apparently no armor to even penetrate, and regenerate almost as fast as you can damage them.
---
Strongest enemy in the game apparently.
---
What an analogy. 
---
You're missing out, ignoring the bugs, it's loads of fun really.
---
Almost 8 k. Caps
---
Yes, all but Jetpack
---
Take that dupers!
---
How much for the instigating pump action shottie?
---
Because not random now? Im very surprised they are there though. Figured that one thing would remain queen loot.
---
They say they are leaving the game but I don‚Äôt think half will because when the game first came out some people that I know on here and you tube would be all on the hate train never going to play want my money back , were all playing every time I was in it seemed . 
---
Over level 44...what about under level 44?
---
When are people going to stop announcing online when they decide to stop playing a game? 
---
Dear Bethesda, a pvp stand-alone mode isn‚Äôt content, and I really hope you don‚Äôt try rationalizing it as so.
---
You never get kill for someone who just wanna shot because yes with a TSE. Dude that's happen a lot the worst is when you dont wanna do PVP with anyone
---
Thank you, appreciate the thoughts. I don't use One Drive but will check settings in a sec. I like your path comment as I don't use the default to C; install has always been on my E drive (higher capacity SSD). That's a variable and maybe that's the issue; I'll reinstall to C to see what happens.
---
Tell me how you really feel.
---
Yeah i don't get some of the nerfs, seems like the root of a lot of these changes was to give a notch down to dupers and exploiters. But other players who have played legitimately got screwed too
---
We found the thing they didn't Nerf.
---
Still killing them pretty easily with explosive heavy weapons using Tenderizer, Glow Sight, Bloody Mess, Adrenaline, and Stablized. It‚Äôs not as fast as it was, but hell if I‚Äôm having any problems. 
---
ok 
---
Sounds like a unintended bug to me.
---
Just as a reference of any PC players; If LoL staff was to revert to a patch from 2 years ago people would've started a petition and Riots reputation would be even more tarnished. This isn't balancing; it seems like incompetency and laziness.
---
750. With shotgun build, that should be a 1 hit killer for most things
---
TSE nerf was inevitable. Why on earth would they want people to be able to one shot everything. Obviously melee is still broken, but one shot weapons were never going to stay.
---
Bad
---
No. Bethesda seems dead set on their course, no matter what the fan reaction is.
---
It's painful. You turn on the rad shower, you look at it, then you force yourself through... Glance at the corner of the screen... A mutation had been cured... Is it the one you want to get rid of? Nope. It was marsupial. Again.
---
I understand, completely. It also seems you‚Äôre getting downvoted because you‚Äôre not complaining about the patch, so you might want to add an edit with something relevant to the ongoing bitching.
---
God modern games sucks. I remember getting Mario 3 for my nintendo and, get this, it was a complete game! No downloads, no microtransactions, no game breaking bugs that caused the system to crash. Idk, maybe it is too idealistic to ask for that now given the scope and size of new games. Perhaps you really can't go home again.
---
Your understanding is accurate, and not new by any means. This has been the case since launch, only now it should affect direct line of sight as well. My point is that in making this change, in favor of PvP encounters, it seems to have affected stealth in PvE aspects of the game. I don't remember ever sniping enemies from a large distance to be instantly put in Danger and have my sneak multipliers nullified before - not unless I was discovered at least. It seems to me that in a short bit of playing post-update thus far, this keeps happening with both Yao Guais, Super Mutants, Deathclaws and Scorchbeasts (what I've tested thus far). I wanna stress that it's not 100% of the time. It seems to happen quite often however, prompting them to patrol the area or shoot in random directions as they ordinarily would when they are searching for you during Caution, yet it skips straight to Danger whether they actually found you or not. All this does is make it hard to figure out if they *actually* found you or not, as well as negate the sneak multiplier, but as that's a pretty big deal and seemingly happening randomly right now, it makes stealth a bit... Odd, at the minute.
---
Essentially it seems that the change to PvP line of sight has made either stealth or enemies attacked from stealth act a bit out of the ordinary.
---
\+karma
---
Any word on when I'll be able to complete Overseers Message?
---
We need dungeons and raids. Missing those wonderful mmo mechanics is letting a potentially great game go wasted.
---
1.25 Shot...
---
Was just about to say this. I have that perk. 0.1 in inventory and then 1.0 in stash.
---
Hmm was the crit builds nerfed too? Don't crit half as often as pre-patch...
---
Given the amount they must have invested in this game you have to wonder if they're talking about hiring on emergency crews to try and fix it.
---
Cause damn.
---
Have you seen any selling the BOS combat armor? I know I bought one piece at a vendor before the patch but haven‚Äôt seen it at any of the vendors I‚Äôve checked so far. 
---
I wouldn't mind less ATOMIC SHOP BS if it meant the game WORKED as intended. PLZ someone from Bethesda read this and then help the rest of the team out from under a rock.
---
Announce it then leave?
---
Let's put out an APB for your sense of humor, it seems to be missing...
---
Yeah, I'm with you. Yes HEAR ME LOUD AND CLEAR (for the crybabies who couldn't get a tse) a nerf was needed, yes I agree, but it's not a viable option anymore, my lever action rifle went from 812 (yes that's too much) to 234, that's with all associated perks. A non legendary plan Jane, walk up to a work bench and card it lever rifle does something like 150, so my 9 points for all the rifleman perks, my 5 points for the demo expert perk and 3 stars of legendary is only worth an additional 80 damage. How is that even close to fair or reasonable. Bloodied melee builds for everyone I guess.
---
I'm about to quit as well unless i see some radical changes VERY soon. I poured in about 150 hours into this game, but at one point, enough is enough.
---
I think a lvl 2 or 3 should just become a lower lvl temporarily and fit into lower lvl slots.
---
For instance, I have a lvl 3 *and* 2 Power Patcher card that i need to carry around depending upon whether I need to make weight with Batteries Included or not. It's silly.
---
Puss
---
Nice, a lot better than when mine was in the heap
---
?
---
"Useless" just because you can't kill things in one or two shots? Ridiculous. A "basic mirelurk queen" is supposed to be a tough enemy and not go down easily. The weapons were over powered and you were basically playing the game on very easy
---
Could you hold onto it? I need to build up that many or I could offer some trades if you‚Äôre interested 
---
Play on Xbox One
---
Tag is ChippyDippy64 
---
When we defeated the scorchbeast queen, the loot took a while to load, I got distracted by other enemies and killed them, the loot from the queen had disappeared and i never got it back.
---
 The queen despawned quickly after.
---
Basically, the loot despawned when I fought other enemies.
---
Yeah it would have been nice to have that confirmed, but oh well. I'm glad to have plan RNG behind us!
---
Xbox one - level 62 - bulk items in stash box no longer repair guns ???  You have to put them in your inventory as unbulked ...  seems highly in convenient .  Bug or feature ? 
---
Agreed, this perk was the only good reason to use regular armor.
---
As I already responded to another guy, the idea behind fallout is that stuff like farming for junk to repair your armor should be a thing at low levels, but as you progress and level up these aspects of the game become mitigated by unlocking new perks. White knight for me rewards the player with not having to farm for junk to repairs so often. 
---
It doesn't make sense to me that at level 86 I must continue to maintain my armor the same way as a level 30. I dont need to wait to see how this will affect the game, its kind of predictable how it endorses more farming.
---
Where is the player vending? T.T It was supposed to be here. It woulda given us something to do..
---
Cap Collector:¬†Now requires players to search caps stashes, much like other perks that grant a search option for containers.
---
Can all those kind of perks be auto please? 
---
Seems long winded to have to actively select that option.
---
If one were to save those into the right folder, would they appear as our load screens too?
---
Seems bugged to me.  Its like suppressor muzzle is pointless, once you get one shot you go into caution regardless of everything else.  And it takes forever to drop back to hidden...This is PvE only, no clue on PvP.
---
Enjoy that level grind to move 15 points into STR
---
If you want a minimal movement build, go fists. It only has one perk card to L3
---
**important disclaimer**: You cannot use fist weapons in power armor
---
For the recipe?
---
I just gun bash them to death but my gun stock is a legendary hunter with +2 bash it's great 
---
Yeah, I can hold onto it
---
&gt; from scratch
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
S'all good!  Happy Gaming!
---
Thanks so much üôè
---
The same people would be complaining that they should be fixing bugs before adding content, because the bugs interferes with their experience of the new content.
---
im sorry, dang. they just made legendaries useless. i can get a non legendary pistol to do that damage :(
---
Try Grafton Station
---
Got both bird bones and marsupial back very quickly. I also got healing factor, unstable isotope, scaly skin and the other mutations doing fire damage to melee attackers. I stopped there. Dont want anything like empath to screw it up. Gonna waste another 4000 caps on a speed demon serum. 
---
I can one shot enemies with the All Rise with no melee perks as that was my secondary weapon.
---
With all respect, I don't think the main issue is the lack of new content because the game has a ton of it, but the actual reason is that a lot of that content is not rewarding. I'm level 102 and have not even done half of the events because most of them are way too long for just 7 stimpacks and 83 5mm rounds. I don't feel like exploring anymore because I already know I won't find anything better that farming the Whitespring and is also extremely frustrating to be switching picklock 7 times when exploring a new town. So as a quick tip in my humble opinion to make the game feel a little better while the new content is finished is to just bumb up a little the rewards or even better make them a little more CONSISTENT, so that you have a motivation to actually do them. :) hope this helps
---
The good news is just think about how many more hours you can play Fallout 76 farming for ammo. 
---
all this did was require you to spend time doing chores to repair your armor
---
THIS IS NOT **FUN**
---
THIS IS NOT A DESIRABLE WAY TO INCREASE PLAY TIME. THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR CONTENT. STOP IT BETHESDA
---
When? I call bs
---
Minigun from 162 to.. 32. Yup. Done. 
---
It's the Camden Park bot. He's got em. 
---
The Camden Park Merchant has the excavator armor mod plans.
---
It's eye-roll inducing whenever people from this sub say shit when they clearly don't understand anything whatsoever about software development or game development.
---
Armchair devs on reddit *telling* a developer what to do. Not just suggesting, but saying "**SOLUTION**: DO THIS NOW". 
---
Jesus christ.
---
This day is a very sad day, indeed.
---
oh my gawwwwwwd, you have no idea how glacially slow they "fix" this game. Huge two-week build-up to this latest patch, hype and expectations that grew over 19 days of nothing... only to receive a patch that does two things, primarily:
---
1) Nerfs the only standout weapon in the entire game.
---
2) Adds a \[KNOWN\] tag to plans we already know.
---
\-\_-
---
Really.
---
THIS is the thing we're fucked off about.
---
I've never been so lucky...i get a couple tops in a standard run after nuke 
---
Too late, I didn‚Äôt have the caps to purchase it so I assume it was gone as soon as I logged off.
---
However, I‚Äôll never bypass the science lab in the enclave again! I want the marsupial and Healing Factors Recipe.
---
I think I saw the mods in Grafton.  It was the vendor bot in town in the responder center.
---
I wish this was am accident  
---
Lol, search by new posts, and scroll down 5 posts below this one
---
The usual bloody low health build with defensive perks and unyielding.
---
I'm telling you man, this is either an experiment of some sort or they are secretly invested in Outer Worlds and put out a shitty game to make customers thirsty for it. Either way, I still need to get my $80 worth out of this game so shitty patch or no shitty patch I have junk to collect and caps to mismanage for 200 more hours 
---
Xbox One X

I can‚Äôt use any of my bulked items :( I have all of my gears in bulk and it will not let me build a resource extractor because of it. I can build things that don‚Äôt require my bulked junk but it will not let me build with junk that I have bulked. For example, I have 300 steel loose that I can build with and am able to see the amount I have in the build menu, I also have 21 bulked gears that I cannot build with and cannot see the amount I have in the build menu. I have tried reloading the game multiple times, to no avail. Also my camp was duplicated 2 times after this morning‚Äôs patch. I was at over 100% Stored Budget.
---
It is January 29, 2019.
---
No support ticket at the moment.
---
Maybe we shouldn't pre-order so they don't cash in early and fix the game later. Pre-order sales &gt; expectations.
---
lol who cares
---
You'll be even more happy when the game dies then.
---
Nah. I tucked into your mom last night, tho.
---
Grafton station will sell those
---
So will vendor Greg in Grafton
---
You're asking for someone to spend time finding you good builds or posting them and then finish with 
---
"If I even decide to play again" lol.
---
Update: I logged back in and now all the items are back to the way they were before. 
---
i just got the ultracite armor 2 days ago and almost just left it behind because i thought it was an empty chassis at first
---
God you ARE young. See ya.
---
Having issues with my bulk junk items: steel,cloth, aluminum, ect. Not showing up in crafting when in bulk form have to scrap it for any crafting or repairs ......
---
Hopefully they can bury this game and we'll get a Fallout game we deserve. 
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous that you grind away to set up a certain path with all the right intentions and with this update have completely changed the path forward and now some of us will need to totally adjust.  I‚Äôve acquired weapons and mods and perks the right way but now can‚Äôt break apart my 3 or 4 or 5 cards which is totally effed up.  You just nerfed the shit out of several good features so do the right thing and allow us to reset the perks.  Or at a minimum break up the existing perks.  
---
This game needs some kind of matchmaking. Something like "Join team for: Scorchedbeast Queen, Nuked Zones, Daily Missions, Events", even if it's just the name of the server and you end up decorating your camp, it would at least help you find some people with the same goals.
---
I mean, having 20 people scattered on the server randomly doing whatever IS cool in it's own way but, there is no way in game to find people doing the same as you unless you bump into them or you're doing something as common as farming nuked Whitesprings. 
---
Thanks Obama 
---
the game is absolutely broken right now. I'm also having the same problem, plus you have to un-bulk any junk item to be able to use them in crafting and the underarmor shows through any kind of outfit. Bethesda have outdone themselves with this patch, really.
---
I was playing I heavy guns build, enjoyed it with the TSE made the build viable, now not so much. So I already have 15 points in strength :P 
---
Thanks for the idea.
---
Play a better game.
---
Since i got it just before the first dup came out to the present day. Call bs all you want.
---
I got the HUD for mine at the southern most vendor in the Ash heap and Watoga for one explosive vent and by luck another explosive vent by vendor hopping.
---
How much for instigating railway rifle?
---
pvp players werent crying because they were minmaxing for months. its the pve players who didnt have optimal armor who went to try pvp and got smoked by a pvp player then made constant threads saying that tse makes pvp suck and they never want to do it again
---
That's a flipping compliment in my book. Thanks!!
---
You're dealing with user concerns by stretching out the grind to keep players busy till content is ready. Other games exist, thankfully.
---
I regret my choice of Gauss Rifle. It seems this game really "encourages" automatic ballistic weapons and melee weapons. All nerfing TSEs did was make that more apparent. 
---
If you build your base in the right spot you can get a lot of XP from wandering mobs or pulling mobs toward your turrets.
---
I checked there but didn‚Äôt see em. That‚Äôs not where I bought mine pre patch though. I was thinking I bought it at R&amp;G station for some reason but it wasn‚Äôt there either. 
---
Balancing is fine. Its even needed in PVE games. I left Warframe because Balance is a concept with which DE are utterly unfamiliar. 
---
But this is not balancing. First, White Knight and other repair related perks WERE over performing. But only because degradation rates are stupidly frustrating. And repair costs are too high. And enemies take too many shots to kill (when hit registration even WORKS). 
---
Second, look at everything ELSE that happened. They just literally rolled the game back to a version missing critical bug fixes. That is a level of incompetence that should not be tolerated in a professional environment. 
---
The changes were needed
---
I have a quad laser pistol that breaks after before a whole mag finishes. So basically I get like 105 shots and adios.
---
Wheres my refund patch?

*laughs in 'I've been running an anti-amor build for a month now cause I saw this coming'*
---
So true . 
---
Is the explosive legendary gone for all current energy weapons, or they won't drop with the explosive legendary after the patch?  I don't know if I'm ever going back to this game since they can't seem to get the bugs under control and new content seems to be a distant reality.  If my current instigating explosive laser rifle is gone, then I definitely don't think I'll be going back.  It's a shame because I really liked the game, but now that the end game is nothing but grinding white springs I e lost interest.  And they definitely don't seem to have any concrete idea of when they'll actually do some actual new content.
---
This reminds me of people a decade ago quitting Facebook.
---
I think you‚Äôre covered now.
---
ding ding ding, we have a winner!
---
you'll get downvoted to hell but you speaketh the truth
---
Adrenaline is a perk in Agility 
---
I doubt it was the guys trading online for extremely rare sets of duped assassin's sentinel armor.
---
I'm sure they were enjoying PvP.
---
I could live without PvP and the slot machine junkies playing PvE. A nerf free offline solo edition would keep me playing.
---
They'll just sell via venmo or paypal or w/e as they've been doing.
---
These patch notes are lies.
---
Thankfully I removed mine last night. It was the only mod I've been using, but I found both Global and Trade to be too annoying.
---
What I was really hoping for was a server-specific chat, not just 100m near your character. Oh well.
---
OP, it is a good thing that it takes that long to kill them, more people get to tag enemies and it forces you into a party. A nuke zone was supposed to be a group event anyway. I think soon they will nerf melee too.
---
Hi everyone,
---
The latest weekly in-game event, which grants a little bonus HP for each team member wearing a unique Unstoppables outfit, was something we thought we‚Äôd try out as a way to give players a small bonus for playing as a team in a way that fit with the weekly theme. We hadn‚Äôt intended events like these as a way to buy power. For example, last week offered bonus health regen at night, and next week we‚Äôre planning to increase the benefits of the Well Rested buff. Additionally, the Mistress of Mystery outfit can be found in-game by completing quests, so you can still gain some benefit even if you're alone. Thanks for your feedback on this so far. We‚Äôre taking your thoughts about this event seriously as we look to implement additional events going forward.
---
I just got a medic minimum with explosives have maxed out De. Guess I'll just give her away.  They over nerfed when a buff to other weapons is seriously what was needed but more coding involved I'm sure. Now everyone is calling for a melee Nerf. They might as well Nerf everything to oblivion huh.  IDK this sub has gotten worse lately. Anyway you're right it's not good but I do love the game they just better have a plan and not an expensive One from a vendor bot either. 
---
go shoot some glowing ghouls
---
Same problem after patch, 21:9 and 90 FOV. Crosshair becomes smaller when moving. 
---
What you say is very true, I don‚Äôt stand 100% with the OP. I just think there‚Äôs a couple things that should‚Äôve be ahead of this nerf.
---
level 1 feral coming at me, 3 shots point blank, he still comin at me.
---
Mr Gutsy col level 52 3 star legendry me level 16, pumped enough shotgun shells juiced half dozen stimpack, get him down to half health, woohoo go me, WTF he has full health again!! Fk this i'm getting outta here.
---
I can kill the level 91 deathclaw in one hit with my super sledge.

 &gt; Hi everyone,
---
 &gt;The latest weekly in-game event, which grants a little bonus HP for each team member wearing a unique Unstoppables outfit, was something...
---
I find that, when someone points out that they find woooshing rude and useless, rude and useless.
---
 I never said it was a good decision only that I understand their logic behind that specific nerf. And fyi I use a TSE and said perks but there's been plenty of asshole griefers ive run across that use it too
---
I have both a legit TSE Gauss and an explosive Handmade. When I logged in for some reason I was jumped by 3 scorch beasts at the same time. I had to run into the fire station for cover, wasted a lot of rounds, popped a shit load of stims, broke my Handmade in the process and managed to kill them before they killed me. After this craziness I'm absolutely ok with the TSE nerf. It brought strategy and challenge back to the game. For me it was getting extremely boring just one shotting everything. 
---
The games a mess and most likely not play it till issues are fixed when they are I will play again and work up to the build so I have something to do. And I never asked anyone find me good builds I simply requested people to share their builds if they so wish to.
---
i was kind of hoping since everyone was mad about the 400 lb stash limit and they increased..that maybe they would do something similiar with the obvious dislike of the latest patch 
---
Nah ya just a shill and hey Bethesda gotta fuck someone up the ass, glad your volunteering champ
---
I just cant remove even one of the stack
---
THIS NERF LITERALLY MURDERED MY FAMILY AND IM QUITTING - irrational hater
---
THE NERF COMPLETELY RUINED MY GAME PLAY BUT I'M STILL GOING TO KEEP PLAYING - irrational defender
---
Dupe-orted!
---
It does ruin the fun in its entirely; yet survival multiplayer and Fallout never should have happened. You just can't balance a broken single player game to be a competitive pvp experience, and enjoyable survival by yourself. The broken concept proves true.
---
I was one hitting level 50 something mutants the other day with the All Rise.
---
And thats kinda my point. All Rise isnt an OP melee weapon but yet I can one hit high level enemies. Someone with a stronger weapon and all the needed melee perks will do some serious damage. If that is still in the game, why nerf two shot and explosive so drastically to the point of rendering them useless.
---
Its an endgame build. I grinded to get that point, things are supposed to be easier at this point. I agree the Mirelurk Queen shouldnt be one shotted, but it should not take 3 point blank shots to drop a cricket at level 48 when I one shot the other cricket with the All Rise right after.
---
I was gonna jump back in after this patch, but screw that I could afford two plans before I start farming caps.
---
How are you guys still playing this game lol
---
Obvious Bethesda spy
---
They NEED - and I do mean NEED - to roll back and remove this patch. Completely. Just roll back the game version to yesterday's version.
---
Meanwhile, we still have to inventory grind because the weight reduction perks don't operate on the damn box, only on our backs.
---
Don't forget energy and heavy weapons that practically melt in your hands.
---
Thankfully with the new patch their turrets will show who owns them, so after you level their camp you can go kill them, tea bag their corpse, and tell them what a shitbag they are over area chat.
---
Seems like they have introduced and reintroduced a lot of bugs in this patch. I‚Äôm guessing a hotfix will be along shortly
---
Update Perk Loadout Manager.
---
exactly
---
Wasting 1k rounds of 50cal to kill a scorched beast is fun though
---
It says on the main screen for me, "gain +15 maximum health for eachieving member of your team wearing a unique unstoppable outfit".   Not sure if that's what your referring to, but to me it looks like 4 teamates each wearing a outfit =+60 maximum health.
---
The removal of fun is subjective.
---
But beyond that, you are right, they were too powerful.  That doesn‚Äôt mean they needed to be nerfed to a measly 45% dmg increase when numerous other legendary combos still net dmg in the ranges of being able to clear half the whitesprings in one shot.  The issue is little to no one presented anything other than things against TSE, no one advocated for their merits or pointed out how numerous other powerful weapons exist on the same level of TSE.  You said you just got a TSE yourself... how does it feel for it to be virtually worthless now (at least worthless in the economy of other very, very powerful weapons)?  Something needed to change, but in my opinion, which I recognize is not everyone‚Äôs, the nerf they‚Äôve made is extreme.
---
Fan-fucking-tastic.
---
Think so? I was watching Anthem streams from the VIP accesses they gave out and the majority said the game wasnt that good. Up to 1 minute zone loading screens with an SSD, that's gonna be a deal breaker online and how often you encounter load screens on the game.
---
i have your problem too i can click play but it auto crash
---
i only have used 1 monitor for this game i dont have another
---
This is pretty much what I expected. The nerfs weren't so severe that it renders those weapons useless. Just more balanced now.
---
And why do we need to know this or do you need to post this here 
---
1k and I can throw in 100 railway spikes
---
Yes anything that has scorched in the name applies.
---
The usual mobs are now much smaller too, so they are balancing things a bit, reset times seem to be extended also. Should make Whitespring a more pleasant environment.
---
Marsupial does enough for me
---
Power armour should be used more often then non pa if your walking thank you should be able to take alot of damage and not die 
---
Gib more stash limit pls
---
Yeah just there a few nights ago saw 3-5 legendaries in 30+ minutes. And they all dropped 1 star gear even the 3 star ghouls. 
---
This game has some of the least bullet spongey enemies of any modern fallout game. 
---
The argument (*) where you went
---
. 
---
-----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          (*)
---
Yeah this is what I was thinking.  I was at whitesprings the other day and this guy was taking out all the ghouls with his tse before I could even touch them 
---
First suggestion; Don't make a Rifleman build. You'll just be crippling your damage output. 
---
not if you have half a dozen hotkeyed
---
Did you happen to see any golf ghouls? I'm level 75 and still need to find 10 of those.
---
Sounds great but there‚Äôs only one quest that really requires more than one person SBQ. Hell I can solo nuke a silo from memory and use like 3 stims. 
---
You'll be able to spend more time traveling to camp now since Bobby pins now weigh 10x more.......and if course all of that extra ammo you'll be lugging around for that Nerf gun.
---
Don't feel too bad.....all I've got is a crappy quad explosive radium Nerf gun so I get to carry even more ammo.
---
I don‚Äôt actively seek it either. I‚Äôm not saying the stuff is liquid gold but sometimes I have to wear random armor and store my good armor until I find more. We‚Äôre all at different stages with the game.
---
I've killed tame death claws. You're wrong.
---
A buddy with Handmade does not seem to have this issue. Not sure if .50cal specific or Heavy Weapon specific. You have anything else to test with?
---
This is the final straw for my husband and me. The only thing that made the game bearable was having a mule character.  We put up with a lot but taking away the stuff we legitimately played and got is it. We are done with the game. Thank you for the fun I had. 
---
I'm not saying they're 30 great pieces- they're 29 shitty pieces and one meh piece, with a slight chance of a decent piece.  
---
Each time a new player came to whitespring they would respawn, which made 30 legendary in 30 minutes very easy to hit. 
---
Skyrim has code from Oblivion. And functions calling out Gamebryo. ITs right there in the Creation Kit.
---
Creation is NOT a new engine. Its a rework of a tired, ancient derelict from 2000. If not before.
---
I believe so too.
---
Add batman1876 or BNTofu and they will do it for free
---
Huh I don't have a tse and yet I kill them just fine I do have a pistol that works fine though. 
---
&gt; While in fullscreen mode, if you alt-tab during a loadscreen the game resolution lowers significantly until the game is restarted
---
&gt; Changing audio device while the game is running makes all audio silent until the game is restarted
---
The fuck?
---
I hope they fix this. What happens when you're out traveling and need to fix missile turrets or repair things at locations and all your scrap is bulked but theres no stash or workbenches to break it apart. 
---
For me, the fun was gone when I got a tse lever. No challenge anymore except n ot blowing myself up. Althought the nerf is too strong, I still agree.
---
im honestly scared to see what my tse damage output has when i get home tonight..it wasnt even that powerful (10mm)..im honestly enjoying the game..appalachia is one of the best environments ive played in, and i had a lot of fun building up my character ..i think im approaching 200 hours..i never complained at all..but this patch seems to be just more nerfs..i dont understand why they would decrease white knight??? really?
---
New PvE content!!! Yes, thats exactly what most players want. Go for it Bethesda!
---
Hopefully, I switched back to my main and as soon as rad worms wore off the effects page returned to normal but the mutations aren‚Äôt in effect during gameplay.
---
You made my day with that comment
---
Sure along with 400 steel to make 2k rounds that it takes
---
Raider power armor plans can be bought at the vendor inside pleasant valley ski resort
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor and r/whyisthisathing 
---
Wtf is a robosexual
---
I have no non melee perks 
---
Im not knocking on the people who couldnt or wouldnt get a TSE weapon. Im just annoyed that I grinded my way to this endgame build only to get dropped into the primitive stage of the game again. If OP melee builds are out there, I can one shot enemies with the All Rise with no melee perks, then why get rid of explosive and two shot? Its an end game build.
---
If people are upset about getting killed by TSE weapon users in PVP, dont shoot them in the first place. PVP in this game is horrendous anyway.
---
Hmm...I was on today and had no trouble killing lvl 68 scorched earlier with my TSE  Handmade that now only does 160 dmg. Yeah it took alittle longer but still easy and to be honest, when I was 45 I used a non legendary Handmade with alittle under 100 dmg just fine. 
---
If I can edit titles I'll put +15 health, not trying to be hyberbolic. I normally don't fuss about this stuff.
---
I am still looking for the forest one myself. I have white, pink, brown, yellow, and green.

i will try, thanks mate!
---
1. Make each vendor have a separate cap pool
---
2. Increase the amount of caps they have on hand
---
3. Make the amount of caps they get from you buying stuff be 1:1
---
Wtf happen to the bunker vendor plan prices. They not 4 times as expensive now. Wtf
---
Was it intended for Bobby Pins to weigh 0.1 again?
---
Yes! And attacking robots during Whitesprings nuke makes me sad.
---
Shit my exp submachinegun went from 89 to 39. I would have preferred a dmg cap specific to each weapon rather than a percentage reduction. 
---
My really big anger point is the fact they rolled back the game version to an older buggier version.  That speaks volumes about the attention to detail and care they have, and there is no excuse for that, and this is not the first time this has happened.  There is clearly something systemically wrong over there with their development team, and I think that is a reflection of the leadership that that type of mistake gets committed at least twice now.  
---
This being a repeated failure of leadership, warrants a public confirmation, apology and clear action to fix the leadership team ultimately responsible for ensuring these types of brand damaging issues do not occur, especially REPEATEDLY. 
---
Wow you really suck dick at this game 
---
Played VIP Anthem, fresh air compared to the mess Bethesda has made so far.
---
There is no proof, the autistic group of people that has decided to let 76 live rent free in their heads are here to try to put egg on Bethesdas face again. Every patch it's the same transparent spiteful crap
---
All considered, this is true most of the time. I don't think 20% damage for Two Shot and Explosive was appropriate; due to the fact that they removed double bullets. Double the bullets meant double the explosions which is why it was broken. Almost everything else deserves a buff as well. I've used every weapon type and by god... 
---
Yes to this, all of this!!!
---
me too. got tired of wasting ammo with zip in return, so I turned the console off for the evening.
---
The people who fail to admit their 600+ damage weapon is game breaking are what kills me
---
Been saving up 11,000  caps to finally get the neon letters..  have yet to run into Graham the mutant to buy this plan, but now I'm worried its going to be even more expensive. Why even bother 
---
If the enemies weren't dumb as dirt it would definitely be more interesting to run gun builds, but it's really just more time consuming. All those mechanics don't really mean much with the current AI.
---
So, that may be how it's done where you're at, but I'm a Dev lead and I've been at a number of fortune 50 companies.including Microsoft,   and that is not how it goes as a general rule and certainly not when deadlines are approaching. Most shops are now "agile", including Beth I think. This means that dev A is going to have a task, does code for said task, does a local smoke test of task,  sets code up for delivery to their integration build, sets task to complete. Coder never sees full build most likely or at least not until he does another full get for next sprint, by which time code is already in the delivery pipeline. Should a regression test have caught it? Probably, but the dev coding the fix is not the person coding the regression test.
---
Thank you, let the downvoting/upvoting battle beging.... FIGHT!
---
I saw the same thing some guy in harpers spooked me, then trained a bunch of ghouls onto me and killed me... it sucked. Asshole also took my spare junk but whatever, assholes be asshoels and this game can now go quietly into the night after this patch. 
---
I wasnt speaking of you specifically, I meant in general. Sorry, didnt mean to sound like I was attacking you. 
---
Get in line buddy. I'm server hoping to farm ammo for my nerf gun.
---
Lol, these bugs will still be present in the next Fallout game.
---
You couldn't do that without wrecking the in game economy. Raising the process makes sense as does leaving the cap supply the same imho
---
How do you get Calibrated Shocks for Ultracite and Excavator armor?
---
My point is that you, and many others here presume that making bugs go away is a simple process and that they're not fixing bugs because it's really not important to them. 
---
Settle down Thanos.
---
Looking for a job and willing to relocate?
---
Even before the patch at higher level I could only play for about 4 hours a day before I'm just left with broken guns and no springs. 
---
Can the next patch be my money back?
---
I have this problem for all my weapons - from Gauss to Gatling, including Handmade. 
---
They are never going to fix automatic laser rifles breaking in 3 magazines... üò™
---
It's important that the economical aspects of plans and crafting are considered, and that's why it was done this way (look at any of the crafting subreddits). Not everyone needs to unlock plans. You could pay someone 1/10 of the cost of the plan to perform the service of crafting for you, and both players come out ahead for it. Before the rarity of the plan and annoyance of server-hopping kept them rare, meaning that crafting had value. Now that everyone can find the plans at any time, the plans need to be more expensive to maintain that crafting value.
---
Hopefully this will also be considered when player vending is finally introduced, whenever that comes to pass. Maybe you can find someone's shop on the map, stop by, and have this merchant RP guy build you a power armor set or something. That's the dream for me, anyway!
---
Holy shit they did it. They really did it.
---
They just rolled back to the launch version of the game, didnt they?
---
   If it's really that big of an issue just quit till next month; melee rework is definitely coming up next in terms of balance changes. There are a ton of weapons still needing balancing such a pistols, laser and plasma weapons and melee so there will be more balancing yet to come. You are playing a game that is still being worked on so expect some thing to be more OP than others only for them to eventually be fixed and balanced. The real issue was people abusing those OP things, if people didn't abuse then there would never be a reason to fix; you only brought it upon yourselves. People made builds completely relying on those overpowered combinations, abusing dupes to get ahold of them and even buying them off of ebay just to be the most overpowered possible. Karma has arrived and now you will have to play legit like the rest of the normal players that avoided those overpowered builds/weapons and soon melee will be in the same shoes.
---
I assume it pings when they're empty...
---
Slow down. Breath. We're all dead in the end. Breath. Smell the roses. Breath. Enjoy the dance. Breath. It's not the destination but the journey. Breath.
---
That having been said, the 2x sneak attack coupled with a decent silenced rifle and the entire map will be your play thing.
---
My point (*)
---
.        where you just went (*)
---
You're not good at this.
---
Yet another bugfix bites the reverted patch dust.
---
In that case, fair enough :)
---
Should be aware though that you can get one of the items in game free though as well. And last week offered a different buff, think it offered verdant increases in gathering during night time hours, not 100% sure if needed to buy anything from the store though or not on that one as didn't pay to much attention to it.
---
Oh no, your overpowered toy got balanced? Such a shame!
---
If you're using mods, update them. Better Inventory, Perk Loadout Manager, and any of the item sorting mods. Then delete Save My Stuff until the mod author updates it, it's breaking vendors.
---
Me too. I was super stoked for plan collecting. 
---
They should just port the whole land mass into FO4, along with all assets and the Ultra Wide fix, and call it a day. 
---
Because, yeah...online games, well...they suck at them. 
---
A lot of great stuff in this patch, luckily I did not use TSE too much myself. Sadly I did not see anything regarding the daily quests being bugged. For me, it's mostly in the mire. All I get there are "irrational fear", "Heart of the swamp" and the 3 enclave ones. All of those aren't even that often. Just feels silly being 200+ questing in Flatwoods mostly for events.
---
Two bugged events weren't in there as well I don't know if the devs are aware of them. The "Feral ghoul horde Ash heap" started at Monogah power substation MZ-03 will spawn the boss behind a wall. It will be at Garrahan mining headquarters. Behind a wall on the left or below the floor at the parking garage.
---
The Mr. Messenger quest located at "Big B's rest stop" will always spawn the module to start it in an unobtainable stop. Underneath the ground, it seems like.
---
There is also the charisma thing but someone mentioned it earlier I noticed. All in all, love the patch so far.
---
I went from getting a vats crit every 2nd shot to only getting one every 3rd shot. It seems previously the crit itself would help build the meter for the next crit, it is no longer doing that for me.
---
I looked at your post and you linked some really cute suggestions! I‚Äôm in love with that cute ponytail! Yeah, nothing against shaved hair (there are some badass looking ones) but my character is a vault dweller learning to survive the wastes. She‚Äôs still soft, haha. 
---
https://youtu.be/q4c6q9zeAr4
---
Cheers for that. Seems it is permanently in Grafton after the patch. But X2 the price.
---
Thanks, I guess. If they lurk as much as they let on then most of our complaints should have already been addressed directly. 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68353656
---
Sure. If the only way you found to get caps is to sell to vendor.
---
But I earned the one or two that I have. Dont be a dick neckbeard. 
---
but think about how fun it is to farm materials to repair those guns, that is probably what you log in to do
---
Which bugs pray tell? Links? Or here say? 
---
Actually, yes. Prob 50% of them were in golfer clothes and I'm a 148
---
Like... what? No it‚Äôs not. ‚ÄúLolz I should be able to kill everything with minimal effort!‚Äù
---
SM are supposed to be tough enemies. 6-7 (non-head)shots sounds appropriate for a well geared player. 
---
Melee still needs to be brought in line, though. 
---
I sure hope they nerf gun smith soon,so sick of people just walking around using that perk to keep their guns from breaking...huum hello? It's fallout 76, melee builds only...like duh!!
---
Oh no RIP....... I hope you find a new murder lizard 
---
I agree.
---
Too much too soon, too easy. Too many irresponsible kids w/TSE grieving others with OP weapons.
---
If Bethesda hadn‚Äôt nerfed them, pve pacifists would and lowbie noobs would leave too.
---
Of course all the nerf haters are gonna say that ain‚Äôt them.
---
It‚Äôs a coop game. Not doing anything about watching some overpowered overgeared bully  trash your house and gear because they were bored, makes them just as guilty and culpable.
---
Personally I think once the survival mode gets opened up, dialed in and TSE is reenabled, folks will find something else to whine about.
---
This is just my opinion, but I don‚Äôt feel you need to run Power Patcher. I only use it when I need to repair, then switch it back out. Power Armor has really impressive durability, anyway. I think you‚Äôd be better off with another 3 point perk. Also, if you‚Äôre using T-60, it‚Äôs the absolute cheapest to repair and the better overall choice.
---
They cut the explosive bobblehead bug, so I hope you enjoy slapping and having people laugh in your face.
---
Then get further away.
---
Can you imagine the reaction when they show Starfield, on THIS engine, in or after 2019 or even 2020? Its going to literally be laughed at.
---
I have a few lunchboxes and thought to include them, but since they aren't in 76...yet, I didnt want to open that lid.
---
So, did you find anything good? Iguana on a stick?
---
Scorched are the weakest enemies in the game pretty much, not really saying much tbh 
---
This, absolutely.  Now you at least know that if you put the work in and earn the cash, you can get what you want.
---
Or grind for them to drop.  That works too.
---
New content at this point would be like nuking the entire game completely.  They can't even get the core right.  This just can't be the same team responsible for Fallout 4.  
---
So admittedly you do have enough bc you aren't looking for it, and that's a good reason why they shouldn't have nerfed it? This perk was very strong when compared to other perks in the game with the bonuses that it provides. It's understandable why they did it. It hurts at first, but look on the bright side. Now the materials used will be more valuable in-game. So people like myself who have excess can unload them for caps or trade to players who don't. Also, when using Fix It Good to get the large defense bonus it puts on Armors, you used to have to wait a really long time to be able to repair and get that again. With 30% more db loss, you won't have to wait quite so long to get back to that super tanky state. I understand that situation is more of an endgame, luxury perk scenario. But like you said, we're all at different stages of the game.
---
Whine more
---
Please do.  I get the dupers (cheaters) fucked it all up but this update feels like you are penalizing everyone.  Love the game but it‚Äôs frustrating to see some of these changes.  Thanks for listening 
---
Then start attack from a further distance away.
---
It's sad because I have a pretty high tolerance for grind -- I've made lots of legendary items in Guild Wars 2... but this kind of grind for basic materials doesn't even come close. It's like the grind before you can even go out and adventure.
---
Ridiculous, I wondered why my stash weight was way over the max when I logged in.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Exactly!  It would seem they are trying to fix their broken experiment with nerfs that were not universally supported instead of new content and features to make the game as robust as possible.
---
Digging in!  
---
Honestly this nerd makes me feel like going back, since I won‚Äôt get one shorted by some guy with a two shot exploding flamer or whatever the meta was 
---
Wow you are doing some insane mental gymnastics. How do people like you even function in society? Are you really not intelligent enough to dispute my simple point?
---
Lol "people like OP didn't care" I think you guys are misunderstanding what I mean. The main point I was trying to make was the seemingly randomness when it comes to what they choose to patch. 
---
Bulking everything was always just a waste of plastic. Until they fix this bug, just scrap all your bulk back down, and only bulk stuff that you are going to sell.
---
Trust me you want bug fixes before more content is added.
---
You are paying for a health buff until that event is over. That cannot be denied. I really wish I could change the title to include the +15, my first title was more descriptive but too long. Also somthing to note is the other two events you mentioned i unintentionally  took part in, because they were free Thanks for your comment.
---
Woah man. You‚Äôre suggesting people just make their character without worrying if it‚Äôs the most overpowered it can be. How dare you.
---
I suggest if you are feeling angry about the recent changes or the game in general become a Raider and burn it to the ground.
---
Exactly this.
---
Again, I am not even saying FIRE anyone. But those in charge need to take a step back and let someone else have the helm. Of FO76. Of QA (assuming they have one, which I doubt). Of the entire company, in fact. 
---
Because without a leadership change, the culture of repeated failures WILL kill this studio. 
---
This. I kept reading going ‚Äúeventually he‚Äôs going to get to what he has issues with, right?‚Äù 
---
Nope. 
---
the problem is you can solo everything in the game with just power armor that you get as quest rewards and any super sledge because they wanted people to be able to do it solo  
---
so if you actually play with a team, you sprint though the game in a few days and have nothing else to do but pvp 
---
I had to reset ps4, didnt uninstall, seems functional for now
---
Generally how these games work is the host runs some server software (either separate or built into the game client), and other people can join that server, either from within their LAN or remotely from anywhere, depending on how the server is configured. So playing ‚Äúoffline‚Äù in this case would just mean playing on a local server that nobody else has access to. Character data are usually stored on the server then, so if you wanted to move to a different server, you‚Äôd have to start a new character.
---
As far as mods, what you‚Äôve been using are client-side mods, i.e. mods that only run on your machine. You can change assets (textures, models, UI elements, etc.) on the client, but since core game mechanics (mob spawning, leveling up, damage calculations, etc.) are processed on the server, the mods you‚Äôre using can‚Äôt change those things. As far as I know, Bethesda are officially supporting *server-side mods* alongside private server support. This would allow for the possibility of things like damage rebalancing, new game modes, changed to CAMP budget limits and mechanics, etc. Server side mods can‚Äôt change how weapons look or add brand new monster models or anything like that though.
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet 
---
My butt hurts because I was followed by a level 217 one shotting everything before I could tag them, while trying to level a new build because I haven't gotten a stat point respec :)
---
Because I can.
---
Yeah, they miss the point of make it known to the devs, not try to abuse it so a 1% drop has the same player base spread as if it was an 80% drop. 
---
Thanks for your sloppy seconds.ü§ó
---
So just out of curiousity since you can't keep up anymore, what did you use before you had a overpowered TSE
---
If anything I would say this project was an attempt to get a profitable live service from MINIMAL investment. Massive reuse of assets, shaving back on human NPCs was probably to avoid having to animate and localise the facial animations and scripting other kind of interactions that could make the world feel alive. Porting over bugs from prior games without fixing them until it was an embarrassment. There are some greedy motherfuckers making calls that essentially ruined the companies reputation and I hope they decide to pull out and try exploiting some other revenue stream because their short-sightedness is fucking with a franchise I love. 
---
Wow. We need a hotfix for this shit like tonight.
---
You can also get alot of downvotes 
---
Never used it, so why would that bother me?
---
Same..PC Ign: RizingToBe
---
Then I‚Äôm in agreement with OP. All damage buffs for heavy and anti armor Gatling gun still isn‚Äôt enough. Love to try again after I have enough violet flux for 50 cal prime receiver. 
---
Non-PA melee player here, and I've rocked unarmed Instigating and Vampire's SS Fists for a while. Mixture of Vanguard and Mutant's armor, no problems at all. Very fun.
---
youe are? so we will never see another comment on the 76 forums from you? ok lets wait and see....
---
Did I blame the devs????
---
nope. with unyielding, +str armor, radicool, chems, booze, mutations, SiN, etc. you can get 15k on a bloodied fist, easy. ninja is a x3 sneak multiplier and at 30+ agi you're always in caution.
---
throw in sentinel/cavalier and you don't need to worry about low health either. there's just one too many ways to boost str and melee scales exceptionally well with it.
---
